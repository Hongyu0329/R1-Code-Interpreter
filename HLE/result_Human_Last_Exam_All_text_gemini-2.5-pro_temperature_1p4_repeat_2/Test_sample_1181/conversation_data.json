    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from the 1972 film *Solaris* who expresses a particular feeling: shame about missing the sound of rustling leaves on Earth. This is a question about a specific line of dialogue and the character who speaks it.\n\n2.  **Recall the main characters and their roles:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the station. He is deeply connected to his memories of Earth, especially his dacha (country house) and his deceased wife, Hari.\n    *   **Hari:** Kris's deceased wife, resurrected by the Solaris ocean. She is not a human from Earth and has no direct memories of it, only those derived from Kris's mind. Therefore, she wouldn't miss something she never experienced.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut:** One of the two surviving scientists. He is cynical, world-weary, and often engages in philosophical discussions with Kris about humanity, science, and their predicament. He serves as a voice of disillusioned experience.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius:** The other scientist. He is cold, logical, and strictly focused on the scientific aspects of the Solaris phenomenon, viewing the \"visitors\" as objects for study or extermination. He is emotionally detached.\n    *   **Gibarian:** A scientist who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. He appears only in a recorded video message, expressing fear and warning Kris.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the sentiment for each character:**\n    *   The feeling of being \"ashamed to miss\" a simple natural sound like rustling leaves suggests a deep longing for Earth, a sense of alienation, and a philosophical reflection on what has been lost by being in space for so long.\n    *   **Hari** can be eliminated, as she is not from Earth.\n    *   **Sartorius** is an unlikely candidate. His character is defined by his rejection of emotion and nostalgia in favor of cold, hard science. He is the least likely to express such a poetic and sentimental thought.\n    *   **Gibarian** is seen only in a state of distress and paranoia, not nostalgic reflection.\n    *   **Kris** is a strong candidate because the film frames his story with scenes of nature on Earth. However, his primary internal conflict is with his guilt over Hari, not a general homesickness expressed in this specific way.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut** is the most plausible character. He frequently voices the philosophical and psychological toll of their isolation. He often speaks about the fundamental needs of humanity and how their mission has alienated them from those needs. This specific sentiment fits perfectly with his character's function in the film.\n\n4.  **Confirm the specific dialogue:** In a conversation with Kris Kelvin, Dr. Snaut reflects on their isolation and detachment from Earthly existence. He says (in translation), \"You know... all that's missing is just a couple of trifles. For example, the rustling of leaves... It's even shameful to admit that I've almost forgotten the sound.\" This line directly confirms that Snaut is the character in question.\n\n5.  **Match with the answer choices:**\n    *   A. Kris - Incorrect.\n    *   B. Hari - Incorrect.\n    *   C. Snaut - Correct.\n    *   D. Sartorius - Incorrect.\n    *   E. Gibarian - Incorrect.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The question is specific to the **1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie**, not the original novel by Stanislaw Lem or the 2002 remake. Character portrayals and dialogue can vary significantly between these versions.\n*   The phrasing \"ashamed to miss\" is a slight paraphrase of the subtitle's translation \"shameful to admit that I've almost forgotten,\" but the core meaning and the key elements (shame, leaves rustling) are the same.\n*   Understanding the thematic role of each character is crucial. Snaut acts as the philosophical commentator on the human condition in the film, making him the natural source for such an observation.\n\nThe final answer is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
