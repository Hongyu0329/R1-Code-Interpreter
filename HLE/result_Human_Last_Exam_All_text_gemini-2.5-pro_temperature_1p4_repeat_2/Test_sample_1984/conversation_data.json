    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Equation and Identify Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe given autonomous differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$, which means we need to solve $f(x) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we factor the polynomial $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) $$\nRecognizing the term in the parenthesis as a perfect square:\n$$ f(x) = -x(x - 1)^2 $$\nSetting $f(x) = 0$ gives us the roots:\n$$ -x(x - 1)^2 = 0 $$\nThis implies either $x = 0$ or $(x - 1)^2 = 0$.\nThe equilibrium points are therefore $x_1 = 0$ and $x_2 = 1$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Stability of Each Equilibrium Point**\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$ for an equation $x' = f(x)$ can be determined by analyzing the sign of the derivative, $f'(x)$, at that point.\n*   If $f'(x^*) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x^*) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and further analysis is needed.\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow we test each equilibrium point:\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:**\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:**\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method to determine the stability of $x=1$.\n\n**Step 2.1: Alternative Stability Analysis for $x=1$ (Sign Analysis)**\n\nWe can analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$.\nThe term $(x-1)^2$ is always positive for any $x \\neq 1$.\nThe term $-x$ is negative for any $x > 0$.\n\n*   For $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$): $f(x) = -(+)(+)^2 = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution moves to the left (towards 1).\n*   For $x$ slightly less than 1 (but still positive, e.g., $x = 0.9$): $f(x) = -(+)(+)^2 = \\text{negative}$. This means $x'(t) < 0$, so the solution moves to the left (away from 1).\n\nA phase line diagram summarizes this behavior:\n$$ \\dots \\text{(moves right)} \\to 0 \\leftarrow \\text{(moves left)} \\to 1 \\leftarrow \\text{(moves left)} \\dots $$\nFor an equilibrium point to be stable, solutions on both sides must converge towards it. At $x=1$, solutions from the right move towards it, but solutions from the left move away. This type of equilibrium is called semi-stable, which is considered a form of **unstable** equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Number of Stable Equilibrium Points**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n*   $x=0$ is a stable equilibrium point.\n*   $x=1$ is a semi-stable (and therefore not stable) equilibrium point.\n\nSo, there is only one stable equilibrium point. The number of stable equilibrium points is $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Final Expression**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$ we found:\n$$ m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Finding all equilibrium points:** It is crucial to factor the polynomial completely to find all roots. A forgotten root leads to an incorrect analysis.\n2.  **Definition of Stability:** A stable equilibrium point requires solutions from all nearby initial conditions to converge to it (or at least remain close). Semi-stable points, where convergence only happens from one side, are not classified as stable.\n3.  **Inconclusive Derivative Test:** When $f'(x^*) = 0$, you must not assume anything about stability. A sign analysis of $f(x)$ around $x^*$ or an analysis of higher-order derivatives is necessary to make a conclusion. In this case, the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ does not change from positive to negative at $x=1$, which confirms it is not a stable point.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The final step is an arithmetic calculation. Ensure you substitute the correct value for $m$.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The differential equation is $x' = f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$.\n2.  The equilibrium points are the roots of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2 = 0$, which are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n3.  The stability is checked using $f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$.\n4.  For $x=0$, $f'(0)=-1 < 0$, so $x=0$ is stable.\n5.  For $x=1$, $f'(1)=0$. A sign analysis of $f(x)$ around $x=1$ shows it is semi-stable, hence not stable.\n6.  The number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n7.  The required expression is $m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
