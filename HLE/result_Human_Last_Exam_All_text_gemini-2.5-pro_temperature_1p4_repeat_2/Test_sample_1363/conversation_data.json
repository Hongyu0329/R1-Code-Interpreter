    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Reverse Turn\":** This refers to a standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to the left. It exists in all five Standard dances listed.\n    *   **\"Overturn\":** This means to rotate more than the amount of turn prescribed in the standard syllabus description of the figure. For example, turning a full circle (360 degrees) when the figure is designed for a 3/4 turn (270 degrees).\n    *   **\"Impossible ... without disregarding the technique\":** This is the core of the question. It asks us to identify the dance where the fundamental, defining principles of its technique make it a violation to add extra rotation to a reverse turn. We need to consider the core mechanics of each dance.\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Dance Style:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** The technique is based on continuous rotation and body swing. Overturning turns is not only possible but also a common choreographic tool to navigate the dance floor and add variety. The inherent rotational momentum of the dance facilitates this.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz:** The technique is defined by body swing, sway, and rise & fall. These elements generate the turning action. A skilled dancer can use more swing and a controlled rise and fall to generate extra rotation, overturning the figure. While it requires good control, it does not violate the fundamental principles of the dance; it's an exaggeration of them.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** This dance is unique among the Standard dances. Its core technique includes:\n        *   **No body swing:** Movement is initiated from the feet and legs, with a strong, connected, and relatively still upper body frame.\n        *   **No rise and fall:** The dancers maintain a constant height with flexed knees, giving it a grounded, \"stalking\" quality.\n        *   **Staccato action:** Movements are sharp, clipped, and precise, not flowing.\n        *   **\"No Foot Rise\":** The feet are kept in close contact with the floor.\n        *   To overturn a turn in Tango, one would need to generate extra rotation. Without body swing or rise & fall to help, a dancer would be forced to twist or swivel on the foot in a way that is not characteristic of the dance's clean, \"placed\" footwork. It would disrupt the staccato timing and break the static frame. Therefore, overturning a turn fundamentally violates the core principles of Tango technique.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** This dance is characterized by its long, gliding, continuous movement. Like the Waltz, it uses body swing (though with a different character) to generate movement and turn. The continuous flow allows for the blending of extra rotation into the figures without necessarily breaking the core technique, although it requires high skill.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This dance is fast and dynamic, full of energy. It uses momentum, swing, and quick pivotal actions. The high speed and momentum make it relatively easy to overturn figures, especially pivots. Such actions are frequently used in choreography to create sharp, impressive highlights.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n\n    The swing dances (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep) all rely on body swing and momentum, which can be manipulated to produce more or less turn. The European Tango, however, is defined by the *absence* of these elements. Its grounded, staccato, and non-swinging technique is fundamentally incompatible with the actions required to smoothly overturn a figure like the reverse turn. Doing so would constitute a clear disregard for its defining technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
