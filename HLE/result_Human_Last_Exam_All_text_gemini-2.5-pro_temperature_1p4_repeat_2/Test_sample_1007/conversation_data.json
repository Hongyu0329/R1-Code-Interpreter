    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it starts.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify the classical ballet step from the given options where the final leg position is identical to the initial leg position. This includes not only the type of position (e.g., fifth position) but also which foot is in front.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Answer Choices**\n\n1.  **A. Entrechat six**\n    *   **Starting Position:** The step begins in fifth position with one foot in front of the other (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a vertical jump from fifth position. The name \"six\" refers to six movements of the legs crossing in the air (three openings and three closings, or three full \"changes\"). In classical technique, an even-numbered *entrechat* (like *quatre* or *six*) always lands with the feet in the original starting position. The multiple changes effectively cancel each other out, returning the original front foot to the front upon landing.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the same foot in front as at the start.\n    *   **Careful Point:** It is a fundamental rule for even-numbered *entrechats* that the feet do not change their front/back orientation from start to finish.\n\n2.  **B. Échappé battu changé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** *Échappé* is an \"escaping\" movement, typically a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second), and back to closed. *Battu* means it is \"beaten\" (the calves strike each other). *Changé* explicitly means \"changed.\" This indicates that when the feet return to fifth position, they will have swapped their front/back orientation.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The term *changé* in the name of the step is a direct giveaway that the position changes.\n\n3.  **C. Assemblé**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Typically begins from fifth position, with one leg sliding out (a *battement glissé* or *dégagé*).\n    *   **Movement:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The dancer jumps off the supporting leg, and both legs come together in the air before landing simultaneously in fifth position. However, there are many types of *assemblé*. For example, in an *assemblé dessus* (over), the working leg lands in front, changing the starting position. In an *assemblé dessous* (under), the working leg lands behind, also changing the position if it started in front.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The final foot placement depends entirely on the type of *assemblé* being performed. It does not inherently end in the same position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Because the ending position is variable and often different from the start, this is not the correct answer.\n\n4.  **D. Glissade derrière**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** *Glissade* is a gliding step. For *glissade derrière* (behind), the dancer glides the back foot out to the side, transfers weight to it, and then the front foot closes *behind* it in fifth position.\n    *   **Ending Position:** The foot that started in front (the right foot) is now in the back. The position has changed.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The direction *derrière* specifies how the leading foot closes, which results in a change of feet.\n\n5.  **E. Gargouillade**\n    *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n    *   **Movement:** This is a complex, decorative jump, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg in the air.\n    *   **Ending Position:** Like the *assemblé*, the final position can vary depending on the specific execution and choreography. It can be performed to finish with the same foot in front or with the feet changed. It is not defined by returning to the original position.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a traveling step, and its primary characteristic is the \"gurgling\" leg action, not the starting and ending foot placement.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter analyzing all the steps, **Entrechat six** is the only one that, by its definition in classical ballet technique, requires the dancer to land in the exact same foot position from which they started. The even number of beats ensures a return to the original configuration.\n\n<<<A>>>"
