    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Terms:**\n    *   **Organism:** *Irritator challengeri*. This is a specific species of spinosaurid theropod dinosaur.\n    *   **Anatomical Feature:** Lacrimal recess. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket. A recess is an indentation or depression on a bone.\n    *   **Question:** How many depressions are contained *within* this lacrimal recess?\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Scientific Source:** To answer a highly specific anatomical question like this, we must consult the primary scientific literature that describes the skull of *Irritator challengeri*. The most detailed and authoritative description of the *Irritator* skull (holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled: \"*Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil*\".\n\n3.  **Examine the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** Within this paper, the authors provide a detailed, bone-by-bone description of the skull. We need to find the section on the lacrimal bone.\n\n4.  **Find the Specific Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** In the description of the lacrimal, the authors state the following (on page 543): \"The medial surface of the descending process of the lacrimal exposes the lacrimal recess for the antorbital pneumatic sinus. As in *Baryonyx* and *Suchomimus*, **this recess is subdivided by a vertical ridge into an anterior and a posterior depression.**\"\n\n5.  **Interpret the Finding:** The description is explicit. The larger lacrimal recess is divided into smaller sections. The phrasing \"an anterior and a posterior depression\" directly states that there are two such depressions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the question:** The question asks for the number of depressions *within* the lacrimal recess, not the number of recesses on the entire lacrimal bone.\n*   **Source credibility:** It is essential to rely on peer-reviewed scientific papers that describe the holotype specimen directly, rather than general websites or summaries which might be less precise. The Sues et al. (2002) paper is the definitive source for this anatomical detail.\n*   **Anatomical context:** The description specifies that these depressions are on the *medial surface* (the side facing the midline of the skull) of the *descending process* (the part of the bone that extends downwards). It also clarifies that these depressions are separated by a \"vertical ridge,\" confirming they are distinct features.\n*   **Comparative anatomy:** The paper notes that this feature (a subdivided lacrimal recess) is also present in other related spinosaurids like *Baryonyx* and *Suchomimus*, reinforcing this as a known characteristic of the group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the direct description in the key scientific paper on the anatomy of *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess is subdivided into two depressions.\n\n<<<2>>>"
