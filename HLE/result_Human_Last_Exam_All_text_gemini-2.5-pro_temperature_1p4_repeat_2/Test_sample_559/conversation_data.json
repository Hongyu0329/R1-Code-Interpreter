    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the system.\n\n**1. Identify the System and Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$$ d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u) $$\n$$ u' = u^2(u-1) $$\nWe are interested in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\nFrom $u' = 0$, we have $u^2(u-1) = 0$, which gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $d' = 2d^2 + (5-3)d - 0 = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Stability of Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):** $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n*   **At (1, -1):** $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. One positive and one negative eigenvalue mean that $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n*   **At (0, 0):** $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This is a degenerate point, and linearization does not determine its stability.\n\n**3. Define and Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of the phase plane with qualitatively different behaviors. The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices. The system has a saddle point at $(1, -1)$. We will look for its manifolds.\n\nLet's find the equation of the trajectory in the phase plane, which satisfies the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\nThis is a complex Riccati equation. We can try to find a simple particular solution, for example a polynomial curve $d = f(u)$ that is an invariant manifold of the system. Let's test for a quadratic solution of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$.\n\nSubstituting $d(u)$ and its derivative $d'(u) = (2au+b)u' = (2au+b)u^2(u-1)$ into the first differential equation $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$:\n$$ (2au+b)(u^3-u^2) = 2(au^2+bu+c)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(au^2+bu+c) - u^3+u^4 $$\nExpanding both sides and equating coefficients of powers of $u$:\n*   $u^4$: $2a = 2a^2 + 5a + 1 \\implies 2a^2+3a+1=0 \\implies (2a+1)(a+1)=0$. So $a=-1$ or $a=-1/2$.\n*   $u^3$: $b-2a = 2(2ab) + 5b-3a \\implies b-2a = 4ab+5b-3a \\implies 4ab+4b-a=0$.\n*   Constant: $0 = 2c^2 \\implies c=0$.\nWith $c=0$, the coefficient of $u$ becomes $0=0$. The coefficient of $u^2$ becomes $-b = 2b^2-3b \\implies 2b^2-2b=0 \\implies 2b(b-1)=0$. So $b=0$ or $b=1$.\n\nWe test the possible cases for $a, b, c$:\n*   **Case 1: $a=-1$**\n    *   If $b=0$: The equation for $u^3$ coefficients becomes $4(-1)(0)+4(0)-(-1)=1 \\neq 0$. Rechecking calculation.\n    Let's re-equate $u^3$ coefficients correctly:\n    LHS: $b-2a$\n    RHS: $2(2ab) + (5b-3a) -1 = 4ab+5b-3a-1$\n    Equating them: $b-2a = 4ab+5b-3a-1 \\implies 4ab+4b-a-1=0$.\n    *   Test $a=-1, b=0, c=0$: $4(-1)(0)+4(0)-(-1)-1 = 0+0+1-1=0$. This is a valid solution. It corresponds to the curve $d = -u^2$.\n    *   Test $a=-1, b=1, c=0$: $4(-1)(1)+4(1)-(-1)-1 = -4+4+1-1=0$. This is also a valid solution. It corresponds to $d=-u^2+u = u(1-u)$.\n*   **Case 2: $a=-1/2$**\n    *   If $b=0$ or $b=1$, the equation $4ab+4b-a-1=0$ is not satisfied. For $b=1/4$, it is satisfied, but $b$ must be $0$ or $1$. So no solution here.\n\nSo we have found two invariant curves:\n1.  $d = -u^2$\n2.  $d = u(1-u)$\n\nLet's check if these curves pass through the equilibrium points.\n*   The curve $d=-u^2$ passes through $(0,0)$ (since $-0^2=0$) and $(1, -1)$ (since $-1^2=-1$). This curve connects the degenerate point $(0,0)$ to the saddle point $(1,-1)$. The unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ is tangent to its eigenvector for $\\lambda=1$, which is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The slope of $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$ is $d'(1) = -2(1) = -2$. The slope matches. Therefore, the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n*   The curve $d=u(1-u)$ passes through $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$. This curve connects the source $(1,0)$ to the degenerate point $(0,0)$.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point, $d=-u^2$, acts as a separatrix. It divides the phase plane into regions where trajectories have different long-term behavior. For instance, for initial conditions in $(0,1)\\times\\mathbb{R}$, trajectories starting above this curve will be attracted to the origin $(0,0)$, while trajectories starting below this curve will have $d \\to -\\infty$ as $u \\to 0$. This is the classic role of a separatrix.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n>>>$d = -u^2$"
