The small molecules that form protein-ligand interactions with CHEMBL4803817 (SARS-CoV-2 main protease) include, but are not limited to, the following prominent examples:
1.  **Nirmatrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4651336):** A potent covalent inhibitor and the active component of the drug Paxlovid.
2.  **Ensitrelvir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL5075677):** A potent non-covalent inhibitor approved as an antiviral drug in some countries.
3.  **GC-376 (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL4217531):** An important veterinary coronavirus protease inhibitor that served as a scaffold for developing other inhibitors.
4.  **Boceprevir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL1577):** An HCV protease inhibitor that was found to have activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
5.  **Lopinavir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL744):** An HIV protease inhibitor that was repurposed and tested against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.
6.  **Ritonavir (ChEMBL ID: CHEMBL658):** Another HIV protease inhibitor that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, though with weak activity.
