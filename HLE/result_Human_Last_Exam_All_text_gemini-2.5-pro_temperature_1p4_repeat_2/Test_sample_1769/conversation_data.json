    "This question asks for a hypothetical reconstruction of a Modern English word under a counterfactual historical condition. To answer it, we must trace the etymology of our current word, identify the original word it replaced, and then project how that original word would have evolved according to the known patterns of English language development.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the origin of the current word \"sister\".**\nThe modern word \"sister\" does not come directly from Old English (the language of the Anglo-Saxons). It is a loanword from Old Norse, the language spoken by the Viking invaders.\n*   **Old Norse:** *systir*\n*   **Modern English:** *sister*\nThe phonological and spelling similarities are very clear. The introduction of this word into the English language is a direct result of the close interaction, settlement, and intermingling between the Norse and Anglo-Saxon populations, particularly in the Danelaw region of England between the 9th and 11th centuries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the native Old English word for \"sister\".**\nBefore the Old Norse *systir* became popular, the Anglo-Saxons had their own word for a female sibling. This word was:\n*   **Old English:** *sweostor* (also spelled *swustor*)\nThis word shares an even older common ancestor with the Old Norse word, from the Proto-Germanic word *\\*swestēr*. However, its form and pronunciation were distinct.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze what would have happened without Norse influence.**\nThe core of the question is the counterfactual: \"if the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons\". In this scenario, the Old Norse word *systir* would never have been introduced into the English vocabulary. Therefore, the native Old English word, *sweostor*, would have continued to evolve naturally along with the rest of the language.\n\n**Step 4: Project the evolution of Old English \"sweostor\" into Modern English.**\nWe can predict the likely evolution of *sweostor* by comparing it to the evolution of other similar Old English words that did survive.\n\n*   **From Old English to Middle English:**\n    *   The Old English diphthong `eo` in *sweostor* would likely have simplified. This happened in different ways in different dialects. It could become `e` (leading to *swester*) or `u` (leading to *suster*).\n    *   Both *swester* and *suster* are attested forms found in Middle English texts. For example, John Wycliffe's Bible translation from the 14th century uses \"suster\" where the King James Version would later use \"sister\". This tells us that *suster* was a very real and common form that was in direct competition with the Norse-derived *sister*.\n\n*   **From Middle English to Modern English:**\n    *   Let's take the most common native form, *suster*, as our basis. We need to see how it would have been affected by major sound changes, primarily the Great Vowel Shift (c. 1400-1700).\n    *   The vowel 'u' in Middle English *suster* (pronounced like the 'oo' in \"foot\") would typically shift to the /ʌ/ sound in Modern English (the 'u' in \"cut\" or \"sun\").\n    *   We can see this exact change in other words: ME *sone* -> ModE *son*; ME *come* -> ModE *come*.\n    *   The kinship term *brother* comes from OE *brōþor* and also developed this /ʌ/ sound.\n    *   Therefore, Middle English *suster* would have naturally evolved into a Modern English word pronounced /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n*   **Final Spelling and Form:**\n    *   The spelling would likely have standardized as **Suster**. It fits perfectly with the phonological development and maintains a parallel structure with other native kinship terms like *brother* and *mother*.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Certainty:** Linguistic evolution is not a perfect science. It is influenced by dialectal variations, social prestige, and random chance. This analysis provides the most probable outcome based on known linguistic patterns, not an absolute certainty.\n2.  **The Attested Alternative:** The key piece of evidence is that the word *suster* actually existed and was widely used. We are not creating a word from scratch; we are projecting the future of a word that lost a historical competition.\n3.  **Role of Analogy:** The word would likely have been influenced by analogy with similar words. The pattern of *mother* and *brother* would have strongly reinforced the evolution of *suster* along a similar path.\n4.  **Exclusion:** The premise requires us to completely exclude the Norse influence, which means the word *sister* would simply not be a part of the English lexicon. The vacancy would be filled by the descendant of the native term.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWithout the influence of the Old Norse *systir*, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have evolved through the Middle English form *suster*. Following standard English sound changes, this would have resulted in the Modern English word **Suster**.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
