    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the specific name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n2.  **Identify the Core Measurement:** The prompt states that Beat-to-Beat intervals are captured. This interval is a measurement of time, typically in milliseconds (ms), between one heartbeat and the next.\n3.  **Understand the Technology (PPG):** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is mentioned as the method of capture. PPG works by shining light into the skin and measuring changes in light absorption, which correspond to the pulse waves of blood flow caused by each heartbeat. The time between these pulse peaks is measured.\n4.  **Connect to HRV:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is not the interval itself, but rather a set of statistical metrics that describe the degree of fluctuation in these successive time intervals. To calculate HRV, you first need a series of these time interval measurements.\n5.  **Identify the Terminology:** The question is asking for the name of this fundamental time interval. There are several related terms:\n    *   **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI):** This is the most technically accurate term for an interval measured using PPG, as PPG detects the blood pulse.\n    *   **Interbeat Interval (IBI):** This is a more general and widely used term that refers to the time between any two consecutive heartbeats, regardless of the measurement technology.\n    *   **R-R Interval (RRI):** This is the term derived from the gold-standard measurement method, the electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG measures the heart's electrical activity, and the most prominent peak in the signal is called the \"R-wave.\" The R-R interval is the time between two consecutive R-waves.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Synonymous Usage:** In the field of HRV, even when data is collected via PPG, the resulting intervals are often referred to as **R-R intervals** or **Interbeat Intervals (IBI)**. This is because the goal of using PPG for HRV is to accurately estimate the true R-R intervals that an ECG would measure.\n*   **Context is Key:** While PPI is technically precise for PPG, the term **R-R interval** is the most common and standard term used in scientific literature and by consumer wearable companies when discussing the data points used for HRV analysis.\n*   **Filtering:** Often, raw R-R intervals are filtered to remove artifacts or premature beats (arrhythmias). The resulting \"normal-to-normal\" intervals are sometimes called **NN intervals**. However, the fundamental value being measured is still the R-R interval.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the time measured between consecutive heartbeats, which serves as the raw data for calculating HRV, is most commonly and standardly referred to as the **R-R interval**. While other terms like IBI exist and are also correct, the R-R interval is the most specific and widely recognized term in the context of HRV analysis.\n\n<<<R-R interval"
