    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Board and the Pieces**\n\n*   A standard chessboard has 8x8 = 64 squares.\n*   The \"edge squares\" are all squares in the first and last rows (ranks 1 and 8) and the first and last columns (files 'a' and 'h').\n*   The piece in question is the bishop. Bishops move and attack along diagonals. A key property is that a bishop always stays on squares of the same color it started on.\n\n**Step 2: Count the Total Number of Edge Squares**\n\n*   There are 8 squares on the top row and 8 on the bottom row.\n*   There are 8 squares on the left column and 8 on the right column.\n*   To avoid double-counting the four corner squares, the total is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = 28.\n*   Alternatively: 8 squares on rank 1 + 8 squares on rank 8 + 6 squares on file 'a' (excluding corners) + 6 squares on file 'h' (excluding corners) = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 edge squares.\n\n**Step 3: Decouple the Problem by Color**\n\n*   Bishops on light-colored squares can never attack bishops on dark-colored squares.\n*   This means we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results. We need to find the maximum number of bishops we can place on the light edge squares, and then separately, the maximum number we can place on the dark edge squares.\n*   By counting, we find there are 14 light-colored edge squares and 14 dark-colored edge squares.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on the Light-Colored Edge Squares**\n\nTo place the maximum number of bishops, we need to identify which squares attack each other. Let's list the 14 light edge squares and the diagonals they share with other light edge squares.\n\n*   The 14 light edge squares are: `a8, c8, e8, g8, b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, h3, h5, h7`.\n*   Let's analyze the attack paths (diagonals) connecting these squares:\n    1.  The corner squares `a8` and `h1` attack each other. We can only place one bishop between them.\n    2.  The square `g8` attacks `a2`. `a2` attacks `b1`. `b1` attacks `h7`. This forms an attack chain: `g8-a2-b1-h7`. From these 4 squares, we can pick a maximum of 2 non-attacking ones (e.g., `g8` and `b1`).\n    3.  The square `c8` attacks `a6`. `a6` attacks `f1`. `f1` attacks `h3`. This forms another chain: `c8-a6-f1-h3`. From these 4 squares, we can also pick a maximum of 2 non-attacking ones (e.g., `c8` and `f1`).\n    4.  The square `e8` attacks `a4`. `a4` attacks `d1`. `d1` attacks `h5`. This forms a final chain: `e8-a4-d1-h5`. From these 4 squares, we can pick a maximum of 2 non-attacking ones (e.g., `e8` and `d1`).\n*   So, we have four independent groups of squares:\n    *   Group 1: `a8, h1` (2 squares) -> Max bishops = 1\n    *   Group 2: `g8, a2, b1, h7` (4 squares) -> Max bishops = 2\n    *   Group 3: `c8, a6, f1, h3` (4 squares) -> Max bishops = 2\n    *   Group 4: `e8, a4, d1, h5` (4 squares) -> Max bishops = 2\n*   Total maximum bishops on light edge squares = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on the Dark-Colored Edge Squares**\n\n*   The arrangement of the 14 dark edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the arrangement of the 14 light edge squares.\n*   Therefore, the same logical analysis applies. We can also place a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops on the 14 dark edge squares.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\n\n*   Maximum bishops on light edge squares = 7.\n*   Maximum bishops on dark edge squares = 7.\n*   Total maximum bishops that can be placed on all edge squares = 7 + 7 = 14.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Number of edge squares lacking bishops = (Total edge squares) - (Total placed bishops).\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
