The local magnetic field at the L1 point is not considered radial; it follows the Parker Spiral. The use of magnetic components perpendicular to the radial direction is a practical approximation justified by Taylor's Hypothesis, which states that the very fast, radial solar wind flow dominates the dynamics observed by a spacecraft. This makes the radial direction the de facto axis of measurement, and the approximation is most valid for waves propagating along a nearly radial magnetic field (quasi-parallel propagation).
