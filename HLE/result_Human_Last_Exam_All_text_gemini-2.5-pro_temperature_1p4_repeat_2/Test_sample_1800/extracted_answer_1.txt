The ideal ratio is not a single value but a range that depends heavily on the synthesis method and specific reaction conditions. However, for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and thermochemical Water Splitting (TWS), the catalytic performance is generally maximized at a Ni/Ce atomic ratio between 1/9 and 1/4. This corresponds to a molar percentage of Ni/(Ni+Ce) from 10% to 20%, which provides the best balance between having sufficient Ni active sites and maximizing the synergistic interface with the Ceria support while preventing Ni particle sintering.
