    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Decomposition of the Algorithm:**\n    The algorithm can be broken down into three main parts:\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization.** This part is executed only once at the beginning.\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop.** This is the core part of the algorithm, and its execution time depends on the number of iterations.\n    *   **Step 3: Return.** This part is executed once at the end.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Each Step:**\n\n    *   **Step 1: Initialization**\n        *   The line `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;` involves a series of basic arithmetic operations: assignment, division, multiplication, and subtraction.\n        *   Assuming a standard model of computation where these operations on integers take a constant amount of time, the time complexity of this step is constant.\n        *   Time complexity of Step 1: **O(1)**.\n\n    *   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n        *   To find the complexity of the loop, we need to determine two things:\n            a. The cost of a single iteration of the loop.\n            b. The total number of times the loop iterates.\n\n        *   **a. Cost of a single iteration:**\n            *   The body of the loop (Step 2.1) consists of the operations: `i := i + 1; x := q; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`.\n            *   These are again basic arithmetic and assignment operations. Each of them takes constant time.\n            *   Therefore, the cost of a single iteration of the `while` loop is **O(1)**.\n\n        *   **b. Number of iterations:**\n            *   The loop continues as long as the condition `q > 0` is true.\n            *   Let's track the value of `q`.\n            *   Before the loop starts, `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n            *   Inside the first iteration, `x` becomes the old `q`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊x/c⌋ = ⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n            *   After the second iteration, `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n            *   In general, after `k` iterations, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n            *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`.\n            *   The condition `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0` is true if and only if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`.\n            *   Rearranging the inequality, we get `n < c^(k+1)`.\n            *   To find `k`, the number of iterations, we can take the logarithm with base `c` on both sides: `log_c(n) < k+1`, which implies `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n            *   The number of iterations `k` is the smallest integer that satisfies this, which means `k` is essentially `floor(log_c(n))` (for n ≥ c).\n            *   Thus, the number of iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The number of iterations is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n        *   **Total cost of the loop:**\n            *   The total time for the loop is (Number of iterations) × (Cost per iteration).\n            *   Total Loop Time = `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Return**\n        *   The `return` statement passes the final result. This is a constant time operation.\n        *   Time complexity of Step 3: **O(1)**.\n\n3.  **Overall Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity of the algorithm is the sum of the complexities of its parts:\n        `T(n) = T(Step 1) + T(Step 2) + T(Step 3)`\n        `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c(n)) + O(1)`\n    *   The dominant term in this expression is `O(log_c(n))`.\n    *   Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`.\n\n4.  **Final Simplification:**\n    *   In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is usually omitted because logarithms with different constant bases are related by a constant factor (`log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`, and `1/log(c)` is a constant).\n    *   Thus, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to **O(log n)**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations like division and modulus take constant time, `O(1)`. This is a common assumption for complexity analysis unless dealing with arbitrarily large numbers where bit complexity would be considered.\n*   **Input Parameter:** The complexity is measured as a function of the value of the integer `n`, not the size of its input representation (e.g., number of bits).\n*   **Loop Control Variable:** The key to the analysis is understanding that the effective value being processed (`q`) is divided by the base `c` in each iteration. This repeated division is a hallmark of logarithmic complexity.\n*   **Edge Cases:** For small `n` (e.g., `0 ≤ n < c`), the loop does not run at all (`q` starts at 0). The algorithm takes constant time, which is consistent with the `O(log n)` bound.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations of the `while` loop, which is logarithmic with respect to the input `n`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
