The product is a tetracyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The reaction opens the C1-C2 bond of the original bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene skeleton and forms a new C-C bond between C5 of the norbornene part and C2' of the cyclopentenyl substituent. The tertiary alcohol at C2 is converted into a ketone upon aqueous workup of the intermediate enolate. The 7,7-dimethoxy ketal and the (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy groups remain intact.
