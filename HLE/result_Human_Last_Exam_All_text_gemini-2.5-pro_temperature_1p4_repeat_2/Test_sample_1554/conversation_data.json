    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher who belongs to a particular philosophical school and is known for a specific conceptual distinction.\n*   **Philosophical School:** Lviv-Warsaw School.\n*   **Concept Decomposed:** \"Hallmark\" (or criterion, indicator).\n*   **Components of Decomposition:** \"Symptoms\" and \"Signals\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Lviv-Warsaw School.**\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School was a highly influential movement in Polish logic and philosophy between the World Wars. Its members were known for their commitment to clarity, logical rigor, and semantic analysis. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. This narrows the search to a specific group of thinkers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conceptual distinction: \"Symptoms\" vs. \"Signals\".**\nThis distinction concerns the nature of evidence or indicators. We need to find the philosopher who formalized this difference.\n*   A **symptom** (in Polish, *objaw*) is generally understood as a fallible or probabilistic indicator. If A is a symptom of B, the presence of A makes B more likely, but not certain. The connection is typically empirical or inductive. For example, a fever is a symptom of an infection, but one can have a fever for other reasons.\n*   A **signal** (in Polish, *oznaka*), also translated as a \"mark\" or \"sign,\" is a conclusive or infallible indicator. If A is a signal of B, the presence of A guarantees the presence of B, often by definition or convention. The connection is logical or deductive. For example, having four equal sides and four right angles is a signal of being a square.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the philosopher, school, and concept.**\nBy researching the philosophical contributions of the key members of the Lviv-Warsaw School, we can attribute this specific distinction.\n*   **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is the philosopher most famously associated with this analysis. In his works on logic, methodology of science, and semantics (like his influential book \"Pragmatic Logic\"), he carefully analyzed the different ways one thing can be a sign of another.\n*   He explicitly introduced the distinction between *oznaka* (signal/mark) and *objaw* (symptom) to clarify the different kinds of inference one could draw from evidence. He used this framework to analyze the structure of scientific reasoning and the meaning of terms.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the analysis.**\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the general notion of a hallmark (or indicator, characteristic) into the sub-categories of \"symptoms\" (probabilistic, inductive indicators) and \"signals\" (conclusive, deductive indicators) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
