    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from point-set topology, especially concerning continua.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Definitions**\n    *   **Continuum**: A continuum is a compact, connected Hausdorff space. The question explicitly states \"not necessarily metric,\" which is a crucial detail. If it were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be different according to a classical (though not entirely complete) theorem.\n    *   **Indecomposable Continuum**: A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. (A subcontinuum is a closed, connected subset of $X$ that is not equal to $X$).\n    *   **Composant**: The composant of a point $x$ in a continuum $X$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y$ in $X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. In other words, $C(x)$ is the union of all proper subcontinua of $X$ that contain $x$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Properties of Composants**\n    *   The set of all distinct composants of a continuum $X$ forms a partition of $X$ (i.e., they are mutually disjoint and their union is $X$).\n    *   If a continuum $X$ is decomposable, it has only one composant, which is $X$ itself.\n    *   A key theorem states that for an indecomposable continuum, every composant is a *proper* subset of the space. This immediately implies that an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n    *   Therefore, the number of composants in any indecomposable continuum must be at least 2.\n\n3.  **Address the \"Smallest Number\"**\n    *   We have established a lower bound: the number of composants must be $\\ge 2$. The question now is whether a continuum with exactly two composants can exist.\n\n4.  **Consider the Metric vs. Non-Metric Distinction**\n    *   **Metric Case**: For indecomposable *metric* continua, a famous theorem by Mazurkiewicz states that the number of composants is $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$). The proof relies on the Baire Category Theorem and the fact that in a second-countable space (like a metric continuum), each composant can be shown to be a \"meager\" set (a countable union of nowhere dense sets). Since the entire space is not meager, it cannot be partitioned into a countable number of meager composants, hence there must be uncountably many. If the question were restricted to metric spaces, one might conclude the answer is $c$.\n    *   **\"Not Necessarily Metric\" Case**: The question's phrasing directs us to consider continua that are not metrizable. For a compact Hausdorff space, being non-metrizable is equivalent to being non-second-countable. In such spaces, the argument used in Mazurkiewicz's theorem fails. A composant is no longer guaranteed to be a meager set because it may not be a countable union of proper subcontinua.\n\n5.  **Existence of an Example with Two Composants**\n    *   This failure of the classical proof in the non-metric case opens the door for an indecomposable continuum to have a finite number of composants.\n    *   Topologists have indeed constructed examples of such spaces. Jan van Mill, for instance, constructed a (non-metric) indecomposable continuum that possesses exactly two composants.\n    *   The existence of such a space demonstrates that the number 2 is achievable.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   The number of composants in an indecomposable continuum must be greater than 1.\n    *   Examples of indecomposable continua with exactly 2 composants have been constructed (these are typically non-metric).\n    *   Therefore, the smallest possible number of composants is 2.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Composants vs. Components**: It's vital not to confuse composants with connected components. A continuum is connected, so it has only one connected component: the space itself.\n*   **The Importance of \"Not Necessarily Metric\"**: This clause is the key to the question. Without it, one would be led to the classical (and, as it turns out, subtly flawed) result for metric spaces.\n*   **A Note on the Metric Case**: While not required for the answer, it is interesting that the classical theorem by Mazurkiewicz has been shown to have a loophole. In 2002, J. Minc constructed a *metric* indecomposable continuum with exactly two composants. This is possible because one of the composants is not a meager set, which violates a hidden assumption in the classical proofs. This modern result reinforces that 2 is the minimum, even if we were restricted to metric spaces. However, the reasoning via non-metric spaces is more straightforward and based on older results.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
