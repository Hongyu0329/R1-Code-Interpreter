    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the curve for the interval $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=1$. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nThese are the standard parametric equations for a circle. As $t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$:\n*   $x$ varies from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n*   $y$ varies from $\\sin(0) = 0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nThis part of the curve traces the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, where $y \\ge 0$.\nThe range of coordinates for this part is:\n*   $x \\in [-1, 1]$\n*   $y \\in [0, 1]$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the curve for the interval $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\nIn this interval, the parameter $b=5$. The parametric equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5\\sin t$\nWe can relate $x$ and $y$ by observing that $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which gives $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$. This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis).\nAs $t$ varies from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$:\n*   $x$ varies from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ up to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   $y$ varies from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\nThis part of the curve traces the lower semi-ellipse of $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$, where $y \\le 0$.\nThe range of coordinates for this part is:\n*   $x \\in (-1, 1]$ (Since $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $\\cos(\\pi)$ is not included but $\\cos(2\\pi)$ is approached). However, to find the full extent, we should consider the closure of the set. The figure spans from $x=-1$ to $x=1$.\n*   $y \\in [-5, 0)$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the overall dimensions of the figure**\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the entire figure, we need to find the overall minimum and maximum values for $x$ and $y$ by combining both parts.\n*   **x-dimension:**\n    *   Maximum x-value ($x_{max}$) is 1 (from both parts).\n    *   Minimum x-value ($x_{min}$) is -1 (from both parts).\n    *   The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **y-dimension:**\n    *   Maximum y-value ($y_{max}$) is 1 (from the first part).\n    *   Minimum y-value ($y_{min}$) is -5 (from the second part).\n    *   The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest enclosing square**\nThe figure is contained within a bounding rectangle defined by $-1 \\le x \\le 1$ and $-5 \\le y \\le 1$. This rectangle has a width of 2 and a height of 6.\nAn \"outcircling\" or enclosing square must be large enough to contain this entire bounding rectangle. The side length of the smallest such square must be equal to the larger dimension of the rectangle.\n*   Side length of the square, $S = \\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square**\nThe area of a square with side length $S$ is $S^2$.\n*   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The parameter $b$ changes value depending on the interval of $t$, creating a piecewise curve.\n*   Recognizing the shapes (semi-circle and semi-ellipse) helps visualize the figure.\n*   The smallest enclosing square (with sides parallel to the axes) is determined by the maximum extent of the figure in either the x or y direction.\n*   It's important to find the full range of x and y values across the entire domain of $t$. The maximum extent in the y-direction comes from the elliptical part, while the maximum extent in the x-direction is the same for both parts.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe figure extends from x = -1 to x = 1, so its width is 2.\nThe figure extends from y = -5 to y = 1, so its height is 6.\nThe side of the smallest outcircling square must be the larger of these two dimensions, which is 6.\nThe area of this square is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
