    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nFirst, we must list the elements known as noble gases. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Metric for Rarity**\nThe question asks for the \"rarest... as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to compare the total abundance (total mass) of each gas on the entire planet (including the atmosphere, crust, and oceans). The year specified, 2002, does not affect the outcome, as the geological and atmospheric abundances of these elements are effectively constant over human timescales.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Stable Noble Gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe)**\nThe vast majority of these gases are found in the Earth's atmosphere. We can get a clear ranking of their rarity by looking at their atmospheric concentrations.\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~0.934% of the atmosphere. It is the most abundant of the rare gases.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.2 parts per million (ppm).\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.2 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion).\n\nBased on atmospheric concentration, Xenon is the rarest among the *stable* noble gases.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the others because it is radioactive. It is not a primordial element left over from the Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously formed by the radioactive decay of radium, which is part of the decay chain of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust.\n\n*   **Short Half-Life:** The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a very short half-life of about 3.8 days.\n*   **Low Steady-State Concentration:** Because it decays so quickly, a large amount of Radon cannot accumulate. The total amount present on Earth at any given moment is a balance between its rate of formation and its rate of decay. This results in an extremely low steady-state concentration.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Stable Gas (Xenon) with Radon**\nTo make a definitive comparison, we can estimate the total mass of each gas on Earth.\n\n*   **Total Mass of Xenon:** The Earth's atmosphere has a mass of about 5.15 x 10¹⁸ kg. With Xenon's mass fraction being roughly 0.4 parts per million, the total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is approximately **2 x 10¹² kg** (2 trillion kilograms).\n*   **Total Mass of Radon:** The total amount of Radon-222 in equilibrium with the radium in the Earth's crust is estimated to be only about **6,500 tonnes**, which is 6.5 x 10⁶ kg (6.5 million kilograms).\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nComparing the total masses, the amount of Radon (6.5 x 10⁶ kg) is vastly smaller than the amount of Xenon (2 x 10¹² kg). The mass of Radon is roughly a million times less than that of Xenon. Therefore, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas when measured as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
