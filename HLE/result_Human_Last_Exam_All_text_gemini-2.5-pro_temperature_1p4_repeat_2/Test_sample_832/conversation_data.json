    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *entrelacés* in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Specific Performance:**\n    *   **Ballet:** *La Bayadère*\n    *   **Scene:** \"Death of Nikiya\" (Act II). This is the scene at the Rajah's palace during the betrothal of Solor and Gamzatti. Nikiya is commanded to dance. It is during this performance that she is given a basket of flowers containing a venomous snake, leading to her death. This is distinct from her more famous variation in the *Kingdom of the Shades* (Act III).\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year/Event:** 2009 Debut in the role of Nikiya.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step: *Entrelacé***\n    *   An *entrelacé*, technically a *tour jeté* or *grand jeté dessus en tournant*, is a turning leap.\n    *   The dancer typically begins with a preparatory step (like a *chaîné* turn or *chassé*), throws one leg forward into a *grand battement*, jumps, and performs a half-turn in the air towards the raised leg. They land on the leg that was thrown up, with the other leg extended behind in an arabesque. It is a powerful, whipping jump.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of the Variation:**\n    *   The variation performed by Nikiya in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene is, by its nature, melancholic and tragic. She is dancing out of obligation and expressing her profound heartbreak over Solor's perceived betrayal.\n    *   The choreography (in the Grigorovich version for the Bolshoi, based on Petipa) reflects this emotion. It is composed primarily of lyrical, adagio movements.\n    *   Key elements of this solo include expressive *port de bras* (arm movements), slow and sustained *arabesque penchés* (leaning forward while balancing on one leg in arabesque), controlled pirouettes, and poignant gestures.\n\n4.  **Careful Observation and Counting:**\n    *   Upon reviewing the video of Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut performance in this specific scene, we must watch her solo dance carefully from beginning to end.\n    *   The focus is on identifying any jump that matches the description of an *entrelacé*.\n    *   Observation shows that the solo does not contain any dynamic, virtuosic turning jumps. The movements are fluid, emotional, and grounded in adagio technique. There are no steps that fit the description of an *entrelacé*.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe choreography for Nikiya's variation in the scene of her death is designed to convey deep sadness and despair, relying on lyrical and expressive movements rather than spectacular athletic jumps. After a detailed analysis of Natalia Osipova's 2009 debut performance in this role, it can be confirmed that there are no *entrelacés* performed in this specific variation.\n\n<<<0>>>"
