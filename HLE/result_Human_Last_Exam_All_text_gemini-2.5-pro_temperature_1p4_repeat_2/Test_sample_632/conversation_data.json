    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Key Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature\".\n*   **Action:** It was removed.\n*   **Date of Removal:** 1950.\n*   **Agent of Removal:** The city administration.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Research & Identification of Potential Features**\nA search into the history of modifications to the Pantheon and its surrounding piazza reveals several significant changes over the centuries. The most notable architectural features that have been removed are:\n1.  **Medieval buildings and shops:** These were clustered against the Pantheon's walls and were cleared away in the late 19th century (mostly 1870s-1880s) to create the open piazza we see today. This does not match the 1950 date.\n2.  **Twin Bell Towers:** Two bell towers were added to the front of the Pantheon in the 17th century, often attributed to the famed Baroque architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. They were highly unpopular with the Romans, who gave them the derogatory nickname \"le orecchie d'asino\" (the ass's ears). This perfectly fits the description of a \"unique architectural feature\".\n3.  **Tram Tracks:** Tram lines once ran through the piazza, but most were removed from Rome's historic center by the 1930s as part of Mussolini's urban renewal projects. This does not match the 1950 date.\n4.  **Ornate Railing:** An elaborate cast-iron railing was installed around the central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon) in the late 19th century. Such features were removed from many piazzas in the mid-20th century to improve traffic flow and open up the space.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the \"Twin Bell Towers\" Candidate**\n*   **Description Match:** This perfectly matches the \"unique architectural feature\". They were a very distinct, non-original addition to the classical facade.\n*   **Removal:** They were indeed removed by official administrative decision to \"restore\" the Pantheon's original look.\n*   **Date Match:** This is the critical point of conflict. Historical records are clear that the bell towers were demolished between 1883 and 1893, not in 1950.\n\n**Step 4: Re-evaluate the Premise of the Question**\nThe question provides a very specific date (1950). However, historical trivia questions can sometimes contain inaccuracies, especially with dates. No major, unique architectural feature matches the 1950 removal date. The twin bell towers, however, are an exact match for the *description* of the feature. They are the most famous and architecturally significant element ever removed from the Pantheon.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the evidence**\nGiven the options, the question is almost certainly referring to the twin bell towers. The specific date of 1950 in the prompt is likely an error. The identity of the feature as the \"ass's ears\" is a much more prominent and specific piece of historical information than the exact year of some other minor alteration like the removal of a fence.\n\n**Final Answer Formulation**\nThe unique architectural feature was the pair of twin bell towers added to the front of the Pantheon in the 17th century. Although they were actually removed in the late 19th century (c. 1883), they are the most famous feature fitting this description.\n\n<<<The twin bell towers, often nicknamed \"the ass's ears\" (le orecchie d'asino).>>>"
