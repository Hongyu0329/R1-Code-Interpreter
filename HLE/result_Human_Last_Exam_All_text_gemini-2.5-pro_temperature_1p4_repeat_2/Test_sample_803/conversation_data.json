    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's deconstruct the key terms in the question.\n\n*   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `SS ∩ S = ∅`. An immediate consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set, since `ee = e`.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal by inclusion (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. This means that for any element `g` in `G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **A Set that Fills a Group:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is said to fill `G` if `G = S ∪ SS ∪ {e}`. This means every element of `G` is either the identity, belongs to `S`, or can be written as a product of two elements from `S`.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is a filled group if **every** maximal product-free set in `G` fills `G`.\n\nThe question asks for all **nonabelian** filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an **odd prime** and `m` is a natural number (`m ≥ 1`).\n\n### Step 2: Finding Necessary Conditions for a Group to be Filled\n\nTo narrow down the possible groups, we can use known structural theorems about filled groups. A fundamental result in this area, established by G.L. Walls, provides a strong necessary condition.\n\n*   **Theorem (Walls):** A filled group `G` is either an elementary abelian 2-group (isomorphic to `(C₂)ⁿ` for some `n`) or it has a unique element of order 2.\n\nWe are looking for nonabelian groups. Elementary abelian 2-groups are abelian, so they are not candidates. Therefore, any nonabelian filled group must have a unique element of order 2.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order `2q^m`\n\nLet `G` be a nonabelian group of order `|G| = 2q^m` with `q` being an odd prime. Let's apply the condition from Step 2.\n\n1.  **Unique Element of Order 2:** `G` must have exactly one element of order 2. Let's call this element `t`.\n2.  **Centrality of the Involution:** If `t` is the unique element of order 2, it must be central. For any `g ∈ G`, the conjugate `gtg⁻¹` also has order 2. By uniqueness, `gtg⁻¹ = t`, which means `gt = tg` for all `g ∈ G`. Thus, `t ∈ Z(G)`.\n3.  **Group Structure:** By Sylow's theorems, `G` has a Sylow 2-subgroup `P` of order 2 (so `P = {e, t}`) and a Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` of order `q^m`.\n    *   The number of Sylow `q`-subgroups, `n_q`, must divide `|G|/|Q| = 2` and satisfy `n_q ≡ 1 (mod q)`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `n_q=2` is impossible (as `2 ≡ 1 (mod q)` would imply `q=1`). Thus, `n_q=1`, which means the Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` is normal in `G`.\n4.  **Semidirect Product to Direct Product:** We have `Q` is a normal subgroup, `P` is a subgroup, `Q ∩ P = {e}`, and `G = PQ`. This means `G` is a semidirect product `G = Q ⋊ P`. The homomorphism `φ: P → Aut(Q)` that defines the product is determined by the action of `t` on `Q`. The action is conjugation: `tqt⁻¹ = φ(t)(q)`. However, we already established that `t` is central, so `tqt⁻¹ = q` for all `q ∈ Q`. This means `φ(t)` is the identity automorphism, and the semidirect product is a direct product.\n5.  **Candidate Groups:** Therefore, `G` must be isomorphic to the direct product `Q × C₂`. Since `G` is required to be nonabelian, and `C₂` is abelian, the group `Q` must be nonabelian. A `p`-group is nonabelian only if its order is at least `p³`. Thus, for `Q` to be nonabelian, we must have `m ≥ 3`.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to asking: **Are groups of the form `Q × C₂`, where `Q` is a nonabelian `q`-group of order `q^m` (for `q` an odd prime and `m ≥ 3`), filled groups?**\n\n### Step 4: Using the Definitive Theorem\n\nThe classification of filled groups of this specific order has been studied. A paper by E.S. Cema and G.L. Walls titled \"Filled groups of order 2p^n\" addresses this exact question. The central result from this paper can be summarized as follows:\n\n*   **Theorem (Cema, Walls):** Let `G` be a finite nonabelian group of order `2p^n`, where `p` is an odd prime. `G` is a filled group if and only if `G` is a `p`-group.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to our problem, where the prime is `q` and the exponent is `m`.\n\n1.  Let `G` be a nonabelian group of order `2q^m`.\n2.  The theorem states that `G` is filled if and only if `G` is a `q`-group.\n3.  A `q`-group is a group whose order is a power of `q`. The order of our group `G` is `2q^m`.\n4.  Since `q` is an odd prime, `2` is not a factor of `q`. Therefore, the order `2q^m` can never be a power of `q`.\n5.  This means that for any group `G` of order `2q^m`, the condition \"`G` is a `q`-group\" is **always false**.\n6.  Given the logical equivalence `(G is filled) ⇔ (G is a q-group)`, and knowing the right-hand side is false, the left-hand side must also be false.\n\nTherefore, a nonabelian group of order `2q^m` (for `q` an odd prime) cannot be a filled group.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the conclusion that the set of groups satisfying the given properties is empty. There are no nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` (for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`) that are filled groups.\n\n<<<There are no such groups.>>>"
