    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle transformation rules.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Input_A and Output_A\n\n*   **Input_A:** `'001111,121111,111111'`\n    Grid A:\n    `0 0 1 1 1 1`\n    `1 2 1 1 1 1`\n    `1 1 1 1 1 1`\n*   **Output_A:** `'201111,101111,111111'`\n    Grid A':\n    `2 0 1 1 1 1`\n    `1 0 1 1 1 1`\n    `1 1 1 1 1 1`\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  The '2' at position (row=1, col=1) has moved.\n2.  The original position of the '2' at (1,1) has become '0'.\n3.  A '0' at position (0,0) has become '2'.\n4.  The '2' seems to move to an empty space ('0').\n5.  The movement is not to the immediately adjacent '0' at (0,1) but to the one at (0,0). This suggests a more complex rule than just moving to the nearest empty neighbor.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Input_B and Output_B\n\n*   **Input_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'`\n    Grid B: (showing relevant part)\n    Row 2: `...0 0 0 0 1...`\n    Row 3: `...0 0 2 1 1...`\n    The '2' is at (3,6).\n*   **Output_B:** `'0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'`\n    Grid B': (showing relevant part)\n    Row 2: `...0 0 0 2 1...`\n    Row 3: `...0 0 0 1 1...`\n\n**Observations:**\n1.  The '2' at position (3,6) has moved.\n2.  The original position (3,6) has become '0'.\n3.  A '0' at position (2,7) has become '2'.\n\n### Step 3: Formulate and Refine the Transformation Rule\n\nLet's try to find a rule that explains both A and B.\n\nA common pattern is that the '2' moves up one row, into a cell that was '0'. Let's call this the \"jump up\" move.\n\n*   In A, the '2' at (1,1) jumps up to (0,1) (which is a '0').\n*   In B, the '2' at (3,6) jumps up to (2,6) (which is a '0').\n\nAfter jumping up, where does the '2' end up?\n\n*   In A, after jumping to (0,1), it ends up at (0,0). The cell at (0,0) was '0'. It seems to have \"slid\" left from (0,1) to (0,0).\n*   In B, after jumping to (2,6), it ends up at (2,7). The cell at (2,7) was '0'. It seems to have \"slid\" right from (2,6) to (2,7).\n\nWhy did A slide left and B slide right? Let's look for a deciding factor.\n*   In A, the '2' was originally in column 1. The number 1 is **odd**. It slid **left**.\n*   In B, the '2' was originally in column 6. The number 6 is **even**. It slid **right**.\n\nThis gives us a consistent rule.\n\n**The Final Rule:**\n1.  Find any '2' in the grid at position (row `r`, column `c`).\n2.  Check if the '2' can \"jump up\": The cell directly above it at (`r-1`, `c`) must exist (i.e., `r > 0`) and must contain a '0'.\n3.  If it can jump up:\n    a. The '2' moves to (`r-1`, `c`), and its original location (`r`, `c`) becomes a '0'.\n    b. Based on the **original** column `c`:\n        *   If `c` is **odd**, the '2' then slides **left** as far as it can through adjacent '0's in its new row.\n        *   If `c` is **even**, the '2' then slides **right** as far as it can through adjacent '0's in its new row.\n4.  If the '2' cannot jump up (either it's in the top row or the cell above is not '0'), it does not move.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Rule to Input_C\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n    Grid C:\n    Row 0: `0 0 0 0 0 0`\n    Row 1: `0 1 1 1 2 0`\n    Row 2: `1 1 1 1 1 1`\n\n1.  A '2' is found at position (r=1, c=4).\n2.  The original column is `c=4`, which is **even**. The '2' will try to slide **right**.\n3.  Check the cell above: (`0`, `4`). Its value is '0'. The '2' can jump up.\n4.  **Jump Up:** The '2' moves from (1,4) to (0,4). The cell (1,4) becomes '0'.\n    Intermediate Grid:\n    Row 0: `0 0 0 0 2 0`\n    Row 1: `0 1 1 1 0 0`\n    Row 2: `1 1 1 1 1 1`\n5.  **Slide Right:** The '2' is now at (0,4). We check the cell to its right, (0,5). Its value is '0'. The '2' slides right.\n    The '2' moves from (0,4) to (0,5). The cell (0,4) becomes '0'.\n    Grid after sliding:\n    Row 0: `0 0 0 0 0 2`\n    Row 1: `0 1 1 1 0 0`\n    Row 2: `1 1 1 1 1 1`\n6.  The '2' is now at (0,5). The cell to its right is the grid boundary, so it cannot slide further.\n7.  The transformation is complete.\n\nThe final grid state is:\nRow 0: `000002`\nRow 1: `011100`\nRow 2: `111111`\n\nConverting this back to the output string format gives: `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
