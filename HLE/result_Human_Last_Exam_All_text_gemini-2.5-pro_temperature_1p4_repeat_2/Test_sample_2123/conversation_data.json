    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Source Text:** A Russian translation of an essay (or, as is common in such riddles, an essay originally written in Russian).\n    *   **Subject:** A description of the wide boulevards of Vienna (e.g., the Ringstrasse).\n    *   **Key Element:** The surname of an English poet is mentioned in this description.\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this surname in English.\n\n2.  **Identify Careful Points and Potential Traps:**\n    *   The phrase \"In the Russian translation\" might be slightly misleading. The original work could be by a Russian author, making a \"translation\" unnecessary. This is a common feature in trivia questions to make them broader.\n    *   The connection is likely not a straightforward comparison but rather a pun or a clever wordplay, which is typical for literary riddles. We need to find a Russian word associated with Viennese boulevards that sounds like the name of an English poet.\n    *   The setting, \"wide boulevards of Vienna,\" points towards the famous Ringstrasse, known for its grand, ornate, and imposing architecture.\n\n3.  **Explore Potential Connections (Hypotheses):**\n    *   **Hypothesis A (The Brodsky/Keats connection):** The Russian poet Joseph Brodsky wrote about Vienna's boulevards, which he called \"prospects.\" In other essays, he contrasts the straight \"prospects\" with the convoluted nature of English life and mentions the poet John Keats as an epitome of Englishness. However, the link is indirect; Keats isn't mentioned *while* describing Vienna's boulevards in the same passage.\n    *   **Hypothesis B (The Kitsch/Keats connection):** Viennese architecture is sometimes described as \"kitsch.\" The Russian word for kitsch, \"китч\" (kitch), sounds very similar to \"Keats\" (\"Китс\" - Kits). An author could have made this pun. While plausible, finding a specific text to confirm this is difficult.\n    *   **Hypothesis C (The Bitov/Pope connection):** This is the most likely and verifiable answer. The source is an essay by the Russian writer Andrei Bitov.\n\n4.  **Detailed Analysis of the Correct Path (Hypothesis C):**\n    *   **The Author and Work:** The reference comes from the Russian writer Andrei Bitov in one of his travelogue essays.\n    *   **The Context:** Bitov is describing the architecture along the boulevards of Vienna (the Ringstrasse). He is struck by the opulence and the sheer number of decorative statues on the facades of the buildings.\n    *   **The Observation:** Among these sculptures are many chubby figures, like cherubs or putti.\n    *   **The Pun:** Bitov makes a pun based on their appearance. He refers to these chubby, round figures as \"попы\" (popy). In Russian, \"поп\" (pop, plural \"попы\") is a colloquial, sometimes slightly derogatory, term for an Orthodox priest. The pun plays on the stereotypical image of a portly priest.\n    *   **The Literary Reference:** Immediately after using the word \"попы\" (popy), Bitov clarifies his wordplay by explicitly referencing the English poet Alexander Pope. The line is famously recalled as, \"...not priests (*popy*), but the English poet Pope.\"\n    *   **The Link:** The Russian word \"поп\" (pop) is phonetically almost identical to the English surname \"Pope.\" This creates a direct and witty link between a visual feature of the Viennese boulevards and the poet's name.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe essay in question is by the Russian writer Andrei Bitov. When describing the ornate buildings on Vienna's boulevards, he notes the many cherubic statues. He humorously calls them \"попы\" (popy), a Russian word for priests, and then immediately makes the connection to the similar-sounding name of the English poet, Alexander Pope.\n\n<<<Pope>>>"
