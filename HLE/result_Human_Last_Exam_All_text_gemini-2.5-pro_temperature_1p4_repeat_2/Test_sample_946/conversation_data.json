    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific fictional character from a specific episode of an online cartoon.\n*   **Cartoon Series:** \"Homestar Runner\"\n*   **Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"\n*   **Event:** Junior prom\n*   **Item:** A cardboard cutout\n*   **Character Type:** Fictional singer\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the events of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode focuses on the Teen Girl Squad attending their Junior prom. A key part of the prom is the musical entertainment.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the scene involving the entertainment at the Junior prom.**\n*   The girls, particularly Cheerleader, express excitement about the \"live entertainment\".\n*   The scene then reveals that the entertainment is not a live performer, but a cardboard cutout on the stage.\n*   The character \"What's Her Face\" points this out, saying, \"I'm pretty sure that's a cardboard cutout of Fictional Keri.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identify the name on the cardboard cutout.**\nBased on the dialogue from What's Her Face, the name of the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout is \"Fictional Keri\".\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Specificity of the Episode:** The answer must come from \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" and no other episode.\n*   **Fictional Character:** The question is about a *fictional* singer within the cartoon's universe, not a real-world celebrity. The name \"Fictional Keri\" explicitly fits this description.\n*   **Form of the Performer:** It is crucial to note that it is a cardboard cutout, as the question specifies. The disappointment of the characters confirms this detail.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the specific scene at the Junior prom in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", we can determine from the dialogue that the cardboard cutout is of a fictional singer named Fictional Keri.\n\n<<<Fictional Keri>>>"
