    "This problem asks for the conditions that guarantee the existence of a specific type of fixed point, which we will call an \"FGH-tripled fixed point,\" for three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` with specific domains and codomains. The solution involves defining this fixed point and then applying the Banach Contraction Principle on a suitable product space.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### 1. Careful Points and Initial Setup\n\nBefore proceeding, we must address some key points and assumptions:\n*   **Typo Correction:** The question lists `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y`, and `G:Z*Y*X→Z`. Based on the term \"FGH-tripled fixed point\", it is highly probable that the third function is `H`, not `G`. We will proceed with the assumption that the functions are:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n*   **Metric Spaces:** The concept of a fixed point guaranteed by contraction mapping requires a notion of distance. Therefore, we assume that `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are metric spaces.\n*   **Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point:** This term is not standard. We must define it based on the function definitions. A fixed point `(x, y, z)` from the product space `X × Y × Z` must satisfy a system of equations where the output of each function is equal to its corresponding input component.\n*   **Framework:** The conditions for the existence of such a point are derived from the **Banach Contraction Principle**, which states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space has a unique fixed point.\n\n#### 2. Defining the FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triple `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\nThe arguments for `G` and `H` are chosen to be consistent with the variables `x, y, z` from the triple.\n\n#### 3. Reframing as a Single Fixed Point Problem\n\nWe can combine these three equations into a single fixed point problem. Let's define a product space `W = X × Y × Z` and an operator `T: W → W`.\n\n*   **Product Space and Metric:** The product space is `W = X × Y × Z`. We equip it with the sum metric:\n    `d_W((x₁,y₁,z₁), (x₂,y₂,z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n*   **Operator T:** We define the operator `T: W → W` as:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n\nA fixed point of this operator is a point `w = (x, y, z)` such that `T(w) = w`, which is equivalent to `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`. This is precisely the system of equations defining the FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n#### 4. Applying the Banach Contraction Principle\n\nThe Banach Contraction Principle gives us the conditions for `T` to have a unique fixed point. These are the conditions the question asks for.\n\n**Theorem Statement:** If `(W, d_W)` is a **complete metric space** and `T: W → W` is a **contraction mapping**, then `T` has a unique fixed point in `W`.\n\nThis theorem directly translates into two main conditions on our spaces and functions.\n\n#### 5. Deriving the Conditions\n\n**Condition 1: Completeness of the Space**\nThe product space `(W, d_W)` is complete if and only if each of the component spaces is complete.\n*   **Condition on Spaces:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**Condition 2: Contraction Mapping**\nThe operator `T` must be a contraction. This means there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d_W(w₁, w₂)`\n\nLet's expand this inequality to find conditions on `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n`d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁,x₂) + d_Y(y₁,y₂) + d_Z(z₁,z₂))`\n\nA sufficient way to satisfy this is to impose Lipschitz-like conditions on each function `F`, `G`, and `H`. Assume there exist non-negative constants `αᵢ, βᵢ, γᵢ` such that:\n\na) `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\nb) `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\nc) `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nSumming these inequalities gives:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (α₁+β₁+γ₁)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (α₂+β₂+γ₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (α₃+γ₃)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nLet `C_x = α₁+β₁+γ₁`, `C_y = α₂+β₂+γ₂`, and `C_z = α₃+γ₃`. The inequality becomes:\n`d_W(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ C_x d_X + C_y d_Y + C_z d_Z`\n\nFor this to be a contraction, we need `C_x d_X + C_y d_Y + C_z d_Z ≤ k(d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k<1`. This is guaranteed if we let `k = max(C_x, C_y, C_z)` and require `k < 1`.\n*   **Condition on Functions:** The contraction conditions are the inequalities (a), (b), (c) above, combined with the condition on the coefficients:\n    `max( (α₁+β₁+γ₁), (α₂+β₂+γ₂), (α₃+γ₃) ) < 1`\nThis is equivalent to requiring:\nd) `α₁ + β₁ + γ₁ < 1`\ne) `α₂ + β₂ + γ₂ < 1`\nf) `α₃ + γ₃ < 1`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe conditions for the functions `F:X*Y*Z→X`, `G:Y*X*Y→Y` and `H:Z*Y*X→Z` to have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point are as follows:\n\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be complete metric spaces. The functions have a unique FGH-tripled fixed point if there exist non-negative constants `α₁, α₂, α₃`, `β₁, β₂`, and `γ₁, γ₂, γ₃` such that for all `x₁, x₂ ∈ X`, `y₁, y₂ ∈ Y`, and `z₁, z₂ ∈ Z`, the following conditions are met:\n\n1.  **Lipschitz-type conditions on the functions:**\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁ d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n2.  **Contraction condition on the constants:**\n    *   `α₁ + β₁ + γ₁ < 1`\n    *   `α₂ + β₂ + γ₂ < 1`\n    *   `α₃ + γ₃ < 1`\n\nIf these conditions hold, there exists a unique triple `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` such that `F(x, y, z) = x`, `G(y, x, y) = y`, and `H(z, y, x) = z`.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) is a solution to the system F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are based on the Banach Contraction Principle. The primary conditions are:\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Function Requirement (Contraction):** The functions F, G, and H must collectively form a contraction mapping on the product space X × Y × Z. A sufficient set of conditions for this is that there exist non-negative constants (α₁, α₂, α₃, β₁, β₂, γ₁, γ₂, γ₃) such that for all points:\n    a) d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)\n    b) d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂d_Y(y₁, y₂)\n    c) d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)\nAnd the constants must satisfy:\n    d) α₁ + β₁ + γ₁ < 1\n    e) α₂ + β₂ + γ₂ < 1\n    f) α₃ + γ₃ < 1>>>"
