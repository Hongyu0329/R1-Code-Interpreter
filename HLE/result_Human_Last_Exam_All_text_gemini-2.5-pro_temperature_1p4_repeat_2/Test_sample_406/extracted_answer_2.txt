An FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z) is a solution to the system F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z. The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such a point are based on the Banach Contraction Principle. The primary conditions are:
1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces.
2.  **Function Requirement (Contraction):** The functions F, G, and H must collectively form a contraction mapping on the product space X × Y × Z. A sufficient set of conditions for this is that there exist non-negative constants (α₁, α₂, α₃, β₁, β₂, γ₁, γ₂, γ₃) such that for all points:
    a) d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + α₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + α₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)
    b) d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ β₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + β₂d_Y(y₁, y₂)
    c) d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ γ₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + γ₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)
And the constants must satisfy:
    d) α₁ + β₁ + γ₁ < 1
    e) α₂ + β₂ + γ₂ < 1
    f) α₃ + γ₃ < 1
