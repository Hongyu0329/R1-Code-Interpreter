    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene to determine the product.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1:** Butadiene, specifically 1,3-butadiene. Its chemical structure is CH₂=CH-CH=CH₂. It is a conjugated diene.\n    *   **Reactant 2:** 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. Its chemical structure is CCl₂=CF₂. It is a substituted alkene.\n\n2.  **Identify the Reaction Type:**\n    *   The reaction involves a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene) and an alkene (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene), which can act as a dienophile.\n    *   This is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**. The Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, where the 4 π-electrons from the diene and the 2 π-electrons from the dienophile combine to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n3.  **Predict the Product's Basic Structure:**\n    *   The reaction will form a six-membered ring.\n    *   The C1 and C4 atoms of butadiene form new single (sigma) bonds with the two carbon atoms of the dienophile.\n    *   The double bonds at C1-C2 and C3-C4 of butadiene are consumed.\n    *   A new double (pi) bond is formed between the C2 and C3 atoms of butadiene.\n    *   The double bond of the dienophile is converted into a single bond.\n    *   The resulting cyclic structure is a derivative of cyclohexene.\n\n4.  **Consider Regiochemistry:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The dienophile, CCl₂=CF₂, is unsymmetrical because one carbon atom is bonded to two chlorine atoms and the other to two fluorine atoms. The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical.\n    *   In a Diels-Alder reaction, an unsymmetrical dienophile can potentially react with a symmetrical diene to form only one constitutional isomer (regioisomer). This is because the two ends of the diene (C1 and C4) are chemically equivalent.\n    *   Whether the CCl₂ group of the dienophile bonds to the C1 or C4 side of the butadiene, the resulting constitutional isomer is the same. Flipping the dienophile before the reaction leads to the same product because of the diene's symmetry. Thus, only one product is formed.\n\n5.  **Draw the Final Product Structure:**\n    *   Based on the analysis, the product is a cyclohexene ring.\n    *   Two adjacent carbon atoms in the ring (from the original dienophile) bear the halogen substituents: one carbon has two Cl atoms (CCl₂), and the adjacent carbon has two F atoms (CF₂).\n    *   The other four carbons (from butadiene) form the rest of the ring, including the double bond.\n    *   The structure is:\n        ```\n              HC = CH\n             /      \\\n           H2C        CH2\n            \\        /\n             C(Cl)2 -- C(F)2\n        ```\n\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name of the Product:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** Naming requires careful application of IUPAC rules for cyclic compounds.\n    *   **Parent Ring:** The six-membered ring with one double bond is a **cyclohexene**.\n    *   **Numbering:** The carbons of the double bond must be numbered 1 and 2. We must then number around the ring in the direction that gives the substituents the lowest possible locants (positions).\n        *   Path A: Numbering so the CCl₂ group is further from the double bond than the CF₂ group. Locants for substituents: 4,4 (for F) and 5,5 (for Cl).\n        *   Path B: Numbering so the CCl₂ group is closer to the double bond than the CF₂ group. Locants for substituents: 4,4 (for Cl) and 5,5 (for F).\n    *   Both paths result in the same set of locants: {4, 4, 5, 5}.\n    *   **Tie-Breaker Rule:** When numbering results in the same locant set, we assign the lower number to the substituent that comes first alphabetically.\n    *   The substituents are \"dichloro\" and \"difluoro\". Alphabetically, \"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    *   Therefore, the CCl₂ group must be assigned the lower locant, which is position 4. The CF₂ group is at position 5.\n    *   The full, correct IUPAC name is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**. (The \"-1-\" is often omitted when there is no ambiguity, so \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene\" is also acceptable).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
