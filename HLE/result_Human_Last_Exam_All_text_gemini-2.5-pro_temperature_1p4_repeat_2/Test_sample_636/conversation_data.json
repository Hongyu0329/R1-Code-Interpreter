    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a 2x2 state feedback gain matrix `F` for a linear time-invariant system defined by matrices `A` and `B`. The control law is applied such that the closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. The goal is to place the eigenvalues of `A_cl` at the specified locations `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Given Information**\n\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n*   Desired eigenvalues (poles): `p1 = -1 + j`, `p2 = -1 - j`\n*   State feedback gain matrix (to be found): `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe characteristic polynomial is formed from the desired eigenvalues.\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - p1)(λ - p2)`\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_desired(λ) = ((λ + 1) - j)((λ + 1) + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`P_desired(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A + BF`**\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n`BF = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]]`\n`BF = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, form the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A + BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial for a 2x2 matrix `M = [[a, b], [c, d]]` is `λ^2 - tr(M)λ + det(M)`.\nLet's find the trace and determinant of `A_cl`.\n*   **Trace of A_cl:**\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1`\n*   **Determinant of A_cl:**\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f2 + 2*f4 + f1 + f1*f2 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 1 - f2 - 2*f4 - f1 - f1*f2 - 2*f1*f4`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 - 2*f4 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial `P_cl(λ)` is:\n`P_cl(λ) = λ^2 - (f1 + f2 + 2*f3 - 1)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 - 2*f4 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f1*f4)`\n`P_cl(λ) = λ^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)λ + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 - 2*f4 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**Step 4: Equate the Coefficients of the Polynomials**\nMatch the coefficients of `P_cl(λ)` with `P_desired(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n*   **Comparing coefficients of the `λ` term:**\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n*   **Comparing coefficients of the constant term:**\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 - 2*f4 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2*f2 + 2*f4 - 2*f2*f3 + 2*f1*f4 = -3` (Equation 2)\n\n**Step 5: Solve the System of Equations for F**\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that there are infinite solutions for the matrix `F`. We can find one specific solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\nA straightforward assumption is to set the second row of `F` to zero, which means we set `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This is equivalent to only using the first control input (`u1`) and setting the second (`u2`) to zero.\nWith `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`, the equations become:\n*   Equation 1: `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1`  => `f1 + f2 = -1`\n*   Equation 2: `f1 + 2*f2 + 2(0) - 2*f2(0) + 2*f1(0) = -3` => `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `f1 + 2*f2 = -3`\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2*f2) - (f1 + f2) = -3 - (-1)`\n`f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1`\n`f1 = 1`\n\nSo, a valid set of values is `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\nThe resulting state feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Notation**: The problem specifies the closed-loop system as `A + BF`. It's important to use this exact form, as it's different from the more conventional `A - BF`.\n*   **Non-uniqueness**: For multi-input systems, the pole placement problem often has an infinite number of solutions. Our method of setting two variables to zero is a valid way to find one of these solutions.\n*   **Verification**: We can check our answer.\n    *   `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n    *   `A_cl = A + BF = [[-1 + 1 + 0, 1 + (-2) + 0], [1 + 1, -2]] = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n    *   The characteristic polynomial of this `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl) = det([[λ, 1], [-2, λ+2]]) = λ(λ+2) - (1)(-2) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n    *   The roots of `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0` are `λ = (-2 ± sqrt(4-8))/2 = -1 ± j`.\n    *   This matches the desired eigenvalues, so our solution for `F` is correct.\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
