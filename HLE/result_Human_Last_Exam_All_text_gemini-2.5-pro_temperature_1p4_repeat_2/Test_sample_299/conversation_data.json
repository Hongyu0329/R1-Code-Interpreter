    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Analyze the function properties**\n\nLet $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. We want to find the cardinality of $S$, denoted by $|S|$.\n\n*   **Injectivity of f:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$.\n    From the given equation, this means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$.\n    Since the exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$.\n    Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n\n*   **Monotonicity of f:**\n    A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. This is a standard result from real analysis.\n    Thus, any solution $f$ must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n**2. Case 1: f is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's investigate if a strictly decreasing solution can exist.\n\n*   A key identity: From $f(f(x)) = e^x$, we can apply $f$ to both sides:\n    $f(f(f(x))) = f(e^x)$.\n    Also, we can substitute $f(x)$ into the original equation:\n    $f(f(f(x))) = e^{f(x)}$.\n    Combining these two, we get the relation: $f(e^x) = e^{f(x)}$. This relation must be satisfied by any solution $f$.\n\n*   Let's check the consequence of this relation for a decreasing function.\n    Since the domain of $f$ is $\\mathbb{R}$, we can evaluate the relation at $x=0$:\n    $f(e^0) = e^{f(0)}$, which simplifies to $f(1) = e^{f(0)}$.\n\n*   Now, we use the property that $f$ is strictly decreasing. Since $1 > 0$, we must have $f(1) < f(0)$.\n    Let $c = f(0)$. Then the condition becomes $f(1) < c$.\n    From the relation we derived, $f(1) = e^c$.\n    So we must have $e^c < c$.\n\n*   Let's analyze the inequality $e^c < c$. This is equivalent to $c - e^c > 0$.\n    Consider the function $g(c) = c - e^c$. Its derivative is $g'(c) = 1 - e^c$.\n    The derivative is zero when $e^c = 1$, i.e., $c=0$.\n    The second derivative is $g''(c) = -e^c$, which is always negative. So $c=0$ is a global maximum for $g(c)$.\n    The maximum value is $g(0) = 0 - e^0 = -1$.\n    Since the maximum value of $c - e^c$ is $-1$, we have $c - e^c \\le -1$ for all real numbers $c$.\n    This means the inequality $c - e^c > 0$ (or $e^c < c$) has no real solutions.\n\n*   This is a contradiction. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous function $f$ can satisfy the given equation.\n\n**3. Case 2: f is strictly increasing**\n\nNow we only need to consider strictly increasing solutions.\n\n*   From $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and the fact that $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $f(f(x)) > x$.\n*   Since $f$ is strictly increasing, it cannot have any fixed points (if $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $f(f(x_0))=x_0$, which would mean $e^{x_0}=x_0$, which has no solution). For a continuous function with no fixed points, it must be either $f(x) > x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) < x$ for all $x$.\n*   If we assume $f(x) < x$, then applying the increasing function $f$ to both sides yields $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these gives $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. But $f(f(x)) = e^x$, so this would mean $e^x < x$, which is false.\n*   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n*   Applying the increasing function $f$ to $f(x) > x$ gives $f(f(x)) > f(x)$.\n*   So we have the relationship $x < f(x) < f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n\n**4. Construction and Cardinality of Increasing Solutions**\n\nThe existence and number of such functions can be determined using the theory of functional equations. The equation $f(f(x)) = g(x)$ is a classic type. For $g(x)=e^x$, where $g(x)>x$ and $g$ is strictly increasing, solutions can be constructed.\n\n*   The standard method involves finding a continuous, strictly increasing function $\\alpha: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, called an Abel function, that satisfies Abel's functional equation: $\\alpha(g(x)) = \\alpha(x) + 1$. For our problem, this is $\\alpha(e^x) = \\alpha(x) + 1$.\n*   If such an $\\alpha$ exists and has a continuous, strictly increasing inverse $\\alpha^{-1}$, then a solution $f$ is given by $f(x) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x) + 1/2)$.\n    Let's check this:\n    $f(f(x)) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(\\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1/2)) + 1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}((\\alpha(x)+1/2) + 1/2) = \\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1) = e^x$. (Since $\\alpha(e^x)=\\alpha(x)+1 \\implies e^x=\\alpha^{-1}(\\alpha(x)+1)$).\n\n*   To construct such a function $\\alpha$, we can define it arbitrarily on an interval of the form $[x_0, e^{x_0})$ and then use the equation $\\alpha(e^x) = \\alpha(x)+1$ to extend its definition to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    Let's choose the interval $[1, e)$.\n    Let $\\phi: [1, e) \\to [0, 1)$ be any continuous, strictly increasing bijective function (a homeomorphism).\n    Any $x \\ge 1$ can be uniquely written as $x = e^n(y)$ for some integer $n \\ge 0$ and $y \\in [1, e)$, where $e^n(y)$ denotes applying the exponential function $n$ times.\n    Similarly, any $x > 0$ can be represented this way. We can extend to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    For any $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, there exists a unique integer $n$ and a unique $y \\in [1,e)$ such that $x = \\ln^n(y)$ (where $\\ln^n$ is composing $\\ln$, $n$ times for $n>0$, the identity for $n=0$, and composing $\\exp$, $|n|$ times for $n<0$).\n    We can define $\\alpha(x) = \\phi(y) - n$.\n    This construction ensures $\\alpha(e^x) = \\alpha(x)+1$. We also need to ensure continuity. The only points of concern are the boundaries $e^n$. By choosing $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(1)=0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to e^-} \\phi(x) = 1$, continuity of $\\alpha$ is guaranteed.\n\n*   The crucial point is that we have freedom in choosing the \"seed\" function $\\phi$. The set of solutions $f$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of possible choices for $\\phi$.\n*   We need to count how many such functions $\\phi: [1, e) \\to [0, 1)$ exist.\n*   The set of continuous functions from an interval to $\\mathbb{R}$ has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}| = 2^{\\aleph_0}$. The subset of these that are strictly increasing homeomorphisms also has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   To see this, we can construct an injective map from $\\mathbb{R}$ to the set of such functions. For each $t \\in (0,1)$, we can define a unique piecewise linear homeomorphism $\\phi_t$ from $[1, e)$ to $[0, 1)$ that passes through the point $((1+e)/2, t)$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $t$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions $\\phi$.\n*   Since the total number of continuous functions on $[1, e)$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, there are at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $\\phi$.\n*   Therefore, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ possible choices for $\\phi$.\n\n*   Each distinct choice of $\\phi$ leads to a distinct function $\\alpha$, which in turn leads to a distinct solution $f$. If $f_1 = f_2$, it can be shown that the corresponding seed functions $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ must be identical.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n*   There are no strictly decreasing solutions.\n*   There are $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) strictly increasing solutions.\n*   Thus, the total number of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = e^x$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such functions is the cardinality of the continuum, which is the same as the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n<<<c>>>"
