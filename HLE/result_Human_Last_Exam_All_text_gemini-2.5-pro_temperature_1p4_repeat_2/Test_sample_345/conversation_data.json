The online collection database of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden provides the following information for the painting (Inventory number: Gal.-Nr. 3535):\n*   **Artist:** Kurt Günther\n*   **Title:** Der Radionist\n*   **Date:** 1927\n*   **Acquisition:** Acquired in 1967\n\nThe painting is part of the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery), which is housed in the Albertinum building and is one of the museums that constitute the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings to answer the question.**\nAll the details from the question align with the records of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden. The museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Language:** The painting's title is often listed in its original German (\"Der Radionist\"). It's important to recognize both the German and English titles.\n*   **Museum Naming:** The institution has a layered structure. The parent organization is the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections). The specific collection holding the painting is the Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery). The building is the Albertinum. Any of these could be considered correct, but the formal acquiring institution is the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden.\n*   **Source Verification:** It is crucial to use a reliable source, such as the museum's own public database, to confirm specific details like the acquisition date. This avoids potential inaccuracies from less reliable sources.\n\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden"
