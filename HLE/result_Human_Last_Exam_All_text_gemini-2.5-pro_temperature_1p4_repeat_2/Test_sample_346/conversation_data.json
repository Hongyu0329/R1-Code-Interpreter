    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the Church integer `n` and then calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\n**The Expression**\n\nThe given SKI combinator expression is:\n`S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))`\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core SKI Combinators**\n\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\n**Step 2: Understand Church Encodings**\n\nChurch numerals represent integers as higher-order functions. A numeral `n` is a function that takes another function `f` and a value `x`, and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times.\n`n f x = f^n(x) = f(f(...f(x)...))`\n\n*   **Church numeral 1:** `1 = λf.λx. f x`. In SKI, `I f x = f x`, so `I` represents 1.\n*   **Church numeral 2:** `2 = λf.λx. f(f x)`. Let's evaluate `S(I)(I) f x`:\n    `S I I f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`.\n    So, the combinator `S(I)(I)` represents the Church numeral 2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Structure of the Expression**\n\nThe expression has a repeated structure of `S(I)`. Let's define a combinator `H = S(I)`.\n`H x y = S I x y = I y (x y) = y (x y)`.\n\nThe expression can be written as `H(H(H X Y))`, where `X` and `Y` are the inner terms. Let's analyze this structure applied to `K A`, where `A` is some term.\n*   Let's see what `H(H(H (K A) Y))` reduces to.\n    1.  Innermost application: `H (K A) Y = Y ( (K A) Y ) = Y A`.\n    2.  Second application: `H (Y A) = Y A ( (K A) (Y A) ) = (Y A) A`.\n    3.  Outermost application: `H ( (Y A) A ) = ( (Y A) A ) ( (K A) ( (Y A) A ) ) = ( (Y A) A ) A`.\n\nSo, the entire expression `E` reduces to `((Y A) A) A`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Components `A` and `Y`**\n\nFrom the main expression, we identify:\n*   `X = K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I))`, so the term `A` is `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`.\n*   `Y = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`.\n\nLet's define the recurring part `P = S(S(K(S))(K))`.\nThen we have `A = P I` and `Y = S P (S(I)(I))`.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Function of Combinator `P`**\n\n*   First, identify `B = S(K S)K`. This is the standard \"Bluebird\" combinator, which performs function composition: `B f g x = f(g x)`.\n*   The combinator `P` is `S(S(K S)K) = S B`.\n*   Let's determine what `P` does when applied to a Church numeral `n`. We evaluate `(P n) f x`, which is `(S B n) f x`.\n    `(S B n) f x = B f (n f) x` (by definition of `S` and `B`).\n    `B f (n f) x = f ( (n f) x )` (by definition of `B`).\n    `(n f) x = f^n(x)` (by definition of Church numeral `n`).\n    So, `f ( f^n(x) ) = f^(n+1)(x)`.\n*   This means that `P n` is the Church numeral for `n+1`. Therefore, `P` is the **Successor function**, `SUCC`. `P = SUCC`.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate `A` and `Y` based on `P = SUCC`**\n\n*   **Evaluating `A`:**\n    `A = P I = SUCC I`.\n    Since `I` represents the numeral 1, `SUCC I` is the successor of 1, which is 2.\n    So, `A` represents the Church numeral **2**.\n\n*   **Evaluating `Y`:**\n    `Y = S P (S(I)(I)) = S SUCC 2`.\n    `Y` is a combinator. To find out what it represents, we can apply it to a generic Church numeral `m`.\n    `Y m = (S SUCC 2) m = SUCC m (2 m)`.\n\n*   **Church Numeral Application:** The application of one Church numeral `m` to another `n`, written `m n`, results in the Church numeral for `n^m`.\n\n    Using this rule:\n    *   `SUCC m` is the numeral `m+1`.\n    *   `2 m` is the numeral `m^2`.\n    *   `Y m = (m+1)(m^2)` becomes the numeral `(m^2)^(m+1)`.\n    So, `Y` is the function `λm. (m^2)^(m+1)`.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Value `n`**\n\nThe full expression reduces to `E = ((Y A) A) A`.\nWe found `A = 2` and `Y = λm. (m^2)^(m+1)`.\n\n1.  **Calculate `(Y A)` which is `Y 2`:**\n    `Y 2 = (2^2)^(2+1) = 4^3 = 64`.\n    So the first part of the expression, `(Y A)`, evaluates to the Church numeral 64.\n\n2.  **Calculate `((Y A) A)` which is `64 2`:**\n    Using the exponentiation rule, `64 2` becomes `2^64`.\n\n3.  **Calculate `(((Y A) A) A)` which is `(2^64) 2`:**\n    Again, using the rule, this becomes `2^(2^64)`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` that the expression represents is `2^(2^64)`.\n\n**Step 8: Calculate `log_2(n)`**\n\nThe question asks for the base-2 logarithm of `n`.\n`n = 2^(2^64)`\n`log_2(n) = log_2(2^(2^64))`\n`log_2(n) = 2^64`\n\nThe final answer is `2^64`.\n\n<<<2^64>>>"
