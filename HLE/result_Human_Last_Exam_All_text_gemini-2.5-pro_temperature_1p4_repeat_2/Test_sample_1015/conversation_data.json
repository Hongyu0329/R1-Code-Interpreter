    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   \"Cambré\" is a French ballet term meaning \"arched.\" It refers to a bend of the body from the waist.\n    *   \"Derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n    *   Therefore, a \"cambré derrière\" is a backward bend of the upper body from the waist.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach**\n    *   **Origin:** Developed by Agrippina Vaganova in Russia, this method is known for its precision, strength, and logical progression.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The Vaganova method places a strong emphasis on stability and correct alignment. When performing a cambré derrière, the dancer must keep their hips square and directly over their supporting leg(s). The bend initiates from the upper back, creating a graceful curve while the lower back remains supported and the pelvis is stable. The idea is to lengthen the spine upwards and then arch back, maintaining a strong core and preventing the lower back from collapsing or the hips from shifting forward.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach**\n    *   **Origin:** Developed by choreographer George Balanchine in America, this style is characterized by its speed, musicality, and dynamic, often extreme lines.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The Balanchine method often exaggerates classical lines for choreographic effect. In a cambré derrière, a key stylistic difference is the use of the hips. Dancers are often taught to push their hips *forward* as the upper body bends back. This \"offset\" or \"pushed\" hip allows for a much deeper and more dramatic backbend. It creates a visually striking, broken line that is a hallmark of the Balanchine aesthetic.\n\n4.  **Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While the specific *port de bras* (arm movements) and use of *allongé* (lengthening) might have stylistic nuances in each method, it is not the primary or most fundamental difference.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the most critical point of divergence. Vaganova insists on stable, square hips held over the feet. Balanchine encourages pushing the hips forward to increase the depth of the backbend. This is a fundamental difference in the mechanics of the movement.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is generally associated with faster movements, a cambré can be performed at various tempos in either method depending on the exercise or choreography. Speed is a quality of performance, not a core technical difference in the pose itself.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The Balanchine method typically results in a deeper backbend. However, this is a *consequence* of the technique used, specifically the forward placement of the hips. The hip placement is the *cause*, while the degree of the bend is the *effect*. Therefore, hip placement is the more fundamental difference.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head placement follows the line of the spine and back. The more extreme head position in the Balanchine version is a direct result of the deeper backbend, which is caused by the hip placement.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most distinct and foundational technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the action and placement of the hips. The Vaganova method maintains a stable, square pelvis, while the Balanchine method utilizes a forward push of the hips to achieve a deeper, more dramatic arch.\n\n<<<B>>>"
