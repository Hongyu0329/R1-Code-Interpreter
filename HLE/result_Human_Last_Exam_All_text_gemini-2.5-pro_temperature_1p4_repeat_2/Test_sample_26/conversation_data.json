    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ for a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object of study**\nThe object is $X$, a smooth quintic hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n*   This means $X$ is the zero locus of a smooth homogeneous polynomial of degree 5 in 4 variables.\n*   $X$ is a complex submanifold of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ of complex dimension 2.\n*   As a real manifold, $X$ has dimension 4.\n*   Since $X$ is a projective variety, it is a compact manifold.\n*   As a complex manifold, $X$ is orientable.\nSo, $X$ is a compact, orientable, smooth 4-dimensional real manifold.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the rank of a homotopy group to Betti numbers**\nThe question asks for the rank of the abelian group $\\pi_3(X)$. The rank of an abelian group $G$ is the dimension of the vector space $G \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThere is a fundamental result, a consequence of rational homotopy theory, that relates the rank of homotopy groups to Betti numbers. For any simply connected space $Y$, the rational Hurewicz map is an isomorphism. This implies that for any $n \\ge 2$:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_n(Y)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_n(Y) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(H_n(Y; \\mathbb{Q})) = b_n(Y) $$\nwhere $b_n(Y)$ is the $n$-th Betti number of $Y$ (the rank of the homology group $H_n(Y, \\mathbb{Z})$).\nWe will first show that $X$ is simply connected, which will allow us to use this result for $n=3$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the fundamental group of X using the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**\nThe Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem relates the topology of a complex submanifold to the topology of the ambient projective space. For a smooth complex submanifold $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^n$ of complex dimension $m$, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^n$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups for degrees less than $m$.\n$$ i_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(\\mathbb{CP}^n) \\text{ is an isomorphism for } k < m $$\nIn our case, $X \\subset \\mathbb{CP}^3$ has complex dimension $m=2$. The theorem applies for $k < 2$. For $k=1$, we get:\n$$ \\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) $$\nThe complex projective space $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ is simply connected for all $n \\ge 1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. This means $X$ is simply connected.\n\n**Step 4: Use Poincaré Duality for Betti numbers**\nSince $X$ is a compact, orientable, 4-dimensional manifold (as established in Step 1), Poincaré Duality holds for its Betti numbers. This duality states that:\n$$ b_k(X) = b_{4-k}(X) $$\nfor any integer $k$ from 0 to 4.\nFor our specific problem, we are interested in $b_3(X)$. Applying Poincaré Duality for $k=3$, we get:\n$$ b_3(X) = b_{4-3}(X) = b_1(X) $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the first Betti number $b_1(X)$**\nThe first Betti number $b_1(X)$ is the rank of the first homology group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. The Hurewicz theorem states that for a path-connected space, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$.\n$$ H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)^{\\text{ab}} = \\pi_1(X) / [\\pi_1(X), \\pi_1(X)] $$\nIn Step 3, we found that $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. The abelianization of the trivial group is the trivial group itself.\n$$ H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0 $$\nThe rank of the trivial group is 0, so $b_1(X) = 0$.\n\n**Step 6: Final calculation**\nWe can now assemble the results from the previous steps.\n*   From Step 2: Since $X$ is simply connected, $\\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X)$.\n*   From Step 4: By Poincaré Duality, $b_3(X) = b_1(X)$.\n*   From Step 5: We calculated $b_1(X) = 0$.\n\nCombining these, we get:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = b_3(X) = b_1(X) = 0 $$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Nature of the Space:** Correctly identifying that $X$ is a compact, orientable 4-manifold is crucial for applying Poincaré Duality.\n2.  **Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem:** It is vital to use the correct version of the theorem (for homotopy groups) and to check the dimensional constraints ($k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X)$).\n3.  **Simple Connectivity:** Showing that $X$ is simply connected is a key step that simplifies the relationship between homotopy and homology.\n4.  **Rank Relationship:** The fact that $\\text{rank}(\\pi_n) = b_n$ for simply connected spaces is a non-trivial result from algebraic topology.\n5.  **Poincaré Duality:** This powerful tool simplifies the problem from computing $b_3$ to computing $b_1$.\n6.  **Hurewicz Theorem (for $n=1$):** The relationship $H_1 = \\pi_1^{\\text{ab}}$ is fundamental.\n\nThe entire logical chain is robust and each step is justified by a major theorem in algebraic topology and geometry.\n\nThe final answer is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
