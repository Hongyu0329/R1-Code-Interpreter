    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Base Health in Expert Mode:** First, we need the Eye of Cthulhu's base health in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, this value is **3,640 HP**.\n\n2.  **Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula:** Next, we need to understand how boss health scales with the number of players. The source code reveals a specific formula for multiplayer scaling in Expert Mode. For each additional player beyond the first, the boss's health is increased by 35%.\n    *   Let `N` be the number of players.\n    *   The health multiplier is calculated as: `Multiplier = 1 + (N - 1) * 0.35`.\n    *   The total health `H` for `N` players is: `H(N) = BaseHealth * Multiplier`.\n    *   Substituting the values, we get: `H(N) = 3640 * (1 + (N - 1) * 0.35)`.\n    *   This can be simplified to `H(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35 * N)`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing for an \"Infinite Number of Players\":** The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Mathematically, we would take the limit of the function `H(N)` as `N` approaches infinity.\n    *   `lim (N -> âˆž) [3640 * (0.65 + 0.35 * N)]`\n    *   Since this is a linear function with a positive coefficient for `N`, the limit is infinity.\n\n4.  **Considering the Game's Technical Limitations (\"According to the source code\"):** While the mathematical formula goes to infinity, the game itself is a program with technical limitations. The most critical limitation here is the data type used to store the health value.\n    *   In Terraria's source code, an NPC's maximum health (`lifeMax`) is stored as a 32-bit signed integer (`int`).\n    *   A 32-bit signed integer has a specific maximum value it can hold.\n\n5.  **The Hard Cap - `int.MaxValue`:** The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`, which is **2,147,483,647**.\n    *   The game calculates the final health using floating-point numbers (`double`) and then casts the result to an `int`. If the calculated health exceeds `2,147,483,647`, the cast will cause an integer overflow. In C# (the language Terraria is written in), this overflow would typically result in the value wrapping around to `int.MinValue` (-2,147,483,648).\n    *   A boss with negative health would instantly die upon spawning or taking damage. Therefore, any health value that requires more than a 32-bit signed integer to store is not achievable in the game.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe theoretical maximum health is not infinite but is capped by the largest possible value that the game's code can handle for that variable. The formula for health increases linearly with the number of players, but it cannot exceed the maximum value of the data type used to store it. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu (or any other NPC) is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
