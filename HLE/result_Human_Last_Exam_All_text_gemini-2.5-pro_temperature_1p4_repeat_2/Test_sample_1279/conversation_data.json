    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Theoretical Framework**\n\n*   **Theory:** We are working with a scalar field theory with a $\\phi^4$ interaction.\n*   **Interaction Lagrangian:** The interaction term is given by $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!} \\phi^4$. The coupling constant is $\\lambda$.\n*   **Vertex Rule:** Each interaction vertex involves four $\\phi$ fields. In Feynman diagrams, this corresponds to a vertex with four lines (legs) and is associated with a factor of $-i\\lambda$. The $4!$ in the denominator is a combinatorial factor that is crucial for calculating symmetry factors.\n*   **Vacuum Bubble Diagrams:** These are Feynman diagrams with no external lines. They represent vacuum-to-vacuum transition amplitudes. They are also known as closed or tadpole diagrams.\n*   **Order of Calculation:** We are interested in \"second-order\" diagrams, which means diagrams that are of order $\\lambda^2$. Since each vertex introduces one factor of $\\lambda$, second-order diagrams must contain exactly two vertices.\n\n**2. Identifying the Diagrams**\n\nWe need to find all unique, *connected* vacuum bubble diagrams with two vertices in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n*   Let the two vertices be $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n*   Each vertex has 4 lines (or \"half-propagators\") emanating from it.\n*   In total, we have $2 \\times 4 = 8$ half-lines that must be connected to form propagators.\n*   Let $n_{12}$ be the number of propagators connecting $V_1$ and $V_2$.\n*   Let $n_{11}$ be the number of propagators forming loops at $V_1$ (a line starting and ending at $V_1$).\n*   Let $n_{22}$ be the number of propagators forming loops at $V_2$.\n*   The total number of lines connected to a vertex (its degree) must be 4. A loop contributes 2 to the degree. Therefore, we have the following constraints for the degrees of the vertices:\n    *   Degree($V_1$): $n_{12} + 2n_{11} = 4$\n    *   Degree($V_2$): $n_{12} + 2n_{22} = 4$\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that $2n_{11} = 2n_{22}$, which implies $n_{11} = n_{22}$. We also see that $4 - n_{12}$ must be a non-negative even number. We can now list the possible integer solutions for $n_{12}$:\n\n*   **Case 1: $n_{12} = 0$**\n    *   $2n_{11} = 4 \\implies n_{11} = 2$. So $n_{22} = 2$.\n    *   This configuration consists of two separate vertices, each with two self-loops. This is a disconnected diagram, representing two first-order vacuum bubbles. We are looking for connected second-order diagrams.\n\n*   **Case 2: $n_{12} = 2$**\n    *   $2n_{11} = 4 - 2 = 2 \\implies n_{11} = 1$. So $n_{22} = 1$.\n    *   **Diagram 1:** This diagram has two propagators connecting the two vertices, and each vertex has one self-loop. This diagram is often called the \"setting-sun\" or \"figure-8\" diagram.\n\n*   **Case 3: $n_{12} = 4$**\n    *   $2n_{11} = 4 - 4 = 0 \\implies n_{11} = 0$. So $n_{22} = 0$.\n    *   **Diagram 2:** This diagram has four propagators connecting the two vertices directly, with no self-loops. This can be visualized as two concentric bubbles or a \"double-scoop\" ice cream cone shape.\n\nOther integer values for $n_{12}$ (like 1 or 3) would make $4-n_{12}$ odd, and values greater than 4 would make it negative, so there are no other solutions. Thus, there are exactly two connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams.\n\n**3. Calculating the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, for a diagram is the number of ways one can permute the lines and vertices of the diagram that leave the diagram's topology unchanged. An equivalent and systematic method is to calculate the number of Wick contractions ($C$) that form the diagram. The symmetry factor is then given by the formula:\n$S = \\frac{N! (V!)^k}{C}$\nwhere $N$ is the order of the diagram (number of vertices), $V!$ is the combinatorial factor from the Lagrangian (here $4!$), $k$ is the number of vertices ($k=N$), and $C$ is the number of contractions. For our case, $N=2, V=4, k=2$, so $S = \\frac{2! (4!)^2}{C}$.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor for Diagram 1 (Setting-Sun)**\n    *   **Description:** Two vertices ($V_1, V_2$), two propagators between them, one loop at $V_1$, one loop at $V_2$.\n    *   **Counting Contractions (C₁):** We start with the fields $\\phi(x)^4 \\phi(y)^4$.\n        1.  Choose 2 of the 4 fields at vertex $x$ to contract with each other (form the loop): $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n        2.  Choose 2 of the 4 fields at vertex $y$ to contract with each other (form the other loop): $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways.\n        3.  We are left with 2 fields at $x$ and 2 fields at $y$. We must contract them. There are 2 ways to pair them up to form the two propagators between $x$ and $y$.\n        4.  Total number of contractions: $C_1 = 6 \\times 6 \\times 2 = 72$.\n    *   **Calculation of S₁:**\n        $S_1 = \\frac{2! \\times (4!)^2}{C_1} = \\frac{2 \\times (24)^2}{72} = \\frac{2 \\times 576}{72} = \\frac{1152}{72} = 16$.\n    *   The symmetry factor for the setting-sun diagram is **16**.\n\n*   **Symmetry Factor for Diagram 2 (Concentric Bubbles)**\n    *   **Description:** Two vertices ($V_1, V_2$) connected by four propagators.\n    *   **Counting Contractions (C₂):** We again start with $\\phi(x)^4 \\phi(y)^4$.\n        1.  All four fields at $x$ must contract with the four fields at $y$.\n        2.  Take the first field at $x$. It can be paired with any of the 4 fields at $y$ (4 choices).\n        3.  The second field at $x$ can be paired with any of the remaining 3 fields at $y$ (3 choices).\n        4.  The third field at $x$ has 2 choices, and the fourth has 1 choice.\n        5.  Total number of ways to pair them up is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4! = 24$.\n        6.  Total number of contractions: $C_2 = 24$.\n    *   **Calculation of S₂:**\n        $S_2 = \\frac{2! \\times (4!)^2}{C_2} = \\frac{2 \\times (24)^2}{24} = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n    *   The symmetry factor for the concentric bubble diagram is **48**.\n\n**4. Summing the Symmetry Factors**\n\nThe question asks for the sum of the symmetry factors of all identified diagrams.\n\n*   Symmetry factor of Diagram 1: $S_1 = 16$\n*   Symmetry factor of Diagram 2: $S_2 = 48$\n*   Total Sum = $S_1 + S_2 = 16 + 48 = 64$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are two connected second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n1.  The \"setting-sun\" diagram, which has two vertices, two propagators connecting them, and one self-loop on each vertex. Its symmetry factor is **16**.\n2.  The \"concentric bubble\" diagram, which has two vertices connected by four propagators. Its symmetry factor is **48**.\n\nThe sum of all these symmetry factors is $16 + 48 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
