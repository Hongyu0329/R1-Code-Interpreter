    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the cellular automaton Rule 110 simulation.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Rule 110\n\nA 1D cellular automaton's evolution is determined by a rule that specifies the next state of a cell based on its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule is defined for all 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns.\n\nRule 110 is named after the binary representation of the decimal number 110, which is `01101110`. This binary string defines the output for the 8 neighborhoods, ordered from `111` to `000`.\n\nThe rule table is as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood (Left, Center, Right) | Next State of Center Cell |\n|:-------------------------------------------|:--------------------------|\n| `111`                                      | `0`                       |\n| `110`                                      | `1`                       |\n| `101`                                      | `1`                       |\n| `100`                                      | `0`                       |\n| `011`                                      | `1`                       |\n| `010`                                      | `1`                       |\n| `001`                                      | `1`                       |\n| `000`                                      | `0`                       |\n\n### Step 2: Initial State and Boundary Conditions\n\nThe simulation starts with a single cell in state `1`, surrounded by an infinite number of cells in state `0`.\n*   **Generation 0:** `...0001000...`\n\nWe only need to track the active part of the pattern. The pattern is assumed to be surrounded by `0`s, which is a key point for calculating the next state of the cells at the edges of the pattern. At each step `t`, the pattern can grow by at most one cell on each side.\n\n### Step 3: Simulating the Generations\n\nWe apply the rule table to each cell of the current generation to compute the next generation. The process is iterative. We will show the non-zero part of the pattern for each generation.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** We calculate based on the neighborhoods `001`, `010`, `100`. This gives `110`.\n    *   Pattern: `110`\n*   **Gen 2:** We apply the rules to the padded pattern `01100`. Neighborhoods are `001`, `011`, `110`, `100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1110`\n*   **Gen 3:** From padded `011100`.\n    *   Pattern: `11010`\n*   **Gen 4:** From padded `0110100`.\n    *   Pattern: `111110`\n*   **Gen 5:** From padded `01111100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1100010`\n*   **Gen 6:** From padded `011000100`.\n    *   Pattern: `11100110`\n*   **Gen 7:** From padded `0111001100`.\n    *   Pattern: `110101110`\n*   **Gen 8:** From padded `01101011100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1111111010`\n*   **Gen 9:** From padded `011111110100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1100001110`\n*   **Gen 10:** From padded `011000011100`.\n    *   Pattern: `11100011010`\n*   **Gen 11:** From padded `0111000110100`.\n    *   Pattern: `110100111110`\n*   **Gen 12:** From padded `01101001111100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1111101100010`\n*   **Gen 13:** From padded `011111011000100`.\n    *   Pattern: `11000111100110`\n*   **Gen 14:** From padded `0110001111001100`.\n    *   Pattern: `111001100101110`\n*   **Gen 15:** From padded `01110011001011100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1101011101111010`\n*   **Gen 16:** From padded `011010111011110100`.\n    *   Pattern: `11111110111001110`\n*   **Gen 17:** From padded `0111111101110011100`.\n    *   Pattern: `110000011101011010`\n*   **Gen 18:** From padded `01100000111010110100`.\n    *   Pattern: `1110000110111111110`\n*   **Gen 19:** From padded `011100001101111111100`.\n    *   Pattern: `11010001111100000010`\n*   **Gen 20:** From padded `0110100011111000000100`. We apply the rules one final time:\n    *   Neighborhoods: `001` `011` `110` `101` `010` `100` `000` `001` `011` `111` `111` `111` `110` `100` `000` `000` `000` `001` `010` `100`\n    *   Next states: `1` `1` `1` `1` `1` `0` `0` `1` `1` `0` `0` `0` `1` `0` `0` `0` `0` `1` `1` `0`\n    *   Final Pattern: `11111001100010000110`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final binary pattern after 20 applications of Rule 110 is:\n\n<<<11111001100010000110>>>"
