    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe question asks us to evaluate the definite integral:\n`V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\n\nThe integrand is in the form `g'(x) / g(x)`, where `g(x) = F₃(x)`.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Antiderivative**\nWe know that the integral of `g'(x) / g(x)` is `ln|g(x)| + C`.\nUsing the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n`V = [ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`\n\n**Step 3: Determine the function F₃(x)**\nThe functions are defined as a chain:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate F₃(0)**\nWe substitute `x = 0` into the expression for `F₃(x)`:\n*   `sin(0) = 0`\n*   `e^(sin(0)) = e^0 = 1`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(1)**\nWe substitute `x = 1` into the expression for `F₃(x)`. Note that the argument of the sine function is in radians.\n*   `sin(1)` is `sin(1 radian)`.\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the values back into the integral expression for V**\nNow we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the equation for `V`.\n`V = ln|ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))| - ln|ln(2)|`\n\n**Careful Point: Check the signs of F₃(1) and F₃(0)**\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)`. Since `2 > 1`, `ln(2)` is positive.\n*   For `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`:\n    *   `1` radian is approximately 57.3°. Since `0 < 1 < π/2` (where `π/2 ≈ 1.57`), `sin(1)` is positive.\n    *   Since `sin(1) > 0`, we have `e^(sin(1)) > e^0 = 1`.\n    *   Therefore, `1 + e^(sin(1)) > 2`.\n    *   This means `ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) > ln(2)`, so `F₃(1)` is also positive.\n*   Since both `F₃(0)` and `F₃(1)` are positive, we can safely remove the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can simplify this to:\n`V = ln( ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) )`\n\n**Step 7: Numerical Calculation**\nWe now compute the numerical value of V using a calculator.\n*   `sin(1) ≈ 0.841471`\n*   `e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^0.841471 ≈ 2.319775`\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.319775`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319775) ≈ 1.200001`\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2) ≈ 0.693147`\n*   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) ≈ ln(1.200001) - ln(0.693147)`\n*   `V ≈ 0.182322 - (-0.366513) ≈ 0.548835`\n\nAlternatively, using the simplified form:\n*   `V = ln( F₃(1) / F₃(0) ) ≈ ln( 1.200001 / 0.693147 )`\n*   `V ≈ ln(1.731234) ≈ 0.548835`\n\nSo, `V ≈ 0.548835`.\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer Calculation**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n*   `10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548835 = 5488.35`\n*   The closest integer to `5488.35` is `5488`.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
