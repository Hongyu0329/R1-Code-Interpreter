    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern.**\nFirst, let's try finding the difference between consecutive terms (first-order difference).\n*   11 - 2 = 9\n*   23 - 11 = 12\n*   51 - 23 = 28\n*   119 - 51 = 68\nThe differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no obvious arithmetic pattern here.\n\nLet's try finding the ratio between consecutive terms.\n*   11 / 2 = 5.5\n*   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n*   51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n*   119 / 51 ≈ 2.33\nThe ratios are not constant, so it's not a simple geometric progression.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern involving multiplication and addition/subtraction.**\nLet's test if there is a relationship of the form `Next Term = k * Previous Term ± Constant`. Since the ratio gets closer to 2, let's start with `k=2`.\n*   2 * 2 + 7 = 11\n*   2 * 11 + 1 = 23\n*   2 * 23 + 5 = 51\n*   2 * 51 + 17 = 119\nThe numbers being added are 7, 1, 5, 17. This sequence doesn't seem to have a clear pattern.\n\nNow, let's try `k=3`.\n*   3 * 2 + 5 = 11\n*   3 * 11 - 10 = 23\n*   3 * 23 - 18 = 69 - 18 = 51\n*   3 * 51 - 34 = 153 - 34 = 119\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the discovered pattern.**\nThe pattern appears to be `a_{n+1} = 3 * a_n - c_n` (for n ≥ 2), where `a_n` is the n-th term in the sequence.\nLet's look at the sequence of numbers being subtracted (`c_n`): 10, 18, 34.\nLet's find the differences in this new sequence:\n*   18 - 10 = 8\n*   34 - 18 = 16\nThe differences are 8 and 16. This is a clear geometric progression where each term is twice the previous one (8, 16, ...).\n\n**Step 5: Use the pattern to find the next term.**\nThe next difference in the subtraction sequence should be 16 * 2 = 32.\nSo, the next number to subtract will be 34 + 32 = 66.\nNow, we apply the main rule to find the missing term in the original sequence:\n*   Missing Term = 3 * (previous term) - (next number to subtract)\n*   Missing Term = 3 * 119 - 66\n*   Missing Term = 357 - 66\n*   Missing Term = 291\n\n**Step 6: Final check.**\nThe calculated number is 291, which corresponds to option A. The pattern is consistent for the majority of the sequence and provides a logical progression.\n\nTherefore, the number that should be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
