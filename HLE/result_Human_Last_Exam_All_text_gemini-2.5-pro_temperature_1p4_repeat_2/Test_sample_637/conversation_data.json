    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the deadbeat observer.\n\n**1. System Definition**\nThe discrete-time system is given by:\n`x(k+1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n`y(k) = Cx(k)`\nwith matrices:\nA = `[[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]]`\nB = `[[0], [1], [-1], [1]]`\nC = `[[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]`\n\nThe state vector `x` is of size n=4. The output vector `y` is of size m=2.\n\n**2. Goal: Deadbeat Observer**\nThe goal is to design an observer with gain `L` such that the observation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` converges to zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This requires the observer error dynamics matrix, `A_e = A - LC`, to be nilpotent, i.e., `(A - LC)^p = 0` for the smallest possible integer `p`. This smallest `p` is the observability index `nu` of the system.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Check Observability and find the Observability Index (`nu`)**\nThe observability matrix is `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...]`\nFirst, calculate `C`:\n`C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]]` (rank is 2)\n\nNext, calculate `CA`:\n`CA = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] * A = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nNow, check the rank of `[C; CA]`:\n`O_2 = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0, 1], [-2, 0, 1, 0]]`\nThe rank of this 4x4 matrix can be found by checking its determinant or by row reduction. The second column is all zeros, so the rank is at most 3. By inspection, the rows `[1,0,0,0]`, `[0,0,0,1]` (from R2-R1), and `[0,0,1,0]` (from R4+2*R1) form a basis for the row space. So, `rank(O_2) = 3`.\nSince `rank < n`, we continue.\n\nCalculate `CA^2`:\n`A^2 = A*A = [[0, 1, 1, -2], [-3, 0, 2, -1], [2, -1, 0, 3], [0, 0, 0, -3]]`\n`CA^2 = C*A^2 = [[0, 1, 1, -2], [0, 1, 1, -5]]`\n\nNow, check the rank of `[C; CA; CA^2]`:\nThe rows of `C` and `CA` span a 3D space. We check if the rows of `CA^2` add a new dimension. The vector `[0, 1, 1, -2]` is linearly independent of the previous rows (it has a non-zero second component, which was missing). Therefore, `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4 = n`.\n\nThe system is observable. The observability index `nu` is the smallest integer `p` for which `rank(O_p) = n`. Here, `nu = 3`. This means the error can be made zero in 3 steps.\n\n**Step 2: Partitioning the System (Reduced-Order Observer Approach)**\nFrom the `C` matrix, we see that `y1(k) = x1(k)` and `y2(k) = x1(k) + x4(k)`. This means we can directly determine `x1(k)` and `x4(k)` from the output `y(k)`.\n`x1(k) = y1(k)`\n`x4(k) = y2(k) - y1(k)`\nThese are the \"directly observed\" states. The remaining states, `x2(k)` and `x3(k)`, are the \"unobserved\" states.\n\nWe define a state transformation `x'(k) = Px(k)` to group these states:\nLet `x' = [x1; x4; x2; x3]`. The permutation matrix `P` and its inverse `P^T` are:\n`P = [[1,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,1,0,0], [0,0,1,0]]`\n`P^T = [[1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,1,0,0]]`\n\nThe system is transformed to `(A', B', C')` where `A' = PAP^T`, `B' = PB`, `C' = CP^T`.\n`A' = [[-1, 1, 0, 0], [-1, -1, 0, 1], [1, 2, 0, 0], [0, -1, 1, 0]]`\n`C' = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 0]]`\nWe partition `A'` according to `x' = [x'_o; x'_u]`, where `x'_o = [x1; x4]` and `x'_u = [x2; x3]`.\n`A' = [[A'_{11}, A'_{12}], [A'_{21}, A'_{22}]]`\n`A'_{11} = [[-1, 1], [-1, -1]]`\n`A'_{12} = [[0, 0], [0, 1]]`\n`A'_{21} = [[1, 2], [0, -1]]`\n`A'_{22} = [[0, 0], [1, 0]]`\n\n`C'` is partitioned as `C' = [C'_o, 0]` where `C'_o = [[1, 0], [1, 1]]` is invertible.\n\n**Step 3: Design Observer Gain `L'` for the Transformed System**\nThe observer gain `L` is related to `L'` by `L = P^T L'`. We design `L'` by partitioning it as `L' = [L'_o; L'_u]`.\nThe goal is to make the error dynamics matrix `A'_e = A' - L'C'` nilpotent with index 3.\nWe choose `L'_o` and `L'_u` to give `A'_e` a specific structure.\n\n1.  Choose `L'_o` such that the error in the observed states dies in one step. This is achieved by setting `A'_{11} - L'_o C'_o = 0`.\n    `L'_o = A'_{11} * (C'_o)^-1 = [[-1, 1], [-1, -1]] * [[1, 0], [1, 1]]^-1`\n    `L'_o = [[-1, 1], [-1, -1]] * [[1, 0], [-1, 1]] = [[-2, 1], [0, -1]]`\n\n2.  Choose `L'_u` to simplify the coupling term `A'_{21} - L'_u C'_o`. We set this term to zero.\n    `L'_u = A'_{21} * (C'_o)^-1 = [[1, 2], [0, -1]] * [[1, 0], [1, 1]]^-1`\n    `L'_u = [[1, 2], [0, -1]] * [[1, 0], [-1, 1]] = [[-1, 2], [1, -1]]`\n\nThe complete gain for the transformed system is:\n`L' = [L'_o; L'_u] = [[-2, 1], [0, -1], [-1, 2], [1, -1]]`\n\n**Step 4: Transform the Gain `L'` back to Original Coordinates**\nThe gain `L` for the original system is found by `L = P^T L'`:\n`L = [[1,0,0,0], [0,0,1,0], [0,0,0,1], [0,1,0,0]] * [[-2, 1], [0, -1], [-1, 2], [1, -1]]`\n\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n- Row 1 of L = Row 1 of L' = `[-2, 1]`\n- Row 2 of L = Row 3 of L' = `[-1, 2]`\n- Row 3 of L = Row 4 of L' = `[1, -1]`\n- Row 4 of L = Row 2 of L' = `[0, -1]`\n\nSo the final gain matrix is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]`\n\n**Step 5: Verification (Optional but Recommended)**\nWe can check if this gain results in an error matrix `A_e = A - LC` that is nilpotent with index 3 (`A_e^3 = 0`).\n`LC = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]] * [[1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1]] = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 0, -1]]`\n`A_e = A - LC = [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 1, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 1, -1]] - [[-1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, -1], [-1, 0, 0, -1]]`\n`A_e = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0]]`\n\nNow we check its powers:\n`A_e^2 = A_e * A_e = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 0]]`\n`A_e^3 = A_e^2 * A_e = [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0]]`\nSince `A_e^2 != 0` and `A_e^3 = 0`, the error will be identically zero after 3 steps, which is the shortest possible time. The designed gain `L` is correct.\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
