The bare Green's function $G_0$ has a functional form that is the reciprocal of a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. In frequency-momentum space, this relationship is expressed as $G_0(k, \omega) = [\omega - (\epsilon_k - \mu) + i\delta]^{-1}$, where $\omega$ is the frequency and $\mu$ is the chemical potential. Therefore, the inverse of the Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$, depends linearly on $\epsilon_k$.
