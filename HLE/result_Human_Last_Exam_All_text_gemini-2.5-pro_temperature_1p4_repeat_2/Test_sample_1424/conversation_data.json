    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function on single-particle energy eigenvalues.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Definition of the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\n*   In quantum many-body physics, the single-particle Green's function, $G$, describes the propagation of a particle (or hole) through an interacting system.\n*   The **bare** or **non-interacting Green's function**, denoted as $G_0$, describes this propagation in a system where particles do not interact with each other. It is a fundamental building block in perturbation theory.\n*   In the path integral formalism, which uses imaginary time $\\tau = it$, the Green's function is defined as the expectation value of a product of Grassmann fields, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}(\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$, which represent the particles.\n    \n    $G_0(x, x') = -\\langle \\psi(x) \\bar{\\psi}(x') \\rangle_0$\n    \n    where $x = (\\mathbf{r}, \\tau)$ represents a spacetime point, and the average $\\langle \\dots \\rangle_0$ is taken with respect to the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\n**2. The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$) in the Path Integral**\n\n*   The path integral is weighted by the exponential of the action, $e^{-S_0}$. For a non-interacting system, the Hamiltonian, $H_0$, is simply the sum of the energies of all single-particle states.\n*   It is most convenient to work in a basis that diagonalizes this Hamiltonian. Let this basis be indexed by $k$ (which could represent momentum, or any other set of quantum numbers), with corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n*   The non-interacting Hamiltonian, measuring energy relative to the chemical potential $\\mu$, is:\n    \n    $H_0 = \\sum_k (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k^\\dagger c_k$\n    \n    where $c_k^\\dagger$ and $c_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for the state $k$.\n*   The corresponding action in the imaginary time path integral formalism is:\n    \n    $S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n    \n    where $\\beta=1/T$ is the inverse temperature and $\\psi_k, \\bar{\\psi}_k$ are the Grassmann fields in the diagonal basis.\n\n**3. Moving to Frequency-Momentum Space**\n\n*   The expression for the action and the subsequent calculation are greatly simplified by performing a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to a discrete set of frequencies known as Matsubara frequencies, $\\omega_n$. For fermions, $i\\omega_n = i(2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n*   In this basis, the time derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes a simple quadratic form which is diagonal in both $k$ and $n$:\n    \n    $S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_{k,n}$\n    \n    This equation is crucial as it contains all the physics of the non-interacting system.\n\n**4. Calculating the Green's Function**\n\n*   The Green's function in this frequency-momentum representation, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, is defined as the inverse of the term multiplying the fields in the action.\n*   We can think of the term $(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$ as the $(k,n)$ component of a diagonal \"matrix\" whose inverse we want to find. In the context of path integrals, this is often written as:\n    \n    $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = -\\langle \\psi_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} \\rangle_0 = [(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)]^{-1}$\n    \n*   Therefore, we arrive at the expression for the bare Green's function in Matsubara frequency space:\n    \n    $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\n    \n*   Often, one performs an analytic continuation to real frequencies ($\\omega$) via the substitution $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\delta$ (where $\\delta \\to 0^+$ is an infinitesimal that enforces causality). This gives the real-frequency retarded Green's function:\n    \n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$\n\n### **Careful Points to Note**\n\n1.  **Non-Interacting System**: This entire derivation is valid only for the **bare** Green's function, $G_0$. In an interacting system, a self-energy term $\\Sigma(k, \\omega)$ would appear in the denominator, making the relationship far more complex.\n2.  **Basis Choice**: The simple form is obtained in the eigenbasis ($k$-space) of the single-particle Hamiltonian. In real space, the Green's function is a Fourier transform of this expression, which convolutes the dependence. However, the fundamental dependence is determined by the poles, which are set by $\\epsilon_k$.\n3.  **Energy Reference**: The physically relevant energy is the single-particle energy measured with respect to the chemical potential, i.e., $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$. The poles of the Green's function occur when the probing frequency $\\omega$ equals this energy difference.\n\n### **Conclusion: The Functional Dependence**\n\nBy examining the final expression, either in Matsubara or real frequency,\n$G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwe can directly state the functional dependence. The bare Green's function $G_0$ is **inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$**.\n\nMore precisely, the inverse of the bare Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$, is a **linear function** of $\\epsilon_k$:\n$G_0(k, \\omega)^{-1} = \\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)$\n\nThis means that for a fixed frequency $\\omega$ and chemical potential $\\mu$, the relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$ is of the form $f(x) = \\frac{1}{A - x}$, where $x=\\epsilon_k$ and $A$ is a constant.\n\n***\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ has a functional form that is the reciprocal of a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. In frequency-momentum space, this relationship is expressed as $G_0(k, \\omega) = [\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta]^{-1}$, where $\\omega$ is the frequency and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. Therefore, the inverse of the Green's function, $G_0^{-1}$, depends linearly on $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
