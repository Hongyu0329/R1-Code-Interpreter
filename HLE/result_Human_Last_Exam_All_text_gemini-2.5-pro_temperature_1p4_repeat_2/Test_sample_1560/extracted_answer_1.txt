The final state is a statistical mixture of five possible outcomes. After applying gate Q to the first ququint of the entangled pair and measuring the second ququint, the measurement outcome for the second ququint is $|k\rangle_B$ (for $k \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}$) with a uniform probability of 1/5 for each outcome. The entire system collapses into the corresponding state $(Q|k\rangle_A) \otimes |k\rangle_B$. The five possible final states are:
1. With probability 1/5, the state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_A + |2\rangle_A) \otimes |0\rangle_B$.
2. With probability 1/5, the state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle_A + |3\rangle_A) \otimes |1\rangle_B$.
3. With probability 1/5, the state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|1\rangle_A + |4\rangle_A) \otimes |2\rangle_B$.
4. With probability 1/5, the state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|2\rangle_A + |0\rangle_A) \otimes |3\rangle_B$.
5. With probability 1/5, the state is $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|3\rangle_A + |2\rangle_A) \otimes |4\rangle_B$.
