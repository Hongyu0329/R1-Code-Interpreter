    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe quote is from the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky, who called the man \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This points to a few things:\n*   The man is likely connected to Russia or the Soviet Union, as he was a subject for a major Russian poet.\n*   The description \"sailor\" suggests he was an explorer, navigator, or someone involved with sea travel.\n*   \"Joy-discovering\" is a poetic phrase that implies exploration, finding new things, and a sense of wonder.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nVoznesensky also wrote, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This is a very strong clue. It means that for a long time, the location of this man's burial site was completely unknown. He likely died in a remote place, and his body was not returned home or was buried in an unmarked grave that was lost to time.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe final clue states that the answer to the question about the grave \"emerged in the late 1980s.\" This is the key to solving the puzzle. It tells us that a historical mystery was solved during this specific period. The man's remains or his grave were found or identified at that time. The late 1980s was the era of *Glasnost* and *Perestroika* in the Soviet Union, a time when international collaborations and historical investigations became more possible.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues and identify the man.**\nWe are looking for a famous sailor or explorer connected to Russia whose lost grave was discovered in the late 1980s/early 1990s.\n*   This description perfectly fits **Vitus Bering**, a Danish explorer who served in the Russian Navy.\n*   Bering led two major Russian expeditions to the far east of Siberia and the coast of North America.\n*   He died from scurvy on an uninhabited island (now called Bering Island) in 1741 during his return voyage. He was buried there by the surviving crew, but the exact location of his grave was lost for over two centuries. This directly corresponds to Voznesensky's question, \"Where is your grave?\"\n*   In August 1991, as a result of a joint Danish-Russian expedition that was planned and initiated in the late 1980s, the graves of Vitus Bering and five of his crewmen were discovered and identified. This event provided the \"answer\" mentioned in the clue.\n\nTherefore, the man Voznesensky was writing about is Vitus Bering. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Bering>>>"
