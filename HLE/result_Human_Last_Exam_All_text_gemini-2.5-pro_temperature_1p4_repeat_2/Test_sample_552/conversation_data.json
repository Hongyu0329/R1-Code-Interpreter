    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The central question is to identify the specific person whose lectures Albert Einstein referenced in his 1905 scientific paper on Brownian motion.\n\n2.  **Specify the Paper in Question:** The paper is one of Einstein's four groundbreaking \"Annus Mirabilis\" (Miracle Year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" which translates to \"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Context:** This paper was fundamental because it provided a theoretical explanation for the random, jittery movement of particles in a fluid (Brownian motion) and, by doing so, offered strong evidence for the existence of atoms and molecules. Einstein's theoretical framework for this paper was built upon the principles of statistical mechanics.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** The field of statistical mechanics was dominated by a few key figures at the turn of the 20th century. The most prominent were Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs. Historical accounts suggest that Einstein was not aware of the full extent of Gibbs's work on statistical mechanics when he wrote his 1905 papers. This makes Ludwig Boltzmann a very strong candidate.\n\n5.  **Examine the Citation:** Scientific papers cite previous work to build upon, support, or contest existing theories. Einstein's papers were famously sparse with citations, as he often preferred to derive his results from first principles. Therefore, any citation he included is significant. In the Brownian motion paper, when discussing the fundamental relationship between entropy and probability (a cornerstone of statistical mechanics), Einstein does make a reference.\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the Specific Work Cited:** The question specifically asks about \"lectures\". Investigating the citation in Einstein's paper reveals that he refers to a work by Ludwig Boltzmann. The specific work is Boltzmann's two-volume book, *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*.\n\n7.  **Translate and Interpret the Title:** The German title *Vorlesungen über Gastheorie* translates directly into English as *Lectures on Gas Theory*. The word \"Vorlesungen\" literally means \"Lectures\". This book was a published compilation of Boltzmann's lectures on the subject. Therefore, when Einstein cited this book, he was, in fact, citing Boltzmann's published lectures.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on this analysis, the person whose lectures Einstein cited in his 1905 Brownian motion paper was the Austrian physicist who was a pioneer of statistical mechanics.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
