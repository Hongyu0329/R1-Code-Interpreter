The brain regions (or, more accurately, the major neural structures) lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the **pallial nerves** and the **visceral nerves**. These large nerve tracts originate directly from the posterior surface of the lobe and exit the central brain.
