The optimal combination is a **Zirconium (Zr)** complex chelated by a **sterically hindered, robust pincer-type bis(aryloxide) ligand**, which is supported on **sulfated zirconia (SZ)**. This system leverages the balanced reactivity of zirconium, the thermal stability and tunability of the pincer ligand, and the superacidic nature of the sulfated zirconia support, which acts as a co-activator to create a highly electrophilic center essential for efficient C-C bond cleavage during hydrogenolysis.
