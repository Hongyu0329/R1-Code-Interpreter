The final answer is a t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme based on BLS signatures. The design involves three main stages: (1) Setting up cryptographic primitives, including pairing-friendly elliptic curve groups and a hash-to-curve function. (2) A robust Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, such as one based on Pedersen VSS, to allow `n` parties to collaboratively create a group public key and their individual secret shares without a trusted dealer. (3) A two-round signing protocol where in the first round, `t` participating signers each compute and broadcast a partial signature, and in the second round, an aggregator combines these partial signatures using Lagrange interpolation to produce the final signature. The scheme is tightly secure because its security proof relies on the hardness of the co-CDH problem and does not use techniques like the forking lemma, resulting in a direct and efficient reduction from the scheme's security to the underlying hard problem.
