    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n1.  **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$)**: This is an algebraic group whose elements are 3-dimensional homology spheres (3-manifolds $Y$ with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere $S^3$). Two homology spheres, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are considered the same element in this group if they \"homology cobound\" a 4-manifold $W$. This means there exists a 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is the disjoint union of $Y_1$ and $-Y_2$ (i.e., $Y_2$ with reversed orientation), and $W$ has the same integer homology as a point. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n\n2.  **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure that creates a new 3-manifold from $S^3$ by modifying it along a knot $K$. We remove a tubular neighborhood of the knot and glue a solid torus back in a different way. The \"integral\" part refers to the surgery coefficient being an integer, $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_n^3(K)$.\n\n3.  **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: For the manifold $S_n^3(K)$ to be a homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S_n^3(K); \\mathbb{Z})$, must be trivial. The first homology group of a surgery on a knot is given by $H_1(S_n^3(K); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. For this group to be trivial, we must have $|n|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients $n=+1$ and $n=-1$.\n\n4.  **Knots with at most four crossings**: We need to list all knots up to 4 crossings. Standard knot tables show these are:\n    *   0 crossings: The unknot ($0_1$)\n    *   3 crossings: The trefoil knot ($3_1$)\n    *   4 crossings: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$)\n    (There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Surgery on Each Knot**\n\nWe will now examine the homology spheres obtained by $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of these knots and identify which element of the homology cobordism group they represent.\n\n*   **Case 1: The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   Surgery on the unknot is the simplest case. Both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the unknot result in the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(0_1) \\cong S^3$\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(0_1) \\cong S^3$\n    *   In the homology cobordism group $\\Theta_3^H$, $S^3$ is the identity element.\n    *   **Result:** The unknot provides **one** element: the identity.\n\n*   **Case 2: The Trefoil Knot ($3_1$)**\n    *   The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is different from its mirror image. We have the right-handed trefoil and the left-handed trefoil. However, the set of homology spheres obtained from both is the same.\n    *   $+1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil, $S_{+1}^3(3_1)$, produces the famous **Poincaré homology sphere**, often denoted $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. This is a well-known non-trivial element of $\\Theta_3^H$. Its Rokhlin invariant is 1, proving it is not homology cobordant to $S^3$ (which has Rokhlin invariant 0).\n    *   $-1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil, $S_{-1}^3(3_1)$, produces the orientation-reversed Poincaré sphere, $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. This is the inverse element to the Poincaré sphere in the group $\\Theta_3^H$.\n    *   These two elements, $[\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$ and $[-\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$, are distinct from the identity. They are also distinct from each other because the Poincaré sphere is known to have infinite order in $\\Theta_3^H$. If they were the same, the element would have order 2.\n    *   **Result:** The trefoil knot provides **two** distinct, non-trivial elements.\n\n*   **Case 3: The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is amphichiral (it is equivalent to its mirror image).\n    *   Crucially, the figure-eight knot is a **slice knot**. A slice knot is one that bounds a smoothly embedded disk in the 4-ball.\n    *   A fundamental theorem by Casson and Gordon states that if a knot $K$ is slice, then any homology sphere obtained by surgery on it is homology cobordant to the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   Therefore, both $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$ represent the identity element in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **Result:** The figure-eight knot provides **one** element: the identity, which we have already found.\n\n**Step 3: Count the Distinct Elements**\n\nLet's gather all the unique elements we have identified from the surgeries on all the knots with at most four crossings.\n\n1.  From the unknot: The identity element, $[S^3]$.\n2.  From the figure-eight knot: The identity element, $[S^3]$.\n3.  From the trefoil knot: The class of the Poincaré sphere, $[\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$, and its inverse, $[-\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$.\n\nThe set of all distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented is:\n{ $[S^3]$, $[\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$, $[-\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$ }\n\nThese three elements are all distinct. Therefore, there are a total of 3 such elements.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 3 elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n<<<3>>>"
