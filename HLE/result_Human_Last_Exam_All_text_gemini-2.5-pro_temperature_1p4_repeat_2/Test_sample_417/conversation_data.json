    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given compound.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Molecular Structure**\nThe IUPAC name is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The molecule is built on a \"2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\" core, which is also known as mesitylene.\n*   **Substituents:** At positions 1, 3, and 5 of the benzene ring, there are three identical substituents. The prefix \"tri\" confirms this.\n*   **Linker:** Each substituent is attached to the benzene ring via a \"methyl\" group, which in this context means a -CH2- (methylene) linker.\n*   **Main Substituent Group:** The methylene linker is attached to the nitrogen at position 2 of a complex heterocyclic system: `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`. This specific name describes a derivative of the natural product camphor, where the C2-C3 part of the camphor skeleton has been used to form a pyrazole ring. The given stereochemistry (4S,7R) indicates that a single enantiomer of this chiral camphor-derived unit is used.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Overall Symmetry of the Molecule**\nThe molecule has a 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene ring as its central core. This substitution pattern, combined with the fact that all three substituents are identical, imparts a three-fold rotational symmetry (a C3 axis) to the molecule, passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n\n*   **Key Consequence of C3 Symmetry:** Due to this symmetry, all three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Similarly, the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are chemically equivalent.\n*   **Strategy:** To find the total number of peaks, we only need to count the number of chemically distinct protons in one \"unique\" segment of the molecule and sum them up. A unique segment consists of one of the three identical arms and one-third of the central core (i.e., one methyl group).\n\n**Step 3: Count the Unique Protons in the Central Core**\n*   The central core is 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene. The three methyl groups (at positions 2, 4, and 6) are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n*   These three methyl groups will produce a single signal in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n*   **Peaks from central core = 1**\n\n**Step 4: Count the Unique Protons in a Single Substituent Arm**\nOne arm consists of the `-CH2-` linker and the camphor-pyrazole unit. We must identify all chemically non-equivalent protons within this arm.\n\n1.  **Methylene Linker (-CH2-)**:\n    *   This -CH2- group is attached to the chiral camphor-pyrazole unit.\n    *   Protons in a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are chemically non-equivalent. They are called diastereotopic protons.\n    *   Therefore, these two protons will have different chemical shifts and will appear as two distinct signals (likely a pair of doublets due to geminal coupling).\n    *   **Peaks from linker = 2**\n\n2.  **Camphor-Pyrazole Unit**: This is a rigid, chiral, and asymmetric bicyclic system. We must count every unique proton. For clarity, we will refer to the positions based on the more common camphor numbering.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton:** The pyrazole portion of the ring system has one C-H bond. This proton is in a unique chemical environment.\n        *   **Peaks = 1**\n    *   **Camphor Scaffold Methyl Protons:**\n        *   There is one methyl group on the bridgehead carbon (C1 in camphor numbering). This is a unique methyl group. **Peaks = 1**.\n        *   There are two methyl groups on the bridge carbon (C7 in camphor numbering). These are geminal methyl groups. Because they are part of a rigid chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will produce two separate signals. **Peaks = 2**.\n    *   **Camphor Scaffold Methylene and Methine Protons:**\n        *   There is one proton on the other bridgehead carbon (C4 in camphor numbering). This is a unique methine proton. **Peaks = 1**.\n        *   There is a methylene group at C5. The two protons (exo and endo) are in different spatial environments due to the rigid cage structure. They are diastereotopic and non-equivalent. **Peaks = 2**.\n        *   Similarly, there is a methylene group at C6. Its two protons (exo and endo) are also diastereotopic and non-equivalent. **Peaks = 2**. (Note: The C5 and C6 protons are also not equivalent to each other).\n\n**Step 5: Tally the Total Number of Expected Peaks**\nLet's sum up the peaks from all the unique proton environments.\n\n*   From the central benzene ring's methyl groups: **1 peak**\n*   From the -CH2- linker in one arm: **2 peaks**\n*   From the pyrazole proton in one arm: **1 peak**\n*   From the camphor methyl groups in one arm (1 + 2): **3 peaks**\n*   From the camphor CH and CH2 protons in one arm (1 + 2 + 2): **5 peaks**\n\nTotal Number of Peaks = (Central Core) + (Linker) + (Pyrazole H) + (Camphor Me's) + (Camphor CH/CH2's)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = **12**\n\nThus, a total of 12 distinct signals are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n*   Mesityl-CH3: 1 peak\n*   Linker -CH2-: 2 peaks\n*   Pyrazole-CH: 1 peak\n*   Camphor-C1-CH3: 1 peak\n*   Camphor-C7-(CH3)2: 2 peaks\n*   Camphor-C4-H: 1 peak\n*   Camphor-C5-H2: 2 peaks\n*   Camphor-C6-H2: 2 peaks\n*   **Total: 12 peaks**\n\n<<<H>>>"
