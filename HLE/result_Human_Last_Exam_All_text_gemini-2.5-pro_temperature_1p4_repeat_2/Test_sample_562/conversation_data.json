    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the Japanese character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the character 謄.**\nThe character 謄 is a composite kanji, formed by combining multiple elements. It has a left-right structure (左右構造, sayū kōzō).\n*   The left-hand component is: 言\n*   The right-hand component is: 朕\n\n**Step 2: Identify the radical (部首, bushu).**\nIn characters with a left-right structure, the left-hand component is very often the radical, as it serves to classify the character's meaning. The radical of 謄 is the left-hand part, 言. This radical, 言, is related to words, speech, and records, which is consistent with the meaning of 謄 (to copy, to transcribe).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the name of the radical.**\nRadicals often have specific names based on their form and position within a character.\n*   The radical itself is 言.\n*   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n*   The specific name for the 言 radical when it is on the left is \"gonben\" (ごんべん). This name comes from \"gon,\" the on'yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) of 言, and \"ben,\" a voiced form of \"hen.\"\n\n**Step 4: Transcribe the name into Hepburn romanization.**\nThe question requires the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n*   The Japanese name is ごんべん.\n*   In Hepburn romanization, this is written as \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Correctly identify the components:** It is crucial to see that the left part is 言 (word) and not a different radical like 月 (moon/flesh).\n2.  **Understand radical positioning:** The name of a radical can change depending on its position. While the base radical is 言 (iu), its name as a left-side component is \"gonben\".\n3.  **Follow naming conventions:** \"Gonben\" is the standard, conventional name for this radical form, used when looking up characters in a dictionary.\n4.  **Use correct romanization:** The answer must be in Hepburn transcription as requested.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the radical and its correct name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
