    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we will follow a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Decomposing the problem using the Künneth Formula\n\nThe first step is to relate the bounded cohomology of a product of groups, $T \\times T$, to the bounded cohomology of the individual group $T$. For bounded cohomology with field coefficients, there is a Künneth formula. For any two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, and any integer $n \\ge 0$, the following isomorphism holds for vector space dimensions:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R}) $$\nIn our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ (Thompson's group T) and $n=4$. So the formula becomes:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p=0}^{4} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^{4-p}(T, \\mathbb{R}) $$\nThis sum expands to:\n$$ \\dim H_b^0(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T) + \\dim H_b^1(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T) + \\dim H_b^2(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T) + \\dim H_b^3(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T) + \\dim H_b^4(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T) $$\nThus, the problem is reduced to finding the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$ in degrees 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n\n### Step 2: Determining the dimensions of $H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nWe need to find $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. This requires knowing key results about the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T.\n\n*   **Degree 0: $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})$**\n    For any non-empty group $G$, the degree 0 bounded cohomology with trivial real coefficients is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    $H_b^0(G, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{f: G^1 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\mid f \\text{ is constant and bounded}\\} \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n    Since T is non-empty, we have $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n*   **Degree 1: $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})$**\n    For any group $G$, the degree 1 bounded cohomology with trivial real coefficients is zero. A 1-cocycle is a homomorphism $f: G \\to \\mathbb{R}$. For it to be a bounded cocycle, the function $f$ must be bounded. The only bounded homomorphism from a group to $(\\mathbb{R},+)$ is the trivial homomorphism $f=0$. The 1-coboundaries are also 0. Thus, $H_b^1(G, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n    So, $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n*   **Degree 2: $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$**\n    Thompson's group $T$ acts on the circle $S^1$ as a group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms. This action gives rise to a special cohomology class called the Euler class. E. Ghys showed that there is a bounded representative of this class, called the bounded Euler class $e_b$. This class generates the second bounded cohomology group of $T$. A fundamental result states that $H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}$.\n    So, $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n\n*   **Degree 3 and higher: $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R})$ for $k \\ge 3$**\n    The computation of higher-degree bounded cohomology groups is generally very difficult. Initial research suggested these groups might be large. However, a definitive result was provided by M. Bucher and N. Monod in their 2011 paper \"A van Est isomorphism for groupoids, and the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T\". They proved that the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial real coefficients vanishes for all degrees greater than or equal to 3.\n    Theorem (Bucher-Monod, 2011): For $k \\ge 3$, $H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n    This implies:\n    $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Assembling the final calculation\n\nNow we substitute these dimensions back into the Künneth formula expansion.\n\nThe dimensions we found are:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n\nThe sum is:\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = (1 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 1)$\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0$\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 1. The non-trivial class in $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$ is the cup product of the pullbacks of the bounded Euler class from each factor. Let $\\pi_1, \\pi_2: T \\times T \\to T$ be the projections onto the first and second factors. Let $e_b \\in H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$ be the bounded Euler class. The generator of $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$ is the class $\\pi_1^*(e_b) \\cup \\pi_2^*(e_b)$."
