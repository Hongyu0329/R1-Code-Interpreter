    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step 1: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the Iliad\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of all geographical mountains that are explicitly named in Homer's *Iliad*. We must be careful to include only those mentioned in this specific epic.\n\n1.  **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is mentioned countless times throughout the epic. The question explicitly asks for the tallest mountain *after* Olympus, so we will note its height but exclude it from the final answer.\n2.  **Mount Ida (Trojan Ida):** This is a very prominent mountain in the *Iliad*, located near Troy. Zeus often sits on its peak (Gargarus) to watch the battle below, and it is the setting for his seduction by Hera in Book 14.\n3.  **The Peak of Samothrace:** In Book 13, the god Poseidon sits on the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the war, as it provides a clear view of Troy, Mount Ida, and the Achaean camp.\n4.  **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera's magical flight path from Olympus to Mount Ida takes her over several landmarks, including the peak of Mount Athos in northern Greece.\n5.  **Mount Pelion:** This mountain in Thessaly is mentioned as the source of the great ashen spear of Achilles, which was a gift to his father Peleus from the centaur Cheiron.\n6.  **Mount Tmolus:** Located in Lydia (modern-day Turkey), this mountain is mentioned in the \"Catalogue of Ships\" in Book 2 as the homeland of the Maeonians, who were allies of the Trojans.\n\n**Careful Point:** There are two famous mountains named Ida in Greek mythology: one near Troy (in Phrygia) and one on Crete. The *Iliad*'s narrative is exclusively concerned with the Trojan **Mount Ida**. While Crete is mentioned as the home of King Idomeneus, its highest mountain (also called Ida, modern Psiloritis, at 2,456 m) is not explicitly named in the *Iliad*. Therefore, we only consider the Trojan Ida for this analysis.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Modern Names and Elevations of These Mountains\n\nNext, we identify the modern names of these historical mountains and find their official elevations to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** Located in Greece. The highest peak is Mytikas.\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,918 meters (9,573 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Trojan):** Modern name is **Kaz Dağı**. Located in Turkey.\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Peak of Samothrace:** Modern name is **Fengari**. Located on the Greek island of Samothrace.\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet)\n*   **Mount Athos:** Located on a peninsula in northeastern Greece.\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece.\n    *   **Elevation:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Part of the modern **Bozdağlar** mountain range in Turkey.\n    *   **Elevation:** 2,159 meters (7,083 feet)\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Elevations and Determine the Tallest\n\nNow, we list the mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* (excluding Mount Olympus) in descending order of their height.\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus (Bozdağlar):** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Peak of Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBy comparing the elevations of all the historical mountains explicitly mentioned in the *Iliad*, the tallest after Mount Olympus is Mount Tmolus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
