    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Tangent Function\nThe tangent function, `tan(x)`, is a periodic function with a period of `π` (pi). This means that for any integer `k`, the following identity holds:\n`tan(x) = tan(x + kπ)`\nThis property is key to solving the problem because the input `x = 10^100` is an extremely large number. We can simplify the calculation by finding a much smaller, equivalent angle.\n\n### Step 2: Argument Reduction\nWe need to find the value of `10^100` modulo `π`. This is equivalent to finding a number `r` such that `10^100 = kπ + r`, where `k` is an integer and `r` is in a convenient range, typically `[0, π)`.\nThen, `tan(10^100) = tan(kπ + r) = tan(r)`.\n\nTo find `r`, we can calculate it as:\n`r = 10^100 - floor(10^100 / π) * π`\nThis expression can be simplified using the definition of the fractional part of a number, `{y} = y - floor(y)`.\nLet `y = 10^100 / π`. Then:\n`r = (y - floor(y)) * π = {y} * π = {10^100 / π} * π`\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the fractional part of `10^100 / π`, multiplying it by `π`, and then taking the tangent of the result.\n\n### Step 3: High-Precision Calculation of the Fractional Part\nTo find `{10^100 / π}`, we must consider the decimal expansion of `1/π`.\nLet the decimal expansion of `1/π` be `0.d_1 d_2 d_3 ...`.\nThen, `10^100 / π = 10^100 * (0.d_1 d_2 d_3 ...) = d_1 d_2 ... d_100 . d_101 d_102 ...`\n\nThe integer part of `10^100 / π` is the number formed by the first 100 digits of `1/π` after the decimal point. The fractional part of `10^100 / π` is the number `0.d_101 d_102 ...`, formed by the digits starting from the 101st decimal place.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is crucial to use a high-precision value of `1/π`. Standard approximations like `22/7` or `355/113` are completely inadequate. The error in these approximations, when multiplied by `10^100`, becomes an enormous number that invalidates the result. We must use a value of `1/π` accurate to more than 100 decimal places.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Necessary Digits of 1/π\nUsing a high-precision calculator or a reliable online source (like WolframAlpha or a mathematical software library), we can find the decimal expansion of `1/π`.\n\nThe expansion of `1/π` begins:\n`1/π ≈ 0.31830988618379067153...`\n\nWe need the digits starting from the 101st place. The sequence of digits of `1/π` up to the 110th place is:\n`0.3183098861 ... 8545313339` (first 100 digits) `4239912260` (digits 101 to 110) `...`\n\nFrom this, we can identify the fractional part we need:\n`f = {10^100 / π} ≈ 0.4239912260...`\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nNow we compute the reduced argument `r` and then its tangent.\n1.  **Calculate the reduced argument `r`**:\n    `r = f * π ≈ 0.4239912260 * 3.1415926536...`\n    `r ≈ 1.33202157` radians.\n\n2.  **Calculate the tangent of `r`**:\n    We need to compute `tan(r) = tan(1.33202157)`. Using a scientific calculator set to radians mode:\n    `tan(1.33202157) ≈ 4.07355018...`\n\n### Step 6: Identify the Final Answer\nThe result of `tan(10^100)` is approximately `4.07355018...`. The question asks for the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point). These are the digits in the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths places.\n\nThe digits are `0`, `7`, and `3`."
