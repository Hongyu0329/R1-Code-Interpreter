    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the Question and Identifying the Diagram\n\n1.  **Core Components**: The question specifies a Feynman diagram with:\n    *   **Two vertices**. In a perturbative expansion, using *n* vertices means we are considering the *n*-th order term of the interaction Lagrangian. Two vertices imply a second-order (`O(λ²)`) calculation.\n    *   **Four field contractions**. A field contraction in this context corresponds to a propagator, which is represented by a line in the diagram. So, the diagram has four lines.\n\n2.  **Determining the Theory and Diagram Topology**:\n    *   Let's assume a common scalar field theory, like `φ⁴` theory, where the interaction Lagrangian is `L_int = (λ/4!)φ⁴`. In this theory, each vertex has four \"legs\" or lines attached to it.\n    *   With two vertices, we have a total of `2 × 4 = 8` legs available from the vertices.\n    *   Four contractions (propagators) will use `4 × 2 = 8` legs, since each propagator connects two legs.\n    *   Since all 8 available legs are used for the four internal lines, there are no legs left over for external particles. This means the diagram is a **vacuum diagram** (or a vacuum bubble).\n    *   The only way to connect two 4-point vertices with four lines is for each of the four lines to connect the first vertex to the second vertex. This results in a diagram that looks like two points with four arcs running between them. This is sometimes called a \"sunset\" diagram, although that term is more common for the version with two external legs.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, `S`, of a Feynman diagram is a combinatorial integer that corrects for the overcounting of identical diagrams that are generated during the perturbative expansion (e.g., from expanding `exp(iS_int)`). It can be calculated by finding the number of permutations of the components of the diagram (vertices and internal lines) that leave the diagram topologically unchanged. `S` is the order of the automorphism group of the graph.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe count the number of ways we can relabel the vertices and lines without changing the diagram's structure.\n\n1.  **Vertex Permutation**:\n    *   The diagram consists of two vertices, let's call them V1 and V2.\n    *   These two vertices are topologically equivalent. If we swap the labels of V1 and V2, the diagram looks exactly the same (the four lines that connected V1 to V2 now connect V2 to V1).\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is `2! = 2`.\n    *   **Contribution to S: 2**\n\n2.  **Internal Line Permutation**:\n    *   The diagram has four internal lines (propagators) connecting the two vertices.\n    *   These four lines are also topologically equivalent. We can swap any of these lines with any other, and the overall diagram remains unchanged.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n    *   **Contribution to S: 24**\n\n3.  **Other Symmetries**:\n    *   There are no lines that connect a vertex to itself (tadpoles), so we don't need to consider the symmetry of flipping the ends of such a line.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Final Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the contributions from each independent symmetry operation.\n\n*   `S = (Factor from permuting vertices) × (Factor from permuting internal lines)`\n*   `S = 2! × 4!`\n*   `S = 2 × 24`\n*   `S = 48`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy identifying the diagram as a two-vertex, four-propagator vacuum bubble in `φ⁴` theory and counting the permutations of its identical vertices and internal lines, we arrive at the total symmetry factor.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe symmetry factor `S` is the product of the orders of the permutation groups for equivalent components.\n*   Number of equivalent vertices = 2. Permutation factor = `2! = 2`.\n*   Number of equivalent internal lines connecting these vertices = 4. Permutation factor = `4! = 24`.\n*   Total symmetry factor `S = 2 × 24 = 48`.\n\n<<<48>>>"
