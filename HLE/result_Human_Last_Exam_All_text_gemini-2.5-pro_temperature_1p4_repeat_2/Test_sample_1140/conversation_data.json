    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question\n\n1.  **Molecule to Synthesize:** A peptide.\n2.  **Length:** 100 amino acids (aa). This is a moderately long peptide, often referred to as a small protein.\n3.  **Key Feature:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), 'X', which is specified as azido phenylalanine (AzF).\n4.  **Goal:** Identify the *most helpful* technique for this synthesis.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Constraints and Key Features\n\n1.  **The Unnatural Amino Acid (AzF):** This is the most critical constraint. Standard biological systems (like *E. coli* or yeast used in recombinant expression) do not have the genetic code or the molecular machinery (tRNA, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase) to incorporate AzF into a growing peptide chain. This immediately rules out standard recombinant protein expression by itself.\n2.  **The Peptide Length (100aa):** This length poses a significant challenge for purely chemical synthesis methods.\n    *   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** The standard chemical method. It adds amino acids one by one. The efficiency of each step (coupling) is critical. For a 100aa peptide, there are 99 coupling steps. Even with an excellent 99% efficiency per step, the theoretical maximum yield would be (0.99)^99 â‰ˆ 37%. In practice, yields are lower, and the final product is a complex mixture containing many truncated \"deletion\" sequences, making purification extremely difficult. Therefore, SPPS alone is not an ideal or \"most helpful\" method for a peptide of this length.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate Potential Techniques\n\nGiven the limitations of standard methods, we must consider advanced or hybrid techniques.\n\n*   **A) Standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):**\n    *   **Pros:** Can easily incorporate any UAA, as long as a protected form of it is available (which it is for AzF).\n    *   **Cons:** Not suitable for a 100aa peptide due to low cumulative yield and difficult purification. It is not the *most* helpful choice.\n\n*   **B) Standard Recombinant Protein Expression:**\n    *   **Pros:** Excellent for producing long, natural proteins with high yield and purity.\n    *   **Cons:** Cannot incorporate the unnatural amino acid AzF. This method is fundamentally incompatible with the goal.\n\n*   **C) Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):**\n    *   **How it works:** This is a semi-synthetic approach. The 100aa peptide is broken into smaller fragments. At least one fragment (the one containing AzF) is made using chemical synthesis (SPPS). The other fragment(s) can be made via SPPS or, more efficiently, via recombinant expression. The fragments are then chemically joined (\"ligated\") together.\n    *   **Analysis:** This is a viable and powerful technique. For example, one could synthesize a ~20aa N-terminal fragment containing AzF via SPPS (which is highly efficient for this short length) and produce the remaining ~80aa C-terminal fragment recombinantly. While powerful, it is a multi-step process involving: 1. Synthesis of fragment A. 2. Synthesis of fragment B. 3. Purification of both fragments. 4. Chemical ligation reaction. 5. Final purification. It can be complex to execute.\n\n*   **D) Genetic Code Expansion (often via Amber/Stop Codon Suppression):**\n    *   **How it works:** This is a sophisticated modification of recombinant expression. The host organism (*E. coli*, yeast, etc.) is engineered to handle the UAA.\n        1.  An **orthogonal tRNA-synthetase pair** is introduced. This new synthetase specifically recognizes the UAA (AzF) and attaches it to the new tRNA. This pair does not interfere with the cell's normal machinery.\n        2.  A codon in the gene of interest is mutated to a stop codon (e.g., UAG, the amber codon). In this case, the codon for position 'X' would be changed to UAG.\n        3.  The engineered tRNA is designed to recognize this UAG stop codon.\n        4.  When the cells are grown in media containing AzF, the ribosome reads the gene. When it encounters the UAG codon, instead of stopping, the engineered tRNA delivers AzF, which is incorporated into the peptide. The rest of the peptide is synthesized normally.\n    *   **Analysis:** This technique was developed specifically for this type of problem. It leverages the high efficiency of ribosomal synthesis for the entire 100aa peptide while enabling the site-specific incorporation of a single UAA. For a 100aa peptide with one UAA, this is arguably the most direct and efficient method.\n\n### Step 4: Final Comparison and Conclusion\n\n*   **SPPS** is too inefficient for this length.\n*   **Standard Recombinant Expression** cannot incorporate the UAA.\n*   **NCL** is a very good, but multi-step, semi-synthetic alternative.\n*   **Genetic Code Expansion** is a single, \"in-vivo\" biological process that directly produces the desired full-length peptide containing the UAA. It is highly specific and efficient for this exact scenario.\n\nTherefore, **Genetic Code Expansion** is the *most helpful* and elegant solution for synthesizing a 100aa peptide with a single, site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine.\n\n<<<Genetic Code Expansion (via stop codon suppression)>>>"
