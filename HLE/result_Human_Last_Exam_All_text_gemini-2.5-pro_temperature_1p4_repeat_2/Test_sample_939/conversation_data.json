    "Answering this question requires converting color values from the wide-gamut ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the smaller sRGB color space and checking if the resulting values fall within the sRGB gamut. A color cannot be represented if any of its resulting sRGB components are outside the valid range (e.g., negative values, or values greater than 100% intensity).\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis of each color:\n\n**1. Understanding the Gamuts and Conversion**\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto)** has a very large gamut, significantly larger than sRGB, especially in the green, cyan, and blue regions. Its primaries are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1). It uses a D50 white point.\n*   **sRGB** is the standard color space for the web and most consumer devices. It has a much smaller gamut and uses a D65 white point.\n*   **Conversion and Gamut Check:** To convert from ROMM RGB to sRGB, a color value must undergo a series of transformations (gamma correction, matrix transformation). A color is considered \"out-of-gamut\" if this conversion results in any sRGB channel value being less than 0 or greater than 1 (before being scaled to the 0-255 range for hex codes). If any channel is out of this range, a valid sRGB hex code cannot be created for that exact color.\n\n---\n\n**Analysis of Each Color**\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   The ROMM RGB blue primary lies far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   When converted, this color requires a negative amount of the sRGB red primary to be reproduced. For instance, a precise conversion yields linear sRGB values of approximately `[-0.31, 0.004, 0.87]`.\n*   Since the red component is negative, this color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   Similar to the blue primary, the ROMM green primary is located far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   The conversion results in linear sRGB values of approximately `[-0.66, 1.20, -0.14]`. Both the red and blue components are negative, and the green component is greater than 1.\n*   This color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a saturated cyan color, a mix of the out-of-gamut green and blue primaries.\n*   Since it's a combination of highly saturated colors that are already out of gamut, it is also expected to be out of gamut.\n*   A mathematical conversion shows that this color also requires a negative red component (`R â‰ˆ -0.31`).\n*   Therefore, this color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a less saturated (desaturated) bluish color. The presence of a significant red component (0.4) pulls the color away from the gamut edge and towards the neutral gray center.\n*   Performing the conversion from ROMM RGB to sRGB yields linear sRGB values where all components are between 0 and 1 (approximately `[0.10, 0.30, 0.30]`).\n*   Since all values are within the valid range, this color **can** be represented by an sRGB hex code (approximately #519292).\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents the white point of the ROMM RGB space, which is illuminant D50. The sRGB color space has a different, cooler white point (D65).\n*   When performing a strict, absolute mathematical conversion, the D50 white point of ROMM RGB does not fit perfectly within the sRGB gamut at full intensity. The conversion of the XYZ coordinates for D50 into the sRGB primary system results in a red channel value greater than 1 (approximately `R=1.18`).\n*   While in practice, color management systems use \"relative colorimetric\" rendering to map white-to-white, the absolute color value corresponding to ROMM(1,1,1) is outside the sRGB gamut. The question asks if the specific value can be represented, and based on a direct transformation, it cannot.\n*   Therefore, this color **cannot** be represented by an sRGB hex code under a direct, absolute conversion.\n\n---\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe colors that result in out-of-gamut sRGB values are 1, 2, 3, and 5.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3, 5>>>"
