    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Terms in the Question**\n\n    *   **Upper Semilattice ($J$)**: An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) in which any two elements have a *least upper bound* (also known as a supremum or join). If `a, b` are in `J`, their join is denoted `a ∨ b`. When viewed as a category, there is a unique morphism `j₁ → j₂` if and only if `j₁ ≤ j₂`. The existence of a join for any two elements means that the category `J` has coproducts for any pair of objects.\n\n    *   **Category of Vector Spaces ($\\text{Vect}_K$)**: This is the category where objects are vector spaces over a field $K$, and morphisms are $K$-linear maps.\n\n    *   **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$)**: Such a functor is also known as a *representation of the poset J*. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j₁) \\to f(j₂)$ for every relation $j₁ ≤ j₂$, in a way that respects composition (i.e., if $j₁ ≤ j₂ ≤ j₃$, the map for $j₁ ≤ j₃$ is the composition of the maps for $j₁ ≤ j₂$ and $j₂ ≤ j₃$).\n\n    *   **Tame Functor**: The term \"tame\" refers to the representation type of the category of functors `Fun(J, Vect_K)`. A category of modules (or functors, in this case) is of *tame representation type* if, for any dimension `d`, the indecomposable objects of dimension `d` can be classified and fall into a finite number of discrete objects and a finite number of one-parameter families. This is contrasted with *wild representation type*, which is considered intractable. The question's wording \"a tame functor\" is standard phrasing for \"any functor $f$ where the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is of tame representation type\".\n\n    *   **n-resolvable**: A functor $f$ is called `n`-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most `n`. That is, there exists an exact sequence of functors:\n        $$ 0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0 $$\n        where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. This condition is equivalent to saying that the projective dimension of $f$, denoted `proj dim(f)`, is less than or equal to `n`. The question asks for the smallest integer `n` such that *every* functor on a tame upper semilattice `J` is `n`-resolvable. This is equivalent to finding the supremum of the projective dimensions of all functors over all tame upper semilattices.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts**\n\n    The core of the problem is to connect the *representation type* (tameness) of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` for an upper semilattice `J` with the *homological properties* (specifically, the projective dimension) of the functors in that category.\n\n    *   The projective dimension of any functor `f` is bounded by the global dimension of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)`. So, the question is effectively asking for the maximum possible global dimension of `Fun(J, Vect_K)` for a tame upper semilattice `J`.\n\n    *   This problem has been studied in the representation theory of algebras and posets, particularly by Daniel Simson. There is a deep theorem that provides a precise characterization of tame upper semilattices in homological terms.\n\n3.  **The Key Theorem**\n\n    A crucial result from the work of Simson states:\n\n    **Theorem:** Let $J$ be an upper semilattice. The category of functors `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is of tame representation type if and only if the projective dimension of every indecomposable functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is at most 2.\n    \n    (I.e., `proj dim(f) ≤ 2` for all indecomposable $f$.)\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to the Question**\n\n    *   Any functor $F: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ can be written as a direct sum of indecomposable functors: $F = \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} f_i$.\n    *   The projective dimension of a direct sum is the supremum of the projective dimensions of its summands: `proj dim(F) = sup_{i \\in I} {proj dim(f_i)}`.\n    *   According to the theorem, if $J$ is a tame upper semilattice, then for each indecomposable summand $f_i$, we have `proj dim(f_i) ≤ 2`.\n    *   Therefore, for any functor $F$ on a tame upper semilattice $J$, its projective dimension is also at most 2.\n    *   This means that any such functor $F$ is **2-resolvable**. So, $n=2$ is an upper bound.\n\n5.  **Showing the Bound is Sharp**\n\n    To show that $n=2$ is the answer, we must demonstrate that the bound is sharp. This requires finding an example of an upper semilattice `J` which is of tame representation type, and a functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ such that `proj dim(f) = 2`.\n\n    *   Consider the poset $J$ with four elements $\\{a, b, c, d\\}$ and relations $a < b$, $a < c$, $b < d$, and $c < d$. This is often called the \"diamond\" poset.\n\n    *   **Is $J$ an upper semilattice?**\n        *   Joins of comparable elements are trivial (e.g., $a ∨ b = b$).\n        *   The only pair of incomparable elements is $\\{b, c\\}$. Their least upper bound is $d$. So, $b ∨ c = d$.\n        *   Yes, $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n\n    *   **Is $J$ of tame representation type?**\n        The representation type of a poset is determined by the subposets it contains. The diamond poset $J$ does not contain any of the critical posets that characterize wild or finite representation type. In fact, it is known to be of **finite representation type**, which is a special (and stronger) case of tame representation type. Therefore, $J$ is a tame upper semilattice.\n\n    *   **What is the projective dimension of functors on $J$?**\n        The global dimension of the category `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is equal to the maximal length of a chain in the poset $J$.\n        *   The chains in $J$ are, for example, $a < b < d$ and $a < c < d$.\n        *   The length of a chain $x_0 < x_1 < \\dots < x_m$ is $m$.\n        *   The maximal length of a chain in $J$ is 2.\n        *   Therefore, the global dimension of `Fun(J, Vect_K)` is 2. This means there exists at least one functor $f$ with `proj dim(f) = 2`. For instance, the simple functor $S_d$ associated with the maximal element $d$ has `proj dim(S_d) = 2$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n\n    *   We have established that for any functor $f$ on a tame upper semilattice $J$, its projective dimension is at most 2.\n    *   We have found a concrete example of a tame upper semilattice for which there exists a functor with projective dimension exactly 2.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest integer $n$ for which any tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is `n`-resolvable is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n<<<2>>>"
