    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\nThe question asks about a specific painting: a self-portrait by Curt Querner from 1933. It provides the context that the portrait was painted after he escaped the Gestapo. The core of the question is to identify the object he holds in his hand and understand its symbolic meaning as an act of resistance.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the historical context.**\nCurt Querner was a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement. He was also a member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). After the Nazis came to power in 1933, they began persecuting political opponents. Querner was arrested by the Gestapo in March 1933 and briefly imprisoned. He painted the self-portrait after his release. The premise of the question is historically accurate.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the painting and the object.**\nThe painting in question is Querner's \"Selbstbildnis mit Spachtel\" (Self-Portrait with Spatula). As the German title suggests, the object he is holding in his right hand is a painter's spatula or palette knife.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the symbolic meaning of the object.**\nTo understand the symbolism, we must consider the context.\n*   **Assertion of Identity:** The Nazi regime sought to control art and culture, labeling styles like Querner's as \"degenerate art.\" By painting himself with the primary tool of his craft, Querner defiantly reasserts his identity as an artist.\n*   **Tool as a Weapon:** He holds the spatula firmly, almost like a weapon, not just a tool. His gaze is direct and confrontational. This suggests that his art is his form of struggle. While he cannot fight the regime with physical force, he can resist through his creative work. The spatula is the instrument of this artistic and intellectual resistance.\n*   **Unbroken Will:** Having just been released from Gestapo custody, this self-portrait is a powerful statement of an unbroken spirit. It declares his intention to continue painting and expressing his worldview, regardless of the persecution he faced.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a painter's spatula. It symbolizes his resistance by representing his art as his weapon and his defiant, unbroken will to continue his work as an artist in the face of Nazi oppression.\n\n<<<A painter's spatula (or palette knife).>>>"
