    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and the Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) on a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane indicates that the two substituents (bromine and methyl) are *cis* to each other.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOtBu). This is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n*   **Solvent:** tert-butyl alcohol (tBuOH). This is the conjugate acid of the base, and as a solvent, it favors elimination reactions over substitution reactions.\n*   **Conclusion:** A secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong, bulky base will undergo an **E2 elimination** reaction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Stereochemical Requirement of the E2 Reaction**\n*   A crucial requirement for the E2 mechanism is that the leaving group (Br) and the proton (H) on the adjacent carbon (beta-carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** conformation.\n*   For a cyclohexane ring, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement. The leaving group must be in an axial position, and the beta-proton being removed must also be in an axial position on an adjacent carbon, oriented in the opposite direction (e.g., one axial-up, one axial-down).\n\n**Step 3: Draw and Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nSince the bromine and methyl groups are *cis*, in any chair conformation, one must be axial and the other equatorial.\n\n*   **Conformer A:** The bulkier methyl group occupies the more stable equatorial position, which forces the bromine atom into the axial position. This is the **more stable and major conformer** in the equilibrium mixture.\n    *   Methyl group (CH₃): Equatorial\n    *   Bromine (Br): Axial\n\n*   **Conformer B:** The bromine atom occupies the equatorial position, and the methyl group is in the axial position. This is the **less stable and minor conformer**.\n    *   Methyl group (CH₃): Axial\n    *   Bromine (Br): Equatorial\n\n**Step 4: Determine which Conformer Can Undergo Elimination**\n*   **Conformer A (Axial Br):** Because the bromine is axial, it can be anti-periplanar to axial beta-protons. There are two adjacent carbons (beta-carbons) with protons: C2 and C6. Both C2 and C6 have axial protons that are trans-diaxial to the axial bromine. Therefore, **Conformer A can undergo E2 elimination**.\n*   **Conformer B (Equatorial Br):** An equatorial leaving group cannot achieve an anti-periplanar arrangement with any beta-protons. Therefore, **Conformer B cannot undergo E2 elimination directly**.\n\nThe reaction must proceed through the more stable and reactive Conformer A.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Regioselectivity (Which Product is Major?)**\nStarting from Conformer A (axial Br, equatorial CH₃), there are two possible elimination pathways:\n\n*   **Pathway 1 (Zaitsev elimination):** Removal of the axial proton from C2. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C2, giving **1-methylcyclohexene**. This is the more substituted (trisubstituted) and thermodynamically more stable alkene (the Zaitsev product). However, the proton on C2 is sterically hindered by the adjacent equatorial methyl group.\n\n*   **Pathway 2 (Hofmann elimination):** Removal of the axial proton from C6. This leads to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6, giving **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted (disubstituted) and thermodynamically less stable alkene (the Hofmann product). The proton on C6 is sterically unhindered.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the Bulky Base Rule**\n*   The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a very bulky base.\n*   Bulky bases have difficulty accessing sterically hindered protons. They preferentially attack the most accessible, least hindered proton.\n*   Comparing the two pathways, the proton on C6 is much more accessible than the proton on C2.\n*   Therefore, the bulky tert-butoxide will preferentially remove the proton from C6, leading to the Hofmann product as the **major product**.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\nThe reaction produces 3-methylcyclohexene as the major product and 1-methylcyclohexene as the minor product. The question asks for the product, which is generally interpreted as the major product.\n\nThe name of the major product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
