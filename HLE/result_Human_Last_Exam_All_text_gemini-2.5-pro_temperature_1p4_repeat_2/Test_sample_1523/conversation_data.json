    "This problem asks for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field within the framework of finite-temperature field theory. Let's break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Framework:** The context is **finite-temperature field theory (FTFT)**. This implies we will be working in Euclidean spacetime with a compact imaginary time direction.\n2.  **Field:** We are considering a **neutral scalar field**, denoted by $\\phi$. Being \"neutral\" (or real) imposes a specific condition on its Fourier transform.\n3.  **Object of Interest:** We need to find the **inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$**. This involves identifying three things:\n    *   The definition of the inner product in this context.\n    *   The operator $D$. The subscript $\\phi$ in $D_\\phi$ is likely a typo for $D\\phi$, meaning the operator $D$ acting on the field $\\phi$.\n    *   The expression for this inner product.\n4.  **Context:** The inner product is sought \"in the functional integral representation of the partition function\". This tells us that the operator $D$ is the one that appears in the quadratic part of the action for the field $\\phi$, as the partition function $Z$ is defined by $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$, where $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Euclidean vs. Minkowski Space:** In FTFT, calculations are performed in Euclidean spacetime where the metric is diagonal $(+,+,+,+)$. The time coordinate is imaginary, $\\tau = it$, and is periodic with period $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature.\n*   **Periodicity of Fields:** For a bosonic field like the scalar $\\phi$, it must be periodic in imaginary time: $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\tau + \\beta, \\mathbf{x})$. This leads to discrete Matsubara frequencies in the Fourier expansion.\n*   **The Operator D:** The operator $D$ is found by writing the action $S_E[\\phi]$ in the form $\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\phi D \\phi$. This often requires an integration by parts, where boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity of $\\phi$.\n*   **Inner Product Definition:** The inner product $(f, g)$ for fields in this context is naturally defined by the integration measure of the action: $(f,g) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, f(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})g(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$.\n*   **Fourier Transform Conventions:** Factors of $T$, $\\beta$, and $(2\\pi)$ in Fourier transforms can differ between conventions. It's crucial to be consistent. A standard convention is:\n    *   $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$\n    *   $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies.\n*   **Reality Condition:** For a real scalar field $\\phi$, its Fourier transform $\\tilde{\\phi}$ must satisfy the condition $\\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p}) = \\tilde{\\phi}(-\\omega_n, -\\mathbf{p})$.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n**Step 1: The Partition Function and the Euclidean Action**\nThe partition function $Z$ for a neutral scalar field at temperature $T=1/\\beta$ is given by the functional integral:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\nThe Euclidean action for a free scalar field with mass $m$ is:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\mathcal{L}_E = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Operator D**\nWe can rewrite the action to identify the operator $D$. The kinetic term is $(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)(\\partial_\\mu\\phi)$. We integrate this by parts:\n$\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_\\mu\\phi)^2 = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial_\\mu \\phi) - \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\mu^2 \\phi)$\nThe first term is a boundary term. It vanishes because fields go to zero at spatial infinity and are periodic in imaginary time $\\tau$. Therefore:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2] \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\nComparing this to the general form $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$, we identify the operator $D$ as:\n$D = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2 = -(\\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2) + m^2$\n\n**Step 3: Defining and Writing the Inner Product in Coordinate Space**\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ is given by:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) (D \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}))$\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\nabla^2 + m^2] \\phi$\nFrom Step 2, we see this is simply twice the Euclidean action: $(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$. Explicitly:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 4: Transforming to Momentum Space (Matsubara Formalism)**\nTo get a more explicit expression, we represent the field in terms of its Fourier modes:\n$\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = T \\sum_n \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} e^{i(\\omega_n \\tau + \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{x})} \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$\nwhere $p = (\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$ is the Euclidean 4-momentum and $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the Matsubara frequencies for a boson.\n\nIn this basis, the differential operator $D$ becomes an algebraic operator. The derivatives act on the plane waves as $\\partial_\\tau \\to i\\omega_n$ and $\\nabla \\to i\\mathbf{p}$. So, the operator $D$ in momentum space multiplies each mode $\\tilde{\\phi}(p)$ by its corresponding eigenvalue:\n$D(p) = (i\\omega_n)^2 (\\text{from } -\\partial_\\tau^2) + (i\\mathbf{p})^2 (\\text{from } -\\nabla^2) + m^2 = \\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2$\n\n**Step 5: Final Expression in Momentum Space**\nUsing Parseval's theorem for the Fourier transform in FTFT, the inner product in coordinate space can be written as a sum/integral in momentum space. For the inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int \\phi^* (D\\phi)$:\n*   The Fourier transform of $\\phi$ is $\\tilde{\\phi}(p)$.\n*   The Fourier transform of $D\\phi$ is $D(p)\\tilde{\\phi}(p) = (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2)\\tilde{\\phi}(p)$.\nThe inner product becomes:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p}) (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$\nUsing the reality condition for the field $\\phi$, which is $\\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p}) = \\tilde{\\phi}(-\\omega_n, -\\mathbf{p})$, the final expression is:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{\\phi}(-\\omega_n, -\\mathbf{p}) (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$\nThis is the quadratic form that appears in the action, $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, when expressed in momentum space. It represents the sum of the energies of all the harmonic modes of the field, where each mode's contribution is weighted by its amplitude squared.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ in the momentum space representation is given by the expression:\n$T \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int \\frac{d^3p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p}) (\\omega_n^2 + \\mathbf{p}^2 + m^2) \\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies, $\\mathbf{p}$ is the spatial momentum, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, and $\\tilde{\\phi}(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p})$ is the Fourier transform of the field $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$. For a real scalar field, the reality condition $\\tilde{\\phi}^*(\\omega_n, \\mathbf{p}) = \\tilde{\\phi}(-\\omega_n, -\\mathbf{p})$ holds.>>>"
