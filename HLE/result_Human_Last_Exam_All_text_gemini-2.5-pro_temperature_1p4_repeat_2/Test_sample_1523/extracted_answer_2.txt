The inner product $(\phi, D\phi)$ in the momentum space representation is given by the expression:
$T \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \int \frac{d^3p}{(2\pi)^3} \tilde{\phi}^*(\omega_n, \mathbf{p}) (\omega_n^2 + \mathbf{p}^2 + m^2) \tilde{\phi}(\omega_n, \mathbf{p})$
where $T$ is the temperature, $\omega_n = 2\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies, $\mathbf{p}$ is the spatial momentum, $m$ is the mass of the scalar field, and $\tilde{\phi}(\omega_n, \mathbf{p})$ is the Fourier transform of the field $\phi(\tau, \mathbf{x})$. For a real scalar field, the reality condition $\tilde{\phi}^*(\omega_n, \mathbf{p}) = \tilde{\phi}(-\omega_n, -\mathbf{p})$ holds.
