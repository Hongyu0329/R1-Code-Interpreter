    "An equilibrium of the system is a point $X = (X_1, \\dots, X_N)$ such that $\\dot{X_i} = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. The equations are:\n$$ \\dot{X_i} = R_i X_i \\left(1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}\\right) + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_i R_j X_i X_j = 0 $$\nThis equation can be factored as:\n$$ \\dot{X_i} = X_i \\left[ R_i \\left(1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}\\right) + \\frac{\\Gamma R_i}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j \\right] = 0 $$\nAn equilibrium point is therefore characterized by the set of species with non-zero abundance. Let $S$ be the set of indices of species with positive abundance at equilibrium ($X_i > 0$ for $i \\in S$), and $S^c$ be the set of species with zero abundance ($X_k = 0$ for $k \\in S^c$).\n\nFor any species $i \\in S$, we must have $X_i > 0$, so the term in the brackets must be zero. Since $R_i \\ge 1$, we can divide by it:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j = 0 $$\nSince $X_j=0$ for $j \\in S^c$, the sum is only over $j \\in S$:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j = 0 \\quad (*)$$\nThis is a system of $|S|$ equations for the $|S|$ unknowns $\\{X_i\\}_{i \\in S}$. This system can be shown to have at most one solution for any given set of parameters.\n\nThe question asks for the number of equilibria that can exist as parameters vary. This can be interpreted as finding the number of distinct types of equilibria, classified by their set of surviving species $S$, that can be realized by choosing appropriate parameter values. We will show that for any subset $S \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, we can find parameters $(R_i, K_i, A_i, \\Gamma)$ such that there exists a stable equilibrium where the surviving species are precisely the ones in $S$.\n\nStep 1: The trivial equilibrium.\nLet $S = \\emptyset$. This corresponds to the equilibrium $X_i = 0$ for all $i$. Substituting into the equations, we get $\\dot{X_i} = 0$. So, the trivial equilibrium always exists. This gives one possible equilibrium type.\n\nStep 2: Full coexistence.\nLet $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. We want all species to coexist. A simple way to achieve this is to remove the competitive interactions between different species. Let's choose the parameters $A_i$ to be all equal, for example, $A_i = 1$ for all $i$. Then $(A_i - A_j) = 0$ for all $i,j$. The system of equations simplifies to:\n$$ \\dot{X_i} = R_i X_i \\left(1 - \\frac{X_i}{K_i}\\right) $$\nThis system has a coexistence equilibrium at $X_i = K_i$ for all $i$. Since we must have $X_i > 0$, this requires $K_i > 0$. The problem statement specifies $K_i \\ge 1$, so this is satisfied. Thus, an equilibrium with all species coexisting is possible.\n\nStep 3: Any proper non-empty subset of species.\nLet $S$ be any proper non-empty subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. We want to show that we can choose parameters such that the species in $S$ form a stable community, while species in $S^c$ die out.\n\nLet's define a specific set of parameters for a given $S$:\n1.  Set $A_i = 2$ for all $i \\in S$.\n2.  Set $A_k = 1$ for all $k \\in S^c$.\n3.  Set $R_i = 1$ and $K_i = 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n4.  Set $\\Gamma = N$.\n\nNow, we check if an equilibrium with survivor set $S$ exists and is valid for this choice of parameters.\nFor an equilibrium with survivor set $S$, the abundances $X_i$ for $i \\in S$ are given by equation $(*)$:\n$$ 1 - X_i + \\frac{N}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (A_i - A_j) X_j = 0 $$\nFor our choice of parameters, for any $i, j \\in S$, we have $A_i=A_j=2$. So $(A_i-A_j)=0$. The equation becomes:\n$$ 1 - X_i = 0 \\implies X_i = 1 $$\nSo, the candidate equilibrium point is $X_i=1$ for $i \\in S$ and $X_k=0$ for $k \\in S^c$. Since $X_i=1>0$, this part is consistent.\n\nNow we must check the stability condition for the extinct species. For any species $k \\in S^c$, its population must not be able to grow from a very small abundance. The initial growth rate of species $k$ in the presence of the community $S$ is given by the sign of the term in brackets of the dynamical equation, evaluated at $X_k=0$ and $X_i=1$ for $i \\in S$:\n$$ \\text{Growth Rate}_k = R_k \\left(1 - \\frac{0}{K_k}\\right) + \\frac{\\Gamma R_k}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (A_k - A_j) R_j X_j $$\nUsing our chosen parameters ($R_k=1, K_k=1, \\Gamma=N, R_j=1, X_j=1, A_k=1, A_j=2$):\n$$ \\text{Growth Rate}_k = 1 \\cdot(1) + \\frac{N \\cdot 1}{N} \\sum_{j \\in S} (1 - 2) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1 + \\sum_{j \\in S} (-1) $$\nLet $|S|=s$ be the number of species in $S$.\n$$ \\text{Growth Rate}_k = 1 - s $$\nFor the equilibrium to be valid, this growth rate must be non-positive, i.e., $1 - s \\le 0$, which means $s \\ge 1$. Since we are considering non-empty sets $S$, this condition is always satisfied.\n\nTherefore, for any non-empty proper subset $S$, we have found a set of parameters for which an equilibrium with exactly the species in $S$ exists.\n\nConclusion:\nWe have shown that for any of the $2^N$ possible subsets $S$ of the $N$ species, we can choose parameter values such that an equilibrium exists where the set of species with positive abundance is precisely $S$.\n- If $S=\\emptyset$, the trivial equilibrium $X_i=0$ for all $i$ exists.\n- If $S=\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$, we can choose all $A_i$ to be equal, leading to the coexistence equilibrium $X_i=K_i$.\n- If $S$ is any of the $2^N-2$ proper non-empty subsets, we showed a constructive method to find parameters that realize it as an equilibrium.\n\nThus, there are $2^N$ possible types of equilibria, where each type is defined by the set of coexisting species. The question \"how many equilibria can exist as parameters vary\" asks for the total number of such possible configurations.\n\nThe final answer is $2^N$."
