    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the subject of the question:** The question is about Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, who was the President of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015.\n2.  **Analyze the name used in the question:** The question states the name as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\".\n3.  **Verify the official name:** The first crucial point is to verify Goodluck Jonathan's actual and full name. According to all official records, biographies, and public information, his full name is **Goodluck Ebele Ogbonna Jonathan**.\n4.  **Identify the name \"Azikiwe\":** The name \"Azikiwe\" is the surname of a different, prominent Nigerian political figure, **Nnamdi Azikiwe**, who was the first President of Nigeria. There is no familial or official link that resulted in Goodluck Jonathan adopting \"Azikiwe\" as part of his name.\n5.  **Search for evidence:** The next step is to search for any credible public record, news report, or official statement where Goodluck Jonathan identified himself as, or added the name, \"Azikiwe\". A thorough search of news archives, official government documents, and biographical sources yields no such event.\n6.  **Conclusion on the premise:** The premise of the question is based on incorrect information. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never officially or publicly used the name \"Azikiwe\" as part of his own name. Therefore, there is no year in which he would have publicly identified himself as such.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinct Identities:** It is essential to distinguish between two separate individuals: Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. They are from different generations and have no known family ties that would lead to a name change.\n*   **Accuracy of Names:** The question's validity hinges on the accuracy of the name provided. Since the name is incorrect, the event described could not have happened.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** In this case, the lack of any evidence from reputable sources is conclusive. There are no records of him ever being referred to as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" in any official capacity.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the event described in the question—Goodluck Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never occurred because \"Azikiwe\" is not, and has never been, a part of his name.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\". His full name is Goodluck Ebele Ogbonna Jonathan. The premise of the question is incorrect.>>>"
