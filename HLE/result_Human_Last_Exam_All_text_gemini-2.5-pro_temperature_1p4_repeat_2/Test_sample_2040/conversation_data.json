    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the core concepts\n\n*   **Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC):** This is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical phenomenon. In SPDC, a high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear optical material and is converted into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons). Energy and momentum are conserved in this process.\n*   **Requirement for SPDC:** For SPDC to occur, the material must possess a significant **second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility**, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two). This property describes how the material's polarization responds nonlinearly to the square of an incident electric field.\n*   **Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** This is a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer of boron atoms, analogous to graphene. Borophene can exist in various atomic arrangements, known as polymorphs (e.g., $\\beta_{12}$-sheet, $\\chi_{3}$-sheet, etc.). We need to analyze its properties to determine if it can have a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the condition for a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$\n\nThe most fundamental rule governing whether a material can have a non-zero bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is its **crystal symmetry**.\n\n*   **Inversion Symmetry:** In materials that possess **inversion symmetry** (i.e., they are centrosymmetric), the bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $\\chi^{(2)}$, is strictly zero. A material has inversion symmetry if, for every atom at a position `(x, y, z)`, there is an identical atom at `(-x, -y, -z)` relative to a central point.\n*   **Physical Reason:** In a centrosymmetric material, applying an electric field `E` and its opposite `-E` results in equal but opposite polarization responses. However, a second-order effect depends on `E^2`. Since `(E)^2 = (-E)^2`, the nonlinear polarization must be the same for both `E` and `-E`. The only way to satisfy both conditions is if the second-order polarization is zero. Therefore, second-order effects like SPDC and second-harmonic generation (SHG) are forbidden in the bulk of centrosymmetric materials.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the crystal symmetry of boron nanosheets\n\nTo answer the question, we must determine if the common, stable structures of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric.\n\n*   **Borophene Polymorphs:** Theoretical calculations and experimental synthesis (typically on substrates) have identified several stable borophene structures. The most commonly discussed free-standing structures include the planar $\\alpha$-sheet and the buckled $\\beta_{12}$-sheet.\n*   **Symmetry of Common Polymorphs:**\n    *   The **$\\beta_{12}$-sheet**, which is one of the most stable and experimentally relevant structures, has the space group *Pmmn*. This space group **is centrosymmetric** (it has a center of inversion).\n    *   Other predicted stable structures, like the planar **$\\alpha$-sheet** (*Pmmm*), are also **centrosymmetric**.\n*   **Conclusion from Symmetry:** Since the ideal, defect-free, crystalline structures of common boron nanosheets possess inversion symmetry, their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ is zero.\n\n### Step 4: Draw the primary conclusion and consider nuances\n\nBased on the symmetry analysis, the primary answer is that free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC. However, it is important to consider some careful points and real-world exceptions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Ideal vs. Real Structure.** The rule applies to the *ideal, infinite* crystal lattice. Real-world nanosheets are finite. Symmetry is inherently broken at the **edges** of the nanosheet. This can lead to a weak $\\chi^{(2)}$ signal originating from the edges, but this is not a bulk effect and would be very inefficient for SPDC.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Defects and Strain.** Atomic-scale defects, vacancies, or impurities can locally break the inversion symmetry of the lattice. More importantly for a 2D material, **strain, ripples, and wrinkles**, which are almost unavoidable in a free-standing sheet, can also break the global inversion symmetry. This strain-induced symmetry breaking could, in principle, induce a weak, non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ and thus allow for a very weak SPDC process.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Comparison to standard materials.** Even if a weak $\\chi^{(2)}$ is induced by these imperfections, it would likely be many orders of magnitude smaller than that of standard nonlinear crystals used for SPDC (like BBO, KDP, or PPLN), which are specifically chosen for their large, intrinsic, non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis leads to the following conclusion:\n\n1.  SPDC requires a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$).\n2.  Materials with inversion symmetry have $\\chi^{(2)} = 0$.\n3.  The ideal crystal structures of the most stable forms of borophene are centrosymmetric.\n4.  **Therefore, based on its intrinsic material properties, free-standing borophene is not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.**\n5.  While weak, localized effects might be theoretically possible due to symmetry breaking at edges, defects, or from strain, these are not intrinsic properties of the material's crystal lattice and would not make it an effective material for SPDC.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$). According to the principles of crystal symmetry, any material that possesses a center of inversion (i.e., is centrosymmetric) must have a bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ of zero. The most stable and common polymorphs of borophene, such as the $\\beta_{12}$-sheet, are centrosymmetric in their ideal, free-standing crystalline form. Consequently, they are fundamentally forbidden from exhibiting bulk second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC. While real-world effects such as edges, defects, or strain-induced wrinkles could locally break this inversion symmetry and potentially induce a very weak response, this is not an intrinsic property of the material and would be far too inefficient for practical SPDC applications."
