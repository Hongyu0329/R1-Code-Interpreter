No, free-standing boron nanosheets are generally not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC). This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$). According to the principles of crystal symmetry, any material that possesses a center of inversion (i.e., is centrosymmetric) must have a bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ of zero. The most stable and common polymorphs of borophene, such as the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, are centrosymmetric in their ideal, free-standing crystalline form. Consequently, they are fundamentally forbidden from exhibiting bulk second-order nonlinear effects like SPDC. While real-world effects such as edges, defects, or strain-induced wrinkles could locally break this inversion symmetry and potentially induce a very weak response, this is not an intrinsic property of the material and would be far too inefficient for practical SPDC applications.
