    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Name:** The name \"perfluoronanocar\" can be broken into two parts:\n    *   **\"perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard chemical prefix indicating that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n    *   **\"nanocar\"**: This refers to a specific class of molecule-sized machines. The most famous example, often referred to simply as \"the nanocar,\" was developed by the research group of Prof. James Tour at Rice University. We will assume the question refers to this canonical structure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Structure of a Nanocar:** The canonical nanocar consists of two main parts:\n    *   **A Chassis:** The central body of the car.\n    *   **Four Wheels:** Attached to the chassis.\n\n3.  **Determine the Chemical Composition of the Chassis:**\n    *   The chassis is an organic molecule named **1,4-bis(3,5-diethynylphenyl)benzene**.\n    *   Let's find the number of hydrogen atoms in this chassis structure:\n        *   The central part is a **benzene** ring substituted at the 1 and 4 positions. A benzene ring is C₆H₆. When substituted at two positions, it becomes a C₆H₄ group. So, this core has **4 hydrogen atoms**.\n        *   Attached to this core are two identical groups: **(3,5-diethynylphenyl)**.\n            *   A phenyl group is a C₆H₅ group. This one is attached to the central ring (position 1) and substituted at its own 3 and 5 positions. This leaves hydrogens at positions 2, 4, and 6. So, each of these phenyl rings has **3 hydrogen atoms**.\n            *   Each of these phenyl rings has two **ethynyl** groups (-C≡CH). Each ethynyl group contains **1 hydrogen atom**. Since there are two such groups on each phenyl ring, and there are two phenyl rings, we have a total of 4 ethynyl groups. This gives us 4 x 1 = **4 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   **Total Hydrogens in the Chassis:** Summing up the hydrogens from all parts: 4 (from central ring) + 2 * 3 (from the two side rings) + 4 (from the four ethynyl groups) = 4 + 6 + 4 = **14 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   The chemical formula for the hydrocarbon chassis is therefore **C₂₆H₁₄**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Wheels:**\n    *   The wheels of the nanocar are **fullerenes**, specifically **C₆₀** (also known as buckyballs).\n    *   C₆₀ is an allotrope of carbon, meaning it is composed purely of carbon atoms. It contains **zero hydrogen atoms**.\n\n5.  **Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix:**\n    *   As established in Step 1, \"perfluoro-\" means we must replace every hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom.\n    *   The hydrogen atoms are only present in the chassis (C₂₆H₁₄). There are none in the C₆₀ wheels.\n    *   Therefore, the 14 hydrogen atoms in the chassis must be replaced by 14 fluorine atoms.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Number of Fluorine Atoms:**\n    *   The perfluorinated chassis will have the formula C₂₆F₁₄.\n    *   The C₆₀ wheels remain unchanged and contain no fluorine.\n    *   The total number of fluorine atoms in the entire \"perfluoronanocar\" molecule is therefore **14**.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n*   **Canonical Structure:** The analysis relies on the assumption that \"nanocar\" refers to the well-known structure from the Tour group. While other designs exist, this is the most common reference.\n*   **Chemical Nomenclature:** The prefix \"perfluoro-\" has a precise meaning (all H atoms are replaced by F atoms), which is central to solving the problem. It does not imply adding fluorine to the carbon skeleton in any other way (e.g., fluorinating the C₆₀ cages).\n*   **Hypothetical Nature:** The question is hypothetical, so we do not need to consider the chemical stability or the synthetic feasibility of creating a perfluoronanocar. We only need to apply the rules of chemical naming to the known structure of a nanocar.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the parent nanocar structure contains a chassis with 14 hydrogen atoms and four C₆₀ wheels with no hydrogen atoms. The \"perfluoro-\" prefix dictates that all 14 hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<14>>>"
