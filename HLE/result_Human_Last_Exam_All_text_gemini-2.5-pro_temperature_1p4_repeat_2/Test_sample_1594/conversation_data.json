    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The question asks to identify the letter formed by the buildings of two specific high schools in Pisa, Italy, when viewed from above.\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Information:**\n    *   **Location:** Pisa, Italy.\n    *   **Schools:** Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n    *   **Clue:** They are located next to each other.\n    *   **Perspective:** The view is from above (aerial or satellite view).\n\n3.  **Strategy: Use a Mapping Service.** The most reliable way to solve this is to use a digital mapping service with a satellite view, such as Google Maps or Google Earth.\n\n4.  **Execution - Locating the Schools:**\n    *   Search for \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti, Pisa\" on a map. This leads to the IIS Galilei Pacinotti, located on Via Benedetto Croce.\n    *   Search for \"Istituto Ulisse Dini, Pisa\" on a map. This leads to the Liceo Scientifico Statale \"Ulisse Dini\", also located on Via Benedetto Croce.\n    *   The search confirms that the two institutions are indeed neighbors.\n\n5.  **Execution - Analyzing the Aerial View:**\n    *   Switch to the satellite or aerial view of the location on Via Benedetto Croce.\n    *   Observe the layout of the two main school buildings. You will see two large, elongated building complexes joined at a corner.\n    *   The building belonging to the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti forms a long, vertical wing (when viewed with North at the top).\n    *   The building belonging to the Istituto Ulisse Dini forms a long, horizontal wing that connects to the southern end of the Galilei-Pacinotti building.\n\n6.  **Conclusion - Identifying the Letter:**\n    *   When viewed together, the vertical wing (Galilei-Pacinotti) and the horizontal wing (Dini) form a clear right angle.\n    *   This combined shape distinctly resembles the letter \"L\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Exact Names:** Using the correct names of the schools is crucial for an accurate search. The full names are Istituto d'Istruzione Superiore (IIS) \"Galilei-Pacinotti\" and Liceo Scientifico Statale \"Ulisse Dini\".\n*   **Adjacency:** The question's clue that they \"stand next to each other\" is key. It implies their shapes should be considered together as one composite figure.\n*   **Perspective:** The \"seen from above\" instruction is the most important part of the question, directing the method of analysis to satellite imagery.\n*   **Main Buildings:** One must focus on the main structural layout of the buildings, ignoring smaller, detached structures or sports fields that might obscure the primary shape.\n\nBy following these steps and carefully analyzing the satellite view of the two adjacent schools, the resulting shape is unequivocally identifiable.\n\n<<<L>>>"
