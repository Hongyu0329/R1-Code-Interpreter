    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Specific Heat Critical Exponent ($\\alpha$):** This exponent describes the behavior of the specific heat ($C$) near the critical temperature ($T_c$). The relationship is given by the scaling law $C \\propto |T - T_c|^{-\\alpha}$. A positive value of $\\alpha$ indicates a divergence (singularity) in the specific heat at the critical point.\n*   **Renormalization Group (RG) Theory:** A powerful theoretical framework for studying critical phenomena. It allows for the systematic calculation of critical exponents.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** This is the spatial dimension above which the critical exponents of a system take on their simple, classical mean-field theory values. For the universality classes of models like Ising, XY, and Heisenberg (described by a $\\phi^4$ field theory), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n*   **Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:** A key technique within RG theory. It involves performing a perturbative expansion in the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$. This allows for the calculation of critical exponents in dimensions slightly below the upper critical dimension.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the parameters of the system**\n\n*   **Spatial Dimension ($d$):** The problem specifies the system has a dimension of $d=3$.\n*   **Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$):** For the standard models of critical phenomena, $d_c=4$.\n*   **Expansion Parameter ($\\epsilon$):** Using the definition, we calculate $\\epsilon = d_c - d = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n*   **Universality Class (n):** The problem does not explicitly state the model (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg). In such cases, the standard and simplest example, the **Ising model**, is assumed. The Ising model has a scalar order parameter, which corresponds to **n=1** component in the general O(n) model.\n\n**Step 3: Recall the formula for the exponent $\\alpha$ from the $\\epsilon$-expansion**\n\nWithin the framework of the O(n) model, the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ can be calculated as a series in $\\epsilon$. To the first order, which is the standard leading-order approximation, the formula is:\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)} \\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the parameters and compute the value**\n\nNow, we substitute the parameters identified in Step 2 into the formula from Step 3:\n*   $n = 1$ (for the Ising model)\n*   $\\epsilon = 1$ (for $d=3$)\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9} = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThus, the first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion predicts that the specific heat exponent for the 3D Ising model is $\\alpha = 1/6$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Choice of Model:** The result for $\\alpha$ depends on the number of spin components 'n'. The choice of the Ising model ($n=1$) is a standard assumption but is crucial for the final numerical value. For other models like the XY model ($n=2$), $\\alpha$ would be different ($\\alpha = \\frac{1}{10}\\epsilon$).\n2.  **Validity of the Expansion:** The $\\epsilon$-expansion is formally a Taylor series around $\\epsilon=0$ (i.e., around $d=4$). Applying it to $d=3$ requires setting $\\epsilon=1$, which is not a small number. This means the expansion is being used outside its rigorous domain of convergence. The result is therefore an approximation, and higher-order terms do not necessarily improve the accuracy without using advanced resummation techniques (like Borel-Padé summation).\n3.  **Method vs. \"True\" Value:** The question specifically asks for the result obtained \"using the epsilon expansion\". This calculated value ($\\alpha = 1/6 \\approx 0.167$) is the direct result of this method. It should be noted that this differs from the highly accurate value obtained from numerical simulations (like Monte Carlo) and other advanced theoretical methods for the 3D Ising model, which is closer to $\\alpha \\approx 0.110$. The question is about the process of the calculation, not the most accurate known value for the physical system.\n4.  **Hyperscaling Relation:** The result can be cross-checked using the hyperscaling relation $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$. Using the first-order expansions for $\\nu$ ($\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$) and for $d=4-\\epsilon$, we arrive at the same formula for $\\alpha$, confirming the consistency of the RG results.\n\nThe final answer is the value derived from the standard, first-order $\\epsilon$-expansion calculation.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
