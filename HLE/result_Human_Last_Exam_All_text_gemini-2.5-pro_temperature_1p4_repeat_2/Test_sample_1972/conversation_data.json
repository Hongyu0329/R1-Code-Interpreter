    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks to identify a specific novel based on two key pieces of information attributed to Jorge Luis Borges:\n1.  A direct quote describing the novel: it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  A description of the novel's author: he is a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\nWe need to find a novel and author pair that fits both descriptions from Borges.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the First Clue - The \"Tiger and Chess\" Quote\n*   **Careful Point:** The quote is highly specific and metaphorical. \"Intensity of a tiger\" suggests raw, powerful, perhaps violent or passionate narrative force. \"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\" suggests intricate plotting, intellectual complexity, and a structure where every move is significant.\n*   **Investigation:** We need to find where Borges wrote or said this. A search for this quote links it directly to Borges's writings about his close friend and literary collaborator, **Adolfo Bioy Casares**.\n*   **Source Identification:** The quote comes from Borges's review of Bioy Casares's 1954 novel, **_El sueño de los héroes_** (**_The Dream of Heroes_**). The review was published in the influential literary magazine _Sur_ (No. 231, November-December 1954).\n*   **Conclusion for Clue 1:** The novel described with the \"tiger and chess\" quote is _El sueño de los héroes_ by Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Second Clue - The \"Continuator of Faulkner\" Description\n*   **Careful Point:** This describes the author's style in relation to a major figure in literary modernism, William Faulkner. Faulkner is known for his complex narrative structures, stream-of-consciousness, and dense prose. A \"continuator\" would be someone who works with similar themes or techniques, while a \"simplifier\" would be one who refines or clarifies these complex methods into a more accessible or classical style.\n*   **Investigation:** We need to see if Borges described Adolfo Bioy Casares in this way. Borges held Bioy's writing in extremely high regard, often praising its \"lucid intelligence\" and classical perfection. He saw Bioy as an author who could tackle profound and complex subjects without resorting to the baroque or deliberately obscure styles of some of his contemporaries.\n*   **Connecting to Faulkner:** Borges saw Bioy Casares as someone who learned from the modernists, including Faulkner, but chose a path of clarity and economy. He adopted the psychological depth and narrative ambition of authors like Faulkner but rendered them with a precision and elegance that Borges admired. Therefore, describing Bioy as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\" is a perfect encapsulation of Borges's critical opinion of his friend's work. He continues the project of modernism but simplifies its form.\n*   **Conclusion for Clue 2:** The author described as a continuator and simplifier of Faulkner is Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesizing the Clues and Final Answer\n*   The first clue points directly to the novel **_El sueño de los héroes_** by **Adolfo Bioy Casares**.\n*   The second clue points directly to the author **Adolfo Bioy Casares**.\n*   Since both pieces of information converge on the same author and the first clue specifies the novel, we can confidently identify the work in question.\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to with this praise is _El sueño de los héroes_ by his friend and collaborator, Adolfo Bioy Casares.\n\n<<<The Dream of Heroes (El sueño de los héroes)>>>"
