    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and the question**\nLet C be a smooth complex projective curve of genus $g=3$.\nLet $X$ be its 15th symmetric power, $X = S^{15}C$.\nThe Neron-Severi group of a variety, $NS(X)$, is the group of divisor classes modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank is called the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho(X)$.\nWe want to find the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(X)$ as C varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi group of $S^n C$ to the Jacobian of C**\nThere is a fundamental relationship between the geometry of the symmetric powers of a curve and its Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. For a curve of genus $g$ and a symmetric power $S^n C$ with $n$ large enough, the Picard number of $S^n C$ is directly related to the Picard number of its Jacobian.\n\nA key result, established by Macdonald and others, states that for $n > 2g-2$, the Picard number of $S^n C$ is given by:\n$$ \\rho(S^n C) = 1 + \\rho(J(C)) $$\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $n=15$. The condition is $15 > 2(3)-2 = 4$, which is satisfied.\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimum and maximum possible values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a curve C of genus 3.\n\n**Careful point:** This formula is crucial. It stems from the fact that the algebraic cohomology classes of degree 2 on $S^n C$ (for $n>2g-2$) are generated by two types of classes:\n1.  The class of the divisor $W_P = \\{D \\in S^n C \\mid P \\in \\mathrm{supp}(D) \\}$ for a fixed point $P \\in C$. This class is independent of $P$ and contributes 1 to the rank.\n2.  Classes pulled back from the Jacobian $J(C)$ via the Abel-Jacobi map $u_n: S^n C \\to J(C)$. The space of these classes has dimension $\\rho(J(C))$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Picard number of the Jacobian $J(C)$**\n$J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety (ppav). The Picard number $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the arithmetic properties of $J(C)$, specifically on its ring of endomorphisms, $\\mathrm{End}(J(C))$.\n\nA celebrated theorem of Weil states that for a ppav $A$, its Picard number is the dimension of the $\\mathbb{Q}$-vector space of self-adjoint endomorphisms with respect to the Rosati involution associated with the principal polarization:\n$$ \\rho(A) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} \\{\\phi \\in \\mathrm{End}(A) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} \\mid \\phi' = \\phi \\} $$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the smallest possible rank $\\rho(J(C))$**\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"generic\" curve C. A generic curve C of genus 3 is, for instance, a smooth plane quartic curve with general coefficients.\nFor such a generic curve, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety (i.e., it is not isogenous to a product of lower-dimensional abelian varieties) and has the smallest possible endomorphism ring, which is just the integers:\n$$ \\mathrm{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z} $$\nIn this case, the algebra of endomorphisms is $\\mathrm{End}(J(C)) \\otimes \\mathbb{Q} = \\mathbb{Q}$. Any element $\\phi=q \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ is a scalar multiplication. The Rosati involution is the identity on scalars, so $\\phi'=\\phi$. The space of self-adjoint endomorphisms is $\\mathbb{Q}$ itself, which is a 1-dimensional vector space over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, for a generic curve C of genus 3:\n$$ \\rho(J(C)) = 1 $$\nThis is the minimum possible value for the Picard number of a 3-dimensional ppav.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the smallest rank of $NS(X)$**\nUsing the formula from Step 2 with the minimum value from Step 4:\n$$ \\rho_{min}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nSo the smallest possible rank is 2.\n\n**Step 6: Determine the largest possible rank $\\rho(J(C))$**\nThe largest possible rank occurs for special curves with extra endomorphisms, a property known as Complex Multiplication (CM). We need to find the maximum possible value of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve C.\n\nFor a $g$-dimensional abelian variety $A$, there is a general upper bound on its Picard number: $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$. For our 3-dimensional Jacobian $J(C)$, this means $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\nWe need to check if this maximum value can be achieved by the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. Indeed, it can. Consider the Fermat curve of degree 4, given by the equation:\n$$ C: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0 $$\nThis is a smooth curve of genus 3. Its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a well-studied object. It is known to be isogenous to the product of three copies of an elliptic curve $E$ with complex multiplication by the Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$ (the curve $E$ is $y^2 = x^3 - x$).\nIt has been proven (by Shioda, Schoen, and others) that the Picard number of the Jacobian of the Fermat quartic is maximal:\n$$ \\rho(J(C)) = 9 $$\nThis shows that the theoretical maximum $\\rho=9$ is attained within the family of Jacobians of genus 3 curves.\n\n**Careful point:** Not every 3-dimensional ppav with $\\rho=9$ is a Jacobian. However, the one arising from the Fermat curve is, by definition, a Jacobian. This confirms that the maximum is attainable for the specific class of varieties we are interested in.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the largest rank of $NS(X)$**\nUsing the formula from Step 2 with the maximum value from Step 6:\n$$ \\rho_{max}(X) = 1 + \\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 1 + 9 = 10 $$\nSo the largest possible rank is 10.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the dependence of $\\rho(S^{15}C)$ on $\\rho(J(C))$, and then finding the minimum and maximum values of $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve, we find:\n*   The smallest rank corresponds to a generic curve and is $1+1=2$.\n*   The largest rank corresponds to a specific CM curve (the Fermat quartic) and is $1+9=10$."
