    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix derived from the flag of Tonga.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Flag's Geometry and the Matrix Representation**\n\n1.  **Flag of Tonga:** The flag has a red field (background). In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle, there is a red couped cross (a simple '+' shape that doesn't touch the edges of the white canton).\n2.  **Matrix Formulation:** We create a matrix where each red pixel of the flag's image is represented by a value `a`, and each white pixel by a value `b`. The question asks for the *maximal possible rank*, which means we can choose the values of `a` and `b`, and the resolution of the image, to maximize the rank. To get the highest possible rank, we should assume `a ≠ b` and that `a` and `b` are not both zero. A simple choice for analysis is `a=1` and `b=0`, or `a=1` and `b=2`.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Rank for an Ideal, Unbordered Flag**\n\nLet's assume an idealized, high-resolution image of the flag without any border or fringe. The flag's geometric shapes (rectangles and the cross) align perfectly with the pixel grid of the matrix.\n\n1.  **Identify Row Types:** We can analyze the matrix by identifying the different types of rows it can contain.\n    *   **Type A (All Red):** Any row of pixels that passes entirely through the red field will consist only of the value `a`. Let's call this row vector `v_a = (a, a, ..., a)`. The rows in the bottom part of the flag (below the canton) are of this type. Also, any row that passes through the horizontal bar of the red cross within the canton will also be all red, and thus of this type.\n    *   **Type B (Canton's White Field):** Any row that passes through the white part of the canton (i.e., above or below the horizontal bar of the cross). Such a row will have `b` values for the white background and `a` values for the vertical bar of the cross. To the right of the canton, the row will be all `a`'s. Since the vertical bar of the cross is a perfect rectangle, all rows of this type will have the exact same pattern of `a`'s and `b`'s. Let's call this row vector `v_b`. For example, `v_b = (b,...,b, a,...,a, b,...,b | a,...,a)`.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Rank:** The entire matrix is composed of rows that are either type `v_a` or type `v_b`. The set of all rows in the matrix is `{v_a, v_b}`. The rank of the matrix is the dimension of the space spanned by these vectors, i.e., `dim(span{v_a, v_b})`.\n    *   The vectors `v_a` and `v_b` are linearly independent as long as `a ≠ b` (and they are not both zero). `v_b` cannot be a scalar multiple of `v_a` because `v_b` contains both `a` and `b` values.\n    *   Therefore, for an ideal, unbordered flag, the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors. The rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n**Step 3: Consider Variations to Maximize the Rank**\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal possible* rank. This suggests we should consider plausible variations of the \"image of the flag\" that might increase the rank. A common feature of physical flags, especially for ceremonial use, is a fringe or a border.\n\n1.  **Analyze a Fringed Flag:** Let's assume the image is of a flag with a uniform white fringe (border). The pixels of the fringe will be assigned the value `b`. This introduces new row and column structures.\n\n2.  **Identify New Row Types:**\n    *   **Type 1 (Top/Bottom Fringe):** The top-most and bottom-most rows of the matrix will now correspond to the fringe and will consist entirely of the value `b`. Let this vector be `v_1 = (b, b, ..., b)`.\n    *   **Type 2 (Bordered Red Field):** A row that passes through the red field of the flag will now start and end with `b` (from the side fringes) and have `a`'s in between. Let this vector be `v_2 = (b, a, a, ..., a, b)`. A row passing through the horizontal bar of the cross will also be of this type.\n    *   **Type 3 (Bordered White Canton Field):** A row passing through the white parts of the canton will start and end with `b` (from the side fringes), and its middle section will be the canton pattern of `b`'s and `a`'s (from the vertical bar of the cross). Let this vector be `v_3`. For example, `v_3 = (b, b,...,b, a,...,a, b,...,b, b)`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank for the Fringed Flag:** The matrix is now composed of rows of type `v_1`, `v_2`, and `v_3`. We need to check if these three vectors are linearly independent. Let's choose `a=2` and `b=1`.\n    *   `v_1 = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1)`\n    *   `v_2 = (1, 2, 2, ..., 2, 1)`\n    *   `v_3 = (1, 1,...,1, 2,...,2, 1,...,1, 1)`\n\n    Let's test for linear independence: `k_1*v_1 + k_2*v_2 + k_3*v_3 = 0`.\n    *   Consider a column corresponding to the left fringe. All three vectors have a `b` (or 1) here. So `k_1*b + k_2*b + k_3*b = 0`, which implies `k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 0` (assuming `b≠0`).\n    *   Consider a column passing through the red field to the right of the canton. The values in `v_1, v_2, v_3` at this position are `b, a, a` respectively. So `k_1*b + k_2*a + k_3*a = 0`.\n    *   Consider a column passing through the white field in the canton (left of the vertical cross). The values are `b, b, a`. So `k_1*b + k_2*b + k_3*a = 0`.\n\n    We have a system of linear equations for `k_1, k_2, k_3`:\n    1) `k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 0`\n    2) `b*k_1 + a*k_2 + a*k_3 = 0`\n    3) `b*k_1 + b*k_2 + a*k_3 = 0`\n\n    Subtracting (3) from (1)*b: `(b*k_1 + b*k_2 + b*k_3) - (b*k_1 + b*k_2 + a*k_3) = 0`, which gives `(b-a)*k_3 = 0`. Since `a ≠ b`, we must have `k_3 = 0`.\n    Substituting `k_3 = 0` into (1) gives `k_1 + k_2 = 0`.\n    Substituting `k_3 = 0` into (2) gives `b*k_1 + a*k_2 = 0`.\n    From `k_1 = -k_2`, we get `-b*k_2 + a*k_2 = 0`, which is `(a-b)*k_2 = 0`. Since `a ≠ b`, we must have `k_2 = 0`.\n    This implies `k_1 = 0` as well.\n    Since the only solution is `k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 0`, the vectors `v_1, v_2, v_3` are linearly independent.\n\n    Thus, by considering a fringed flag, we can construct a matrix with a rank of 3.\n\n**Step 4: Can the Rank be Higher?**\n\nTo achieve a rank of 4 or more, we would need to find a fourth linearly independent row type. With the simple and highly symmetric geometry of a flag with a uniform fringe, it is not possible to generate more linearly independent row types. Any further simple geometric addition (like making the corner fringes a different color) results in rows that are linearly dependent on the existing three types. More complex scenarios (like a crumpled flag or a flag with a complex emblem on it) are generally considered outside the scope of such well-defined mathematical problems unless specified. Therefore, the maximum rank under a reasonable interpretation of the problem is 3.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nThe maximal possible rank is achieved by choosing `a` and `b` to be distinct and non-zero, and by considering an image of the flag that includes a uniform border or fringe. This construction yields exactly three linearly independent row types.\n\n<<<3>>>"
