    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the historical development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti`.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂gieti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-` meaning 'to track, trace, seek out'. This is confirmed by cognates like Hittite `sākizzi` ('(s)he gives a sign') and Latin `sāgīre` ('to perceive keenly').\n*   **Structure:**\n    *   `*seh₂g-`: The root. The laryngeal `*h₂` has an \"a-coloring\" effect on an adjacent `*e`.\n    *   `*-ie-`: A common suffix for forming present tense verbs.\n    *   `*-ti`: The standard third-person singular active verb ending.\n*   **Meaning:** '(s)he tracks, seeks, gives a sign'.\n\n### Step 2: From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)\n\nTo get to Proto-Germanic, several key sound changes must be applied. The resulting form is typically cited as an infinitive.\n\n1.  **Vowel Development and Ablaut:** While the given form `*seh₂gieti` has an e-grade vowel, the Proto-Germanic verb 'to seek' is reconstructed from a causative o-grade form, likely `*soh₂g-éye-ti`.\n    *   `s` remains `s`.\n    *   The combination `*oh₂` in the root `*soh₂g-` develops into a long vowel `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   The causative suffix `*-éye-` becomes `*-ija-` in Proto-Germanic, forming a Class 1 weak verb.\n\n2.  **Grimm's Law:** This law describes a systematic shift of PIE stop consonants in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   The PIE voiced velar stop `*g` becomes the Proto-Germanic voiceless velar stop `*k`.\n\n3.  **Reconstruction:**\n    *   PIE Root `*soh₂g-` → PGmc root `*sōk-`.\n    *   PIE Suffix `*-eye-` → PGmc suffix `*-ija-`.\n    *   The standard PGmc infinitive ending is `*-aną`.\n    *   Combining these parts gives the Proto-Germanic infinitive.\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic Result:** **`*sōkijaną`** ('to seek')\n\n### Step 3: From Proto-Germanic to Old Norse (ON)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut (I-Mutation):** The `*i` or `*j` in the suffix `*-ijaną` causes the preceding back vowel `*ō` to front, becoming `œ` (or sometimes written `ø`, later `æ`).\n2.  **Syncope:** The `i` in the suffix is lost after a long root syllable (`sōk-`). The `j` is retained in writing.\n3.  **Ending:** The infinitive ending `*-aną` weakens to `-a`.\n\n*   **Old Norse Result:** **`sœkja`** (also spelled `sækja`)\n\n### Step 4: From Proto-Germanic to Old English (OE)\n\n1.  **I-Umlaut:** The `*j` in `*-janą` fronts the root vowel `*ō` to `*œ̄`, which then raises to `*ē` in Old English. So, `*sōk-` becomes `*sēc-`.\n2.  **Palatalization:** The velar consonant `*k` was followed by the front glide `*j`. This environment caused `*k` to palatalize into the affricate /tʃ/, which is spelled `c` in Old English.\n3.  **Ending:** The `j` of the suffix is lost after causing umlaut and palatalization. The infinitive ending `*-aną` reduces to `-an`.\n\n*   **Old English Result:** **`sēcan`**\n\n### Step 5: From Proto-Germanic to Old High German (OHG)\n\n1.  **Vowel Shift:** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` undergoes diphthongization to `uo` in Old High German.\n2.  **High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift):** This is the most significant change. The PGmc voiceless stop `*k` shifts to a fricative after a vowel.\n    *   `*k` → `hh` (orthographically) or `ch`, representing the voiceless velar fricative /x/.\n3.  **I-Umlaut:** The `j` in the suffix would cause `uo` to umlaut to `üe`. However, in Old High German manuscripts, umlaut is not always marked, so the form with the un-umlauted vowel is the most common citation form.\n4.  **Ending:** The `j` is lost, and the infinitive ending becomes `-an` (later `-en`).\n\n*   **Old High German Result:** **`suohhen`** (or `suochen`)\n\n### Summary of Developments\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen` / `suochen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: `*sōkijaną`\nOld Norse: `sœkja` (or `sækja`)\nOld English: `sēcan`\nOld High German: `suohhen` (or `suochen`)>>>"
