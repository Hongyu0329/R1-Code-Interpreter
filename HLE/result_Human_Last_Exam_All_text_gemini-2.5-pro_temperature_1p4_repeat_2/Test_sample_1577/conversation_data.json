    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with specified holes.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Ground Space Degeneracy of the Toric Code\n\nThe ground state degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is a topological property, meaning it depends on the global topology of the surface on which the code is defined, including its genus, and the number and type of its boundaries (holes). The degeneracy is given by $2^k$, where $k$ is the number of logical qubits. The number of logical qubits is determined by the number of independent logical operators that commute with all the stabilizers of the code but are not products of stabilizers themselves. These logical operators are associated with the non-trivial cycles of the manifold.\n\n### Step 2: Characterize Smooth and Rough Holes (Boundaries)\n\nIn the context of the toric code, holes are boundaries. The type of boundary termination determines which kind of anyonic excitation can be absorbed or disappear at that boundary.\n*   **Smooth Hole:** This boundary is formed by terminating the lattice on vertices. At this boundary, the \"star\" operators ($A_s$) are incomplete and dropped from the set of stabilizers. This type of boundary acts as a condensate for electric charges (`e` anyons). An X-type logical string operator cannot terminate on this boundary without creating an excitation. However, a Z-type logical string operator can terminate here.\n*   **Rough Hole:** This boundary is formed by terminating the lattice on open edges (incomplete plaquettes). Here, the \"plaquette\" operators ($B_p$) are incomplete and dropped. This boundary acts as a condensate for magnetic fluxes (`m` anyons). A Z-type logical loop is affected by this boundary, while an X-type string can terminate on it.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Logical Qubits for a General Surface with Boundaries\n\nFor a surface of genus `g` with a total of `b` boundaries, all of the *same type*, the number of logical qubits is `k = 2g + b - 1`. In our problem, the holes are on a surface that is topologically equivalent to a sphere, so the genus `g = 0`. If all `n+m` holes were of the same type, the number of logical qubits would be `k = (n+m) - 1`.\n\nWhen there is a mix of boundary types, the counting is modified. A robust formula for the number of logical qubits on a surface of genus `g` with `N_S` smooth boundaries and `N_R` rough boundaries is:\n\n$k = 2g + N_S + N_R - 1$\n\nThis formula applies as long as the total number of boundaries is greater than zero.\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the Phrasing of the Question\n\nThe question asks for the GSD for a system \"with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes\". In physics problems, this phrasing often implies that the holes are features within a larger system, such as a 2D plane. A plane is topologically a sphere with one puncture (a boundary at infinity). We must account for this implicit outer boundary.\n\nLet's assume the question describes a system on a plane, which has one outer boundary. The total number of boundaries is thus the `n` explicit smooth holes, the `m` explicit rough holes, plus the one outer boundary.\n\nTotal number of holes/boundaries = `n + m + 1`.\n\nNow, we apply the formula from Step 3. Let's determine the total number of smooth (`N_S`) and rough (`N_R`) boundaries. The type of the outer boundary is not specified, but we will see that it does not affect the final result for `k`.\n\n*   **Case 1: The outer boundary is smooth.**\n    *   Total smooth boundaries: $N_S = n + 1$\n    *   Total rough boundaries: $N_R = m$\n    *   Number of logical qubits `k` (with `g=0`):\n        $k = N_S + N_R - 1 = (n+1) + m - 1 = n+m$\n\n*   **Case 2: The outer boundary is rough.**\n    *   Total smooth boundaries: $N_S = n$\n    *   Total rough boundaries: $N_R = m + 1$\n    *   Number of logical qubits `k` (with `g=0`):\n        $k = N_S + N_R - 1 = n + (m+1) - 1 = n+m$\n\nIn both cases, the number of logical qubits is `k = n + m`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Final Ground Space Degeneracy\n\nThe ground space degeneracy is $2^k$. With `k = n + m`, the degeneracy is:\n\nGSD = $2^{n+m}$\n\nThis matches one of the answer choices.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n1.  **Topology is Key:** The GSD is a robust topological property. The exact lattice geometry doesn't matter, only the number of handles (genus) and boundaries.\n2.  **Boundary Types Matter:** The distinction between smooth and rough boundaries is crucial. It determines which logical operators are well-defined.\n3.  **Implicit Boundary:** The phrasing \"holes in a system\" often implies an outer boundary (the boundary of the system itself). Including this boundary is essential to get the correct count.\n4.  **The Formula:** The formula $k = 2g + N_S + N_R - 1$ is a standard result for the toric code with mixed boundaries. The `-1` accounts for a single constraint relating all boundaries.\n\nBy systematically applying the standard formula for toric code degeneracy on a surface with boundaries and carefully interpreting the question's premise of \"holes\" on a plane, we arrive at the result.\n\nFinal Answer: The ground space degeneracy is $2^{n+m}$.\n\n<<<A>>>"
