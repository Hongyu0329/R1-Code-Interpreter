    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\n\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{r} \\)\" for the rational number \\( r = 4/7 \\). This refers to the continued fraction of a specific quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\(\\alpha_r\\), from which \\(m_r\\) is defined. This continued fraction is known to be purely periodic.\n\n**2. The Standard Construction Method**\n\nThe period of the continued fraction for \\(\\alpha_r\\) can be constructed using the continued fraction expansions of \\(r\\) and \\(1-r\\). The specific construction rule depends on the parities of the lengths of these continued fraction expansions.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\n*   **Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of \\(r = 4/7\\).**\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm:\n    \\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{4/3} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1/3} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n    So, the continued fraction is \\(r = 4/7 = [0; 1, 1, 3]\\).\n    The sequence of partial quotients is \\((a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\).\n    The length of this sequence is \\(n = 3\\).\n\n*   **Step 2: Compute the continued fraction of \\(1-r\\).**\n    \\(1 - r = 1 - 4/7 = 3/7\\).\n    We use the Euclidean algorithm:\n    \\( \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/3} = \\frac{1}{2 + 1/3} \\)\n    So, the continued fraction is \\(1-r = 3/7 = [0; 2, 3]\\).\n    The sequence of partial quotients is \\((b_1, b_2) = (2, 3)\\).\n    The length of this sequence is \\(m = 2\\).\n\n*   **Step 3: Determine the case based on parity.**\n    The length for \\(r\\) is \\(n=3\\), which is **odd**.\n    The length for \\(1-r\\) is \\(m=2\\), which is **even**.\n    Therefore, we use the construction rule for the (n odd, m even) case.\n\n*   **Step 4: Apply the construction rule.**\n    The rule for the period \\(P\\) of the associated continued fraction when \\(n\\) is odd and \\(m\\) is even is given by the following sequence:\n    \\( P = (a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n-1, 1, b_1-1, b_2, \\dots, b_m) \\)\n\n*   **Step 5: Substitute the values into the formula.**\n    From our sequences \\((a_1, a_2, a_3) = (1, 1, 3)\\) and \\((b_1, b_2) = (2, 3)\\):\n    *   The first part is \\((a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1})\\), which for \\(n=3\\) is \\((a_1, a_2) = (1, 1)\\).\n    *   The next term is \\(a_n - 1\\), which is \\(a_3 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\\).\n    *   The next term is the constant `1` from the formula.\n    *   The next term is \\(b_1 - 1\\), which is \\(2 - 1 = 1\\).\n    *   The final part is \\((b_2, \\dots, b_m)\\), which for \\(m=2\\) is just \\(b_2 = 3\\).\n\n*   **Step 6: Assemble the final period.**\n    Concatenating these parts gives the period \\(P\\):\n    \\( P = (1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3) \\)\n    **Careful point:** We check if any of the calculated terms are zero. In this case, \\(a_3-1=2\\) and \\(b_1-1=1\\), so no terms are zero and no special simplification is needed.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe continued fraction associated with \\(m_{4/7}\\) is a purely periodic continued fraction with the period we have just computed.\n\nFinal continued fraction: \\([\\overline{1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3}]\\)\n\n<<<[\\overline{1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3}]>>>"
