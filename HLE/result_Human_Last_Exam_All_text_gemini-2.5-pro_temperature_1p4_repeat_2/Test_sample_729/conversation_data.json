    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the question and define the group**\n\n*   **Group:** The group is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, which is denoted as $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Power Subgroup:** The term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory literature. The most natural and common interpretation is that it refers to a **cyclic subgroup**. A cyclic subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by taking all integer powers of a single element. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n*   **Group Presentation:** The generalized quaternion group $Q_{4n}$ is defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n}=1, x^n=y^2, y^{-1}xy=x^{-1} \\rangle$. For $Q_{128}$, we have $4n = 128$, so $n=32$. The presentation is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Structure:** The group has a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. The elements of $Q_{128}$ can be partitioned into two sets:\n    1.  The 64 elements of the cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{x^k \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n    2.  The other 64 elements, which form a coset of $\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{x^k y \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$.\n\nWe will count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each set.\n\n**Step 2: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThe subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. According to the fundamental theorem of cyclic groups, the number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order $m$ is equal to the number of positive divisors of $m$, denoted $\\tau(m)$.\n\n*   The order of the subgroup is $m = 64 = 2^6$.\n*   The divisors of 64 are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64$.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1 = 7$.\n*   These 7 subgroups are $\\langle 1 \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^2 \\rangle,$ and $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\nSo, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 3: Count the cyclic subgroups generated by elements outside of $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\nThese are the subgroups generated by elements of the form $g = x^k y$.\n\n*   **Find the order of these elements:** Let's compute the square of $g$:\n    $g^2 = (x^k y)^2 = (x^k y)(x^k y) = x^k(y x^k y^{-1})y^2$.\n    Using the relation $y^{-1}xy=x^{-1}$, we get $yxy^{-1}=x^{-1}$. Thus, $yx^k y^{-1} = (yxy^{-1})^k = (x^{-1})^k = x^{-k}$.\n    So, $g^2 = x^k(x^{-k})y^2 = (x^k x^{-k})y^2 = 1 \\cdot y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    Since $g^2 = x^{32}$ and $(x^{32})^2=x^{64}=1$, the order of any element $g = x^k y$ is 4.\n\n*   **Count the number of distinct subgroups:** All 64 elements outside of $\\langle x \\rangle$ generate a cyclic subgroup of order 4. We need to find how many of these subgroups are distinct.\n    Two elements $g_1 = x^k y$ and $g_2 = x^j y$ generate the same subgroup if and only if $g_2$ is also a generator of $\\langle g_1 \\rangle$. A cyclic group of order 4 has two generators: the element itself and its cube.\n    The generators of $\\langle g_1 \\rangle = \\langle x^k y \\rangle$ are $g_1$ and $g_1^3$.\n    $g_1^3 = g_1^2 \\cdot g_1 = x^{32} (x^k y)$. The element $x^{32}$ is the unique element of order 2 and is in the center of $Q_{128}$, so it commutes with all other elements.\n    $g_1^3 = x^{32} x^k y = x^{k+32} y$.\n    Therefore, $\\langle x^k y \\rangle = \\langle x^j y \\rangle$ if and only if $j \\equiv k \\pmod{64}$ or $j \\equiv k+32 \\pmod{64}$.\n    This means the 64 generators of the form $x^k y$ are grouped into pairs $\\{x^k y, x^{k+32} y\\}$, where each pair generates the same subgroup. The number of such distinct pairs (and thus subgroups) is $64 / 2 = 32$.\n\nSo, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cyclic subgroups**\n\nThe two sets of subgroups we counted are disjoint. The first set contains subgroups entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$, while the second set contains subgroups that have elements outside of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Therefore, there are no overlaps.\n\nTotal number of cyclic subgroups = (subgroups from within $\\langle x \\rangle$) + (subgroups from outside $\\langle x \\rangle$)\nTotal = 7 + 32 = 39.\n\nThe number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 is 39.\n\n<<<39>>>"
