    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial**\n\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We try to find a factorization of this polynomial. By grouping terms, we notice a common factor:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\n$P(x) = (x^2 - 2)(x^5 - 9x + 3)$\n\nSo the roots of $P(x)$ are the union of the roots of $f(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the splitting fields and Galois groups of the factors**\n\n*   **For $f(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (e.g., by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$). Its roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field is $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ of degree 2. Its Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$ (the cyclic group of order 2).\n\n*   **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. (3 divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3).\n    To determine its Galois group, let's analyze its roots. The derivative is $g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are the roots of $g'(x)=0$, which are $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n    Let's evaluate $g(x)$ at these points:\n    *   At $x_1 = -\\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, $g(x_1)$ is a local maximum. $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 + 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(-9/5+9)+3 = \\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5}+3 > 0$.\n    *   At $x_2 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$, $g(x_2)$ is a local minimum. $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (\\sqrt[4]{9/5})^5 - 9\\sqrt[4]{9/5} + 3 = \\sqrt[4]{9/5}(9/5-9)+3 = -\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5}+3$. Since $(36/5)^4 = (7.2)^4 > 3^4=81$ and $(9/5) = 1.8$, we have $\\frac{36}{5}\\sqrt[4]{9/5} > 3$. So, $g(x_2)<0$.\n    Since the local maximum is positive and the local minimum is negative, $g(x)$ has exactly 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n    The Galois group of an irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with exactly 3 real roots is the symmetric group $S_5$. Let $K_g$ be the splitting field of $g(x)$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and the degree of the extension is $[K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of the splitting field K**\n\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the smallest field containing all roots of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, which is the compositum of their splitting fields: $K = K_f K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})K_g$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q})$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the direct product if and only if $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nLet's examine the intersection $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_g$.\nThe only quadratic subfield of $K_g$ corresponds to the index 2 normal subgroup $A_5$ of $S_5$. This field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$.\nFor a polynomial $x^n + ax + b$, the discriminant is $D = (-1)^{n(n-1)/2} (n^n b^{n-1} + (-1)^{(n-1)/2+1} (n-1)^{n-1} a^n)$. For $g(x)=x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $n=5, a=-9, b=3$.\n$D = (-1)^{10}(5^5 \\cdot 3^4 + (-1)^{3+1} 4^4 \\cdot (-9)^5) = 3125 \\cdot 81 + 256 \\cdot (-59049) = 253125 - 15116544 = -14863419$.\nThe quadratic subfield of $K_g$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-14863419})$, which is an imaginary field.\nThe field $K_f = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real field.\nSince the fields are different, their intersection must be $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThus, $K_f \\cap K_g = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_f/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_g/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K_f:\\mathbb{Q}] \\cdot [K_g:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find all possible degrees of normal sub-extensions**\n\nAccording to the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, normal extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ correspond to proper non-trivial normal subgroups $H$ of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$. The degree of such an extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ are:\n1.  **Product subgroups:** $N_1 \\times N_2$, where $N_1 \\triangleleft C_2$ and $N_2 \\triangleleft S_5$. The proper non-trivial ones are:\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$. Then $|H_1| = 60$, so $[L_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_2 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$. Then $|H_2| = 120$, so $[L_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$. Then $|H_3| = 2$, so $[L_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_4 = C_2 \\times A_5$. Then $|H_4| = 2 \\times 60 = 120$, so $[L_4:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120 = 2$.\n2.  **Diagonal subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotients of normal subgroups. Let $\\phi: C_2/S_1 \\to S_5/S_2$ be an isomorphism. The only possibility for a non-trivial isomorphism is between quotients of the same order. The only non-trivial matching quotients are $C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\n    This gives one more normal subgroup, $H_5 = \\{(c, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = 1 \\text{ if } c \\text{ is trivial, and } \\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = -1 \\text{ otherwise}\\}$. The order of this subgroup is $|H_5|=|A_5|+|S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60+60=120$. So $[L_5:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240/120=2$.\n\n**Step 5: List all the possible degrees**\n\nFrom the calculations above, the possible degrees for such extensions $L$ are the values of the indices we found:\n*   Degree 2 (from $H_2, H_4, H_5$)\n*   Degree 4 (from $H_1$)\n*   Degree 120 (from $H_3$)\n\nSo the set of all possible degrees is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
