    "Answering this question requires finding the number of independent continuous symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions. This number is the dimension of the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **The Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations:**\n    The equations describe the evolution of a velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ and a pressure field $p(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Let's assume constant density $\\rho=1$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n    *   Momentum equation: $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = - \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n    *   Incompressibility condition: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\n2.  **Identifying Symmetries:**\n    A symmetry is a transformation of the independent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and dependent variables $(\\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps any solution to another solution of the equations. We look for one-parameter Lie groups of such transformations and count the number of independent generators.\n\n3.  **Basic Symmetries (Galilean Group):**\n    These symmetries are expected from the physical principles underlying the equations.\n    *   **Time translation:** The equations are autonomous (no explicit dependence on $t$), so they are invariant under $t \\to t + s$. This gives **1 generator**: $\\partial_t$.\n    *   **Space translations:** The equations have no explicit dependence on $\\mathbf{x}$, so they are invariant under $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{a}$. This gives **3 independent generators** (one for each component of $\\mathbf{a}$): $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$.\n    *   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are covariant under rotations, as they are written in vector form using operators ($\\nabla, \\Delta$) that are invariant under rotations. A rotation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is described by the group $SO(3)$, which is 3-dimensional. This gives **3 generators** for rotations about the $x_1, x_2, x_3$ axes (e.g., $J_3 = x_1\\partial_{x_2} - x_2\\partial_{x_1} + u_1\\partial_{u_2} - u_2\\partial_{u_1}$).\n    *   **Galilean Boosts:** These transformations relate solutions in different inertial frames of reference: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$. This is a 3-parameter family of transformations (one for each component of the boost velocity $\\mathbf{v}$). This gives **3 generators** (e.g., $G_1 = t\\partial_{x_1} + \\partial_{u_1}$).\n\n    So far, we have accounted for $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 10$ symmetries. These form the Galilean group.\n\n4.  **Scaling Symmetry:**\n    We look for a scaling transformation of the form $t \\to \\lambda^a t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}$, $p \\to \\lambda^d p$ that leaves the equations invariant. This requires analyzing how each term in the equations transforms.\n    *   $\\partial_t \\mathbf{u} \\sim \\lambda^{a-c}$\n    *   $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} \\sim \\lambda^{b-2c}$\n    *   $\\nabla p \\sim \\lambda^{b-d}$\n    *   $\\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u} \\sim \\lambda^{2b-c}$\n\n    For the equation to remain invariant, the exponents of $\\lambda$ multiplying each term must be the same:\n    $a-c = b-2c = b-d = 2b-c$\n\n    Solving this system of linear equations for the exponents:\n    *   From $b-2c = 2b-c$, we get $c = -b$.\n    *   From $a-c = b-2c$, we get $a = b-c = b - (-b) = 2b$.\n    *   From $b-d = b-2c$, we get $d = 2c = -2b$.\n\n    This gives a one-parameter family of scaling transformations, parametrized by $b$. We can choose $b=1$, which gives $a=2, c=-1, d=-2$. The transformation is:\n    $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\quad \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\quad \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, \\quad p \\to \\lambda^{-2} p$\n    This provides **1 additional generator** for this scaling symmetry. The infinitesimal generator is $D = 2t\\partial_t + \\sum_i x_i\\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_i u_i\\partial_{u_i} - 2p\\partial_p$.\n\n5.  **Total Dimension:**\n    Summing up all the independent generators:\n    *   Time translation: 1\n    *   Space translations: 3\n    *   Spatial rotations: 3\n    *   Galilean boosts: 3\n    *   Scaling: 1\n    Total = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 11$.\n\n    It is a known result that this is the maximal finite-dimensional Lie group of point symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. The infinite-dimensional symmetry group present in the 2D case is broken in 3D by the vortex stretching term.\n\nThe dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is 11.\n\n<<<11>>>"
