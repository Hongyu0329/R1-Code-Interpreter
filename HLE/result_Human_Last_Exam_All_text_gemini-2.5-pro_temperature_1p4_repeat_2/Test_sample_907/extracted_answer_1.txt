a) For negligible interaction between molecules, the absorption cross-section is:
$\sigma(\omega_L) = \frac{2\pi\sqrt{\pi}\tau N}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \omega_0 |\hat{\epsilon} \cdot \vec{\mu}|^2 e^{-(\omega_0-\omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$
Here, $\omega_L$ is the laser frequency, $\tau$ is the pulse duration, $N$ is the number of molecules, $\omega_0$ is the single-molecule transition frequency, $\vec{\mu}$ is the single-molecule transition dipole moment, $\hat{\epsilon}$ is the laser polarization vector, and other symbols are fundamental constants. This represents a single absorption peak, enhanced by a factor of N, at the individual molecule's transition frequency.

b) When nearest-neighbor interactions are considered (Frenkel exciton model), the absorption cross-section is a sum over transitions to different exciton states:
$\sigma(\omega_L) = \frac{2\pi\sqrt{\pi}\tau}{\hbar c \epsilon_0} \sum_{j=1, 3, 5, ...}^{N} \left(\frac{E_j}{\hbar}\right) |\hat{\epsilon} \cdot \vec{\mu}_j|^2 e^{-(E_j/\hbar - \omega_L)^2 \tau^2}$
Here, the sum is over optically allowed exciton states (indexed by odd $j$ for a linear chain).
The exciton energy is $E_j = \hbar\omega_0 + 2J \cos\left(\frac{\pi j}{N+1}\right)$, where $J$ is the coupling energy.
The transition dipole moment to the exciton state is $\vec{\mu}_j = \vec{\mu} \sqrt{\frac{2}{N+1}} \sum_{n=1}^N \sin\left(\frac{\pi j n}{N+1}\right)$.
This describes a spectrum with multiple peaks corresponding to the allowed exciton energies, with intensities governed by the collective transition dipoles $\vec{\mu}_j$.
