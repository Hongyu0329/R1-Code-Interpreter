    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of K.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Tensor and Slice Rank\n\nThe function is given by $f(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$, where $x, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$. This function is viewed as a 3-tensor $F$ in the space $V_1^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_2^{\\otimes n} \\otimes V_3^{\\otimes n}$, where each $V_k^{\\otimes n}$ is the space of complex-valued functions on $\\{0, 1\\}^n$.\n\nThe **slice rank** of a 3-tensor is the smallest integer $r$ such that the tensor can be written as a sum of $r$ \"slices\". A slice is a tensor of rank 1 in one of the three possible bipartitions of the tensor product space. That is, a slice is a tensor that can be written in one of the following forms:\n1.  $u(x) B(y, z)$ (a type-1 slice)\n2.  $v(y) C(x, z)$ (a type-2 slice)\n3.  $w(z) D(x, y)$ (a type-3 slice)\n\nThe slice rank of a tensor $T$ is denoted as $\\text{slice-rank}(T)$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposing the Tensor $F$\n\nWe can write the tensor $F$ as the difference of two tensors, $G$ and $H$:\n$F = G - H$, where\n*   $G(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i)$\n*   $H(x, y, z) = 1$ (the constant function)\n\nThe slice rank is sub-additive, which means $\\text{slice-rank}(F) \\le \\text{slice-rank}(G) + \\text{slice-rank}(H)$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Slice Rank of $H$\n\nThe tensor $H$ is the constant function $1$. We can write it as $H(x,y,z) = u(x)B(y,z)$ where $u(x)=1$ for all $x$ and $B(y,z)=1$ for all $y,z$. This is a type-1 slice. Therefore, $\\text{slice-rank}(H) = 1$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Slice Rank of $G$\n\nThe tensor $G$ is a tensor product of $n$ smaller tensors. Let $g_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = x_1 + y_1 + z_1$ be a tensor in $V_1 \\otimes V_2 \\otimes V_3$. Then $G = g_1^{\\otimes n}$.\n\nA known property of slice rank for this type of tensor product is that if the minimal slice decomposition of the base tensor $g_1$ consists of slices of the same type, then $\\text{slice-rank}(g_1^{\\otimes n}) = (\\text{slice-rank}(g_1))^n$.\n\nLet's find the slice rank of $g_1$.\nFirst, we check if $\\text{slice-rank}(g_1)=1$. If it were, we could write $g_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = u(x_1)B(y_1,z_1)$.\nFor $x_1=0$, we'd have $y_1+z_1 = u(0)B(y_1,z_1)$. Assuming $u(0) \\ne 0$, $B(y_1,z_1)=(y_1+z_1)/u(0)$.\nFor $x_1=1$, we'd have $1+y_1+z_1 = u(1)B(y_1,z_1) = \\frac{u(1)}{u(0)}(y_1+z_1)$. Let $c=\\frac{u(1)}{u(0)}$. Then $1+y_1+z_1 = c(y_1+z_1)$. This equation cannot hold for all $y_1, z_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ (e.g., for $y_1=z_1=0$, we get $1=0$). Similar contradictions arise for slices of other types. So, $\\text{slice-rank}(g_1) > 1$.\n\nNow, let's try to decompose $g_1$ as a sum of two slices. Consider the following decomposition:\n$g_1(x_1, y_1, z_1) = (y_1 + z_1) + x_1$.\nThis can be written as $1 \\cdot (y_1+z_1) + x_1 \\cdot 1$.\nLet $u_1(x_1) = 1$ and $B_1(y_1, z_1) = y_1+z_1$. The term $u_1(x_1)B_1(y_1, z_1)$ is a type-1 slice.\nLet $u_2(x_1) = x_1$ and $B_2(y_1, z_1) = 1$. The term $u_2(x_1)B_2(y_1, z_1)$ is also a type-1 slice.\nSo, $g_1 = u_1B_1 + u_2B_2$ is a sum of two slices of type-1.\nThis shows that $\\text{slice-rank}(g_1) \\le 2$. Since we know the rank is greater than 1, we have $\\text{slice-rank}(g_1) = 2$.\n\nSince the decomposition uses slices of the same type, we can find the slice rank of $G$:\n$\\text{slice-rank}(G) = \\text{slice-rank}(g_1^{\\otimes n}) = (\\text{slice-rank}(g_1))^n = 2^n$.\n\n### Step 5: Bounding the Slice Rank of $F$\n\nUsing the sub-additivity property, we get an upper bound for the slice rank of $F$:\n$\\text{slice-rank}(F) \\le \\text{slice-rank}(G) + \\text{slice-rank}(H) = 2^n + 1$.\n\nTo find a lower bound, we use the property that the slice rank of a tensor is at least the size of any \"diagonal\" set on which the tensor is non-zero. A set $D = \\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)}, z^{(i)})\\}$ is a diagonal set if for any two distinct elements $i,j$, we have $x^{(i)} \\ne x^{(j)}$, $y^{(i)} \\ne y^{(j)}$, and $z^{(i)} \\ne z^{(j)}$.\n\nConsider the diagonal set $\\Delta = \\{ (x, x, x) \\mid x \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n \\}$. The size of this set is $2^n$.\nLet's evaluate our function $F$ on this set:\n$F(x, x, x) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + x_i + x_i) - 1 = \\prod_{i=1}^n (3x_i) - 1$.\n*   If $x$ contains any component $x_i = 0$, the product becomes 0, so $F(x,x,x) = 0 - 1 = -1 \\ne 0$.\n*   If all components of $x$ are 1 (i.e., $x = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)$), the product is $3^n$, so $F(x,x,x) = 3^n - 1 \\ne 0$.\nSo, the function $F$ is non-zero for all points in the diagonal set $\\Delta$.\nThis implies that the slice rank of $F$ must be at least the size of $\\Delta$:\n$\\text{slice-rank}(F) \\ge |\\Delta| = 2^n$.\n\nCombining the bounds, we have $2^n \\le \\text{slice-rank}(F) \\le 2^n + 1$.\n\n### Step 6: Determining K\n\nThe question states that the slice rank of $F$ is given by the expression $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. Let $s_n = \\text{slice-rank}(F)$.\nWe have $s_n = (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$.\nTaking the $n$-th root and the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (s_n)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left( (3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)} \\right)^{1/n} = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (3/2^K) e^{o(n)/n} = 3/2^K$.\n\nNow, let's compute this limit using our bounds for $s_n$:\n$2^n \\le s_n \\le 2^n + 1$.\n$(2^n)^{1/n} \\le (s_n)^{1/n} \\le (2^n + 1)^{1/n}$.\n$2 \\le (s_n)^{1/n} \\le 2(1 + 1/2^n)^{1/n}$.\n\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, the term $(1 + 1/2^n)^{1/n}$ approaches 1. (Specifically, using the approximation $(1+x)^a \\approx 1+ax$ for small $x$, it is $\\approx 1+1/(n2^n) \\to 1$).\nSo, by the Squeeze Theorem:\n$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (s_n)^{1/n} = 2$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the limit:\n$3/2^K = 2$.\n$2^K = 3/2$.\n$K = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n\nThis can also be written as $K = \\log_2(3) - \\log_2(2) = \\log_2(3) - 1$."
