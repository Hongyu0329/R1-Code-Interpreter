    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the \"Sir Launfal\" in question.**\nThe question refers to the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written by Thomas Chestre in the late 14th century. It is important to distinguish this from the earlier Old French lai, *Lanval*, by Marie de France, upon which it is based, as they are preserved in different manuscripts.\n\n**Step 2: Locate the manuscript containing *Sir Launfal*.**\nThe only complete surviving manuscript of Thomas Chestre's *Sir Launfal* is a famous collection known as **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is part of the Cotton collection held at the British Library. This manuscript is a miscellany, meaning it contains several different works bound together.\n\n**Step 3: Examine the other contents of the Cotton MS Caligula A.ii manuscript.**\nTo find what was \"preserved alongside\" *Sir Launfal*, we must look at the other texts included in this specific manuscript. The collection includes a variety of genres, such as other romances (*Emar√©*, *Libeaus Desconus*), religious texts, and instructional poems.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript.**\nA \"book of manners,\" also known as a courtesy book, is a text that provides instruction on proper social conduct, etiquette, and behavior, often for young people serving in noble households. By examining the table of contents for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find a poem that fits this description perfectly.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Specificity of the Manuscript:** The answer hinges entirely on the contents of the *specific* manuscript that contains *Sir Launfal*, which is Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n*   **Genre Identification:** One must correctly identify which of the texts in the manuscript qualifies as a \"book of manners.\" Titles can be very revealing.\n*   **The Text in Question:** The manuscript contains a poem explicitly on this topic called ***The Boke of Curtasye*** (often translated as *The Book of Courtesy*). This work details the proper conduct for a young man, from table manners to his duties within a great lord's household.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the contents of the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, the book of manners that was preserved alongside the poem *Sir Launfal* is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
