    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question**\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the title, \"The Bays,\" as the question itself. The haiku that follows provides the clues to find the answer. The final instruction is that the answer should be presented in alphabetical order. The title \"The Bays\" is a homophone, a play on words, and should be interpreted as \"The B's\". The riddle is asking to identify a set of words that start with the letter 'B'. The three lines of the haiku each provide a clue for one of these 'B' words.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Haiku for Clues**\n\n*   **Clue 1: \"An August tempest\"**\n    *   **Careful Points:** We need to find a word starting with 'B' that is described by this phrase.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"August\" can mean the month, but it also means majestic, respected, or imposing. A \"tempest\" is a violent, chaotic storm. Therefore, we are looking for something that can be described as a majestic and violent event.\n    *   **Inference:** A **BOMB** fits this description perfectly. Its explosion is both a terrifying, tempestuous event and can be described as \"august\" in its awesome and terrible power.\n\n*   **Clue 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**\n    *   **Careful Points:** This clue combines a number and a well-known idiom.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"Twice fifteen\" is a straightforward calculation: 2 * 15 = 30. The phrase \"brings winds of change\" suggests a powerful, transformative, and often sudden impact. We need to find a 'B' word associated with the number 30 that has such an effect.\n    *   **Inference:** The number 30 is significant in the context of firearms. The \".30 caliber\" is a very common class of ammunition. A **BULLET** of this type certainly \"brings winds of change\" in a very direct and irreversible way for its target.\n\n*   **Clue 3: \"A divine one yields\"**\n    *   **Careful Points:** This line is metaphorical, referring to a higher power and what it provides.\n    *   **Analysis:** \"A divine one\" is a poetic way of referring to God or a supreme being. The word \"yields\" means to produce or provide. We are looking for a 'B' word that is considered a product of a divine entity.\n    *   **Inference:** In many religions, particularly Christianity, the **BIBLE** is considered the word of God, yielded or given to humanity by a \"divine one\".\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Order the Final Answer**\nWe have identified three words that fit the clues and start with the letter 'B':\n1.  BOMB\n2.  BULLET\n3.  BIBLE\n\nThe question requires the final answer to be in alphabetical order.\n\n**Final Analysis:**\n1.  Arrange the words alphabetically: BIBLE, BOMB, BULLET.\n2.  This set of three words represents \"The B's\" that the riddle asks for.\n\n<<<BIBLE, BOMB, BULLET>>>"
