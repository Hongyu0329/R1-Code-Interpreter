    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** This is a 2D square grid where movement is restricted to up, down, left, or right, like moving between blocks in Manhattan. Points are represented by integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **n-step Walk:** A sequence of n moves, where each move takes you from a point (x, y) to an adjacent point (x±1, y) or (x, y±1).\n*   **Self-Avoiding Walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once.\n*   **a(n):** The total number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks. Due to the symmetry of the lattice, we can fix the starting point (e.g., at (0,0)) and the total count will be the same.\n*   **Goal:** Find the value of a(10).\n\n### Step 2: The Recursive Counting Method\nThere is no simple closed-form formula for a(n). The values are typically calculated using a recursive enumeration method, which becomes computationally intensive very quickly. The principle is as follows:\n\nTo find a(n), we can take every possible SAW of length (n-1) and count the number of valid ways to add one more step.\n\n*   A walk of length (n-1) is a sequence of points (p0, p1, ..., p_{n-1}).\n*   To extend it, we move from the endpoint p_{n-1} to a new point p_n.\n*   The point p_n must be a neighbor of p_{n-1}. There are 4 neighbors.\n*   The move cannot be an immediate reversal, so p_n cannot be p_{n-2}. This leaves 3 potential moves.\n*   For the walk to remain self-avoiding, the new point p_n must not have been visited before. That is, p_n must not be in the set {p0, p1, ..., p_{n-2}}.\n\nThe number a(n) is the sum of all valid extensions for all (n-1)-step SAWs.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating for Small `n`\nLet's apply this method to see how it works and where the complexity arises.\n\n*   **a(0):** A 0-step walk is just the starting point. By convention, a(0) = 1.\n*   **a(1):** From the start point (0,0), there are 4 possible moves (Up, Down, Left, Right). All are valid 1-step SAWs.\n    *   a(1) = 4.\n*   **a(2):** Take each of the 4 walks of length 1. From the endpoint, there are 3 non-reversing moves. The only other point on the path is the origin, which is not one of these 3 neighbors. So, all 3 extensions are valid.\n    *   a(2) = 4 walks * 3 extensions/walk = 12.\n*   **a(3):** Take each of the 12 walks of length 2, (p0, p1, p2). From the endpoint p2, we must avoid going to p1 (which is handled by the \"3 non-reversing moves\" rule) and p0. For any 2-step walk, p0 is not a direct neighbor of p2, so no self-intersection is possible yet.\n    *   a(3) = 12 walks * 3 extensions/walk = 36.\n*   **a(4):** This is where it gets complicated. We extend the 36 walks of length 3, (p0, p1, p2, p3). The new point p4 cannot be p0 or p1. p4 is never a neighbor of p1 (for a 3-step SAW), but p4 can be a neighbor of p0.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We must identify the 3-step walks where the endpoint p3 is a neighbor of the starting point p0. An example is the path Right-Up-Left, which goes (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (1,1) -> (0,1). The endpoint (0,1) is a neighbor of the start point (0,0).\n    *   There are 8 such \"pre-closure\" paths. For each of these, one of the 3 possible non-reversing moves would lead back to the origin p0. This move is forbidden. So, these 8 paths only have 2 valid extensions.\n    *   The remaining 36 - 8 = 28 paths do not have their endpoint adjacent to the origin. For them, all 3 extensions are valid.\n    *   a(4) = (8 paths * 2 extensions) + (28 paths * 3 extensions) = 16 + 84 = 100.\n\n### Step 4: The Challenge of Calculating a(10)\nTo calculate a(5), we would need to analyze all 100 4-step walks and, for each, determine if its endpoint is a neighbor of any of its previous points (excluding the last two). This process of classifying path shapes and counting their extension possibilities becomes exponentially harder with each step.\n\n*   To find a(5), one must count for each of the 100 paths how many intersections would be created by the next step. The result is a(5) = 284.\n*   To continue this process up to a(10) by hand is infeasible and extremely prone to error.\n\n### Step 5: Acquiring the Final Answer\nSince direct calculation is not practical, and the problem is a well-known one in computational physics and combinatorics, the standard approach is to use the values that have been found through extensive computer enumeration. These values are recorded in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).\n\nThe sequence for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged as sequence A001411. The known values are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2,172\n*   a(8) = 5,916\n*   a(9) = 16,268\n*   **a(10) = 44,100**\n\nThus, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
