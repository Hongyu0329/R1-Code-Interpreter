    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define the Key Terms**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  **Non-polar**\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**\n\nLet's define each of these properties in the context of crystal symmetry (point groups).\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light that passes through it. The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to exhibit natural optical activity is that it must be **chiral**.\n*   **Chiral:** A structure is chiral if it cannot be superimposed on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry operations, a crystal class is chiral if its point group **lacks any roto-inversion operations**. Roto-inversion operations include a center of inversion (`i` or `-1`) and mirror planes (`m`, which is equivalent to a `-2` axis). The complete set of symmetry elements that destroy chirality are `-1, m, -3, -4, -6`.\n*   **Achiral:** This is the opposite of chiral. A structure is achiral if it *can* be superimposed on its mirror image. This means its point group **must possess at least one roto-inversion operation** (`-1`, `m`, `-3`, `-4`, or `-6`).\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar direction (a vector direction whose positive and negative ends are not equivalent by any symmetry operation of the point group). The classes that *are* polar are the 10 pyroelectric classes: `1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm`. A non-polar class is any class not in this list. Centrosymmetric classes (those with an inversion center) are a major subset of non-polar classes.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Conditions for Contradictions**\n\nNow let's look at the conditions from the question again.\n\n*   Condition 3: **\"Have the correct symmetry for optical activity\"**. As defined above, this means the crystal class must be **chiral**.\n*   Condition 1: The crystal class must be **achiral**.\n\nThese two conditions are mutually exclusive. A crystal class is either chiral or achiral; it cannot be both.\n*   Chiral classes lack any roto-inversion symmetry.\n*   Achiral classes must have at least one roto-inversion symmetry.\n\nTherefore, there is a fundamental contradiction in the question's premises. It is impossible for an achiral crystal class to have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### **Step 3: List Crystal Classes for Each Property to Verify**\n\nTo be certain, let's list the crystal classes belonging to each category. There are 32 crystallographic point groups in total.\n\n*   **Classes with Correct Symmetry for Optical Activity (The 11 Chiral Classes):**\n    `1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432`\n\n*   **Achiral Classes (The remaining 21 Classes):**\n    `-1, m, 2/m, mm2, mmm, -4, 4/m, 4mm, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, 3m, -3m, -6, 6/m, 6mm, -6m2, 6/mmm, m-3, -43m, m-3m`\n\n*   **Non-polar Classes (The 22 classes that are not polar):**\n    `-1, 2/m, 222, mmm, -4, 4/m, 422, -42m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 32, -6, 6/m, 622, -6m2, 6/mmm, 23, m-3, 432, -43m, m-3m`\n\n### **Step 4: Find the Intersection of the Sets**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are in all three sets. We start by finding the intersection of the \"Achiral\" set and the \"Optically Active\" set.\n\n*   Set A (Achiral) = {`-1, m, 2/m, ...`}\n*   Set B (Optically Active) = {`1, 2, 222, ...`}\n\nThe intersection of Set A and Set B is the empty set (A ∩ B = ∅). There are no crystal classes that are both achiral and optically active.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nBecause the conditions of being \"achiral\" and having \"the correct symmetry for optical activity\" are contradictory, no crystal class can satisfy both simultaneously. The addition of the \"non-polar\" condition does not change this outcome. The set of crystal classes that meets the specified criteria is empty.\n\n<<<There are no crystal classes that satisfy these conditions, as the property of being achiral is mutually exclusive with having the correct symmetry for optical activity (which requires chirality).>>>"
