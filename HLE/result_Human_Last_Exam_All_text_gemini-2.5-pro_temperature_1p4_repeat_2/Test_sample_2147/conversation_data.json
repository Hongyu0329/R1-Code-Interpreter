    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of X-Y.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the key figure and his general stance:** The question centers on Pavel Milyukov. He was a prominent Russian historian and the leader of the liberal Constitutional Democratic Party (the Kadets). It is crucial to note that he was a \"Westernizer,\" meaning he generally looked to Western Europe for political and social models, as opposed to the Slavophiles who believed in a unique Russian path. This makes his criticism of the West particularly pointed and significantâ€”it's the critique of a disillusioned admirer, not a staunch opponent.\n\n2.  **Analyze the core accusation:** Milyukov is quoted as denouncing something as a \"stagnant swamp.\" This metaphor implies decay, corruption, lack of progress, and a bogged-down, ineffective state of affairs.\n\n3.  **Connect the accusation to its target:** The question states he \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\" and specifically denounced \"X-Y\". This indicates that X-Y is a specific institution or concept within the broader framework of Western culture that Milyukov found particularly flawed.\n\n4.  **Conduct focused research:** A search for Pavel Milyukov's critiques of the West, especially using the key phrase \"stagnant swamp,\" leads to his writings and speeches on political systems. Historical sources consistently show that Milyukov grew deeply disillusioned with the functioning of Western European governments.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific term (X-Y):** Milyukov's disappointment was not with the *idea* of democracy or representative government, but with its practical application in Europe. He observed the party politics, the endless debates, the political maneuvering, and the compromises, and came to see the system as ineffective and corrupt. The specific political system he was referring to was **European Parliamentarism**. He felt it had lost its revolutionary and progressive spirit and had devolved into a self-serving and stagnant political game.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the findings:** Pavel Milyukov, a Russian liberal who once admired Western political structures, came to believe that European Parliamentarism had failed to live up to its ideals. He viewed it as a corrupt and decaying system, which he memorably described as a \"stagnant swamp.\" Therefore, \"X\" is \"European\" and \"Y\" is \"Parliamentarism\".\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nBased on the analysis of Pavel Milyukov's political thought and his specific critiques of Western political systems, the term X-Y he denounced is identified.\n\n<<<European Parliamentarism>>>"
