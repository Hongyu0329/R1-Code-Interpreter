    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to calculate the \"rule activation level\". In the context of a fuzzy inference system, this refers to the result of the implication step. In this step, the firing strength of the antecedent (the \"IF\" part of the rule) is combined with the membership function of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part of the rule). This process determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule before it's aggregated with the outputs of other rules.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Given Information**\n*   **Antecedent Firing Strength (`Phi_k(x′)`):** 0.7. This value represents the degree to which the condition(s) in the antecedent of the k-th rule are met for a given input `x'`.\n*   **Consequent Membership Grade (`μG_k_j(y_j)`):** 0.9. This value represents the membership degree of a specific point `y_j` in the fuzzy set `G_k_j`, which is the consequent of the k-th rule.\n*   **Operation:** t-norm. This is the mathematical operator specified for combining the antecedent firing strength and the consequent membership.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Context and Note Careful Points**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" Context.**\n    The question mentions \"interval type-3 fuzzy set\" (IT3 FS). In a rigorous IT3 fuzzy system, the firing strength and consequent memberships are not single numbers but are themselves complex fuzzy sets (specifically, interval type-2 fuzzy sets). However, the problem provides simple scalar values (0.7 and 0.9). This implies a significant simplification. We must proceed with the assumption that these numbers are representative scalar values (like principal memberships or upper bounds) for the purpose of this specific calculation. The core logic of the implication step remains the same, but it's applied to these simplified values.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The Choice of t-norm.**\n    A \"t-norm\" is a family of functions (like `min`, `product`, etc.). The problem does not specify which t-norm to use. In fuzzy control systems, especially those using Mamdani-style inference, the most common t-norm used for implication is the **minimum (min)** operator. This operation \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set at the level of the antecedent's firing strength. We will use the `min` operator as the standard and most common choice.\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**\nThe rule activation level is found by applying the chosen t-norm to the two given values.\n\n*   **Formula:** `Activation Level = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership Grade)`\n*   **Substituting values:** `Activation Level = t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n*   **Applying the minimum (min) t-norm:** `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n**Step 5: Acquire the Final Answer**\nBy calculating the minimum of the two values, we get:\n*   `Activation Level = 0.7`\n\nThis means that the membership grade of `y_j` in the activated consequent fuzzy set for this rule is 0.7. The original consequent set is essentially \"clipped\" at a height of 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
