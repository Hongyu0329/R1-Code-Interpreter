The best replacement for the amino acids at positions 47-50 (Serine-Glutamate-Glutamate-Aspartate) would be to mutate all four residues to Alanine. This would change the sequence to Alanine-Alanine-Alanine-Alanine (AAAA). This is because Alanine is a small, neutral, and non-polar amino acid that would remove the negative charges from Glutamate and Aspartate, and it cannot be phosphorylated, thus preventing the addition of a negative charge at the Serine position.
