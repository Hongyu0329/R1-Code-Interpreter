    "This question asks for the final product of a two-step organic synthesis reaction. Let's break down the reaction step by step.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Material**\n\n*   The starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n*   Let's draw its structure:\n    *   \"Benzamide\" indicates a benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N- group.\n    *   \"N,N-diethyl\" means two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide.\n    *   \"3-dimethylamino\" means a dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached to position 3 of the benzene ring, which is meta to the amide group.\n\n    The structure is a benzene ring with a -C(=O)NEt₂ group at position 1 and a -N(CH₃)₂ group at position 3.\n\n**2. Analyze the First Reaction Step: `sec-BuLi` and `TMEDA` in THF**\n\n*   This set of reagents is used for a **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)** reaction.\n*   `sec-BuLi` (sec-butyllithium) is a very strong base. It is capable of removing a proton (deprotonation) directly from an aromatic ring.\n*   `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) is a ligand that complexes with the lithium ion (Li⁺), increasing the basicity of the sec-butyl anion and helping to direct the reaction.\n*   The reaction is \"directed\" because the lithium ion first coordinates to a Lewis basic group on the benzene ring, called a Directing Metalation Group (DMG). This brings the base close to a proton at the *ortho* position (the adjacent carbon), making that proton the most acidic and the one that gets removed.\n*   Our starting molecule has two potential DMGs:\n    1.  The **amide group** (-C(=O)NEt₂): The carbonyl oxygen is a strong Lewis base and an excellent directing group. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n    2.  The **dimethylamino group** (-N(CH₃)₂): The nitrogen atom's lone pair is also Lewis basic, making it a directing group. It directs lithiation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n\n*   **Determining the Site of Lithiation:**\n    *   The amide group is a significantly more powerful DMG than the amino group. Therefore, the lithiation will occur at a position ortho to the amide, i.e., at C2 or C6.\n    *   Now we compare the C2 and C6 positions. The C2 position is special because it is ortho to *both* the amide and the amino groups. Deprotonation at C2 allows the resulting lithium ion to form a stable six-membered chelate ring, coordinating simultaneously with the amide oxygen and the amine nitrogen. This cooperative effect makes the C2 proton by far the most acidic and the exclusive site of metalation.\n    *   Therefore, the first step produces an aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**3. Analyze the Second Reaction Step: Methyl Iodide (`CH₃I`)**\n\n*   The aryllithium compound formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile. The carbon atom bonded to lithium (C2) has a strong negative charge character.\n*   Methyl iodide (`CH₃I`) is an electrophile. The carbon atom is electron-deficient due to the electronegative iodine atom.\n*   The nucleophilic C2 atom of the aryllithium intermediate will attack the electrophilic methyl carbon of `CH₃I`. This is a nucleophilic substitution reaction (specifically, Sₙ2-like) where the lithium is replaced by the methyl group and lithium iodide (LiI) is formed as a byproduct.\n\n**4. The Final Product**\n\n*   The reaction sequence replaces the hydrogen atom at the C2 position of the starting material with a methyl group.\n*   The final compound is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n### **Summary of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Identify DMGs:** Recognize both the amide and amino groups as potential directing groups for lithiation.\n*   **DMG Hierarchy:** Know that the amide group is a much stronger directing group than the amino group.\n*   **Regioselectivity:** The site of lithiation is determined primarily by the strongest DMG.\n*   **Cooperative Chelation:** Notice that the C2 position is ortho to both DMGs. This leads to a highly stabilized, chelated intermediate, making C2 the overwhelmingly preferred site for deprotonation over C6.\n*   **Reaction of Aryllithium:** Understand that the aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile that will react with the added electrophile (methyl iodide).\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the product is obtained by methylating the benzene ring at the position ortho to the amide group and ortho to the dimethylamino group.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
