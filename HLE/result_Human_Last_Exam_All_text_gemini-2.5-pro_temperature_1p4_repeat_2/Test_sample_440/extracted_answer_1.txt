The density profile is given by \(\rho(z) = M_A c_A(z) + M_B c_B(z)\), where \(c_A(z)\) and \(c_B(z)\) are the molar concentration profiles. These profiles are the numerical solutions to the system of coupled ordinary differential equations derived from the equilibrium condition of constant total chemical potential for each species, \(\frac{d\mu_i(z)}{dz} = -M_i g\), subject to integral boundary conditions that conserve the total number of particles of each gas in the container volume. An analytical solution is not feasible due to the non-linearities of the van der Waals interactions.
