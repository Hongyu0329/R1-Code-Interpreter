    "Step-by-step analysis:\n1.  The first step is to identify the specific medication in question. The user is asking about two distinct products: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n2.  The second step is to determine the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule. By consulting reliable drug identification databases, the standard imprint for this capsule is \"TEVA\" on one part and a number on the other part. The specific number associated with the 10mg dosage from Teva is **7168**.\n3.  The third step is to determine the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule. Using the same reliable sources, the standard imprint for this capsule also includes \"TEVA\" and a specific number. The number associated with the 20mg dosage from Teva is **7169**.\n4.  The fourth step is to carefully review the user's constraints. The response must not mention color, the word \"PLIVA\", or size differences. The question asks specifically for the \"different numbers\".\n5.  The final step is to synthesize the information gathered. The number on the 10mg capsule is 7168, and the number on the 20mg capsule is 7169. These are the different numbers imprinted on the two specified capsules.\n\nCareful points:\n*   It is crucial to specify the brand (Teva), as different manufacturers use different imprints for the same drug and dosage.\n*   The information must be sourced from up-to-date and reliable pharmaceutical databases to ensure accuracy.\n*   Strict adherence to the negative constraints (no color, \"PLIVA\", or size mentions) is required. The focus must remain solely on the numerical imprints.\n\n<<<The Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 7168, and the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 7169.>>>"
