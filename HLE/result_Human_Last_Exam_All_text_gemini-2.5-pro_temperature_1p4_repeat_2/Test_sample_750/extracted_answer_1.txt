The solutions are given by the set $z_{k,n} = i \frac{W_n(-\frac{\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\frac{\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for all integers $k, n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = i \frac{W_0(-\frac{\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\frac{\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for integers $k \le -1$.
