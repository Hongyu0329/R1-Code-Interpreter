    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation using the definition of complex exponentiation.**\nThe equation is $z \\cdot i = i^z$. The term $i^z$ is a multi-valued complex exponentiation, defined as $i^z = e^{z \\log(i)}$.\nThe complex logarithm, $\\log(i)$, is also multi-valued. The formula is $\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i(\\arg(w) + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFor $w=i$, we have $|i|=1$ and the principal argument $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nSo, $\\log(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's denote $C_k = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for some integer $k$.\n\nThe original equation becomes:\n$z \\cdot i = e^{z \\cdot \\log(i)} = e^{z C_k}$\n\n**Step 2: Manipulate the equation to isolate z.**\nThis step requires care because we are dealing with a transcendental equation.\nA standard method is to take the logarithm of both sides. However, a more direct approach that avoids some pitfalls with logarithms of complex numbers is as follows:\nStarting from $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we can write:\n$z = \\frac{i^z}{i} = i^{z-1}$.\n\nNow, take the complex logarithm of both sides. This means that for some integer $m$, a value of $\\log(z)$ must equal a value of $\\log(i^{z-1})$:\n$\\log(z) = \\log(i^{z-1})$\n$\\log(z) = (z-1)\\log(i)$\nThis step is justified because $e^{\\log(z)} = z$ and $e^{(z-1)\\log(i)} = i^{z-1}$.\n\nUsing our expression for $\\log(i)$:\n$\\log(z) = (z-1) \\cdot i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$\nThis equation must hold for some integer $k$. Note that the choice of branch for $\\log(z)$ is implicitly handled in the subsequent steps.\nLet $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\nSo, $\\log(z) = (z-1) i A_k$.\n\nExponentiating both sides:\n$e^{\\log(z)} = e^{(z-1) i A_k}$\n$z = e^{z i A_k} e^{-i A_k}$\nTo solve for $z$, we rearrange the equation into a form suitable for the Lambert W function.\n$z e^{-z i A_k} = e^{-i A_k}$\n\n**Step 3: Use the Lambert W function to solve for z.**\nThe Lambert W function, $W(x)$, is defined as the function that satisfies $W(x)e^{W(x)} = x$. It is a multi-valued function with branches indexed by an integer $n$, denoted $W_n(x)$.\n\nLet $u = -z i A_k$. This means $z = \\frac{u}{-iA_k} = \\frac{iu}{A_k}$.\nSubstituting this into our equation:\n$(\\frac{iu}{A_k}) e^u = e^{-i A_k}$\n$u e^u = \\frac{A_k}{i} e^{-i A_k} = -i A_k e^{-i A_k}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the right side, $-i A_k e^{-i A_k}$.\nRecall that $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$. Therefore, $e^{-iA_k} = e^{-i(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi)} = e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{2}} e^{-i2k\\pi} = -i \\cdot 1 = -i$.\nSo, the right side becomes:\n$-i A_k (-i) = -i^2 A_k = -(-1)A_k = A_k$.\n\nThe equation simplifies dramatically to:\n$u e^u = A_k$\n\nThe solutions for $u$ are given by the branches of the Lambert W function:\n$u = W_n(A_k)$, for any integer $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we substitute back to find $z$:\n$z = \\frac{iu}{A_k} = i \\frac{W_n(A_k)}{A_k}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $A_k$:\n$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for any integers $k, n$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the general solution to find specific types of solutions.**\nThis formula gives all possible complex solutions for $z$. We can analyze it for different values of $k$ and $n$ to identify real, purely imaginary, and other complex solutions.\n\n**A. Real Solutions ($z \\in \\mathbb{R}$)**\nWe found $z = 1$ and $z = -1$ by simple inspection in the original equation. Let's see how they arise from the general formula.\n1.  **For $z=1$**:\n    $1 = i \\frac{W_n(A_k)}{A_k} \\implies W_n(A_k) = \\frac{A_k}{i} = -iA_k$.\n    We check if $w = -iA_k$ satisfies $we^w=A_k$.\n    $(-iA_k)e^{-iA_k} = A_k \\implies -i e^{-iA_k} = 1 \\implies e^{-iA_k} = i$.\n    $-iA_k = \\log(i) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi)$ for some integer $j$.\n    $-A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi \\implies -(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2j\\pi \\implies -\\pi -2(k+j)\\pi = 0$, which is impossible.\n    There's a calculation error in the thought block. Let's re-evaluate $-C_k e^{-C_k}$.\n    $C_k=iA_k$. Let's solve $ue^u=-C_k e^{-C_k}$. So $u=W_n(-iA_k e^{-iA_k})$.\n    $e^{-iA_k}=-i$. So the RHS is $-iA_k(-i)=-A_k$. So $ue^u=-A_k$.\n    My re-derivation in thought block was correct. So $u=W_n(-A_k)$.\n    $z = \\frac{iu}{A_k}$ is incorrect. $z = \\frac{u}{-iA_k} = i\\frac{u}{A_k}$. This is correct.\n    So $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$.\n\n    1. **For $z=1$**: $1 = i\\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k} \\implies W_n(-A_k) = -iA_k$.\n       Let $w = -iA_k$. Check if $we^w=-A_k$: $(-iA_k)e^{-iA_k} = -A_k \\implies ie^{-iA_k}=1 \\implies e^{-iA_k}=-i$. This is correct since $A_k=\\pi/2+2k\\pi$. So $z=1$ is a solution.\n    2. **For $z=-1$**: $-1 = i\\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k} \\implies W_n(-A_k) = iA_k$.\n       Let $w = iA_k$. Check if $we^w=-A_k$: $(iA_k)e^{iA_k} = -A_k \\implies ie^{iA_k}=-1 \\implies e^{iA_k}=i$. This is also correct. So $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\nThe branch indices $n$ corresponding to these solutions can be determined, confirming they are part of the general solution set.\n\n**B. Purely Imaginary Solutions ($z = iy, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$)**\nFor $z$ to be purely imaginary, $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$ must be of the form $iy$. This means $\\frac{W_n(-A_k)}{A_k}$ must be a real number. Since $A_k$ is real, $W_n(-A_k)$ must be real.\nThe Lambert function $W_n(x)$ is real only under specific conditions:\n- If $x \\ge 0$, only the principal branch $n=0$ gives a real value, $W_0(x)$.\n- If $-1/e \\le x < 0$, branches $n=0$ and $n=-1$ give real values.\n\nLet's check the argument of $W$, which is $-A_k = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$.\n- For $-A_k \\ge 0$, we need $1+4k \\le 0 \\implies k \\le -1$. In this case, $W_0(-A_k)$ is real.\n  This gives the solutions $z_{k,0} = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1$.\n- The condition $-1/e \\le -A_k < 0$ implies $0 < A_k \\le 1/e$.\n  $0 < \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) \\le 1/e$. This implies $k \\ge 0$. However, $\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4(0)) = \\pi/2 \\approx 1.57 > 1/e \\approx 0.367$. There is no integer $k$ that satisfies this.\nSo, the only purely imaginary solutions are from the first case.\n\n**C. Other Complex Solutions**\nAll other pairs of integers $(k, n)$ yield complex solutions where both the real and imaginary parts are non-zero. For example:\n- For any $k \\ge 0$, the argument $-A_k$ is negative and less than $-1/e$. All branches $W_n(-A_k)$ are complex. This gives an infinite set of complex solutions for each such $k$. The real solutions $z=1, -1$ are specific instances within this set.\n- For any $k \\le -1$, all branches with $n \\ne 0$ give complex values for $W_n(-A_k)$, resulting in another infinite family of complex solutions.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe solutions for $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ in the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ are given by the formula:\n$$z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$$\nwhere $k$ and $n$ are any integers, and $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function.\n\nThis set of all solutions includes the following specific cases:\n1.  **Two real solutions:**\n    *   $z = 1$\n    *   $z = -1$\n\n2.  **An infinite number of purely imaginary solutions:**\n    *   These solutions correspond to the principal branch ($n=0$) of the Lambert W function for $k \\le -1$:\n        $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)} \\quad \\text{for } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\le -1$.\n\n3.  **An infinite number of other complex solutions** (where both real and imaginary parts are non-zero) given by all other pairs of integers $(k,n)$.\n\n<<<The solutions are given by the set $z_{k,n} = i \\frac{W_n(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for all integers $k, n$, where $W_n$ is the $n$-th branch of the Lambert W function. This includes the real solutions $z=1$ and $z=-1$, and an infinite set of purely imaginary solutions $z_k = i \\frac{W_0(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)}$ for integers $k \\le -1$.>>>"
