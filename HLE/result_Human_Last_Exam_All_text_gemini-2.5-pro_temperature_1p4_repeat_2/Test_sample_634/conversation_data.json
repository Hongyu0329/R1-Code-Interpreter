    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe question asks for the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two given polynomial matrices, P1 and P2. A polynomial matrix R is a GCRD of P1 and P2 if it is a common right divisor (i.e., P1 = Q1*R and P2 = Q2*R for some polynomial matrices Q1, Q2) and any other common right divisor R' is a right divisor of R. The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a non-zero constant determinant).\n\n**2. State the Given Matrices:**\n$P1 = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$P2 = \\begin{pmatrix} s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**3. Choose a Method:**\nThe standard method to find the GCRD is the Euclidean algorithm applied to polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by P1 and P2 to reduce it to a row-echelon form. The non-zero part of this final matrix is the GCRD.\n\n**4. Set up the Stacked Matrix:**\nForm the matrix M by stacking P1 on top of P2:\n$M = \\begin{pmatrix} P1 \\\\ P2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s & 0 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**5. Perform Elementary Row Operations:**\nThe allowed elementary row operations are:\n*   Interchanging two rows.\n*   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n*   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nLet's denote the rows as R1, R2, R3, R4.\n$R1 = [s^2 + s, -s]$\n$R2 = [-s^2 - 1, s^2]$\n$R3 = [s, 0]$\n$R4 = [-s - 1, 1]$\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Find a simple pivot.** The degrees of the leading polynomials in each row are 2, 2, 1, 1. It is best to work with the row with the lowest degree polynomial as the pivot. However, we can simplify the process even further. Notice that adding R3 and R4 creates a row with a constant leading entry.\n\n*   **Operation 1:** Replace R3 with R3 + R4.\n    $R3_{new} = [s, 0] + [-s - 1, 1] = [-1, 1]$\n    The matrix becomes:\n    $M_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Use the constant pivot.** A row with a constant entry is an excellent pivot. Let's move this row to the top.\n\n*   **Operation 2:** Swap R1 and R3.\n    $M_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 1 \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Operation 3:** Normalize the pivot row. Multiply R1 by -1.\n    $M_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ -s^2 - 1 & s^2 \\\\ s^2 + s & -s \\\\ -s - 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Eliminate other entries in the first column.** Now use the new R1 = `[1, -1]` to make all other elements in the first column zero.\n    *   `R2_new = R2 + (s^2 + 1) * R1`\n        $[-s^2 - 1, s^2] + (s^2 + 1)[1, -1] = [(-s^2 - 1) + (s^2 + 1), s^2 - (s^2 + 1)] = [0, -1]$\n    *   `R3_new = R3 - (s^2 + s) * R1`\n        $[s^2 + s, -s] - (s^2 + s)[1, -1] = [(s^2 + s) - (s^2 + s), -s + (s^2 + s)] = [0, s^2]$\n    *   `R4_new = R4 + (s + 1) * R1`\n        $[-s - 1, 1] + (s + 1)[1, -1] = [(-s - 1) + (s + 1), 1 - (s + 1)] = [0, -s]$\n\n    The matrix is now:\n    $M_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\ 0 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & -s \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Careful Point 4: Move to the next column.** The first column is reduced. Now we reduce the second column using the new non-zero rows. We have `[0, -1]`, `[0, s^2]`, `[0, -s]`. The row `[0, -1]` is the pivot row (lowest degree).\n\n*   **Operation 4:** Normalize the second pivot row. Multiply R2 by -1.\n    $M_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2 \\\\ 0 & -s \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **Operation 5:** Eliminate other entries in the second column.\n    *   `R1_new = R1 + 1 * R2`\n        $[1, -1] + [0, 1] = [1, 0]$\n    *   `R3_new = R3 - s^2 * R2`\n        $[0, s^2] - s^2[0, 1] = [0, 0]$\n    *   `R4_new = R4 + s * R2`\n        $[0, -s] + s[0, 1] = [0, 0]$\n\n    The final matrix is:\n    $M_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**6. Extract the Final Answer:**\nThe GCRD is the non-zero part of the final row-echelon matrix.\n$R = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThis is the identity matrix, I. When the GCRD is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the original matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n**7. Verification (Optional):**\nA property of the GCRD is that its determinant must divide the greatest common divisor of the determinants of the original matrices.\n*   `det(P1) = (s^2 + s)(s^2) - (-s)(-s^2 - 1) = s^4 + s^3 - s^3 - s = s^4 - s`\n*   `det(P2) = s(1) - 0(-s - 1) = s`\n*   `gcd(det(P1), det(P2)) = gcd(s^4 - s, s) = gcd(s(s^3 - 1), s) = s`\n*   `det(R) = det(I) = 1`\n\nSince `det(R) = 1` divides `s`, our result is consistent with this property. Our more detailed row-reduction confirms that no common right divisor with a determinant of `s` exists.\n\nThe final answer is the identity matrix of size 2x2.\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
