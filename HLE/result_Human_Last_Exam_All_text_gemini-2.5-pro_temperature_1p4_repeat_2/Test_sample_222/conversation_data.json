    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Analysis of the Question\nThe problem asks for the 8-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence, let's call it y(n), which is constructed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, x(n) and h(n). We are not given x(n) and h(n) directly, but we are given their respective 4-point DFTs, X(k) and H(k).\n\n*   **Given:**\n    *   `X(k)` = 4-point DFT of `x(n)` = `[1, j, -1, -j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `H(k)` = 4-point DFT of `h(n)` = `[0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n*   **To find:**\n    *   `Y(k)` = 8-point DFT of the sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n1.  **Structure of the new sequence `y(n)`:** The sequence `y(n)` is an 8-point sequence. Its even-indexed samples are the samples of `x(n)`, and its odd-indexed samples are the samples of `h(n)`.\n    *   Even part: `y_e(n) = y(2n) = x(n)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   Odd part: `y_o(n) = y(2n+1) = h(n)` for n = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n2.  **Relating DFTs of different lengths:** This structure is the basis of the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This algorithm provides a formula to compute a larger DFT from smaller DFTs.\n3.  **The DIT-FFT Formula:** The N-point DFT `Y(k)` can be computed from the N/2-point DFTs of its even part (`Y_e(k)`) and odd part (`Y_o(k)`) as follows:\n    *   `Y(k) = Y_e(k) + W_N^k * Y_o(k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., N/2 - 1`\n    *   `Y(k + N/2) = Y_e(k) - W_N^k * Y_o(k)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., N/2 - 1`\n4.  **Applying the formula to our problem:**\n    *   N = 8.\n    *   `Y_e(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `y_e(n) = x(n)`, which is `X(k)`.\n    *   `Y_o(k)` is the 4-point DFT of `y_o(n) = h(n)`, which is `H(k)`.\n    *   So, the formulas become:\n        *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n        *   `Y(k + 4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n5.  **Twiddle Factors:** We need to calculate the twiddle factors `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3.\n    *   `W_8^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1/√2) - j(1/√2) = (1-j)/√2`\n    *   `W_8^2 = cos(pi/2) - j*sin(pi/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = cos(3pi/4) - j*sin(3pi/4) = (-1/√2) - j(1/√2) = -(1+j)/√2`\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: Set up the calculation for each k from 0 to 3.**\nWe will use the formulas derived above and the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` values.\n\n**Step 2: Calculation for k = 0**\n*   `X(0) = 1`\n*   `H(0) = 0`\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n*   `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n\n**Step 3: Calculation for k = 1**\n*   `X(1) = j`\n*   `H(1) = 1 + j`\n*   `W_8^1 = (1-j)/√2`\n*   First, calculate the product `W_8^1 * H(1)`:\n    `((1-j)/√2) * (1+j) = (1 - j^2) / √2 = (1 - (-1)) / √2 = 2 / √2 = √2`\n*   `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + √2`\n*   `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - √2`\n\n**Step 4: Calculation for k = 2**\n*   `X(2) = -1`\n*   `H(2) = 1`\n*   `W_8^2 = -j`\n*   First, calculate the product `W_8^2 * H(2)`:\n    `(-j) * (1) = -j`\n*   `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n\n**Step 5: Calculation for k = 3**\n*   `X(3) = -j`\n*   `H(3) = 1 - j`\n*   `W_8^3 = -(1+j)/√2`\n*   First, calculate the product `W_8^3 * H(3)`:\n    `(-(1+j)/√2) * (1-j) = -(1 - j^2) / √2 = -(1 - (-1)) / √2 = -2 / √2 = -√2`\n*   `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + (-√2) = -√2 - j`\n*   `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - (-√2) = √2 - j`\n\n**Step 6: Assemble the final 8-point DFT Y(k)**\nCombining all the calculated values for `Y(0)` through `Y(7)`:\n`Y(k) = {Y(0), Y(1), Y(2), Y(3), Y(4), Y(5), Y(6), Y(7)}`\n`Y(k) = [1, √2 + j, -1 - j, -√2 - j, 1, -√2 + j, -1 + j, √2 - j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
