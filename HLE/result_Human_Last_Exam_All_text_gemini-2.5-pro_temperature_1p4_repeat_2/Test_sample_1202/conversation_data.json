    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question asks for the most likely mechanism that allows duplicate genes to be (1) *retained* in the genome (i.e., not lost or turned into non-functional pseudogenes) and (2) *diverge* (i.e., become different from the original copy in sequence and/or function).\n\n2.  **Analyze Answer Choice A (Gene conversion):** Gene conversion is a process of non-reciprocal genetic exchange where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence. When this occurs between two duplicate genes, it tends to make them more similar, not more different. This process, called concerted evolution, works *against* divergence. Therefore, it is not a mechanism for divergence.\n\n3.  **Analyze Answer Choice B (Pseudogenization):** This is the process by which a duplicate gene accumulates disabling mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes non-functional. While this is a form of divergence (functional vs. non-functional), it is a mechanism of *loss*, not *retention* of a functional gene copy. The question implies the retention of two functional, or at least potentially functional, genes. Pseudogenization is a very common fate, but it's not the mechanism that *preserves* both copies as active genes.\n\n4.  **Analyze Answer Choice C (Neofunctionalization):** In this model, after a gene duplication event, one copy maintains the original function, while the second copy is free from purifying selection. This freedom allows it to accumulate mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may confer a completely new, beneficial function.\n    *   **Retention:** The original copy is retained by selection for its essential function. The new copy is retained once it acquires a new beneficial function and comes under positive selection.\n    *   **Divergence:** The accumulation of mutations leading to a new function is the cause of divergence.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This model is valid but has a potential weakness. The duplicated copy is initially redundant and evolutionarily neutral. It can be easily lost by pseudogenization before a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation occurs.\n\n5.  **Analyze Answer Choice D (Subfunctionalization):** Also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model. This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or complex expression patterns (e.g., active in different tissues or at different developmental stages). After duplication, degenerative mutations can occur in different subfunctions of each copy. For instance, copy 1 might lose function A but retain function B, while copy 2 loses function B but retains function A.\n    *   **Retention:** Now, both copies are essential to carry out the full set of the original ancestral gene's functions. The loss of either copy would be deleterious, so selection retains both.\n    *   **Divergence:** The complementary loss of subfunctions causes the coding sequences and regulatory regions of the two genes to diverge.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This mechanism is considered highly likely because it relies on the accumulation of common, random, degenerative (loss-of-function) mutations, rather than waiting for a rare gain-of-function mutation as in neofunctionalization. This provides a clear and common pathway to protect both duplicates from being lost immediately after duplication.\n\n6.  **Analyze Answer Choice E (Adaptive radiation):** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of species from a single ancestor to fill various ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that *facilitates* adaptive radiation, but it is not the *mechanism* by which individual duplicate genes are retained and diverge within a single genome. This is a confusion of biological scales (gene level vs. species level).\n\n7.  **Compare the Viable Options (C vs. D):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for duplicate gene retention. However, the path to subfunctionalization is often considered more probable. It provides a period where both copies are preserved by selection due to the partitioning of ancestral functions. This preservation allows more evolutionary time for further divergence, which could even lead to one copy eventually gaining a new function (a combination of sub- and neofunctionalization). Because it relies on more common mutational events (loss-of-function) to ensure retention, subfunctionalization is often considered the \"most likely\" initial mechanism for preserving duplicate genes.\n\n**Conclusion:** Subfunctionalization provides a robust and common mechanism for both retaining duplicate genes (by making both necessary) and promoting their divergence through complementary degeneration. It is considered more likely to occur initially than neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
