    "This is a classic question in the field of point-set topology, specifically continuum theory. To determine the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua, we must understand the definitions and apply some major classification theorems.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. When we say \"planar,\" we mean a continuum that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane, R². In the plane, this corresponds to a closed, bounded, and connected set.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism f: X → X (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that f(x) = y. This means the space looks topologically the same from every point.\n*   **Planar:** The continuum can be embedded in the plane R².\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** A set of topological spaces that are all homeomorphic to each other. We are asked to count how many distinct \"types\" of spaces satisfy these properties, where \"type\" means they are not homeomorphic to each other.\n\n### Step 2: The Classification Strategy\n\nThe classification of these objects relies on a series of powerful theorems developed over several decades. A logical way to proceed is to divide the continua based on key topological properties that are preserved by homeomorphism.\n\n1.  Is the continuum degenerate (a single point) or non-degenerate?\n2.  If non-degenerate, does it separate the plane?\n3.  If non-degenerate and non-separating, does it contain a simple closed curve?\n\nLet's analyze each case.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the Cases\n\n**Case 1: Degenerate Continua**\nA continuum is degenerate if it consists of a single point.\n*   **Is a point a homogeneous planar continuum?**\n    *   **Continuum:** Yes, a singleton set is non-empty, compact, and connected.\n    *   **Planar:** Yes, it's a subset of R².\n    *   **Homogeneous:** Yes, trivially. For the only point x, the identity map sends x to x.\n*   All single-point spaces are homeomorphic. Therefore, the single point forms our first homeomorphism class.\n\n**Class 1: The Point**\n\n---\n\n**Case 2: Non-Degenerate, Plane-Separating Continua**\nA subset K of R² is plane-separating if its complement, R² \\ K, is disconnected.\n*   A major result, **Jones's Theorem (1955)**, states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that separates the plane must be a **simple closed curve**.\n*   All simple closed curves are homeomorphic to the circle (S¹). The circle is a well-known homogeneous planar continuum (rotations can map any point to any other).\n*   This gives us our second distinct class.\n\n**Class 2: The Simple Closed Curve (the Circle)**\n\n---\n\n**Case 3: Non-Degenerate, Non-Separating Continua**\nNow we consider continua that are larger than a point but do not separate the plane. This class requires a further subdivision based on another topological property.\n\n**Subcase 3a: The continuum is \"tree-like\" (or \"arc-like\").**\nThis means it does not contain any simple closed curve.\n*   In a groundbreaking discovery, **R. H. Bing (1948)** constructed a bizarre, non-locally connected continuum called the **pseudo-arc**.\n*   Bing later proved two crucial theorems:\n    1.  The pseudo-arc is homogeneous.\n    2.  Any non-degenerate, tree-like, homogeneous continuum is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n*   The pseudo-arc can be embedded in the plane and does not separate it. This gives us a unique third class.\n\n**Class 3: The Pseudo-arc**\n\n---\n\n**Subcase 3b: The continuum is not tree-like.**\nThis means the non-degenerate, non-separating, homogeneous planar continuum *does* contain a simple closed curve.\n*   The only known candidate for this is a construction called the **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This can be visualized as a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs whose endpoints are \"glued\" together to form a circle-like structure.\n*   Work by **R. D. Anderson** and **J. T. Rogers, Jr.** in the latter half of the 20th century culminated in the theorem that any such continuum (non-degenerate, non-separating, not tree-like, homogeneous, planar) must be homeomorphic to this circle of pseudo-arcs.\n*   It was also shown that all such constructions result in a single, unique homeomorphism class.\n\n**Class 4: The Circle of Pseudo-arcs**\n\n### Step 4: Final Summary and Verification\n\nOur step-by-step analysis, based on major theorems of topology, has yielded exactly four distinct classes.\n\n1.  **The Point:** Degenerate.\n2.  **The Circle:** Non-degenerate, separates the plane, locally connected.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** Non-degenerate, does not separate the plane, is tree-like (contains no circle), not locally connected.\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** Non-degenerate, does not separate the plane, is not tree-like (contains circles), not locally connected.\n\nThese four classes are topologically distinct from one another, as demonstrated by the different properties listed above (e.g., separating vs. non-separating, containing a circle vs. not containing one). The classification is complete; there are no other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly 4 homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\n<<<4>>>"
