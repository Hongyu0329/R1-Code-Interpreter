The final product, C, is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. Its IUPAC name is 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. This molecule is achiral because it does not possess any chiral centers. No carbon atom in the structure is attached to four different substituent groups, which is the requirement for a carbon-based stereocenter. Therefore, the molecule is not optically active.
