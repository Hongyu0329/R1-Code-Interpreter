    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Schema S:** The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$. A unary predicate $P_i$ represents a property that an element of the universe either has or does not have.\n*   **Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$:** This is a fragment of First-Order Logic (FO) using the predicates from $S$. The allowed logical constructs are:\n    *   `∃`: The existential quantifier.\n    *   `∧`: Conjunction (logical AND).\n    *   `⊤`: The constant for \"True\".\n    *   `⊥`: The constant for \"False\".\n    We are interested in formulas with one free variable, say `x`, which act as classifiers on the elements of a database.\n*   **VC Dimension:** The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension is a measure of the complexity or expressive power of a set of classifiers (a concept class). It is defined as the size of the largest set of points that the concept class can *shatter*.\n\n### Step 2: Characterizing the Classifiers\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ in this logic fragment is a classifier. Let's analyze its structure.\nAny formula in this fragment with one free variable `x` can be written in the form:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k (\\psi_1 \\land \\psi_2 \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_m)$\nwhere each $\\psi_j$ is an atomic formula of the form $P_l(z)$, with $z \\in \\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_k\\}$.\n\nWe can separate the atomic formulas based on whether they contain the free variable `x`:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists \\vec{y} \\left( \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_x} P_{i_j}(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\bigwedge_{l \\in J_y} P_{i_l}(z_l) \\right) \\right)$\nwhere $z_l \\in \\{y_1, ..., y_k\\}$.\nUsing the rule that $\\exists y (A \\land B(y)) \\equiv A \\land \\exists y B(y)$ when $y$ is not free in $A$, we can rewrite the formula as:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{j \\in J_x} P_{i_j}(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists \\vec{y} \\bigwedge_{l \\in J_y} P_{i_l}(z_l) \\right)$\n\nThis has the form $A(x) \\land \\sigma$, where:\n*   $A(x)$ is a conjunction of positive literals involving `x`, like $P_1(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This type of formula is known as a **monotone conjunction**. The set of possible such conjunctions is determined by choosing a subset of the 4 predicates.\n*   $\\sigma$ is a **sentence** (a formula with no free variables). For any given database instance, $\\sigma$ is either true or false.\n\nThis means that for any specific database, our classifier $\\phi(x)$ behaves either as the monotone conjunction $A(x)$ (if sentence $\\sigma$ is true for that database) or as the `⊥` formula (if $\\sigma$ is false), which classifies every element as false.\n\nThe set of all possible classifiers defined by our logic fragment, across all possible databases, is therefore equivalent to the set of classifiers defined by **monotone conjunctions** on 4 attributes, plus the classifier that always returns false (the empty set). This is our **concept class**.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the VC Dimension\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the concept class of monotone conjunctions over $n=4$ boolean attributes. Let's call this value $d$. The VC dimension is $d$ if we can find a set of $d$ points that can be shattered, and no set of size $d+1$ can be shattered.\n\n#### Lower Bound (VCdim ≥ 4)\n\nWe need to show that there exists a set of 4 points that can be shattered. To shatter a set of points, we must be able to generate any possible labeling of these points using concepts from our class.\n\nLet the 4 predicates correspond to 4 boolean attributes. Let's define a set of 4 points, $X = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\\}$, by their attribute vectors (types). We choose vectors that have exactly one `0` and three `1`s:\n*   $c_1 \\leftrightarrow (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n*   $c_2 \\leftrightarrow (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n*   $c_3 \\leftrightarrow (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n*   $c_4 \\leftrightarrow (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n\nWe must show that any subset of $X$ can be selected by a monotone conjunction. A monotone conjunction $\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$ selects a point if the point's attribute vector is `1` for all indices in $J$.\n\nLet's pick an arbitrary subset of $X$ to select, say $Y = \\{c_1, c_3\\}$. We need to find a conjunction that is true for $c_1$ and $c_3$ but false for $c_2$ and $c_4$.\n*   For the conjunction to be true on $c_1=(0,1,1,1)$, its predicates can only be from $\\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$.\n*   For the conjunction to be true on $c_3=(1,1,0,1)$, its predicates can only be from $\\{P_1, P_2, P_4\\}$.\n*   So, the predicates must be from $\\{P_2, P_3, P_4\\} \\cap \\{P_1, P_2, P_4\\} = \\{P_2, P_4\\}$. Let's try the conjunction $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$.\n    *   $c_1=(0,1,1,1)$: $1 \\land 1 = \\text{true}$.\n    *   $c_2=(1,0,1,1)$: $0 \\land 1 = \\text{false}$.\n    *   $c_3=(1,1,0,1)$: $1 \\land 1 = \\text{true}$.\n    *   $c_4=(1,1,1,0)$: $1 \\land 0 = \\text{false}$.\nThis works. In general, to select a subset $Y = \\{c_{i_1}, \\dots, c_{i_k}\\}$, we can use the conjunction $\\bigwedge_{j \\in J} P_j(x)$ where $J = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus \\{i_1, \\dots, i_k\\}$. This construction works for all $2^4=16$ subsets of $X$.\n\nSince we found a set of 4 points that can be shattered, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n#### Upper Bound (VCdim ≤ 4)\n\nWe need to show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. This is a standard result for this concept class.\nLet $X = \\{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points, represented by 5 vectors in $\\{0,1\\}^4$. A concept is a monotone conjunction defined by a subset of predicates $I \\subseteq \\{P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4\\}$. The point $c_k$ is classified as positive by the concept $C_I$ if and only if $c_k$ has the property $P_j$ for all $j \\in I$.\n\nConsider the rows of the matrix formed by the 5 vectors. Since the vectors are in a 4-dimensional space, the 5 vectors must be linearly dependent over the real numbers. That is, there exist real coefficients $a_1, \\dots, a_5$, not all zero, such that $\\sum_{k=1}^5 a_k c_k = \\vec{0}$.\n\nLet $P = \\{k \\mid a_k > 0\\}$ and $N = \\{k \\mid a_k < 0\\}$. We can write $\\sum_{k \\in P} a_k c_k = \\sum_{k \\in N} (-a_k) c_k$. Both $P$ and $N$ must be non-empty (otherwise all vectors would be the zero vector, which is a trivial case).\n\nConsider the labeling that classifies all points in $P$ as positive and all points in $N$ as negative. For this to be possible, there must exist a set of predicates $I$ such that:\n1.  For all $k \\in P$, $c_k$ is classified as positive (i.e., for all $j \\in I$, the $j$-th component of $c_k$ is 1).\n2.  For all $k \\in N$, $c_k$ is classified as negative (i.e., for each $k \\in N$, there exists a $j \\in I$ such that the $j$-th component of $c_k$ is 0).\n\nLet $I = \\{j \\mid \\text{for all } k \\in P, \\text{ the } j\\text{-th component of } c_k \\text{ is } 1 \\}$. This is the largest possible set of predicates that could satisfy condition 1.\nWith this choice of $I$, look at the $j$-th component of the linear dependency equation, for any $j \\in I$. Since $(c_k)_j = 1$ for all $k \\in P$, the left side becomes $\\sum_{k \\in P} a_k$. The right side is $\\sum_{k \\in N} (-a_k) (c_k)_j$. Since $(c_k)_j \\in \\{0,1\\}$, the right side is at most $\\sum_{k \\in N} (-a_k)$.\nIf it were possible to separate $P$ and $N$, it would imply a contradiction in this linear dependency.\nA more direct proof shows that for any $n+1$ points in $\\{0,1\\}^n$, there is a labeling that cannot be realized by a monotone conjunction.\nTherefore, no set of 5 points can be shattered by monotone conjunctions over 4 variables. The VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe VC dimension is both at least 4 and at most 4. Therefore, it is exactly 4."
