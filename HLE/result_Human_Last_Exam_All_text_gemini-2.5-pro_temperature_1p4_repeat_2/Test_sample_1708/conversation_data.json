    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order type of the set of finite strings of characters $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$ ordered lexically.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Set and the Ordering**\n*   **The Set ($S$):** The set consists of all finite strings that can be formed using the characters from the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$. This set includes the empty string, denoted by $\\epsilon$. Let's denote the set of all such strings as $\\Sigma^*$.\n*   **The Ordering:** The strings are ordered \"lexically\" (lexicographically). This is the standard dictionary order. For two strings $s_1$ and $s_2$:\n    1.  If $s_1$ is a proper prefix of $s_2$ (e.g., \"cat\" is a prefix of \"caterpillar\"), then $s_1 < s_2$.\n    2.  Otherwise, find the first position from the left where the strings differ. The order is determined by comparing the characters at that position (e.g., \"apple\" < \"apply\" because at the 5th position, 'e' < 'y').\n\n    Let's check this order:\n    *   \"a\" < \"b\" (Rule 2)\n    *   \"a\" < \"aa\" (Rule 1)\n    *   \"ad\" < \"b\" (Rule 2, because 'a' < 'b' at the first position)\n    *   \"add\" < \"b\" (Rule 2, same reason)\n    *   \"az\" is not in the set, but if it were, \"b\" < \"az\" would be false. The first characters 'b' and 'a' determine the order.\n\n*   **Well-Ordering:** This lexicographical ordering on the set of all finite strings is a well-ordering. This means every non-empty subset has a least element. Therefore, its order type is an ordinal number. Since the set of finite strings is countable, the order type will be a countable ordinal.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Set Based on its Structure**\nThe set of all strings $\\Sigma^*$ can be partitioned based on the first character.\n*   The empty string $\\epsilon$ is the smallest element.\n*   Next are all strings that start with 'a'. Let's call this set $S_a = a\\Sigma^*$.\n*   Next are all strings that start with 'b'. Let's call this set $S_b = b\\Sigma^*$.\n*   Next are all strings that start with 'c', set $S_c = c\\Sigma^*$.\n*   Finally, all strings that start with 'd', set $S_d = d\\Sigma^*$.\n\nAny string starting with 'a' is lexicographically smaller than any string starting with 'b', and so on. Thus, the ordered set $\\Sigma^*$ is the ordered sum of these disjoint subsets:\n$\\Sigma^* = \\{\\epsilon\\} \\cup S_a \\cup S_b \\cup S_c \\cup S_d$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate an Equation for the Order Type**\nLet $\\alpha$ be the order type of the ordered set $(\\Sigma^*, <_{lex})$.\n*   The order type of the set containing only the empty string, $\\{\\epsilon\\}$, is 1.\n*   The order type of the entire set is the sum of the order types of its ordered partitions:\n    $\\alpha = \\text{OrderType}(\\{\\epsilon\\}) + \\text{OrderType}(S_a) + \\text{OrderType}(S_b) + \\text{OrderType}(S_c) + \\text{OrderType}(S_d)$\n    $\\alpha = 1 + \\text{OrderType}(S_a) + \\text{OrderType}(S_b) + \\text{OrderType}(S_c) + \\text{OrderType}(S_d)$\n\nNow we need to find the order type of each subset $S_x$.\nConsider the subset $S_a = a\\Sigma^* = \\{as \\mid s \\in \\Sigma^*\\}$. There is a natural map $\\phi_a: \\Sigma^* \\to S_a$ given by $\\phi_a(s) = as$. This map is a bijection. Let's check if it preserves the order.\nLet $s_1 < s_2$ in $\\Sigma^*$.\n*   If $s_1$ is a prefix of $s_2$, then $as_1$ is a prefix of $as_2$, so $as_1 < as_2$.\n*   If $s_1$ and $s_2$ first differ at some position, $as_1$ and $as_2$ will have the same common prefix as $s_1$ and $s_2$, but preceded by 'a', and will differ at the same subsequent position with the same characters.\nThus, $s_1 < s_2 \\iff as_1 < as_2$. The map $\\phi_a$ is an order isomorphism.\nThis means that the set of strings starting with 'a' has the same order type as the original set of all strings.\n$\\text{OrderType}(S_a) = \\text{OrderType}(\\Sigma^*) = \\alpha$.\nSimilarly, $\\text{OrderType}(S_b) = \\alpha$, $\\text{OrderType}(S_c) = \\alpha$, and $\\text{OrderType}(S_d) = \\alpha$.\n\nSubstituting these into our equation for $\\alpha$:\n$\\alpha = 1 + \\alpha + \\alpha + \\alpha + \\alpha$\nUsing the definition of ordinal multiplication by a natural number ($n \\cdot \\beta = \\beta + ... + \\beta$ ($n$ times) but $\\beta \\cdot n = \\beta + ... + \\beta$), the equation is:\n$\\alpha = 1 + \\alpha \\cdot 4$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the Ordinal Equation**\nWe are looking for the smallest ordinal $\\alpha$ that satisfies the equation $\\alpha = 1 + \\alpha \\cdot 4$. We can find it by transfinite recursion:\n*   $\\alpha_0 = 0$\n*   $\\alpha_1 = 1 + \\alpha_0 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 0 = 1$\n*   $\\alpha_2 = 1 + \\alpha_1 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 1 \\cdot 4 = 5$\n*   $\\alpha_3 = 1 + \\alpha_2 \\cdot 4 = 1 + 5 \\cdot 4 = 21$\n*   $\\alpha_n = 1+4+4^2+\\dots+4^{n-1} = \\frac{4^n-1}{3}$ for finite $n$.\n\nThe limit of this sequence of finite ordinals is the first infinite ordinal, $\\omega$:\n*   $\\alpha_\\omega = \\sup_{n<\\omega} \\alpha_n = \\omega$\n\nNow we continue the recursion into the transfinite:\n*   $\\alpha_{\\omega+1} = 1 + \\alpha_\\omega \\cdot 4 = 1 + \\omega \\cdot 4$\n*   $\\alpha_{\\omega+2} = 1 + \\alpha_{\\omega+1} \\cdot 4 = 1 + (1 + \\omega \\cdot 4) \\cdot 4 = 1 + 4 + \\omega \\cdot 16 = 5 + \\omega \\cdot 16$\n*   Continuing this for any finite $n$, $\\alpha_{\\omega+n} = \\frac{4^n-1}{3} + \\omega \\cdot 4^n$.\nTaking the supremum over all finite $n$:\n*   $\\alpha_{\\omega \\cdot 2} = \\sup_{n<\\omega} \\alpha_{\\omega+n} = \\sup_{n<\\omega} (\\frac{4^n-1}{3} + \\omega \\cdot 4^n) = \\omega^2$. The $\\omega \\cdot 4^n$ term dominates and its supremum is $\\omega^2$.\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging:\n*   $\\alpha_{\\omega \\cdot 3} = \\omega^3$\n*   $\\alpha_{\\omega \\cdot m} = \\omega^m$\n\nThe next limit ordinal is $\\omega^2$.\n*   $\\alpha_{\\omega^2} = \\sup_{m<\\omega} \\alpha_{\\omega \\cdot m} = \\sup_{m<\\omega} \\omega^m = \\omega^\\omega$.\n\nLet's check if $\\alpha = \\omega^\\omega$ is a solution to our equation $\\alpha = 1 + \\alpha \\cdot 4$.\n*   First, $\\omega^\\omega$ is a limit ordinal, so for any finite ordinal $c$, $c + \\omega^\\omega = \\omega^\\omega$. Thus $1 + \\omega^\\omega = \\omega^\\omega$.\n*   Second, for any finite $k>1$, $\\omega^\\omega \\cdot k = \\omega^\\omega$. This is because $\\omega^\\omega = \\sup_n \\omega^n$, so $\\omega^\\omega \\cdot k = (\\sup_n \\omega^n) \\cdot k = \\sup_n (\\omega^n \\cdot k)$. The sequence $\\omega^n \\cdot k$ is cofinal with the sequence $\\omega^n$, so they have the same supremum.\n*   So, if $\\alpha = \\omega^\\omega$, the equation becomes $\\omega^\\omega = 1 + (\\omega^\\omega \\cdot 4) = 1 + \\omega^\\omega = \\omega^\\omega$.\nThis is true. The construction shows that $\\omega^\\omega$ is the least transfinite solution.\n\nTherefore, the order type of the set of finite strings over four characters ordered lexically is $\\omega^\\omega$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\omega^\\omega}$."
