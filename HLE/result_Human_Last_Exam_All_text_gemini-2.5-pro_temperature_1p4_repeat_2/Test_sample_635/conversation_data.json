    "To calculate a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ in the form $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, we follow these steps:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation for factorization**\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is equivalent to $D(s) H(s) = N(s)$, where $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ must be polynomial matrices. Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThen, $N(s)$ is given by the product:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine conditions for $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix**\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n1.  From the second column, $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$. This means $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n2.  From the first column, the entries must also be polynomials. Let's rewrite them with a common denominator $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$:\n    $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n    $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$\nFor $n_{11}(s)$ and $n_{21}(s)$ to be polynomials, their numerators must be divisible by the denominator $s^2-1$. This means the numerators must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Solve for the entries of D(s)**\nLet $P_1(s) = d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ and $P_2(s) = d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$.\nThe conditions are:\n- $P_1(1) = 0 \\implies d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{12}(s)$.\n- $P_1(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n- $P_2(1) = 0 \\implies d_{21}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$. So, $(s-1)$ must be a factor of $d_{22}(s)$.\n- $P_2(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{21}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\nWe need to find two linearly independent polynomial row vectors for $D(s)$ that satisfy these conditions. Let's find the simplest possible polynomials.\n\nFor the first row, $[d_{11}(s), d_{12}(s)]$:\nLet's try the simplest non-trivial choice for $d_{11}(s)$, a constant, say $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\nThe second condition becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{12}(-1) = -2$.\nFrom the first condition, $d_{12}(1)=0$.\nA simple polynomial satisfying $d_{12}(1)=0$ and $d_{12}(-1)=-2$ is a line of the form $d_{12}(s) = a(s-1)$. At $s=-1$, $d_{12}(-1) = a(-1-1) = -2a$. We need $-2a = -2$, so $a=1$.\nThus, a valid choice is $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\nThe first row of $D(s)$ is $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\nFor the second row, $[d_{21}(s), d_{22}(s)]$, we need a solution that is linearly independent of the first row.\nLet's try to simplify by setting $d_{21}(s) = 0$.\nThe fourth condition becomes $2(0) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\nThe third condition is $d_{22}(1)=0$.\nSo, $d_{22}(s)$ must have factors $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$. The simplest non-zero polynomial for $d_{22}(s)$ is $(s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$.\nThe second row of $D(s)$ is $[0 \\quad s^2-1]$.\n\nSo, we have our candidate for $D(s)$:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the corresponding N(s)**\nUsing the formulas from Step 2:\n$n_{11}(s) = \\frac{1 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s-1+2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = 1$.\n$n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n$n_{21}(s) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = 2$.\n$n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 0$.\n\nSo, our candidate for $N(s)$ is:\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Step 5: Verify coprimeness**\n$D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all complex numbers $s$.\n$[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\nThe rank drops below 2 only if all $2 \\times 2$ minors are zero.\nLet's compute some minors:\n- Minor from columns 1 and 3: $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} = 2$.\n- Minor from columns 3 and 4: $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = -2$.\nSince we have minors that are non-zero constants, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the minors is a constant. This means the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all $s$. Therefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\nFurthermore, $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$. The degree of $\\det(D(s))$ is 2. The McMillan degree of $H(s)$ is also 2. Since these are equal, the factorization is minimal, which implies it is coprime.\n\nThe left coprime factorization is given by:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$."
