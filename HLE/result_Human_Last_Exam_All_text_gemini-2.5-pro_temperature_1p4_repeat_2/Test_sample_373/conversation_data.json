    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph.\n\n### Step 1: Define and understand the Barbell Graph structure.\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single path. The question specifies a barbell graph with 10 nodes. The most standard and symmetrical way to construct a 10-node barbell graph is by connecting two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5) with a single edge.\n\n*   **Cliques:** We have two cliques, let's call them A and B. Each clique is a K5, meaning it's a complete graph with 5 nodes where every node is connected to every other node within that clique.\n*   **Nodes:** Clique A has 5 nodes, and Clique B has 5 nodes, for a total of 10 nodes.\n*   **Connecting Edge (Bottleneck):** A single edge connects one node from Clique A to one node from Clique B. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\" because it is the only path between the two dense clusters of nodes.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the total number of edges in the graph.\nTo find the probability of sampling a specific edge, we first need to know the total number of edges in the graph.\n\n*   **Edges within a clique:** The number of edges in a complete graph with *n* nodes is given by the formula: `E = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n*   **Edges in Clique A (K5):** `5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10` edges.\n*   **Edges in Clique B (K5):** `5 * (5 - 1) / 2 = 5 * 4 / 2 = 10` edges.\n*   **Bottleneck Edge:** There is exactly 1 edge connecting the two cliques.\n*   **Total Edges:** The total number of edges in the entire barbell graph is the sum of the edges in both cliques plus the bottleneck edge.\n    `Total Edges = 10 (from Clique A) + 10 (from Clique B) + 1 (bottleneck) = 21` edges.\n\n### Step 3: Understand the sampling process.\nThe problem states \"randomized uniform gossiping\" on a graph with \"uniform weights\".\n\n*   **Uniform Gossiping:** This implies that at each step of the gossiping process, an edge is selected from the set of all edges in the graph.\n*   **Randomized & Uniform:** This means that every edge in the graph has an equal probability of being selected. The process is a uniform random sampling from the set of all edges.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the probability.\nThe probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n*   **Favorable Outcomes:** We want to sample the \"bottleneck edge\". As established in Step 1, there is exactly one such edge. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1.\n*   **Total Possible Outcomes:** The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of edges in the graph, which we calculated in Step 2 to be 21.\n*   **Probability Calculation:**\n    `Probability = (Number of Bottleneck Edges) / (Total Number of Edges)`\n    `Probability = 1 / 21`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points:\n1.  **Graph Interpretation:** It's crucial to correctly interpret \"barbell graph with 10 nodes\" as two K5 cliques connected by one edge. This is the most standard configuration, and the term \"bottleneck edge\" (singular) strongly supports the idea of a single connecting edge rather than a longer path.\n2.  **Edge Calculation:** Accurately calculating the number of edges in the complete graphs (K5) is essential for finding the total number of edges.\n3.  **Sampling Model:** Understanding that \"randomized uniform gossiping\" in this context refers to picking an edge uniformly at random from the entire set of edges.\n\nThe final calculation is straightforward once the graph structure and sampling process are clearly defined.\n\nThe probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/21.\n\n<<<1/21>>>"
