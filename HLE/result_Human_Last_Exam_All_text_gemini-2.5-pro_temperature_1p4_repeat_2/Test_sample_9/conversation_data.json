    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the space X\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n1.  **Lattices and Bases:** A lattice $\\Lambda$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented by a basis of two linearly independent vectors $(v_1, v_2)$. These vectors can be written as the columns of a matrix $A = (v_1, v_2) \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. The lattice is then $\\Lambda = A\\mathbb{Z}^2$. The term \"nondegenerate\" simply means the lattice is of rank 2, which is ensured by $A \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Unit Area Condition:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means we restrict our space of bases to matrices $A$ such that $|\\det(A)| = 1$. Let's call this set $G^1 = \\{A \\in M_2(\\mathbb{R}) : \\det(A) = \\pm 1\\}$. This set has two connected components: $SL_2(\\mathbb{R}) = \\{A : \\det(A)=1\\}$ and $\\{A : \\det(A)=-1\\}$.\n\n3.  **Moduli Space (Isomorphism Classes):** Two bases, represented by matrices $A$ and $B$, generate the same lattice if and only if they are related by an integer change of basis. This means $B = AM$ for some matrix $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, the group of $2 \\times 2$ integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n\n4.  **Definition of X:** Combining these points, the moduli space $X$ is the set of equivalence classes of bases in $G^1$ under the action of $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. That is, $X$ is the quotient space:\n    $X = G^1 / GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Find a more familiar representation of X\n\nWe can show that $X$ is homeomorphic to the space $Y = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. $Y$ is the moduli space of *oriented* lattices of unit area.\n\n1.  **Construct a map:** Let's define a map $f: Y \\to X$ by taking the equivalence class of an oriented basis and considering it as an unoriented one. Formally, for a matrix $A \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, its equivalence class in $Y$ is $[A]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = \\{AM : M \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})\\}$. Its equivalence class in $X$ is $[A]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = \\{AM : M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})\\}$. The map is $f([A]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}) = [A]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$. This map is well-defined because if $[A]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$, then $B=AM$ for some $M \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Since $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\subset GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, this implies $B$ and $A$ are also equivalent under the $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ action, so $[A]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$.\n\n2.  **Show the map is surjective:** Let $[g]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$ be any element in $X$, where $g \\in G^1$.\n    *   If $\\det(g) = 1$, then $g \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, so $[g]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = f([g]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})})$.\n    *   If $\\det(g) = -1$, let's pick a matrix $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $J \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Let $g' = gJ$. Then $\\det(g') = \\det(g)\\det(J) = (-1)(-1) = 1$, so $g' \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. The orbit of $g$ in $X$ is the same as the orbit of $g'$, since they are related by a $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ matrix: $[g]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = [gJ]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = [g']_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$. Thus, any element in $X$ has a representative in $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, which means $f([g']_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}) = [g]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$. The map $f$ is surjective.\n\n3.  **Show the map is injective:** Suppose $f([A]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}) = f([B]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})})$ for $A, B \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. This means $[A]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$. By definition, this implies there exists a matrix $M \\in GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ such that $B = AM$. Since $A, B \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$, we can take determinants on both sides: $\\det(B) = \\det(A)\\det(M)$, which gives $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(M)$. So, $\\det(M)=1$, which means $M \\in SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. But this is exactly the condition for $[A]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})} = [B]_{SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})}$. Thus, the map $f$ is injective.\n\nSince $f$ is a continuous bijection from a manifold to a Hausdorff space (quotient of a manifold by a Lie group action), it is a homeomorphism. We have established that $X \\cong SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$\n\nLet $Y=SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$, $G=SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma=SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. We use the Serre spectral sequence associated with the fibration $Y \\to B\\Gamma \\to BG$, where $B\\Gamma$ and $BG$ are the classifying spaces of the respective groups.\n\n1.  **Low-degree exact sequence:** The Serre spectral sequence gives a five-term exact sequence in low-degree homology:\n    $H_2(BG) \\to H_1(Y) \\to H_1(B\\Gamma) \\to H_1(BG) \\to H_0(Y)$.\n\n2.  **Homology of the groups:** We use the fact that for a group $H$, $H_k(BH) \\cong H_k(H, \\mathbb{Z})$, the $k$-th group homology with integer coefficients. For $k=1$, $H_1(H, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the abelianization of $H$, $H/[H,H]$.\n    *   **For G = SL₂(ℝ):** The group $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to its maximal compact subgroup $SO(2)$, which is the circle $S^1$. Therefore, $H_k(SL_2(\\mathbb{R})) \\cong H_k(S^1)$. This gives $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R}), \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_2(SL_2(\\mathbb{R}), \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n    *   **For Γ = SL₂(ℤ):** The group $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $S=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The abelianization $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})^{ab}$ can be calculated from the presentation of the group. The result is well-known: $H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$.\n    *   **For Y:** The space $Y = SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is connected, so $H_0(Y, \\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n3.  **Applying the sequence:** Substituting these known homology groups into the five-term exact sequence:\n    $0 \\to H_1(Y) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\xrightarrow{\\alpha} \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the map α:** The map $\\alpha: H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})) \\to H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{R}))$ is induced by the inclusion map $i: SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\hookrightarrow SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$. This is a homomorphism from a finite group $\\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ to an infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$. The only such homomorphism is the zero map, because any element of finite order must be mapped to an element of finite order, and the only such element in $\\mathbb{Z}$ is 0. So, $\\alpha$ is the zero map.\n\n5.  **Finalizing the computation:** The exact sequence simplifies to:\n    $0 \\to H_1(Y) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to \\ker(\\beta)$, where $\\beta: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    The map $\\beta$ is also known to be an isomorphism (it's the edge map $H_1(BG) \\to H_0(Y)$), which can be seen from the spectral sequence to be zero. Thus $\\ker(\\beta) = 0$.\n    Alternatively, the map following $\\alpha$ must be injective for the sequence to be exact at $\\mathbb{Z}$. The final map $H_1(BG) \\to H_0(Y)$ must be zero. So we have exactness of $0 \\to H_1(Y) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12} \\to 0$.\n    This implies that the map $H_1(Y) \\to \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$ is an isomorphism.\n\nTherefore, $H_1(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$. Since $X \\cong Y$, we have our final answer.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The moduli space of non-degenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area is $X = \\{A \\in M_2(\\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A)=\\pm 1\\}/GL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  This space is homeomorphic to the moduli space of oriented lattices with unit area, $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$.\n3.  The first homology group of $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$ is computed using the Serre spectral sequence for the fibration $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})/SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to BSL_2(\\mathbb{Z}) \\to BSL_2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n4.  This yields $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_{12}$."
