    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Define the \"Triple Crown\"\n\nThe question asks for the total number of unique players who have won the MLB batting Triple Crown.\n\nThe batting Triple Crown is one of baseball's most prestigious and difficult achievements. To win it, a player must lead their respective league (American League or National League) in all three of the following offensive categories in the same season:\n1.  **Batting Average (AVG)**\n2.  **Home Runs (HR)**\n3.  **Runs Batted In (RBI)**\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n\nTo answer this question accurately, several points must be considered:\n\n*   **Unique Winners vs. Total Occurrences:** The question asks for the number of *winners* (i.e., the number of individual players), not the total number of times the Triple Crown has been won. We must identify if any player has won it more than once and only count them a single time.\n*   **Both Leagues Included:** MLB consists of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL). We need to include winners from both leagues.\n*   **Historical Leagues:** Some Triple Crowns were won in leagues that were considered \"major leagues\" at the time but are not the AL or NL we know today, such as the American Association in the 19th century. These are generally included in the historical count.\n*   **Ties for a Category Lead:** A player who ties for the league lead in one or more of the three categories is still considered a Triple Crown winner. This was the case for Nap Lajoie in 1901, who tied for the home run lead.\n\n### Step 3: Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nWe will list all the players who have won the Triple Crown, noting their league, year, and whether they are a repeat winner.\n\n**National League (NL) Winners:**\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n3.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925) - **Note:** Hornsby won the award twice.\n4.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n5.  **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n**American Association (AA) Winner:**\n*(The AA was officially a major league from 1882-1891, so its winner is included in the all-time list.)*\n\n6.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n\n**American League (AL) Winners:**\n\n7.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n8.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n9.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n11. **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947) - **Note:** Williams also won the award twice.\n12. **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n13. **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n14. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n15. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n**Final Count:**\nNow, we count the number of unique individuals from the list above. Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won twice, but as individual players, they are only counted once for our total.\n\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Heinie Zimmerman\n4.  Rogers Hornsby\n5.  Chuck Klein\n6.  Joe Medwick\n7.  Nap Lajoie\n8.  Ty Cobb\n9.  Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Ted Williams\n12. Mickey Mantle\n13. Frank Robinson\n14. Carl Yastrzemski\n15. Miguel Cabrera\n\nCounting these unique players gives us a total of 15.\n\n<<<15>>>"
