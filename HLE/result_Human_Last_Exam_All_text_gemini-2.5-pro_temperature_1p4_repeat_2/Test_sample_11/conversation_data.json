    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Subject:** A statute (law enacted by the Knesset).\n    *   **Jurisdiction:** The modern State of Israel (i.e., from 1948 onwards).\n    *   **Core Concept:** The *explicit* introduction of \"good faith\" (in Hebrew: תום לב, *tom lev*). This means the actual words must appear in the text of the law.\n    *   **Chronology:** It must be the *first* such statute.\n    *   **Exclusions:** The final answer should not include \"the\" or the year of the statute.\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   The most famous and influential statute regarding \"good faith\" is the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. Its sections 12 and 39 established a broad, overarching duty of good faith in negotiations and in the performance of contractual obligations.\n    *   However, the question asks for the *first* statute, not the most significant one. Therefore, the Contracts Law of 1973 is a common but incorrect answer. We must search for earlier laws.\n\n3.  **Exploring Pre-1973 Legislation:**\n    *   Before the Contracts Law, several other laws were enacted that included the term \"good faith\".\n    *   The **Sale Law, 1968**, contains the principle in its \"market overt\" rule (תקנת השוק, *takanat hashuk*). Section 34 protects a purchaser of movable property who bought the asset from a seller in the ordinary course of their business, provided the purchaser acted *in good faith* (*be'tom lev*). This clearly predates the 1973 Contracts Law.\n    *   This discovery rules out the Contracts Law and pushes the timeline back to at least 1968.\n\n4.  **Searching for Even Earlier Statutes:**\n    *   The next step is to examine legislation enacted before 1968. A key area to investigate is commercial law, much of which was inherited from the British Mandate but later re-enacted as Israeli \"New Version\" laws.\n    *   The **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957**, is a prime candidate. This law, passed by the Knesset, is a statute of the modern State of Israel.\n    *   Section 28(b) of this Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" (אוחז כשורה, *okhez keshura*). A crucial condition for achieving this status is that the person took the bill of exchange **in good faith** (*be'tom lev*) and for value.\n    *   This Ordinance from 1957 explicitly and importantly uses the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957, predates the Sale Law (1968) and the Contracts (General Part) Law (1973).\n    *   It contains an explicit statutory requirement of \"good faith\" (*tom lev*) in one of its key definitions.\n    *   Therefore, it stands as the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The question's emphasis on \"explicitly introduce\" is crucial. We are looking for the written words \"good faith\" or \"תום לב\", not for judicial interpretations that imply the principle.\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\" Statute:** The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] qualifies because, although based on a Mandatory ordinance, it was formally re-enacted as a new version by the Knesset, making it an Israeli statute.\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\":** It is essential not to confuse the first appearance of a legal term with its most famous or wide-ranging application, which came later with the Contracts Law.\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
