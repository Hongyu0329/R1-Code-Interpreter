    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of Dirichlet characters, their conductors, and their orders.\n\n**Step 1: Factorize the conductor N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7^1 \\times 11^1 \\times 13^1$.\n\nThe prime power factors of $N$ are $p_1^{a_1} = 4$, $p_2^{a_2} = 9$, $p_3^{a_3} = 7$, $p_4^{a_4} = 11$, and $p_5^{a_5} = 13$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Primitive Characters and their Structure**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is called **primitive** if its conductor is exactly $N$.\nIf $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$, a character $\\chi \\pmod{N}$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\nThe conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components: $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{cond}(\\chi_1) \\cdots \\operatorname{cond}(\\chi_k)$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive modulo $N$, we must have $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi) = N$. This happens if and only if each component character $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo its corresponding prime power $p_i^{a_i}$ (i.e., $\\operatorname{cond}(\\chi_i) = p_i^{a_i}$ for all $i$).\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its components: $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We need this order to be 6.\n\n**Step 3: Count Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor**\n\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each factor $p_i^{a_i}$ whose order is a divisor of 6. Let $n(p^a, d)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ of order $d$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character, which has order 2. So, $n(4, 2) = 1$. Its order must divide 6, which it does.\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6-2=4$. The characters induced from modulo 3 have orders dividing $\\phi(3)=2$. Therefore, the primitive characters modulo 9 must have orders that are not divisors of 2. The possible orders for characters mod 9 are divisors of 6. The number of characters of order $d$ is $\\phi(d)$.\n    - Order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$. These must be primitive. $n(9, 3)=2$.\n    - Order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$. These must be primitive. $n(9, 6)=2$.\n    The possible orders of primitive characters are 3 and 6, both of which divide 6. The total number of choices is $2+2=4$.\n*   **Modulo 7:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. We need characters whose order divides 6.\n    - Order 2: $n(7, 2)=\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Order 3: $n(7, 3)=\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Order 6: $n(7, 6)=\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices is $1+2+2=5$.\n*   **Modulo 11:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The order $d$ must divide both 10 and 6, so $d$ must divide $\\gcd(10, 6)=2$. Since primitive characters have order $d>1$, the only possible order is 2.\n    - Order 2: $n(11, 2)=\\phi(2)=1$.\n    The total number of choices is 1.\n*   **Modulo 13:** The group of characters $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose order divides 6. The order $d$ must divide both 12 and 6, so $d$ must divide $\\gcd(12, 6)=6$.\n    - Order 2: $n(13, 2)=\\phi(2)=1$.\n    - Order 3: $n(13, 3)=\\phi(3)=2$.\n    - Order 6: $n(13, 6)=\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices is $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Results**\n\nWe need to choose one primitive character $\\chi_i$ for each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$ such that their orders divide 6, and the LCM of their orders is exactly 6.\n\nLet's list the number of available choices for each component:\n*   Choices for $\\chi_1$ (mod 4): 1 character (order 2).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_2$ (mod 9): 4 characters (2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_3$ (mod 7): 5 characters (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_4$ (mod 11): 1 character (order 2).\n*   Choices for $\\chi_5$ (mod 13): 5 characters (1 of order 2, 2 of order 3, 2 of order 6).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose a tuple of such characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4, \\chi_5)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the order is exactly 6 for all these combinations. The order is $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_3), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_5))$.\nFor the LCM to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  All individual orders must divide 6. (This is satisfied by our selection process).\n2.  There must be at least one character whose order is a multiple of 2, and at least one whose order is a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's check these conditions for any of the 100 combinations:\n*   **Divisibility by 2:** The character $\\chi_1$ (mod 4) must have order 2. So the LCM is guaranteed to be a multiple of 2.\n*   **Divisibility by 3:** The character $\\chi_2$ (mod 9) must have order 3 or 6. In either case, its order is a multiple of 3. So the LCM is guaranteed to be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the LCM of the orders is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. As all individual orders divide 6, their LCM cannot be greater than 6. Therefore, the LCM is exactly 6 for every one of the 100 possible combinations.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
