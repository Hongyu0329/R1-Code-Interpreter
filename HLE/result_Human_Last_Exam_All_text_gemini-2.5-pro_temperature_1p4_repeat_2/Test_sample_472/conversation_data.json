    "This question asks for the scansion of a line of Latin poetry from Plautus. Plautine meter (part of early Latin comic meter) has more flexible rules than Classical poetry (like Virgil's). The meter is a **Trochaic Septenarius**, which consists of seven and a half trochaic feet.\n\nThe basic pattern is:\n`L S | L S | L S | L S || L S | L S | L S | L`\n(L = long syllable, S = short syllable, || = caesura/diaeresis)\n\nCommon variations in Plautus include:\n1.  **Resolution**: A long syllable (L) can be \"resolved\" into two short syllables (SS). So a trochee (`L S`) can become a tribrach (`SS S`).\n2.  **Substitution**: A spondee (`L L`) can replace a trochee, especially in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th feet.\n3.  **Iambic Shortening**: A sequence of a short followed by a long syllable (`S L`) can be scanned as two shorts (`S S`). This can happen within a word or across closely connected words.\n4.  **Hiatus**: An elision (merging a final vowel with a following initial vowel) might be ignored, especially at the caesura.\n5.  **License**: An iambus (`S L`) is sometimes allowed to stand in an even-numbered foot.\n\nHere is the step-by-step analysis of the line:\n**\"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"**\n\n**Step 1: Syllabification and Base Quantities**\nFirst, we determine the quantity of each syllable based on its vowel and position.\n\n*   **et**: Long by position (closed syllable). **L**\n*   **ti-bi**: Both vowels are short by nature (`tĭbĭ`). **S S**\n*   **be-ne**: Both vowels are short by nature (`bĕnĕ`). **S S**\n*   **es-se**: `es-` is long by position (followed by `ss`); `-se` is short. **L S**\n*   **so-li**: From `sōlus`. The dative `sōlī` has two long vowels. **L L**\n*   **quom**: An old spelling of `cum`. The vowel is long, and it's a closed syllable. **L**\n*   **si-bi**: Both vowels are short (`sĭbĭ`). **S S**\n*   **sit**: The vowel `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t`, making it long by position. **L**\n*   **ma-le**: Adverb, both vowels are short (`mălĕ`). **S S**\n\n**Step 2: Handling Elision and Syllable Count**\nThe line has 15 syllables. A catalectic trochaic septenarius also has 15 syllabic positions. `bene` ends in a vowel and `esse` begins with one. Normally, this would cause elision (`ben' esse`). However, if we elide, we are left with 14 syllables, which would require a resolution (`L -> SS`) to fill the 15 metrical slots. An alternative, common at the main caesura, is **hiatus** (no elision). The phrase `et tibi bene` forms a neat colon before the caesura. Let's proceed assuming hiatus, which preserves the 15-syllable count.\n\n**Step 3: Dividing into Feet**\nWe now fit the 15 syllables into the 7.5-foot trochaic pattern, applying the licenses mentioned above.\n\n1.  **Foot 1: `et ti-`**\n    *   Syllables: `et`, `ti`\n    *   Quantities: **L S**\n    *   This is a perfect **Trochee**.\n\n2.  **Foot 2: `bi be ne`**\n    *   Syllables: `-bi`, `be-`, `ne`\n    *   Quantities: **S S S**\n    *   The metrical pattern calls for an `L S` foot. Here, we see a **resolution**, where the long `L` is replaced by two shorts `SS`. The foot `L S` becomes `SS S`. This is a **Tribrach**, a common substitution.\n\n3.  **Foot 3: `es-se`**\n    *   Syllables: `es-`, `se`\n    *   Quantities: **L S**\n    *   This is a perfect **Trochee**.\n\n4.  **Foot 4: `so-li`**\n    *   Syllables: `so-`, `li`\n    *   Quantities: **L L**\n    *   This is a **Spondee**. A spondee is a valid substitution in an even-numbered foot (the 4th foot). This also marks the caesura (diaeresis) of the line.\n\n5.  **Foot 5: `quom si-`**\n    *   Syllables: `quom`, `si-`\n    *   Quantities: **L S**\n    *   This is a perfect **Trochee**.\n\n6.  **Foot 6: `-bi sit`**\n    *   Syllables: `-bi`, `sit`\n    *   Quantities: **S L**\n    *   This is an **Iambus**. While irregular, an iamb is a tolerated license in the even-numbered feet in Plautine meter.\n\n7.  **Foot 7 & Catalexis: `ma-le`**\n    *   Syllables: `ma-`, `le`\n    *   Quantities: **S S**\n    *   The pattern calls for a final trochee followed by a final catalectic syllable (`L S | L`). However, Plautus often treats the end of the line with freedom. Here, the final two syllables form a **Pyrrhic** (`S S`), which stands in place of the final trochee `L S`, and the line is considered acatalectic (a full 7 feet) instead of catalectic. Another view is that the pyrrhic simply replaces the final catalectic trochee (`L X`).\n\nCombining these feet gives the complete scansion.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe analysis results in the following scansion, foot by foot:\nL S | S S S | L S | L L || L S | S L | S S\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S S>>>"
