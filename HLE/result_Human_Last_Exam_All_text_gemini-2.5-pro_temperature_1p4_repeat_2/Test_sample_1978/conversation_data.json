    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the index of the considered boundary-value problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Definition of the Index of a Boundary-Value Problem**\n\nFor a linear boundary-value problem described by a system of $n$ first-order ordinary differential equations with $k$ linearly independent boundary conditions, the index of the problem is defined as:\nIndex = $n - k$.\nOur goal is to determine the values of $n$ and $k$ from the problem statement.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Dimension of the System, $n$**\n\nThe problem presents a system of differential equations $x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)$. There is an apparent contradiction in the dimensions provided:\n*   The matrix $A$ is given as a $202000 \\times 202000$ matrix.\n*   The vector $I(t)$ is given with 202000 components.\n*   The vector $x(t)$ is explicitly defined as $x(t) = (x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), ..., x_{2024}(t))$.\n*   The boundary conditions involve $x_1(t)$, $x_2(t)$, and $x_{2024}(t)$.\n\nFor the matrix equation $x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)$ to be mathematically consistent, the dimension of the vector $x(t)$ must match the dimensions of the matrix $A$ and the vector $I(t)$. This would suggest $n=202000$.\n\nHowever, the definition of $x(t)$ explicitly lists its components up to $x_{2024}(t)$. More importantly, one of the boundary conditions is specifically on the component $x_{2024}(t)$. If the system had 202000 components, $x_{2024}$ would be an intermediate component, and its choice for a boundary condition would be arbitrary. In contrast, if the system has 2024 components, then $x_{2024}$ is the last component, which is a natural choice for a boundary condition.\n\nThis leads to the most logical interpretation: the problem is about a system of $n=2024$ equations, and the definitions of $A$ and $I$ with 202000 components are given such that the relevant sub-parts should be used. That is, the system uses the principal $2024 \\times 2024$ submatrix of $A$ and the first 2024 components of $I(t)$.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that the dimension of the system is **$n = 2024$**.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Number of Linearly Independent Boundary Conditions, $k$**\n\nThe problem provides the following six boundary conditions:\n1.  $x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0$\n2.  $x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0$\n3.  $5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0$\n4.  $100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0$\n5.  $1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0$\n6.  $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$\n\nWe need to find the number of linearly independent conditions among these.\n*   Condition (1) is an independent constraint on $x_1$. It can be written as $x_1(0) - x_1(T) = 0$.\n*   Condition (2) is a constraint on $x_2$. It can be written as $x_2(0) - x_2(T) = 0$.\n*   Condition (3) is $5(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0$, which is equivalent to condition (2). It is linearly dependent.\n*   Condition (4) is $100(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0$, which is also equivalent to condition (2). It is linearly dependent.\n*   Condition (5) is $-1000(x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0$, also equivalent to condition (2). It is linearly dependent.\n*   Condition (6) is $100(x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0)) = 0$. Dividing by 100, we get $x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0$. This is a constraint on $x_{2024}$.\n\nThe unique, linearly independent conditions are:\n1.  $x_1(0) - x_1(T) = 0$\n2.  $x_2(0) - x_2(T) = 0$\n3.  $x_{2024}(0) - x_{2024}(T) = 0$\n\nThese three conditions are linearly independent because each condition constrains a different component of the vector $x(t)$ ($x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_{2024}$, respectively).\n\nTherefore, the number of linearly independent boundary conditions is **$k = 3$**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Index of the Problem**\n\nUsing the formula for the index of a boundary-value problem:\nIndex = $n - k$\nSubstituting the values we found for $n$ and $k$:\nIndex = $2024 - 3$\nIndex = $2021$"
