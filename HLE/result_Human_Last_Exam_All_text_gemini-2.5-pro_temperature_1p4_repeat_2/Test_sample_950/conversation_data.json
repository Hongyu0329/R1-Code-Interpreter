    "Answering this question involves several steps: understanding the space in question, understanding the mathematical terms, applying a known theorem about the cohomology of this space, and calculating the final value.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the space:** The \"space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$\" is the real Grassmannian manifold, denoted as $Gr(3, 5)$. This is the set of all 3-dimensional linear subspaces within the 5-dimensional real vector space $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the question:** We need to find the \"rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring\" of this space.\n    *   **Integral cohomology ring:** This is the graded ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{\\infty} H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, where the group operation is addition and the ring structure is given by the cup product.\n    *   **Torsion subgroup:** For an abelian group $A$, its torsion subgroup $T(A)$ consists of all elements of finite order. Here, we are considering the ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ as an abelian group under addition. Its torsion subgroup is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each cohomology group $H^i$: $T(H^*) = \\bigoplus_i T(H^i(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    *   **Rank:** The rank of an abelian group $A$ is defined as the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring it with the field of rational numbers, i.e., $\\text{rank}(A) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(A \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} \\mathbb{Q})$. A key property is that for any torsion group $T$ (a group where every element has finite order), its rank is 0. This is because for any $t \\in T$, there is an integer $n > 0$ such that $nt=0$. In $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$, the element $t \\otimes q$ can be written as $t \\otimes (n q / n) = (nt) \\otimes (q/n) = 0 \\otimes (q/n) = 0$. Thus, $T \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$ is the zero vector space, and its dimension is 0.\n\n3.  **Analyze the torsion of $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$:** The integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is well-studied. It is known that any torsion in $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$ must be 2-torsion (i.e., every torsion element has order 2). There is a precise condition for when this cohomology is torsion-free.\n    *   **Theorem (Borel):** The integral cohomology $H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free if and only if there is no even integer in the interval $(n-k, k]$. Equivalently, there is no integer $j$ such that $n-k < 2j \\le k$.\n\n4.  **Apply the theorem to $Gr(3, 5)$:**\n    *   For our space, we have $k=3$ and $n=5$.\n    *   Thus, $n-k = 5-3 = 2$.\n    *   The condition is that there is no integer $j$ satisfying the inequality $2 < 2j \\le 3$.\n    *   Dividing by 2, we get $1 < j \\le 1.5$.\n    *   There is no integer $j$ that satisfies this condition.\n\n5.  **Conclusion about the torsion subgroup:** Since the condition in the theorem is met, the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$ is torsion-free. This means its torsion subgroup is the trivial group, which contains only the identity element: $\\{0\\}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** We need to find the rank of this torsion subgroup.\n    *   The torsion subgroup is $\\{0\\}$.\n    *   The rank of the trivial group $\\{0\\}$ is 0.\n\n**Verification via calculation:**\nWe can verify this result by a different method. The total number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in the integral homology (which corresponds to the torsion in cohomology) can be calculated by the formula:\nTotal 2-torsion rank = $\\frac{1}{2} (\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^*(X; \\mathbb{Z}_2) - \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H^*(X; \\mathbb{Q}))$.\n\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}} H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Q})$ is the sum of the Betti numbers, which equals the total number of Schubert cells. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$. For $Gr(3, 5)$, this is $\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$.\n\n*   $\\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H^*(Gr(k, n); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is the sum of the mod-2 Betti numbers. The PoincarÃ© series for $H^*(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is $P(t) = \\frac{(1-t^3)(1-t^4)(1-t^5)}{(1-t)(1-t^2)(1-t^3)} = \\frac{(1-t^4)(1-t^5)}{(1-t)(1-t^2)} = (1+t^2)(1+t+t^2+t^3+t^4) = 1+t+2t^2+2t^3+2t^4+t^5+t^6$. The sum of the coefficients (dimensions of the cohomology groups) is $1+1+2+2+2+1+1 = 10$.\n\n*   Plugging these values into the formula, the total 2-torsion rank is $\\frac{1}{2}(10 - 10) = 0$. This confirms that there is no torsion in the integral cohomology.\n\nTherefore, the torsion subgroup is trivial, and its rank is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
