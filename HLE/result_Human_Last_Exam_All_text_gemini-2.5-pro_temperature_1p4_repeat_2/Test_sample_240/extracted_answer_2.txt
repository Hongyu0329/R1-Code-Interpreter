The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance is due to its **active detuning circuitry**. These circuits, often using PIN diodes, are designed to protect the sensitive coil from the scanner's powerful transmit pulse by intentionally making the coil non-resonant. This safety mode is the default state when the coil is unpowered on a bench. To resonate, the coil requires a specific DC voltage from the MRI scanner to switch it into its "receive" mode. Additionally, the coil's integrated **preamplifier** requires power to provide the correct impedance for the circuit to resonate properly; an unpowered preamp will improperly load the coil and suppress its resonance. Other factors like complex **coil geometry** (e.g., gradiometers), **RF shielding**, or a **balanced circuit design** can also severely weaken the magnetic coupling to your probe, making the resonance undetectable.
