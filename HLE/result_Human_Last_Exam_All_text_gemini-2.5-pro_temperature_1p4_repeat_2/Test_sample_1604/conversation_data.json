    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Artist and her Subject Matter**\nThe artist in question is Elizabeth Thompson, Lady Butler (1846â€“1933). She was a famous British painter who specialized in military scenes, particularly those involving the British Army. To answer the question, we need to survey her notable works and identify the historical events they depict.\n\n**Step 2: List Key Paintings and the Battles They Depict**\nWe will list some of Lady Butler's most famous paintings and the historical date of the battle or event shown.\n\n*   ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras* (painted 1875):** Depicts the Battle of Quatre Bras, which took place on **June 16, 1815**, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!* (painted 1881):** Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo, on **June 18, 1815**.\n*   ***The Roll Call* (painted 1874):** Depicts a scene from the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War. The battle took place on **November 5, 1854**.\n*   ***Balaclava* (painted 1876):** Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava, also in the Crimean War, on **October 25, 1854**.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift* (painted 1880):** Depicts the Battle of Rorke's Drift from the Anglo-Zulu War, which occurred on **January 22-23, 1879**.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!* (painted 1898):** Depicts an incident at the Battle of Laing's Nek during the First Boer War, which happened on **January 28, 1881**.\n*   ***Tel-el-Kebir* (painted 1885):** Depicts the Battle of Tel El Kebir during the Anglo-Egyptian War on **September 13, 1882**.\n*   ***The Camel Corps* (painted 1893):** Depicts the British Camel Corps during the Nile Expedition (1884-1885) to relieve Khartoum. The most notable engagement of this corps was the Battle of Abu Klea on **January 17, 1885**.\n*   ***The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, Egypt* (painted 1917):** Depicts a charge during the Affair of Agagia, part of the Senussi Campaign within the wider First World War. This event took place on **February 26, 1916**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Dates of the Battles**\nNow we compare the dates of the historical events depicted in the paintings:\n\n*   Battle of Quatre Bras: 1815\n*   Battle of Waterloo: 1815\n*   Battle of Balaclava: 1854\n*   Battle of Inkerman: 1854\n*   Battle of Rorke's Drift: 1879\n*   Battle of Laing's Nek: 1881\n*   Battle of Tel El Kebir: 1882\n*   Battle of Abu Klea: 1885\n*   Affair of Agagia: 1916\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Latest Battle**\nBy comparing the dates, it is clear that the Affair of Agagia in **1916** is the most recent historical battle depicted in a major painting by Lady Butler. This battle, part of the First World War, is significantly later than her more famous works depicting Victorian-era and Napoleonic conflicts. The painting itself, *The Charge of the Dorset Yeomanry at Agagia, Egypt*, was completed in 1917, confirming she was painting contemporary or very recent historical events even late in her career.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the date the painting was created and the date of the historical event it depicts. The question asks for the latest *historical* battle.\n*   Some paintings depict general scenes rather than a specific, named battle (e.g., *Listed for the Connaught Rangers*). The focus must be on identifiable, dated battles.\n*   Lady Butler did paint scenes from the First World War, which occurred much later than her more famous Victorian-era paintings. Her work on the Affair of Agagia is a key example.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis of her works, the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the Affair of Agagia.\n\n<<<Affair of Agagia>>>"
