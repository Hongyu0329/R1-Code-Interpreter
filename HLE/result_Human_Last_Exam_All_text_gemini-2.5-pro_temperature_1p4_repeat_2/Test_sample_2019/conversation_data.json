    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem of placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Non-Attacking Rules\n\n*   **5x5 Toroidal Board:** A 5x5 grid where the edges wrap around. This means calculations for position are done modulo 5. We can represent the rows and columns by the set `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. A move off one edge brings you to the opposite edge.\n*   **Non-Attacking Queens:** Two queens at positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` attack each other if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. On a toroidal board, this translates to:\n    1.  **Row attack:** `r1 = r2`\n    2.  **Column attack:** `c1 = c2`\n    3.  **Diagonal attack:** The concept of diagonals also wraps around. Two queens are on the same diagonal if the difference or sum of their coordinates is the same (modulo 5).\n        *   Same \"main\" diagonal: `(r1 - c1) mod 5 = (r2 - c2) mod 5`\n        *   Same \"anti-\" diagonal: `(r1 + c1) mod 5 = (r2 + c2) mod 5`\n\nTherefore, for a set of 4 queens placed at `(r_i, c_i)` for `i=1,2,3,4` to be non-attacking, the following four sets of values must each contain 4 distinct elements:\n1.  The set of rows: `{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4}`\n2.  The set of columns: `{c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}`\n3.  The set of main diagonal indices: `{(r_1-c_1) mod 5, (r_2-c_2) mod 5, ...}`\n4.  The set of anti-diagonal indices: `{(r_1+c_1) mod 5, (r_2+c_2) mod 5, ...}`\n\n### Step 2: Relating the 4-Queens Problem to the 5-Queens Problem\n\nThis problem can be elegantly solved by considering the \"complementary\" problem of placing 5 non-attacking queens on the same board. A valid 5-queen placement `S = {(r_i, c_i) | i=0..4}` would require the sets of `{r_i}`, `{c_i}`, `{(r_i-c_i) mod 5}`, and `{(r_i+c_i) mod 5}` to each be a full permutation of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nLet's establish a connection between 4-queen and 5-queen solutions.\n\n*   **From 5-queens to 4-queens:** If we have a valid 5-queen solution, we can remove any one of the 5 queens. The remaining 4 queens will not attack each other, as their rows, columns, and diagonals were all distinct in the original 5-queen setup. Thus, every 5-queen solution generates 5 distinct 4-queen solutions.\n\n*   **From 4-queens to 5-queens:** Let's consider a valid 4-queen placement, `Q`. This placement uses 4 out of 5 possible values for each coordinate type. Let the unused row be `r_u`, the unused column `c_u`, the unused main diagonal index `d_u`, and the unused anti-diagonal index `s_u`.\n    We can show a remarkable property that links these unused coordinates. Let the 4 queens be at `(r_i, c_i)`. We know that `Sum_{j=0 to 4} j = 10 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}`.\n    \n    The sum of the used row indices is `Sum(r_i) = (Sum_{j=0 to 4} j) - r_u \\equiv -r_u \\pmod{5}`.\n    Similarly, `Sum(c_i) \\equiv -c_u \\pmod{5}`, `Sum(d_i) \\equiv -d_u \\pmod{5}`, and `Sum(s_i) \\equiv -s_u \\pmod{5}`.\n\n    Now, let's use the definitions of the diagonal indices:\n    `Sum(d_i) = Sum(r_i - c_i) = Sum(r_i) - Sum(c_i) \\equiv (-r_u) - (-c_u) = c_u - r_u \\pmod{5}`.\n    Since `Sum(d_i) \\equiv -d_u`, we get `-d_u \\equiv c_u - r_u`, which means `d_u \\equiv r_u - c_u \\pmod{5}`.\n\n    `Sum(s_i) = Sum(r_i + c_i) = Sum(r_i) + Sum(c_i) \\equiv (-r_u) + (-c_u) = -(r_u + c_u) \\pmod{5}`.\n    Since `Sum(s_i) \\equiv -s_u`, we get `-s_u \\equiv -(r_u + c_u)`, which means `s_u \\equiv r_u + c_u \\pmod{5}`.\n\n    This proves that for any 4-queen solution, the square defined by the unused row and column, `(r_u, c_u)`, lies precisely on the unused main diagonal and unused anti-diagonal. Therefore, adding a queen at this position `(r_u, c_u)` completes the 4-queen solution into a valid 5-queen solution.\n\nThis establishes a one-to-one correspondence: every 4-queen solution can be uniquely extended to a 5-queen solution, and every 5-queen solution generates exactly 5 distinct 4-queen solutions. Therefore, the number of 4-queen solutions is `5` times the number of 5-queen solutions.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the 5-Queen Solutions\n\nLet `N5` be the number of 5-queen solutions. A solution is a set of 5 squares. We can represent any such solution by fixing the rows to be `(0, 1, 2, 3, 4)` and finding a permutation `p` for the columns, so the queen positions are `(i, p(i))`. The conditions for `p` to represent a valid solution are:\n1.  `p` is a permutation of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`. (Ensures no column attacks).\n2.  The set of values `d_i = (i - p(i)) mod 5` must be a permutation of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n3.  The set of values `s_i = (i + p(i)) mod 5` must be a permutation of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\nThis is a known combinatorial problem. The permutations `p` that satisfy these conditions for `n=5` are the affine permutations `p(i) = ai + b \\pmod{5}`, where `a` must not be `0, 1, or 4 (-1 mod 5)`.\n*   `a` cannot be `0` (since `p` must be a permutation).\n*   `a` cannot be `1` (otherwise `i - p(i) = -b`, not a permutation).\n*   `a` cannot be `4` (otherwise `i + p(i) = b`, not a permutation).\n\nSo, `a` can be `2` or `3`. The value `b` can be any of `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}` (5 choices).\n*   Number of choices for `a`: 2 (`a=2` or `a=3`)\n*   Number of choices for `b`: 5\nThis gives `2 * 5 = 10` such permutations. It has been shown that for `n=5`, these 10 affine permutations are the only solutions.\n\nEach of these 10 permutations defines a unique set of 5 squares, resulting in `N5 = 10` distinct solutions for the 5-queens problem.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\n\nUsing the relationship found in Step 2 and the result from Step 3:\n*   Number of 5-queen solutions (`N5`) = 10.\n*   Number of 4-queen solutions (`N4`) = `5 * N5`.\n\n`N4 = 5 * 10 = 50`.\n\nThere are 50 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
