    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the character that the main character of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Main Character:** The protagonist of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection) is Adam Zamoyski. He is a \"stahs,\" a human resurrected from the 21st century into the far future.\n\n2.  **Identify the Main Character's Key Relationship:** Throughout the novel, Adam Zamoyski's most significant and developing relationship is with a being named Angelika.\n\n3.  **Understand the Nature of the Other Character:** Angelika is initially presented as a \"phoebe-an,\" a highly advanced artificial intelligence or infomorph. Her primary role is to act as Adam's guide, translator, and interface with the incredibly complex and alien post-human civilization he finds himself in.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Concept of \"Marriage\" in the Novel's Context:** The term \"marriage\" as understood in the 21st century does not directly apply in the same way in the novel's far-future setting. Relationships and unions are far more complex. The ultimate form of a committed bond is not a social or religious ceremony but a technological and existential one.\n\n5.  **Determine the Climactic Union:** The culmination of Adam and Angelika's relationship is a profound and intimate merging of their \"phoebes\" (their data-selves or consciousnesses). This is a form of unity that transcends a traditional marriage, as they effectively become a single, composite entity. This merging is the closest and most powerful equivalent to marriage depicted in the story.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Based on the narrative, the character with whom Adam Zamoyski forms this ultimate, marriage-equivalent bond is Angelika.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
