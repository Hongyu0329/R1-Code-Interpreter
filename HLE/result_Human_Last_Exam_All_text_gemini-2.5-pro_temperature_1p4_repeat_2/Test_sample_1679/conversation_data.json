    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step 1: Identify the Subject - The Luxor Obelisks**\n\nThe question refers to a \"Luxor Obelisk.\" It's crucial to know what and where these are. Originally a pair, the two Luxor Obelisks were carved for the Luxor Temple in Egypt. Today, they are in two different locations:\n\n1.  **Luxor, Egypt:** One obelisk remains in its original location, standing in front of the Luxor Temple.\n2.  **Paris, France:** The second obelisk was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands at the center of the Place de la Concorde.\n\nTherefore, a film could satisfy the query by depicting either of these two locations.\n\n### **Step 2: Define the Search Criteria**\n\nWe need to search through the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture, in chronological order, starting from the first award ceremony (for films of 1927/1928). We are looking for the *first* film on this list that visually depicts either the Place de la Concorde in Paris or the Luxor Temple in Egypt, with the obelisk visible.\n\n### **Step 3: Chronological Analysis of Best Picture Winners**\n\nWe will analyze the winners chronologically, focusing on films with settings in Paris or Egypt.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *The Broadway Melody* (1929), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930), and *Grand Hotel* (1932) are set in WWI France (battlefields, not Paris landmarks), New York, Germany, and Berlin, respectively. None feature the obelisks.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is set in Paris. However, its key scenes take place in courtrooms, cafes, and at the École Militaire for the Dreyfus affair. While it features shots of Paris, it does not have a prominent or clear scene showing the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk.\n*   **1940s:** Winners like *Gone with the Wind* (1939), *Rebecca* (1940), and *How Green Was My Valley* (1941) are not set in the required locations.\n*   ***Casablanca* (1943):** This film features a famous flashback sequence set in Paris. This montage includes iconic landmarks such as the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. However, upon close inspection of the montage, the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk are not shown.\n*   **Post-War to 1950:** Winners like *The Lost Weekend* (1945), *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946), and *All the King's Men* (1949) are set in the United States.\n*   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** As the title suggests, this musical is set entirely in Paris and the city itself is a central element of the film. It features numerous on-location scenes. Specifically, during the musical number **\"'S Wonderful\"**, the characters played by Gene Kelly and Georges Guétary sing and dance at various Parisian locations, including a clear and unmistakable sequence filmed at the Place de la Concorde, with the Luxor Obelisk prominently featured in the frame. This is a definitive on-screen depiction.\n*   **Later Films:** Other winners like *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) also show the Paris obelisk, and films like *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) are set in the Middle East but not in Luxor. However, since *An American in Paris* won in 1951, any later film cannot be the *first*. There are no earlier Best Picture winners with confirmed depictions of the obelisk in either Luxor or Paris.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n1.  **Two Obelisks:** The question could be answered by a film showing the obelisk in Paris OR the one in Luxor. The Paris obelisk has appeared in films far more frequently.\n2.  **Chronological Order:** Finding the *first* winner is the primary objective, so the analysis must proceed year by year from the beginning of the awards.\n3.  **Visual Confirmation:** The film must actually show the obelisk on-screen. Simply being set in Paris is not enough. *An American in Paris* has a clear, confirmed scene featuring the obelisk.\n4.  **Best Picture \"Winner\":** The film must have won the award for Best Picture, not just been nominated.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nAfter a chronological review of the Best Picture winners, the first film to definitively depict one of the Luxor Obelisks is *An American in Paris*. The film won the award for 1951 and features a musical number shot on location at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, with the obelisk clearly visible. No earlier winner has a confirmed on-screen depiction of either the Paris or the Luxor obelisk.\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
