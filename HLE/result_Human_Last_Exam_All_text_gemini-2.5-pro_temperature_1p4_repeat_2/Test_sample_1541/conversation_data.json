    "### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective**: The goal is to reorder the numbers in a given sum so they appear in non-decreasing (sorted) order.\n2.  **Input**: A single string representing the sum, e.g., `3+2+1+4`. The string contains only digits from '1' to '4' and the '+' symbol. The length of the string is at most 1000 characters.\n3.  **Output**: A new string with the same numbers, sorted, and separated by '+'. For `3+2+1+4`, the output should be `1+2+3+4`.\n4.  **Core Constraint**: The numbers involved are restricted to 1, 2, 3, and 4. This is a crucial piece of information that heavily influences the optimal solution.\n5.  **Memory Efficiency**: The main requirement is to find a solution that uses the minimum amount of memory for its variables.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Sorting Method**: A general-purpose sorting algorithm like Quick Sort or Merge Sort would work, but they are not the most memory-efficient for this specific problem. Since the set of numbers is very small and fixed ({1, 2, 3, 4}), a **Counting Sort** is the ideal approach. It involves counting the occurrences of each number and then reconstructing the sum.\n2.  **Input Handling**: Reading the entire 1000-character string into a buffer (e.g., `char s[1001];`) is a straightforward but memory-intensive approach. A far more memory-efficient technique is to **process the input as a stream**, reading one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`. This avoids allocating a large buffer for the input string.\n3.  **Variable Data Types**: To minimize memory, it's essential to choose the smallest possible standard C data type for each variable that can safely hold its required range of values.\n    *   The counters for the numbers will not exceed the maximum number of summands. In a 1000-character string, the maximum number of summands is 501 (e.g., \"1+1+...+1\"). A `short int` (typically 2 bytes, max value 32,767) is sufficient.\n    *   Loop variables will also not exceed 501, so `short int` is appropriate here as well.\n    *   A flag variable (e.g., to track the first term) can be a `char` (1 byte).\n    *   The variable used to store the result of `getchar()` must be an `int`, as it needs to be able to hold the special `EOF` (End-of-File) value in addition to all possible character values.\n4.  **Output Formatting**: The output must be generated with `+` signs between the numbers, but not at the end. This can be handled by printing a `+` *before* each number except for the very first one. A simple flag variable can track whether the first term has been printed.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer (Memory Calculation)\n\nFollowing the most memory-efficient approach identified above:\n\n1.  **Algorithm**: Read the input character by character. Use four counters for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. After counting is complete, iterate from 1 to 4, printing the required number of each digit, separated by `+`.\n\n2.  **Identify Variables**: We need the following variables in our C program:\n    *   `c`: To store the character read from input via `getchar()`.\n    *   `count1`, `count2`, `count3`, `count4`: To store the frequencies of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n    *   `i`: A loop counter for the printing phase.\n    *   `first_term`: A flag to correctly handle the '+' separators.\n\n3.  **Choose Optimal Data Types and Calculate Memory**: We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes, `sizeof(short int)` is 2 bytes, and `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n    *   `int c;`\n        *   Reason: Must be `int` to handle `EOF`.\n        *   Memory: 4 bytes.\n\n    *   `short int count1, count2, count3, count4;`\n        *   Reason: The maximum count is 501, which fits within a `short int`.\n        *   Memory: 4 variables * 2 bytes/variable = 8 bytes.\n\n    *   `short int i;`\n        *   Reason: The loop will run at most 501 times. `short int` is sufficient.\n        *   Memory: 2 bytes.\n\n    *   `char first_term;`\n        *   Reason: A simple boolean flag (0 or 1) requires only one byte.\n        *   Memory: 1 byte.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Memory (`m`)**:\n    *   m = (memory for `c`) + (memory for counters) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `first_term`)\n    *   m = 4 + 8 + 2 + 1\n    *   m = 15 bytes.\n\nThis is the total memory allocated for variables within the function to solve the problem in the most memory-efficient way.\n\n<<<15>>>"
