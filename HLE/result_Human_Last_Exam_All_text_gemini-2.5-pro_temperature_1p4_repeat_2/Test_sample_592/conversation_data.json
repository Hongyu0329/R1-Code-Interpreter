    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the specific US city to which the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the characters and their context in the film.**\n*   The film *Ovosodo* (English title: *Hard Boiled Egg*) is directed by Paolo Virzì.\n*   The main protagonist of the film is Piero Mansani.\n*   Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, is Piero's best friend. He comes from a wealthy family, contrasting with Piero's working-class background.\n*   A key plot point in the film is the evolution of their friendship and their different life paths.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific event in the movie's plot.**\nThe event in question is Tommaso's departure from Italy. This is a significant moment in the film, as it represents a major change in Piero's life and the end of a certain phase of their youth. Tommaso reveals to Piero that he is moving to the United States with his partner.\n\n**Step 4: Consult reliable sources to find the specific city.**\nTo verify the exact city mentioned in the film, one can consult detailed plot summaries, film analyses, or encyclopedic sources about the movie.\n*   Plot summaries of *Ovosodo* consistently mention that Tommaso reveals his homosexuality to Piero and announces his plan to leave.\n*   These sources explicitly state that the destination he is moving to with his American partner is New York.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Character accuracy:** The user correctly identifies Tommaso as the character who moves, although he is the best friend of the protagonist, not the protagonist himself.\n*   **Plot detail:** The specific city is a detail that needs to be confirmed from the film's script or reliable summaries, as it's an easy detail to misremember or for sources to omit.\n*   **Confirmation:** Cross-referencing multiple sources (e.g., Wikipedia plot summary, IMDb plot keywords, film reviews) confirms the city is consistently identified as New York.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the final answer.**\nBased on the plot of the film *Ovosodo*, Tommaso announces that he is moving to New York City.\n\n<<<New York>>>"
