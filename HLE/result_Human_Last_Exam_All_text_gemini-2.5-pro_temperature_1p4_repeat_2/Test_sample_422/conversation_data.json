    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Core Theory:** We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of Knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    1.  P is true (Truth condition).\n    2.  S believes P (Belief condition).\n    3.  S is justified in believing P (Justification condition).\n*   **Primary Constraint:** We must assume that the only available epistemic states for a person are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\". This is a significant simplification of reality, as it removes states like doubt, suspension of judgment, certainty, etc. It forces us to define all epistemic components using only these two concepts.\n*   **Secondary Constraint:** We must explicitly ignore \"Gettier problems\". Gettier problems are counterexamples where a person has a justified true belief that is not knowledge because the justification is faulty or the truth is accidental (a matter of luck). We need to find problems inherent to the JTB structure under the primary constraint, not problems of epistemic luck.\n*   **Objective:** Identify two distinct problems that the JTB theory encounters due to these constraints.\n\n**2. List of Careful Points**\n*   The relationship between \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" in this context is key. The JTB definition itself posits that Knowledge is a specific *type* of Belief (one that is both justified and true). Therefore, Knowledge and Belief cannot be treated as completely separate or mutually exclusive categories.\n*   The concepts of \"Justification\" and \"Truth\" are central to the JTB definition. Since our only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief, we must analyze how an agent can establish or possess \"Justification\" and access the \"Truth\" of a belief using only the tools of Knowledge and Belief.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Answer\n\nLet's analyze the Justification and Truth conditions under the given constraints.\n\n**Problem 1: The Justification Condition leads to Circularity or an Infinite Regress.**\n\nThe JTB theory states that a belief must be *justified* to count as knowledge. This justification must itself consist of other reasons or evidence, which, in our constrained world, must be founded upon either another Belief or prior Knowledge.\n\n*   **Case A: Justification is based on Belief.** If the justification for believing proposition P is another belief, Q, then what justifies the belief in Q? Another belief, R? This creates a chain of beliefs justifying beliefs, which regresses infinitely without ever reaching a solid foundation. Such a justification would be weak and arguably insufficient to turn a true belief into knowledge.\n*   **Case B: Justification is based on Knowledge.** To provide a firm foundation, one might argue that the justification for believing P must be based on something you *know*, Q. The JTB formula would then effectively become: \"Knowledge of P requires a justified belief in P, where the justification rests on pre-existing Knowledge of Q.\" This makes the definition of knowledge circular. It defines \"Knowledge\" in terms of \"Knowledge\". To acquire any piece of knowledge, you must already possess another piece of knowledge to serve as justification. This raises the insoluble question of how the very first piece of knowledge could ever be acquired.\n\nTherefore, the Justification condition is problematic: it either leads to an infinite regress of weak justifications (if based on belief) or becomes circular by defining knowledge in terms of itself (if based on prior knowledge).\n\n**Problem 2: The Truth Condition becomes either Redundant or Circular.**\n\nThe JTB theory requires that the proposition P be *true*. Truth is an objective, external property of the proposition. However, for an agent to factor this condition into their epistemic evaluation, they must have some stance towards the proposition's truth. Within our constrained system, this stance must be either Belief or Knowledge.\n\n*   **Case A: Establishing Truth requires Belief.** If an agent merely needs to *believe* that P is true to satisfy the truth condition, then the condition becomes redundant. The definition would be: \"Knowledge of P is when you believe P, you are justified in believing P, and you believe that P is true.\" Believing P and believing that \"P is true\" are essentially the same mental state. The formula collapses to \"Knowledge = Justified Belief\", which is universally rejected as it would allow justified false beliefs to count as knowledge.\n*   **Case B: Establishing Truth requires Knowledge.** If an agent must *know* that P is true to satisfy the truth condition, the entire JTB definition becomes immediately and fatally circular. The definition would be: \"Knowledge of P is when you believe P, you are justified in believing P, and you *know* that P is true.\" This means you must already know P is true in order to come to know that P is true. This is a tautology, not an analysis, and offers no insight into how knowledge is acquired.\n\nTherefore, the Truth condition is also problematic: attempting to integrate this objective requirement into an agent's epistemic states makes it either redundant with the belief condition or hopelessly circular by requiring prior knowledge of the very fact one seeks to know.\n\n<<<The two problems are:\n1.  **The Problem of Justification (Circularity/Regress):** The \"Justification\" condition requires reasons. If these reasons are founded on mere Beliefs, it leads to an infinite regress with no solid foundation. If the reasons must be founded on prior Knowledge, the definition of knowledge becomes circular (defining knowledge in terms of itself), making it impossible to explain the acquisition of the first piece of knowledge.\n2.  **The Problem of Truth (Redundancy/Circularity):** For an agent to ascertain the \"Truth\" of a proposition, they must have an epistemic stance. If this only requires *believing* the proposition is true, the truth condition becomes redundant with the belief condition. If it requires *knowing* the proposition is true, the entire JTB definition becomes circular, as one would need to know something is true before they can satisfy the conditions for knowing it.>>>"
