The two problems are:
1.  **The Problem of Justification (Circularity/Regress):** The "Justification" condition requires reasons. If these reasons are founded on mere Beliefs, it leads to an infinite regress with no solid foundation. If the reasons must be founded on prior Knowledge, the definition of knowledge becomes circular (defining knowledge in terms of itself), making it impossible to explain the acquisition of the first piece of knowledge.
2.  **The Problem of Truth (Redundancy/Circularity):** For an agent to ascertain the "Truth" of a proposition, they must have an epistemic stance. If this only requires *believing* the proposition is true, the truth condition becomes redundant with the belief condition. If it requires *knowing* the proposition is true, the entire JTB definition becomes circular, as one would need to know something is true before they can satisfy the conditions for knowing it.
