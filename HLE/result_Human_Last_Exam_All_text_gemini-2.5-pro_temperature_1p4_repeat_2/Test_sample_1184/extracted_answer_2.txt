Here is the final answer based on the analysis:

**1) Hotspots for Interaction (Binding) on human Cavβ1b subunit (UniProt: P54283):**
These residues are located within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain and form the hydrophobic pocket that binds the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) of the Cav2.3 alpha-1 subunit.

*   **Y211** (Tyrosine at position 211)
*   **L214** (Leucine at position 214)
*   **W236** (Tryptophan at position 236)
*   **E241** (Glutamate at position 241)
*   **L297** (Leucine at position 297)
*   **V299** (Valine at position 299)
*   **Y347** (Tyrosine at position 347)
*   **I350** (Isoleucine at position 350)

**2) Hotspots for Gating Modulation on human Cavβ1b subunit (UniProt: P54283):**
These residues or regions influence the channel's opening, closing, and inactivation properties after the subunit has bound.

*   **The N-terminal Domain (Residues 1-30):** This entire region is a functional hotspot, primarily responsible for modulating the kinetics of channel inactivation. Its presence and conformation dictate how quickly the channel inactivates.
*   **F161** (Phenylalanine at position 161): Located in the SH3 domain, this residue is implicated in the allosteric modulation of the voltage-dependence of activation, helping to determine the membrane potential at which the channel opens.
