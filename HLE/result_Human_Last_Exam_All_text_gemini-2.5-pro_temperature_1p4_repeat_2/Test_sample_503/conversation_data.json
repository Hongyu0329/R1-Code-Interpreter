    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is determined by a pair of objects, a pair of morphisms between them, and two 2-morphisms (unit and counit) satisfying the triangle identities. We are asked to find the number of such adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$ in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the 2-category structure of $\\Delta$**\n*   **Objects:** The objects are the finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$. We are interested in the objects $[23]$ and $[37]$.\n*   **Morphisms (1-cells):** A morphism $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a non-decreasing function.\n*   **2-morphisms (2-cells):** For two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ exists if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. Since this defines a partial order on the set of morphisms $\\text{Hom}([m], [n])$, this 2-category is \"locally posetal\".\n\n**Step 2: Define an internal adjunction in this context**\nAn internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of:\n*   A pair of morphisms (non-decreasing functions): $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$. In our case, $m=23$ and $n=37$.\n*   A pair of 2-morphisms: the unit $\\eta: \\text{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\text{id}_{[n]}$.\n\nThe existence of these 2-morphisms translates to the following pointwise inequalities:\n1.  **Unit:** $\\text{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (R \\circ L)(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$, which simplifies to $i \\le R(L(i))$.\n2.  **Counit:** $(L \\circ R)(j) \\le \\text{id}_{[n]}(j)$ for all $j \\in [n]$, which simplifies to $L(R(j)) \\le j$.\n\n(The triangle identities are automatically satisfied in any locally posetal 2-category).\n\n**Step 3: Recognize the structure as a poset adjunction**\nThe two conditions, $i \\le R(L(i))$ and $L(R(j)) \\le j$, for non-decreasing maps $L$ and $R$ between posets, are equivalent to the standard definition of a Galois connection (or poset adjunction), which is often stated as:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m], j \\in [n]$.\nHere, $L$ is the left adjoint and $R$ is the right adjoint, denoted $L \\dashv R$.\n\n**Step 4: Characterize adjoint maps between these specific posets**\nFor posets that are complete lattices (like $[k]$), a non-decreasing map is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins), and a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets).\n\n*   **Left Adjoint (L):** For $L: [m] \\to [n]$ to preserve all suprema, it must preserve the suprema of all subsets of $[m]$. A non-decreasing function on a chain automatically preserves suprema of non-empty sets. The crucial condition arises from the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element.\n    *   $\\sup(\\emptyset)$ in $[m]$ is $0$.\n    *   So, we need $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$. This means $L(0) = \\sup(\\emptyset) = 0$.\n    *   Thus, a non-decreasing map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $L(0) = 0$.\n\n*   **Right Adjoint (R):** For $R: [n] \\to [m]$ to preserve all infima, it must preserve the infima of all subsets of $[n]$. The crucial condition comes from the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element.\n    *   $\\inf(\\emptyset)$ in $[n]$ is $n$.\n    *   So, we need $R(\\inf(\\emptyset)) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset))$. This means $R(n) = \\inf(\\emptyset) = m$.\n    *   Thus, a non-decreasing map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint if and only if $R(n) = m$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of such adjoint maps**\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, the number of adjunctions is equal to the number of possible left adjoints $L: [23] \\to [37]$ or, equivalently, the number of possible right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. We can count either.\n\n**Method 1: Counting Right Adjoints**\nWe need to count the number of non-decreasing functions $R: [37] \\to [23]$ such that $R(37) = 23$.\nA non-decreasing function is defined by the sequence of its values, $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$. These values must satisfy:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\nThis means we need to choose the $37$ values for $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$, which contains $24$ elements. This is a problem of choosing $k=37$ items from a set of $n=24$ with replacement, where the order is fixed by the non-decreasing condition. This is a classic \"stars and bars\" or \"combinations with repetition\" problem.\nThe number of ways is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\n\n**Method 2: Counting Left Adjoints (Verification)**\nWe count the number of non-decreasing functions $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nThe function is defined by the values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$, which must satisfy:\n$0 = L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThis means we need to choose the $23$ values for $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which contains $38$ elements.\nHere, we choose $k=23$ items from a set of $n=38$ with replacement.\nThe number of ways is:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{N}{K} = \\binom{N}{N-K}$, we see that $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. Both methods yield the same result, confirming our reasoning.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<C(60, 23)>>>"
