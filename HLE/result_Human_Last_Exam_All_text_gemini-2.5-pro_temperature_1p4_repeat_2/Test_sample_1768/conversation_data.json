    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe task is to determine the correct reading frame for a given DNA sequence and translate it into a protein sequence. The key piece of information is that the sequence is from the *middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF)*. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain any stop codons. This means the correct reading frame will be the one that, when translated, results in a polypeptide chain without any premature stop signals.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Three Possible Reading Frames**\nA DNA sequence can be read in three different frames on the forward strand, depending on which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon.\n\nThe given sequence is: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide (`g`). The codons are grouped as `gga`, `cat`, `tgt`, etc.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide (`g`). The codons are grouped as `gac`, `att`, `gtt`, etc.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide (`a`). The codons are grouped as `aca`, `ttg`, `ttg`, etc.\n\n### **Step 3: Translate Each Frame and Scan for Stop Codons**\nWe will now translate each frame using the standard genetic code. The stop codons in DNA are `TAA`, `TAG`, and `TGA`. The presence of any of these codons indicates that the frame is likely incorrect, as the sequence is from the middle of an ORF.\n\n**Analysis of Frame 1:**\n*   Sequence (grouped into codons): `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `gga` -> G (Gly)\n    *   `cat` -> H (His)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tgt` -> C (Cys)\n    *   `tag` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 1:** This frame contains a stop codon (`tag`) very early on. It is not the correct ORF.\n\n**Analysis of Frame 3:**\n*   Sequence (grouped into codons): `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n*   Translation:\n    *   `aca` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leu)\n    *   `gcg` -> A (Ala)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lys)\n    *   `act` -> T (Thr)\n    *   `tga` -> **STOP**\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 3:** This frame also contains a stop codon (`tga`). It is not the correct ORF.\n\n**Analysis of Frame 2:**\n*   Sequence (grouped into codons): `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg c`\n*   Translation (using one-letter amino acid codes):\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n*   **Conclusion for Frame 2:** This entire translation proceeds without encountering any stop codons. This is consistent with the sequence being from the middle of an ORF.\n\n### **Step 4: Final Answer**\nThe correct reading frame is Frame 2. The resulting protein sequence is assembled from the translations in Step 3.\n\n*   **Frame:** 2\n*   **Protein Sequence:** DIVVSEDLNGTVEKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW\n\n<<<Frame: 2\nProtein sequence: DIVVSEDLNGTVEKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
