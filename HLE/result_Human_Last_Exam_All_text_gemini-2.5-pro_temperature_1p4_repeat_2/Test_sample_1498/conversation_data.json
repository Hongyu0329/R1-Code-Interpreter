    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Question:** The question asks for the specific range of verses (abyat, singular: bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam where the names of the prophets are listed.\n\n2.  **Identify the Poem and Author:** The poem is 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' (عقيدة العوام - The Creed of the Laymen), a well-known didactic poem on Islamic creed. The author is Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi al-Maliki.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Section:** The poem is structured to cover the main articles of faith. One of these articles is the belief in the prophets and messengers (Rusul). Within this section, the author lists the 25 prophets whose names are explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an and whose knowledge is considered obligatory for a Muslim.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Starting Verse:** We need to find the first verse that begins listing the names. Before the list, there are introductory verses about the prophets' attributes and their total number.\n    *   Bayt 36 states the number of prophets that are obligatory to know:\n        > وَتَفْصِيْلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُوْنَ لَزِمْ\n        >\n        > *Watabṣīluhum khamsatun wa 'ishrūna lazim*\n        >\n        > (And the details of them are twenty-five, which are necessary [to know]).\n    *   This verse states the *number* but does not *name* them. The actual listing of names begins in the very next verse.\n    *   Bayt 37 is the first verse that contains the names of prophets:\n        > هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدٌ مَعْ صَالِحْ\n        >\n        > *Hum Ādamun, Idrīsu, Nūḥun, Hūdun maʿa Ṣāliḥ*\n        >\n        > (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih).\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Ending Verse:** We need to follow the sequence of verses until the last prophet's name is mentioned.\n    *   Bayt 38 continues: Ibrahim, Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub.\n    *   Bayt 39 continues: Yusuf, Ayyub, Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa'.\n    *   Bayt 40 continues: Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, Sulayman.\n    *   Bayt 41 concludes the list of names:\n        > إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُsُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى فَعِيْسَى وَطَهَ\n        >\n        > *Ilyāsu, Yūnus, Zakariyyā, Yaḥyā fa-ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā*\n        >\n        > (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, then 'Isa and Taha).\n    *   The name \"Taha\" is a title for the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). The list of the 25 prophets concludes in this verse. The following verse (Bayt 42) refers to him again as \"Khatim\" (the Seal) but does not continue the list.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The enumeration of the prophets' names begins in Bayt 37 and concludes in Bayt 41. Therefore, the names are mentioned from Bayt 37 to Bayt 41, inclusive.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** The numbering of verses in classical texts can sometimes vary slightly between different printed editions or manuscripts. However, the range of 37-41 is the most standard and widely accepted numbering for this section.\n*   **Verse 36 vs. 37:** It is important to distinguish between the verse that states the *number* of prophets (Bayt 36) and the verses that list their *names* (starting from Bayt 37). The question specifically asks for where the names are mentioned.\n*   **The Name \"Taha\":** In Bayt 41, the author uses \"Taha\" (طه) to refer to Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). This is a common practice in Islamic poetry and literature, referencing the opening letters of the 20th chapter of the Qur'an.\n*   **Scope:** The range from Bayt 37 to 41 covers five full verses, and within these five verses, all 25 names are systematically listed.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\n*   **Start:** Bayt 37 (\"Hum Ādamun...\")\n*   **End:** Bayt 41 (\"...fa-ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā\")\n*   **Conclusion:** The names of the prophets in Islam are mentioned from Bayt 37 to Bayt 41 in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'.\n\n<<<From Bayt 37 to Bayt 41>>>"
