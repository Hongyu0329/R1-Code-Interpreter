    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nFirst, let's understand what the question is asking.\n*   **G is a graph**: It has a set of vertices and edges.\n*   **12345 vertices**: Let $n = |V(G)| = 12345$.\n*   **maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$**: This is a property of the graph G, which is the highest degree among all its vertices. The question just acknowledges its existence rather than placing a specific constraint on its value.\n*   **other than the complete graph**: This is a crucial constraint. The graph $G$ is not the complete graph on 12345 vertices, denoted as $K_{12345}$.\n*   **properly colour the vertices**: We need to assign a colour to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour.\n*   **maximum number of colours that we need**: This asks for the maximum possible value of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, over all possible graphs $G$ that satisfy the given conditions. The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colours required for a proper colouring of a specific graph $G$. The question wants us to find $\\max\\{\\chi(G)\\}$ for all valid graphs $G$.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the maximum chromatic number for any graph with 12345 vertices, provided it is not a complete graph.\n\n### Step 2: Establish an Upper Bound\n\nLet's find the maximum possible number of colours we might need.\nLet $n = 12345$.\nThe chromatic number of any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is at most $n$. That is, $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n\nThe question explicitly states that $G$ is *not* the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\nSince $G \\neq K_{12345}$, there must exist at least one pair of vertices, let's call them $u$ and $v$, that are not connected by an edge.\n\nWe can use this fact to find a proper colouring of $G$ with at most $n-1$ colours. Here is how:\n1.  Assign the same colour, say \"Colour 1\", to both vertices $u$ and $v$. This is a valid step because there is no edge between them.\n2.  For the remaining $n-2$ vertices in the graph, we can assign a unique colour to each one, from a set of new colours: \"Colour 2\", \"Colour 3\", ..., \"Colour n-1\".\n\nLet's check if this is a proper colouring:\n*   Vertices $u$ and $v$ have the same colour, but they are not adjacent, so this is fine.\n*   Any two vertices from the set of $n-2$ other vertices have different colours, so they can't clash.\n*   Any vertex from the set of $n-2$ vertices has a colour from {2, ..., n-1}, while $u$ and $v$ have colour 1. So, none of them can clash with $u$ or $v$.\n\nThis method successfully colours the graph using $1 + (n-2) = n-1$ colours.\nSince we have found a proper colouring with $n-1$ colours, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ (which is the *minimum* number of colours required) must be less than or equal to $n-1$.\n\nFor our specific case, $n = 12345$. So, for any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number satisfies:\n$\\chi(G) \\le 12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThis means the maximum number of colours we could possibly need is 12344.\n\n### Step 3: Show the Upper Bound is Attainable\n\nNow we need to confirm if this maximum value of 12344 can actually be achieved. To do this, we must construct a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n\nConsider the graph $G$ formed by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. Let this removed edge be $(u,v)$.\n*   **Number of vertices**: This graph has 12345 vertices.\n*   **Is it a complete graph?**: No, because the edge $(u,v)$ is missing.\n*   **What is its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$?**:\n    *   From Step 2, we know that since $G \\neq K_{12345}$, its chromatic number must be $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n    *   Now, let's find a lower bound. Consider the set of vertices $V' = V(G) \\setminus \\{v\\}$. This set has $12345 - 1 = 12344$ vertices. The subgraph induced by these vertices is a complete graph $K_{12344}$, because the only edge removed from the original $K_{12345}$ involved the vertex $v$, which is not in $V'$.\n    *   A graph that contains a $K_{12344}$ as a subgraph requires at least 12344 colours. This is because all 12344 vertices in that subgraph must have a unique colour. So, $\\chi(G) \\ge 12344$.\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds, we have $12344 \\le \\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\nThis means that for this specific graph $G = K_{12345} - e$, the chromatic number is exactly 12344.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWe have shown two things:\n1.  Any graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph can be coloured with at most 12344 colours.\n2.  There exists at least one such graph that requires exactly 12344 colours.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of colours needed is 12344.\n\nFinal check of careful points:\n*   The role of \"maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$\" was descriptive. Brooks' Theorem, which relates $\\chi(G)$ to $\\Delta(G)$, states $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$ for most graphs. For our example $G=K_{12345}-e$, $\\Delta(G)=12344$, so Brooks' Theorem gives $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$, consistent with our result.\n*   The argument holds for both connected and disconnected graphs. The constructed example $K_{12345}-e$ is connected. Another valid example would be a disconnected graph consisting of a complete graph $K_{12344}$ and an isolated vertex $K_1$. This graph also has $\\chi(G) = 12344$.\n*   The logic hinges on the property that a graph $G$ has $\\chi(G)=|V(G)|$ if and only if $G$ is a complete graph.\n\nThe analysis is sound.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
