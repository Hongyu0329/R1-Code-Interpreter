    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the integrand**\nThe integral is given by $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$.\nThe integrand is the infinite sum $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$.\nA crucial first step is to simplify this sum.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the sum using the properties of logarithms**\nThe sum of logarithms can be expressed as the logarithm of a product:\n$$ f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\nThis step requires that the product inside the logarithm converges. We will evaluate this product.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the infinite product**\nLet $P(x) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}$.\nWe use the double angle identity for sine, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$, which can be rearranged to $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2\\sin\\theta}$.\nLet's examine the partial product $P_N(x) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}$.\n$$ P_N(x) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{8}\\right) \\cdots \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) $$\nApplying the identity to each term:\n$$ P_N(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{2\\sin(x/2)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sin(x/2)}{2\\sin(x/4)}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sin(x/4)}{2\\sin(x/8)}\\right) \\cdots \\left(\\frac{\\sin(x/2^{N-1})}{2\\sin(x/2^N)}\\right) $$\nThis is a telescoping product. Most terms in the numerator cancel with terms in the denominator of the preceding factor.\n$$ P_N(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\nNow, we take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$ to find the value of the infinite product $P(x)$.\n$$ P(x) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} P_N(x) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\nTo evaluate the limit in the denominator, let $u = x/2^N$. As $N \\to \\infty$, $u \\to 0$.\n$$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} 2^N \\sin(x/2^N) = \\lim_{u\\to 0} \\frac{x}{u}\\sin u = x \\lim_{u\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin u}{u} = x \\cdot 1 = x $$\n(This assumes $x \\neq 0$. If $x=0$, the integrand is 0 from the start).\nSo, the infinite product is:\n$$ P(x) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute the simplified sum back into the integral**\nThe integrand simplifies to $f(x) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate the definite integral**\nThe integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$ is a well-known result in mathematical analysis, often referred to as Schl√∂milch's integral.\n\n**Careful Point:** For certain values of $x$ in the integration interval $(0, \\infty)$, the term $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$ is negative (e.g., for $x \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$). For a real-valued integral, the logarithm of a negative number is undefined. However, the problem is typically understood in the context of a principal value or as a result from complex analysis where the identity $\\sum \\log(z_n) = \\log(\\prod z_n)$ holds for the principal branch of the logarithm under certain conditions. The standard evaluation of this integral yields a real value, which suggests that this is the intended interpretation.\n\nThe value of this definite integral is a standard result:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nThis result can be derived using various advanced techniques, such as contour integration in the complex plane, differentiation under the integral sign on a related function, or using Fourier series methods. For the purpose of solving this problem, we rely on this known value.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe initial sum simplifies to the logarithm of the sinc function, $\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)$. The definite integral of this function from $0$ to $\\infty$ is a standard result, equal to $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The value of the integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$."
