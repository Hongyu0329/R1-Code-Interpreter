    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe query asks for a specific film with four key elements:\n1.  It must be an **Oscar-nominated film**.\n2.  A character **seals his fate**. This implies a pivotal, often fatal, outcome is set in motion.\n3.  The specific action is **saying \"Thank you\"**.\n4.  The setting for this action is **while boarding a bus**.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\nSeveral films feature fateful moments or key bus scenes, but we must check if they meet all four criteria.\n*   ***Inglourious Basterds***: Oscar-nominated. A character's fate is sealed by a giveaway (the \"three glasses\" hand gesture). However, this occurs in a tavern, not on a bus, and the dialogue isn't \"Thank you.\"\n*   ***Collateral***: Oscar-nominated. It features a story about a jazz musician on a bus, but this is a story told by one character to another; it doesn't happen in the film's present action.\n*   ***No Country for Old Men***: Oscar-nominated. It features tense, fateful encounters and scenes with buses, but none involve a character sealing their fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding one.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Correct Film**\nThe film that matches all the specific details is Steven Spielberg's **Munich** (2005).\n\n**Step 4: Careful Analysis of the Scene in *Munich***\n1.  **Oscar Nomination:** *Munich* was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, fulfilling the first criterion.\n2.  **The Character and Context:** The scene involves a Mossad team tasked with assassinating Palestinian militants responsible for the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre. One of their targets is Zaiad Muchasi.\n3.  **The Scene on the Bus:** The team tracks Muchasi to a bus stop in Athens. Their plan is to detonate a bomb as he boards.\n4.  **The \"Thank You\" Moment:** Muchasi has a brief, pleasant chat with a stranger while waiting. As he steps onto the bus, he turns and politely says, **\"Thank you.\"** At the same moment, his young daughter also runs onto the bus to join him.\n5.  **Sealing His Fate:** The Mossad agent responsible for detonation, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), hears the polite phrase and sees the innocent child. This humanizing moment makes him hesitate, and he is unable to detonate the bomb. The mission is aborted. While this act of politeness paradoxically saves his life in that instant, it only delays his death. The team is still committed to killing him. They re-plan the assassination and succeed later by planting a bomb in his hotel room. Therefore, the bus incident was a crucial event that confirmed the target but altered the method of his eventual assassination, thus \"sealing his fate\" to be killed at a later time and in a different manner.\n\n<<<Munich>>>"
