    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific physicist based on several key pieces of information:\n    *   The physicist is primarily known for their work in **microscopy**.\n    *   They discovered an **optical effect** related to **real imagery**.\n    *   The discovery was prompted by an accidental observation made by a **custodial worker**.\n    *   The context of the observation was the **cleaning of concave mirrors**.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **\"Physicist better known for work in the microscopy field\"**: This narrows the search to figures who made significant contributions to the design or theory of microscopes. Candidates could include Ernst Abbe, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, or Frits Zernike.\n    *   **\"Discovered an optical effect in real imagery\"**: This points to a discovery in fundamental optics. Real images are formed by converging light rays, such as those from a concave mirror or a projector lens. The effect in question allows for visualizing things that are normally hard to see.\n    *   **\"Accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors\"**: This is the most specific and unusual clue. It describes a historical anecdote connected to the discovery. The anecdote involves someone seeing something unexpected while polishing a mirror. This \"something\" was likely subtle imperfections, like scratches or residue, that became visible under certain conditions.\n\n3.  **Synthesizing the Clues:** The combination of \"microscopy\" and the specific \"custodian cleaning a mirror\" story strongly points to the discovery of the **phase-contrast method**.\n\n    *   The story goes that the physicist was inspired by (or used as an analogy) the observation that a person polishing a concave telescope mirror could see faint scratches and imperfections on its surface.\n    *   These scratches are \"phase objects\"â€”they don't block light (change its amplitude) but instead slightly delay the light that reflects off them (change its phase).\n    *   The human eye cannot perceive these phase shifts, so the scratches are normally invisible. However, the combination of light scattered by the scratches and light reflected directly from the mirror surface can interfere, making the scratches visible under specific lighting and viewing conditions.\n    *   This phenomenon led the physicist to develop a method to systematically convert these invisible phase shifts into visible changes in brightness (amplitude). This invention was the **phase-contrast microscope**.\n\n4.  **Identifying the Physicist:** The physicist who invented the phase-contrast microscope and for whom this discovery story is told is **Frits Zernike**.\n\n    *   He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for this invention.\n    *   His work revolutionized microscopy, especially in biology, as it allowed scientists to view unstained, living cells for the first time.\n    *   The anecdote about the observation on a concave mirror perfectly aligns with the optical principles behind his discovery.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Anecdotal Evidence:** While the story about the custodial worker is widely associated with Zernike's discovery, it is sometimes considered apocryphal or an illustrative simplification. However, it serves as the key identifying element in the question.\n*   **Field Connection:** It's crucial to connect the work with concave mirrors (often used in telescopes and spectroscopy, which Zernike was also working on) to his most famous work in microscopy. The underlying optical principle is the same.\n*   **Real Imagery:** The concave mirror forms a real image, and the principle of phase contrast is applied in imaging systems (microscopes) to form a final, visible image.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The key phrase is \"custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors.\" A search for this story in the context of physics and optics leads to the discovery of phase contrast.\n2.  The discoverer of phase contrast is identified as Frits Zernike.\n3.  We verify that Zernike fits all other criteria: he is a physicist famed for his work in microscopy (the phase-contrast microscope), and his discovery is a fundamental optical effect.\n4.  Therefore, the physicist in question is Frits Zernike.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
