    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given protein sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by α-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-residue pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted by the positions `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the amino acids at the core positions, `a` and `d`. These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues.\n\nLet's align the given sequence, `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, to identify this pattern. We are looking for a repeating sequence where positions `a` and `d` are hydrophobic (e.g., I, L, V, A, W, F).\n\nIf we assign the first Isoleucine (I) to the `a` position, we can establish the heptad repeat pattern for the entire sequence:\n\n```\nSequence:   G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G\nPosition:       a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g\n```\n*(Note: The flanking G, E, K, G residues are not part of the core repeating unit but are included for context).*\n\nLet's list the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions based on this alignment:\n*   **Position `a` residues:** I, I, I, I\n*   **Position `d` residues:** A, A, W, A\n\nThis alignment is highly characteristic of a coiled-coil, with the core `a` and `d` positions consistently filled by hydrophobic amino acids.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Core Residues for Knobs-into-Holes Packing\n\nThe \"knobs-into-holes\" model describes how the side chains (knobs) from one helix pack into cavities (holes) formed by the side chains of the adjacent helix/helices. The size, shape, and chemical nature of the residues at the `a` and `d` positions dictate the most efficient packing arrangement and, therefore, the oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Dimer (2-helix bundle):** Typically has bulky hydrophobic residues at both `a` and `d` positions (e.g., Leucine). The core packing involves interactions between the `a` position of one helix and the `d` position of the other (`a-d'` packing). In our sequence, this would mean Isoleucine (I) packing against Alanine (A). This is an inefficient pairing due to the significant size mismatch (I is large and β-branched, A is very small), which would leave empty space (a packing defect) in the core.\n\n*   **Trimer (3-helix bundle):** Often features a specific arrangement where one core position is occupied by a bulky, β-branched amino acid (like Isoleucine or Valine) and the other is occupied by a smaller residue. In our sequence, the `a` positions are all Isoleucine (I), and the `d` positions are predominantly Alanine (A).\n    *   **Isoleucine at position `a`:** The bulky, β-branched nature of Isoleucine fits exceptionally well into the `a` position of a trimeric structure. The three `I` side chains can interlock efficiently in the core.\n    *   **Alanine at position `d`:** The small size of Alanine at the `d` position complements the bulky `I` at the `a` position. It allows the helices to pack closely together without the steric clashes that would be caused by another bulky residue.\n    This pattern of a β-branched residue at `a` and a small residue at `d` is a strong, classic indicator of a trimeric coiled-coil. The single Tryptophan (W) at one `d` position is very large, but three tryptophans can pack favorably in a single layer of a trimeric core, and its presence does not invalidate the strong signal from the three other repeating `I-A` pairs.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4-helix bundle):** Packing four bulky, β-branched Isoleucine residues together at the `a` position would create significant steric hindrance and unfavorable packing. This makes a tetrameric state highly unlikely. Tetramers usually have different packing patterns, often with alternating layers of different residue types at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\n### Step 3: Conclude the Oligomeric State\n\nBased on the analysis of the core residues and the principles of knobs-into-holes packing:\n1.  The sequence shows a clear heptad repeat with **Isoleucine (I) at the `a` positions** and **Alanine (A) at the `d` positions**.\n2.  This specific pattern maximizes packing efficiency and minimizes steric clashes in a **3-helix (trimeric)** arrangement.\n3.  Other oligomeric states, like a dimer or tetramer, would result in inefficient or sterically hindered core packing.\n\nTherefore, the protein would most likely form a trimeric coiled-coil.\n\nThe oligomeric state would be **3**.\n\n<<<B>>>"
