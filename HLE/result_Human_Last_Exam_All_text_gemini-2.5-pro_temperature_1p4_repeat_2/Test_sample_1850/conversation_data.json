    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: In the context of John Milton, a devout Protestant, this term should not be limited to officially canonized saints of the Catholic Church. A more appropriate definition is any revered, holy human figure from the Old or New Testament. This includes patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and other righteous individuals. Divine beings (God, the Son) and celestial beings (angels) are excluded.\n*   **\"Mentioned by Name\"**: The figure must be explicitly named in the text. Mere allusions to their stories or titles (like \"that Shepherd\" for Moses or \"the Danite strong\" for Samson) are not sufficient.\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: This includes the entirety of the published work, which consists of both the epic poem's verse and the prose \"Arguments\" that preface each book, as these were written by Milton himself.\n\n### Step 2: Systematic Search and Verification\n\nWe will now systematically search the text of *Paradise Lost* for biblical figures who fit our definition, verifying each one.\n\n#### Old Testament Figures\n\n1.  **Adam**: The main human protagonist. Mentioned by name throughout the poem. (Count: 1)\n2.  **Eve**: The other main human protagonist. Mentioned by name throughout the poem. (Count: 2)\n3.  **Abel**: His story is shown to Adam by Michael in Book XI, but he is referred to as \"his righteous Brother\" and \"that meek man,\" not by name. **Not counted.**\n4.  **Enoch**: His story of being taken to Heaven is told in Book XI, but he is referred to as \"the sev'nth from thee\" and is not explicitly named in the verse. **Not counted.**\n5.  **Noah**: He is explicitly named in the prose Argument to Book XI: \"...The Ark is seen, and in it **Noah** with his family.\" (Count: 3)\n6.  **Abraham**: Michael mentions him by name in his prophecy to Adam. In Book XII, line 149 (line number may vary by edition), the text reads: \"**Abraham**, and his Seed...\". (Count: 4)\n7.  **Isaac**: He is alluded to as Abraham's \"Son,\" but he is never mentioned by name. **Not counted.**\n8.  **Jacob**: He is mentioned by name in Book III, describing the vision of his ladder: \"The Stairs were such as whereon **Jacob** saw / Angels ascending and descending...\" (Book III, lines 510-511). (Count: 5)\n9.  **Moses**: He is alluded to as \"that Shepherd\" in Book I. His name appears explicitly in the Argument to Book I: \"...and prays for aid to the Holy Ghost, who inspired **Moses** and the Prophets.\" (Count: 6)\n10. **Solomon**: He is mentioned by name in the catalogue of demons in Book I. The demon Moloch is described as the one who \"the wisest heart / Of **Solomon** he led by fraud to build / His Temple right against the Temple of God...\" (Book I, lines 442-444). Although mentioned for his failing, he is a historical \"saint\" figure. (Count: 7)\n11. **David**: He is alluded to, but not directly named as a person. The title \"Son of David\" is used for the Messiah in Book XII, but this is a title for Jesus, not a direct mention of David himself. **Not counted.**\n\n#### New Testament Figures\n\n12. **Mary, Mother of Jesus**: She is described in Book XII as \"a Virgin,\" but her name is not used. **Not counted.**\n13. **John the Baptist**: He is described as \"a Prophet sent / Before to annunciate his coming,\" but he is not named. **Not counted.**\n14. **Peter**: He is mentioned by name in Book III's description of the Limbo of Vanity, in a satirical reference to Catholic belief: \"And now Saint **Peter** at Heav'ns Wicket seems / To wait them with his Keys...\" (Book III, lines 484-485). (Count: 8)\n\n### Step 3: Final Tally and Conclusion\n\nLet's list the confirmed names that fit our criteria:\n\n1.  **Adam** (mentioned in the verse)\n2.  **Eve** (mentioned in the verse)\n3.  **Noah** (mentioned in the Argument to Book XI)\n4.  **Abraham** (mentioned in the verse)\n5.  **Jacob** (mentioned in the verse)\n6.  **Moses** (mentioned in the Argument to Book I)\n7.  **Solomon** (mentioned in the verse)\n8.  **Peter** (mentioned in the verse)\n\nFigures like Esau and Nimrod are also named but are not \"saints\" and are therefore excluded from the final count. Based on this careful analysis, there are a total of 8 historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*.\n\n<<<8>>>"
