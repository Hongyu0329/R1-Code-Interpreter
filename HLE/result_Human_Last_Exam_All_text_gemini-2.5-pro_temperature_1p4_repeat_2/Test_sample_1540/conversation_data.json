    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective:** The main goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. The strings are guaranteed to be of the same length.\n2.  **Input:** Two lines of input, each containing one string. String lengths are between 1 and 100. The strings consist only of Latin letters.\n3.  **Output:**\n    *   Print \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   Print \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   Print \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n4.  **Comparison Logic:** The comparison must be case-insensitive. This means that for any character comparison between the two strings, `c1` and `c2`, we should compare their lowercase (or uppercase) versions. For example, `tolower(c1)` should be compared with `tolower(c2)`. The comparison proceeds character by character from left to right. The first position where the characters differ determines the lexicographical order of the strings. If all characters are the same, the strings are equal.\n\n### Careful Points for Memory Efficiency\n\n1.  **Storing Strings:** A standard C program would declare two character arrays (buffers) to store both strings, for example, `char s1[101], s2[101];`. However, to be maximally memory-efficient, we should question if storing both strings is necessary.\n2.  **Input Stream Handling:** The input consists of `string1`, followed by a newline character (`\\n`), followed by `string2`. Because of this structure, we cannot read one character from `string1` and one from `string2` alternately. We must process all of `string1` (or at least read it from the input stream) before we can access the first character of `string2`.\n3.  **Optimal Storage Strategy:** This implies that we must store at least one of the strings in memory. The most memory-efficient approach is to store only the first string in a buffer. Then, we can iterate through this stored string, and for each character, read the corresponding character of the second string directly from the input stream for a live comparison. This avoids allocating a second buffer for the second string.\n4.  **Variable Sizing:** To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible data type for each variable that can safely hold the required range of values.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-step Memory Calculation\n\nLet's design the most memory-efficient C program conceptually and calculate the total memory (`m`) used for its variables.\n\n1.  **Buffer for the First String:**\n    *   The maximum string length is 100 characters. In C, a string read by functions like `scanf` needs an additional byte for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   Therefore, we need a buffer of size 101. We declare `char s1[101];`.\n    *   Memory used: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Loop Index Variable:**\n    *   We need an index to iterate through the `s1` buffer. This index will range from 0 to at most 99.\n    *   The smallest standard data type that can hold values from 0 to 99 is `char` (which can hold values from 0 to 127 or more, and is 1 byte).\n    *   We can declare `char i;`.\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Variable for Second String's Character:**\n    *   We will read characters from the second string one at a time using `getchar()`.\n    *   The `getchar()` function returns an `int`, not a `char`. This is crucial because it needs to be able to return the special value `EOF` (End of File), which may not be representable by a `char`. To correctly handle all possible inputs, we must store the return value in an `int`.\n    *   We declare `int c2;`. On most common competitive programming platforms, an `int` takes 4 bytes.\n    *   Memory used: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n4.  **Result Variable:**\n    *   A lean implementation can avoid a separate result variable. Once a difference is found (e.g., `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)`), we can immediately print `-1` and exit the program (`return 0;`). If the loop finishes without finding a difference, we then print `0`. This eliminates the need for a variable like `int result;`.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation:**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all necessary variables:\n\n*   Memory for `s1` buffer: 101 bytes\n*   Memory for index `i`: 1 byte\n*   Memory for character `c2`: 4 bytes\n\nm = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106 bytes.\n\nThis represents the minimal memory required for variables in a robust C program that correctly solves the problem under the given constraints.\n\n<<<106>>>"
