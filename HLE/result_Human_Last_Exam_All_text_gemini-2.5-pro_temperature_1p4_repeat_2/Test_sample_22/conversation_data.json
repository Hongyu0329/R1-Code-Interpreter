    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the key terms:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, risk for a disease) that is explained by the additive effects of *all* the common genetic variants (SNPs) considered together. It is an estimate of the *total* genetic signal present in the SNPs and represents the theoretical **upper limit** of predictive power that can be achieved using these SNPs. It is a property of a population, assuming we knew the true effects of every SNP.\n    *   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** This is a practical tool. It is a single score calculated for an individual to predict their phenotype. The score is typically a weighted sum of the individual's genotypes at many SNPs.\n    *   **Predictive ability of a PGS:** This is measured by how well the PGS predicts the phenotype in a *new, independent* set of individuals (i.e., individuals not used to create the score). A common metric for this is the R-squared (R²), which is the proportion of variance in the phenotype that the PGS can explain.\n\n2.  **Compare the nature of the two concepts:**\n    *   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP)** is the *target*. It's the total amount of variance that is theoretically available to be explained by SNPs.\n    *   **PGS predictive ability (R²)** is the *achievement*. It's the amount of variance that a specific predictive model (the PGS) actually manages to explain in practice.\n\n3.  **Identify why the achievement (PGS R²) would be lower than the target (h²_SNP):**\n    *   **Imperfect information:** The weights used in a PGS are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Because any GWAS has a finite sample size, these estimated weights are not the true, precise effect sizes of the SNPs; they contain statistical error. A model built on noisy estimates will be less accurate than a theoretical model built on perfect, true values.\n    *   **Finite GWAS Sample Size:** This is the primary reason. The larger the GWAS used to derive the weights, the more accurate they will be, and the higher the R² of the resulting PGS can be. However, even the largest GWAS is finite, so some error will always remain. To achieve an R² equal to h²_SNP, one would theoretically need a GWAS with an infinite sample size.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWASs often identify SNPs that are merely correlated with the true causal SNPs, not the causal SNPs themselves. The methods used to handle this complex correlation structure (e.g., LD clumping and thresholding, or more advanced methods like LDpred) are imperfect and lead to a loss of information and predictive power.\n    *   **Population differences:** A PGS is often developed in one population (e.g., individuals of European ancestry) and applied to another. Differences in genetic ancestry and LD patterns between the development and application samples can reduce the accuracy of the PGS.\n\n4.  **Conclusion of the comparison:**\n    *   The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) sets the ceiling for prediction. The predictive ability (R²) of any real-world PGS must be less than or equal to this ceiling.\n    *   Because of the practical and statistical limitations described above (especially the finite sample size of the GWAS), the predictive ability of a PGS will inevitably fall short of this theoretical ceiling. In any non-trivial case where h²_SNP is greater than zero, the PGS R² will be strictly lower.\n\nTherefore, the statement that the predictive ability of a PGS is **necessarily lower** than the SNP heritability is correct.\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nTrue\n<<<True>>>"
