    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two individuals.\n*   **What:** They are Nobel laureates.\n*   **Where:** Featured in an infamous commercial for Enron.\n*   **When:** The commercial was from the year 2000.\n*   **Why (the tagline):** The commercial's tagline was \"Ask Why\".\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the \"Enron\" and \"Ask Why\" context**\nEnron was an American energy company that collapsed in late 2001 due to a massive accounting fraud scandal. A 2000 commercial, just before the collapse, would be considered \"infamous\" due to the dramatic irony. The tagline \"Ask Why\" is particularly ironic because if one had asked \"why\" about Enron's seemingly miraculous profits, the fraud might have been uncovered sooner. The company was essentially encouraging the very scrutiny it could not withstand.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the featured individuals**\nThe \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major advertising effort by Enron to rebrand itself as a modern, innovative, and intellectual company, moving beyond just energy trading. To lend credibility to this image, they featured prominent thinkers. Research into this specific campaign reveals that two economists were featured in one of the most well-known spots.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the first Nobel laureate**\nThe first economist featured was **Paul Krugman**.\n*   **Careful Point:** At the time the commercial was made in 2000, Paul Krugman was a renowned professor of economics at MIT, but he had not yet won the Nobel Prize. He was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008. However, since he *is* now a Nobel laureate, he fits the criteria of the question. He has since expressed regret for appearing in the commercial.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the second Nobel laureate**\nThe second economist featured was **Myron Scholes**.\n*   **Careful Point:** Myron Scholes had already received his Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 (shared with Robert C. Merton) for developing the Black-Scholes model for pricing derivatives. Therefore, he was a Nobel laureate at the time the commercial aired. Another point of irony is that Scholes was also famously a partner in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), which itself collapsed dramatically in 1998, just two years before this commercial was made.\n\n**Step 6: Final Confirmation**\nThe two individuals who fit the description of \"Nobel laureates\" (one at the time, one future) featured in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercial are indeed Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"
