    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Factor the conductor `d`**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n- $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n- Testing small prime factors:\n  - $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n  - $7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n  - $589 \\div 19 = 31$\n- 31 is a prime number.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n**Careful Point 1:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer. This simplifies the conditions for a character to be primitive.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Primitive Dirichlet Characters for a Square-Free Conductor**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free integer $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i$.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ is **primitive** if and only if none of the component characters $\\chi_i$ are the principal character. The principal character is the character of order 1.\n**Careful Point 2:** For our character $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$ to be primitive, each component character $\\chi_p$ must be non-principal, which means its order must be greater than 1.\n\n**Step 3: Understand the Order of a Product Character**\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_r$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$\n\nWe are looking for characters of order 6. So we must have:\n$\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\nThis implies that the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be a divisor of 6. The divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}. Combining this with the primitivity condition (order > 1), the possible orders for each component $\\chi_p$ are {2, 3, 6}.\n\n**Step 4: Count the Available Component Characters**\n\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check this condition for our primes and the required orders {2, 3, 6}:\n- For $p=7$: $\\phi(7) = 6$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 6, characters of these orders exist.\n- For $p=13$: $\\phi(13) = 12$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 12, characters of these orders exist.\n- For $p=19$: $\\phi(19) = 18$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 18, characters of these orders exist.\n- For $p=31$: $\\phi(31) = 30$. Since 2, 3, and 6 all divide 30, characters of these orders exist.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** For every prime factor $p$ of $d$, characters of the required orders {2, 3, 6} actually exist.\n\nNow, we count the number of characters for each required order:\n- Number of characters of order 2: $n(2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n- Number of characters of order 3: $n(3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n- Number of characters of order 6: $n(6) = \\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each of the four primes ($7, 13, 19, 31$), there is 1 character of order 2, 2 characters of order 3, and 2 characters of order 6.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Tuples of Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion**\n\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of primitive characters with an order that divides $k$.\nThe number of characters with order exactly 6 can be found using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion on the divisors of 6:\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$.\n\n-   **Calculate N(6):** Number of primitive characters with order dividing 6.\n    The order of each component $\\chi_p$ must be in {2, 3, 6}.\n    For each prime $p$, the number of choices for $\\chi_p$ is $n(2) + n(3) + n(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are 4 components, $N(6) = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n-   **Calculate N(3):** Number of primitive characters with order dividing 3.\n    The order of each component $\\chi_p$ must be in {3} (since order > 1).\n    For each prime $p$, the number of choices for $\\chi_p$ is $n(3) = 2$.\n    $N(3) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\n-   **Calculate N(2):** Number of primitive characters with order dividing 2.\n    The order of each component $\\chi_p$ must be in {2} (since order > 1).\n    For each prime $p$, the number of choices for $\\chi_p$ is $n(2) = 1$.\n    $N(2) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n\n-   **Calculate N(1):** Number of primitive characters with order dividing 1.\n    The order of each component $\\chi_p$ must be 1. This would mean they are all principal characters, which violates the condition for a primitive character.\n    $N(1) = 0$.\n\n**Careful Point 4:** The inclusion-exclusion principle is an efficient and systematic way to count elements of a specific order in a product structure.\n\n**Step 6: Final Calculation**\n\nUsing the values from Step 5, we can calculate the final number:\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $N(6) - N(3) - N(2) + N(1)$\nNumber = $625 - 16 - 1 + 0 = 608$.\n\nThus, there are 608 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6.\n\n<<<608>>>"
