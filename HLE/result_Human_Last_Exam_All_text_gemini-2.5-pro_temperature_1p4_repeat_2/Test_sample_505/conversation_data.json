    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Code Encoding\n\n*   **Surface Code:** A type of topological quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D surface.\n*   **Logical Qubit:** A single unit of quantum information (a qubit) that is encoded across many physical qubits to protect it from errors.\n*   **Patch:** A distinct, separate area of a surface code lattice. A standard, simple rectangular patch with no defects (holes) can encode **one** logical qubit. The logical operators for this qubit are defined by strings of Pauli operators connecting the opposite outer boundaries of the patch.\n*   **Hole:** A defect created within a patch, typically by disabling some stabilizer measurements. Holes act as internal boundaries and alter the topology of the code, which allows for the encoding of additional logical qubits.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Rule for a Single Patch\n\nFor a single, connected, planar patch of surface code, the number of logical qubits it can encode ($k$) depends on the number of holes ($h$) it contains.\n*   The patch itself, with its outer boundaries, provides the capacity for **1** logical qubit.\n*   Each hole introduced into the patch adds the capacity for **1** additional logical qubit.\n*   Therefore, the formula for a single patch is:\n    $k = h + 1$\n    (where $k$ is the number of logical qubits and $h$ is the number of holes).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate the Rule for Multiple Patches\n\nWhen there are multiple, physically separate patches of surface code, they act as independent systems. The total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each individual patch.\n*   $k_{total} = k_{patch1} + k_{patch2} + ...$\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Rules to the Specific Problem\n\nWe are given:\n*   Total number of patches = 2\n*   Total number of holes = 2\n\nWe need to find the **maximum** number of total logical qubits. To do this, we must consider all possible ways to distribute the 2 holes between the 2 patches.\n\n### Step 5: Analyze All Possible Distributions\n\nThere are two distinct ways to distribute the 2 holes:\n\n**Distribution A: Both holes in one patch.**\n*   **Patch 1:** Has 2 holes ($h_1 = 2$).\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = h_1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n*   **Patch 2:** Has 0 holes ($h_2 = 0$).\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = h_2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n*   **Total Logical Qubits for Distribution A:** $k_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Distribution B: One hole in each patch.**\n*   **Patch 1:** Has 1 hole ($h_1 = 1$).\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 1: $k_1 = h_1 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   **Patch 2:** Has 1 hole ($h_2 = 1$).\n    *   Number of logical qubits in Patch 2: $k_2 = h_2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n*   **Total Logical Qubits for Distribution B:** $k_{total} = k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Maximum Value\n\nBy analyzing all possible distributions, we find that the total number of logical qubits is 4 in every case. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
