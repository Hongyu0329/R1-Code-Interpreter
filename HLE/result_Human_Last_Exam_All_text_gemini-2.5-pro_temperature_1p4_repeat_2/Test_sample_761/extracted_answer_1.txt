No. Polynucleotides and polysaccharides are fundamentally different classes of macromolecules with distinct structures. The primary reasons are:
1.  **Different Monomers:** The repeating monomer of a polysaccharide is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar). The repeating monomer of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide, which is a more complex unit composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
2.  **Different Linkages:** The monomers in a polysaccharide are joined by glycosidic bonds. The monomers in a polynucleotide are joined by phosphodiester bonds.
3.  **Different Backbones:** A polysaccharide consists of a backbone made entirely of linked sugar units. A polynucleotide has a characteristic sugar-phosphate backbone, where sugar and phosphate groups alternate.
While both contain sugar moieties, their overall composition, monomeric units, and the chemical bonds that form the polymer chain are fundamentally different.
