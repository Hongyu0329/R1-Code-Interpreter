    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by the final answer.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Recurrence Relation:**\n    The sequence is defined by $a_0=1,~a_1=a_2=0,~a_3=88$ and the linear recurrence relation $a_{n}=88a_{n-3}+57a_{n-4}$ for $n\\geq 4$.\n    The characteristic equation of this recurrence is $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Factor the Characteristic Polynomial:**\n    The sum of the roots is 0, so the polynomial can be factored in the form $(r^2-ar+b)(r^2+ar+d)$.\n    Expanding this product gives $r^4 + (b+d-a^2)r^2 + a(d-b)r + bd$.\n    Comparing the coefficients with $r^4 - 88r - 57 = 0$:\n    *   $r^3$: $0=0$\n    *   $r^2$: $b+d-a^2=0$\n    *   $r$: $a(d-b)=-88$\n    *   const: $bd=-57$\n    From these equations, we can derive an equation for $a^2$. Let $x=a^2$. This leads to the cubic equation $x^3+228x-7744=0$. By testing integer divisors of $7744=88^2$, we find that $x=16$ is a root.\n    Since $a^2=16$, we can take $a=4$.\n    Solving for $b$ and $d$: $d+b=16$ and $d-b=-88/4=-22$. This gives $d=-3$ and $b=19$.\n    This seems to be a mismatch since $bd = (19)(-3) = -57$. Let's check the coefficients again:\n    $r$: $a(d-b) = 4(-3-19) = -88$. Correct.\n    $r^2$: $b+d-a^2 = 19-3-16 = 0$. Correct.\n    The factorization must be $(r^2-4r+19)(r^2+4r-3)$. Let's check:\n    $(r^2-4r+19)(r^2+4r-3) = r^4+4r^3-3r^2 -4r^3-16r^2+12r +19r^2+76r-57 = r^4+88r-57$. Incorrect sign for the $r$ term.\n\n    Let's use the other choice for the sign of $a(d-b)r$. $(r^2 - ar + b)(r^2 + ar + d)$ gives $a(d-b)r$. So $a(d-b) = -88$. Let $a=4$. Then $d-b = -22$. $b+d = a^2=16$. This gives $d=-3, b=19$. The factors are $(r^2 - 4r + 19)(r^2 + 4r - 3)$. The product is $r^4+88r-57$. Still not correct.\n\n    Let's use $(r^2+ar+b)(r^2-ar+d)$, coeff of $r$ is $a(d-b)$. Let $a=4$. $d-b = -22$. $b+d=16 \\implies d=-3, b=19$.\n    The factorization is $(r^2+4r+19)(r^2-4r-3)=r^4-4r^3-3r^2+4r^3-16r^2-12r+19r^2-76r-57 = r^4-88r-57$. This is correct.\n\n3.  **Find the Roots:**\n    The roots are found by solving the two quadratic equations:\n    *   $r^2-4r-3=0 \\implies r = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(-3)}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{7}$.\n    *   $r^2+4r+19=0 \\implies r = \\frac{-4 \\pm \\sqrt{16-4(19)}}{2} = -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{15}$.\n    Let the roots be $r_1=2+\\sqrt{7}$, $r_2=2-\\sqrt{7}$, $r_3=-2+i\\sqrt{15}$, $r_4=-2-i\\sqrt{15}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Dominant Root:**\n    We calculate the magnitudes of the roots:\n    *   $|r_1| = 2+\\sqrt{7} \\approx 2+2.6458 = 4.6458$\n    *   $|r_2| = |2-\\sqrt{7}| = \\sqrt{7}-2 \\approx 0.6458$\n    *   $|r_3| = |r_4| = \\sqrt{(-2)^2+(\\sqrt{15})^2} = \\sqrt{4+15} = \\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.3589$\n    The dominant root (the one with the largest magnitude) is $r_1=2+\\sqrt{7}$.\n    For large $n$, the sequence behaves as $a_n \\sim A_1 r_1^n$ for some constant $A_1$. We can show that $A_1>0$, which is consistent with $a_n \\ge 0$ for all $n$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Sum $s_n$:**\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n} V_k - \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} U_k$, where $V_k = a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51}$ and $U_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$.\n    Let's analyze the asymptotic behavior of the terms.\n    *   For large $k$, $V_k$ is dominated by its first term: $V_k \\sim a_{2k-3} \\sim A_1 r_1^{2k-3}$.\n    *   For large $k$, $U_k$ is a sum of products. It's dominated by terms like $a_{k+3}a_{k-4} \\sim (A_1r_1^{k+3})(A_1r_1^{k-4}) = A_1^2 r_1^{2k-1}$.\n    A more detailed analysis shows that $U_k \\sim r_1^2 a_{2k-3}$.\n    This means that in the expression for $s_n$, the main term of $V_k$ and $U_k$ approximately cancel out.\n    $s_n = V_n + \\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} (V_k - U_k)$.\n    $V_k - U_k \\approx a_{2k-3} - r_1^2 a_{2k-3} = (1-r_1^2)a_{2k-3}$.\n    The sum $\\sum (V_k - U_k)$ is dominated by its last term, which is approximately $(1-r_1^2)a_{2(n-1)-3} = (1-r_1^2)a_{2n-5}$.\n    So, $s_n \\approx V_n + \\frac{\\text{last term} \\times \\text{ratio}}{\\text{ratio}-1} \\approx a_{2n-3} + (1-r_1^2)a_{2n-5}\\frac{r_1^2}{r_1^2-1} \\approx A_1r_1^{2n-3} - A_1r_1^{2n-3}$.\n    The dominant terms of order $r_1^{2n}$ cancel out.\n\n6.  **Identify the True Dominant Term of $s_n$:**\n    Since the leading terms (of order $r_1^{2n}$) cancel, we must consider the next largest terms.\n    *   The next terms in $V_k$ are $2a_{k+100}$ and $7a_{k+51}$, which are of order $r_1^k$.\n    *   The error in the cancellation of the dominant parts of $V_k-U_k$ comes from the non-dominant roots. The next largest root in magnitude is $r_3$. The error terms will be of the order $(r_1|r_3|)^k$.\n    Let's compare the growth rates:\n    *   Linear terms: $r_1 \\approx 4.6458$.\n    *   Error from cancellation: $r_1|r_3| = (2+\\sqrt{7})\\sqrt{19} \\approx 4.6458 \\times 4.3589 \\approx 20.24$.\n    The error from cancellation, growing like $(r_1|r_3|)^n$, is the dominant component of $s_n$.\n    Thus, $s_n \\sim C \\cdot (r_1|r_3|)^n$ for some constant $C$.\n\n7.  **Calculate the Limit:**\n    The limit is $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(C \\cdot (r_1|r_3|)^n)}}{n}$.\n    $= \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln C + n\\ln(r_1|r_3|)}{n} = \\ln(r_1|r_3|)$.\n    $L = \\ln((2+\\sqrt{7})\\sqrt{19}) = \\ln(2+\\sqrt{7}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(19)$.\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Value:**\n    Using calculator approximations:\n    *   $\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7}) \\approx \\ln(4.64575) \\approx 1.536031$\n    *   $\\ln(19) \\approx 2.944439$\n    *   $L \\approx 1.536031 + \\frac{1}{2}(2.944439) = 1.536031 + 1.4722195 = 3.0082505$.\n    The value to find is the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L$.\n    $10^4 \\cdot L \\approx 10000 \\times 3.0082505 = 30082.505$.\n    The integer part is $30082$.\n\nFinal check of the reasoning. The argument about the cancellation and the error term being dominant is solid. This is a common pattern in such problems where a naive analysis leads to a simpler answer, but a deeper look at the error terms reveals the true asymptotic behavior.\n\nFinal Answer is the integer part of $10^4 (\\ln(2+\\sqrt{7}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(19))$.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$10000 * (1.53603102 + 1.47221959) = 10000 * 3.00825061 = 30082.5061$.\nInteger part is 30082.\n\n<<<30082>>>"
