    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Interpreting the question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$\". In the context of algebraic groups, this is standard terminology for the number of **$G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes** of maximal tori that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup. An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational torus is one that is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism corresponding to the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n**Step 2: Connecting maximal tori to the Weyl group**\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields establishes a bijection between the set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori and the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$.\n*   Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   Let $F$ be the associated Frobenius endomorphism. $F$ acts on the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n*   The **$F$-conjugacy relation** on $W$ is defined as: $w_1 \\sim w_2$ if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$.\n*   The set of equivalence classes under this relation is denoted by $W/\\sim_F$.\n*   **Theorem:** The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of $F$-conjugacy classes in $W$, i.e., $|W/\\sim_F|$.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the structure of G and the action of Frobenius on W**\n\nWe need to identify the Weyl group $W$ and the action of the Frobenius map $F$ on it.\n*   The group $G$ is of type $E_8$, so its Weyl group $W$ is the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n*   The action of $F$ on $W$ is determined by the \"twist\" of the group $G$. A reductive group over a finite field is always quasi-split. A quasi-split group is determined by its (absolute) type and an action of the Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\bar{\\mathbb{F}}_q/\\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the Dynkin diagram.\n*   The Dynkin diagram for $E_8$ is:\n    `o-o-o-o-o-o-o`\n    `      |`\n    `      o`\n*   This diagram has no non-trivial symmetries. Its automorphism group is trivial.\n*   Since the diagram automorphism group is trivial, the action of the Galois group (and thus of its generator, the Frobenius) on the diagram must be trivial.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** The triviality of the diagram automorphism group has two crucial consequences:\n1.  **Any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ must be split.** This is because the classification of forms of $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ shows that all forms are split when the outer automorphism group is trivial (a consequence of Lang's Theorem, since $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G)$ is trivial). So we don't need to worry about non-split forms.\n2.  **The Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.** That is, $F(x) = x$ for all $x \\in W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the counting problem**\n\nWith the knowledge that $F$ acts trivially on $W=W(E_8)$, we can simplify the $F$-conjugacy relation from Step 2:\n$w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$ becomes $w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$.\nThis is the definition of ordinary conjugacy in the group $W$. Therefore, the number of $F$-conjugacy classes is simply the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Step 5: Finding the number of conjugacy classes of W(E8)**\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding a known combinatorial constant: the number of conjugacy classes of the group $W(E_8)$.\n*   The Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a very large finite group of order $696,729,600$.\n*   The number of its conjugacy classes has been computed and is a well-established result in mathematics. This can be found in the character table of $W(E_8)$.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This is not a number that one would compute from scratch. It is a known result from the literature on Coxeter groups and representation theory. According to sources like R.W. Carter's work on Weyl groups (\"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\", 1972) and computational algebra systems like GAP (and its CHEVIE package), the number is fixed.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is **112**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This number is 112. It is independent of the size $q$ of the finite field."
