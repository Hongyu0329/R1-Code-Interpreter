No, it is not possible. There is a fundamental disconnect between the two domains. Gödel's ontological proof is a formal argument in modal logic based on abstract, metaphysical axioms about "positive properties" and "necessary existence." The mathematics of quantum mechanics is a physical theory designed to model the behavior of matter and energy using concepts like Hilbert spaces and operators. The core concepts of Gödel's proof have no definition, representation, or physical meaning within the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, making a proof impossible.
