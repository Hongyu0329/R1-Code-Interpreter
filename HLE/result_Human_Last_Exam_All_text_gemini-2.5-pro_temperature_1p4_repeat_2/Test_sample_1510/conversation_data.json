    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Definitions\n\n*   **Wallpaper Groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional plane crystallographic groups, which describe all the ways a pattern can be repeated to tile an infinite plane. Each group is a set of symmetry operations (translations, rotations, reflections, glide reflections).\n*   **Point Group (or Crystal Class):** For a given wallpaper group, the point group is the group of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed, ignoring the translational symmetries. Formally, if `G` is the wallpaper group and `T` is its subgroup of translations, the point group is the quotient group `G/T`.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The number of elements (i.e., distinct symmetry operations) in the group.\n\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has exactly 2 elements.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Point Groups of Order 2\n\nThe crystallographic restriction theorem limits the rotational symmetries in a crystal lattice to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6-fold rotations. This restricts the possible point groups to the following 10 types:\n*   **Cyclic Groups (rotations only):** $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_6$\n*   **Dihedral Groups (rotations and reflections):** $D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_6$\n\nWe need to find which of these groups have an order of 2.\n*   The order of a cyclic group $C_n$ is `n`. So, $C_2$ has order 2. (This group consists of the identity and a 180° rotation).\n*   The order of a dihedral group $D_n$ is `2n`. So, $D_1$ has order 2*1 = 2. (This group consists of the identity and a single reflection. It is often denoted as 'm').\n\nTherefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either $C_2$ or $D_1$ (m).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the 17 Wallpaper Groups\n\nWe will now go through the 17 wallpaper groups, identify their point group, and check if its order is 2.\n\n**Crystal System: Oblique** (Point groups: $C_1$, $C_2$)\n1.  **p1:** Has only translational symmetry. Its point group is $C_1$ (order 1).\n2.  **p2:** Has 2-fold (180°) rotation centers. Its point group is $C_2$ (order 2). **(1 count)**\n\n**Crystal System: Rectangular** (Point groups: $D_1$, $D_2$)\nThese groups are based on a rectangular lattice. The point group $D_2$ (also called 2mm) has order 4. We are interested in those with point group $D_1$ (also called m), which has order 2.\n3.  **pm:** Contains reflection lines. The point group is $D_1$ (m) (order 2). **(1 count)**\n4.  **pg:** Contains glide reflection lines. A glide reflection is composed of a reflection and a translation. The reflection part contributes to the point group. Thus, the point group is $D_1$ (m) (order 2). **(1 count)**\n5.  **cm:** Based on a centered rectangular lattice, it also has reflection lines. The point group is $D_1$ (m) (order 2). **(1 count)**\n6.  **pmm:** Has perpendicular reflection lines. Point group is $D_2$ (2mm) (order 4).\n7.  **pmg:** Has reflection and perpendicular glide reflection lines. Point group is $D_2$ (2mm) (order 4).\n8.  **pgg:** Has two perpendicular glide reflection lines. Point group is $D_2$ (2mm) (order 4).\n9.  **cmm:** Based on a centered lattice with perpendicular reflection lines. Point group is $D_2$ (2mm) (order 4).\n\n**Crystal System: Square** (Point groups: $C_4$, $D_4$)\n10. **p4:** Point group is $C_4$ (order 4).\n11. **p4m:** Point group is $D_4$ (4mm) (order 8).\n12. **p4g:** Point group is $D_4$ (4mm) (order 8).\n\n**Crystal System: Hexagonal** (Point groups: $C_3, D_3, C_6, D_6$)\n13. **p3:** Point group is $C_3$ (order 3).\n14. **p3m1:** Point group is $D_3$ (3m) (order 6).\n15. **p31m:** Point group is $D_3$ (3m) (order 6).\n16. **p6:** Point group is $C_6$ (order 6).\n17. **p6m:** Point group is $D_6$ (6mm) (order 12).\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nLet's list the wallpaper groups that satisfy the condition (point group of order 2):\n*   From the Oblique system: **p2** (point group $C_2$)\n*   From the Rectangular system: **pm**, **pg**, **cm** (all with point group $D_1$)\n\nCounting these groups, we have a total of 1 + 3 = 4 groups.\n\nThe four wallpaper groups are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
