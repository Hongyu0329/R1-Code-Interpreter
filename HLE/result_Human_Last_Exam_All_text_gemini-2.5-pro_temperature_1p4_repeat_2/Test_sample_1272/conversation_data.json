    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Historical Context:** The question refers to the period of the Ming Dynasty's occupation of Vietnam, known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination (1407–1427). The key conflict during this time was the Lam Sơn Uprising, led by Lê Lợi against the occupying Ming forces. General Mu Sheng (沐晟) was a prominent Ming commander tasked with suppressing this rebellion.\n\n2.  **Pinpoint Mu Sheng's Campaigns and Defeats:** Mu Sheng led several campaigns into Vietnam. While his final campaign in 1427 ended in a strategic retreat, his first significant and direct military defeat occurred earlier. We need to distinguish this from other famous Ming defeats where he was not the primary commander, such as the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426), where Wang Tong was the main commander.\n\n3.  **Identify the Specific Battle:** Historical records from both sides, including the Vietnamese chronicle *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư*, describe a major battle in 1425. After the Lam Sơn rebels successfully shifted their operations from Thanh Hóa to the southern province of Nghệ An, the Ming court ordered Mu Sheng to lead a large army from Yunnan to crush them.\n\n4.  **Describe the Event:** Mu Sheng's army advanced into Nghệ An. However, the Lam Sơn forces, under the command of Lê Lợi's brilliant generals such as Đinh Lễ and Lê Sát, had prepared an ambush. They lured Mu Sheng's army into a confrontation at a fortified pass known as **Khả Lưu** (sometimes referred to as Ải Khả Lưu or Khả Lưu quan). Here, the Ming army was decisively defeated. They suffered thousands of casualties, and Mu Sheng himself was forced to abandon his heavy equipment and flee the battlefield. This was a direct, tactical defeat and marks his first major personal failure against the Lam Sơn army.\n\n5.  **Locate the Battlefield in Modern Geography:** The historical site of the Battle of Khả Lưu is located in the western, mountainous region of the province it occurred in. Modern historical research places the location of the Khả Lưu stockade (đồn Khả Lưu) in what is now **Anh Sơn District**.\n\n6.  **Identify the Current Province:** Anh Sơn District is a rural district within the modern administrative boundaries of **Nghệ An Province** in North Central Vietnam.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Between Battles:** It is crucial not to confuse the 1425 Battle of Khả Lưu with the final campaign of 1427. In 1427, Mu Sheng led a relief army from Yunnan but retreated after hearing that the other Ming army under Liu Sheng had been annihilated at Chi Lăng. While this was a campaign failure, the Battle of Khả Lưu in 1425 was a direct, head-on combat defeat where his own forces were routed.\n*   **\"First\" and \"Major\":** The battle at Khả Lưu fits the criteria of being both his \"first\" significant defeat against Lê Lợi's forces and a \"major\" one, given the large number of casualties and the strategic impact of his retreat, which solidified Lam Sơn's control over the region.\n*   **Location Translation:** The key is accurately tracing the historical name of the battlefield, \"Khả Lưu,\" to its modern geographical location, which falls within Nghệ An Province.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of historical events, Ming General Mu Sheng's first major military defeat took place at the Battle of Khả Lưu in 1425. This historical site is located within the present-day territory of Nghệ An Province.\n\n<<<Nghệ An Province>>>"
