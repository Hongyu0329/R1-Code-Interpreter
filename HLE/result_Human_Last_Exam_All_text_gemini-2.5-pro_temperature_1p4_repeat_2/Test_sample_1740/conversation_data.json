    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Subject**\nThe question asks about the \"let-7 family\" in \"humans\".\n*   **let-7 family:** This refers to a specific group of microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. A \"family\" of miRNAs is defined by members sharing a highly similar sequence, particularly in the \"seed region\" which is vital for target recognition.\n*   **Humans:** The scope is limited to the species *Homo sapiens*.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Authoritative Sources**\nTo get an accurate and up-to-date count, we need to consult reliable bioinformatics databases and scientific literature. The primary repository for miRNA data is:\n*   **miRBase:** The central, searchable database of published miRNA sequences and annotation.\n*   **Scientific Literature:** Peer-reviewed review articles on miRNAs or the let-7 family provide a curated consensus view from experts in the field.\n\n**Step 3: Differentiate Between Genes and Mature miRNAs**\nThis is a critical point of potential confusion that requires careful consideration.\n*   **miRNA Genes (Precursors):** These are specific locations (loci) in the genome that code for a pre-miRNA hairpin structure.\n*   **Mature miRNAs:** After transcription and processing, the hairpin is cleaved to produce the final, functional mature miRNA.\nIt is possible for multiple different genes, located at different places in the genome, to produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence. The question \"how many members\" typically refers to the number of unique mature miRNA sequences, as these are the functional units of the family.\n\n**Step 4: Enumerate the Members of the Human let-7 Family**\nBy consulting miRBase and established scientific literature, we can list the distinct mature miRNAs that are recognized as members of the human let-7 family. These members are distinguished by slight variations in their sequence outside of the core seed region.\n\nThe identified members are:\n1.  **let-7a**\n2.  **let-7b**\n3.  **let-7c**\n4.  **let-7d**\n5.  **let-7e**\n6.  **let-7f**\n7.  **let-7g**\n8.  **let-7i**\n9.  **miR-98**\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to note that **miR-98** is universally considered a member of the let-7 family due to its high sequence homology, especially in the seed sequence, and similar functional targets.\n\n**Step 5: Correlate with the Number of Genes (for clarity)**\nTo further clarify the count, we can look at the number of genes that produce these 9 mature miRNAs in humans.\n*   **let-7a** is produced by 3 distinct genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3).\n*   **let-7f** is produced by 2 distinct genes (let-7f-1, let-7f-2).\n*   **let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98** are each produced by a single gene.\nThis results in a total of 12 genes (3 + 2 + 7*1 = 12) that code for the 9 unique mature let-7 family members. Answering with \"12\" would be incorrect as it refers to the gene count, not the number of distinct family members.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nCounting the unique mature miRNA sequences listed in Step 4 gives us the final answer. There are 8 members with the \"let-7\" prefix (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i) and one closely related member, miR-98, for a total of 9 members. This number is well-established and has remained consistent in miRNA research for many years.\n\n***\n\nTo date, 9 members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans. These are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n\n<<<9>>>"
