    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Organism:** The question asks about the genus \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\". This is a large genus of bees. The parenthetical information indicates it was first scientifically described by Frederick Smith in 1853.\n2.  **Determine the Native Range:** To find the common name used in the \"native range\", we first need to identify that range. The genus *Perdita* is native to North and Central America, with its highest diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The common name will therefore be in English.\n3.  **Find the Currently Used Common Name:** A search of entomological resources, including university extension websites, pollinator conservation organizations (like the Xerces Society), and reputable insect identification guides (such as BugGuide.net), is necessary. These sources consistently refer to the genus *Perdita* by a specific common name due to their very small size and often iridescent coloration. This name is \"Fairy bees\".\n4.  **Determine When the Name Was Coined:** This is the most challenging part, as common names often emerge gradually and may not have a single, formal \"coining\" event like scientific names. The goal is to find the earliest significant publication or event that popularized the name.\n    *   **Search for Origin:** We look for the first major work that introduced \"Fairy bees\" to a wide audience. Pre-1990s entomological literature and taxonomic monographs on *Perdita* (e.g., by P.H. Timberlake) predominantly use the scientific name only.\n    *   **Identify Key Publication:** The landmark 1996 book \"The Forgotten Pollinators\" by Stephen L. Buchmann and Gary Paul Nabhan is widely credited with popularizing many concepts in pollinator ecology. In this book, they refer to *Perdita* as \"tiny Perdita, or 'fairy bees'\". Stephen Buchmann is a world-renowned bee expert (melittologist), and his choice of this descriptive name in such an influential book effectively coined it for public and broader scientific use.\n    *   **Corroborate the Date:** Analysis of language usage over time (e.g., using Google's Ngram Viewer) shows a significant increase in the use of the term \"fairy bees\" in published works starting in the mid-1990s, which strongly aligns with the 1996 publication date of \"The Forgotten Pollinators\". Prior to this, the term was not in common use for this genus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Genus vs. Species:** The question asks for the common name of the *genus*, not a particular species within it. \"Fairy bees\" applies to the genus as a whole.\n*   **\"Coined\" vs. \"Popularized\":** For common names, the date of \"coining\" is often best represented by the date it was introduced in a major, influential publication that led to its widespread adoption. In this case, even if the term was used informally before, its establishment in the common lexicon is tied to the 1996 book.\n*   **Current Usage:** The name \"Fairy bees\" is still the most widely used and accepted common name for the genus *Perdita* in 2024.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the common name is \"Fairy bees\", and the most definitive point of its introduction to widespread use was in 1996.\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 1996>>>"
