    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nThe problem provides a system of linear differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations, which model the probabilities of a system being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3} over time. We are asked to find the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 at steady state, i.e., as time $t$ approaches infinity. This is denoted by $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Steady-State Equations\nAt steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $P_i$. If the probabilities are constant, their time derivatives must be zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$.\nBy setting the derivatives in the given system to zero, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0} + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}P_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1} + \\lambda_{21}P_{2} + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}P_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}P_{2} - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}$\n\nAdditionally, the sum of all probabilities must be equal to 1, which provides the normalization condition:\n5.  $P_{0} + P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 1$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Steady State:** The core of the problem is realizing that $P_i(+\\infty)$ implies a steady-state condition where $P_i'(t)=0$.\n*   **System of Equations:** We have five equations for four unknowns ($P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$). However, the first four equations are linearly dependent (the sum of their left-hand sides and right-hand sides is zero). This means one of them is redundant. We will need to use the normalization equation (5) to find a unique solution.\n*   **Numerical Precision:** To avoid rounding errors, it is best to perform calculations with fractions or exact values as long as possible.\n\n### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations\nLet's substitute the given values of the transition rates $\\lambda_{ij}$ into the equations:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n$\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n$\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n$\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n$\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n$\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\nThe system becomes:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 P_0 + 0.65 P_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 P_0 - (0.65 + 0.4)P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3 \\implies 0 = 0.019 P_0 - 1.05 P_1 + 0.392 P_2 + 0.008 P_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 P_1 - (0.392 + 0.008)P_2 \\implies 0 = 0.4 P_1 - 0.4 P_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 P_2 - 0.008 P_3$\n5.  $P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n\nNow, we solve this system. It is easiest to express $P_0, P_2, P_3$ in terms of $P_1$.\n\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 P_2 = 0.008 P_3 \\implies P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 P_1 = 0.4 P_2 \\implies P_1 = P_2$\n\nCombining these results, we find:\n$P_1 = P_2 = P_3$\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 P_0 = 0.65 P_1 \\implies P_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1$\n\nNow, we substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n$P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} P_1) + P_1 + P_1 + P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) P_1 = 1$\nTo add the numbers, we find a common denominator:\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{3 \\times 19}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) P_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} P_1 = 1$\n$P_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\nNow that we have $P_1$, we can find $P_0$:\n$P_0 = \\frac{650}{19} P_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Answer\nThe question asks for the sum $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$, which is $P_0 + P_1$.\n$P_0 + P_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\nThe numerical value is approximately $0.94625$. The exact fraction is $\\frac{669}{707}$.\n\n<<<669/707>>>"
