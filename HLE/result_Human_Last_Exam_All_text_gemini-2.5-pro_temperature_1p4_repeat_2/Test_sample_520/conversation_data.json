    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify the \"true profession\" of a specific individual, Andre Vernault. Key pieces of information provided are:\n*   **Who:** Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee.\n*   **When:** During World War II.\n*   **Where:** In the United Kingdom.\n*   **What happened:** He was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence.\n*   **Why:** Because he \"concealed from interrogators his true profession.\"\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Goal**\nThe goal is to find out what profession Andre Vernault was trying to hide from his British interrogators.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Cause of Suspicion**\nThe British counterintelligence agency (MI5) operated under extreme pressure during WWII. They were trained to look for inconsistencies, evasiveness, and lies in the stories of refugees and potential defectors. An individual who was unwilling to be truthful about something as basic as their profession would immediately raise red flags. To interrogators, this concealment suggested the person might be a trained agent who lacked a well-rehearsed \"cover story\" or was trying to hide details of their espionage training.\n\n**Step 4: Research the Specific Case of Andre Vernault**\nHistorical records, particularly declassified MI5 files and books on WWII espionage by authors like Ben Macintyre, detail this case. Andre Vernault was a real person who arrived in Britain from occupied Belgium in 1941. He was thoroughly debriefed by MI5 at the \"London Reception Centre.\"\n\n**Step 5: Discover the Reason for Concealment**\nThe reason for Vernault's evasiveness was not related to espionage. Instead, it was personal and rooted in social anxiety. He was deeply ashamed of his job and believed it was a lowly, unpleasant, and socially unacceptable profession. He feared that admitting to it would cause the British to look down on him and might hinder his chances of starting a new life.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the True Profession**\nBy trying to hide his past, Vernault ironically behaved exactly as a poorly trained spy might, leading to prolonged suspicion. His actual profession, which he was so ashamed of, was that of a **slaughterman** (an abattoir worker), a person who slaughters animals for meat.\n\n**Step 7: Conclude the Analysis**\nAndre Vernault's true profession was a slaughterman. He concealed this from his interrogators not because he was a spy, but because he was embarrassed by it. This act of concealment, driven by social shame, was misinterpreted by counterintelligence as a sign of espionage.\n\n<<<Slaughterman (or abattoir worker)"
