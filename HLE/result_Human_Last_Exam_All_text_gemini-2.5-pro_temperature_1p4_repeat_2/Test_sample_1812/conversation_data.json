    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe objective is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix A given as:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is contextual and not required for the calculation itself, as the matrix `A` is explicitly provided.\n\n**Step 2: Choose a Method for Calculation**\nThere are several methods to compute the determinant of a 3x3 matrix. We will demonstrate two common methods.\n\n*   **Method 1: Cofactor Expansion (Standard Formula)**\n    The determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is given by the formula:\n    \\( \\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\)\n\n*   **Method 2: Row Operations**\n    A more insightful method involves observing the relationship between the rows of the matrix.\n\n**Step 3: Perform the Calculation using Method 1**\nLet's apply the standard formula to matrix A:\n`a = 2`, `b = -1`, `c = -1`\n`d = -1`, `e = 2`, `f = -1`\n`g = -1`, `h = -1`, `i = 2`\n\nSubstitute these values into the determinant formula:\n\\[ \\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\n\nFirst, calculate the determinants of the 2x2 matrices:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, substitute these back into the main expression:\n\\[ \\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\]\n\\[ \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 \\]\n\\[ \\det(A) = 0 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Perform the Calculation using Method 2 (Careful Points)**\nThis method often provides a quicker solution if a specific property is observed.\nA crucial property of determinants is that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Linear dependence means that one row can be expressed as a linear combination of the other rows.\n\nLet's examine the rows of matrix A:\n*   Row 1: \\( R_1 = [2, -1, -1] \\)\n*   Row 2: \\( R_2 = [-1, 2, -1] \\)\n*   Row 3: \\( R_3 = [-1, -1, 2] \\)\n\nLet's sum the three rows:\n\\( R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2] \\)\n\\( R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = [0, 0, 0] \\)\n\nSince the sum of the three rows is the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. For example, \\( R_1 = -R_2 - R_3 \\). A fundamental theorem in linear algebra states that a square matrix with linearly dependent rows has a determinant of 0.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth methods consistently show that the determinant of the matrix A is 0. The second method, which relies on spotting the linear dependence of the rows, is particularly efficient.\n\nFinal Answer: The determinant of the given matrix is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
