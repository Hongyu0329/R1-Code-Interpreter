    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the \"Second Great War\"**\nThe \"Second Great War\" is the term commonly used to describe the series of large-scale conflicts that take place during the *StarCraft II* trilogy. It is a distinct conflict from the first \"Great War,\" which occurred during the original *StarCraft* and its *Brood War* expansion.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Starting Point of the War**\nThe Second Great War is widely considered to have begun with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector. This is the inciting incident of the *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty* campaign. According to the official StarCraft lore timeline, this event occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Ending Point of the War**\nThe war's conclusion is marked by the final defeat of the primary antagonist of the saga, the dark god Amon. This happens in the final mission of the *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* epilogue campaign, \"Into the Void.\" This concluding event takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Raw Duration**\nThe war begins at some point during the year 2504 and ends at some point during the year 2506. The events span across three calendar years:\n*   **2504:** Events of *Wings of Liberty*.\n*   **2505:** Events of *Heart of the Swarm*.\n*   **2506:** Events of *Legacy of the Void* and its epilogue.\n\nThis means the total duration is more than two full years but less than three full years. For example, if the war started in February 2504 and ended in November 2506, its duration would be 2 years and 9 months. The exact duration is approximately 2.5 to 2.8 years, but in all cases, it is a value greater than 2 and less than 3.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rounding Instruction**\nThe question requires the final answer to be **\"rounded up\"** to the nearest whole year. Since the calculated duration is greater than 2 years (let's call it 2.x years), rounding this value up to the next whole number gives us 3.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correctly Identify the War:** Do not confuse the Second Great War (*StarCraft II*) with the first Great War (*StarCraft* & *Brood War*).\n2.  **Use Official Lore Timeline:** The years 2504 (start) and 2506 (end) are based on the canonical timeline of the StarCraft universe.\n3.  **Understand Duration vs. Year Subtraction:** The duration is the total time elapsed, not simply the end year minus the start year (2506 - 2504 = 2). Because the conflict spans *across* these years, the actual time is greater than 2 years.\n4.  **Adhere to the Rounding Rule:** The instruction \"rounded up\" is critical. Any duration over 2 years, no matter how small the fraction, must be rounded up to 3.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis, the final answer is calculated as follows:\n*   **Start:** 2504\n*   **End:** 2506\n*   **Actual Duration:** More than 2 years.\n*   **Duration Rounded Up:** 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
