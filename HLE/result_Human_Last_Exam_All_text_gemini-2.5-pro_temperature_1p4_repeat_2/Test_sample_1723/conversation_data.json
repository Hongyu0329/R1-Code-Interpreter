    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific **genus** of mushroom. The key identifying characteristic provided is that it is the **only one** known to produce a **distinctly blue spore print**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand \"Spore Print\"**\nA spore print is a critical tool in mushroom identification. It's the powdery deposit of spores left behind when a mushroom cap is placed gills-down on a surface. The color of this print is a stable genetic trait of a species. It is important not to confuse the spore print color with the color of the mushroom's cap, gills, or flesh, which can be very different.\n\n**Step 3: Rule Out Common Misconceptions**\nA very famous blue mushroom is *Lactarius indigo*, commonly known as the indigo milk cap. It is vividly blue and even \"bleeds\" a blue latex-like fluid when cut. However, despite its blue appearance, its spore print is actually cream to yellowish. Therefore, *Lactarius* is not the correct answer.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Correct Genus**\nResearching rare spore print colors in the field of mycology reveals that blue is one of the rarest. The scientific literature and mycological guides consistently point to one genus that contains species capable of producing a blue spore print. This genus is **Entoloma**.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Details about the Genus**\nThe genus *Entoloma* is very large and diverse. The vast majority of species within this genus actually produce a characteristic pink or pinkish-brown spore print (the name itself comes from Greek *entos* \"within\" and *loma* \"fringe,\" referring to the inrolled cap margin, but it is famous for its pink angular spores). However, a specific subgroup within *Entoloma* (sometimes classified as the subgenus *Leptonia* or *Cyanula*) contains a few species known for producing blue, blue-green, or violet spore prints. Species like *Entoloma nitidum* are prime examples. Because these species belong to the genus *Entoloma*, it stands as the single genus known to have this unique characteristic.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Specificity:** The question is about the spore print, not the mushroom's color.\n*   **Taxonomy:** The question asks for the *genus*, which is a broader classification than a specific species.\n*   **Uniqueness:** The question emphasizes that this is a \"single genus,\" highlighting the rarity of this trait.\n*   **Variation within the Genus:** It's important to recognize that not all species in the genus *Entoloma* have a blue spore print; in fact, most do not. But it is the only genus that *contains* species that do.\n\nBy following these analytical steps, we arrive at the correct genus.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
