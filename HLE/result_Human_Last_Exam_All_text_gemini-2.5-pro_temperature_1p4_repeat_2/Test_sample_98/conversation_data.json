    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the shape of the water surface.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Setup**\nThe problem describes an icosahedron-shaped tank. An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. The tank is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one of its triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. The tank is \"half-filled with water.\"\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Position of the Water Surface**\n*   Due to gravity, the surface of the water will be a flat, horizontal plane.\n*   A regular icosahedron has a point of inversion symmetry at its geometric center. This means for any point in the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the center.\n*   A plane passing through this center of symmetry will divide the volume of the icosahedron into two equal halves.\n*   Since the tank is half-filled, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the exact center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Geometric Problem**\nThe question is now purely geometric: What is the shape of the cross-section created when a regular icosahedron is sliced by a plane that passes through its center and is parallel to one of its faces?\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Symmetries of the Icosahedron in this Orientation**\n*   When an icosahedron rests on a face, it has a 3-fold rotational symmetry axis that passes perpendicularly through the center of the base face and the center of the opposite (top) face.\n*   It also possesses three mirror planes that contain this rotational axis.\n*   The cross-section created by the horizontal plane must also exhibit these same symmetries. A 2D shape with 3-fold rotational symmetry and three mirror planes passing through its center must be either an equilateral triangle or a regular hexagon (or a more complex star shape, which is not expected from a simple slice).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Number of Sides of the Cross-Section**\nThe number of sides of the polygonal cross-section is equal to the number of faces of the icosahedron that the cutting plane intersects. We can determine this number by counting the faces that lie entirely below the central plane.\n\n1.  **Vertex Layers:** The 12 vertices of the icosahedron can be grouped into four horizontal layers of three vertices each when it is standing on a face. Let's call them:\n    *   **V_base**: 3 vertices forming the base triangle.\n    *   **V_low**: 3 vertices at the next level up.\n    *   **V_high**: 3 vertices at the level above V_low.\n    *   **V_top**: 3 vertices forming the top triangle.\n    The central cutting plane lies exactly between the V_low and V_high layers. The 6 vertices in V_base and V_low are in the \"lower half,\" and the 6 vertices in V_high and V_top are in the \"upper half.\"\n\n2.  **Counting Faces:** A face lies entirely in the lower half if all three of its vertices are from the V_base and V_low groups. Let's count these faces:\n    *   **The base face itself:** This is one face.\n    *   **\"Skirt\" faces:** There are three faces that connect the edges of the base to the vertices in the V_low layer.\n    *   **\"Hip\" faces:** There are three more faces that connect one base vertex to two vertices from the V_low layer.\n    This gives a total of 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 faces entirely in the lower half. (This structure can be confirmed by checking that each vertex has the correct degree of 5).\n\n3.  **Finding the Number of Cut Faces:**\n    *   By symmetry, there are also 7 faces entirely in the upper half.\n    *   Total faces = 20.\n    *   The number of faces intersected by the central plane is: Total Faces - (Lower Faces + Upper Faces) = 20 - (7 + 7) = 6.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n*   Since the cutting plane intersects 6 faces of the icosahedron, the resulting cross-section (the water surface) is a polygon with 6 sides, i.e., a hexagon.\n*   As established in Step 4, this hexagon must possess the 3-fold rotational and mirror symmetries of the oriented icosahedron. A hexagon with these symmetries must be a **regular hexagon**.\n\nThe shape of the water surface will be a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<regular hexagon>>>"
