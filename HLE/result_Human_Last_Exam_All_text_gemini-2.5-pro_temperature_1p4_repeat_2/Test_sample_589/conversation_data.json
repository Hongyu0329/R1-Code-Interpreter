    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\n*   **Production:** A Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio.\n*   **Character:** A teenager.\n*   **Object:** A pink bike.\n*   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the specific action.**\nThe action described is a \"game of chicken\" or a direct confrontation. It's a highly dramatic and dangerous act, suggesting a moment of defiance, bravery, or desperation for the character. The teenager isn't accidentally hit; they are intentionally riding toward the car to challenge the driver.\n\n**Step 3: Search for films that combine these specific elements.**\nThe combination of a teenager, a distinctly colored (pink) bike, and a head-on confrontation with a car is very specific and memorable.\n\n*   Many films feature teenagers on bikes (e.g., *E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, *Stranger Things*), but they do not contain this specific scene.\n*   Some films feature games of chicken, but with different vehicles (e.g., the tractors in *Footloose*).\n*   The title *Pretty in Pink* comes to mind due to the color, but the main character famously drives a pink car, not a bike.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the correct film and verify the details.**\nThe film that precisely matches all the criteria is the 2017 horror film **It**.\n\n*   **Major Studio Film:** *It* was produced by New Line Cinema (a subsidiary of Warner Bros.) and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a major Hollywood studio.\n*   **Teenager:** The scene features Beverly \"Bev\" Marsh, a key member of the teenage \"Losers' Club.\"\n*   **Pink Bike:** Beverly's bike is a distinct reddish-pink Huffy bicycle.\n*   **The Action:** In a key scene, the bully Henry Bowers and his gang chase the Losers' Club in his Pontiac Trans Am. While the others flee, Beverly stops, turns around, and pedals directly and defiantly toward Bowers' speeding car. Her intense stare unnerves Bowers, who swerves at the last second to avoid hitting her, crashing his car in the process. This scene perfectly matches the description in the question.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAll points of the query are satisfied by the climactic chase scene involving Beverly Marsh in the 2017 film *It*.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
