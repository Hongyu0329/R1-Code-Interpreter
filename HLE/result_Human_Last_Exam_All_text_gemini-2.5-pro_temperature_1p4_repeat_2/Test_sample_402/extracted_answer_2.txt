This four-step strategy provides a robust, command-line-based method for filtering cancer cell contamination from your RNA-seq data. It begins with a stringent log2 fold change filter to identify potential contaminants and crucially refines this list using curated knowledge of both cancer-specific and T-cell-specific genes. This prevents the accidental removal of true biological signals and results in a cleaned dataset that more accurately reflects the transcriptional differences between your regular CAR T cells and your IL-15-secreting CAR T cells.
