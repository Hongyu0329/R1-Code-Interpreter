    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each word to determine which one has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**1. Understanding Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change rule in English. It states that a long vowel becomes short if it is in the antepenultimate syllable (the third syllable from the end of the word) and is under stress. For this rule to apply, two main conditions must be met:\n*   The word must have at least three syllables.\n*   The vowel in question must have been long at the time the rule applied.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Word**\n\n*   **southern**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Comes from Old English *sūþerne*, which is derived from *sūþ* (\"south\").\n    *   **Analysis**: The Old English word *sūþ* had a long vowel /uː/. In the three-syllable word *sūþerne* (sūþ-er-ne), this long vowel is in the first, stressed syllable, which is the antepenultimate syllable (third from the end). The rule applies, and the long /uː/ was shortened, eventually becoming the modern /ʌ/ sound in /ˈsʌðərn/.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Related to the verb \"derive\".\n    *   **Analysis**: The word \"derive\" /dɪˈraɪv/ has a long vowel (a diphthong /aɪ/ that developed from Middle English /iː/). In the word \"derivative\" (de-riv-a-tive), the stress shifts to the \"riv\" syllable. This is the antepenultimate syllable. The vowel in this syllable is short /ɪ/. The long vowel in the root was shortened because of its position in a longer word.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Related to the adjective \"serene\".\n    *   **Analysis**: The word \"serene\" /səˈriːn/ has a long vowel /iː/. In the word \"serenity\" (se-ren-i-ty), the stress shifts to the \"ren\" syllable, which is the antepenultimate syllable. This vowel is the short /ɛ/. The long vowel in the root was shortened.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Related to the verb \"please\".\n    *   **Analysis**: \"Pleasant\" (/ˈplɛzənt/) is a two-syllable word. Trisyllabic laxing only applies to words with three or more syllables. Although the related word \"please\" /pliːz/ has a long vowel, the shortening in \"pleasant\" is due to a different rule (likely pre-cluster shortening) and not trisyllabic laxing.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It has not undergone trisyllabic laxing because it is not a trisyllabic word.\n\n*   **gratitude**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Related to words like \"grateful\".\n    *   **Analysis**: The root vowel in \"grateful\" (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/) is long (the diphthong /eɪ/ which developed from Middle English /aː/). In the three-syllable word \"gratitude\" (grat-i-tude), the stress is on the first syllable \"grat\", which is the antepenultimate syllable. This vowel is the short /æ/. The long vowel of the root was shortened.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It has undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**:\n    *   **Etymology**: Comes from Old English *sceadu*.\n    *   **Analysis**: Firstly, \"shadow\" (/ˈʃædoʊ/) is a two-syllable word, so trisyllabic laxing cannot apply. Secondly, and more fundamentally, the root vowel in Old English *sceadu* was already short (/æ/). There was never a long vowel in this word's history that could be shortened by this rule.\n    *   **Conclusion**: It has not undergone trisyllabic laxing because it is not a trisyllabic word and its vowel was never long in the first place.\n\n**3. Final Conclusion**\n\nBoth \"pleasant\" and \"shadow\" are disyllabic (two-syllable) words and therefore cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing. However, \"shadow\" is the stronger answer because not only is it too short for the rule to apply, but its root vowel has been short since Old English. There was never a long vowel to be \"laxed\" or shortened. The word \"pleasant\" has a short vowel that contrasts with a related long vowel (in \"please\"), but the shortening mechanism was not trisyllabic laxing. Since \"shadow\" fails to meet the conditions for trisyllabic laxing on two fundamental counts (syllable count and original vowel length), it is the most definitive example of a word that has not undergone the process.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
