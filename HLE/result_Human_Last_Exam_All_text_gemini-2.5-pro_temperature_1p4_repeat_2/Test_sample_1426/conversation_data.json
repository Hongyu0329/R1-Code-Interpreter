    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Instrument**\nThe question concerns Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to focus specifically on the part written for the \"first violin\" (Violino I).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the End of the Symphony**\nWe must examine the score of the fourth and final movement, which is marked *Allegro con fuoco*. The answer lies in the very last measure of music for the first violin.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Measure for the First Violin**\nLooking at the full orchestral score, the first violin part is at the top of the string section. In the final measure of the symphony, the first violins (along with most of the orchestra) play a final, sustained chord. The instruction for the first violin part is to play three notes at the same time. This is called a \"triple stop\".\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Three Notes of the Final Chord**\nThe first violin part is written in the treble clef. The three notes written on the staff for the final chord are:\n1.  **B♭4:** The B-flat on the middle line of the staff.\n2.  **D5:** The D in the fourth space from the bottom of the staff.\n3.  **F5:** The F on the top line of the staff.\n\nThese three notes (B♭, D, F) together form the tonic B-flat major chord, which provides the symphony's powerful conclusion.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Lowest Note**\nComparing the three notes played simultaneously—B♭4, D5, and F5—we need to find the one with the lowest pitch. The pitch is determined by the note's position on the staff. The lowest note written on the staff for this final chord is B♭4.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **\"Three notes\"**: The question refers to the three notes of the final chord played simultaneously, not the last three notes played in sequence over time.\n*   **Instrument**: It is crucial to look only at the first violin part (Violino I), not the second violins or any other instrument.\n*   **Clef and Key**: Correctly reading the treble clef and understanding the key signature of B-flat major (which has two flats: B♭ and E♭) is essential to identify the notes accurately.\n\nBased on this analysis, the lowest of the three notes that end the symphony for the first violin is B-flat.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
