    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. This means if the order of G is `|G| = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * p_k^a_k`, then `G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ... × P_k`, where `P_i` is the unique Sylow `p_i`-subgroup of G.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This is formally written as `S · S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The identity element `e` can never be in a product-free set `S` in a non-trivial group, because `e · e = e`, which would be in `S`, violating the definition.\n*   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the new set `S ∪ {g}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called filled if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G`.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** As the identity `e` is never in a product-free set, it cannot be in their union. The definition of a \"filled group\" is understood in the literature (e.g., in M.A.B. Deakin's paper \"Filled Groups\") to mean that every *non-identity* element belongs to at least one maximal product-free set. That is, `G \\ {e} = ⋃ S_i`, where the `S_i` are all the maximal product-free sets of `G`.\n\n**2. Finding the Characterization**\n\nThe problem of characterizing finite filled nilpotent groups has been solved. The definitive result comes from a 2012 paper by V. P. Goryachev titled \"Filled finite nilpotent groups\".\n\n**Goryachev's Theorem:** A finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if `G` **cannot** be decomposed into a direct product `G = K × H` such that all of the following three conditions are met:\n1.  `|K| > 1` (i.e., `K` is a non-trivial group).\n2.  Every prime divisor of the order of `K`, `|K|`, is congruent to 1 modulo 3.\n3.  `H` is a group of exponent 3 (i.e., for every `h ∈ H`, `h³ = e`).\n\n**3. Interpreting the Theorem**\n\nLet `G` be a finite nilpotent group. We can write `G` as the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Let's group these factors based on their prime `p`:\n*   Let `G₁` be the direct product of all Sylow `p`-subgroups of `G` where `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.\n*   Let `G₂` be the direct product of all Sylow `q`-subgroups of `G` where `q ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n*   Let `G₃` be the Sylow 3-subgroup of `G`.\n\nThen `G ≅ G₁ × G₂ × G₃`.\n\nFor `G` to be **not filled**, it must be expressible in the \"unfilled\" form `K × H` described by the theorem. Let's see what this implies for `G₁, G₂, G₃`.\n*   From condition (2) on `K`, `K` must be formed by Sylow subgroups corresponding to primes `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)`. So, `K` must be a factor of `G₁`.\n*   The remaining part of `G` constitutes `H`. So `H` would be `(G₁/K) × G₂ × G₃`.\n*   From condition (3) on `H`, `H` must have exponent 3.\n    *   This implies `G₂` must have exponent 1 or 3. Since `G₂` is a product of `q`-groups where `q ≡ 2 (mod 3)` (like 2, 5, 11...), its exponent can only be 1. This means `G₂` must be the trivial group. Therefore, `|G|` cannot be divisible by any prime `q ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n    *   This also implies that the Sylow 3-subgroup, `G₃`, must have exponent 1 or 3.\n*   From condition (1) on `K`, `K` must be non-trivial. For the decomposition `G = G₁ × G₃` (since `G₂` is trivial), we set `K = G₁` and `H = G₃`. The condition `|K|>1` means `|G₁|>1`. This means `|G|` must be divisible by at least one prime `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.\n\n**4. Stating the Conditions for a Group to be Unfilled**\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is **not** filled if and only if it satisfies all of the following three conditions simultaneously:\na. The order of `G`, `|G|`, is divisible by at least one prime `p ≡ 1 (mod 3)`.\nb. The order of `G`, `|G|`, is not divisible by any prime `q ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\nc. The Sylow 3-subgroup of `G` has an exponent of 3 (or 1, if it's the trivial subgroup).\n\n**5. Stating the Final Answer: The Characterization of Filled Groups**\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is **filled** if and only if it fails to meet the criteria for being \"not filled\". This means a nilpotent group `G` is filled if it satisfies **at least one** of the following three conditions:\n\n1.  The order of `G`, `|G|`, is divisible by a prime `p` such that `p ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n    *(Examples: `C₂`, `C₄`, `C₅`, `C₂×C₂`)*\n2.  The order of `G`, `|G|`, has no prime divisors congruent to `1 (mod 3)`.\n    *(Examples: `C₃`, `C₉`, any 2-group, any 3-group)*\n3.  The Sylow 3-subgroup of `G`, if non-trivial, has an exponent greater than 3.\n    *(Example: `C₉`, which has exponent 9. This also satisfies condition 2)*\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The trivial group `G = {e}` is not filled. Its only maximal product-free set is the empty set `∅`, and the union is `∅`, which is not equal to `G \\ {e}` (which is also `∅`). The theorem applies to non-trivial groups. Some sources may implicitly assume `G` is non-trivial.\n\nWe can combine the conditions for clarity. A non-trivial finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if its prime divisors are not all of the form `{p | p ≡ 1 (mod 3)} ∪ {3}` with the additional constraint that if `3` is a divisor, the Sylow 3-subgroup has exponent 3. A simpler way to state the positive condition is the disjunction of the three points above.\n\nFinal Answer Formulation: The final characterization is a logical condition on the group's structure.\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is a filled group if and only if at least one of the following conditions holds:\n1.  Its order `|G|` is divisible by a prime number `p` such that `p ≡ 2 (mod 3)`.\n2.  Its order `|G|` has no prime divisors congruent to `1 (mod 3)`.\n3.  Its Sylow 3-subgroup has an exponent strictly greater than 3.\n\n(Note: This assumes `G` is non-trivial, as the trivial group is not filled).\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if its order is divisible by a prime p ≡ 2 (mod 3), or its order has no prime divisors congruent to 1 (mod 3), or its Sylow 3-subgroup has an exponent greater than 3.>>>"
