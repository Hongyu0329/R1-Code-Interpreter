    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A specific Christian theologian.\n    *   **Key Action:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\" This implies a systematic or philosophical set of terms, not just a general discussion.\n    *   **Purpose of Terminology:** To describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This could mean suspension, violation, alteration, or addition to these laws.\n    *   **Specific Applications (Test Cases):** The terminology must be applicable to two distinct events:\n        1.  **The Virgin Birth of Jesus:** A singular, miraculous event that bypasses the normal biological laws of reproduction.\n        2.  **The Fall:** A foundational event that resulted in a lasting, systemic alteration of the natural world (e.g., introduction of death, disease, decay, painful childbirth, etc.).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Elimination:**\n    *   **Modern Theologians/Creation Scientists:** Figures like those in the Intelligent Design movement or Young Earth Creationism discuss these topics, but the question asks who *first* developed such terminology, pointing toward a foundational, historical figure.\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (13th Century):** A major candidate. He developed the terminology of **primary and secondary causes**. God is the Primary Cause, and the laws of nature are secondary causes. A miracle (like the Virgin Birth) is God acting directly as the Primary Cause, bypassing the secondary causes. This framework is excellent for explaining singular miracles. However, it is less direct in explaining the *systemic alteration* of nature after the Fall. While the effects of the Fall can be discussed within his system, the framework itself is more about *how* God interacts with the world (via primary or secondary causality) rather than a specific terminology for a change *in* the secondary causes themselves.\n    *   **C.S. Lewis (20th Century):** In his book *Miracles*, Lewis provides powerful analogies, suggesting a miracle is God \"interfering\" or adding a new element into the natural system, which nature then accommodates. This is a descriptive model but not the *first* development of specialized terminology.\n\n3.  **Focusing on Early Church Fathers:** The word \"first\" strongly suggests looking at the foundational theologians of the early Church.\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (4th-5th Century):** Augustine is a prime candidate. He wrote extensively on creation, the Fall, and miracles in works like *The City of God* and *On the Literal Meaning of Genesis* (*De Genesi ad litteram*). He was concerned with reconciling a good Creator with a fallen, suffering world and with explaining miracles in a philosophically coherent way.\n\n4.  **Analyzing Augustine's Specific Terminology:**\n    *   Augustine developed the concept of ***rationes seminales***, often translated as \"seminal reasons,\" \"causal reasons,\" or \"seed principles.\"\n    *   **Definition:** Drawing on Stoic philosophy, Augustine proposed that at the initial moment of creation, God embedded all the potentialities for everything that would ever come to be into matter in a latent, seed-like state. The regular, orderly functioning of the world—what we call the laws of nature—is simply the gradual, natural unfolding of these embedded principles over time.\n    *   **Application to Miracles (like the Virgin Birth):** A miracle, in this framework, is not a violation of nature or a change in God's original plan. Instead, it is the activation of a *ratio seminalis* that was placed in creation from the beginning but kept dormant, outside the usual chain of cause and effect. The potential for a virgin to conceive was a principle embedded in human nature by God from the start, only to be activated at a specific, chosen moment in history. It comes from a higher causal order also established by God at creation.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** This is where the framework's power becomes clear. Augustine's system can also describe the changes at the Fall. He argued that the negative aspects of nature (thorns, thistles, predators, pain in childbirth, physical death) were also created as latent potentials (*rationes seminales*) from the beginning. Their activation was made contingent on humanity's free will. In the pre-Fall state, these negative potentials remained dormant. After Adam and Eve's sin, these principles were \"triggered,\" leading to a systemic, lasting alteration in the functioning of the natural world as experienced by humanity. The laws of nature didn't change in their core essence, but their expression was fundamentally altered by the introduction of corruption and disorder unleashed by sin.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Augustine of Hippo is the theologian who fits all criteria. He was the *first* major theologian to develop a *specialized terminology* (*rationes seminales*) that provides a unified explanation for both singular miraculous events (the Virgin Birth) and systemic alterations to the natural order (the consequences of the Fall).\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Christian theologian who first developed this specialized terminology is **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\n### Careful Points and Summary of Analysis\n\n*   **Theologian:** Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD), one of the most influential Church Fathers.\n*   **Specialized Terminology:** ***Rationes seminales*** (Latin for \"seminal reasons\" or \"seed principles\").\n*   **How it Works:** Augustine proposed that God, in the initial act of creation, embedded the latent potential for everything that would ever exist into the world, like seeds. The normal operation of nature is the predictable unfolding of these seeds over time.\n*   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** This miraculous event was not a violation of natural law but the activation of a special *ratio seminalis* embedded in creation from the beginning, which lay dormant until the appointed time. It operated on a higher causal level than everyday biological processes.\n*   **Application to the Fall:** The negative consequences of the Fall (death, decay, pain, thorns, etc.) were also present as latent potentials (*rationes seminales*) from the beginning. They were activated as a consequence of human sin, leading to a systemic and lasting alteration in the state of nature. This explains how the laws of nature could change in their effect and manifestation after a specific historical event.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
