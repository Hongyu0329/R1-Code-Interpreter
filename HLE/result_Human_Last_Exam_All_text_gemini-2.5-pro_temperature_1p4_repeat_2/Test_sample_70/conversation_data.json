    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Describe the flag:** The flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross is off-center, shifted towards the hoist side.\n2.  **Represent as a matrix:** To analyze its linear algebraic properties, we represent the flag as a matrix of numerical values. Each color is assigned a unique, non-zero number to satisfy the condition that the rank is maximal. Let Red = R and White = W, where R ≠ W, and R, W ≠ 0.\n3.  **Identify the row types:** When looking at the rows of the flag matrix, there are two distinct types of patterns:\n    *   **Type A:** Rows that are entirely white, corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross. A vector for this row would be `[W, W, W, ..., W]`.\n    *   **Type B:** Rows that pass through the red field and the vertical part of the white cross. A vector for this row would be `[R, ..., R, W, R, ..., R]`.\n4.  **Determine linear independence:** We need to find the maximum number of linearly independent rows.\n    *   All rows of Type A are identical (or scalar multiples of each other), so they contribute only one vector to a basis. Let's call this vector `v_A`.\n    *   All rows of Type B are also identical, contributing another vector to a basis. Let's call this vector `v_B`.\n    *   Now, we check if `v_A` and `v_B` are linearly independent. Is there a scalar `k` such that `v_B = k * v_A`?\n        *   `[R, ..., W, ..., R] = k * [W, ..., W, ..., W]`\n        *   This would require `R = k * W` and `W = k * W`.\n        *   The second equation (`W = k*W`), since `W` is non-zero, implies `k=1`.\n        *   Substituting `k=1` into the first equation gives `R = W`.\n        *   However, we assigned different values to the colors, so `R ≠ W`. This is a contradiction.\n    *   Therefore, `v_A` and `v_B` are linearly independent.\n5.  **Conclusion for Denmark:** Since the flag's design produces exactly two linearly independent row types, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Step 2: Find African Flags with a Rank of 2\n\nWe are looking for flags of African nations whose matrix representation also has a rank of 2.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** Flags with only horizontal stripes of solid color (e.g., Botswana, Gabon) or only vertical stripes of solid color (e.g., Nigeria, Ivory Coast) will have a rank of 1. All rows in these flags are scalar multiples of a single row vector.\n*   **High-Rank Flags (Rank > 2):** Flags with complex patterns, such as diagonal stripes (e.g., Tanzania, Namibia), multiple complex emblems (e.g., Eswatini), or emblems whose geometry creates several distinct and linearly independent row patterns (e.g., Somalia's star, Algeria's crescent), will have a rank greater than 2.\n\nWe need to find flags whose designs are simple enough to produce exactly two linearly independent row types. This generally happens in two cases:\n\n**Case A: A simple block design**\nA design that is partitioned in a way that creates exactly two different horizontal patterns.\n\n*   **Benin:** The flag has a vertical green band on the hoist side and two horizontal bands (yellow over red) on the fly side.\n    *   The top half of the flag has rows of the pattern `[Green, Green, ..., Yellow, Yellow, ...]`. Let's call this `v1`.\n    *   The bottom half has rows of the pattern `[Green, Green, ..., Red, Red, ...]`. Let's call this `v2`.\n    *   `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent because `Green=k*Green` implies `k=1`, but `Yellow=k*Red` would then mean `Yellow=Red`, which is false. The rank is 2.\n\n*   **Madagascar:** This flag has the same structure as Benin's, with a vertical white band and two horizontal bands of red over green. By the same logic, its rank is 2.\n\n**Case B: A Rank-1 background with a simple central emblem**\nA flag with a simple background (like a bicolour) and a central emblem whose shape and color are simple enough to only introduce one additional dimension to the rank.\n\n*   **Angola:** The flag has two horizontal bands, red over black. The background alone would have a rank of 1. In the center is a yellow emblem (machete and gear-half).\n    *   The row types are: pure red (`v_R`), pure black (`v_K`), red with yellow emblem (`v_RY`), and black with yellow emblem (`v_KY`).\n    *   `v_K` is a scalar multiple of `v_R`, so they are linearly dependent.\n    *   `v_RY` is linearly independent of `v_R`.\n    *   Crucially, `v_KY` can be expressed as a linear combination of `v_R` and `v_RY`. The basis for all row types is `{v_R, v_RY}`. The rank is 2.\n\n*   **Burkina Faso:** The flag has two horizontal bands, red over green, with a central yellow star. The analysis is identical to that of Angola. The basis vectors are a plain background row (e.g., all red) and a row passing through the emblem (e.g., red with a yellow section). All other row types are linear combinations of these two. The rank is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the following African national flags have the same linear algebraic rank (rank 2) as the flag of Denmark:\n\n*   Angola\n*   Benin\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Madagascar\n\n<<<Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Madagascar>>>"
