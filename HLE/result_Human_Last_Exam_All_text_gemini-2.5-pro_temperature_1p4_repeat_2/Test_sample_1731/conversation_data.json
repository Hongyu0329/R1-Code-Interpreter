    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for the Bose case of light quanta using the principles of Large Deviation Theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Connecting Large Deviation Theory and Statistical Mechanics**\n\n*   **Core Principle:** Large Deviation Theory (LDT) mathematically describes the probability of rare events. In the context of statistical mechanics, the \"rare event\" is the spontaneous fluctuation of a system into a macroscopic state (macrostate) that is not the equilibrium state.\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem:** Sanov's theorem states that the probability of the empirical distribution of a large number of random samples deviating from the true underlying distribution is exponentially small, with the rate of decay given by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The physical interpretation is that the most probable macrostate is the one that maximizes the statistical entropy ($S=k_B \\ln W$, where W is the number of microstates). This Principle of Maximum Entropy is a direct consequence of the LDT framework.\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem:** This theorem deals with the probability of the empirical average (e.g., mean energy) deviating from its expected value. The rate function in Cramer's theorem is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment-generating function. This mathematical structure is perfectly mirrored in thermodynamics by the Legendre transforms that connect different thermodynamic potentials (e.g., internal energy and free energy).\n\nThus, \"using\" these theorems means applying the Principle of Maximum Entropy to find the most probable (i.e., equilibrium) state of the system.\n\n**2. Defining the System and its Entropy**\n\n*   **System:** We are considering a gas of light quanta (photons) in a volume V.\n*   **Properties of Photons:** Photons are bosons, meaning they are indistinguishable particles and multiple photons can occupy the same quantum state. Critically, the number of photons is not conserved (they can be emitted and absorbed), which implies their chemical potential is zero ($\\mu=0$).\n*   **Bose-Einstein Entropy:** For a macrostate defined by having $N_j$ bosons in an energy level $\\epsilon_j$ with $g_j$ degenerate states, the number of corresponding microstates (ways to arrange them) is $W_j = \\binom{N_j + g_j - 1}{N_j}$. The total number of microstates is $W_{BE} = \\prod_j W_j$. The entropy is given by Boltzmann's principle, $S = k_B \\ln W_{BE}$. Using Stirling's approximation for large numbers, this simplifies to:\n    $S = k_B \\sum_j \\left[ (N_j+g_j)\\ln(N_j+g_j) - N_j \\ln N_j - g_j \\ln g_j \\right]$\n\n**3. Maximizing Entropy to Find the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe find the equilibrium state by maximizing the entropy $S$ subject to the macroscopic constraints.\n*   **Constraint:** The total mean energy of the system is a constant, $U$.\n    $U = \\sum_j N_j \\epsilon_j$\n*   **Lagrange Multipliers:** We maximize the function $F = S/k_B - \\beta(U - \\sum_j N_j \\epsilon_j)$, where $\\beta$ is a Lagrange multiplier.\n*   **Maximization:** We set the partial derivative with respect to each $N_j$ to zero: $\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N_j} = 0$.\n    $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial N_j} \\left( \\frac{S}{k_B} \\right) - \\beta \\epsilon_j = 0$\n    This calculation yields:\n    $\\ln \\left( \\frac{N_j+g_j}{N_j} \\right) = \\beta \\epsilon_j$\n*   **Equilibrium Distribution:** Solving for the average number of particles $N_j$ gives the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons:\n    $N_j = \\frac{g_j}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_j} - 1}$\n    The Lagrange multiplier $\\beta$ is identified with the inverse temperature, $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$.\n\n**4. Calculating the Equilibrium Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo find the value of U, we substitute the equilibrium distribution back into the energy constraint equation and integrate over all possible energies.\n*   **Density of States:** For photons in a 3D box of volume $V$, the number of states with energy between $\\epsilon$ and $\\epsilon+d\\epsilon$ is given by the density of states, $g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} d\\epsilon$. (Here $\\hbar = h/2\\pi$ is the reduced Planck constant and $c$ is the speed of light).\n*   **Integral for U:** We replace the sum with an integral:\n    $U = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\frac{g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\frac{V \\epsilon^2}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} d\\epsilon = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n*   **Evaluation:** This is a standard integral. By substituting $x = \\beta \\epsilon$, the integral becomes:\n    $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n    The value of the definite integral is $\\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n*   **Final Result for U:** Substituting this back gives the total energy:\n    $U = \\frac{V}{\\pi^2 (\\hbar c)^3} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15\\beta^4} = \\frac{\\pi^2 V}{15 (\\hbar c)^3 \\beta^4}$\n    Replacing $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, we get the Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation:\n    $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\n\n**5. Calculating the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\n\nWe can find the equilibrium entropy by using a fundamental thermodynamic relation.\n*   **Thermodynamic Relation:** For a system at temperature $T$, volume $V$, and chemical potential $\\mu$, the Gibbs free energy is $G = U - TS + PV$. Since the chemical potential for photons is $\\mu=0$, their Gibbs free energy must be zero.\n    $G = U - TS + PV = 0 \\implies TS = U + PV$\n*   **Radiation Pressure:** For a relativistic gas like photons, the pressure is related to the energy density ($u = U/V$) by $P = u/3 = U/(3V)$.\n*   **Relation between S and U:** Substituting the pressure into the equation for TS:\n    $TS = U + \\left(\\frac{U}{3V}\\right)V = U + \\frac{U}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}U$\n    This gives a simple relationship: $S = \\frac{4U}{3T}$.\n*   **Final Result for S:** Substituting our derived equilibrium energy $U$:\n    $S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4 \\right)$\n    $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for a gas of light quanta (photons) are:\n\n*   **Mean Energy (U):**\n    $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\n\n*   **Entropy (S):**\n    $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$\n\nWhere $V$ is the volume, $T$ is the temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $U = \\frac{\\pi^2 V k_B^4}{15 (\\hbar c)^3} T^4$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 V k_B^4}{45 (\\hbar c)^3} T^3$>>>"
