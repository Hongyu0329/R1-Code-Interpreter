    "Answering this question requires a careful understanding of several concepts from algebraic topology and combinatorial topology, as well as a key theorem about the collapsibility of 2-dimensional complexes.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms in the question:**\n    *   **Standard triangulation of the Möbius band ($M$):** This is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to a Möbius band. A key property is that the Möbius band is a surface that can be embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space ($\\mathbb{R}^3$). Therefore, any of its triangulations, and any subcomplex thereof, can also be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   **Higher dimensional rooted forest $(F,R)$:** While there are several possible definitions for \"higher dimensional trees/forests\", the most standard one in this context is based on homology.\n        *   A **higher dimensional forest** $F$ is a subcomplex of $M$ that is acyclic in all dimensions greater than or equal to 1. That is, its homology groups $H_k(F; \\mathbb{Z})$ are trivial ($0$) for all $k \\ge 1$.\n        *   A **root** $R$ is a subcomplex of $F$ that consists of exactly one vertex for each connected component of $F$. If $F$ is composed of connected components $F_1, F_2, \\ldots, F_m$, then $R$ is a set of vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_m\\}$, where each $v_i$ is a vertex in $F_i$.\n        *   A **rooted forest** is a pair $(F,R)$ satisfying these conditions.\n    *   **Simplicial collapse ($F \\searrow R$):** This is a specific process of simplifying a simplicial complex. An elementary collapse removes a pair of simplices $(\\sigma, \\tau)$ where $\\tau$ is a maximal simplex and its face $\\sigma$ (of codimension 1) is not part of the boundary of any other maximal simplex. A complex $F$ collapses to a subcomplex $R$ if $R$ can be obtained from $F$ by a sequence of elementary collapses. A key property is that if $F \\searrow R$, then $F$ is homotopy equivalent to $R$.\n\n2.  **Relate the definitions to the question:**\n    The question asks for the number of rooted forests $(F,R)$ where $F$ does *not* simplicially collapse onto $R$.\n\n3.  **Analyze a single component of a forest:**\n    Let's consider a single connected component $F_i$ of a forest $F$, with its corresponding root $\\{v_i\\}$.\n    *   From the definition of a forest, we know $H_k(F_i) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 1$.\n    *   Since $F_i$ is also connected ($H_0(F_i) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$), it is **contractible**. A space is contractible if it is path-connected and all its homotopy groups $\\pi_n$ are trivial for $n \\ge 1$. By the Hurewicz theorem, this is equivalent to being path-connected and having all homology groups $H_k$ trivial for $k \\ge 1$.\n    *   So, each connected component of a higher dimensional forest is a contractible simplicial complex.\n\n4.  **Introduce the crucial theorem:**\n    A major result in low-dimensional topology states that **any contractible 2-dimensional simplicial complex that can be embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is simplicially collapsible.**\n    *   As we established, any subcomplex $F_i$ of a triangulation of the Möbius band is a 2-dimensional complex embeddable in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   Since each component $F_i$ is contractible, this theorem implies that each $F_i$ must be **collapsible**.\n\n5.  **Connect collapsibility to the root:**\n    A connected, collapsible simplicial complex can be collapsed to any of its vertices. This means that for each component $F_i$, there exists a sequence of elementary collapses that reduces $F_i$ to the single vertex $\\{v_i\\}$. In our notation, $F_i \\searrow \\{v_i\\}$.\n\n6.  **Extend from a single component to the whole forest:**\n    *   The full forest $F$ is the disjoint union of its connected components: $F = F_1 \\cup F_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup F_m$.\n    *   The root $R$ is the disjoint union of the root vertices: $R = \\{v_1\\} \\cup \\{v_2\\} \\cup \\ldots \\cup \\{v_m\\}$.\n    *   The simplicial collapse of one component $F_i$ only involves simplices within that component. The sets of simplices in different components are disjoint.\n    *   Therefore, we can perform the sequence of collapses for $F_1 \\searrow \\{v_1\\}$, followed by the sequence for $F_2 \\searrow \\{v_2\\}$, and so on for all components.\n    *   Combining these sequences gives a valid sequence of elementary collapses from the entire forest $F$ to the entire root $R$.\n    *   This means that for any rooted forest $(F,R)$, the forest $F$ necessarily simplicially collapses onto the root $R$.\n\n7.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Based on the standard definitions and the key theorem, every higher dimensional rooted forest on the standard triangulation of the Möbius band must simplicially collapse onto its root. Therefore, the number of such forests that **fail** to do so is zero. There are no such counterexamples.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The validity of this answer hinges on the definitions of the terms, particularly \"higher dimensional rooted forest\". The homological definition used here is standard in the field of topological combinatorics.\n*   The argument also relies on the theorem that contractible 2-complexes in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ are collapsible. This is a non-trivial result from piecewise-linear topology but is considered established. Non-collapsible contractible 2-complexes (like the \"dunce hat\") exist, but they cannot be embedded as subcomplexes of a 2-manifold in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n*   The specific structure of the \"standard triangulation\" does not affect the outcome, as long as it is a valid triangulation of a Möbius band, because any such triangulation embeds in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: The step-by-step analysis leads to the conclusion that no rooted forest $(F,R)$ can fail the condition. Thus, the count is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
