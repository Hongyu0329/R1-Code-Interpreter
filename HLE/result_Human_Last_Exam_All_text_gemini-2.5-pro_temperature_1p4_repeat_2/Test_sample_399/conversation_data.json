    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the initial value problem.\n\n**1. Identify the Type of Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nWe can rewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nThis equation is a **separable differential equation** because we can separate the variables $x$ and $t$, moving all terms involving $x$ to one side and all terms involving $t$ to the other.\n\n**2. Separate the Variables**\nTo separate the variables, we divide both sides by $x^2$ and multiply by $dt$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n*   **Careful Point:** When we divide by $x^2$, we assume $x \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t) = 0$ is a solution. If $x(t) = 0$, then $x'(t) = 0$. The right side of the ODE becomes $(t-1) \\cdot 0^2 = 0$. So, $x(t) = 0$ is indeed a solution. However, our initial condition is $x(0) = -8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the zero solution, and it is safe to divide by $x^2$.\n\n**3. Integrate Both Sides**\nNow we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's evaluate each integral:\n*   **Left-hand side:**\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n*   **Right-hand side:**\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\nCombining the results and adding a constant of integration, $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n*   **Careful Point:** It is crucial to include the constant of integration, $C$, as it will be determined by the initial condition.\n\n**4. Apply the Initial Condition**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution to find the value of $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**5. Find the Particular Solution**\nNow, substitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo find $x(t)$, we can first solve for $\\frac{1}{x}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = -\\left(\\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nThen, we take the reciprocal to find $x(t)$:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 8:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{8 \\cdot (-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8})} = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1} $$\nThis is the explicit particular solution.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Value**\nThe question asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
