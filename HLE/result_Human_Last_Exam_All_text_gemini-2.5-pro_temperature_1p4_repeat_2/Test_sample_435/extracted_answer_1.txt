I would predict that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased and more sustained release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 promotes a less differentiated, more persistent memory phenotype with enhanced metabolic fitness, leading to a more durable and potent anti-tumor response.
