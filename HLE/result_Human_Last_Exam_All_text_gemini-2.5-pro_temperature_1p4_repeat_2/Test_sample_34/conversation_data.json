    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**1. Analyze the Scenario**\n\n*   **Game:** 100BB No-Limit Hold'em cash game. This is the standard for discussing poker strategy.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the latest and most powerful position pre-flop. You are guaranteed to act last post-flop, which allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably.\n*   **Action:** Open-raise to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size from late position.\n*   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a key detail. The absence of rake means that even very marginal hands, which might be slightly losing in a raked game, become break-even or slightly profitable. This encourages opening an even wider range of hands.\n*   **Question:** What is the \"worst suited jack\" (JXs) that you *should open*? This means we are looking for the hand at the absolute bottom of the JXs category that is still considered a standard, profitable open-raise.\n\n**2. List and Evaluate the Candidate Hands**\n\nThe category \"suited jacks\" where the second card is lower than the jack consists of the following hands:\n*   J9s\n*   J8s\n*   J7s\n*   J6s\n*   J5s\n*   J4s\n*   J3s\n*   J2s\n\nWe need to determine the weakest hand from this list that still belongs in a button opening range.\n\n**3. Careful Points & Hand Ranking Logic**\n\n*   **Positional Advantage:** The button's positional advantage cannot be overstated. It allows you to realize equity more effectively, bluff more successfully, and control the size of the pot. Because of this, button opening ranges are extremely wide, often 40-50% or more.\n*   **Hand Playability:** The value of these hands comes from several sources:\n    *   **Flush Potential:** All these hands are suited, giving them the ability to make powerful nut-or-near-nut flushes. This is a significant source of their value.\n    *   **High Card Value:** The Jack can make a strong top pair.\n    *   **Straight Potential:** Connectivity (how close the two cards are) determines the hand's ability to make straights. The closer the cards, the better.\n*   **Ranking the Candidates:**\n    *   **J9s, J8s, J7s:** These are the strongest of the group due to better connectivity. J9s is a one-gapper, J8s a two-gapper. They have a decent chance of making straights to go with their flush potential. They are clear opens.\n    *   **J6s vs. J5s:** J5s is generally considered slightly better than J6s. While it has a larger gap (5), it connects with low cards (A-2-3-4) to make a \"wheel\" straight. This adds a little extra playability that J6s lacks. Both are still standard opens from the button.\n    *   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest hands in the group. Their straight potential is very limited. Their value is derived almost entirely from making a flush, a flush draw, or pairing the jack. The kicker (4, 3, or 2) is very weak and will often be dominated if an opponent also has a jack.\n*   **Identifying the \"Worst\":** We are looking for the lowest-ranked hand in this list that is still a standard open. According to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers for a 100BB rake-free game, the button should open an extremely wide range. This range includes *all* suited aces, suited kings, suited queens, and suited jacks.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since all suited jacks from J9s down to J2s are considered standard, profitable opens from the button in this scenario, the \"worst\" one that you should still open is the one with the absolute lowest rank. That hand is Jack-Deuce suited. Its kicker is the weakest, and its straight potential is minimal. It sits at the very bottom of the suited jacks category.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\n1.  Identify all suited jacks to be considered: J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n2.  Recognize that from the button in a rake-free 100BB game, all of these hands are standard opens.\n3.  Determine the objectively worst hand within this group based on kicker strength and connectivity.\n4.  The hand with the lowest kicker and weakest connectivity is Jack-Deuce suited.\n5.  Therefore, J2s is the worst suited jack you should open from the button.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
