    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Threat: Classical vs. Quantum Attacks on Symmetric Keys**\n    *   **Classical Computer Attack:** The most effective general attack against a symmetric key cipher (like AES) is a brute-force search. This involves trying every possible key until the correct one is found. For a key of length 'n' bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would need, on average, 2^(n-1) attempts and at most 2^n attempts. The difficulty of this attack, or its \"security level\", is therefore said to be 'n' bits. For example, AES-128 has a 128-bit security level against classical attacks.\n    *   **Quantum Computer Attack:** An \"arbitrarily powerful\" quantum computer could use **Grover's algorithm** to attack a symmetric key cipher. Grover's algorithm is designed for searching an unsorted database. In this case, the \"database\" is the set of all possible keys.\n\n2.  **Quantify the Impact of Grover's Algorithm**\n    *   Grover's algorithm provides a **quadratic speedup** compared to a classical brute-force search.\n    *   Instead of needing roughly O(2^n) operations like a classical computer, a quantum computer needs only about O(√2^n) operations.\n    *   This can be rewritten as O(2^(n/2)).\n    *   This means that for a symmetric key of length 'n', a quantum computer effectively halves the security level in bits. An n-bit key offers only n/2 bits of security against a quantum attacker.\n\n3.  **Determine the Required Security Level**\n    *   The widely accepted standard for security is a **128-bit security level**. This means that any successful attack would require at least 2^128 computational operations, a number so large that it is considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future, even with quantum computers.\n    *   Our goal is to find a key length 'n' such that the quantum attack complexity is at least 2^128.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Minimum Key Length (n)**\n    *   We set up the equation based on the quantum attack complexity and the desired security level:\n        `Quantum Attack Complexity ≥ Desired Security Level`\n    *   Substituting the values:\n        `2^(n/2) ≥ 2^128`\n    *   To solve for 'n', we can simply compare the exponents:\n        `n/2 ≥ 128`\n    *   Multiplying both sides by 2:\n        `n ≥ 256`\n    *   Therefore, a symmetric key needs to be **at least 256 bits long** to provide a 128-bit security level against an attack from an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n*   **Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Keys:** The question is specifically about symmetric keys. The impact of quantum computers on asymmetric cryptography (like RSA or ECC) is much more severe, due to Shor's algorithm, and requires entirely new types of algorithms (Post-Quantum Cryptography). Grover's algorithm applies to symmetric keys.\n*   **\"Arbitrarily Powerful\":** This means we ignore current technological limitations of building quantum computers and consider only the theoretical capabilities of the algorithms.\n*   **Minimum Requirement:** The question asks for the *minimum* length. While a 512-bit key would also be secure (providing a 256-bit security level), 256 bits is the minimum required to achieve the standard 128-bit security benchmark.\n*   **Security Level Halving:** The key takeaway is that for symmetric ciphers, quantum computers effectively halve the bit security. A 128-bit key becomes 64-bit security (breakable), a 192-bit key becomes 96-bit security (marginal), and a 256-bit key becomes 128-bit security (secure).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nTo achieve the industry standard of 128-bit security against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm (which has a complexity of 2^(n/2)), the key length 'n' must satisfy n/2 = 128. Solving for n gives n = 256.\n\n<<<A>>>"
