    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Group Structure**\n\n*   **Semidihedral Group:** The group in question is the semidihedral group of size 512. A semidihedral group of order $2^n$ is denoted by $SD_{2^n}$.\n*   **Order and Presentation:** For this problem, the order is $512 = 2^9$. So, we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{2^9}$. The standard presentation for this group (for $n \\ge 4$) is:\n    $G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{n-1}} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$\n*   **Substituting n=9:**\n    $n = 9$\n    $2^{n-1} = 2^8 = 256$\n    $2^{n-2} - 1 = 2^7 - 1 = 128 - 1 = 127$\n    So, the presentation for our group $G = SD_{512}$ is:\n    $G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{256} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab = a^{127} \\rangle$\n*   **Elements of the group:** The group $G$ consists of $512$ elements, which can be divided into two types:\n    *   $256$ elements forming a cyclic subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle = \\{a^0, a^1, ..., a^{255}\\}$.\n    *   $256$ elements of the form $a^i b$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 255\\}$.\n\n**2. Understand Power Subgroups**\n\n*   **Definition:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a \"power subgroup\" if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$. This set is denoted by $G^k$.\n    $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$\n*   **Objective:** We need to find all possible distinct subgroups that can be formed this way and count them.\n\n**3. Analyze the Set of k-th Powers, $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the set $G^k$ for different values of $k$. The exponent of $G=SD_{512}$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its elements. The orders of elements in $\\langle a \\rangle$ are powers of 2 up to 256. The elements $a^ib$ have order 2 or 4. Thus, the exponent of $G$ is 256. We only need to consider $k$ values that give distinct sets $G^k$. It's natural to divide the analysis based on whether $k$ is odd or even.\n\n**Case 1: k is an odd integer**\n\n*   When $k$ is odd, it is coprime to the exponent of the group, which is $\\exp(G)=256$.\n*   For any finite group $G$, if $\\gcd(k, \\exp(G)) = 1$, the map $\\phi: g \\mapsto g^k$ is a permutation of the elements of $G$.\n*   This means that the set of $k$-th powers is the entire group: $G^k = G$.\n*   Since this is true for any odd $k$ (e.g., $k=1, 3, 5, ...$), they all result in the same power subgroup, which is $G$ itself.\n*   **Careful Point:** We have found one power subgroup: $G$.\n\n**Case 2: k is an even integer**\n\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$. We need to compute $g^k$ for every $g \\in G$.\n\n*   **If $g$ is in the cyclic subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$:**\n    Let $g = a^i$. Then $g^k = (a^i)^k = a^{ik}$. The set of all such elements as $i$ varies from 0 to 255 is $\\{a^{ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{256}\\} = \\langle a^k \\rangle$.\n\n*   **If $g$ is of the form $a^i b$:**\n    We need to compute $(a^i b)^k$. First, let's find $(a^i b)^2$. Using the relation $bab = a^{127}$, which implies $ba = a^{127}b$:\n    $(a^i b)^2 = a^i b a^i b = a^i (ba^i) b = a^i (a^{127i}b) b = a^i a^{127i} b^2 = a^{128i}$.\n    Since $k$ is even ($k=2m$), we can write:\n    $(a^i b)^k = (a^i b)^{2m} = ((a^i b)^2)^m = (a^{128i})^m = a^{128im}$.\n    Noting that $k=2m$, we have $m=k/2$, so:\n    $(a^i b)^k = a^{128 i (k/2)} = a^{64ik}$.\n    The set of all such elements is $\\{a^{64ik} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{256}\\} = \\langle a^{64k} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Combining the results for even k:**\n    The full set $G^k$ is the union of the powers from both types of elements:\n    $G^k = \\{a^{ik}\\} \\cup \\{a^{64ik}\\} = \\langle a^k \\rangle \\cup \\langle a^{64k} \\rangle$.\n*   **Careful Point:** Is this union a subgroup? Since $64k$ is a multiple of $k$, the generator $a^{64k}$ is a power of $a^k$. Therefore, the subgroup $\\langle a^{64k} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle a^k \\rangle$. The union is just the larger subgroup:\n    $G^k = \\langle a^k \\rangle$.\n*   So, for any even integer $k$, the power subgroup $G^k$ is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle a^k \\rangle$.\n\n**4. Count the Distinct Subgroups from Case 2**\n\nWe need to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed as $\\langle a^k \\rangle$ where $k$ is an even integer.\n\n*   The subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ is cyclic of order 256. Its subgroups are of the form $\\langle a^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 256. The divisors are $1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 256$.\n*   The subgroup generated by $a^k$ is the same as the subgroup generated by $a^{\\gcd(k, 256)}$. So, we need to find the possible values of $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ where $k$ is even.\n*   Let's analyze the possible values of $d$. Since $k$ is even, $k$ is divisible by 2. Thus, $\\gcd(k, 256)$ must also be divisible by 2.\n*   This means $d$ must be an even divisor of 256.\n*   The divisors of 256 are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$.\n*   The even divisors are $2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^7, 2^8$. These are the values: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.\n*   Can we generate a subgroup for each of these values of $d$? Yes. For any $d=2^j$ with $j \\in \\{1, ..., 8\\}$, we can simply choose $k=d$. Then $\\gcd(k, 256) = \\gcd(d, 256) = d$.\n*   This gives us 8 distinct cyclic subgroups:\n    1.  $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n    2.  $\\langle a^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n    3.  $\\langle a^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n    4.  $\\langle a^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n    5.  $\\langle a^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n    6.  $\\langle a^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n    7.  $\\langle a^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n    8.  $\\langle a^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n*   **Careful Point:** The subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle = \\langle a^1 \\rangle$ cannot be formed when $k$ is even, because $\\gcd(k, 256)$ is always even.\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nWe combine the results from all cases:\n*   From Case 1 (k is odd), we get 1 power subgroup: $G = SD_{512}$.\n*   From Case 2 (k is even), we get 8 distinct cyclic power subgroups: $\\langle a^2 \\rangle, \\langle a^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle a^{256} \\rangle$.\n\nThese two sets of subgroups are disjoint. The group $G$ is non-cyclic, while the other 8 are cyclic. The 8 cyclic subgroups are distinct because they all have different orders.\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 1 (from odd k) + 8 (from even k) = 9.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{9}$.\n<<<9>>>"
