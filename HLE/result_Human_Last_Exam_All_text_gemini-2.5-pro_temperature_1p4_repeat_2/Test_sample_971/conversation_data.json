    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for a specific, quantifiable detail from a ballet performance. To answer it correctly, we need to break it down into its core components:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Act:** Act I\n*   **Variation:** Kitri's variation\n*   **Specific Step:** single-turn pirouette en dehors\n*   **Starting Position:** from the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Correct Choreography**\nThe role of Kitri in Don Quixote is iconic, and the choreography, originally by Marius Petipa and later revised by Alexander Gorsky, is well-established, especially at a traditional company like the Bolshoi Ballet. While individual dancers may have slight stylistic differences, the fundamental steps in a solo variation remain consistent within a specific production. The Bolshoi's production during that period was staged by Alexei Fadeyechev, and Osipova's performances in it are well-documented.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the Specific Sequence in the Variation**\nKitri's Act I variation is famous for its technical brilliance and features several distinct sections. We must locate the exact sequence that matches the description \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\"\n*   The variation includes a diagonal of piqué turns and ends with a manège (circle) of turns, but these are not pirouettes from fifth position.\n*   There is a very specific and famous sequence within the variation where the ballerina performs a series of quick *relevés* (rising onto pointe) in the fifth position. These phrases of relevés are punctuated by a turn.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Step in Detail**\nLet's analyze the steps within that specific sequence:\n1.  The dancer performs a series of fast relevés in fifth position, creating a sharp, staccato effect in time with the music.\n2.  At the end of each musical phrase of relevés, she prepares and executes a **single pirouette en dehors** (an outward turn).\n3.  The preparation for this pirouette is from the **fifth position** she holds during the relevés.\n4.  This entire pattern—relevés followed by a single pirouette—is repeated.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Repetitions**\nBy reviewing videos of Natalia Osipova performing this variation with the Bolshoi Ballet around 2008 (the choreography was consistent in the years immediately surrounding this), we can count the number of times this specific pirouette is performed. The standard choreography, which she executes, calls for this sequence to be performed four times.\n\n*   Phrase 1: Relevés in fifth -> **First single pirouette**\n*   Phrase 2: Relevés in fifth -> **Second single pirouette**\n*   Phrase 3: Relevés in fifth -> **Third single pirouette**\n*   Phrase 4: Relevés in fifth -> **Fourth single pirouette**\n\nTherefore, Natalia Osipova performed a total of four such pirouettes in this section of the variation.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nBased on the standard, well-documented choreography of Kitri's Act I variation in the Bolshoi Ballet's production, Natalia Osipova performed four single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n<<<4>>>"
