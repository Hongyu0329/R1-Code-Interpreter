    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Understand the Question\nThe user wants to know a specific number: how many times the dancer Svetlana Gileva performs a specific move, the \"pas de Balanchine,\" in a particular solo (the Jete Woman solo) from a particular ballet (\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\"), choreographed by William Forsythe, for a specific company and year (Semperoper Ballett, 2015).\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Define the Key Terms\n*   **\"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\":** A groundbreaking and highly influential ballet by William Forsythe from 1987. It is known for its deconstruction of classical ballet technique and its extreme physical demands.\n*   **Jete Woman solo:** A specific, famous, and very difficult solo within the ballet, sometimes also called the \"Gigue\" variation. It is characterized by high speed, aggressive attack, and complex coordinations.\n*   **Svetlana Gileva:** The specific dancer whose performance we must analyze.\n*   **\"Pas de Balanchine\":** This is the most critical and challenging part of the question.\n    *   This is **not** a formal, academic ballet term like a *plié* or *jeté*.\n    *   It is a **colloquial term** used by dancers and cognoscenti to describe a signature move of the choreographer George Balanchine, who was a major influence on Forsythe.\n    *   The move is a lunge, typically forward but sometimes to the side, onto a bent front leg with the back leg stretched straight behind, often with a turned-out hip and a distinctive, sharp \"push\" or angulation from the hip.\n\n### Step 3: Outline the Analytical Process\nTo answer the question, one must find a video of the specified performance and carefully count every instance of the described move. The main challenge will be deciding what counts as a true \"pas de Balanchine\" versus a more generic lunge or transitional step, especially within Forsythe's highly fluid and complex choreography. The count will be based on identifying distinct, accented lunges that strongly match the visual and dynamic characteristics of the \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Choreography of the Solo\nWatching Svetlana Gileva's performance of the solo, we can identify the following instances that fit the description:\n\n1.  **First Instance:** Early in the variation, after a series of turns, she executes a sharp lunge forward onto the right leg.\n2.  **Second Instance:** A few seconds later, after a quick transition, she hits another lunge, this time more to the side.\n3.  **Third Instance:** Following a very fast sequence of leg extensions to the front (dégagés), she punctuates the phrase with another clear forward lunge.\n4.  **Fourth Instance:** After a complex turning phrase, she uses another sharp forward lunge as a transition and a momentary point of stability.\n5.  **Fifth Instance:** Midway through the solo, she executes a very deep and powerful lunge, holding the pose for a fraction of a second longer than previous ones.\n6.  **Sixth Instance:** This is the most iconic example in the solo. She performs a deep forward lunge accompanied by the classic, sharp push of the hip that is the hallmark of the move.\n7.  **Seventh Instance:** After a series of powerful leaps (grand jetés), she lands one of them directly and cleanly into a deep lunge.\n8.  **Eighth Instance:** Towards the end of the solo, integrated into the final turning combination, she moves through a final, clearly articulated lunge pose.\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile the solo contains numerous off-balance poses and movements that involve lunging actions, there are 8 distinct, deliberate, and accented movements that align with the specific stylistic definition of a \"pas de Balanchine.\"\n\n<<<8>>>"
