    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions of exactly 5 symbols.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n- **Symbols Allowed:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n- **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n- **Goal:** Find the number of unique, syntactically valid expressions that evaluate to **True**.\n- **Operator Precedence:** `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|` (lowest).\n- **Symbol Repetition:** Allowed.\n\n\"An expression that can be written\" implies that we count unique strings of symbols that form valid expressions. For example, `T&T&T` and `T|T|T` are different written expressions. Similarly, `T&F` and `(T)&F` are different written expressions because they are different strings.\n\n### Step 2: Identifying All Valid Syntactic Structures of Length 5\nLet's systematically identify all possible valid string patterns (structures) of length 5. We can group them by whether they contain parentheses.\nLet `v` be an operand (T/F), `b` be a binary operator (&/|), and `u` be the unary operator (!).\n\n**Group A: Expressions without Parentheses**\n\n1.  **`v b v b v`**: Three operands and two binary operators. The evaluation order depends on the precedence of the operators.\n    *   Example: `T & F | T` evaluates as `(T & F) | T`.\n2.  **`u u v b v`**: Two unary operators, one operand, a binary operator, and a second operand. `u u v` is evaluated first.\n    *   Example: `!!T & F` evaluates as `(!(!T)) & F`.\n3.  **`v b u u v`**: The mirror of the previous structure.\n    *   Example: `T | !!F` evaluates as `T | (!(!F))`.\n4.  **`u v b u v`**: Two unary-prefixed operands and a binary operator.\n    *   Example: `!T & !F` evaluates as `(!T) & (!F)`.\n5.  **`u u u u v`**: An operand preceded by four unary operators.\n    *   Example: `!!!!T`.\n\n**Group B: Expressions with Parentheses**\nParentheses must be balanced and enclose a valid sub-expression.\n\n6.  **`( v b v )`**: A standard binary operation enclosed in parentheses.\n    *   Example: `(T | F)`.\n7.  **`((v))`**: An operand nested in two pairs of parentheses.\n    *   Example: `((T))`.\n8.  **`(!!v)`**: A doubly-negated operand in parentheses.\n    *   Example: `(!!T)`.\n9.  **`!(!v)`**: A negated, parenthesized, negated operand. The string is `u(uv)`.\n    *   Example: `!(!T)`.\n10. **`!!(v)`**: An operand in parentheses, preceded by two negations. The string is `uu(v)`.\n    *   Example: `!!(T)`.\n11. **`!((v))`**: A doubly-parenthesized operand, which is then negated.\n    *   Example: `!((F))`.\n12. **`(v) b v`**: An expression where the left operand is a parenthesized variable.\n    *   Example: `(T) & F`.\n13. **`v b (v)`**: An expression where the right operand is a parenthesized variable.\n    *   Example: `T & (F)`.\n\nThese 13 structures represent all unique, valid, and non-overlapping ways to form a 5-symbol boolean expression.\n\n### Step 3: Counting TRUE Expressions for Each Structure\n\nNow we count how many ways each structure can be instantiated to form an expression that evaluates to `True`.\n\n1.  **`v b v b v`**: (18 true expressions)\n    *   `v1 & v2 & v3`: True only for `T&T&T` (1 case).\n    *   `v1 & v2 | v3`: True if `v3=T` (4 cases) or if `v3=F` and `v1&v2=T` (1 case, `T&T|F`). Total 5 cases.\n    *   `v1 | v2 & v3`: True if `v1=T` (4 cases) or if `v1=F` and `v2&v3=T` (1 case, `F|T&T`). Total 5 cases.\n    *   `v1 | v2 | v3`: True unless all are F. `2^3 - 1 = 7` cases.\n    *   Total: `1 + 5 + 5 + 7 = 18`.\n\n2.  **`u u v b v`**: `!!v1 b v2` simplifies to `v1 b v2`. (4 true expressions)\n    *   `&`: `T&T` (1 case).\n    *   `|`: `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T` (3 cases).\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n3.  **`v b u u v`**: `v1 b !!v2` also simplifies to `v1 b v2`. (4 true expressions)\n    *   Total: `4`.\n\n4.  **`u v b u v`**: `!v1 b !v2`. (4 true expressions)\n    *   `&`: `!v1 & !v2` is true if `v1=F, v2=F` (1 case).\n    *   `|`: `!v1 | !v2` is true unless `v1=T, v2=T` (3 cases).\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n5.  **`u u u u v`**: `!!!!v` simplifies to `v`. True only for `v=T`. (1 true expression: `!!!!T`).\n\n6.  **`( v b v )`**: (4 true expressions)\n    *   `(v1 & v2)`: True only for `(T&T)` (1 case).\n    *   `(v1 | v2)`: True for `(T|T), (T|F), (F|T)` (3 cases).\n    *   Total: `1 + 3 = 4`.\n\n7.  **`((v))`**: Simplifies to `v`. True only for `v=T`. (1 true expression: `((T))`).\n\n8.  **`(!!v)`**: Simplifies to `v`. True only for `v=T`. (1 true expression: `(!!T)`).\n\n9.  **`!(!v)`**: Simplifies to `v`. True only for `v=T`. (1 true expression: `!(!T)`).\n\n10. **`!!(v)`**: Simplifies to `v`. True only for `v=T`. (1 true expression: `!!(T)`).\n\n11. **`!((v))`**: Simplifies to `!v`. True only for `v=F`. (1 true expression: `!((F))`).\n\n12. **`(v) b v`**: `(v1) b v2` simplifies to `v1 b v2`. Same logic as structure 2. (4 true expressions).\n\n13. **`v b (v)`**: `v1 b (v2)` simplifies to `v1 b v2`. Same logic as structure 2. (4 true expressions).\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nSumming the counts from all the distinct structures:\n- `18` (from `v b v b v`)\n- `4` (from `u u v b v`)\n- `4` (from `v b u u v`)\n- `4` (from `u v b u v`)\n- `1` (from `u u u u v`)\n- `4` (from `(v b v)`)\n- `1` (from `((v))`)\n- `1` (from `(!!v)`)\n- `1` (from `!(!v)`)\n- `1` (from `!!(v)`)\n- `1` (from `!((v))`)\n- `4` (from `(v) b v`)\n- `4` (from `v b (v)`)\n\nTotal = 18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 48."
