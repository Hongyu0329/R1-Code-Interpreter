    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Determine the molecular formula and atom count of toluene.**\nToluene has the chemical formula C₇H₈.\n*   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n*   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n**Step 2: Understand the 6-31G basis set notation.**\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The notation describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to analyze its meaning for each type of atom in the molecule (Carbon and Hydrogen).\n\n*   **The hyphen (`-`)** separates the description of the core orbitals from the valence orbitals.\n*   **The number before the hyphen (`6`)** describes the core orbitals. It means each core orbital is represented by a single CGF, which is a sum (a contraction) of 6 primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (`31`)** describe the valence orbitals. This indicates that the valence shell is \"split\" into two parts to provide more flexibility.\n    *   The first number (`3`) means the \"inner\" part of the valence shell is represented by one CGF, which is a contraction of 3 PGFs.\n    *   The second number (`1`) means the \"outer\" part of the valence shell is represented by another CGF, which consists of a single PGF.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a single Carbon atom.**\nA Carbon atom (atomic number 6) has the electron configuration 1s²2s²2p².\n*   **Core orbital:** 1s orbital.\n*   **Valence orbitals:** 2s orbital and three 2p orbitals (2pₓ, 2pᵧ, 2p₂).\n\nLet's count the CGFs for Carbon using the 6-31G rules:\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** The `6-` part applies here. The 1s core orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):** The `-31G` part applies. The valence shell is split into two sets of functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** This part provides one function for the 2s orbital and one set of functions for the 2p orbitals. This means: 1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = **4 CGFs**.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** This part provides a second, more diffuse set of functions. This means: 1 s-type CGF + 3 p-type CGFs = **4 CGFs**.\n*   **Total for one Carbon atom:** 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a single Hydrogen atom.**\nA Hydrogen atom (atomic number 1) has the electron configuration 1s¹. It only has a valence orbital.\n*   **Core orbitals:** None.\n*   **Valence orbital:** 1s orbital.\n\nLet's count the CGFs for Hydrogen using the 6-31G rules:\n*   **Core:** Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` part of the notation is irrelevant.\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** The `-31G` part applies. The 1s valence orbital is split into two functions.\n    *   **Inner Valence (`3`):** This provides **1 CGF** for the 1s orbital.\n    *   **Outer Valence (`1`):** This provides a second **1 CGF** for the 1s orbital.\n*   **Total for one Hydrogen atom:** 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = **2 CGFs**.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C₇H₈).**\nNow we multiply the per-atom counts by the number of atoms in the molecule and sum the results.\n*   Total CGFs from Carbon: 7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n*   Total CGFs from Hydrogen: 8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n*   **Total for Toluene:** 63 + 16 = 79 CGFs\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* Gaussian functions (CGFs), not the underlying *primitive* Gaussian functions (PGFs). The numbers in \"6-31G\" refer to the number of PGFs used to build the CGFs, but the total count we need is of the final CGFs.\n*   **Atom-Specific Rules:** The rules for interpreting the basis set are different for hydrogen (first-row element) and carbon (second-row element). Hydrogen has no core electrons, so only the valence part of the notation applies.\n*   **Valence Splitting:** For Carbon, the `-31G` split applies to the entire valence shell (both 2s and 2p orbitals). It does not mean the 2s gets two functions and the 2p gets two functions. Instead, it provides two full sets of valence basis functions (one inner s+p set, one outer s+p set).\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nTotal Functions = (Number of C atoms × CGFs per C) + (Number of H atoms × CGFs per H)\nTotal Functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal Functions = 63 + 16\nTotal Functions = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
