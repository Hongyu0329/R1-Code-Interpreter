    "Answering the question step-by-step:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A set of 128 vertices and a collection of edges between pairs of these vertices.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices in a graph where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size $k$ is a complete graph $K_k$.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and a subset of vertices $W \\subseteq V$, the subgraph induced by $W$ is $G[W] = (W, E')$, where $E'$ consists of all edges in $E$ that have both endpoints in $W$.\n*   **Clique size that can appear as an induced subgraph:** An integer $k$ is a possible clique size if there exists a subset of vertices $W$ of size $k$ such that the induced subgraph $G[W]$ is a complete graph ($K_k$).\n*   **The Goal:** We are looking for a single graph $G$ on 128 vertices. Let $S(G)$ be the set of all integers $k$ for which $G$ has an induced clique of size $k$. We want to find the maximum possible value of $|S(G)|$ over all possible graphs $G$ on 128 vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the set of induced clique sizes to the clique number**\n\nLet $G$ be any graph on $n=128$ vertices. Let $\\omega(G)$ be the clique number of $G$, which is the size of the largest clique in $G$.\n\nLet's analyze the set of induced clique sizes, $S(G)$.\n\n1.  **Any induced clique size must be less than or equal to $\\omega(G)$:**\n    If $k \\in S(G)$, it means there is a subset of vertices $W$ with $|W|=k$ such that $G[W]$ is a $K_k$. This means $W$ is a clique of size $k$. The clique number $\\omega(G)$ is the size of the largest possible clique in $G$. Therefore, $k$ cannot be greater than $\\omega(G)$. This implies $S(G) \\subseteq \\{1, 2, \\ldots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\n2.  **Any size from 1 to $\\omega(G)$ is an achievable induced clique size:**\n    Let $W_{max}$ be a clique of maximum size in $G$, so $|W_{max}| = \\omega(G)$. Now, consider any integer $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le \\omega(G)$. We can choose a subset $W' \\subseteq W_{max}$ with $|W'| = k$. Let's examine the induced subgraph $G[W']$. The vertices of $G[W']$ are the vertices in $W'$. The edges of $G[W']$ are all the edges of $G$ with both endpoints in $W'$. Since $W'$ is a subset of the clique $W_{max}$, every pair of distinct vertices in $W'$ is connected by an edge in $G$. Therefore, $G[W']$ is a complete graph on $k$ vertices, i.e., a $K_k$. This shows that for any $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, \\omega(G)\\}$, $k$ is an induced clique size. So, $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, \\omega(G)\\} \\subseteq S(G)$.\n\nCombining these two points, we conclude that for any graph $G$, the set of different clique sizes that appear as induced subgraphs is precisely $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, \\omega(G)\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Transform the problem**\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is $|S(G)| = \\omega(G)$. Therefore, the problem \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is equivalent to the problem \"determine the maximum possible clique number $\\omega(G)$ for a graph on $n=128$ vertices\".\n\n**Step 4: Solve the transformed problem**\n\nWe want to find the maximum value of $\\omega(G)$ for a graph $G$ on $n=128$ vertices.\n\n*   The size of a clique in a graph cannot exceed the total number of vertices in the graph. So, for any graph $G$ on 128 vertices, $\\omega(G) \\le 128$.\n*   We need to check if this upper bound is achievable. Can we construct a graph $G$ on 128 vertices with $\\omega(G) = 128$?\n    Yes, the complete graph $K_{128}$ is a graph on 128 vertices where all pairs of vertices are connected. The set of all 128 vertices forms a clique. Thus, for $G = K_{128}$, we have $\\omega(K_{128}) = 128$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices is 128. Since the number of different induced clique sizes is equal to the clique number, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is also 128.\n\nThis maximum is achieved by the complete graph $K_{128}$. For $G=K_{128}$, the clique number is $\\omega(K_{128})=128$. The set of induced clique sizes is $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, 128\\}$. The number of such sizes is 128. Any other graph $G$ on 128 vertices has $\\omega(G) \\le 128$, so it cannot have more than 128 different induced clique sizes."
