    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define a Coordinate System and the First Cube**\nLet's place the first cube, Cube A, in a standard position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. A convenient placement is the unit cube, whose vertices are at coordinates (x, y, z) where each coordinate is either 0 or 1.\nThis means Cube A is the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n*   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\nThe side length of this cube is 1, as specified in the question.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Shift Operation**\nThe second cube, Cube B, is shifted relative to Cube A. The shift is described as \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\".\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** For the cube at [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1], a main diagonal connects opposite vertices, for example, the origin (0,0,0) and the point (1,1,1). The direction of this diagonal can be represented by the vector **d** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Interpreting \"Shifted by 1/2\":** This phrase can be ambiguous.\n    *   **Interpretation A:** The shift could be a vector where each component is 1/2, i.e., the shift vector is **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This vector is parallel to the main diagonal direction **d**, so it qualifies as a shift \"along the main diagonal\". The magnitude (distance) of this shift is ||**s**|| = √( (1/2)² + (1/2)² + (1/2)² ) = √(3/4) = √3 / 2.\n    *   **Interpretation B:** The shift *distance* could be 1/2. In this case, the shift vector would be **s** = (1/2) * (unit vector in direction **d**) = (1/2) * ( (1,1,1) / √3 ) = ( 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3) ).\n\n*   **Choosing the Correct Interpretation:** Problems of this nature, especially when not specifying further, typically use round numbers and intend for an elegant solution. Interpretation A leads to simple coordinates and a clean, rational answer. Interpretation B leads to coordinates involving irrational numbers and a much more complex final expression. Therefore, Interpretation A is the most plausible and standard interpretation for this problem. We will proceed with the shift vector being **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n\n**Step 3: Define the Second Cube**\nCube B is obtained by shifting every point of Cube A by the vector **s** = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). So, for any point (x', y', z') in Cube B, its coordinates are defined by shifting the boundaries of Cube A:\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ x' ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ y' ≤ 3/2\n*   0 + 1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 1 + 1/2  =>  1/2 ≤ z' ≤ 3/2\n\n**Step 4: Find the Region of Intersection**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the set of all points (x, y, z) that satisfy the conditions for *both* Cube A and Cube B. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND in [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection of these two intervals is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND in [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [1/2, 1].\n*   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in [0, 1] AND in [1/2, 3/2]. The intersection is [1/2, 1].\n\nSo, the volume of intersection is a region defined by:\n*   1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe region of intersection is a rectangular prism (specifically, a cube). We can find its volume by calculating the length of its sides.\n\n*   Length in the x-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Length in the y-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n*   Length in the z-direction: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2\n\nThe volume (V) of the intersection is the product of these side lengths:\nV = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8\n\n### Careful Points\n1.  **Ambiguity of the problem statement:** The most critical step is correctly interpreting \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". As analyzed, assuming a component-wise shift of 1/2 is the most reasonable interpretation that leads to a clean answer, typical for such problems.\n2.  **Coordinate system choice:** Placing the first cube at the origin simplifies the arithmetic. The final volume is independent of this initial placement.\n3.  **Visualizing the result:** Cube A can be thought of as occupying the space from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). The center of Cube A is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). Cube B is shifted such that its \"starting\" corner is at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). The intersection is therefore the small cube with opposite corners at (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and (1, 1, 1). This confirms the shape is a cube of side length 1/2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
