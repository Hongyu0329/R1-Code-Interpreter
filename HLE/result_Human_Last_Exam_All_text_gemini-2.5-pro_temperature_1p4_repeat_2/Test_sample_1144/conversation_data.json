    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Identify the goal and the given information.**\n*   **Goal:** Find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum itself, i.e., $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.\n*   **System:** An electron in the first Bohr orbit ($n=1$).\n*   **Given:** The uncertainty in the electron's position, $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm}$.\n\n**Step 2: List the necessary physical principles and constants.**\n*   **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position ($\\Delta x$) to the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$). The relationship is given by $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$, where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant. For minimum uncertainty, we use the equality: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n*   **Bohr Model of the Atom:** The momentum of an electron in a Bohr orbit is determined by the quantization of angular momentum, $L = mvr = n\\hbar$.\n*   **Physical Constants:**\n    *   Reduced Planck constant, $\\hbar = 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}$.\n    *   Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit, $n=1$), $a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum ($\\Delta p$).**\n*   From the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, we can express the uncertainty in momentum as:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$\n*   First, convert the given uncertainty in position from picometers (pm) to meters (m):\n    $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m} = 1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   Now, substitute the values of $\\hbar$ and $\\Delta x$ into the equation:\n    $\\Delta p = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})} = 5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the momentum of the electron ($p$) in the first Bohr orbit.**\n*   According to the Bohr model, the angular momentum ($L$) of an electron in the n-th orbit is quantized: $L = n\\hbar$.\n*   Angular momentum is also defined as $L = p \\cdot r$, where $p$ is the linear momentum and $r$ is the orbital radius.\n*   Therefore, $p \\cdot r = n\\hbar$, which gives $p = \\frac{n\\hbar}{r}$.\n*   For the first Bohr orbit, $n=1$, and the radius is the Bohr radius, $r_1 = a_0 = 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n*   So, the momentum is:\n    $p = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\hbar}{a_0} = \\frac{1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J·s}}{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}} \\approx 1.992 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the required ratio $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p}$.**\n*   Now we form the ratio using the values calculated in Step 3 and Step 4.\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.27 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}}{1.992 \\times 10^{-24} \\text{ kg·m/s}} \\approx 2.645$\n\n*   **Alternative (and more elegant) method for Step 5:**\n    We can calculate the ratio symbolically first:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}\\right)}$\n    By simplifying the expression, the $\\hbar$ terms cancel out:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$\n    Now, substitute the values for $a_0$ and $\\Delta x$:\n    $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p} = \\frac{5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}}{2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m})} = \\frac{5.29}{2} = 2.645$.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Choice of Uncertainty Formula:** The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is an inequality ($\\ge$). The problem implicitly asks for the minimum possible uncertainty, so we use the equality $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p = \\hbar/2$.\n2.  **Unit Consistency:** All calculations must be performed in SI units. The given uncertainty in position, $\\Delta x$, must be converted from picometers (pm) to meters (m).\n3.  **Correct Constants:** Use the standard accepted values for the reduced Planck constant ($\\hbar$) and the Bohr radius ($a_0$).\n4.  **Momentum in Bohr Orbit:** Be sure to use the correct formula for momentum in the first Bohr orbit, which is derived from the angular momentum quantization rule ($p = \\hbar/a_0$).\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Performing the final calculation symbolically first can reduce rounding errors and simplify the process.\n\nThe final calculated ratio is 2.645.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
