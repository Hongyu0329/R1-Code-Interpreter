To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape in response to the presence or absence of sunlight. Specifically:
1.  **At sunrise:** When exposed to sunlight (specifically UV light), the table must transform from its stable, straight configuration (*trans*-isomer) into a bent, V-shaped configuration (*cis*-isomer).
2.  **At sunset:** In the absence of sunlight, the table must thermally relax back from its bent configuration (*cis*-isomer) to its stable, straight configuration (*trans*-isomer).
