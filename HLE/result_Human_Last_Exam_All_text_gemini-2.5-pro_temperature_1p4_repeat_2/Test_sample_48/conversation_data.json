    "An elegant way to solve this problem is to construct the minimal Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that recognizes the language $L$. The number of states in this minimal DFA is the answer to the question.\n\nThe language $L$ is defined by the regular expression:\n$L = ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*$\n\nLet's simplify the notation for the components of the regular expression:\nLet $S = (b | c)^*$. This represents any string consisting of only 'b's and 'c's.\nLet $M = (a | bc | cb | bbb)^*$. This represents strings formed by concatenating the \"words\" $a, bc, cb, bbb$. Note that the empty string $\\epsilon$ is in $M$.\nLet $E = (ba | bba | ca)$. This can be rewritten as $E = (b | bb | c)a$.\n\nWith this notation, the regular expression for $L$ becomes:\n$L = (S a M E)^* S a M$\n\nWe will build the minimal DFA by identifying its states. The states of the minimal DFA correspond to the equivalence classes of the Myhill-Nerode relation. A state can be thought of as representing the set of prefixes of strings in $L$ that are indistinguishable in terms of what suffixes can follow to form a complete string in $L$. We can characterize each state by the suffix of the prefix we have read.\n\nLet's define the states of our DFA:\n\n**State $q_0$:** This is the initial state. It represents prefixes that are in $S = (b|c)^*$. This includes the empty string $\\epsilon$. If we read any number of 'b's or 'c's, we are still in this state because they can be absorbed into the leading $S$ part of the expression for $L$.\n*   This state is not final because strings in $(b|c)^*$ are not in $L$ (they lack an 'a').\n*   Transitions:\n    *   On 'b' or 'c', we stay in $q_0$.\n    *   On 'a', we have seen a prefix of the form $s a$ where $s \\in S$. This matches the structure $S a M$ where $M$ is $\\epsilon$. This prefix could be a valid string in $L$. We move to a new state, $q_1$.\n\n**State $q_1$:** This state represents having read a prefix that is a valid string in $L$. For example, after reading 'a' from $q_0$, we have the string 'a' which is in $L$ (with $S=\\epsilon, M=\\epsilon$). Also, any time we complete parsing a valid component of $M$ (like 'a', 'bc', 'cb', 'bbb'), we return to this state, as the resulting prefix is still a valid member of $L$.\n*   This is a **final state**.\n*   Transitions:\n    *   On 'a': The component 'a' is in $M$. So if we read 'a', we have just completed another component of $M$. The new prefix is still in $L$. We stay in $q_1$.\n    *   On 'b': The character 'b' is not a complete word in $M$, but it is a prefix of 'bc' and 'bbb'. It could also be the 'b' from the $E$ block. We move to a new state $q_b$ to handle these possibilities.\n    *   On 'c': Similarly, 'c' is a prefix of 'cb' in $M$ or 'c' from $E$. We move to a new state $q_c$ to remember we've seen a 'c'.\n\n**State $q_b$:** This state represents having read a valid string from $L$ followed by a 'b'.\n*   This state is not final.\n*   Transitions:\n    *   On 'a': The suffix is now 'ba'. This matches the `ba` component of $E$. An $E$ block has been completed. After an $E$ block, the structure of $L$ effectively \"resets\". The next part of the string must match $L$ again, starting with an element from $S$. So, we transition back to the initial state $q_0$.\n    *   On 'b': The suffix is now 'bb'. This is a prefix of 'bbb' from $M$, and it's also the `bb` part of `bba` from $E$. We need a new state to handle this. Let's call it $q_{cb}$ (we'll see why it's named this way shortly).\n    *   On 'c': The suffix is now 'bc'. This is a complete word in $M$. We have successfully extended our string with a valid $M$-component. We transition back to $q_1$.\n\n**State $q_c$:** This state represents having read a valid string from $L$ followed by a 'c'. Through careful analysis of possible continuations (using derivatives or indistinguishability), it can be shown that this state is equivalent to the one reached after reading 'bb'. Let's check.\nA string ending in '...ac' can be followed by 'b' to form '...acb' ('cb' is in $M$, so we are back in a final state). It can be followed by 'a' to form '...aca' ('ca' is in $E$, so we restart). It cannot be followed by 'c' ('cc' is not a valid start of anything).\nA string ending in '...abb' can be followed by 'b' to form '...abbb' ('bbb' is in $M$, so we are back in a final state). It can be followed by 'a' to form '...abba' ('bba' is in $E$, so we restart). It cannot be followed by 'c' ('bbc' is not a valid start of anything).\nThe future possibilities are identical. Thus, these states can be merged. Let's call this merged state $q_{cb}$.\n*   This state is not final.\n*   Transitions:\n    *   From $q_1$ on 'c', we go to $q_{cb}$.\n    *   From $q_b$ on 'b', we go to $q_{cb}$.\n    *   Now, what are the transitions *from* $q_{cb}$?\n        *   On 'a': Corresponds to 'ca' or 'bba' from $E$. We restart by going to $q_0$.\n        *   On 'b': Corresponds to 'cb' (if previous was 'c') or 'bbb' (if previous was 'bb'). In both cases, a word in $M$ is completed. We go to $q_1$.\n        *   On 'c': Corresponds to 'cc' or 'bbc'. Neither is a valid prefix for $M$ or $E$. This leads to a non-accepting \"dead\" state. We go to $q_D$.\n\n**State $q_D$:** This is a \"dead\" or \"trap\" state. It represents having read a prefix that can never be completed into a string in $L$.\n*   This state is not final.\n*   Transitions:\n    *   On 'a', 'b', or 'c', we stay in $q_D$.\n\n**Summary of states and transitions:**\n1.  **$q_0$** (Initial, Non-final):\n    *   $q_0 \\xrightarrow{b,c} q_0$\n    *   $q_0 \\xrightarrow{a} q_1$\n2.  **$q_1$** (Final):\n    *   $q_1 \\xrightarrow{a} q_1$\n    *   $q_1 \\xrightarrow{b} q_b$\n    *   $q_1 \\xrightarrow{c} q_{cb}$\n3.  **$q_b$** (Non-final):\n    *   $q_b \\xrightarrow{a} q_0$\n    *   $q_b \\xrightarrow{b} q_{cb}$\n    *   $q_b \\xrightarrow{c} q_1$\n4.  **$q_{cb}$** (Non-final):\n    *   $q_{cb} \\xrightarrow{a} q_0$\n    *   $q_{cb} \\xrightarrow{b} q_1$\n    *   $q_{cb} \\xrightarrow{c} q_D$\n5.  **$q_D$** (Dead, Non-final):\n    *   $q_D \\xrightarrow{a,b,c} q_D$\n\nAll these 5 states ($q_0, q_1, q_b, q_{cb}, q_D$) are distinguishable from each other. For example:\n*   $q_1$ is the only final state.\n*   $q_D$ is the only non-final state that cannot reach the final state.\n*   $q_0$ is distinguishable from $q_b$ and $q_{cb}$ by the input string \"a\" (which is accepted from $q_0$ but not from the others).\n*   $q_b$ is distinguishable from $q_{cb}$ by the input string \"c\" (leads to final state $q_1$ from $q_b$, but dead state $q_D$ from $q_{cb}$).\n\nTherefore, the minimal DFA that recognizes the language $L$ has exactly 5 states."
