    "This problem asks for the largest possible number of a specific topological feature, the composant, in a product space formed by two continua.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0,1]`, a circle `S^1`, or a square `[0,1]x[0,1]`.\n    *   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum containing more than one point. The interval `[0,1]` is nondegenerate, while a single point `{p}` is degenerate.\n    *   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the union of all proper subcontinua of `X` that contain `p`. A proper subcontinuum is a continuum inside `X` that is not equal to `X` itself. The set of all composants of a space `X` forms a partition of `X`.\n    *   **Product of two continua:** Given two continua `X` and `Y`, their product `X x Y` equipped with the product topology is also a continuum.\n\n2.  **Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability:**\n    The number of composants of a continuum is directly related to a property called decomposability.\n    *   A continuum is **decomposable** if it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. For example, the interval `[0,1]` is decomposable because `[0,1] = [0, 2/3] U [1/3, 1]`.\n    *   A continuum is **indecomposable** if it is not decomposable. A classic example is the pseudo-arc.\n    *   **Key Theorem 1:** A continuum has exactly **one** composant if and only if it is decomposable.\n    *   **Key Theorem 2:** A continuum has **uncountably many** composants if and only if it is indecomposable. The number of composants in an indecomposable continuum is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (the \"size\" of the set of real numbers).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Decomposability of the Product Space `X x Y`:**\n    To find the number of composants of `X x Y`, we must determine when it is decomposable or indecomposable.\n    *   **Key Theorem 3:** The product space `X x Y` of two continua is decomposable if and only if at least one of the factors `X` or `Y` is decomposable.\n    *   From this theorem, it follows that `X x Y` is indecomposable if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n4.  **Synthesize to Find the Maximum Number of Composants:**\n    We want to find the largest possible number of composants for `X x Y`. We analyze the possible cases based on the decomposability of `X` and `Y`.\n\n    *   **Case A: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n        *   According to Theorem 3, the product `X x Y` is decomposable.\n        *   According to Theorem 1, any decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n        *   This case is possible. For example, let `X = Y = [0,1]`. Both are nondegenerate and decomposable. Their product `[0,1]x[0,1]` (the unit square) is decomposable and has 1 composant.\n\n    *   **Case B: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n        *   The problem requires `X` and `Y` to be nondegenerate continua. There exist well-known nondegenerate indecomposable continua, such as the **pseudo-arc** or the **Knaster continuum**. So, we can choose `X` and `Y` to be two such continua.\n        *   According to Theorem 3, since both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable, their product `X x Y` is also indecomposable.\n        *   According to Theorem 2, any indecomposable continuum has **`c`** (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    The number of composants for the product `X x Y` can be either 1 (if at least one factor is decomposable) or `c` (if both factors are indecomposable). The question asks for the **largest possible number**. Comparing the two possibilities, `c` is larger than 1.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   One must not confuse the properties of the factors (`X`, `Y`) with the properties of the product (`X x Y`).\n*   The existence of nondegenerate indecomposable continua is crucial to show that the case leading to the maximum number is achievable.\n*   The answer is a cardinality, `c`, not a finite number or infinity. `c` is the precise number of composants in any indecomposable continuum.\n\nThe largest possible number of composants is achieved when both `X` and `Y` are chosen to be nondegenerate indecomposable continua. In this case, their product is also indecomposable and thus has `c` composants.\n\n<<<c>>>"
