    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji:** The first step is to observe the structure of the kanji character 謄. Like many kanji, it is composed of multiple parts. We can clearly see it has a left-side component and a right-side component. This structure is called *hen-tsukuri* (偏旁).\n\n2.  **Identify the Left Component (Hen - 偏):** The component on the left side of 謄 is 言. This is a complete kanji on its own, meaning \"to say\" or \"words.\"\n\n3.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu - 部首):** In characters with a clear left-right (*hen-tsukuri*) structure, the left-side component (*hen*) is very often the radical. The radical is the part of the character used for classification in dictionaries and often gives a clue to the character's general meaning. In this case, the radical for 謄 is indeed 言. Characters with the 言 radical often relate to speech, language, or recording. The meaning of 謄, \"to copy\" or \"transcribe,\" fits this pattern.\n\n4.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:** Each radical has a specific name in Japanese. The name often combines the radical's reading with its position in the character.\n    *   The radical is 言.\n    *   The *on'yomi* (Sino-Japanese reading) for 言 is \"gon\".\n    *   When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a *hen* (偏). In compound words, this is often pronounced \"ben\".\n    *   Therefore, the name of the radical 言 is **Gonben** (言偏 / ごんべん).\n\n5.  **Transcribe the Name:** The final step is to write the radical's name using Hepburn romanization, as requested by the question.\n    *   Japanese name: ごんべん\n    *   Hepburn transcription: Gonben\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Component Identification:** It is crucial to correctly identify the components. In this case, the left side is clearly 言, not a similar-looking radical like 月 (*tsuki*).\n*   **Radical Naming Convention:** Remember that the name of a radical often depends on its position. \"Hen\" (or \"ben\") is for the left side, \"tsukuri\" for the right, \"kanmuri\" for the top, \"ashi\" for the bottom, etc.\n*   **Transcription:** Ensure the romanization follows the standard Hepburn system (e.g., ごん is \"gon\", not \"gonn\"; べん is \"ben\", not \"benn\").\n\nBy following these steps, we have accurately identified the radical of 謄 and its name.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
