    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Scenario:**\n    *   **Game:** 100BB deep No-Limit Hold'em cash game.\n    *   **Rake:** Rake-free. This is a crucial detail. The absence of rake means that hands that might be break-even or slightly losing in a raked game become profitable. This encourages opening a wider range of hands.\n    *   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. You act last post-flop, giving you a significant informational advantage. Consequently, you should play your widest opening range from the button.\n    *   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x the big blind. This is a standard opening size.\n    *   **Hand in Question:** We are looking for the \"worst\" suited Jack (JXs) that should be included in this opening range.\n\n2.  **Principles of Opening Ranges:**\n    *   **Positional Advantage:** The later your position, the wider the range of hands you can profitably open. The button has the widest opening range of all.\n    *   **Hand Playability:** Suited hands are significantly more valuable than their offsuit counterparts because they can make flushes, which are very strong hands. Suited connectors (like JTs, 98s) and suited gappers (like J9s, J8s) are also valuable for their ability to make straights.\n    *   **The Rake-Free Environment:** In a typical game with a 5% rake, a pot must be won for the play to be profitable. Without rake, any play with a positive expected value (+EV), no matter how small, is correct. This expands the button's opening range to include more marginal hands.\n\n3.  **Evaluating Suited Jacks (JXs):**\n    *   We need to rank all suited Jacks, from best to worst: JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, J2s.\n    *   **JTs (suited connector):** A premium hand. It makes strong straights and flushes. This is a definite open.\n    *   **J9s, J8s (suited gappers):** Also very strong hands with good straight and flush potential. These are standard opens.\n    *   **J7s through J2s:** As the second card (the \"kicker\") gets lower, the hand's value decreases. This is due to two factors:\n        1.  **Lower Kicker:** If you flop a Jack, having a better kicker is valuable.\n        2.  **Worse Connectivity:** The gap between the Jack and the lower card increases, making it much harder to flop a straight draw. J7s is a two-gapper, while J2s is a seven-gapper, giving it virtually no straight potential that involves both cards.\n    *   The primary value of these weaker suited Jacks (J5s-J2s) comes from their potential to make a Jack-high flush and the semi-bluffing opportunities that flush draws provide.\n\n4.  **Determining the \"Worst\" Hand to Open:**\n    *   Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers show that in a 100BB, 6-max game, the button's opening range is very wide, often around 45-50% of hands.\n    *   In a standard *raked* game, the weakest suited Jacks like J3s and J2s might be considered \"mixed strategies\" (sometimes open, sometimes fold) or pure folds.\n    *   However, in the specified **rake-free** game, the threshold for profitability is lowered. The combination of being suited and having a guaranteed positional advantage makes even the weakest suited Jack, **J2s**, a profitable open-raise. A GTO strategy for this specific environment would advocate for opening all suited hands from the button.\n    *   Therefore, if you *should* open all suited Jacks, the \"worst\" one is simply the weakest hand in that category. Based on kicker strength and connectivity, J2s is weaker than J3s, which is weaker than J4s, and so on.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The \"Rake-Free\" Condition is Key:** If this were a standard game with rake, the answer might change to J4s or J5s, as J3s and J2s often become unprofitable to open.\n*   **The Power of Position:** The button's positional advantage cannot be overstated. It allows you to realize your equity much more effectively, turning marginal hands into profitable opens.\n*   **Definition of \"Worst\":** The question asks for the worst hand you *should* open. This implies the hand is still a correct, profitable open. Given the conditions, all suited Jacks fall into this category. We are therefore looking for the hand with the lowest raw equity and playability within that group.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe weakest suited Jack is J2s. Due to the immense positional advantage of the button and the rake-free nature of the game, a GTO strategy includes opening all suited hands. Therefore, J2s is the worst suited Jack that you should still open.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
