    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: The question asks for the number of **historical saints** mentioned **by name** within the epic poem **_Paradise Lost_** by John Milton.\n    *   **\"Historical saints\"**: This refers to individuals who lived after the biblical era (i.e., post-New Testament) and were later canonized or widely recognized as saints by Christian tradition (e.g., Catholic, Orthodox). This excludes biblical figures like the apostles (Peter, John) or Old Testament prophets (Moses, Elijah), who are sometimes referred to as saints but belong to the foundational scriptural narrative rather than post-biblical history.\n    *   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: The saint's actual name, or a direct derivative of their name that unambiguously refers to them, must appear in the text. A general reference to \"saints\" or \"friars\" would not suffice.\n    *   **\"_Paradise Lost_\"**: The search is confined exclusively to the text of this specific poem.\n\n2.  **Initial Assessment and Strategy**: Milton was a devout Puritan with strong anti-Catholic sentiments. It is highly unlikely that he would mention historical saints in a laudatory way. Any mention would likely be critical or satirical. The most probable places to find such references are in passages critiquing the future corruption of the Church. There are two key sections in the poem where this occurs:\n    *   **Book III**: The description of the Limbo of Vanity (also called the Paradise of Fools).\n    *   **Books XI and XII**: The Archangel Michael's vision of future history shown to Adam.\n\n3.  **Examine the Vision in Books XI and XII**: In the final two books, Michael shows Adam the future of mankind. He covers biblical history from Cain and Abel to the life of Christ and the apostles. He then describes the corruption of the Church, where \"grievous wolves\" will prey on the flock. However, Milton keeps this critique general and allegorical. He condemns the practices and hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church but does not name any specific post-biblical popes, theologians, or saints like Augustine, Jerome, or Constantine. This section, therefore, yields no names.\n\n4.  **Examine the Limbo of Vanity in Book III**: This section is a satirical catalogue of vain and foolish people and things that are blown up from Earth to a \"limbo large and broad, since called / The Paradise of Fools.\" Here, Milton directly attacks what he sees as the follies of the Roman Catholic Church. In a key passage (Book III, lines 476-481), he describes some of the inhabitants:\n\n    > Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so far to seek\n    > In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav'n;\n    > And they who to be sure of Paradise,\n    > Dying put on the weeds of **Dominic**,\n    > Or in **Franciscan** think to pass disguis'd...\n\n5.  **Identify the Named Saints**: This passage contains the answer.\n    *   **\"Dominic\"**: This is a direct, by-name reference to **Saint Dominic** (c. 1170–1221), the Spanish priest who founded the Dominican Order (the \"Black Friars\"). This is the first historical saint mentioned by name.\n    *   **\"Franciscan\"**: This is an adjective derived directly from the name of **Saint Francis of Assisi** (c. 1181–1226). In the phrase \"Franciscan [weeds],\" the name of Francis is used to identify the monastic order he founded (the \"Grey Friars\"). This is an undeniable and specific reference to Saint Francis by name, even if it is in an adjectival form. It clearly satisfies the \"mentioned by name\" criterion. This is the second historical saint.\n\n6.  **Final Confirmation**: A search through the rest of the epic for other historical saints' names (such as Augustine, Benedict, Gregory, George, etc.) yields no results. The references to \"White, Black, and Grey\" friars in the same passage reinforce the identification of the Dominican and Franciscan orders but do not introduce new names of saints. The only two historical saints Milton mentions by name are the founders of these two major mendicant orders, whom he places in his satirical Limbo of Vanity.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy carefully analyzing the text of _Paradise Lost_ and understanding the specific criteria of the question, we find exactly two historical saints who are mentioned by name.\n\n<<<2>>>"
