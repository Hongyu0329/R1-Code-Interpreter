    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes for the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the musical work and specific part.**\nThe work is Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4. We need to examine the part for the first violins (\"Violino I\").\n\n**Step 2: Locate the end of the symphony.**\nWe must look at the score for the final measures of the fourth and last movement, which is marked \"Finale: Allegro con fuoco\".\n\n**Step 3: Examine the notes in the final measures for the first violin.**\nLooking at the printed score for the first violin part at the very end of the symphony, we can identify the last three notes played.\n*   **The final note:** In the very last measure of the piece, the first violin plays a single whole note. This note is B♭ (B-flat).\n*   **The second-to-last note:** In the measure just before the final one, the first violin plays a single dotted half note. This note is D.\n*   **The third-to-last note:** In the measure before that, the first violin plays a single half note. This note is B♭ (B-flat).\n\n**Step 4: List and compare the last three notes.**\nThe last three notes played by the first violin, in reverse chronological order, are B♭, D, and B♭.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important to compare the actual pitches. These notes are in the upper register. Specifically, they are B♭5, D5, and B♭5. On the musical staff, the D5 is written on the fourth line of the treble clef, while the B♭5 is written on a ledger line above the staff.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the lowest note.**\nWe now compare the pitches of the notes identified: B♭ and D.\nIn any given octave, the note D is lower in pitch than the note B♭. Therefore, D5 is lower than B♭5.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOf the last three notes played by the first violin (B♭, D, B♭), the lowest one is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
