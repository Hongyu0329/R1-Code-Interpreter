    "**Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the tallest *historical* mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, with the specific exclusion of Mount Olympus. To answer this accurately, we need to follow a clear, step-by-step process.\n\n**Step 1: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\n\nFirst, we must compile a list of specific mountains that are named in the text of the *Iliad*. The gods and heroes frequently interact with the landscape, and several mountains are mentioned by name.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is the most frequently mentioned mountain and serves as the baseline for the question.\n*   **Mount Ida:** This mountain near Troy is mentioned multiple times. It is a crucial location from which Zeus observes the Trojan War (e.g., in Book 8 and Book 14). He sits on its highest peak, Gargarus. It is also the mythical location of the Judgment of Paris. It's important to distinguish this from Mount Ida on Crete, which is not the one central to the *Iliad*'s action.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** In Book 13, the sea god Poseidon sits atop the highest peak of the island of Samothrace to watch the battle, as it provided a clear view of Troy, Imbros, and Lemnos. The highest peak on Samothrace is Mount Fengari.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, during her journey to deceive Zeus, the goddess Hera flies from Olympus over Pieria and Emathia, and then leaps \"to the snowy mountains of the horse-breeding Thracians, and went over their topmost peaks... From Athos she went on over the waves...\". This confirms a direct mention.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** In Book 16, the epic describes the formidable spear of Achilles, which was a gift from his father Peleus. The spear was cut from an ash tree on the summit of Mount Pelion.\n\n**Step 2: Verify that these are Historical Mountains and Find their Elevations**\n\nNext, we must confirm that these are real, identifiable mountains in the modern world and find their official elevations to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** A real mountain range in Greece. Its highest peak, Mytikas, is **2,918 meters (9,573 feet)**. As per the question, this is excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Athos:** A real mountain and peninsula in northeastern Greece. Its highest peak reaches **2,033 meters (6,670 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Ida (near Troy):** A real mountain range in modern-day Turkey, now known as Kaz Dağı. Its highest point is **1,774 meters (5,820 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** A real mountain in the region of Thessaly, Greece. Its highest peak is Pourianos Stavros, at **1,624 meters (5,328 feet)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** A real mountain on the Greek island of Samothrace. Its highest peak, Fengari, is **1,611 meters (5,285 feet)**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Elevations and Determine the Tallest (After Olympus)**\n\nNow, we rank the mountains by height, excluding Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters\n2.  **Mount Ida (Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters\n3.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters\n4.  **Mount Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 meters\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Context is key:** It is crucial to identify the correct Mount Ida (the one near Troy, not the one on Crete) based on the context of the Trojan War.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for a \"mountain,\" not just a mountainous region. The locations identified (Athos, Ida, Pelion, Samothrace) are all specific, named peaks or mountains.\n*   **Verification of Mention:** One must be careful to only include mountains explicitly named in the *Iliad*. All the mountains in our list are directly mentioned in the text.\n*   **Accuracy of Elevation:** Using reliable modern data for elevation is necessary for a correct comparison.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter comparing the elevations of all historical mountains mentioned by name in the *Iliad*, Mount Athos is the tallest, after Mount Olympus itself.\n\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"
