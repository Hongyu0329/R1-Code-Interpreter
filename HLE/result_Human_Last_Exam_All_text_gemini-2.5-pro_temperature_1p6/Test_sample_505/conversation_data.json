    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question**: We need to find the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a specific configuration: \"two patches of surface code with two holes\".\n\n2.  **Understand the Components**:\n    *   **Surface Code**: A topological quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D surface. Logical qubits are encoded in the global topological properties of this surface.\n    *   **Patch**: A \"patch\" refers to a finite, planar section of the surface code lattice. Topologically, it is equivalent to a disk. It has one outer boundary.\n    *   **Hole**: A hole is created by removing a region of qubits from the interior of the patch. Creating a hole also creates a new boundary on its perimeter.\n    *   **Logical Qubit**: A qubit encoded using many physical qubits, protected from local errors. The number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the surface.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Phrasing**: The phrase \"two patches of surface code with two holes\" can be interpreted in two ways:\n    *   **Interpretation A (Total)**: A system composed of two patches, with a total of two holes distributed between them (e.g., one hole in each patch, or two holes in one patch and none in the other).\n    *   **Interpretation B (Each)**: A system composed of two separate patches, where *each* patch has two holes.\n    Grammatically, Interpretation B is the more natural reading. For example, \"two cars with four wheels\" usually means two cars that each have four wheels. We will proceed with Interpretation B, as it describes a collection of identical objects, but we will also consider Interpretation A to ensure we are finding the absolute maximum.\n\n4.  **The Formula for Logical Qubits**: For a 2D surface with genus `g` (number of \"handles\" or \"donuts\") and `b` distinct boundaries (including outer boundaries and holes), the number of logical qubits `k` it can store is given by the formula:\n    `k = 2g + b - 1`\n    For a planar patch, the genus `g = 0`. So the formula simplifies to `k = b - 1`.\n\n### Analysis under Interpretation B (Each patch has two holes)\n\n*   **Consider a single patch**:\n    *   It is a planar patch, so its genus `g = 0`.\n    *   It has one outer boundary by default.\n    *   It has \"two holes\", each of which adds an inner boundary.\n    *   Total number of boundaries `b = 1 (outer) + 2 (inner) = 3`.\n*   **Calculate logical qubits for one patch**:\n    *   Using the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`:\n    *   `k = 2*0 + 3 - 1 = 2`.\n    *   So, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode **2 logical qubits**.\n*   **Calculate total logical qubits for the system**:\n    *   The system consists of two such patches. Assuming they are separate and non-interacting, their capacities add up.\n    *   Total logical qubits = (qubits in patch 1) + (qubits in patch 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\n### Analysis under Interpretation A (Two holes in total)\n\nTo find the maximum, we need to consider how distributing the two holes affects the total qubit count.\n*   **Case 1: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1: `g=0`, 1 outer boundary, 1 hole. So `b=2`. `k1 = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n    *   Patch 2: `g=0`, 1 outer boundary, 1 hole. So `b=2`. `k2 = 2 - 1 = 1`.\n    *   Total qubits = `1 + 1 = 2`.\n*   **Case 2: Both holes in one patch, none in the other.**\n    *   Patch 1: `g=0`, 1 outer boundary, 2 holes. So `b=3`. `k1 = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n    *   Patch 2: `g=0`, 1 outer boundary, 0 holes. So `b=1`. `k2 = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   Total qubits = `2 + 0 = 2`.\nUnder this interpretation, the maximum number of logical qubits is 2.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nComparing the two interpretations, Interpretation B (\"each patch has two holes\") yields a higher number of logical qubits (4) than Interpretation A (\"a total of two holes\") (2). Since the question asks for the maximum number of logical qubits that *can* be encoded, and Interpretation B is a valid and natural reading of the prompt, the maximum potential is determined by that configuration.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n1.  **Identify the topology of a single unit**: A patch of surface code with two holes is a planar surface (`g=0`) with one external boundary and two internal boundaries (the holes).\n2.  **Count the boundaries for a single patch**: `b` = 1 (outer) + 2 (holes) = 3.\n3.  **Calculate the logical qubits for a single patch**: `k = 2g + b - 1 = 2*0 + 3 - 1 = 2`.\n4.  **Calculate the total for the entire system**: Since there are two such patches, and their qubit capacities are additive, the total is `k_total = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n<<<4>>>"
