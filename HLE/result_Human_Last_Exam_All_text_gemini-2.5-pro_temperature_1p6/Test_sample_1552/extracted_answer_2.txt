The second heat kernel coefficient is the integral of the following local density over the manifold:
$b_4(x) = \frac{4}{3} \text{tr}_{G}(F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}) + N \left( \frac{17}{90}R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} - \frac{1}{45}R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} - \frac{7}{72}R^2 \right)$
where $N$ is the dimension of the gauge group representation, $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the gauge field strength, and $R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}$, $R_{\mu\nu}$, $R$ are the Riemann curvature tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature, respectively. The trace $\text{tr}_G$ is over the gauge group indices.
