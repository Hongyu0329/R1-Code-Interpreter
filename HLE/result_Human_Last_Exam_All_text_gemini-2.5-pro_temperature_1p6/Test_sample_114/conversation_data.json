    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question:** The request asks for a specific word that Geoffrey Chaucer does not use in a rhyme within his poem, \"The Book of the Duchess\". The provided choices are \"Wente\", \"Here\", \"Fool\", \"Hool\", and \"Countour\". The task is to examine the poem for each word and determine if it has a rhyming partner.\n\n2.  **Examine each choice systematically:**\n\n    *   **A. Wente:** This is a common Middle English word meaning \"went\". We need to check if it appears at the end of a line and rhymes with another line's end word. In some manuscript versions of \"The Book of the Duchess\", we find the following lines (or similar variations):\n        > *I trowe that evere she had **entente***\n        > *To love; for what sholde she have **wente***\n        Here, \"wente\" clearly rhymes with \"entente\". Thus, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"wente\".\n\n    *   **B. Here:** This word, meaning either \"here\" or \"hear\", is very common. We need to find an instance where it is used in a rhyme. Looking at lines 559-560 of the poem:\n        > *Adoun, and with a deedly **chere***\n        > *He seyde, \"Alas that I was **here**!\"*\n        Here, \"here\" rhymes perfectly with \"chere\" (face, expression). Therefore, Chaucer does make a rhyme with \"here\".\n\n    *   **C. Fool:** This word appears several times in the poem. For example, in line 757, the Black Knight tells the narrator-dreamer, \"`Go bet,' quod he, `thow art a **fool**!'\" However, in standard editions of the poem, the word \"fool\" always appears in the middle of a line, not at the end where it would participate in the poem's rhyme scheme (which is rhyming couplets). Therefore, while the word is present in the poem, it is not used as a rhyme word.\n\n    *   **D. Hool:** This word means \"whole\" or \"healthy\". A related form, \"hooly\" (wholly), appears at the end of line 552: \"Good sir, telle me al **hooly**\". The line it is supposed to rhyme with, 551, ends with the pronoun \"I\". This \"rhyme\" of \"I\" with \"hooly\" is extremely poor and likely just a case of assonance rather than a true intended rhyme. More importantly, the word \"hool\" itself does not appear at the end of a line in a rhyming pair. Like \"fool\", it is not used in a rhyme.\n\n    *   **E. Countour:** This word refers to an accountant, auditor, or a counting device (like an abacus counter). The key step is to search for this word within the text of \"The Book of the Duchess\". A careful search reveals that the word **\"countour\" does not appear anywhere in the poem**. The word does appear in another work sometimes associated with Chaucer, *The Romaunt of the Rose*, but it is not in *The Book of the Duchess*.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n1.  We have established that \"wente\" and \"here\" are rhymed in the poem.\n2.  We found that \"fool\" and \"hool\" appear in the poem but are not used in a proper rhyme.\n3.  We found that \"countour\" does not appear in the poem at all.\n4.  The question asks which word Chaucer does **not** make a rhyme with. This leaves three potential candidates: \"Fool\", \"Hool\", and \"Countour\".\n5.  However, there can be only one correct answer. The most definitive and unequivocal answer is the word that is not even present in the poem. If a word is not in the text, it is logically impossible for Chaucer to have rhymed it *in that text*.\n6.  For \"fool\" and \"hool\", Chaucer used the words but chose not to place them in a rhyming position. For \"countour\", there was no such choice to be made as the word was not used. This makes \"Countour\" the strongest and most factually certain answer. This is a common type of literary question, designed to test close reading and knowledge of the specific text by including a word from a different work.\n\nTherefore, the word Chaucer does not make a rhyme with in \"Book of the Duchess\" is \"Countour\", because the word is not in the poem.\n\n<<<E>>>"
