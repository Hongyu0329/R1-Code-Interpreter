    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the key elements of the question:** The question asks about a specific painting by Curt Querner from 1933. The crucial details are: it's a self-portrait, it was made after his escape from Nazi custody (Gestapo/SA), and it contains an object held in his hand that is a symbol of resistance.\n\n2.  **Establish the historical context:** In March 1933, shortly after the Nazis came to power, Curt Querner was arrested due to his membership in the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). He was imprisoned in Hohnstein Castle, one of the early, makeshift concentration camps. After his release, he painted a self-portrait to process his experience and express his unbroken political will.\n\n3.  **Identify the specific artwork:** The self-portrait in question is the \"Selbstbildnis mit rotem Tuch\" (Self-Portrait with Red Scarf), painted in 1933. While he painted other self-portraits that year, this one contains the most overt symbol of political resistance.\n\n4.  **Analyze the symbolism of the object:**\n    *   In the painting, Querner depicts himself with a gaunt, serious, and defiant expression, looking directly at the viewer.\n    *   In his hand, he holds a crumpled piece of red cloth or a red scarf.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The color red is critically important here. In the political context of 1933 Germany, red was the internationally recognized color of communism and the workers' movement. The flag of the KPD was red.\n    *   By holding this red cloth, Querner was making a powerful and dangerous statement. He was visually reaffirming his commitment to the communist ideals for which he had just been persecuted. It was a symbol of his unbroken spirit and his continued, quiet resistance to the Nazi regime that was trying to crush all political opposition.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The object Curt Querner holds in his hand in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance is a red cloth or scarf, representing his communist convictions.\n\n***\n\nIn his 1933 self-portrait, painted after his imprisonment, Curt Querner holds a **red cloth** or **red scarf** in his hand. This object serves as a potent symbol of resistance, representing his unwavering commitment to his communist beliefs, the very reason for his persecution by the Nazis.\n\n<<<A red cloth (or red scarf)>>>"
