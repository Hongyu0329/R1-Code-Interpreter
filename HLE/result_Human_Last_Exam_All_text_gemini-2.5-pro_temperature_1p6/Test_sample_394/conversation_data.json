    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest possible denominator of the hypotenuse.\n\n### Step 1: Set up the equations\nLet the sides of the right triangle be `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` and `b` are the legs and `c` is the hypotenuse.\nWe are given:\n1.  The sides `a, b, c` are rational numbers.\n2.  The area is `A = (1/2)ab = 263`. This implies `ab = 526`.\n3.  The Pythagorean theorem holds: `a² + b² = c²`.\n\n### Step 2: Relate the problem to a Diophantine equation\nWe can express `c²` in terms of one side, say `a`:\nSince `b = 526/a`, we have `c² = a² + (526/a)² = (a⁴ + 526²)/a²`.\nFor `c` to be rational, `a⁴ + 526²` must be the square of a rational number. Let `a = x/y`. This path is complicated.\n\nA more structured approach is to relate this to the congruent number problem. An integer `N` is a congruent number if it's the area of a right triangle with rational sides. Our area is `N=263`.\nThe sides of such a triangle can be related to a point on an elliptic curve, but we can also derive the relationship through a more elementary method.\n\nLet's define `u = (a+b)` and `v = (a-b)`. `u` and `v` are rational.\n`u² = (a+b)² = a² + b² + 2ab = c² + 2(526) = c² + 1052`.\n`v² = (a-b)² = a² + b² - 2ab = c² - 2(526) = c² - 1052`.\nSo, we have `c² + 1052 = u²` and `c² - 1052 = v²`.\n\nLet `c = P/Q` where `P` and `Q` are integers with `gcd(P,Q)=1`.\n` (P/Q)² + 1052 = u² ` => `P² + 1052Q²` must be a rational square.\n` (P/Q)² - 1052 = v² ` => `P² - 1052Q²` must be a rational square.\n\nBy clearing denominators, we are looking for integer solutions to:\n1.  `K² - P² = 1052Q²`\n2.  `P² - L² = 1052Q²`\n\nFrom these, we get `K² - P² = P² - L²`, which simplifies to `K² + L² = 2P²`.\nThis is a known Diophantine equation. Its solutions can be parameterized. Let `K+L = 2X` and `K-L = 2Y`. Then `K=X+Y` and `L=X-Y`.\nSubstituting into the equation: `(X+Y)² + (X-Y)² = 2P²` => `2X² + 2Y² = 2P²` => `X² + Y² = P²`.\nThis means `(X, Y, P)` is a Pythagorean triple. We can parameterize it using Euclid's formula. Let `X = d(m²-n²)`, `Y = d(2mn)`, and `P = d(m²+n²)`, for integers `d, m, n` where `m>n`, `gcd(m,n)=1`, and `m,n` have opposite parity.\n\nNow, substitute `P`, `L=X-Y` back into `(P-L)(P+L) = 1052Q²`:\n` (d(m²+n²) - d(m²-n²-2mn)) * (d(m²+n²) + d(m²-n²-2mn)) ` This is getting messy. Let's use `K, L` instead.\nLet's use `P²-L²=1052Q²`.\n`(P - (X-Y))(P + (X-Y)) = 1052Q²`\n`(P - X + Y)(P + X - Y) = 1052Q²`\nSubstitute the parameterizations for `X, Y, P`:\n`(d(m²+n²) - d(m²-n²) + d(2mn)) * (d(m²+n²) + d(m²-n²) - d(2mn)) = 1052Q²`\n`d(2n² + 2mn) * d(2m² - 2mn) = 1052Q²`\n`4d² * n(n+m) * m(m-n) = 1052Q²`\n`d²mn(m-n)(m+n) = (1052/4)Q²`\n`d²mn(m²-n²) = 263Q²`\n\n### Step 3: Find the hypotenuse `c` and its denominator\nThe hypotenuse `c = P/Q`.\nFrom the equation above, `Q² = d²mn(m²-n²)/263`.\nSo `Q = d * sqrt(mn(m²-n²)/263)`.\nFor `Q` to be an integer, `mn(m²-n²)/263` must be a perfect square. Let this be `s_0²`.\nThis means `mn(m²-n²) = 263 * s_0²` for some integer `s_0`.\nThen `Q = d * s_0`.\nThe hypotenuse is `c = P/Q = d(m²+n²) / (d*s_0) = (m²+n²)/s_0`.\n\nOur goal is to find integers `m, n` that satisfy the conditions and minimize the denominator of `c`. The denominator will be `s_0 / gcd(m²+n², s_0)`.\n\n### Step 4: Solve the core equation `mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263s_0²`\nSince `m, n` are coprime with opposite parity, the factors `m, n, m-n, m+n` are pairwise coprime.\nFor their product to be `263 * s_0²`, one of them must be a multiple of 263 (which is a prime number), and the product of their square-free parts must be 263. This implies that one of the factors must be of the form `263k*A²` and the others `k*B²`, `k*C²`, `k*D²` such that `k`s multiply to 1. In the simplest case, one factor is `263 * A²` and the other three are squares `B², C², D²`.\n\nLet's test the four possibilities:\n1.  `m+n = 263A²`, `m=B²`, `n=C²`, `m-n=D²`. This requires `B²+C²=263A²`. For `A=1`, `B²+C²=263`. A number can be written as the sum of two squares if and only if its prime factorization does not contain any prime of the form `4k+3` to an odd power. Since `263` is a prime of the form `4*65+3`, it cannot be written as the sum of two squares. This case fails.\n2.  `m-n = 263A²`, `m=B²`, `n=C²`, `m+n=D²`. This implies `B²-C² = 263A²` and `B²+C²=D²`. For `A=1`, `(B-C)(B+C)=263`. As 263 is prime, `B-C=1` and `B+C=263`. This gives `B=132` and `C=131`. So `m=132²=17424` and `n=131²=17161`. We check `m+n = 17424+17161 = 34585`. This is not a perfect square (`186²=34596`), so this case fails.\n3.  `m = 263A²`, `n=B²`, `m-n=C²`, `m+n=D²`. For `A=1`, `m=263`. This requires `263-B²=C²` and `263+B²=D²`. So `B²+C²=263`, which has no solutions as shown in possibility 1.\n4.  `n = 263A²`, `m=B²`, `m-n=C²`, `m+n=D²`. For `A=1`, `n=263`. This requires `m-263=C²` and `m+263=D²`. And `m=B²`.\n    From `B²-263=C²`, we have `B²-C²=263` => `(B-C)(B+C)=263`. This yields `B=132`, `C=131`.\n    So `m = B² = 132² = 17424`.\n    We must verify all conditions. The pair `(m,n) = (17424, 263)` satisfies `m>n`, `gcd(m,n)=1` (`263` is prime and not a factor of `17424`), and `m,n` have opposite parity (even, odd).\n    Finally, we must check if `m+n = m+263` is a square `D²`.\n    `m+n = 17424 + 263 = 17689`.\n    `sqrt(17689) = 133`. So `D=133`. It is a perfect square.\n    This case yields a valid solution for `(m,n)`.\n\nThis pair `(m,n) = (17424, 263)` is the smallest integer solution found through this systematic search. It is highly likely to produce the hypotenuse with the smallest denominator.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the denominator\nWith `m=17424` and `n=263`, we can find `s_0`.\n`mn(m-n)(m+n) = 17424 * 263 * (17424-263) * (17424+263)`\n`= 17424 * 263 * 17161 * 17689`\n`= 132² * 263 * 131² * 133²`\n`= 263 * (132 * 131 * 133)²`\nThis matches our equation `mn(m-n)(m+n) = 263 * s_0²`, with `s_0 = 132 * 131 * 133`.\n`s_0 = 17292 * 133 = 2299836`.\n\nThe hypotenuse `c = (m²+n²) / s_0 = (17424² + 263²) / 2299836`.\nThe denominator is `s_0 / gcd(m²+n², s_0)`. We need to check if the numerator `N = m²+n²` and the denominator `s_0` share any prime factors.\nThe prime factors of `s_0 = 132 * 131 * 133` are the prime factors of `132=2²*3*11`, `131` (prime), and `133=7*19`. So the prime factors are 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 131.\n\n*   `mod 2`: `m=17424` is even, `n=263` is odd. `m²+n²` is odd. Not divisible by 2.\n*   `mod 3`: `m = 132²` is divisible by 3. `n=263 = 2 mod 3`, so `n² = 4 = 1 mod 3`. `m²+n² = 0+1=1 mod 3`. Not divisible by 3.\n*   `mod 7`: `m=132² = (-1)²=1 mod 7`. `n=263=4 mod 7`, `n²=16=2 mod 7`. `m²+n² = 1+2=3 mod 7`. Not divisible by 7.\n*   `mod 11`: `m=132²` is divisible by 11. `n=263=-1 mod 11`, `n²=1 mod 11`. `m²+n²=0+1=1 mod 11`. Not divisible by 11.\n*   `mod 19`: `m=132²=(-1)²=1 mod 19`. `n=263=-3 mod 19`, `n²=9 mod 19`. `m²+n²=1+9=10 mod 19`. Not divisible by 19.\n*   `mod 131`: `m=132²=1²=1 mod 131`. `n=263=1 mod 131`, `n²=1 mod 131`. `m²+n²=1+1=2 mod 131`. Not divisible by 131.\n\nSince `m²+n²` shares no prime factors with `s_0`, their `gcd` is 1.\nTherefore, the denominator of the hypotenuse `c` is `s_0`.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n`s_0 = 132 * 131 * 133 = 2299836`."
