    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks to identify a specific novel based on two key descriptions provided by the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges.\n    *   **Clue 1 (Description of the novel):** It has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n    *   **Clue 2 (Description of the author):** The author is \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n2.  **Analyze Clue 1: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"**\n    *   **\"Intensity of a tiger\"**: This metaphor suggests a work that is fierce, powerful, primal, and possibly violent. It points to raw emotional energy and high stakes.\n    *   **\"Variety that a chess duel can achieve\"**: This metaphor suggests a narrative that is intellectually complex, strategic, and intricately structured. Every element (character, plot point) is a deliberate \"move\" within a larger, calculated game. The \"variety\" implies multiple interwoven storylines, perspectives, or tactical shifts.\n    *   **Combination**: The novel must therefore be a powerful combination of visceral, intense storytelling and a highly sophisticated, almost mathematical, narrative structure.\n\n3.  **Analyze Clue 2: \"...its author as a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"**\n    *   **\"Continuator of Faulkner\"**: This points to a 20th-century author heavily influenced by the American modernist William Faulkner. Faulkner is famous for techniques like stream of consciousness, long and complex sentences, non-linear timelines, and multiple, unreliable narrators. This clue strongly suggests a writer from the Latin American Boom, a literary movement whose authors greatly admired and learned from Faulkner.\n    *   **\"(and simplifier)\"**: This is a crucial qualifier. It means the author, while adopting Faulkner's complex methods, makes them more accessible or organized. They create intricate structures, but these structures are ultimately decipherable and lucid, unlike some of Faulkner's more notoriously difficult passages. Borges himself valued clarity and intellectual structure, so this praise makes sense.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Author and Novel:**\n    *   We are looking for a major Latin American Boom novelist known for both intense subject matter and complex-yet-clear narrative structures, who was explicitly linked to Faulkner by Borges.\n    *   Several authors fit the \"Faulkner continuator\" description (like Gabriel García Márquez), but the combination of all clues points definitively to one individual: **Mario Vargas Llosa**.\n    *   Borges wrote a review of Vargas Llosa's debut novel, **_La ciudad y los perros_** (1963), which was translated into English as **_The Time of the Hero_**.\n    *   In his writing on this novel, Borges made precisely these points. He praised the book's narrative architecture and complex use of time and perspective, directly linking it to the tradition of Faulkner but noting Vargas Llosa's greater clarity.\n    *   The novel's plot, set in the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima, is filled with violence, adolescent rage, and brutal power dynamics, fitting the \"intensity of a tiger.\" Its narrative structure—weaving together different timelines and the perspectives of various characters (the \"dogs\" or cadets)—is notoriously complex, requiring the reader to solve it like a puzzle, which perfectly matches the \"variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is **_The Time of the Hero_** (original Spanish title: **_La ciudad y los perros_**) by the Peruvian author **Mario Vargas Llosa**.\n\n<<<The Time of the Hero (La ciudad y los perros)>>>"
