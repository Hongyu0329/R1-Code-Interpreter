    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct film.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The request is to identify a specific Hollywood feature film from a major studio. The query contains several distinct and crucial visual cues for the scene in question:\n    *   **Protagonist:** A teenager.\n    *   **Object:** A pink bicycle.\n    *   **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike *directly toward* an oncoming car.\n    *   **Production:** The film must be a feature-length Hollywood movie produced by a major studio (e.g., Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal, Sony, Disney/20th Century).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Elimination:** We can consider several films with teenagers and bikes but must check if they meet all criteria.\n    *   **\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982):** Features kids and teens on bikes, but there is no pink bike in a key role, and the famous confrontation with vehicles involves the bikes flying *over* them, not pedaling *toward* them.\n    *   **\"Pretty in Pink\" (1986):** The title is promising, but the iconic pink vehicle is a Volkswagen Karmann Ghia car, not a bicycle.\n    *   **\"Now and Then\" (1995):** Features four young girls on bikes, but none of the key scenes match this specific confrontation.\n    *   **\"Footloose\" (1984):** Features a famous \"game of chicken\" scene, but it involves two tractors, not a bike and a car.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Correct Film:** The combination of these specific elements points strongly to the 2017 horror film **\"It\"**. Let's carefully verify each point against this film.\n    *   **Hollywood Feature Film by a Major Studio:** \"It\" was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. This fits the criteria.\n    *   **Teenager:** The main characters, known as the Losers' Club, are all young teenagers. This fits.\n    *   **Pink Bike:** One of the main characters, Beverly Marsh, rides a distinct pink (or faded red/coral) bicycle. The presence of a \"pink bike\" associated with a key teenage character is confirmed.\n    *   **Pedal Directly Toward an Oncoming Car:** This exact action occurs in the film, but it is performed by a different member of the Losers' Club. In a pivotal scene, the bully Henry Bowers is chasing the group in his Pontiac Trans Am. To save his friends, the character **Eddie Kaspbrak** overcomes his timid nature, turns his own bicycle around, and pedals directly into the path of Bowers' speeding car. This forces Bowers to swerve violently and crash.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** The film **\"It\" (2017)** contains all the elements from the question. While the teenager with the pink bike (Beverly) is different from the teenager who charges the car (Eddie), they are part of the same core group, and these events are closely linked within the film's narrative. It is highly probable that these two memorable details were combined in memory. No other major Hollywood film matches this specific collection of elements so precisely.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is derived from the analysis above, which identifies the 2017 film \"It\" as the correct movie containing all the described elements.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
