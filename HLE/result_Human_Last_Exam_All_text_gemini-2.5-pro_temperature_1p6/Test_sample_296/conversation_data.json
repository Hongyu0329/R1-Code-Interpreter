    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (denoted by Γ).\n\n### Step 1: Framework for Counting Subgroups\nLet H be a subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group Γ. The action of Γ on the set of four left cosets of H defines a homomorphism `φ: Γ -> S_4`, where `S_4` is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, `Im(φ)`, must be a transitive subgroup of `S_4`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Properties of the Grigorchuk Group Γ\nThe Grigorchuk group has several key properties that constrain the possibilities for `Im(φ)`:\n1.  **Γ is a 2-group:** Every element in Γ has an order that is a power of 2. This implies that any homomorphic image of Γ must also be a 2-group.\n2.  **Γ has no C_4 or D_4 quotients:** It is a known, non-trivial result that Γ has no normal subgroups N such that the quotient group Γ/N is isomorphic to the cyclic group `C_4` or the dihedral group `D_8`. This means there are no surjective homomorphisms from Γ to `C_4` or `D_4`.\n\n### Step 3: Constrain the Possible Image `Im(φ)`\nThe transitive subgroups of `S_4` are:\n*   The cyclic group `C_4` (order 4).\n*   The Klein four-group `V_4` (order 4, isomorphic to `C_2 x C_2`).\n*   The dihedral group `D_4` (order 8).\n*   The alternating group `A_4` (order 12).\n*   The symmetric group `S_4` (order 24).\n\nFrom Property 1, `Im(φ)` must be a 2-group. This eliminates `A_4` and `S_4`.\nThe remaining possibilities for `Im(φ)` are `C_4`, `V_4`, and `D_4`.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze Each Possible Image\nLet `N = Ker(φ)` be the kernel of the action homomorphism. `N` is the normal core of `H` in `Γ` (`N = Core_Γ(H) = ∩_{g∈Γ} gHg^{-1}`). The index of this normal subgroup is `[Γ:N] = |Im(φ)|`. Also, since `N` is a subgroup of `H`, the index of `H` must divide the index of `N`.\n\n*   **Case 1: `Im(φ)` is `C_4`**\n    If `Im(φ)` is isomorphic to `C_4`, then `[Γ:N] = 4`. Since `N ≤ H` and `[Γ:H] = 4`, it must be that `H = N`. This means `H` is a normal subgroup and `Γ/H` is isomorphic to `C_4`. However, by Property 2, Γ has no `C_4` quotient. Thus, this case is impossible.\n\n*   **Case 2: `Im(φ)` is `D_4`**\n    If `Im(φ)` is isomorphic to `D_4`, then `[Γ:N] = 8`. This would mean `φ` is a surjective homomorphism from Γ onto `D_4`. However, by Property 2, Γ has no `D_4` quotient. So, this case is also impossible.\n\n*   **Case 3: `Im(φ)` is `V_4`**\n    If `Im(φ)` is isomorphic to `V_4`, then `[Γ:N] = 4`. As in the `C_4` case, this implies `H = N`. Therefore, any subgroup of index 4 in Γ must be a normal subgroup, and the corresponding quotient group must be isomorphic to `V_4`.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Number of Normal Subgroups with V_4 Quotient\nThe task is now reduced to finding the number of normal subgroups `H` in Γ such that `Γ/H ≅ V_4`. This number can be found by calculating the number of surjective homomorphisms (epimorphisms) from Γ to `V_4` and dividing by the size of the automorphism group of `V_4`.\n\n1.  **Homomorphisms from Γ to `V_4`**: Since `V_4` is an abelian group, any homomorphism `φ: Γ -> V_4` factors through the abelianization of Γ, which is `Γ_{ab} = Γ/[Γ, Γ]`. It is a well-known property of the Grigorchuk group that its abelianization is `Γ_{ab} ≅ (Z/2Z)^3 = C_2 x C_2 x C_2`. Therefore, we need to count the homomorphisms from `(Z/2Z)^3` to `V_4 ≅ (Z/2Z)^2`.\n    The number of such homomorphisms is the number of linear maps from the vector space `F_2^3` to `F_2^2`, which is `2^(3×2) = 64`.\n    So, `|Hom(Γ, V_4)| = 64`.\n\n2.  **Epimorphisms from Γ to `V_4`**: We must subtract the non-surjective homomorphisms. A homomorphism is not surjective if its image is a proper subgroup of `V_4`. The proper subgroups of `V_4` are the trivial group `{e}` and three distinct subgroups of order 2 (each isomorphic to `C_2`).\n    *   There is only **1** homomorphism to the trivial group.\n    *   The number of homomorphisms from `Γ_{ab} = (Z/2Z)^3` to `C_2 ≅ Z/2Z` is `|Hom((Z/2Z)^3, Z/2Z)| = 2^3 = 8`.\n    *   For each of the three `C_2` subgroups of `V_4`, there are `8 - 1 = 7` homomorphisms that have that specific subgroup as their image (we subtract 1 for the trivial homomorphism which maps to `{e}`).\n    *   The total number of non-surjective homomorphisms is `1 + 3 * 7 = 22`.\n    *   The number of surjective homomorphisms is `|Epi(Γ, V_4)| = 64 - 22 = 42`.\n\n3.  **Number of Subgroups**: Two epimorphisms `φ_1` and `φ_2` define the same normal subgroup (i.e., `Ker(φ_1) = Ker(φ_2)`) if and only if `φ_2 = α ο φ_1` for some automorphism `α` of `V_4`. We must divide by the number of automorphisms of `V_4`.\n    `Aut(V_4) ≅ GL(2, F_2) ≅ S_3`, and `|Aut(V_4)| = 6`.\n    The number of normal subgroups is `|Epi(Γ, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)| = 42 / 6 = 7`.\n\n### Final Answer\nSince all subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group must be normal with a quotient isomorphic to `V_4`, the total number of such subgroups is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
