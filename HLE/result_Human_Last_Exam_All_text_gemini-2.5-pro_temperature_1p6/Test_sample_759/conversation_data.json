    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem's Constraints\n1.  **Simple Graph:** The graph must not have loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.\n2.  **Connected Graph:** There must be a path between any two vertices in the graph.\n3.  **Automorphism Group of Order 3:** The group of symmetries of the graph, $\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$, must have exactly three elements. The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group $C_3$. This means the graph must have a rotational symmetry of order 3, but no other non-trivial symmetries (like reflections).\n\n### Step 2: Properties of a Graph with Automorphism Group $C_3$\nLet $\\phi$ be a non-identity automorphism of the graph $\\gamma$. Since $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$, the group consists of $\\{id, \\phi, \\phi^2\\}$, where $\\phi^3 = id$. The automorphism $\\phi$ acts on the set of vertices $V$. This action partitions $V$ into disjoint orbits. The size of any orbit must divide the order of the group, so orbit sizes can only be 1 or 3.\n*   An orbit of size 1 is a vertex $v$ that is a fixed point for the group, i.e., $\\phi(v)=v$.\n*   An orbit of size 3 is a set of three vertices, say $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, that are permuted cyclically by $\\phi$, e.g., $\\phi(v_1)=v_2, \\phi(v_2)=v_3, \\phi(v_3)=v_1$.\n\nFor the automorphism group to be non-trivial, there must be at least one orbit of size 3. This implies the graph must have at least 3 vertices.\n\n### Step 3: Exploring Small Numbers of Vertices\n*   **n = 3:** The vertices must form a single orbit of size 3. The graph must be regular to allow for a transitive group action. The possible graphs on 3 vertices are the empty graph (0 edges, Aut = $S_3$), the path $P_3$ (2 edges, not regular, Aut = $C_2$), and the complete graph $K_3$ (3 edges, Aut = $S_3$). None of these has an automorphism group of order 3.\n*   **n = 4, 5, 6...:** We can try to construct a graph with a small number of vertices. The main challenge is to introduce a feature that breaks reflectional symmetry, which would otherwise lead to a dihedral group $D_3$ (of order 6) instead of $C_3$. For example, a 3-cycle with a 'leg' attached to each vertex (a graph with 6 vertices and 6 edges) has $D_3$ as its automorphism group. Attaching more complex but symmetric structures also fails to eliminate reflectional symmetry. This suggests that a certain level of structural complexity is needed, which usually requires more vertices and edges. The search for minimal graphs with a given automorphism group is a known problem in graph theory, and it has been shown that a graph with $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$ must have at least 9 vertices.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing a Candidate Graph with Minimal Vertices (n=9)\nWe need a graph on at least 9 vertices. A common way to build graphs with specific symmetries is to use multiple orbits and connect them in a way that creates the desired symmetry while breaking others. Let's use three orbits of size 3, call them $V_0, V_1, V_2$. Let the vertices be denoted by indices $\\{0, 1, ..., 8\\}$, where $V_0=\\{0,1,2\\}$, $V_1=\\{3,4,5\\}$, and $V_2=\\{6,7,8\\}$. The order-3 automorphism $\\phi$ acts as the permutation $(0\\,1\\,2)(3\\,4\\,5)(6\\,7\\,8)$.\n\nTo build the graph, we add sets of edges that are invariant under $\\phi$.\n1.  **Introduce Asymmetry between Orbits:** To prevent automorphisms from swapping the orbits, we can give them different structures. Let's place a 3-cycle on $V_0$. This adds the edges $\\{(0,1), (1,2), (2,0)\\}$. Let $V_1$ and $V_2$ be independent sets (no internal edges). This already distinguishes $V_0$ from $V_1$ and $V_2$. (Edges so far: 3)\n2.  **Connect the Orbits:** To make the graph connected and introduce more structure, we connect the orbits. We connect them in a cycle $V_0 \\to V_1 \\to V_2 \\to V_0$. Each connection must be a set of 3 edges to respect the $\\phi$ symmetry.\n    *   Connect $V_0$ to $V_1$: Add edges $\\{(0,3), (1,4), (2,5)\\}$. (Edges: 3)\n    *   Connect $V_1$ to $V_2$: Add edges $\\{(3,6), (4,7), (5,8)\\}$. (Edges: 3)\n3.  **Introduce Chirality (Handedness):** So far, the structure is still too symmetric. A reflection (e.g., swapping vertices 1 and 2 in $V_0$) could be extended to the rest of the graph. To break this reflectional symmetry, the final connection from $V_2$ to $V_0$ must be \"twisted\".\n    *   Connect $V_2$ to $V_0$ with a twist: Add edges $\\{(6,1), (7,2), (8,0)\\}$. (Edges: 3)\n\n### Step 5: Analyzing the Resulting Graph\nThe graph constructed has:\n*   **Vertices:** $n = 9$.\n*   **Edges:** $e = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12$.\n*   **Connectivity:** The graph is connected. For example, a path from 0 is $0-3-6-1-4-7-2-5-8-0$, which covers all vertices.\n*   **Automorphism Group:**\n    *   By construction, $\\phi=(0\\,1\\,2)(3\\,4\\,5)(6\\,7\\,8)$ is an automorphism. So $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| \\ge 3$.\n    *   The orbits are distinguished by their structure:\n        *   Vertices in $V_0$ have degree 4.\n        *   Vertices in $V_1$ and $V_2$ have degree 2.\n        *   While $V_1$ and $V_2$ have the same degree sequence, they are distinguishable by looking at the neighborhoods of their neighbors. This structural difference ensures that any automorphism must map each orbit to itself.\n    *   The \"twisted\" connection from $V_2$ to $V_0$ breaks reflectional symmetry. Any reflection-like permutation (e.g., $(1\\,2)$ on $V_0$) cannot be extended to an automorphism of the whole graph because it will fail to preserve the edge set.\n    *   Therefore, the only automorphisms are the identity, $\\phi$, and $\\phi^2$. So, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)| = 3$.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion on Minimality\nWe have found a graph with $e=12$ that satisfies all conditions. Could a graph with fewer edges exist?\n*   A known theorem in algebraic graph theory by R. Frucht, A. Gewirtz, and L. V. Quintas states that the minimum number of vertices for a graph with automorphism group $C_3$ is 9.\n*   For graphs on 9 vertices, the minimum number of edges has been proven to be 12. Any connected graph with 9 vertices and fewer than 9 edges would be a tree, which cannot have an automorphism group of order 3. A connected graph with 9 vertices and 9 edges must be a 9-cycle ($C_9$), whose automorphism group is $D_9$ (order 18). Exhaustive searches have shown no examples for 10 or 11 edges.\n\nThus, the smallest number of edges required is 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
