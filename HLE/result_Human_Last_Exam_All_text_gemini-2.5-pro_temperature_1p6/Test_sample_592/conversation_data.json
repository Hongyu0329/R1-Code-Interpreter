    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The user wants to know the specific US city to which a character named Tommaso moves in the 1997 Italian film *Ovosodo*.\n\n2.  **Confirm the film and character details:** The film is *Ovosodo* (1997), directed by Paolo Virzì. The character is Tommaso, the best friend of the protagonist, Piero. Tommaso is indeed played by Marco Cocci.\n\n3.  **Analyze the character's story arc:** Tommaso comes from a wealthy family, in contrast to Piero. A pivotal moment in their friendship and in the plot is when Tommaso decides to leave their hometown of Livorno, Italy, to pursue opportunities abroad.\n\n4.  **Locate the specific plot point:** Researching the plot summary of *Ovosodo*, it is a key event that Tommaso moves to the United States. His departure signifies a divergence in the paths of the two friends—Piero stays in Livorno while Tommaso seeks a different life.\n\n5.  **Identify the specific city:** The film's narrative explicitly states that Tommaso moves to New York City to study music. This destination is often cited in summaries and analyses of the film as symbolic of the broader world and opportunities outside of their provincial town.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important to distinguish the character in question, **Tommaso**, from the main protagonist, **Piero**. Piero is the central figure of the film, and his life remains centered in Livorno.\n*   The actor, **Marco Cocci**, is correctly identified as playing Tommaso, which helps confirm the character.\n*   The year of the film, **1997**, is correct.\n*   The destination is a specific city in the US, not just the country in general. The plot provides this specific detail.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the plot of the movie *Ovosodo*, Tommaso leaves Livorno to move to the United States to study. The city he moves to is New York City.\n\n<<<New York City>>>"
