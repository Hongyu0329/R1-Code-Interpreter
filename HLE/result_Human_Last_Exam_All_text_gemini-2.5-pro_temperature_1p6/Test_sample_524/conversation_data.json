    "This question asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of topological spaces that satisfy three conditions simultaneously: they must be **homogeneous**, **planar**, and a **continuum**.\n\nLet's analyze each term and then proceed step-by-step to the classification.\n\n### **1. Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a point, a line segment, a circle, a closed disk.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space that can be embedded in the Euclidean plane ($R^2$). This means it is homeomorphic to a subset of the plane.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space X is homogeneous if for any two points x and y in X, there exists a homeomorphism h: X -> X (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that h(x) = y. Intuitively, this means the space \"looks the same\" at every point.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Analysis and Key Classification Points**\n\nThis is a classic and deep result in point-set topology, primarily established by the work of R. H. Bing in the mid-20th century. The classification hinges on a few key topological properties.\n\n**Step 1: Identify simple examples and non-examples.**\n\n*   **A single point:** This is a continuum (compact, connected, non-empty). It's planar. It is vacuously homogeneous. So, **the point** is one class.\n*   **The circle (or any simple closed curve):** This is a continuum and is planar. It is homogeneous because you can rotate any point to any other point. So, **the circle** is a second class.\n*   **A line segment:** This is a planar continuum but is **not** homogeneous. An endpoint cannot be mapped to an interior point by a homeomorphism of the segment onto itself.\n*   **A closed disk:** This is a planar continuum but is **not** homogeneous. A boundary point cannot be mapped to an interior point.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the crucial classification theorem based on the existence of arcs.**\n\nA fundamental theorem by R. H. Bing (1960) states: \"A simple closed curve is the only homogeneous bounded plane continuum that contains an arc.\"\nAn arc is any space homeomorphic to a closed interval [0, 1]. This theorem provides a powerful split in our classification.\n\n*   **Case 1: The homogeneous planar continuum contains an arc.**\n    According to Bing's theorem, this space must be homeomorphic to a simple closed curve (a circle). This gives us exactly one class of this type.\n\n*   **Case 2: The homogeneous planar continuum does *not* contain an arc.**\n    Such continua are called *arc-less*. This category includes the point (which is the degenerate case) and other more exotic objects. To classify these, we need another property.\n\n**Step 3: Sub-classify the arc-less continua.**\n\nFor the arc-less homogeneous planar continua, the next distinguishing property is whether or not they separate the plane.\n\n*   **The Point:** The point is the degenerate arc-less case. It does not separate the plane.\n\n*   **Non-degenerate, arc-less, and does *not* separate the plane:**\n    A major result, again due to Bing, shows that there is a unique object with these properties: **the pseudo-arc**. The pseudo-arc is a famous snake-like, indecomposable continuum. Bing proved it is homogeneous. By its construction in the plane, it is a planar continuum, and it is proven to be arc-less and not to separate the plane. All pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other. This gives a third class.\n\n*   **Non-degenerate, arc-less, and *does* separate the plane:**\n    A theorem by C. L. Hagopian (1977) proves that any such continuum must be a **circle of pseudo-arcs**. This object can be imagined by taking a circle and replacing each point of the circle with a pseudo-arc in a continuous fashion. This structure is homogeneous, is a planar continuum, contains no arcs, and separates the plane into a bounded and an unbounded component. This gives a fourth and final class.\n\n### **3. Summary of the Classes**\n\nThe complete classification of homogeneous planar continua yields four distinct homeomorphism classes:\n\n1.  **The Point:** The unique 0-dimensional example.\n2.  **The Circle (Simple Closed Curve):** The unique example that contains an arc. It is locally connected.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** An arc-less continuum that does not separate the plane. It is not locally connected.\n4.  **The Circle of Pseudo-arcs:** An arc-less continuum that separates the plane. It is not locally connected.\n\nThese four classes are topologically distinct from one another, and the cited theorems show that this classification is exhaustive. Therefore, there are exactly four such classes.\n\n<<<4>>>"
