    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition on the Convex Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The problem requires `K` to intersect every line `L` with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet `v = (p, q)` be a vector in `R^2` with integer components. If `p` and `q` are coprime, we call `v` a primitive integer vector. Let `S` be the set of all primitive integer vectors. The set of lines is given by `v · x = 1` for all `v` in `S`.\n\nA convex set `K` intersects a line `v · x = 1` if and only if `K` is not entirely contained in either of the open half-planes `v · x > 1` or `v · x < 1`. This can be expressed using the support function of `K`, which is defined as `h_K(v) = sup{v · x | x ∈ K}`.\n\nThe condition that `K` intersects `v · x = 1` means:\n`sup{v · x | x ∈ K} ≥ 1`  and  `inf{v · x | x ∈ K} ≤ 1`.\nIn terms of the support function, this is:\n`h_K(v) ≥ 1`  and  `-h_K(-v) ≤ 1`.\n\nThis must hold for all `v = (p, q)` in `S`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Condition\n\nThe set of primitive integer vectors `S` is centrally symmetric: if `v = (p, q)` is in `S`, then `-v = (-p, -q)` is also in `S` because `gcd(-p, -q) = gcd(p, q) = 1`.\n\nSo, for any `v` in `S`, the condition must also hold for `-v`:\n`h_K(-v) ≥ 1`  and  `-h_K(-(-v)) ≤ 1` which simplifies to `h_K(v) ≥ -1`.\n\nLet's combine the conditions for `v` and `-v`:\n1.  From line `v · x = 1`: `h_K(v) ≥ 1`.\n2.  From line `-v · x = 1`: `h_K(-v) ≥ 1`.\n\nThese two are the strongest conditions. So, the problem is equivalent to finding a convex domain `K` with the minimal area such that for every primitive integer vector `v`, `h_K(v) ≥ 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Reduction to Centrally Symmetric Domains\n\nLet `K` be any convex domain satisfying the condition `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`. Consider its Minkowski-symmetrized set, `K_s = (K - K) / 2 = { (x - y) / 2 | x, y ∈ K }`. `K_s` is a centrally symmetric convex domain.\n\nLet's check if `K_s` also satisfies the condition. The support function of `K_s` is `h_{K_s}(v) = (h_K(v) + h_K(-v)) / 2`.\nSince `K` is a solution, for any `v ∈ S`, we have `h_K(v) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-v) ≥ 1`.\nTherefore, `h_{K_s}(v) ≥ (1 + 1) / 2 = 1`.\nSo, `K_s` also satisfies the condition for all `v ∈ S`.\n\nBy the Rogers-Shephard inequality, the area of a convex body `K` and its symmetrization `K_s` are related by `Area(K_s) ≥ Area(K)`. Equality holds if and only if `K` is centrally symmetric (up to a translation, which doesn't change the area).\n\nIf we are looking for the minimal area, let `K_m` be a minimizer. Its symmetrization `(K_m)_s` is also a valid domain. Since `Area((K_m)_s) ≥ Area(K_m)`, and `K_m` has minimal area, we must have `Area((K_m)_s) = Area(K_m)`. This implies that the minimal-area domain `K_m` must be centrally symmetric.\n\nSo, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex domains.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Minimum Area for Centrally Symmetric Domains\n\nLet `K` be a centrally symmetric convex domain. The condition is `h_K(v) ≥ 1` for all `v ∈ S`.\n\nLet's consider specific primitive vectors:\n1.  `v = (1, 0)`: `h_K(1, 0) ≥ 1`. For a centrally symmetric set, `h_K(1, 0)` is the maximum x-coordinate, let's call it `a`. So `a ≥ 1`. The set `K` must contain the points `(±a, 0)`.\n2.  `v = (0, 1)`: `h_K(0, 1) ≥ 1`. This is the maximum y-coordinate, let's call it `b`. So `b ≥ 1`. The set `K` must contain the points `(0, ±b)`.\n\nSince `K` is convex, it must contain the convex hull of the points `(a, 0), (-a, 0), (0, b), (0, -b)`. This is a rhombus `R` with vertices at these points.\nThe area of this rhombus `R` is `(1/2) * (2a) * (2b) = 2ab`.\nThe area of `K` must be at least the area of this rhombus: `Area(K) ≥ Area(R) = 2ab`.\nSince `a ≥ 1` and `b ≥ 1`, we have a lower bound on the area: `Area(K) ≥ 2 * 1 * 1 = 2`.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Candidate for the Minimum\n\nThe lower bound for the area of any valid centrally symmetric set is 2. Let's see if this bound can be achieved.\nThis would happen if `a=1` and `b=1`, and `K` is the rhombus itself.\nLet's define our candidate domain `K_0` as the rhombus with vertices at `(±1, 0)` and `(0, ±1)`. The equation for this set is `|x| + |y| ≤ 1`.\n\nThe area of `K_0` is `2 * 1 * 1 = 2`.\n\nNow, we must verify if `K_0` satisfies the condition `h_{K_0}(p, q) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`.\nThe support function of `K_0 = { (x, y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1 }` is calculated by finding the maximum of `px + qy` over the set. The maximum must occur at one of the vertices `(±1, 0), (0, ±1)`.\n`sup_{K_0}(px+qy) = max(p, -p, q, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\nSo, `h_{K_0}(p, q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n\nWe need to check if `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`.\nIf `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero.\nIf `p=0`, `gcd(0,q)=|q|=1`, so `q=±1`. `max(|0|, |±1|) = 1`.\nIf `q=0`, `gcd(p,0)=|p|=1`, so `p=±1`. `max(|±1|, |0|) = 1`.\nIf `p ≠ 0` and `q ≠ 0`, then `|p| ≥ 1` and `|q| ≥ 1`, so `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`.\nThe condition is satisfied for all coprime integers `(p, q)`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimal area for a centrally symmetric domain is 2. We have shown that the search can be restricted to centrally symmetric domains. Therefore, the minimal area of any such convex domain is 2.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
