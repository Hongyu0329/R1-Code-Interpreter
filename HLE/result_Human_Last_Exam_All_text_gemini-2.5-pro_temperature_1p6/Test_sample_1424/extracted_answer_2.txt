In the energy-frequency representation $(k, \omega)$, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$ is that of an inverse function whose pole is located at $\epsilon_k$. The explicit form is $G_0(k, \omega) = (\omega - \epsilon_k + i\eta \, \text{sgn}(\epsilon_k - \mu))^{-1}$ for the real-frequency Feynman propagator, or $G_0(k, i\omega_n) = (i\omega_n - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$ for the imaginary-frequency Matsubara Green's function.
