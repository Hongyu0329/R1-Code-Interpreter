    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Analyze the Question and Identify Key Concepts**\n\n*   **Bare Green's Function ($G_0$):** This refers to the propagator of a single particle in a *non-interacting* system. It describes the probability amplitude for a particle to travel from one spacetime point to another without undergoing any interactions.\n*   **Feynman Path Integral Formalism:** This is the specific theoretical framework we must use. In this formalism, physical quantities are calculated by integrating over all possible configurations (paths or field histories), with each configuration weighted by a phase factor $e^{iS/\\hbar}$ (or $e^{-S_E}$ in Euclidean time), where $S$ is the classical action.\n*   **Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$):** These are the energies of the stationary states of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, $H_0$. The quantum number '$k$' represents the set of labels that uniquely identify a single-particle eigenstate (e.g., momentum, spin).\n*   **Functional Dependence:** The core of the question is to find the mathematical formula that connects $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$. We need to show how $G_0$ is constructed from $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**2. List Careful Points and Strategy**\n\n*   **Connecting Action to Hamiltonian:** The path integral is defined using the action, $S_0$. The energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ are derived from the Hamiltonian, $H_0$. We must first establish the connection between $S_0$ and $H_0$. For a non-relativistic system, the Lagrangian is $L_0 = T - V$, and the action is $S_0 = \\int dt \\, L_0$. The Hamiltonian is $H_0 = T+V$. This information is encoded in the kernel of the action.\n*   **Inversion of the Operator:** The Green's function in the path integral formalism is fundamentally the inverse of the operator that appears in the quadratic part of the action. That is, if $S_0 = \\int d^4x \\, \\phi^*(x) \\mathcal{O} \\phi(x)$, then $G_0(x, y)$ is the integral kernel corresponding to the inverse operator $\\mathcal{O}^{-1}$.\n*   **Choosing the Right Basis:** Inverting an operator is easiest in the basis where it is diagonal. The operator in the free action, $\\mathcal{O}$, is diagonal in the basis of its eigenstates. Since $\\mathcal{O}$ is directly related to the free Hamiltonian $H_0$, its eigenbasis is the same as the energy eigenbasis. Therefore, transforming to the basis labeled by the quantum numbers '$k$' and frequency '$\\omega$' (i.e., momentum-frequency space) is the most effective strategy.\n*   **Real vs. Imaginary Time:** The formalism can be expressed in either real time (Minkowski spacetime, leading to the Feynman propagator) or imaginary time (Euclidean spacetime, leading to the Matsubara Green's function). The relationship between $G_0$ and $\\epsilon_k$ is most transparent in the frequency-domain representation of both. We will derive the result in the imaginary-time formalism first, as the math is often more straightforward, and then state the real-time equivalent via analytic continuation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Acquisition of the Final Answer\n\n**Step 1: The Free Action in the Path Integral**\n\nLet's consider a system of non-interacting fermions (the logic is identical for bosons, with minor changes in statistics). The free action $S_0$ in imaginary time ($\\tau = it$) can be written in the basis of energy eigenstates $|k\\rangle$:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + H_0) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\nHere, $\\psi_k^*(\\tau)$ and $\\psi_k(\\tau)$ are Grassmann fields for the state $|k\\rangle$, and $\\beta = 1/k_B T$ is the inverse temperature. When the operator $H_0$ acts on the eigenstate represented by $\\psi_k$, it simply returns the eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\psi_k^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n\n**Step 2: Fourier Transform to Frequency Space**\n\nTo diagonalize the action completely, we must also handle the time-derivative term, $\\partial_\\tau$. We do this by performing a Fourier series expansion (since imaginary time is periodic on $[0, \\beta]$). The fields are written as:\n$\\psi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_{n} e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_{k,n}$\nwhere $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$ are the fermionic Matsubara frequencies. The derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ acting on this field becomes a multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. Substituting this into the action gives:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}^* (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the Green's Function**\n\nThe imaginary-time Green's function in this basis is defined as $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = -\\langle \\psi_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}^* \\rangle$. From the path integral, this expectation value is calculated as the inverse of the term in the now-diagonal action.\nThe action has the form $S_0 = \\sum \\psi^* \\mathcal{O} \\psi$, where the operator in $(k, \\omega_n)$ space is just the number $\\mathcal{O}_{k,n} = (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k)$.\nThe Green's function is the inverse of this operator kernel (up to a sign depending on convention):\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k)} = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\nThis is the **Matsubara Green's function**. It shows a very clear dependence: it is a simple rational function of $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n**Step 4: Analytic Continuation to Real Frequencies**\n\nTo find the real-time Feynman propagator, we perform an analytic continuation from the discrete imaginary frequencies $i\\omega_n$ to the continuous real frequency $\\omega$ via the replacement $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\eta$, where $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal that enforces causality.\nHowever, a careful treatment using the Lehmann representation shows that the sign of the infinitesimal term depends on whether the state $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied or unoccupied relative to the chemical potential $\\mu$. This gives the final form for the time-ordered Feynman propagator:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(x)$ is the sign function. This can also be written as two parts:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{\\theta(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta} + \\frac{\\theta(\\mu - \\epsilon_k)}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k - i\\eta}$\nwhere $\\theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn both the imaginary and real-time formalisms, the bare Green's function $G_0$ has a simple inverse dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ defines the location of the pole of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane. Physically, this means that the particle propagates most efficiently (the propagator diverges) when its energy $\\omega$ matches one of the allowed stationary-state energies $\\epsilon_k$ of the system.\n\n***\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ in the energy-frequency domain has a pole structure that is directly determined by the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$. In the commonly used imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism, the dependence is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\nAfter analytic continuation to real frequencies $\\omega$, the time-ordered (Feynman) Green's function becomes:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nIn both cases, $G_0$ is functionally dependent on $\\epsilon_k$ as an inverse relationship of the form $(X - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $X$ is the frequency variable ($i\\omega_n$ or $\\omega$) and $\\epsilon_k$ sets the location of the pole.\n\n<<<In the energy-frequency representation $(k, \\omega)$, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ is that of an inverse function whose pole is located at $\\epsilon_k$. The explicit form is $G_0(k, \\omega) = (\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\, \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu))^{-1}$ for the real-frequency Feynman propagator, or $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = (i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ for the imaginary-frequency Matsubara Green's function.>>>"
