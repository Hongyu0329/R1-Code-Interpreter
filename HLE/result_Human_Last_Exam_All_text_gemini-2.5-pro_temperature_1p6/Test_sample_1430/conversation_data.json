    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Objects**\n\n*   **C:** A smooth, projective, complex algebraic curve of genus `g = 3`. This is a Riemann surface.\n*   **X = Sym^15(C):** The 15th symmetric power of C. This is the variety whose points are effective divisors of degree 15 on C. An effective divisor of degree 15 is a formal sum `P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_15`, where the `P_i` are points on `C` (not necessarily distinct). `X` is a smooth complex projective variety of dimension 15.\n*   **Neron-Severi Group, NS(X):** This is the group of divisors on X modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely generated abelian group.\n*   **Rank of the Neron-Severi Group, ρ(X):** This is the rank of NS(X) as a free abelian group, also known as the Picard number of X. We need to find the smallest and largest possible values of `ρ(X)` as `C` varies over all genus 3 curves.\n\n**2. The Key Formula (Macdonald's Theorem)**\n\nA fundamental result by I.G. Macdonald relates the cohomology (and thus the Neron-Severi group) of the symmetric power of a curve to the cohomology of the curve itself and its Jacobian.\n\n*   **Jacobian Variety, Jac(C):** For a curve `C` of genus `g`, its Jacobian `Jac(C)` is a `g`-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. For our case, `g=3`, so `Jac(C)` is a 3-dimensional abelian variety.\n\n*   **The Isomorphism:** For a smooth curve `C` of genus `g` and an integer `d ≥ g`, the pullback maps induce an isomorphism on Neron-Severi groups (tensored with `Q`):\n    `NS(C) ⊗ Q ⊕ NS(Jac(C)) ⊗ Q  ≅ NS(Sym^d(C)) ⊗ Q`\n\n*   Taking the dimensions of these vector spaces, we get a formula for the ranks:\n    `ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))`\n\n*   **Checking the condition:** In our problem, `d=15` and `g=3`. Since `15 ≥ 3`, the condition is satisfied. So, we have:\n    `ρ(X) = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))`\n\n**3. Analyzing the Components of the Formula**\n\nTo find the minimum and maximum of `ρ(X)`, we need to analyze the possible values of `ρ(C)` and `ρ(Jac(C))`.\n\n*   **Rank of NS(C):** For any smooth projective curve `C`, the Neron-Severi group `NS(C)` is generated by the class of a point. It is isomorphic to the integers `Z`. Therefore, its rank is always 1.\n    `ρ(C) = 1`\n    This part is constant and does not vary with the choice of `C`.\n\n*   **Rank of NS(Jac(C)):** This is the part that varies. The rank `ρ(Jac(C))` depends on the algebraic structure of the specific curve `C`. `Jac(C)` is a 3-dimensional abelian variety. The rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety `A` is related to its ring of endomorphisms `End(A)`. Specifically, it is related to the existence of \"extra\" endomorphisms beyond multiplication by integers, a property known as Complex Multiplication (CM).\n\n**4. Finding the Smallest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The smallest rank `ρ(X)` will occur when `ρ(Jac(C))` is minimized.\n*   **The \"Very General\" Case:** For a \"very general\" curve `C` (meaning a curve corresponding to a point in a Zariski open dense subset of the moduli space of genus 3 curves `M_3`), its Jacobian has the smallest possible endomorphism ring. That is, `End(Jac(C)) = Z`.\n*   When `End(Jac(C)) = Z`, the Neron-Severi group `NS(Jac(C))` is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). In this case, `NS(Jac(C))` is isomorphic to `Z`.\n*   Therefore, the minimum possible rank for `ρ(Jac(C))` is 1.\n*   **Calculation of the Smallest Rank:**\n    `ρ(X)_{min} = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))_{min} = 1 + 1 = 2`\n\n**5. Finding the Largest Possible Rank**\n\n*   The largest rank `ρ(X)` will occur when `ρ(Jac(C))` is maximized.\n*   **The \"Special\" Case (Complex Multiplication):** The rank `ρ(Jac(C))` is maximized when the abelian variety `Jac(C)` has the largest possible endomorphism ring. This occurs for special curves with Complex Multiplication.\n*   **Maximal Rank for an Abelian Variety:** A key theorem in the theory of abelian varieties states that for a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A`, the maximum possible rank of its Neron-Severi group is `g^2`.\n    `ρ(A)_{max} = g^2`\n*   In our case, `Jac(C)` is a `g=3` dimensional abelian variety. So, the maximum possible rank is:\n    `ρ(Jac(C))_{max} = 3^2 = 9`\n*   **Existence:** We must ensure that there exists a genus 3 curve `C` whose Jacobian actually achieves this maximum rank. Such curves exist. For example, the Fermat quartic curve, defined by `x^4 + y^4 = z^4`, is a genus 3 curve whose Jacobian is isogenous to the product of three copies of a specific elliptic curve with complex multiplication by `Z[i]`. This structure gives its Jacobian the maximal Neron-Severi rank of 9.\n*   **Calculation of the Largest Rank:**\n    `ρ(X)_{max} = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))_{max} = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Correct Formula:** The central point is using the correct formula `ρ(Sym^d(C)) = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))` and verifying that the condition `d ≥ g` holds.\n2.  **Constant vs. Variable Part:** Recognize that `ρ(C)` is always 1, so the variation in `ρ(X)` comes entirely from the variation in `ρ(Jac(C))`.\n3.  **Very General Case:** Understand that for a \"very general\" curve, its Jacobian has no special properties, meaning `End(Jac(C)) = Z` and consequently `ρ(Jac(C)) = 1`. This gives the minimum.\n4.  **Special CM Case:** Understand that the maximum `ρ(Jac(C))` is achieved for special curves with complex multiplication.\n5.  **Maximal Rank Theorem:** Know the upper bound `ρ(A) ≤ g^2` for a `g`-dimensional abelian variety `A`.\n6.  **Existence:** Confirm that a genus 3 curve exists which realizes this maximal rank `ρ(Jac(C))=9`.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ(X)_{min} = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))_{min} = 1 + 1 = 2`\n*   **Largest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    `ρ(X)_{max} = ρ(C) + ρ(Jac(C))_{max} = 1 + 9 = 10`\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<Smallest: 2, Largest: 10>>>"
