    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Determine the Diagram's Topology\n\nThe question describes a Feynman diagram with the following properties:\n*   **Two vertices:** Let's call them `v1` and `v2`.\n*   **Four field contractions:** A \"field contraction\" corresponds to a propagator, which is represented as a line in the diagram. So, we have four lines.\n*   **Context:** The analysis is for a perturbative Green's function. This implies the vertices come from an interaction term in the Lagrangian, for instance, `L_int = (λ/n!)φⁿ`. For a connected diagram with two vertices and four lines between them, each vertex must have four lines attached. This points to a `φ⁴` theory, which is a standard example for such problems.\n\nGiven these constraints, we must determine how two vertices can be connected by four lines. The only possible topology is one where all four lines connect vertex `v1` to vertex `v2`.\n\nVisually, the diagram looks like this:\n```\n      /-----\\\n     /       \\\n (v1)========= (v2)\n     \\       /\n      \\-----/\n```\nHere, `(v1)` and `(v2)` are the vertices, and the four parallel lines between them are the four propagators (field contractions).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nThe symmetry factor, `S`, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group. In practice, it's the number of ways you can permute the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) that leave the overall structure of the diagram unchanged. We can calculate it by multiplying the factors from different types of symmetry.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Symmetry from interchanging identical vertices.**\n*   The two vertices, `v1` and `v2`, are of the same type (both from the `φ⁴` interaction).\n*   Can we swap the labels of `v1` and `v2`? If we do, the diagram remains identical: four lines connecting the two points.\n*   Therefore, there is a symmetry related to the permutation of these two vertices. The number of such permutations is `2!`.\n*   Symmetry factor from vertices = `2! = 2`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Symmetry from interchanging identical lines.**\n*   We have four lines connecting the *same two* vertices, `v1` and `v2`.\n*   These four lines are identical propagators for the same field `φ`.\n*   Can we permute these four lines among themselves? Yes, any permutation of these four lines results in the exact same diagram.\n*   Therefore, there is a symmetry related to the permutation of these four lines. The number of such permutations is `4!`.\n*   Symmetry factor from lines = `4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Other possible symmetries.**\n*   Another potential symmetry is from lines connecting a vertex to itself (a \"tadpole\" loop), which usually contributes a factor of 2. In our diagram, there are no such lines. All lines connect `v1` to `v2`. Thus, this rule does not apply here.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor `S` is the product of the factors from each independent symmetry operation.\n\n*   `S = (Factor from vertex permutations) × (Factor from line permutations)`\n*   `S = 2! × 4!`\n*   `S = 2 × 24`\n*   `S = 48`\n\nTherefore, the symmetry factor associated with this Feynman diagram is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
