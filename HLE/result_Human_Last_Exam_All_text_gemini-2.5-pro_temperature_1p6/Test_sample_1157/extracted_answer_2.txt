The specific procedures for her appropriate management begin with **systemic stabilization**. She must be immediately referred to a physician to manage her uncontrolled diabetes and obesity. The goal is to lower her HbA1c to below 7.0% before any definitive dental work to ensure proper wound healing and reduce infection risk.

Her immediate dental management involves:
1.  **Comprehensive radiographic and clinical examination** to assess the trauma to the bone and remaining teeth.
2.  **Wound debridement, irrigation, and suturing** of the sockets and soft tissues.
3.  **Prescription of antibiotics and analgesics** due to the high risk of infection from the delayed presentation and her diabetic status.
4.  Fabrication of an **interim acrylic partial denture** for immediate aesthetics, space maintenance, and function during the healing period.

The **cells of interest** in the healing process are:
*   **Inflammatory cells (Neutrophils and Macrophages):** Their function is impaired by hyperglycemia, delaying the initial clearing of debris and increasing infection risk.
*   **Healing cells (Fibroblasts and Endothelial cells):** High blood sugar hampers their ability to produce collagen and form new blood vessels (angiogenesis), leading to delayed and poor-quality tissue repair.
*   **Bone cells (Osteoblasts and Osteoclasts):** Diabetes negatively affects osteoblast (bone-forming cell) function, which can lead to impaired healing and greater bone loss in the sockets.

For the definitive prosthesis, after 3-6 months of healing and with medical clearance:
*   **Kind of Denture:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture** is the most appropriate choice. It is conservative to the remaining teeth, hygienic, and robust.
*   **Material:** The framework should be made of a **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy** for rigidity and support. The denture base holding the artificial teeth will be made of **pink acrylic resin**.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Primary Abutments:** The **left central incisor** and the **left second premolar** will be the primary abutments as they are adjacent to the edentulous space.
    *   **Secondary/Stabilizing Abutments:** To counteract the significant forces from her Class III skeletal pattern and provide cross-arch stabilization, the **right canine and right first premolar** must also be included in the design.
    *   **Reasoning:** This design is chosen because it preserves healthy tooth structure (unlike a bridge), is removable for optimal oral hygiene (critical for a diabetic patient), and the cross-arch stabilization is essential to create a stable prosthesis that can resist the rotational forces and challenging bite associated with a severe Class III jaw relationship. It is also a more financially accessible and less biologically risky option than dental implants in this complex case.
