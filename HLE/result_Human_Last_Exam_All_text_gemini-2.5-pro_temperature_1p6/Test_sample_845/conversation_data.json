    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG) is used. This technology measures changes in blood volume in the microvascular bed of tissue, typically at the finger or wrist. The waveform produced is a pulse wave.\n    *   **Core Measurement:** The system captures \"beat-to-beat intervals.\" This means it measures the time that elapses between one heartbeat (or pulse) and the next.\n    *   **Core Calculation:** Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is \"computed as a value between heartbeats.\" This is a slight simplification, as HRV is the measure of *variation* across a series of these intervals, not a single value. However, the question is asking for the name of that fundamental interval value itself.\n\n2.  **Identify the Terminology for the Interval:**\n    *   The time between heartbeats is the foundational data point for all HRV analysis. This duration has several names, and the specific term can depend on the measurement source and the stage of data processing.\n    *   **From an ECG (Electrocardiogram):** The gold standard for measuring this interval is from an ECG. The most prominent electrical signal of a heartbeat is the \"R-wave.\" The time between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R interval**.\n    *   **From a PPG:** Since PPG measures a pulse wave, the time is measured between the peaks of two consecutive pulses. This is sometimes called a **Peak-to-Peak Interval (PPI)** or, more generally, an **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**. \"IBI\" is a widely used and technology-agnostic term for this measurement.\n    *   **For HRV Computation (The crucial point):** In HRV analysis, it's critical to only use intervals originating from normal heartbeats (i.e., those initiated by the sinoatrial node). Irregular beats, such as artifacts or ectopic beats (e.g., premature ventricular contractions), can dramatically skew HRV results and must be filtered out. The time interval between two consecutive *normal* heartbeats is specifically called a **Normal-to-Normal Interval**, almost universally abbreviated as the **NN Interval**. Standard HRV metrics like SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals) and RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences between NN intervals) are explicitly calculated using this series of cleaned, normal intervals.\n\n3.  **Synthesize and Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   The user asks for the name of the \"value between heartbeats\" that is used to *compute* HRV.\n    *   While \"Inter-beat Interval (IBI)\" is the general term for the raw measurement from a device like a PPG sensor, the term used specifically for the data that enters the HRV calculation algorithms (after filtering) is the **NN Interval**.\n    *   Therefore, the most precise and correct answer in the context of HRV *computation* is the NN Interval.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **PPG vs. ECG:** While R-R intervals from an ECG are the gold standard, modern PPG sensors and algorithms have become very accurate at deriving the IBI, which serves as a reliable proxy for the R-R interval.\n*   **Raw vs. Processed Data:** The raw data is the series of IBIs. The data used for final calculation is the series of NN Intervals. The question implies the data used for computation, making \"NN Interval\" the most specific answer.\n*   **HRV is not a single interval:** It's important to remember that HRV is a measure of variability *over time*, not the value of a single interval. It requires a collection of many NN intervals to calculate meaningful metrics.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe question asks for the name of the value measured between heartbeats that is used to compute HRV. This value is the time duration. After cleaning the raw data to remove artifacts and abnormal beats, this time duration between two consecutive normal beats is called the **Normal-to-Normal Interval** or **NN Interval**. This is the term used in the formulas for standard HRV metrics.\n\n<<<NN (Normal-to-Normal) Interval"
