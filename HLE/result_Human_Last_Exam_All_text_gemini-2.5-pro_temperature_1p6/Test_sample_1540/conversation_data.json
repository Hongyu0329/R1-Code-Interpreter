    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to arrive at the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Task:** The goal is to compare two strings lexicographically. The comparison must be case-insensitive, meaning 'A' is treated as equal to 'a'.\n\n2.  **Input and Constraints Analysis:**\n    *   Two strings are given as input, each on a new line.\n    *   They are guaranteed to have the same length, which is between 1 and 100 characters.\n    *   The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n    *   The critical constraint for memory optimization is that the strings are on separate lines. This implies that we must read and process the entire first line before the second line can be accessed from the input stream.\n\n3.  **Algorithm for Comparison:**\n    *   The standard way to compare strings lexicographically is character by character, from left to right.\n    *   Let the two strings be `s1` and `s2`. We iterate with an index `i` from 0 up to the string length minus one.\n    *   In each step `i`, we compare the characters `s1[i]` and `s2[i]`.\n    *   Because the comparison is case-insensitive, we must convert both characters to a common case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase) before comparing them. The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is ideal for this.\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(s2[i])`, then `s1` is lexicographically smaller. We can stop and output \"-1\".\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(s2[i])`, then `s1` is lexicographically larger. We can stop and output \"1\".\n    *   If `tolower(s1[i]) == tolower(s2[i])`, the strings are equal at this position, so we continue to the next character.\n    *   If the loop finishes without finding any difference, the strings are identical in a case-insensitive sense. We output \"0\".\n\n4.  **Memory Efficiency Strategy:**\n    *   A straightforward approach is to declare two character arrays (e.g., `char s1[101], s2[101];`) and read both strings into them. This is functionally correct but not the most memory-efficient, as it would require `101 + 101 = 202` bytes for the buffers alone.\n    *   To optimize memory, we must minimize the data stored. Due to the line-separated input, we are forced to read the first string and store it in a buffer to be able to compare it against the second string. Therefore, a buffer for the first string is unavoidable.\n    *   However, we do *not* need to store the second string in its entirety. We can read the first string into a buffer, and then read the second string one character at a time. As each character of the second string is read, it can be immediately compared with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n    *   This \"one-buffer\" approach is the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n5.  **Identifying Necessary Variables and Calculating Memory:**\n    To implement the one-buffer strategy, we need the following minimal set of variables within our C program's `main` function:\n    *   **A buffer for the first string:** `char s1[101];`\n        *   The maximum string length is 100. We need 1 extra byte for the null terminator (`\\0`) that C strings require.\n        *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` byte = **101 bytes**.\n    *   **An index for the loop:** `char i;`\n        *   We need an index to iterate through the `s1` buffer. Since the length is at most 100, the index will go from 0 to 99. The `char` data type is sufficient to hold these values and is the most memory-efficient integer type (`sizeof(char)` is 1 byte, whereas `sizeof(int)` is typically 4 bytes).\n        *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n    *   **A variable for characters from the second string:** `char c2;`\n        *   This variable will hold each character of the second string as it is read from the input stream using a function like `getchar()`.\n        *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n    **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n    The total memory `m` used by the variables in the most memory-efficient program is the sum of the memory used by each variable.\n    m = (memory for `s1`) + (memory for `i`) + (memory for `c2`)\n    m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte = **103 bytes**.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Buffer Size:** Always allocate `length + 1` for a C-style string buffer to account for the null terminator.\n*   **Variable Data Types:** For memory efficiency, use the smallest data type that can safely hold the required range of values. Using `char` for an index that won't exceed 100 is a good optimization.\n*   **Input Handling:** When using `scanf(\"%s\", ...)` followed by `getchar()`, remember that `scanf` leaves the newline character (`\\n`) in the input buffer. This newline must be consumed before you can start reading the characters of the second string with `getchar()`.\n*   **Case Conversion:** Always use `tolower()` or `toupper()` on both characters being compared to ensure the comparison is truly case-insensitive.\n*   **Problem Interpretation:** The question asks for the memory used by \"variables\". This is standardly interpreted as the memory allocated on the stack for variables declared by the programmer, not including runtime overhead or memory for the program's code itself.\n\nBy following this analysis, the most memory-efficient C program would be one that declares one character array of size 101, and two other single-byte character variables for the index and temporary character storage.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nTotal memory m = `sizeof(char[101])` + `sizeof(char)` + `sizeof(char)`\nm = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n\n<<<103>>>"
