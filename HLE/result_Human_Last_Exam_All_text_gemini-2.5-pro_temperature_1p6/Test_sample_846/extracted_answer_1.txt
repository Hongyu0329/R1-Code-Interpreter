To be functionally accurate, the picnic table must change its shape. When the sun rises and exposes the table to UV light, it must bend or fold (mimicking the switch from the *trans* to the *cis* isomer). When the sun sets and it gets dark, the table must straighten out again (mimicking the thermal relaxation from the *cis* back to the more stable *trans* isomer).
