The primary reason a fully functional MRI receive coil shows no resonance on a bench test is because it is an **active device** that is not in its operational state. Modern coils contain **active detuning circuits** (usually involving PIN diodes) that protect them from the high-power transmit pulse. By design, these circuits are fail-safe, meaning they keep the coil in a **non-resonant state** when it is unpowered and disconnected from the scanner. Furthermore, the coil's integrated **low-noise preamplifier (LNA)** is also unpowered. The input of the inactive LNA presents an improper impedance to the coil's resonant element, which severely damps or kills its resonance. Therefore, your sniffer coil cannot couple to a resonance that has been intentionally deactivated for safety and is being damped by an unpowered amplifier. To properly test such a coil on the bench, a special fixture is required to supply the necessary DC power and control signals to switch it into its active, resonant "receive" mode.
