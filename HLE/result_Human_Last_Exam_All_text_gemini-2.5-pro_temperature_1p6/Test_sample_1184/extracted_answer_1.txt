Here is the final answer based on the step-by-step analysis:

The residue numbering is based on the human β1b canonical isoform (UniProt: P54283-1, 597 amino acids).

**1. Hotspots for Interaction (Binding) with the Alpha-1 Subunit:**

These residues are located in the Beta Interaction Domain (BID) on the GK domain and are critical for the physical binding of the β1 subunit to the α1 subunit's AID region.

*   **Y252** (Tyrosine at position 252)
*   **K263** (Lysine at position 263)
*   **M283** (Methionine at position 283)
*   **V285** (Valine at position 285)
*   **L334** (Leucine at position 334)
*   **V338** (Valine at position 338)
*   **W364** (Tryptophan at position 364) - Extremely critical for binding.
*   **D370** (Aspartate at position 370)
*   **E371** (Glutamate at position 371)
*   **Y392** (Tyrosine at position 392) - Extremely critical for binding.
*   **I394** (Isoleucine at position 394)

**2. Hotspots for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties (Gating Modulation):**

These residues and regions are located outside the primary binding interface and are crucial for allosterically modulating the α1 subunit's function (e.g., its voltage sensitivity and inactivation rate).

*   **N-Terminal Basic Patch:** The cluster of **K75, K76, K78, R80** (Lysines and Arginine). This patch strongly influences the voltage-dependence of activation.
*   **N-Terminal Region:** The segment spanning residues **86-103**. This region also contributes to the modulation of activation.
*   **SH3 Domain:** The residues **E197** (Glutamate) and **D199** (Aspartate). These are involved in an exosite interaction that modulates channel inactivation.
*   **GK Domain "Exosite":** The residue **H365** (Histidine). This residue acts as a pH sensor, altering channel inactivation kinetics based on its protonation state.
