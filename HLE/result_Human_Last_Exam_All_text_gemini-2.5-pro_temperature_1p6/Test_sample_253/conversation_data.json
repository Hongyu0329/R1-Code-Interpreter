    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the binary pattern for Rule 110 after 20 steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Components of the Problem**\n\n*   **Cellular Automaton:** A system of cells on a grid that evolve through discrete time steps.\n*   **Elementary Cellular Automaton:** A specific type of 1D cellular automaton where each cell has two states (0 or 1) and its next state is determined by its own state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors.\n*   **Rule 110:** This is the specific rule that governs the evolution of the cells. The rule number defines the output for all 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood configurations.\n*   **Initial State:** The automaton starts with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by an infinite grid of cells in state 0.\n*   **Task:** Apply Rule 110 for 20 iterations (generations) and find the resulting binary pattern of 1s and 0s.\n\n**2. Decoding Rule 110**\n\nTo use Rule 110, we must first determine the output for each of the 8 possible neighborhood patterns. This is done by converting the rule number, 110, into its 8-bit binary representation.\n\n*   110 (decimal) = **01101110** (binary)\n\nThis binary string is then mapped to the neighborhood patterns, which are typically listed in descending order from `111` to `000`.\n\n| Neighborhood (Current State) | Output (Next State) |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 111                          | **0**                 |\n| 110                          | **1**                 |\n| 101                          | **1**                 |\n| 100                          | **0**                 |\n| 011                          | **1**                 |\n| 010                          | **1**                 |\n| 001                          | **1**                 |\n| 000                          | **0**                 |\n\n**3. Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Boundary Conditions:** The grid of cells is infinite. When calculating the state of a cell at the edge of the current pattern, any neighbor outside the pattern is assumed to be 0. For example, to calculate the next state for the leftmost '1' in the pattern `...01...`, its neighborhood is `001`.\n*   **Systematic Application:** The process is iterative and highly sensitive to small errors. Each cell in the new generation must be calculated by looking at the correct 3-cell neighborhood in the previous generation. It is essential to be methodical.\n*   **Pattern Growth:** The pattern of 1s can grow by a maximum of one cell on each side per generation. The calculation space must be expanded accordingly.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Generation by Generation\n\nWe will now apply the Rule 110 table starting from a single '1' and iterate 20 times. For each step, we show the non-zero part of the pattern.\n\n*   **Generation 0:** `1`\n*   **Generation 1:** Based on `...00100...`. The neighborhoods `001` and `010` both produce a `1`. Pattern: `11`\n*   **Generation 2:** Based on `...001100...`. The neighborhoods `001`, `011`, and `110` produce `1`, `1`, `1`. Pattern: `111`\n*   **Generation 3:** Based on `...01110...`. Pattern: `1101`\n*   **Generation 4:** Based on `...011010...`. Pattern: `11111`\n*   **Generation 5:** Based on `...0111110...`. Pattern: `110001`\n*   **Generation 6:** Based on `...01100010...`. Pattern: `1110011`\n*   **Generation 7:** Based on `...011100110...`. Pattern: `11010111`\n*   **Generation 8:** Based on `...0110101110...`. Pattern: `111111101`\n*   **Generation 9:** Based on `...0111111010...`. Pattern: `110000111`\n*   **Generation 10:** Based on `...01100001110...`. Pattern: `1110001101`\n*   **Generation 11:** Based on `...011100011010...`. Pattern: `11010011111`\n*   **Generation 12:** Based on `...0110100111110...`. Pattern: `111110110001`\n*   **Generation 13:** Based on `...01111101100010...`. Pattern: `1100011110011`\n*   **Generation 14:** Based on `...011000111100110...`. Pattern: `11100110010111`\n*   **Generation 15:** Based on `...0111001100101110...`. Pattern: `1101011101111010`\n*   **Generation 16:** Based on `...01101011101111010...`. Pattern: `1111111011100111`\n*   **Generation 17:** Based on `...01111110111001110...`. Pattern: `11000011101011010`\n*   **Generation 18:** Based on `...011000011101011010...`. Pattern: `111000110111111110`\n*   **Generation 19:** Based on `...011100011011111110...`. Pattern: `11010011110000010`\n*   **Generation 20:** Based on `...011010011110000010...`. To calculate this last step:\n    *   Consider the neighborhoods across the padded string `001101001111000001000`.\n    *   `001` -> 1\n    *   `011` -> 1\n    *   `110` -> 1\n    *   `101` -> 1\n    *   `010` -> 1\n    *   `100` -> 0\n    *   `001` -> 1\n    *   `011` -> 1\n    *   `111` -> 0\n    *   `111` -> 0\n    *   `110` -> 1\n    *   `100` -> 0\n    *   `000` -> 0\n    *   `000` -> 0\n    *   `000` -> 0\n    *   `001` -> 1\n    *   `010` -> 1\n    *   `100` -> 0\n    *   The resulting pattern is `111110110010000110`.\n\n<<<111110110010000110>>>"
