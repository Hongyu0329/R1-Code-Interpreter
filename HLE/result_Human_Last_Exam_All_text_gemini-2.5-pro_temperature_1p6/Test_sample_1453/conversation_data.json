    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Coiled-Coil Structure and the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are protein structural motifs where two or more alpha-helices are coiled around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern called a heptad repeat, denoted as **(abcdefg)n**.\n\n*   **Positions 'a' and 'd'**: These are the most important positions for determining the structure. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids (like Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Alanine). These residues form the hydrophobic core that holds the helices together through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n*   **Positions 'e' and 'g'**: These are often charged or polar residues. They are located on the outer edges of the hydrophobic core and can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n*   **Positions 'b', 'c', and 'f'**: These are typically polar and solvent-exposed, having minimal influence on the oligomeric state.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe must find the correct \"frame\" or starting point for the `abcdefg` repeat. We do this by looking for a pattern where the 'a' and 'd' positions are consistently hydrophobic. Let's test the possibilities.\n\nThe most successful registration is found by starting the repeat at the 4th residue, Alanine (A). This alignment creates a highly consistent and stable hydrophobic core. Let's write out the sequence with this alignment (flanking residues `GEI` at the N-terminus and `KG` at the C-terminus are common).\n\n*   **Sequence**:           `A Q S L K E I`   `A K S L K E I`   `A W S L K E I`   `A Q S L K`\n*   **Heptad Position**:   `a b c d e f g`   `a b c d e f g`   `a b c d e f g`   `a b c d e`\n\nLet's examine the key positions based on this alignment:\n*   **'a' positions**: **A**, **A**, **A**, **A** (Alanine)\n*   **'d' positions**: **L**, **L**, **L**, **L** (Leucine)\n*   **'e' positions**: K, K, K, K (Lysine)\n*   **'g' positions**: I, I, I (Isoleucine)\n\nThis alignment is excellent. The core 'a' and 'd' positions are exclusively populated by hydrophobic residues, which is the defining feature of a coiled-coil.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Core Residues to Determine the Oligomeric State**\n\nThe identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictates the packing efficiency for different oligomeric states (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n\n*   **Dimer (2-stranded coil)**: The classic signature for a dimer is having a large hydrophobic residue like **Leucine (L)** at the 'd' position and a small hydrophobic residue like **Alanine (A)** at the 'a' position. The small size of Alanine at the 'a' position allows the two helices to pack very closely, which in turn enables the large Leucine residues at the 'd' positions to interlock perfectly. This creates a highly stable and efficient \"knobs-into-holes\" packing arrangement.\n\n*   **Trimer (3-stranded coil)**: Trimers are typically formed when the 'a' position contains a beta-branched amino acid, such as **Isoleucine (I)** or **Valine (V)**. The branching at the beta-carbon of these residues creates steric hindrance that prevents the close packing required for a dimer. Instead, a three-helix arrangement is favored.\n\n*   **Tetramer (4-stranded coil)**: Tetramers often have a pattern where 'a' positions are polar and 'd' positions are hydrophobic, or a specific `a=I, d=L` combination.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\n\nOur sequence has:\n*   **'a' positions**: Exclusively **Alanine (A)**\n*   **'d' positions**: Exclusively **Leucine (L)**\n\nThis `a=A`, `d=L` pattern is the canonical, textbook example of a sequence that forms a **dimer**. The packing of small Alanines against each other at the `a-a'` interface and bulky Leucines at the `d-d'` interface is energetically optimal for a two-stranded coiled-coil. The unusual Tryptophan (W) is at a solvent-exposed 'b' position and does not influence the core packing. The charged Lysine (K) residues at the 'e' position and hydrophobic Isoleucine (I) at the 'g' position are also consistent with a stable dimeric structure.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein would be 2.\n\n<<<A>>>"
