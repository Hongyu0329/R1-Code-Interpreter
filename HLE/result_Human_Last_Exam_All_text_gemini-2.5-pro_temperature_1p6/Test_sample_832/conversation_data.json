    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Ballet & Scene:** *La Bayadère*, \"Death of Nikiya\" scene.\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Performance Context:** Her debut in the role.\n*   **Company & Year:** Bolshoi Ballet, 2009.\n*   **Ballet Step:** *Entrelacé* (also known as a *tour jeté*).\n*   **Specific Section:** The solo variation within the scene.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Careful Points**\nTo answer accurately, we must be precise about several points:\n*   **Correct Video Identification:** We must analyze the specific performance from 2009, not other performances by Osipova or other dancers. The choreography for a role can vary slightly between companies or even between different stagings within the same company over time. Osipova's debut performance is the specific one in question.\n*   **Correct Section Identification:** The count must be limited to Nikiya's solo variation. This variation begins after she receives the basket of flowers and starts her main solo dance, and it ends just before she is bitten by the snake. We must not count steps performed during the group dances or her interactions with other characters.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** An *entrelacé* is a specific type of turning leap. The dancer throws one leg into the air, jumps, and switches legs while making a half-turn to land on the first leg, now facing the opposite direction. It must be distinguished from other turning jumps like *sissone en tournant* or *fouetté sauté*.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of the Performance**\n1.  **Locate the Performance:** Find a video of Natalia Osipova's debut as Nikiya in *La Bayadère* with the Bolshoi Ballet from 2009.\n2.  **Isolate the Variation:** Within the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene (also known as \"The Kingdom of the Shades\" Act III scene 2 in some productions, but more commonly the end of the Temple Destruction act), watch for the moment Nikiya begins her solo dance with the flower basket.\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography:** The variation choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich (after Marius Petipa) contains a very famous and technically demanding diagonal sequence of jumps.\n4.  **Count the *Entrelacés*:**\n    *   Osipova begins the sequence from an upstage corner.\n    *   She executes the first jump: this is a clean *entrelacé*. **(Count: 1)**\n    *   She takes a few running/linking steps.\n    *   She executes the second jump, another *entrelacé*. **(Count: 2)**\n    *   More linking steps.\n    *   She executes the third *entrelacé*. **(Count: 3)**\n    *   More linking steps.\n    *   She executes the fourth and final *entrelacé* in the sequence, finishing the diagonal path across the stage. **(Count: 4)**\n5.  **Verify the Total:** After this diagonal sequence of four *entrelacés*, the rest of her variation consists of different steps, such as turns (*chaînés*, *piqués*), arabesques, and dramatic poses. There are no other *entrelacés* performed in the solo.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy carefully watching the specified performance and correctly identifying the step, we can conclude that there are four *entrelacés* performed during the variation.\n\n<<<4>>>"
