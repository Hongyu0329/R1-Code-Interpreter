    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe question asks to identify a \"unique architectural feature\" that existed in the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in Rome. Key details are:\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, the square in front of the Pantheon.\n*   **Feature Type:** A unique architectural feature. This implies a significant man-made structure or installation.\n*   **Timeline:** It was present *until* 1950.\n*   **Action:** It was \"removed by the city administration.\"\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Misinterpretations\n*   **The feature is no longer there.** We must look for something absent in modern photos but present in historical ones from before 1950.\n*   **The date is specific.** We can eliminate features removed at other times. For example, the two bell towers added by Bernini to the Pantheon (nicknamed \"the donkey's ears\") were famously removed in the late 19th century, not 1950.\n*   **\"Architectural feature\" can be interpreted broadly.** It may not be a building, but rather a significant element of the urban landscape or infrastructure that defines the visual character of the square.\n*   **The Pantheon itself is not the answer.** The feature was *in the square* that hosts the Pantheon.\n*   **The Fontana del Pantheon (Fountain of the Pantheon) with its obelisk is not the answer,** as it is still prominently located in the center of the square today.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Answer\n\n1.  **Historical Research:** We need to examine historical photographs and records of the Piazza della Rotonda from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n2.  **Visual Comparison:** Comparing photos from circa 1900-1940 with photos from after 1950 reveals a striking difference in the square's ground and overhead space. The older photos clearly show metal tracks set into the cobblestones running directly through the piazza, very close to the Pantheon's entrance and the central fountain.\n3.  **Identify the Feature:** These tracks belonged to Rome's public tramway (or streetcar) system. In addition to the tracks on the ground, this system required a network of overhead electrical wires (catenary) and poles to power the trams. This entire apparatus—the tracks and the overhead lines—was a very prominent and visually intrusive feature of the square.\n4.  **Verify the Removal and Date:** After World War II, the Rome city administration undertook a major project to modernize its public transport and improve the aesthetic of the historic center (\"decoro urbano\"). The trams were considered noisy, slow, and visually disruptive, especially the web of overhead cables in historic squares. The policy was to replace them with buses.\n5.  **Confirm the Timeline:** The process of dismantling the tram lines in the historical heart of Rome took place in the years surrounding 1950. The lines passing through Piazza della Rotonda were part of this municipal removal project. Therefore, the tramway line fits all the criteria: it was a unique (a tram running in front of an ancient temple) and significant feature of the square's built environment, and it was removed by the city administration around the specified year.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe unique architectural/urban feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in 1950 was the public tramway line. This included both the metal tracks embedded in the square and the associated overhead electrical wires and poles.\n\n<<<The tramway line (streetcar tracks and overhead electrical wires)>>>"
