    "This is a classic mathematical problem in the field of circle packing, specifically finding the minimum radius of a circle required to contain a given number (`n`) of smaller unit circles. Here, `n=14` and the radius of the small circles is `r=1`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe goal is to find the radius `R` of the smallest possible circle that can enclose fourteen circles of radius `r=1`. \"Tightly packed\" implies that this is the minimum possible radius, also known as the optimal packing.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Nature of the Packing Configuration**\nUnlike simple cases (like `n=7`, which has a central circle surrounded by six), the optimal arrangement for `n=14` is not immediately obvious or highly symmetric. The solution has been found and mathematically proven through advanced geometry and computational analysis. One cannot simply arrange the circles in a hexagonal pattern and expect to find the optimal solution.\n\n**Step 3: Describe the Proven Optimal Configuration for n=14**\nThe optimal configuration for packing 14 circles was proven by F. Fodor in 2003. The arrangement consists of:\n*   A central cluster of four circles.\n*   An outer ring of ten circles surrounding this central cluster.\nThis arrangement does *not* have a circle at the very center of the large circle. The center of the large circle lies in the space between the four central small circles.\n\n**Step 4: Use the Known Formula for the Radius**\nThe radius `R` of the large circle is determined by the distance from its center to the center of the outermost small circles, plus the radius of a small circle (`r=1`). For this specific `n=14` configuration, the minimal radius `R` is given by a precise mathematical formula:\n\n`R = 1 + sqrt( (4 + 2 * sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Non-intuitive Arrangement:** The optimal packing is not a simple, symmetrical pattern. Attempting to solve it with basic geometric assumptions (e.g., placing one circle at the center) will lead to an incorrect, larger radius.\n2.  **Using a Proven Result:** This problem relies on a known result from mathematical literature. The derivation of the formula is highly complex and beyond the scope of a standard calculation.\n3.  **Radius Definition:** The radius `R` of the enclosing circle is the distance from its center to the center of any small circle that is tangent to it, plus the radius of that small circle (`r=1`).\n4.  **Precision:** The calculation requires using a reasonably precise value for the square root of 3 to achieve the required accuracy. The final answer must be rounded to 4 significant digits as requested.\n\n### Calculation of the Final Answer\n\nNow, let's calculate the numerical value of `R` using the formula.\n\n**Step 1: State the formula**\n`R = 1 + sqrt( (4 + 2 * sqrt(3)) / 3 )`\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the value inside the parentheses**\n*   Use `sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205`\n*   `2 * sqrt(3) ≈ 2 * 1.73205 = 3.4641`\n*   `4 + 2 * sqrt(3) ≈ 4 + 3.4641 = 7.4641`\n\n**Step 3: Perform the division**\n*   `(4 + 2 * sqrt(3)) / 3 ≈ 7.4641 / 3 ≈ 2.488033`\n\n**Step 4: Take the square root**\n*   `sqrt(2.488033) ≈ 1.57735`\n\n**Step 5: Add 1 to find the final radius**\n*   `R ≈ 1 + 1.57735 = 2.57735`\n\n**Step 6: Round to 4 significant digits**\nThe number is `2.57735...`. The first four significant digits are `2`, `5`, `7`, and `7`. The fifth digit is `3`, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we don't change the last digit).\n*   `R ≈ 2.577`\n\nThe radius of the circle is 2.577.\n\n<<<2.577>>>"
