    "This problem asks us to transform a given discrete-time system into its observer canonical form using the principle of duality. The goal is to find the new output matrix, which we will call `C_o`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Duality and Observer Canonical Form**\n\nThe principle of duality states that a system `(A, C)` is observable if and only if its dual system, `(A^T, C^T)`, is controllable.\n\nWe can use this principle to find the observer canonical form. The strategy is:\n1.  Form the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n2.  Find the transformation matrix `P_c` that converts this dual system into controllable canonical form.\n3.  Use the inverse transpose of `P_c` as the transformation matrix `P_o` for the original system to convert it to observer canonical form.\n4.  Calculate the new system matrices, specifically the new output matrix `C_o`.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Handling a Multi-Output System**\nThe given system has a `C` matrix with two rows, meaning it has two outputs. The standard observer canonical form is typically defined for single-output systems. For such problems, we must first choose a single output row from `C` that makes the pair `(A, c_i)` observable. Let's check this.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nA = [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0]\nC = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]\n\nLet's denote the rows of `C` as `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]` and `c_2 = [1, 1, 0]`. We will choose one of these to construct the transformation. Let's use `c_1`. We must first verify that `(A, c_1)` is observable.\n\nThe observability matrix is `O = [c_1; c_1*A; c_1*A^2]`.\n- `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n- `c_1*A = [0, 1, 0] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [2, 1, 1]`\n- `c_1*A^2 = (c_1*A)*A = [2, 1, 1] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [4, 5, 1]`\n\n`O = [0, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 4, 5, 1]`.\n`det(O) = -1 * (2*1 - 4*1) = 2`. Since the determinant is non-zero, the pair `(A, c_1)` is observable, and we can proceed.\n\n**Step 2: Define the Dual System and find its Controllable Canonical Form Transformation**\n\nThe dual system we will work with is `(A^T, c_1^T)`.\n`A^T = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]`\n`c_1^T = [0; 1; 0]` (This will be the `B` matrix of the dual system).\n\nTo find the transformation `P_c`, we first need the characteristic polynomial of `A`, `det(sI - A) = 0`.\n`det([s-1, -1, 0; -2, s-1, -1; 0, -2, s]) = (s-1)(s(s-1) - 2) + 1(-2s) = s^3 - 2s^2 - 3s + 2`\nThe coefficients are `a_1 = -2`, `a_2 = -3`, `a_3 = 2`.\n\nThe transformation matrix `P_c` is given by `P_c = (W_c * M)^-1`, where `W_c` is the controllability matrix of the dual system and `M` is a matrix constructed from the polynomial coefficients.\n\n- **Controllability Matrix `W_c`**: `W_c = [c_1^T, A^T*c_1^T, (A^T)^2*c_1^T]`\n  - `c_1^T = [0; 1; 0]`\n  - `A^T*c_1^T = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`\n  - `(A^T)^2*c_1^T = A^T * [2; 1; 1] = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [2; 1; 1] = [4; 5; 1]`\n  `W_c = [0, 2, 4; 1, 1, 5; 0, 1, 1]`\n\n- **Coefficient Matrix `M`**: For characteristic polynomial `s^n + a_1*s^(n-1) + ... + a_n`:\n  `M = [a_(n-1), ..., a_1, 1; ...; a_1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0]`. Here n=3.\n  `M = [a_2, a_1, 1; a_1, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0] = [-3, -2, 1; -2, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0]`\n\n- **Calculate `P_c`**:\n  `W_c * M = [0, 2, 4; 1, 1, 5; 0, 1, 1] * [-3, -2, 1; -2, 1, 0; 1, 0, 0]`\n  `W_c * M = [0-4+4, 0+2+0, 0; -3-2+5, -2+1+0, 1; 0-2+1, 0+1+0, 0] = [0, 2, 0; 0, -1, 1; -1, 1, 0]`\n  Now, we find the inverse `P_c = (W_c * M)^-1`.\n  The determinant is `det(W_c * M) = -2 * (0 - (-1)) = -2`.\n  The inverse is `(1/-2) * adj = (1/-2) * [-1, -2, 2; -1, 0, 0; -1, -2, 0]^T = (1/-2) * [-1, -1, -1; -2, 0, -2; 2, 0, 0]`\n  `P_c = [1/2, 1/2, 1/2; 1, 0, 1; -1, 0, 0]`\n  **Correction in Calculation**: Re-calculating the inverse more carefully.\n  Let `X = [0, 2, 0; 0, -1, 1; -1, 1, 0]`.\n  `adj(X) = [ -1, 0, 2; -1, 0, 0; -1, -2, 0 ]`.\n  `P_c = X^-1 = (1/-2) * adj(X) = [1/2, 0, -1; 1/2, 0, 0; 1/2, 1, 0]`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Duality Transformation**\nThe transformation `x_o = P_o * x` that brings `(A,C)` to observer canonical form uses `P_o` related to `P_c`. The relationship is `P_o = (P_c^{-1})^T`. We are interested in the new C matrix, `C_o = C * P_o^{-1}`.\nFrom `P_o = (P_c^{-1})^T`, we can find `P_o^{-1}`.\n`P_o^{-1} = ( (P_c^{-1})^T )^{-1} = (P_c^{-1})^{-1})^T = P_c^T`.\nSo, `C_o = C * P_c^T`.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the new C matrix, `C_o`**\n\nWe have `P_c = [1/2, 0, -1; 1/2, 0, 0; 1/2, 1, 0]`.\nThen `P_c^T = [1/2, 1/2, 1/2; 0, 0, 1; -1, 0, 0]`.\n\nNow we can compute `C_o = C * P_c^T`.\n`C_o = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0] * [1/2, 1/2, 1/2; 0, 0, 1; -1, 0, 0]`\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n- **First row of `C_o`**: `[0*(1/2) + 1*0 + 0*(-1), 0*(1/2) + 1*0 + 0*0, 0*(1/2) + 1*1 + 0*0] = [0, 0, 1]`\n- **Second row of `C_o`**: `[1*(1/2) + 1*0 + 0*(-1), 1*(1/2) + 1*0 + 0*0, 1*(1/2) + 1*1 + 0*0] = [1/2, 1/2, 3/2]`\n\nSo, the new C matrix is:\n`C_o = [0, 0, 1; 1/2, 1/2, 3/2]`\n\n**Careful Point 3: Verification**\nThe first row of the new `C_o` is `[0, 0, 1]`. This is the characteristic form `[0, ..., 0, 1]` for the output vector (`c_1`) that we used to derive the transformation. This confirms our method is correct. The transformation `x_o = P_o*x` has converted the first output `y_1 = c_1*x` into `y_1 = [0, 0, 1]*x_o`, which is `x_o,3`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe new matrix C, denoted as `C_o`, is calculated by transforming the original C matrix using the transformation derived from the duality principle. The resulting matrix is:\nC_o = [0, 0, 1; 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]\n\n<<<[0, 0, 1; 0.5, 0.5, 1.5]>>>"
