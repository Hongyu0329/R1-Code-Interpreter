    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group in question.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Manifold and the Goal\n\nWe are considering a 4-manifold, let's call it $M$, which is the double branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ over a specific knotted 2-sphere. The knotted 2-sphere is the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, which we denote as $K = \\tau_5(T)$. Our goal is to find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$. This number is also known as the rank of the group, denoted by $d(\\pi_1(M))$.\n\n### Step 2: Formula for the Fundamental Group of the Branched Cover\n\nA standard result in topology relates the fundamental group of a double branched cover to the fundamental group of the complement of the branching set. Let $K \\subset S^4$ be a knotted 2-sphere. The double branched cover $M = \\Sigma_2(S^4, K)$ has a fundamental group given by:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\frac{\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)}{N(\\{\\mu^2\\})} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is a meridian of $K$ (a loop that links $K$ once), and $N(\\{\\mu^2\\})$ denotes the normal subgroup generated by the squares of all meridional elements. In a presentation of $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$ where generators are meridians, this amounts to adding the relation that the square of each generator is 1.\n\n### Step 3: Fundamental Group of the Twist-Spun Knot Complement\n\nThe next step is to find a presentation for $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus K)$, where $K = \\tau_5(T)$. The trefoil knot $T$ is a fibered knot. For a fibered knot $J \\subset S^3$ with fiber surface $F$ and monodromy map $h: F \\to F$, the fundamental group of its complement is given by a semidirect product:\n$$ \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus J) \\cong \\pi_1(F) \\rtimes_h \\mathbb{Z} $$\nA theorem by Zeeman states that for an $m$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_m(J)$, the fundamental group of its complement is:\n$$ \\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_m(J)) \\cong \\pi_1(F) \\rtimes_{h^m} \\mathbb{Z} $$\nA presentation for this group is $\\langle G_F, t \\mid t g t^{-1} = h^m(g) \\text{ for all } g \\in G_F \\rangle$, where $G_F = \\pi_1(F)$.\n\n### Step 4: The Trefoil Knot Fiber and Monodromy\n\nFor the trefoil knot $T$, the fiber $F$ is a once-punctured torus. Its fundamental group is the free group on two generators, $\\pi_1(F) = F_2 = \\langle u, v \\rangle$.\nThe monodromy $h$ is an automorphism of $F_2$. Its action on the abelianization of $\\pi_1(F)$, which is $H_1(F) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^2$, is represented by a matrix $A \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the right-handed trefoil, this matrix is conjugate to $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $t^2 - t + 1 = 0$, which is the Alexander polynomial of the trefoil.\nThis matrix has order 6, i.e., $A^6 = I$. The automorphism $h$ itself also has order 6 up to inner automorphisms.\nThe specific automorphism $h: F_2 \\to F_2$ corresponding to this matrix (with a suitable choice of basis $\\{u,v\\}$) is $h(u) = v$ and $h(v) = u^{-1}v$.\n\n### Step 5: The 5th Power of the Monodromy\n\nWe need to find the action of $h^5$. Since $h$ has order 6, $h^5 = h^{-1}$.\nIf $h(u)=v$ and $h(v)=u^{-1}v$, then we find the inverse map $h^{-1}$:\nLet $u' = h(u)=v$ and $v' = h(v)=u^{-1}v$. Then $v=u'$. From this, $u^{-1}=v'v^{-1}=v'u'^{-1}$, so $u=(v'u'^{-1})^{-1}=u'v'^{-1}$.\nSo, $h^{-1}(u')=u'v'^{-1}$ and $h^{-1}(v')=u'$.\nRenaming $(u', v')$ back to $(u,v)$, we get $h^5(u) = uv^{-1}$ and $h^5(v) = u$.\n\n### Step 6: Presentation of the Knot Complement Group\n\nUsing the formula from Step 3, the group $\\pi_1(S^4 \\setminus \\tau_5(T))$ has the presentation:\n$$ G_5 = \\langle u, v, t \\mid tut^{-1} = h^5(u), \\ tvt^{-1} = h^5(v) \\rangle $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $h^5$:\n$$ G_5 = \\langle u, v, t \\mid tut^{-1} = uv^{-1}, \\ tvt^{-1} = u \\rangle $$\n\n### Step 7: Presentation of the Final Group\n\nNow we apply the formula from Step 2. For the group $G_5$, the generator $t$ corresponds to a meridian. So we need to add the relation $t^2=1$. This simplifies the existing relations, since $t^{-1}=t$.\nThe fundamental group of the double branched cover $M$ is:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) = \\langle u, v, t \\mid tut = uv^{-1}, \\ tvt = u, \\ t^2 = 1 \\rangle $$\nLet's simplify this presentation.\nFrom the relation $tvt = u$, we can express $v$ in terms of $u$ and $t$:\nMultiply by $t$ on the left: $t(tvt) = tu \\implies t^2vt = tu \\implies vt = tu$.\nMultiply by $t$ on the right: $(tvt)t = ut \\implies tvt^2 = ut \\implies tv=ut$.\nFrom $vt=tu$ and $tv=ut$, we get $v = t(tu) = tut$. So, $v=tut$.\n\nNow substitute $v=tut$ into the first relation, $tut = uv^{-1}$:\n$v = u v^{-1} \\implies v^2 = u$.\nSo we have a relation between $u$ and $v$. Let's check for consistency. We must satisfy all initial relations.\nSubstitute $u=v^2$ into $tvt=u$:\n$tvt = v^2$.\nWe know from $v=tut$ that $u=t v t$. Let's check $tvt=v^2$.\n$t(tut)t = v$. So $u=tvt$ holds if $v=tut$.\nWe have $v = tut = t(v^2)t = (tvt)(tvt)$.\nSince $tvt=v^2$, this gives $v = (v^2)(v^2) = v^4$.\nThis implies $v^3=1$.\n\nThe relations we have derived are: $v^3=1$, $u=v^2$, and $v=tut$.\nLet's see if these define the group.\nIf $v^3=1$, then $u=v^2=v^{-1}$.\nThe relation $v=tut$ becomes $v=t v^{-1} t$. Multiplying by $v$ on the left gives $v^2=vt v^{-1} t$. Not simple.\nMultiplying by $t$ on the right gives $vt = t v^{-1}$. Pre-multiplying by $t$ gives $tvt=v^{-1}$.\nSo the relation $v=tut$ is equivalent to $tvt=v^{-1}$ (given $t^2=1$).\nThis can be written as $tvtv=1 \\implies (tv)^2=1$.\n\nSo, the group $\\pi_1(M)$ can be presented with generators $v$ and $t$ and relations:\n$$ v^3=1, \\quad t^2=1, \\quad (tv)^2=1 $$\nThis is a standard presentation for the dihedral group of order 6, $D_3$, which is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_3$.\n\n### Step 8: Minimal Number of Generators\n\nThe group $D_3 \\cong S_3$ is non-abelian, so it cannot be generated by a single element. The generators used in the presentation, $v$ (an element of order 3) and $t$ (an element of order 2), form a generating set of size 2. Therefore, the minimal number of generators is 2."
