    "This question asks for the number of distinct elements in the integral homology cobordism group, $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, that can be created by performing integral surgery on knots with four or fewer crossings.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the context**\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$):** This is a group where the elements are equivalence classes of integral homology 3-spheres (3-manifolds $Y$ with $H_*(Y, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(S^3, \\mathbb{Z})$). Two such manifolds, $Y_1$ and $Y_2$, are considered equivalent if they together form the boundary of a 4-manifold (a homology cobordism) that has the same homology as a cylinder. The group operation is the connected sum (#). The identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** To obtain an integral homology sphere from surgery on a knot $K \\subset S^3$, the surgery coefficient must be $p = \\pm 1$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S^3_p(K)$. So, we need to consider $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$ for all relevant knots $K$.\n\n**Step 2: List all knots with at most four crossings**\nThe number of crossings is a fundamental knot invariant. We need to list all prime knots up to four crossings. The crossing number of a composite knot is the sum of the crossing numbers of its components, so there are no composite knots with at most four crossings (the simplest one, $3_1 \\# 3_1$, has 6 crossings).\nThe list of prime knots is:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot, $0_1$. It is amphichiral (its mirror image is equivalent to itself).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings:** There are no knots.\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot, $3_1$. This knot is chiral, meaning it is not equivalent to its mirror image. So we must consider both the right-handed trefoil (let's denote it $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror, $\\bar{3}_1$).\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot, $4_1$. This knot is amphichiral.\n\nSo, the full list of knots to analyze is: {$0_1$, $3_1$ (right-handed trefoil), $\\bar{3}_1$ (left-handed trefoil), $4_1$}.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the homology spheres from surgery on each knot**\nFor each knot $K$ in our list, we examine the homology cobordism classes of $S^3_{+1}(K)$ and $S^3_{-1}(K)$. We can use invariants like the Rohlin invariant ($\\mu$) and the Frøyshov invariant ($h$) to distinguish between classes.\n\n1.  **The Unknot ($0_1$)**\n    *   Surgery on the unknot yields lens spaces. Specifically, $S^3_{\\pm 1}(0_1)$ results in $L(1,1)$, which is topologically the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   $S^3$ is the identity element of the group $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Result:** The trivial element [S³].\n\n2.  **The Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**\n    *   The figure-eight knot is a slice knot, meaning it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball $B^4$.\n    *   A key theorem by Casson and Gordon states that if a knot $K$ is slice, then the manifolds $S^3_{\\pm 1}(K)$ are homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n    *   Therefore, both $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on the figure-eight knot result in the trivial element of $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   **Result:** The trivial element [S³].\n\n3.  **The Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**\n    *   **+1 surgery, $S^3_{+1}(3_1)$:** This manifold is the famous Poincaré homology sphere. It is a well-known non-trivial element in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$. It represents a class, let's call it $[P]$, which has infinite order.\n    *   **-1 surgery, $S^3_{-1}(3_1)$:** This results in another homology sphere, distinct from the Poincaré sphere. Its class in $\\Theta^3_\\mathbb{Z}$, let's call it $[A]$, is known to be a non-trivial element of order 2. (This means $[A] \\neq [S^3]$, but $[A] + [A] = [S^3]$).\n    *   **Result:** Two new elements, $[P]$ and $[A]$.\n\n4.  **The Left-Handed Trefoil ($\\bar{3}_1$)**\n    *   We use the general identity relating surgery on a knot and its mirror: $S^3_p(\\bar{K})$ is orientation-reversingly diffeomorphic to $S^3_{-p}(K)$, which we write as $S^3_p(\\bar{K}) \\cong -S^3_{-p}(K)$. In the homology cobordism group, this means $[S^3_p(\\bar{K})] = -[S^3_{-p}(K)]$.\n    *   **+1 surgery, $S^3_{+1}(\\bar{3}_1)$:** Using the identity, $[S^3_{+1}(\\bar{3}_1)] = -[S^3_{-1}(3_1)] = -[A]$. Since $[A]$ is an element of order 2, we have $[A] = -[A]$. So, this surgery produces the same element $[A]$ that we already found.\n    *   **-1 surgery, $S^3_{-1}(\\bar{3}_1)$:** Using the identity, $[S^3_{-1}(\\bar{3}_1)] = -[S^3_{+1}(3_1)] = -[P]$. Since $[P]$ is an element of infinite order, its inverse $-[P]$ is a distinct element from $[P]$. It is also distinct from $[S^3]$ and $[A]$.\n    *   **Result:** One new element, $-[P]$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the distinct elements**\nLet's list all the unique homology cobordism classes we have identified:\n1.  **The trivial element, $[S^3]$:** Obtained from the unknot and the figure-eight knot.\n2.  **The class of the Poincaré sphere, $[P]$:** Obtained from $+1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil.\n3.  **The order-2 element, $[A]$:** Obtained from $-1$ surgery on the right-handed trefoil and $+1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil.\n4.  **The inverse of the Poincaré sphere class, $-[P]$:** Obtained from $-1$ surgery on the left-handed trefoil.\n\nThese four elements are all distinct. Thus, there are a total of 4 distinct elements in the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings."
