    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   A **Dirichlet character** $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of integers modulo $d$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, to the multiplicative group of complex numbers, $\\mathbb{C}^\\times$.\n*   The **conductor** of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest integer $f$ dividing $d$ for which $\\chi$ can be defined as a character modulo $f$.\n*   A character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is **primitive** if its conductor is $d$.\n*   The **order** of a character $\\chi$ is the smallest positive integer $g$ such that $\\chi(n)^g = 1$ for all $n$ with $\\gcd(n,d)=1$.\n\n**2. Factor the Conductor $d$**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the given conductor $d=53599$.\n*   $d$ is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Trying the next prime, 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Trying to factor 7657, we test small primes: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Trying to factor 589: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\n*   The primes 7, 13, 19, and 31 are all distinct.\n\nSo, the prime factorization is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nSince $d$ is a product of distinct primes (i.e., it is square-free), the analysis is simplified.\n\n**3. Decompose the Character Group**\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ can be decomposed into a direct product of groups for each prime factor:\n$(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\nThe group of characters modulo $d$, denoted $\\widehat{(\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times}$, is isomorphic to this group. This means that any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters $\\chi_p$ for each prime factor $p$ of $d$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a character modulo $p$.\n\n**4. Apply the \"Primitive\" Condition**\n\nFor a character $\\chi = \\prod_{p|d} \\chi_p$ with square-free $d$, the conductor of $\\chi$ is $f(\\chi) = \\prod_{p|d} f(\\chi_p)$. The conductor $f(\\chi_p)$ of a character modulo a prime $p$ is $p$ if $\\chi_p$ is non-trivial, and 1 if $\\chi_p$ is the trivial character (the character that maps everything to 1).\n\nFor $\\chi$ to be primitive, its conductor must be $d$. This means $f(\\chi) = d$, which implies that $f(\\chi_p) = p$ for all prime factors $p$. This is equivalent to saying that each component character $\\chi_p$ must be **non-trivial**. A character is non-trivial if and only if its order is greater than 1.\nSo, let $g_p = \\text{order}(\\chi_p)$. The primitive condition implies $g_p > 1$ for $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\n\n**5. Apply the \"Order 6\" Condition**\n\nThe order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(g_7, g_{13}, g_{19}, g_{31})$.\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ must be 6.\nSo, $\\text{lcm}(g_7, g_{13}, g_{19}, g_{31}) = 6$.\n\n**6. Combine the Conditions and Count**\n\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ satisfying:\n1.  $g_p = \\text{order}(\\chi_p) > 1$ for all $p$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(g_7, g_{13}, g_{19}, g_{31}) = 6$.\n\nFrom the second condition, each $g_p$ must be a divisor of 6. So $g_p \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$.\nCombined with the first condition ($g_p > 1$), this restricts the possible orders for each component character to $g_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nNow, we count the number of characters for each possible order for each prime factor. The group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p)=p-1$. The number of elements of order $k$ in a cyclic group of order $n$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, if $k|n$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nLet's check the orders of the component character groups:\n*   For $p=7$: group order is $7-1=6$.\n*   For $p=13$: group order is $13-1=12$.\n*   For $p=19$: group order is $19-1=18$.\n*   For $p=31$: group order is $31-1=30$.\n\nFor all these primes, the group order $p-1$ is a multiple of 6. Therefore, for any $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, there exist characters of order $k$.\nThe number of available characters for each $p$ is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n\nFor each component $\\chi_p$, we can choose a character with an order from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2=5$.\nIf we pick one such character for each of the four primes, we get a tuple $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$. The total number of such tuples is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow we must enforce the condition that $\\text{lcm}(g_7, g_{13}, g_{19}, g_{31}) = 6$.\nThe lcm of a set of numbers from $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is 6 if and only if:\n*   At least one number is divisible by 2 (i.e., is 2 or 6).\n*   At least one number is divisible by 3 (i.e., is 3 or 6).\n\nThis means we must exclude the cases where this condition fails. The condition fails if:\n*   Case A: All orders are divisors of 2. Since the orders must be in $\\{2,3,6\\}$, this means all orders must be 2. The lcm would be 2.\n*   Case B: All orders are divisors of 3. Since the orders must be in $\\{2,3,6\\}$, this means all orders must be 3. The lcm would be 3.\n\nLet's count the number of tuples in these excluded cases:\n*   Number of tuples where all $g_p=2$: For each $p$, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So there is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$ such tuple.\n*   Number of tuples where all $g_p=3$: For each $p$, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So there are $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$ such tuples.\n\nThese two cases are disjoint. So, the number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of tuples minus those in the excluded cases.\nNumber = (Total tuples) - (Tuples with lcm 2) - (Tuples with lcm 3)\nNumber = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\bf{608}$."
