    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nThe problem presents a system of linear ordinary differential equations known as the Kolmogorov-Chapman equations. These equations model the probabilities $P_i(t)$ of a system being in one of four states {0, 1, 2, 3} at time $t$. The system is described by:\n$$ P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t) $$\n$$ P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n$$ P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t) $$\n$$ P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\nwith the normalization condition $P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1$.\nThe question asks for the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, which represents the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Consistency (A Careful Point)**\nFor the total probability to be conserved, the sum of the derivatives of the probabilities must be zero, i.e., $(\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i(t))' = 0$. Let's sum the right-hand sides of the given differential equations:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_i'(t) = [-\\lambda_{01}P_0 + \\lambda_{10}P_1] + [-\\lambda_{01}P_0 - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_1 + \\lambda_{21}P_2 + \\lambda_{31}P_3] + [\\lambda_{12}P_1 - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})P_2] + [\\lambda_{23}P_2 - \\lambda_{31}P_3] $$\nCombining terms with the same $P_i(t)$:\n$$ \\sum P_i'(t) = P_0(-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01}) + P_1(\\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{10} - \\lambda_{12} + \\lambda_{12}) + P_2(\\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{21} - \\lambda_{23} + \\lambda_{23}) + P_3(\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31}) $$\n$$ \\sum P_i'(t) = -2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t) $$\nSince $\\sum P_i'(t) = 0$ and $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, this implies that $P_0(t) = 0$ for all $t$. This would lead to a cascade of consequences ($P_1(t)=0$, etc.) that ultimately contradicts the normalization condition. This indicates a typographical error in the problem statement.\nThe most likely error is the sign of the $\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ term in the second equation. In a standard Markov process, it should represent a flow *into* state 1 from state 0, so it should be positive. We will proceed assuming the corrected equation is:\n$$ P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\nWith this correction, the sum of the derivatives is zero, and the system is consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Steady-State Equations**\nIn the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities become constant: $P_i(t) \\to p_i$, and their derivatives $P_i'(t) \\to 0$. The system becomes a set of linear algebraic equations:\n1. $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2. $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n3. $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n4. $1 = p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3}$\n(Note: We only need three of the first four original balance equations as they are linearly dependent. We use the normalization equation as the fourth independent equation).\n\n**Step 4: Solve the System of Equations**\nWe express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$:\nFrom equation (1):\n$p_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} p_1$\nFrom equation (2):\n$p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_1$\nFrom equation (3):\n$p_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\right) p_1$\n\n**Step 5: Substitute the Given Numerical Values**\nThe rates are:\n$\\lambda_{01} = 0.019, \\lambda_{10} = 0.65, \\lambda_{12} = 0.4, \\lambda_{21} = 0.392, \\lambda_{23} = 0.008, \\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\nSubstituting these values into the expressions from Step 4:\n$p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n$p_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.392 + 0.008} p_1 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} p_1 = p_1$\n$p_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} p_2 = p_2 = p_1$\n\n**Step 6: Use the Normalization Condition to find $p_1$**\nSubstitute these relationships into the normalization equation (4):\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3 \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 3 \\times 0.019}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.057}{0.019} \\right) = 1$\n$p_1 \\left( \\frac{0.707}{0.019} \\right) = 1 \\implies p_1 = \\frac{0.019}{0.707}$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right) p_1 + p_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 1 \\right) p_1$\nSubstitute the expression for $p_1$ from Step 6:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.65 + 0.019}{0.019} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.019}{0.707} \\right)$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{0.669}{0.019} \\times \\frac{0.019}{0.707} = \\frac{0.669}{0.707}$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$p_0 + p_1 \\approx 0.946251768...$\nRounding to four decimal places, we get 0.9463.\n\n<<<0.9463>>>"
