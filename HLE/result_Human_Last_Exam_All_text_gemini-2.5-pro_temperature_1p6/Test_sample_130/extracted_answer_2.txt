The edges of the image will be smoothed, with their movement being governed by their local curvature. Convex shapes will shrink and concave indentations will be filled in. As time goes to infinity, any closed boundary will contract until it vanishes, leading to the eventual disappearance of all edges as the image becomes monochromatic.
