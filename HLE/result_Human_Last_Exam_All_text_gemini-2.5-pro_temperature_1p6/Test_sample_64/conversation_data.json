    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the word and its pronunciation.**\nThe word is 「弟」. Its standard Japanese reading is おとうと (otouto).\n\n**Step 2: Break the word into morae.**\nA mora is a unit of sound that determines timing and rhythm in Japanese.\nThe word おとうと consists of four morae:\n1.  お (o)\n2.  と (to)\n3.  う (u) - This 'u' lengthens the 'o' sound of the preceding 'to', forming a long vowel sound 'tō'.\n4.  と (to)\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the standard pitch accent pattern.**\nIn standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect), we need to determine where the pitch falls, if at all. Let's examine the pitch level of each mora.\n*   The first mora, お (o), is pronounced with a **low** pitch.\n*   The second mora, と (to), is pronounced with a **high** pitch.\n*   The third mora, う (u), continues the **high** pitch.\n*   The fourth mora, と (to), also continues the **high** pitch.\n\nSo, the pitch pattern for the word itself is **Low-High-High-High**.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the pitch with a particle.**\nTo distinguish between the Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns, which both end on a high pitch, we must add a particle (like が, は, or を) and observe its pitch.\n*   When we say 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the particle 「が」 (ga) continues the **high** pitch.\n*   The full pattern is: お(Low) - と(High) - う(High) - と(High) - が(High).\n\n**Step 5: Match the observed pattern with the definitions.**\nNow, let's compare our findings with the definitions of the standard pitch accent patterns:\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and remains high through the end of the word and onto the following particle. (L-H-H-H...) This perfectly matches the pattern of 「弟」.\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式):** The pitch starts high on the first mora and then drops for all subsequent morae. (H-L-L...) This is incorrect.\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式):** The pitch starts low, rises, and then falls somewhere *in the middle* of the word. This is incorrect, as there is no pitch drop within 「弟」.\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式):** The pitch starts low, rises, and stays high until the last mora, but it drops on the following particle. This is incorrect, as the particle 「が」 remains high.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto) is Low-High-High-High, and a following particle also remains high. This is the definition of the **Heiban** pattern.\n\n<<<A>>>"
