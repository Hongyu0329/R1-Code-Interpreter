    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:** The question asks for the specific person whose **lectures** were **cited** by Albert Einstein in his **1905 paper on Brownian motion**.\n\n2.  **Identify the specific paper:** The paper in question is one of Einstein's four *Annus Mirabilis* (miraculous year) papers from 1905. Its title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n3.  **Analyze the term \"cited\":** In modern academic papers, \"to cite\" means to include a formal reference in the text, footnotes, or bibliography that points to another work. However, in the context of early 20th-century physics papers, particularly those by Einstein, the practice of formal citation was less rigorous. The question could refer to a formal citation or a more general intellectual acknowledgement within the paper's text.\n\n4.  **Examine the 1905 paper for citations:** A careful review of Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion reveals a well-known historical fact: **the paper contains no formal bibliographic citations or footnotes.** Einstein built his argument from first principles, and like his other papers from that year, it is famous for its lack of references to the work of others.\n\n5.  **Re-evaluate the question based on the lack of formal citations:** Since there are no formal citations, the question must be interpreted in a broader, intellectual sense. It is likely asking about the foundational work, described as \"lectures,\" upon which Einstein based his theoretical arguments.\n\n6.  **Identify the theoretical foundation of the paper:** Einstein's paper is a direct application of the molecular-kinetic theory of heat and statistical mechanics. He aimed to show that if this theory were correct, the agitated motion of atoms and molecules would produce a visible, random motion in larger suspended particles (i.e., Brownian motion).\n\n7.  **Identify the key figure behind the relevant theory and their \"lectures\":** The preeminent figure in the development of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases was the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. His definitive work on the subject is a famous two-volume book titled **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"**, which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"** (published 1896-1898).\n\n8.  **Connect Einstein to Boltzmann's Lectures:** Einstein himself, in his later *Autobiographical Notes*, explicitly stated that he had studied Boltzmann's work with \"fervour\" and credited Boltzmann's \"masterly treatise\" for his understanding of the subject. This \"treatise\" was the *Lectures on Gas Theory*. Although not formally cited in the 1905 paper, Boltzmann's work, which was published as his lectures, provided the entire theoretical framework for Einstein's analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile Einstein did not include a formal bibliographic citation in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, the entire work is intellectually dependent on the statistical mechanics developed by Ludwig Boltzmann. The primary source for this work was Boltzmann's famous book, \"Lectures on Gas Theory.\" Therefore, the most accurate answer, interpreting \"cite\" in an intellectual sense, is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n***\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
