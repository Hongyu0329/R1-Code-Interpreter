    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements in the smallest algebraic structure that allows for coloring the figure-eight knot.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Knot Coloring\n\nThe problem refers to a mathematical concept called **Fox n-coloring**. This is a method of assigning \"colors\" to the arcs of a knot diagram. The colors are typically integers from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}. For a coloring to be valid, it must satisfy a specific rule at every crossing and must be non-trivial.\n\n*   **The Coloring Rule:** At each crossing, if the over-arc has color `y`, and the two under-arcs have colors `x` and `z`, the following congruence must hold: `2y ≡ x + z (mod n)`.\n*   **Non-triviality:** The coloring must use at least two different colors. A coloring where all arcs have the same color is called a trivial coloring.\n*   **The Algebraic Structure:** The set of colors {0, 1, ..., n-1} along with addition and multiplication modulo `n` forms the ring `Z_n`. This is the algebraic structure we are concerned with. The question asks for the smallest size of this structure, which means finding the smallest integer `n` that allows for a non-trivial coloring.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Coloring Equations for the Figure-Eight Knot\n\nFirst, we need a diagram of the figure-eight knot (also known as knot 4_1 because it has 4 crossings). We will label the four distinct arcs.\n\nLet's use a standard, clear diagram and label the arcs `x₁`, `x₂`, `x₃`, and `x₄`. We then write an equation for each of the four crossings based on the coloring rule `2*(over-arc) ≡ (under-arc 1) + (under-arc 2) (mod n)`.\n\nFor the figure-eight knot, a standard set of equations is:\n1.  At crossing 1: `2x₁ ≡ x₂ + x₄`\n2.  At crossing 2: `2x₂ ≡ x₁ + x₃`\n3.  At crossing 3: `2x₃ ≡ x₂ + x₄`\n4.  At crossing 4: `2x₄ ≡ x₁ + x₃`\n\nThese can be rewritten as a system of linear homogeneous congruences:\n1.  `2x₁ - x₂ - x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n2.  `-x₁ + 2x₂ - x₃ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n3.  `-x₂ + 2x₃ - x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n4.  `-x₁ - x₃ + 2x₄ ≡ 0 (mod n)`\n\n### Step 3: The Coloring Matrix and the Knot Determinant\n\nThis system of equations can be represented by a **coloring matrix**.\n```\n      x₁   x₂   x₃   x₄\n    [ 2   -1    0   -1 ]\n    [-1    2   -1    0 ]\n    [ 0   -1    2   -1 ]\n    [-1    0   -1    2 ]\n```\nA key theorem in knot theory states that a knot K has a non-trivial `n`-coloring if and only if `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`, where `det(K)` is the **determinant of the knot**.\n\nThe determinant of the knot is the absolute value of the determinant of any `(m-1)x(m-1)` submatrix, where `m` is the number of arcs. Let's calculate the determinant of the `3x3` submatrix obtained by removing the last row and last column.\n\n`M' =`\n```\n    [ 2   -1    0 ]\n    [-1    2   -1 ]\n    [ 0   -1    2 ]\n```\n\n`det(M') = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*0) + 0`\n`det(M') = 2 * (4 - 1) - (-1) * (-2)`\n`det(M') = 2 * (3) - 2`\n`det(M') = 6 - 2 = 4`\n\n**Careful Point:** It is extremely easy to make a mistake when setting up the matrix from a diagram. A different diagram labeling leads to a different matrix. Let's use another common diagram's matrix to verify the determinant, as this is a critical value. A different valid labeling yields the matrix:\n```\n    [-1  -1   2   0 ]\n    [-1   2   0  -1 ]\n    [ 0  -1  -1   2 ]\n    [ 2   0  -1  -1 ]\n```\nLet's find the determinant of its top-left `3x3` submatrix:\n`det = -1*(2*(-1) - 0) - (-1)*(-1*(-1) - 0) + 2*(-1*(-1) - 2*0)`\n`det = -1*(-2) + 1*(1) + 2*(1)`\n`det = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`\n\nThis result of **5** is the correct, well-known determinant for the figure-eight knot. The first matrix was derived from an incorrect representation of the crossings. The determinant of a knot is an invariant, meaning it does not depend on the specific diagram used. `det(4₁) = 5`.\n\n### Step 4: Finding the Smallest Number of Colors\n\nNow we use the condition for `n`-colorability: `gcd(det(K), n) > 1`.\n*   We found that `det(K) = 5`.\n*   The condition becomes `gcd(5, n) > 1`.\n*   We are looking for the smallest integer `n > 1` that satisfies this.\n\nSince 5 is a prime number, its only divisors are 1 and 5. For the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and 5 to be greater than 1, `n` must be a multiple of 5.\n\nThe smallest integer `n > 1` that is a multiple of 5 is `n = 5`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest integer `n` for which the figure-eight knot is `n`-colorable is 5. This means the smallest algebraic structure `Z_n` (or more generally, the dihedral quandle `R_n`) that can be used to non-trivially color the figure-eight knot is for `n=5`. This structure, `Z₅`, has 5 elements."
