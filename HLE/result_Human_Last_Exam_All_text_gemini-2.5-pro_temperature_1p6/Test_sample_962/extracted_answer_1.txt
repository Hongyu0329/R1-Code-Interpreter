The design for a tightly secure two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme is based on a Schnorr-like signature protocol. Its security relies on a two-step signing process. In the first round, each of the *t* participants commits to a pair of random nonces. In the second round, each participant uses a binding hash—computed over the message and all commitments from the first round—to combine their nonces and their long-term secret share into a partial signature. This binding step is crucial; it prevents parallel session attacks by ensuring that every component of the signature is unique to the specific signing context, thereby allowing for a provably tight security reduction to the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
