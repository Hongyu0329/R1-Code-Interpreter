    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position as it started.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Starting/Ending Position:** This refers to which foot is in front and which is in back in a closed position like fifth position.\n*   **Directional/Modifying Terms:** Words like `derrière` (behind), `changé` (changed), or numerical identifiers (like `six`) are crucial as they define how the step is executed and how it finishes.\n*   **Basic Form:** We need to consider the standard, fundamental execution of each step.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n**A. Entrechat six**\n*   **Starting Position:** Let's assume the dancer starts in fifth position with the right foot in front (R front).\n*   **Execution:** `Entrechat` is a jump where the legs beat in the air. `Six` means there are six movements (three changes of the feet).\n    1.  Jump up from fifth (R front).\n    2.  Legs open slightly and beat with the left foot in front (1st change).\n    3.  Legs open and beat back with the right foot in front (2nd change).\n    4.  Legs open and beat again with the left foot in front (3rd change).\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the left foot in front (L front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting leg position (R front) is different from the ending leg position (L front).\n\n**B. Échappé battu changé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Let's assume the dancer starts in fifth position (R front).\n*   **Execution:** `Échappé` is a jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second) and back to closed. `Battu` means the legs beat as they close. `Changé` explicitly means \"changed\".\n    1.  Jump from fifth position (R front) to second position.\n    2.  Jump from second position, beat the legs, and land in fifth position with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the left foot in front (L front). The term `changé` guarantees this change.\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are different.\n\n**C. Assemblé**\n*   **Starting Position:** Let's assume the dancer starts in fifth position (R front).\n*   **Execution:** `Assemblé` means \"to assemble\". The dancer slides one foot out, pushes off the supporting leg, and \"assembles\" the legs together in the air before landing on both feet simultaneously in fifth position.\n    *   Consider a simple *assemblé to the side (côté)*: The back foot (left) slides to the side, the dancer jumps off the right foot, and both legs land together back in fifth position with the right foot still in front.\n    *   Consider an *assemblé devant*: The back foot (left) brushes to the back, the dancer jumps, and lands in the same starting fifth position (R front).\n*   **Ending Position:** In many standard forms of assemblé (like côté, devant, or derrière), the feet return to their original starting position. While there are variations that do change the feet (like *assemblé dessus* or *dessous*), the fundamental step itself does not require a change.\n*   **Conclusion:** The ending position can be the same as the starting position.\n\n**D. Glissade derrière**\n*   **Starting Position:** Let's assume the dancer starts in fifth position (R front).\n*   **Execution:** `Glissade` means \"to glide\". `Derrière` means \"behind\".\n    1.  From fifth (R front), the back foot (left) glides to the side.\n    2.  Weight is transferred to the left foot.\n    3.  The right foot (the one that started in front) closes *derrière* (behind) the left foot into fifth position.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer is now in fifth position with the left foot in front (L front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are different.\n\n**E. Gargouillade**\n*   **Starting Position:** Let's assume the dancer starts in fifth position (R front).\n*   **Execution:** This is a complex jump, often described as a *pas de chat* with a circular movement (*rond de jambe*) from each leg.\n    1.  The dancer jumps, executing a small *rond de jambe en l'air* with the leading leg (right foot).\n    2.  The second leg (left foot) is then brought up and also does a *rond de jambe*.\n    3.  The dancer typically lands first on the leading foot (right) and then closes the second foot (left) in front.\n*   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the left foot in front (L front).\n*   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending leg positions are different.\n\n**Final Summary:**\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** Changes feet.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** Changes feet (as per its name).\n*   **Assemblé:** Can be performed without changing feet.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** Changes feet (as per its name).\n*   **Gargouillade:** Changes feet.\n\nThe only step listed that can end with the same leg configuration it started with is the assemblé.\n\n<<<C>>>"
