The partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. Let $\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The product $\prod_i$ is over all single-particle quantum states.

For a system of **bosons**:
$Z_B = \prod_i \frac{1}{1 - e^{2\beta\mu}}$
This result is valid only for $\mu < 0$ to ensure convergence.

For a system of **fermions**:
$Z_F = \prod_i (1 + e^{2\beta\mu})$
