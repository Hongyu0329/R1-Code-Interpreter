    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the grand canonical partition function Z for the given system using the path integral formalism.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function (Z)**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function describes a system in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T and chemical potential μ. It is defined as the trace of the density operator for the grand canonical ensemble:\n\n$Z = Tr(e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N})})$\n\nHere:\n*   $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator.\n*   $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.\n*   The trace `Tr` is taken over all states in the Fock space (i.e., summing over all possible particle numbers and configurations).\n\nThe operator $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$ is often called the grand canonical Hamiltonian.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute the Specific Hamiltonian**\n\nThe problem provides a specific, non-standard Hamiltonian:\n\n$\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$\n\nWe substitute this into the expression for the grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$:\n\n$\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu\\hat{N} = (-\\mu\\hat{N}) - \\mu\\hat{N} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$\n\nTherefore, the partition function we need to calculate is:\n\n$Z = Tr(e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu\\hat{N})}) = Tr(e^{2\\beta\\mu\\hat{N}})$\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Partition Function as a Path Integral**\n\nThe partition function $Z = Tr(e^{-\\beta \\hat{K}})$ can be expressed as a functional path integral over fields $\\phi(x, \\tau)$ (which represent the particles, e.g., bosons or fermions) in Euclidean spacetime, where $\\tau = it$ is the imaginary time.\n\n$Z = \\int D[\\phi^*, \\phi] e^{-S_E[\\phi^*, \\phi]}$\n\nThe integral is over all field configurations that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time with period $\\hbar\\beta$. $S_E$ is the Euclidean action.\n\n**Step 4: Derive the Euclidean Action ($S_E$)**\n\nThe Euclidean action corresponding to a grand canonical Hamiltonian $\\hat{K}$ is generally given by:\n\n$S_E = \\int_0^{\\hbar\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left( \\phi^* \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\phi + \\mathcal{K}(\\phi^*, \\phi) \\right)$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{K}$ is the Hamiltonian density corresponding to the operator $\\hat{K}$.\nIn our case, $\\hat{K} = -2\\mu\\hat{N}$. In terms of the field operators $\\hat{\\phi}$, the number operator is $\\hat{N} = \\int d^d x \\, \\hat{\\phi}^\\dagger(x) \\hat{\\phi}(x)$.\nThus, the grand canonical Hamiltonian density is:\n\n$\\mathcal{K} = -2\\mu \\phi^*(x, \\tau) \\phi(x, \\tau)$\n\nSubstituting this into the action gives:\n\n$S_E = \\int_0^{\\hbar\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left( \\phi^* \\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\phi - 2\\mu \\phi^* \\phi \\right)$\n$S_E = \\int_0^{\\hbar\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d x \\left[ \\phi^*(x, \\tau) \\left(\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} - 2\\mu \\right) \\phi(x, \\tau) \\right]$\n\n**Step 5: Relate the Specific Problem to the General Path Integral Result**\n\nEvaluating this Gaussian path integral from first principles involves Fourier transforming to Matsubara frequency space and summing over frequencies. However, we can use the well-known general result for the partition function of a non-interacting gas, which is itself derived from this path integral formulation.\n\nThe standard result for a gas with single-particle energy levels $\\epsilon_i$ is:\n*   For **bosons**: $Z = \\prod_i \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)}}$\n*   For **fermions**: $Z = \\prod_i (1 + e^{-\\beta(\\epsilon_i - \\mu)})$\n\nThe term in the exponent, $\\epsilon_i - \\mu$, represents the energy of a particle in state $i$ within the grand canonical ensemble. We can find the equivalent term for our system. Our grand canonical Hamiltonian is:\n\n$\\hat{K} = -2\\mu \\hat{N} = -2\\mu \\sum_i \\hat{n}_i = \\sum_i (-2\\mu)\\hat{n}_i$\n\nwhere $\\hat{n}_i$ is the number operator for the single-particle state $i$. Comparing this to the standard form $\\hat{K} = \\sum_i (\\epsilon_i - \\mu)\\hat{n}_i$, we can directly identify the effective energy term for each state $i$:\n\n$(\\epsilon_i - \\mu) \\rightarrow -2\\mu$\n\nThis means our system behaves like a non-interacting gas where the grand canonical energy of every single-particle state is $-2\\mu$.\n\n**Step 6: Acquire the Final Answer**\n\nWe now substitute this effective energy term, $-2\\mu$, into the general formulas for the partition function.\n\n*   **For a system of bosons:**\n    $Z_B = \\prod_i \\frac{1}{1 - e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}} = \\prod_i \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\n    The product $\\prod_i$ is over all single-particle states $i$.\n\n*   **For a system of fermions:**\n    $Z_F = \\prod_i (1 + e^{-\\beta(-2\\mu)}) = \\prod_i (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n    The product $\\prod_i$ is over all single-particle states $i$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Operator Identification:** The crucial first step is to correctly form the grand canonical operator, $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H} - \\mu \\hat{N}$, which results in $\\hat{K}=-2\\mu\\hat{N}$ for the given Hamiltonian.\n2.  **Particle Statistics:** The problem does not specify whether the particles are bosons or fermions. The result is different for each case due to their distinct statistical properties (allowed state occupations), which is reflected in the path integral by the different boundary conditions on the fields. Therefore, both cases must be presented.\n3.  **Physical Stability (Bosons):** For the bosonic case, the partition function is a product of geometric series of the form $\\sum_n (e^{2\\beta\\mu})^n$. This series only converges if $|e^{2\\beta\\mu}| < 1$, which requires $2\\beta\\mu < 0$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this implies the chemical potential **must be negative ($\\mu < 0$)** for the system to be physically stable and for the partition function to be well-defined. If $\\mu \\geq 0$, the partition function diverges, reflecting an instability where the system's energy can be lowered by adding an infinite number of particles.\n4.  **Product Index:** The product symbol $\\prod_i$ signifies a product over all possible single-particle quantum states available to the particles (e.g., all allowed momentum modes, spin states, etc.).\n\nBy mapping our specific, unusual Hamiltonian onto the general framework, we can confidently determine the partition function without re-deriving the entire path integral machinery.\n\n<<<\nThe partition function Z depends on the statistics of the particles. Let $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The product $\\prod_i$ is over all single-particle quantum states.\n\nFor a system of **bosons**:\n$Z_B = \\prod_i \\frac{1}{1 - e^{2\\beta\\mu}}$\nThis result is valid only for $\\mu < 0$ to ensure convergence.\n\nFor a system of **fermions**:\n$Z_F = \\prod_i (1 + e^{2\\beta\\mu})$\n>>>"
