    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the probability.\n\n### **Step 1: Define the System and the Wavefunction**\n\nThe problem considers a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) box of length `a`. The particle is in the `n=2` energy state.\n\n*   The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:\n    $ψ_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\frac{nπx}{a})$ for $0 ≤ x ≤ a$.\n*   For the `n=2` state, the specific wavefunction is:\n    $ψ_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\frac{2πx}{a})$\n\n### **Step 2: Formulate the Probability Calculation**\n\nThe probability `P` of finding the particle in a given interval from `x1` to `x2` is calculated by integrating the probability density, $|ψ(x)|^2$, over that interval.\n\n*   **Probability Density:**\n    $|ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin(\\frac{2πx}{a}) \\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2πx}{a})$\n*   **Interval:**\n    $x_1 = 0.495a$ and $x_2 = 0.505a$.\n*   **Probability Integral:**\n    $P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2πx}{a}) \\,dx$\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Interval and Choose an Appropriate Method**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: The location of the interval.** The interval is from `0.495a` to `0.505a`. This is a very narrow interval of width `Δx = 0.01a`, centered precisely at `x = 0.5a`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: The value of the wavefunction at the center.** Let's evaluate the probability density at the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`:\n    $|ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2π(0.5a)}{a}) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(π) = \\frac{2}{a} (0)^2 = 0$\n    The center of the interval `x = 0.5a` is a **node** for the `n=2` state.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: The inadequacy of a simple approximation.** Because the probability density is zero at the center of the interval, the simple approximation `P ≈ |ψ_2(0.5a)|^2 * Δx` would give a result of 0. This is incorrect, as the probability over a finite (though small) interval must be a small positive number. We must perform the integration or use a more sophisticated approximation.\n\n### **Step 4: Use a Taylor Series Approximation for the Integration**\n\nSince the interval `Δx` is very small and centered around the node `x=a/2`, we can approximate the `sin` function using a Taylor series expansion.\n\n1.  Let's define a new variable `y = x - a/2`. This shifts the center of our interval to `y=0`.\n    *   The integration interval for `x` from `0.495a` to `0.505a` becomes an interval for `y` from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n2.  Rewrite the `sin` term in the wavefunction using `y`:\n    $\\sin(\\frac{2πx}{a}) = \\sin(\\frac{2π(y + a/2)}{a}) = \\sin(\\frac{2πy}{a} + π)$\n3.  Using the trigonometric identity $\\sin(θ+π) = - \\sin(θ)$:\n    $\\sin(\\frac{2πy}{a} + π) = -\\sin(\\frac{2πy}{a})$\n4.  For small values of `y`, the argument `z = 2πy/a` is small. We can use the small-angle approximation $\\sin(z) ≈ z$.\n    $-\\sin(\\frac{2πy}{a}) ≈ -\\frac{2πy}{a}$\n5.  Now, substitute this approximation back into the expression for the probability density:\n    $|ψ_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\frac{2πx}{a}) ≈ \\frac{2}{a} \\left(-\\frac{2πy}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4π^2y^2}{a^2}\\right) = \\frac{8π^2}{a^3} y^2$\n\n### **Step 5: Calculate the Probability by Integrating the Approximated Function**\n\nNow we integrate this simplified probability density over the new interval for `y`.\n\n$P ≈ \\int_{-0.005a}^{+0.005a} \\frac{8π^2}{a^3} y^2 \\,dy$\n\n1.  Perform the integration:\n    $P ≈ \\frac{8π^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{+0.005a}$\n2.  Evaluate at the limits of integration:\n    $P ≈ \\frac{8π^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $P ≈ \\frac{8π^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 + (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n    $P ≈ \\frac{8π^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n3.  Simplify the expression. Note that the `a³` terms cancel out.\n    $P ≈ \\frac{16π^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n    $P ≈ \\frac{16π^2}{3} (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3$\n    $P ≈ \\frac{16π^2}{3} (125 \\times 10^{-9})$\n    $P ≈ \\frac{2000π^2}{3} \\times 10^{-9}$\n4.  Substitute the value of $π^2 ≈ 9.8696$:\n    $P ≈ \\frac{2000 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 10^{-9}$\n    $P ≈ \\frac{19739.2}{3} \\times 10^{-9}$\n    $P ≈ 6579.7 \\times 10^{-9}$\n    $P ≈ 6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nThe probability that the particle is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for n=2 is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
