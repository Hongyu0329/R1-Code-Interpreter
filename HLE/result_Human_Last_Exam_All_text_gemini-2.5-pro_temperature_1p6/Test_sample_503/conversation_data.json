    "An adjunction in a 2-category is a pair of 1-morphisms $f: A \\to B$ and $g: B \\to A$ together with 2-morphisms (unit and counit) that satisfy certain axioms. In the context of a locally posetal 2-category, where the hom-sets are posets, these conditions simplify.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the setup**\n\n*   The simplex category $\\Delta$ has objects $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$.\n*   The morphisms in $\\Delta$ are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$, i.e., if $i \\le j$ in $[m]$, then $f(i) \\le f(j)$ in $[n]$.\n*   $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. This means that for any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, the set of morphisms $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ is a poset. The order relation (which serves as the 2-morphisms) is given by pointwise comparison: for $f, h: [m] \\to [n]$, we say $f \\le h$ if and only if $f(i) \\le h(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\n**Step 2: Define an internal adjunction in this context**\n\nWe are looking for an internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$, where $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nThis consists of a pair of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ (the left adjoint) and $g: [n] \\to [m]$ (the right adjoint) satisfying the adjunction conditions. In a locally posetal 2-category, these conditions are:\n1.  The unit: $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$. This means for every $i \\in [m]$, $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]}(i) \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$, which is $i \\le g(f(i))$.\n2.  The counit: $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This means for every $j \\in [n]$, $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}(j)$, which is $f(g(j)) \\le j$.\n\nThese two conditions define what is also known as a Galois connection between the posets $([m], \\le)$ and $([n], \\le)$. An adjunction is uniquely determined by either the left adjoint $f$ or the right adjoint $g$. Thus, the number of adjunctions is the number of possible left adjoints $f: [m] \\to [n]$ or, equivalently, the number of possible right adjoints $g: [n] \\to [m]$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps**\n\nLet's find the condition for an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ to be a left adjoint (i.e., to have a right adjoint).\nA map $f$ has a right adjoint $g$ if and only if for every $j \\in [n]$, the set $S_j = \\{i \\in [m] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$ has a maximum element. Since $[m]$ is finite, any non-empty subset of $[m]$ has a maximum. So, the condition simplifies to $S_j$ being non-empty for all $j \\in [n]$.\nFor $S_j$ to be non-empty, there must exist some $i \\in [m]$ such that $f(i) \\le j$. This must hold for all $j \\in [n]$.\nLet's check the condition for $j=0$. There must be an $i \\in [m]$ such that $f(i) \\le 0$. Since the codomain of $f$ is $[n]=\\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$, this means $f(i)=0$. As $f$ is order-preserving, $f(0) \\le f(i) = 0$, so we must have $f(0)=0$.\nThis condition is also sufficient. If $f(0)=0$, then for any $j \\in [n]$, we have $j \\ge 0$. So $f(0)=0 \\le j$, which means $0 \\in S_j$. Therefore, $S_j$ is never empty.\nSo, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0)=0$.\n\nAlternatively, an order-preserving map $g: [n] \\to [m]$ is a right adjoint (has a left adjoint) if and only if for every $i \\in [m]$, the set $T_i = \\{j \\in [n] \\mid g(j) \\ge i\\}$ has a minimum element. This is equivalent to $T_i$ being non-empty for all $i \\in [m]$. For $i=m$, there must be a $j \\in [n]$ with $g(j) \\ge m$. As the codomain of $g$ is $[m]$, this implies $g(j)=m$. Since $g$ is order-preserving, $g(j) \\le g(n)$, so we must have $g(n)=m$. This condition is also sufficient.\n\nSo, the number of adjunctions from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is the number of order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Count the maps**\n\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $f: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $f(0)=0$.\nAn order-preserving map $f$ is defined by the sequence of its values $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$. The conditions are:\n1.  $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$.\n2.  The values $f(i)$ must be in $[37] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n3.  $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem, often solved with \"stars and bars\". We are choosing 23 values (the $f(i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 23$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, with replacement, and the order of choice does not matter as they will be sorted into a non-decreasing sequence.\nThe number of values to choose is $k = 23$.\nThe number of available options is $M+1 = 37+1 = 38$.\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of size $N$ with replacement (multiset coefficient) is given by the formula:\n$\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\nIn our case, $N = 38$ and $k=23$.\nThe number of such maps is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nWe can verify this using the alternative characterization. We count order-preserving maps $g: [37] \\to [23]$ with $g(37)=23$. This requires counting non-decreasing sequences $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ where $0 \\le g(0) \\le \\dots \\le g(36) \\le 23$.\nHere, we choose $k=37$ values from $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has $N=24$ options.\nThe number is $\\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$. The results match.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{23+37}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$."
