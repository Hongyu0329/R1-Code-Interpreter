    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *sissone fermées* performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Performance:** Swan Lake\n    *   **Year/Theatre:** 2014, Bolshoi Theatre\n    *   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n    *   **Section:** Act II, Odette's variation (White Swan solo)\n    *   **Specific Step:** *Sissone fermée*\n\n2.  **Locate the Correct Performance Footage:**\n    The performance in question is the well-documented Bolshoi Ballet production from that era, which was broadcast live in cinemas in 2015. This is the reference footage for Svetlana Zakharova's performance in Yuri Grigorovich's version of Swan Lake.\n\n3.  **Identify the Odette Variation in Act II:**\n    In Act II, after the adagio (the slow duet between Odette and the Prince), Odette performs a solo. This is her variation. It is characterized by its delicate, mournful music, featuring a prominent violin solo.\n\n4.  **Define and Identify the Ballet Step: *Sissone Fermée***\n    *   A **sissone** is a jump that launches from two feet and lands on one.\n    *   **Fermée** means \"closed.\"\n    *   Therefore, a *sissone fermée* is a jump from two feet, landing on one, where the non-landing foot quickly closes to meet the landing foot (typically in the 5th position). In this variation, they are performed *en avant* (traveling forward).\n\n5.  **Count the Steps in the Choreography:**\n    We will now carefully watch the specific variation and count each instance of the step.\n    *   The variation begins with a preparation.\n    *   Zakharova then performs the signature opening phrase of the Grigorovich choreography. This phrase travels diagonally forward.\n    *   She executes the first **sissone fermée en avant**. (Count: 1)\n    *   She immediately follows with a second **sissone fermée en avant**. (Count: 2)\n    *   She performs a third **sissone fermée en avant**. (Count: 3)\n    *   She completes the sequence with a fourth and final **sissone fermée en avant**. (Count: 4)\n    *   After this sequence of four jumps, the choreography transitions to a different set of steps, including a series of floor-based turns (*tours piqués* or *pistolet turns*). No further *sissone fermées* are performed in the remainder of the variation.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choreographic Consistency:** The number of steps in a famous variation like this is standardized in the choreography. While individual style varies, the core sequence of steps does not. Grigorovich's version is distinct from the classic Petipa/Ivanov version and reliably contains this sequence of four *sissones*.\n*   **Step Identification:** It's crucial not to confuse *sissone fermée* with other jumps. For example, an *assemblé* lands on two feet, and a *jeté* takes off from one foot. The jump in question clearly launches from two feet and lands on one, with the other leg closing, which is the definition of a *sissone fermée*.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on a direct analysis of the choreography performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the 2014/2015 Bolshoi Theatre production of Yuri Grigorovich's *Swan Lake*, she performs a sequence of exactly four *sissone fermées* at the beginning of her Act II Odette variation.\n\n<<<4>>>"
