    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum (Δp) to its actual momentum (p) in the first Bohr orbit. This ratio is represented as (Δp / p).\n\n**2. Identify the Given Information:**\n*   The electron is in the **first Bohr orbit**, which means the principal quantum number **n = 1**.\n*   The uncertainty in the electron's position is **Δx = 10 pm**.\n\n**3. Plan the Calculation:**\nThe calculation can be broken down into three main parts:\n*   **Part A:** Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n*   **Part B:** Calculate the momentum (p) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit using the Bohr model.\n*   **Part C:** Calculate the ratio of the two values (Δp / p).\n\n### **List of Careful Points**\n\n*   **Constants:** We need to use standard values for physical constants:\n    *   Planck's constant (h) = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀), which is the radius of the first Bohr orbit (r₁) = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n*   **Units:** The given uncertainty in position (Δx) is in picometers (pm). It must be converted to the standard SI unit, meters (m), for calculations.\n    *   1 pm = 10⁻¹² m\n    *   Therefore, Δx = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m = 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n*   **Formulas:**\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** The minimum uncertainty is given by the relation: Δx * Δp = h / (4π).\n    *   **Bohr's Model for Momentum:** The angular momentum (L) is quantized: L = mvr = n * (h / 2π). The linear momentum is p = mv. From this, we can derive the formula for linear momentum: p = n * h / (2π * rₙ), where rₙ is the radius of the n-th orbit.\n*   **Assumptions:** The question refers to the Bohr orbit, so we assume a hydrogen atom where the radius of the first orbit (n=1) is the Bohr radius (a₀).\n\n### **Acquiring the Final Answer**\n\n**Part A: Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum (Δp)**\n\nUsing Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:\nΔp = h / (4π * Δx)\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n*   h = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   π ≈ 3.14159\n*   Δx = 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nΔp = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴) / (4 * 3.14159 * 1 x 10⁻¹¹)\nΔp ≈ 5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Part B: Calculate the Momentum (p) in the First Bohr Orbit**\n\nUsing the formula derived from the Bohr model for n=1:\np = (1 * h) / (2π * r₁)\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n*   h = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s\n*   r₁ = a₀ = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\np = (6.626 x 10⁻³⁴) / (2 * 3.14159 * 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹)\np ≈ 1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s\n\n**Part C: Calculate the Ratio (Δp / p)**\n\nRatio = Δp / p\nRatio = (5.273 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s) / (1.992 x 10⁻²⁴ kg·m/s)\nRatio ≈ 2.647\n\n**Alternative Method (using symbolic simplification):**\nLet's express the ratio symbolically before plugging in numbers.\n\nRatio = Δp / p = [ h / (4π * Δx) ] / [ n * h / (2π * rₙ) ]\n\nFor the first orbit, n=1 and rₙ = r₁:\n\nRatio = [ h / (4π * Δx) ] / [ h / (2π * r₁) ]\nRatio = (h / (4π * Δx)) * (2π * r₁ / h)\n\nCancel 'h' from the numerator and denominator. Cancel '2π' from '4π', leaving '2' in the denominator.\n\nRatio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\n\nNow, substitute the values into this simpler formula:\n*   r₁ = 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n*   Δx = 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m\n\nRatio = (5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m) / (2 * 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m)\nRatio = 5.29 / 2\nRatio = 2.645\n\nThe slight difference in the final digit (2.647 vs 2.645) is due to rounding in the intermediate steps of the first method. The second method is more precise.\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
