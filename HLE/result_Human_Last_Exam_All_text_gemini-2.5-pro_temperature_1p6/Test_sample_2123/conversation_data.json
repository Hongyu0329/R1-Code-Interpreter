    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the surname of an English poet. The key clues are that this surname appears in a Russian text (described as a \"translation of an essay\") within a description of the \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" The way the name \"appears\" suggests a play on words or a pun, rather than a simple mention.\n\n2.  **Identify the Source and Context:** This is a well-known literary reference. However, the details in the question are slightly misremembered, which is common for this particular anecdote.\n    *   The work is not a translation but an original Russian novel: **\"Zoo, or Letters Not About Love\" («Zoo, или Письма не о любви»)** by Viktor Shklovsky, published in 1923.\n    *   The city being described is not Vienna, but **Berlin**. Both cities have grand boulevards and were centers of Russian émigré culture in the 1920s, which explains the common confusion.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Pun:** The central point of the reference is a pun that only works in Russian. Shklovsky is describing the exceptionally wide streets of post-WWI Berlin and struggles to find an adequate comparison. He then creates a unique one based on a poet's name.\n    *   The English poet's surname is **Shelley**.\n    *   In Russian, \"Shelley\" is written as **Шелли**.\n    *   The Russian word for \"wider\" (the comparative form of \"wide\") is **шире** (\"shire\").\n    *   Shklovsky notes the phonetic similarity between **Шелли (Shelley)** and **шире (shire)**.\n\n4.  **The Original Quote:** Shklovsky first explains the pun and then uses it. In the tenth letter of his book, he writes: \"Фамилия английского поэта Шелли по-русски звучит почти как «шире». Улицы в Берлине широки, как Шелли.\"\n    *   Translation: \"The surname of the English poet Shelley in Russian sounds almost like 'wider'. The streets in Berlin are as wide as Shelley.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on this direct literary evidence from Viktor Shklovsky's work, the English poet whose surname is used to describe the wide boulevards (of Berlin, not Vienna) is Shelley. The name is used because of its phonetic resemblance to the Russian word for \"wider\".\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe surname is that of the English Romantic poet whose name in Russian (**Шелли**) sounds like the Russian word for \"wider\" (**шире**). This poet is Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\n<<<Shelley>>>"
