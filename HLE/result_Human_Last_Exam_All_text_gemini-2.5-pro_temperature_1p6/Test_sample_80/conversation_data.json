    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify and Count the Edge Squares**\n\n*   A standard 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares.\n*   The edge squares are those on the perimeter of the board (the first and eighth ranks, and the 'a' and 'h' files).\n*   We can count them: 8 squares on the top row + 8 squares on the bottom row + 6 squares on the left side (excluding corners) + 6 squares on the right side (excluding corners).\n*   Total edge squares = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Bishop's Movement and Attack**\n\n*   A bishop moves and attacks along diagonals.\n*   A crucial point is that a bishop always remains on squares of the same color. A bishop on a white square can only attack other pieces on white squares, and a bishop on a black square can only attack other pieces on black squares.\n*   This means we can solve the problem for white edge squares and black edge squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Edge Squares by Color**\n\n*   Of the 28 edge squares, we need to determine how many are white and how many are black. By examining a chessboard pattern, we find perfect symmetry.\n*   Number of white edge squares = 14.\n*   Number of black edge squares = 14.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize Bishops on White Edge Squares**\n\n*   The goal is to place as many bishops as possible on the 14 white edge squares without any attacking each other.\n*   We need to find pairs or groups of white edge squares that lie on the same diagonal.\n*   The 14 white edge squares are: `b1, d1, f1, h1, a2, a4, a6, a8, c8, e8, g8, h3, h5, h7`.\n*   Let's analyze their diagonal connections:\n    *   The squares `a8` and `h1` are on the same diagonal. We can only place one bishop between them.\n    *   The squares `b1, a2, g8, h7` form a connected group. Placing a bishop on `b1` attacks `a2` and `h7`. Placing one on `a2` attacks `b1` and `g8`. From this group of 4, we can place a maximum of 2 non-attacking bishops (e.g., on `b1` and `g8`).\n    *   The squares `d1, a4, e8, h5` form another such group. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `d1` and `e8`).\n    *   The squares `f1, a6, c8, h3` form the final group. We can place a maximum of 2 bishops here (e.g., on `f1` and `c8`).\n*   So, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the white edge squares is 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize Bishops on Black Edge Squares**\n\n*   Due to the symmetry of the chessboard, the problem for the 14 black edge squares is identical to the one for the white squares.\n*   The 14 black edge squares also break down into similar groups.\n*   Therefore, the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the black edge squares is also 7.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Bishops Placed**\n\n*   Since the placement on white squares and black squares are independent problems, we can add the results.\n*   Total maximum bishops placed = (Max on white) + (Max on black)\n*   Total maximum bishops placed = 7 + 7 = 14.\n\n**Step 7: Find the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\n\n*   The question asks how many edge squares would *lack* bishops if the maximum number were placed.\n*   Total number of edge squares = 28.\n*   Total number of placed bishops = 14.\n*   Number of edge squares without bishops = Total edge squares - Total placed bishops\n*   Number of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
