The optimal combination is a single-site catalyst derived from the precursor **Bis(pentamethylcyclopentadienyl)dimethylzirconium(IV) (Cp*₂Zr(CH₃)₂)**, which is supported and activated on **sulfated alumina (SA)**.

**Rationale:**
*   **Metal (Zirconium):** Provides a well-balanced platform for high catalytic activity and stability required for both polymerization and high-temperature degradation.
*   **Ligands (Pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, Cp*):** The two Cp* ligands create a thermally robust framework, essential for the harsh conditions of hydrogenolysis. They also provide an electronic environment at the Zr center that is conducive to the C-C bond cleavage reactions.
*   **Support/Activator (Sulfated Alumina):** This is a crucial component. The strong Lewis acid sites on the sulfated alumina abstract a methyl group from the Cp*₂Zr(CH₃)₂ precursor to generate a highly electrophilic, surface-tethered cationic species, [Cp*₂Zr-CH₃]⁺. This cation is the active site for both reactions.

This single active site can perform both functions by altering the conditions:
1.  **For Olefin Polymerization:** At lower temperatures and in the presence of olefin monomer, it catalyzes chain growth.
2.  **For Polyolefin Degradation:** At higher temperatures, in the absence of monomer, and under hydrogen pressure, the same site catalyzes the hydrogenolysis (cleavage) of the polymer's C-C backbone into short, saturated alkanes.
