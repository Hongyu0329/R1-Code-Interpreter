The two problems are:
1. **The Inaccessibility of Truth from the First-Person Perspective:** The JTB model requires truth as a condition for knowledge, but truth is an objective property of the world that is not directly accessible to the believer. A person with a justified belief cannot internally distinguish between having Knowledge (a Justified True Belief) and having a Justified False Belief (which, under the constraint, is just "Belief"). The epistemic state of the individual is therefore opaque to the individual themselves.

2. **The Loss of Important Epistemic Distinctions:** The binary system of Knowledge/Belief forces epistemically distinct states into the same category. A Justified False Belief, which is rationally held and epistemically valuable, is classified in the exact same state ("Belief") as an Unjustified False Belief (e.g., a superstition) or an Unjustified True Belief (a lucky guess). This "lumping" problem means the model fails to capture the different epistemic values of various non-knowledge states, particularly undervaluing the role of justification when a belief turns out to be false.
