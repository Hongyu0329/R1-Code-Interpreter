    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core elements of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific fictional singer who \"performs\" as a cardboard cutout at a specific event (the Junior prom) in a specific episode (\"Teen Girl Squad #15\") of the \"Homestar Runner\" online cartoon series.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the specific scene in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".**\nThis episode is the finale of the Teen Girl Squad series, and its plot centers around the main characters attending their junior prom. The prom needs a musical act.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the introduction of the musical act.**\nDuring the prom scene, Cheerleader acts as the announcer. She introduces the entertainment for the evening. Her dialogue is the key to finding the answer.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the exact name announced.**\nCheerleader says, \"And now, for your dancin' and romancin' pleasure, put your hands together for a cardboard cutout of... **Casio-Tones**!\" The name \"CASIO-TONES\" also appears in text on the screen next to the cutout.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **The \"performer\" is not a live character:** The question correctly notes it's a cardboard cutout. This is a typical joke for the low-fi, DIY aesthetic of the Teen Girl Squad cartoons.\n*   **The name is a pun:** \"Casio-Tones\" is a play on the brand name \"Casio\" and the synthesized \"tones\" produced by their popular electronic keyboards, which were prevalent in the 80s and 90s. This fits the humorous and retro style of the series.\n*   **Confirmation in the visuals:** The name is both spoken by a character and written on the screen, leaving no ambiguity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the dialogue and on-screen text in the prom scene of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the fictional singer represented by the cardboard cutout is named Casio-Tones.\n\n<<<Casio-Tones>>>"
