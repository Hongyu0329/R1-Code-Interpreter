    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Locate the Waskaganish gathering place.**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish, in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of Quebec. Geographically, Waskaganish is situated on the southeast coast of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate coordinates are 51.5° N latitude, 78.8° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the provinces and territories neighbouring Quebec.**\nQuebec shares borders with the following Canadian provinces and territories:\n*   **Ontario** to the west and southwest.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador** to the east.\n*   **New Brunswick** to the southeast.\n*   **Nunavut** to the north. The border runs through Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, and Ungava Bay. Some islands within James Bay, such as Akimiski Island, are also part of Nunavut.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the proximity of each neighbour to Waskaganish.**\n\n*   **Proximity to Ontario:** Waskaganish is located in the far west of Quebec. The provincial border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, meeting the coast of James Bay a short distance to the west of Waskaganish. A direct line from Waskaganish to the Ontario border is a very short distance, estimated to be under 50 kilometers.\n\n*   **Proximity to Nunavut:** The closest part of the territory of Nunavut to Waskaganish is Akimiski Island, which is located in the middle of James Bay. The island lies northwest of Waskaganish. The distance from Waskaganish across the water to the nearest point on Akimiski Island is significantly greater than the distance to the land border of Ontario. The distance is roughly 200 kilometers.\n\n*   **Proximity to Newfoundland and Labrador:** The border with Labrador is on the far eastern side of Quebec. Waskaganish is on the far western side. This requires traversing almost the entire width of northern Quebec, a distance of over 1,000 kilometers. This is clearly not the closest.\n\n*   **Proximity to New Brunswick:** The border with New Brunswick is far to the south and east of Waskaganish, making it much farther away than Ontario or Nunavut.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude by comparing the distances.**\n\n*   Distance to Ontario: Very short (under 50 km).\n*   Distance to Nunavut: Short, but significantly longer than to Ontario (approx. 200 km).\n*   Distance to Newfoundland and Labrador: Very long (over 1,000 km).\n*   Distance to New Brunswick: Very long.\n\nComparing these distances, the land border of Ontario is, by a significant margin, the closest provincial or territorial boundary to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Exact Location:** Knowing that Waskaganish is on the *eastern* coast of James Bay is crucial.\n2.  **Territorial Islands:** One must remember that Nunavut includes islands in James Bay (like Akimiski Island), making it a contender. Without this knowledge, one might only consider the mainland of Nunavut, which is much farther north.\n3.  **Nature of the Border:** The Quebec-Ontario border in this region is a defined line of longitude that extends to the coast of James Bay. The proximity is to this land border, not just the opposite shore.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the closest province is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
