    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum number of different clique sizes that can exist as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n*   **Graph:** A set of 128 vertices and some edges connecting them.\n*   **Clique:** A subset of vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex in the subset. A clique of size `k` is denoted as `K_k`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** A subgraph formed by a subset of vertices and *all* the edges from the original graph that connect vertices in that subset. For a clique, the concept of a subgraph and an induced subgraph are the same. If a set of `k` vertices forms a clique, the subgraph induced by these `k` vertices is a `K_k`.\n*   **Different Clique Sizes:** We are looking for the number of distinct values of `k` (e.g., k=3, k=5, k=10) for which a `K_k` exists in the graph.\n*   **Maximum Possible Number:** We need to find a single graph on 128 vertices that maximizes this count of different clique sizes.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between Clique Sizes**\n\nLet's consider a graph `G`. Suppose `G` contains a clique of size `k`. Let this clique be the set of vertices `C = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_k}`. By the definition of a clique, every pair of distinct vertices in `C` is connected by an edge.\n\nNow, consider any integer `j` such that `1 ≤ j < k`. We can form a subset `C'` of `C` by choosing any `j` vertices from `C`. For example, `C' = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_j}`. Since every vertex in `C'` is also in `C`, all vertices in `C'` are mutually connected to each other. Therefore, `C'` is a clique of size `j`.\n\n**Careful Point:** This is the most crucial observation. The existence of a clique of size `k` in a graph *guarantees* the existence of cliques of all smaller sizes, from `j = 1` up to `j = k-1`.\n\n**Step 3: Relate the Number of Clique Sizes to the Clique Number**\n\nFrom the analysis in Step 2, if the largest clique in a graph `G` has size `w(G)` (this is called the **clique number** of `G`), then the graph `G` must also contain cliques of sizes `w(G)-1`, `w(G)-2`, ..., all the way down to 1. (A single vertex is a clique of size 1, and any non-empty graph has at least one vertex).\n\nTherefore, for any graph `G`, the set of all possible clique sizes is `{1, 2, ..., w(G)}`. The number of different clique sizes is simply `w(G)`.\n\n**Step 4: Reframe the Problem**\n\nThe problem has been simplified to: What is the maximum possible clique number, `w(G)`, for a graph `G` on `n = 128` vertices?\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Maximum Clique Number**\n\nThe size of a clique is the number of vertices in it. Since a clique is a subset of the vertices of the graph, its size cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph. For a graph with `n = 128` vertices, the clique number `w(G)` must satisfy `w(G) ≤ 128`.\n\n**Step 6: Show that this Maximum is Achievable**\n\nTo prove that 128 is the maximum possible value, we must demonstrate that there exists a graph on 128 vertices with a clique number of 128.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted `K_128`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The set of all 128 vertices itself forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number of `K_128` is `w(K_{128}) = 128`.\n\n**Step 7: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The number of different clique sizes in any graph `G` is equal to its clique number, `w(G)`.\n*   We want to maximize this number for a graph on 128 vertices. This is equivalent to maximizing `w(G)`.\n*   The maximum possible value for `w(G)` on a 128-vertex graph is 128.\n*   This maximum is achieved by the complete graph `K_128`, which contains cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n*   Therefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
