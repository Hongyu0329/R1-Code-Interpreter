    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### **1. Analyze the Question and Define a Coordinate System**\n\n*   **The Objects:** We have two identical cubes, each with a side length of 1.\n*   **The Transformation:** One cube is shifted relative to the other.\n*   **The Shift:** The shift has a magnitude (distance) of 1/2 and occurs along the direction of a main diagonal.\n*   **The Goal:** Calculate the volume of the region where the two cubes overlap (their intersection).\n\nTo make the problem easier to solve, we can place the first cube (Cube A) in a convenient position in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system. Let's place one of its vertices at the origin (0,0,0) and have its edges align with the positive x, y, and z axes.\n\n*   **Cube A:** This cube is defined by the set of all points (x, y, z) such that:\n    *   0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ y ≤ 1\n    *   0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n### **2. List Careful Points**\n\n*   **Main Diagonal:** A \"main diagonal\" (or space diagonal) of a cube connects two opposite vertices. For our Cube A, the main diagonal starting from the origin (0,0,0) connects to the vertex (1,1,1). The vector representing this diagonal is **v** = (1, 1, 1).\n*   **Shift Vector:** The shift is *not* simply moving the cube by 1/2 along each axis. The total distance of the shift is 1/2. We must calculate the components of the shift vector.\n*   **Orientation:** The problem describes a \"shift,\" which is a translation. This means the second cube (Cube B) maintains the same orientation as Cube A; its faces remain parallel to the coordinate planes.\n*   **Intersection Shape:** Because the cubes remain axis-aligned, their intersection will also be an axis-aligned rectangular prism (which, in this case, will turn out to be a smaller cube).\n\n### **3. Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Solution**\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Shift Vector**\nThe direction of the shift is along the main diagonal, represented by the vector **v** = (1, 1, 1).\nThe length of this vector is ||**v**|| = √(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.\nTo get a unit vector **u** in this direction, we divide **v** by its length:\n**u** = (1/√3, 1/√3, 1/√3)\nThe shift has a magnitude of 1/2. So, the displacement vector **d** is:\n**d** = (1/2) * **u** = (1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3))\n\n**Step 2: Define the Position of the Shifted Cube (Cube B)**\nCube B is the result of shifting every point of Cube A by the vector **d**. Let `s = 1/(2√3)`. The shift vector is **d** = (s, s, s).\nA point (x, y, z) is in Cube B if the point (x-s, y-s, z-s) is in Cube A. Therefore, the coordinates of Cube B are defined by:\n*   0 ≤ x - s ≤ 1  =>  s ≤ x ≤ 1 + s\n*   0 ≤ y - s ≤ 1  =>  s ≤ y ≤ 1 + s\n*   0 ≤ z - s ≤ 1  =>  s ≤ z ≤ 1 + s\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Bounds of the Intersection**\nThe intersection is the region where a point (x, y, z) satisfies the inequalities for both Cube A and Cube B. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n\n*   **For x:**\n    *   Cube A requires: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1\n    *   Cube B requires: s ≤ x ≤ 1 + s\n    *   The intersection of these two intervals is [max(0, s), min(1, 1+s)] which is [s, 1].\n*   **For y:** By symmetry, the interval is the same: [s, 1].\n*   **For z:** By symmetry, the interval is the same: [s, 1].\n\nThe intersection volume is a smaller cube defined by:\n*   s ≤ x ≤ 1\n*   s ≤ y ≤ 1\n*   s ≤ z ≤ 1\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\nThe side length of this new intersection cube is (upper bound - lower bound):\nSide length = 1 - s = 1 - 1/(2√3)\nThe volume `V` is the side length cubed:\nV = (1 - 1/(2√3))³\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the Final Expression**\nWe use the binomial expansion formula (a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³.\nLet a = 1 and b = 1/(2√3).\nV = 1³ - 3(1)²(1/(2√3)) + 3(1)(1/(2√3))² - (1/(2√3))³\nV = 1 - 3/(2√3) + 3/(4*3) - 1/(8 * 3√3)\nV = 1 - 3/(2√3) + 1/4 - 1/(24√3)\n\nNow, combine the constant and the radical terms separately.\nV = (1 + 1/4) - (3/(2√3) + 1/(24√3))\nV = 5/4 - ( (18)/(24√3) + 1/(24√3) )\nV = 5/4 - 19/(24√3)\nRationalize the denominator of the second term:\n19/(24√3) = (19 * √3) / (24 * √3 * √3) = 19√3 / 72\n\n*Correction on arithmetic simplification:*\nLet's redo the combination of radical terms from V = 5/4 - (3/(2√3) + 1/(24√3))\nFirst, rationalize each term:\n*   3/(2√3) = (3√3)/(2*3) = √3/2\n*   1/(24√3) = √3/(24*3) = √3/72\nNow combine them:\n*   √3/2 + √3/72 = (36√3)/72 + √3/72 = 37√3/72\nSo, the final volume is:\nV = 5/4 - 37√3/72"
