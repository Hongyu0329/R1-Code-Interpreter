    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\n1.  **Molecule:** Toluene, with the chemical formula C7H8.\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n2.  **Basis Set:** 6-31G. This is a Pople-style split-valence basis set.\n3.  **Question:** We need to find the total number of **contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs)**. These are also commonly referred to as basis functions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" tells us how many primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) are combined (contracted) to form a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF) for each atomic orbital.\n\n*   **The number before the hyphen (`6-`)**: Describes the core atomic orbitals. Each core orbital is represented by **one CGF**, which is a fixed linear combination of 6 PGFs.\n*   **The numbers after the hyphen (`-31`)**: Describe the valence atomic orbitals. This is a \"split-valence\" description, meaning the valence shell is represented by two basis functions per orbital, providing more flexibility.\n    *   The first number (`3`) means the inner part of the valence shell is described by **one CGF** made from 3 PGFs.\n    *   The second number (`1`) means the outer part of the valence shell is described by **one CGF** made from 1 PGF.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Number of Contracted Functions per Atom\n\nWe apply the basis set rules to each type of atom in the molecule.\n\n**A. For a Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n*   Hydrogen has only a 1s orbital, which is its valence orbital. It has no core electrons.\n*   The valence rule (`-31G`) applies.\n*   The 1s orbital is split into two parts:\n    1.  An inner basis function (CGF) made from 3 PGFs.\n    2.  An outer basis function (CGF) made from 1 PGF.\n*   **Total CGFs per H atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2.**\n\n**B. For a Carbon (C) atom:**\n*   Carbon has a 1s core orbital and 2s, 2p valence orbitals.\n*   **Core orbital (1s):**\n    *   The core rule (`6-`) applies.\n    *   The 1s orbital is represented by **1 CGF**.\n*   **Valence orbitals (2s and 2p):**\n    *   The split-valence rule (`-31G`) applies to the 2s and the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz).\n    *   For the 2s orbital, it is represented by two basis functions: 1 inner CGF and 1 outer CGF. Total = **2 CGFs**.\n    *   For *each* of the three 2p orbitals, it is also represented by two basis functions: 1 inner CGF and 1 outer CGF. Total for all three 2p orbitals = 3 orbitals × 2 CGFs/orbital = **6 CGFs**.\n*   **Total CGFs per C atom = 1 (for 1s core) + 2 (for 2s valence) + 6 (for 2p valence) = 9.**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for *contracted* functions, not *primitive* functions. The total number of primitive Gaussians would be much higher.\n2.  **Correctly Interpreting Pople Notation:** It's crucial to understand that the numbers (6, 3, 1) refer to the number of primitives that make up a contracted function, and that the split (`-31`) applies only to the valence shell.\n3.  **Atom Count:** Ensure the correct number of atoms for the molecule (C7H8) is used in the final calculation.\n4.  **Applying rules to shells:** For Carbon, the core `6-` rule applies to the 1s shell. The valence `-31G` rule applies to the entire n=2 shell, meaning both the 2s and the 2p orbitals are split.\n\n### Final Calculation: Step by Step\n\nNow, we combine the information for the entire toluene molecule (C7H8).\n\n1.  **Calculate the total CGFs from all Carbon atoms:**\n    *   Number of C atoms = 7\n    *   CGFs per C atom = 9\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n\n2.  **Calculate the total CGFs from all Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Number of H atoms = 8\n    *   CGFs per H atom = 2\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n\n3.  **Sum the contributions from all atoms to get the final answer:**\n    *   Total CGFs for toluene = (Total from Carbon) + (Total from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total CGFs for toluene = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n<<<79>>>"
