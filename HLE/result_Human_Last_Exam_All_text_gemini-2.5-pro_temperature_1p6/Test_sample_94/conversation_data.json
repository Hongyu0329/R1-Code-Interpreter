    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Clues\n\nThe question provides several key pieces of information to identify the physicist:\n1.  **Field:** Better known for work in microscopy.\n2.  **Discovery:** An optical effect.\n3.  **Context:** The effect was observed in \"real imagery\".\n4.  **Apparatus:** A concave mirror was involved.\n5.  **Origin:** The discovery was accidental and first observed by a non-scientist (a custodial worker) who was cleaning the mirror.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls\n\n*   **Anecdotal Evidence:** The story about the custodial worker is an anecdote. While famous, details can vary in different tellings. The core of the clue is an *accidental discovery* by an observant person, not necessarily a physicist, related to the cleaning or flaws on a mirror.\n*   **\"Microscopy\":** The physicist's fame comes from microscopy, but the initial discovery might have happened in a different context (e.g., spectroscopy, telescopy) that used similar optical components.\n*   **\"Optical Effect\":** We need to identify a specific named effect or principle that matches the story.\n*   **\"Real Imagery\":** This is a technical term in optics. A concave mirror can form a real, inverted image of an object placed farther away than its focal point. This is a crucial detail that points towards a specific optical setup.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  We start with the strongest and most unique clue: the anecdote about the accidental discovery involving a concave mirror and a worker. This specific story is famously associated with one particular physicist.\n\n2.  Let's search for physicists linked to such a story. The anecdote is widely attributed to **Frits Zernike**. The story goes that he was examining a diffraction grating, which in his setup (a Rowland grating) was ruled onto a concave mirror.\n\n3.  Let's check if Zernike fits the other clues:\n    *   **Microscopy:** Is he famous for microscopy? Yes, Frits Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1953 for his invention of the **phase-contrast microscope**. This is his most significant and well-known work.\n    *   **Optical Effect:** What was the effect he discovered? He noticed that faint \"ghost\" images seen in his spectroscope were not just mirror imperfections, but were actually phase-shifted light waves from the main image. He realized that tiny, transparent objects (like scratches or dust, or unstained biological cells) that don't absorb light could still be made visible by converting these invisible phase differences into visible amplitude (brightness) differences. This is the principle of **phase contrast**.\n    *   **Concave Mirror and Real Imagery:** His work involved a concave diffraction grating. He was observing the real image of a light source formed by this concave optical element. The flaws on the mirror's surface (similar to those a cleaner might be trying to remove or might accidentally cause) made the image of the light source's filament appear with strange and enhanced contrast.\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the information:** Frits Zernike perfectly matches all the criteria. His Nobel-winning invention, the phase-contrast microscope, stemmed directly from an observation of an optical effect (phase contrast). This observation was made using a concave mirror (as part of a grating spectroscope), and the widely told origin story involves an accidental observation related to flaws on the mirror's surface, often attributed to the actions of a cleaner or technician.\n\n<<<Frits Zernike>>>"
