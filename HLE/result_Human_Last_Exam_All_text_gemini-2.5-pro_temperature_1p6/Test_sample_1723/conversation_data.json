    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the name of the mushroom genus with a blue spore print.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** A genus of mushroom.\n    *   **Key Identifying Feature:** Produces a \"distinctly blue spore print.\"\n    *   **Constraint:** There is a \"single genus\" known for this trait.\n    This tells us we are looking for a very specific and rare characteristic in the fungal kingdom.\n\n2.  **Understand Spore Prints:**\n    A spore print is a crucial identification tool in mycology. It is made by placing a mushroom cap, gills down, on a surface (often paper) and allowing its microscopic spores to fall and create a visible deposit. The color of this deposit is a key genetic trait of the species.\n\n3.  **Distinguish Spore Print Color from Mushroom Color:**\n    It is important not to confuse the color of the spore print with the color of the mushroom's body (cap, gills, or stem) or the color it turns when bruised.\n    *   **Example 1:** *Lactarius indigo*, the indigo milk cap, is a vibrant blue mushroom but produces a white to cream-colored spore print.\n    *   **Example 2:** Many species in the *Boletus* and *Psilocybe* genera stain blue when bruised or damaged, but their spore prints are olive-brown and purple-brown to black, respectively.\n    The question specifically asks about the color of the spores themselves, not any other part of the mushroom.\n\n4.  **Survey Common Spore Print Colors:**\n    Most mushrooms produce spores in a limited range of colors. Standard spore print colors include:\n    *   White (*Amanita*, *Lepiota*, *Lactarius*)\n    *   Pink to Pinkish-brown (*Pluteus*, most *Entoloma*)\n    *   Brown (ranging from rusty-brown in *Cortinarius* to chocolate-brown in *Agaricus*)\n    *   Purple-brown to Black (*Psilocybe*, *Panaeolus*, *Coprinopsis*)\n    *   Yellow/Ochre (*Russula* can have cream to yellow prints)\n    *   Olive (*Boletus* can have olive-brown prints)\n    Noticeably absent from this common list is blue.\n\n5.  **Identify the Unique Genus:**\n    Mycological sources confirm that a blue spore print is exceptionally rare, and this characteristic is found only within a single, large genus: **Entoloma**.\n\n6.  **Add Important Nuance:**\n    While **Entoloma** is the correct answer, it's important to understand the context. The genus *Entoloma* is vast, with over 1,000 species. The hallmark of the genus as a whole is actually its pink, angular spores. However, *Entoloma* is unique because it is the only genus that contains a small group of species that break this rule and produce spores with distinct blue, violaceous, or blue-gray hues. Species like *Entoloma virescens* and others within subgenera like *Leptonia* are known for this trait. Therefore, while not all *Entoloma* have blue spores, it is the only genus where this feature is known to occur at all.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the single genus of mushroom known to contain species that produce a distinctly blue (or blue-gray) spore print is *Entoloma*.\n\n<<<Entoloma>>>"
