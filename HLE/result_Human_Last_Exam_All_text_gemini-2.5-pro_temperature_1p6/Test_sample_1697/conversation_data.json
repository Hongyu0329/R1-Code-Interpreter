    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide**: A benzene ring attached to an amide functional group, -C(=O)N-.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. This gives the group -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached to the 3-position of the benzene ring, assuming the benzamide group is at position 1. This means the -N(CH₃)₂ group is meta to the -C(=O)N(Et)₂ group.\n\nThe structure of the starting material is:\n```\n      (2) H\n        \\  /\n (1)C(=O)N(Et)₂ -- C(1) === C(6) -- H\n                  ||      |\n                H-C(2) --- C(5)-H\n                  |       ||\n            (3)-N(Me)₂ -- C(4) -- H\n```\nThe key features are the two substituents on the aromatic ring: the N,N-diethylamide group at C1 and the dimethylamino group at C3. Both of these groups can direct ortho-lithiation.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Conditions**\n1.  **sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium)**: This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary role is to abstract a proton (deprotonation) from the most acidic position.\n2.  **TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine)**: This is a chelating agent for lithium ions (Li⁺). It coordinates to the lithium, breaking up aggregates of sec-BuLi and increasing its basicity. More importantly, it helps in stabilizing the lithiated intermediate, especially in directed ortho-metalation reactions.\n3.  **THF (tetrahydrofuran)**: A polar aprotic solvent that is suitable for organolithium reactions.\n4.  **CH₃I (methyl iodide)**: This is an electrophile. The aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step will act as a nucleophile and attack the methyl group of CH₃I.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**\nThis reaction is a classic example of **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. In DoM, a substituent on an aromatic ring, known as a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), directs the strong base to deprotonate one of the adjacent (ortho) positions. Both the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) are effective DMGs.\n\nTo find the most likely site of deprotonation, we must consider the directing power and position of these groups:\n*   The **N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at C1** is one of the strongest DMGs known. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n*   The **dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at C3** is also a good DMG. It directs deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C4.\n\nNow let's evaluate the acidity and kinetic favorability of the aromatic protons:\n*   **Proton at C2**: This position is *ortho* to both the very strong amide DMG and the dimethylamino DMG. The two groups act cooperatively. The lithium ion (from sec-BuLi, complexed with TMEDA) can be chelated by both the amide's carbonyl oxygen and the amine's nitrogen. This forms a stable six-membered ring intermediate that holds the base in close proximity to the C2 proton, making it the most acidic and by far the most favorable site for deprotonation.\n*   **Proton at C4**: This position is ortho to the dimethylamino group but para to the amide group. It is activated, but much less so than C2.\n*   **Proton at C6**: This position is ortho to the strong amide group but meta to the dimethylamino group. It is also activated, but the synergistic effect at C2 is much stronger.\n\nTherefore, deprotonation will occur selectively and almost exclusively at the C2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Step 4: The Alkylation Step**\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion at C2). When methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added, this nucleophile attacks the electrophilic methyl carbon of CH₃I in an S_N2 reaction. The iodide ion (I⁻) is displaced, and a new carbon-carbon bond is formed between C2 of the aromatic ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Product**\nThe overall transformation replaces the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group. The final product has the following substituents on the benzene ring:\n*   An N,N-diethylamide group at C1.\n*   A methyl group at C2.\n*   A dimethylamino group at C3.\n\nThe IUPAC name for this compound is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
