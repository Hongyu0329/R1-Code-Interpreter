    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler.\n\n### **Analysis of the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the most recent historical battle that was the subject of a painting by the artist Lady Butler (Elizabeth Thompson). This requires:\n1.  Identifying the artist and her body of work.\n2.  Listing her paintings that depict specific, datable historical battles or military engagements.\n3.  Determining the historical date of each of these events.\n4.  Comparing the dates to identify the latest one.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Artist Identification:** The artist is Elizabeth Southerden Butler, née Thompson (1846–1933), a prominent British painter of military scenes.\n*   **Painting Date vs. Event Date:** It is crucial to distinguish between the date a painting was created and the date of the historical event it depicts. The question concerns the historical event's date.\n*   **Scope of Work:** Lady Butler had a long and prolific career, painting subjects from the Napoleonic Wars of the early 19th century up to World War I in the early 20th century. We must consider her entire body of work, not just her most famous paintings from the 1870s.\n*   **Defining \"Battle\":** Some paintings depict the direct aftermath of a battle, a specific charge within a battle, or a retreat following a battle. These are all directly linked to a specific historical engagement and should be considered.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\nHere is a list of some of Lady Butler's notable battle paintings, ordered by the historical date of the event they depict:\n\n1.  ***The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras*** **(Painted 1875)**\n    *   **Battle Depicted:** The Battle of Quatre Bras.\n    *   **Historical Date:** June 16, 1815.
