    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the core elements of the question:**\n    *   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n    *   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n    *   **Task:** Find the name of the character that the main character marries.\n\n2.  **Identify the main character of the novel:**\n    *   The protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, an astronaut from the 21st century who is revived in a far-future, post-human civilization.\n\n3.  **Analyze the main character's significant relationships:**\n    *   After his revival, Adam Zamoyski struggles to understand the new reality.\n    *   He forms a deep, central, and romantic bond with another character. This relationship is crucial to his development and his attempts to find his place in this new world.\n\n4.  **Identify the character he forms this bond with:**\n    *   The character Adam Zamoyski falls in love with and ultimately commits to is named Angelina. She is an inhabitant of this future, a \"stahs\" (Standard Humanoid Shell), and her own nature and existence are complex and central to the plot.\n\n5.  **Confirm the \"marriage\":**\n    *   The concept of \"marriage\" in the novel's far-future setting is not a traditional 21st-century ceremony. However, the union between Adam and Angelina is the narrative's equivalent. They form a permanent, committed partnership, deciding to fuse their existences and face the future together. This profound union is the culmination of their relationship arc. Therefore, in the context of the story, Angelina is the character he \"marries.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Protagonist Identification:** It is essential to correctly identify Adam Zamoyski as the protagonist to whom the question refers.\n*   **Context of \"Marriage\":** One must understand that in this science fiction setting, the term \"marriage\" represents a concept far more complex than a traditional human union. It involves a deeper integration of beings.\n*   **Character's Nature:** Angelina is not a baseline human like Adam was. She is a construct of the advanced civilization, which makes their relationship a key exploration of the novel's themes about humanity, identity, and love.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBy following the steps, we have established that the main character, Adam Zamoyski, forms a committed, marriage-equivalent union with the character named Angelina.\n\n<<<Angelina>>>"
