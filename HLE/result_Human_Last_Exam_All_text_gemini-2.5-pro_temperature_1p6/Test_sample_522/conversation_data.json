    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe goal is to determine the transformation rule that converts the input string into the output string and then apply this rule to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`. The input and output strings represent 2D grids of digits, where commas separate the rows.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Transformation in Example A**\n*   **Input_A**: '001111,121111,111111'\n    *   Grid A (Input):\n        ```\n        0 0 1 1 1 1  (Row 0)\n        1 2 1 1 1 1  (Row 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n        ```\n*   **Output_A**: '201111,101111,111111'\n    *   Grid A (Output):\n        ```\n        2 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 0 1 1 1 1\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n*   **Changes**: The '2' at position (1, 1) moved to position (0, 0). The original position (1, 1) became a '0'. The destination (0, 0) was originally a '0'.\n*   **Observation**: The '2' moves to a neighboring cell containing a '0'. Let's find the location of the '2' and its neighbors.\n    *   The '2' is at (row=1, col=1).\n    *   Its neighbors that contain a '0' are (0, 0) and (0, 1).\n    *   The chosen destination is (0, 0).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Transformation in Example B**\n*   **Input_B**: '0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000011110,1111002111111,1111111111111'\n    *   Grid B (Input): A 5x13 grid.\n    *   The '2' is at (row=3, col=6).\n*   **Output_B**: '0000000000000,1100000001000,1111000211110,1111000111111,1111111111111'\n    *   Grid B (Output): The '2' moved from (3, 6) to (2, 7). The original spot (3, 6) became a '0'.\n*   **Observation**:\n    *   The '2' is at (3, 6).\n    *   Let's check its neighbors in the input grid that contain '0': (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), and (3, 5).\n    *   The chosen destination is (2, 7).\n\n**Step 4: Formulate a Hypothesis for the Movement Rule**\nWe need a rule that explains why (0, 0) was chosen in Example A and (2, 7) was chosen in Example B.\n*   In A, the '2' is at (1, 1). Sum of coordinates: 1 + 1 = 2 (Even). The chosen '0' neighbor, (0, 0), is the first one you'd encounter in a standard top-to-bottom, left-to-right scan (reading order).\n*   In B, the '2' is at (3, 6). Sum of coordinates: 3 + 6 = 9 (Odd). The chosen '0' neighbor, (2, 7), is the right-most available one (it has the highest column index).\n\nThis suggests a two-part rule based on the parity of the sum of the '2's coordinates (r + c):\n*   **If r + c is EVEN**: The '2' moves to the first neighboring '0' found in reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).\n*   **If r + c is ODD**: The '2' moves to the neighboring '0' that is right-most (highest column index). If there's a tie for the column index, it moves to the top-most one (lowest row index).\n\nThis rule correctly explains both examples A and B.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Rule to Input_C**\n*   **Input_C**: '000000,011120,111111'\n    *   Grid C (Input):\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n        0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n        1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n        ```\n1.  **Locate '2'**: The '2' is at (r=1, c=4).\n2.  **Check Parity**: The sum of coordinates is 1 + 4 = 5 (Odd). We must use the ODD rule.\n3.  **Find '0' Neighbors**: The neighbors of (1, 4) are:\n    *   (0, 3) -> value '0'\n    *   (0, 4) -> value '0'\n    *   (0, 5) -> value '0'\n    *   (1, 3) -> value '1'\n    *   (1, 5) -> value '0'\n    *   (2, 3) -> value '1'\n    *   (2, 4) -> value '1'\n    *   (2, 5) -> value '1'\n    The available '0' locations are (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), and (1, 5).\n4.  **Apply ODD Rule**: \"Right-most, then top-most\".\n    *   The column indices are 3, 4, 5, 5. The maximum column index is 5.\n    *   The locations with column index 5 are (0, 5) and (1, 5).\n    *   Between these two, the top-most (lowest row index) is (0, 5).\n    *   Therefore, the destination for the '2' is (0, 5).\n5.  **Perform Transformation**:\n    *   The '2' at (1, 4) moves, so `grid[1][4]` becomes '0'.\n    *   The '0' at (0, 5) is the destination, so `grid[0][5]` becomes '2'.\n6.  **Construct the Final Grid**:\n    *   Original Row 0: `000000` -> New Row 0: `000002`\n    *   Original Row 1: `011120` -> New Row 1: `011100`\n    *   Row 2 is unchanged: `111111`\n7.  **Format the Output**: Combine the new rows with commas.\n\nThe result is `000002,011100,111111`.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
