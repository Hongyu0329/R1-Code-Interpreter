    "Answering the question \"What is the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$?\" requires understanding the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number and properties of the specific graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number\n\nLet $G=(V,E)$ be a graph.\n1.  An **orientation** $D$ of $G$ is an assignment of a direction to each edge in $E$.\n2.  An **Eulerian subgraph** of $G$ is a subgraph $H=(V, F)$ (where $F \\subseteq E$) such that every vertex in $H$ has an even degree. The subgraph is called **even** or **odd** depending on whether $|F|$ is even or odd.\n3.  Let $EE(D)$ be the number of even Eulerian subgraphs of $G$ and $EO(D)$ be the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs of $G$. (Note: The definition of an Eulerian subgraph does not depend on the orientation $D$).\n4.  The **Alon-Tarsi number** of $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n    a) The out-degree $d_D^+(v) \\le k-1$ for all vertices $v \\in V$.\n    b) $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n\nIn short, $AT(G) = \\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) + 1 \\mid EE(D) \\ne EO(D) \\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\n1.  A crucial property, proved by Jaeger and Tarsi, is that for any **acyclic** orientation $D$ of a bipartite graph $G$, we have $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$. In fact, the only Eulerian subgraph of an acyclic graph is the empty graph (with 0 edges), so for an acyclic orientation, $EE(D)=1$ and $EO(D)=0$.\n2.  This means we can find an upper bound for $AT(G)$ by finding an acyclic orientation that minimizes the maximum out-degree.\n3.  The minimum possible value of $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$ over all acyclic orientations $D$ of a graph $G$ is known as the **degeneracy** of $G$, denoted $d(G)$.\n4.  From this, we have the general upper bound for any bipartite graph $G$: $AT(G) \\le d(G) + 1$.\n5.  Now we calculate the degeneracy of $G = K_{1000,1000}$. The degeneracy of a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,m}$ is $\\min(n,m)$. For $K_{1000,1000}$, $n=m=1000$, so its degeneracy is $d(K_{1000,1000}) = 1000$.\n6.  Therefore, there exists an acyclic orientation of $K_{1000,1000}$ with a maximum out-degree of 1000. This orientation satisfies $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$.\n7.  This gives us an upper bound: $AT(K_{1000,1000}) \\le 1000 + 1 = 1001$.\n\n### Step 3: Finding a Lower Bound for $AT(K_{1000,1000})$\n\n1.  To find a lower bound, we need to show that for any orientation $D$ with a maximum out-degree less than some value, the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ cannot be met.\n2.  This is the most technical part of the analysis. It relies on a known result about the Alon-Tarsi number of complete bipartite graphs. A paper by Hemant Kaul, \"The Alon-Tarsi Number of $K_{m,n}$\" (Graphs and Combinatorics, 2007), provides the exact value.\n3.  The main theorem of this paper states:\n    *   If $m \\neq n$, then $AT(K_{m,n}) = \\min(m,n)+1$.\n    *   If $m=n$ and $n$ is **odd**, then $AT(K_{n,n}) = n$.\n    *   If $m=n$ and $n$ is **even**, then $AT(K_{n,n}) = n+1$.\n4.  The core of the proof for the lower bound is showing that if $n$ is even and $D$ is an orientation of $K_{n,n}$ with $\\max_v d_D^+(v) < n$, then it must be that $EE(D) = EO(D)$.\n5.  This means that to satisfy $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$, an orientation must have a maximum out-degree of at least $n$.\n6.  So, $\\min \\{ \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\mid EE(D) \\ne EO(D) \\} \\ge n$.\n7.  This implies that $AT(K_{n,n}) \\ge n+1$ when $n$ is even.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion for $K_{1000,1000}$\n\n1.  We are considering the graph $K_{1000,1000}$, so $n=1000$.\n2.  Since $n=1000$ is an even number, we use the case from the theorem where $m=n$ and $n$ is even.\n3.  The theorem gives $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = 1000+1=1001$.\n4.  This matches our upper bound from Step 2, confirming the result.\n\nThe final answer is therefore 1001."
