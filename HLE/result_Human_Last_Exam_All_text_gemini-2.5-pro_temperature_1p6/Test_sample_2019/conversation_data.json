    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints\n\n1.  **Board:** A 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This means the board wraps around on all four edges. We can represent the squares by coordinates `(r, c)` where `r` (row) and `c` (column) are integers from 0 to 4. All arithmetic on coordinates is performed modulo 5.\n2.  **Queens:** We are placing 4 queens. Queens are considered identical, so the order of placement does not matter. We are looking for the number of distinct sets of 4 squares.\n3.  **Non-Attacking Condition:** On a toroidal board, a queen at `(r, c)` attacks:\n    *   All squares in its row (`r' = r`).\n    *   All squares in its column (`c' = c`).\n    *   All squares on its main diagonal (`r' - c' ≡ r - c (mod 5)`).\n    *   All squares on its anti-diagonal (`r' + c' ≡ r + c (mod 5)`).\n\nFor 4 queens to be non-attacking, they must be placed on squares `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)` such that:\n*   The four row indices `r1, r2, r3, r4` must all be distinct.\n*   The four column indices `c1, c2, c3, c4` must all be distinct.\n*   The four main diagonal indices `d_i = r_i - c_i (mod 5)` must all be distinct.\n*   The four anti-diagonal indices `s_i = r_i + c_i (mod 5)` must all be distinct.\n\n### Step 2: A Combinatorial Insight\n\nSince we are placing 4 queens on a 5x5 board, there will be exactly one row, one column, one main diagonal, and one anti-diagonal that are left unoccupied. Let's call these the \"missing\" lines.\n\n*   Let `r_miss` be the index of the missing row.\n*   Let `c_miss` be the index of the missing column.\n*   Let `d_miss` be the index of the missing main diagonal.\n*   Let `s_miss` be the index of the missing anti-diagonal.\n\nThe sum of all row indices is `0+1+2+3+4 = 10 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`. The sum of the four occupied row indices `r_i` is therefore `(0+1+2+3+4) - r_miss ≡ -r_miss (mod 5)`. The same logic applies to columns and diagonals.\n*   `sum(r_i) ≡ -r_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `sum(c_i) ≡ -c_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `sum(d_i) ≡ -d_miss (mod 5)`\n*   `sum(s_i) ≡ -s_miss (mod 5)`\n\nFrom the definition of the diagonals for each queen `i`, we have `d_i = r_i - c_i` and `s_i = r_i + c_i`. Summing over the four queens:\n*   `sum(d_i) = sum(r_i) - sum(c_i)`\n*   `sum(s_i) = sum(r_i) + sum(c_i)`\n\nSubstituting the relations involving the missing lines:\n*   `-d_miss ≡ (-r_miss) - (-c_miss) ≡ c_miss - r_miss (mod 5)`, which implies `d_miss ≡ r_miss - c_miss (mod 5)`.\n*   `-s_miss ≡ (-r_miss) + (-c_miss) ≡ - (r_miss + c_miss) (mod 5)`, which implies `s_miss ≡ r_miss + c_miss (mod 5)`.\n\nThis is a crucial finding: the indices of the missing main and anti-diagonals are completely determined by the indices of the missing row and column.\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Configurations\n\nWe can now count the total number of configurations by following these steps:\n\n1.  **Choose the missing row and column.**\n    *   There are 5 choices for `r_miss` (from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}).\n    *   There are 5 choices for `c_miss` (from {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}).\n    *   This gives `5 * 5 = 25` ways to choose the set of occupied rows, columns, main diagonals, and anti-diagonals. Each choice represents a distinct class of solutions.\n\n2.  **For a fixed class, find the number of placements.**\n    Let's find the number of ways for a specific case, e.g., `r_miss = 0` and `c_miss = 0`.\n    *   This choice implies `d_miss = 0-0=0` and `s_miss = 0+0=0`.\n    *   The queens must occupy rows from the set `R = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n    *   The queens must occupy columns from the set `C = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n    *   The main diagonals occupied must be `D = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n    *   The anti-diagonals occupied must be `S = {1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n    We are looking for a permutation `p` of `{1, 2, 3, 4}` such that the placement `{(i, p(i)) | i ∈ {1,2,3,4}}` satisfies the diagonal conditions:\n    *   The set of values `{i - p(i) mod 5}` must be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n    *   The set of values `{i + p(i) mod 5}` must be `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.\n\n3.  **Test the permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}.** There are `4! = 24` such permutations.\n    Let's test one, e.g., `p = (2, 4, 1, 3)`. The queen positions are `(1,2), (2,4), (3,1), (4,3)`.\n    *   Main diagonals `(r-c mod 5)`: `{1-2, 2-4, 3-1, 4-3}` = `{-1, -2, 2, 1}` = `{4, 3, 2, 1}`. This set is `{1,2,3,4}`, which is correct.\n    *   Anti-diagonals `(r+c mod 5)`: `{1+2, 2+4, 3+1, 4+3}` = `{3, 6, 4, 7}` = `{3, 1, 4, 2}`. This set is `{1,2,3,4}`, which is correct.\n    This permutation represents a valid placement.\n\n    Let's test another, e.g., `p = (3, 1, 4, 2)`. The queen positions are `(1,3), (2,1), (3,4), (4,2)`.\n    *   Main diagonals `(r-c mod 5)`: `{1-3, 2-1, 3-4, 4-2}` = `{-2, 1, -1, 2}` = `{3, 1, 4, 2}`. Correct.\n    *   Anti-diagonals `(r+c mod 5)`: `{1+3, 2+1, 3+4, 4+2}` = `{4, 3, 7, 6}` = `{4, 3, 2, 1}`. Correct.\n    This is also a valid placement.\n\n    A thorough check of all 24 permutations reveals that only these two permutations, `(2,4,1,3)` and `(3,1,4,2)`, satisfy the conditions for the class `(r_miss, c_miss) = (0,0)`. So there are **2** solutions for this specific class.\n\n4.  **Use symmetry to find the total count.**\n    The toroidal board is symmetric under translation. Any solution can be translated to a new valid solution. Specifically, a solution corresponding to the class `(r_miss, c_miss)` can be translated into a solution for any other class `(r'_miss, c'_miss)`. This means that the number of solutions is the same for every one of the 25 classes.\n    *   Number of classes = 25.\n    *   Number of solutions per class = 2.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer.**\n    The total number of ways is the product of the number of classes and the number of solutions per class.\n    Total Ways = 25 classes × 2 solutions/class = 50.\n\nThe sets of squares for any two different classes `(r_miss, c_miss)` and `(r'_miss, c'_miss)` are necessarily distinct, because they occupy different sets of rows (if `r_miss != r'_miss`) or columns (if `c_miss != c'_miss`). Therefore, our method counts each unique configuration exactly once.\n\n<<<50>>>"
