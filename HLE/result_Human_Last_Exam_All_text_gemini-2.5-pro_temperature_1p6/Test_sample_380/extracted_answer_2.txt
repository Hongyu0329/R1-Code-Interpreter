No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered to be radial due to the Parker Spiral structure of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF).

The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (e.g., Y and Z components in a GSE-like coordinate system) to calculate helicity is that it is a **practical approximation that is only valid under the specific condition that the local magnetic field is, in fact, pointing nearly in the radial direction**. Studies using this method typically pre-select data intervals of "radial IMF", where the angle between the IMF and the radial line is very small. In these specific cases, the measurement coordinate system (GSE) closely approximates the physically ideal Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system, thus validating the simplified calculation. If the IMF is not radial, this method is geometrically incorrect, and a coordinate rotation into a proper FAC system would be required for an accurate result.
