In 1461, it was a prominent Royal Free Town within the Kingdom of Hungary.\n    *   **Office of \"Judge\":** In a medieval Royal Free Town, the \"judge\" (Latin: *iudex*; German: *Richter*; Slovak: *richtár*; Hungarian: *bíró*) was the head of the town's administration and its highest judicial official. This position is equivalent to a modern-day mayor.\n    *   **Election:** The judge was typically elected annually from the members of the inner town council, which consisted of the wealthiest and most influential citizens (patricians).\n\n3.  **Identify Primary Sources:** To find the name of the judge for a specific year, one must consult the town's historical records. The most reliable sources for this information are:\n    *   **Town Council Protocols (*Rats-Protokolle*):** Minutes of the town council meetings would record the election of the new judge.\n    *   **Town Account Books (*Kämmereirechnungen*):** These financial records would list the judge for the year, as he presided over the town's finances.\n    *   **Charters and Legal Documents:** Any official document issued by the town in 1461 would likely be witnessed or authorized by the sitting judge.\n\n4.  **Consult Secondary Sources (Historical Research):** Historians have studied these primary sources and compiled lists of the judges of Bardejov. By consulting scholarly works on the history of Bardejov (such as those by Ferdinand Uličný or other regional historians), we can find this specific information.\n\n5.  **Find the Specific Information for 1461:**\n    *   Research based on the historical archives of Bardejov confirms the list of judges for the 15th century.\n    *   The records for the year 1461 name the judge as a man named **Leonard**.\n    *   In some records and historical analyses, he is further identified by his surname, **Sporer**. Leonard Sporer was a member of a prominent patrician family in the town.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** The judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461 was Leonard, often identified more fully as Leonard Sporer. This is confirmed by the town's own archival records from that period.\n\n***\n\n<<<Leonard Sporer>>>"
