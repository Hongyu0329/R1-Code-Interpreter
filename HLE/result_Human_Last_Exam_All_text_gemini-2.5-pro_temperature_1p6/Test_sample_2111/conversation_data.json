    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures:** The question involves two main figures: Fernand Braudel, the historian quoting, and Paul Morand, the author of the original assertion. Braudel is known for his emphasis on *la longue durée* (long-term history) and global, interconnected systems, which provides the context for why he would find Morand's idea appealing.\n2.  **Locate the Source:** The quotation can be found in the preface to Fernand Braudel's monumental work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th–18th Century*, specifically in Volume III, *The Perspective of the World*.\n3.  **Analyze the Quote's Structure:** The question asks to identify a \"conceptual entity.\" It notes that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This means the nation is an example, not the entity itself. The core of the question is to find what this entity is.\n4.  **Examine the Exact Wording:** Braudel, endorsing Morand's view, writes (in the English translation by Siân Reynolds): \"I agree entirely with Paul Morand's view that '**the present**, that powerful and tyrannical ruler, the symbol of a nation, a society, a civilization, must be inscribed upon a sphere'.\"\n5.  **Isolate the Entity:** Based on the direct quotation, the \"conceptual entity\" that must be inscribed upon a sphere is **\"the present\"**.\n6.  **Understand the Metaphor:** The quote explains how \"the present\" is a powerful force, often perceived through the narrow lens of one's own nation, society, or civilization. Morand's and Braudel's point is that to truly understand the present (and its symbols like the nation), one cannot view it in isolation. It must be \"inscribed upon a sphere\"—that is, placed in its proper global context, showing its relationship to all other points on the globe simultaneously. This is a rejection of a linear, flat, or nation-centric view of history in favor of a holistic, global one.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the entity itself and the example given. The question clearly states that the \"symbol of a nation\" is an *example* of the entity.\n*   The source of the assertion is Paul Morand, but it is popularized and used as a methodological principle by Fernand Braudel, a more prominent figure in historiography.\n*   The \"sphere\" is a metaphor for the globe or the world system, emphasizing interconnectedness over isolation or simple linear progression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the precise wording of the quote as cited by Fernand Braudel, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within a sphere is explicitly named.\n\n<<<the present>>>"
