    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Film:** The question specifies the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky version of *Solaris*. This is crucial because there is also a novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem and a 2002 film remake, which have different dialogue and character nuances.\n*   **Action/Emotion:** The character in question feels a specific combination of emotions: they \"miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth\" and are \"ashamed\" to admit this feeling.\n*   **Task:** Identify which of the listed characters expresses this sentiment.\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n*   **Character Personalities:** It's important to consider the distinct personalities of the characters on the space station.\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the station. He is deeply connected to his past and Earth, as shown in the film's opening sequence, but his primary struggle is with the reappearance of his dead wife, Hari.\n    *   **Hari:** A \"visitor\" or \"guest\" created by the Solaris ocean based on Kris's memories. She has no genuine memories of Earth and exists only in relation to Kris.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist who has been on the station for a long time. He is world-weary, cynical, and philosophical, often reflecting on the nature of humanity and their place in the cosmos.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius:** A biologist who is cold, rational, and obsessed with a purely scientific approach to the Solaris phenomenon. He sees emotion as a weakness.\n    *   **Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who has already committed suicide when Kris arrives. We only see him in a pre-recorded message where he is desperate and distraught.\n*   **Thematic Relevance:** The quote ties directly into one of the film's central themes: humanity's loss of connection to nature and to itself in the pursuit of cold, scientific exploration. The character who says this would likely be someone who has spent a long time in the sterile environment of space and has had time to reflect on this loss.\n*   **Source of the Quote:** The answer must be based on specific dialogue from the 1972 film.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n1.  **Eliminate Hari:** Hari cannot miss something she has never truly experienced. Her existence and memories are entirely derived from Kris. This makes her the least likely candidate.\n2.  **Eliminate Sartorius:** Dr. Sartorius is the most detached and \"inhuman\" of the scientists. He is contemptuous of human sentimentality and would be the last person to admit to missing something as poetic as rustling leaves, let alone feel shame about it. He would view such a feeling as unscientific and irrelevant.\n3.  **Eliminate Gibarian:** We only encounter Gibarian through his frantic and despairing final video message. His focus is on the horror of the situation and a warning to Kris, not on nostalgic reflections about Earth.\n4.  **Consider Kris Kelvin:** Kris clearly has a strong connection to Earth, as established in the film's long opening sequence at his father's dacha. He certainly misses Earth. However, the specific phrasing of being \"ashamed\" to miss it points to someone who has perhaps tried to suppress these feelings for a long time as part of a scientific mindset.\n5.  **Analyze Dr. Snaut:** Dr. Snaut fits the profile perfectly. He has been isolated in space for years, wrestling with the philosophical implications of their mission. He often serves as the film's philosophical voice. In a conversation with Kris, Snaut delivers a famous monologue about how humanity doesn't want new worlds, but a mirror for itself. It is during this conversation that he confesses his own nostalgia, stating explicitly that he is ashamed to admit he misses the simple, earthly sound of rustling leaves. This admission highlights his vulnerability and the toll that their mission has taken on his sense of humanity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe character who expresses shame at missing the sound of rustling leaves is Dr. Snaut. It is a key moment that encapsulates his weariness and the film's critique of humanity's disconnection from its own nature.\n\n<<<C>>>"
