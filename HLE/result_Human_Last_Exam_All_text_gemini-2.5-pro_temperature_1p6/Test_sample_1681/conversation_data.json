    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the equilibrium point for the quantum Prisoner's Dilemma with the given payoff matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Classical Prisoner's Dilemma\n\nThe provided payoff matrix is:\n```\n          Player B\n         Cooperate |  Defect\n       +-----------+---------+\nCo-op  |  (5, 5)   |  (0, 7) | Player A\nDefect |  (7, 0)   |  (1, 1) |\n       +-----------+---------+\n```\nThis maps to the standard formulation with:\n*   Reward (R) = 5\n*   Sucker (S) = 0\n*   Temptation (T) = 7\n*   Punishment (P) = 1\n\nIn the classical version, \"Defect\" is the dominant strategy for both players. If Player B cooperates, Player A gets a better payoff by defecting (7 vs. 5). If Player B defects, Player A still gets a better payoff by defecting (1 vs. 0). The same logic applies to Player B. This leads to a single Nash Equilibrium at (Defect, Defect), with a payoff of (1, 1), even though the (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome of (5, 5) is better for both.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Quantum Game Framework (EWL Protocol)\n\nThe question asks us to design an optimal initial state and find the equilibrium. The standard approach for resolving the Prisoner's Dilemma uses the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol with a maximally entangled initial state.\n\n1.  **Initial State:** A referee prepares a maximally entangled 2-qubit state. Let $|C\\rangle = |0\\rangle$ and $|D\\rangle = |1\\rangle$. The initial state is given by $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = J|00\\rangle$, where $J$ is an entangling operator. For maximal entanglement, we use $J = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(I \\otimes I + i\\sigma_x \\otimes \\sigma_x)$, which produces the state $|\\psi_{in}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(|00\\rangle + i|11\\rangle)$.\n\n2.  **Player Strategies:** Each player chooses a local unitary operator (a quantum gate) from SU(2) to apply to their qubit. A general strategy can be parameterized by two angles, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ and $\\phi \\in [0, \\pi/2]$. A common choice of operator is $U(\\theta, \\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\phi}\\cos(\\theta/2) & i\\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\ i\\sin(\\theta/2) & e^{-i\\phi}\\cos(\\theta/2) \\end{pmatrix}$. The classical strategies are embedded in this space:\n    *   Cooperate $(\\hat{C}) = U(0, 0) = I$ (Identity matrix)\n    *   Defect $(\\hat{D}) = U(\\pi, 0) = i\\sigma_x$ (Pauli-X matrix, up to a phase)\n\n3.  **Final State & Measurement:** After players A and B apply their chosen operators $U_A$ and $U_B$, the state becomes $|\\psi'\\rangle = (U_A \\otimes U_B)|\\psi_{in}\\rangle$. To complete the protocol, a disentangling gate $J^\\dagger$ is applied, making the final state $|\\psi_f\\rangle = J^\\dagger |\\psi'\\rangle$. This final state is then measured in the computational basis ({|00>, |01>, |10>, |11>}), and the expected payoffs are calculated from the probabilities of these outcomes.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Payoff Functions\n\nThe expected payoffs for Player A ($P_A$) and Player B ($P_B$) can be derived as functions of their chosen strategies $(\\theta_A, \\phi_A)$ and $(\\theta_B, \\phi_B)$. While the full derivation is lengthy, it is a standard result in the field. Using the parameterization $\\cos(\\theta)$ simplifies the analysis. Let $c_k = \\cos(\\theta_k)$. The derived payoff functions for this protocol are:\n\n$P_A = \\frac{1}{4} [ (R+S+T+P) + (R-S-T+P)c_A + (R+S-T-P)c_B + (R-S+T-P)c_Ac_B ]$\n$P_B = \\frac{1}{4} [ (R+S+T+P) + (R+S-T-P)c_A + (R-S-T+P)c_B + (R-S+T-P)c_Ac_B ]$\n\nNote: We assume for simplicity that players only vary $\\theta$, keeping $\\phi=0$. The general result with $\\phi$ does not change the equilibrium for this specific problem.\n\nPlugging in the values R=5, S=0, T=7, P=1:\n*   $R+S+T+P = 13$\n*   $R-S-T+P = 5-0-7+1 = -1$\n*   $R+S-T-P = 5+0-7-1 = -3$\n*   $R-S+T-P = 5-0+7-1 = 11$\n\nThis gives the payoff functions:\n$P_A(c_A, c_B) = \\frac{1}{4} [ 13 - c_A - 3c_B + 11c_Ac_B ]$\n$P_B(c_A, c_B) = \\frac{1}{4} [ 13 - 3c_A - c_B + 11c_Ac_B ]$\n\n### Step 4: Analyze for Nash Equilibrium\n\nA Nash Equilibrium is a pair of strategies where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their own strategy. We can find the optimal strategy for each player by taking the derivative of their payoff function with respect to their own strategy variable.\n\n**Player A's optimal strategy:**\nPlayer A wants to maximize $P_A$. We analyze the derivative with respect to $c_A$:\n$\\frac{\\partial P_A}{\\partial c_A} = \\frac{1}{4} [-1 + 11c_B]$\nTo find Player A's best response to Player B's strategy $c_B$:\n*   If $\\frac{\\partial P_A}{\\partial c_A} > 0$ (i.e., $-1 + 11c_B > 0$, or $c_B > 1/11$), Player A should choose the maximum possible value for $c_A$, which is $c_A=1$ (Cooperate).\n*   If $\\frac{\\partial P_A}{\\partial c_A} < 0$ (i.e., $c_B < 1/11$), Player A should choose the minimum possible value for $c_A$, which is $c_A=-1$ (Defect).\n\n**Player B's optimal strategy:**\nSimilarly, for Player B, we analyze the derivative with respect to $c_B$:\n$\\frac{\\partial P_B}{\\partial c_B} = \\frac{1}{4} [-1 + 11c_A]$\n*   If $c_A > 1/11$, Player B should choose $c_B=1$ (Cooperate).\n*   If $c_A < 1/11$, Player B should choose $c_B=-1$ (Defect).\n\n**Finding the intersection of best responses (The Equilibrium):**\n1.  Assume the equilibrium is (C, C), which means $(c_A=1, c_B=1)$. Is this stable? Since $c_A=1 > 1/11$, B's best response is indeed $c_B=1$. And since $c_B=1 > 1/11$, A's best response is indeed $c_A=1$. So, **(Cooperate, Cooperate) is a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n2.  Assume the equilibrium is (D, D), which means $(c_A=-1, c_B=-1)$. Is this stable? Since $c_A=-1 < 1/11$, B's best response is $c_B=-1$. And since $c_B=-1 < 1/11$, A's best response is $c_A=-1$. So, **(Defect, Defect) is also a Nash Equilibrium.**\n\n3.  Assume the equilibrium is (C, D), so $(c_A=1, c_B=-1)$. Is this stable? A is playing C. B's best response to $c_A=1 (>1/11)$ is $c_B=1$. But B is playing $c_B=-1$. So B would want to switch. This is not a NE. By symmetry, (D,C) is also not a NE.\n\nWe have found two equilibria: (C,C) and (D,D).\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Final Equilibrium Point and Payoff\n\nWe have two Nash Equilibria. However, the game has been transformed. Let's look at the payoffs at these equilibria.\n\n*   At (C, C), with $(c_A=1, c_B=1)$:\n    $P_A = P_B = \\frac{1}{4}[13 - 1 - 3 + 11] = \\frac{20}{4} = 5$.\n    The payoff is (5, 5).\n\n*   At (D, D), with $(c_A=-1, c_B=-1)$:\n    $P_A = P_B = \\frac{1}{4}[13 - (-1) - 3(-1) + 11(-1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{4}[13 + 1 + 3 + 11] = \\frac{28}{4} = 7$.\n    The payoff is (7, 7).\n\nThis is a surprising result. In this quantum game, both players defecting leads to a payoff of (7,7), which is the temptation payoff for both. Cooperating yields (5,5). Since both are equilibria, rational players would aim for the one with the higher payoff. The dilemma is resolved, as rational players will choose to play the strategy pair (Defect, Defect) and receive a payoff of (7, 7), which is superior to the classical cooperation outcome of (5, 5).\n\nThe equilibrium point is therefore the strategy profile (Defect, Defect), yielding a payoff of (7,7) for each player.\n\nFinal Answer: The equilibrium point in this quantum game corresponds to both players choosing the \"Defect\" strategy, resulting in a payoff of (7, 7).\n\n<<< (7, 7) >>>"
