    "This is an interesting question in counterfactual historical linguistics. To determine what the word for \"sister\" might have been, we need to trace the native Old English word's likely development without the influence of Old Norse.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Words in Question**\n\n*   **Modern English:** The current word is \"sister\".\n*   **Old English (Anglo-Saxon):** The native word for sister was *sweostor*.\n*   **Old Norse:** The word used by the Norse invaders was *systir*.\n\nIt is immediately clear that our modern \"sister\" is derived from, or at least heavily influenced by, the Old Norse *systir*, not the Old English *sweostor*. The Norse form replaced the native Anglo-Saxon term, a common occurrence in the Danelaw (the area of England under Viking control).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Sound Changes from Old English to Middle English (without Norse influence)**\n\nWithout the influence of *systir*, the word *sweostor* would have undergone the natural sound changes that occurred in the English language. We can look at what happened to this word in dialects with less Norse contact (like in the South and West of England).\n\n*   **Initial consonant cluster `sw-`:** The `w` sound was often lost before a rounded back vowel (like /u/ or /o/). For example, Old English *swā* became \"so\", and *sweord* became \"sword\".\n*   **Vowel `eo`:** The Old English short diphthong `eo` typically became `u` in many Middle English dialects (especially southwestern). For example, *eorþe* (earth) sometimes appeared as *urthe*.\n*   **Medial vowel loss:** The unstressed vowel `o` in the middle of *sweostor* would likely have been lost.\n*   **Ending `-or`:** The unstressed ending `-or` commonly weakened to `-er` in Middle English, as seen in words like *brōþor* -> \"brother\" and *mōdor* -> \"mother\".\n\nApplying these changes to **sweostor**:\n1.  *sweostor* -> *swuster* (the `eo` becomes `u`, and the medial `o` is lost).\n2.  *swuster* -> *suster* (the `w` is lost before the back vowel `u`).\n\nThis process gives us the Middle English form **suster**. Indeed, this form was common in the southern and western dialects of Middle English, precisely where Norse influence was weakest.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Sound Changes from Middle English to Modern English**\n\nNow we must project the Middle English form *suster* forward into Modern English.\n\n*   The key change here is what happened to the short `u` vowel (pronounced like the \"u\" in \"put\"). During and after the Great Vowel Shift, this sound in a stressed syllable generally became the /ʌ/ vowel (the \"uh\" sound in \"cup\" or \"strut\").\n*   This is known as the \"strut-split\". We can see this in many words: Middle English *cutten* -> Modern \"cut\", ME *sumer* -> Modern \"summer\".\n*   Therefore, the pronunciation of *suster* would have changed from /ˈsʊstər/ to /ˈsʌstər/.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Final Spelling and Word**\n\nThe spelling would likely have remained **suster**. English spelling is conservative and often reflects Middle English pronunciation. The word would be pronounced to rhyme with \"duster\" or \"muster\".\n\n**List of Careful Points:**\n\n1.  **Counterfactual Nature:** This is a projection. While based on established phonological rules and historical evidence from dialects, it's impossible to be 100% certain, as language change can be unpredictable.\n2.  **Lexical Replacement:** The question hinges on the fact that \"sister\" is a case of lexical borrowing or replacement, where the Old Norse term won out over the native Old English one.\n3.  **Dialectal Evidence:** The existence of the form *suster* in non-Norse-influenced Middle English dialects is the strongest piece of evidence supporting this conclusion.\n4.  **Phonological Rules:** The answer is derived by applying the regular, known sound changes that occurred as English evolved, such as the reduction of the `sw-` cluster and the shift of the short `u` vowel.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFollowing the natural linguistic development of the original Old English word *sweostor* without the intervention of Old Norse *systir*, the word would have evolved through the Middle English form *suster*. Its modern pronunciation would be /ˈsʌstər/, and its spelling would most likely be \"suster\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
