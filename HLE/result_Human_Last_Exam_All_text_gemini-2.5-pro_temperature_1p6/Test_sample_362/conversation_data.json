    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants:**\n    *   **Reactant 1 (Carbonyl Compound): Pivalaldehyde.**\n        *   The common name \"pivalaldehyde\" refers to 2,2-dimethylpropanal.\n        *   Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO. It's an aldehyde with a bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon.\n        *   Structure:\n            ```\n                  O\n                 //\n            (CH₃)₃C--C--H\n            ```\n    *   **Reactant 2 (Wittig Reagent): (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane.**\n        *   This is a phosphorus ylide. `Triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane` refers to the PPh₃ group bonded to a carbanion, forming the ylide P=C double bond.\n        *   The name `(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)` describes the carbon part attached to the phosphorus. Let's build this group:\n            *   `ethylidene`: A two-carbon group attached via a double bond from C1: =CH-CH₃.\n            *   `2-(2-chlorophenyl)`: A 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to C2 of the ethylidene unit.\n            *   So, the carbon group is `=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-Ph)`.\n        *   The full structure of the ylide is:\n            ```\n                           PPh₃\n                          //\n            (2-Cl-Ph)-CH₂--CH\n            ```\n            (where 2-Cl-Ph is a phenyl ring with a chlorine atom at position 2).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Wittig Reaction Mechanism:**\n    *   The Wittig reaction forms a new carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the C=O of a carbonyl compound with the C=P of an ylide.\n    *   The overall transformation is: R¹R²C=O + R³R⁴C=PPh₃ → R¹R²C=CR³R⁴ + O=PPh₃ (triphenylphosphine oxide).\n    *   In this specific case:\n        *   From pivalaldehyde, the part that remains is `(CH₃)₃C-CH=`.\n        *   From the ylide, the part that remains is `=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-Ph)`.\n    *   Connecting these two pieces gives the alkene product skeleton:\n        `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-Ph)`.\n\n3.  **Determine the Stereochemistry of the Product:**\n    *   The stereochemistry (Z/E or cis/trans) of the resulting alkene depends on the nature of the ylide.\n    *   **Classification of the ylide:** The ylidic carbon (the one bonded to phosphorus) is attached to a hydrogen atom and an alkyl-type group (`-CH₂(2-Cl-Ph)`). There are no electron-withdrawing groups (like -C=O, -CN, -SO₂R) directly attached to the ylidic carbon to delocalize the negative charge. Therefore, this is a **non-stabilized ylide**.\n    *   **Stereochemical Rule:** Wittig reactions with non-stabilized ylides predominantly form the **Z-alkene** (cis isomer). This is because the initial cycloaddition to form the oxaphosphetane intermediate is kinetically controlled and irreversible, favoring the pathway that leads to the Z-product.\n    *   **Assigning Z/E Configuration:**\n        *   We need to determine the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog (CIP) priorities of the groups on each carbon of the new double bond: `C(a)=C(b)`.\n        *   On carbon `(a)` (from pivalaldehyde): The groups are `H` and tert-butyl `(-C(CH₃)₃)`. Priority: `-C(CH₃)₃` > `H`.\n        *   On carbon `(b)` (from the ylide): The groups are `H` and 2-chlorobenzyl `(-CH₂(2-Cl-Ph))`. Priority: `-CH₂(2-Cl-Ph)` > `H`.\n        *   For the **Z-isomer** (from German *zusammen*, meaning \"together\"), the two higher-priority groups must be on the same side of the double bond.\n        *   Therefore, the major product will have the tert-butyl group and the 2-chlorobenzyl group on the same side of the C=C double bond.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product Structure and Name:**\n    *   **Structure:** The Z-isomer is formed.\n        ```\n             (CH₃)₃C         CH₂-(Ph-2-Cl)\n                  \\         /\n                   C = C\n                  /     \\\n                 H       H\n        ```\n    *   **IUPAC Name:**\n        *   Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond:\n            `(2-Cl-Ph)-CH₂(1)-CH(2)=CH(3)-C(4)(CH₃)₂-CH₃(5)`\n        *   This is a 5-carbon chain, so it's a pentene.\n        *   Numbering from the right gives the double bond a higher number (3), so we number from the left, starting with the CH₂ attached to the ring. The double bond starts at C2. The name is **pent-2-ene**.\n        *   Identify the substituents: a `2-chlorophenyl` group on C1 and two `methyl` groups on C4.\n        *   Putting it together with the stereochemistry: **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly interpreting the IUPAC name of the complex Wittig reagent is crucial.\n*   Identifying the ylide as non-stabilized is the key to predicting the stereochemical outcome.\n*   Remembering that non-stabilized ylides yield Z-alkenes is the central concept for this problem.\n*   Correctly assigning CIP priorities to determine the structure corresponding to the Z-configuration.\n*   Following standard IUPAC rules for naming the final alkene product.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe reaction is a Wittig olefination between pivalaldehyde and a non-stabilized phosphorus ylide. Non-stabilized ylides preferentially form Z-alkenes. The product is therefore (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
