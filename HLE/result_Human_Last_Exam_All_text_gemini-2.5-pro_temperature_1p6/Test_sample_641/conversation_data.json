    "An involution in a group G is an element `x` of order 2, i.e., `x^2 = 1` and `x ≠ 1`. We want to find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group `G = PSU(4, 997)`. Note that the notation `PSU(n,q)` usually means `PSU(n, q^2)`. So the group is `PSU(4, 997^2)`.\n\nLet `S = SU(4, q^2)` be the special unitary group, where `q = 997`. The group `PSU(4, q^2)` is the quotient `S/Z`, where `Z = Z(S)` is the center of `S`.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of PSU(4, q^2) and its involutions.**\nAn element `gZ` in `PSU(4, q^2)` is an involution if and only if `(gZ)^2 = Z` (the identity element in the quotient group) and `gZ ≠ Z`.\nThis translates to `g^2 ∈ Z` and `g notin Z`.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the center Z of SU(4, q^2).**\nThe center of `SU(n, q^2)` consists of scalar matrices `λI` such that `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. The order of the center is `gcd(n, q+1)`.\nFor our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. We have `q+1 = 998`.\nThe order of the center is `gcd(4, 998) = gcd(2^2, 2 * 499) = 2`.\nThus, the center `Z` consists of two elements: `I` (the identity matrix) and `-I`. So, `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n**Step 3: Count the preimages of involutions in SU(4, q^2).**\nWe need to count the number of elements `g ∈ SU(4, q^2)` such that `g ∉ {I, -I}` and `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}`. This search splits into two cases:\nCase A: `g^2 = I` (involutions in `SU`)\nCase B: `g^2 = -I` (quasi-involutions in `SU`)\n\n**Step 4: Case A: Count involutions in SU(4, q^2) (where g^2 = I, g ∉ {I, -I}).**\nAn element `g` in `SU(4, q^2)` satisfying `g^2=I` must be diagonalizable with eigenvalues `±1`. Since `g ∈ SU(4, q^2)`, its determinant must be 1. This implies that the number of `-1` eigenvalues must be even. Let this number be `k`.\nThe possible values for `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n*   `k=0`: `g` has all eigenvalues equal to 1, so `g=I`. This is in the center.\n*   `k=4`: `g` has all eigenvalues equal to -1, so `g=-I`. This is also in the center. `(-I)^2=I`.\n*   `k=2`: `g` has eigenvalues `{1, 1, -1, -1}`. Such `g` are not scalar matrices, so they are not in the center `Z`.\nWe need to count the number of such matrices. These form a single conjugacy class in `U(4, q^2)`. The number of such elements is given by the size of this conjugacy class:\n`N_2 = |U(4, q^2)| / |C_{U(4,q^2)}(g)|`\nThe centralizer `C_{U(4,q^2)}(g)` is isomorphic to `U(2, q^2) × U(2, q^2)`.\n`N_2 = |U(4, q^2)| / |U(2, q^2)|^2`.\nUsing the formula `|U(n, q^2)| = q^{n(n-1)/2} \\prod_{i=1 to n} (q^i - (-1)^i)`:\n`|U(4, q^2)| = q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n`|U(2, q^2)| = q (q+1)(q^2-1)`\n`N_2 = [q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q (q+1)(q^2-1)]^2 = q^4 (q^3+1)(q^4-1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1))`\n`N_2 = q^4 (q+1)(q^2-q+1)(q^2-1)(q^2+1) / ((q+1)(q^2-1)) = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n\n**Step 5: Case B: Count quasi-involutions in SU(4, q^2) (where g^2 = -I).**\nFor `g^2 = -I` to have solutions, `-1` must be a square in `GF(q^2)`, which is always true. For the classification we are using, it's relevant that `-1` is a square in `GF(q)`. The Legendre symbol `(-1/997) = (-1)^{(997-1)/2} = (-1)^498 = 1`, so `i = \\sqrt{-1}` exists in `GF(997)`.\nThe eigenvalues of `g` are `±i`. Since `g` is in `SU(4,q^2)`, its determinant must be 1. This means if there are `k` eigenvalues of `i` and `4-k` eigenvalues of `-i`, then `det(g) = i^k (-i)^{4-k} = 1`. This forces `k` to be even. Here, `k` must be 2.\nSo `g` has eigenvalues `{i, i, -i, -i}`. Such `g` cannot be `I` or `-I`, so they are not in the center.\nThe quasi-involutions in `U(4, q^2)` form a single conjugacy class. Their number is:\n`N_{qi} = |U(4, q^2)| / |C_{U(4,q^2)}(g)|`.\nThe centralizer is isomorphic to the symplectic group `Sp(4, q)`.\n`N_{qi} = |U(4, q^2)| / |Sp(4, q)|`.\nUsing `|Sp(4, q)| = q^4(q^2-1)(q^4-1)`:\n`N_{qi} = [q^6 (q+1)(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)] / [q^4(q^2-1)(q^4-1)] = q^2(q+1)(q^3+1)`.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of involutions.**\nThe set of preimages of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` consists of the `N_2` involutions from Case A and the `N_{qi}` quasi-involutions from Case B.\nTotal number of preimages = `N_2 + N_{qi}`.\nEach involution `gZ` in `PSU(4, q^2)` corresponds to a coset `{g, -g}` of 2 elements in `SU(4, q^2)`. Therefore, the number of involutions in `PSU(4, q^2)` is the number of preimages divided by the size of the center, `|Z|=2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(N_2 + N_{qi}) / 2`.\nNumber of involutions = `(q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^2(q+1)(q^3+1)) / 2`.\nLet's simplify this expression:\n`N_2 + N_{qi} = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^2(q+1)^2(q^2-q+1)`\n`= q^2(q^2-q+1) [q^2(q^2+1) + (q+1)^2]`\n`= q^2(q^2-q+1) [q^4+q^2 + q^2+2q+1]`\n`= q^2(q^2-q+1) (q^4+2q^2+2q+1)`\nLet's expand `(q^2-q+1) (q^4+2q^2+2q+1)`:\n`= q^2(q^4+2q^2+2q+1) - q(q^4+2q^2+2q+1) + (q^4+2q^2+2q+1)`\n`= (q^6+2q^4+2q^3+q^2) - (q^5+2q^3+2q^2+q) + (q^4+2q^2+2q+1)`\n`= q^6 - q^5 + (2+1)q^4 + (2-2)q^3 + (1-2+2)q^2 + (-1+2)q + 1`\n`= q^6 - q^5 + 3q^4 + q^2 + q + 1`\nSo, the total number of involutions is `(q^2 / 2) * (q^6 - q^5 + 3q^4 + q^2 + q + 1)`.\nIn its fully expanded form, this is:\n`(q^8 - q^7 + 3q^6 + q^4 + q^3 + q^2) / 2`.\n\n**Step 7: Substitute q = 997.**\nThe question asks for the number of involutions, which is the value of the derived formula for `q=997`.\nThe number is `(997^8 - 997^7 + 3*997^6 + 997^4 + 997^3 + 997^2) / 2`.\nCalculating this huge number is not practical. The result is typically expected in the form of this polynomial in `q`.\n\nThe number of involutions in PSU(4,997) is given by the formula:\n`(q^8 - q^7 + 3q^6 + q^4 + q^3 + q^2) / 2`, where `q=997`.\n\n<<< (997^8 - 997^7 + 3*997^6 + 997^4 + 997^3 + 997^2) / 2 >>>"
