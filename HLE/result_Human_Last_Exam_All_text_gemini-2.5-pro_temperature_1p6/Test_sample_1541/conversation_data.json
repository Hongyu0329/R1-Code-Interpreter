    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory used by its variables.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe problem asks us to take a string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+1+2+1\") and rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order to produce a new sum string (e.g., \"1+1+2+3\"). The key constraints are:\n1.  The numbers in the sum are only 1, 2, and 3.\n2.  The input string `s` is non-empty and has a maximum length of 1000 characters.\n3.  We need to find the solution that is the *most memory-efficient*.\n4.  The final answer should be `m`, the total memory in bytes consumed by the variables in that optimal program.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\nTo devise the most memory-efficient solution, we must consider the following points:\n\n1.  **Choice of Algorithm:** Since the numbers are limited to a small, fixed set {1, 2, 3}, a simple counting approach is far more efficient than a general-purpose sorting algorithm. We can count the occurrences of each number and then construct the output string. This avoids storing all the numbers in an array.\n2.  **Input Handling:** A naive approach would be to read the entire string into a character array, like `char s[1001]`. This would immediately consume over 1000 bytes. To be memory-efficient, we should process the input stream character by character without storing the whole string. The `getchar()` function in C is perfect for this.\n3.  **Variable Usage:** We should declare the absolute minimum number of variables required. Every variable, including loop counters and flags, consumes memory and should be scrutinized.\n4.  **Output Formatting:** Printing the `+` symbol correctly is crucial. The first number printed should not have a `+` before it, but all subsequent numbers should. This logic needs to be implemented efficiently.\n5.  **Data Type Sizes:** For the calculation of `m`, we must use standard memory sizes for C data types on typical competitive programming platforms:\n    *   `sizeof(char)` = 1 byte\n    *   `sizeof(int)` = 4 bytes\n\n### Step 3: Acquire the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nFollowing the careful points above, we can design the most memory-efficient program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n1.  **Algorithm: Counting Sort.** We will count the occurrences of '1', '2', and '3'. This requires three integer variables.\n    *   `int count1;` // For the count of 1s\n    *   `int count2;` // For the count of 2s\n    *   `int count3;` // For the count of 3s\n    *   **Memory for counters:** 3 * `sizeof(int)` = 3 * 4 = **12 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Input:** To avoid a large buffer, we read the input character by character until the end of the line. This requires one `char` variable.\n    *   `char c;` // To store the character being read\n    *   **Memory for input:** 1 * `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n3.  **Processing:** We can loop with `getchar()` to read characters into `c`. Inside the loop, an `if-else if` structure checks if `c` is '1', '2', or '3' and increments the corresponding counter. The '+' characters are simply ignored. This process requires no additional variables.\n\n4.  **Output:** After counting, we print the sorted sum. To do this with minimal memory, we can use a logic that avoids extra flag variables. Since the input is non-empty, at least one of the counters will be positive.\n    *   First, print the first term of the sum. This is done by checking `count1`, then `count2`, then `count3`, printing the first one that is available, and decrementing its counter. This requires no new variables.\n    *   Then, use three separate `while` loops to print the remaining `count1` ones, `count2` twos, and `count3` threes, each preceded by a `+` sign. This also requires no additional variables.\n\n5.  **Final Variable Tally:** The most memory-efficient program only needs variables to store the three counts and one character for input.\n    *   `count1` (int): 4 bytes\n    *   `count2` (int): 4 bytes\n    *   `count3` (int): 4 bytes\n    *   `c` (char): 1 byte\n\n6.  **Total Memory Calculation (m):**\n    *   m = (memory for `count1`) + (memory for `count2`) + (memory for `count3`) + (memory for `c`)\n    *   m = 4 + 4 + 4 + 1\n    *   m = 13 bytes\n\nThis approach is minimal; we cannot solve the problem without storing the counts of the numbers, and we need at least one variable to read the input stream.\n\n<<<13>>>"
