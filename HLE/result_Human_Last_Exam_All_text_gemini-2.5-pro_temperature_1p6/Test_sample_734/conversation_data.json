    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian based on a set of criteria. Let's break down these criteria:\n1.  **Who:** A Christian theologian. This excludes scientists, philosophers, or figures from other religions who did not primarily contribute to Christian theology.\n2.  **What:** Developed \"specialized terminology.\" This implies a unique conceptual framework or a specific set of terms, not just a general belief in miracles.\n3.  **How:** The terminology is used to describe \"changes in the laws of nature.\" This is a key point. It's not just about God acting *within* or *alongside* nature, but about the potential for the fundamental rules of the physical world to be altered or suspended.\n4.  **Application:** This framework must be applicable to two distinct theological events:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus.\n    *   The possible alteration of natural laws at the Fall of Man.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points and Key Concepts\n\n*   **Laws of Nature:** The regular, predictable patterns observed in the physical universe (e.g., biological reproduction requires a male and a female gamete; entropy leads to decay; gravity operates consistently). The theologian's concept must account for these laws being *changed*.\n*   **The Virgin Birth:** From a naturalistic perspective, this event violates the biological laws of human reproduction. The theologian's terminology must provide a coherent explanation for how this is possible.\n*   **The Fall:** Some theological interpretations of Genesis suggest that the original \"very good\" creation operated differently. The Fall didn't just affect humanity's spiritual state but also introduced physical changes to the natural world, such as death, decay, predation, and natural disasters. The theologian's system must be able to account for this kind of fundamental shift in the created order.\n*   **Specialized Terminology:** We are looking for something more specific than general terms like \"miracle\" or \"divine power.\" A term like Augustine's *rationes seminales* (seminal reasons) or the scholastic distinction between *potentia absoluta* and *potentia ordinata* are examples of specialized terminology. We need to find the theologian who *first developed* such a relevant framework.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Potential Candidates\n\n1.  **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD):** Augustine wrote extensively on creation, miracles, and the Fall. He argued that a miracle is not contrary to nature, but contrary to *what we know of nature*. For him, God has embedded potentialities (*rationes seminales*) in creation that can emerge at a later time. While this can explain novel events, it is framed more as the unfolding of a pre-existing plan within nature, rather than a *change* in its fundamental laws. His framework is foundational but may not be the specific one the question targets.\n\n2.  **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274 AD):** Aquinas, drawing on Aristotle, had a highly developed system of natural law. He famously used and refined the distinction between God's **absolute power (*potentia absoluta*)** and God's **ordained power (*potentia ordinata*)**. The ordained power is God's power as expressed through the consistent laws of nature He has established. The absolute power is what God *could* do in principle (anything not logically self-contradictory), including acting outside the ordained laws. This framework is perfectly suited to explain both the Virgin Birth and changes at the Fall. However, Aquinas was refining a discussion that had started earlier.\n\n3.  **Peter Damian (c. 1007-1073 AD):** This Italian cardinal and Doctor of the Church is a pivotal figure in this debate, writing before Aquinas. In his work, *De Divina Omnipotentia* (On Divine Omnipotence), he made a radical argument for God's power. He argued against philosophers who tried to limit God's power with logic (e.g., arguing God could not change the past). Damian insisted that God's omnipotence is not bound by the principle of non-contradiction or by the natural order He created.\n    *   **Application to the Virgin Birth:** For Damian, the biological law that a virgin cannot conceive is a rule established by God. God is not subject to this rule and can simply will it to be otherwise. This is a direct application of his concept of unconstrained divine power.\n    *   **Application to the Fall:** Damian's framework provides a powerful mechanism to explain changes in nature at the Fall. If the original creation was without death and decay, God, in His absolute power, could simply change the operating principles of nature as a consequence of sin.\n    *   **\"First Developed\":** Damian is the key theologian who *first* and most forcefully articulated this radical view of divine omnipotence being able to alter nature and even logic, setting the stage for the more systematic discussions by later scholastics like Aquinas. He is the originator of the specific line of thought that perfectly matches the question's criteria.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile figures like Augustine and Aquinas developed crucial theological frameworks, it was **Peter Damian** who first championed the specific, radical concept of divine omnipotence that allows for the alteration of nature's laws themselves. His work *De Divina Omnipotentia* provides the specialized theological reasoning applicable to both the singular miracle of the Virgin Birth and the systemic cosmic changes proposed to have occurred at the Fall.\n\n<<<Peter Damian>>>"
