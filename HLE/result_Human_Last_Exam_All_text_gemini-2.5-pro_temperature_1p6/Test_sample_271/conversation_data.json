    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Factor the polynomial**\nLet $P(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$. We look for ways to factor this polynomial. Notice that the coefficients suggest grouping terms:\n$P(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\nFactor out common terms from each group:\n$P(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nNow, factor out the common binomial $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$P(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the factors**\nThe roots of $P(x)$ are the roots of its factors, $Q(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $R(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\nThe splitting field $K$ of $P(x)$ is the smallest field containing the roots of both $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$. This means $K$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $Q(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    The roots are $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$. The splitting field of $Q(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_Q = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The degree of this extension is $[K_Q : \\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $R(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    1.  **Irreducibility:** We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The leading coefficient (1) is not divisible by 3. All other coefficients (0 for $x^4$, 0 for $x^3$, -9 for $x$, 3 for the constant term) are divisible by 3. The constant term (3) is not divisible by $3^2=9$. Therefore, $R(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    2.  **Galois Group:** Since $R(x)$ is irreducible of degree 5, its Galois group $G_R = \\text{Gal}(K_R/\\mathbb{Q})$ (where $K_R$ is the splitting field of $R(x)$) is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$. To determine which subgroup, we analyze the roots of $R(x)$.\n        *   Let's find the number of real roots using calculus. The derivative is $R'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x^4 = 9/5$, which gives two real solutions $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n        *   Evaluating $R(x)$ at these critical points, we find that $R(x)$ has one local maximum and one local minimum.\n            *   $R(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) > 0$\n            *   $R(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) < 0$\n        *   Since $R(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $R(x) \\to \\infty$ as $x \\to \\infty$, the function must cross the x-axis three times. So, $R(x)$ has 3 real roots and 2 complex conjugate roots.\n        *   A theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$. Here, $p=5$, and we have $5-2=3$ real roots. Thus, $G_R \\cong S_5$.\n    3.  **Degree of Extension:** The degree of the splitting field is the order of the Galois group: $[K_R : \\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 5! = 120$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Galois group of K over Q**\nThe splitting field $K$ is the compositum $K_Q K_R$. The Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ has an order given by:\n$[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = \\frac{[K_Q:\\mathbb{Q}][K_R:\\mathbb{Q}]}{[K_Q \\cap K_R : \\mathbb{Q}]} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 120}{[K_Q \\cap K_R : \\mathbb{Q}]}$.\nThe intersection $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_R$ must be a normal subfield of $K_Q$, so it is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nIf $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ must be a subfield of $K_R$. This means $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ would be a quadratic subfield of $K_R$. The quadratic subfields of a splitting field are of the form $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, where $\\Delta$ is the discriminant of the defining polynomial.\nThe discriminant of $R(x)=x^5-9x+3$ is $\\Delta = 81(-183499)$. The quadratic subfield of $K_R$ is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-183499})$. This is clearly not equal to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nTherefore, the intersection is trivial: $K_Q \\cap K_R = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n$G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_Q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_R/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G| = |C_2| \\cdot |S_5| = 2 \\cdot 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the degrees of intermediate normal extensions**\nWe are looking for normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these extensions $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of such an extension is given by $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\n\nWe need to find all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nNormal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ can be of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\vartriangleleft C_2$ and $N_2 \\vartriangleleft S_5$. They can also be \"skew\" subgroups because the composition factors of $C_2$ and $S_5$ are not disjoint (both have $C_2$ as a composition factor).\n\nThe list of normal subgroups $H$ of $C_2 \\times S_5$ is:\n1.  **Product subgroups:**\n    *   $H_1 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_1|=2$. $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$.\n    *   $H_2 = C_2 \\times A_5$: $|H_2|=2 \\cdot 60=120$. $[G:H_2] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    *   $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$: $|H_3|=60$. $[G:H_3] = 240/60 = 4$.\n    *   $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$: $|H_4|=120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$.\n    (Note: $\\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ and $C_2 \\times S_5$ are excluded as they correspond to $K$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ respectively).\n\n2.  **Skew subgroup:** There is one such subgroup. Let $c$ be the non-identity element of $C_2$. This subgroup is\n    $H_5 = \\{(e, \\sigma) | \\sigma \\in A_5\\} \\cup \\{(c, \\tau) | \\tau \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5\\}$.\n    The order is $|H_5| = |A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n    The index is $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$.\n\n**Step 5: List all possible degrees**\nThe degrees of the normal extensions $L$ are the indices $[G:H]$ we calculated.\n*   From $H_1=C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$, the degree is 120. (This corresponds to $L=K_R$).\n*   From $H_2=C_2 \\times A_5$, the degree is 2. (This corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$).\n*   From $H_3=\\{e\\} \\times A_5$, the degree is 4. (This corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{\\Delta})$).\n*   From $H_4=\\{e\\} \\times S_5$, the degree is 2. (This corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n*   From $H_5=N_{skew}$, the degree is 2. (This corresponds to $L=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\Delta})$).\n\nCollecting all the unique values for the degrees, we get the set $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
