    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe objective is to find the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two given 2x2 polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n**2. Definition of GCRD:**\nA polynomial matrix R(s) is a Greatest Common Right Divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) if:\na) R(s) is a right divisor of both P1(s) and P2(s). This means there exist polynomial matrices Q1(s) and Q2(s) such that P1(s) = Q1(s)R(s) and P2(s) = Q2(s)R(s).\nb) Any other common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is also a right divisor of R(s).\nThe GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\n**3. Method: The Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\nThe standard method to find the GCRD is analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers or polynomials. It involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed by P1(s) and P2(s) to reduce it to a simpler form. The non-zero rows of the final reduced matrix will form the GCRD.\n\nThe allowed elementary row operations are:\ni. Swapping two rows.\nii. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\niii. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**Step 1: Form the stacked matrix.**\nLet's stack the two matrices P1(s) and P2(s) to form a 4x2 matrix M(s).\nP1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nM(s) =\n[ [s^2 + s, -s]      (R1)\n  [-s^2 - 1, s^2]    (R2)\n  [s, 0]             (R3)\n  [-s - 1, 1] ]     (R4)\n\n**Step 2: Perform elementary row operations to reduce the matrix.**\nOur goal is to use row operations to introduce zero rows and simplify the matrix into a row-echelon form.\n\n*   **Operation 1:** Add `s` times Row 4 to Row 1 (R1 -> R1 + s*R4). This is a valid operation since `s` is a polynomial.\n    *   New Row 1 = `[s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    *   New Row 1 = `[s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s]`\n    *   New Row 1 = `[0, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M'(s) =\n    [ [0, 0]\n      [-s^2 - 1, s^2]    (R2)\n      [s, 0]             (R3)\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]     (R4)\n\n*   **Operation 2:** Now, let's eliminate the `s^2` term in the second column of Row 2 using Row 4. We perform R2 -> R2 - s^2*R4.\n    *   New Row 2 = `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1]`\n    *   New Row 2 = `[-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s - 1), s^2 - s^2]`\n    *   New Row 2 = `[-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0]`\n    *   New Row 2 = `[s^3 - 1, 0]`\n    The matrix becomes:\n    M''(s) =\n    [ [0, 0]\n      [s^3 - 1, 0]       (New R2)\n      [s, 0]             (R3)\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]     (R4)\n\n*   **Operation 3:** We have two rows with a zero in the second column: `[s^3 - 1, 0]` and `[s, 0]`. We can simplify these two rows by finding the GCD of the polynomials `s^3 - 1` and `s`. Using the polynomial division algorithm:\n    `s^3 - 1 = (s^2) * s - 1`\n    The remainder is -1, a non-zero constant. Thus, the GCD is 1. This implies that through row operations, we can obtain a row `[1, 0]`.\n    Specifically, `-1 * (New R2) + s^2 * (R3)` gives `-[s^3-1, 0] + s^2[s,0] = [-s^3+1+s^3, 0] = [1, 0]`.\n    So, the row space generated by `{New R2, R3}` is the same as the row space generated by `{[1, 0], [0, 0]}`. We can replace the rows `[s^3 - 1, 0]` and `[s, 0]` with `[1, 0]` and a zero row.\n    After removing zero rows and reordering, the matrix is equivalent to:\n    M'''(s) =\n    [ [1, 0]             (from New R2 and R3)\n      [-s - 1, 1] ]     (R4)\n\n*   **Operation 4:** We can simplify this matrix further. Let the current rows be `R_A = [1, 0]` and `R_B = [-s-1, 1]`. We perform R_B -> R_B + (s+1)*R_A.\n    *   New Row B = `[-s - 1, 1] + (s+1) * [1, 0]`\n    *   New Row B = `[-s - 1 + s + 1, 1 + 0]`\n    *   New Row B = `[0, 1]`\n    The set of rows `{[1, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}` has been transformed into `{[1, 0], [0, 1]}`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the GCRD.**\nThe row reduction process has terminated. The remaining non-zero rows form the GCRD in its row-echelon form.\nR(s) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]\n\nThis is the 2x2 identity matrix, I. When the GCRD is the identity matrix, the original matrices P1(s) and P2(s) are said to be right coprime.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe greatest common right divisor of P1(s) and P2(s) is the identity matrix.\n\n[[1, 0], [0, 1]]"
