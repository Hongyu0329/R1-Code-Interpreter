    "An analysis of the Hopf charge of the given vector field $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$ involves understanding its topological structure. The Hopf charge, an integer topological invariant, is the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the target sphere $S^2$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the vector field structure**\n\nThe vector field $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is defined as:\n$n_x = \\sin(G)\\cos(f)$\n$n_y = \\sin(G)\\sin(f)$\n$n_z = \\cos(G)$\nwhere $f$ and $G$ act as the azimuthal and polar angles on the target sphere $S^2$, respectively. They are functions of the spatial coordinates $(x,y,z)$.\n\n*   $f = \\text{atan2}(y,x)$: This is the standard azimuthal angle $\\phi$ in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, where $\\rho = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.\n*   $G = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2)$, where $r_2 = \\sqrt{(x^2+y^2-0.5)^2 + z^2}$.\n    *   Let $\\rho^2 = x^2+y^2$. Then $r_2 = \\sqrt{(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2}$. This represents the distance from a point $(x,y,z)$ to the circle defined by $\\rho^2=0.5$ and $z=0$.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of the field at special locations:\n1.  **At spatial infinity** ($|\\mathbf{x}| \\to \\infty$): $r_2 \\to \\infty$, so $G = \\pi \\exp(-\\infty) \\to 0$. The field becomes $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(0)\\cos(f), \\sin(0)\\sin(f), \\cos(0)) = (0,0,1)$. This is the \"North Pole\" of $S^2$. This means the field is well-behaved for considering $\\mathbb{R}^3$ as a compactified $S^3$.\n\n2.  **On the circle** $x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$: Here, $r_2 = 0$, so $G = \\pi \\exp(0) = \\pi$. The field becomes $\\mathbf{n} \\to (\\sin(\\pi)\\cos(f), \\sin(\\pi)\\sin(f), \\cos(\\pi)) = (0,0,-1)$. This is the \"South Pole\" of $S^2$.\n\nThis field configuration describes a \"toroidal hopfion\" or \"skyrmion of Hopf charge 1\". The vector field twists in such a way that it realizes a map equivalent to the Hopf fibration from $S^3$ to $S^2$. For the standard Hopf fibration, the Hopf charge is 1.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Hopf charge using the linking number of preimages**\n\nThe Hopf charge is defined as the linking number, $Q_H = Lk(\\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_1), \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_2))$, of the preimages of any two distinct regular values $p_1, p_2 \\in S^2$.\n\nLet's find the preimage of the South Pole, $p_S=(0,0,-1)$. This corresponds to $G=\\pi$. As found in Step 1, the preimage is the circle $C_S: x^2+y^2=0.5, z=0$. The poles are critical values of the map, but it is often instructive to consider their preimages. $C_S$ will serve as one of our curves.\n\nLet's choose a regular value, for instance, $p_1=(1,0,0)$ on the equator of $S^2$. Its preimage $C_1 = \\mathbf{n}^{-1}(p_1)$ is the set of points where $\\mathbf{n}=(1,0,0)$.\nThis requires:\n*   $\\cos(G) = 0 \\implies G=\\pi/2$.\n*   $\\cos(f)=1, \\sin(f)=0 \\implies f=0$.\n\nFrom $G=\\pi/2$, we get $\\pi/2 = \\pi \\exp(-10 r_2) \\implies 1/2 = \\exp(-10 r_2) \\implies r_2 = \\frac{\\ln 2}{10}$.\nThis gives the equation $(\\rho^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = (\\frac{\\ln 2}{10})^2$. This surface is a torus whose core is the circle $C_S$.\n\nFrom $f=0$, we get $\\text{atan2}(y,x)=0$, which implies $y=0$ and $x>0$.\n\nSo, the preimage $C_1$ is the curve defined by $(x^2-0.5)^2+z^2 = (\\frac{\\ln 2}{10})^2$ in the half-plane $y=0, x>0$. This is a closed loop, specifically a poloidal circle on the torus defined by $G=\\pi/2$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the linking number $Lk(C_1, C_S)$**\n\nTo compute the linking number of the loop $C_1$ and the circle $C_S$, we can use Gauss's linking integral definition. A simpler method is to count the signed intersections of one curve with a surface bounded by the other.\n\nLet $D_S$ be the disk in the $z=0$ plane bounded by $C_S$. Its equation is $x^2+y^2 \\le 0.5, z=0$. Let's orient $C_S$ counter-clockwise in the xy-plane, so the normal to $D_S$ is in the $+z$ direction.\n\nThe curve $C_1$ lies in the $y=0$ plane. We find where it intersects the plane of $D_S$ (the $z=0$ plane).\nSetting $z=0$ in the equation for $C_1$:\n$(x^2-0.5)^2 = (\\frac{\\ln 2}{10})^2 \\implies x^2-0.5 = \\pm \\frac{\\ln 2}{10}$.\n$x^2 = 0.5 \\pm \\frac{\\ln 2}{10}$.\nSince $C_1$ is in the region $x>0$, we have two intersection points with the $z=0$ plane:\n$P_+ = (\\sqrt{0.5 + \\frac{\\ln 2}{10}}, 0, 0)$\n$P_- = (\\sqrt{0.5 - \\frac{\\ln 2}{10}}, 0, 0)$\n\nNow we check if these points lie inside the disk $D_S$ (i.e., if $x^2+y^2 \\le 0.5$).\n*   For $P_+$: $x^2 = 0.5 + \\frac{\\ln 2}{10} > 0.5$. This point is outside the disk $D_S$.\n*   For $P_-$: $x^2 = 0.5 - \\frac{\\ln 2}{10} < 0.5$. This point is inside the disk $D_S$.\n\nThe curve $C_1$ pierces the surface $D_S$ exactly once. Therefore, the magnitude of the linking number is $|Lk(C_1, C_S)|=1$. The sign depends on the orientation of the curves, but the Hopf charge is typically taken to be the magnitude or is fixed by convention. The fundamental topological property is that the preimages are linked once.\n\nThis result aligns with the understanding that the given field represents the standard toroidal hopfion, which has a Hopf charge of 1. While the direct application of Whitehead's integral formula can be subtle due to gauge choices for multivalued functions, the geometric interpretation via linking numbers provides a clear path to the answer."
