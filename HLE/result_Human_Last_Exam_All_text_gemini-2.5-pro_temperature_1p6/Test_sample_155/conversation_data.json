    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to decode the word.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input structure**\nThe text is presented inside a `verbatim` environment, which means that all spaces and line breaks are preserved and should be treated as significant. The characters used are 't', 'b', and spaces. This strongly suggests the message is encoded visually, as a form of ASCII art, where the characters form larger shapes.\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruct the visual grid**\nTo see the hidden word, we need to combine all the lines into a single grid, respecting the exact positions of each character. The `verbatim` text aligns characters in a monospaced grid. The longest lines have 19 characters (e.g., `t b b t t t t b b b`), so we will use a grid of 13 rows (one for each line of text) and 19 columns. Any character ('t' or 'b') is treated as a filled pixel ('#'), and a space is an empty pixel ('.').\n\nHere is the grid constructed from the input:\n\n- **Row 1:** `t b b t t t t b b b`\n- **Row 2-6:** A single character in column 1 (`b`, `b`, `b`, `t`, `b`)\n- **Row 7:** `t b t t b b b b b b`\n- **Row 8-12:** A single character in column 19 (`b`, `b`, `t`, `t`, `b`)\n- **Row 13:** `b b t t t t b t b b`\n\nLet's visualize this on a 13x19 grid. We'll use '#' for any character and '.' for spaces:\n\n```\n      Column: 1234567890123456789\nRow 1 :         #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#\nRow 2 :         #..................\nRow 3 :         #..................\nRow 4 :         #..................\nRow 5 :         #..................\nRow 6 :         #..................\nRow 7 :         #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#\nRow 8 :         ..................#\nRow 9 :         ..................#\nRow 10:         ..................#\nRow 11:         ..................#\nRow 12:         ..................#\nRow 13:         #.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#.#\n```\nThe empty columns (2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) act as separators between the strokes of the letters. The larger empty space in the middle suggests a separation between letters.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the letters**\nBased on the spacing, we can segment the grid into three characters.\n\n*   **Letter 1 (Columns 1-5):**\n    - The `t`s and `b`s in columns 1, 3, and 5 form the shape.\n    - Column 1 has a nearly solid vertical line.\n    - Rows 1, 7, and 13 form three horizontal bars.\n    - The shape is clearly a capital **E**.\n    ```\n      # # #  (Row 1: t b b)\n      # . .  (Vertical stem)\n      # . .\n      # . .\n      # . .\n      # . .\n      # # #  (Row 7: t b t)\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      # # #  (Row 13: b b t)\n    ```\n\n*   **Letter 2 (Columns 7-13):**\n    - The characters are in columns 7, 9, 11, and 13.\n    - There are no vertical strokes from the single-character lines.\n    - The horizontal lines in rows 1, 7, and 13 form three bars.\n    - The shape formed is three parallel horizontal lines, which is the symbol for \"identical to\" or \"equivalent,\" also known as the triple bar `≡`.\n    ```\n      # # # #  (Row 1: t t t t)\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      # # # #  (Row 7: t b b b)\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      . . . .\n      # # # #  (Row 13: t t b b)\n    ```\n\n*   **Letter 3 (Columns 15-19):**\n    - This shape uses columns 15, 17, and 19.\n    - It has horizontal bars on rows 1, 7, and 13.\n    - It has a vertical component on the right side, in column 19, formed by the single characters from rows 8-12.\n    - This shape strongly resembles a capital **G**, with a top bar, a middle bar (the 'tick' of the G), a bottom curve, and a right vertical curve.\n    ```\n      # # #  (Row 1: b b b)\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      . . .\n      # # #  (Row 7: b b b)\n      . . #  (Vertical stem on right)\n      . . #\n      . . #\n      . . #\n      . . #\n      # # #  (Row 13: b t b)\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Interpret the word**\nThe identified shapes are **E**, **≡**, and **G**. This forms the pattern `E ≡ G`. The most common and logical English word that fits this pattern is **EGG**. The puzzle uses the visually ambiguous symbol `≡` to represent the second 'G'. This is a common trick in visual puzzles, where a letter is represented by a stylized or simplified form. In this case, a 'G' has been reduced to its core horizontal elements.\n\nThe word is EGG.\n\n<<<EGG>>>"
