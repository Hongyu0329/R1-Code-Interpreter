    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** An Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   **Pivotal Action:** A character says the words \"Thank you\".\n    *   **Setting:** This occurs while the character is boarding a bus.\n    *   **Consequence:** This act \"seals his fate,\" implying it leads to a negative, irreversible outcome like being discovered, captured, or killed.\n\n2.  **Initial Recall & Film Identification:**\n    *   The prompt describes a very specific type of spycraft or undercover mistake. A seemingly polite and innocuous phrase becomes a fatal giveaway because it's said in the wrong context or language.\n    *   This points towards a thriller or historical drama.\n    *   The film that features this exact scene is Steven Spielberg's **Munich** (2005).\n\n3.  **Verification of Key Points:**\n    *   **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes, *Munich* was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, and Best Original Score. This satisfies the primary condition.\n    *   **Who is the character?** The character is Robert (played by Mathieu Kassovitz), a Belgian toy-maker who is recruited as the team's explosives expert.\n    *   **What is the context of the scene?** The Mossad team is in Cyprus, tracking one of their targets, Zaiad Muchasi. Robert boards a public bus to confirm the target's identity.\n    *   **What is the mistake?** After successfully identifying the target, Robert exits the bus. Out of habit and politeness, he turns to the driver and says \"Thank you\" in English.\n    *   **Why does this \"seal his fate\"?** The target, who also knows English, overhears this. Since they are in a Greek-speaking country, an English \"Thank you\" immediately outs Robert as a foreigner. The target becomes suspicious, realizes he is being followed, and the operation is compromised. While Robert isn't killed in this exact moment, this critical error highlights the immense danger the team is in and directly leads to the failure of that specific assassination attempt. The event foreshadows the deadly consequences that befall the team, as Robert is later killed by a bomb meant for another target. His small slip-up is a powerful example of how their mission is doomed to unravel.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    The film is *Munich*. The scene perfectly matches all the details provided in the question: it's an Oscar-nominated film where a character's simple act of saying \"Thank you\" on a bus compromises a vital mission and demonstrates the perilous nature of his work, thus sealing his fate.\n\n<<<Munich>>>"
