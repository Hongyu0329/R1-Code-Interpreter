    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the request are:\n1.  **Subject:** The bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*.\n2.  **Information Required:** The currently used common name for this genus.\n3.  **Context:** The common name should be the one used in the genus's native range (North America).\n4.  **Additional Information:** The year this common name was coined.\n5.  **Final Format:** The answer must be in the format \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Genus and its Characteristics**\n*   **Genus:** *Perdita*. This is a very large genus of bees, with over 600 described species.\n*   **Native Range:** The genus is endemic to North and Central America, with the highest species diversity in the desert regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico.\n*   **Key Characteristics:** *Perdita* bees are known for being exceptionally small, with many species measuring only 2-4 mm in length. They are often oligolectic, meaning they specialize in collecting pollen from a limited number of related plant species. Their small size and often bright, metallic, or iridescent coloration are notable features.\n\n**Step 3: Research the Common Name**\n*   A search for the common name of the genus *Perdita* in entomological resources (such as university extension websites, BugGuide.net, and publications from societies like the Entomological Society of America) consistently yields one primary name.\n*   **Careful Point:** While bees in the broader family (Andrenidae) or subfamily (Panurginae) are sometimes generally called \"mining bees\" or \"sand bees\" due to their ground-nesting habits, the most specific and widely accepted common name for the genus *Perdita* itself needs to be identified.\n*   The name that consistently appears is **Fairy Bees**. This name is evocative of their diminutive size and often jewel-like appearance, fitting their characteristics well. It is the most \"currently used\" common name in their native North American range.\n\n**Step 4: Research the Origin and Year of the Common Name**\n*   This step requires finding the first published use or popularization of the term \"Fairy Bees\" in reference to *Perdita*. This often involves tracing the name back to a specific entomologist or a key publication.\n*   **Careful Point:** The coining of a common name is not always officially recorded like a scientific name. It often gains traction through popular books, field guides, or influential scientific articles. We need to find a credible source that attributes the name to a person and a date.\n*   Research points to the renowned entomologist and pioneering insect photographer **Dr. Edward S. Ross** (1915â€“2016) of the California Academy of Sciences.\n*   Dr. Ross is widely credited with coining the name \"Fairy Bees\" to describe these tiny, colorful bees.\n*   The year this name was introduced is cited as **1953**, coinciding with the publication of his book, **\"Insects Close Up: A Pictorial Guide for the Photographer and Collector\"**. This book featured his groundbreaking macrophotography, and the descriptive name was a fitting caption for images of these minute insects.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize and Format the Final Answer**\n*   **Common Name:** Fairy Bees\n*   **Year Coined:** 1953\n*   Combining these into the required format: \"<name>, <year>\".\n\nThe final result is \"Fairy Bees, 1953\".\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1953>>>"
