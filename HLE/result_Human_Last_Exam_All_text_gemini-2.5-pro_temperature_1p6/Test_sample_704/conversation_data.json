    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to find a musical note that corresponds to a specific color range on \"Newton's colour circle\". We need to break down the components:\n*   **Newton's colour circle:** This refers to the circular diagram Isaac Newton created to illustrate the relationship between colors and musical notes, as described in his 1704 book *Opticks*. He divided the circle into seven sections for seven colors, with the size of each section corresponding to the length of a musical interval.\n*   **\"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\"**: On a standard color wheel or in a spectrum, the color that lies between yellow and blue is green. We will therefore interpret this part of the question as referring to the color **Green**.\n*   **\"and blue itself\"**: This is the second boundary of our range.\n*   **The Range**: The question asks about the \"range between\" Green and Blue.\n*   **The Musical Note**: The final objective is to identify the single musical note Newton associated with this specific range/boundary.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Newton's Color-Note Association**\nNewton associated the seven colors of the spectrum with the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale. While modern associations often start with C for Red, Newton's original diagram in *Opticks* used the notes to mark the *boundaries* between the colors. His arrangement, corresponding to a Dorian musical mode, is as follows when reading around the circle:\n*   The line between Red and Orange is **D**.\n*   The line between Orange and Yellow is **E**.\n*   The line between Yellow and Green is **F**.\n*   The line between Green and Blue is **G**.\n*   The line between Blue and Indigo is **A**.\n*   The line between Indigo and Violet is **B**.\n*   The line between Violet and Red is **C**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Specific Range and its Corresponding Note**\n1.  The first color in the range is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue,\" which we have identified as **Green**.\n2.  The second color is **Blue**.\n3.  The question asks for the note corresponding to the \"range between\" Green and Blue. In Newton's diagram, the notes mark the dividing lines between the color sectors.\n4.  Consulting the established mapping from Step 2, we look for the line that separates the Green sector from the Blue sector.\n5.  The line between Green and Blue is explicitly marked with the musical note **G**.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Combining Colors\"**: The phrase \"combining yellow and blue\" could imply additive mixing (light) or subtractive mixing (pigment). However, in the context of Newton's spectral circle, Green is the color positioned sequentially between Yellow and Blue. This interpretation is the most logical one.\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Range Between\"**: This phrase could mean the entire section covering both Green and Blue, or it could mean the dividing point *at the boundary* of the two. Since the question asks for a single musical note (\"What musical note...\"), and Newton's diagram places single notes at the boundaries, interpreting it as the boundary is the most direct path to the intended answer.\n*   **Different Note Mappings**: Some modern interpretations map Red to C. However, even in that system (C, D, E, F, G, A, B), Green corresponds to F and Blue to G. The note *between* them would still logically be G, as it marks the transition. Sticking to Newton's original diagram provides the clearest and most historically accurate answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the direct analysis of Newton's color circle, the first color is Green and the second is Blue. The musical note that marks the boundary between the Green and Blue sections is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
