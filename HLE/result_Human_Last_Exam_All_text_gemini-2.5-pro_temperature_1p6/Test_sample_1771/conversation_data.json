    "This problem requires us to trace the phonological development of a Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb form through its descendant Germanic languages. We must apply the major sound laws that differentiate each stage of the language family.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form: `*seh₂gieti`**\n\n*   **Morphological Breakdown:**\n    *   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`, meaning 'to track, perceive, give a sign'. The `*h₂` is a laryngeal consonant.\n    *   **Present Stem:** The form `-ie-` represents the suffix `*-ye/o-` used to form thematic present tense verbs, often with a stative or processual meaning. The full form is `*seh₂g-ye-ti`.\n    *   **Ending:** `-ti` is the standard 3rd person singular primary active indicative ending.\n*   **Phonological Features:**\n    *   The crucial phonemes for the derivation are the root vowel preceding the laryngeal (`*e`), the laryngeal itself (`*h₂`), the root-final consonant (`*g`), the `*y` glide in the suffix, and the final stop in the ending (`*t`).\n\n**2. From PIE to Proto-Germanic (PGmc): `*sōkiþ`**\n\nSeveral major sound changes occur in the transition from PIE to Proto-Germanic.\n\n*   **Laryngeal Loss and Vowel Coloring/Lengthening:** The laryngeal `*h₂` colors an adjacent `*e` vowel to `*a` and then disappears. The sequence `*eh₂` typically becomes a long `*ā`.\n    *   `*seh₂g-` → `*sāg-`\n*   **Germanic Vowel Shift:** The long PIE vowel `*ā` shifts to `*ō` in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   `*sāg-` → `*sōg-`\n*   **Grimm's Law (First Germanic Consonant Shift):** This law affects all PIE stop consonants.\n    *   The voiced velar stop `*g` becomes a voiceless velar stop `*k`. `*sōg-` → `*sōk-`.\n    *   The voiceless dental stop `*t` in the ending becomes a voiceless dental fricative `*þ`. `-ti` → `-þi`.\n*   **Verner's Law:** This is a supplement to Grimm's law, causing voicing of the new fricatives if the original PIE accent did not fall on the immediately preceding syllable. Assuming root accent (`*séh₂gyeti`), this law does not apply to the `*k`.\n*   **Stem and Ending Formation:** The PIE present suffix `*-ye-` becomes PGmc `*-ji-` in the 3rd person singular (as PIE `*e` > PGmc `*i` in unstressed syllables). This verb falls into the **Class I Weak Verb** category in Germanic. The 3rd person singular present indicative ending is formed by the stem suffix `*-ji-` and the personal ending `*-þi`, which simplifies.\n    *   Full form: `*sōk-ji-þi` → `*sōkiþ`.\n*   **Result:** The Proto-Germanic form is **`*sōkiþ`**. (The infinitive would be `*sōkjaną`).\n\n**3. From PGmc to Old Norse (ON): `sœkir`**\n\n*   **I-mutation (i-umlaut):** The high front vowel `i` in the ending `*-iþ` triggers the fronting of the long back root vowel `*ō`.\n    *   `*ō` → `*œ̄` (a long, front, rounded vowel).\n    *   `*sōkiþ` → `*sœ̄kiþ`\n*   **Ending Development:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` develops into `-ir` in Old Norse. The vowel `i` is retained, and the final `þ` undergoes **rhotacism** (it becomes `r`, via an intermediate `ð` stage).\n    *   `*-iþ` → `-ir`\n*   **Result:** Combining the changes, the Old Norse form is **`sœkir`**. (cf. the infinitive `søkja`).\n\n**4. From PGmc to Old English (OE): `sēċeþ`**\n\n*   **Palatalization:** PGmc `*k` becomes the palato-alveolar affricate `ċ` ([tʃ]) when it comes before a front vowel. The `i` in the PGmc `*-iþ` ending provides this environment.\n    *   `*sōkiþ` → `*sōċiþ`\n*   **I-mutation (i-umlaut):** As in Old Norse, the `i` in the ending fronts the root vowel `*ō` to `*œ̄`.\n    *   `*sōċiþ` → `*sœ̄ċiþ`\n*   **Vowel Monophthongization:** In the Old English period (specifically West-Saxon), the front rounded vowel `*œ̄` is unrounded and raised to become the long front vowel `ē`.\n    *   `*sœ̄ċiþ` → `sēċiþ`\n*   **Ending Development:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `-eþ` in Old English.\n    *   `sēċiþ` → `sēċeþ`\n*   **Result:** The Old English form is **`sēċeþ`**. (cf. the infinitive `sēċan`).\n\n**5. From PGmc to Old High German (OHG): `suohhit`**\n\n*   **Old High German Diphthongization:** The PGmc long vowel `*ō` breaks into the diphthong `uo`. This change happens before i-mutation takes full effect on this particular sound.\n    *   `*sōk-` → `suok-`\n*   **Second Germanic (High German) Consonant Shift:** This shift differentiates Old High German from the other Germanic languages.\n    *   PGmc `*k` shifts to the long voiceless fricative `hh` [xx] between vowels or after a vowel.\n    *   PGmc `*þ` shifts to the stop `d`.\n*   **Ending Development:** The PGmc ending `*-iþ` becomes `*-id` (due to `þ` > `d`). Following the rule of **final-obstruent devoicing**, this `d` becomes `t`.\n    *   `*-iþ` → `*-id` → `-it`.\n*   **Combining the changes:** `*sōkiþ` → `suohhit`.\n*   **A Careful Point on I-mutation in OHG:** While OHG has i-mutation, the diphthong `uo` was often resistant to it, especially in the paradigms of common verbs like `suohhen` ('to seek'). While umlaut would theoretically produce `*süehhit`, the attested and standard form lacks umlaut in the root vowel.\n*   **Result:** The Old High German form is **`suohhit`**. (cf. the infinitive `suohhen`).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkiþ`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sœkir`\n*   **Old English:** `sēċeþ`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhit`\n\n<<<**Proto-Germanic:** *sōkiþ; **Old Norse:** sœkir; **Old English:** sēċeþ; **Old High German:** suohhit>>>"
