    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of human let-7 family members identified to date.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question**\nThe core of the question is to determine the total count of members belonging to the \"let-7 family\" of microRNAs that have been specifically identified in humans (*Homo sapiens*). The phrase \"to date\" implies that we should use the most current and authoritative information available.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Authoritative Source**\nThe primary and most widely accepted database for microRNA (miRNA) sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. Any accurate count of miRNA family members should be based on the data in miRBase.\n\n**Step 3: Define \"Family Member\" - A Crucial Point of Care**\nThis is the most critical point of analysis, as \"member\" can be interpreted in two main ways:\n1.  **Unique mature miRNA sequences:** These are the final, functional miRNA molecules. Several different genes can sometimes produce the exact same mature miRNA sequence.\n2.  **Unique precursor miRNA genes (loci):** These are the distinct locations in the genome that code for a let-7 family miRNA. This count is often higher than the mature sequence count.\n\nIn scientific literature, when referring to the number of members in a gene family, the count of distinct genes (or loci) is commonly used. Therefore, we will consider the number of genes as the most comprehensive answer, while also detailing the number of unique mature products for clarity.\n\n**Step 4: List the Human let-7 Family Members**\nBased on the current miRBase data, the let-7 family in humans is composed of the following distinct mature miRNAs:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98 (This miRNA is considered part of the let-7 family due to its high sequence similarity, especially in the \"seed\" region).\n\nThis gives a total of **9 unique mature miRNA molecules**.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Corresponding Genes (Loci)**\nNow, let's determine how many distinct genes encode these 9 mature miRNAs. Some members are encoded by more than one gene at different chromosomal locations.\n\n*   **let-7a** is encoded by 3 genes: `let-7a-1`, `let-7a-2`, `let-7a-3`.\n*   **let-7f** is encoded by 2 genes: `let-7f-1`, `let-7f-2`.\n*   **let-7b** is encoded by 1 gene.\n*   **let-7c** is encoded by 1 gene.\n*   **let-7d** is encoded by 1 gene.\n*   **let-7e** is encoded by 1 gene.\n*   **let-7g** is encoded by 1 gene.\n*   **let-7i** is encoded by 1 gene.\n*   **miR-98** is encoded by 1 gene.\n\nSumming these up gives the total number of let-7 family genes:\n3 (for let-7a) + 2 (for let-7f) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **12 genes**.\n\n**Step 6: Address Exclusions and Other Careful Points**\n*   **Deprecated Members:** The miRNA `let-7h` was once listed but has since been removed from miRBase. It was determined to be a fragment of a ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and not a true miRNA. It should not be included in the count.\n*   **Distant Relatives:** Some other miRNAs, such as `miR-202`, share some homology but are typically considered more distant relatives and are not included in the count of the core let-7 family.\n*   **Final Interpretation:** Since the question asks for the number of members \"identified\", and each of the 12 genes represents a distinct genetic element that has been identified, 12 is the more comprehensive and commonly cited number in research contexts.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nTo date, the human let-7 family consists of **9** unique mature miRNAs that are encoded by a total of **12** distinct genes (also referred to as paralogs or loci). The most common and comprehensive answer when asked for the number of \"members\" identified in the genome is the gene count.\n\n<<<12>>>"
