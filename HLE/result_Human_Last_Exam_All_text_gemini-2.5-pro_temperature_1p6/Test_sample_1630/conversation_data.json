    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Definitions**\n*   We are given two polynomials, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, both of degree 3.\n*   We are given that their derivatives, $f'(x)$ and $g'(x)$, are positive for all real numbers $x$. This means both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n*   We need to find the maximum possible number of **fixed points** of the composite function $f(g(x))$.\n*   A fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value $x_0$ such that $h(x_0) = x_0$.\n\n**2. Set up the Equation for Fixed Points**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. The fixed points are the real solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$, which can be written as:\n$f(g(x)) = x$\nLet's define a new function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. The number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is the number of real roots of the equation $H(x) = 0$.\n\n**3. Determine the Degree of the Polynomial H(x)**\n*   Let $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$, with $a \\neq 0$.\n*   Let $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, with $p \\neq 0$.\n*   The composite function $f(g(x))$ is found by substituting $g(x)$ into $f(x)$:\n    $f(g(x)) = a(g(x))^3 + b(g(x))^2 + c(g(x)) + d$\n    $f(g(x)) = a(px^3 + ...)^3 + ... = a(p^3x^9 + ...) + ... = ap^3x^9 + ...$\n*   The degree of $f(g(x))$ is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n*   The function $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is therefore a polynomial of degree 9.\n*   According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots. Thus, $H(x)=0$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**4. Analyze the Constraints on the Derivatives**\n*   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 2bx + c > 0$ for all $x$. For a quadratic to be always positive, its leading coefficient must be positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant must be non-positive ($\\Delta_f = (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) = 4b^2 - 12ac \\le 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac \\le 0$).\n*   Similarly, $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r > 0$ for all $x$. This implies $3p > 0 \\implies p > 0$ and $\\Delta_g = (2q)^2 - 4(3p)(r) = 4q^2 - 12pr \\le 0 \\implies q^2 - 3pr \\le 0$.\n\n**5. Use Rolle's Theorem to Verify the Upper Bound**\nThe number of roots of a function is related to the number of roots of its derivatives.\n*   If a function $H(x)$ has $N$ distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, its derivative $H'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ distinct real roots.\n*   By extension, its second derivative $H''(x)$ must have at least $N-2$ distinct real roots.\n*   This gives us the inequality: $N \\le (\\text{number of real roots of } H''(x)) + 2$.\n\n**6. Calculate the Second Derivative H''(x)**\nLet's find the second derivative of $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n*   $H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n*   $H''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x))$. Using the product rule:\n    $H''(x) = \\left(\\frac{d}{dx}f'(g(x))\\right) \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\n    Using the chain rule for the first part:\n    $H''(x) = \\left(f''(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)\\right) \\cdot g'(x) + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\n    $H''(x) = f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x))g''(x)$.\n\n**7. Determine the Degree of H''(x)**\nLet's find the degrees of the polynomials involved in the expression for $H''(x)$:\n*   deg($f$) = 3 $\\implies$ deg($f'$) = 2 $\\implies$ deg($f''$) = 1.\n*   deg($g$) = 3 $\\implies$ deg($g'$) = 2 $\\implies$ deg($g''$) = 1.\nNow we find the degree of each term in $H''(x)$:\n*   **First term: $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$**\n    *   deg($f''(g(x))$) = deg($f''$) $\\times$ deg($g$) = $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   deg($(g'(x))^2$) = 2 $\\times$ deg($g'$) = $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n    *   deg(First term) = $3 + 4 = 7$.\n*   **Second term: $f'(g(x))g''(x)$**\n    *   deg($f'(g(x))$) = deg($f'$) $\\times$ deg($g$) = $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   deg($g''$) = 1.\n    *   deg(Second term) = $6 + 1 = 7$.\n\nFor the degree of $H''(x)$ to be less than 7, the leading terms of the two parts would have to cancel. Let's check the leading coefficients:\n*   $f''(x) = 6ax + 2b \\implies$ leading term of $f''(g(x))$ is $6a(px^3) = 6apx^3$.\n*   $g'(x) = 3px^2 + ... \\implies$ leading term of $(g'(x))^2$ is $(3px^2)^2 = 9p^2x^4$.\n*   Leading term of the first part: $(6apx^3)(9p^2x^4) = 54ap^3x^7$.\n*   $f'(x) = 3ax^2 + ... \\implies$ leading term of $f'(g(x))$ is $3a(px^3)^2 = 3ap^2x^6$.\n*   $g''(x) = 6px + 2q \\implies$ leading term is $6px$.\n*   Leading term of the second part: $(3ap^2x^6)(6px) = 18ap^3x^7$.\nThe leading coefficient of $H''(x)$ is $54ap^3 + 18ap^3 = 72ap^3$. Since $a>0$ and $p>0$, this coefficient is non-zero.\nTherefore, $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7.\n\n**8. Conclusion**\n*   Since $H''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7, it can have at most 7 real roots.\n*   Using the inequality from Rolle's Theorem, the number of roots of $H(x)=0$, denoted by $N$, satisfies $N \\le 7 + 2 = 9$.\n*   This confirms our initial finding that the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n*   The question asks for the maximum number. The existence of polynomials $f$ and $g$ satisfying the conditions and for which $f(g(x))-x=0$ has 9 roots is a technical point. However, the constraints are not prohibitive, and there are enough free parameters in the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ to construct such a case where the maximum number of roots is achieved. In problems of this type, unless a specific property can be shown to restrict the number of roots further, the algebraic maximum is typically attainable.\n\nThus, the maximum number of fixed points that $f(g(x))$ can have is 9.\n\n>>>9"
