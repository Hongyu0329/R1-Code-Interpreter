    "**Step-by-step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The fundamental request is to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Input:** The question provides two pieces of information:\n    *   A context: \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". This information provides the origin of the matrix but does not appear to be necessary for the calculation itself.\n    *   An explicit definition: \"where: \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}. \\]\" The word \"where\" indicates that the matrix `A` given is the precise one to be used for the computation.\n3.  **Formulate the Plan:** The problem simplifies to finding the determinant of the given matrix `A`. We can use standard methods for calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Focus on the provided matrix:** The most important point is to recognize that the matrix `A` is explicitly given. The information about the Markov quiver is context and does not alter the matrix we need to work with. We do not need to derive the matrix from the theory of Markov quivers.\n*   **Choice of method:** There are several methods to calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix, including cofactor expansion (also known as Laplace expansion) and the Rule of Sarrus. Using more than one method is a good way to verify the result.\n*   **Look for matrix properties:** Before starting a lengthy calculation, it's often wise to inspect the matrix for special properties. A matrix with a row or column of zeros, or with linearly dependent rows/columns, has a determinant of 0. This can provide a significant shortcut.\n\n**Step-by-Step Calculation**\n\nWe need to compute the determinant of:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**Method 1: Cofactor Expansion**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix is given by the formula:\ndet(A) = \\( a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{32}) - a_{12}(a_{21}a_{33} - a_{23}a_{31}) + a_{13}(a_{21}a_{32} - a_{22}a_{31}) \\)\n\n1.  Substitute the values from matrix A into the formula:\n    det(A) = \\( 2 \\times \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\times \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\times \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\)\n\n2.  Calculate the determinants of the 2x2 sub-matrices:\n    *   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2 \\times 2) - (-1 \\times -1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n    *   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1 \\times 2) - (-1 \\times -1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n    *   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1 \\times -1) - (2 \\times -1) = 1 - (-2) = 1 + 2 = 3 \\)\n\n3.  Substitute these values back into the main expression:\n    det(A) = \\( 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3) \\)\n    det(A) = \\( 6 - 3 - 3 \\)\n    det(A) = 0\n\n**Method 2: Observing Matrix Properties (Shortcut)**\n\nA key property of a matrix with a determinant of 0 is that its rows (or columns) are linearly dependent. Let's inspect the rows of matrix A:\n*   Row 1: [2, -1, -1]\n*   Row 2: [-1, 2, -1]\n*   Row 3: [-1, -1, 2]\n\nLet's sum the three rows:\n(Row 1) + (Row 2) + (Row 3) = [2 + (-1) + (-1), -1 + 2 + (-1), -1 + (-1) + 2]\n= [0, 0, 0]\n\nSince there is a linear combination of the rows (in this case, a simple sum) that results in the zero vector, the rows are linearly dependent. Therefore, the matrix is singular, and its determinant must be 0.\n\nBoth methods confirm the result.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe determinant of the given matrix `A` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
