    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the type of cryptography:** The question asks about **symmetric key** cryptography. This is a crucial point because quantum computers affect symmetric and asymmetric (public-key) cryptography differently. In symmetric-key systems like AES, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\n\n2.  **Understand the threat model:** The threat is an **\"arbitrarily powerful quantum computer.\"** This means we must consider the most effective known quantum algorithm for breaking this type of cryptography. We assume the quantum computer is large enough and stable enough to execute this algorithm.\n\n3.  **Classical vs. Quantum Attacks on Symmetric Keys:**\n    *   **Classical Attack:** The most efficient general attack against a symmetric cipher is a brute-force search. For a key of *n* bits, there are 2^n possible keys. A classical computer would need to try, on average, half of them (2^(n-1)), which is on the order of 2^n operations. Thus, an n-bit key is said to have *n* bits of security against a classical attack.\n    *   **Quantum Attack:** The most effective known quantum algorithm for this type of unstructured search problem is **Grover's algorithm**. Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical brute-force search. Instead of O(N) operations to search a space of N items, it requires only O(√N) operations.\n    *   **Impact of Grover's Algorithm:** For an n-bit symmetric key, the search space (N) is 2^n. A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can find the key in approximately √(2^n) = 2^(n/2) operations. This means the effective security level of an n-bit key is reduced from *n* bits to *n/2* bits.\n\n4.  **Determine the required security level:** The term \"cannot crack it\" means the computational effort required is considered infeasible by modern cryptographic standards. The widely accepted benchmark for long-term security, even against quantum computers, is a security level of at least **128 bits**. This means an attacker would need to perform a number of operations on the order of 2^128, which is considered computationally infeasible for the foreseeable future for any kind of computer.\n\n5.  **Calculate the minimum key length:**\n    *   Let 'K' be the required symmetric key length in bits.\n    *   The effective security level against a quantum computer is K/2 bits.\n    *   We want this security level to be at least 128 bits.\n    *   So, we set up the equation: `Effective Security = K / 2`\n    *   We need `K / 2 ≥ 128`\n    *   Solving for K, we get `K ≥ 256`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** To achieve a security level equivalent to 128 bits against a quantum computer, a symmetric key must be at least **256 bits** long.\n\n**Evaluation of the answer choices based on the analysis:**\n\n*   **A. 256:** A 256-bit key provides 256/2 = 128 bits of security against a quantum computer. This meets the minimum requirement for being considered secure.\n*   **B. 128:** A 128-bit key provides 128/2 = 64 bits of security. 2^64 operations are considered potentially feasible to attack and therefore not secure enough.\n*   **C. 512:** A 512-bit key provides 512/2 = 256 bits of security. While very secure, it is not the *minimum* length required.\n*   **D. 1024:** A 1024-bit key provides 1024/2 = 512 bits of security. Also secure, but not the minimum.\n*   **E. 2048:** A 2048-bit key provides 2048/2 = 1024 bits of security. Also secure, but not the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the minimum length required is 256 bits.\n\n<<<A>>>"
