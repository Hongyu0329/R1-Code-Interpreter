    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) at adjacent carbons indicates that the bromine and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring, meaning this is a **trans** isomer.\n*   **Reagent/Solvent:** Potassium tert-butoxide ($K^+OC(CH_3)_3$ or t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically bulky base.\n*   **Reaction Type:** A secondary alkyl halide reacting with a strong base strongly favors an elimination reaction. The specific mechanism is E2 (bimolecular elimination).\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions**\nThe E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) must be in an **anti-periplanar** arrangement. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (one group must be axial-up and the other axial-down).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**\nSince the substrate is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, it can exist in two chair conformations which are in equilibrium:\n1.  **Diequatorial Conformation:** Both the bromine and methyl groups are in equatorial positions. This is the **more stable** conformation because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position.\n2.  **Diaxial Conformation:** Both the bromine and methyl groups are in axial positions. This is the **less stable** conformation due to significant steric strain (1,3-diaxial interactions).\n\nThe molecule will spend most of its time in the more stable diequatorial conformation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Reactive Conformation**\n*   In the more stable **diequatorial** conformation, the bromine leaving group is in an equatorial position. An equatorial leaving group cannot achieve the necessary trans-diaxial geometry with any β-hydrogen. Therefore, **E2 elimination cannot occur from this stable conformation**.\n*   The molecule must first flip into the less stable **diaxial** conformation for the reaction to proceed. Although the concentration of this conformer is very low at any given moment, it is the only one that is reactive for E2 (this is explained by the Curtin-Hammett principle).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Elimination from the Reactive (Diaxial) Conformation**\nLet's analyze the diaxial conformation, which has an axial bromine and an axial methyl group. Assume Br is axial-up and Me is axial-down.\n*   **Leaving Group:** The bromine at C1 is **axial** (up).\n*   **β-Hydrogens:** We need to find a β-hydrogen that is **axial** and pointing **down**.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C2:** The methyl group on C2 is axial (down). Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is **equatorial** (up). This hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 (the Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene) **is not possible**.\n    *   **β-Hydrogen at C6:** The carbon at C6 has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 points **down**. This hydrogen is perfectly positioned trans-diaxial to the axial bromine (up).\n*   **Conclusion of Pathway:** Because of this strict stereoelectronic requirement, the base can only abstract the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Final Product**\n*   The elimination occurs by removing the Br from C1 and the H from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group on C2 remains untouched.\n*   The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the Hofmann product (less substituted alkene), and in this specific case, it is the only possible product due to the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\nIn summary, the regiochemical outcome of this reaction is not determined by the bulky nature of the base (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann rules), but rather it is controlled by the stereochemistry of the substrate, which only allows for one possible E2 elimination pathway.\n\nThe final product is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
