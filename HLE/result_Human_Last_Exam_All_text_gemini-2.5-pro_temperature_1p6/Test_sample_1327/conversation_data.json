    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the sequence and identify the terms.**\nThe given sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\nLet's denote the terms as A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and we need to find A6.\nA1 = 2\nA2 = 11\nA3 = 23\nA4 = 51\nA5 = 119\nA6 = ?\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple pattern like arithmetic or geometric progression.**\n*   **Arithmetic Progression (common difference):**\n    11 - 2 = 9\n    23 - 11 = 12\n    51 - 23 = 28\n    The differences are not constant, so it's not an arithmetic sequence.\n*   **Geometric Progression (common ratio):**\n    11 / 2 = 5.5\n    23 / 11 â‰ˆ 2.09\n    The ratios are not constant, so it's not a geometric sequence.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex recursive pattern.**\nA common type of pattern is `A_n = k * A_{n-1} + C`, where `k` is a multiplier and `C` is a constant or a sequence of numbers. Let's try `k=2` as the numbers roughly double each time.\n\n*   From A1 to A2: 2 * 2 = 4. To get to 11, we add 7.  (11 = 2 * 2 + 7)\n*   From A2 to A3: 2 * 11 = 22. To get to 23, we add 1. (23 = 2 * 11 + 1)\n*   From A3 to A4: 2 * 23 = 46. To get to 51, we add 5. (51 = 2 * 23 + 5)\n*   From A4 to A5: 2 * 51 = 102. To get to 119, we add 17. (119 = 2 * 51 + 17)\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the sequence of the added numbers.**\nThe recursive rule seems to be `A_n = 2 * A_{n-1} + c_n`, where `c_n` is the sequence of numbers we add. This sequence is {7, 1, 5, 17, ...}. The first term, 7, seems to break an otherwise recognizable pattern. In such problems, it's common for the pattern to establish itself from the second or third term.\n\nLet's ignore the first added number (7) and analyze the sequence of constants starting from the third term of the original sequence: {1, 5, 17, ...}. We need to find the next number in this new sequence to calculate A6.\n\n**Step 5: Find the pattern in the new sequence {1, 5, 17, ...}.**\nLet's call this sequence C'. C' = {1, 5, 17}.\n*   **Method 1: Analyze the differences.**\n    *   The difference between 5 and 1 is 4.\n    *   The difference between 17 and 5 is 12.\n    *   The sequence of differences is {4, 12, ...}. We can see that each difference is 3 times the previous one (12 = 4 * 3).\n    *   Following this pattern, the next difference should be 12 * 3 = 36.\n    *   Therefore, the next term in the sequence C' is 17 + 36 = 53.\n\n*   **Method 2: Find a recursive formula for C'.**\n    *   Check if `C'_{n+1} = 3 * C'_n + 2`.\n    *   `3 * 1 + 2 = 5`. This works for the second term.\n    *   `3 * 5 + 2 = 17`. This works for the third term.\n    *   The pattern is consistent. So, the next term is `3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the next number to be added is 53.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the missing term in the original sequence.**\nWe found that the pattern to find A6 is `A6 = 2 * A5 + 53`.\n*   A5 = 119\n*   A6 = 2 * 119 + 53\n*   A6 = 238 + 53\n*   A6 = 291\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe pattern is that each number is twice the previous number plus a value. This value follows its own pattern starting from the third term. The sequence to be filled in the parentheses is 291.\n\n<<<A>>>"
