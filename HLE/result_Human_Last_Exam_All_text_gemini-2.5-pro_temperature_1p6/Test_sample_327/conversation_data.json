    "To find the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find its canonical representation, which is the form with the minimum number of pieces.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Canonical Representation of Dyadic Rationals in Hackenbush\n\nThe value of a Red-Blue Hackenbush position is a surreal number. For dyadic rationals (numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^n}$), there exists a unique simplest representation, known as the canonical form.\n\nThe canonical form of a number is constructed as a sum of simpler games, where the value of the sum of disjoint games (games not connected to each other, except at the ground) is the sum of their individual values. The most efficient representation corresponds to the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF) of the number's binary expansion.\n\n### Step 2: Find the Non-Adjacent Form (NAF) of $\\frac{13}{16}$\n\nFirst, we write $\\frac{13}{16}$ in binary.\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+0+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{0}{8} + \\frac{1}{16}$\nSo, in binary, $\\frac{13}{16} = 0.1101_2$.\n\nThe Non-Adjacent Form (NAF) is a signed-digit representation where no two consecutive digits are non-zero. We can convert a binary representation to NAF using the identity $0.11...1 = 1 - 0.00...1$ (where the run has $k$ ones and the final 1 is in the $k$-th position).\nIn $0.1101_2$, we have a run of two '1's at the beginning: $0.11_2$.\n$0.11_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\nThis can be rewritten as $1 - \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSo, we substitute this into the original number:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = 0.1101_2 = (0.11)_2 + (0.0001)_2 = (1 - \\frac{1}{4}) + \\frac{1}{16} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThis is the NAF expansion of $\\frac{13}{16}$, because the non-zero terms ($1$, $-\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{16}$) are not in adjacent powers of 2.\n$1 = 2^0$, $-\\frac{1}{4} = -2^{-2}$, $\\frac{1}{16} = 2^{-4}$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Pieces for Each Term in the NAF Expansion\n\nThe canonical game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the sum of the canonical games for each term in its NAF expansion: $G(1)$, $G(-\\frac{1}{4})$, and $G(\\frac{1}{16})$.\n\n1.  **Game for the number 1:**\n    The canonical representation of a positive integer $n$ is a single stalk of $n$ red edges.\n    So, the game for 1 is a single red edge.\n    *   Number of pieces = **1** (1 red).\n\n2.  **Game for the number $\\frac{1}{16}$:**\n    The canonical representation of $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ (for $k \\ge 1$) is a stalk consisting of one red edge at the base, with $k$ blue edges stacked on top. The total number of pieces is $1+k$.\n    For $\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2^4}$, we have $k=4$. The game requires 1 red edge and 4 blue edges.\n    *   Number of pieces = $1+4 = \\textbf{5}$ (1 red, 4 blue).\n\n3.  **Game for the number $-\\frac{1}{4}$:**\n    The game for a negative number, $-x$, is the color-swapped version of the game for $x$.\n    First, we find the game for $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$. Here, $k=2$. This requires 1 red edge and 2 blue edges (total $1+2=3$ pieces).\n    To get the game for $-\\frac{1}{4}$, we swap the colors. So, we need 1 blue edge and 2 red edges.\n    *   Number of pieces = $1+2 = \\textbf{3}$ (1 blue, 2 red).\n\n### Step 4: Sum the Pieces\n\nThe total number of pieces is the sum of the pieces from each of the three disjoint games.\nTotal pieces = (pieces for 1) + (pieces for $-\\frac{1}{4}$) + (pieces for $\\frac{1}{16}$)\nTotal pieces = $1 + 3 + 5 = 9$.\n\nThe red pieces are $1$ (from game 1) $+ 2$ (from game -1/4) $= 3$.\nThe blue pieces are $1$ (from game -1/4) $+ 4$ (from game 1/16) $= 5$.\nThe total piece count $3+5=9$ is incorrect. Let's recheck.\nPieces for 1: 1 red.\nPieces for -1/4: 2 red, 1 blue.\nPieces for 1/16: 1 red, 4 blue.\nTotal red pieces: $1+2+1 = 4$.\nTotal blue pieces: $0+1+4 = 5$.\nTotal pieces: $4+5 = 9$. The calculation is correct.\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is 9."
