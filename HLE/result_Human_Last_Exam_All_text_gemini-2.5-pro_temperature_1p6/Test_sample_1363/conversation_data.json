    "An analysis of the question and the technical aspects of each dance:\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question:**\nThe question asks in which dance the fundamental technique makes it impossible to \"overturn\" a reverse turn.\n*   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in all listed dances that turns to the left.\n*   **Overturn:** To turn more than the standard, prescribed amount for the figure.\n*   **Without disregarding the technique:** This is the most critical part of the question. It means you must adhere to the core, defining principles of the dance, such as its specific type of movement, footwork, rise and fall, and sway.\n\n**2. Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Dance:**\n\n*   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This is a fast, rotational dance. The reverse turn already involves a full 360° rotation over six steps. While the speed makes it difficult to add more turn, it is not technically impossible. A slight modification in body rotation could achieve a small amount of overturn, though it might compromise the flow. However, the fundamental mechanism of rotation isn't violated.\n\n*   **B. English Waltz & D. Slow Foxtrot:** These are \"swing dances.\" Their technique is built upon the principles of Body Swing, Rise and Fall, and Sway. These very principles are what allow a dancer to control the amount of turn. By increasing the body swing or using sway, a dancer can easily and intentionally overturn a figure. This is a common practice in choreography to change alignment on the dance floor. Therefore, in these dances, overturning is not only possible but is a part of advanced technique.\n\n*   **E. Quickstep:** This is also a swing dance, combining the characteristics of Foxtrot with energetic hops and chassés. Like the Waltz and Foxtrot, its technique allows for variations in turn amount. Overturning figures is common to create dynamic movement and navigate the floor at high speed.\n\n*   **C. European Tango:** This dance is technically unique among the five choices. Its defining characteristics are:\n    *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant level, moving with flexed knees.\n    *   **No Sway:** The body does not incline sideways.\n    *   **Staccato Action:** Movement is sharp, clipped, and deliberate, not flowing or swinging.\n    *   **Grounded Movement:** The feet are kept close to the floor.\n\n    Now, consider how a turn is created in swing dances versus Tango. In swing dances, you \"swing\" the body to generate momentum for the turn. To \"overturn,\" you simply swing more. In Tango, turns are executed by swivelling on the feet with sharp body rotation, but without any swing, sway, or lift.\n\n    If you were to try and **overturn** a reverse turn in Tango, you would need to generate more rotational force than a simple swivel allows. The natural way to do this is to use body swing and momentum, which would inevitably introduce **sway** and likely a **rise** in the body. Doing so would be a direct violation of the foundational, defining techniques of Tango. Therefore, it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn *without disregarding the technique*. Any attempt to do so changes the dance from Tango into something else.\n\n**3. Conclusion:**\nThe European Tango is the only dance listed where the core technical rules (no rise and fall, no sway) are fundamentally incompatible with the actions required to overturn a turn.\n\n<<<C>>>"
