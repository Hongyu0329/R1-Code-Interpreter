    "An analysis of the user's question is as follows, breaking it down into step-by-step points.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal:**\nThe user wants to design a state observer for a given discrete-time system. The specific requirement is that the observer should be \"deadbeat,\" meaning the state estimation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` must become identically zero after the shortest possible number of time steps. This implies finding an observer gain matrix `L`.\n\n**2. Recall Observer Theory:**\n*   **System Equations:**\n    `x(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)`\n    `y(k) = Cx(k)`\n*   **Observer Equations:**\n    `x_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))`\n    where `y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k)`.\n*   **Error Dynamics:** The estimation error `e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k)` evolves according to:\n    `e(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)`\n*   **Deadbeat Condition:** For the error to become zero in a finite number of steps, say `v`, and stay zero, we must have `e(k) = 0` for all `k >= v`, regardless of the initial error `e(0)`. This requires the matrix `A_cl = A - LC` to be nilpotent, i.e., `(A - LC)^v = 0` for some integer `v`.\n*   **Shortest Possible Time:** The shortest possible time `v` in which this can be achieved is equal to the observability index `v_o` of the system `(C, A)`.\n*   **Design as Pole Placement:** The condition `(A - LC)^v = 0` implies that all eigenvalues of `A - LC` must be zero. The problem is thus equivalent to placing all `n` poles (eigenvalues) of the observer error dynamics at the origin (`Î» = 0`).\n\n**3. Check System Properties (Observability):**\nA deadbeat observer can only be designed if the system is completely observable. Observability means that the initial state `x(0)` can be uniquely determined from a finite sequence of outputs `y(k)`.\n*   **Matrices:**\n    `A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]`\n    `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]`\n*   **State Dimension:** `n = 4`. Output Dimension: `p = 2`.\n*   **Observability Matrix:** The system is observable if the observability matrix `O = [C; CA; CA^2; ...; CA^(n-1)]` has rank `n`.\n*   **Calculations:**\n    *   `C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]` (Rank = 2)\n    *   `CA = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]`\n    *   The matrix `[C; CA]` is a 4x4 matrix. Its rank is found to be 3. This is not sufficient to conclude unobservability. We must check higher powers.\n    *   `A^2 = A * A = [0 0 1 -2; -3 0 2 -1; 2 0 -1 3; 2 1 -1 -1]`\n    *   `CA^2 = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]`\n    *   The full observability matrix to check is `O_3 = [C; CA; CA^2]`, which is a `6x4` matrix.\n    *   Let's check the rank of `O_3` by finding 4 linearly independent rows.\n        1.  `r1 = [1 0 0 0]` (from C)\n        2.  `r2 = [0 0 0 1]` (from `C(2,:) - C(1,:)`)\n        3.  `r3 = [0 0 1 0]` (from `CA(2,:) + 2*C(1,:)`)\n        4.  `r4 = [2 1 0 -3]` (from `CA^2(2,:)`) has a non-zero element in the second position, which the previous vectors do not. It is linearly independent.\n    *   The set of rows of `O_3` spans a 4-dimensional space. `rank(O_3) = 4`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The system is observable.\n*   **Observability Index (`v_o`):** The index is the smallest integer `v` such that `rank([C; ...; CA^(v-1)]) = n`.\n    *   `v=1`: `rank(C) = 2 < 4`.\n    *   `v=2`: `rank([C; CA]) = 3 < 4`.\n    *   `v=3`: `rank([C; CA; CA^2]) = 4`.\n    *   Therefore, the observability index is `v_o = 3`. The fastest deadbeat observer will drive the error to zero in 3 steps. This means we need to find `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n**4. Design the Observer Gain Matrix `L`:**\nThe goal is to find a `4x2` matrix `L` such that `(A-LC)` has all eigenvalues at 0 and its nilpotency index is 3.\n\n*   **Strategy:** We can try to construct `L` to give `A - LC` a simple nilpotent structure. Let's aim to make one or more columns of `A - LC` zero.\n    `L = [l11 l12; l21 l22; l31 l32; l41 l42]`\n    `LC = [l11+l12, 0, 0, l12; l21+l22, 0, 0, l22; l31+l32, 0, 0, l32; l41+l42, 0, 0, l42]`\n    `A - LC = [-1-(l11+l12), 0, 0, 1-l12; 1-(l21+l22), 0, 0, 2-l22; -(l31+l32), 1, 0, -1-l32; -1-(l41+l42), 0, 1, -1-l42]`\n*   Let's set the 4th column of `A-LC` to zero.\n    *   `1 - l12 = 0   => l12 = 1`\n    *   `2 - l22 = 0   => l22 = 2`\n    *   `-1 - l32 = 0  => l32 = -1`\n    *   `-1 - l42 = 0  => l42 = -1`\n    This determines the second column of `L`.\n*   Now `A-LC` becomes:\n    `A-LC = [-1-l11-1, 0, 0, 0; 1-l21-2, 0, 0, 0; 1-l31, 1, 0, 0; -l41, 0, 1, 0]`\n    `A-LC = [-2-l11, 0, 0, 0; -1-l21, 0, 0, 0; 1-l31, 1, 0, 0; -l41, 0, 1, 0]`\n    This is a lower triangular matrix. Its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: `-2-l11, 0, 0, 0`.\n*   To place all eigenvalues at 0, we must have `-2 - l11 = 0 => l11 = -2`.\n    The values `l21`, `l31`, `l41` are still free. We must choose them to satisfy the condition `(A-LC)^3 = 0`.\n*   Let `a = -1-l21`, `b = 1-l31`, `c = -l41`. Then:\n    `A_cl = A-LC = [0 0 0 0; a 0 0 0; b 1 0 0; c 0 1 0]`\n    `A_cl^2 = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; a 0 0 0; b 1 0 0]`\n    `A_cl^3 = [0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0; a 0 0 0]`\n*   For `A_cl^3` to be the zero matrix, we must have `a = 0`.\n    `a = -1 - l21 = 0 => l21 = -1`.\n*   The parameters `b` and `c` (and thus `l31` and `l41`) can be chosen freely. A simple choice is to set them to zero, which means `l31=1` and `l41=0`. However, setting the parameters themselves to zero provides a simpler gain matrix: `l31=0` and `l41=0`. This choice doesn't violate any condition.\n*   **Final Gain Matrix L:**\n    `l11 = -2`, `l12 = 1`\n    `l21 = -1`, `l22 = 2`\n    `l31 =  0`, `l32 = -1` (we choose `l31=0`)\n    `l41 =  0`, `l42 = -1` (we choose `l41=0`)\n    So, `L = [-2 1; -1 2; 0 -1; 0 -1]`.\n\n**5. Final Answer Formulation:**\nThe derived gain matrix `L` will be presented as the final answer.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe system is defined by matrices A, B, and C.\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\nWe design a deadbeat observer with gain L such that the error dynamics matrix `A_cl = A - LC` is nilpotent with an index equal to the system's observability index, `v_o = 3`. This means `(A-LC)^3 = 0`.\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, one possible gain matrix `L` that achieves this is:\n`L = [[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]` (in row-vector format)\nor as a matrix:\nL =\n   -2    1\n   -1    2\n    0   -1\n    0   -1\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [0, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
