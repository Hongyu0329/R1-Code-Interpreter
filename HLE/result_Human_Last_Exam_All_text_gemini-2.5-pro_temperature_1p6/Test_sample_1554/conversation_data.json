    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific philosopher from a particular school of thought who made a specific conceptual distinction.\n*   **Philosopher's Affiliation:** Lviv-Warsaw School.\n*   **Conceptual Distinction:** Decomposing the notion of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nThe Lviv-Warsaw School was a prominent Polish school of logic and analytic philosophy active in the interwar period. Its members were known for their precision, clarity, and rigorous analysis of language, logic, and epistemology. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. The question directs us to search among these thinkers.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conceptual distinction: \"hallmark,\" \"symptoms,\" and \"signals\"**\nThis is a distinction within semiotics (the theory of signs) or epistemology (the theory of knowledge).\n*   **Hallmark/Sign:** A general term for something that stands for or indicates something else. The Polish word is often *znak*.\n*   **Symptom:** This term usually refers to a *natural sign*. A symptom is causally connected to what it signifies. For example, smoke is a symptom of fire because fire causes smoke. A fever is a symptom of an illness.\n*   **Signal:** This term usually refers to a *conventional* or *artificial sign*. A signal's meaning is established by a rule, agreement, or habit, not a natural causal law. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop; the word \"cat\" is a signal for the concept of a cat.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the distinction to a philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School**\nWe need to find which philosopher from this school engaged in this kind of semiotic analysis.\n*   While many in the school were interested in language, the work of **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz** is most directly relevant here.\n*   Ajdukiewicz was deeply involved in the philosophy of language and logic. In his works, particularly in his seminal book *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), he presents a detailed classification of signs and reasoning processes.\n*   He explicitly analyzes the concept of a sign (*znak*) and divides it into different categories based on the nature of the connection between the sign and what it signifies.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the specific terminology with Ajdukiewicz's philosophy**\n*   Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz distinguished between **symptoms** (in Polish, *oznaki*) and **signals** (in Polish, *sygnały*).\n*   He defined a **symptom** as a natural sign where the relationship is causal. One infers the cause (e.g., a disease) from the effect (e.g., a rash).\n*   He defined a **signal** as a sign established by convention. The meaning of a signal is understood by someone who knows the relevant rule or custom. Linguistic expressions are a primary example of signals.\n*   This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of language, meaning, and different types of inference.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Translation:** The term \"hallmark\" in the question is a plausible English translation for a general concept like \"sign\" or \"indicator.\" In Ajdukiewicz's original Polish, the key terms are *znak* (sign), *oznaka* (symptom or mark), and *sygnał* (signal). Understanding that \"hallmark\" serves as a stand-in for a general category of \"sign\" is crucial.\n2.  **Context:** Ajdukiewicz's distinction is not an isolated observation but part of his broader \"pragmatic logic\" project, which aimed to analyze the practical uses of language and reasoning.\n3.  **Correct Attribution:** It is important to attribute this specific distinction to Ajdukiewicz, even though other members of the Lviv-Warsaw school, like Tadeusz Kotarbiński, also wrote about signs and actions. However, the clear-cut decomposition into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" is a signature contribution of Ajdukiewicz.\n4.  **Nature of the Sign:** The core of the distinction lies in the nature of the link between the sign and its object: causal/natural for a symptom, and conventional/rule-based for a signal.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the general notion of a sign (or hallmark) into the categories of causally-linked \"symptoms\" and conventionally-established \"signals\" is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
