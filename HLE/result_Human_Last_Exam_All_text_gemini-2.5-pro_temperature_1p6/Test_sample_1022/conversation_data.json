    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, i.e., $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the mathematical objects and the question**\n*   **Group:** $G = T \\times T$, the direct product of two copies of Thompson's group $T$.\n*   **Cohomology Theory:** Bounded cohomology, denoted $H_b^*$.\n*   **Degree:** $n=4$.\n*   **Coefficients:** Trivial real module, $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   **Goal:** Compute $\\dim_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the Künneth Theorem for Bounded Cohomology**\nFor any two discrete groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, there exists a natural linear map called the cross product, which relates the bounded cohomology of the factor groups to the bounded cohomology of their direct product. For a degree $n$, this map is:\n$$ \\times : \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}} H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\longrightarrow H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nA crucial result by N. Monod states that this cross product map is always **injective**. This has a direct consequence on dimensions:\n$$ \\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\ge \\dim \\left( \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) \\right) $$\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Künneth Theorem to $T \\times T$ for degree 4**\nIn our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and $n=4$. The domain of the cross product map is:\n$$ V = \\bigoplus_{p+q=4} H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R}) $$\nExpanding the direct sum, we get the following summands:\n*   $p=0, q=4$: $H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=1, q=3$: $H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=2, q=2$: $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=3, q=1$: $H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=4, q=0$: $H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n\n**Step 4: Use known results about the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T**\nTo analyze the dimension of the space $V$, we need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$. The following are well-established results in the field:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(G; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ for any infinite group $G$. Thompson's group $T$ is infinite.\n*   $\\dim H_b^1(G; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for any group $G$.\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$. This is a famous result, first established by S. Matsumoto. It is related to the Euler class of the action of $T$ on the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$.\n*   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$. This is a significant result by M. Burger and N. Monod, which holds for groups acting on the circle with a dense orbit, a property that $T$ possesses.\n*   The dimension of $H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R})$ is not required for this analysis.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the dimension of the domain of the cross product map**\nLet's analyze the dimension of each summand of $V$ using the information from Step 4.\n*   The terms for $(p=1, q=3)$ and $(p=3, q=1)$ are $H_b^1(T) \\otimes H_b^3(T)$ and $H_b^3(T) \\otimes H_b^1(T)$. Since $\\dim H_b^1(T) = 0$ and $\\dim H_b^3(T)=0$, these tensor products are the zero vector space and have dimension 0.\n*   The term for $(p=2, q=2)$ is $H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})$. We know that $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$. The tensor product of two infinite-dimensional vector spaces over a field is also infinite-dimensional. Therefore, $\\dim(H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R})) = \\infty$.\n\nThe dimension of the total space $V$ is the sum of the dimensions of its direct summands. Since one of the summands, $H_b^2(T) \\otimes H_b^2(T)$, has infinite dimension, the entire space $V$ is infinite-dimensional.\n$$ \\dim(V) = 2 \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T) + \\dim(H_b^2(T) \\otimes H_b^2(T)) = 2 \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T) + \\infty = \\infty $$\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\nFrom Step 2, the cross product map from $V$ into $H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$ is injective. By the rank-nullity theorem, this implies that the dimension of the target space must be at least the dimension of the source space.\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\ge \\dim(V) $$\nSince we found in Step 5 that $\\dim(V) = \\infty$, it follows that:\n$$ \\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty $$\n\nThe dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is infinite.\n\n<<<inf>>>"
