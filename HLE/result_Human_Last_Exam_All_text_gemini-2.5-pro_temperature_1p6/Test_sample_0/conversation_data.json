    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-Level Views are a type of population axiology used to evaluate the goodness of different populations. The core idea is that for a person's life to contribute positively to the total value of a population, their welfare (or utility) level must be above a certain \"critical level,\" denoted as *c*. For a population of *n* individuals with welfare levels *u_1, u_2, ..., u_n*, the total value is calculated as the sum of the differences between each person's welfare and the critical level:\n\n*   **Total Value = (u_1 - c) + (u_2 - c) + ... + (u_n - c)**\n\nWe will assume a standard critical-level view where the critical level *c* is positive (*c > 0*). This means that adding a person with a positive welfare level that is below *c* (i.e., a life worth living for the individual but below the critical threshold) will actually decrease the total value of the population, as their contribution *(u - c)* will be negative.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem and Its Conditions\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem states that no single population axiology can simultaneously satisfy a set of six seemingly reasonable conditions. To find which condition critical-level views violate, we must test them against each one.\n\nHere are the six conditions and our analysis for each:\n\n**A. Egalitarian Dominance:**\n*   **Condition Meaning:** If population A has *n* people all at the same welfare level, and population B has the same number of people (*n*), but every person in B is worse off than the people in A, then population A must be better than population B.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level View:** Let everyone in A be at level *u_A* and everyone in B be at level *u_B(i)*, where *u_B(i) < u_A* for all *i*.\n    *   Value(A) = n * (u_A - c)\n    *   Value(B) = Sum over i of (u_B(i) - c)\n    Since each *u_B(i)* is less than *u_A*, the sum of *u_B(i)* will be less than *n* * *u_A*. Therefore, the total value of B will be less than the total value of A.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n**C. Non-Elitism:**\n*   **Condition Meaning:** There is no \"elite\" level of welfare such that a small number of people at that elite level is always considered better than any arbitrarily large population of people at a slightly lower (but still very high) welfare level.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level View:** Imagine a small population A with *k* people at an \"elite\" level *u_elite*. Its value is *k* * (*u_elite* - c). Now imagine a very large population B with *N* people at a slightly lower level *u_almost_elite*. Its value is *N* * (*u_almost_elite* - c). As long as *u_almost_elite* is above the critical level *c*, its contribution (*u_almost_elite* - c) is positive. By making *N* large enough, we can always make the total value of population B greater than the total value of A. Therefore, there is no such \"elite\" level.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Non-Elitism.\n\n**D. Weak Non-Sadism:**\n*   **Condition Meaning:** Adding people whose lives are not worth living (i.e., they have negative welfare) can never make a population better.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level View:** Let's add a person with negative welfare, *u < 0*. Their contribution to the total value is *(u - c)*. Since *u* is negative and we assume *c* is positive, the term *(u - c)* is definitely negative. Adding this person will always decrease the total value of the population.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n**E. Weak Quality Addition:**\n*   **Condition Meaning:** There is at least one situation where adding a certain number of people with a certain high quality of life can make the overall population better.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level View:** This condition is easily met. We simply need to find one case where adding happy people is good. If we add people with a welfare level *u* that is greater than the critical level *c*, their contribution *(u - c)* will be positive, and the total value will increase. For example, if *c=10*, adding a person with welfare *u=11* makes the population better.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **satisfy** Weak Quality Addition.\n\n**B. General Non-Extreme Priority (also known as Strong Non-Extreme Priority):**\n*   **Condition Meaning:** For *any* initial population and for *any* positive welfare level *u > 0* (no matter how low), it is possible to make the population better by adding a sufficient number of people at that level *u*.\n*   **Analysis with Critical-Level View:** This is where the conflict arises. Let's assume a critical level of *c = 10*. The condition says we must be able to improve the world by adding people at *any* positive welfare level. Let's choose the welfare level *u = 5*. This is a positive welfare level (the person's life is worth living).\n    *   According to the critical-level view, the value added by each such person is *(u - c)* = (5 - 10) = -5.\n    *   No matter how many people we add at this level, the total value will decrease. We are adding a negative value each time.\n    *   Therefore, it is *not* possible to make the population better by adding people at this welfare level *u = 5*. Since the condition demands this be possible for *any* positive *u*, and we have found a positive *u* for which it is impossible, the condition is violated.\n*   **Conclusion:** Critical-level views **violate** General Non-Extreme Priority. This is the core feature of critical-level views that allows them to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem that critical-level views violate is General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n<<<B>>>"
