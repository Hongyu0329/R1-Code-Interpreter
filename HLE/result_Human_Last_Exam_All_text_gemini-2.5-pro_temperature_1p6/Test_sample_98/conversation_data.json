    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its orientation.**\n*   The tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical faces, where each face is an equilateral triangle. It has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n*   The tank is \"standing on one of its faces.\" This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. Consequently, there is another parallel triangular face that forms the top of the tank.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the condition of being \"half-filled\".**\n*   \"Half-filled\" means the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume of the icosahedron tank.\n*   The surface of the water in a container under gravity is always a horizontal plane (ignoring minor effects like surface tension).\n\n**Step 3: Use the symmetry of the icosahedron to determine the water level.**\n*   A key property of a regular icosahedron is that it is centrally symmetric. This means it has a center point, and for any point on the surface of the icosahedron, the point directly opposite through the center is also on the surface.\n*   Any plane that passes through this center of symmetry will divide the icosahedron into two pieces of equal volume.\n*   The icosahedron is standing on a horizontal face. Due to its symmetry, its center point is located exactly halfway up its total height (the vertical distance between the bottom face and the top face).\n*   Since the water surface must be a horizontal plane and the volume of the water is exactly half the total volume, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the center of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the shape of the water surface.**\n*   The problem is now reduced to a geometric one: What is the shape of the cross-section created by slicing an icosahedron with a plane that passes through its center and is parallel to one of its faces?\n*   Let's visualize the structure of the icosahedron in this orientation. It has a bottom triangular face and a top triangular face. Between these, the other 18 faces form the sides.\n*   If we look at the vertices, there are 3 vertices on the bottom face and 3 on the top face. The remaining 6 vertices form a \"waist\" around the middle of the icosahedron. These 6 vertices are arranged in two groups of three. Three vertices are in a horizontal plane below the center, and the other three are in a horizontal plane an equal distance above the center.\n*   The central horizontal plane (the water surface) will cut through the edges that connect the lower set of 3 \"waist\" vertices to the upper set of 3 \"waist\" vertices.\n*   There are 6 such edges forming a zig-zag pattern around the middle of the icosahedron.\n*   Because the cutting plane passes exactly through the center, it will intersect each of these 6 edges at its precise midpoint.\n*   These 6 intersection points are the vertices of the shape of the water surface. Due to the high degree of symmetry of the icosahedron (specifically, 3-fold rotational symmetry about the vertical axis combined with central symmetry), these 6 vertices will form a **regular hexagon**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhen a regular icosahedron standing on a face is filled to half its volume, the water surface forms a horizontal plane through the center of the icosahedron. The cross-section of the icosahedron at this level is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
