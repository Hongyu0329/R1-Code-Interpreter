    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases\nFirst, we must list the naturally occurring noble gases on Earth. These are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table.\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n(Oganesson is also in Group 18 but it is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth, so it is excluded from this analysis).\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Metric \"Percentage of all Terrestrial Matter\"\n\"Terrestrial matter\" refers to the mass of the Earth, including its atmosphere, hydrosphere (oceans), and lithosphere (crust and mantle). Noble gases are primarily found in the atmosphere, with some amounts trapped within the Earth's crust and mantle. The most reliable and standard way to compare their abundance is by their concentration in the Earth's atmosphere, as this is their largest accessible reservoir and their relative abundances there reflect their overall rarity. The question specifies the year 2002, but the abundance of these gases is determined by geological processes over millions of years, so their relative rarity does not change on a year-to-year basis.\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Abundance of Each Noble Gas\nLet's compare the typical atmospheric concentrations (by volume) of the noble gases from most to least abundant.\n\n1.  **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas, making up about **0.934%** (or 9,340 parts per million, ppm) of Earth's atmosphere. Its high concentration is primarily due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40 in the Earth's crust.\n2.  **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant, with a concentration of about **18.2 ppm**.\n3.  **Helium (He):** The third most abundant, with a concentration of about **5.2 ppm**. Although it is constantly produced by radioactive decay in the crust, it is very light and a significant amount escapes Earth's atmosphere into space.\n4.  **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer, with a concentration of about **1.1 ppm**.\n5.  **Xenon (Xe):** The rarest of the *stable* noble gases, with a concentration of just **0.087 ppm** (or 87 parts per billion).\n6.  **Radon (Rn):** This gas is unique in the group because it is highly radioactive. It is formed continuously from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. However, its most stable isotope (Radon-222) has a half-life of only about 3.8 days. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates in the atmosphere. Its average concentration is incredibly low and highly variable, on the order of **6 x 10⁻¹⁸ ppm** (or 1 part per quintillion).\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion on Rarity\nWhen comparing the abundances, it is clear that Xenon is extremely rare. However, Radon is vastly rarer. At any given moment, the total amount of Radon on Earth is minuscule compared to even Xenon, because it disappears almost as fast as it is created.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Stable vs. Radioactive:** The key distinction is between the stable noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), which have accumulated in the atmosphere over geological time, and the radioactive noble gas (Rn), which is in a constant state of rapid production and decay, keeping its steady-state concentration extremely low.\n*   **\"Terrestrial Matter\" Scope:** While we use atmospheric concentration for comparison, Radon would remain the rarest even if we could account for all atoms in the Earth's crust. The total mass of Radon on the entire planet at any one time is estimated to be only a few tens of grams due to its short half-life. This is far less than the mass of any other noble gas.\n*   **The Year 2002:** As noted, the geological and physical processes that govern these abundances operate on timescales of millions of years. The specific year 2002 does not change the outcome; the ranking of rarity is a fundamental characteristic of these elements on Earth.\n\nFinal analysis confirms that due to its radioactivity and extremely short half-life, Radon is by far the rarest noble gas.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
