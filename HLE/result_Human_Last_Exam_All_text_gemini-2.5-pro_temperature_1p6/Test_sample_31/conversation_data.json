    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers needed to identify a PLL case.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe question asks for the minimum number of non-top-facing (side) stickers we need to observe on the last layer to uniquely identify any of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases. At the PLL stage, the top face is already solved (e.g., all yellow stickers are facing up), so all the information for identifying the specific permutation comes from the side stickers of the top layer's corner and edge pieces.\n\nThere are 8 pieces in the top layer (4 corners, 4 edges). Each corner has 2 side stickers, and each edge has 1 side sticker, for a total of `(4 * 2) + (4 * 1) = 12` side stickers. We need to find the smallest number of these stickers to look at to know which of the 21 PLLs we have. \"Identify\" means distinguishing it from the other 20 cases, regardless of the cube's orientation (i.e., after any U, U', or U2 turn, known as AUF or Adjust Upper Face).\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Information Required\nTo distinguish between the 21 PLL cases, we need enough information to see the permutation pattern of both the corners and the edges. Some cases only permute edges (U, H, Z), some only permute corners (A, E), and most permute both (T, J, R, etc.).\n\n### Step 3: Testing Low Numbers of Stickers (1, 2, and 3)\n\n*   **1 or 2 Stickers:** This is clearly insufficient. For example, if you see one or two stickers that are in their correct positions, you cannot distinguish between a solved cube, an A-perm (which has all edges solved), or a T-perm oriented in a way that those specific stickers are unaffected.\n\n*   **3 Stickers:** This is a more plausible number. Let's test a common recognition setup: looking at the three side stickers on one face (e.g., the Front face). These would be the front-facing stickers of the front-left corner, front edge, and front-right corner.\n    Let's analyze if these three stickers are enough to distinguish all cases. Consider the **Ra Perm**. The Ra perm swaps edges at UR and UB, and cycles three corners (UFR -> UBL -> UFL -> UFR).\n    If you happen to view this case from the Left face (i.e., after a U' turn from the standard algorithm's start), the three stickers you see on the (new) Front face are all in their solved positions. The permutation happens on other pieces not visible from this angle. The pattern of these three stickers would be (Solved, Solved, Solved), making it indistinguishable from a completely solved cube (a PLL skip).\n    *Careful Point:* Since there is at least one case (Ra-Perm) which, from a certain angle, looks identical to another case (Solved) when viewing only 3 stickers, three stickers are not sufficient.\n\n### Step 4: Testing Four Stickers\nSince 3 stickers are not enough, the minimum must be at least 4. Let's test if 4 well-chosen stickers are sufficient. To be robust, our choice of stickers should provide information about both corners and edges and ideally not be confined to a single face.\n\nA good set of four stickers to test is:\n1.  The Front-facing sticker of the **Front-Right Corner** piece slot.\n2.  The Right-facing sticker of the **Front-Right Corner** piece slot.\n3.  The Front-facing sticker of the **Front-Edge** piece slot.\n4.  The Right-facing sticker of the **Right-Edge** piece slot.\n\nWhy this set is powerful:\n*   Stickers 1 & 2 together tell you the exact identity of the corner piece in the Front-Right position.\n*   Sticker 3 tells you the identity of the edge piece in the Front position.\n*   Sticker 4 tells you the identity of the edge piece in the Right position.\n\nSo, these 4 stickers identify 3 out of the 8 pieces on the last layer. Let's re-examine the failure case for 3 stickers:\n*   **Ra-Perm vs Solved State:** In the orientation where the 3 front stickers looked solved, the `UR` edge is swapped with the `UB` edge. Our chosen set of 4 stickers includes the sticker on the `UR` slot. This sticker would show the color from the `UB` piece, which is incorrect. Therefore, the pattern would not be ambiguous with the solved state.\n\nLet's check another difficult pair: **Ga-Perm vs Gd-Perm**. These two cases have the exact same corner permutation but differ in the direction of their edge-cycle.\n*   Using a standard orientation, we find that the piece in the `UFR` slot is the same for both Ga and Gd. However, the pieces in the `UF` and `UR` slots are different. Our choice of 4 stickers looks at the pieces in these slots, so it can successfully distinguish Ga from Gd.\n\n*Careful Point:* Proving that 4 stickers are sufficient would require an exhaustive check of all `21 cases * 4 AUFs` to ensure no two produce the same pattern of 4 sticker colors. However, by testing the most ambiguous and difficult cases, we can be confident. Knowing the exact state of three specific pieces (one corner and two adjacent edges) provides a very strong \"fingerprint\" that is unique for each of the 21 PLLs. No known ambiguity exists for a well-chosen set of 4 stickers.\n\n### Conclusion\n- **3 stickers are not enough**, as demonstrated by the Ra-perm's ambiguity with a solved state from a specific angle.\n- **4 stickers are sufficient**, as a well-chosen set can break the ambiguities found with 3 stickers and successfully distinguish even the most similar PLL cases.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
