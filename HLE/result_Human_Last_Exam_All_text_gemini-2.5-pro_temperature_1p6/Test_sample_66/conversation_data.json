    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Matrix Representation\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-hoist (top-left) corner. Within the white canton, there is a red couped cross. A couped cross is one that does not extend to the edges of the area it is in.\n\nWe form a matrix `M` from an image of this flag.\n- Red pixels are assigned the value `a`.\n- White pixels are assigned the value `b`.\n\nLet the image be discretized into an `m x n` matrix `M`. The canton occupies the top-left `m_c x n_c` submatrix.\n- The pixels corresponding to the red field all have the value `a`.\n- The pixels in the canton are either `a` (for the red cross) or `b` (for the white background).\n\nWe want to find the *maximal possible* rank, so we can choose the values of `a` and `b`, and the pixel dimensions `m, n, m_c, n_c`, and the specific shape of the cross to our advantage. To get a non-trivial matrix, we assume `a != b`.\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Matrix Using Row Operations\nThe rank of a matrix is invariant under elementary row and column operations.\nLet's analyze the structure of `M`. Most of the matrix is filled with the value `a`. Specifically, all rows from `m_c + 1` to `m` are entirely composed of `a`'s: `[a, a, ..., a]`. All columns from `n_c + 1` to `n` have `a` in all their entries.\n\nLet's assume `a != 0`. We can perform a row operation to simplify the matrix. Let `R_i` be the i-th row of `M`. The last row, `R_m`, is `[a, a, ..., a]`.\nWe create a new matrix `M'` by replacing `R_i` with `R_i' = R_i - R_m` for `i = 1, ..., m-1`, and keeping `R_m' = R_m`. This does not change the rank.\n\n1.  For `m_c < i < m`, the row `R_i` is also `[a, a, ..., a]`. So, `R_i' = R_i - R_m = [0, 0, ..., 0]`. These rows are all zero.\n2.  The last row remains `R_m' = [a, a, ..., a]`.\n3.  For `1 <= i <= m_c` (rows in the canton), `R_i` contains `a`s and `b`s in the first `n_c` columns and `a`s for the remaining `n - n_c` columns.\n    `R_i' = R_i - R_m`. The entries of `R_i'` are:\n    - For `j > n_c`: `M_{ij}' = M_{ij} - M_{mj} = a - a = 0`.\n    - For `j <= n_c`: `M_{ij}' = M_{ij} - M_{mj} = M_{ij} - a`.\n        - If pixel `(i,j)` was red (`a`), `M_{ij}' = a - a = 0`.\n        - If pixel `(i,j)` was white (`b`), `M_{ij}' = b - a`.\n\nSo, the transformed matrix `M'` has the following structure:\n```\nM' = [ (b-a)E_c   |   0   ]\n     [      0        |   0   ]\n     [ a, a, ..., a  | a,..,a]\n```\nwhere `E_c` is an `m_c x n_c` matrix that is 1 for white pixels in the canton and 0 for red pixels (the cross). The block of zeros below `(b-a)E_c` has `m - m_c - 1` rows.\n\nThe first `m_c` rows of `M'` are non-zero only in the first `n_c` columns. The last row is non-zero across all columns (assuming `a!=0` and `n>n_c`). Therefore, the last row is linearly independent of the first `m-1` rows.\nThe rank of `M` is the rank of `M'`, which is the sum of the ranks of the top-left block and the rank contribution from the last row.\n`rank(M) = rank((b-a)E_c) + 1`.\nSince `b != a`, `rank((b-a)E_c) = rank(E_c)`.\nSo, `rank(M) = rank(E_c) + 1`.\n\nThis holds if `a != 0`. If we choose `a=0`, then `M` has non-zero entries (`b`) only in the canton region `E_c`. In that case, `rank(M) = rank(bE_c) = rank(E_c)`.\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose `a != 0`, which allows for a rank of `rank(E_c) + 1`.\n\n### Step 3: Finding the Maximal Rank of the Canton Matrix `E_c`\nNow the problem is reduced to finding the maximal possible rank of `E_c`. `E_c` is a binary matrix with 1s for white areas and 0s for the red cross. The cross is couped, so it's a hole inside a field of 1s.\n\n`E_c = J - X_c`, where `J` is the `m_c x n_c` matrix of all ones, and `X_c` is the indicator matrix for the red cross.\nThe rank of `E_c` depends on the geometric shape of the cross. Let the cross be formed by the union of a horizontal bar and a vertical bar.\n- Horizontal bar: occupies rows `I_H` and columns `J_H`.\n- Vertical bar: occupies rows `I_V` and columns `J_V`.\n\nThe matrix `X_c` has `1`s on the cross and `0`s elsewhere. Let's analyze its rows. There are four types of rows in `X_c`, based on which part of the cross they intersect:\n1.  A row `i` outside the cross vertically (`i \\notin I_H \\cup I_V`): This row is all zeros.\n2.  A row `i` in the horizontal bar but not the vertical (`i \\in I_H \\setminus I_V`): This row has `1`s in columns `J_H`.\n3.  A row `i` in the vertical bar but not the horizontal (`i \\in I_V \\setminus I_H`): This row has `1`s in columns `J_V`.\n4.  A row `i` in the intersection of both bars (`i \\in I_H \\cap I_V`): This row has `1`s in columns `J_H \\cup J_V`.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose a cross shape where these row types are distinct and span a space of the highest possible dimension. Let `w_H`, `w_V`, and `w_{H \\cup V}` be the indicator vectors for the column sets `J_H`, `J_V`, and `J_H \\cup J_V` respectively. The row space of `X_c` is spanned by these three vectors. If these vectors are linearly independent, `rank(X_c)=3`. This independence can be achieved by choosing the column sets appropriately (e.g., ensuring `J_H \\setminus J_V`, `J_V \\setminus J_H`, and `J_H \\cap J_V` are all non-empty).\n\nNow consider the rows of `E_c = J - X_c`:\n1.  If row `i` of `X_c` is `0`, the row of `E_c` is `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (let's call this vector `u^T`).\n2.  If row `i` of `X_c` is `w_H^T`, the row of `E_c` is `u^T - w_H^T`.\n3.  If row `i` of `X_c` is `w_V^T`, the row of `E_c` is `u^T - w_V^T`.\n4.  If row `i` of `X_c` is `w_{H \\cup V}^T`, the row of `E_c` is `u^T - w_{H \\cup V}^T`.\n\nThe row space of `E_c` is therefore `span({u^T, u^T - w_H^T, u^T - w_V^T, u^T - w_{H \\cup V}^T})`.\nThis is equivalent to `span({u^T, w_H^T, w_V^T, w_{H \\cup V}^T})`.\n\nCan these four vectors be linearly independent? Yes, if we design the cross geometry carefully.\n- The vectors `w_H`, `w_V`, `w_{H \\cup V}` can be made linearly independent as shown above.\n- The vector `u` (all ones) is linearly independent of the others if the cross does not cover all columns, which is true for a couped cross.\n\nTherefore, we can construct a cross such that the row space of `E_c` is spanned by four linearly independent vectors. This can be achieved if the sets of rows `I_H \\setminus I_V`, `I_V \\setminus I_H`, `I_H \\cap I_V`, and the rows outside the cross are all non-empty (and similarly for the columns). A non-symmetric cross allows for this. For example:\n- Canton size: `10x10`.\n- H-bar: rows `I_H = {3,4}`, V-bar: rows `I_V = {4,5}`. This ensures `I_H \\setminus I_V`, `I_V \\setminus I_H`, and `I_H \\cap I_V` are all non-empty.\n- Similar non-overlapping column choices for `J_H` and `J_V`.\n- Since the cross is couped, there are rows and columns outside the cross.\n\nThis construction yields `rank(E_c) = 4`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nThe maximal rank of `E_c` is 4.\nThe maximal rank of `M` is given by `rank(M) = rank(E_c) + 1`, assuming `a \\ne 0`.\nMaximal rank of `M` = `4 + 1 = 5`.\n\nTo be certain this is the maximum, we check the case `a = 0`. This yields `rank(M) = rank(E_c) = 4`.\nSince we can choose the values `a` and `b`, we can choose `a=1` and `b=2` (or any `a\\ne 0, b\\ne a`), which results in a rank of 5.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank is 5."
