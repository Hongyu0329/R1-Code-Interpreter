    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Define Key Terms\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three specific conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, a crystal class is achiral if its point group contains at least one improper rotation axis ($S_n$), which includes a center of inversion ($i$ or $\\bar{1}$) or a mirror plane ($m$).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal class does not have a unique directional axis. For any direction in the crystal, there is a symmetry operation that transforms it into its opposite or an equivalent direction. All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar, but some non-centrosymmetric classes can also be non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** This is the most critical and subtle part of the question.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Symmetry for Optical Activity\"\n\n*   **Physical Definition of Optical Activity:** Optical activity is the phenomenon where a substance rotates the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light. This is caused by circular birefringence, meaning that left- and right-circularly polarized light travel at different speeds. This physical phenomenon is strictly forbidden in any crystal structure that is achiral. If a crystal has a mirror plane or a center of inversion, it cannot exhibit optical activity. Following this strict physical definition, no achiral crystal class can be optically active, so the answer would be \"none\".\n\n*   **Mathematical/Tensoral Definition:** The potential for optical activity and related spatial dispersion effects is described by the **gyration tensor**, $g_{ij}$. This is a second-rank axial tensor. A crystal class is said to \"have the correct symmetry\" if the symmetry operations of its point group do not require all components of the gyration tensor to be zero ($g_{ij} \\neq 0$). The question's wording, \"have the correct symmetry for\", points towards this mathematical condition rather than the strictly observable physical phenomenon. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Crystal Classes with Non-Zero Gyration Tensors\n\nWe must find all crystal classes where the gyration tensor, $g_{ij}$, is not identically zero. By applying Neumann's principle to the gyration tensor for all 32 point groups, we find that the following 15 classes allow for non-zero components (Note: some sources vary slightly based on definitions, but this list is standard based on tensor analysis):\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, **$\\bar{4}$**, **$\\bar{4}2m$**, **$\\bar{4}3m$**, and *mm2*.\n(Note: Most authoritative sources like Nye's \"Physical Properties of Crystals\" show the tensor for *mm2* is zero. We will follow Nye's classification, which omits *mm2*).\n\nThe definitive list from authoritative texts like Nye's includes 14 classes where $g_{ij} \\neq 0$:\n*   The 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432\n*   Three additional achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{4}3m$\n\n### Step 4: Apply the \"Achiral\" Constraint\n\nThe question requires the classes to be **achiral**. From our list of 14 classes, we must eliminate those that are chiral.\n*   The 11 classes (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432) are chiral by definition. We discard these.\n*   This leaves us with the candidate classes: **$\\bar{4}$**, **$\\bar{4}2m$**, and **$\\bar{4}3m$**.\n*   We confirm these are achiral:\n    *   $\\bar{4}$ contains an $S_4$ improper rotation axis. It is achiral.\n    *   $\\bar{4}2m$ contains mirror planes. It is achiral.\n    *   $\\bar{4}3m$ contains mirror planes. It is achiral.\n\n### Step 5: Apply the \"Non-polar\" Constraint\n\nNow we must check if our three candidate classes ($\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, $\\bar{4}3m$) are **non-polar**. A polar class possesses a unique directional axis. The 10 polar crystal classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\n*   Is class **$\\bar{4}$** polar? No, it is not on the list of polar classes. It is non-polar.\n*   Is class **$\\bar{4}2m$** polar? No, it is not on the list. The presence of perpendicular 2-fold axes prevents any axis from being polar. It is non-polar.\n*   Is class **$\\bar{4}3m$** polar? No, it is a high-symmetry cubic class and is not on the list. It is non-polar.\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity (interpreted as possessing a non-zero gyration tensor) are the ones that satisfy all conditions from our analysis.\n\nThe classes are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, and $\\bar{4}3m$.\n\n<<<The crystal classes are $\\bar{4}$, $\\bar{4}2m$, and $\\bar{4}3m$.>>>"
