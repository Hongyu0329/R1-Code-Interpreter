    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n1.  **Calabi-Yau Hypersurface in Weighted Projective Space:** The problem describes a Calabi-Yau variety defined by a single polynomial equation $P(z_1, ..., z_5)=0$ in the weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$.\n2.  **Weighted Homogeneous Polynomial:** For the equation to define a hypersurface in weighted projective space, the polynomial $P$ must be weighted homogeneous. This means that every monomial in the polynomial must have the same weighted degree, $d$. The degree of a monomial $z_1^{a_1} z_2^{a_2} z_3^{a_3} z_4^{a_4} z_5^{a_5}$ is given by $\\sum_{i=1}^5 a_i w_i$.\n3.  **Calabi-Yau Condition:** A key property for a hypersurface $X_d \\subset \\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$ to be Calabi-Yau is that its degree $d$ must equal the sum of the weights: $d = \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i$.\n4.  **Crawley-Nordström (CN) Invariant:** This invariant for a quasi-smooth hypersurface $X_d$ in $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)$ is defined as the ratio of the degree $d$ to the least common multiple (lcm) of the weights:\n    $$ CN(X_d) = \\frac{d}{\\text{lcm}(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5)} $$\n\n### **Step 2: Determine the Degree `d` of the Polynomial**\n\nWe are given the weights $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$ and the polynomial $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$. Let's calculate the weighted degree of each monomial.\n\n*   **Monomial 1: $z_1^8z_3$**: Degree = $8 \\cdot w_1 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   **Monomial 2: $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$**: Degree = $4 \\cdot w_1 + 3 \\cdot w_2 + 1 \\cdot w_3 = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   **Monomial 3: $z_1z_2^7$**: Degree = $1 \\cdot w_1 + 7 \\cdot w_2 = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   **Monomial 4: $z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5$**: Degree = $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22+29+49+50+75 = 225$.\n*   **Monomial 5: $z_2z_3^4$**: Degree = $1 \\cdot w_2 + 4 \\cdot w_3 = 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   **Monomial 6: $z_4^3z_5$**: Degree = $3 \\cdot w_4 + 1 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   **Monomial 7: $z_5^3$**: Degree = $3 \\cdot w_5 = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We observe that all monomials have a weighted degree of 225, except for the second monomial, $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$, which has a degree of 224. For the polynomial to be well-defined in weighted projective space, it must be homogeneous. Furthermore, the problem states this represents a Calabi-Yau link, which implies the Calabi-Yau condition must hold. Let's check this condition:\n\nSum of weights = $w_1+w_2+w_3+w_4+w_5 = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n\nSince the Calabi-Yau condition requires $d = \\sum w_i$, the degree of the polynomial must be $d=225$. This confirms that the second monomial in the question is a typo and the correct degree of the defining polynomial is 225.\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Least Common Multiple (lcm) of the Weights**\n\nThe weights are $(22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$. We find their prime factorization to compute the lcm.\n\n*   $22 = 2 \\times 11$\n*   $29 = 29$ (a prime number)\n*   $49 = 7^2$\n*   $50 = 2 \\times 5^2$\n*   $75 = 3 \\times 5^2$\n\nThe lcm is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present:\n$lcm = 2^1 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11^1 \\times 29^1$\n$lcm = 2 \\times 3 \\times 25 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$lcm = 6 \\times 25 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$lcm = 150 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$lcm = 7350 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n$lcm = 80850 \\times 29$\n$lcm = 2,344,650$\n\n### **Step 4: Compute the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n\nNow we can apply the formula for the CN invariant.\n\n*   Degree $d = 225$\n*   lcm of weights = 2,344,650\n\n$CN = \\frac{d}{lcm} = \\frac{225}{2,344,650}$\n\nFinally, we simplify the fraction. We use the prime factorizations from our previous steps.\n\n*   $d = 225 = 9 \\times 25 = 3^2 \\times 5^2$\n*   $lcm = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11 \\times 29$\n\n$CN = \\frac{3^2 \\times 5^2}{2 \\times 3 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11 \\times 29}$\n\nCancel the common factors ($3$ and $5^2$):\n\n$CN = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 7^2 \\times 11 \\times 29}$\n$CN = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 49 \\times 11 \\times 29}$\n$CN = \\frac{3}{98 \\times 11 \\times 29}$\n$CN = \\frac{3}{1078 \\times 29}$\n$CN = \\frac{3}{31262}$\n\nThe fraction cannot be simplified further as 3 is prime and the denominator $31262 = 3+1+2+6+2 = 14$, which is not divisible by 3.\n\nThe final answer is the fraction $\\frac{3}{31262}$.\n\n<<<3/31262>>>"
