    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, including careful points, leading to the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Context**\n\nThe question is set in the framework of **finite-temperature quantum field theory**. This is typically studied using the **imaginary time formalism**, also known as the Matsubara formalism.\n\n*   **Key Idea:** The partition function $Z$ of a quantum system at temperature $T$ is given by $Z = \\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H})$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian and $\\beta = 1/T$ (with $k_B=1$). This is mathematically analogous to quantum mechanical evolution in imaginary time, $t \\to -i\\tau$, for a duration of $\\beta$.\n*   **Functional Integral:** For a field theory, the partition function can be expressed as a functional integral (or path integral) over all possible field configurations $\\phi$. For a neutral scalar field, this is:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** The weight of each field configuration in the integral is determined by the Euclidean action, $S_E$. This is obtained from the standard Minkowskian action by performing a Wick rotation to imaginary time ($\\tau = it$). The integration is over a Euclidean spacetime volume, where the imaginary time dimension is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta$.\n*   **Periodicity:** For a bosonic field like a neutral scalar, the field configurations must be periodic in imaginary time: $\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\mathbf{x})$.\n\n**Step 2: The Euclidean Action for a Neutral Scalar Field**\n\nThe standard Euclidean action for a free, massive, neutral scalar field is given by:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is the Euclidean Lagrangian density:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2 \\phi^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\tau})^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 \\right) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\nHere, $\\mu$ runs over the $d+1$ Euclidean dimensions $(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$.\n\n**Step 3: Rewriting the Action and Identifying the Operator**\n\nTo analyze the structure of the action, we can use integration by parts on the kinetic term, $\\int (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$.\n$\\int d^{d+1}x \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\left[ \\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial^2 \\phi) \\right]$\nThe first term is a total derivative. The integral of this term becomes a boundary term.\n*   The spatial part vanishes if we assume the fields $\\phi$ go to zero at spatial infinity.\n*   The time part gives $\\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, [\\phi \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\tau}]_0^\\beta$. Due to the periodicity condition $\\phi(\\beta, \\mathbf{x}) = \\phi(0, \\mathbf{x})$, this boundary term also vanishes.\n\nTherefore, the action can be rewritten as:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^{d+1}x \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}\\phi(\\partial^2\\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\nwhere $\\partial^2 = \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} + \\nabla^2$ is the Euclidean Laplacian operator.\n\n**Step 4: Defining and Calculating the Inner Product**\n\nThe notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ represents an inner product.\n*   **The Inner Product:** For the space of real scalar fields over Euclidean spacetime, the standard $L^2$ inner product between two fields, $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$, is defined as:\n    $(\\psi_1, \\psi_2) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\psi_1(x) \\psi_2(x)$\n*   **The Operator:** By comparing the rewritten action $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int \\phi (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi$ with the general quadratic form $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, we can identify the operator $D$. The notation $D_\\phi$ is a slightly unconventional but understandable way of writing $D\\phi$, the result of the operator $D$ acting on the field $\\phi$. The operator is the **Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator**:\n    $D = -\\partial^2 + m^2 = -\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2$\n*   **Calculation:** Now we can explicitly write down the expression for $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) [D\\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})]$\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2\\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\n\n**Step 5: Relation to the Euclidean Action**\n\nFrom Step 3, we found that:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\nAnd from Step 4, we have:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^{d+1}x \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nBy direct comparison, we see a simple and fundamental relationship:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = 2 S_E[\\phi]$\nThis means the inner product in question is simply **twice the free Euclidean action** for the field configuration $\\phi$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Free vs. Interacting Theory:** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ refers to a quadratic form. This corresponds to the kinetic and mass terms of the theory (the \"free\" part). If there were interaction terms (e.g., $\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$), the full action would be $S_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi) + S_{\\text{int}}[\\phi]$. The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ still refers to just the free part, which defines the Gaussian measure of the functional integral.\n2.  **Operator Notation:** The notation $D_\\phi$ is understood to mean $D\\phi$, where $D$ is a linear differential operator that does not depend on $\\phi$ in a free theory.\n3.  **Physical Meaning:** The term $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is the quantity in the exponent of the Gaussian part of the functional integral ($e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi,D\\phi)}$). The operator $D$ is of central importance, as its inverse, $D^{-1}$, is the propagator (or Green's function) of the field.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ for a neutral scalar field in the functional integral is given by the expression:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_{0}^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2\\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\nThis quantity is equal to twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi]$. It can also be written in its original form (before integration by parts) as:\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_{0}^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial\\tau}\\right)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2 + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi,D_\\phi)$ is the quadratic part of the action that appears in the exponent of the functional integral. It is explicitly given by the integral of $\\phi$ against the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator acting on $\\phi$, which is equal to twice the free Euclidean action $S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi]$. The mathematical expression is: $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_{0}^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\tau^2} - \\nabla^2 + m^2\\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = 2S_{E, \\text{free}}[\\phi]$.>>>"
