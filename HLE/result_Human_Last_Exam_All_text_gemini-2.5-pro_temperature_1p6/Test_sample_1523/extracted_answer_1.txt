The inner product $(\phi,D_\phi)$ is the quadratic part of the action that appears in the exponent of the functional integral. It is explicitly given by the integral of $\phi$ against the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator acting on $\phi$, which is equal to twice the free Euclidean action $S_{E, \text{free}}[\phi]$. The mathematical expression is: $(\phi, D_\phi) = \int_{0}^{\beta} d\tau \int d^d\mathbf{x} \, \phi(\tau, \mathbf{x}) \left(-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial \tau^2} - \nabla^2 + m^2\right) \phi(\tau, \mathbf{x}) = 2S_{E, \text{free}}[\phi]$.
