    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Integral**\nThe given integral is:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\nThis integral is in the form of ∫ (u'(x)/u(x)) dx, where u(x) = F₃(x).\nThe antiderivative of u'(x)/u(x) is ln|u(x)|.\nTherefore, the antiderivative of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) is ln|F₃(x)|.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nTo evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 1, we apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n∫[a to b] f(x) dx = G(b) - G(a), where G(x) is the antiderivative of f(x).\n\nSo, V = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n**Step 3: Define and Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits**\nFirst, let's write out the full expression for F₃(x):\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nNow, we evaluate F₃(x) at x = 0 and x = 1.\n\n*   **Evaluate F₃(0):**\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))\n    Since sin(0) = 0,\n    F₃(0) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Evaluate F₃(1):**\n    F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n**Step 4: Check the sign of F₃(x) and simplify the expression for V**\nWe need to determine if the absolute value bars are necessary. Let's analyze the value of F₃(x) on the interval [0, 1].\n*   The angle x is in radians. For x ∈ [0, 1], sin(x) ranges from sin(0)=0 to sin(1)≈0.84.\n*   So, sin(x) ≥ 0 on this interval.\n*   This means e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1.\n*   Then, 1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2.\n*   Finally, F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))) ≥ ln(2).\n*   Since ln(2) ≈ 0.693, F₃(x) is always positive on the interval [0, 1].\n*   Therefore, we can remove the absolute value signs.\n\nThe expression for V becomes:\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nSubstituting the values we found:\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), we get:\nV = ln[ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the Numerical Value of V**\nWe need to use a calculator to find the numerical value of V. (Ensure the calculator is in radian mode for the sine function).\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.3197769\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.3197769\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.3197769) ≈ 1.2001206  (This is F₃(1))\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.69314718  (This is F₃(0))\n\nNow, substitute these into the expression for V:\nV = ln[ 1.2001206 / 0.69314718 ]\nV = ln(1.731406)\nV ≈ 0.548946\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.548946 = 5489.46\n\nThe closest integer to 5489.46 is 5489.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n1.  Recognizing the integral's form ∫(u'/u) dx and its antiderivative ln|u|.\n2.  Correctly applying the limits of integration using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n3.  Carefully composing the functions to find the expression for F₃(x).\n4.  Checking the domain and range of the functions involved to ensure F₃(x) is positive, allowing the removal of absolute value signs.\n5.  Using radians, not degrees, for the trigonometric function sin(1).\n6.  Correctly applying logarithm properties to simplify the final expression.\n7.  Performing the numerical calculation with sufficient precision.\n8.  Rounding the final result (10000 * V) to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nV = ln[ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ] ≈ 0.5489463\n10000 * V ≈ 5489.463\nThe closest integer is 5489.\n\n<<<5489>>>"
