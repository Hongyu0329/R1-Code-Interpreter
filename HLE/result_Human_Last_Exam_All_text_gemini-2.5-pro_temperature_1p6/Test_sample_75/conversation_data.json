    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the \"Second Great War\"**: The term \"Second Great War\" is used by the StarCraft community and in lore summaries to describe the massive, sector-wide conflict that begins after the end of the original StarCraft game. It encompasses the events of the *Brood War* expansion and the entire *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*).\n\n2.  **Identify the Starting Point**: The war is considered to have started with the events of the *Brood War* expansion. This conflict began with the arrival of the United Earth Directorate (UED) in the Koprulu Sector and the subsequent rise of Sarah Kerrigan as the undisputed leader of the Zerg Swarm. According to the official StarCraft timeline, these events begin in the year **2500**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Ending Point**: The war concludes at the end of the *StarCraft II* saga. The final, decisive event is the permanent defeat of the fallen Xel'naga, Amon, by the combined forces of the Terran, Protoss, and Zerg. This climactic event takes place in the epilogue campaign of *Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void\". These events occur in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Duration**: To find out how long the war was, we need to calculate the time elapsed between the start year (2500) and the end year (2506).\n    *   The conflict spans the years 2500, 2501, 2502, 2503, 2504, 2505, and 2506.\n    *   The conflict does not begin on the first day of 2500 and end on the last day of 2506. The *Brood War* events begin early in 2500, and the final battle against Amon happens later in 2506.\n    *   This means the war's duration is greater than 6 full years but not quite 7 full years. For example, a start in February 2500 and an end in October 2506 would be a duration of 6 years and 8 months.\n\n5.  **Apply the Rounding Instruction**: The question asks for the duration \"in years, rounded up\". This means we must take the calculated duration and round it up to the next whole number.\n    *   Since the war lasted for a period of approximately 6.x years (e.g., 6 years and several months), applying the \"round up\" instruction (also known as the ceiling function) gives us a final answer of 7 years. Any duration over a whole number of years must be rounded up to the next year.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe Second Great War started in the year 2500 with the Brood War and ended in the year 2506 with the defeat of Amon. This gives the conflict a duration of roughly 6 and a half years. Rounding this figure up to the nearest whole year results in 7 years.\n\n<<<7>>>"
