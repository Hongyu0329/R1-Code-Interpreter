    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the major allotropes of phosphorus.**\nPhosphorus is renowned for existing in multiple allotropic forms, which are different structural modifications of the element. The most well-known and scientifically recognized allotropes are:\n*   White Phosphorus\n*   Red Phosphorus\n*   Violet (Hittorf's) Phosphorus\n*   Black Phosphorus\n*   Blue Phosphorus (a more recently discovered 2D form)\n\nIn addition to these, some sources also describe other forms like scarlet phosphorus, which can be considered a variant of red phosphorus.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the specific color of each allotrope.**\n\n*   **White Phosphorus ($P_4$):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** The purest form of this molecular allotrope is a translucent, waxy solid that is colorless or **white**.\n    *   **Careful Point:** White phosphorus is highly reactive and unstable. Upon exposure to light or gentle heating, it begins to convert into the more stable red phosphorus. This conversion imparts a distinct **yellow** color to the substance. This form is so common that it is often referred to as \"yellow phosphorus.\"\n    *   Therefore, for the $P_4$ allotrope, two distinct colors can be observed: white and yellow.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a polymeric form where $P_4$ tetrahedra are linked together, forming an amorphous network. Its characteristic color is **red**. The exact hue can vary from orange-red to a dark, purplish-red depending on factors like particle size and preparation method.\n\n*   **Scarlet Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a specific form of amorphous phosphorus prepared by exposing a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide to sunlight. While structurally similar to red phosphorus, it is distinguished by its bright **scarlet** color and higher chemical reactivity. As the question asks for the number of *colors* that can be observed, and \"scarlet\" is a distinct color associated with a specific form, it should be counted separately.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a crystalline, polymeric allotrope with a complex, tubular structure. As its name implies, it has a distinct **violet** (or deep purple) color.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus under standard conditions. It possesses a layered, puckered structure similar to graphite. It is a semiconductor and has a **black**, flaky appearance with a metallic luster.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope, an analogue of graphene, that was first predicted theoretically and has since been synthesized. When prepared as a monolayer or few layers on a substrate, it exhibits a **blue** color.\n\n**Step 3: List and count all the distinct observable colors.**\n\nBy collating the colors identified in Step 2, we get the following list of distinct colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus or their common, well-defined forms:\n1.  **White** (from pure white phosphorus)\n2.  **Yellow** (from light-exposed white phosphorus)\n3.  **Red** (from common red phosphorus)\n4.  **Scarlet** (from scarlet phosphorus)\n5.  **Violet** (from Hittorf's phosphorus)\n6.  **Black** (from black phosphorus)\n7.  **Blue** (from blue phosphorus)\n\nCounting these distinct colors gives a total of 7.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nBased on the step-by-step analysis of the colors of the various well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus, we have identified seven distinct colors.\n\n<<<7>>>"
