    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Parametric Curve:**\n    The curve is defined in a piecewise manner based on the parameter `t`. We need to analyze each piece separately to understand the overall shape.\n\n    *   **Part 1: For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$**\n        *   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b\\sin t$ with $b=1$.\n        *   So, $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.\n        *   These are the standard parametric equations for a circle. Since $t$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, this traces the upper half of the unit circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ (where $y \\ge 0$).\n        *   Let's find the range of x and y values for this part:\n            *   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0)=1$ to $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$. The range for x is $[-1, 1]$.\n            *   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t$ goes from $\\sin(0)=0$ up to $\\sin(\\pi/2)=1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi)=0$. The range for y is $[0, 1]$.\n\n    *   **Part 2: For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$**\n        *   The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = b\\sin t$ with $b=5$.\n        *   So, $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$.\n        *   These are parametric equations for an ellipse. We can see this by noting that $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. The equation is $x^2 + \\frac{y^2}{25} = 1$.\n        *   Since $t$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, the value of $\\sin t$ is less than or equal to 0, which means $y = 5\\sin t$ is also less than or equal to 0. This part of the curve traces the lower half of the ellipse (where $y \\le 0$).\n        *   Let's find the range of x and y values for this part:\n            *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi)=1$. The range for x is $[-1, 1]$.\n            *   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5\\sin t$ goes from $5\\sin(\\pi)=0$ down to $5\\sin(3\\pi/2)=-5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi)=0$. The range for y is $[-5, 0]$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Overall Bounding Box of the Figure:**\n    To find the smallest square that contains the figure, we first need to find the overall minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire shape. We do this by combining the ranges from both parts.\n    *   **X-dimension:** The x-values for the whole figure range from $\\min(-1, -1) = -1$ to $\\max(1, 1) = 1$.\n        *   $x_{min} = -1$\n        *   $x_{max} = 1$\n        *   The total width of the figure is $x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n    *   **Y-dimension:** The y-values for the whole figure range from $\\min(0, -5) = -5$ to $\\max(1, 0) = 1$.\n        *   $y_{min} = -5$\n        *   $y_{max} = 1$\n        *   The total height of the figure is $y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Circumscribing Square:**\n    The figure is contained within a rectangle defined by $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $y \\in [-5, 1]$. This rectangle has a width of 2 and a height of 6. A square that circumscribes (or \"outcircles\") this figure must have a side length that is at least as large as the largest dimension of the figure.\n    *   Side length of the square = $\\max(\\text{width}, \\text{height})$\n    *   Side length = $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area of the Square:**\n    The area of a square is the square of its side length.\n    *   Area = (Side length)$^2$\n    *   Area = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Recognize that the curve is piecewise, with different definitions for `b` over different intervals of `t`.\n*   Correctly identify the shapes traced by each part: an upper semi-circle and a lower semi-ellipse.\n*   The \"smallest square that outcircles the figure\" is understood to be the smallest axis-aligned square that encloses the figure. Its side length is determined by the larger of the figure's total width and total height.\n*   Calculate the width ($x_{max} - x_{min}$) and height ($y_{max} - y_{min}$) by considering the full range of `t`.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe maximum extent of the figure is 2 units in the x-direction (from -1 to 1) and 6 units in the y-direction (from -5 to 1). To enclose this figure in a square, the side of the square must be at least 6 units long. The smallest such square has a side length of 6. The area is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
