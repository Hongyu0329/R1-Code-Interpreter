    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**1. Understand the Correspondence**\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$, where $\\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k > 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^k \\lambda_i = n$. Each partition corresponds to a unique Young diagram.\n\n**2. Dimension Formula**\nThe dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, denoted $d_\\lambda$, can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$ (the number of boxes to its right, plus the number of boxes below it, plus the box itself).\n\n**3. Strategy for Finding Irreps with Small Dimensions**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ tends to be small for partitions that are \"far from the center\" in the lattice of partitions. These are partitions with a very large first part or a very long first column. These are often called \"skewed\" or \"unbalanced\" partitions. We will systematically check families of such partitions.\n\nFor any partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ (obtained by flipping the Young diagram across the main diagonal) corresponds to an irrep with the same dimension, $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate ($\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$), the pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ accounts for two distinct irreps. If $\\lambda$ is self-conjugate, it accounts for only one irrep.\n\n**4. Analyzing Families of Partitions for n=25**\n\n**Family A: Partitions with at most two rows, $\\lambda = (25-k, k)$ with $k \\le 12$.**\nThe dimension is given by $d_{(n-k, k)} = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$:\n*   $k=0$: $\\lambda=(25)$. $d_{(25)} = \\binom{25}{0} = 1$. Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$. Pair: $\\{(25), (1^{25})\\}$, $d=1$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=1$: $\\lambda=(24,1)$. $d_{(24,1)} = \\binom{25}{1}-\\binom{25}{0} = 24$. Its conjugate is $(2,1^{23})$. Pair: $\\{(24,1), (2,1^{23})\\}$, $d=24$. This gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=2$: $\\lambda=(23,2)$. $d_{(23,2)} = \\binom{25}{2}-\\binom{25}{1} = 300 - 25 = 275$. Conjugate: $(2^2,1^{21})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=3$: $\\lambda=(22,3)$. $d_{(22,3)} = \\binom{25}{3}-\\binom{25}{2} = 2300 - 300 = 2000$. Conjugate: $(2^3,1^{19})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=4$: $\\lambda=(21,4)$. $d_{(21,4)} = \\binom{25}{4}-\\binom{25}{3} = 12650 - 2300 = 10350$. Conjugate: $(2^4,1^{17})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=5$: $\\lambda=(20,5)$. $d_{(20,5)} = \\binom{25}{5}-\\binom{25}{4} = 53130 - 12650 = 40480$. Conjugate: $(2^5,1^{15})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=6$: $\\lambda=(19,6)$. $d_{(19,6)} = \\binom{25}{6}-\\binom{25}{5} = 177100 - 53130 = 123970$. Conjugate: $(2^6,1^{13})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=7$: $\\lambda=(18,7)$. $d_{(18,7)} = \\binom{25}{7}-\\binom{25}{6} = 480700 - 177100 = 303600$. Conjugate: $(2^7,1^{11})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=8$: $\\lambda=(17,8)$. $d_{(17,8)} = \\binom{25}{8}-\\binom{25}{7} = 1081575 - 480700 = 600875$. This is > 500,000.\nThis family provides $8 \\times 2 = 16$ irreps.\n\n**Family B: Hook-shaped partitions, $\\lambda = (25-k, 1^k)$.**\nThe dimension is given by $d_{(n-k, 1^k)} = \\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$:\n*   $k=0$: $\\lambda=(25)$. Already counted.\n*   $k=1$: $\\lambda=(24,1)$. Already counted.\n*   $k=2$: $\\lambda=(23,1^2)$. $d = \\binom{24}{2} = 276$. Conjugate: $(3,1^{22})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=3$: $\\lambda=(22,1^3)$. $d = \\binom{24}{3} = 2024$. Conjugate: $(4,1^{21})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=4$: $\\lambda=(21,1^4)$. $d = \\binom{24}{4} = 10626$. Conjugate: $(5,1^{20})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=5$: $\\lambda=(20,1^5)$. $d = \\binom{24}{5} = 42504$. Conjugate: $(6,1^{19})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=6$: $\\lambda=(19,1^6)$. $d = \\binom{24}{6} = 134596$. Conjugate: $(7,1^{18})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=7$: $\\lambda=(18,1^7)$. $d = \\binom{24}{7} = 346104$. Conjugate: $(8,1^{17})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $k=8$: $\\lambda=(17,1^8)$. $d = \\binom{24}{8} = 735471$. This is > 500,000.\nThis family provides $6 \\times 2 = 12$ new irreps.\n\n**Family C: Other partitions near the \"edge\"**\nWe check partitions that are small modifications of those above. Dimensions are calculated using the Hook-Length formula.\n*   $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$: $d=4025$. Conjugate: $(3,2,1^{20})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$: $d=33000$. Conjugate: $(3,2,2,1^{18})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$: $d=21000$. Conjugate: $(3,3,1^{19})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$: $d=207000$. Conjugate: $(3,3,2,1^{17})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $\\lambda=(21,2,1^2)$: $d=31625$. Conjugate: $(4,2,1^{19})$. Gives 2 irreps.\n*   $\\lambda=(20,2,1^3)$: $d=167575$. Conjugate: $(5,2,1^{18})$. Gives 2 irreps.\nThis gives $6 \\times 2 = 12$ new irreps.\n\n**Checking Further Partitions and Self-Conjugate Partitions**\nCalculations for partitions that are more \"central\" (e.g., $(19,4,2)$, $(19,2,2,2)$) show their dimensions quickly exceed the 500,000 limit.\nSelf-conjugate partitions for $n=25$ tend to be relatively \"central\" as well. The most skewed self-conjugate partition for $n=25$ is $(13, 1^{12})$, whose dimension is $\\binom{24}{12} \\approx 2.7 \\times 10^6$, which is far too large. Other self-conjugate partitions have even larger dimensions. Thus, none of the irreps we found are self-conjugate.\n\n**5. Final Count**\nSumming up the irreps found:\n*   From Family A: 16 irreps.\n*   From Family B: 12 new irreps.\n*   From Family C: 12 new irreps.\nTotal number of irreps = $16 + 12 + 12 = 40$.\n\nEach pair $(\\lambda, \\lambda')$ with $\\lambda \\ne \\lambda'$ contributes 2 to the count. Since we found 20 such pairs with dimensions less than 500,000 and no self-conjugate partitions, the total number is $20 \\times 2 = 40$.\n\nFinal List of Dimensions:\n1 (2), 24 (2), 275 (2), 276 (2), 2000 (2), 2024 (2), 4025 (2), 10350 (2), 10626 (2), 21000 (2), 31625 (2), 33000 (2), 40480 (2), 42504 (2), 123970 (2), 134596 (2), 167575 (2), 207000 (2), 303600 (2), 346104 (2).\nThe numbers in parenthesis denote the number of irreps for that dimension. All these dimensions are less than 500,000.\n\nThe total count is 40.\n\n<<<40>>>"
