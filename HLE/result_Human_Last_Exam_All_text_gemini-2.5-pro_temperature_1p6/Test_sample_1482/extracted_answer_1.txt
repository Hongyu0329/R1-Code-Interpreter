The mathematical formulation for the lower bound of the Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) of a vertical cross-section at a primary input $x$, denoted $\underline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}_x}(u)$, is given by:
$\underline{\mu}_{\tilde{A}_x}(u) = \max \left( 0, \min \left( \frac{u - \underline{\mu}_{\underline{A}}(x)}{\bar{\mu}_{\underline{A}}(x) - \underline{\mu}_{\underline{A}}(x)}, 1, \frac{\bar{\mu}_{\bar{A}}(x) - u}{\bar{\mu}_{\bar{A}}(x) - \underline{\mu}_{\bar{A}}(x)} \right) \right)$
where $u$ is the secondary input variable, and $\underline{\mu}_{\underline{A}}(x)$, $\bar{\mu}_{\underline{A}}(x)$, $\underline{\mu}_{\bar{A}}(x)$, and $\bar{\mu}_{\bar{A}}(x)$ are the four boundary functions of the IT3 MF's Domain of Uncertainty (DOU), which are themselves defined using Gaussian-based paradigms. The upper bound of the FOU is given by $\bar{\mu}_{\tilde{A}_x}(u) = 1$ for $u \in [\underline{\mu}_{\underline{A}}(x), \bar{\mu}_{\bar{A}}(x)]$ and $0$ otherwise.
