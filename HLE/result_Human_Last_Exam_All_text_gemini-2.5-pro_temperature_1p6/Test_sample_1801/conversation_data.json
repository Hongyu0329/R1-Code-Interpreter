    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates. This means the individuals must have won a Nobel Prize at some point.\n*   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n*   **For Whom:** The commercial was for the company Enron.\n*   **When:** The commercial aired in 2000.\n*   **Key Detail:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n*   **Context:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" which suggests there is a well-known story or irony associated with it, likely related to Enron's subsequent collapse due to massive fraud.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Ask Why\" Campaign**\nFirst, we need to confirm the existence and nature of Enron's \"Ask Why\" advertising campaign from 2000. This was a real, high-profile campaign launched by Enron to position itself as an innovative, forward-thinking company that challenged the status quo in the energy industry. The ads featured various thought leaders and posed questions about the future of energy and markets.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Featured Individuals**\nResearch into this specific campaign reveals the prominent figures who appeared in the commercials. The goal is to find the two who are Nobel laureates. The two most commonly cited economists featured in these ads are Paul Krugman and Merton Miller.\n\n**Step 4: Verify the First Individual and their Nobel Status**\n*   **Individual:** Paul Krugman. He is a prominent economist and columnist. He did appear in an Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial discussing deregulation and markets.\n*   **Careful Point 1 (Nobel Status):** We must verify if he is a Nobel laureate. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n*   **Careful Point 2 (Timing):** It is important to note that when the commercial aired in 2000, Krugman was not yet a Nobel laureate. However, the question asks for two \"Nobel laureates\" (a status they hold now), not two individuals who \"were Nobel laureates at the time.\"\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Second Individual and their Nobel Status**\n*   **Individual:** Merton Miller. He was another renowned economist who appeared in the campaign.\n*   **Careful Point 3 (Nobel Status):** We must verify his Nobel status. Merton Miller was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his pioneering work in the theory of corporate finance.\n*   **Careful Point 4 (Timing):** Unlike Krugman, Merton Miller was already a Nobel laureate when he appeared in the Enron commercial in 2000. He passed away in June 2000, the same year the campaign was running.\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Answer**\nBased on the analysis, the two Nobel laureates who appeared in Enron's infamous 2000 \"Ask Why\" commercials were Paul Krugman and Merton Miller. The infamy of the ads stems from the deep irony of Enron promoting a message of transparency and questioning, just before the company imploded in 2001 due to one of the largest accounting fraud scandals in history.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"
