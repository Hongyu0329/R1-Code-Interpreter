    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided code.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Problem Statement\n1.  **Variable:** There is one integer variable, `x`, initialized to 0.\n2.  **Operations:**\n    *   `++`: Increment `x` by 1.\n    *   `--`: Decrement `x` by 1.\n3.  **Statements:** A statement is a 3-character string containing one operation (`++` or `--`) and the variable `X`.\n4.  **Possible Statements:** The operation and variable can be in any order. This leads to four possibilities:\n    *   `\"X++\"` (Increment)\n    *   `\"++X\"` (Increment)\n    *   `\"X--\"` (Decrement)\n    *   `\"--X\"` (Decrement)\n5.  **Input:**\n    *   An integer `n` (1 <= n <= 150), the number of statements.\n    *   `n` lines, each containing one of the four possible statements.\n6.  **Output:** The final value of `x` after executing all `n` statements.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n1.  **Initialization:** The code correctly initializes `int tresult = 0;`, which corresponds to `x=0`.\n2.  **Looping:** The `while (t-- > 0)` loop correctly iterates `n` times.\n3.  **Statement Reading:** `String test = inpt.next();` correctly reads each statement string.\n4.  **Logic:** The core logic is flawed:\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { tresult++; }`\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { tresult--; }`\n5.  **Flaw Identification:** The code only checks for the substrings `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`. It completely ignores the cases where the variable comes first: `\"X++\"` and `\"X--\"`. If the input is `\"X++\"`, neither `if` condition will be true, and `tresult` will not be updated. Therefore, the program does not solve the problem correctly for all valid inputs.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Correctness and Propose an Efficient C Solution\n*   **Correctness Answer:** The program is incorrect. The answer must start with 'N'.\n\n*   **Efficient C Solution Strategy:** To create the most efficient C solution (fastest and least memory), we should observe the structure of the input strings.\n    *   \"++X\"\n    *   \"X++\"\n    *   \"--X\"\n    *   \"X--\"\n    In every case, the character at index 1 (the middle character) uniquely determines the operation. If `string[1]` is `+`, it's an increment operation. If `string[1]` is `-`, it's a decrement. This is the fastest possible check, as it avoids string comparisons and only requires looking at a single character.\n\n*   **Efficient C Implementation (Conceptual):**\n    ```c\n    #include <stdio.h>\n\n    int main() {\n        int n;\n        scanf(\"%d\", &n); // Read number of statements\n        int x = 0;       // Initialize result\n        char statement[4]; // Buffer for \"X++\" plus null terminator\n\n        while (n-- > 0) {\n            scanf(\"%s\", statement);\n            if (statement[1] == '+') { // Check the middle character\n                x++;\n            } else {\n                x--;\n            }\n        }\n        printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n        return 0;\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Efficiency Metrics (x and y)\nThe requested answer format is `Nx+y`.\n\n*   **x: Smallest number of character comparisons for n=100**\n    *   Our efficient C solution's logic is `if (statement[1] == '+')`.\n    *   This is exactly **one** character comparison per statement.\n    *   For 100 statements, the total number of character comparisons in the core logic is `100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   This is the theoretical minimum, as at least one character must be inspected to determine the operation.\n    *   So, **x = 100**.\n\n*   **y: Smallest memory size in B (Bytes)**\n    *   We need to determine the minimum number of bytes required for variables on the stack.\n    *   We absolutely need a variable to hold the final result: `int x;`. Assuming a 32-bit system, this is **4 bytes**.\n    *   We need a variable to control the loop: `int n;`. This is another **4 bytes**.\n    *   The implementation above uses `char statement[4];`, which is an additional **4 bytes**. Total = 12 bytes.\n    *   Can we do better? Yes. We don't need to store the whole string. We can read character by character using `getchar()`, check the middle one, and discard the others.\n    *   A highly memory-optimized solution would only declare `int n;` and `int x;`. It would use `getchar()` to read and process input without a separate buffer.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum required memory is for two integers.\n    *   Smallest memory size = `sizeof(int) + sizeof(int)` = `4 + 4 = 8` bytes.\n    *   So, **y = 8**.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\n*   The program is incorrect: **N**\n*   Smallest number of character comparisons (`x`): **100**\n*   Smallest memory size (`y`): **8**\n*   Combining into the format `Nx+y`: **N100+8**\n\n<<<N100+8>>>"
