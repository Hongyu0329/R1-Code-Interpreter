    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n**1. Problem Definition**\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear system with matrices A and B:\n`A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n`B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe need to find a state feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system `A_cl = A - BF` has eigenvalues at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe desired eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair `λ_1 = -1 + j` and `λ_2 = -1 - j`. The desired characteristic polynomial `P_des(λ)` is formed from these eigenvalues:\n`P_des(λ) = (λ - λ_1)(λ - λ_2)`\n`P_des(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`P_des(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\nUsing the identity `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2`, where `a = λ + 1` and `b = j`:\n`P_des(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\n`P_des(λ) = (λ^2 + 2λ + 1) - (-1)`\n`P_des(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\n\n**3. Closed-Loop System Characteristic Polynomial**\nThe feedback gain matrix `F` will be a 2x2 matrix since the state vector has 2 components and the input vector has 2 components. Let's define `F` as:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nNow, we compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF`:\nFirst, calculate `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]] = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNext, calculate `A_cl = A - BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] - [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 - f1 - 2*f3, 1 - f2 - 2*f4], [1 - f1, -f2]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system, `P_cl(λ)`, is `det(λI - A_cl)`:\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ - (-1 - f1 - 2*f3), -(1 - f2 - 2*f4)], [-(1 - f1), λ - (-f2)]]`\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ + 1 + f1 + 2*f3, -1 + f2 + 2*f4], [f1 - 1, λ + f2]]`\n\n`P_cl(λ) = (λ + 1 + f1 + 2*f3)(λ + f2) - (-1 + f2 + 2*f4)(f1 - 1)`\n`P_cl(λ) = λ^2 + λf2 + λ(1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2(1 + f1 + 2*f3) - [-f1 + 1 + f1f2 - f2 + 2f1f4 - 2f4]`\n`P_cl(λ) = λ^2 + λ(1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3) + f2 + f1f2 + 2f2f3 + f1 - 1 - f1f2 + f2 - 2f1f4 + 2f4`\n`P_cl(λ) = λ^2 + λ(1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3) + (f1 + 2*f2 - 1 + 2f2f3 - 2f1f4 + 2f4)`\n\n**4. Equating Coefficients**\nNow, we match the coefficients of `P_cl(λ)` with the desired polynomial `P_des(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`.\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ^1:**\n    `1 + f1 + f2 + 2f3 = 2`\n    `f1 + f2 + 2f3 = 1`  (Equation 1)\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ^0 (constant term):**\n    `f1 + 2*f2 - 1 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f1*f4 + 2*f4 = 2`\n    `f1 + 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f1*f4 + 2*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\n**5. Solving for the Feedback Gain F**\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinite solutions for `F`. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying assumption. A common technique is to set some of the gain elements to zero.\n\nLet's assume `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`. This simplifies the equations significantly.\n\n*   **Equation 1 becomes:**\n    `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = 1  =>  f1 + f2 = 1`\n\n*   **Equation 2 becomes:**\n    `f1 + 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2*f1(0) + 2(0) = 3  =>  f1 + 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a simple system of two linear equations:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = 1`\n2.  `f1 + 2f2 = 3`\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2f2) - (f1 + f2) = 3 - 1`\n`f2 = 2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = 2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + 2 = 1`\n`f1 = -1`\n\nSo, one possible solution for the feedback gain matrix `F` is:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]] = [[-1, 2], [0, 0]]`\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **MIMO System:** The system is Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) because the input matrix `B` has more than one column. This often leads to non-unique solutions for the feedback gain `F`.\n*   **Controllability:** Pole placement is only possible if the system `(A, B)` is controllable. The controllability matrix `[B, AB]` must have full rank (rank 2 in this case). A quick check shows the system is controllable, so a solution exists.\n*   **Simplifying Assumption:** The choice to set `f3=0` and `f4=0` is arbitrary but leads to a simple solution. Other choices (e.g., `f1=0, f2=0`) would lead to different, but also valid, solutions for `F`.\n*   **Algebraic Manipulation:** Care must be taken during the expansion of the determinant and the collection of polynomial coefficients, as errors can easily be made.\n\nThe final answer is one of the possible gain matrices `F`.\n\n<<<[[-1, 2], [0, 0]]>>>"
