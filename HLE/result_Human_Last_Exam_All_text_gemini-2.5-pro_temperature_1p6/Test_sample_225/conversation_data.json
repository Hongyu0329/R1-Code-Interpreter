    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations (cos(9t), sin(5t)).\n\n**Step 1: Identify the curve and its properties.**\nThe curve is given by the parametric equations:\nx(t) = cos(9t)\ny(t) = sin(5t)\n\nThis is a type of curve known as a Lissajous curve. The parameters are a = 9 and b = 5. The curve is periodic. The period of x(t) is T_x = 2π/9 and the period of y(t) is T_y = 2π/5. The period of the entire curve is the least common multiple of T_x and T_y, which is T = LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π. The complete curve is traced for t in the interval [0, 2π).\n\n**Step 2: Define a self-intersection point.**\nA self-intersection point is a point (x, y) on the curve that is reached at two different time values, t1 and t2. We need to find the number of unique points (x, y) for which:\nx(t1) = x(t2)  => cos(9t1) = cos(9t2)\ny(t1) = y(t2)  => sin(5t1) = sin(5t2)\nfor 0 ≤ t1 < t2 < 2π.\n\n**Step 3: Use the established formula for Lissajous curves.**\nFor a Lissajous curve defined by x = cos(at) and y = sin(bt), where a and b are integers, there's a well-known formula for the number of self-intersections, which depends on the values of a and b.\n\nThe number of self-intersection points N is given by the formula:\nN = (n-1)(m-1)/2\nwhere n = a/gcd(a,b) and m = b/gcd(a,b), provided that n and m are coprime and both are odd integers.\n\n**Step 4: Check the conditions for the formula.**\nIn our case, a = 9 and b = 5.\n1.  **Coprime:** The greatest common divisor of a and b is gcd(9, 5) = 1. So, they are coprime.\n2.  **Parity:** Both a=9 and b=5 are odd numbers.\n3.  **Origin Crossing:** The formula is valid for curves that do not have a self-intersection at the origin (0,0). We need to check if the curve passes through the origin. This would require x(t)=0 and y(t)=0 for the same value of t.\n    *   x(t) = cos(9t) = 0 implies 9t = kπ + π/2 = (2k+1)π/2 for some integer k. So, t = (2k+1)π/18.\n    *   y(t) = sin(5t) = 0 implies 5t = mπ for some integer m. So, t = mπ/5.\n    *   For the curve to be at the origin, we must have (2k+1)π/18 = mπ/5 for some integers k and m.\n    *   This simplifies to 5(2k+1) = 18m.\n    *   The left-hand side, 5(2k+1), is the product of two odd numbers, so it is always odd.\n    *   The right-hand side, 18m, is an even number.\n    *   An odd number cannot equal an even number. Therefore, the curve never passes through the origin.\n\nSince all conditions are met, the formula can be applied directly.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the number of self-intersection points.**\nWith a = 9 and b = 5 (and gcd(9,5)=1, so n=9, m=5), we can substitute these values into the formula:\nN = (a-1)(b-1)/2\nN = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\nN = (8)(4) / 2\nN = 32 / 2\nN = 16\n\nThus, there are 16 self-intersection points.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The curve is identified as a Lissajous curve x=cos(9t), y=sin(5t).\n2.  The applicable formula for the number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve with odd coprime frequencies a and b is N = (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n3.  The parameters are a=9, b=5. They are odd and coprime.\n4.  It was verified that the curve does not pass through the origin, so the formula is valid.\n5.  Calculation: N = (9-1)(5-1)/2 = 8*4/2 = 16."
