    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number `n` such that there exists a set `G` of `n` elements and a binary operation `·` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a group**\n\nA group is a set `G` combined with a binary operation `·` that satisfies four fundamental properties called group axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. A binary operation `·` on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`, so this property is satisfied by the very definition of a binary operation on a set.\n2.  **Associativity:** For all `a`, `b`, and `c` in `G`, the equation `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)` holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`. The existence of this element `e` implies that the set `G` cannot be empty.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there exists an element `b` in `G` such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size `n` of a set `G` for which we can define a binary operation `·` such that at least one of these axioms (specifically, Associativity, Identity, or Inverse) fails.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case for n = 0**\n\n*   If `n = 0`, the set is the empty set, `G = {}`.\n*   A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G` is empty, `G × G` is also empty. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the empty function), so a binary operation exists.\n*   Let's check the group axioms. The axiom for an identity element requires that \"there exists an element `e` in `G`...\". Since `G` has no elements, this axiom cannot be satisfied.\n*   Therefore, `(G, ·)` is not a group for `n = 0`. This means `n=0` is a possible value.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the case for n = 1**\n\n*   If `n = 1`, let the set be `G = {a}`.\n*   There is only one possible binary operation on `G`, because `G × G = {(a, a)}`, and the result of the operation `a · a` must be an element of `G`, so `a · a = a`.\n*   Let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n    *   **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. And `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. The property holds.\n    *   **Identity Element:** The element `a` acts as the identity, since `a · a = a`. The property holds.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, its inverse is `a` itself, because `a · a = a`, and `a` is the identity element. The property holds.\n*   Since all axioms are satisfied, any set of size 1 with a binary operation is always a group (the trivial group). It is impossible to form a non-group structure. Thus, `n=1` is not the answer.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the case for n = 2**\n\n*   If `n = 2`, let the set be `G = {a, b}`. We need to determine if there exists at least one binary operation `·` on `G` for which `(G, ·)` is not a group.\n*   Let's define a simple binary operation. For example, let `x · y = a` for any `x, y` in `G`. The operation table (Cayley table) is:\n    ```\n      · | a | b\n    --- |---|---\n      a | a | a\n      b | a | a\n    ```\n*   Let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n    *   **Identity Element:** We need to find an element `e` such that `e · x = x` for all `x ∈ G`.\n        *   Let's test if `a` is the identity: We would need `a · b = b`. But our table shows `a · b = a`. So, `a` is not the identity element.\n        *   Let's test if `b` is the identity: We would need `b · a = a`. Our table shows `b · a = a`. This is fine. But we also need `b · b = b`. Our table shows `b · b = a`. So, `b` is not the identity element.\n    *   Since neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element, this structure has no identity element.\n*   Because it fails the identity element axiom, this `(G, ·)` is not a group. Therefore, `n=2` is a possible value.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the smallest number**\n\n*   We found that a non-group structure exists for `n = 0` and `n = 2`.\n*   A non-group structure does not exist for `n = 1`.\n*   The set of possible values of `n` is `{0, 2, 3, 4, ...}`.\n*   The smallest number in this set is `0`.\n\n**Careful Point: Contextual Interpretation**\nIn many introductory abstract algebra courses, algebraic structures like magmas, semigroups, and groups are implicitly assumed to be on non-empty sets. This convention simplifies many proofs and definitions. If this implicit assumption (`n ≥ 1`) is made, then `n = 0` would be excluded from consideration. In that context:\n*   `n=1` is not possible.\n*   `n=2` is the first possible positive integer.\nThe case `n=2` is also the smallest size `n` where it's possible to define both a group (e.g., the cyclic group of order 2) and a non-group on the set, making it the first non-trivial case. For `n=0`, it's impossible to form a group. For `n=1`, it's impossible *not* to form a group. Given the typical setting of such problems, the question is likely looking for this first non-trivial case.\n\nBased on this analysis of standard mathematical context, `2` is the most reasonable answer."
