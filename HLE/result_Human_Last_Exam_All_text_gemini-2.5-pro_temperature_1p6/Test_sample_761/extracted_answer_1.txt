No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides. Although the monomers of polynucleotides (nucleotides) contain a sugar component, their overall structure is fundamentally different from polysaccharides in three key ways:
1.  **Monomer Identity:** The repeating unit of a polysaccharide is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar). The repeating unit of a polynucleotide is a nucleotide, which is a composite molecule made of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.
2.  **Backbone Linkage:** Polysaccharides are formed by glycosidic bonds that link sugar units directly to each other. Polynucleotides are formed by phosphodiester bonds that create an alternating sugar-phosphate backbone.
3.  **Backbone Composition:** The backbone of a polysaccharide is made entirely of sugar units. The backbone of a polynucleotide is made of alternating sugar and phosphate groups, making it a sugar-phosphate backbone.
