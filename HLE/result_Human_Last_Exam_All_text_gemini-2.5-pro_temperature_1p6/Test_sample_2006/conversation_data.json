    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Question's components**\n\nThe prompt presents a haiku with a title and a final instruction on how to answer it. We need to dissect each part to understand the whole.\n\n*   **The Title:** \"The Bays\".\n*   **The Haiku:**\n    *   Line 1: \"An August tempest\"\n    *   Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"\n    *   Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"\n*   **The Instruction:** \"The title is a question, in alphabetical order what is the answer?\"\n\n**Step 2: Decipher the Haiku and the Title Pun**\n\n1.  The instruction states \"The title is a question\". So, the question is \"The Bays?\".\n2.  \"The Bays\" is a homophonic pun on \"The Days?\". This pun connects the title to the content of the haiku, which is about a specific number of days.\n3.  Line 1: \"An August tempest\". This sets the scene in the month of August. The word \"August\" is also a title given to Roman emperors, starting with Octavian.\n4.  Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\". \"Twice fifteen\" is 2 x 15 = 30. This line suggests that the number 30 was subject to a \"wind of change.\"\n5.  Line 3: \"A divine one yields\". This refers to the deified Roman Emperor Augustus. The word \"yields\" can mean \"produces\" or \"gives way to\".\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize the Clues into a Narrative**\n\nThe haiku tells a story, a famous (though historically debated) legend popularized by the 13th-century scholar Sacrobosco:\n\n*   Originally, the month of August (then called Sextilis) had 30 days. (\"Twice fifteen\").\n*   When it was renamed for Emperor Augustus (\"a divine one\"), he allegedly wanted his month to have as many days as Julius Caesar's month, July (which has 31).\n*   This desire brought a \"wind of change\": a day was taken from February and added to August, making it 31 days long. Augustus \"yields\" a new total.\n*   So, the story of \"The Days\" of August is that it changed from 30 to 31 due to the ambition of an emperor.\n\n**Step 4: Understand the Final Instruction**\n\nThe instruction \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\" is the final key. It's not asking to rearrange the letters of the answer. Instead, it's a condition that the answer word itself must satisfy: its letters must appear in alphabetical order.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Final Answer**\n\n1.  The riddle is not just asking for the number \"31\". That would not satisfy the \"alphabetical order\" constraint.\n2.  We must look for a thematic answer. The question \"The Days?\" is answered by the story of *why* the number of days changed.\n3.  The motivation behind Augustus's legendary change was his ambition, pride, and desire for renown or... **glory**.\n4.  Let's check the word \"Glory\" against the constraint.\n    *   The letters are G, L, O, R, Y.\n    *   Let's check their position in the alphabet: G(7), L(12), O(15), R(18), Y(25).\n    *   The letters in the word \"glory\" are indeed in alphabetical order.\n\nTherefore, \"glory\" is the single word that thematically answers the riddle of the haiku while also satisfying the cryptic final instruction.\n\n<<<Glory>>>"
