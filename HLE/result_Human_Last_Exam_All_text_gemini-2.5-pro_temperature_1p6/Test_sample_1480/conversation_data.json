    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rule activation level.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Components of the Question\n\n*   **Rule Activation Level:** In the context of a fuzzy rule (e.g., IF `antecedent` THEN `consequent`), this refers to the result of the implication step. The implication step combines the firing strength of the antecedent with the membership function of the consequent.\n*   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This is a highly complex type of fuzzy set designed to handle very high levels of uncertainty. However, the problem provides crisp numerical values (`0.7` and `0.9`) for the inputs to the calculation. This simplifies the problem significantly, meaning the core logic of the operation is the same as in a simpler Type-1 fuzzy system, even though the theoretical background is more complex. The \"IT3 FS\" context indicates the environment, but the calculation itself uses the provided scalars.\n*   **`Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`:** This value represents the **antecedent firing strength** for the k-th rule. It is the overall degree to which the \"IF\" part of the rule is true for the given input `x'`.\n*   **`μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`:** This is the membership grade of a specific output value `y_j` in the original consequent fuzzy set `G_k_j`. It represents how strongly `y_j` belongs to the output category defined by the rule's \"THEN\" part, before considering the rule's firing strength.\n*   **T-norm Operation:** A t-norm is a mathematical function that models a fuzzy logical AND. In fuzzy inference systems (like the Mamdani model), a t-norm is used for two primary purposes:\n    1.  To combine multiple conditions within the antecedent (e.g., IF `x1 is A1` **AND** `x2 is A2`).\n    2.  To apply the antecedent's final firing strength to the consequent fuzzy set (the implication step).\n\nThe question asks us to perform the second type of operation: the implication.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate the Calculation\n\nThe implication step calculates the output fuzzy set for a single rule. The membership value of any point in this output set is determined by combining the rule's firing strength with the original membership value in the consequent set. This is done using a t-norm.\n\nLet:\n*   `w_k = Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` (Antecedent firing strength)\n*   `μ_original(y_j) = μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9` (Original consequent membership at `y_j`)\n\nThe resulting activation level (or membership grade) at point `y_j` is:\n`Activation Level = t_norm(w_k, μ_original(y_j))`\n\n### Step 3: Select and Apply the T-norm\n\nThe problem specifies using \"a t-norm\" but does not state which one. We will analyze the two most common t-norms:\n\n1.  **Minimum (min) T-norm:** This is the most widely used t-norm for implication in Mamdani fuzzy systems. It \"clips\" the consequent fuzzy set at the height of the antecedent's firing strength.\n    *   `Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   `Activation Level = 0.7`\n\n2.  **Product (prod) T-norm:** This t-norm \"scales\" the consequent fuzzy set by the antecedent's firing strength.\n    *   `Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9`\n    *   `Activation Level = 0.63`\n\nUnless specified otherwise, the **minimum (min)** operator is the standard and most fundamental choice for fuzzy implication. Therefore, we will use it to find the definitive answer.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion on Careful Points\n\n*   **Key Insight:** The problem is simpler than it appears. The mention of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" is context, but the provided scalar values allow for a direct calculation using fundamental fuzzy logic principles.\n*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** The term \"rule activation level\" in this context refers to the result of the implication operation (`t_norm(antecedent, consequent)`), not just the antecedent firing strength, because the question explicitly instructs to use a t-norm on both given values.\n*   **Standard Practice:** The use of the `min` t-norm is standard practice for Mamdani implication when no other t-norm is specified.\n\nFollowing the standard `min` t-norm for the implication step:\n\nActivation Level = `min(Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership)`\nActivation Level = `min(0.7, 0.9)`\nActivation Level = `0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
