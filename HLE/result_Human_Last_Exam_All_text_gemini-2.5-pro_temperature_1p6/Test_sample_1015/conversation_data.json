    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the differences between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods, considering all the options.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Movement: Cambré Derrière**\n    *   *Cambré* means \"arched\" or \"bent.\"\n    *   *Derrière* means \"to the back.\"\n    *   Therefore, *cambré derrière* is a bend of the upper body backward from the waist. It is a core movement in ballet training designed to develop flexibility and strength in the back and core.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach:**\n    *   **Emphasis:** The Vaganova method, codified by Agrippina Vaganova, is known for its systematic and meticulous approach, building immense core strength and control.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The Vaganova method places a strict emphasis on maintaining a perfectly square alignment of the hips and shoulders.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** The hips must remain directly over the feet and facing straight forward. To counterbalance the weight of the upper body bending backward, the hips are often taught to press slightly *forward*. This action stabilizes the pelvis and ensures the bend originates from the upper thoracic spine (between the shoulder blades), protecting the vulnerable lower back (lumbar spine). The integrity of this stable, square hip line is paramount.\n    *   **Head and Arms:** The head follows the line of the spine, looking up and back. The arms typically open from a high fifth position (en haut) through second position as the body bends back.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach:**\n    *   **Emphasis:** The Balanchine style, developed by George Balanchine, is known for its speed, musicality, and unique aesthetic lines, often breaking from strict classical rules to achieve a specific visual effect.\n    *   **Execution of Cambré Derrière:** The Balanchine approach alters the classical alignment to create a different line and allow for greater speed and range of motion.\n    *   **Hip Placement:** This is the most significant point of divergence. In the Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer is taught to release one hip backward. If starting from fifth position, the hip corresponding to the front leg will typically release back. This creates an off-center, slightly spiraled line through the torso. This \"broken\" line is a signature of the style.\n    *   **Purpose of the Balanchine approach:** Releasing the hip allows for what can appear to be a deeper and more dynamic bend. It also facilitates the rapid transitions that are characteristic of Balanchine's choreography.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices based on the analysis:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there may be stylistic nuances in the arms, the fundamental path is similar in both methods. This is not the primary distinguishing feature.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova demands square, forward-pressed hips. Balanchine teaches a released hip. This fundamental difference in pelvic alignment changes the entire mechanic and aesthetic of the movement.\n    *   **C. Speed:** Balanchine's style is generally faster, so a cambré might be executed more quickly. However, this is a difference in musicality and quality, not the underlying technical instruction of how to form the shape. The hip placement is the *cause* that allows for this speed, making it the more fundamental answer.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** Both styles aim for significant flexibility. The visual depth of the backbend is a result of the technique used. The Balanchine method *looks* different and can appear deeper because of the hip release, but the core difference is *how* that bend is achieved, not simply how far it goes.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head placement is a consequence of the spinal alignment. The head follows the spine. Because the spine is aligned differently in each method (due to the hip placement), the final position of the head will differ, but the *principle* of how the head is placed is the same. The root difference is in the hips and torso.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe most fundamental and defining technical difference between a Vaganova cambré derrière and a Balanchine cambré derrière is the alignment and placement of the hips. Vaganova's strict adherence to a square pelvis contrasts directly with Balanchine's characteristic released hip.\n\n<<<B>>>"
