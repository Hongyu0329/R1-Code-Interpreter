    "The user wants to find the number of non-zero coefficients for the terms of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula**\n\nThe BCH formula provides an expression for $Z$ in the equation $e^Z = e^X e^Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are non-commuting variables (e.g., matrices). The solution for $Z$ is given as a series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$:\n$Z = \\log(e^X e^Y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X,Y)$\nHere, $Z_n(X,Y)$ is the homogeneous part of degree $n$, meaning it is a linear combination of all possible nested commutators involving $n$ total instances of $X$ and $Y$.\n\nFor example:\n-   $Z_1(X,Y) = X + Y$\n-   $Z_2(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$\n-   $Z_3(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]] - \\frac{1}{12}[Y,[X,Y]]$\n\nThe question asks for the number of non-zero coefficients in the expression for $Z_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Problem to Free Lie Algebras**\n\nThe terms $Z_n(X,Y)$ are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, $X$ and $Y$, which we denote as $L(X,Y)$. Specifically, $Z_n$ belongs to the subspace $L_n(X,Y)$ consisting of elements of homogeneous degree $n$.\nTo find the number of coefficients, we would typically express $Z_n$ as a linear combination of basis vectors for the space $L_n(X,Y)$.\n$Z_n(X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d_n} c_i B_i$\nwhere $\\{B_i\\}_{i=1}^{d_n}$ is a basis for $L_n(X,Y)$, $d_n$ is the dimension of this space, and $c_i$ are the scalar coefficients. The question asks for the number of non-zero $c_i$ for $n=10$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Basis Dependence**\nThe values of the coefficients $c_i$ depend on the choice of basis $\\{B_i\\}$. However, the question \"the number of nonzero coefficients\" implies that this number is an intrinsic property. This suggests that the result is independent of the choice of a \"natural\" basis (like a Hall basis).\n\n**Step 3: The Key Theorem**\n\nCalculating the coefficients $c_i$ for $Z_{10}$ explicitly is computationally infeasible. Fortunately, a fundamental theorem by K. Goldberg (1956) resolves this issue. The theorem states that when $Z_n(X,Y)$ is expanded in any Hall basis of the free Lie algebra $L_n(X,Y)$, all the coefficients $c_i$ are non-zero (for $n>1$).\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Importance of Goldberg's Theorem**\nThis theorem is the crucial link. It transforms a problem about calculating complex series coefficients into a problem of determining the dimension of a vector space. The number of non-zero coefficients is simply the dimension of the space $L_{10}(X,Y)$.\n\n**Step 4: Witt's Formula for Dimension**\n\nThe dimension of the subspace $L_n(X,Y)$ of the free Lie algebra on two generators is given by Ernst Witt's formula:\n$d_n = \\dim(L_n(X,Y)) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k|n} \\mu(k) 2^{n/k}$\nwhere:\n-   The sum is over all positive integers $k$ that divide $n$.\n-   $\\mu(k)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n**Step 5: Applying Witt's Formula for n = 10**\n\nWe need to calculate $d_{10}$.\n1.  **Find the divisors of n=10**: The divisors are $k \\in \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n2.  **Calculate the Möbius function $\\mu(k)$ for each divisor**:\n    *   $\\mu(1) = 1$\n    *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a single prime factor)\n    *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a single prime factor)\n    *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n    **Careful Point 3: Correct Evaluation of the Möbius Function**\n    A common mistake is to miscalculate $\\mu(k)$, especially for non-prime numbers. It's essential to remember the definition of the Möbius function.\n\n3.  **Substitute the values into Witt's formula**:\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\mu(1)2^{10/1} + \\mu(2)2^{10/2} + \\mu(5)2^{10/5} + \\mu(10)2^{10/10} \\right]$\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ (1) \\cdot 2^{10} + (-1) \\cdot 2^5 + (-1) \\cdot 2^2 + (1) \\cdot 2^1 \\right]$\n\n4.  **Perform the arithmetic**:\n    *   $2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   $2^5 = 32$\n    *   $2^2 = 4$\n    *   $2^1 = 2$\n\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n\n    **Careful Point 4: Accurate Arithmetic**\n    The final calculation must be done carefully.\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} [992 - 4 + 2]$\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} [988 + 2]$\n    $d_{10} = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n    $d_{10} = 99$\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nThe number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is equal to the dimension of the degree-10 subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators, $L_{10}(X,Y)$. This dimension is calculated using Witt's formula, which yields 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
