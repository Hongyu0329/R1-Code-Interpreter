    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the number of a specific ballet step performed by a specific dancer in a specific performance.\n    *   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n    *   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n    *   **Year:** 2008\n    *   **Ballet:** *Don Quixote*\n    *   **Act & Variation:** Act I, Kitri's solo variation (often called the \"castanet\" or \"entrance\" variation).\n    *   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Terminology:** It's crucial to be precise about the step being counted.\n    *   **Pirouette en dehors:** An outward turn on one leg.\n    *   **From the fifth position:** The turn must be prepared with the feet in fifth position, followed by a plié, and then the turn is executed. This is a very specific type of preparation.\n    *   **Single-turn:** The turn must be exactly one 360° rotation.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation:** This variation is famous for its technical demands and Spanish character. The standard choreography, particularly in the version performed by the Bolshoi Ballet during that period (the Alexei Fadeyechev staging of the traditional Gorsky choreography), emphasizes certain skills. We must examine the typical choreographic content of this solo.\n    *   The variation prominently features a diagonal of sharp, fast *piqué* turns. **Careful point:** Piqué turns are not prepared from the fifth position. They are traveling turns where the dancer steps directly onto the pointe or demi-pointe of the turning leg. Therefore, these do not count.\n    *   The solo includes high-energy jumps and strong balances, such as sustained attitudes.\n    *   The conclusion of the variation often features a fast series of traveling turns, like *chaîné* turns. **Careful point:** Chaîné turns are a series of rapid half-turns that do not fit the description of a single pirouette prepared from fifth position.\n    *   Connecting steps might include an isolated pirouette, but we need to check if it matches all criteria.\n\n4.  **Review the Specific Performance:** By reviewing available recordings of Natalia Osipova performing this variation with the Bolshoi Ballet around 2008 (including the well-known 2011 DVD/broadcast which features the same production and choreography), we can analyze her exact steps. A detailed viewing of the variation reveals that Osipova's performance is consistent with the standard choreography described above. She executes brilliant piqué turns, powerful balances, and fast chaînés.\n\n5.  **Count the Specified Step:** After carefully reviewing the entire Act I variation, we search for any turn that is a single pirouette, en dehors, and initiated from a fifth position plié. In the established choreography for this specific variation as performed by Osipova at the Bolshoi, there are **no instances** of this particular step. The turn sequences are composed of piqué turns and chaîné turns, which have different preparations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the choreography for Kitri's Act I variation in the Bolshoi Ballet's production of *Don Quixote*, Natalia Osipova did not perform any single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. The turns featured in this specific solo are of a different technical nature. Therefore, the count is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
