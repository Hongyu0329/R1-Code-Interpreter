The approach is not valid. The primary reason is that the ecological function of mimicry in *Bombus* is to deceive natural predators, which are primarily birds. The validity of the clustering depends on whether the perceived similarity is measured from the perspective of this ecologically relevant signal receiver. The proposed method fails on several critical points:

1.  **Visual System Mismatch:** Human vision is trichromatic, while avian predator vision is typically tetrachromatic, allowing them to see ultraviolet (UV) light. Bee warning coloration often has significant UV patterns that are invisible to humans. A clustering based on human perception would completely miss this crucial dimension of the signal and could lead to fundamentally incorrect groupings.
2.  **Lack of Ecological Context:** The "similarity" that drives the evolution of mimicry is one that a predator learns to associate with danger. Untrained undergraduates lack this predatory context. Their criteria for what constitutes "similar" are not shaped by the evolutionary pressure of avoiding a sting and are therefore not ecologically relevant.
3.  **Incomplete Stimulus:** Static images cannot capture dynamic cues like movement, posture, or the changing appearance of the bee under natural light, which may also be part of the warning signal perceived by a predator.

In conclusion, because the method substitutes the wrong sensory and cognitive system (untrained human) for the correct one (avian predator), it cannot be considered a valid approach to studying the ecological function of mimicry syndromes.
