    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of integers $x$ for which the expression $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem**\nLet $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$. We want to find the number of integers $x$ such that $P(x) = y^2$ for some integer $y$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the polynomial for large |x|**\nFor large positive $x$, $P(x) \\approx x^3$.\nFor large negative $x$, $P(x)$ is negative. A negative number cannot be a perfect square in integers. Thus, we only need to consider values of $x$ for which $P(x) \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Find the roots of P(x) to determine the intervals where P(x) is non-negative**\nWe need to find the roots of $P(x)=0$. We can test some integer values.\n$P(10) = 1000 - 1600 - 720 + 1056 = -264$.\n$P(20) = 8000 - 6400 - 1440 + 1056 = 1216$.\nSo there is a root between 10 and 20.\n$P(16) = 16^3 - 16(16^2) - 72(16) + 1056 = -72(16)+1056 = -1152+1056 = -96$.\n$P(17) = 17^3 - 16(17^2) - 72(17) + 1056 = 4913 - 16(289) - 1224 + 1056 = 4913 - 4624 - 1224 + 1056 = 121 = 11^2$.\nSo $x=17$ is a solution. And a root $x_1$ is between 16 and 17.\n\n$P(0) = 1056 > 0$.\n$P(8) = 8^3 - 16(8^2) - 72(8) + 1056 = 512 - 1024 - 576 + 1056 = -32$.\nA root $x_2$ lies between 0 and 8 (and from Step 5 we know it is between 7 and 8).\n\n$P(-5) = (-5)^3 - 16(-5)^2 - 72(-5) + 1056 = -125 - 400 + 360 + 1056 = 891$.\n$P(-10) = -1000 - 1600 + 720 + 1056 = -824$.\nA root $x_3$ lies between -5 and -10.\n$P(-8) = -512 - 1024 + 576 + 1056 = 96$.\n$P(-9) = -729 - 1296 + 648 + 1056 = -321$.\nSo the root $x_3$ is between -8 and -9.\n\n$P(x) \\ge 0$ for $x \\in [x_3, x_2] \\cup [x_1, \\infty)$.\nAs $x$ must be an integer, we test $x \\in [-8, 7] \\cup [17, \\infty)$.\n\n**Step 4: Test small integer values of x**\nLet's test integer values of $x$ in the determined range $[-8, 7]$.\n$P(-8) = 96$ (not a square)\n$P(-7) = 433$ (not a square)\n$P(-6) = 696$ (not a square)\n$P(-5) = 891$ (not a square)\n$P(-4) = (-4)^3 - 16(-4)^2 - 72(-4) + 1056 = -64 - 256 + 288 + 1056 = 1024 = 32^2$. So $x=-4$ is a solution.\n$P(-3) = 1101$ (not a square)\n$P(-2) = 1128$ (not a square)\n$P(-1) = 1111$ (not a square)\n$P(0) = 1056$ (not a square)\n$P(1) = 969$ (not a square)\n$P(2) = 856$ (not a square)\n$P(3) = 723$ (not a square)\n$P(4) = 4^3 - 16(4^2) - 72(4) + 1056 = 64 - 256 - 288 + 1056 = 576 = 24^2$. So $x=4$ is a solution.\n$P(5) = 421$ (not a square)\n$P(6) = 264$ (not a square)\n$P(7) = 111$ (not a square)\nSo far we have found two solutions in this range: $x=-4, 4$.\n\n**Step 5: Test integers in the range $[17, \\infty)$**\nWe already tested $x=17$ and found $P(17)=121=11^2$. So $x=17$ is a solution.\n\n**Step 6: Analyze for large x**\nTo check for other potential solutions for $x > 17$, we can perform an algebraic manipulation. Let $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\nConsider the substitution $v = x+4$, so $x = v-4$.\n$P(x) = (v-4)^3 - 16(v-4)^2 - 72(v-4) + 1056$\n$ = (v^3 - 12v^2 + 48v - 64) - 16(v^2 - 8v + 16) - (72v - 288) + 1056$\n$ = v^3 - 12v^2 + 48v - 64 - 16v^2 + 128v - 256 - 72v + 288 + 1056$\n$ = v^3 - 28v^2 + (48+128-72)v + (-64-256+288+1056)$\n$ = v^3 - 28v^2 + 104v + 1024$.\nLet's call this new polynomial $f(v) = v^3 - 28v^2 + 104v + 1024$.\nWe want to find integers $v=x+4$ for which $f(v)$ is a perfect square.\nThe solutions we found correspond to:\n$x=-4 \\implies v=0 \\implies f(0)=1024=32^2$.\n$x=4 \\implies v=8 \\implies f(8)=8^3-28(8^2)+104(8)+1024 = 512 - 1792 + 832 + 1024 = 576=24^2$.\n$x=17 \\implies v=21 \\implies f(21)=21^3-28(21^2)+104(21)+1024 = 9261 - 12348 + 2184 + 1024 = 121=11^2$.\n\nNow we need to check if there are other integer solutions for $v$.\nFor large $v$, we can bound $f(v)$ between squares of expressions involving $v$.\nConsider the square of an expression that starts like the \"square root\" of $f(v)$: $v^{3/2} - 14v^{1/2}$.\n$(v^{3/2}-14v^{1/2})^2 = v(v-14)^2 = v(v^2-28v+196) = v^3-28v^2+196v$.\nLet's compare $f(v)$ with this square:\n$f(v) - v(v-14)^2 = (v^3 - 28v^2 + 104v + 1024) - (v^3 - 28v^2 + 196v) = -92v + 1024$.\nFor $v > 1024/92 \\approx 11.13$, this difference is negative.\nThis means for $v \\ge 12$, we have $f(v) < v(v-14)^2$.\n\nLet's compare $f(v)$ with the square of the next smaller expression, $(v^{3/2}-14v^{1/2}-1)^2$.\nThis does not result in a polynomial in $v$. Let's consider $(v(v-14)-1)^2$ etc.\nLet's consider $(\\sqrt{v}(v-14) - 1/\\sqrt{v})^2 = v(v-14)^2 - 2(v-14) + 1/v$, not helpful.\nConsider $(v(v-14-1))^2$.\n\nLet's be more concrete. We need to check for $v=x+4 \\ge 17+4=21$.\nWe already have a solution for $v=21$. Let's check $v \\ge 22$.\n$f(v)=y^2$. We have shown for $v \\ge 12$, $y^2 = f(v) < v(v-14)^2$.\nLet's check $f(v)$ against $(v(v-14)-c)^2$. Let's test against $(\\sqrt{f(v)}-1)^2$.\n\nA more advanced argument shows that for an elliptic curve of the form $y^2 = x^3+ax^2+bx+c$, the integer solutions are finite and \"sparse\". For a problem in this format, it's highly likely that after checking a reasonable range of values, all solutions have been found. The three solutions found are for relatively small values of $x$. A rigorous proof that there are no other solutions is very involved and beyond the scope of typical math contest problems. We rely on the thoroughness of our search in the likely regions.\n\nWe have checked all integers $x$ from -8 to 16.\nWe found solutions $x=-4, 4, 17$. We must be confident no more solutions exist for $x > 17$.\nThe problem of finding all integer points on an elliptic curve is non-trivial. Without access to specific theorems (like Baker's theorem bounds, or Siegel's theorem on integral points) or computational software, one must assume the problem has an elementary solution. The provided analysis is what one might reasonably do. Based on this, we have found 3 solutions.\n\nFinal Summary of solutions found:\n1. $x=-4 \\implies P(-4) = 1024 = 32^2$\n2. $x=4 \\implies P(4) = 576 = 24^2$\n3. $x=17 \\implies P(17) = 121 = 11^2$\n\nThe number of such integers is 3."
