    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework:** The problem is set in the context of the renormalization group (RG) theory and asks for a critical exponent using the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion. This method is used to study critical phenomena for systems near their upper critical dimension, $d_c$.\n\n2.  **Identify the relevant physical system and its properties:**\n    *   **Physical Quantity:** We are interested in the specific heat, $C_V$. Near the critical temperature $T_c$, it behaves as $C_V \\sim |(T-T_c)/T_c|^{-\\alpha}$, where $\\alpha$ is the specific heat critical exponent.\n    *   **Universality Class:** The standard model for which the $\\epsilon$-expansion is performed is the n-vector model (or O(n) model), described by a $\\phi^4$ field theory. The exponents depend on the number of spin components, *n*. Since the problem does not specify *n*, we will derive the general formula and then use the most common case, the Ising model ($n=1$), to obtain a numerical value.\n    *   **Spatial Dimension:** The system is in dimension $d=3$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Upper Critical Dimension ($d_c$) and $\\epsilon$:**\n    *   For the $\\phi^4$ theory (n-vector model), the upper critical dimension is $d_c=4$. At and above this dimension, mean-field theory exponents are correct.\n    *   The $\\epsilon$-expansion is performed in terms of the small parameter $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n    *   For our case, $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$. While $\\epsilon=1$ is not formally small, the $\\epsilon$-expansion often provides surprisingly good approximations even for this value.\n\n4.  **Use Hyperscaling Relations:** RG theory provides relations between different critical exponents. The specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ is related to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ through the Josephson's hyperscaling relation:\n    $2 - \\alpha = d\\nu$\n    This can be rearranged to solve for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n\n5.  **Find the expression for $\\nu$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion:** The exponent $\\nu$ can be calculated perturbatively in the $\\epsilon$-expansion. To first order in $\\epsilon$, the result for the n-vector model is:\n    $\\nu \\approx \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n    This result comes from calculating the RG flow of the mass term at the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\n6.  **Derive the expression for $\\alpha$ in the $\\epsilon$-expansion:** Now, substitute the expressions for $d$ and $\\nu$ into the hyperscaling relation. It is crucial to also express the dimension $d$ in terms of $\\epsilon$, i.e., $d = 4 - \\epsilon$.\n\n    $\\alpha = 2 - d\\nu$\n    $\\alpha \\approx 2 - (4-\\epsilon) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon \\right)$\n\n    Now, expand this product and keep only terms up to the first order in $\\epsilon$ ($O(\\epsilon)$):\n    $\\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ (4)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (4)\\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right) - (\\epsilon)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha \\approx 2 - \\left[ 2 + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{n+2}{n+8} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\\epsilon$\n\n    Combine the terms in the parenthesis using a common denominator:\n    $\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{2(n+2) - 1(n+8)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{2n+4 - n - 8}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n    $\\alpha \\approx - \\left( \\frac{n-4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon$\n\n    This gives the final first-order expression for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$\n\n7.  **Calculate the final numerical answer:**\n    *   As mentioned in step 2, we assume the Ising universality class, which corresponds to $n=1$. This is the standard choice when a specific model is not mentioned.\n    *   Substitute $n=1$ and $\\epsilon=1$ into the formula:\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)}(1)$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{3}{2(9)} = \\frac{3}{18}$\n    $\\alpha \\approx \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final result is obtained by evaluating the expression $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon$ for the Ising model ($n=1$) at spatial dimension $d=3$ ($\\epsilon = 4-3=1$).\n\n$\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{18} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
