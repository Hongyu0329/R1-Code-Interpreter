    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks to identify a specific \"book of manners\" that was \"preserved alongside\" the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n\n**Step 2: Understand the term \"preserved alongside\".**\nIn the context of historical texts like \"Sir Launfal\" (a Middle English poem), \"preserved alongside\" almost always refers to being contained within the same physical manuscript. Medieval manuscripts were often compilations of various texts bound together, known as a codex or miscellany.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal\".**\nWe need to find out which manuscript contains the version of *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre, which is the most famous English version. Research shows that this poem survives in only one manuscript: the early 15th-century manuscript known as **Cotton MS Caligula A.ii**, which is now housed in the British Library.\n\n**Step 4: Examine the contents of the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.**\nThis manuscript is a well-known miscellany containing a collection of English romances and other works. The next step is to look at a list of its contents to see if any of them fit the description of a \"book of manners\" or a \"courtesy book.\"\n\n**Step 5: Identify the \"book of manners\" within the manuscript.**\nUpon examining the table of contents for Cotton MS Caligula A.ii, we find several works, including romances like *Emar√©*, *The Squyr of Lowe Degre*, and *Sir Gowther*. Crucially, the manuscript also contains a work titled **The Boke of Curtasye** (often translated as *The Book of Courtesy*).\n\n**Step 6: Confirm that \"The Boke of Curtasye\" is a book of manners.**\nA \"book of manners,\" or courtesy book, is a genre of medieval and Renaissance literature that instructs on social etiquette, proper behavior in court, and moral conduct. *The Boke of Curtasye* fits this description perfectly. It is a poem that provides detailed instructions on everything from table manners to the duties of various household officers like the usher and the marshal.\n\n**Step 7: Synthesize the findings to form the final answer.**\n*Sir Launfal* is preserved in the manuscript Cotton MS Caligula A.ii.\nThis same manuscript also contains *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n*The Boke of Curtasye* is a classic example of a medieval book of manners.\nTherefore, the book of manners that Sir Launfal was preserved alongside is *The Boke of Curtasye*.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
