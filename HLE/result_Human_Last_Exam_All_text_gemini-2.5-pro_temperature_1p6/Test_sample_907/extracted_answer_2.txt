The equations for the absorption cross-section are as follows:

**a) The interaction between molecules can be neglected.**

The absorption spectrum consists of a single Gaussian peak centered at the transition frequency of an individual molecule. Its strength is proportional to the number of molecules, $N$.

$\sigma_a(\omega) = C \cdot N \cdot \omega \cdot |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(\omega - \omega_0)^2 \tau_p^2}{2}\right)$

**b) The interaction between near-neighbors should be considered.**

The absorption spectrum again consists of a single Gaussian peak, but its position is shifted due to the intermolecular coupling. All the absorption strength is concentrated into this single collective exciton transition ($k=0$).

$\sigma_b(\omega) = C \cdot N \cdot \omega \cdot |\vec{\mu}_{eg} \cdot \hat{\epsilon}|^2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{(\omega - (\omega_0 + 2J/\hbar))^2 \tau_p^2}{2}\right)$

**Description of Terms:**
*   **$\omega$**: The frequency of the absorbed light.
*   **$C$**: A proportionality constant that includes fundamental physical constants.
*   **$N$**: The total number of molecules in the chain.
*   **$\vec{\mu}_{eg}$**: The electric transition dipole moment of a single molecule for the ground-to-excited state transition.
*   **$\hat{\epsilon}$**: The unit vector describing the polarization of the laser's electric field.
*   **$\omega_0$**: The resonance transition frequency of an isolated molecule.
*   **$\tau_p$**: The time duration of the ultrashort Gaussian laser pulse, which determines the width of the absorption peak.
*   **$J$**: The near-neighbor coupling energy between two adjacent molecules in the chain. A positive $J$ (H-aggregate) results in a blue-shift, while a negative $J$ (J-aggregate) results in a red-shift of the absorption peak.
