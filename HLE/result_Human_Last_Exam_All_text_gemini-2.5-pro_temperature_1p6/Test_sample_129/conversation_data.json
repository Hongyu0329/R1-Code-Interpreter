    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n\n**1. Define the building blocks and rules:**\n*   **Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n*   **Length:** Exactly 5 symbols must be used.\n*   **Well-formed Expression:** An expression is syntactically correct according to standard boolean algebra rules.\n*   **Evaluation:** The expression must evaluate to True (T).\n*   **Precedence:** `!` has the highest precedence, followed by `&`, then `|`. `T & F | T` is parsed as `(T & F) | T`.\n*   **Parentheses:** Used for grouping and altering precedence. Each `(` and `)` counts as one symbol.\n*   **Distinct Expressions:** We are counting the number of unique strings that form valid, true expressions. For example, `(T)` is a different string from `T`.\n\n**2. Categorize expressions by their top-level structure:**\n\nWe can classify all possible valid expressions of length 5 into three main groups based on their outermost structure.\n\n*   **Group 1: Parenthesized Expressions `(A)`**\n    The expression is of the form `(A)`, where `A` is a valid expression of length 3. For `(A)` to be true, `A` must be true.\n    Let's find all true expressions of length 3:\n    1.  `T&T` (evaluates to T)  -> `(T&T)`\n    2.  `T|T` (evaluates to T)  -> `(T|T)`\n    3.  `T|F` (evaluates to T)  -> `(T|F)`\n    4.  `F|T` (evaluates to T)  -> `(F|T)`\n    5.  `!!T` (parsed as `!(!T)`, evaluates to T) -> `(!!T)`\n    6.  `(T)` (evaluates to T) -> `((T))`\n    This gives us **6** true expressions.\n\n*   **Group 2: Negated Expressions `!A`**\n    The expression is of the form `!A`, where `A` is a valid expression of length 4. For `!A` to be true, `A` must be false. The expression `A` cannot have a binary operator at its top level (like `L&L|L`) because that would lead to expressions like `!L&L|L`, which is parsed as `(!L)&L|L` and does not have `!` as the top-level operator. Thus, `A` must be built from `!`, `(`, `)`, and literals.\n    Let's find all false expressions `A` of length 4 made this way:\n    1.  `!!!T` (is `!(!(!T))`, evaluates to F). The full expression is `!(!!!T)`, which is the string `!!!!T` and evaluates to T.\n    2.  `!(T)` (the string is `!(T)`, length 4, evaluates to F). The full expression is `!(!(T))`, which is the string `!!(T)` and evaluates to T.\n    3.  `(!T)` (the string is `(!T)`, length 3, evaluates to F). This is not length 4.\n    4.  `(!T)` has length 3, e.g. `(`, `!`, `T`, `)`. To make it length 4, it can be `((F))`. The expression is `((F))`, which is length 4 and evaluates to F. The full expression is `!((F))` and evaluates to T.\n    5.  `(!T)` is `(!T)`, string of length 3. To make length 4, `A` could be of the form `(!T)`. This gives the full expression `!(!T)`.\n    So the list of valid true expressions from this group:\n    1.  `!!!!T` -> True\n    2.  `!!(T)` -> True (`!(T)` is False, so `!(!(T))` is True)\n    3.  `!(!T)` -> True (`(!T)` is False, so `!(!(!T))` is True)\n    4.  `!((F))` -> True (`((F))` is False, so `!(((F)))` is True)\n    This gives us **4** true expressions.\n\n*   **Group 3: Binary Expressions `A op B`**\n    The expression has a binary operator (`&` or `|`) as its top-level operator. The total length is 5.\n\n    *   **Subgroup 3a: `L1 op1 L2 op2 L3`** (3 literals, 2 operators, length 5)\n        -   `&` then `|`: Forms like `T&F|T` (parsed `(T&F)|T`). True if `L3=T` (4 combinations for L1,L2) or if `L3=F` and `L1&L2=T` (1 comb: `T&T&F`). Total: 5.\n        -   `|` then `&`: Forms like `T|F&T` (parsed `T|(F&T)`). Symmetric to the above. Total: 5.\n        -   `&` then `&`: `T&T&T`. Only 1 combination is true.\n        -   `|` then `|`: `T|T|F`, etc. True for all combinations except `F|F|F`. Total `2^3 - 1 = 7`.\n        -   Total for this subgroup: `5 + 5 + 1 + 7 =` **18**.\n\n    *   **Subgroup 3b: `!L1 op !L2`** (2 `!` ops, 1 binary op, 2 literals, len `2+1+2=5`)\n        -   `!F & !F`: Evaluates to `T & T`, which is T. (1)\n        -   `!F | !F`, `!F | !T`, `!T | !F`: All evaluate to T. (3)\n        -   Total for this subgroup: `1 + 3 =` **4**.\n\n    *   **Subgroup 3c: `!!L1 op L2` and `L1 op !!L2`** (2 `!` ops, 1 binary op, 2 literals, len `3+1+1=5`)\n        -   `&`: `!!T & T` and `T & !!T`. (2)\n        -   `|`: `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T` and `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (6)\n        -   Total for this subgroup: `2 + 6 =` **8**.\n\n    *   **Subgroup 3d: `(L1) op L2` and `L1 op (L2)`** (1 pair of parens, 1 binary op, 2 literals, len `3+1+1=5`)\n        -   `&`: `(T) & T` and `T & (T)`. (2)\n        -   `|`: `(T)|T`, `(T)|F`, `(F)|T` and `T|(T)`, `T|(F)`, `F|(T)`. (6)\n        -   Total for this subgroup: `2 + 6 =` **8**.\n\n    The total for Group 3 is `18 + 4 + 8 + 8 =` **38**.\n\n**3. Final Calculation**\n\nSumming the counts from all disjoint groups:\n*   Group 1: 6\n*   Group 2: 4\n*   Group 3: 38\n\nTotal = 6 + 4 + 38 = 48."
