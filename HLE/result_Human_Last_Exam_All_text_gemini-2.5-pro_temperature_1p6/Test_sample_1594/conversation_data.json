    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the letter formed by the two high school buildings in Pisa.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Schools:** The question specifies two high schools in Pisa: Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini.\n2.  **Locate the Schools:** A quick search on a map service (like Google Maps) confirms that these two schools are indeed located right next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce in Pisa, Italy. The full names are Istituto di Istruzione Superiore \"Galilei-Pacinotti\" and Liceo Scientifico Statale \"Ulisse Dini\".\n3.  **Analyze from Above (Satellite View):** To see the shape they form, we must switch to a satellite or aerial view.\n4.  **Examine the Building Shapes:**\n    *   The **Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti** is a very long, relatively narrow building that runs north-south. This building forms a prominent vertical line.\n    *   The **Istituto Ulisse Dini** is located immediately to the east of the Galilei-Pacinotti. Its building complex has a main section parallel to the other school and two distinct wings that protrude horizontally to the east.\n5.  **Combine the Shapes:** When you view the two building complexes together:\n    *   The long building of the Galilei-Pacinotti acts as the vertical stem of a letter.\n    *   The northernmost wing and part of the main building of the Ulisse Dini form a long top horizontal bar.\n    *   A shorter wing of the Ulisse Dini, located further down, forms a middle horizontal bar.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The combination of the long vertical building and the two horizontal wings extending from its side clearly forms the shape of the capital letter **F**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Precise Location:** It's crucial to look at the correct buildings on a satellite map. They are located on Via Benedetto Croce, Pisa.\n*   **Combined Shape:** The letter is not formed by a single building, but by the composite shape of the two adjacent school complexes. One school forms the \"backbone\" and the other forms the \"arms\".\n*   **Orientation:** The \"F\" is oriented with its vertical spine running roughly North-South and its horizontal arms pointing East.\n*   **Local Knowledge:** This is a well-known feature among the residents of Pisa, which helps confirm the visual analysis. It is often pointed out as a local curiosity.\n*   **Imperfect Shape:** The shape is not a perfect, architecturally-drawn letter 'F'. It's an emergent shape from the layout of the buildings, but the resemblance is unmistakable from an aerial perspective. The bottom horizontal bar is shorter and less defined than the top one, which is typical of the letter 'F'.\n\n<<<F>>>"
