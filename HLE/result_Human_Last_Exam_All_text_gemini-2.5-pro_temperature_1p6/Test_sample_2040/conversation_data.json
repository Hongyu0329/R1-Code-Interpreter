    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC)**\n\nSPDC is a quantum optical and nonlinear optical process. In its simplest form, a single high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into a pair of lower-energy photons (traditionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\"). Energy and momentum must be conserved in this process.\n\n*   **Energy Conservation:** ω_pump = ω_signal + ω_idler\n*   **Momentum Conservation (Phase Matching):** **k**_pump = **k**_signal + **k**_idler\n\nThe key takeaway is that SPDC is a **second-order nonlinear optical effect**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Material Requirement for Second-Order Nonlinear Effects**\n\nFor a material to exhibit a bulk second-order nonlinear optical response, its underlying crystal structure must lack a center of inversion. Such materials are called **non-centrosymmetric**.\n\n*   The relationship between the induced polarization (**P**) in a material and the applied electric field (**E**) can be expressed as a power series:\n    **P** = ε₀(χ⁽¹⁾**E** + χ⁽²⁾**E**² + χ⁽³⁾**E**³ + ...)\n*   The term χ⁽²⁾ is the second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor. SPDC efficiency is directly related to the magnitude of χ⁽²⁾.\n*   In a centrosymmetric material, applying an inverted electric field (-**E**) must produce an inverted polarization (-**P**).\n    -**P** = ε₀(χ⁽¹⁾(-**E**) + χ⁽²⁾(-**E**)² + χ⁽³⁾(-**E**)³ + ...)\n    -**P** = ε₀(-χ⁽¹⁾**E** + χ⁽²⁾**E**² - χ⁽³⁾**E**³ + ...)\n*   Comparing the two expressions for polarization, we see that for this to hold true, all even-order susceptibility tensors, including χ⁽²⁾, must be zero.\n*   Therefore, a material must be **non-centrosymmetric** to have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ and thus exhibit SPDC.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Crystal Structure of Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\nThe next step is to determine if the crystal structure of boron nanosheets is centrosymmetric or non-centrosymmetric.\n\n*   Borophene, the 2D allotrope of boron, is polymorphic, meaning it can exist in several different stable or metastable structures.\n*   The question specifies \"free-standing\" nanosheets. This means we must consider the intrinsic symmetry of the 2D borophene lattice itself, not effects from a substrate.\n*   The most widely studied and synthesized phases of borophene are the **β₁₂** phase and the **striped** phase (also referred to as χ₃ or 8-Pmmn borophene).\n*   Let's examine their symmetry:\n    *   The **β₁₂ borophene** sheet has a hexagonal lattice with a space group of **P6/mmm**. The \"/\" in this Hermann-Mauguin notation indicates the presence of a center of inversion. Therefore, this structure is **centrosymmetric**.\n    *   The **striped phase borophene** has an orthorhombic lattice with a space group of **Pmmn**. This space group also contains a center of inversion. Therefore, this structure is also **centrosymmetric**.\n*   Since the common and stable phases of free-standing borophene are centrosymmetric, their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\n\nCombining the previous steps:\n\n1.  SPDC requires a material with a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n2.  A non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n3.  The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, free-standing boron nanosheets have a bulk χ⁽²⁾ = 0.\n\nBecause the fundamental material requirement for SPDC is not met, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit this effect.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **\"Free-standing\" is a key qualifier.** If the borophene sheet were on a substrate, the overall symmetry would be broken at the interface, which *could* potentially lead to a second-order nonlinear response localized at that interface. However, the question rules this out.\n2.  **Bulk vs. Edges/Defects.** While the bulk material is centrosymmetric, the symmetry is broken at the edges of the nanosheet or at certain defect sites. These localized regions could, in principle, generate an extremely weak SPDC signal. However, this is not a bulk effect, would be incredibly inefficient, and is not what is typically meant when asking if a material exhibits a particular nonlinear process. The expected behavior is governed by the bulk properties.\n3.  **Higher-Order Effects.** Even in centrosymmetric materials, extremely weak second-order effects can be mediated by electric quadrupole or magnetic dipole moments. These effects are several orders of magnitude weaker than the electric-dipole-allowed SPDC in non-centrosymmetric materials and are generally considered negligible.\n4.  **Polymorphism.** The conclusion is based on the most stable and commonly studied phases of borophene. While it is theoretically possible for an exotic, non-centrosymmetric phase of borophene to exist, it is not the expected state. The question asks what would be \"expected\".\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the symmetry analysis of the stable, free-standing forms of boron nanosheets, they are centrosymmetric materials. This means their bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) is zero. As SPDC is a second-order nonlinear process that requires a non-zero χ⁽²⁾, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit it.\n\n<<<No>>>"
