The product is the ketone formed from the anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement of the starting alcohol. Structurally, the C2 alcohol is oxidized to a ketone, the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene core is cleaved, and a new C-C bond is formed between the original C5 of the norbornene and C2 of the cyclopentenyl group. The carbon skeleton is rearranged from a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative to a fused bicyclo[4.2.0]octene derivative containing the ketone.
