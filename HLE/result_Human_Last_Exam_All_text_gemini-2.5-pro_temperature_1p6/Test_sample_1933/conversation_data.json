    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of 4 unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n\n2.  **The Logic Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic. Formulas in this fragment are constructed using:\n    *   **Atomic formulas**: $P_i(y)$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, and equality $y=z$, where $y, z$ are variables. We can also use the constants for truth ($\\top$) and falsity ($\\bot$).\n    *   **Logical connectives**: Conjunction ($\\land$).\n    *   **Quantifiers**: Existential quantification ($\\exists$).\n    *   **Important Omissions**: Note that negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), and universal quantification ($\\forall$) are not allowed.\n\n3.  **The Concept Class and VC Dimension**:\n    *   We are interested in concepts defined by formulas with one free variable, say $x$. A formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a concept on a universe $U$ of a model $\\mathcal{M}$. The concept is the set of elements $a \\in U$ that satisfy the formula: $C_\\phi = \\{a \\in U \\mid \\mathcal{M} \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\n    *   The concept class, let's call it $\\mathcal{C}$, is the set of all such concepts that can be defined by formulas in our logic fragment, over all possible models $\\mathcal{M}$.\n    *   The VC dimension of a logic is the maximum VC dimension of the concept class $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ over any model $\\mathcal{M}$. The VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ is the size $d$ of the largest set $Y \\subseteq U$ that can be \"shattered\" by $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n    *   A set $Y$ is shattered if for every subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$, there exists a concept $C \\in \\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}$ such that $C \\cap Y = Y'$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of formulas in the logic\n\nLet's analyze a typical formula $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$. A general formula in this logic is a conjunction of simpler formulas. The \"prime\" (non-conjoined) formulas are either atomic formulas with the free variable $x$, or existentially quantified formulas.\n\nConsider a formula of the form $\\psi(x) = \\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m . \\Psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\Psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas (like $P_i(z)$ or $z=w$).\n\nThe equality atoms within $\\Psi$ (e.g., $y_1=y_2$, $x=y_3$) create connections between variables. These equality constraints partition the set of all variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_m\\}$ into equivalence classes. Let's say $x$ belongs to an equivalence class $V_0$.\n\nWe can simplify $\\Psi$ by choosing a representative variable for each class and substituting it for all other variables in that class. The representative for $V_0$ must be $x$, since it is a free variable. Let the representatives for the other variable classes be $z_1, \\dots, z_k$. After this substitution, $\\Psi$ becomes a conjunction of predicates applied to these representatives: $x, z_1, \\dots, z_k$.\n\nThe formula $\\psi(x)$ can then be rewritten as:\n$\\psi(x) \\equiv \\exists z_1 \\dots \\exists z_k . \\left( C_0(x) \\land C_1(z_1) \\land \\dots \\land C_k(z_k) \\right)$\nwhere each $C_j(v)$ is a conjunction of the predicates from $S$ applied to the variable $v$.\n\nSince conjunction distributes over existential quantification (for distinct variables), this is equivalent to:\n$\\psi(x) \\equiv C_0(x) \\land (\\exists z_1 . C_1(z_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists z_k . C_k(z_k))$\n\nLet's examine the parts:\n*   $C_0(x)$: This is a quantifier-free conjunction of predicates applied to $x$, e.g., $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$.\n*   $(\\exists z_j . C_j(z_j))$: Each of these is a *sentence* (a formula with no free variables). For any given model $\\mathcal{M}$, a sentence is either true or false.\n\nLet $S = (\\exists z_1 . C_1(z_1)) \\land \\dots \\land (\\exists z_k . C_k(z_k))$. In any model $\\mathcal{M}$, the sentence $S$ evaluates to either true or false.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\models S$, then $\\psi(x)$ is equivalent to $C_0(x)$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models S$, then $\\psi(x)$ is equivalent to $C_0(x) \\land \\bot$, which is $\\bot$ (false for all $x$).\n\nThis crucial step shows that any existentially quantified formula in our fragment defines a concept that is either defined by a *quantifier-free* conjunction of predicates on $x$, or it defines the empty set.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the concept class\n\nAny formula $\\phi(x)$ in our logic is a conjunction of formulas like $P_i(x)$ and the existentially quantified formulas $\\psi(x)$ analyzed above.\nTherefore, the concept defined by any $\\phi(x)$ is an intersection of concepts defined by quantifier-free conjunctions of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n\nThe set of concepts formed by such conjunctions is closed under intersection. For example, $(\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1} P_i) \\cap (\\bigwedge_{i \\in I_2} P_i) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_1 \\cup I_2} P_i$.\n\nThis means that the full logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ does not have more expressive power in defining concepts than its quantifier-free fragment, which consists only of formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Our task is now simplified to finding the VC dimension of this quantifier-free fragment.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the VC Dimension of the simplified class\n\nLet the four base concepts defined by the predicates be $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ in a model $\\mathcal{M}$. The concept class is $\\mathcal{C}' = \\{ \\bigcap_{i \\in I} C_i \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\}$.\n\n**Upper Bound:**\nThe number of possible subsets $I$ of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ is $2^4 = 16$. This means our concept class $\\mathcal{C}'$ can contain at most 16 distinct concepts.\nTo shatter a set of size $d$, we need to be able to generate all $2^d$ of its subsets. This requires at least $2^d$ concepts in our class.\nSo, we must have $2^d \\le 16$, which implies $d \\le 4$.\nThus, the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\n**Lower Bound:**\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a model $\\mathcal{M}$ and a set $Y \\subseteq U$ of size 4 that is shattered by the corresponding concept class $\\mathcal{C}'_{\\mathcal{M}}$.\n\n*   Let the universe be $U = Y = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$.\n*   Define the interpretations of the four predicates (the base concepts $C_i$) as follows:\n    *   $C_1 = Y \\setminus \\{y_1\\} = \\{y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$\n    *   $C_2 = Y \\setminus \\{y_2\\} = \\{y_1, y_3, y_4\\}$\n    *   $C_3 = Y \\setminus \\{y_3\\} = \\{y_1, y_2, y_4\\}$\n    *   $C_4 = Y \\setminus \\{y_4\\} = \\{y_1, y_2, y_3\\}$\n*   Now, we show that any subset $Y' \\subseteq Y$ can be generated by a concept in $\\mathcal{C}'_{\\mathcal{M}}$. A concept is of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} C_i$ for some $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n    *   $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} C_i = \\bigcap_{i \\in I} (Y \\setminus \\{y_i\\}) = Y \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I} \\{y_i\\} = Y \\setminus \\{y_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$.\n*   Let $Y'$ be any target subset of $Y$. We need to find an index set $I$ such that $Y \\setminus \\{y_i \\mid i \\in I\\} = Y'$.\n*   This is equivalent to finding an $I$ such that $\\{y_i \\mid i \\in I\\}$ is the complement of $Y'$, i.e., $Y \\setminus Y'$.\n*   We can simply choose the set $I = \\{i \\mid y_i \\in Y \\setminus Y'\\}$. With this choice of $I$, our concept correctly isolates $Y'$.\n*   For example, to obtain the subset $Y' = \\{y_1, y_3\\}$, its complement is $\\{y_2, y_4\\}$. We choose $I=\\{2, 4\\}$. The corresponding concept is $C_2 \\cap C_4 = (Y \\setminus \\{y_2\\}) \\cap (Y \\setminus \\{y_4\\}) = Y \\setminus \\{y_2, y_4\\} = \\{y_1, y_3\\} = Y'$.\n\nSince we can generate any of the $2^4$ subsets of $Y$, the set $Y$ (of size 4) is shattered.\nThis proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we established that the VC dimension is at most 4 and at least 4. Therefore, the VC dimension must be exactly 4."
