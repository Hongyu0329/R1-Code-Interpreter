    "**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Goal:** The objective is to construct a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume is a 3D data cube, commonly represented as `f(x, y, λ)`, where `(x, y)` are the spatial coordinates and `λ` is the wavelength. Capturing this from a \"single image\" means all the necessary data must be acquired in one snapshot on a 2D sensor.\n\n2.  **Identify the Technique:** The method specified is \"computed tomography\" (CT). CT works by reconstructing an N-dimensional object from its projections. The mathematical foundation for this is the Fourier Slice Theorem, which states that the Fourier transform of a projection of an object is a slice of the Fourier transform of the object itself.\n\n3.  **Apply Tomography to Spectral Imaging:**\n    *   Our \"object\" is the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n    *   Its Fourier transform is a 3D volume `F(kx, ky, kλ)`.\n    *   To reconstruct this 3D Fourier volume, we need to sample it with multiple \"slices\".\n    *   A \"slice\" is a 2D plane within the 3D Fourier volume.\n    *   To span a 3D space, a minimum of three non-coplanar planes are required. Therefore, we need a minimum of **three** distinct projections whose Fourier transforms are not coplanar.\n\n4.  **How Projections are Generated:** The projections are created by using diffraction gratings to disperse the light from the scene onto the 2D sensor.\n    *   **Projection 1 (0th order):** An undispersed image can be considered a projection. This is what you would get with no grating, or the \"0th order\" light from a grating. It integrates the spectral data at each point: `P₀(x, y) = ∫ f(x, y, λ) dλ`. Its Fourier transform samples the `kλ = 0` plane in the 3D Fourier space.\n    *   **Projection 2 (1st Grating):** A 1D diffraction grating (e.g., aligned to disperse along the x-axis) will produce a spectrally dispersed image. This is a second, different projection of the data cube. Its Fourier transform will be a plane tilted with respect to the first plane. However, all the projections from a single 1D grating (the 0th order, +1 order, -1 order, etc.) correspond to Fourier planes that are co-linear. This means they all lie on a single \"hinge\" and cannot span the full 3D space. This results in what is known as the \"missing cone\" problem in tomography, where significant information is lost. Therefore, one grating is insufficient.\n    *   **Projection 3 (2nd Grating):** To get a third, non-coplanar projection, we need to disperse the light in a different direction. This requires a second diffraction grating, oriented differently from the first (e.g., perpendicular to it, to disperse along the y-axis). This second grating provides a new projection, and its Fourier slice will be a plane that is not coplanar with the first two.\n\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n    *   With **zero** gratings, we only get one projection (the grayscale image). This is not enough.\n    *   With **one** 1D grating, we get the undispersed 0th order and a set of dispersed orders (e.g., along the x-axis). This gives us only two non-identical projection types (the undispersed one and the dispersed one). As explained above, this is insufficient for a full 3D reconstruction.\n    *   With **two** 1D gratings (oriented orthogonally), we can generate the three necessary projections:\n        1.  The undispersed 0th order image (`P₀`).\n        2.  A projection dispersed along the x-axis (`P_x`), from the first grating.\n        3.  A projection dispersed along the y-axis (`P_y`), from the second grating.\n    These three projections provide three non-coplanar slices in the Fourier domain, which is the minimum requirement to mathematically reconstruct the 3D data cube.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   The term \"single image\" refers to a single snapshot acquisition, not that the image itself is simple. The image captured on the sensor is a complex multiplexed combination of different projections.\n*   In a practical instrument like a Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometer (CTIS), the two orthogonal gratings are often combined into a single optical element called a 2D diffraction grating or a computer-generated hologram (CGH). However, this single component is fundamentally performing the function of two distinct gratings.\n*   The question asks for the minimum number of *gratings*, not projections. To generate the minimum three necessary projections, the functionality of two gratings is required.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nA single grating provides dispersion along only one axis, which is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction of a 3D volume. To provide the necessary non-collinear projections, dispersion along a second, independent axis is required. This necessitates the use of a second grating. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings is 2.\n\n<<<B>>>"
