Based on its role in promoting a less exhausted, more persistent memory T cell phenotype, interleukin-15 would be predicted to enhance the effector function of CAR T cells. Therefore, upon target antigen stimulation, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would exhibit an increased and more sustained release of cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) compared to T cells manufactured without it.
