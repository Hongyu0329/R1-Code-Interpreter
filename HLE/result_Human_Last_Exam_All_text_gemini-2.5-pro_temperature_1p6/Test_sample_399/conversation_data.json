    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are given a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with an initial condition. This is an initial value problem (IVP).\n-   Differential Equation: $x'(t)=(t-1) \\cdot x^2(t)$\n-   Initial Condition: $x(0)=-8$\nThe goal is to find the value of the solution $x(t)$ at the point $t=1$, i.e., to find $x(1)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Differential Equation**\nThe equation is of the form $x' = f(t)g(x)$, where $f(t) = t-1$ and $g(x) = x^2$. This means it is a **separable differential equation**.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Solution**\n\n**Step A: Separate the variables.**\nRewrite $x'(t)$ as $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nTo separate variables, we want to move all terms involving $x$ to the left side with $dx$, and all terms involving $t$ to the right side with $dt$.\n\n**Careful Point:** We will divide by $x^2$. This is valid only if $x^2 \\neq 0$, meaning $x \\neq 0$. We should check if $x(t)=0$ is a solution. If we substitute $x(t)=0$ into the ODE, we get $0 = (t-1) \\cdot 0^2$, which is $0=0$. So, $x(t)=0$ is a valid constant solution (an equilibrium solution). However, our initial condition is $x(0)=-8$, which is not zero. Therefore, the particular solution we are looking for is not the trivial solution $x(t)=0$, and we can safely divide by $x^2$.\n\nPerforming the separation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**Step B: Integrate both sides.**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n-   Left side: $\\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x}$\n-   Right side: $\\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t$\n\nCombining them, we get the general solution in implicit form. We add a single constant of integration, $C$, to one side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**Careful Point:** Remember the negative sign from the integral of $x^{-2}$. Forgetting this is a common mistake.\n\n**Step C: Use the initial condition to find the constant C.**\nWe are given the initial condition $x(0)=-8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into our general solution:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{(0)^2}{2} - (0) + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\nSo, we find that $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**Careful Point:** Be cautious with the signs during substitution. Here, $-\\frac{1}{-8}$ becomes $+\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\n**Step D: Write the particular solution.**\nSubstitute the value of $C$ back into the general solution to get the particular solution for this IVP:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\nTo make it easier to work with, we can solve for $x(t)$ explicitly. First, multiply by -1:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x} = - \\left( \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} $$\nNow, take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{1}{-\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}} $$\nTo clear the fractions in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 8:\n$$ x(t) = \\frac{8}{8 \\left( -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8} \\right)} = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1} $$\n\n**Step E: Calculate the final answer, x(1).**\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into our particular solution:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{4 - 1} $$\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n**Final check of all steps:**\n- The equation was correctly identified as separable.\n- The separation of variables was performed correctly.\n- Integration was done correctly.\n- The constant of integration was calculated correctly using the initial condition.\n- The particular solution was derived correctly.\n- The final calculation for $x(1)$ is arithmetically correct.\nThe steps and reasoning are sound.\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
