The primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Contraction Principle, applied in the context of complete metric spaces. The conditions are as follows:

1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty complete metric spaces with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.

2.  **Contraction Requirement:** The functions `F: X × Y × Z → X`, `G: Y × X × Y → Y`, and `H: Z × Y × X → Z` must jointly satisfy a contraction condition. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:

    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`

If these two conditions are met, then there exists a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.
