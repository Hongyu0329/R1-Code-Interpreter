    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Concept: Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (also known as Trisyllabic Shortening) is a historical sound change rule in English. It states that a tense (or long) vowel becomes lax (or short) when it is in the antepenultimate syllable, which is the third syllable from the end of a word.\n\nTo identify if a word has undergone this process, we look for two things:\n1.  The word is at least three syllables long (or was historically, before other sound changes).\n2.  It has a lax vowel in the third-to-last syllable.\n3.  There is a related, shorter word (often the base form) where the corresponding vowel is tense.\n\n*   **Tense Vowels:** /eɪ/ (as in s**a**ne), /iː/ (as in ser**e**ne), /aɪ/ (as in d**i**vine), /oʊ/ (as in c**o**ne), /uː/ (as in pr**o**fuse).\n*   **Lax Vowels:** /æ/ (as in s**a**nity), /ɛ/ (as in ser**e**nity), /ɪ/ (as in d**i**vinity), /ɒ/ (as in c**o**nic), /ʌ/ (as in prof**u**ndity).\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze Each Word**\n\nLet's examine each word in the list to see if it fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing by comparing it to its base form.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Analysis:** The related base word is `south` /saʊθ/, which has a tense diphthong /aʊ/. In `southern` /ˈsʌðərn/, this vowel becomes the lax vowel /ʌ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Although `southern` is only two syllables today, the shortening process happened historically when the word had three syllables (Old English *sūþerne*). The long vowel *ū* was shortened because it was followed by two syllables.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Analysis:** The related base word is `derive` /dɪˈraɪv/, with the tense diphthong /aɪ/. In `derivative` /dɪˈrɪvətɪv/, the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable (de-**riv**-a-tive) and becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing. This is a classic example.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Analysis:** The related base word is `serene` /səˈriːn/, with the tense vowel /iː/. In `serenity` /səˈrɛnəti/, the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable (se-**ren**-i-ty) and becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing. Another classic example.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Analysis:** The related base word is `please` /pliːz/, with the tense vowel /iː/. In `pleasant` /ˈplɛzənt/, this vowel becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Similar to `southern`, this is a two-syllable word. The shortening here is often called \"pre-cluster shortening\" (occurring before a consonant cluster). However, it demonstrates the same fundamental process of a tense vowel in a base becoming lax when a suffix is added.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone this type of historical vowel shortening.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Analysis:** A related word is `grateful` /ˈɡreɪtfʊl/, where the stem vowel is the tense diphthong /eɪ/. In `gratitude` /ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/, the vowel is in the third-to-last syllable (**grat**-i-tude) and becomes the lax vowel /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Analysis:** The word `shadow` /ˈʃædoʊ/ has a lax vowel /æ/ in its first syllable. Is there a related base word with a tense vowel from which it was derived?\n    *   **Careful Point:** One might think of the word `shade` (/ʃeɪd/), which has a tense vowel. However, `shadow` is not derived from `shade` by adding a suffix. They are cognates that evolved from two different but related Old English nouns: `shadow` from *sceadu* (which had a short vowel) and `shade` from *scead* (which became long).\n    *   **Conclusion:** The vowel in `shadow` was historically short. It never underwent a process of shortening from a tense vowel. Therefore, it **has not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### **Step 3: Final Answer Determination**\n\nBased on the analysis, `southern`, `derivative`, `serenity`, `pleasant`, and `gratitude` all show evidence of a tense vowel in a base form becoming lax in the derived form. `Shadow` does not show this pattern; its stem vowel has always been lax.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
