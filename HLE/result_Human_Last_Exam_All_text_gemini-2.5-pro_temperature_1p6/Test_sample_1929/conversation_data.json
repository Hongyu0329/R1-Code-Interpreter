    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants**\n*   **Reactant A: Butadiene.** The common name \"butadiene\" almost always refers to 1,3-butadiene. It is a conjugated diene with the chemical formula C₄H₆ and the structure CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂.\n*   **Reactant B: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** This is an alkene derivative. Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂, with two chlorine atoms on one carbon of the double bond and two fluorine atoms on the other.\n\n**2. Identify the Type of Reaction**\n*   The reaction involves a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene, a 4π-electron system) and an alkene (1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, a 2π-electron system).\n*   This is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the π electrons from the diene and the dienophile rearrange in a concerted fashion to form a new six-membered ring containing one double bond.\n\n**3. Determine the Product's Connectivity**\n*   The reaction mechanism involves the formation of two new single bonds (sigma bonds) and one new double bond (pi bond) at the expense of three existing pi bonds.\n*   Let's number the carbons of the reactants to trace their positions in the product:\n    *   1,3-Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: C⁵Cl₂=C⁶F₂\n*   A new sigma bond forms between C¹ of the diene and one carbon of the dienophile (e.g., C⁵).\n*   A second new sigma bond forms between C⁴ of the diene and the other carbon of the dienophile (C⁶).\n*   The double bond of the dienophile (C⁵=C⁶) becomes a single bond.\n*   The two double bonds of the diene are rearranged, and a new double bond forms between C² and C³.\n*   The resulting product is a six-membered ring, specifically a derivative of cyclohexene.\n\n**4. Analyze Regiochemistry and Stereochemistry**\n*   **Regiochemistry:** This considers the orientation of an unsymmetrical dienophile relative to an unsymmetrical diene. Here, the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical. Therefore, regardless of which way the unsymmetrical dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) adds, it will lead to the same single product. The -CCl₂- group and the -CF₂- group will be on adjacent carbons in the newly formed ring.\n*   **Stereochemistry:** The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific, meaning the stereochemistry of the reactants is preserved in the product. However, in this specific case, the dienophile has geminal substituents (two identical atoms on each carbon), and the resulting product has no chiral centers. Therefore, we do not need to consider endo/exo products or enantiomers. The product is a single, achiral molecule.\n\n**5. Draw and Name the Final Product**\n*   The product structure is a cyclohexene ring. The double bond is located where the C²-C³ single bond was in the diene. The carbons that were part of the dienophile's double bond are now saturated (sp³ hybridized) and are part of the ring. One of these carbons bears two chlorine atoms, and the adjacent carbon bears two fluorine atoms.\n\n    The structure is:\n          H  H\n           \\ /\n         -C==C-\n        /      \\\n    H₂C        CH₂\n      |          |\n    Cl₂C ------ CF₂\n\n*   **IUPAC Naming:**\n    1.  The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n    2.  Numbering of the ring must start at the double bond, giving the two carbons of the double bond the locants 1 and 2.\n    3.  We number around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. Let's try numbering clockwise, starting from the top right carbon of the double bond as C1:\n        *   C1, C2 are the double bond carbons.\n        *   C3 is a -CH₂- group.\n        *   C4 has the two fluorine atoms (-CF₂-).\n        *   C5 has the two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂-).\n        *   C6 is a -CH₂- group.\n        This gives locants {4,4} for fluoro and {5,5} for chloro.\n    4.  Let's try numbering counter-clockwise, starting from the top left carbon of the double bond as C1:\n        *   C1, C2 are the double bond carbons.\n        *   C3 is a -CH₂- group.\n        *   C4 has the two chlorine atoms (-CCl₂-).\n        *   C5 has the two fluorine atoms (-CF₂-).\n        *   C6 is a -CH₂- group.\n        This gives locants {4,4} for chloro and {5,5} for fluoro.\n    5.  Both numbering schemes yield the same set of locants: {4,4,5,5}. According to IUPAC rules, when there is a choice of numbering, we assign the lower numbers based on the alphabetical order of the substituents. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\".\n    6.  Therefore, we choose the numbering scheme that gives the chloro groups the lower locant set, which is {4,4}.\n    7.  The final name is constructed by listing the substituents alphabetically: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder [4+2] cycloaddition. This reaction forms a six-membered ring. The resulting product is named by identifying the parent cyclohexene ring and numbering it to give the double bond and substituents the lowest possible locants, following alphabetical priority.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene>>>"
