    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question about the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\" in MLB\nIn Major League Baseball, the term \"Triple Crown\" can refer to two different achievements, one for batters and one for pitchers.\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player leads their respective league (American League or National League) in three key statistical categories in a single season: **batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher leads their league in three key categories: **wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA)**.\n\nWhen the term \"Triple Crown\" is used without specifying \"batting\" or \"pitching,\" it most commonly refers to the **batting Triple Crown**, as it is an older and, in the modern era, rarer achievement.\n\n### Step 2: List and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nThe question asks for the number of \"winners,\" which implies counting the number of unique players who have achieved the feat, not the total number of times it has been accomplished.\n\n**National League (NL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\nThere have been 7 different players to win the NL Batting Triple Crown.\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894)\n4.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912)\n5.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922, 1925) - *Won twice*\n6.  **Chuck Klein** (1933)\n7.  **Joe Medwick** (1937)\n\n**American League (AL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\nThere have been 9 different players to win the AL Batting Triple Crown.\n1.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901)\n2.  **Ty Cobb** (1909)\n3.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933)\n4.  **Lou Gehrig** (1934)\n5.  **Ted Williams** (1942, 1947) - *Won twice*\n6.  **Mickey Mantle** (1956)\n7.  **Frank Robinson** (1966)\n8.  **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967)\n9.  **Miguel Cabrera** (2012)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Batting Triple Crown Winners\nTo find the total number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown, we add the number of unique winners from each league.\n*   Number of unique NL winners: 7\n*   Number of unique AL winners: 9\n*   Total unique winners = 7 + 9 = **16**\n\n### Careful Points and Additional Information\n*   **Unique Players vs. Total Instances:** While there are 16 unique winners of the batting Triple Crown, the feat has been accomplished 18 times in total, as Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won it twice.\n*   **The Most Recent Winner:** The last player to win the batting Triple Crown was Miguel Cabrera in 2012, breaking a 45-year drought.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown Winners:** For the sake of completeness, it is useful to know the numbers for the Pitching Triple Crown as well. There have been **24 unique players** who have won the Pitching Triple Crown a total of 34 times.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nBased on the common usage of the term and the phrasing of the question, the most direct answer is the number of unique individuals who have won the batting Triple Crown. As calculated above, this number is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
