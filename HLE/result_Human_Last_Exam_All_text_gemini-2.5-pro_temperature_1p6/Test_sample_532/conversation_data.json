    "Answering this question requires a careful step-by-step analysis of the definitions provided.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definitions\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any elements `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same element), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be concisely written as `S² ∩ S = ∅`, where `S² = {ab | a, b ∈ S}`.\n\n2.  **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set (MPFS):** A product-free set `M` is called maximum by inclusion (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **Filled Group:** A group `G` is called a \"filled group\" if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G`. Let `mathcal(M)` be the collection of all MPFSs in `G`. The condition is `∪_{M ∈ mathcal(M)} M = G`.\n\n4.  **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the \"Filled Group\" Condition\n\nLet's analyze the definition of a filled group literally.\n- Consider the identity element, `e`, of the group `G`.\n- Can `e` be an element of any product-free set `S`?\n- If `e ∈ S`, then by the definition of a product-free set, the product `e * e` must not be in `S`.\n- However, `e * e = e`. So the condition requires that `e ∉ S`.\n- This creates a contradiction. Therefore, the identity element `e` can never be a member of any product-free set `S`.\n- Consequently, `e` cannot be a member of any *maximal* product-free set `M`.\n- The union of all maximal product-free sets, `∪ M`, is therefore a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\n- The condition for a filled group is `∪ M = G`.\n- For this to be true, we would need `G \\ {e} = G`, which would imply `{e}` is an empty set. This is only possible if `G` itself has no elements, which is not a group.\n- The only potential exception is the trivial group `G = {e}`. In this group, the only subset containing `e` is `{e}` itself. It is not product-free because `e*e=e`. The only product-free set is the empty set, `∅`. The empty set is trivially maximal because adding the only other element, `e`, makes the set `{e}` not product-free. So, the collection of all MPFSs is `{∅}`. The union is `∅`. The condition `∪ M = G` becomes `∅ = {e}`, which is false.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** A strict and literal interpretation of the question \"fills G\" leads to the conclusion that **no group is a filled group**.\n\n### Step 3: Use the Standard Interpretation in the Literature\n\nThe issue identified in Step 2 is well-known. In the mathematical field that studies this property, the term \"filled group\" is commonly understood to mean that the union of all maximal product-free sets **fills the set of non-identity elements**.\n\n*   **Corrected Definition of Filled Group:** A group `G` is filled if `∪_{M ∈ mathcal(M)} M = G \\ {e}`.\n\nThis condition is equivalent to stating that every non-identity element of `G` belongs to at least one maximal product-free set.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Corrected Definition\n\nLet's determine which groups satisfy this corrected definition.\n\n1.  The condition `∪ M = G \\ {e}` is met if and only if for every `g ∈ G \\ {e}`, there exists an MPFS `M` such that `g ∈ M`.\n2.  By Zorn's lemma (or simply by iterative extension in a finite group), any product-free set is contained within some maximal product-free set.\n3.  Therefore, the condition simplifies to: for every `g ∈ G \\ {e}`, `g` must belong to at least one **product-free set**.\n4.  Let's test this. Pick any element `g ∈ G` such that `g ≠ e`. Consider the singleton set `S = {g}`.\n5.  Is `S` a product-free set? According to the definition, we must check if `S ∩ S² = ∅`.\n    -   `S² = {g * g} = {g²}`.\n    -   The condition becomes `{g} ∩ {g²} = ∅`.\n    -   This is equivalent to the statement `g ≠ g²`.\n6.  In any group, if `g = g²`, we can multiply by `g⁻¹` to get `e = g`.\n7.  Since we chose `g ≠ e`, it must be that `g ≠ g²`.\n8.  Therefore, for any non-identity element `g`, the set `{g}` is a product-free set.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** This logical deduction seems to show that every non-identity element belongs to a product-free set (namely, the set containing only itself). This implies that *every finite group* is filled according to the standard corrected definition. Some of the research literature on this topic is known to be confusing due to the use of non-standard definitions for \"maximal\", but based on the definitions provided in the question, this conclusion is robust.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  According to the standard definitions of \"product-free set\" and \"maximum by inclusion\", every non-identity element `g` of a finite group `G` constitutes a product-free set `{g}`.\n2.  Every product-free set is contained in a maximal product-free set.\n3.  Therefore, every non-identity element `g` of `G` is contained in at least one maximal product-free set.\n4.  This means the union of all maximal product-free sets is `G \\ {e}`.\n5.  Thus, under the standard interpretation of the terminology, **all finite groups are filled**.\n6.  The question asks to identify the finite **nilpotent** groups that are filled.\n7.  Since all finite groups are filled, it follows that all finite nilpotent groups are filled.\n\n<<<All finite nilpotent groups.>>>"
