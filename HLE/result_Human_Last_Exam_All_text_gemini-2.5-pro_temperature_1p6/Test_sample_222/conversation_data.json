    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Define the Sequence**\n\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two sequences, x(n) and h(n).\n*   `X(k) = DFT{x(n)} = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n*   `H(k) = DFT{h(n)} = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n\nWe need to find the 8-point DFT of a new sequence, let's call it `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\nThe sequence `y(n)` is:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n**2. Relate the DFT of the Interleaved Sequence to the Original DFTs**\n\nThis problem can be solved efficiently using the principles of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, specifically the decimation-in-time approach.\n\nLet `Y(k)` be the 8-point DFT of `y(n)`. The formula for the DFT is:\n`Y(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_8 = exp(-j*2*π/8)`.\n\nWe can split this sum into even and odd indexed terms of `y(n)`.\n*   The even-indexed terms of `y(n)` are `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   The odd-indexed terms of `y(n)` are `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\nThe formula for the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be expressed in terms of the 4-point DFTs of its even and odd parts. Let `g(m) = x(m)` and `v(m) = h(m)`. Their 4-point DFTs are `G(k) = X(k)` and `V(k) = H(k)`.\n\nThe standard decimation-in-time formula states:\nFor `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n*   `Y(k) = G(k) + W_8^k * V(k)`\n*   `Y(k+4) = G(k) - W_8^k * V(k)`\n\nSubstituting `G(k) = X(k)` and `V(k) = H(k)`, we get:\nFor `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`:\n*   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)`\n*   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)`\n\n**3. Careful Point: Calculate the Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`**\n\nWe need to calculate the \"twiddle factors\" `W_8^k` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n`W_8 = exp(-j*2*π/8) = exp(-j*π/4) = cos(π/4) - j*sin(π/4) = (1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n\n*   `W_8^0 = 1`\n*   `W_8^1 = (1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n*   `W_8^2 = (W_8^1)^2 = ((1-j)^2)/2 = (1 - 2j + j^2)/2 = -2j/2 = -j`\n*   `W_8^3 = W_8^2 * W_8^1 = (-j) * (1-j)/sqrt(2) = (-j + j^2)/sqrt(2) = (-1-j)/sqrt(2)`\n\n**4. Calculate the Product Term `W_8^k * H(k)`**\n\nNow we compute the product `W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n*   **k=0:** `W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 * 0 = 0`\n*   **k=1:** `W_8^1 * H(1) = ( (1-j)/sqrt(2) ) * (1+j) = (1 - j^2)/sqrt(2) = (1 - (-1))/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)`\n*   **k=2:** `W_8^2 * H(2) = (-j) * 1 = -j`\n*   **k=3:** `W_8^3 * H(3) = ( (-1-j)/sqrt(2) ) * (1-j) = (-1 + j - j + j^2)/sqrt(2) = (-1 - 1)/sqrt(2) = -2/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2)`\n\nLet's call this resulting vector `P(k) = [0, sqrt(2), -j, -sqrt(2)]`.\n\n**5. Calculate the Final DFT `Y(k)`**\n\nNow we can compute the two halves of `Y(k)`.\n\n**First half (k = 0, 1, 2, 3): `Y(k) = X(k) + P(k)`**\n*   `Y(0) = X(0) + P(0) = 1 + 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(1) = X(1) + P(1) = j + sqrt(2)`\n*   `Y(2) = X(2) + P(2) = -1 + (-j) = -1 - j`\n*   `Y(3) = X(3) + P(3) = -j + (-sqrt(2)) = -j - sqrt(2)`\n\n**Second half (k = 4, 5, 6, 7): `Y(k+4) = X(k) - P(k)`**\n*   `Y(4) = X(0) - P(0) = 1 - 0 = 1`\n*   `Y(5) = X(1) - P(1) = j - sqrt(2)`\n*   `Y(6) = X(2) - P(2) = -1 - (-j) = -1 + j`\n*   `Y(7) = X(3) - P(3) = -j - (-sqrt(2)) = -j + sqrt(2)`\n\n**6. Combine the Results**\n\nCombining the two halves gives the complete 8-point DFT `Y(k)`:\n`Y(k) = [1, j+sqrt(2), -1-j, -j-sqrt(2), 1, j-sqrt(2), -1+j, -j+sqrt(2)]`\n\nFinal Answer Acquired.\n\n<<<[1, j+sqrt(2), -1-j, -j-sqrt(2), 1, j-sqrt(2), -1+j, -j+sqrt(2)]>>>"
