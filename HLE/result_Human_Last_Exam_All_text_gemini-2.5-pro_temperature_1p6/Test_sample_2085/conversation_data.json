    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Name and its Origin**\n\n*   **The Name:** Odobeccus was a historical figure, a general of Frankish origin who served in the Roman army in Gaul during the early 5th century.\n*   **The Language:** The user asks for the equivalent of the \"Gaulish\" name. This is the first careful point to consider. While Odobeccus lived and operated in Gaul, his name is not Gaulish (Celtic) but **Germanic** (specifically, Frankish). The name is known to us through its Latinized form, \"Odobeccus\". This distinction is crucial because the etymology and subsequent evolution depend on its Germanic roots, not Gaulish ones.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the Etymology of \"Odobeccus\"**\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" can be broken down into two Germanic elements.\n\n*   **First Element: *Odo-***\n    *   This component comes from the Proto-Germanic root `*audaz`, which means \"wealth,\" \"riches,\" or \"property.\"\n    *   This is a very common element in Germanic names and is the foundation of many well-known names like *Odoacer*, *Otto*, and the French names *Odon* and *Eudes*.\n\n*   **Second Element: *-beccus***\n    *   This is the Latinized form of the second part of the name. Its exact Germanic root is less certain than the first.\n    *   It is not a common name-forming suffix in French personal names. In linguistic evolution, unusual or complex endings of foreign names are often dropped or simplified.\n    *   Therefore, when looking for a modern \"equivalent,\" we must focus on the core, recognizable element that survived in the language, which is *Odo-*.\n\n**Step 3: Trace the Linguistic Evolution into French**\n\n*   The Franks, a Germanic people, conquered Roman Gaul and established the kingdom that would become France. They brought their language and naming traditions with them, which heavily influenced Old French.\n*   The Germanic root *Odo* became a very popular name among the Frankish nobility.\n*   In its evolution into Old French, *Odo* became **Odon**.\n*   Another very common and historically important variant of this name in French is **Eudes**. King Odo of France, who reigned from 888 to 898, is known as *Eudes* in modern French. Both *Odon* and *Eudes* stem from the same Germanic root `*audaz`.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Modern French Equivalent**\n\n*   The full name \"Odobeccus\" did not survive into modern French. No French name exists that is a direct transliteration.\n*   The equivalent name is the one that descends from its most significant root. As established, this root is *Odo*.\n*   The most direct descendant of *Odo* in modern French is **Odon**.\n*   **Eudes** is an equally valid descendant and a historically significant variant.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Origin Correction:** The name is Germanic (Frankish), not Gaulish. This is the most important point for a correct etymological analysis.\n2.  **Focus on the Root:** The modern equivalent is not derived from the full, Latinized name but from its core Germanic root (`*audaz` -> *Odo*).\n3.  **Loss of Suffix:** The second part of the name, `-beccus`, was not retained in the French personal names that evolved from this root.\n4.  **Multiple Equivalents:** There can be more than one modern form derived from the same ancient root. In this case, both *Odon* and *Eudes* are correct descendants, with *Odon* being phonetically and morphologically closer to the original element *Odo*.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe modern French equivalent for the name \"Odobeccus\" is found by tracing its primary root, *Odo-*. This root evolved into the French name **Odon**. A prominent historical alternative is **Eudes**. Given its directness, Odon is the most fitting equivalent.\n\n<<<Odon>>>"
