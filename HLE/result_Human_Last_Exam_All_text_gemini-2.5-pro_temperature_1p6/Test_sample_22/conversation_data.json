    "This is a great question that gets to the heart of the relationship between a theoretical population parameter and a practical predictive tool in genetics. Let's break it down.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability is a population parameter. It represents the proportion of the total variation in a trait (phenotype) that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically those on a standard genotyping chip.\n    *   Crucially, it represents the *theoretical maximum* variance that could be explained if we knew the *true* effect size of every single one of those SNPs and combined them perfectly into a linear predictor. It is the \"ceiling\" of predictability for a linear model using these SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A Polygenic Score is a practical tool. It's a single value for an individual, calculated by summing up their alleles at many SNPs, with each allele weighted by its *estimated* effect size.\n    *   These effect sizes are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Because any real-world GWAS has a finite sample size, these estimates are not the true effect sizes; they contain statistical noise or \"estimation error.\"\n    *   The predictive ability of the PGS is measured by how well it predicts the trait in a *new, independent* set of individuals. This is typically quantified as R² (the proportion of variance in the trait explained by the PGS).\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   The SNP heritability (h²_SNP) is the **upper bound** or theoretical limit. It's what a \"perfect\" PGS, built with true effect sizes, would achieve.\n    *   A real-world PGS is an **imperfect** predictor. Its performance is degraded by several factors that are unavoidable in practice.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Estimation Error:** The primary reason for the gap is that the SNP effects used to build a PGS are derived from a GWAS of a finite size. This introduces sampling error, meaning the estimated effects are not the true effects. The smaller the GWAS, the larger the error, and the lower the predictive ability of the resulting PGS.\n2.  **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWASs often identify SNPs that are not the causal variants themselves but are simply correlated (in LD with) the true causal variants. This imperfect tagging means the full genetic effect is not captured.\n3.  **GWAS Sample Size:** The predictive ability of a PGS is directly dependent on the statistical power of the GWAS used to generate the weights. As the GWAS sample size (N) increases, the effect size estimates become more precise, and the PGS's predictive ability (R²) gets closer to the SNP heritability (h²_SNP). However, with a finite N, R² will always be less than h²_SNP.\n4.  **The word \"necessarily\":** This is a strong word. It implies that the relationship must always hold. Given that h²_SNP is defined as the theoretical maximum variance explainable by the SNPs in an optimal linear model, and a PGS is an *imperfect, estimated* version of that optimal model, the variance explained by the imperfect version must be lower than the theoretical maximum. The only way they could be equal is in a theoretical scenario with an infinitely large GWAS sample, which is impossible in reality. Therefore, in any practical or achievable context, the PGS predictive ability is *necessarily* lower.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nThe SNP heritability sets the ceiling for how much of a trait's variance can be predicted using common SNPs in a linear model. A polygenic score is our practical attempt to reach that ceiling. Due to real-world limitations, primarily the statistical uncertainty in estimating SNP effects from finite data, our attempt will always fall short. Therefore, the variance explained by a polygenic score is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n<<<True>>>"
