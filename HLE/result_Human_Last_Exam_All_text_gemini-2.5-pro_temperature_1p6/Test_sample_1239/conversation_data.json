    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\\nu$ describe the evolution of the velocity field $\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x})$ and pressure field $p(t, \\mathbf{x})$ in three spatial dimensions ($\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$) and time $t$. We can set $\\rho=1$ without loss of generality by scaling the pressure. The equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:**\n    $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = - \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:**\n    $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nThis is a system of four scalar partial differential equations for the four scalar functions $u_1, u_2, u_3, p$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Lie group of symmetries\nA Lie group of symmetries of a system of differential equations is a continuous group of transformations acting on the independent variables ($t, x_1, x_2, x_3$) and dependent variables ($\\mathbf{u}, p$) that maps any solution of the system to another solution. The dimension of the group is the number of independent parameters that define the group transformations. This is equal to the dimension of the corresponding Lie algebra, which is spanned by the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformations.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the symmetry generators\nWe systematically look for one-parameter groups of transformations that leave the equations invariant. For each group, we identify its infinitesimal generator.\n\n1.  **Time translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on time $t$. Therefore, if $(\\mathbf{u}(t, \\mathbf{x}), p(t, \\mathbf{x}))$ is a solution, so is $(\\mathbf{u}(t+s, \\mathbf{x}), p(t+s, \\mathbf{x}))$ for any constant $s$.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow t+s$\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n    *   Number of generators: 1\n\n2.  **Space translations:** The equations have constant coefficients and are defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Thus, they are invariant under spatial translations.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{s}$ for any constant vector $\\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_{x_1}, \\partial_{x_2}, \\partial_{x_3}$\n    *   Number of generators: 3\n\n3.  **Spatial rotations:** The equations are written in a vector form that is covariant under rotations. The operators $\\nabla$, $\\Delta$, and $\\cdot$ are invariant under rotations in $SO(3)$.\n    *   Transformation: $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{x}$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow R\\mathbf{u}$, where $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   Generators: $x_j \\partial_{x_i} - x_i \\partial_{x_j} + u_j \\partial_{u_i} - u_i \\partial_{u_j}$ for $(i,j) \\in \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)\\}$.\n    *   Number of generators: 3 (the dimension of $SO(3)$)\n\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** The equations are invariant under a change to a reference frame moving at a constant velocity.\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow t$, $\\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}_0 t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}_0$, for any constant vector $\\mathbf{v}_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$. The pressure $p$ remains unchanged.\n    *   Generators: $t\\partial_{x_i} + \\partial_{u_i}$ for $i=1,2,3$.\n    *   Number of generators: 3\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilations):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. We look for a transformation of the form $\\tilde{t}=\\lambda^a t, \\tilde{\\mathbf{x}}=\\lambda^b \\mathbf{x}, \\tilde{\\mathbf{u}}=\\lambda^c \\mathbf{u}, \\tilde{p}=\\lambda^d p$. By requiring that the transformed variables satisfy the same equations, we find the relations between the exponents: $a=2, b=1, c=-1, d=-2$ (up to an overall scaling of the exponents).\n    *   Transformation: $t \\rightarrow \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x} \\rightarrow \\lambda \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-1} \\mathbf{u}, p \\rightarrow \\lambda^{-2} p$.\n    *   Infinitesimal generator (for $\\lambda=e^\\epsilon \\approx 1+\\epsilon$): $2t \\partial_t + \\sum_i x_i \\partial_{x_i} - \\sum_i u_i \\partial_{u_i} - 2p \\partial_p$.\n    *   Number of generators: 1\n\n6.  **Pressure shift:** Only the gradient of the pressure, $\\nabla p$, appears in the equations. Therefore, adding a constant to the pressure does not change the equations.\n    *   Transformation: $p \\rightarrow p + c$ for any constant $c$.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_p$\n    *   Number of generators: 1\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the total dimension\nThe dimension of the Lie group of symmetries is the total number of linearly independent infinitesimal generators we have found. Summing them up:\n*   Time translation: 1\n*   Space translations: 3\n*   Rotations: 3\n*   Galilean boosts: 3\n*   Scaling: 1\n*   Pressure shift: 1\n\nTotal Dimension = $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Domain:** The analysis assumes the domain is the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The presence of boundaries would break most of these symmetries.\n*   **Viscosity:** The scaling symmetry is specific to the form of the Navier-Stokes equations, including the viscous term $\\nu \\Delta\\mathbf{u}$. The inviscid Euler equations ($\\nu=0$) have a different (larger) symmetry group.\n*   **Dimensions:** This result is specific to three spatial dimensions. The 2D Navier-Stokes equations famously have an infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra.\n*   **Pressure:** The pressure term $p$ is treated as a fundamental variable. The symmetry $\\partial_p$ is a valid point symmetry of the system as written. Although pressure can be determined by the velocity field via a Poisson equation, analyzing the system in its local form $(\\mathbf{u},p)$ is the standard approach for finding point symmetries.\n\nThe calculation shows that the Lie algebra of point symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is 12-dimensional. This is a classical result in the group analysis of differential equations.\n\n<<<12>>>"
