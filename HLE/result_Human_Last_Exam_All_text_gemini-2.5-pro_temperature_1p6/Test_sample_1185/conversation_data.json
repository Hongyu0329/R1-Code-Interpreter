    "Answering this question requires classifying the possible combinatorial structures of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected projective curve with only nodal (ordinary double point) singularities, and a finite automorphism group.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find all possible types of such curves.\n\n### **Step 1: The Genus Formula and Stability Conditions**\n\nThe structure of a stable curve can be described by its dual graph $\\Gamma$.\n*   **Vertices (V):** Each vertex `v` corresponds to an irreducible component of the curve and is decorated by its geometric genus, `g_v`.\n*   **Edges and Loops (E):** Each edge corresponds to a node connecting two different components. Each loop at a vertex corresponds to a self-intersection (a node) on a single component.\n\nThe arithmetic genus of the curve, `g`, is given by the formula:\n$g = \\sum_{v \\in V} g_v + h^1(\\Gamma)$\nwhere $h^1(\\Gamma)$ is the first Betti number (the \"number of independent cycles\") of the dual graph. For a connected graph, $h^1(\\Gamma) = E - V + 1$.\nFor this problem, we have `g = 2`.\n\nThe stability of the curve imposes constraints on the dual graph:\n1.  For any component of genus 0 (i.e., a vertex `v` with $g_v = 0$), it must have at least 3 special points (nodes). In terms of the dual graph, this means its degree (valence) must be at least 3, i.e., `deg(v) >= 3`. (A loop at a vertex contributes 2 to its degree).\n2.  For any component of genus 1 (a vertex `v` with $g_v = 1$), it must have at least 1 special point. This means `deg(v) >= 1`.\n\nWe can classify the possible stable curves by the value of $h^1(\\Gamma)$, which can be 0, 1, or 2, since $g_v \\ge 0$.\n\n### **Step 2: Classification by $h^1(\\Gamma)$**\n\n**Case 1: $h^1(\\Gamma) = 2$**\n\n*   From the genus formula, $2 = \\sum g_v + 2$, which implies $\\sum g_v = 0$.\n*   This means all components must have genus 0.\n*   By the stability condition, every vertex `v` must have $g_v=0$ and `deg(v) >= 3`.\n*   For a connected graph, the sum of degrees is $2E$. The condition `deg(v) >= 3` for all `V` vertices implies $2E \\ge 3V$.\n*   Using $h^1(\\Gamma) = E - V + 1 = 2$, we have $E = V + 1$.\n*   Substituting `E` in the inequality: $2(V+1) \\ge 3V \\implies 2V+2 \\ge 3V \\implies V \\le 2$.\n*   Since the curve is reducible (on the boundary), we must have $V \\ge 2$. So, `V=2`.\n*   If $V=2$, then $E=3$. The sum of degrees is $2E=6$. With both vertices having degree at least 3, the only possibility is that both vertices have degree 3.\n*   There are two possible graphs for two vertices with degrees (3,3) and a total of 3 edges:\n    1.  **Theta graph:** Two vertices connected by three distinct edges. This represents two rational curves ($\\mathbb{P}^1$) intersecting at three points.\n    2.  **Dumbbell graph:** Two vertices, each with a loop, connected by a single edge. This represents two rational curves, each with one node, that are attached to each other at a third node.\n\n    This gives us **two types** of stable curves.\n\n**Case 2: $h^1(\\Gamma) = 1$**\n\n*   The genus formula $2 = \\sum g_v + 1$ implies $\\sum g_v = 1$.\n*   This means exactly one component has genus 1, and all other components (if any) have genus 0.\n*   Let `v_E` be the vertex with $g_{v_E}=1$. For any other vertex `v_i`, $g_{v_i}=0$.\n*   Stability conditions: `deg(v_E) >= 1`, and `deg(v_i) >= 3` for all rational components.\n*   Let's consider the possible graphs:\n    1.  **Irreducible case:** The graph has only one vertex, `v_E`. To have $h^1(\\Gamma)=1$, the vertex must have one loop. This represents an irreducible curve of genus 1 with one node. The degree of `v_E` is 2 (a loop counts for 2), which is $\\ge 1$. This is a stable configuration.\n    2.  **Reducible case:** There are rational components. A careful analysis shows that any rational component must have degree at least 3. One can prove that the only way to achieve this is to have a single rational component `v_0` with a loop, which is then connected to the elliptic component `v_E` by a single edge.\n        *   Graph: (vertex $v_E, g=1$) --- (vertex $v_0, g=0, 1$ loop).\n        *   Let's check: $h^1(\\Gamma) = 1$ (from the loop). $\\sum g_v = 1$. Total genus is 2.\n        *   Stability: `deg(v_E) = 1` (stable). `deg(v_0) = 1 (edge) + 2 (loop) = 3` (stable).\n    \n    This gives us **two types** of stable curves.\n\n**Case 3: $h^1(\\Gamma) = 0$**\n\n*   The graph $\\Gamma$ is a tree (no cycles).\n*   The genus formula $2 = \\sum g_v + 0$ implies $\\sum g_v = 2$.\n*   Let's check if rational components are possible. A tree must have at least two leaves (vertices of degree 1). If a leaf vertex `v` has $g_v=0$, it is unstable as `deg(v)=1 < 3`. So, all leaves must have genus $\\ge 1$. If a tree had a rational component, it would need branches that eventually end in leaves, and those leaves must have genus $\\ge 1$. The sum of genera would then be at least $1+1+1=3$ (if the rational component had degree 3), which exceeds the required sum of 2. Therefore, there can be no rational components.\n*   All components must have genus $\\ge 1$. The partitions of 2 into integers $\\ge 1$ are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   (2): One component of genus 2. This is a smooth curve, not a singular one on the boundary.\n    *   (1,1): Two components of genus 1. As the graph is a tree, they must be connected by a single edge. This represents two elliptic curves attached at a single node. The degree of each vertex is 1, which is stable for genus 1 components.\n\n    This gives us **one type** of stable curve.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn total, we have found $2 + 2 + 1 = 5$ different types of stable reductions for curves of genus 2. These correspond to the distinct combinatorial types of dual graphs for stable curves of genus 2.\n\nThe five types are:\n1.  An irreducible curve of genus 1 with one node.\n2.  Two smooth elliptic curves connected at one node.\n3.  An elliptic curve connected to a rational curve with one node.\n4.  Two rational curves connected at three nodes.\n5.  Two rational curves, each with one node, connected to each other at a third node.\n\n<<<5>>>"
