    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept**\nThe question is about the fate of genes after a duplication event in eukaryotic genomes. When a gene is duplicated, the organism has a second, redundant copy. Natural selection no longer acts strongly to preserve this extra copy, as the original gene is still performing its function. The question asks for the mechanism that is *most likely* to lead to both copies being kept (*retention*) and becoming different over evolutionary time (*divergence*).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Each Answer Choice**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a molecular process where one DNA sequence replaces another homologous sequence, making them identical. In the case of duplicate genes, gene conversion would cause the two copies to become more similar, not more different. This works *against* divergence. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the most common fate of a duplicated gene. The redundant copy accumulates harmful mutations (like stop codons or frameshifts) and becomes non-functional, turning into a \"pseudogene.\" While this represents a form of divergence (one functional gene, one non-functional relic), it fails the \"retention\" criterion, as the function of the second copy is lost, not retained in a new or partial form. Therefore, this is not a mechanism for retaining two *functional* divergent genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a brand-new, beneficial function. This mechanism perfectly explains both retention (both copies are now useful and selected for) and divergence (the copies have different functions). This is a very plausible mechanism.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times. After duplication, each copy accumulates mutations that disable different *subfunctions*. For example, copy 1 loses the ability to function in the liver but works in the brain, while copy 2 loses the ability to function in the brain but works in the liver. To perform the complete original function, both copies are now required. This explains retention (losing either copy is now disadvantageous) and divergence (the copies have specialized, complementary roles).\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary pattern, describing the rapid diversification of species to fill different ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that *facilitates* adaptive radiation, it is not the *molecular mechanism* itself that acts on the genes to cause their retention and divergence. It describes a consequence at the species level, not a cause at the gene level.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Most Plausible Choices (C and D)**\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. To choose the \"most likely\" one, we must consider the probability of the events involved.\n\n*   **The challenge for Neofunctionalization:** For neofunctionalization to occur, the redundant gene copy must acquire a rare, beneficial, gain-of-function mutation *before* it is silenced by a much more common debilitating mutation (leading to pseudogenization). This is a \"race against time\" that is considered a relatively low-probability event.\n*   **The advantage of Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism relies on common loss-of-function mutations. If the ancestral gene had two functions, it is statistically more probable that one copy will randomly lose one function and the other copy will randomly lose the *other* function, compared to one copy gaining a completely new function. Once this partitioning happens, both copies become essential, rescuing the pair from being lost.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Which is \"Most Likely\"**\nBecause subfunctionalization relies on more common mutational events (loss of a subfunction) to ensure the preservation of both copies, it is considered by many evolutionary biologists to be a more probable and common initial pathway for retaining duplicate genes than neofunctionalization. It provides a \"safe harbor\" from pseudogenization, allowing time for further divergence.\n\nTherefore, subfunctionalization is the mechanism most likely responsible for the initial retention and subsequent divergence of many duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
