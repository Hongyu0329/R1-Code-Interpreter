    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Concept of Matrix Rank for a Flag**\n\nA national flag can be represented as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a \"pixel,\" and the value of the entry corresponds to the color of that pixel. The rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns in that matrix. Essentially, it's a measure of the \"complexity\" of the patterns in the flag from a linear algebra perspective.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the \"Maximal Rank\" Assumption**\n\nThe crucial part of the question is the assumption that \"values in each matrix are chosen so that the rank of each flag is maximal.\" This means we can't just assign random numbers to colors (e.g., Red=1, White=2), because that might accidentally make different patterns linearly dependent.\n\nTo maximize the rank, we should choose numerical values for the colors strategically. A robust way to do this is to ensure that the unique color patterns are linearly independent whenever possible. A common method to achieve this is to assign one color the value 0 and other colors non-zero values (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) that are not multiples of each other. This interpretation allows us to analyze the geometric patterns of the flag to determine its rank.\n\nBased on this, we can classify flag structures by their rank:\n*   **Rank 1:** These are the simplest flags. Their patterns are one-dimensional. This includes flags made of only horizontal stripes (where all row vectors are scalar multiples of each other, e.g., `[1,1,1,...]`) or only vertical stripes (where all column vectors are scalar multiples of each other).\n*   **Rank 2:** These flags have a two-dimensional complexity. Their set of row (or column) vectors can be spanned by exactly two linearly independent vectors. A common structure is a simple base pattern (like a solid field or stripes) with a single, simple, centered emblem or a cross.\n*   **Rank > 2:** These flags have complex geometric patterns, such as diagonal stripes, multiple independent symbols, or complex overlapping patterns (like a canton with a unique design laid over a striped field). These features introduce more than two linearly independent row or column patterns.\n\n**Step 3: Analyzing the Flag of Denmark**\n\nThe flag of Denmark features a red field with a white Nordic cross.\n1.  Let's assign values to the colors to maximize rank: Red = 0, White = 1.\n2.  Let's analyze the rows of the matrix:\n    *   Rows that are entirely in the red field become zero vectors: `[0, 0, ..., 0]`.\n    *   The single row forming the horizontal bar of the white cross becomes a vector of ones: `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.\n    *   Rows that cross the vertical bar of the white cross have a single '1' in a field of '0's, like: `[0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]`.\n3.  The set of all row vectors can be formed by linear combinations of just two basis vectors:\n    *   `b1 = [1, 1, ..., 1]` (representing a full horizontal stripe)\n    *   `b2 = [0, ..., 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]` (representing a single vertical element)\n4.  Since the entire flag's structure can be described by a basis of two vectors, the rank of the Danish flag is **2**.\n\n**Step 4: Finding African Flags with the Same Rank (Rank 2)**\n\nWe need to find African flags whose geometric structure is equivalent to a Rank 2 matrix. Using the classification from Step 2, we are looking for flags that are not simple stripes but also not overly complex. These are typically flags with a base pattern (solid color or simple stripes) plus a single, simple, centered emblem (star, crescent, etc.) or flags with a simple two-axis design.\n\n*   **Flags Analyzed (Rank 2 Candidates):**\n    *   **Algeria:** Vertical white and green stripes with a red star and crescent in the center. The vertical stripes form a Rank 1 base, and the central symbol adds a second dimension of complexity. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Angola:** Horizontal red and black stripes with a central yellow emblem. The horizontal stripes are the Rank 1 base, and the central emblem adds the second dimension. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Benin:** A vertical green stripe at the hoist with two horizontal stripes (yellow and red) at the fly. The row vectors are of the form `[G, Y, Y, ...]` and `[G, R, R, ...]`. These two patterns are linearly independent and span the space. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Burkina Faso:** Horizontal red and green stripes with a central yellow star. Similar to Angola, this is a Rank 1 base + a central symbol. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Ghana:** Horizontal stripes (red, yellow, green) with a central black star. This is a Rank 1 base + a central symbol. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Guinea-Bissau:** A vertical red stripe (with a black star) and two horizontal stripes (yellow and green). The structure is similar to Benin, with the added star contained within one region, so it maintains Rank 2.\n    *   **Mauritania:** A green field with red bands at the top and bottom and a central gold crescent and star. This is a Rank 1 striped base + a central symbol. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Senegal:** Vertical green, yellow, and red stripes with a green star in the center. This is a Rank 1 vertical stripe base + a central symbol. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Somalia:** A solid blue field with a single white star in the center. The solid field is the Rank 1 base, and the star is the central symbol. This gives it Rank 2.\n    *   **Tunisia:** A red field with a central white disc containing a red star and crescent. This is a solid field (Rank 1 base) + a central symbol complex. This gives it Rank 2.\n\n*   **Flags Analyzed (Not Rank 2):**\n    *   Flags with only simple horizontal/vertical stripes (e.g., Nigeria, Botswana, Mali, Gabon) are **Rank 1**.\n    *   Flags with complex patterns like diagonal stripes (e.g., DR Congo, Namibia, Tanzania, Burundi's saltire), complex \"Y\" shapes (South Africa), or complex cantons over stripes (Togo) are **Rank > 2**.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The \"Maximal Rank\" Clause is Key:** The core of the problem lies in correctly interpreting this. It directs us to analyze the fundamental geometric patterns of the flags rather than getting stuck on specific numerical assignments for colors that might reduce the rank.\n2.  **Rank Measures Pattern Complexity:** The rank is not about the number of colors but about the number of linearly independent ways those colors are arranged in rows and columns.\n3.  **Rank 1 = Unidirectional Patterns:** Flags with patterns that vary only in one direction (all horizontal stripes or all vertical stripes) have a rank of 1.\n4.  **Rank 2 = Two-Dimensional Patterns:** Flags with a simple two-axis pattern (like a Nordic cross) or a one-directional pattern plus a simple, singular added feature (like a central star) typically have a rank of 2.\n5.  **Rank > 2 = Complex Geometries:** Flags with diagonal lines, multiple distinct symbols, or complex overlapping regions have a rank greater than 2 because these features introduce too many linearly independent patterns.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the African nations whose flags have a linear algebraic rank of 2, the same as the flag of Denmark, are those with a simple two-dimensional pattern of complexity. The following flags fit this criterion:\n\n*   Algeria\n*   Angola\n*   Benin\n*   Burkina Faso\n*   Ghana\n*   Guinea-Bissau\n*   Mauritania\n*   Senegal\n*   Somalia\n*   Tunisia\n\n<<<The flags of Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal, Somalia, and Tunisia have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.>>>"
