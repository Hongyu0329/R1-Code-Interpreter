    "An analysis of the question about wallpaper groups and their point groups is performed step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe question asks for the number of wallpaper groups whose associated point group has an order of 2.\n*   **Wallpaper groups:** These are the 17 possible two-dimensional periodic patterns, also known as the plane crystallographic groups.\n*   **Point group:** For any wallpaper group, its point group (or crystal class) is the set of all symmetry operations (like rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point fixed. It describes the symmetry of the lattice points. Formally, it is the quotient group of the wallpaper group by its subgroup of translations.\n*   **Order of a group:** The number of elements (symmetry operations) in the group.\n*   **The core task:** We need to identify which of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly two symmetry operations.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Point Groups of Order 2\nFirst, we list the ten possible 2D crystallographic point groups and determine their orders. The order is the number of symmetry operations in the group.\n\n1.  **1** (or C1): Identity only. Order = 1.\n2.  **2** (or C2): Identity, 180° rotation. **Order = 2**.\n3.  **m** (or D1): Identity, reflection. **Order = 2**.\n4.  **3** (or C3): Identity, 120° rotation, 240° rotation. Order = 3.\n5.  **2mm** (or D2): Identity, 180° rotation, two reflections. Order = 4.\n6.  **4** (or C4): Identity, 90°, 180°, 270° rotations. Order = 4.\n7.  **3m** (or D3): Symmetries of an equilateral triangle. Order = 6.\n8.  **6** (or C6): Symmetries including a 60° rotation. Order = 6.\n9.  **4mm** (or D4): Symmetries of a square. Order = 8.\n10. **6mm** (or D6): Symmetries of a hexagon. Order = 12.\n\nFrom this list, the point groups with order 2 are **2 (C2)** and **m (D1)**.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the 17 Wallpaper Groups by Point Group\nNow, we must examine each of the 17 wallpaper groups and identify its point group.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 1 (Order 1):**\n    1.  **p1**: The simplest group with only translations.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 2 (Order 2):**\n    2.  **p2**: Contains translations and 2-fold (180°) rotation centers. Its point group is **2**.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group m (Order 2):**\n    3.  **pm**: Contains translations and reflection lines. Its point group is **m**.\n    4.  **pg**: Contains translations and glide-reflection lines. A glide reflection's linear part is a reflection, so its point group is also **m**.\n    5.  **cm**: Defined on a centered lattice, it has both reflection and glide-reflection lines. Its point group is **m**.\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 2mm (Order 4):**\n    6.  **pgg**\n    7.  **pmg**\n    8.  **pmm**\n    9.  **cmm**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 3 (Order 3):**\n    10. **p3**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 3m (Order 6):**\n    11. **p31m**\n    12. **p3m1**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 4 (Order 4):**\n    13. **p4**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 4mm (Order 8):**\n    14. **p4g**\n    15. **p4m**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 6 (Order 6):**\n    16. **p6**\n\n*   **Wallpaper groups with point group 6mm (Order 12):**\n    17. **p6m**\n\n### Step 4: Count and Conclude\nWe are looking for the wallpaper groups whose point group is either **2** or **m**. Based on the classification in Step 3, these are:\n1.  **p2** (Point group: 2)\n2.  **pm** (Point group: m)\n3.  **pg** (Point group: m)\n4.  **cm** (Point group: m)\n\nCounting these groups, we find there are a total of 4.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between a wallpaper group and its point group. The wallpaper group describes the symmetry of the entire infinite pattern, including translations, while the point group describes the local symmetries at a point.\n*   A glide reflection is not a point symmetry, as it involves a translation. However, the *linear part* of the glide reflection transformation is a reflection. This reflection is an element of the point group. Therefore, a wallpaper group like `pg`, which only has translations and glide reflections, has the point group `m` (D1).\n*   The order of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains, not to be confused with the n-fold rotation number (e.g., point group `4` has order 4, but point group `6` has order 6).\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe step-by-step analysis shows that there are exactly four wallpaper groups (**p2**, **pm**, **pg**, and **cm**) whose point groups have an order of 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
