    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function f(x)**\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$.\n1.  **Injectivity**: Suppose $f(a) = f(b)$ for some $a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Applying $f$ to both sides, we get $f(f(a)) = f(f(b))$. By the given equation, this means $e^a = e^b$. Since the exponential function $e^x$ is injective, it follows that $a=b$. Therefore, $f$ must be an injective function.\n2.  **Monotonicity**: The problem states that $f$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We will analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**Step 2: Case 1 - f is strictly decreasing**\n\n1.  Let's assume $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous and strictly decreasing function.\n2.  If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then its composition with itself, $f(f(x))$, must be strictly increasing. (If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$).\n3.  The function $e^x$ is strictly increasing, so a strictly decreasing $f$ is a possibility in principle.\n4.  However, consider a continuous, strictly decreasing function $f$ from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Such a function must have a unique fixed point. To see this, define a helper function $g(x) = f(x) - x$.\n    *   Since $f$ is a decreasing function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range must be $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x) = \\infty$ and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x) = -\\infty$.\n    *   Consider the limits of $g(x)$:\n        *   $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} (f(x) - x) = \\infty - (-\\infty) = \\infty$.\n        *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} g(x) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} (f(x) - x) = -\\infty - \\infty = -\\infty$.\n    *   Since $g(x)$ is continuous and goes from $+\\infty$ to $-\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one point $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $g(x_0) = 0$. This means $f(x_0) = x_0$. So, $x_0$ is a fixed point of $f$.\n5.  Now, let's use the given functional equation at this fixed point $x_0$:\n    $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n6.  The equation $f(f(x)) = e^x$ must hold for all $x$, so it must hold for $x_0$. This gives us $e^{x_0} = x_0$.\n7.  The equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions. We can see this by analyzing the function $h(x) = e^x - x$. Its derivative is $h'(x) = e^x - 1$. The minimum occurs at $x=0$, where $h(0) = e^0 - 0 = 1$. Since the minimum value of $e^x - x$ is 1, we have $e^x - x > 0$, or $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n8.  This leads to a contradiction. The existence of a fixed point $x_0$ implies $e^{x_0}=x_0$, but this equation has no solution. Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.\n9.  **Conclusion for Step 2**: There are no strictly decreasing continuous functions $f$ that satisfy the given equation. The cardinality of such functions is 0.\n\n**Step 3: Case 2 - f is strictly increasing**\n\n1.  Let's assume $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function.\n2.  If $f$ is increasing, then $f(f(x))$ is also increasing. Since $e^x$ is increasing, this case is consistent.\n3.  Let's compare $f(x)$ with $x$. If there were a fixed point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$, we would again get the contradiction $e^{x_0} = x_0$. So $f(x)$ never equals $x$.\n4.  Since $f(x)-x$ is a continuous function that is never zero, it must be either always positive or always negative.\n    *   Suppose $f(x) < x$ for all $x$. Since $f$ is increasing, applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x)) < f(x)$. Combining these gives $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. From the original equation, this implies $e^x < x$, which is false for all real $x$.\n    *   Therefore, we must have $f(x) > x$ for all $x$.\n5.  Since $f(f(x)) = e^x$ and $f(x) > x$, it follows that $e^x = f(f(x)) > f(x)$.\n6.  So, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy the double inequality: $x < f(x) < e^x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the number of increasing solutions**\n\n1.  It is a known result for this type of functional equation that a solution is uniquely determined by its values on an interval of the form $[a, f(a)]$. Let's analyze the structure of the solutions.\n2.  Let's choose a point, for instance $x=0$. Let $f(0) = b$. From the inequality in Step 3, we have $0 < f(0) < e^0$, which means $0 < b < 1$.\n3.  Using the main equation at $x=0$, we get $f(f(0)) = e^0=1$. Since $f(0)=b$, this means $f(b)=1$.\n4.  A particular increasing solution $f$ is entirely determined by its behavior on the interval $[0, b]$. On this interval, $f$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that connects the point $(0, b)$ to the point $(b, 1)$. Let's call this part of the function $h$, so $h = f|_{[0,b]}$. The properties of $h$ are:\n    *   Domain of $h$ is $[0, b]$.\n    *   Range of $h$ is $[b, 1]$.\n    *   $h$ is continuous and strictly increasing.\n    *   $h(0)=b$ and $h(b)=1$.\n5.  Any function $h$ satisfying these properties can be uniquely extended to a full solution $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}$. The function $f$ is constructed recursively on adjacent intervals. For instance, for $x \\in [b, 1]$, $x$ can be written as $x=h(t)$ for a unique $t \\in [0, b]$. Then we define $f(x) = f(h(t)) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$. This process can be continued indefinitely to cover all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n6.  Therefore, the set of all increasing solutions is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of possible initial choices. An initial choice consists of a pair $(b, h)$, where $b \\in (0,1)$ and $h: [0,b] \\to [b,1]$ is a function with the properties listed above.\n7.  Let's find the cardinality of this set of choices.\n    *   **Choice of b**: The value $b$ can be any real number in the interval $(0, 1)$. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n    *   **Choice of h**: For any fixed $b \\in (0,1)$, we need to count how many continuous, strictly increasing functions $h$ exist from $[0,b]$ to $[b,1]$. By a simple linear transformation (rescaling and shifting), this is equivalent to counting the number of continuous, strictly increasing functions $k: [0,1] \\to [0,1]$ with $k(0)=0$ and $k(1)=1$. There are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions (for example, the family of functions $k_p(t) = t^p$ for any $p>0$). Furthermore, any continuous function on $[0,1]$ is determined by its values on the rational numbers in $[0,1]$. The set of such functions is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0,1]}$, which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. So, there are exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions $h$.\n8.  The total number of increasing solutions is the product of the number of choices for $b$ and the number of choices for $h$. This is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\n*   The number of strictly decreasing continuous solutions is 0.\n*   The number of strictly increasing continuous solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   The total cardinality of the set of solutions is $0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum (the same as the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\n<<<c>>>"
