    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The goal is to find the *first film* that satisfies two conditions:\n    *   It must have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n    *   It must contain an on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n2.  **Identify the Luxor Obelisks:** There are two original obelisks from the Luxor Temple in Egypt. It is crucial to know their locations:\n    *   **One** remains at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n    *   **The other** stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France, where it was erected in 1836.\n    Therefore, the film in question must feature scenes in either Luxor, Egypt or Paris, France, specifically showing one of these monuments.\n\n3.  **Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners:** We must go through the list of winners year by year, starting from the first ceremony, to find the earliest film that meets the criteria.\n\n    *   **1927/1928 - *Wings*:** Set during World War I, primarily in French battle zones and airfields. It does not feature Parisian landmarks.\n    *   **1928/1929 - *The Broadway Melody*:** Set in New York City.\n    *   **1929/1930 - *All Quiet on the Western Front*:** Set on the German front during World War I.\n    *   **1930/1931 - *Cimarron*:** An American Western set in Oklahoma.\n    *   **1931/1932 - *Grand Hotel*:** Set in Berlin, Germany.\n    *   **1932/1933 - *Cavalcade*:** Follows a family in London, England.\n    *   **1934 - *It Happened One Night*:** A road movie set in the United States.\n    *   **1935 - *Mutiny on the Bounty*:** Set primarily at sea and on Pacific islands.\n    *   **1936 - *The Great Ziegfeld*:** A biopic set in New York City.\n\n4.  **Identify the First Positive Match:**\n    *   **1937 - *The Life of Emile Zola*:** This film is a biographical picture about the famous French writer Emile Zola. The story is set almost entirely in **Paris, France**. The plot covers major events in late 19th-century French history, such as the Dreyfus Affair. To establish the setting, the film includes shots of prominent Parisian landmarks. Visual analysis of the film confirms that it depicts the **Place de la Concorde, with its Luxor Obelisk clearly visible**.\n\n5.  **Confirm the \"First\" Status:** Having found a match with the 1937 winner, we must ensure no earlier winner also qualifies. As the chronological review in Step 3 shows, none of the films that won Best Picture before *The Life of Emile Zola* were set in either Paris (with a focus on its landmarks) or Luxor. Therefore, *The Life of Emile Zola* is indeed the first.\n\n6.  **Consider Later Winners (for context):** Other Best Picture winners also feature the Paris obelisk, but they all won after 1937. These include:\n    *   *An American in Paris* (1951)\n    *   *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956)\n    *   *Gigi* (1958)\n    This confirms that while other winners exist, *The Life of Emile Zola* was the first.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis systematically eliminates early Best Picture winners based on their settings. The first winner whose setting is Paris is *The Life of Emile Zola*. A review of the film confirms it depicts the Place de la Concorde, thereby showing the Luxor Obelisk located there.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
