    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character in William Morris's book, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must meet three distinct criteria:\n1.  They must have visited a Roman city.\n2.  They must describe the religious practices they observed there.\n3.  This description must contain details that allow a reader to recognize the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus, specifically their connection to a she-wolf.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential characters and their experiences**\n*The House of the Wolfings* is set during the conflict between a tribe of Goths (the Wolfings) and the advancing Roman army. Most characters' experiences are confined to the Gothic lands (the \"Mark\"). We need a character who has been outside the Mark and into Roman territory. The narrative establishes that one of the elders was captured in his youth and spent time as a slave among the Romans. This makes him the most likely candidate. This character is Otter.\n\n**Step 3: Locate the relevant passage in the book**\nIn Chapter V, \"Otter Addresses the Folk,\" the elder Otter speaks to the tribe, urging them to fight against the Romans. He draws upon his own past as a captive to describe Roman culture and why it is alien and threatening to the Goths. This speech is the key location for the information needed.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the character's description of Roman religion**\nIn his speech, Otter describes the Romans' city and their beliefs. The crucial part of his description is as follows:\n*   He states that the Romans \"worship their own ancestors and the founders of their city.\"\n*   He then specifies their chief object of worship: \"And the chiefest of their Gods is a She-wolf, that they have fashioned of brass... and they fall down before her and worship her and she is their mother...\"\n\n**Step 5: Connect the description to the Romulus and Remus myth**\n*   **\"A She-wolf... fashioned of brass\"**: This is a clear reference to the *Lupa Capitolina*, the famous bronze sculpture of a she-wolf, which became a symbol of Rome.\n*   **\"she is their mother\"**: This directly alludes to the foundation myth where the abandoned twins, Romulus and Remus, were found and suckled by a she-wolf. By nursing the founders of Rome, the she-wolf is seen as a symbolic mother of the Roman people.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe character who was a captive in a Roman city and describes their worship of a brass she-wolf whom they call their mother is the elder, Otter. His description is a direct reference, from a Gothic perspective, to the Roman myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
