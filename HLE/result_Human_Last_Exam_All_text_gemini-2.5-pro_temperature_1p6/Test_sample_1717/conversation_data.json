    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Base Health in Expert Mode\nFirst, we need to find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu boss in Expert Mode. This is the health value it has when there is only one player in the world.\n*   In Normal Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has 2,800 health.\n*   In Expert Mode, its base health is increased to **3,640**.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Health Scaling Formula for Multiplayer\nIn Terraria's Expert and Master Modes, boss health increases as more players join the game. The game's source code defines a specific formula for this health scaling.\n*   The formula for total health in Expert Mode is:\n    `Total Health = Base Health × (1 + 0.35 × (Number of Players - 1))`\n*   **Careful Point:** The health increase of 35% (0.35) is applied for each player *after the first one*. This is why the formula uses `(Number of Players - 1)`.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Formula to the Eye of Cthulhu\nNow, we can substitute the Eye of Cthulhu's Expert Mode base health into the formula. Let 'P' represent the number of players.\n*   `Total Health = 3,640 × (1 + 0.35 × (P - 1))`\n\nTo better understand the relationship, we can simplify this formula:\n*   `Total Health = 3,640 × (1 + 0.35P - 0.35)`\n*   `Total Health = 3,640 × (0.65 + 0.35P)`\n*   `Total Health = (3,640 × 0.65) + (3,640 × 0.35P)`\n*   `Total Health = 2,366 + 1,274P`\n\nThis simplified equation shows that the Eye of Cthulhu's health is a linear function of the number of players (P). For every player added to the game, the boss's health increases by a flat 1,274.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Theoretical Maximum for an Infinite Number of Players\nThe question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an **infinite number of players**. This requires us to find the limit of the health function as the number of players (P) approaches infinity (∞).\n*   We need to calculate: `lim (P → ∞) [2,366 + 1,274P]`\n\nAs 'P' becomes infinitely large:\n1.  The term `1,274P` also becomes infinitely large.\n2.  Adding a constant (2,366) to an infinitely large number still results in an infinitely large number.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must consider if there is a hard-coded health cap in the game. Based on analysis of the source code, there is no specific upper limit or cap applied to the boss health scaling formula. The health value is stored in a data type that can hold numbers far larger than any achievable in a practical gameplay scenario. Therefore, for this theoretical problem, we can assume the health can increase without a fixed limit.\n\nSince the health increases linearly and without a boundary as the number of players increases, the function does not converge to a specific maximum value. It grows indefinitely.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode, given an infinite number of players, is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
