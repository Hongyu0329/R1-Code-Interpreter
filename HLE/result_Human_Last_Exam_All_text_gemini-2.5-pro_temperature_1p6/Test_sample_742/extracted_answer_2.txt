No. The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical framework of Gödel's ontological proof are fundamentally incommensurate. The concepts central to Gödel's proof (e.g., "positive property," "necessary existence" as a logical modality) have no natural or meaningful representation within the mathematics of Hilbert spaces, operators, and probability amplitudes used in quantum mechanics. The two systems address different domains of inquiry (metaphysical logic vs. physical reality) using incompatible languages and tools, making it impossible for one to be a basis for proving the conclusions of the other.
