    "This problem requires us to find the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy for a gas of photons (light quanta) using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are rigorously grounded in Large Deviation Theory (LDT) like the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Conceptual Framework: LDT and Statistical Mechanics**\n\n*   **Large Deviation Theory (LDT):** Theorems like Cramer-Chernoff (for sample means) and Boltzmann-Sanov (for empirical distributions) state that the probability of observing a macroscopic state (e.g., a specific mean energy or particle distribution) that deviates from the true equilibrium state is exponentially small for a large number of particles.\n*   **Principle of Maximum Entropy:** LDT provides a formal justification for a core principle of statistical mechanics: the equilibrium state of an isolated system is the macrostate that has the maximum number of corresponding microstates (W), or equivalently, the maximum entropy ($S = k_B \\ln W$).\n*   **Application to Photon Gas:** We will find the equilibrium distribution of photons over energy levels by maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total average energy. Once we have this distribution, we can calculate the mean energy and entropy of the system.\n\n**2. The Model: Photon Gas (Bose-Einstein Statistics)**\n\n*   **Particles:** Photons are bosons, meaning they are indistinguishable and any number of them can occupy the same quantum state.\n*   **Particle Number:** The number of photons is not conserved; they can be created or absorbed by the walls of the container. This implies that the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero.\n*   **Macroscopic State:** A macrostate is defined by the set of occupation numbers $\\{n_i\\}$, where $n_i$ is the number of photons in the energy level $E_i$.\n*   **Entropy:** The number of microstates for a given macrostate of bosons is $W = \\prod_i \\frac{(n_i + g_i - 1)!}{n_i! (g_i - 1)!}$, where $g_i$ is the degeneracy (number of states) of the energy level $E_i$. The entropy is $S = k_B \\ln W$.\n*   **Constraint:** The total energy of the system is constant: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\sum_i n_i E_i$.\n\n**3. Deriving the Equilibrium Distribution**\n\nWe maximize the entropy $S$ subject to the energy constraint using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The function to maximize is $\\mathcal{L} = S - k_B\\beta (\\sum_i n_i E_i - \\langle E \\rangle)$. Using Stirling's approximation for $\\ln(W)$ and taking the derivative with respect to $n_i$ and setting it to zero gives the famous Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number:\n\n$\\langle n_i \\rangle = \\frac{g_i}{e^{\\beta E_i} - 1}$\n\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$ is the Lagrange multiplier, identified as the inverse temperature.\n\n**4. From Discrete Levels to Continuous Spectrum**\n\nFor photons in a 3D box, the energy levels are quasi-continuous. We replace the sum over levels with an integral over energy, using the density of states $g(E)$, which gives the number of states between energy E and E+dE. For photons (relativistic, spin-1 particles) in a volume V:\n\n$g(E) dE = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} E^2 dE$\n\nThe factor of 8 comes from the volume in momentum space ($4\\pi k^2 dk$), a factor of 2 for two polarization states, and the relation $E=pc=\\hbar ck$.\n\nThe average number of photons with energy E is given by $\\langle n(E) \\rangle dE = \\frac{g(E)}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE$.\n\n**5. Calculation of Equilibrium Mean Energy $\\langle E \\rangle$**\n\nThe total mean energy is the integral of energy multiplied by the number distribution over all energies:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty E \\cdot \\langle n(E) \\rangle dE = \\int_0^\\infty E \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{E^2}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE$\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E^3}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE$\n\nTo solve the integral, we make the substitution $x = \\beta E$:\n$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E^3}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE = \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\n\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann-Zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 3! \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\n\nSubstituting this back gives the mean energy:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V}{15 h^3 c^3 \\beta^4}$\n\nExpressed in terms of temperature $T$:\n$\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation in a cavity.\n\n**6. Calculation of Equilibrium Entropy $S$**\n\nThe most direct way to calculate the entropy is via the Helmholtz free energy $F$ using the grand canonical partition function $Z_{GC}$ (with $\\mu=0$).\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - F}{T}$ and $F = -k_B T \\ln Z_{GC}$\n\nThe log of the grand partition function is:\n$\\ln Z_{GC} = -\\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E_i}) \\rightarrow -\\int_0^\\infty g(E) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E}) dE$\n$\\ln Z_{GC} = -\\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\int_0^\\infty E^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E}) dE$\n\nUsing integration by parts on the integral, we can relate it to the energy integral calculated earlier:\n$\\int_0^\\infty E^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E}) dE = -\\frac{\\beta}{3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{E^3}{e^{\\beta E} - 1} dE = -\\frac{\\beta}{3} \\left( \\frac{h^3 c^3}{8 \\pi V} \\langle E \\rangle \\right)$\nSo, $\\ln Z_{GC} = -\\frac{8 \\pi V}{h^3 c^3} \\left( -\\frac{\\beta h^3 c^3}{24 \\pi V} \\langle E \\rangle \\right) = \\frac{\\beta \\langle E \\rangle}{3} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{3 k_B T}$.\n\nNow we can find the entropy $S$:\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - F}{T} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle - (-k_B T \\ln Z_{GC})}{T} = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle + k_B T (\\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{3 k_B T})}{T}$\n$S = \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle + \\langle E \\rangle / 3}{T} = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\langle E \\rangle$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3} \\right) = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B (k_B T)^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas are found by applying the principles of Bose-Einstein statistics, whose validity for large systems is supported by Large Deviation Theory.\n\n*   **Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\n\n*   **Equilibrium Entropy:**\n    $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$\n\nThese can also be related by the simple expression $S = \\frac{4}{3} \\frac{\\langle E \\rangle}{T}$.\n\n<<<Equilibrium Mean Energy: $\\langle E \\rangle = \\frac{8 \\pi^5 V (k_B T)^4}{15 h^3 c^3}$\nEquilibrium Entropy: $S = \\frac{32 \\pi^5 V k_B^4 T^3}{45 h^3 c^3}$>>>"
