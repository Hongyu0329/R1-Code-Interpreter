    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the clues provided in the question.**\n*   **Clue 1:** Andrei Voznesensky, a famous Soviet/Russian poet, called a specific man \"a joy-discovering sailor.\" This points to a poem by Voznesensky about an explorer or someone associated with sea voyages.\n*   **Clue 2:** In the same poem, Voznesensky wonders about the location of this man's grave: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This indicates that at the time the poem was written, the man's burial site was lost or unknown.\n*   **Clue 3:** A definitive timeline is given: \"The answer to this question [about the grave's location] emerged in the late 1980s.\" This means that historical or archaeological work in the late 1980s led to the discovery or identification of the burial site.\n*   **The Question:** The final goal is to identify the last name of this man.\n\n**Step 2: Connect the clues to a specific historical figure and work of art.**\n*   Andrei Voznesensky is the author of the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" («Юнона и Авось»). The libretto is based on his poem \"Saga\" («Сага»).\n*   The protagonist of both the poem and the rock opera is the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. He is often referred to poetically as a sailor or navigator due to his famous sea voyage to California.\n*   The lines \"a joy-discovering sailor\" and \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" are from Voznesensky's poem \"Saga,\" which is about Nikolai Rezanov.\n\n**Step 3: Verify the clues against the life and death of Nikolai Rezanov.**\n*   **Was his grave lost?** Yes. Nikolai Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk while returning from his expedition. He was buried in the cemetery of the Voskresensky Cathedral. However, the cathedral and its cemetery were destroyed by the Soviet authorities in the 1930s, and the exact location of his grave was lost for decades. This directly corresponds to Voznesensky's question, \"Where is your grave?\".\n*   **Was the grave's location found in the late 1980s?** Yes. Fueled by the immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was a surge of interest in Rezanov's fate. In the late 1980s, historians and archaeologists in Krasnoyarsk conducted research and excavations. They successfully identified the likely spot where Rezanov had been buried. This led to the establishment of a memorial at the site. This historical event perfectly matches the final clue.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion.**\n*   The man described is Nikolai Rezanov.\n*   He was the subject of Voznesensky's poem \"Saga.\"\n*   His grave was lost during the Soviet era.\n*   The location of his grave was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n*   The question asks for his last name.\n\nTherefore, the last name of the man is Rezanov.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
