    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Question:** The user wants to identify the specific range of verses (*bayt* or couplets) in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', where the names of the 25 prophets of Islam are enumerated.\n\n2.  **Locate the Section on Prophethood:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is a didactic poem that systematically explains the fundamentals of Islamic belief. After covering the attributes of Allah, it transitions to the topic of Prophethood (An-Nubuwwat).\n\n3.  **Identify the Introductory Verse:** Before listing the names, the author states that knowing the names of these 25 prophets is a requirement. This is done in **bayt 32**:\n    *   تَفْصِيْلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِيْنَ لَزِمْ ... كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    *   *Translation: The details of twenty-five [prophets] is necessary for every legally responsible person, so verify and seize the opportunity.*\n    This verse serves as a preamble to the list but does not itself contain any of the names.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Start of the List:** The actual enumeration of the prophets' names begins immediately in the following verse, **bayt 33**:\n    *   هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيْمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n    *   *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud along with Salih and Ibrahim - each is to be followed.*\n    This is the first verse that explicitly mentions the names.\n\n5.  **Follow the Enumeration:** The list of names continues sequentially through the next couplets:\n    *   **Bayt 34** mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 35** mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the End of the List:** The list concludes in **bayt 36**, which names the final prophets in the sequence, ending with Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (referred to by one of his names, Taha):\n    *   إِلْيَاسُ يُوْنُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى ... عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n    *   *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha the seal [of the prophets] - leave deviation.*\n    This is the final verse containing the names of the prophets.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on the Range:** Based on the above points, the verses that explicitly contain the names of the prophets start at **bayt 33** and end at **bayt 36**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Verse Numbering:** While the numbering of verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' is quite standard, minor variations might exist in some editions. However, the sequence and block of four verses containing the names are constant. The range 33-36 is the most widely cited.\n*   **Introductory vs. Naming Verses:** It is important to distinguish between the verse that introduces the list (bayt 32) and the verses that actually perform the listing (bayt 33-36). The question asks for where the names *are mentioned*.\n*   **Concluding Verse:** The verse immediately following the list (bayt 37) is a prayer for the prophets and their families and is not part of the enumeration itself.\n*   **Name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ:** The poem uses \"Taha\" (طه) in bayt 36 to refer to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, the seal of the prophets.\n\n<<<From bayt 33 to bayt 36.>>>"
