    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the differential equation and the goal.**\nThe given differential equation is an autonomous first-order ODE:\n$$x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$$\nLet $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. The equation is $x' = f(x)$.\nThe goal is to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$, where $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points of this system.\n\n**Step 2: Find the equilibrium points.**\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are the constant solutions of the differential equation. They occur where the rate of change is zero, i.e., $x'(t) = 0$ or $f(x) = 0$.\nWe need to solve the equation:\n$$-x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0$$\nFirst, we can factor out $-x$:\n$$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$$\nThe expression in the parentheses is a perfect square, $(x-1)^2$. So, the equation becomes:\n$$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$$\nThe solutions to this equation are $x=0$ and $x=1$. These are the two equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine whether an equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable, we can analyze the sign of the derivative $f'(x)$ at $x^*$, or analyze the sign of $f(x)$ in the vicinity of $x^*$.\n\n**Method 1: Linearization (Using the derivative of f(x))**\nFirst, find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$$\n$$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$$\nNow, evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   For the equilibrium point $x_1 = 0$:\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n*   For the equilibrium point $x_2 = 1$:\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the linearization method is inconclusive for this point. We must use another method.\n\n**Method 2: Phase Line Analysis**\nSince the linearization test was inconclusive for $x=1$, we analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ on the intervals separated by the equilibrium points 0 and 1.\n*   **Interval 1: $x > 1$**\n    Let's pick a test value, for instance, $x=2$.\n    $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1)^2 = -2$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, which means the solutions $x(t)$ are decreasing in this region. The flow is towards $x=1$.\n*   **Interval 2: $0 < x < 1$**\n    Let's pick a test value, for instance, $x=0.5$.\n    $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125$.\n    Since $f(x) < 0$, $x'(t)$ is negative, so solutions are decreasing. The flow is away from $x=1$ and towards $x=0$.\n*   **Interval 3: $x < 0$**\n    Let's pick a test value, for instance, $x=-1$.\n    $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(-2)^2 = 4$.\n    Since $f(x) > 0$, $x'(t)$ is positive, so solutions are increasing. The flow is towards $x=0$.\n\n**Summary of Stability:**\n*   **For x = 0:** The flow is towards 0 from both the left ($x<0$) and the right ($0<x<1$). Therefore, $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point (specifically, it's an attractor or a stable node). This confirms the result from the linearization method.\n*   **For x = 1:** The flow is towards 1 from the right ($x>1$) but away from 1 on the left ($0<x<1$). An equilibrium point that attracts from one side and repels from the other is called **semi-stable**. In the standard classification of stability (based on Lyapunov stability), a semi-stable point is considered **unstable**. A trajectory starting arbitrarily close to $x=1$ (e.g., at $x=1-\\epsilon$) will move away from it.\n\n**Step 4: Count the number of stable equilibrium points.**\nBased on the analysis, there is only one equilibrium point that is stable, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\nThe question asks to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value $m=1$ into the expression:\n$$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$$\n\nThe final answer is $1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2^4048>>>"
