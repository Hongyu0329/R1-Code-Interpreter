    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key figure and event.**\nThe question asks about the location of the \"first major defeat\" of the Ming Dynasty General Mu Sheng (known in Vietnamese as Mộc Thạnh). This requires pinpointing a specific battle or campaign in his career in Vietnam.\n\n**Step 2: Review Mu Sheng's military campaigns in Vietnam.**\nMu Sheng was involved in two major periods of conflict in Vietnam:\n1.  **The Ming–Hồ War (1406–1407):** Mu Sheng, alongside Zhang Fu, led the Ming invasion that overthrew the Hồ dynasty. This campaign was largely successful for the Ming.\n2.  **The Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427):** After the initial conquest, Vietnamese resistance grew, culminating in the Lam Sơn uprising led by Lê Lợi. Mu Sheng's major defeat occurred during this conflict.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the specific defeat.**\nMu Sheng's \"first major defeat\" is widely identified with his role in the final stages of the Lam Sơn Uprising in 1427. Two large Ming relief armies were sent to rescue their main force, which was besieged by Lê Lợi's army at Đông Quan (modern Hanoi).\n*   One army, led by Liu Sheng (Liễu Thăng), advanced from Guangxi province.\n*   The other army, commanded by Mu Sheng, advanced from Yunnan province.\n\nLê Lợi's strategy was to destroy these relief armies before they could combine forces. Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and decisively annihilated at Chi Lăng Pass (in modern Lạng Sơn province).\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Mu Sheng's role and the location of his defeat.**\nUpon receiving news of Liu Sheng's catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng, whose forces were advancing along the Red River (Sông Thao), panicked. He immediately abandoned the campaign and ordered a hasty retreat back to Yunnan. His \"defeat\" was not a single set-piece battle but a disastrous rout during this retreat. Vietnamese forces under generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả were dispatched to pursue and attack his fleeing army.\n\n**Step 5: Locate the battlefield in modern geography.**\nThe Vietnamese forces caught up with and inflicted heavy casualties on Mu Sheng's army at several key points. The most significant of these engagements, where his rearguard was shattered and thousands of troops and horses were captured, took place at locations named in historical annals as Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá.\n\n**Careful Point:** It is important not to confuse the location of Liu Sheng's defeat (Chi Lăng, Lạng Sơn) with Mu Sheng's defeat. Mu Sheng's army was defeated while retreating along a different route.\n\n**Step 6: Map the historical location to a current province.**\nHistorical research and mapping of these battle sites by Vietnamese historians place Lãnh Câu and Đan Xá along the Thao River (an upstream section of the Red River) within the territory of what is now **Phú Thọ Province**. While the pursuit continued into Yên Bái and Lào Cai provinces, the initial and decisive defeat that broke his army occurred in this area.\n\nTherefore, the current Vietnamese province where Ming General Mu Sheng experienced his first major defeat is Phú Thọ.\n\n<<<Phú Thọ Province>>>"
