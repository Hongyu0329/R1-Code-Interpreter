    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** The question specifies \"not necessarily metric\". In general topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, connected Hausdorff space. If it were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be different.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is said to be indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A proper subcontinuum is a subset that is a continuum itself and is not equal to the whole space $X$.\n*   **Composant:** For a given point $x$ in a continuum $X$, the composant of $x$, denoted $C(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X$ for which there exists a proper subcontinuum of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$. In essence, it's the union of all proper subcontinua that contain the point $x$.\n\n**2. Relating Decomposability to the Number of Composants**\n\nThe first crucial step is to understand the relationship between a continuum being indecomposable and the number of composants it has. This relationship is established by a fundamental theorem in continuum theory.\n\n*   **Composants Partition the Space:** The set of all distinct composants of a continuum $X$ forms a partition of $X$. That is, every point belongs to exactly one composant.\n*   **Decomposable Continua:** Let's consider a decomposable continuum $X$. By definition, $X = A \\cup B$, where $A$ and $B$ are proper subcontinua of $X$. We can show that $X$ has only one composant.\n    *   Let $p$ and $q$ be any two points in $X$. We need to show they are in the same composant.\n    *   Since $X$ is connected, the intersection $A \\cap B$ must be non-empty. Let's pick a point $z \\in A \\cap B$.\n    *   Now, consider the point $p$. It lies in either $A$ or $B$. Let's say $p \\in A$. Then both $p$ and $z$ are contained in the proper subcontinuum $A$. By the definition of a composant, this means $z$ is in the composant of $p$, i.e., $z \\in C(p)$.\n    *   Similarly, the point $q$ is in either $A$ or $B$. Let's say $q \\in B$. Then both $q$ and $z$ are contained in the proper subcontinuum $B$. This means $q \\in C(z)$.\n    *   Since $z \\in C(p)$, their composants are the same: $C(z) = C(p)$. And since $q \\in C(z)$, it follows that $q \\in C(p)$.\n    *   This logic holds for any pair of points $p,q \\in X$. Thus, all points lie in a single composant.\n*   **Conclusion for Decomposable Continua:** Any decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n\n**3. Number of Composants in an Indecomposable Continuum**\n\n*   From the conclusion above, if a continuum is indecomposable, it cannot have only one composant. Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have at least two composants.\n*   This establishes a lower bound: the smallest possible number of composants is at least 2.\n\n**4. The \"Not Necessarily Metric\" Caveat**\n\nThis part of the question is critical.\n*   **For Metric Continua:** A famous theorem by the Polish mathematician Stefan Mazurkiewicz (1930) states that every indecomposable *metric* continuum has exactly $c$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$) composants. If the question were restricted to metric spaces, the answer would be $c$. All standard examples like solenoids or the Knaster bucket-handle continuum are metric and have $c$ composants.\n*   **For General (Non-Metric) Continua:** The situation is different. Mazurkiewicz's proof relies heavily on the properties of metric spaces (specifically, embedding in Euclidean space or the Hilbert cube). The question of whether an indecomposable continuum could have a finite number of composants (other than one) was a long-standing open problem in topology.\n\n**5. Existence of an Example with 2 Composants**\n\n*   The problem was solved in 1999 by the topologist Piotr Minc. He constructed the first example of an indecomposable (non-metric) continuum that has a finite number of composants.\n*   Specifically, Minc's continuum has exactly **two** composants.\n*   The existence of this example proves that the lower bound of 2 is achievable.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\n1.  A decomposable continuum has exactly one composant.\n2.  Therefore, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant, meaning the number of composants is at least 2.\n3.  For metric spaces, the number is always $c=2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n4.  However, for general (non-metric) continua, an example with exactly 2 composants has been constructed.\n5.  Combining these points, the smallest possible number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
