    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Factorize the conductor N\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\nSo, the prime power factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the structure of Dirichlet characters\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $N$, denoted $(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, is isomorphic to the product of the character groups for each prime power factor in the factorization of $N$. Any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be uniquely written as a product:\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$,\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\n### Step 3: Conditions for primitivity and order\n*   **Primitivity:** A character $\\chi \\pmod N$ is **primitive** if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive modulo the corresponding prime power $p^a$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of its components.\n*   **Order:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe require the order of $\\chi$ to be $6$. This implies two conditions on the orders of the component characters, $d_i = \\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$:\n1.  Each order $d_i$ must divide 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{d_i\\}$ must contain an order divisible by 2 and an order divisible by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze primitive characters for each prime power factor\nWe need to count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^a$ whose order divides 6.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$, which has order $\\phi(4)=2$.\n    A character modulo 4 is primitive if its conductor is 4. The only imprimitive character is the principal character (induced from the trivial character mod 1, conductor 1). Wait, more precisely, a character mod 4 is primitive if it's not a character mod 2. The only character mod 2 is trivial. Lifting to mod 4 gives the principal character, so the non-principal character mod 4 is primitive.\n    This single primitive character has order 2. Since 2 divides 6, this character is a valid choice for $\\chi_4$.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: 1.\n    *   The order of any such $\\chi_4$ is exactly 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$, which has order $\\phi(9)=6$.\n    A character modulo 9 is primitive if it is not induced by a character modulo 3. The group of characters mod 3 has order $\\phi(3)=2$, so its elements have orders 1 and 2. Thus, any character mod 9 of order 3 or 6 cannot be induced from a character mod 3, and must be primitive.\n    The group $C_6$ has:\n    *   $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    *   $\\phi(6)=2$ characters of order 6.\n    Both 3 and 6 divide 6. So these are all valid choices.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$.\n    *   The order of any such $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6, hence always divisible by 3.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:**\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$, of order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    For a prime modulus $p$, any non-principal character is primitive. We need to count the characters whose order divides 6. Since the group order is 6, all characters have an order dividing 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:**\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$, of order $\\phi(11)=10$.\n    All non-principal characters are primitive. The order of any character must divide 10. We also require the order to divide 6. Thus, the order must divide $\\text{gcd}(10, 6) = 2$. As the character must be primitive, its order cannot be 1. So the order must be 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: 1.\n    *   The order of any such $\\chi_{11}$ is exactly 2.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:**\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$, of order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    All non-principal characters are primitive. The order must divide 12 and 6, so it must divide $\\text{gcd}(12, 6) = 6$. Possible orders are 2, 3, 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    *   Total number of choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n### Step 5: Synthesize and calculate the final count\nLet's assemble a primitive character $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ by choosing one component from each set of allowed characters we just counted. Let's check the lcm condition.\n\n*   For any choice, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_4) = 2$ and $\\text{ord}(\\chi_{11})=2$. This guarantees that the lcm of the orders will be divisible by 2.\n*   For any choice, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_9)$ is 3 or 6. This guarantees that the lcm of the orders will be divisible by 3.\n*   Since the lcm is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6.\n*   Since the order of each component character divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6.\n\nTherefore, any combination of our chosen component characters will result in a character of order exactly 6. The total number of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nNumber of choices = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nThere are 100 primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$."
