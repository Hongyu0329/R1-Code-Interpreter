A command-line implementable filtering strategy should be applied *after* running a paired differential gene expression (DGE) analysis (e.g., using DESeq2 with the design `~donor + condition`). The strategy involves two sequential filtering steps on the DGE results table to create a "contaminant gene" blacklist:
1.  **LFC Filter:** Identify genes with a very high positive log2 fold change in the `CAR_only` vs. `CAR_IL15` comparison, indicative of an artifact rather than biological regulation. A stringent threshold should be used, for example: `log2FoldChange > 6`.
2.  **Basal Expression Filter:** From that list, further select only the genes that are virtually absent in the clean `CAR_IL15` samples. This is achieved by filtering for genes where the mean of normalized counts across all `CAR_IL15` replicates is below a minimal expression threshold, for example: `mean_normalized_counts_in_CAR_IL15 < 5`.
The resulting list of genes forms the contaminant blacklist, which should then be removed from the full DGE results table before performing any downstream biological interpretation or pathway analysis.
