    "This problem asks for the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nLet's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map**\n*   The source space is $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n*   The target space is $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$, the target is $Y \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   The map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}$ is a standard map in homotopy theory, often related to Samelson products or evaluation maps. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" hints at its origin, but we can identify it via a common construction.\n\n**Step 2: A concrete model for the map f**\nA standard construction for a map of this type involves smashing together evaluation maps.\nLet $ev_n: \\Sigma \\Omega S^n \\to S^n$ be the evaluation map, which is the adjoint to the identity map on $\\Omega S^n$.\n1.  Take the evaluation maps for $n=4$ and $n=6$:\n    $ev_4: \\Sigma \\Omega S^4 \\to S^4$\n    $ev_6: \\Sigma \\Omega S^6 \\to S^6$\n2.  Smash these two maps together:\n    $ev_4 \\wedge ev_6: \\Sigma\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Sigma\\Omega S^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n3.  There is a natural map $q: \\Sigma A \\wedge \\Sigma B \\to \\Sigma^2 (A \\wedge B)$. For $A = \\Omega S^4$ and $B=\\Omega S^6$, this map is known to be highly connected.\n    Let $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$. We have a map $h = (ev_4 \\wedge ev_6) \\circ q^{-1}$ (in the sense of homotopy theory), which is a map $h: \\Sigma^2 Z \\to S^{10}$.\n4.  The map $f$ in the question can be identified with the composite $\\Omega h \\circ S$, where $S: \\Sigma Z \\to \\Omega \\Sigma^2 Z$ is the suspension map into the double loop space.\n    $f: \\Sigma Z \\xrightarrow{S} \\Omega\\Sigma^2 Z \\xrightarrow{\\Omega h} \\Omega S^{10}$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the connectivity of the constituent maps**\n*   **The suspension map S:** The Freudenthal suspension theorem implies that the map $S: X \\to \\Omega \\Sigma X$ is approximately $(2 \\cdot \\text{conn}(X)+1)$-connected. Here, the map is $S: \\Sigma Z \\to \\Omega \\Sigma^2 Z$. The space $Z = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ has connectivity $\\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 1 = (4-2) + (6-2) + 1 = 2+4+1=7$. So $\\Sigma Z$ is 8-connected. The map $S$ is $(2 \\cdot 8 + 1) = 17$-connected. This connectivity is very high, so the connectivity of $f$ will be determined by the connectivity of $\\Omega h$.\n*   **The map Ωh:** The connectivity of a looped map $\\Omega h$ is related to the connectivity of $h$. Specifically, if we denote the homotopy fiber of a map $g$ by $F_g$, then $F_{\\Omega g} \\simeq \\Omega F_g$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the connectivity of h**\nThe connectivity of a map $g: A \\to B$ is the integer $k$ such that the induced maps on homotopy groups $\\pi_i(g)$ are isomorphisms for $i<k$ and a surjection for $i=k$. This is equivalent to the homotopy fiber $F_g$ being $(k-1)$-connected.\n\n1.  **Spaces for h:** $h: \\Sigma^2 Z \\to S^{10}$.\n    *   Source: $\\Sigma^2 Z = \\Sigma^2(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+2)=9$-connected.\n    *   Target: $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n2.  **Homotopy groups in low dimensions:**\n    *   For $i \\le 9$, both spaces have trivial homotopy groups, so $\\pi_i(h)$ is an isomorphism.\n    *   We need to check $\\pi_{10}(h)$.\n        *   $\\pi_{10}(\\Sigma^2 Z) = \\pi_8(Z) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. By the Hurewicz theorem and Künneth formula for homology, this first non-trivial homotopy group is isomorphic to $H_8(Z; \\mathbb{Z}) = H_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes H_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n        *   $\\pi_{10}(S^{10}) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n3.  **The map on π₁₀:** The map $h_*: \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma^2 Z) \\to \\pi_{10}(S^{10})$ can be shown to be an isomorphism of degree $\\pm 1$. This is because a generator of $\\pi_{10}(\\Sigma^2 Z)$ can be constructed from generators of $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4)$ and $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6)$, and the map $h$ is constructed from evaluation maps which are adjoint to identity maps. The composition essentially maps the identity map of $S^{10}$ (appropriately constructed) to the identity map. So, $h_*: \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ is an isomorphism.\n4.  **Connectivity of h:** Since $\\pi_i(h)$ is an isomorphism for $i \\le 10$, the connectivity of $h$ is at least 11. To find the precise connectivity, we look at the homotopy fiber $F_h$. The long exact sequence in homotopy for the fibration $F_h \\to \\Sigma^2 Z \\xrightarrow{h} S^{10}$ contains the segment:\n    $\\dots \\to \\pi_{11}(S^{10}) \\to \\pi_{10}(F_h) \\to \\pi_{10}(\\Sigma^2 Z) \\xrightarrow{h_*} \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\to \\dots$\n    Since $h_*$ on $\\pi_{10}$ is an isomorphism, the exactness implies that $\\pi_{10}(F_h)=0$. Similarly, $\\pi_9(F_h)=0$. Since we already knew $F_h$ was 8-connected, we now have that $F_h$ is 10-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(F_h)=0$ for $i \\le 10$).\n5.  A map whose fiber is $k$-connected is $(k+1)$-connected. Therefore, since $F_h$ is 10-connected, the map $h$ is 11-connected. This means $\\pi_i(h)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 11$ and a surjection for $i=11$.\n\n**Step 5: Final calculation for the connectivity of f**\n*   The connectivity of $f$ is the same as the connectivity of $\\Omega h$.\n*   The connectivity of $\\Omega h$ is determined by the connectivity of its fiber, $F_{\\Omega h} \\simeq \\Omega F_h$.\n*   We found that $F_h$ is 10-connected, meaning $\\pi_i(F_h)=0$ for $i \\le 10$.\n*   For the fiber of $\\Omega h$, we have $\\pi_i(\\Omega F_h) = \\pi_{i+1}(F_h)$.\n*   So, $\\pi_i(\\Omega F_h) = 0$ for $i+1 \\le 10$, which means for $i \\le 9$.\n*   The fiber of $\\Omega h$, $F_{\\Omega h}$, is 9-connected.\n*   A map whose fiber is $(k-1)$-connected is $k$-connected. Since the fiber of $\\Omega h$ is 9-connected, the map $\\Omega h$ is 10-connected.\n*   Since $S$ is 17-connected, it does not affect the connectivity calculation in this range.\n*   Thus, the connectivity of the map $f$ is 10.\n\nFinal check of the definition: A map $f$ is 10-connected if $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism for $i < 10$ and a surjection for $i=10$.\nOur conclusion that $F_f \\simeq \\Omega F_h$ is 9-connected implies $\\pi_i(f)$ is an isomorphism for $i<10$ and a surjection for $i=10$, confirming that the connectivity is 10."
