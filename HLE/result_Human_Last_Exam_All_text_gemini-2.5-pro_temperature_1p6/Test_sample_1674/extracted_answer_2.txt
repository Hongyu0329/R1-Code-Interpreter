Yes, the theory can fail if the birefringent medium is non-reciprocal. Standard birefringence from an anisotropic crystal is reciprocal and would not invalidate the theory. However, birefringence can also be induced by a magnetic field (the magneto-optic Faraday effect). Such a medium is non-reciprocal, meaning it breaks the time-reversal symmetry upon which the "inversion" theory relies. Therefore, including a non-reciprocal component like a Faraday rotator would cause the theory to fail.
