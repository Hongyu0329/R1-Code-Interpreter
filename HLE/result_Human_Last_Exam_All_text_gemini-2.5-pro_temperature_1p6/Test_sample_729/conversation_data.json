    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of the generalized quaternion group and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Generalized Quaternion Group $Q_{128}$**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $4n$, denoted $Q_{4n}$, has the presentation:\n$Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nFor the group of size 128, we have $4n=128$, which implies $n=32$. So, our group is:\n$G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n\nKey properties of this group $G$:\n*   The order of $G$ is 128.\n*   The elements of $G$ can be uniquely written as $x^i y^j$ where $0 \\le i < 64$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n*   The element $x$ generates a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64. This subgroup has index 2 in $G$.\n*   The element $y$ has order 4, since $y^2 = x^{32}$ and $(y^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n*   The relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$ can be rewritten as $yx = x^{-1}y$. This relation is key for computations.\n\n**Step 2: Understanding Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in $G$. We denote this set as $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\nFor finite $p$-groups, such as $Q_{128}$ (which is a 2-group), the set $G^k$ is always a subgroup of $G$. Our task is to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n\n**Step 3: Calculating $G^k$**\n\nWe need to compute the $k$-th power of every element $g \\in G$. The elements are of two types: those in $\\langle x \\rangle$ and those not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n*   **Type 1: $g = x^i$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.**\n    $g^k = (x^i)^k = x^{ik}$.\n\n*   **Type 2: $g = x^i y$ for $0 \\le i < 64$.**\n    Let's compute the square of this type of element:\n    $(x^i y)^2 = (x^i y)(x^i y) = x^i (y x^i) y = x^i (x^{-i} y) y = (x^i x^{-i}) y^2 = y^2$.\n    Since $y^2 = x^{32}$, we have $(x^i y)^2 = x^{32}$. This is a crucial simplification, as the result is independent of $i$.\n\n    Now we can find $(x^i y)^k$:\n    *   If $k$ is even, let $k = 2m$.\n        $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y)^{2m} = ((x^i y)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, let $k = 2m+1$.\n        $(x^i y)^k = (x^i y)^{2m+1} = ((x^i y)^2)^m (x^i y) = (x^{32})^m (x^i y) = x^{32m} x^i y = x^{i+32m} y$.\n\nNow we can determine the set $G^k$ by considering two cases for $k$.\n\n**Case A: $k$ is odd**\nLet $k=2m+1$.\n$G^k = \\{ (x^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\cup \\{ (x^i y)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$.\nThe first set is $\\{x^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64) = 1$. As $i$ runs through $\\{0, ..., 63\\}$, so does $ik \\pmod{64}$. Thus, this set is simply $\\langle x \\rangle$.\nThe second set is $\\{x^{i+32m} y \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$. As $i$ runs through $\\{0, ..., 63\\}$, the exponent $i+32m \\pmod{64}$ also runs through all residues modulo 64. Thus, this set is $\\{x^j y \\mid 0 \\le j < 64\\}$, which is the coset $\\langle x \\rangle y$.\nSo, for any odd $k$, $G^k = \\langle x \\rangle \\cup \\langle x \\rangle y = G$.\nThis gives us one power subgroup: the group $G$ itself.\n\n**Case B: $k$ is even**\nLet $k=2m$.\n$G^k = \\{ (x^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} \\cup \\{ (x^i y)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$.\nThe first set $\\{x^{ik}\\}$ forms the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(64, k)} \\rangle$.\nThe second set $\\{(x^iy)^k\\}$ consists of the single element $x^{32m}$ (since the power is independent of $i$).\nSo, $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(64, k)} \\rangle \\cup \\{x^{32m}\\}$.\nWe must check if the element $x^{32m}$ is already in the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(64, k)} \\rangle$. This is true if $\\gcd(64, k)$ divides $32m$.\nLet $d = \\gcd(64, k) = \\gcd(64, 2m)$.\n$d$ must divide $k=2m$. So $k=da$ for some integer $a$.\nThen $32m = 16(2m) = 16k = 16da$. This is a multiple of $d$. So $d$ divides $32m$.\nTherefore, the element $x^{32m}$ is always contained in the subgroup $\\langle x^{\\gcd(64, k)} \\rangle$.\nSo, for even $k$, $G^k = \\langle x^{\\gcd(64, k)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Distinct Subgroups**\n\nWe have found that the power subgroups are of two types:\n1.  The entire group $G$ (from odd $k$).\n2.  Subgroups of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d = \\gcd(64, k)$ for some even integer $k$.\n\nWe need to find how many distinct subgroups arise from the second type. This is equivalent to finding all possible values of $d = \\gcd(64, k)$ where $k$ is an even integer. Let $k=2m$.\n$d = \\gcd(64, 2m) = \\gcd(2^6, 2m)$.\nLet $m = 2^a \\cdot b$, where $b$ is an odd integer and $a \\ge 0$.\nThen $d = \\gcd(2^6, 2 \\cdot 2^a \\cdot b) = \\gcd(2^6, 2^{a+1}) = 2^{\\min(6, a+1)}$.\nSince $a$ can be any non-negative integer ($0, 1, 2, ...$), the value of $a+1$ can be any positive integer ($1, 2, 3, ...$).\nThe possible values for $\\min(6, a+1)$ are:\n*   If $a=0$, $\\min(6, 1) = 1 \\implies d=2^1=2$.\n*   If $a=1$, $\\min(6, 2) = 2 \\implies d=2^2=4$.\n*   If $a=2$, $\\min(6, 3) = 3 \\implies d=2^3=8$.\n*   If $a=3$, $\\min(6, 4) = 4 \\implies d=2^4=16$.\n*   If $a=4$, $\\min(6, 5) = 5 \\implies d=2^5=32$.\n*   If $a \\ge 5$, $\\min(6, a+1) = 6 \\implies d=2^6=64$.\n\nSo, the possible values for $d$ are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$. Each of these values generates a distinct subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$:\n*   $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$\n*   $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (This is the center of G, $Z(G)$)\n*   $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (The trivial subgroup)\n\nThese are 6 distinct subgroups.\n\n**Final Count:**\nCombining both cases, the set of all power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is:\n$\\{G, \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\}\\}$.\n\nThere is 1 subgroup from odd powers of $k$, and 6 distinct subgroups from even powers of $k$.\nTotal number of power subgroups = $1 + 6 = 7$."
