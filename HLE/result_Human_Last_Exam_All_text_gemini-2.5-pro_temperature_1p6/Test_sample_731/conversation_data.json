    "Answering this question requires understanding the structure of semidihedral groups and the definition of power subgroups.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Semidihedral Group**\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has the presentation:\n$SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s | r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n\nIn this problem, the size of the group is 512.\n$2^n = 512 \\implies n = 9$.\nSo we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{512} = SD_{2^9}$. Its presentation is:\n$G = \\langle r, s | r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\nThe group $G$ consists of $512$ elements which can be written in the form $r^i$ or $sr^j$ for $i, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 255\\}$. The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 256.\n\n**Step 2: Define a Power Subgroup**\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it is the subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$ for some integer $k$. This is often denoted as $H = \\langle G^k \\rangle = \\langle \\{g^k | g \\in G\\} \\rangle$. We need to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the k-th Powers of Elements in G**\nThe elements of $G$ are of two types:\n1.  Powers of $r$: $(r^i)^k = r^{ik}$.\n2.  Elements of the form $sr^j$: We first determine the structure of powers of these elements.\n    From the relation $srs = r^{127}$, we can derive $s r^j s^{-1} = (srs^{-1})^j = r^{127j}$.\n    So, $(sr^j)^2 = sr^j s r^j = s r^j s \\cdot r^j = (r^{127j}) r^j = r^{128j}$.\n    Now we can find a general formula for $(sr^j)^k$:\n    *   If $k$ is even, say $k=2m$:\n        $(sr^j)^k = ((sr^j)^2)^m = (r^{128j})^m = r^{128jm}$.\n    *   If $k$ is odd, say $k=2m+1$:\n        $(sr^j)^k = (sr^j)^{2m} (sr^j) = (r^{128j})^m (sr^j) = r^{128jm} sr^j$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Power Subgroups $\\langle G^k \\rangle$**\nWe analyze the subgroup $\\langle G^k \\rangle$ by considering the parity of $k$.\n\n*   **Case 1: k is odd**\n    Let $k=2m+1$. The generators for $\\langle G^k \\rangle$ are all elements of the form $r^{ik}$ and $r^{128jm}sr^j$.\n    *   Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 256) = 1$. This means the subgroup generated by $r^k$ is the same as the subgroup generated by $r$: $\\langle r^k \\rangle = \\langle r \\rangle$. Thus, $r$ itself is in $\\langle G^k \\rangle$, and so is the entire cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    *   The other generators are of the form $r^{128jm}sr^j$. Since $\\langle r \\rangle \\subseteq \\langle G^k \\rangle$, we know that $r^{128jm}$ is in $\\langle G^k \\rangle$. This implies that $(r^{128jm})^{-1}(r^{128jm}sr^j) = sr^j$ must also be in $\\langle G^k \\rangle$ for all $j$.\n    *   Taking $j=0$, we find that $s$ is in $\\langle G^k \\rangle$.\n    *   Since both $r$ and $s$ are in $\\langle G^k \\rangle$, the subgroup generated must be the entire group $G$.\n    So, for any odd integer $k$, $\\langle G^k \\rangle = G$. This gives us one power subgroup: $G$ itself.\n\n*   **Case 2: k is even**\n    Let $k=2m$. The generators for $\\langle G^k \\rangle$ are all elements of the form $r^{ik}$ and $r^{128jm}$.\n    $\\langle G^k \\rangle = \\langle \\{r^{ik}\\}_{i=0..255}, \\{r^{128jm}\\}_{j=0..255} \\rangle$.\n    This simplifies to $\\langle r^k, r^{128m} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k=2m$, we have $128m = 64(2m) = 64k$.\n    The subgroup is $\\langle r^k, r^{64k} \\rangle$. As $r^{64k} = (r^k)^{64}$, this is a subset of $\\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, for any even $k$, $\\langle G^k \\rangle = \\langle r^k \\rangle$.\n    The order of $r$ is 256, so the subgroup $\\langle r^k \\rangle$ is identical to $\\langle r^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k$ is even, $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$ must be an even divisor of $256 = 2^8$.\n    The divisors of 256 are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$.\n    The even divisors are $2^1, 2^2, \\dots, 2^8$. These are the numbers $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n    For each of these 8 possible values for $d$, we get a distinct subgroup:\n    1.  $d=2$: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=2$)\n    2.  $d=4$: $\\langle r^4 \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=4$)\n    3.  $d=8$: $\\langle r^8 \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=8$)\n    4.  $d=16$: $\\langle r^{16} \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=16$)\n    5.  $d=32$: $\\langle r^{32} \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=32$)\n    6.  $d=64$: $\\langle r^{64} \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=64$)\n    7.  $d=128$: $\\langle r^{128} \\rangle$ (e.g., for $k=128$)\n    8.  $d=256$: $\\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, e.g., for $k=256$)\n    These are 8 distinct subgroups, as their orders ($128, 64, \\dots, 1$) are all different.\n\n**Step 5: Count the total number of distinct power subgroups**\nCombining the results from both cases:\n*   From odd values of $k$, we get one subgroup: $G$.\n*   From even values of $k$, we get eight subgroups: $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\}$.\n\nThe full list of power subgroups is $\\{ G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\langle r^8 \\rangle, \\langle r^{16} \\rangle, \\langle r^{32} \\rangle, \\langle r^{64} \\rangle, \\langle r^{128} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\nAll these subgroups are distinct since they all have different orders.\nThe total number of distinct power subgroups is $1 + 8 = 9$."
