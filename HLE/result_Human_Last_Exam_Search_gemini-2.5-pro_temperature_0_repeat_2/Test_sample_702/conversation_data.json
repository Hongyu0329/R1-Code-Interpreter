    "<<<The connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is 9.\n\nThis result is a specific application of a more general theorem in homotopy theory concerning a canonical map `j: Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y)`. The connectivity of this map is given by the formula `1 + conn(X) + conn(Y)`, where `conn(X)` is the connectivity of the space X.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for the given spaces:\n1.  **Identify the spaces and their connectivity:**\n    *   The space `X` is the 4-sphere, `S^4`. A space is `k`-connected if all its homotopy groups `π_i` are trivial for `i ≤ k`. The first non-trivial homotopy group of `S^4` is `π_4(S^4) = ℤ`. Therefore, `S^4` is 3-connected, so `conn(S^4) = 3`.\n    *   The space `Y` is the 6-sphere, `S^6`. Its first non-trivial homotopy group is `π_6(S^6) = ℤ`. Thus, `S^6` is 5-connected, and `conn(S^6) = 5`.\n\n2.  **Apply the connectivity formula:**\n    *   Using the formula, the connectivity of the map is `1 + conn(S^4) + conn(S^6) = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9`.\n\nA map `f: A → B` is `k`-connected if it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups `π_i` for `i < k` and a surjection on `π_k`. Let's verify this by examining the homotopy groups of the domain and codomain of the map in question.\n\n*   **Domain:** `A = Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)`\n    *   The loop space `ΩS^4` is 2-connected, and `ΩS^6` is 4-connected.\n    *   The smash product `ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6` is `(2 + 4 + 1) = 7`-connected.\n    *   The suspension `Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6)` is `(7 + 1) = 8`-connected.\n    *   The first non-trivial homotopy group is `π_9(A)`, which is isomorphic to `ℤ`.\n\n*   **Codomain:** `B = Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)`\n    *   The smash product `S^4 ∧ S^6` is homotopy equivalent to `S^{10}`.\n    *   The loop space `ΩS^{10}` is `(10 - 2) = 8`-connected.\n    *   The first non-trivial homotopy group is `π_9(B) = π_{10}(S^{10}) = ℤ`.\n\nSince both the domain and codomain are 8-connected, the map is trivially an isomorphism on `π_i` for `i < 9`. The map is known to induce an isomorphism on `π_9`. However, on the next level, the homotopy groups are `π_{10}(A) = ℤ` and `π_{10}(B) = π_{11}(S^{10}) = ℤ₂`. A map from `ℤ` to `ℤ₂` cannot be an isomorphism, which confirms that the connectivity is not higher than 9.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map is precisely 9.>>>"
