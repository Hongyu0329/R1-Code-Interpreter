    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, of a vector field `n(x,y,z)` that maps the 3D space `R^3` to the 2-sphere `S^2` (the space of unit vectors) can be determined using the Whitehead integral formula. However, a more intuitive and direct method for this specific field is to understand its topological structure or to compute the linking number of the preimages of two distinct points on the sphere.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the Vector Field Structure\n\nThe given vector field is defined in terms of two angles, `f` and `G`, which determine the direction of the unit vector `n`:\n*   `n = (sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f), cos(G))`\n\nThis is a standard spherical coordinate representation for the vector `n`, where `G` is the polar angle (angle with the z-axis) and `f` is the azimuthal angle (angle in the xy-plane).\n\nThe angles are defined as:\n*   `f = atan2(y,x)`: This is simply the cylindrical/spherical azimuthal angle, which we can denote as `φ`.\n*   `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, where `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)^2 + z*z)`.\n\nLet's analyze the structure this creates:\n1.  **Toroidal Winding:** The azimuthal angle of the vector field, `f`, is equal to the spatial azimuthal angle `φ`. If we trace a large circle in the xy-plane around the z-axis, `φ` changes by `2π`. Consequently, `f` also changes by `2π`, meaning the vector `n` winds around the z-axis exactly once. This corresponds to a toroidal winding number of 1.\n\n2.  **Poloidal Winding:** The polar angle `G` depends on `r2`, which is the distance from a specific circle in space. The value of `r2` is zero when `z=0` and `x*x + y*y = 0.5`. This defines a circle in the xy-plane with radius `R = sqrt(0.5)`, which acts as the core of the topological structure.\n    *   On this core circle, `r2 = 0`, which gives `G = π * exp(0) = π`. The vector field points directly down: `n = (0, 0, cos(π)) = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    *   At any point infinitely far from the origin, `r2 → ∞`, which gives `G → π * 0 = 0`. The vector field points directly up: `n = (0, 0, cos(0)) = (0, 0, 1)`.\n\nAs one moves from the core circle outwards in any direction, the polar angle `G` sweeps from `π` to `0`. This sweep corresponds to a poloidal winding number of 1.\n\nThe Hopf charge `H` for such a toroidal structure, known as a hopfion, is the product of the toroidal and poloidal winding numbers.\n\n`H = (toroidal winding) × (poloidal winding) = 1 × 1 = 1`.\n\n### 2. Linking Number of Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge is formally defined as the linking number of the preimages of any two regular values (points) on the target sphere `S^2`. Let's choose two convenient points:\n*   **Point P1 (South Pole):** `n = (0, 0, -1)`.\n    The preimage of P1 is the set of points `(x,y,z)` where the field points south. This occurs when `G = π`. As shown before, this happens precisely when `r2 = 0`, which corresponds to the circle `x^2 + y^2 = 0.5, z = 0`. Let's call this loop `C1`.\n\n*   **Point P2 (a point on the Equator):** Let's choose `n = (1, 0, 0)`.\n    The preimage of P2 requires `nz = cos(G) = 0`, which means `G = π/2`. This implies `π/2 = π * exp(-10*r2)`, so `exp(-10*r2) = 0.5`, which gives `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    It also requires `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1` and `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0`. Since `G=π/2`, `sin(G)=1`, this simplifies to `cos(f)=1` and `sin(f)=0`, which means `f=0`.\n    `f = atan2(y,x) = 0` implies `y=0` and `x>0`.\n    The condition on `r2` becomes `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\n    So, the preimage of P2 is a closed loop `C2` in the `x > 0` half of the xz-plane, defined by the equation `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`.\n\nThe Hopf charge is the linking number of loop `C1` and loop `C2`.\n*   `C1` is a circle of radius `sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707` in the xy-plane.\n*   `C2` is a loop in the xz-plane. To find if it links with `C1`, we can see where `C2` pierces the disk bounded by `C1`. The loop `C2` pierces the `z=0` plane when `(x^2 - 0.5)^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2`, which gives `x^2 = 0.5 ± ln(2)/10`.\n    *   `x_inner^2 = 0.5 - 0.0693 = 0.4307`. This is less than the squared radius of `C1` (0.5), so this piercing point is *inside* `C1`.\n    *   `x_outer^2 = 0.5 + 0.0693 = 0.5693`. This is greater than the squared radius of `C1`, so this piercing point is *outside* `C1`.\n\nSince the loop `C2` pierces the disk bounded by `C1` exactly once, their linking number is `±1`. The standard orientation conventions for this field configuration yield a positive sign.\n\nBoth methods consistently show that the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
