    "To determine the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$, we need to find the maximum number of real solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the functions f and g:**\n    *   $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are polynomials of degree 3.\n    *   Let $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   Let $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$ with $b_3 \\neq 0$.\n    *   The derivatives are $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$ and $g'(x) = 3b_3x^2 + 2b_2x + b_1$.\n    *   The condition that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ means that these quadratic polynomials are always positive. For a quadratic $Ax^2+Bx+C$ to be always positive, we must have $A>0$ and the discriminant $B^2-4AC < 0$.\n    *   For $f'(x)$: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$, and $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_3a_1 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_3a_1$.\n    *   For $g'(x)$: $3b_3 > 0 \\implies b_3 > 0$, and $(2b_2)^2 - 4(3b_3)(b_1) < 0 \\implies 4b_2^2 - 12b_3b_1 < 0 \\implies b_2^2 < 3b_3b_1$.\n    *   The conditions $f'(x)>0$ and $g'(x)>0$ imply that both $f$ and $g$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\n2.  **Analyze the composite function and its fixed points:**\n    *   The composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial. Its degree is the product of the degrees of $f$ and $g$, which is $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n    *   We are looking for the number of fixed points of $h(x)$, which are the solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$.\n    *   This is equivalent to finding the number of real roots of the polynomial $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$.\n    *   Since the degree of $f(g(x))$ is 9, the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$ is also 9.\n    *   By the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree 9 can have at most 9 real roots. The question is whether it is possible to achieve this maximum under the given constraints.\n\n3.  **Apply Rolle's Theorem:**\n    *   For a polynomial $P(x)$ to have $k$ distinct real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n    *   Let's analyze the derivative of $P(x)$:\n        $P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\n    *   For $P(x)$ to have 9 real roots, its derivative $P'(x)$ must have at least 8 real roots.\n    *   Let's analyze the derivative of $P'(x)$, which is $P''(x)$:\n        $P''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1) = f''(g(x)) \\cdot (g'(x))^2 + f'(g(x)) \\cdot g''(x)$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the degree of the derivatives:**\n    *   $g(x)$ is degree 3.\n    *   $g'(x)$ is degree 2.\n    *   $g''(x)$ is degree 1.\n    *   $f'(y)$ is degree 2.\n    *   $f''(y)$ is degree 1.\n    *   The degree of $f'(g(x))$ is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n    *   The degree of $f''(g(x))$ is $1 \\times 3 = 3$.\n    *   The degree of the first term in $P''(x)$, $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$, is $3 + 2 \\times 2 = 7$.\n    *   The degree of the second term in $P''(x)$, $f'(g(x))g''(x)$, is $6 + 1 = 7$.\n    *   The leading coefficient of $P''(x)$ is the sum of the leading coefficients of the two terms. Let $f(x)=a_3x^3+...$ and $g(x)=b_3x^3+...$.\n        *   Leading term of $f''(g(x))(g'(x))^2$: $(6a_3(b_3x^3)) \\cdot (3b_3x^2)^2 = (6a_3b_3x^3)(9b_3^2x^4) = 54a_3b_3^3x^7$.\n        *   Leading term of $f'(g(x))g''(x)$: $(3a_3(b_3x^3)^2) \\cdot (6b_3x) = (3a_3b_3^2x^6)(6b_3x) = 18a_3b_3^3x^7$.\n    *   The leading coefficient of $P''(x)$ is $(54+18)a_3b_3^3 = 72a_3b_3^3$. Since $a_3>0$ and $b_3>0$, this is non-zero.\n    *   So, $P''(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 7. It can have at most 7 distinct real roots.\n\n5.  **Putting it all together:**\n    *   If $P''(x)$ can be constructed to have 7 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, $P'(x)$ can have up to 8 distinct real roots.\n    *   If $P'(x)$ can be constructed to have 8 distinct real roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, $P(x)$ can have up to 9 distinct real roots.\n    *   The conditions on the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ ($a_2^2 < 3a_3a_1$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_3b_1$) define open sets in the space of polynomial coefficients. This provides significant freedom to choose the polynomials. There is no apparent mathematical reason that prevents $P''(x)$ from having 7 real roots for some choice of $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the conditions.\n    *   For $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ to have 8 roots, the function $H(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ must be equal to 1 at 8 different points. $H(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8 which tends to $+\\infty$ as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$. For it to intersect a horizontal line 8 times, it must have 3 local maxima (all above the line) and 4 local minima (all below the line). This requires its derivative, $H'(x) = P''(x)$, to have 7 real roots, which is consistent with its degree.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ satisfying the given conditions such that $f(g(x))=x$ has 9 distinct real solutions. The maximum number of fixed points is the degree of the polynomial $f(g(x))-x$, which is 9.\n\nA special case to consider is $f(x)=g(x)$. In this case, any fixed point of $f(f(x))$ must also be a fixed point of $f(x)$. This is because if $f(f(x_0))=x_0$ and $y_0=f(x_0)$, then $f(y_0)=x_0$. Since $f$ is strictly increasing, $x_0 > y_0 \\implies f(x_0) > f(y_0) \\implies y_0 > x_0$, a contradiction. Similarly for $x_0 < y_0$. Thus $x_0=y_0$, which means $f(x_0)=x_0$. A cubic polynomial $f(x)$ can have at most 3 fixed points (roots of the cubic $f(x)-x=0$). So in the case $f=g$, the maximum is 3. However, the question is for general $f$ and $g$, so this special case is not the general maximum.\n\nThe general argument based on the degree of the resulting polynomial holds.\n\n<<<9>>>"
