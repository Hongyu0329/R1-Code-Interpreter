    "Let the given product be denoted by $P(x)$. We have\n$$P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k.$$\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, can be found by evaluating the integral\n$$ \\sum_k a_k^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} |P(e^{i\\theta})|^2 d\\theta. $$\nLet's analyze the term $Q_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$. This is a finite geometric series with first term 1, ratio $x^{3^i}$, and 4 terms. The sum is\n$$ Q_i(x) = \\frac{(x^{3^i})^4 - 1}{x^{3^i} - 1} = \\frac{x^{4 \\cdot 3^i} - 1}{x^{3^i} - 1}. $$\nThus, the polynomial is\n$$ P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\frac{x^{4 \\cdot 3^i} - 1}{x^{3^i} - 1}. $$\nLet's consider the product of the numerators and denominators separately:\n$$ P(x) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (x^{4 \\cdot 3^i} - 1)}{\\prod_{i=0}^{19} (x^{3^i} - 1)}. $$\nWe can observe a telescoping product pattern if we multiply the denominator by $(x-1)$:\n$$ (x-1) \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (x^{3^i} + 1) = (x-1)(x+1)(x^3+1)(x^9+1)\\dots $$\nThis does not seem to simplify well.\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let's examine the structure of the exponents. When expanding the product, each term $x^k$ is formed by choosing one term from each factor $Q_i(x)$. The exponent $k$ will be of the form:\n$$ k = \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i, \\quad \\text{where } c_i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}. $$\nThis is a base-3 representation of $k$, but with digits $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This is not a standard base-3 representation (which uses digits $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$).\n\nLet's consider the identity:\n$$ (1+y+y^2+y^3) = (1+y)(1+y^2). $$\nSubstituting $y = x^{3^i}$, we get:\n$$ 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i} = (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}). $$\nSo, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be rewritten as:\n$$ P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left[ (1+x^{3^i})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right]. $$\nLet's expand this product:\n$$ P(x) = (1+x)(1+x^2) \\cdot (1+x^3)(1+x^6) \\cdot (1+x^9)(1+x^{18}) \\cdots (1+x^{3^{19}})(1+x^{2\\cdot 3^{19}}). $$\nThis can be regrouped as:\n$$ P(x) = \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i}) \\right] \\left[ \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}) \\right]. $$\nLet $A(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{3^i})$ and $B(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+x^{2\\cdot 3^i})$. Then $P(x) = A(x)B(x)$.\n\nWhen $A(x)$ is expanded, the exponents of $x$ are of the form $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$ where $c_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. This is the standard base-3 representation of an integer, and it is unique. Therefore, all coefficients of $A(x)$ are either 0 or 1.\nSimilarly, when $B(x)$ is expanded, the exponents are of the form $\\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i (2 \\cdot 3^i) = 2 \\sum_{i=0}^{19} c_i 3^i$, where $c_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. These are all even numbers whose base-3 representation contains only digits 0 and 2. All coefficients of $B(x)$ are also either 0 or 1.\n\nLet $A(x) = \\sum_j \\alpha_j x^j$ and $B(x) = \\sum_l \\beta_l x^l$, where $\\alpha_j, \\beta_l \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThen $P(x) = (\\sum_j \\alpha_j x^j)(\\sum_l \\beta_l x^l) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\nThe coefficient $a_k$ is given by the convolution $a_k = \\sum_{j+l=k} \\alpha_j \\beta_l$.\n\nThe exponents in the expansion of $A(x)$ are numbers whose base-3 representation contains only digits 0 and 1. The exponents in the expansion of $B(x)$ are numbers whose base-3 representation contains only digits 0 and 2.\nLet an integer $k$ have a standard base-3 representation $k = (d_m d_{m-1} \\dots d_1 d_0)_3$.\nIf we have $k = j+l$, where $j$ is an exponent from $A(x)$ and $l$ is an exponent from $B(x)$, then the base-3 representation of $j$ has digits $\\{0,1\\}$ and the base-3 representation of $l$ has digits $\\{0,2\\}$. When we add $j$ and $l$ in base 3, there are no carries. For example, if the $i$-th digit of $j$ is $j_i$ and the $i$-th digit of $l$ is $l_i$, then $j_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $l_i \\in \\{0,2\\}$. The sum of the digits $j_i+l_i$ can be $0+0=0$, $1+0=1$, $0+2=2$, or $1+2=3$. A carry would be generated if $j_i+l_i \\ge 3$. This happens only if $j_i=1$ and $l_i=2$. In this case, $j_i+l_i=3 = 1 \\cdot 3^1 + 0 \\cdot 3^0$.\n\nHowever, let's consider the sum of coefficients.\nThe sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is its value at $x=1$.\nFor $A(x)$, the sum of coefficients is $A(1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+1) = 2^{20}$. Since all coefficients are 1, this means there are $2^{20}$ terms in the expansion of $A(x)$.\nFor $B(x)$, the sum of coefficients is $B(1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+1) = 2^{20}$. This means there are $2^{20}$ terms in the expansion of $B(x)$.\nFor $P(x)$, the sum of coefficients is $P(1) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} (1+1+1+1) = 4^{20} = (2^2)^{20} = 2^{40}$.\n\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients of $P(x)$ is the constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n$P(x)P(x^{-1}) = A(x)B(x)A(x^{-1})B(x^{-1}) = [A(x)A(x^{-1})][B(x)B(x^{-1})]$.\nThe constant term of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $A(x)$. Since all non-zero coefficients of $A(x)$ are 1, this sum is equal to the number of terms, which is $A(1)=2^{20}$.\nSimilarly, the constant term of $B(x)B(x^{-1})$ is the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $B(x)$, which is $B(1)=2^{20}$.\n\nLet $C_A$ be the constant term of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ and $C_B$ be the constant term of $B(x)B(x^{-1})$.\nThe constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$ is the product of the constant terms $C_A C_B$.\nThis is because if $F(x) = \\sum f_n x^n$ and $G(x) = \\sum g_n x^n$, the constant term of $F(x)G(x)$ is $\\sum_{i+j=0} f_i g_j$. In our case, the functions are Laurent series, and the constant term is $f_0 g_0$.\nThe constant term of $A(x)A(x^{-1})$ is $\\sum \\alpha_j^2 = A(1) = 2^{20}$.\nThe constant term of $B(x)B(x^{-1})$ is $\\sum \\beta_l^2 = B(1) = 2^{20}$.\nTherefore, the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $P(x)$ is:\n$$ \\sum_k a_k^2 = C_A \\cdot C_B = 2^{20} \\cdot 2^{20} = 2^{40}. $$\n\n$2^{40} = (2^{10})^4 = (1024)^4 \\approx (10^3)^4 = 10^{12}$.\n$2^{40} = (2^{20})^2 = (1048576)^2 = 1099511627776$.\n\n"
