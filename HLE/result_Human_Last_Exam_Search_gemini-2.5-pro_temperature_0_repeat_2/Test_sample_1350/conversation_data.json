    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, it is a Wolfing warrior who, upon observing a Roman banner, describes a scene that is unmistakably the story of Romulus and Remus.\n\nWhile the specific name of the warrior is not mentioned in the passage, the text describes the Roman standard as depicting \"a she-wolf and two man-children at her dugs; wonderful is this.\" This description is a direct reference to the foundational myth of Rome, where the twin brothers Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf.\n\nThe observation is made in the context of the Goths preparing for battle against the invading Roman legions. The warrior expresses a sense of wonder at this emblem, noting the irony that the Romans, their enemies, use the image of a wolf, the namesake of the Wolfing clan. This moment serves to highlight the cultural differences and the impending clash between the two peoples. The narrative does not indicate that this warrior or any other character from the House of the Wolfings had visited a Roman city; rather, the description comes from encountering the Roman army and their symbols.\n\n<<<A Wolfing warrior>>>"
