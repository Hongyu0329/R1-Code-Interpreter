    "The first Academy Award winner for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was **An American in Paris (1951)**.\n\nDuring the film's celebrated 17-minute ballet sequence, a prop oil painting of the Place de la Concorde, which prominently features the Luxor Obelisk, is shown. This sequence is a dream-like interpretation of Paris, with sets inspired by various French painters. The ballet's centerpiece fountain is based on the one at the Place de la Concorde, and the setting for a romantic dance between Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron is a stylized version of this famous square. While much of the film was shot on MGM studio backlots, these artistic representations and props were used to evoke the spirit of Paris.\n\nEarlier Best Picture winners with scenes set in Paris, such as *Wings* (1927), *The Great Ziegfeld* (1936), and *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937), do not feature any known depictions of the Luxor Obelisk. Later winners, including *Gigi* (1958), also filmed in Paris and even featured the Place de la Concorde. However, the 1951 film *An American in Paris* is the first to have won the Best Picture Oscar and include a depiction of the historic monument.\n\n<<<An American in Paris (1951)>>>"
