    "### Reaction between Butadiene and 1,1-Dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene Yields Cycloaddition Products\n\nThe reaction between 1,3-butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in cycloaddition products. The specific product formed depends on the reaction conditions, as there is a competition between a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition and a [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nUnder thermal conditions, the reaction can yield both the Diels-Alder adduct and the [2+2] cycloadduct. The Diels-Alder reaction, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, involves the 1,3-butadiene acting as the diene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene as the dienophile. This concerted reaction leads to the formation of a six-membered ring. The product of this reaction is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\nSimultaneously, a [2+2] cycloaddition can occur between one of the double bonds of butadiene and the double bond of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene. This reaction results in the formation of a four-membered ring. The product of this pathway is **2-(2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)ethene**.\n\nFor similar reactions, such as with tetrafluoroethylene, it has been noted that the [2+2] cycloaddition is kinetically favored (forms faster at lower temperatures), while the [4+2] Diels-Alder product is thermodynamically favored (more stable and predominates at higher temperatures). The reaction of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene with dienes is known to undergo 1,2-addition, which corresponds to the [2+2] cycloaddition.\n\nTherefore, the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is typically a mixture of 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene and 2-(2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)ethene, with the ratio depending on the specific reaction conditions.\n\n<<<The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a mixture of two main cycloaddition products: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene** (from a [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction) and **2-(2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)ethene** (from a [2+2] cycloaddition). The relative amounts of each product depend on the reaction conditions."
