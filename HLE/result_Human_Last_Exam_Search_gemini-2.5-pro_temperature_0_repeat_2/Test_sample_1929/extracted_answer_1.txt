The product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a mixture of two main cycloaddition products: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene** (from a [4+2] Diels-Alder reaction) and **2-(2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluorocyclobutyl)ethene** (from a [2+2] cycloaddition). The relative amounts of each product depend on the reaction conditions.
