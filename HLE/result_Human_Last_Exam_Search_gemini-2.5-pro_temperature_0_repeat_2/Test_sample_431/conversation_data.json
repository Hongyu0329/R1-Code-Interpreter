    "Based on the analysis of the canonical protein sequence for the human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt accession P24046) and supporting scientific literature, there is one Cysteine residue located in the TM3-TM4 linker domain.\n\nThe human GABAAρ1 receptor, encoded by the *GABRR1* gene, is a protein of 479 amino acids, including a 21-amino acid signal peptide. Like other Cys-loop receptors, it has four transmembrane domains (TM1-4). The region connecting the third and fourth transmembrane domains is a large intracellular loop.\n\nAccording to the UniProt database, the transmembrane domains are located at the following positions in the full-length protein:\n*   **TM3:** 340-360\n*   **TM4:** 455-475\n\nThe TM3-TM4 linker, therefore, corresponds to the amino acid sequence from position 361 to 454. Analysis of this specific sequence reveals a single Cysteine (C) residue at position 370.\n\nScientific publications corroborate the finding of a single intracellular cysteine. Multiple studies state that the ρ1 subunit contains a total of three cysteine residues: two in the extracellular N-terminal domain that form a disulfide bond (the \"Cys-loop\"), and one intracellular cysteine located in the TM3-TM4 linker. While some literature refers to this intracellular residue as Cys364, this difference in numbering is likely due to the use of different reference sequences or numbering conventions (e.g., starting from the mature protein after cleavage of the signal peptide). Regardless of the positional number, the sources agree that only one cysteine is present in this intracellular loop.\n\n<<<1>>>"
