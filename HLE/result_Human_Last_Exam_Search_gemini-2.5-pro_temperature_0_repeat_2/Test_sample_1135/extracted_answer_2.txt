In the CCSD method, because the electronic Hamiltonian contains at most two-body interactions and the cluster operator is truncated at double excitations ($T = T_1 + T_2$), the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H} = e^{-T} H e^T$, when acting on the reference determinant $|\Phi\rangle$, can generate states with at most four particle-hole excitations. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion of $\bar{H}$ terminates at the four-fold commutator. The most highly excited states generated arise from terms such as those proportional to $(H T_2^2)_C$, which produce quadruply excited determinants.

By definition, in CCSD, the amplitudes are determined by setting the projections of $\bar{H}|\Phi\rangle$ onto the space of singly and doubly excited determinants to zero. The matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are generally non-zero for triply and quadruply excited Slater determinants ($|\Phi_{ijk}^{abc}\rangle$ and $|\Phi_{ijkl}^{abcd}\rangle$).

However, for any Slater determinant with five or more excitations (quintuply, sextuply, etc.), the matrix element $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ is identically zero. This is because no term in the CCSD-transformed Hamiltonian can create more than four particle-hole pairs from the reference determinant. Therefore, the matrix elements are zero for all excited Slater determinants with an excitation level of five or higher.
