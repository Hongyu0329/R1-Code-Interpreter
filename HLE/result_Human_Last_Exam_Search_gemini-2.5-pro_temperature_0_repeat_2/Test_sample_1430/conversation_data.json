    "### Smallest and Largest Rank of the Néron-Severi Group Determined\n\nThe smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface is 2, while the largest possible rank is 10. This range is determined by the specific geometric properties of the Riemann surface, particularly whether it is hyperelliptic and whether its Jacobian variety has complex multiplication.\n\nLet C be a Riemann surface of genus g=3 and X be its 15th symmetric power, denoted as Sym^15(C). The rank of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted as ρ(X), is tied to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, Jac(C). The precise relationship depends on whether C is a hyperelliptic curve.\n\nA key result by A. Beauville establishes that for a smooth projective curve C of genus g and its d-th symmetric power Sym^d(C), the rank ρ(Sym^d(C)) is determined as follows:\n- If C is not hyperelliptic, ρ(Sym^d(C)) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C)).\n- If C is hyperelliptic and d is odd, ρ(Sym^d(C)) = 2 + ρ(Jac(C)), as all endomorphisms of a Jacobian commute with the involution [-1].\n\nIn this case, d=15 is odd, so both scenarios must be considered.\n\n**Smallest Possible Rank**\n\nTo find the minimum rank, we consider a generic Riemann surface of genus 3.\n*   A generic curve C is not hyperelliptic. For such a curve, its Jacobian has the minimum possible Néron-Severi rank, which is ρ(Jac(C)) = 1. This corresponds to the case where the only endomorphisms of the Jacobian are multiplications by integers.\n*   Applying the formula for non-hyperelliptic curves, we get ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(Jac(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n*   For a generic hyperelliptic curve of genus 3, ρ(Jac(C)) would also be 1. The rank of the symmetric power would then be ρ(X) = 2 + ρ(Jac(C)) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nComparing these, the smallest possible rank is 2, achieved by a generic non-hyperelliptic curve.\n\n**Largest Possible Rank**\n\nThe maximum rank is achieved when the curve C has a Jacobian with a large number of endomorphisms, a property known as complex multiplication (CM).\n*   **Non-hyperelliptic case:** The maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of an abelian variety of dimension g is g². For g=3, this maximum is 9. This rank is achieved by the Jacobian of the Fermat curve F₄, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ = 1. This curve has genus 3 and is not hyperelliptic. For the Fermat curve, ρ(Jac(F₄)) = 9.\n*   Using the formula for non-hyperelliptic curves, the rank of its 15th symmetric power is ρ(X) = 1 + ρ(Jac(F₄)) = 1 + 9 = 10.\n*   **Hyperelliptic case:** For a hyperelliptic curve C of genus g, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is bounded by g² - 2g + 2. For g=3, this bound is 9 - 6 + 2 = 5.\n*   Assuming this maximum is achieved, the rank for the symmetric power would be ρ(X) = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nComparing the maximum values from both cases (10 and 7), the largest possible rank for ρ(X) is 10.\n\nIn summary, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface can range from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 10, depending on the choice of the curve C.\n\n<<<Smallest rank: 2, Largest rank: 10>>>"
