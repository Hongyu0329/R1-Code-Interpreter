    "After a gene duplication event, the new gene copy is often redundant. This redundancy means that one of the copies can accumulate mutations without harming the organism, as the other copy still performs the original function. The ultimate fate of these duplicated genes is crucial for generating genetic novelty and evolutionary innovation. Several mechanisms determine whether these duplicates are retained and how they diverge.\n\nOf the choices provided, the most likely mechanisms responsible for the retention and divergence of functional duplicate genes are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n*   **Pseudogenization (B)** is the most common fate for a duplicated gene, where one copy accumulates debilitating mutations and becomes non-functional. While the pseudogene is \"retained\" as a non-functional sequence, this process does not represent the retention of two diverged, *functional* genes.\n*   **Gene conversion (A)** is a process that makes one DNA sequence identical to another homologous sequence, which leads to the homogenization of duplicates, counteracting divergence.\n*   **Adaptive radiation (E)** is a macroevolutionary process involving the rapid diversification of a species into multiple new forms, not a mechanism for retaining individual genes within a genome.\n\nThis leaves neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization as the primary mechanisms for the retention of two functional, yet divergent, gene copies.\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization (C)** occurs when one gene copy retains the ancestral function, while the other acquires a completely new, beneficial function through mutation. This provides a strong selective advantage for keeping both copies.\n*   **Subfunctionalization (D)** happens when an ancestral gene had multiple functions (or expression patterns), and after duplication, each copy loses a different sub-function through mutation. As a result, both genes are now required to perform the complete set of original functions, ensuring their retention. This process is described by the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model.\n\nWhile both are critical, **subfunctionalization** is often considered the more likely initial mechanism for duplicate gene retention. This is because it can result from more common neutral or slightly deleterious mutations that partition the original function, a more probable event than the rare occurrence of a beneficial mutation that creates a novel function (neofunctionalization). Subfunctionalization provides a clear and immediate reason for the genome to preserve both copies, saving them from being lost to pseudogenization. This retention then allows more evolutionary time for one copy to potentially evolve a new function, meaning subfunctionalization can act as a transitional state to neofunctionalization.\n\nTherefore, because it relies on a more common and passive process of complementary mutation and degeneration, subfunctionalization is a highly probable and crucial mechanism for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
