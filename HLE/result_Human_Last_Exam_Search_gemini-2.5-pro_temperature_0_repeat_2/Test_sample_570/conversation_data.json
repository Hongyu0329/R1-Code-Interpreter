    "The problem asks for the minimal area of a convex domain `K` in the plane that intersects every line with the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain. The condition that `K` intersects the line `px + qy = 1` can be expressed using the support function of `K`, which is defined as `h_K(u, v) = sup{ux + vy | (x, y) ∈ K}`. A line `ux + vy = c` intersects `K` if and only if `inf{ux + vy | (x, y) ∈ K} ≤ c ≤ sup{ux + vy | (x, y) ∈ K}`.\nSince `K` is convex, `inf{ux + vy | (x, y) ∈ K} = -h_K(-u, -v)`.\nThus, for each pair of coprime integers `(p, q)`, the line `px + qy = 1` must satisfy:\n-`h_K(-p, -q) ≤ 1 ≤ h_K(p, q)`\n\nThis condition must hold for all pairs of coprime integers `(p, q)`. Let's consider a few specific pairs:\n*   `(p,q) = (1,0)`: The line is `x = 1`. The condition implies `h_K(1,0) ≥ 1`.\n*   `(p,q) = (-1,0)`: The line is `-x = 1`. The condition implies `h_K(-1,0) ≥ 1`.\n*   `(p,q) = (0,1)`: The line is `y = 1`. The condition implies `h_K(0,1) ≥ 1`.\n*   `(p,q) = (0,-1)`: The line is `-y = 1`. The condition implies `h_K(0,-1) ≥ 1`.\n\nThe width of a convex set `K` in the direction of a unit vector `u` is given by `w_K(u) = h_K(u) + h_K(-u)`.\nFor the direction `(1,0)`, the width of `K` is `w_K(1,0) = h_K(1,0) + h_K(-1,0) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2`.\nFor the direction `(0,1)`, the width of `K` is `w_K(0,1) = h_K(0,1) + h_K(0,-1) ≥ 1 + 1 = 2`.\nSo, the domain `K` must have a width of at least 2 in both the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nLet's perform a linear transformation of the plane:\n`u = x + y`\n`v = x - y`\nThe inverse transformation is:\n`x = (u + v) / 2`\n`y = (u - v) / 2`\n\nA convex set `K` in the `(x,y)`-plane is transformed into a convex set `K'` in the `(u,v)`-plane. The area of `K` is related to the area of `K'` by the Jacobian of the transformation:\n`Area(K) = ∬_K dx dy = ∬_{K'} |J| du dv`\nThe Jacobian determinant is `J = det([[∂x/∂u, ∂x/∂v], [∂y/∂u, ∂y/∂v]]) = det([[1/2, 1/2], [1/2, -1/2]]) = -1/4 - 1/4 = -1/2`.\nSo, `|J| = 1/2`, and `Area(K) = (1/2) * Area(K')`.\n\nThe equation of the line `px + qy = 1` transforms as follows:\n`p((u+v)/2) + q((u-v)/2) = 1`\n`(p+q)u + (p-q)v = 2`\n\nThe condition is that the new convex set `K'` must intersect the line `(p+q)u + (p-q)v = 2` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`. Let's examine the lines generated by some specific pairs `(p,q)`:\n*   `(p,q) = (1,1)` (coprime): `(1+1)u + (1-1)v = 2`  => `2u = 2` => `u = 1`.\n*   `(p,q) = (-1,-1)` (coprime): `(-1-1)u + (-1-(-1))v = 2` => `-2u = 2` => `u = -1`.\n*   `(p,q) = (1,-1)` (coprime): `(1-1)u + (1-(-1))v = 2` => `2v = 2` => `v = 1`.\n*   `(p,q) = (-1,1)` (coprime): `(-1+1)u + (-1-1)v = 2` => `-2v = 2` => `v = -1`.\n\nSince `K'` must intersect the lines `u=1` and `u=-1`, its width in the `u`-direction must be at least 2. Similarly, since it must intersect `v=1` and `v=-1`, its width in the `v`-direction must be at least 2.\n\nThe minimal area of a convex set `K'` with orthogonal widths `w_u ≥ 2` and `w_v ≥ 2` is 4. This minimum is achieved by a rectangle with side lengths 2 and 2, for example, the square `S' = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n\nTherefore, the minimal area of `K'` is 4.\n`min Area(K) = (1/2) * min Area(K') = (1/2) * 4 = 2`.\n\nThe convex domain `K` that achieves this minimum area is the one corresponding to the square `K' = S'`. To find `K`, we transform `S'` back to the `(x,y)`-plane. The square `S'` is defined by the inequalities `-1 ≤ u ≤ 1` and `-1 ≤ v ≤ 1`.\nSubstituting `u = x+y` and `v = x-y`, we get:\n`-1 ≤ x+y ≤ 1`\n`-1 ≤ x-y ≤ 1`\nThis set of inequalities defines a square with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`. This shape is often called a diamond. The area of this diamond is `(√2)² = 2`.\n\nWe must verify that this diamond `D = {(x,y) | |x|+|y| ≤ 1}` intersects all lines `px+qy=1` for coprime `p,q`. The support function of this diamond is `h_D(p,q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. The condition for intersection is `1 ≤ h_D(p,q) = max(|p|, |q|)`. Since `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. Thus, at least one of them is a non-zero integer, which means `max(|p|, |q|) ≥ 1`. The condition is satisfied for all coprime pairs `(p,q)`.\n\nThe minimal area is therefore 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
