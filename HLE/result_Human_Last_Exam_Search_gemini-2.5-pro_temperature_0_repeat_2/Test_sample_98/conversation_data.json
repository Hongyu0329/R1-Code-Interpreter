    "When an icosahedron-shaped tank is positioned to stand on one of its flat faces, its base is an equilateral triangle. Due to the symmetrical nature of the icosahedron, the top face is also an equilateral triangle, parallel to the base.\n\nThe surface of any liquid at rest, such as water, forms a horizontal plane. Therefore, the shape of the water's surface inside the tank will be determined by the horizontal cross-section of the icosahedron at the water's level.\n\nWhen the tank is half-filled by volume, the water level is exactly at the midpoint of the tank's height. This is because the icosahedron is symmetrical from top to bottom when resting on a face. The horizontal plane at this mid-height intersects the icosahedron to form the shape of the water surface.\n\nAn icosahedron has a three-fold rotational symmetry axis that passes through the center of the base and the top face when it is resting on one of them. Consequently, the cross-section at the halfway point must also exhibit at least three-fold symmetry. Considering the structure of an icosahedron, the horizontal plane at half its height intersects six of its triangular faces. This intersection creates a six-sided polygon. Due to the overall symmetry of the icosahedron in this orientation, this polygon is a regular hexagon.\n\nWhile cross-sections of an icosahedron can be other shapes like a pentagon or a decagon in different orientations, for an icosahedron resting on a face, the cross-section at its center is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon.>>>"
