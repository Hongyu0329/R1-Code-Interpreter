    "The curve in question is a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(9t) and y(t) = sin(5t). To determine the number of self-intersection points, we can use a known formula for Lissajous curves.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve with the form x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt), where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points depends on whether 'a' and 'b' are odd or even.\n\nIn this specific case, we have:\n*   a = 9\n*   b = 5\n\nBoth 'a' and 'b' are odd numbers. They are also coprime, as their greatest common divisor is 1.\n\nFor Lissajous curves where both 'a' and 'b' are odd and coprime, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2.\n\nPlugging in the values of a = 9 and b = 5:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nTherefore, the curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
