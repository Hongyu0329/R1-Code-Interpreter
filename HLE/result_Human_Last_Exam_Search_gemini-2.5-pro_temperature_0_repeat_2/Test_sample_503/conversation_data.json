    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, between an object $[m]$ and an object $[n]$ consists of a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, that act as a left and right adjoint, respectively. This relationship is defined by the condition that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$, the equivalence $f(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le g(j)$ holds.\n\nAn adjunction is uniquely determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint. Therefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of possible left adjoint maps from $$ to $$.\n\nA map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ between two posets that are complete lattices is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema. For the finite linear order $[m] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, this condition simplifies to the map preserving the least element. Thus, an order-preserving map $f: [m] \\to [n]$ is a left adjoint if and only if $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ that satisfy the condition $f(0) = 0$. An order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values. We need to count the number of sequences $f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nSince $f(0)$ is fixed, we need to determine the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$, with values chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$, which has $38$ elements. This is a classic combinatorial problem of choosing 23 items from 38 with replacement, where order does not matter. The number of such combinations is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{n+k-1}{k} $$\nHere, $k=23$ (the length of the sequence to choose) and $n=38$ (the number of possible values). The number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\nAlternatively, we could count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. A map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves the greatest element, meaning $g(37) = 23$. This would require counting the number of non-decreasing sequences $g(0), \\dots, g(36)$ from the set $\\{0, \\dots, 23\\}$, which has 24 elements. The number of such maps is:\n$$ \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, both methods yield the same result.\n\nCalculating the value of $\\binom{60}{23}$:\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23!(60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23!37!} = 47,324,441,530,363,400 $$\n\n<<<47324441530363400>>>"
