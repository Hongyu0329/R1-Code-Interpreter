    "Let $G$ be a graph with $n=12345$ vertices. The number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring of $G$ is called the chromatic number, denoted by $\\chi(G)$. The question asks for the maximum possible value of $\\chi(G)$ for a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n\nFor any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is always less than or equal to $n$. The only graph for which $\\chi(G) = n$ is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. Since the problem states that $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$), its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound for the chromatic number:\n$\\chi(G) \\leq n - 1$\nFor $n=12345$, this means $\\chi(G) \\leq 12344$.\n\nTo determine if this maximum is achievable, we must find a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider a graph $G$ constructed as follows:\n1.  Take a complete subgraph $K_{12344}$ on 12344 vertices.\n2.  Add one additional vertex, let's call it $v$.\n3.  Do not add any edges connecting $v$ to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ subgraph. The vertex $v$ is an isolated vertex.\n\nThis graph $G$ has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the vertex $v$ is not connected to any other vertices.\n\nThe chromatic number of this graph $G$ is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. The components are the complete graph $K_{12344}$ and the isolated vertex $v$ (which is a $K_1$).\n*   The chromatic number of the complete graph $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n*   The chromatic number of the isolated vertex $K_1$ is 1.\n\nTherefore, the chromatic number of $G$ is $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nSince we have constructed a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of 12344, and we have shown that no such graph can have a higher chromatic number, the maximum number of colors needed is 12344.\n\nAnother way to think about this is through Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, $\\chi(G) \\leq \\Delta(G)$ (the maximum degree), unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Consider a graph formed by taking $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge. The maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12344$. This graph is not a complete graph. According to Brooks' Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 12344. It can be shown that this graph indeed requires 12344 colors.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
