    "True.\n\nSNP heritability (h²<sub>SNP</sub>) is defined as the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically those on a genotyping array. It represents the theoretical upper limit of prediction for a linear model using these SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score (PGS) is a practical tool that aggregates the effects of these SNPs to predict an individual's phenotype. The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by the amount of variance it explains (R²).\n\nThe key distinction is that SNP heritability is a theoretical parameter for a population, while a PGS is a predictive model built from data. The process of creating a PGS involves estimating the effect sizes of each SNP from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). These estimations are not perfect and contain errors. When the PGS is then applied to a new set of individuals, its predictive power is limited by these estimation errors and potential differences between the study samples.\n\nTherefore, because the effect sizes used to construct a polygenic score are estimated with error, the variance explained by a PGS is practically always lower than the total variance that could theoretically be explained by all the SNPs, which is the SNP heritability. In an ideal scenario with no errors in effect size estimation, the predictive ability of a PGS could, in theory, equal the SNP heritability. However, this is not achievable in practice.\n\n<<<True>>>"
