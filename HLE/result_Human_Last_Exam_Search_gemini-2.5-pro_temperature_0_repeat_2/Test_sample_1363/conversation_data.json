    "The ability to overturn a reverse turn—that is, to turn more than the standard amount for a figure—is a common technique in many ballroom dances, used for floorcraft or to create different alignments. However, in one of the listed dances, the fundamental technique makes this action impossible without violating the dance's core principles.\n\nIn the \"swing\" dances like the English Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, and Quickstep, the technique is built on principles of continuous, flowing movement. These dances utilize Contra Body Movement (CBM), body sway, and footwork that allows for smooth rotation. This rotational nature means that figures can be adapted, and turns can be overturned or underturned as needed for choreography or navigating the dance floor. For instance, in Viennese Waltz and English Waltz, overturning a reverse turn is possible, even if it's difficult or not part of the standard figure. Similarly, Quickstep and Slow Foxtrot allow for variations in the amount of turn in their figures.\n\nThe European Tango, however, is fundamentally different. Its technique is characterized by a staccato, non-continuous action. Key aspects of Tango technique include:\n*   **No Rise and Fall:** Unlike the waltzes and foxtrot, Tango is a flat-footed dance with no elevation.\n*   **No Continuous Rotation:** Turns are sharp and happen between steps, not as a continuous, flowing movement through the steps.\n*   **Lack of CBM on Turns:** While CBM is used to get into a position (like outside partner), it is not used to generate rotation in the way it is in swing dances. The turn is often described as a \"corkscrew\" action where the feet are placed, and then the body turns.\n\nBecause of this staccato technique and the absence of continuous rotational mechanics in the feet and body, a reverse turn in Tango has a fixed amount of rotation determined by the placement of the feet. Attempting to \"overturn\" it would require introducing sway, continuous rotation, and a different use of CBM, which would fundamentally disregard the core technique of the Tango.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
