    "To determine which flags of African nations share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag under the given conditions.\n\n### Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows or columns. To ensure the rank is maximal, we assign distinct numerical values to each color on a flag. The Danish flag, known as the Dannebrog, consists of a red field with a white Scandinavian cross.\n\nWhen we represent this flag as a matrix, we can analyze its row patterns:\n1.  **Rows not part of the horizontal crossbar:** These rows consist of a red section, a white section (from the vertical part of the cross), and another red section. All rows in the upper and lower fields of the flag follow this same pattern.\n2.  **Rows that form the horizontal crossbar:** These rows are entirely white.\n\nSince there are only two distinct patterns for the rows, the matrix representing the Danish flag has exactly two linearly independent rows. Therefore, the maximal linear algebraic rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n### Analyzing Flags of African Nations\n\nWe now search for flags of African nations that also have a rank of 2. This requires a flag design that results in exactly two unique row patterns.\n\n*   **Flags with Rank 1:** Flags with only one color or flags with vertical stripes (like Nigeria or Ivory Coast) have only one row pattern, as every row is identical. Their rank is 1.\n*   **Flags with Rank 3 or more:** Flags with three or more horizontal stripes of different colors (like Gabon or Sierra Leone) will have a rank of at least 3. Flags with complex symbols such as stars, shields, or diagonal lines (like Somalia, Kenya, or the Democratic Republic of the Congo) will have many different row patterns, leading to a rank much higher than 2.\n\nThe only African national flag that is composed of exactly two distinct row patterns is the flag of Madagascar.\n\n### The Flag of Madagascar\n\nThe flag of Madagascar features a white vertical stripe on the hoist side, with two horizontal stripes, red over green, on the fly side. When viewed as a matrix, its rows have two distinct patterns:\n1.  **Rows in the upper half:** These rows consist of a white section followed by a red section.\n2.  **Rows in the lower half:** These rows consist of a white section followed by a green section.\n\nBecause the flag of Madagascar is composed of exactly two unique row patterns, its maximal linear algebraic rank is 2.\n\nNo other African national flag has a design that produces exactly two distinct row patterns. For example, the flag of Angola has two horizontal bands but includes a complex central emblem which introduces many more row patterns, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n\n<<<Madagascar>>>"
