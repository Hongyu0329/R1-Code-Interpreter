    "The number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997) is 487,669,796,333,940,302,183,865.\n\nAn involution in a group is an element that is its own inverse. To find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997), one must analyze the structure of its parent group, the special unitary group SU(4, 997). The involutions in PSU(4, 997) are the images of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g` squared is in the center of SU(4, 997).\n\nThe key steps in determining this number are:\n1.  **Identifying the Center of SU(4, 997):** The center of SU(n, q) has an order equal to the greatest common divisor of n and q+1. For SU(4, 997), this is gcd(4, 998) = 2. The center consists of the identity matrix `I` and `-I`.\n\n2.  **Finding Pre-images of Involutions:** The elements `g` in SU(4, 997) that map to involutions in PSU(4, 997) must satisfy `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\n3.  **Analyzing `g^2 = -I`:** An element `g` in the unitary group U(n, q) must have eigenvalues `λ` that satisfy the condition `λ^(q+1) = 1`. If `g^2 = -I`, its eigenvalues must be `i` or `-i` (where `i^2 = -1`). This leads to the requirement that `i^(q+1) = 1`. For q = 997, which is of the form 4k+1, `i^(997+1) = i^998 = (i^2)^499 = (-1)^499 = -1`. This results in a contradiction (`-1 = 1`), proving that there are no elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing `g^2 = I`:** This means we only need to consider the involutions within SU(4, 997). In SU(4, q), there is one conjugacy class of non-central involutions. These are elements similar to a diagonal matrix with two eigenvalues of 1 and two of -1. The central involutions, `I` and `-I`, map to the identity element in PSU(4, 997).\n\n5.  **Counting the Involutions:** The number of these non-central involutions in SU(4, 997) is given by the formula `q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`, where q = 997.\n\n6.  **Projecting to PSU(4, 997):** When projecting from SU(4, 997) to PSU(4, 997), each involution `g` and its negative `-g` (which is also an involution in the same conjugacy class) are mapped to the same element. Therefore, the total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is half the number of non-central involutions in SU(4, 997).\n\nThis results in the final formula for the number of involutions: `(q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`.\n\nSubstituting q = 997 yields the specific number:\n`(997^4 * (997^2 + 1) * (997^2 - 997 + 1)) / 2 = 487,669,796,333,940,302,183,865`.\n\n<<<487669796333940302183865>>>"
