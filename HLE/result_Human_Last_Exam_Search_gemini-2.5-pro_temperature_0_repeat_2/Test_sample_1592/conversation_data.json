    "The closest province to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\nWaskaganish is a Cree community situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay in the Nord-du-Qu√©bec region. The province of Ontario lies to the west of Quebec, and James Bay separates the two provinces. The traditional territory of the Cree people, known as \"Eeyou Istchee,\" encompasses the James Bay regions of both northern Quebec and Ontario.\n\nWhile there are no direct roads connecting Waskaganish to the Ontario border, the proximity is evident from its location on the coast of James Bay. The border between the two provinces runs down the middle of James Bay. The closest point of land in Ontario would be across the bay. The driving distance from Waskaganish to towns in southern Ontario, such as North Bay, is over 900 kilometers. However, the direct geographical distance to the Ontario border across James Bay is significantly shorter.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
