    "In two patches of surface code, each with two holes, a maximum of four logical qubits can be encoded. This is based on the principle that for a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits can be equivalent to the number of \"closed\" holes introduced into the code's lattice.\n\nA surface code is a type of quantum error-correcting code that arranges physical qubits on a two-dimensional grid. By creating defects, or \"holes,\" in this grid, it is possible to encode logical qubits, which are more robust to errors than the individual physical qubits.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded depends on the topological properties of the surface and the nature of the holes. For a planar surface code with *b* closed holes, it is possible to encode *k = b* logical qubits. Therefore, a single patch of surface code with two closed holes can encode a maximum of two logical qubits.\n\nSince the query specifies two such patches, and assuming these patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the logical qubits from each patch. With each patch encoding two logical qubits, the total is:\n\n2 (from the first patch) + 2 (from the second patch) = 4 logical qubits.\n\nIt is worth noting that other methods of encoding exist, such as creating a pair of holes to encode a single logical qubit. However, the arrangement of one logical qubit per closed hole allows for a denser storage of quantum information and represents the maximum capacity under these conditions.\n\n<<<4>>>"
