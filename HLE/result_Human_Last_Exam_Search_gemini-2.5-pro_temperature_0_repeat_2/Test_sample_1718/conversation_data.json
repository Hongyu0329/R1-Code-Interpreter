    "On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` (and thus real dimension `2n`), the Riemann tensor possesses more symmetries than on a general Riemannian manifold. These additional symmetries significantly reduce the number of its independent components.\n\nOn a general `m`-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor `R_{ijkl}` has the following symmetries:\n1.  Antisymmetry in the first two indices: `R_{ijkl} = -R_{jikl}`\n2.  Antisymmetry in the last two indices: `R_{ijkl} = -R_{ijlk}`\n3.  Symmetry between pairs of indices: `R_{ijkl} = R_{klij}`\n4.  The first Bianchi identity: `R_{ijkl} + R_{iklj} + R_{iljk} = 0`\n\nThese symmetries reduce the number of independent components to `m^2(m^2 - 1)/12`. For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n`, the real dimension is `m = 2n`, which would give `(2n)^2((2n)^2 - 1)/12 = n^2(4n^2 - 1)/3` independent components if it were only a Riemannian manifold.\n\nHowever, a Kähler manifold has a complex structure `J` that is compatible with the metric. This compatibility imposes further constraints on the Riemann tensor. The key additional symmetries on a Kähler manifold are that the only non-zero components of the Riemann tensor, in a holomorphic coordinate system, are those of the form `R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}`, where `i, j, k, l` range from 1 to `n`.\n\nFurthermore, these non-zero components have the following symmetries:\n*   `R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}} = R_{k\\bar{j}i\\bar{l}}`\n*   `R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}} = R_{i\\bar{l}k\\bar{j}}`\n\nThese symmetries imply that the Riemann tensor is determined by a Hermitian form on the space of symmetric `n x n` matrices. The complex vector space of symmetric `n x n` matrices has dimension `n(n+1)/2`. A Hermitian form on a vector space of dimension `d` is determined by `d^2` real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n` is given by the square of the dimension of the space of symmetric `n x n` matrices.\n\n<<<On a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `n`, the Riemann tensor has `(n(n+1)/2)^2` independent entries."
