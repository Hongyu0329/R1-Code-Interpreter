    "In the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q_128, there are 7 power subgroups.\n\nThe term \"power subgroup\" is not standard in group theory, but in the context of a *p*-group (a group where every element's order is a power of a prime *p*), it most commonly refers to the subgroups in the lower *p*-series, also known as the series of power subgroups. The generalized quaternion group Q_128 is a 2-group, as its order is 128 = 2⁷.\n\nThis series of subgroups is defined as follows:\n*   P₀(G) = G\n*   Pᵢ(G) = <g^(pⁱ) | g ∈ G> for i ≥ 1\n\nFor the generalized quaternion group Q_128, which can be represented as <x, y | x⁶⁴ = 1, x³² = y², yxy⁻¹ = x⁻¹>, the series of power subgroups (with p=2) is:\n*   **P₀(Q₁₂₈)** = Q₁₂₈ (the group itself).\n*   **P₁(Q₁₂₈)** = <g² | g ∈ Q₁₂₈>. The squares of elements in Q₁₂₈ are either powers of x² or are equal to x³². This generates the cyclic subgroup <x²>, which has an order of 32.\n*   **P₂(Q₁₂₈)** = <g⁴ | g ∈ Q₁₂₈>. This generates the cyclic subgroup <x⁴> of order 16.\n*   **P₃(Q₁₂₈)** = <g⁸ | g ∈ Q₁₂₈>. This generates the cyclic subgroup <x⁸> of order 8.\n*   **P₄(Q₁₂₈)** = <g¹⁶ | g ∈ Q₁₂₈>. This generates the cyclic subgroup <x¹⁶> of order 4.\n*   **P₅(Q₁₂₈)** = <g³² | g ∈ Q₁₂₈>. This generates the cyclic subgroup <x³²> of order 2.\n*   **P₆(Q₁₂₈)** = <g⁶⁴ | g ∈ Q₁₂₈>. This generates the trivial subgroup {e} of order 1.\n\nAll further subgroups in this series (Pᵢ(Q₁₂₈) for i > 6) are also the trivial subgroup. Counting the distinct subgroups in this series gives a total of 7 power subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
