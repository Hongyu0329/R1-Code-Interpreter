    "The computational time complexity of the algorithm depends on how the cost of the arithmetic operations (division and multiplication) is measured.\n\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the number `n` by the base `c` until the result is 0. The remainder of each division gives one digit in the new base.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1.  **Number of Iterations:** The `while` loop continues as long as `q` (the quotient) is greater than 0. In each iteration, the value of `x` is effectively divided by `c`. The loop runs until `n` has been divided by `c` enough times to become 0. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` is given by the logarithm. Therefore, the loop executes `O(log_c(n))` times.\n\n2.  **Cost of Operations Inside the Loop:** The core operations inside the loop are `q := ⌊x/c⌋` (integer division) and `a_i := x - qc` (which is equivalent to `x mod c`). The complexity of these operations depends on the size of the numbers. Let the number of bits in `n` be `k`, so `k` is approximately `log₂(n)`.\n\nThere are two common ways to analyze the complexity:\n\n*   **Assuming elementary operations are O(1):** If we assume that the numbers `n` and `c` fit within a single machine word (e.g., a 64-bit integer), then division and modulo operations can be considered to take constant time, O(1). In this model, the total time complexity is the number of iterations multiplied by the constant time per iteration.\n    *   **Complexity:** `O(log_c(n)) * O(1) = O(log_c(n))`\n    *   This is a common analysis in introductory algorithm courses and is practical for numbers that are not arbitrarily large.\n\n*   **Considering bit complexity for large numbers:** If `n` is an arbitrarily large number (a \"bignum\"), we must consider the cost of arithmetic operations as a function of the number of bits. The division of an `k`-bit number by a `j`-bit number takes more than constant time.\n    *   The division of a `k`-bit number `x` by a `j`--bit number `c` using the standard long division algorithm takes `O(k * j)` time. In our case, `j` (the number of bits in `c`) is fixed, and `k` (the number of bits in `x`) decreases in each iteration.\n    *   The number of iterations is `O(log_c(n))`, which is `O(log n / log c)`.\n    *   The number of bits in `x` is initially `O(log n)` and decreases.\n    *   The cost of the first division is `O(log(n) * log(c))`. The cost of the last division is `O(log(c))`.\n    *   Summing the costs of all divisions results in a total complexity of `O((log n)²)`. A naive analysis would be the number of iterations times the maximum cost per iteration: `O(log_c(n) * log(n) * log(c)) = O((log n / log c) * log n * log c) = O((log n)²)`.\n    *   More advanced algorithms for division exist that are as fast as multiplication, leading to a complexity of `O(M(log n))` for a single division, where `M(k)` is the time to multiply two `k`-bit numbers. Using such methods, the overall complexity for base conversion can be reduced to `O(M(log n) * log(log n))`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the purpose of a standard algorithm analysis, where arithmetic operations on word-sized numbers are considered O(1), the complexity is determined by the number of loop iterations.\n\n<<<O(log_c(n))>>>"
