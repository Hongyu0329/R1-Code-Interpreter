    "### Unraveling the Spin-Orbit Coupling in a p-Electron: A Solution for J² and Jz Eigenvalues\n\nFor a p-electron under the influence of spin-orbit coupling, the total angular momentum and its projection onto the z-axis are quantized. The common eigenvalues of the corresponding operators, J² (the square of the total angular momentum) and Jz (the z-component of the total angular momentum), can be determined by combining the electron's orbital and spin angular momenta.\n\nA p-electron is characterized by an orbital angular momentum quantum number (l) of 1. As a fundamental particle, an electron possesses an intrinsic spin angular momentum quantum number (s) of 1/2.\n\nThe total angular momentum quantum number, *j*, arises from the coupling of the orbital and spin angular momenta. Its possible values are determined by the range from the absolute difference of *l* and *s* to their sum, in integer steps.\n\nFor a p-electron:\n*   l = 1\n*   s = 1/2\n\nThe possible values for *j* are:\n*   j = |l - s| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2\n*   j = l + s = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n\nTherefore, the p-electron can exist in two distinct total angular momentum states, one with j = 3/2 and another with j = 1/2.\n\nThe operators J² and Jz commute, meaning they can have simultaneous, well-defined eigenvalues for a given quantum state. The eigenvalues are given by:\n*   Eigenvalue of J² = ħ² * j(j + 1)\n*   Eigenvalue of Jz = ħ * m_j\n\nHere, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and *m_j* is the total angular momentum projection quantum number, which can take on 2j + 1 values from -j to +j in integer increments.\n\nThe common eigenvalues for the two possible states of the p-electron are as follows:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of J² is calculated as:\n    ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = ħ² * (3/2) * (5/2) = **(15/4)ħ²**\n\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, and 3/2. This leads to four possible eigenvalues for Jz:\n    *   **-3/2 ħ**\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **1/2 ħ**\n    *   **3/2 ħ**\n\nThus, for the j = 3/2 state, there are four sets of common eigenvalues: {(15/4)ħ², -3/2 ħ}, {(15/4)ħ², -1/2 ħ}, {(15/4)ħ², 1/2 ħ}, and {(15/4)ħ², 3/2 ħ}.\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n\n*   The eigenvalue of J² is:\n    ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = ħ² * (1/2) * (3/2) = **(3/4)ħ²**\n\n*   The possible values for *m_j* are -1/2 and 1/2. This results in two possible eigenvalues for Jz:\n    *   **-1/2 ħ**\n    *   **1/2 ħ**\n\nFor the j = 1/2 state, the two sets of common eigenvalues are: {(3/4)ħ², -1/2 ħ} and {(3/4)ħ², 1/2 ħ}.\n\nIn summary, the spin-orbit interaction splits the p-electron's energy level into two manifolds, each characterized by a specific total angular momentum quantum number *j*. Within each manifold, there are 2j + 1 distinct states, each with a unique projection of the total angular momentum along the z-axis.\n\n<<<For a p-electron, the possible common eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ are:\nFor the state with total angular momentum quantum number **j = 3/2**:\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(15/4)ħ²**.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **-3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, and 3/2 ħ**.\n\nFor the state with total angular momentum quantum number **j = 1/2**:\nThe eigenvalue of $J^2$ is **(3/4)ħ²**.\nThe corresponding eigenvalues of $J_z$ are **-1/2 ħ and 1/2 ħ**.>>>"
