    "The search results confirm the concepts used in the derivation. Specifically, they discuss Pauli channels, complementary channels, and the rank of quantum channels. The relationship between a channel and its complementary channel via the Stinespring dilation is mentioned in several sources. The concept of the Choi matrix and its rank being the rank of the channel is also standard. One source mentions that for a depolarizing channel, the Choi matrix has rank d^2, and it's possible to find a representation with d^2 Kraus operators. This supports the idea that the environment can have a dimension of d^2. The search results do not directly state the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel, but they provide all the necessary background to confirm that the derivation is correct. The reasoning that the rank is at most d^2 and that this value is achievable for a specific choice of Pauli channel (like the completely depolarizing channel) is sound and consistent with the literature. Therefore, I can proceed with the final answer.\n\n<<<The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that transforms a qudit density matrix into another qudit density matrix is $d^2$.\n\nA qudit is a quantum system with $d$ levels. A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional system is described by the following operation on a density matrix $\\rho$:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k U_k \\rho U_k^\\dagger$\nHere, $\\{U_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators, which form a complete orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $\\{p_k\\}$ form a probability distribution, meaning $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = 1$.\n\nThe complementary channel, denoted as $\\Lambda^c$, describes the information that is transferred from the quantum system to its environment. The output of the complementary channel is a state in the environment's Hilbert space. The rank of a quantum channel is defined as the dimension of the subspace spanned by the possible output states of the channel. This is equivalent to the rank of the channel's Choi matrix.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ can be determined by analyzing the linear map that defines it. This map takes the input density matrix $\\rho$ (a $d \\times d$ matrix) to an output matrix that represents the state of the environment. The dimension of the input space of $d \\times d$ matrices is $d^2$. According to the fundamental properties of linear maps, the dimension of the output space (the rank) cannot exceed the dimension of the input space. Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel is at most $d^2$.\n\nTo determine if this maximum value can be achieved, we need to find a specific Pauli channel for which the rank of its complementary channel is exactly $d^2$. Consider a Pauli channel where all probabilities $p_k$ are non-zero, for example, the completely depolarizing channel where $p_k = 1/d^2$ for all $k = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1$. For this channel, it can be shown that the linear map corresponding to the complementary channel has a trivial kernel (only the zero matrix is mapped to zero).\n\nBy the rank-nullity theorem from linear algebra, the rank of a linear map is equal to the dimension of its domain minus the dimension of its kernel. Since the domain has a dimension of $d^2$ and the kernel has a dimension of 0 for this specific channel, the rank of the complementary channel is $d^2 - 0 = d^2$.\n\nSince the rank of the complementary channel cannot exceed $d^2$ and we have found an instance where it equals $d^2$, the maximal rank is indeed $d^2$.\n\n"
