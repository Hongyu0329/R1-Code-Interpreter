    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" is not related to a bus scene. The film is Quentin Tarantino's 2009 war film, *Inglourious Basterds*.\n\nThe pivotal scene does not involve a bus, but rather takes place in a tavern. An undercover British officer, Lieutenant Archie Hicox, gives himself away to a suspicious Gestapo Major by ordering three glasses using the wrong hand gesture. When the waitress brings the drinks, he says, \"Thank you.\" This seemingly innocuous phrase, spoken with his distinct British accent, confirms the Major's suspicions and leads to a violent confrontation that results in the deaths of several characters.\n\n*Inglourious Basterds* was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director for Quentin Tarantino, and Best Original Screenplay. Christoph Waltz, for his portrayal of the cunning SS Colonel Hans Landa, won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nWhile the user's query mentions a bus, the core elements of an Oscar-nominated film and a character's fate being sealed by saying \"Thank you\" point directly to this iconic scene in *Inglourious Basterds*.\n\n<<<Inglourious Basterds>>>"
