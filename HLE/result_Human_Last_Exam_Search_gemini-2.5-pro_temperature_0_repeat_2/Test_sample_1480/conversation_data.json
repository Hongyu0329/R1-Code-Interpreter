    "The rule activation level in a fuzzy system is calculated by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the rule's antecedent and the membership degree of the rule's consequent. A t-norm is a type of binary operation that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation in fuzzy logic.\n\nGiven:\n*   The firing strength of the antecedent, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   The membership degree of the consequent, `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe calculation of the rule activation level depends on the specific t-norm used. The two most common t-norms are the minimum t-norm and the product t-norm.\n\n1.  **Minimum t-norm (Gödel t-norm):** This t-norm takes the minimum of the two values.\n    Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n2.  **Product t-norm:** This t-norm takes the product of the two values.\n    Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not provided in the question, the answer can vary. However, the minimum t-norm is a very common choice in fuzzy systems. Assuming the use of the minimum t-norm, the rule activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
