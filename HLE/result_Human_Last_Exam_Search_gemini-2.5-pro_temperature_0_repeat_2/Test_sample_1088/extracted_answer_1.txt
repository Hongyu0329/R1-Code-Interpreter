The number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set is not a fixed number, but is calculated on an atom-by-atom basis. For a hydrogen atom, there are 8 primitive Gaussians. For a second-row heavy atom like carbon or oxygen, there are 32 primitive Gaussians. The total for a molecule is the sum of the primitives for all of its constituent atoms.
