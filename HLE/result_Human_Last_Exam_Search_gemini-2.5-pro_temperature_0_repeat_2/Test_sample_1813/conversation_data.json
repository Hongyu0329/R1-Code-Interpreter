    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to understand that in this context, the generalized Markov numbers, denoted as \\( m_{p/q} \\), are indexed by rational numbers. The properties and the computation of a specific number \\( m_{p/q} \\) are intrinsically linked to the continued fraction of the rational number \\( p/q \\). Therefore, the \"continued fraction associated with \\( m_{4/7} \\)\" is the continued fraction of 4/7.\n\nWe can compute the continued fraction of 4/7 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n\nLet \\( x_0 = 4/7 \\).\nThe integer part is \\( a_0 = \\lfloor 4/7 \\rfloor = 0 \\).\nThe remainder is \\( x_0 - a_0 = 4/7 \\).\n\nNow we take the reciprocal of the remainder:\n\\( x_1 = 1 / (4/7) = 7/4 \\).\nThe integer part is \\( a_1 = \\lfloor 7/4 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\nThe remainder is \\( 7/4 - 1 = 3/4 \\).\n\nTake the reciprocal of the new remainder:\n\\( x_2 = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3 \\).\nThe integer part is \\( a_2 = \\lfloor 4/3 \\rfloor = 1 \\).\nThe remainder is \\( 4/3 - 1 = 1/3 \\).\n\nTake the reciprocal of the final remainder:\n\\( x_3 = 1 / (1/3) = 3 \\).\nThe integer part is \\( a_3 = \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3 \\).\nThe remainder is \\( 3 - 3 = 0 \\), so the process terminates.\n\nThe coefficients of the continued fraction are the integer parts we found: \\( a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3 \\).\nThus, the continued fraction of 4/7 is [0; 1, 1, 3].\n\nWe can verify this:\n\\( [0; 1, 1, 3] = 0 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{4/3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3/4} = \\frac{1}{7/4} = 4/7 \\).\n\n<<<[0; 1, 1, 3]>>>"
