    "A category with a single object is equivalent to a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, determining the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms is the same as finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order three.\n\nA detailed analysis of the possible structures of a monoid with three elements reveals there are 8 distinct non-isomorphic monoids. Let the three elements be the identity `e`, `a`, and `b`. The structure is determined by the multiplication table for these elements, which must satisfy the associative property.\n\nThe 8 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 3, C₃**: Every element is invertible.\n2.  **The right-zero semigroup with an identity adjoined**: This monoid is defined by the relations a²=a, b²=b, ab=b, ba=a. It is non-commutative.\n3.  **The left-zero semigroup with an identity adjoined**: This is the dual of the previous monoid, with relations a²=a, b²=b, ab=a, ba=b. It is also non-commutative.\n4.  **A commutative monoid with a zero element `z` and an element `g` of order two (g²=e)**: The relations are z²=z, g²=e, zg=gz=z.\n5.  **A null semigroup with an identity adjoined**: This is a commutative monoid with a zero element `z` and another element `g` such that g²=z.\n6.  **A semilattice with an identity adjoined**: This is a commutative monoid where one element `z` is a zero, and the other non-identity element `g` is idempotent (g²=g).\n7.  **A commutative monoid where one non-identity element `a` is idempotent (a²=a) and the other `b` satisfies b²=e**: The composition is defined by ab=ba=b.\n8.  **A commutative monoid where one non-identity element `a` is idempotent (a²=a) and the other `b` satisfies b²=a**: The composition is defined by ab=ba=b.\n\nWhile some older resources and online encyclopedias have claimed there are 7, 11, or 12 such monoids, these figures often result from including structures with one-sided identities (which do not form a category in the standard sense) or contain errors in their listings. A systematic construction and check for associativity confirms there are precisely 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
