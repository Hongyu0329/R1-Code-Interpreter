    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nThe term \"nanocar\" refers to a class of molecules designed to resemble a car, typically with a chassis and four wheel-like structures. Several different nanocar structures exist, but a 2021 computational study on a flexible nanocar with four C60 fullerene wheels reported its chemical formula as C310H34.\n\nThe prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon-based molecule have been replaced by fluorine atoms. Therefore, to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, the 34 hydrogen atoms in the C310H34 structure would be substituted with fluorine atoms. This would result in a molecule with the formula C310F34, containing 34 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<34>>>"
