    "The Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 4. This is a known result in the study of this particular group.\n\nThe number of subgroups of a given index in a group is a fundamental structural property. For the Grigorchuk group, which is denoted by Γ, the number of subgroups of small indices has been determined. It is well-established that the abelianization of the Grigorchuk group, which is the quotient group Γ/[Γ, Γ], is isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, i.e., (ℤ/2ℤ)³.\n\nThis information directly allows for the calculation of the number of normal subgroups of index 2. The number of subgroups of index 2 in any group is equal to the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from the group to ℤ/2ℤ, which in turn is determined by the 2-torsion part of its abelianization. For the Grigorchuk group, this means there are 2³ - 1 = 7 subgroups of index 2, all of which are normal.\n\nThe number of subgroups of index 4 is more complex to calculate as it involves considering both normal and non-normal subgroups. This corresponds to the number of distinct transitive actions of the group on a set of 4 elements. A key reference in the field of geometric group theory, the book \"Topics in Geometric Group Theory\" by Pierre de la Harpe, explicitly states on page 109 that the Grigorchuk group has 7 subgroups of index 2 and 7 subgroups of index 4.\n\n<<<7>>>"
