    "Based on scientific records, adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies) have a diet that includes both predatory and supplementary food sources.\n\n*   **Predation:** Adult snakeflies are well-documented as carnivorous predators. Their diet consists of soft-bodied arthropods, and they show a distinct preference for aphids. Therefore, feeding on aphids, such as Totara Aphids, is consistent with their known predatory behavior.\n*   **Nectar and Pollen:** In addition to predation, adult snakeflies have been observed feeding on other substances. Some species feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew. Pollen has been found in their guts, and they have been reported to take nectar.\n*   **Other Substances:** There is no scientific literature suggesting that adult snakeflies feed on fungus or leaf tissue like that of the Karamū. Their mouthparts are adapted for chewing and predation, not for consuming foliage.\n\nGiven the options, Raphidiopterans have been recorded feeding on both nectar and aphids.\n\n<<<F>>>"
