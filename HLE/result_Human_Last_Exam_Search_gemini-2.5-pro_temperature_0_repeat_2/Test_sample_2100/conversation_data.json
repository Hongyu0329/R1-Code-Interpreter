    "Andrei Voznesensky's poem and the subsequent rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" immortalized the story of the Russian nobleman and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. The production, which premiered in the early 1980s, sparked renewed interest in his life and his tragic romance with Concepci처n Arg체ello, the daughter of the Spanish governor of California.\n\nRezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, in 1807 while on his way to St. Petersburg to seek permission from the Tsar to marry Concepci처n. His original gravesite was destroyed during the Soviet era. The question posed by Voznesensky, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", reflects this loss.\n\nThe answer to the poet's question began to emerge in the public consciousness following the popularization of Rezanov's story through the rock opera. This cultural revival in the 1980s led to efforts to find and properly commemorate his final resting place. In 2000, a new memorial cross was erected at the Trinity Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk, believed to be his burial site. In a symbolic reunion, soil from Concepci처n's grave in California was brought to his new memorial. The cross is inscribed with lines from a song in \"Juno and Avos\": \"I will never forget you\" and \"I will never see you again.\"\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
