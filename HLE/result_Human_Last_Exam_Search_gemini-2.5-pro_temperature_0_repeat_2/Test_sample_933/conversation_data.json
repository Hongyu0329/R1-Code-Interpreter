    "The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) is typically achieved through the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F2) gases at an elevated temperature. The first successful synthesis was reported in 1962.\n\nFor an efficient production of XeF4, a mixture of xenon and fluorine, usually in a 1:5 molar ratio, is heated in a nickel vessel. The reaction is carried out at a temperature of 400°C (673 K) and a pressure of 5-6 atmospheres. The nickel container is used because it forms a protective, non-reactive layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its surface. While the reaction can occur between 350°C and 450°C, the preferred temperature is approximately 400°C.\n\nLower temperatures and low fluorine concentration tend to favor the production of xenon difluoride (XeF2), whereas higher temperatures and an excess of fluorine favor xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). Although other methods like electric discharge or photochemical synthesis exist, heating to 400°C is the common and efficient method for producing XeF4.\n\nBased on the provided options, 400°C is the most suitable temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
