    "I am unable to determine the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of Don Quixote with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008.\n\nWhile it is widely documented that Natalia Osipova danced the role of Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet in 2008, and her performances are praised for their technical brilliance, including \"multiple pirouettes,\" specific details about the choreography of her Act I variation are not readily available in the search results. Several links that might have contained a video of the performance are no longer active.\n\nMentions of her performances from that period often highlight her remarkable turning ability and \"dizzying series of revolutions,\" but do not provide a precise count of the pirouettes in question. Without a viewable copy of the 2008 performance or a detailed choreographic record, it is impossible to provide a definitive number.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide an answer to the question.>>>"
