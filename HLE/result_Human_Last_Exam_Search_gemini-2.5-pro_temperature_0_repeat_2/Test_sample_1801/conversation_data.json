    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were the physicist **Murray Gell-Mann** and the economist **Amartya Sen**.\n\nMurray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, was identified in online discussions about the commercials. The \"Ask Why\" campaign also featured Amartya Sen, an Indian economist and philosopher who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1998 for his contributions to welfare economics.\n\nThe Enron commercials were part of a major advertising campaign that aimed to portray the company as innovative and a leader in the \"new economy.\" The inclusion of distinguished academics like Nobel laureates was intended to lend an air of intellectual credibility and gravitas to Enron's brand. The campaign's tagline, \"Ask Why,\" would later become a subject of bitter irony following the company's scandalous collapse in 2001 due to massive accounting fraud.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Amartya Sen>>>"
