    "The ground state degeneracy of the toric code is a topological property that depends on the genus of the surface and the number and type of boundaries (holes). The degeneracy is given by 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n\nLet's analyze the number of logical qubits for a toric code on a sphere (a surface with genus g=0) with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n1.  **Types of Boundaries and Anyons:** The toric code has two types of elementary excitations, often called anyons: electric charges ('e' particles) and magnetic fluxes ('m' particles).\n    *   **Smooth boundaries** are boundaries where magnetic fluxes ('m' particles) can terminate (or condense).\n    *   **Rough boundaries** are boundaries where electric charges ('e' particles) can terminate (or condense).\n\n2.  **Logical Operators:** The degenerate ground states are distinguished by the action of logical operators, which are non-local operators that commute with the Hamiltonian. For each logical qubit, there is a pair of logical operators, typically denoted as a logical X and a logical Z, that anticommute with each other but commute with all other pairs of logical operators.\n    *   A logical X operator is a string of Pauli-X operators. Such a string creates 'e' particles at its endpoints.\n    *   A logical Z operator is a string of Pauli-Z operators. Such a string creates 'm' particles at its endpoints.\n\n3.  **Logical Operators and Holes:** For a surface with holes, there are two types of logical operators:\n    *   **String operators:** These are strings of Pauli operators that connect two boundaries of the same type. For example, a logical X operator can be a string connecting two rough boundaries.\n    *   **Loop operators:** These are closed loops of Pauli operators that encircle one or more holes.\n\n4.  **Counting Logical Qubits:** A common result for the number of logical qubits (k) on a surface with genus g and d boundaries is given by the formula k = 2g + d - 1. For a sphere, the genus g=0. The number of boundaries (d) is the total number of holes, so d = n + m. This would give k = n + m - 1, leading to a degeneracy of 2^(n+m-1). However, this formula often assumes all boundaries are of the same type and does not fully account for the distinct nature of smooth and rough boundaries.\n\n5.  **An Alternative and Widely Cited Result:** A key insight from the work of Bravyi and Kitaev is that for a planar code (which can be viewed as a sphere with at least one hole), each hole contributes one logical qubit to the system. For each hole, one can define a pair of loop operators (one of X-type and one of Z-type) that encircle the hole and anticommute with each other. This pair of operators acts as the logical X and Z for one qubit.\n\n    *   With n smooth holes and m rough holes, the total number of holes is n + m.\n    *   Each of these n + m holes provides an independent logical qubit.\n    *   Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is k = n + m.\n\n6.  **Calculating the Degeneracy:** The ground space degeneracy is 2 raised to the power of the number of logical qubits.\n    *   Degeneracy = 2^k = 2^(n+m).\n\nThis result is consistent for the case of a sphere with no holes (n=0, m=0), where the degeneracy is 2^0 = 1, which is the known result for a sphere.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the ground space degeneracy of the toric code with n smooth holes and m rough holes is 2^(n+m).\n\n<<<A>>>"
