    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, one can use a method analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers. This involves forming a stacked matrix and reducing it using elementary row operations.\n\nThe given matrices are:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nWe form a composite matrix M by stacking P1 and P2:\nM = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n     [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\nThe goal is to simplify this matrix using elementary row operations, which are:\n1. Swapping two rows.\n2. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\nThe GCRD is given by the non-zero rows of the resulting row-echelon form of M.\n\nThe row reduction proceeds as follows:\n1.  Swap row 1 and row 3.\n2.  Replace row 2 with (row 2 + s * row 1), row 3 with (row 3 - (s+1) * row 1), and row 4 with (row 4 + row 1). This yields:\n    [[s, 0],\n     [-1, s^2],\n     [0, -s],\n     [-1, 1]]\n\n3.  Swap row 1 and row 2, and multiply the new row 1 by -1.\n4.  Replace row 2 with (row 2 - s * row 1) and row 4 with (row 4 + row 1). This gives:\n    [[1, -s^2],\n     [0, s^3],\n     [0, -s],\n     [0, 1 - s^2]]\n\n5.  Now, focusing on the last three rows, we can perform further operations. Replace row 2 with (row 2 + s^2 * row 3):\n    [[1, -s^2],\n    ,\n     [0, -s],\n     [0, 1 - s^2]]\n\n6.  Replace row 4 with (row 4 - s * row 3):\n    [[1, -s^2],\n    ,\n     [0, -s],\n    ]\n\n7.  Finally, use the last row to eliminate the s-terms in the other rows. Replace row 1 with (row 1 + s^2 * row 4) and row 3 with (row 3 + s * row 4):\n    [,\n    ,\n    ,\n    ]\n\nThe non-zero rows of the reduced matrix are and. These rows form the GCRD.\n\nThus, the greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix. When the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
