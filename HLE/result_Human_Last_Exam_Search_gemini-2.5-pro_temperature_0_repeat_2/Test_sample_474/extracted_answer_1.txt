The approach is not valid because the ecological function of *Bombus* mimicry is to deter avian predators, whose visual system (including UV perception) is fundamentally different from that of humans. Clustering based on human visual similarity fails to capture the sensory experience of the actual selective agent, making the results ecologically irrelevant.
