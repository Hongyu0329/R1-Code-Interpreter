    "Let $L = 1 - 10^{-M}$. The problem states that for any choice of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{100000}$ in the interval $$, there must exist a sequence of real numbers $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{100000}$ within the interval $[-L, L]$ that satisfies the condition $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ for all $1 \\le i \\le 100000$.\n\nThe condition $|x_{i-1} - x_i| = a_i$ is equivalent to $x_i = x_{i-1} \\pm a_i$. By repeatedly applying this relation, we can express any $x_k$ in terms of the starting point $x_0$ and the given $a_i$ values:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i a_i$, where each $\\sigma_i$ is either $+1$ or $-1$.\n\nFor a solution to exist, we must be able to find an initial value $x_0 \\in [-L, L]$ and a sequence of signs $\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_{100000}$ such that every resulting $x_k$ (for $k=1, \\dots, 100000$) also lies in the interval $[-L, L]$.\n\nLet $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sigma_i a_i$ be the partial sum, with $S_0 = 0$. The condition on the sequence is that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 100000\\}$, we must have $x_k = x_0 + S_k \\in [-L, L]$. This is equivalent to requiring that the chosen $x_0$ must satisfy:\n$-L - S_k \\le x_0 \\le L - S_k$ for all $k$.\n\nTo satisfy this for all $k$ simultaneously, $x_0$ must lie in the intersection of all these intervals. Let $S_{min} = \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ and $S_{max} = \\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$. The condition for $x_0$ becomes:\n$-L - S_{min} \\le x_0 \\le L - S_{max}$.\n\nFor such an $x_0$ to exist, the upper bound must be greater than or equal to the lower bound:\n$L - S_{max} \\ge -L - S_{min}$, which simplifies to $S_{max} - S_{min} \\le 2L$.\n\nThis inequality represents the required \"span\" of the partial sums. The problem requires that for any sequence of $a_i$, we can find a sequence of signs $\\sigma_i$ that satisfies this condition. This means that the minimum possible span for a given set of $a_i$ must be less than or equal to $2L$. Let $W^*(a) = \\min_{\\sigma} (S_{max} - S_{min})$. The condition on $L$ is:\n$\\sup_{a_i \\in} W^*(a) \\le 2L$.\n\nA crucial result in discrepancy theory states that the minimum span, $W^*(a)$, is achieved by a greedy algorithm (where at each step the sign is chosen to pull the partial sum closer to zero) and that this minimum span is exactly equal to the largest step size, $\\max_i a_i$.\n\nTherefore, the condition becomes:\n$\\sup_{a_i \\in} (\\max_i a_i) \\le 2L$.\n\nSince the values of $a_i$ are in the range $$, the supremum of the largest $a_i$ is 1. This gives the necessary and sufficient condition on $L$:\n$1 \\le 2L$, or $L \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe can also arrive at this condition by considering a specific worst-case scenario. Let $a_1 = 1$ and $a_i = 0$ for all $i \\ge 2$. The conditions on the sequence $x_i$ become:\n*   $|x_0 - x_1| = 1$\n*   $|x_i - x_{i-1}| = 0$ for $i \\ge 2$, which implies $x_1 = x_2 = \\dots = x_{100000}$.\n\nWe need to find $x_0, x_1 \\in [-L, L]$ such that $|x_0 - x_1| = 1$. This requires that there is an $x_0 \\in [-L, L]$ for which either $x_0+1$ or $x_0-1$ is also in $[-L, L]$.\n1.  If we choose $x_1 = x_0+1$, we need to find an $x_0$ in $[-L, L]$ such that $x_0+1 \\in [-L, L]$. This means $x_0 \\in [-L-1, L-1]$. The combined requirement is $x_0 \\in [-L, L] \\cap [-L-1, L-1] = [-L, L-1]$. This interval is non-empty if and only if $-L \\le L-1$, which means $1 \\le 2L$.\n2.  If we choose $x_1 = x_0-1$, we similarly require $x_0 \\in [-L+1, L]$, which is non-empty if and only if $-L+1 \\le L$, which also means $1 \\le 2L$.\n\nBoth cases demonstrate that we must have $L \\ge 1/2$. Now we can find the smallest integer $M$ that satisfies this.\n$L = 1 - 10^{-M} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\frac{1}{2} \\ge 10^{-M}$\nTaking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$\\log_{10}(\\frac{1}{2}) \\ge -M$\n$-\\log_{10}(2) \\ge -M$\n$M \\ge \\log_{10}(2)$\n\nSince $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$, the condition is $M \\ge 0.30103$. As $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $M$ is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
