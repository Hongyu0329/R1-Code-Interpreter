    "To determine the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group on 25 elements, $S_{25}$, with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we need to identify all integer partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep satisfies this condition.\n\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. The dimension of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the hook length formula. For a partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, the dimension $d_\\lambda$ is:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j) \\in \\lambda} h_{i,j}}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{i,j}$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$.\n\nThe dimensions of the irreps corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate $\\lambda'$ are identical. A partition is self-conjugate if $\\lambda = \\lambda'$. For non-self-conjugate partitions, a single dimension value corresponds to at least two different irreps.\n\nBy systematically calculating the dimensions for the partitions of 25, we can identify those that are less than 500,000. The partitions with the smallest dimensions are typically those that are \"long and thin,\" meaning they have a few large parts or many small parts. These correspond to partitions near the \"edges\" of the Young's lattice of partitions.\n\nThe following is a list of the partitions of 25 that result in an irrep dimension of less than 500,000, along with their dimensions. For each partition listed, its conjugate partition also corresponds to an irrep of the same dimension and is distinct (none of the listed partitions are self-conjugate).\n\n*   **Dimension 1:**\n    *   Partitions: (25) and its conjugate (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1) or $(1^{25})$.

Since for each such partition $\\lambda$, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ is different and yields an irrep of the same dimension, we have $34 \\times 2 = 68$ such irreducible representations in total.\n\n<<<68>>>"
