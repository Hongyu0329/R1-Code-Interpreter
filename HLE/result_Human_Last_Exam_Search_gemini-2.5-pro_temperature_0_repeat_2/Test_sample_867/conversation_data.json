    "Despite extensive research, a definitive video of the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre \"Swan Lake\" production choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich featuring Svetlana Zakharova that is accessible for a precise count of the *sissone fermes* in the Act II Odette variation could not be located and analyzed.\n\nWhile multiple sources confirm that Svetlana Zakharova performed the dual roles of Odette and Odile in the specified production, and reviews from the time praise her technical prowess, a visual confirmation and count of the specific ballet step is not possible without access to a complete and verifiable video of the performance.\n\nSeveral links to videos of the performance were discovered during the search; however, these were either unavailable, short clips not containing the full variation, or from different productions. A promising lead to a high-quality recording on Medici.tv could not be accessed to perform the analysis.\n\nTherefore, a precise number of *sissone fermes* performed by Zakharova in the Act II Odette variation of the 2014 Grigorovich production cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific count of the sissone fermes as I cannot watch the video of the performance.>>>"
