    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the first-order logic fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ with a schema $S$ containing 4 unary predicates is 4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of this result:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Concept Class\nFirst, we need to identify the class of concepts defined by the logic. A concept is a set of elements from a universe that satisfy a given formula with one free variable, let's call it $x$.\n\nThe logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas built from:\n*   **Atomic predicates**: The schema $S$ provides 4 unary predicates, let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x),$ and $P_4(x)$.\n*   **Logical connectives**: Only conjunction ($\\land$) and the constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$) are permitted.\n*   **Quantifiers**: Only the existential quantifier ($\\exists$) is allowed.\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in this logic can be written in the general form:\n$\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_k (\\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_k))$\nwhere $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas. Since all predicates are unary, these atomic formulas are of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is one of the variables $\\{x, y_1, \\dots, y_k\\}$.\n\nWe can separate the atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$ from those that only involve the existentially quantified variables $\\vec{y} = (y_1, \\dots, y_k)$:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\left( \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x) \\right) \\land \\left( \\exists \\vec{y} . \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} Q_j(\\vec{y}) \\right)$\nwhere $I$ is some subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and $Q_j(\\vec{y})$ are atomic formulas involving only variables from $\\vec{y}$.\n\nThe second part of the formula, $\\exists \\vec{y} . \\bigwedge_{j \\in J} Q_j(\\vec{y})$, is a sentence (it has no free variables). For any given model (a universe with interpretations for the predicates), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If the sentence is false, the entire formula $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, defining the empty set ($\\emptyset$).\n*   If the sentence is true, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$.\n\nTherefore, the concepts definable by this logic are sets formed by the intersection of the extensions of the predicates. Let $S_i$ be the set of elements for which $P_i(x)$ is true. The definable concepts are of the form $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} S_i$ for any subset $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. This collection of concepts is known as the class of \"monotone monomials\" over the 4 predicates.\n\n### 2. Calculating the VC Dimension\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the concept class. A set is shattered if for every one of its subsets, there is a concept in the class that isolates exactly that subset.\n\nThe VC dimension of a concept class defined by all possible conjunctions of $d$ base predicates (monotone monomials) is known to be $d$. In this case, we have $d=4$ predicates.\n\n**Part 1: Showing the VC dimension is at least 4 (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)**\n\nTo prove this, we must find a set of 4 points that can be shattered.\nLet the set of points be $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$. We need to define the interpretations of our four predicates, $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$, in such a way that for any subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can find a concept that equals $Y$.\n\nLet's define the predicate extensions as follows:\n*   $S_1 = \\{x_2, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_2 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_3 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_4\\}$\n*   $S_4 = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$\n\nIn general, $S_i = X \\setminus \\{x_i\\}$. Now, for any desired subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can construct it by taking the intersection of the appropriate $S_i$. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid x_i \\notin Y\\}$. The corresponding concept is $C_Y = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_Y} S_i$. This intersection results in exactly the set $Y$.\n\nFor example, to obtain the subset $Y = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$, we see that $x_2 \\notin Y$ and $x_4 \\notin Y$. So we choose the concept $C = S_2 \\cap S_4 = \\{x_1, x_3, x_4\\} \\cap \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{x_1, x_3\\}$.\n\nSince we can form any of the $2^4 = 16$ subsets of $X$, the set $X$ is shattered. This proves that the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Part 2: Showing the VC dimension is at most 4 (VC-dim $\\le 4$)**\n\nThe number of distinct concepts is limited by the number of ways we can form a conjunction of the 4 predicates. For each predicate, we can either include it in the conjunction or not. This gives $2^4 = 16$ possible conjunctions (including the empty conjunction, which represents the whole universe, and potentially contradictory conjunctions that represent the empty set).\n\nTo shatter a set of size $k$, a concept class must be able to generate all $2^k$ possible subsets.\n*   To shatter a set of size 4, we need to generate $2^4 = 16$ subsets. As shown above, this is possible.\n*   To shatter a set of size 5, we would need to generate $2^5 = 32$ subsets.\n\nHowever, our concept class contains at most 16 distinct concepts. Since $16 < 32$, it is impossible to generate all 32 subsets of a 5-element set. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered, which implies that the VC dimension is at most 4.\n\nCombining both parts, we have VC-dim $\\ge 4$ and VC-dim $\\le 4$. Thus, the VC dimension is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
