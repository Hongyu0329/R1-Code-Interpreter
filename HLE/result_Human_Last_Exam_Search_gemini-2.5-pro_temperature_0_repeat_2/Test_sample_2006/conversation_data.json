    "I will begin by deciphering the haiku to understand the historical event it describes. The lines \"An August tempest,\" \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change,\" and \"A divine one yields\" point toward a significant event in August. \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30, and \"a divine one yields\" likely refers to a monarch or emperor. I will search for major historical events in August involving the number 30 and the surrender or yielding of a divine-right ruler. The title, \"The Bays,\" posed as a question, combined with the instruction for the answer to be in alphabetical order, will be the final clue to solve.The haiku \"The Bays\" provides a series of clues pointing to a significant historical event.\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This line suggests a period of great turmoil in August.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. This points to August 30th as a day of significant change. On August 30, 1945, General Douglas MacArthur landed at Atsugi Air Force Base in Japan to begin the Allied occupation, a pivotal moment that brought immense change to the nation.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This refers to the Japanese Emperor, who was considered a divine figure. Emperor Hirohito's decision to surrender to the Allied forces was a monumental event, marking the first time the Japanese public had ever heard their emperor's voice. His acceptance of the surrender terms meant yielding his authority to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers.\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is presented as a question. The historical context of Japan's surrender at the end of World War II provides the answer. The formal surrender ceremony took place on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri, which was anchored in Tokyo Bay. The Allied fleet had gathered in the adjoining Sagami Bay before the ceremony.\n\nThe final instruction is that the answer should be in alphabetical order. Therefore, the answer is the names of these two bays, alphabetized.\n\n<<<Sagami, Tokyo>>>"
