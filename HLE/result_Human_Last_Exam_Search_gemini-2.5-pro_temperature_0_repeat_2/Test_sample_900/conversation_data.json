    "It is not possible to provide a specific number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for a few key reasons.\n\nThe term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized step within the standard lexicon of ballet terminology. While George Balanchine developed a distinct style and choreographed many steps, there isn't a specific movement universally known as the \"pas de Balanchine.\" The term does appear colloquially in places like social media, often referring to a particular combination of steps given in a class.\n\nWilliam Forsythe's choreographic style was influenced by Balanchine, which may be the source of the query. His work, including \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" is known for extending and manipulating classical ballet technique. Dancers in this piece perform complex and demanding movements, and Svetlana Gileva was noted for her performances with the Semperoper Ballett in this role.\n\nA video of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman\" solo with the Semperoper Ballett from 2015 is listed on YouTube, but the content is currently unavailable. Without a visual record of the specific performance and a clear definition of what a \"pas de Balanchine\" would be in this context, a count of the step is impossible.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a number as \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a recognized ballet step and video of the specific performance is unavailable for analysis.>>>"
