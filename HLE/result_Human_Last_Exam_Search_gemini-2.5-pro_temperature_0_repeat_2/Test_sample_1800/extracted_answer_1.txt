The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value and depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a range of 7 to 12.5 wt % nickel has shown high activity. For water splitting, optimal ratios vary for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with studies pointing towards Ni/Ce molar ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 for OER and 1:2 for HER as being highly effective.
