    "### Optimal Ni/Ce Ratio in Nanoparticles Varies for Water Gas Shift and Water Splitting Reactions\n\nThe ideal nickel-to-cerium (Ni/Ce) ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for maximizing catalytic performance is not a single universal value but rather depends on the specific application, whether it be the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction or water splitting. Research indicates that different ratios are optimal for each process, and even within water splitting, the ideal ratio can differ for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).\n\n**For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction**, a range of Ni concentrations has been shown to be effective. One study investigating Ni/CeO₂ catalysts found that those with 10 and 12.5 weight percent (wt %) of nickel exhibited high carbon monoxide (CO) conversion rates of 94.7% and 95.3%, respectively, at 400°C. There was no significant difference in the initial reaction temperature for catalysts with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt %. Another study, focused on the reverse WGS reaction, identified an optimal nickel proportion of around 7% molar. Furthermore, a catalyst with a composition of Ni₀.₂Ce₀.₈O₂, which translates to a Ni/Ce molar ratio of 0.25, has also been noted for its catalytic activity.\n\n**In the context of water splitting**, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is also multifaceted. For the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical step in water splitting, Ni-Ceria electrocatalysts with Ni/Ce molar ratios of 75:25 and 50:50 demonstrated enhanced activity. This improved performance is attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, was highlighted for its long-term stability. Conversely, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a different study identified an optimal catalyst with a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2, which corresponds to a Ni/Ce ratio of 0.5. Supporting the idea of a higher nickel content being beneficial, a computational study has suggested that a 3Ni/1Ce ratio (Ni/Ce = 3) provides a more favorable adsorption energy for the water splitting reaction.\n\nIn summary, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio is highly dependent on the target reaction. For the WGS reaction, a nickel content in the range of 7 to 12.5 wt % appears to be effective. For water splitting, a higher nickel content, such as a 3:1 or 1:1 molar ratio (Ni:Ce), seems to be advantageous for the OER, while a ratio of 1:2 is favored for the HER. The selection of the ideal Ni/Ce ratio is therefore a critical parameter that must be tailored to the specific catalytic application.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value and depends on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a range of 7 to 12.5 wt % nickel has shown high activity. For water splitting, optimal ratios vary for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with studies pointing towards Ni/Ce molar ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 for OER and 1:2 for HER as being highly effective.>>>"
