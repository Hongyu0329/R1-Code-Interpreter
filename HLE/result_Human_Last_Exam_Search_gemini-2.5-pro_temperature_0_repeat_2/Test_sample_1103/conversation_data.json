    "In the context of the Gauss class number problem, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with a class number of 48 is 206. This result is based on the comprehensive calculations performed by Mark Watkins, who determined all imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100.\n\nThe Gauss class number problem, in its essence, seeks to classify quadratic number fields by the order of their ideal class group. For imaginary quadratic fields, which are of the form Q(âˆšd) where d is a negative square-free integer, this problem involves providing a complete list of such fields for any given class number. A fundamental discriminant is a key concept in this classification.\n\nThe work by Watkins, published in the journal *Mathematics of Computation* in 2004, provides a definitive table listing the count of negative fundamental discriminants for each class number up to 100. According to this extensive work, there are precisely 206 distinct negative fundamental discriminants that result in an imaginary quadratic field with a class number of 48.\n\n<<<206>>>"
