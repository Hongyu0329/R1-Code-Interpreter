The analytical expression for the initial magnetization curve is given by:

*   **For 0 ≤ H ≤ a * Jc:**
    M(H) = -H + H² / (2 * a * Jc)

*   **For H > a * Jc:**
    M(H) = - (a * Jc) / 2

where:
*   **M** is the magnetization.
*   **H** is the applied magnetic field.
*   **a** is half the width of the bar in the x-direction.
*   **Jc** is the constant critical-current density.
