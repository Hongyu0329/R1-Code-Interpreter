    "I am unable to provide a precise count of the entrelacés performed by Natalia Osipova in her debut as Nikiya in the Bolshoi Ballet's 2009 production of *La Bayadère*.\n\nWhile video recordings of this specific performance are available online and have been the subject of general discussion among ballet enthusiasts, a detailed choreographic analysis or a step-by-step breakdown that quantifies the number of entrelacés is not present in the search results. Reviews and articles about Osipova's debut focus on her interpretation and dramatic portrayal of the character rather than providing a technical count of specific ballet movements. Without the ability to directly view and analyze the video footage, a definitive number cannot be ascertained.\n\nNatalia Osipova's debut in the role of Nikiya at the Bolshoi Theatre in 2009 was a significant event in her career. At the time, she was a leading soloist and would be promoted to principal dancer the following year. Her performance in *La Bayadère*, and specifically in the \"Death of Nikiya\" scene, has been noted for its emotional depth and technical skill. However, the exact choreographic details, including the precise number of specific steps like entrelacés, are not documented in the available written resources.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the answer.>>>"
