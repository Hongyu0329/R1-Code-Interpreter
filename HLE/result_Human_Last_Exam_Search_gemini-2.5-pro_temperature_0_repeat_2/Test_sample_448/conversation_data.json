    "## Radon Was the Rarest Noble Gas on Earth in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the rarest naturally occurring noble gas as a percentage of all terrestrial matter was **Radon (Rn)**. This conclusion is based on its extremely low abundance in the Earth's crust and its very short half-life, which prevents it from accumulating in any significant quantity.\n\nOganesson (Og), though technically a noble gas, is a synthetic element that does not occur naturally on Earth and was first synthesized in 2002. Therefore, it is not considered in the context of naturally occurring terrestrial matter.\n\nThe abundance of noble gases generally decreases with increasing atomic number, with the notable exception of argon. Argon (Ar) is significantly more abundant than neon (Ne), helium (He), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe) due to the radioactive decay of potassium-40, a relatively common isotope in the Earth's crust. The atmospheric concentrations of the stable noble gases are approximately:\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** 0.934%\n*   **Neon (Ne):** 0.0018%\n*   **Helium (He):** 0.00052%\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** 0.00011%\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** 0.000009%\n\nWhile the atmosphere constitutes a significant reservoir of noble gases, a complete picture of their terrestrial abundance must include the crust, mantle, and core. Helium and argon have significant sources within the Earth's crust and mantle due to the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium. There is also evidence to suggest that a portion of Earth's xenon may be trapped within crustal minerals, a phenomenon known as the \"missing xenon problem\".\n\nDespite the complexities of noble gas distribution throughout the Earth's different layers, the extreme rarity of radon is evident. Its abundance in the Earth's crust is estimated to be a mere 4 x 10⁻¹³ milligrams per kilogram. For comparison, a typical concentration for xenon in terrestrial rock is around 10⁻¹¹ cm³/g, which equates to approximately 5.4 x 10⁻⁸ mg/kg, a value several orders of magnitude greater than that of radon.\n\nRadon's scarcity is a direct result of its radioactivity; its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days. This rapid decay means that it exists only transiently in the environment, produced from the decay of uranium and thorium in rocks and soils. The scientific understanding of noble gas geochemistry, including their abundances in various terrestrial reservoirs, was well-established by 2002, with seminal works by researchers such as Ozima, Podosek, and Ballentine providing the foundational data and models.\n\nTherefore, based on its exceedingly low concentration in the Earth's crust and its inherent instability, radon was unequivocally the rarest noble gas as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
