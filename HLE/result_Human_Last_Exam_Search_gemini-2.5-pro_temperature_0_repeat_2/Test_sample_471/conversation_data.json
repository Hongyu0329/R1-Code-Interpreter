    "The minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$) is determined by the topology of the torus, a result explained by Morse theory.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result:\n\n1.  **Topological Invariants (Betti Numbers)**: The first step is to understand the topological structure of the 2-torus through its Betti numbers ($b_k$), which intuitively count the number of \"holes\" of each dimension.\n    *   $b_0(T^2) = 1$, because the torus has one connected component.\n    *   $b_1(T^2) = 2$, because it has two independent one-dimensional \"circular\" holes (one along the \"longitude\" and one along the \"latitude\").\n    *   $b_2(T^2) = 1$, because the torus encloses a single two-dimensional void or cavity.\n\n2.  **Morse Inequalities**: For any smooth Morse function *f* on a compact manifold *M* (a function whose critical points are all non-degenerate), the number of critical points of index *k*, denoted $m_k$, is related to the Betti numbers by the Morse inequalities:\n    $m_k \\ge b_k(M)$ for all $k \\ge 0$.\n    The index of a critical point is the number of independent directions in which the function decreases. For a surface in 3D space, minima have index 0, saddle points have index 1, and maxima have index 2.\n\n3.  **Applying to the Torus**: For a Morse function on the 2-torus, the inequalities are:\n    *   $m_0 \\ge b_0(T^2) = 1$. There must be at least one minimum.\n    *   $m_1 \\ge b_1(T^2) = 2$. There must be at least two saddle points.\n    *   $m_2 \\ge b_2(T^2) = 1$. There must be at least one maximum.\n\n4.  **Minimal Number of Critical Points**: The total number of critical points, *C*, is the sum $C = m_0 + m_1 + m_2$. Based on the inequalities, the minimum possible number of critical points for a Morse function is:\n    $C \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n    This result for Morse functions extends to all smooth functions. While some smooth functions can have fewer than 4 critical points by having degenerate critical points, the minimum number required by the topology is 3, according to Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory. However, a function with only 3 critical points on a torus cannot satisfy the Poincar√©-Hopf theorem, which relates the sum of indices of a vector field's zeros to the Euler characteristic of the manifold ($\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$). A function with one minimum (index +1), one maximum (index +1), and one saddle (index -1) would give a sum of indices of +1, which contradicts the Euler characteristic of 0. Therefore, a smooth function on a torus must have at least 4 critical points.\n\n5.  **Example Function**: An explicit example of a smooth function on the torus that achieves this minimum is given by considering the torus as the square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with opposite sides identified. The function $f(\\theta, \\phi) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\phi)$ has exactly four critical points:\n    *   One minimum at $(\\pi, \\pi)$.\n    *   One maximum at $(0, 0)$.\n    *   Two saddle points at $(\\pi, 0)$ and $(0, \\pi)$.\n\nThis confirms that the lower bound of 4 is achievable.\n\n<<<4>>>"
