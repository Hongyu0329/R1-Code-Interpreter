    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must first identify all possible valid syntactic structures for an expression of length 5. Then, for each structure, we will count how many combinations of T and F result in a true expression.\n\nThe allowed symbols are:\n*   Values (v): T, F\n*   Binary Operators (op): &, |\n*   Unary Operator: !\n*   Parentheses: (, )\n\nThe precedence of operators is `!` > `&` > `|`. An expression is considered valid if it follows standard syntax rules. We are counting the number of distinct strings that form a true expression.\n\nHere are the possible valid structures of length 5:\n\n### 1. Structure: `v op v op v`\nThis structure consists of 3 values and 2 binary operators, with no parentheses. The length is 3 + 2 = 5. The evaluation order is determined by operator precedence.\n*   **Case 1.1: `v1 & v2 & v3`**\n    This expression is true only if all three values are T.\n    *   `T & T & T`: (1 expression)\n*   **Case 1.2: `v1 | v2 | v3`**\n    This expression is true if at least one value is T. It is false only if all are F. There are 2Â³ = 8 total combinations for the three values.\n    *   True expressions: 8 - 1 (for F|F|F) = 7 expressions.\n*   **Case 1.3: `v1 & v2 | v3`** (Evaluated as `(v1 & v2) | v3`)\n    This is true if `v3` is T (4 combinations for v1, v2), or if `v3` is F and `v1 & v2` is T (which means v1=T, v2=T).\n    *   True expressions: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n*   **Case 1.4: `v1 | v2 & v3`** (Evaluated as `v1 | (v2 & v3)`)\n    This is true if `v1` is T (4 combinations for v2, v3), or if `v1` is F and `v2 & v3` is T (which means v2=T, v3=T).\n    *   True expressions: 4 + 1 = 5 expressions.\n**Total for Structure 1: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18**\n\n### 2. Structure: `(v op v)`\nThis structure has 2 values, 1 operator, and 2 parentheses. The length is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n*   **Case 2.1: `(v1 & v2)`**\n    True only for `(T & T)`. (1 expression)\n*   **Case 2.2: `(v1 | v2)`**\n    True for `(T | T)`, `(T | F)`, and `(F | T)`. (3 expressions)\n**Total for Structure 2: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n### 3. Structure: `!v op !v`\nThis structure has 2 values, 1 binary operator, and 2 unary operators. Due to high precedence of `!`, no parentheses are needed. The length is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.\n*   **Case 3.1: `!v1 & !v2`**\n    True only if `!v1` is T and `!v2` is T, which means `v1` is F and `v2` is F.\n    *   `!F & !F`: (1 expression)\n*   **Case 3.2: `!v1 | !v2`**\n    True unless both `!v1` and `!v2` are F, which means `v1` is T and `v2` is T.\n    *   True for 3 of the 4 value combinations. (3 expressions)\n**Total for Structure 3: 1 + 3 = 4**\n\n### 4. Structure: `v op (v)` and `(v) op v`\nThese structures have 2 values, 1 operator, and 2 parentheses. The length is 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. They are syntactically distinct from each other and from `(v op v)`.\n*   **`v1 op (v2)`**: Logically equivalent to `v1 op v2`.\n    *   `&`: `T & (T)` (1 expression)\n    *   `|`: `T | (T)`, `T | (F)`, `F | (T)` (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 4 expressions.\n*   **`(v1) op v2`**: Logically equivalent to `v1 op v2`.\n    *   `&`: `(T) & T` (1 expression)\n    *   `|`: `(T) | T`, `(T) | F`, `(F) | T` (3 expressions)\n    *   Total: 4 expressions.\n**Total for Structure 4: 4 + 4 = 8**\n\n### 5. Structure: `!(!v)`\nThis structure has 1 value, 2 unary operators, and 2 parentheses. The length is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n*   This expression is logically equivalent to `v`. It is true only when `v` is T.\n    *   `!(!T)`: (1 expression)\n**Total for Structure 5: 1**\n\n### 6. Structure: `((v))`\nThis structure has 1 value and 4 parentheses. The length is 1 + 4 = 5.\n*   This expression is logically equivalent to `v`. It is true only when `v` is T.\n    *   `((T))`: (1 expression)\n**Total for Structure 6: 1**\n\n### Final Calculation\nTo find the total number of true expressions, we sum the counts from all distinct structures:\n*   Structure 1 (`v op v op v`): 18\n*   Structure 2 (`(v op v)`): 4\n*   Structure 3 (`!v op !v`): 4\n*   Structure 4 (`v op (v)` and `(v) op v`): 8\n*   Structure 5 (`!(!v)`): 1\n*   Structure 6 (`((v))`): 1\n\n**Total = 18 + 4 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 36**\n\nThere are 36 distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols.\n\n<<<36>>>"
