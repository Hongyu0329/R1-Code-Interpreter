A tightly secure two-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme can be designed by first selecting a suitable underlying signature scheme like Schnorr or a lattice-based one. A distributed key generation protocol is used to create secret shares for n participants without a trusted dealer. The two-round signing protocol consists of a preprocessing round where participants commit to nonces, often with zero-knowledge proofs to ensure honesty, and a signing round where partial signatures are created using the secret shares and the message. These partial signatures are then aggregated into a single signature. To ensure tight security against malicious adversaries controlling up to t-1 parties, the design must incorporate techniques like homomorphic encryption to protect secret data during computation and provide a formal security proof with a tight reduction to a hard problem like the Discrete Logarithm or Learning with Errors problem. Robustness is achieved through mechanisms that allow the protocol to complete despite malicious attempts to disrupt it
