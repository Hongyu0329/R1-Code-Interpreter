    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hip.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso, with the hips held firmly in place. The bend is initiated from the upper back, and the spine is elongated throughout the movement. The head is typically turned to the side. This creates a sense of lift and control, with the power coming from the back and core muscles.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often features a more dynamic and exaggerated use of the body to create exciting lines. This can include a more released or pushed hip in the cambré derrière. This use of \"déhanché,\" or hip movement, is a characteristic of the Balanchine style. While Balanchine's standard positions might emphasize a straight body, he was known to incorporate a slight cambré back in effacé, suggesting a different application of the torso and hips compared to the strict Vaganova approach. This deviation from a purely classical, squared-off line is a hallmark of his neoclassical style.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement (allongé), speed, the degree of the backbend, and head placement also show variations between the two methods, the deliberate use of the hip to create a specific aesthetic line in the Balanchine style is a fundamental point of difference from the Vaganova method's insistence on a stable and square pelvis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
