    "The probability of finding a particle in a one-dimensional box is determined by its wavefunction. For a box of length 'a', the normalized wavefunction for the n-th energy state is given by:\n\nψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n\nThe probability density, which gives the likelihood of finding the particle at a specific position x, is the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction, |ψn(x)|². For the n=2 energy state, the probability density is:\n\nP(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in the interval from x₁ = 0.495a to x₂ = 0.505a, we must integrate the probability density over this interval:\n\nP(0.495a ≤ x ≤ 0.505a) = ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ᵃ (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx\n\nThe center of this interval is at x = 0.5a, which for the n=2 state is a node—a point where the probability of finding the particle is zero. Because the interval is very small and centered on this node, we expect the probability to be very low.\n\nTo solve the integral, we can use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2:\n\nP = (1/a) ∫₀.₄₉₅ₐ⁰.⁵⁰⁵ᵃ (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx\n\nEvaluating this integral gives:\n\nP = (1/a) * [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] from 0.495a to 0.505a\n\nPlugging in the limits of integration:\n\nP = (1/a) * [(0.505a - (a/4π)sin(2.02π)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(1.98π))]\nP = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]\n\nUsing the properties of the sine function, this simplifies to:\n\nP = 0.01 - (1/2π) * sin(0.02π)\n\nAn alternative approach for such a small interval around a node is to use an approximation. Near the node at x = a/2, the sine function is approximately linear. Let y = x - a/2. The integrand becomes approximately (2/a) * (2πy/a)². Integrating this simplified function over the corresponding interval for y (from -0.005a to 0.005a) yields:\n\nP ≈ (16π²/3) * (0.005)³\n\nBoth the exact integration and the approximation method give the same result.\n\n<<<6.58 x 10⁻⁶>>>"
