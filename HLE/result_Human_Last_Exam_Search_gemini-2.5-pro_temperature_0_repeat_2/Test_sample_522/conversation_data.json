    "This puzzle involves a transformation rule applied to a grid of numbers. Let's deduce the rule from the given examples.\n\n### Analysis of the Transformation Rule\n\n1.  **Identify the Active Cell**: In both `Input_A` and `Input_B`, the grid contains a single digit '2'. The changes in the output grids revolve around this '2'. This suggests the '2' is the trigger for the transformation.\n\n2.  **Behavior of the '2'**:\n    *   In `Input_A`, the '2' at position (1, 1) is replaced by a '0' in `Output_A`. (Using 0-based indexing for rows and columns).\n    *   In `Input_B`, the '2' at position (3, 6) is replaced by a '0' in `Output_B`.\n    *   **Rule 1**: The cell containing the '2' is changed to '0'.\n\n3.  **The \"Movement\" of the '2'**:\n    *   In `Input_A`, a '0' at position (0, 0) becomes a '2'.\n    *   In `Input_B`, a '0' at position (2, 7) becomes a '2'.\n    *   **Rule 2**: The '2' effectively \"moves\" to a new position that originally contained a '0'. All other cells in the grid remain unchanged.\n\n4.  **Determining the Destination**: We need to find the logic that dictates where the '2' moves. Let's analyze the coordinates.\n    *   **Example A**: The '2' moves from `(r, c) = (1, 1)` to `(r', c') = (0, 0)`. The change in coordinates is `(-1, -1)`.\n    *   **Example B**: The '2' moves from `(r, c) = (3, 6)` to `(r', c') = (2, 7)`. The change in coordinates is `(-1, +1)`.\n\n    The direction of movement is not constant. Let's check if it depends on the parity (odd or even) of the source coordinates `(r, c)`.\n    *   In A, `(1, 1)` is (odd, odd). The move is `(-1, -1)`.\n    *   In B, `(3, 6)` is (odd, even). The move is `(-1, +1)`.\n\n    This suggests a pattern. Let's formulate a hypothesis for the movement vector `(dr, dc)` based on the parity of the source coordinates `(r, c)`:\n    *   If `(r, c)` is (odd, odd), the move is `(dr, dc) = (-1, -1)`.\n    *   If `(r, c)` is (odd, even), the move is `(dr, dc) = (-1, +1)`.\n    *   We can extrapolate a symmetrical pattern for other parities, though they are not present in the examples:\n        *   If `(r, c)` is (even, odd), the move might be `(dr, dc) = (+1, -1)`.\n        *   If `(r, c)` is (even, even), the move might be `(dr, dc) = (+1, +1)`.\n\n    This hypothesis correctly explains the transformations in both Example A and Example B.\n\n### Solving for Input_C\n\nNow, we apply this rule to `Input_C`.\n\n*   **Input_C**:\n    ```\n    000000\n    011120\n    111111\n    ```\n\n1.  **Locate the '2'**: The '2' is in the second row, fifth column. The 0-indexed coordinates are `(r, c) = (1, 4)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the move**: The row index `r=1` is odd, and the column index `c=4` is even. This corresponds to the (odd, even) case.\n\n3.  **Apply the rule**: For an (odd, even) position, the movement vector is `(dr, dc) = (-1, +1)`.\n    *   The destination coordinates are `(r + dr, c + dc) = (1 - 1, 4 + 1) = (0, 5)`.\n\n4.  **Check the destination cell**: The value at `Input_C[0][5]` is '0'. The move is valid.\n\n5.  **Construct the output**:\n    *   Change the value at the source `(1, 4)` from '2' to '0'.\n    *   Change the value at the destination `(0, 5)` from '0' to '2'.\n    *   The original `Input_C` grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 0\n        0 1 1 1 2 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n    *   The transformed `Output_C` grid:\n        ```\n        0 0 0 0 0 2\n        0 1 1 1 0 0\n        1 1 1 1 1 1\n        ```\n\n6.  **Format the result**: Concatenating the rows with commas gives the final answer.\n\n`000002,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
