Based on the body of evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 are predicted to exhibit a significantly increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, compared to those manufactured without it. This leads to enhanced anti-tumor activity and polyfunctionality, but also a higher risk of cytokine release syndrome.
