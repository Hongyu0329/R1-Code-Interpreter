    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field ϕ is represented by a functional integral over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time τ with a period β = 1/T, where T is the temperature.\n\nThe partition function is given by:\nZ = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S_E[ϕ])\n\nHere, S_E[ϕ] is the Euclidean action of the scalar field. For a neutral scalar field with mass m, the Euclidean Lagrangian density, L_E, is typically composed of a kinetic term, a mass term, and an interaction term V(ϕ). For the free theory (where V(ϕ) = 0), the Lagrangian is:\nL_E = ½ (∂_τ ϕ)² + ½ (∇ϕ)² + ½ m²ϕ²\n\nThe Euclidean action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time τ running from 0 to β):\nS_E[ϕ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x [½ (∂_τ ϕ)² + ½ (∇ϕ)² + ½ m²ϕ²]\n\nTo identify the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ), the action is often written in a quadratic form. Through integration by parts and assuming the fields vanish at spatial infinity, the action can be expressed as:\nS_E[ϕ] = ½ ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)\n\nThis quadratic part of the action is identified with ½(ϕ, D_ϕ). The inner product of two fields, f and g, in this context is defined as:\n(f, g) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x f(τ, x) g(τ, x)\n\nFrom this, the operator D_ϕ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\nD_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n\nTherefore, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field is the quadratic part of the Euclidean action.\n\n<<<In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is given by:\n\n(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)\n\nwhere:\n*   ϕ(τ, x) is the neutral scalar field.\n*   τ is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β = 1/T (where T is the temperature).\n*   x represents the spatial coordinates.\n*   m is the mass of the scalar field.\n*   ∂_τ² is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.\n*   ∇² is the Laplacian operator with respect to the spatial coordinates.\n\nThis expression represents the Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field. The operator D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² is the corresponding Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator."
