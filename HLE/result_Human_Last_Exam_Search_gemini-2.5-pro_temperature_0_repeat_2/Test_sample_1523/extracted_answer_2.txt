In the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral scalar field at finite temperature, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is given by:

(ϕ, D_ϕ) = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ d³x ϕ(τ, x) [-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²] ϕ(τ, x)

where:
*   ϕ(τ, x) is the neutral scalar field.
*   τ is the imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β = 1/T (where T is the temperature).
*   x represents the spatial coordinates.
*   m is the mass of the scalar field.
*   ∂_τ² is the second partial derivative with respect to imaginary time.
*   ∇² is the Laplacian operator with respect to the spatial coordinates.

This expression represents the Euclidean action for a free, neutral scalar field. The operator D_ϕ = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m² is the corresponding Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.
