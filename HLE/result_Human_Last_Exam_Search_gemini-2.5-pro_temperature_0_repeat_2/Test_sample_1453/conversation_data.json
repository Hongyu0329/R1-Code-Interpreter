    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are critical as they form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil through \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, which dictates the oligomeric state.\n\nFirst, we need to establish the correct register of the heptad repeat for the given sequence. The 'a' and 'd' positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic amino acids like Leucine (L), Isoleucine (I), Valine (V), and Alanine (A). They are separated by two amino acids in the primary sequence (e.g., `a` at position *i*, `d` at position *i*+3).\n\nLet's analyze the sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nWe can look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues that could fit the `a` and `d` positions. A key insight comes from landmark studies on the GCN4 protein, which established a set of rules for how the residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions determine the oligomeric state. Specifically, the relative placement of Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L) is a strong determinant:\n*   **Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd'** favors a **dimer**.\n*   **Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd'** favors a **trimer**.\n*   **Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd'** favors a **tetramer**.\n\nLet's search for the `L-x-x-I` pattern in the sequence, which would correspond to Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd'. We can find this pattern starting at residue 7:\n\n`L(7) K(8) E(9) I(10)`\n\nThis suggests a register where Leucine is at the 'a' position and Isoleucine is at the 'd' position. Let's verify this register across the entire sequence. If L(7) is in the 'a' position, the subsequent 'a' positions will be at 14, 21, and 28. The 'd' positions will be at 10, 17, and 24.\n\n*   **'a' positions**:\n    *   Position 7: **L**\n    *   Position 14: **L**\n    *   Position 21: **L**\n    *   Position 28: **L**\n*   **'d' positions**:\n    *   Position 10: **I**\n    *   Position 17: **I**\n    *   Position 24: **I**\n\nThe sequence shows a remarkably consistent pattern of Leucine at all 'a' positions and Isoleucine at all 'd' positions within the core repeating region.\n\nBased on the established principles of knobs-into-holes packing, the bulkier, Î²-branched side chain of isoleucine fits better into the hydrophobic core when it is at the 'd' position, while the less bulky leucine occupies the 'a' position. This specific arrangement allows for the efficient packing of four helices. Therefore, a coiled-coil with Leucine at the 'a' positions and Isoleucine at the 'd' positions is known to form a tetramer.\n\nGiven this analysis, the protein sequence provided would most likely form a tetramer.\n\n<<<C>>>"
