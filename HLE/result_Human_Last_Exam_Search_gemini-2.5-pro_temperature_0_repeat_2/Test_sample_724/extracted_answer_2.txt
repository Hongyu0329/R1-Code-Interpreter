The maximum amount of water left, `W`, is given by the expression:
`W = k \times 100 - (2k-1) \left( m - 100 \sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1} \right)`

Where `k` is the unique integer in `{1, 2, ..., n}` that satisfies:
`100 \sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1} < m \le 100 \sum_{j=k}^{n} \frac{1}{2j-1}`

Note: An empty sum (where the starting index is greater than the ending index) is equal to 0.
