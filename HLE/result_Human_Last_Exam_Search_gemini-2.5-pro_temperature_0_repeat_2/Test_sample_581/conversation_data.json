    "The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is 496.\n\nA cap set is a collection of points in an n-dimensional affine space over the field of 3 elements (F_3^n) where no three points are collinear. The size of the largest possible cap set in dimension n is a central problem in combinatorics.\n\nFor lower dimensions, the exact maximum sizes are known:\n*   **Dimension 1:** 2\n*   **Dimension 2:** 4\n*   **Dimension 3:** 9\n*   **Dimension 4:** 20\n*   **Dimension 5:** 45\n*   **Dimension 6:** 112\n\nFor dimensions greater than 6, the exact maximum size is unknown, and research focuses on finding tighter lower and upper bounds. While simple constructions like the direct product of smaller caps can provide lower bounds (for instance, the product of the dimension 2 and dimension 6 caps gives a lower bound of 4 * 112 = 448 for dimension 8), more sophisticated methods yield better results.\n\nA 2018 paper on Sidon sets and caps provides a table of the best-known bounds, which lists the lower bound for the size of a maximal cap in dimension 8 as 496.\n\n<<<F>>>"
