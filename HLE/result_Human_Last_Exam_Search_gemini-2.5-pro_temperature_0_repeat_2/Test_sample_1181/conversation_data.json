    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is Dr. Snaut who suggests a way to replicate the sound of rustling leaves, indicating a deep longing for Earth.\n\nIn a conversation with the main character, Kris Kelvin, Snaut mentions that the environment on the space station is so bleak and depressing that one could hang strips of paper from an air conditioning vent to simulate the sound of leaves rustling in the wind.
