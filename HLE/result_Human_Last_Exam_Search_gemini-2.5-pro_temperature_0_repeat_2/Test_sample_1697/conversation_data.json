    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed Ortho-Metalation:** The starting molecule, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, has two functional groups that can direct the lithiation: the N,N-diethylamide group (-CONEt₂) at position 1 and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) at position 3. Both are known as directing metalation groups (DMGs). The amide group is one of the most powerful DMGs used in these types of reactions. The dimethylamino group also directs the metalation to its ortho positions.\n\n    The sec-butyllithium is a very strong base, and its reactivity is enhanced by the addition of TMEDA, which chelates the lithium ion and breaks down the organolithium aggregates. The directing groups guide the strong base to deprotonate a specific proton on the aromatic ring. The amide group directs lithiation to the C2 and C6 positions, while the dimethylamino group directs to the C2 and C4 positions. Due to the synergistic effect of both groups directing to the C2 position, the lithiation occurs regioselectively at this position, which is located between the two directing groups. This forms a thermodynamically stable aryllithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Reaction with Methyl Iodide:** The resulting aryllithium species is a potent nucleophile. In the second step, it reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I), which is an electrophile. The carbanion attacks the methyl group of the methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion and forming a new carbon-carbon bond. This step introduces a methyl group onto the C2 position of the benzene ring.\n\nThe overall reaction is a highly regioselective method for the synthesis of a polysubstituted aromatic compound.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
