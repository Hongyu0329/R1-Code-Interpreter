    "To solve the equation CIV/XXX - MMMDCCCLXXXVIII, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern Arabic numbers.\n\n*   **CIV**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (I = 1) comes before a larger value (V = 5 or X = 10), it is subtracted. C represents 100, and IV represents 4 (5 - 1). Therefore, CIV is 100 + 4 = 104.\n*   **XXX**: This is a simple repetition of the numeral X (10). So, XXX is 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n*   **MMMDCCCLXXXVIII**: This numeral is broken down as follows: MMM = 3000, DCCC = 800, LXXX = 80, and VIII = 8. Adding these together gives 3000 + 800 + 80 + 8 = 3888.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n104 / 30 - 3888\n\nFirst, we perform the division:\n\n104 / 30 ≈ 3.4667\n\nNext, we perform the subtraction:\n\n3.4667 - 3888 = -3884.5333\n\nThe repeating decimal can be expressed as the fraction 8/15. Therefore, the precise answer is -3884 and 8/15.\n\n<<<−3884.5333>>>"
