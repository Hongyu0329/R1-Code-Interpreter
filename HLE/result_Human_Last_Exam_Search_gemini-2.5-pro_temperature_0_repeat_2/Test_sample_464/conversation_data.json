    "Yes, it follows that $f=0$. Here is a justification of this result.\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. The defining properties of a Schwartz function are that it is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and that the function and all its derivatives decay faster than any inverse power of $x$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe condition given is that all the moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all integers } k \\ge 0 $$\n\nTo see why this implies that $f$ must be the zero function, we can analyze the Fourier transform of $f$. Let $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ be the Fourier transform of $f(x)$, defined as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\nA fundamental property of the Schwartz class is that the Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the space of Schwartz functions onto itself. This means that $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function, and importantly, $f=0$ if and only if $\\hat{f}=0$.\n\nLet's examine the derivatives of the Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$. The $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}$ can be computed by differentiating under the integral sign:\n$$ \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k e^{-2\\pi i x \\xi} \\,dx $$\nThis is valid because $f$ is a Schwartz function, which ensures the resulting integral converges uniformly.\n\nNow, let's evaluate these derivatives at the point $\\xi = 0$:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) (-2\\pi i x)^k \\,dx = (-2\\pi i)^k \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx $$\nAccording to the given condition, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^k f(x) \\,dx = 0$ for all $k \\ge 0$. This directly implies that:\n$$ \\hat{f}^{(k)}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all integers } k \\ge 0 $$\n\nSo, we have a function $\\hat{f}$ which is in the Schwartz class and has the property that all of its derivatives at the origin are zero.\n\nFor a general $C^\\infty$ function, this condition is not sufficient to conclude that the function is identically zero. The classic counterexample is the function $g(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$ for $x \\neq 0$ and $g(0)=0$, which has all derivatives at $x=0$ equal to zero but is not the zero function.\n\nHowever, Schwartz functions are much more constrained. A key theorem in Fourier analysis states that if a Schwartz function has a zero of infinite order at a point, then it must be identically zero. In our case, $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function with a zero of infinite order at $\\xi=0$. Therefore, it must be that $\\hat{f}(\\xi) = 0$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nSince the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is the zero function, and the Fourier transform is an isomorphism on the space of Schwartz functions, the original function $f$ must also be the zero function.\n\nIn summary:\n1.  The condition that all moments of $f$ are zero implies that all derivatives of its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ are zero at the origin.\n2.  A non-trivial theorem of analysis states that a Schwartz function with a zero of infinite order at a point must be identically zero.\n3.  Thus, $\\hat{f}$ must be the zero function.\n4.  Because the Fourier transform is an invertible map on the Schwartz space, $f$ itself must be the zero function.\n\n<<<Yes, it follows that $f=0$.>>>"
