The density profile \(\rho(z)\) is determined by the numerical solution of a system of coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations derived from the principles of hydrostatic and diffusive equilibrium for a van der Waals gas mixture. An analytical solution is not feasible. The profile is qualitatively characterized by a decrease in density with height, with the heavier gas (Gas B) being more concentrated at lower altitudes than the lighter gas (Gas A).
