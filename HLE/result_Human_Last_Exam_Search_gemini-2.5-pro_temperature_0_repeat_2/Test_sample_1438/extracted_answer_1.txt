The value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle is not a numerical constant but is defined by the anticommuting nature of the Grassmann variables themselves, specifically the property η² = 0 for any Grassmann variable η. This property, which is a direct mathematical expression of the Pauli exclusion principle, is the foundation for the Berezin integration rules (∫ dθ = 0 and ∫ dθ θ = 1) that define the fermionic path integral measure.
