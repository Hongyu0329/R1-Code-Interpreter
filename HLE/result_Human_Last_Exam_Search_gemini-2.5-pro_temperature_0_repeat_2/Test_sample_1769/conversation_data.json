    "If the Norse had never invaded and interacted with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **Suster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a product of the linguistic blending that occurred during the Viking Age. The original Old English word for a female sibling was **sweostor** (pronounced roughly as \"swe-os-tor\"). This word and its variations, like `swuster` and `swester`, were the native Anglo-Saxon terms.\n\nDuring the period of Norse settlement in England, the Old English `sweostor` was heavily influenced by the Old Norse cognate **systir**. The distinctive \"i\" sound in the modern word \"sister\" was borrowed from the Old Norse form, eventually replacing the \"eo\" or \"u\" sound of the original Old English word. This type of linguistic exchange was common, with some Old English words being entirely replaced by their Norse counterparts (e.g., Old English *ey* became the Norse-influenced *egg*), while others, like *sister*, became hybrids.\n\nHad there been no Norse influence, the Old English `sweostor` would have followed a purely English evolutionary path:\n\n1.  **From Old English to Middle English:** The unstressed vowel at the end would have weakened, and the `eo` diphthong, influenced by the preceding `sw-`, would likely have smoothed into a \"u\" sound. This is evidenced by the attested Middle English form `suster`, which existed alongside the Norse-influenced `sister`.\n\n2.  **From Middle English to Modern English:** The Middle English word `suster` would have undergone the same phonetic shifts as similar words. The short \"u\" sound (as in \"put\") would have evolved into the modern /ÊŒ/ vowel, the sound heard in words like \"cup\" or \"butter\".\n\nTherefore, the final form would be **Suster**, rhyming with \"duster\". A less likely, but still plausible, alternative could have been *Swester*, which would have more closely resembled its German cognate *Schwester*. However, the prevalence of the `suster` form in Middle English makes it the most probable outcome.\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
