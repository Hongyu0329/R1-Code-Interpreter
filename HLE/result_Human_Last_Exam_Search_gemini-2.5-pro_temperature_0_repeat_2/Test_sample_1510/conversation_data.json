    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nThe point group of a wallpaper group describes its rotational and reflectional symmetries. A point group of order 2 can be of two types:\n*   **C₂**: This group contains a single rotation of 180 degrees.\n*   **D₁**: This group contains a single reflection.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry elements, including their point group. The wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group C₂. It contains 180-degree rotations but no reflections or glide reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group has a point group D₁. It contains reflections along parallel axes.\n*   **pg**: This group also has a point group D₁. It does not have reflections but possesses glide reflections.\n*   **cm**: This group's point group is also D₁. It features reflections and is characterized by a centered lattice.\n\nTherefore, a total of four wallpaper groups have a point group of order 2.\n\n<<<4>>>"
