    "A classification of the finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 has been established. These are the groups that possess a locally maximal product-free set of size 2. The term \"locally maximal product-free\" is synonymous with \"maximal by inclusion product-free\" in this context.\n\nThe definitive classification was provided by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their 2016 paper, \"Groups containing small locally maximal product-free sets\". While the full, explicit list of these groups is contained within this publication, it is not detailed in the readily available abstracts and summaries.\n\nHowever, some general properties of such groups have been described. If *S* is a locally maximal product-free set in a finite group *G*, then the subgroup generated by *S*, denoted as &lt;*S*&gt;, is a normal subgroup of *G*. Furthermore, the quotient group *G*/&lt;*S*&gt; is either trivial or an elementary abelian 2-group.\n\nFor the specific case where the locally maximal product-free set has a size of 2, the groups have been fully classified by Giudici and Hart. For instance, an example of a group with a locally maximal product-free set of size 2 is the cyclic group of order 6, C₆, where the set can be {x², x³}.\n\nTherefore, while a precise number of such finite groups is not available without consulting the full text of the aforementioned research paper, the classification is known and finite.\n\n<<<The classification of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2 has been completed by Giudici and Hart, but the exact number and list of these groups are detailed within their specific research paper which is not fully accessible through the performed searches.>>>"
