    "To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first understand the composition of the molecule and the structure of the basis set.\n\n**1. Molecular Composition:**\n*   Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms.\n*   Toluene has 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n**2. Basis Set Definition (6-31G):**\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions. This is a split-valence basis set.\n\n*   **For each Carbon atom (a first-row element):**\n    *   The **core orbital (1s)** is described by a single contracted function made from 6 primitive Gaussian functions (the \"6\" in 6-31G).\n    *   The **valence orbitals (2s and 2p)** are split into two parts for more flexibility.\n        *   An inner part described by one set of s and p functions (s, px, py, pz), each contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians (the \"3\" in 6-31G). This gives 4 contracted functions.\n        *   An outer part described by another set of s and p functions, each represented by a single primitive Gaussian (the \"1\" in 6-31G). This gives another 4 contracted functions.\n    *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (for 1s) + 4 (for inner valence 2sp) + 4 (for outer valence 2sp) = **9 contracted functions**.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons. Its **valence orbital (1s)** is split into two parts.\n        *   An inner part contracted from 3 primitive Gaussians (the \"3\"). This is 1 contracted function.\n        *   An outer part represented by a single primitive Gaussian (the \"1\"). This is 1 contracted function.\n    *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner 1s) + 1 (outer 1s) = **2 contracted functions**.\n\n**3. Total Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   Total functions from Carbon atoms: 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions.\n*   Total functions from Hydrogen atoms: 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions.\n*   **Total contracted Gaussian functions** = 63 + 16 = **79**.\n\n<<<79>>>"
