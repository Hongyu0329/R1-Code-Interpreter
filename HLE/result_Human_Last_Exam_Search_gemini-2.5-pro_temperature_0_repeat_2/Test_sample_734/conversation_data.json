    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and the alterations in natural laws at the Fall is **Karl Barth**.\n\nThe Swiss theologian Karl Barth (1886-1968) introduced the specific and highly developed concept of ***das Nichtige***, or **\"the Nothingness,\"** to describe the nature of evil, sin, and the consequences of the Fall. For Barth, *das Nichtige* is not merely the absence of being, but an active, hostile, and chaotic power that stands in opposition to God's grace and His good creation. It is the reality that God definitively rejects and says \"No\" to in His act of creation and redemption. The Fall of humanity is understood as a turn towards and an actualization of this \"nothingness.\"\n\nBarth applies this unique framework directly to his understanding of the virgin birth. He interprets the virgin birth as a divine \"sign\" (*Zeichen*) of the incarnation, which embodies God's simultaneous \"No\" and \"Yes\" to humanity.\n\n*   **God's \"No\":** The virgin birth is a miracle that sets aside the natural law of human procreation. For Barth, this act signifies God's judgment and rejection—His \"No\"—of the fallen human condition, which is under the power of *das Nichtige*. By excluding a human father from the conception of Jesus, God demonstrates that sinful humanity is incapable of contributing to its own salvation or bridging the gap to God.\n\n*   **God's \"Yes\":** Simultaneously, the virgin birth is the sign of God's gracious \"Yes\" to humanity. It is a purely divine, creative act of the Holy Spirit, establishing a new beginning for humanity in Jesus Christ, one that is not determined by the fallen natural order but solely by God's sovereign will.\n\nIn this way, Barth uses his specialized concept of *das Nichtige* to provide a theological explanation for the alteration of natural law in the virgin birth. The miracle is not just a random wonder but a profound sign of God's victory over the chaos of the Fall, making him the theologian who developed a specific terminological and conceptual apparatus to describe changes in the laws of nature in both of these contexts.\n\n<<<Karl Barth>>>"
