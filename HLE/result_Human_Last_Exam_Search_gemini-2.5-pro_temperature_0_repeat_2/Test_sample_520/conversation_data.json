    "I am unable to find any information about a Belgian refugee named Andre Vernault who was suspected of being a German spy by British counterintelligence during World War II. Searches for this individual, as well as broader inquiries into misidentified Belgian refugee spies in the UK during that period, have not yielded any relevant results.\n\nIt is possible that the name is misspelled, the case is not documented in publicly available online records, or the story may be apocryphal.
