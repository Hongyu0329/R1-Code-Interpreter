    "The major reduction product of di(perylene-3-yl) disulfide is **perylene-3-thiol** (C₂₀H₁₂S). The reduction cleaves the disulfide bond (-S-S-), yielding two identical thiol (-SH) molecules.\n\nThe determination of the Szeged/Wiener index ratio requires the calculation of both topological indices for the complete molecular graph of perylene-3-thiol, including all hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **Wiener Index (W):** This index is the sum of the shortest distances between all pairs of atoms (vertices) in the molecular graph.\n*   **Szeged Index (Sz):** For each bond in the molecule, the number of atoms lying closer to one end of the bond is multiplied by the number of atoms lying closer to the other end. The Szeged index is the sum of these products over all bonds in the molecule.\n\nThese calculations, particularly for a molecule with 33 atoms (20 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 1 sulfur), are computationally complex and necessitate the use of specialized chemical graph theory software. The information required to provide a direct numerical answer is not available in published literature or databases accessible through the performed searches. While the principles of the indices are well-documented, the specific values for perylene-3-thiol have not been found.\n\nDue to the need for specialized computational tools to perform the graph analysis, a numerical answer cannot be provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer.>>>"
