The probability to draw a link `y_{ij}` between nodes `i` and `j` in a jointly exchangeable random graph is the expected edge density of the underlying random graphon. Formally, it is given by the expression: `P(y_{ij} = 1) = E[∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ W(u, v) du dv]`, where `W` is the random graphon and the expectation is taken over the distribution of `W`.
