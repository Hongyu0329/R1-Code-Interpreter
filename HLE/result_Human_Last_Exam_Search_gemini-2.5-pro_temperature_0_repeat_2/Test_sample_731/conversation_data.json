    "The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as SD_512. The order of this group is 512, which can be written as 2^n, where n=9. The semidihedral group SD_{2^n} is defined by the presentation:\n\nSD_{2^n} = <r, s | r^(2^(n-1)) = s^2 = 1, srs = r^(2^(n-2) - 1)>\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, n=9, and the presentation is:\n\nSD_512 = <r, s | r^256 = s^2 = 1, srs = r^127>\n\nA power subgroup of a group G is a subgroup H that can be expressed as H = G^m = {g^m | g ∈ G} for some integer m. To find the number of power subgroups, we need to determine the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\nThe power subgroups of a semidihedral group SD_{2^n} are well-studied. The number of distinct power subgroups for SD_{2^n} where n ≥ 4 is known to be n. For the semidihedral group of size 512, we have n=9.\n\nThe power subgroups are:\n1.  **When m is an odd integer:** The set of m-th powers of all elements, G^m, is equal to the group G itself. This forms one power subgroup.\n2.  **When m is an even integer:** Let m = 2^k * d, where d is odd and k ≥ 1. The power subgroup G^m is the cyclic subgroup generated by r^(2^k), which is denoted as <r^(2^k)>. As k ranges from 1 to n-1 (which is 8 for n=9), we get the following distinct subgroups:\n    *   <r^2>\n    *   <r^4>\n    *   <r^8>\n    *   <r^16>\n    *   <r^32>\n    *   <r^64>\n    *   <r^128>\n    *   <r^256> (which is the trivial subgroup containing only the identity element)\n\nThis gives 8 distinct subgroups for even values of m.\n\nIn total, we have 1 subgroup from the odd powers and 8 subgroups from the even powers, resulting in a total of 1 + 8 = 9 power subgroups.\n\n<<<9>>>"
