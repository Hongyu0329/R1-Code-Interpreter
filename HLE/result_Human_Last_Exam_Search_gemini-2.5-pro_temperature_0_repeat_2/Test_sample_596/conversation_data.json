    "Based on the available research, a precise numerical answer to this question cannot be provided without a specific definition of the \"standard triangulation\" of the Möbius band and performing complex calculations from the field of algebraic topology. The number of higher-dimensional rooted forests that fail to simplicially collapse is not a universal topological invariant.\n\nHere is a summary of the relevant theoretical findings:\n\n*   **Condition for Collapse**: A higher-dimensional rooted forest `(F,R)` fails to simplicially collapse if and only if its relative homology group `H_{d-1}(F, R)` is non-trivial. For the Möbius band, which is a 2-dimensional manifold, this condition becomes `H_1(F, R) ≠ 0`.\n\n*   **Non-orientability**: The failure of a forest to collapse is often linked to the non-orientability of the underlying space. For closed non-orientable manifolds, it has been shown that any \"spanning forest\" (a forest that captures the homology of the manifold) will fail to collapse onto any of its roots. This is because the forest inherits torsion in its top homology group from the manifold, which cannot be accounted for by the root.\n\n*   **The Möbius Band Case**: The Möbius band is a non-orientable surface, but it is not closed (it has a boundary). Therefore, the theorems for closed manifolds do not directly apply. The first homology group of the Möbius band, `H_1(M)`, is the infinite cyclic group **Z**, which has no torsion. The failure of a forest `F` to collapse to its root `R` depends on whether the cycles in `R` can generate the cycles in `F`. A forest `F` that contains the central non-contractible loop of the Möbius band will have `H_1(F) = Z`. If its root `R` is, for example, a tree (and thus has `H_1(R) = 0`), the forest `F` will not collapse to `R`.\n\n*   **Dependence on Triangulation**: The number of possible rooted forests, and therefore the number of non-collapsing ones, depends directly on the specific combinatorial structure of the triangulation used. Different triangulations will have different numbers of vertices, edges, and faces, leading to a different count.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is established that such non-collapsing forests exist on a triangulated Möbius band, determining their exact number requires a specific triangulation and a detailed calculation involving the Laplacian matrix of the complex, a task beyond the scope of this format.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a specific numerical answer as it depends on the precise definition of the \"standard triangulation\" of the Möbius band and requires complex mathematical calculations not available through the provided tools.>>>"
