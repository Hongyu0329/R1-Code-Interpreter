The Poynting vector $\vec{S}$ is given by:
For $r < R$ (inside the rod):
$$ \vec{S}(r, \phi, z) = -\frac{E \rho v r}{2} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v r^2}{4\epsilon_0} \hat{k} $$
For $r > R$ (outside the rod):
$$ \vec{S}(r, \phi, z) = -\frac{E \rho v R^2}{2r} \hat{r} + \frac{\rho^2 v R^4}{4\epsilon_0 r^2} \hat{k} $$
where $\hat{r}$ is the radial unit vector away from the axis and $\hat{k}$ is the unit vector along the axis of the rod in the direction of its motion.
