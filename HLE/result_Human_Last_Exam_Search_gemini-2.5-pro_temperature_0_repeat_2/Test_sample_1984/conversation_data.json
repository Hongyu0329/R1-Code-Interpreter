    "To find the number of stable equilibria, we first need to find the equilibrium points of the differential equation $x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t)$. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$.\n\nLet $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We set $f(x) = 0$ to find the equilibria:\n$-x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0$\n$-x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0$\n$-x(x-1)^2 = 0$\n\nThe equilibrium points are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$.\n\nNext, we need to determine the stability of these equilibrium points. We can use the first derivative test for stability. An equilibrium point $x^*$ is stable if $f'(x^*) < 0$ and unstable if $f'(x^*) > 0$.\n\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1$\n\nNow, we evaluate the derivative at each equilibrium point:\nFor $x = 0$:\n$f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\nSince $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is stable.\n\nFor $x = 1$:\n$f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\nSince $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We need to analyze the sign of $f(x)$ around $x=1$.\n\nThe function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\nFor a value of $x$ slightly less than 1 (e.g., $x = 0.9$), $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9-1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.009 < 0$.\nFor a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1 (e.g., $x = 1.1$), $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1-1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -0.011 < 0$.\n\nSince $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$ for values of $x$ on both sides of $x=1$ (for $x$ close to 1), solutions starting near $x=1$ will move away from it on one side (for $x<1$) and towards it on the other (for $x>1$). Specifically, if a solution starts at $x_0 > 1$, it will move towards 1. If it starts at $x_0 < 1$, it will move away from 1. Therefore, the equilibrium point $x=1$ is not stable; it is classified as a semi-stable equilibrium.\n\nThus, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nThe number of stable equilibria is $m = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\n$m - 2^{4048} = 1 - 2^{4048}$.\n\n<<<1 - 2**4048>>>"
