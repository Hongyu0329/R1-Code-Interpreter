    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is most clearly expressed in frequency-momentum space.\n\nFor a system of non-interacting fermions, the bare Green's function is a diagonal matrix in the basis of the single-particle energy eigenstates. The expression for the bare Green's function G₀ for a given state with momentum **k** and energy eigenvalue ϵ_k is:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη sgn(ϵ_k - μ))**\n\nWhere:\n*   **ω** is the frequency.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with momentum **k**.\n*   **μ** is the chemical potential, which determines the Fermi level.\n*   **η** is a positive infinitesimal, often written as 0⁺. This term is crucial for defining the contour of integration in the complex frequency plane and ensures the causal nature of the propagator.\n*   **sgn** is the signum function, which is +1 for arguments greater than zero and -1 for arguments less than zero.\n\nThis functional form reveals that the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur at the single-particle energy eigenvalues ϵ_k. The term *iη* specifies how to handle these poles during integration, with the sign determined by whether the energy level is above or below the chemical potential. This mathematical structure is fundamental in calculating physical observables through Feynman diagrams, where G₀ represents the internal lines of the diagrams for non-interacting particles. The full interacting Green's function can then be determined from G₀ using the Dyson equation."
