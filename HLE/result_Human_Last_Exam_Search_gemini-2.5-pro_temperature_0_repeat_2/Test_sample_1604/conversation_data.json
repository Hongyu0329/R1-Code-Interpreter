    "The latest historical battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler is the **Battle of Huj**, which took place on November 8, 1917. The painting is titled ***The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj***.\n\nThis engagement occurred during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. The battle involved a charge by the British 5th Mounted Brigade against a rearguard position of German, Austrian, and Turkish forces. The charge is considered one of the last great British cavalry charges in history.\n\nLady Butler, a renowned British painter of military scenes, immortalized this event in a watercolor painting. Her work is noted for its depiction of scenes from major 19th-century conflicts, including the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, as well as several works from the First World War. While she painted other scenes from World War I, such as *The Royal Horse Guards Retreat from Mons* (depicting a 1914 event) and *'Footballers at Loos'* (a 1915 event), the Battle of Huj in 1917 is the latest of these historical battles she is known to have painted.\n\n<<<The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj>>>"
