    "Given the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of Knowledge, and limited to the epistemic states of only Knowledge and Belief, two significant problems arise, distinct from Gettier cases.\n\n<<<**1. The Infinite Regress of Justification**\n\nThe \"Justified\" condition of the JTB account creates a logical problem known as the infinite regress. For a belief to be considered knowledge, it must be justified. However, the justification itself, being another belief, must also be justified. This leads to a dilemma:\n\n*   Each justification requires a further justification, creating an endless, infinite chain.\n*   If this chain is infinite, no belief can ever be *fully* justified, because the process of justification can never be completed.\n*   Therefore, under a strict reading, no belief could ever satisfy the justification criterion, making \"Knowledge\" an impossible state to achieve. We would be left with an endless series of beliefs justified by other beliefs, without a firm foundation. This is a core element of the Agrippan (or MÃ¼nchhausen) trilemma, which posits that any attempt to prove something will lead to infinite regress, circular reasoning, or dogmatic assertion.\n\n**2. The Inaccessibility of Truth**\n\nThe \"True\" condition of the JTB account presents a problem of verification. Knowledge requires a belief to be true, meaning it must correspond to reality. The problem is that we have no independent way to access this reality to confirm the truth of our beliefs without relying on other beliefs and justifications.\n\n*   To verify that a belief is true, one would need to compare it directly with the facts of the world.\n*   However, this act of comparison is itself an epistemic process that results in another belief (e.g., the belief that \"my original belief corresponds to reality\").\n*   This new belief would also need to be checked for truth, leading to a circle or another regress. To know that a belief is true, it seems we would already need to possess knowledge, making the definition circular.\n\nEssentially, we are confined to our own epistemic states. We can have beliefs about the truth of other beliefs, but we cannot step outside our belief system to access the \"Truth\" condition directly. This makes it impossible to definitively distinguish a justified *true* belief from a merely justified belief from within our own perspective.>>>"
