    "To determine the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables needed to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with two replicas, we must first identify the target space of the model and then calculate the dimension of its bosonic part.\n\nFor a supersymmetric sigma-model of symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target space is the supermanifold given by the quotient `SpO(2n, R|2n) / U(n|n)`. The bosonic sector of this model corresponds to the manifold formed by the quotient of the maximal bosonic subgroups of the respective supergroups.\n\nThe maximal bosonic subgroup of the orthosymplectic group `SpO(2n, R|2n)` is `Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)`.\nThe maximal bosonic subgroup of the unitary supergroup `U(n|n)` is `U(n) × U(n)`.\n\nTherefore, the manifold for the bosonic sector is:\n`(Sp(2n, R) × O(2n)) / (U(n) × U(n))`\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of this manifold, which is calculated as the dimension of the numerator group minus the dimension of the denominator group. We need to find the dimensions of these Lie groups for the case of two replicas, i.e., `n = 2`.\n\nThe general formulas for the dimensions of these Lie groups are:\n*   `dim(Sp(2n, R)) = n(2n + 1)`\n*   `dim(O(n)) = n(n - 1) / 2`\n*   `dim(U(n)) = n^2`\n\nFor `n = 2`, we have:\n*   `dim(Sp(4, R)) = 2 * (2 * 2 + 1) = 10`\n*   `dim(O(4)) = 4 * (4 - 1) / 2 = 6`\n*   `dim(U(2)) = 2^2 = 4`\n\nNow, we can calculate the dimension of the full bosonic manifold:\n*   Dimension of the numerator `Sp(4, R) × O(4)` is `dim(Sp(4, R)) + dim(O(4)) = 10 + 6 = 16`.\n*   Dimension of the denominator `U(2) × U(2)` is `dim(U(2)) + dim(U(2)) = 4 + 4 = 8`.\n\nThe number of non-Grassman variables is the difference between these dimensions:\n`Dimension = 16 - 8 = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
