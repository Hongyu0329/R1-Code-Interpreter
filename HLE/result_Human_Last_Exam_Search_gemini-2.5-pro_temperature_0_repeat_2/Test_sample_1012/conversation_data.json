    "An arbitrarily powerful quantum computer could theoretically crack a symmetric key using Grover's algorithm, which significantly reduces the time required for a brute-force attack. This algorithm effectively halves the bit strength of a symmetric key.\n\nTo counteract this, the key length must be doubled to maintain the same level of security against a quantum attack as compared to a classical attack. For instance, a 128-bit AES key, which is currently a standard for strong encryption against classical computers, would only offer the security equivalent of a 64-bit key against a quantum computer running Grover's algorithm. This is because the number of operations required to break it would be reduced from 2¹²⁸ to 2⁶⁴, a level that is considered computationally feasible.\n\nTherefore, to achieve a security level of at least 128 bits against a quantum computer—a commonly accepted baseline for security—a symmetric key of 256 bits is required. With a 256-bit key, Grover's algorithm would reduce the effective security to 128 bits (2¹²⁸ operations), which is still considered secure for the foreseeable future.\n\nOrganizations like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) recommend migrating to AES-256 to ensure resistance against quantum attacks. While NIST has been standardizing post-quantum cryptography for public-key systems, they have indicated that for symmetric key cryptography, increasing the key size is the appropriate defense.\n\n<<<A>>>"
