    "**The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the motor passenger ship *Brazza*.**\n\nThe *Brazza*, with a tonnage of 10,387 gross register tons (GRT), was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-37 on May 28, 1940. The attack occurred approximately 80 miles west of Cape Finisterre, Spain, while the *Brazza* was part of convoy 60-XF. The ship sank in less than five minutes, resulting in the loss of 379 passengers and crew.\n\nAnother significant loss for the French merchant marine to a U-boat during this period was the steam tanker *Monique*, weighing 7,011 GRT. It was sunk on June 22, 1940, the same day the armistice was signed, by U-65 in the Bay of Biscay.\n\nThe French Navy also lost the submarine *Doris* (525 tons) to a U-boat on May 8, 1940. However, in terms of sheer size, the *Brazza* was the most substantial French vessel lost to a U-boat prior to the cessation of hostilities between France and Germany in 1940.\n\n<<<Brazza>>>"
