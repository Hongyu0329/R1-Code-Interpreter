    "To determine the largest natural number *n* such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero, we need to investigate the structure of the algebraic K-groups of the ring of integers modulo 27. The ring in question is Z/p^k where p=3 and k=3.\n\nThe algebraic K-groups of rings of the form Z/p^k have been a subject of intense research. For rings like Z/27, the K-groups are known to be finite for positive indices. The computation of these groups is notoriously difficult, but significant progress has been made.\n\nRecent results in algebraic K-theory provide a description of these groups. According to the work of several mathematicians, there are established patterns for the vanishing of K-groups of Z/p^k. For the even K-groups, K_{2n}(Z/p^k), where p is an odd prime, their structure depends on n and the parameters p and k.\n\nBased on results concerning the K-theory of Z/p^n, for an odd prime p and n ≥ 2, the p-primary part of the even K-group K_{2i}(Z/p^n) is non-trivial for 1 ≤ i < p^(n-1) and trivial for i ≥ p^(n-1). Since the K-groups K_j(Z/p^n) for j ≥ 2 are p-groups, their p-primary part constitutes the entire group.\n\nFor the specific case of Z/27, we have p=3 and n=3. Applying the result, the K-group K_{2i}(Z/27) is non-zero if and only if i < 3^(3-1) = 9. This means that K_{2i}(Z/27) is non-zero for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and is zero for i ≥ 9.\n\nThe question asks for the largest natural number *n* such that K_{2n}(Z/27) is non-zero. This corresponds to the largest value of *i* in the notation used above. Therefore, the largest such value is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
