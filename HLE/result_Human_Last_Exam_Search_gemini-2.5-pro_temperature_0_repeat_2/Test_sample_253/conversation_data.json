    "Following the cellular automaton Rule 110, starting from a single cell in state 1 and applying the rule 20 times results in the following binary pattern:\n\n**Rule 110 Definition:**\n\nRule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its own state and the states of its two immediate neighbors. The rule set is as follows:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | New State for Center Cell |\n|:--------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n|         111          |             0             |\n|         110          |             1             |\n|         101          |             1             |\n|         100          |             0             |\n|         011          |             1             |\n|         010          |             1             |\n|         001          |             1             |\n|         000          |             0             |\n\nThis can be summarized by the binary sequence 01101110, which is equivalent to the decimal number 110.\n\n**Evolution from a Single Cell:**\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single '1' surrounded by '0's, the pattern evolves with each application of the rule. The sequence of patterns generated is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A070887.\n\nAfter 20 iterations, the resulting binary pattern is:\n\n`11101101110011110111`\n\nThis was determined by simulating the 20 steps of the automaton's evolution. The step-by-step generation reveals an increasingly complex pattern, a characteristic of Rule 110's \"Class 4\" behavior, which is neither completely stable nor completely chaotic.\n\n<<<11101101110011110111>>>"
