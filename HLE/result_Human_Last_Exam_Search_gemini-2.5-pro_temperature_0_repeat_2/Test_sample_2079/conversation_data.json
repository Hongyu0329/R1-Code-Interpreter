    "I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461.\n\nHowever, extensive research points to a specific academic source that almost certainly contains the answer. The book **\"Średniowieczny Bardiów i jego kontakty z Małopolską\"** (Medieval Bardejov and its Contacts with Lesser Poland) by Polish historian **Stanisław Andrzej Sroka** includes a list of the judges (richtári) of Bardejov in the 15th century on pages 66-68. A related publication by the same author, \"Bardejov v XV. storočí. Štúdie z dejín mesta\" (Bardejov in the 15th Century: Studies from the History of the Town), also contains a dedicated chapter on the judges of that century.\n\nWhile the search results confirm the existence of a judge and a town council in Bardejov in 1461, and even reference correspondence with the town council during that year, the specific name of the judge is not mentioned in the available online documents. Accessing the aforementioned book by Stanisław Andrzej Sroka would be the definitive way to identify the individual who held this position in 1461.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive answer.>>>"
