    "The value between heartbeats used to compute Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is called the **interbeat interval (IBI)**.\n\nThis interval is the time measured in milliseconds between two consecutive heartbeats. While this is the general term, you may also encounter other specific terms depending on the measurement method:\n\n*   **RR interval:** When measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG), this is the time between the peaks of two consecutive R-waves in the heart's electrical cycle.\n*   **Pulse-to-pulse (PP) interval:** When measured with photoplethysmography (PPG), as mentioned in your question, it is the time between two consecutive pulse waves.\n\nHRV is then calculated by analyzing the variation in these successive interbeat intervals.\n\n<<<interbeat interval (IBI)>>>"
