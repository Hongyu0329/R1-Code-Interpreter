    "### No Lectures Cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian Motion Paper\n\nAlbert Einstein's seminal 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the movement of small particles suspended in stationary liquids required by the molecular-kinetic theory of heat\"), does not cite any lectures.\n\nIn fact, the paper is notable for its lack of any formal citations or a bibliography. While Einstein does mention his awareness of the phenomenon he was investigating, writing, \"It is possible that the motions to be discussed here are identical with the so-called 'Brownian molecular motion'; however, the data available to me on the latter are so imprecise that I could not form a definite opinion on this matter,\" he does not formally cite any specific person's work or lectures.\n\nScholarly analyses of Einstein's paper confirm the absence of references. While the work of scientists like Ludwig Boltzmann and J. Willard Gibbs on statistical mechanics undoubtedly influenced Einstein's thinking, their lectures or writings are not formally referenced in this particular 1905 publication. His approach in the paper was largely theoretical, based on the principles of the kinetic theory of heat.\n\n<<<Albert Einstein did not cite any lectures in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.>>>"
