    "There is no finite upper bound on the number of components of the intersection of two closed connected subsets of the plane whose union is the unit square. We can construct examples with any finite number of components.\n\n### Construction for n components\n\nLet n be any integer greater than or equal to 1. We can construct two closed connected sets, A and B, whose union is the unit square S = x, and whose intersection has exactly n connected components.\n\nLet's define the sets A and B as follows:\n\n**Set A:**\nA consists of n vertical rectangular strips connected by a horizontal bar at the top edge of the square.\nThe vertical strips are:\n$V_i^A = [\\frac{2i-2}{2n}, \\frac{2i-1}{2n}] \\times$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.\nThe connecting bar is:\n$H^A = \\times \\{1\\}$.\n\nSo, $A = (\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} V_i^A) \\cup H^A$.\n\n*   **A is closed:** It is the union of a finite number of closed sets (rectangles), so it is closed.\n*   **A is connected:** Each vertical strip is connected, and the horizontal bar $H^A$ connects all of them at the top. Therefore, the entire set A is connected.\n\n**Set B:**\nSimilarly, B consists of n vertical rectangular strips that are in the gaps of A's strips, and they are connected by a horizontal bar at the bottom edge of the square.\nThe vertical strips are:\n$V_i^B = [\\frac{2i-1}{2n}, \\frac{2i}{2n}] \\times$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.\nThe connecting bar is:\n$H^B = \\times \\{0\\}$.\n\nSo, $B = (\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} V_i^B) \\cup H^B$.\n\n*   **B is closed:** For the same reason as A, B is closed.\n*   **B is connected:** Each vertical strip is connected, and the horizontal bar $H^B$ connects all of them at the bottom. Therefore, B is connected.\n\n**Union of A and B:**\nThe union of all the vertical strips from both A and B covers the entire unit square:\n$\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} (V_i^A \\cup V_i^B) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} [\\frac{i-1}{n}, \\frac{i}{n}] \\times = \\times = S$.\nSince the horizontal bars are subsets of the square, the union $A \\cup B$ is the unit square S.\n\n**Intersection of A and B:**\nThe intersection of A and B consists of the common boundaries between their respective vertical strips. The horizontal connecting bars are disjoint.\n$A \\cap B = ((\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} V_i^A) \\cup H^A) \\cap ((\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} V_i^B) \\cup H^B)$\nSince $H^A$ and $H^B$ are disjoint, the intersection is:\n$A \\cap B = (\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} V_i^A) \\cap (\\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} V_j^B)$\nThe strips $V_i^A$ and $V_j^B$ only intersect if they are adjacent, which occurs at their vertical boundaries.\nThe intersection points are the vertical lines:\n$L_i = \\{\\frac{2i-1}{2n}\\} \\times$ for $i = 1, 2, ..., n$.\n\nThe intersection $A \\cap B$ is the set $\\bigcup_{i=1}^{n} L_i$. This is a set of n disjoint vertical line segments. Each segment is a connected component. Therefore, the intersection has exactly n connected components.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSince we can construct a valid pair of sets A and B for any integer n â‰¥ 1 such that their intersection has n components, there is no finite maximum number of components. The number of components can be arbitrarily large.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of components is infinite.\n\n<<<inf>>>"
