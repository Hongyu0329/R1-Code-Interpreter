    "To date, there are 12 identified members of the let-7 family in humans. This family of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays a crucial role in developmental timing and tumor suppression.\n\nThe members of the human let-7 family are comprised of several distinct mature miRNAs, which are derived from multiple precursor genes. While the exact number can vary slightly between different scientific publications and databases, the consensus points to around a dozen members.\n\nSpecifically, the human let-7 family includes the following mature miRNAs:\n*   let-7a\n*   let-7b\n*   let-7c\n*   let-7d\n*   let-7e\n*   let-7f\n*   let-7g\n*   let-7i\n*   miR-98\n*   miR-202\n\nIt is important to note the distinction between the number of mature miRNAs and the number of genes that encode them. In humans, some of these mature let-7 miRNAs are encoded by multiple genes found at different locations in the genome. For instance, the mature let-7a miRNA is produced from three different precursor genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, and let-7a-3) located on different chromosomes. In total, there are 12 distinct genomic loci that give rise to nine of the mature let-7 miRNAs.\n\nThe miRBase database, a central repository for miRNA data, lists 12 let-7 paralogs in humans. This number aligns with other research that identifies 12 to 13 members in the human let-7 family. The slight variations in reported numbers can be due to ongoing discoveries and the distinction between precursor genes and the final mature miRNA molecules.\n\n<<<12>>>"
