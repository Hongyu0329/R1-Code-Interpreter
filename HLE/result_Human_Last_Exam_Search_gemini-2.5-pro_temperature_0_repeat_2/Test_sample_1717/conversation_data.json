    "Based on information derived from the game's source code and extensive community testing, the health of bosses in Terraria's Expert Mode scales with the number of players in a multiplayer session. The Eye of Cthulhu's base health for a single player in Expert Mode is 3,640.\n\nThe formula for health scaling in multiplayer is complex. For each player joining after the first, a progressively larger amount of health is added to the boss's total. The formula for the health multiplier increase for each additional player ensures that as the number of players (`n`) increases, the health multiplier also increases.\n\nThe key elements of the calculation are as follows:\n*   **Base Health (Expert):** 3,640\n*   **Multiplayer Scaling:** Starts from the second player. The health added for the second player is 35% of the single-player health.\n*   **Scaling Formula:** The percentage of health added for each subsequent player (`n+1`) is calculated based on the percentage added for the previous player (`n`). The formula is `HealthAdded[n+1] = HealthAdded[n] + (1 - HealthAdded[n]) / 3`. As the number of players approaches infinity, the health added per player approaches 100% of the base health.\n*   **Divergent Series:** The total health multiplier is the sum of these increasing percentages. Because the amount of health added per player does not trend towards zero, the total health multiplier grows indefinitely as the number of players increases.\n*   **Modification for 10+ Players:** For ten or more players, the health multiplier is adjusted by the formula: `ModifiedMultiplier = (OriginalMultiplier * 2 + 8) / 3`. While this slows the rate of increase, the multiplier still grows without bound as the original multiplier grows.\n\nSince the health multiplier increases indefinitely with an infinite number of players, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu would also be infinite. There is no indication in the analyzed source code of a hard cap on the boss's health.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
