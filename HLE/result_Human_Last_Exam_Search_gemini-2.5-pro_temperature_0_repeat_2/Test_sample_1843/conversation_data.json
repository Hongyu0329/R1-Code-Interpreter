    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we first need to analyze the structure of such characters.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Primitive Dirichlet Characters\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{k_1} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi_i$ with conductor $p_i^{k_i}$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$.\nFor $\\chi$ to be a primitive character of conductor $N$, each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a primitive character modulo its respective prime power $p^k$.\n\nThe order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe are looking for characters where this order is exactly 6.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Prime Power Factor\nWe need to find the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor of $N$ and determine their possible orders. The number of primitive characters of a specific order $k$ for a modulus $m$ is denoted as $n(m, k)$.\n\n*   **For modulus $4 = 2^2$**: The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. So, $n(4, 2) = 1$.\n\n*   **For modulus $9 = 3^2$**: The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. The characters that are not primitive are those induced from modulus 3. There are $\\phi(3)=2$ such characters. Thus, there are $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6 - 2 = 4$ primitive characters. The orders of elements in $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ are 1, 2, 3, 6. The non-primitive characters have orders 1 and 2. Therefore, primitive characters must have orders 3 or 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$. These are primitive. So, $n(9, 3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$. These are primitive. So, $n(9, 6) = 2$.\n\n*   **For modulus $7$**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. A character is primitive if it is not the principal character (conductor 1). There are $\\phi(7)-1 = 5$ primitive characters.\n    *   $n(7, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(7, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(7, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **For modulus $11$**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/10\\mathbb{Z}$. There are $\\phi(11)-1 = 9$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 10, excluding 1.\n    *   $n(11, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(11, 5) = \\phi(5) = 4$.\n    *   $n(11, 10) = \\phi(10) = 4$.\n\n*   **For modulus $13$**: The group of characters is $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$. There are $\\phi(13)-1 = 11$ primitive characters. Their orders are the divisors of 12, excluding 1.\n    *   $n(13, 2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   $n(13, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   $n(13, 4) = \\phi(4) = 2$.\n    *   $n(13, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   $n(13, 12) = \\phi(12) = 4$.\n\n### Step 4: Combining the Component Characters\nFor the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  The order of each component character $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The least common multiple of the orders must be exactly 6. This means at least one component's order must be divisible by 2, and at least one must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's count the number of choices for each component character satisfying the first condition (order divides 6):\n*   $\\chi_4$: The only possible order is 2, which divides 6. There is **1** choice: $n(4, 2) = 1$.\n*   $\\chi_9$: Possible orders are 3 and 6, both divide 6. There are $n(9, 3) + n(9, 6) = 2 + 2 = \\textbf{4}$ choices.\n*   $\\chi_7$: Possible orders are 2, 3, and 6, all divide 6. There are $n(7, 2) + n(7, 3) + n(7, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices.\n*   $\\chi_{11}$: The only possible order that divides 6 is 2. There is **1** choice: $n(11, 2) = 1$.\n*   $\\chi_{13}$: Possible orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6. There are $n(13, 2) + n(13, 3) + n(13, 6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\textbf{5}$ choices.\n\nThe total number of combinations of primitive characters where each component has an order dividing 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nTotal combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow, we verify the second condition for these 100 characters. Let $\\chi$ be any character formed by this combination.\n*   The order of $\\chi_4$ is always 2. This ensures that the lcm of the orders is divisible by 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6. In both cases, the order is divisible by 3. This ensures that the lcm of the orders is divisible by 3.\n\nSince the order of any such character $\\chi$ is divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. As we have already ensured that the order of each component divides 6, their lcm must also divide 6. The only integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 is 6 itself.\n\nTherefore, all 100 of these characters have an order of exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$ is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
