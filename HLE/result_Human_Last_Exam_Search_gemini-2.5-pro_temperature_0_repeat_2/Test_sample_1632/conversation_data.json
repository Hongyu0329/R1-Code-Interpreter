    "A self-avoiding walk is a sequence of moves on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term \"Manhattan lattice\" refers to a square lattice, sometimes with alternating one-way directions, but in the context of simply counting self-avoiding walks, it is typically treated as a standard square grid (Z2).\n\nThe number of n-step self-avoiding walks, denoted as a(n), on a square lattice has been calculated for various values of n. For a 10-step self-avoiding walk, the value of a(10) is 44,100.\n\nThe number of possible self-avoiding walks grows rapidly with the number of steps. For instance, while there are 284 five-step walks, the number for 15 steps increases to 6,416,596. There is no simple formula to calculate a(n) for any given n, and the computation for larger values of n is a significant challenge.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
