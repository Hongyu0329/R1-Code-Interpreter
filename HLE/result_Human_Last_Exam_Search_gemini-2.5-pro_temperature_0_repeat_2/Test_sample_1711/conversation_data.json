    "Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$. We are looking for the minimum size of a set $A \\subset G$ such that for every element $g \\in G$, the intersection of $A$ with the cyclic subgroup generated by $g$, denoted $\\langle g \\rangle$, is non-empty.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the cyclic subgroups of $G$. The order of an element in $\\mathbb{Z}/49\\mathbb{Z}$ can be 1, 7, or 49. Consequently, the order of any element $g \\in G$ must also be 1, 7, or 49. This means the cyclic subgroups of $G$ can have orders 1, 7, or 49.\n\nLet $A$ be a set that satisfies the given condition.\n\n1.  **The trivial subgroup:** For the identity element $e \\in G$, the cyclic subgroup is $\\langle e \\rangle = \\{e\\}$. The condition requires that $A \\cap \\{e\\} \\neq \\emptyset$, which implies that $e$ must be an element of $A$.\n\n2.  **Subgroups of order 7:** Let's consider the elements of order 7. These are the non-identity elements of the subgroup $H = \\{g \\in G \\mid 7g = e\\}$. This subgroup $H$ is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^{2024}$, which can be viewed as a 2024-dimensional vector space over the field with 7 elements, $\\mathbb{F}_7$. The cyclic subgroups of order 7 correspond to the 1-dimensional subspaces in this vector space.\n\n    The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in a vector space of dimension $n$ over a field of size $q$ is given by the formula $\\frac{q^n - 1}{q - 1}$. For our case, with $n=2024$ and $q=7$, the number of cyclic subgroups of order 7 is:\n    $N_7 = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{7 - 1} = \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n    Let $\\mathcal{C}_7$ be the set of all cyclic subgroups of order 7. For any two distinct subgroups $C_i, C_j \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, their intersection is just the identity element, $C_i \\cap C_j = \\{e\\}$.\n\n    The set $A$ must contain an element from each of these subgroups. Since $e \\in A$, we need to ensure that for every $C \\in \\mathcal{C}_7$, $A \\cap (C \\setminus \\{e\\}) \\neq \\emptyset$. Let $a_C$ be an element in $A \\cap (C \\setminus \\{e\\})$. If $C_i \\neq C_j$, then $a_{C_i} \\in C_i$ and $a_{C_j} \\in C_j$. If $a_{C_i} = a_{C_j}$, this element would be in $C_i \\cap C_j = \\{e\\}$, which contradicts that these elements are not the identity. Therefore, $A$ must contain at least one distinct non-identity element for each of the $N_7$ subgroups of order 7.\n\n    This establishes a lower bound for the size of $A$: $|A| \\ge 1 + N_7 = 1 + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\n3.  **Constructing a minimal set A:** We can construct a set $A$ with this size and show that it satisfies the condition for all cyclic subgroups. Let's define $A$ to be composed of the identity element $e$ and one non-identity element from each cyclic subgroup of order 7.\n    *   Let $\\mathcal{C}_7 = \\{C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_{N_7}\\}$.\n    *   Choose one element $a_i \\in C_i \\setminus \\{e\\}$ for each $i=1, \\dots, N_7$.\n    *   Let $A = \\{e\\} \\cup \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_{N_7}\\}$.\n    As argued before, all $a_i$ are distinct, so $|A| = 1 + N_7$.\n\n4.  **Verification:** Now we verify that this set $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of $G$.\n    *   **Order 1:** The only subgroup of order 1 is $\\{e\\}$, which is hit since $e \\in A$.\n    *   **Order 7:** Any cyclic subgroup of order 7 is one of the $C_i$ in our collection. By construction, $A$ contains an element $a_i$ from each $C_i$.\n    *   **Order 49:** Let $\\langle g \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 49. The element $h = 7g$ has order 7. Thus, $\\langle h \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 7. By our construction, there is an element $a \\in A$ such that $a \\in \\langle h \\rangle$. Since $\\langle h \\rangle = \\langle 7g \\rangle \\subset \\langle g \\rangle$, it follows that $a \\in \\langle g \\rangle$. Therefore, $A$ intersects every cyclic subgroup of order 49.\n\nSince we have established a lower bound for the size of $A$ and constructed a set of that size which meets all the conditions, the minimal size of $A$ is $1 + \\frac{7^{2024} - 1}{6}$.\n\nThis can be simplified to $\\frac{6 + 7^{2024} - 1}{6} = \\frac{7^{2024} + 5}{6}$.\n\n<<<1 + (7^2024 - 1)/6>>>"
