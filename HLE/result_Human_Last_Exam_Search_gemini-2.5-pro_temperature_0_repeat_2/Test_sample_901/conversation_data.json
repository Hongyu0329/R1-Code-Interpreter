    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. For this reaction to occur, the hydrogen atom and the bromine atom must be in an anti-periplanar (anti-diaxial) conformation.\n\nIn the (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a *trans* isomer, the more stable chair conformation has both the bromo group and the methyl group in equatorial positions. For the E2 elimination to proceed, the molecule must flip to its less stable conformation, where both groups are in axial positions.\n\nWhen the bromine atom is in the axial position, the hydrogen atom on the same carbon as the methyl group (C2) is in an equatorial position. Therefore, it is not anti-periplanar to the bromine and cannot be eliminated.\n\nHowever, one of the hydrogen atoms on C6 is in an axial position, making it anti-periplanar to the axial bromine atom. The bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract this proton, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\nThis results in the formation of 3-methylcyclohexene. The other possible product, 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product), cannot be formed due to the stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction mechanism. The use of a bulky base like potassium tert-butoxide also favors the formation of the less substituted alkene, which is 3-methylcyclohexene (the Hofmann product).\n\nTherefore, the product of the reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
