    "## Zapotec Civilization Holds Record for Earliest Known Date in the Americas\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"1 Earthquake,\" inscribed by the Zapotec civilization around 600 BCE. This significant historical marker is found on Monument 3, a carved stone slab discovered at the archaeological site of San José Mogote in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico.\n\nThe glyphs on Monument 3 are widely interpreted by archaeologists as representing a day in the 260-day ritual calendar used by Mesoamerican cultures. The inscription consists of a numeral '1' represented by a single dot, and a glyph depicting an earthquake. This combination signifies a specific day that could have been the name of a sacrificed captive depicted on the monument, a common practice in the region.\n\nWhile other artifacts from civilizations like the Olmec have been dated to earlier periods, the Zapotec monument from San José Mogote holds the distinction of bearing the earliest widely accepted *calendrical date* recorded in a true writing system. For instance, the Olmec Cascajal Block, dated to around 900 BCE, is a candidate for the oldest writing in the Americas, but its inscriptions are not calendrical. Another Olmec artifact, the San Andrés cylinder seal from circa 650 BCE, has been interpreted by some to contain the date \"3 Ajaw,\" but this reading is debated among scholars, with some suggesting the glyphs are iconographic rather than a written date.\n\nFurther solidifying the Zapotec's early use of calendrical writing are Stelae 12 and 13 from Monte Albán, another major Zapotec center. These monuments, dated to between 500 and 400 BCE, also feature calendrical inscriptions. One speculative interpretation of Stela 12 even suggests a specific Calendar Round date of 594 BCE.\n\nIn contrast, the earliest confirmed Maya calendrical inscription, the \"7 Deer\" glyph found at San Bartolo, Guatemala, dates to a later period, between 300 and 200 BCE. Therefore, based on current archaeological evidence and scholarly consensus, the Zapotec of San José Mogote were the first known civilization in the Americas to record a specific date in their writing system.\n\n<<<1 Earthquake>>>"
