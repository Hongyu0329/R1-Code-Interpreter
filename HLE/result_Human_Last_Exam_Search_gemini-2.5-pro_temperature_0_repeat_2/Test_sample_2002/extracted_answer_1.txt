The second player has a winning strategy if and only if the total number of tokens, $T$, is a Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by $F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1$, and $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n > 2$. The values of $T$ for which the second player wins are the numbers in this sequence (excluding the first term if we consider T>1): 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.
