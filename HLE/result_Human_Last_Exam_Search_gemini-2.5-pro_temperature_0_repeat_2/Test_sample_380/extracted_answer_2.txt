The local magnetic field is not considered radial when calculating the normalized magnetic helicity of Alfven ion cyclotron (AIC) waves at the L1 point; instead, the components of the magnetic field perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field are used. This is because AIC waves propagate along the local magnetic field, and at the L1 point, the magnetic field follows the Parker spiral, which is not radial.
