    "The A($\\alpha$) stability of a numerical method refers to the property that its stability region contains a wedge-shaped sector in the left half of the complex plane, symmetric with respect to the negative real axis, with a half-angle of $\\alpha$. The boundary of this sector makes an angle of $\\pi \\pm \\alpha$ with the positive real axis.\n\nFor the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) methods, the stability region is the set of complex numbers $z=h\\lambda$ (where $h$ is the step size and $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue of the linearized problem) for which the characteristic polynomial $\\rho(\\zeta) - z\\sigma(\\zeta) = 0$ has roots $\\zeta$ with magnitude less than or equal to one. The boundary of the stability region is given by the locus of points $z = \\rho(e^{i\\theta})/\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\nThe BDF4 method is a 4-step method. Its generating polynomials are $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j} \\zeta^{4-j}(\\zeta-1)^j$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^4$. The boundary of its stability region is given by $z(\\theta) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j}(1-e^{-i\\theta})^j$.\n\nThe exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method has been determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis. They found that the cosine squared of this angle is given by a precise formula. While older literature and numerical estimations often cite the angle to be approximately 73.35Â°, the exact analytical value leads to a different number. The formula for the cosine squared of the angle $\\alpha$ is:\n\n$\\cos^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{25 - \\sqrt{145}}{40}$\n\nFrom this, we can derive the exact value of $\\alpha$ in terms of the arctangent function. We use the identity $\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\sec^2(\\alpha) - 1 = \\frac{1}{\\cos^2(\\alpha)} - 1$.\n\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{40}{25 - \\sqrt{145}} - 1 = \\frac{40 - (25 - \\sqrt{145})}{25 - \\sqrt{145}} = \\frac{15 + \\sqrt{145}}{25 - \\sqrt{145}}$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we rationalize the denominator:\n\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{15 + \\sqrt{145}}{25 - \\sqrt{145}} \\times \\frac{25 + \\sqrt{145}}{25 + \\sqrt{145}} = \\frac{(15 + \\sqrt{145})(25 + \\sqrt{145})}{25^2 - (\\sqrt{145})^2}$\n$\\tan^2(\\alpha) = \\frac{375 + 15\\sqrt{145} + 25\\sqrt{145} + 145}{625 - 145} = \\frac{520 + 40\\sqrt{145}}{480} = \\frac{52 + 4\\sqrt{145}}{48} = \\frac{13 + \\sqrt{145}}{12}$\n\nTherefore, the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ is:\n\n$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{145}}{12}}\\right)$\n\nThis value corresponds to approximately 55.3 degrees, which differs from the commonly cited approximate value of 73.35 degrees. The work by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis provides the exact analytical value, which should be considered the precise answer.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{13 + \\sqrt{145}}{12}}\\right)$>>>"
