The best choice for the pair of step sizes $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2)$ is:
$\gamma_1 = \frac{4}{2(\kappa+1) - \sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}$
$\gamma_2 = \frac{4}{2(\kappa+1) + \sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}$

These can also be expressed as:
$\gamma_1 = \frac{4(\kappa+1) + 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}$
$\gamma_2 = \frac{4(\kappa+1) - 2\sqrt{2}(\kappa-1)}{\kappa^2+6\kappa+1}$

Here, $\kappa = M/\mu$ is the condition number of the function. The notation $S$ defined in the problem statement does not appear in the standard derivation of the optimal step sizes.
