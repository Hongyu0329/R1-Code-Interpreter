    "The Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence is a primary motif for the binding of numerous extracellular matrix proteins to integrin receptors. The amino acids that flank this core RGD sequence play a critical role in determining the binding affinity and specificity for different integrin subtypes.\n\nOf the choices provided, the peptide **RGDSPSS** is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor. The \"SP\" (Serine-Proline) sequence following the RGD motif is found in fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein and a natural ligand for several integrins, including the α5β1 integrin. Linear peptides containing the RGDSP sequence have been shown to be selective for the α5β1 integrin.\n\nWhile other peptides containing the RGD sequence can also bind to integrins, the flanking sequences determine the specificity and strength of this interaction. For instance:\n*   A study on Human Parechovirus 1 (HPeV1) identified the sequence **RGDMA** as part of the binding site for an antibody that likely competes with integrins for binding.\n*   The peptide RGDS has been documented as an integrin binding sequence that can inhibit integrin receptor function and promote cell attachment in vitro.\n\nHowever, the RGDSP sequence is a well-recognized motif from fibronectin known to mediate integrin binding.\n\n<<<B>>>"
