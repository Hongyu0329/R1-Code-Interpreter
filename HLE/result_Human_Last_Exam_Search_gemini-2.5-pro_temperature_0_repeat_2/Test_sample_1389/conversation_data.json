    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the formula 1 minus the incidence rate ratio (1-IRR) correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine Model:** This model assumes that the vaccine provides perfect protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while the rest receive no protection at all and remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals. For example, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would fully protect 80% of recipients, while the other 20% would have no protection.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate (new cases per person-time at risk) in the vaccinated group to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group.\n\n*   **Vaccine Efficacy (VE):** Vaccine efficacy is standardly calculated as 1 - IRR.\n\nIn an all-or-nothing scenario, the cases in the vaccinated group only occur in the fraction of people who were not protected. The fully protected fraction contributes zero cases. Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is proportionally lower than in the unvaccinated group, and this reduction is directly determined by the percentage of people who are fully protected.\n\nAs a result, the calculation `1 - IRR` yields a value that is mathematically equivalent to the proportion of the vaccinated population that is fully protected. This value also represents the average reduction in infection risk per exposure across the entire vaccinated population. Therefore, it correctly estimates the per-exposure efficacy.\n\nThis is distinct from a \"leaky\" vaccine, where every vaccinated person has the same partial reduction in their risk of infection upon each exposure. For both models, `1 - IRR` is the standard formula for efficacy, but its interpretation depends on the vaccine's mode of action.\n\n<<<C>>>"
