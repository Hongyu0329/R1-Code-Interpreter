    "There is no known genus of mushroom that produces a distinctly blue spore print. While several species of mushrooms exhibit a blue coloration of their cap or flesh, their spore prints are of different colors.\n\nFor instance, the strikingly blue *Lactarius indigo* produces a cream or pale yellowish spore print. Similarly, the *Entoloma hochstetteri*, a mushroom native to New Zealand and known for its vibrant blue color, has a reddish-pink or purplish to deep red-brown spore print.\n\nOther blue-hued mushrooms and their respective spore print colors include:\n*   ***Stropharia caerulea*** (Blue Roundhead): Purple-black or purple-brown spore print.\n*   ***Panaeolus cyanescens*** (Blue-staining Panaeolus): Black spore print.\n*   ***Cortinarius rotundisporus*** (Elegant Blue Webcap): Reddish-brown spore print.\n*   ***Psilocybe cyanescens*** (Wavy Caps): Very dark purple-brown spore print.\n\nThe color of a mushroom's spores is a critical characteristic for identification and does not necessarily correlate with the color of the mushroom itself.\n\n<<<There is no known mushroom genus that produces a distinctly blue spore print.>>>"
