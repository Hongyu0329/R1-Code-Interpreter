    "Under thermal conditions, the electrocyclic ring closure of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene is governed by the principles of Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory, which are summarized by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.\n\n1.  **Reaction Type and Electron Count**: The reaction is an electrocyclization of a conjugated tetraene, which is an 8π-electron system. According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for thermal reactions, systems with 4n π-electrons (where n=2 for an 8π system) undergo a conrotatory ring closure.\n\n2.  **Frontier Molecular Orbital (HOMO) Analysis**: For an 8π system under thermal conditions, the reaction is controlled by the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), which is ψ₄. In ψ₄ of the octatetraene system, the p-orbitals at the terminal carbons have lobes of opposite phase on the same side of the molecule. To achieve the necessary constructive (bonding) overlap to form a new σ-bond, the terminal carbons must rotate in the same direction—that is, a conrotatory motion.\n\n3.  **Stereochemistry of the Reactant**: The reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. For the cyclization to occur, the polyene must adopt an s-cis conformation. The stereochemistry of the substituents on the terminal carbons of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) determines the stereochemistry of the product.\n    *   At the C2 position, the double bond has *Z* configuration, which places the methyl group pointing \"inward\" in the reactive conformation.\n    *   At the C9 position, the double bond has *E* configuration, which places the methyl group pointing \"outward\".\n\n4.  **Predicting the Product of the Allowed Pathway**: During a conrotatory ring closure, both terminal groups rotate in the same direction (either both clockwise or both counter-clockwise). When applied to the \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\) isomer, the \"inward\" methyl group at C2 and the \"outward\" methyl group at C9 will both rotate to the same face of the newly forming ring. This stereospecific process leads exclusively to the formation of the *cis*-isomer (A), which is *cis*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\n5.  **The Formation of the \"Forbidden\" Product**: The formation of the *trans*-isomer (B) would require a disrotatory ring closure. This pathway is deemed \"symmetry-forbidden\" under thermal conditions. According to FMO theory, a disrotatory motion would force the out-of-phase lobes of the HOMO to overlap, creating an anti-bonding interaction in the transition state. This leads to a significantly higher activation energy barrier for the disrotatory pathway compared to the conrotatory one.\n\n6.  **Predicting the Ratio of Products A and B**: The ratio of the products is determined by the difference in the activation free energies (ΔΔG‡) between the allowed (conrotatory) and forbidden (disrotatory) pathways.\n    *   **Product A (*cis*-isomer)** is formed via the low-energy, symmetry-allowed conrotatory pathway.\n    *   **Product B (*trans*-isomer)** is formed via the high-energy, symmetry-forbidden disrotatory pathway.\n\nBecause the activation energy for the allowed path is much lower than for the forbidden path, the rate of formation of product A will be vastly greater than the rate of formation of product B. Such reactions are known to be highly stereospecific, often yielding the allowed product almost exclusively. While a precise numerical ratio cannot be determined without specific energetic data, FMO theory predicts that the ratio of A to B will be very large. The formation of the forbidden product B, if it occurs at all, will be negligible.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of A:B is predicted to be extremely high, heavily favoring the *cis*-isomer A.\n\n<<<The ratio of A:B will be very large (A >> B), as A is the symmetry-allowed product and B is the symmetry-forbidden product."
