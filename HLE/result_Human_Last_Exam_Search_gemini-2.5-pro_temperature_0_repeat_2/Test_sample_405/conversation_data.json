    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four main colors: white (which can also appear colorless or yellow), red, violet, and black.\n\nThe most common allotropes and their corresponding colors are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is a translucent, waxy solid. When pure, it is colorless, but it is more commonly seen as white or with a yellowish tint due to impurities or exposure to light, which causes it to slowly convert to red phosphorus. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is an amorphous or crystalline powder. Its color can vary from a deep red to a reddish-violet or even orange-red. Some forms can also have an iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this is a crystalline and more stable form. It is described as having a violet or red-purple color. It can also appear as purple-red or red-brown flakes with a metallic luster.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** This is the most thermodynamically stable form of phosphorus and has a structure similar to graphite. It is a black, flaky solid with a metallic luster.\n\nWhile other allotropes like blue phosphorus and diphosphorus exist, their observation as distinct, stable, bulk colors is less common. Therefore, the observable colors for the primary pure allotropes of phosphorus are white/yellow, red, violet, and black.\n\n<<<4>>>"
