    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches hosts on the networks 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19, we first need to analyze the IP address ranges of these networks.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Networks:**\n    *   **Network 1:** 172.20.96.0/19 has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. This network includes IP addresses from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.127.255.\n    *   **Network 2:** 172.20.128.0/19 also has a subnet mask of 255.255.224.0. This network includes IP addresses from 172.20.128.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\n2.  **Combine the Ranges:**\n    The goal is to find a single ACL entry that covers both of these address ranges. The combined range of IP addresses is from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n\n3.  **Summarization (Supernetting):**\n    We need to find a summary address and wildcard mask that covers this entire range as precisely as possible. This process is also known as supernetting.\n\n    *   First, we convert the starting and ending IP addresses of the combined range into binary, focusing on the octet where the range begins and ends (the third octet):\n        *   Start of range (96): `01100000`\n        *   End of range (159): `10011111`\n\n    *   Next, we find the common bits from the left.\n        *   96:  `01100000`\n        *   128: `10000000` (The start of the second network)\n        The first bits of the third octet are different (0 vs. 1). This indicates that the summary must begin at a higher-level bit, which is the last bit of the second octet.\n\n    *   Let's look at the full IP addresses in binary to find the longest common prefix:\n        *   `172.20.96.0`: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   `172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n    *   The first 17 bits (`10101100.00010100.0`) are common to both network addresses. The 18th bit is where they differ. This means the summary route will have a /17 prefix.\n\n4.  **Determine the ACL Entry:**\n    *   **Network Address:** To find the network address for the summary route, we take the common 17 bits and set the remaining bits to 0.\n        `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` which translates to `172.20.0.0`.\n\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** A /17 prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.128.0`. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n        *   Subnet Mask: `255.255.128.0`\n        *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.127.255`\n\n    This summary route, `172.20.0.0/17`, covers the IP range from 172.20.0.0 to 172.20.127.255. This range includes the first network (172.20.96.0/19) but not the second (172.20.128.0/19).\n\n    Let's re-examine the summarization. The two networks, 172.20.96.0/19 and 172.20.128.0/19, are adjacent blocks that can be perfectly summarized into a single larger block.\n    *   The combined range is 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n    *   Let's look at the binary representation of the third octet for the start of this combined block:\n        *   96: `01100000`\n    *   The combined block contains 2 * (2^13) = 2^14 addresses, which corresponds to a /18 prefix (32 - 14 = 18).\n    *   A /18 network has a subnet mask of `255.255.192.0`.\n    *   The network address for this summary is found by taking the starting address `172.20.96.0` and applying the /18 mask.\n        *   `172.20.96.0` AND `255.255.192.0` = `172.20.64.0`.\n    *   The summary route `172.20.64.0/18` covers the range 172.20.64.0 to 172.20.127.255. This does not cover the second network.\n\n    There seems to be a misunderstanding in manual calculation. Let's reconsider the initial binary comparison.\n    *   `172.20.96.0` -> `...01100000...`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` -> `...10000000...`\n    The common prefix is indeed /17, leading to `172.20.0.0/17` which covers the first network, and `172.20.128.0/17` which covers the second. To cover both, we would need an even larger summary.\n\n    Let's find the smallest single CIDR block that contains *both* ranges (172.20.96.0-172.20.127.255 and 172.20.128.0-172.20.159.255). The total range is 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255.\n    *   Start: `172.20.01100000.0`\n    *   End:   `172.20.10011111.255`\n    The common prefix of the start and end addresses is `172.20.` followed by the common bits of `01100000` and `10011111`. There are no common leading bits in the third octet. This means the summary mask must be /16.\n    *   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n    *   Mask: /16 or `255.255.0.0`\n    *   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n    This entry `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255` covers the entire 172.20.0.0/16 block, which is much larger than required but is the smallest *single* standard ACL entry that contains both specified networks.\n\nHowever, if we can use a non-contiguous wildcard mask (which some advanced ACLs allow), we might find a more precise fit. But for a standard ACL entry, we must find the smallest summary route. The two networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19` can be perfectly summarized into `172.20.64.0/17` is incorrect. They can be summarized into `172.20.0.0/16` as shown above.\n\nLet's re-verify the summarization of `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\nThese are two adjacent /19 blocks. Together they form a /18 block.\nThe network address of this /18 block is the same as the first /19 block, which is `172.20.96.0`.\nSo the summary is `172.20.96.0/18`.\n*   **Network Address:** `172.20.96.0`\n*   **Subnet Mask for /18:** `255.255.192.0`\n*   **Wildcard Mask:** `0.0.63.255`\nThis ACL entry `172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255` covers the IP range from 172.20.96.0 to 172.20.159.255, which perfectly matches the combined range of the two original networks.\n\n<<<172.20.96.0 0.0.63.255>>>"
