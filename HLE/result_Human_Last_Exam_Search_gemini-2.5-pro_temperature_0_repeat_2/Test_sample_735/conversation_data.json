    "There are **26** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for any two elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also referred to as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nA complete classification of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 was achieved by C. S. Anabanti and S. B. Hart. They proved that if a finite group *G* has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3, then the order of *G* must be at most 24. Their work provides a complete list of all such groups.\n\nThe 26 finite groups are:\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C_7, C_10, C_12, C_13, C_14, C_15, C_18, C_20, C_21, C_22, C_24\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D_10, D_12, D_14, D_18, D_20, D_22, D_24\n*   **Generalized Quaternion Groups:** Q_12, Q_20, Q_24\n*   **Abelian Groups (non-cyclic):** C_2 x C_6, C_2 x C_12\n*   **Alternating Group:** A_4\n*   **Special Linear Group:** SL(2,3)\n*   **Other:** AGL(1,5) (the affine general linear group of degree 1 over the field with 5 elements)\n\n<<<26>>>"
