    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions, specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the dynamics of the coupling constant *u* under changes in the energy scale are governed by the beta function, β(u). The fixed points of the theory are the values of the coupling constant for which the beta function is zero, indicating that the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale.\n\nTo the leading order in the coupling *u* and for a small positive ϵ, the one-loop beta function for the renormalized coupling *u* in the minimal subtraction scheme is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u²\n\nA non-trivial fixed point, denoted as u*, is found by setting the beta function to zero:\n\nβ(u*) = 0\n-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0\n\nThis equation has two solutions. One is the trivial Gaussian fixed point at u* = 0. The other is the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is of interest here. Solving for the non-zero u*, we get:\n\nu* = (16π² / 3)ϵ\n\nThis expression gives the leading order value of the fixed point coupling in terms of ϵ. This fixed point is only physically accessible for ϵ > 0, which corresponds to dimensions d < 4. It plays a crucial role in the study of critical phenomena, such as the liquid-gas transition and ferromagnetic phase transitions.\n\n<<<u* = (16π² / 3)ϵ>>>"
