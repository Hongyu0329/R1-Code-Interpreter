    "To determine the smallest number of edges `e` for a simple, connected graph `γ` with an automorphism group `Aut(γ)` of order 3, we need to understand the structural properties such a graph must possess.\n\n### Properties of a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3`\n\n1.  **Group Structure**: The automorphism group being of order 3 means it is the cyclic group of order 3, let's call it `C_3`. This group consists of the identity automorphism (`id`), an automorphism `φ`, and its inverse `φ^2`, such that `φ^3 = id`.\n\n2.  **Vertex Orbits**: The automorphism group acts on the set of vertices `V` of the graph. This action partitions `V` into disjoint orbits. The size of each orbit must be a divisor of the order of the group, which is 3. Therefore, the vertices of `γ` are partitioned into orbits of size 1 (fixed points) and orbits of size 3.\n\n3.  **Existence of a 3-orbit**: If all vertices were in orbits of size 1 (i.e., fixed by all automorphisms), the only automorphism would be the identity. This would mean `|Aut(γ)|=1`. Consequently, there must be at least one orbit of size 3.\n\n4.  **Minimum Number of Vertices**: The presence of at least one orbit of size 3 implies that the graph must have at least 3 vertices. Let's analyze graphs with a small number of vertices:\n    *   **n < 3**: Not possible.\n    *   **n = 3**: The only simple graphs are the complete graph `K_3` (a triangle) and its complement `3K_1` (three isolated vertices). The automorphism group of both is the symmetric group `S_3`, which has order `3! = 6`.\n    *   **n = 4, 5, 6...**: We need to construct a graph that has an automorphism of order 3 but is rigid enough to prevent any other symmetries (like reflections or transpositions).\n\nIt has been established in graph theory literature that the smallest graph `γ` with `|Aut(γ)|=3` has 9 vertices. Let's confirm this and find the number of edges.\n\n### Minimum Number of Edges\n\nA graph with a non-trivial automorphism group of odd order cannot be a tree. A tree's automorphism group of odd order must be the trivial group of order 1. This means our graph `γ` must contain at least one cycle. For a connected graph with `n` vertices, this implies the number of edges `e` must be at least `n`.\n\nSince the minimum number of vertices is 9, the minimum number of edges must be at least 9. Now, we need to construct a simple, connected graph `γ` on 9 vertices with `|Aut(γ)|=3` and `e=9` edges.\n\n### Construction of a candidate graph with 9 vertices and 9 edges\n\nLet's build a graph with 9 vertices, partitioned into three orbits of size 3. Let the orbits be `O_1 = {1, 2, 3}`, `O_2 = {4, 5, 6}`, and `O_3 = {7, 8, 9}`. The non-identity automorphism `φ` acts as a 3-cycle on each orbit: `φ = (1 2 3)(4 5 6)(7 8 9)`.\n\nWe need to add edges in a way that `φ` is an automorphism, but no other symmetries exist. The edges themselves must be partitioned into orbits of size 3. An orbit of edges is a set of three edges that are permuted cyclically by `φ`.\n\nLet's define three orbits of edges:\n1.  **`E_1`**: Edges forming a triangle on the vertices of `O_1`.\n    `E_1 = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}}`. (3 edges)\n2.  **`E_2`**: Edges connecting `O_2` to `O_3`. Let's make this a simple matching.\n    `E_2 = {{4, 7}, {5, 8}, {6, 9}}`. (3 edges)\n3.  **`E_3`**: Edges connecting `O_3` to `O_1`. To break symmetry, we introduce a \"twist\".\n    `E_3 = {{7, 2}, {8, 3}, {9, 1}}`. (3 edges)\n\nThe graph `γ` has `V = O_1 ∪ O_2 ∪ O_3` and `E = E_1 ∪ E_2 ∪ E_3`.\n*   **Number of vertices `v`**: 9\n*   **Number of edges `e`**: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9\n\n**Properties of this graph:**\n*   **Connectivity**: The subgraph on `O_1` is connected. `O_3` is connected to `O_1`. `O_2` is connected to `O_3`. Thus, the entire graph is connected.\n*   **Simplicity**: There are no loops or multiple edges by construction.\n*   **Automorphism Group**:\n    *   The automorphism `φ = (1 2 3)(4 5 6)(7 8 9)` is a symmetry by construction. For example, `φ({1,2}) = {2,3}` which is an edge, and `φ({9,1}) = {7,2}` which is also an edge. This ensures `|Aut(γ)|` is at least 3.\n    *   We must show there are no other automorphisms. The vertex degrees are:\n        *   `d(1)=d(2)=d(3)=3` (2 in `O_1`, 1 from `O_3`)\n        *   `d(4)=d(5)=d(6)=1` (1 from `O_3`)\n        *   `d(7)=d(8)=d(9)=2` (1 from `O_2`, 1 from `O_1`)\n    *   Since the three orbits have distinct degree sets (`{3}`, `{1}`, `{2}`), any automorphism must map each orbit to itself.\n    *   Let `ψ` be an automorphism. `ψ` must map `O_1` to `O_1`, `O_2` to `O_2`, and `O_3` to `O_3`.\n    *   The restriction of `ψ` to `O_1`, `ψ|O_1`, must be an automorphism of the induced subgraph on `O_1` (which is `K_3`). So `ψ|O_1` must be in `S_3`.\n    *   Let's test if a transposition like `τ = (1 2)` on `O_1` can be extended to a full automorphism. `τ` would have to fix `O_2` and `O_3` element-wise to preserve the edges in `E_2` and `E_3` that connect to the fixed vertex `3`. For instance, `τ({8,3}) = {8,3}` implies `τ(8)=8`. But `τ({9,1}) = {τ(9), 2}` must be an edge. `τ` must fix `9` since `9`'s neighbor `6` is fixed, and `6`'s neighbor `3` is fixed. So `τ(9)=9`. This would mean `{9,2}` is an edge, but it is not. Thus, no transposition on `O_1` can be extended to an automorphism.\n    *   This reasoning restricts `ψ|O_1` to be a cyclic permutation. If `ψ|O_1` is the identity, then `ψ` must be the identity everywhere. If `ψ|O_1 = (1 2 3)`, then `ψ` must be `φ`. If `ψ|O_1 = (1 3 2)`, then `ψ` must be `φ^2`.\n    *   Therefore, the automorphism group is ` {id, φ, φ^2} `, which has order 3.\n\nWe have found a simple, connected graph with 9 vertices and 9 edges whose automorphism group has order 3. Since a graph with `|Aut(γ)|=3` must have at least 9 vertices, and a connected graph on 9 vertices that is not a tree must have at least 9 edges, this is the smallest possible number of edges.\n\n"
