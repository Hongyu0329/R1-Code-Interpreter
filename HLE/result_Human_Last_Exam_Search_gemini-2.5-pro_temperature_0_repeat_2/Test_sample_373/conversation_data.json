    "To determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in randomized uniform gossiping on a barbell graph with 10 nodes, we first need to understand the structure of the graph and the gossiping mechanism.\n\n### 1. Structure of a 10-Node Barbell Graph\n\nA barbell graph is constructed by connecting two identical complete graphs (cliques) with a single edge, known as the bridge or bottleneck. For a 10-node barbell graph, this means we have two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5).\n\n*   **Nodes:** The graph has a total of N = 10 nodes. Let's denote the two cliques as C1 and C2, each containing 5 nodes.\n*   **Edges:**\n    *   Within each K5 clique, every node is connected to every other node. The number of edges in a single K5 is given by the formula n(n-1)/2, which is 5(4)/2 = 10 edges.\n    *   There is one additional edge, the bottleneck edge, that connects one node from C1 to one node from C2.\n*   **Total Edges:** The total number of edges in the graph is 10 (in C1) + 10 (in C2) + 1 (bottleneck) = 21 edges.\n\n### 2. Node Degrees\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In our barbell graph:\n*   Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` in C1 and node `v` in C2.\n*   **Nodes `u` and `v`:** These two nodes are connected to 4 other nodes within their own clique and 1 node in the other clique. Therefore, their degree is 4 + 1 = 5.\n*   **Other Nodes:** The remaining 8 nodes (4 in each clique) are only connected to the other 4 nodes within their respective cliques. Therefore, their degree is 4.\n\nSo, the graph has 2 nodes with a degree of 5 and 8 nodes with a degree of 4.\n\n### 3. Randomized Uniform Gossiping\n\nRandomized uniform gossiping is a process where at each step:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from the entire set of N nodes. The probability of selecting any specific node is 1/N.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors to communicate with, also uniformly at random. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor is 1/degree(node).\n\n### 4. Calculating the Probability\n\nThe bottleneck edge `{u, v}` is \"sampled\" if the gossiping step involves communication across this edge. This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  Node `u` is selected and it chooses to gossip with node `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is selected and it chooses to gossip with node `u`.\n\nLet's calculate the probability of each case:\n\n*   **Case 1: Node `u` gossips with `v`**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `u` is P(u) = 1/10.\n    *   Given that `u` is selected, the probability of it choosing `v` is P(v|u) = 1/degree(u) = 1/5.\n    *   The total probability for this case is P(u) * P(v|u) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\n*   **Case 2: Node `v` gossips with `u`**\n    *   The probability of selecting node `v` is P(v) = 1/10.\n    *   Given that `v` is selected, the probability of it choosing `u` is P(u|v) = 1/degree(v) = 1/5.\n    *   The total probability for this case is P(v) * P(u|v) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two cases:\n\nP(bottleneck) = P(Case 1) + P(Case 2) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nTherefore, the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is 1/25.\n\n<<<1/25"
