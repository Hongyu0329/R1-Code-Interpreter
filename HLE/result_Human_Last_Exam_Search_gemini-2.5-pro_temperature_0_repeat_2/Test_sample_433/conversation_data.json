    "The Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment is for **immediate use only**. Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be stored for any period and must be used right away. Any remaining contents should be discarded and not used for another patient.\n\nThis guideline is consistently stated by various regulatory and professional bodies, including the United States Pharmacopeia (USP). The primary reason for this strict rule is that once an ampule is broken open, it becomes an open system, making it highly susceptible to contamination. Unlike multi-dose vials, single-dose containers typically do not contain antimicrobial preservatives, which increases the risk of microbial growth if not used immediately.\n\nIt is crucial to differentiate between single-dose ampules and single-dose vials. While both are intended for a single patient, the BUD for a single-dose *vial* after puncture in a sterile environment (such as an ISO Class 5 cleanroom) can be longer, often up to 6 or 12 hours, provided it remains in the sterile environment. However, for ampules, the guidance is unequivocal: they must be used immediately upon opening, regardless of the environment's sterility.\n\n<<<immediate use only>>>"
