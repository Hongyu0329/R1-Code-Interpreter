    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C1. This is based on the data provided by Eckard Specht's comprehensive catalogue of circle packings. In this catalogue, the packing for N=1135 is listed with a blank symmetry group field. According to the legend of the data tables, a blank field indicates that the packing has the symmetry element C1. A C1 symmetry group means that the arrangement is asymmetric and has no rotational or reflectional symmetry.\n\n<<<C1>>>"
