The appropriate management for this patient involves immediate wound care of the avulsed tooth sites, likely with socket preservation rather than replantation due to the 28-hour delay and her uncontrolled diabetes. A medical consultation to manage her diabetes is crucial before any surgical intervention. The finding of an SNB angle of 88‚Å∞ indicates a prognathic mandible, which must be considered in the prosthetic design. The cells of interest in her delayed healing process include neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts. For tooth replacement, a cast metal framework removable partial denture made of cobalt-chromium and acrylic is recommended. The abutment teeth would be the left first bicuspid as the primary abutment, with the right central incisor and right canine serving as secondary abutments to ensure stability and proper force distribution.
