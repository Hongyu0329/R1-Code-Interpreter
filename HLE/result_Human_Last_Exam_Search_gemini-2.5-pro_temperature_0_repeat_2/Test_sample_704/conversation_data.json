    "On Sir Isaac Newton's colour circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the colour produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nNewton's colour circle maps the seven colours of the visible spectrum to the notes of a musical scale. In his system, the colours are arranged in the order they appear in a rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. The colour produced by mixing yellow and blue pigments is green. Following the sequence on Newton's circle, green is the colour situated between yellow and blue.\n\nNewton associated these seven colours with the seven notes of the Dorian musical mode, starting on the note D. The specific correlations are:\n*   Red - D\n*   Orange - E\n*   Yellow - F\n*   **Green - G**\n*   Blue - A\n*   Indigo - B\n*   Violet - C\n\nTherefore, the range on the colour circle that falls between green (the combination of yellow and blue) and blue corresponds to the musical note **G**.\n\n<<<G>>>"
