The human voltage-gated calcium channel β1 subunit interacts with the α1 subunit via its Alpha-Binding Pocket (ABP) located in the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. Key residues for this interaction are hydrophobic, with specific Methionine and Leucine residues being critical. The fine-tuning of the α1 subunit's gating is modulated by the interplay of the GK, SH3, and HOOK domains of the β1 subunit. Specific residues in the HOOK domain, such as Serine 193 and Threonine 205 in the β1a isoform, are important for modulation through phosphorylation.
