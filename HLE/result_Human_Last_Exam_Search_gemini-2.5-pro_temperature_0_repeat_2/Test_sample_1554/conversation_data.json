    "The Lviv-Warsaw School philosopher who decomposes the notion of a sign into symptoms and signals is Tadeusz Kotarbiński.\n\nKotarbiński, a prominent member of the school, made significant contributions to various philosophical fields, including semiotics, the theory of signs. In his work, he distinguished between different types of signs based on the nature of the connection between the sign and what it signifies.\n\nAccording to his classification, signs can be broadly divided into two main categories: symptoms and signals.\n\n*   **Symptoms** are signs that have a natural, causal connection to what they indicate. For example, a fever is a symptom of an illness.\n*   **Signals**, on the other hand, are signs that are established by convention or agreement. These can be further divided into asemantic appeals and semantic signals. An example of a signal would be a traffic light, where the colors have a conventional meaning for drivers.\n\nThis distinction was part of the broader effort within the Lviv-Warsaw School to bring clarity and precision to philosophical and scientific language through logical and conceptual analysis.\n\n<<<Tadeusz Kotarbiński>>>"
