    "The Crayola crayon color that likely contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is a fluorescent pink, with **Shocking Pink** and **Razzle Dazzle Rose** being the most probable candidates.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as **Rhodamine B**. This substance is a fluorescent dye with a vibrant pink or reddish-violet hue.\n\nWhile the precise formulas for Crayola crayons are proprietary, they are primarily composed of paraffin wax and colored pigments. Crayola has produced a range of fluorescent crayons, including colors like \"Shocking Pink,\" \"Razzle Dazzle Rose,\" and \"Screamin' Green.\" Given that Rhodamine B is a well-known fluorescent pink dye, it is logical to infer its use in one of Crayola's fluorescent pink crayons.\n\nThe name \"Shocking Pink\" was introduced by Crayola in 1972 (originally as \"Ultra Pink\") and is part of their fluorescent crayon line. Although a direct confirmation from Crayola is unavailable, a safety data sheet for another brand of crayons, \"Luckyart Crayon,\" indicates that Rhodamine B may be used depending on the color. This demonstrates the use of this pigment within the crayon industry.\n\nTherefore, based on the properties of Rhodamine B and the color names of Crayola's fluorescent crayons, \"Shocking Pink\" or \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" are the most likely to contain this chemical.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink or Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
