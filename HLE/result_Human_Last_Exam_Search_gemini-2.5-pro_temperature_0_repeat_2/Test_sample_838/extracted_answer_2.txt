The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**IUPAC Name:** 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane. An alternative, though less common, name is (4-bromobutyl)benzene.

**Chirality:** The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is **achiral**. A molecule is chiral if it contains a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) and is non-superimposable on its mirror image. In 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, no carbon atom is bonded to four different groups, and therefore, it does not have a chiral center. The chirality present in the starting material, (3S)-3-bromo-1-phenylbutane, was eliminated in the first step of the reaction sequence with the formation of the alkene, product A.
