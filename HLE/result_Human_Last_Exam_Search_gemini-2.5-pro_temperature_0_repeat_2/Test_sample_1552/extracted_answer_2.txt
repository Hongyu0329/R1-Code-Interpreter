The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is given by the integral of the following local density:
`a_2(x) = \text{tr} \left( -\frac{1}{12} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{360} R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}R^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma} + \frac{1}{30} R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{72} R^2 \right)`
where `F_{\mu\nu}` is the gauge field strength, `R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}` is the Riemann curvature tensor, `R_{\mu\nu}` is the Ricci tensor, `R` is the scalar curvature, and the trace is over the spinor and gauge indices.
