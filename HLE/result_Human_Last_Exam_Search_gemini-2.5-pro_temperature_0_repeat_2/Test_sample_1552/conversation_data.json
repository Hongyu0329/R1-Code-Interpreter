    "### Second Coefficient of the Heat Kernel Expansion for a Massless Gauged Dirac Spinor Field\n\nThe second coefficient, denoted as `a_2`, in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four dimensions is a crucial quantity in quantum field theory and noncommutative geometry. It is a local geometric invariant built from the background curvature and the gauge field strength.\n\nThe spectral action is given by the trace of a function of the squared Dirac operator, `Tr[f(D^2/\\Lambda^2)]`, where `D` is the gauged Dirac operator, `D = \\gamma^\\mu(\\partial_\\mu + \\omega_\\mu - iA_\\mu)`. The heat kernel expansion arises from the asymptotic expansion of `Tr[exp(-tD^2)]` for small `t`. The coefficients of this expansion are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients, `a_n`.\n\nThe second coefficient, `a_2`, is given by the integral of a local density `a_2(x)` over the manifold. For a massless Dirac spinor coupled to a gauge field, the formula for `a_2(x)` is obtained by specializing the general formula for a second-order differential operator of the Laplace type.\n\nThe square of the gauged Dirac operator is:\n`D^2 = -(\\nabla^2 \\cdot 1 + E)`\nwhere `\\nabla^2` is the connection Laplacian, and the endomorphism `E` is given by:\n`E = \\frac{1}{4}R \\cdot 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu F_{\\mu\\nu}`\nHere, `R` is the scalar curvature, and `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the gauge field strength tensor.\n\nThe general formula for the trace of the `a_2` coefficient for an operator of the form `-(\\nabla^2 + E)` is:\n`Tr(a_2) = \\frac{1}{360} \\int d^4x \\sqrt{g} \\text{tr} \\left( 60 R E + 180 E^2 + 5 R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} - 2 R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} + 2 R^2 \\right)`\n\nSubstituting the expression for `E` for the Dirac operator and taking the trace over the spinor indices (where `tr(1) = 4` and `tr(\\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu \\gamma^\\rho \\gamma^\\sigma) = 4(g^{\\mu\\nu}g^{\\rho\\sigma} - g^{\\mu\\rho}g^{\\nu\\sigma} + g^{\\mu\\sigma}g^{\\nu\\rho})`), we obtain the final expression for the second coefficient `a_2`.\n\nAfter performing the algebraic calculations, the resulting formula for the trace of the second Seeley-DeWitt coefficient `a_2` for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field in four dimensions is:\n\n`a_2 = \\text{Tr} \\left( -\\frac{1}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} \\cdot 1 - \\frac{1}{24} C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}C^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} \\cdot 1 + \\frac{11}{720} R^2 \\cdot 1 \\right)`\n\nwhere `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the field strength of the gauge field and `C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}` is the Weyl curvature tensor. The trace is taken over the internal gauge group indices.\n\nFor a U(1) gauge theory, the expression simplifies to:\n`a_2 = -\\frac{N}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{N}{24} C_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}C^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{11N}{720} R^2`\nwhere N is the number of fermions.\n\n<<<The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field is given by the integral of the following local density:\n`a_2(x) = \\text{tr} \\left( -\\frac{1}{12} F_{\\mu\\nu}F^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{360} R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}R^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma} + \\frac{1}{30} R_{\\mu\\nu}R^{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{72} R^2 \\right)`\nwhere `F_{\\mu\\nu}` is the gauge field strength, `R_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}` is the Riemann curvature tensor, `R_{\\mu\\nu}` is the Ricci tensor, `R` is the scalar curvature, and the trace is over the spinor and gauge indices.>>>"
