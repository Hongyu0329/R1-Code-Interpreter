    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning.\n\n1.  **What is the convex hull of the great icosahedron?**\n    The search results state that \"The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron\".\n\n2.  **What does \"triangulating the outer-hull\" mean?**\n    The \"outer-hull\" is the convex hull. Triangulation means dividing a surface into a set of triangles. Since the convex hull is a regular icosahedron, its faces are already triangles. Therefore, the minimal triangulation is the set of its own faces.\n\n3.  **How many faces does a regular icosahedron have?**\n    A regular icosahedron has 20 faces, and these faces are equilateral triangles.\n\nThe \"visible triangles from the outside\" corresponds to the faces of the convex hull. The great icosahedron itself has 20 intersecting triangular faces, many of which are mostly hidden inside the polyhedron. The parts of these faces that are visible are called \"facelets\", and there are 180 of them. However, the question asks for the triangulation of the *outer-hull*, which is the convex hull.\n\nThe convex hull is a regular icosahedron, which is composed of 20 triangular faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer hull is 20.\n\nFinal answer seems to be 20.\nI am ready to write the final answer.\nThe minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is the number of faces of its convex hull.\nThe convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\nA regular icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.\nTherefore, the answer is 20.The minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of faces on its convex hull. The convex hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid composed of 20 equilateral triangular faces. Therefore, the surface of the outer hull is already triangulated by its own faces. The minimal number of triangles required is simply the number of these faces.\n\nThe great icosahedron itself has 20 intersecting triangular faces, with large portions of them being internal to the polyhedron. The visible portions from the outside are numerous small triangular regions called \"facelets\". However, the question specifically asks for the triangulation of the *outer-hull*.\n\nThus, the number of visible triangles from the outside, in the context of triangulating the convex hull, is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
