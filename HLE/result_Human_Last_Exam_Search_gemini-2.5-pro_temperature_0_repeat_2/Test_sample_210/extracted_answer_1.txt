There is no exact figure for the number of destitute migrants who settled in the Talbot Settlement between 1803 and 1823, as records did not categorize settlers in this way and their economic backgrounds were varied. However, the settlement grew from 20 families in the first five years to 804 families by 1817. By 1821, Colonel Talbot had increased his personal land holdings from an initial 5,000-acre grant to over 65,000 acres, making the acreage he claimed at least 60,000 acres larger than the original grant.
