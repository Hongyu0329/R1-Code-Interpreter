    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case when solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube with the CFOP method, a minimum of **7** non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\nThere are 21 distinct PLL cases, which are the different permutations of the last layer's edge and corner pieces. To distinguish between all of these cases, one must gather enough information from the side stickers of the last layer. The top-facing stickers are all of the same color and thus provide no useful information for permutation recognition.\n\nThe last layer has 12 side stickers in total: one on each of the four edge pieces and two on each of the four corner pieces. While looking at the stickers on two adjacent faces (a total of 6 unique stickers) is a common and effective method for PLL recognition for humans, it is not sufficient to differentiate every single case.\n\nSpecifically, the Ja and F permutations can present an identical view on two adjacent faces. To distinguish between these two specific cases, information from a third face is required. This means observing at least one additional sticker. A common solution is to observe the three stickers on the front face, the three stickers on the right face, and the single sticker of the back-left edge piece. This totals 7 stickers and provides enough information to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL cases.\n\nTherefore, while most cases can be identified with fewer stickers, a minimum of 7 is necessary to guarantee the unique identification of all possible PLL scenarios.\n\n<<<7>>>"
