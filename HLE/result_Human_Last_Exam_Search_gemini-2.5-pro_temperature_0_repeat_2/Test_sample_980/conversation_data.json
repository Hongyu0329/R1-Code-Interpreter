    "This sequence does not appear to be a standard mathematical sequence found in common databases. However, analyzing the structure of the sequence reveals a pattern based on groupings of numbers.\n\nThe sequence can be broken down into the following groups:\n*   (111, 142, 111) - An ABA pattern\n*   41\n*   (67, 67, 67) - An AAA pattern\n*   93\n*   (111, 111) - An AA pattern\n*   (62, 62) - An AA pattern\n*   (111, 111) - An AA pattern\n*   (36, 36) - An AA pattern\n*   (49, 155, 49) - An ABA pattern\n*   62\n*   (49, 49) - An AA pattern\n*   (62, 62) - An AA pattern\n*   10\n*   (36, 36, 36) - An AAA pattern\n*   (124, 124, 124) - An AAA pattern\n*   36\n*   124\n\nThe sequence ends with the numbers 36 and 124. Following the established patterns, this appears to be the beginning of a new group. The most plausible continuation is the formation of another ABA pattern, which would be (36, 124, 36). In this pattern, the middle number is larger than the two outer numbers, which is consistent with the other ABA patterns seen in the sequence.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence would be 36 to complete this pattern.\n\n<<<36>>>"
