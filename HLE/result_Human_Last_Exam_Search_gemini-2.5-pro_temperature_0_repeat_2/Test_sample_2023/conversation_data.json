    "The value of the expression is **-2,790,128,400,000,000**.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation of the result:\n\n### 1. Expressing f(a,b,c) with a Generating Function\n\nThe function `f(a,b,c)` is defined by the recurrence relation `f(a,b,c) = f(a-1,b,c) + f(a,b-2,c) + f(a,b,c-3)`, with the base case `f(0,0,0)=1`. This type of recurrence can be solved using a generating function `G(x,y,z) = Σ f(a,b,c)x^a y^b z^c`.\n\nFrom the recurrence, we can derive the closed-form for the generating function:\n`G(x,y,z) = 1 / (1 - x - y^2 - z^3)`\n\nThis can be expanded as a geometric series:\n`G(x,y,z) = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} (x + y^2 + z^3)^n`\n\nThe term `f(a,b,c)` is the coefficient of `x^a y^b z^c` in this expansion. Using the multinomial theorem, we find that `f(a,b,c)` is non-zero only if `b` is even and `c` is a multiple of 3. In that case, its value is the multinomial coefficient:\n`f(a,b,c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`\n\n### 2. Applying Lucas's Theorem\n\nWe need to compute `f(α_p, β_p, γ_p)` modulo the prime `p = 2^127 - 1`. This requires calculating a large multinomial coefficient modulo `p`. Lucas's Theorem provides a way to do this by using the base-`p` representations of the numbers involved.\n\nThe theorem states that for a multinomial coefficient `C(N; k_1, ..., k_m) mod p`:\n`C(N; k_1, ..., k_m) ≡ Π C(N_i; k_{1,i}, ..., k_{m,i}) (mod p)`\nwhere `N_i` and `k_{j,i}` are the corresponding digits in the base-`p` expansion. This holds if there are no \"carries\" in the base-`p` addition `k_1 + ... + k_m = N`.\n\n### 3. Base-p Expansion of the Parameters\n\nFirst, we must verify that `β_p` is even and `γ_p` is a multiple of 3.\n*   `β_p = Σ(8p^{3i} + 4p^{3i+1} + 4p^{3i+2})`: Each term in the sum is even, so `β_p` is even.\n*   `γ_p = Σ(3p^{3i} + 9p^{3i+1} + 12p^{3i+2}) = 3 * Σ(p^{3i} + 3p^{3i+1} + 4p^{3i+2})`: This is clearly a multiple of 3.\n\nLet `a' = α_p`, `b' = β_p/2`, and `c' = γ_p/3`. We need their base-`p` expansions. The coefficients in the sums defining `α_p`, `β_p`, and `γ_p` are all smaller than `p`, so the sums directly give the base-`p` digits.\n\n*   **Digits of `α_p` (let's call them `A_k`):**\n    `A_{3i}=1`, `A_{3i+1}=3`, `A_{3i+2}=4` for `i` from 0 to `(3p-1)/2`.\n\n*   **Digits of `β_p/2` (let's call them `B'_k`):**\n    `β_p/2 = Σ(4p^{3i} + 2p^{3i+1} + 2p^{3i+2})`\n    `B'_{3i}=4`, `B'_{3i+1}=2`, `B'_{3i+2}=2`.\n\n*   **Digits of `γ_p/3` (let's call them `C'_k`):**\n    `γ_p/3 = Σ(p^{3i} + 3p^{3i+1} + 4p^{3i+2}) = α_p`\n    So, `C'_k = A_k`.\n\nLet `N = α_p + β_p/2 + γ_p/3 = 2α_p + β_p/2`. The base-`p` digits of `N` are `N_k = 2A_k + B'_k`. Since the maximum value of `2A_k + B'_k` is `2*4 + 2 = 10`, which is less than `p`, there are no carries in the addition.\n\n### 4. Calculating the Product\n\nWe apply Lucas's Theorem by taking the product of the multinomial coefficients of the digits:\n`f(α_p, β_p, γ_p) ≡ Π_k C(N_k; A_k, B'_k, C'_k) ≡ Π_k C(2A_k + B'_k; A_k, B'_k, A_k) (mod p)`\n\nWe only need to consider the non-zero digits. The product is taken for `i` from 0 to `(3p-1)/2`.\n*   For `k = 3i`: `C(2*1+4; 1,4,1) = C(6; 1,4,1) = 6!/(1!4!1!) = 30`.\n*   For `k = 3i+1`: `C(2*3+2; 3,2,3) = C(8; 3,2,3) = 8!/(3!2!3!) = 560`.\n*   For `k = 3i+2`: `C(2*4+2; 4,2,4) = C(10; 4,2,4) = 10!/(4!2!4!) = 3150`.\n\nThe total number of values for `i` is `(3p-1)/2 + 1 = (3p+1)/2`. The final product is:\n`f(...) ≡ (30 * 560 * 3150)^{(3p+1)/2} (mod p)`\n\n### 5. Modular Exponentiation and Quadratic Reciprocity\n\nLet `X = 30 * 560 * 3150 = 52,920,000`. We need to compute `X^{(3p+1)/2} \\mod p`.\n`X^{(3p+1)/2} = X^{3(p-1)/2 + 2} = (X^{(p-1)/2})^3 * X^2`\n\nBy Euler's criterion, `X^{(p-1)/2} ≡ (X/p) (mod p)`, where `(X/p)` is the Legendre symbol.\nSo, `f(...) ≡ (X/p)^3 * X^2 ≡ (X/p) * X^2 (mod p)`.\n\nWe need to find the Legendre symbol `(X/p)`.\n`X = 2^6 * 3^3 * 5^4 * 7^2`.\n`(X/p) = (2^6 * 3^3 * 5^4 * 7^2 / p) = (2/p)^6 * (3/p)^3 * (5/p)^4 * (7/p)^2`.\nSince `(a^2/p) = 1`, this simplifies to `(X/p) = (3/p)`.\n\nWe use the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity to find `(3/p)` for `p = 2^{127}-1`.\n`(3/p) = (p/3) * (-1)^{((p-1)/2)((3-1)/2)} = (p/3) * (-1)^{(p-1)/2}`.\n\n*   **`p mod 3`**: `p = 2^{127} - 1 ≡ (-1)^{127} - 1 = -2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`. So, `(p/3) = 1`.\n*   **`(p-1)/2`**: `(p-1)/2 = (2^{127}-2)/2 = 2^{126}-1`, which is an odd number. So, `(-1)^{(p-1)/2} = -1`.\n\nTherefore, `(3/p) = 1 * (-1) = -1`.\n\n### 6. Final Calculation\n\nThe value is `(X/p) * X^2 = -1 * X^2 \\mod p`.\n`X = 52,920,000`.\n`X^2 = 2,790,128,400,000,000`.\n\nSince `p = 2^{127}-1` is a very large number (approximately 1.7 x 10^38), `X^2` is much smaller than `p`. Thus, the result modulo `p` is simply `-X^2`.\n\nFinal Answer: `-2,790,128,400,000,000`.\n\n<<< -2790128400000000 >>>"
