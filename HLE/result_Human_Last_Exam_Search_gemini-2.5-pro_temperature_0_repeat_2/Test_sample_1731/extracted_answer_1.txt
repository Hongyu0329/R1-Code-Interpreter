**Equilibrium Distribution:** The average number of photons with energy ε is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution with zero chemical potential:
`<n(ε)> = 1 / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)`

**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):** The total energy of the photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:
`U = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴`

**Equilibrium Entropy (S):** The total entropy of the photon gas is:
`S = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³`
