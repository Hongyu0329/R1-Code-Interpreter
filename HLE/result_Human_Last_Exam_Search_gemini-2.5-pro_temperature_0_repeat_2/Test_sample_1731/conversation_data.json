    "Large deviation theorems, such as the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the principles of statistical mechanics. They formalize the idea that the equilibrium state of a system is the most probable macroscopic state, and the probability of observing a rare, non-equilibrium state decreases exponentially. Using this framework, we can determine the equilibrium properties of a photon gas (the Bose case for light quanta).\n\nThe core idea is to identify the distribution of particles over energy levels that maximizes the entropy, subject to the physical constraints of the system. This \"maximum entropy principle\" is a direct consequence of the large deviation theorems, where the equilibrium distribution is the one that minimizes the rate function (the Kullback-Leibler divergence in Sanov's theorem), which is equivalent to maximizing the entropy.\n\n### Equilibrium Distribution\n\nFor a gas of bosons, like photons, the entropy (S) is given by the Boltzmann formula, S = k ln(W), where W is the number of microscopic configurations corresponding to a given macroscopic state. The macroscopic state is defined by the number of particles, `n_i`, in each energy level `ε_i`. Maximizing this entropy under the constraint of a fixed total energy `U = Σ n_i ε_i` leads to the most probable distribution of particles.\n\nA crucial characteristic of a photon gas is that the number of photons is not conserved, as they can be emitted and absorbed by the walls of their container. This means that in the context of the grand canonical ensemble, the chemical potential (μ) is zero. The resulting equilibrium distribution for the average number of photons `<n(ε)>` in a state with energy ε is the **Bose-Einstein distribution** with zero chemical potential:\n\n<center><<n(ε)> = 1 / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)</center>\n\nHere, `k` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature. This distribution represents the equilibrium state.\n\n### Equilibrium Mean Energy\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy (U) of the photon gas is found by summing the energies of all possible photon states, weighted by the Bose-Einstein distribution. For a continuous spectrum of energies in a volume V, this summation becomes an integral over the density of states, `g(ε)`. The density of states for photons is given by `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³)) ε²`, where `h` is Planck's constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n\nThe mean energy is then:\n\n<center>U = ∫₀<sup>∞</sup> ε <n(ε)> g(ε) dε = (8πV / (h³c³)) ∫₀<sup>∞</sup> (ε³ / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)) dε</center>\n\nSolving this integral yields the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of a blackbody radiator:\n\n<center>U = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴</center>\n\nThis shows that the equilibrium energy of a photon gas is proportional to the volume and the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nSimilarly, the equilibrium entropy (S) can be calculated by substituting the equilibrium Bose-Einstein distribution back into the statistical definition of entropy. For a photon gas in equilibrium, the entropy is found to be:\n\n<center>S = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³</center>\n\nThe equilibrium entropy is therefore proportional to the volume and the third power of the temperature. These results for mean energy and entropy represent the equilibrium values for the Bose case of light quanta, derived from the fundamental principle of maximizing the probability of the macroscopic state, a principle rigorously established by the large deviation theorems of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff.\n\n<<<\n**Equilibrium Distribution:** The average number of photons with energy ε is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution with zero chemical potential:\n`<n(ε)> = 1 / (e^(ε/kT) - 1)`\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy (U):** The total energy of the photon gas in a volume V at temperature T is:\n`U = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) V T⁴`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy (S):** The total entropy of the photon gas is:\n`S = (32π⁵k⁴ / (45h³c³)) V T³`"
