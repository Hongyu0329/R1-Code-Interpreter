    "The search results confirm my initial analysis. The problem involves finding the volume of the intersection of two axis-aligned cubes. The key is to determine the bounds of the intersection.\n\nMy initial reasoning was as follows:\n1.  Define the first cube, C1, with a side length of 1. A convenient representation is placing one corner at the origin (0,0,0), so the cube occupies the space x x.\n2.  Determine the shift vector. The \"main diagonal\" connects opposite vertices, for instance, (0,0,0) and (1,1,1). The vector is therefore (1,1,1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most straightforwardly interpreted as a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2). This means the second cube, C2, is shifted by 1/2 unit along each of the x, y, and z axes.\n3.  Define the second cube, C2. It occupies the space [0+1/2, 1+1/2] x [0+1/2, 1+1/2] x [0+1/2, 1+1/2], which simplifies to [1/2, 3/2] x [1/2, 3/2] x [1/2, 3/2].\n4.  Find the intersection of C1 and C2. This is the region where the coordinates satisfy the inequalities for both cubes.\n    *   For the x-axis: The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n    *   For the y-axis: The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n    *   For the z-axis: The intersection is [max(0, 1/2), min(1, 3/2)] = [1/2, 1].\n    This method is confirmed by search results, which describe finding the intersection of axis-aligned boxes by taking the maximum of the minimums and the minimum of the maximums for each axis.\n5.  Calculate the volume of the intersection. The intersection is a cube with side lengths (1 - 1/2) = 1/2 along each axis. The volume is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThe alternative interpretation of the shift \"by 1/2\" as the magnitude of the shift vector (i.e., a shift of `(1/2) * (1,1,1)/sqrt(3)`) would lead to a more complex, irrational answer. The phrasing of such geometry problems usually implies the simpler case unless otherwise specified. The problem is a classic one, and the standard interpretation leads to the clean answer of 1/8.\n\nTherefore, I am confident in my initial calculation. The volume of the intersection is 1/8.\n\nFinal check:\n- Cube 1: 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1\n- Cube 2: 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2, 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2\n- Intersection:\n  - x-range: [1/2, 1], length = 1/2\n  - y-range: [1/2, 1], length = 1/2\n  - z-range: [1/2, 1], length = 1/2\n- Volume = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8.\n\nThe logic is sound and confirmed by general methods for intersecting axis-aligned bounding boxes.\n\nFinal Answer is 1/8.\n<<<1/8>>>"
