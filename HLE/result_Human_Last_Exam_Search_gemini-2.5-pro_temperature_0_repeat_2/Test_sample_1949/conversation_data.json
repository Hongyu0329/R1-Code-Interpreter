    "Of the rivers with verifiable lengths mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest are the Araxes, the Tiber, and the Nar. These terrestrial rivers are part of the rich geographical tapestry that Virgil weaves as the backdrop for Aeneas's journey.\n\nThe longest among these is the **Araxes River**, known today as the Aras River. This significant transboundary river flows through Turkey, Armenia, Iran, and Azerbaijan, covering a distance of approximately 1,072 kilometers (666 miles). Virgil mentions the Araxes in Book VIII of the *Aeneid*, alluding to it as a river \"angry at the bridge,\" a testament to the Roman ambition to conquer and tame even the most formidable natural obstacles.\n\nThe second-longest river is the **Tiber**, referred to in the *Aeneid* by its older name, Thybris. As the third-longest river in Italy, the Tiber flows for about 406 kilometers (252 miles) before emptying into the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is central to the narrative of the *Aeneid*, as its banks are the prophesied location for the founding of Rome, Aeneas's ultimate destination.\n\nThe third river, the **Nar**, is the modern-day Nera River in Italy. The Nar is mentioned in Book VII of the *Aeneid* and is a tributary of the Tiber. It has a length of approximately 116 kilometers (72 miles).\n\nIn addition to these real-world rivers, the *Aeneid* famously features the mythological rivers of the Underworld: Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegethon, and Lethe. As entities of myth, these rivers do not possess defined lengths in the way that geographical rivers do, and thus cannot be ranked by physical measure.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Araxes (Aras River), the Tiber River, and the Nar (Nera River).>>>"
