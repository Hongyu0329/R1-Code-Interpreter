    "The main character of Jacek Dukaj's novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość,\" Adam Zamoyski, marries a post-human entity known as Tkająca Światło (Light Weaver).\n\nThe plot of the novel involves complex political and evolutionary struggles in the 29th century. While a significant event in the book is the wedding of Angelika McPherson, the daughter of Judas McPherson, it is not Adam Zamoyski she marries. The narrative avoids a romantic storyline between Zamoyski and Angelika McPherson. Instead, Zamoyski's union is with Tkająca Światło, a being of a higher evolutionary level.\n\n<<<Tkająca Światło>>>"
