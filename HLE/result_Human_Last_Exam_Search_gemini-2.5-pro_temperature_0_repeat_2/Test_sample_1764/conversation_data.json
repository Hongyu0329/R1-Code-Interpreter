    "An isometric embedding of a metric space $(X, d_X)$ into a normed space $(B, ||\\cdot||_B)$ is a function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x_1, x_2 \\in X$, the equality $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_B = d_X(x_1, x_2)$ holds. The question asks for the smallest possible number of such embeddings, considering all possible finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and all possible Banach spaces $B$.\n\nLet's analyze the possibilities for the number of embeddings. This number must be a non-negative integer. To find the smallest possible number, we need to see if it's possible to find a specific finite ultrametric space $X$ and a specific Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is zero.\n\nConsider the following simple case:\n1.  **Choose the finite ultrametric space X**: Let $X$ be a space with just two points, $\\{x_1, x_2\\}$, and a metric $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$. This is an ultrametric space, as the ultrametric inequality (also known as the strong triangle inequality) $d(x, z) \\le \\max\\{d(x, y), d(y, z)\\}$ holds trivially for any three points in $X$.\n\n2.  **Choose the Banach space B**: Let $B$ be the trivial Banach space containing only the zero vector, i.e., $B = \\{0\\}$. The norm of the only element is $||0|| = 0$. This is a complete normed vector space and therefore a Banach space. Its cardinality K is 1.\n\n3.  **Seek an isometric embedding**: Let's try to find an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$. For such a function $f$, the defining property is that $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_B = d(x_1, x_2)$.\n    *   Since the codomain $B$ is $\\{0\\}$, the only possible mapping is $f(x_1) = 0$ and $f(x_2) = 0$.\n    *   For this mapping, the distance in the Banach space is $||f(x_1) - f(x_2)||_B = ||0 - 0||_B = 0$.\n    *   However, the distance in the original space $X$ is $d(x_1, x_2) = 1$.\n    *   For the embedding to be isometric, we would need $0 = 1$, which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, no isometric embedding exists from this space $X$ to the space $B$. The number of isometric embeddings in this case is 0.\n\nEven if we consider only non-trivial Banach spaces, the answer remains the same. For instance, let $X$ be an equilateral space of 4 points with the distance between any two distinct points being 1. Such a space is ultrametric. Let the Banach space $B$ be the real line $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value norm. An isometric embedding of these four points into $\\mathbb{R}$ would require finding four distinct real numbers $a, b, c, d$ such that the distance between any pair is 1. This is not possible, as on the real line, one can find at most two points at a given distance from a third point. Thus, even for this non-trivial Banach space, the number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nSince we have found a valid pair of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 0, and since this number cannot be negative, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
