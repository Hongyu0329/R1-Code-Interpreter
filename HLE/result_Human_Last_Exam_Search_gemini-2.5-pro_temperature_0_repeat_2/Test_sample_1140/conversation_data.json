    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most effective technique would be a combination of **Fmoc-based Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)** and **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this combined approach is the most suitable:\n\n*   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the foundational method for building peptide chains. In SPPS, amino acids are added sequentially to a growing chain that is attached to a solid resin support. The use of an Fmoc protecting group (Fmoc/tBu chemistry) is standard and employs milder chemical conditions compared to other methods, which is crucial for preserving the integrity of complex peptides and modifications. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be readily incorporated during SPPS by using its corresponding Fmoc-protected building block, just like any natural amino acid.\n\n*   **Limitations of Direct SPPS:** Synthesizing a 100-amino acid peptide in a single, continuous SPPS run is extremely challenging. For peptides longer than 50-70 residues, the efficiency of each coupling step decreases, and problems like chain aggregation can lead to incomplete reactions and a final product that is difficult to purify in good yield.\n\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** NCL is the ideal solution for overcoming the length limitations of SPPS. This powerful technique allows for the joining of two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments in an aqueous solution. The reaction is highly specific: one fragment must have a C-terminal thioester, and the other must have an N-terminal cysteine residue. The presence of a cysteine (C) in your provided sequence snippet `...KAVCLXVIGATR...` makes it a perfect candidate for an NCL ligation site.\n\n**The optimal strategy would be:**\n\n1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The 100-amino acid sequence would be strategically divided into two or more smaller fragments. For instance, if the full sequence is `M...[KAVC]`-`[LXVIGATR...]A`, one could synthesize the N-terminal fragment ending in `...KAVC` as a thioester and the C-terminal fragment starting with `LXVIGATR...`. However, NCL requires an N-terminal cysteine, so the ligation point would be at the cysteine residue. The peptide would be broken into a fragment ending just before the cysteine (`M...KAV`) and a second fragment beginning with the cysteine (`CLXVIGATR...A`).\n2.  **Synthesize Fragments via SPPS:** Each of these shorter, more manageable fragments would be synthesized using automated Fmoc-SPPS. The fragment containing the azido phenylalanine (`X`) would be made by including Fmoc-p-azido-L-phenylalanine in the synthesis cycle.\n3.  **Ligate the Fragments:** The purified peptide fragments are then joined together using Native Chemical Ligation to form the full-length 100-amino acid peptide. This approach avoids the yield and purity problems of direct long-chain synthesis and results in a much higher quality final product.\n\nIn summary, while SPPS is the core chemical process, its direct application is not practical for a 100-residue peptide. Native Chemical Ligation is the key enabling technique that makes the synthesis of such a long, modified peptide feasible and efficient.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) combined with Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).>>>"
