    "To determine the area of the smallest square that outcircles the given figure, we first need to find the extent of the figure in the x and y directions.\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\n\nThe parameter `b` changes depending on the interval of `t`:\n1.  For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, we have $b=1$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle, since $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ and for this interval of $t$, $y = \\sin t \\ge 0$.\n    *   The x-values range from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n    *   The y-values range from $\\sin(0) = 0$ to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\n\n2.  For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, we have $b=5$. The equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5 \\sin t$. This can be written as $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$, which is the equation of an ellipse. Since $t$ is in $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5 \\sin t < 0$, so this represents the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 and a semi-major axis of 5.\n    *   The x-values range from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n    *   The y-values range from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\n\nNow, we combine the ranges for the entire figure:\n*   **x-range:** The union of $[-1, 1]$ and $[-1, 1]$ is $[-1, 1]$. The total width of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-values: $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n*   **y-range:** The union of $$ and $[-5, 0]$ is $[-5, 1]$. The total height of the figure is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values: $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe figure is contained within a bounding rectangle of width 2 and height 6. The smallest square that can contain this rectangle must have a side length equal to the larger of these two dimensions.\n\nSide length of the smallest square = $\\max(\\text{width, height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\n\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
