    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, a systematic approach is taken to identify the group's structure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\n\nThe polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is first checked for irreducibility over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$). Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$, we observe that 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14, but it does not divide the leading coefficient 1. Furthermore, $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term 14. These conditions satisfy Eisenstein's criterion, confirming that the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible quartic polynomial must have a transitive Galois group, with possible orders being 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant ($\\Delta$) of a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. For the given polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$\n\nTo determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$, we must check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. The prime factorization of the discriminant is $591872 = 2^{11} \\cdot 17^2$. Since the exponent of the prime factor 2 is odd, its square root, $\\sqrt{591872} = 544\\sqrt{2}$, is not a rational number. This implies that the Galois group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. The possible Galois groups are therefore $S_4$, $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), or $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic\n\nThe resolvent cubic for a polynomial of the form $x^4 + qx + r$ is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\nFor this polynomial, the resolvent cubic is:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - 8^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$\n\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic provides further information about the Galois group. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root of $R(y)$ must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors reveals that $y=8$ is a root:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This fact rules out $S_4$ as a possible Galois group. The remaining possibilities are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n### Step 4: Distinguish Between D₄ and C₄\n\nTo distinguish between the dihedral group $D_4$ and the cyclic group $C_4$, we can test whether the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The Galois group is $D_4$ if $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, and $C_4$ if it is irreducible.\n\nIn this case, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{591872}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. We test for a factorization of the form:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 - ax + d)$, where the coefficients $a, b, d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nComparing coefficients leads to a system of equations which shows that $a^2$ must be a root of the resolvent cubic $y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$. The roots of the resolvent cubic are $8$, $-4+2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4-2\\sqrt{2}$. For the factorization to exist in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, $a^2$ must be a square of an element in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nLet's test the rational root $a^2 = 8$. We check if 8 is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Indeed, $(2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 8$, so we can take $a = 2\\sqrt{2}$. This value is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Using this, we can solve for $b$ and $d$ and find $b = 4 - \\sqrt{2}$ and $d = 4 + \\sqrt{2}$, both of which are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThis gives the factorization:\n$x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the dihedral group $D_4$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the dihedral group $D_4$. The order of $D_4$, which represents the symmetries of a square, is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
