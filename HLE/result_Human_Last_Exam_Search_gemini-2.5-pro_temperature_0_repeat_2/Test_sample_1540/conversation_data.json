    "To solve this problem with the highest memory efficiency, we must minimize the amount of memory allocated for variables. The standard approach of reading both strings into two separate character arrays is not optimal.\n\nA more memory-efficient strategy is to read only the first string into a buffer. Then, we can process the second string one character at a time from the input stream, comparing it against the corresponding character in the buffered first string. This avoids allocating memory for a second buffer.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\nint main() {\n    // Buffer for the first string. Maximum length is 100, plus 1 for the\n    // null terminator. This is the largest memory allocation needed.\n    // Memory: 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Loop index. Since the string length is at most 100, an\n    // unsigned char (range 0-255) is sufficient and more memory-efficient\n    // than an int.\n    // Memory: 1 byte.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // Loop until the end of the first string. The problem guarantees\n    // both strings are the same length.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Variable to hold a single character from the second string.\n        // Memory: 1 byte.\n        char c2;\n\n        // Read a single non-whitespace character from the input.\n        // The leading space in \" %c\" skips any whitespace, including the\n        // newline character left after the first scanf.\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Perform case-insensitive comparison for the current characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        \n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, all characters were equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is the sum of the memory allocated for each variable on the stack. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: An array to store the first string. It needs 100 characters for the string itself and 1 byte for the null terminator.\n    *   Memory = 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: A loop counter. The maximum string length is 100, so an `unsigned char` (0-255) is a safe and memory-efficient choice over a 4-byte `int`.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(unsigned char)` = **1 byte**.\n*   **`char c2`**: A variable to store one character at a time from the second string.\n    *   Memory = `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\nTotal memory `m` = 101 + 1 + 1 = 102 bytes.\n\nWait, I made a mistake in my scratchpad calculation. Let me re-verify.\n\n`char s1[101]` -> 101 bytes.\n`unsigned char i` -> 1 byte.\n`char c2` -> 1 byte.\n\nTotal is indeed 103. Let me re-read my code and calculation.\n\nAh, I see. In the final code block, I have `unsigned char i = 0;` and `char c2;`.\n`s1` is 101 bytes.\n`i` is 1 byte.\n`c2` is 1 byte.\n\nTotal = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103. My scratchpad was correct. The text above was wrong. Let me correct it.\n\n### Memory Usage Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this program is the sum of the memory allocated for each variable on the stack. We assume a standard environment where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: An array to store the first string. It needs 100 characters for the string itself and 1 byte for the null terminator.\n    *   Memory = 101 * `sizeof(char)` = 101 * 1 = **101 bytes**.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: A loop counter.
