    "The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from Terence's play *Adelphoe* (line 34). The meter is iambic senarius, which consists of six iambic feet. In Roman comedy, this meter is quite flexible, allowing for various substitutions.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion of the line:\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elision**: The final \"-e\" of \"bene\" elides with the initial \"e-\" of \"esse\".\n    `et ti-bi ben' es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le`\n\n2.  **Determining Syllable Length (Quantity)**:\n    *   `et`: Long by position (followed by two consonants, the 't' of 'et' and the 't' of 'tibi'). (L)\n    *   `ti-`: Short by nature (short vowel in an open syllable). (S)\n    *   `-bi`: Short by nature. (S)\n    *   `ben'-`: Short by nature (from `bene`). (S)\n    *   `es-`: Long by position (short vowel followed by 'ss'). (L)\n    *   `-se`: Short by nature (from `esse`). (S)\n    *   `so-`: Long by nature (from `sōlus`). (L)\n    *   `-li`: Long by nature (dative ending `ī`). (L)\n    *   `quom`: Long by position (followed by the 's' of 'sibi'). (L)\n    *   `si-`: Short by nature. (S)\n    *   `-bi`: Short by nature. (S)\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (followed by the 'm' of 'male'). (L)\n    *   `ma-`: Short by nature. (S)\n    *   `-le`: The final syllable of a verse is considered long (*brevis in longo*). (L)\n\n3.  **Dividing into Feet**: The line is divided into six metrical feet. The scansion, with substitutions for the standard iamb (S L), is as follows:\n\n    L S | S S L | S L L | L S | S L | S L\n\n    *   **Foot 1**: `et ti-` (Trochee: L S)\n    *   **Foot 2**: `-bi ben' es-` (Anapest: S S L)\n    *   **Foot 3**: `-se so-li` (Bacchius: S L L)\n    *   **Foot 4**: `quom si-` (Trochee: L S)\n    *   **Foot 5**: `-bi sit` (Iamb: S L)\n    *   **Foot 6**: `ma-le` (Iamb: S L)\n\nThis is a valid scansion for an iambic senarius in Roman comedy, which allows for substitutions such as the trochee, anapest, and bacchius.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S L S L>>>"
