    "When Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG) is broken down or reduced, it allows for the increased engulfment of amyloid by macrophages.\n\nGMFG is an actin-disassembly protein found in immune cells. Studies have shown that when GMFG is knocked down or reduced in macrophages, their ability to phagocytose, or engulf, amyloid-β42 (a key component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease) is significantly increased. Conversely, overexpression of GMFG reduces the uptake of amyloid-β42.\n\nThe mechanism by which the breakdown of GMFG enhances amyloid engulfment involves the upregulation of a cell-surface receptor called scavenger receptor class A type I (SR-AI). This receptor is known to be involved in the clearance of amyloid-β. The reduction of GMFG leads to higher levels of SR-AI protein on the surface of macrophages, thereby increasing their capacity to bind and engulf amyloid. This process is influenced by changes at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels of SR-AI regulation.\n\n<<<Glia maturation factor-γ (GMFG)>>>"
