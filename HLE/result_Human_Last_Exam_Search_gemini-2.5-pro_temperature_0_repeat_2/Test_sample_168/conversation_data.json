    "The sound produced by human muscle twitches, known as fasciculations, is a result of spontaneous, involuntary muscle contractions. These contractions generate very low-frequency sounds. While the exact frequency can vary, studies on muscle fatigue and stimulation often look at responses in the range of 2 Hz to 100 Hz.\n\nTo determine which animal might hear such a sound, we must compare this to their hearing ranges:\n\n*   **Human:** The typical human hearing range is from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. This means humans are generally unable to hear sounds below 20 Hz, which would include the lowest frequencies generated by muscle twitches.\n*   **Dog:** A dog's hearing is most acute between 500 Hz and 32 kHz, and while they can hear higher frequencies than humans, their low-frequency hearing is similar to ours.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are specialists in high-frequency hearing, using echolocation at frequencies that can exceed 100 kHz or even 200 kHz. Their ability to hear low frequencies is generally poor, with some species unable to hear below 1 kHz.\n*   **Whale:** Whales are divided into two main groups with different hearing abilities. Toothed whales, like dolphins, use high frequencies for echolocation. Baleen whales, such as blue whales and humpback whales, are low-frequency specialists and can hear infrasonic sounds down to as low as 7-16 Hz. This range would overlap with the sounds of muscle contractions.\n*   **Herring:** The herring family possesses an exceptionally wide hearing range. They have a specialized swim bladder connected to their inner ear, which makes them highly sensitive to sound. Studies show herring can detect frequencies from 30 Hz up to at least 4 kHz. Importantly, they are also sensitive to infrasonic sound pressure, with escape responses triggered by sounds as low as 5 Hz. Some fish are so sensitive they can detect the weak electrical potentials generated by the muscle contractions of nearby fish.\n\nGiven these hearing ranges, both whales and herring are capable of hearing the low-frequency sounds produced by muscle contractions. However, herring are noted for being \"hearing specialists\" with a documented sensitivity to infrasound and the ability to detect faint pressure waves from nearby movements, such as those from a predator. This acute, close-range sensitivity makes them a very strong candidate.\n\n<<<C>>>"
