    "The Hollywood feature film that most closely matches the description of a character riding a bicycle and colliding with an oncoming vehicle is the 1998 film **City of Angels**, produced by Regency Enterprises and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. However, there are some key differences from the user's query.\n\nIn a pivotal and tragic scene in *City of Angels*, the character Dr. Maggie Rice, portrayed by Meg Ryan, is riding her bicycle along a country road. Overcome with happiness, she closes her eyes and stretches her arms out, at which point she collides with a logging truck. This film was a major production, with a budget of $55 million, and was a box office success.\n\nIt is important to note two distinctions from the provided question:\n\n*   The character, Dr. Maggie Rice, is an adult heart surgeon, not a teenager.\n*   While the scene is memorable for the bicycle crash, the bicycle itself is not pink. Based on available film stills, the bicycle is a dark color, most likely green or black.\n\nIt is possible that the details of the scene were misremembered, as the core elements of a woman on a bicycle in a fatal collision with a truck in a major Hollywood film strongly point to *City of Angels*.\n\n<<<City of Angels>>>"
