    "To solve this problem with maximum memory efficiency, the best approach is to avoid storing the entire input string in memory. Instead, we can read the string character by character and use a counting sort methodology. Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, we only need four counters to store their frequencies.\n\nThe most memory-efficient C program for this task is as follows. It processes the input stream one character at a time, updates the counts, and then constructs the sorted output sum. This method avoids allocating a large buffer for the input string. Furthermore, it uses the smallest possible data types for the variables to minimize memory usage on the stack.\n\n### Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n/*\n * This program reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) as a string,\n * sorts the numbers, and prints the new sum.\n * It is designed to be highly memory-efficient by processing the\n * input character by character without storing the entire string,\n * and by using the smallest possible data types for its variables.\n */\nint main() {\n    /*\n     * Variable Memory Calculation:\n     *\n     * 1. counts: An array to store the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n     *    The input string is at most 1000 chars. The maximum number of any\n     *    single digit is ceil(1000/2) = 500.\n     *    'unsigned short' (0 to 65535, typically 2 bytes) is sufficient.\n     *    Total for counts: 4 * sizeof(unsigned short) = 4 * 2 = 8 bytes.\n     *\n     * 2. c: A variable to read input one character at a time.\n     *    'char' is the smallest type for this, using 1 byte.\n     *    Total for c: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n     *\n     * 3. first: A flag to handle the '+' separator. Can be 0 or 1.\n     *    'char' is the smallest type for a flag, using 1 byte.\n     *    Total for first: sizeof(char) = 1 byte.\n     *\n     * This version uses `while` loops with a post-decrement on the counts array,\n     * which cleverly avoids the need for a separate loop counter variable 'i'.\n     *\n     * Total memory (m) = 8 + 1 + 1 = 10 bytes.\n     */\n\n    // counts[0] for '1', counts[1] for '2', etc.\n    unsigned short counts[4] = {0};\n\n    // Variable to read one character at a time.\n    char c;\n\n    // Read the input character by character and count the numbers.\n    // This avoids storing the whole 1000-character string in memory.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        if (c >= '1' && c <= '4') {\n            counts[c - '1']++;\n        }\n        // '+' characters are ignored.\n    }\n\n    // Flag to ensure '+' is not printed before the first number.\n    char first = 1;\n\n    // Print the sorted sum using while loops to avoid a loop counter variable.\n    while (counts[0]-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('1');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    while (counts[1]-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('2');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    while (counts[2]-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('3');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    while (counts[3]-- > 0) {\n        if (!first) {\n            putchar('+');\n        }\n        putchar('4');\n        first = 0;\n    }\n    putchar('\\n');\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Total Memory Calculation (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used for variables in this program is the sum of the sizes of the variables declared within the `main` function:\n*   **`counts[4]`**: An array of 4 `unsigned short` integers. Assuming `sizeof(unsigned short)` is 2 bytes, this takes `4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n*   **`c`**: A `char` variable to store the input character. This takes `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n*   **`first`**: A `char` variable used as a boolean flag. This takes `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n\nTherefore, the total memory used is:\nm = 8 bytes (for `counts`) + 1 byte (for `c`) + 1 byte (for `first`) = 10 bytes.\n\n<<<10>>>"
