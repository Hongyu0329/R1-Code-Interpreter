    "The sequence of letters appears to be based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nIf you look at the bottom row of letters on a keyboard, you will see the sequence: Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n\nThe provided sequence is Z, X, X, C, V, Y, B, N. This largely follows the keyboard row, but with an extra \"X\" and a \"Y\" that seems out of place. These are likely intended to be confusing additions or errors in the puzzle's transcription.\n\nBy ignoring these anomalies and following the most direct and common pattern for this type of puzzle, we can determine the next letter. The primary sequence is Z, X, C, V, B, N. The next letter in this sequence on the keyboard is M.\n\n<<<M>>>"
