    "The search results are about packing problems in general, including some specific examples like packing 1x1x4 bricks in a 6x6x6 cube, but they do not directly answer the question about 9x1x1 blocks in a 15x15x15 cube. However, the methods described in the search results, such as volume division and considering dimensions, are consistent with the approach I have taken. The problem I solved is a straightforward application of a greedy slicing algorithm, which is a common heuristic for such problems. Given the integer nature of the dimensions, this heuristic is very likely to yield the optimal result. My calculation of 351 blocks by partitioning the cube into regions of 9x15x15, 6x9x15, and 6x6x9 seems solid and was confirmed by a second decomposition method. The total volume of these packed blocks is 351 * 9 = 3159, and the remaining volume is a 6x6x6 cube (volume 216), into which no 9x1x1 block can fit. This confirms that this specific packing arrangement cannot be improved upon. Therefore, I am confident in my calculated answer.\n\nThe largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15 is 351.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\nThe volume of the large cube is 15 x 15 x 15 = 3375 cubic units.\nThe volume of a single block is 9 x 1 x 1 = 9 cubic units.\nTheoretically, the maximum number of blocks would be 3375 / 9 = 375. However, this does not account for the geometric constraints of packing the blocks.\n\nA common and effective strategy for this type of packing problem is to place the blocks in layers, aligning them with the axes of the cube.\n\n1.  **First Layer (aligned with the x-axis):** We can place blocks with their 9-unit length parallel to one of the edges of the 15-unit cube.\n    *   Along the 15-unit edge, we can fit floor(15/9) = 1 block.\n    *   Along the other two 15-unit edges, we can fit floor(15/1) = 15 blocks each.\n    *   This creates a filled section of size 9 x 15 x 15.\n    *   The number of blocks in this section is 1 x 15 x 15 = 225 blocks.\n    *   This leaves a remaining empty space of (15-9) x 15 x 15, which is 6 x 15 x 15.\n\n2.  **Second Layer (aligned with the y-axis):** Now, we try to fill the remaining 6 x 15 x 15 space. We cannot place the 9-unit blocks along the 6-unit edge. We must place them along one of the 15-unit edges. Let's align them with the \"y-axis\".\n    *   Along the 6-unit edge, we can fit floor(6/1) = 6 blocks.\n    *   Along the 15-unit edge (now the packing dimension), we can fit floor(15/9) = 1 block.\n    *   Along the other 15-unit edge, we can fit floor(15/1) = 15 blocks.\n    *   This fills a section of size 6 x 9 x 15.\n    *   The number of blocks in this section is 6 x 1 x 15 = 90 blocks.\n    *   This leaves a new remaining empty space of 6 x (15-9) x 15, which is 6 x 6 x 15.\n\n3.  **Third Layer (aligned with the z-axis):** We now work with the 6 x 6 x 15 space. Again, the 9-unit length must be placed along the 15-unit edge.\n    *   Along the first 6-unit edge, we can fit floor(6/1) = 6 blocks.\n    *   Along the second 6-unit edge, we can fit floor(6/1) = 6 blocks.\n    *   Along the 15-unit edge, we can fit floor(15/9) = 1 block.\n    *   This fills a section of size 6 x 6 x 9.\n    *   The number of blocks in this section is 6 x 6 x 1 = 36 blocks.\n    *   The final remaining empty space is 6 x 6 x (15-9), which is 6 x 6 x 6.\n\nNo 9x1x1 block can fit into a 6x6x6 cube, as the longest edge is 6, which is less than 9.\n\nThe total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from the three filled sections:\n225 + 90 + 36 = 351 blocks.\n\n<<<351>>>"
