    "Until 1950, the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome had a unique wooden cobblestone pavement. This feature was removed by the city administration due to frequent complaints from citizens who would slip and fall on the greasy surface, which was a result of the substance used to preserve the wood on the sloping ground.\n\nThe removal of these wooden \"sanpietrini\" marked a significant change in the appearance and texture of the famous square fronting the Pantheon. The few remaining wooden blocks were reportedly donated to the Salesian Convent in Castro Pretorio and installed in a driveway.\n\nOver the centuries, the Piazza della Rotonda has undergone numerous transformations. In the 15th century, Pope Eugenius IV ordered the clearing of the medieval shops and sheds that had crowded the area around the Pantheon's columns. The well-known fountain in the center of the square was designed by Giacomo della Porta and built in 1575, with the Egyptian obelisk being added in 1711 under Pope Clement XI. Another significant alteration occurred in the late 19th century with the demolition of the twin bell towers of the Pantheon, often derisively called the \"ass's ears\".\n\n<<<wooden cobblestone pavement>>>"
