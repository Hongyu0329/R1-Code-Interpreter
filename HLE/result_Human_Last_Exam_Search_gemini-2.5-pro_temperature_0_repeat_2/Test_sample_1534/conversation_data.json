    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are the **posterior chromatophore lobes**, the **fin lobes**, and the **vasomotor lobes** (dorsal and ventral).\n\nThe dwarf cuttlefish brain is a complex structure with approximately 32 to 38 distinct lobes. The palliovisceral lobe is part of the palliovisceral lobe complex, which is involved in controlling locomotion. This complex is situated in the posterior portion of the subesophageal mass of the brain.\n\nDetailed 3D brain atlases, such as Cuttlebase, have been developed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological data to map these intricate structures. These resources provide anterior, right, and posterior views of the brain, allowing for the identification of the relative positions of the various lobes.\n\nBased on these anatomical maps, the following lobes are located posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe:\n\n*   **Posterior Chromatophore Lobes:** These lobes are responsible for controlling the chromatophores and papillae on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, which are crucial for the cuttlefish's remarkable camouflage abilities.\n*   **Fin Lobes:** These lobes control the movement of the fins, which the cuttlefish uses for swimming and maneuvering.\n*   **Vasomotor Lobes:** These include the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes, which are also situated in the posterior region of the brain.\n\nThe entire brain is encased posteriorly by a rigid cartilage, which provides protection.\n\n<<<The brain regions adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior chromatophore lobes, the fin lobes, and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"
