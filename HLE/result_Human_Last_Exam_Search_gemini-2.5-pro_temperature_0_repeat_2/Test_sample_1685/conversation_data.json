    "To find an approximate analytical expression for the solution of the differential equation in the large $x$ regime, we employ the method of dominant balance. This method involves identifying the terms in the equation that are most significant for large values of $x$ and solving the resulting simplified equation.\n\nThe given third-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n\nFor large $x$, we analyze the behavior of each term:\n*   The term $- \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2}$ becomes negligible compared to $y'''$ provided that $y''$ does not grow faster than $x^2$.\n*   The term $\\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$ is an oscillatory forcing term with singularities. In the context of finding a smooth asymptotic solution, it is common to analyze the behavior of the system by averaging or ignoring such terms, assuming that the solution will settle into a \"backbone\" trajectory that is not dictated by the rapid oscillations. The initial conditions ($y(0)=0.00, y'(0)=3.00, y''(0)=2.00$) suggest that the solution will initially grow. However, the oscillatory term, which has periodic singularities, can introduce complex behavior, potentially causing the solution to not diverge and instead settle into a stable state for very large $x$.\n\nBased on these considerations, we analyze the simplified equation where the negligible and oscillatory terms are omitted:\n$y''' \\approx y^{4} + y'^{4}$\n\nWe seek an asymptotic solution of the form $y(x) = Ax^n$. Substituting this into the simplified equation yields:\n$An(n-1)(n-2)x^{n-3} \\approx (Ax^n)^4 + (Anx^{n-1})^4 = A^4x^{4n} + A^4n^4x^{4n-4}$\n\nTo find a dominant balance for large $x$, we match the powers of the most significant terms.\n1.  Comparing the term on the left with the first term on the right: $n-3 = 4n \\implies 3n = -3 \\implies n = -1$.\n2.  With $n=-1$, the powers of $x$ in the equation are $x^{-4}$ (from $y'''$), $x^{-4}$ (from $y^4$), and $x^{-8}$ (from $(y')^4$). For large $x$, the $x^{-8}$ term is negligible compared to the $x^{-4}$ terms. This confirms that our choice of $n=-1$ is self-consistent.\n\nNow, we balance the coefficients of the dominant ($x^{-4}$) terms:\n$A(-1)(-2)(-3) = A^4$\n$-6A = A^4$\n\nSince we are looking for a non-trivial solution ($A \\neq 0$), we can divide by $A$:\n$A^3 = -6$\n$A = -\\sqrt{6}$\n\nCalculating the numerical value of A and rounding to two decimal places:\n$A \\approx -1.81712$\n$A \\approx -1.82$\n\nThus, the analytical expression that approximates the solution for large $x$ is:\n$y(x) \\approx -1.82 x^{-1}$\n\nThis decaying solution represents a possible long-term behavior of the system, where the initial growth is tamed by the complexities of the equation (such as the oscillatory term), leading to an eventual decay to zero.\n\n<<<y(x) = -1.82/x>>>"
