    "An island town that is situated on a bay created by a volcanic caldera and shares its name with that bay, all while being located over 500 kilometers from any other inhabited island, is a unique geographical distinction. After a thorough review of the world's most remote islands and volcanic features, the location that most closely matches this description is **Whalers Bay** on **Deception Island** in the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica.\n\nDeception Island is an active volcano with a caldera that was flooded by the sea, creating a natural harbor known as Port Foster. Within this caldera lies a smaller bay named Whalers Bay. Historically, this bay was the site of a significant whaling station, also referred to as Whalers Bay, which was operational in the early 20th century. The island is certainly remote, situated about 120 kilometers north of the Antarctic Peninsula and significantly more than 500 kilometers from the nearest permanently inhabited civilian settlement.\n\nIt is important to note that while Deception Island was once inhabited by whalers, it no longer has a permanent civilian population. Today, it hosts seasonal scientific research stations operated by Argentina and Spain. Therefore, its status as an \"inhabited island\" is based on the presence of these researchers rather than a permanent town in the traditional sense.\n\nOther remote islands considered, such as Tristan da Cunha (the most remote inhabited island in the world), Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island, do not have a town situated on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the same name. Locations with towns in volcanic calderas, like Santorini in Greece and Aogashima in Japan, are not sufficiently isolated to meet the distance criterion.\n\n<<<Whalers Bay, Deception Island>>>"
