    "An induced subgraph is formed by a subset of vertices and all the edges that exist between them in the original graph. A clique is a set of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent. A clique of size *k* is denoted as K_k.\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with n = 128 vertices.\n\nLet G be a graph with 128 vertices. Let S be the set of all integers *k* for which a clique of size *k* (K_k) exists as an induced subgraph of G. The goal is to find the maximum possible value for the cardinality of S, denoted as |S|, over all possible graphs G on 128 vertices.\n\nLet ω(G) be the clique number of the graph G, which is the size of the largest clique in G. By definition, there exists a subset of vertices C in G of size ω(G) that forms a clique. The subgraph induced by these ω(G) vertices is a K_ω(G). Therefore, ω(G) is an element of the set S.\n\nNow, consider any integer *k* such that 1 ≤ *k* ≤ ω(G). We can choose any subset C' of the vertex set C that has size *k*. Since all vertices in C are connected to each other, all vertices in the subset C' are also connected to each other. Consequently, the subgraph induced by C' is a clique of size *k*, or K_k.\n\nThis implies that if a graph G has a maximum clique of size ω(G), it must also have induced subgraphs isomorphic to K_k for all positive integers *k* less than or equal to ω(G). In other words, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is S = {1, 2, 3, ..., ω(G)}.\n\nThe number of different clique sizes is therefore equal to the clique number, |S| = ω(G). To maximize the number of different clique sizes, we need to find a graph G on 128 vertices that has the maximum possible clique number.\n\nFor any graph on *n* vertices, the size of any clique cannot exceed *n*. Thus, for a graph with 128 vertices, the clique number ω(G) can be at most 128.\n\nTo achieve this maximum value, we can consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted as K_128. In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The set of all 128 vertices in K_128 forms a clique. Therefore, the clique number of K_128 is 128.\n\nFor the graph K_128, the set of induced clique sizes is {1, 2, ..., 128}. The number of different sizes in this set is 128. Since no graph on 128 vertices can have a clique number greater than 128, this is the maximum possible number.\n\n<<<128>>>"
