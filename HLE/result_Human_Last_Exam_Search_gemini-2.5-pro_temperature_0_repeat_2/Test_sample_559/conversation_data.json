    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we first identify the equilibrium points and their stability. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that separates trajectories with different long-term behaviors. Such curves are typically the stable or unstable manifolds of saddle points.\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$\n$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$\n\n**1. Finding Equilibrium Points**\n\nEquilibrium points are found by setting the derivatives to zero.\nFrom $u'(t) = (u-1)u^2 = 0$, we have $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the first equation gives $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) = 0$, which implies $d=0$. Thus, **(0, 0)** is an equilibrium point.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the first equation gives $d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (-3+5)d(t) - 0 = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0$. This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. Thus, **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)** are equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Classifying the Equilibrium Points**\n\nWe classify the equilibrium points by linearizing the system and examining the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix at each point.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is:\n$J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (-3+10u)d - 3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=2$. Since both are positive, (1, 0) is an **unstable node**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1$ and $\\lambda_2=-2$. Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs, (1, -1) is a **saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The linearization is inconclusive, so this is a non-hyperbolic point.\n\n**3. Finding the Separatrix**\n\nThe separatrix is the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1). We look for an invariant curve of the system that passes through this point. An invariant curve is a solution trajectory $d=f(u)$. The equation for such a curve is given by the Riccati differential equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$\n\nWe test for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d(u) = au^2+bu+c$. By substituting this into the differential equation and equating coefficients, we find that $d(u) = -u^2$ is an exact solution.\n\nLet's verify this:\nIf $d = -u^2$, then $\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u \\frac{du}{dt} = -2u(u^2(u-1)) = -2u^4+2u^3$.\nSubstituting $d=-u^2$ into the first original equation:\n$2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u) = 2u^4 + 3u^3 - 5u^4 - u^3 + u^4 = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\nSince both expressions are equal, $d=-u^2$ is indeed an invariant curve.\n\nThis curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1), since for $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. An invariant curve passing through a saddle point must be one of its manifolds. The tangent to the curve $d=-u^2$ at $u=1$ is $d'(1) = -2$. The eigenvector for the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1, -1) is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, which corresponds to a slope of -2. This confirms that the curve $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThis unstable manifold acts as the separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions of different dynamic behavior. Trajectories starting on one side of this curve will converge to the equilibrium point (0, 0), while trajectories on the other side will have their $d$ component tend to infinity.\n\n<<<The separatrix of the system is given by the equation $d = -u^2$.>>>"
