    "An open reading frame (ORF) is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by a cell to synthesize a protein. It begins with a start codon and ends with a stop codon. Since the provided sequence is from the middle of an ORF, the correct reading frame will not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, or TGA).\n\nThe nucleotide sequence can be read in three possible forward frames. By translating all three, we can identify the correct one.\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Starts at the first nucleotide (g). This frame contains the codons `TAG`, `TAA`, and `TGA`, which are all stop codons. Therefore, this frame is incorrect.\n*   **Frame 2:** Starts at the second nucleotide (g). This frame contains no stop codons.\n*   **Frame 3:** Starts at the third nucleotide (a). This frame contains two `TGA` stop codons. Therefore, this frame is also incorrect.\n\nThe only frame without stop codons is Frame 2.\n\n**Correct Frame:** Frame 2\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAGESDLEKW>>>"
