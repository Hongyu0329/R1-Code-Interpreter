    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 9.\n\nTo determine this, we first need to define the \"sum\" of graphs and the chromatic number of a cycle.\n\n### Graph Sum and Chromatic Number\n\nThere are several ways to define the sum of graphs. A common interpretation that often maximizes the chromatic number is the **join** of graphs. The join of two graphs, denoted \\( G_1 + G_2 \\), is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding all possible edges between the vertices of \\( G_1 \\) and the vertices of \\( G_2 \\). A key property of the join operation is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. Thus, for a graph \\( G \\) that is the join of three cycles \\( C_n \\), its chromatic number is:\n\n\\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\)\n\n### Chromatic Number of a Cycle\n\nThe chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on the parity of its length \\( n \\):\n*   If \\( n \\) is **even**, the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n*   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\n### Calculating the Maximal Chromatic Number\n\nTo find the maximal chromatic number of \\( G \\), we need to maximize the chromatic number of the individual cycles \\( C_n \\). The maximum chromatic number for a cycle is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is an odd number.\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\( G \\) is:\n\nMaximal \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times (\\text{maximal } \\chi(C_n)) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\)\n\nThis maximum is achieved when \\( n \\) is any odd integer.\n\n<<<9>>>"
