    "The thickness of a double point in the stable reduction of a curve is a measure of the arithmetic complexity of that singularity. It is defined as the valuation of the parameter that smooths the node in a local equation of the form `xy = t`. For a curve defined over a field with a discrete valuation `v`, if a node is locally described by `xy = π^n`, where `π` is a uniformizer of the valuation ring, the thickness of the node is `n` (some authors define it as `1/n`). The valuation `v` is normalized such that `v(2)=1`.\n\nThe curve is given by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We can rewrite this as $z^2 - 1 = 2(x^5 + x^3)$.\nLet `u = z - 1`. The equation becomes `u(u + 2) = 2(x^5 + x^3)`.\n\nThe special fiber of this model, obtained by reducing the equation modulo 2, is `u^2 = 0`. This indicates that the special fiber is a non-reduced scheme, and the model is singular along the line `z=1`. The singularity is caused by the factor of 2 on the right-hand side of the equation.\n\nIn the context of stable reduction, the process often involves a sequence of blow-ups to resolve singularities. However, for a singularity that is locally of the form `uv = t`, the thickness is simply the valuation of `t`. In our case, the equation can be seen as a degeneration where the smoothing parameter is `t=2`.\n\nThe valuation of this parameter is `v(2) = 1`. This suggests that the thickness of the double point, which arises from this degeneracy, is 1. This corresponds to the case where the singularity is of the simplest type, with `n=1`.\n\n<<<1>>>"
