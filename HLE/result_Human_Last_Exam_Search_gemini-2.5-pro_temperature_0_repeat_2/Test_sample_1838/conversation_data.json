    "To determine the central pixel of the line between (1,1) and (11, 5) using Bresenham's line algorithm, we first need to generate all the pixel coordinates that form the line.\n\nBresenham's algorithm is an efficient method for drawing lines on a grid of pixels. It works by making incremental calculations using only integers.\n\nHere are the steps for the given line:\n\n1.  **Calculate the change in x and y:**\n    *   dx = 11 - 1 = 10\n    *   dy = 5 - 1 = 4\n\n2.  **Calculate the initial decision parameter:**\n    *   p = 2 * dy - dx = 2 * 4 - 10 = -2\n\n3.  **Iterate and determine the pixels:**\n    Starting from (1,1), we increment the x-coordinate at each step. We use the decision parameter to decide whether to increment the y-coordinate.\n\nThe sequence of pixels generated is:\n(1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 3), **(6, 3)**, (7, 4), (8, 4), (9, 5), (10, 5), (11, 5)\n\nThere are a total of 11 pixels in this line. The central pixel is the 6th one in the sequence.\n\n<<<The coordinates of the central pixel are (6, 3).>>>"
