To ensure safe separation for a takeoff from Runway 30 while an aircraft is performing a circling approach to Runway 12, the arriving aircraft would need to be established on the downwind leg of its circling maneuver, north of the airport. A conservative estimate for the required separation would be when the arriving aircraft is approximately 4 to 5 nautical miles from the Bilbao VOR (BLV) and on a flight path that is moving away from the departure path of Runway 30. This ensures that the standard 3 NM terminal area separation is maintained and allows the departing aircraft to safely execute its takeoff and initial climb. However, the precise distance would be determined by the Air Traffic Controller based on the specific aircraft category, its position on the radar, and the procedures outlined in the official aeronautical charts for Bilbao Airport.
