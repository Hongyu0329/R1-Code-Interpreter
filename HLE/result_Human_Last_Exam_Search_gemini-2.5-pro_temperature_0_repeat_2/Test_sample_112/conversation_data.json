    "Sir Launfal is preserved in the British Library manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii, which dates from the latter half of the fifteenth century. This manuscript contains a collection of thirty-eight items, including ten romances and several \"courtesy poems,\" which are essentially books of manners.\n\nOne of the books of manners preserved alongside Sir Launfal in this manuscript is titled **\"Dame Courtesy\"**. The manuscript as a whole is considered a \"late-medieval household book,\" and the inclusion of these courtesy poems suggests an intention to provide instruction on proper conduct and social etiquette. The manuscript also contains other instructional pieces on manners, though \"Dame Courtesy\" is explicitly named in a list of the manuscript's contents.\n\n<<<\"Dame Courtesy\">>>"
