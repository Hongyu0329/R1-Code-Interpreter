    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe conditions for the existence of such a point are typically established within the framework of partially ordered complete metric spaces. These conditions ensure that iterative sequences constructed from the functions converge to a fixed point. The primary conditions involve a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition.\n\nLet (X, ≤₁), (Y, ≤₂), and (Z, ≤₃) be partially ordered sets and (X, d₁), (Y, d₂), and (Z, d₃) be complete metric spaces. The product space X × Y × Z is endowed with a partial order defined as:\n(u, v, w) ≤ (x, y, z) if and only if u ≤₁ x, v ≥₂ y, and w ≤₃ z.\n\nThe key conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n### **1. Mixed Monotone Property**\n\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a mixed monotone property, which dictates how they behave with respect to the partial orders on the spaces. For any x, x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z, z₁, z₂ ∈ Z:\n\n*   **For F: X × Y × Z → X:**\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its first argument: x₁ ≤₁ x₂ ⇒ F(x₁, y, z) ≤₁ F(x₂, y, z).\n    *   F is non-increasing in its second argument: y₁ ≤₂ y₂ ⇒ F(x, y₁, z) ≥₁ F(x, y₂, z).\n    *   F is non-decreasing in its third argument: z₁ ≤₃ z₂ ⇒ F(x, y, z₁) ≤₁ F(x, y, z₂).\n\n*   **For G: Y × X × Y → Y:**\n    *   G is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments: y₁ ≤₂ y₂ ⇒ G(y₁, x, y) ≤₂ G(y₂, x, y) and G(y, x, y₁) ≤₂ G(y, x, y₂).\n    *   G is non-increasing in its second argument: x₁ ≤₁ x₂ ⇒ G(y, x₁, y) ≥₂ G(y, x₂, y).\n\n*   **For H: Z × Y × X → Z:**\n    *   H is non-decreasing in its first argument: z₁ ≤₃ z₂ ⇒ H(z₁, y, x) ≤₃ H(z₂, y, x).\n    *   H is non-increasing in its second and third arguments: y₁ ≤₂ y₂ ⇒ H(z, y₁, x) ≥₃ H(z, y₂, x) and x₁ ≤₁ x₂ ⇒ H(z, y, x₁) ≥₃ H(z, y, x₂).\n\n### **2. Contractive Condition**\n\nThe functions must satisfy a contractive condition that ensures the distances between successive elements of the iterative sequences decrease. There exist constants j, k, l ∈ [0, 1) with j + 2k + 2l < 1 such that for all x, u ∈ X, y, v ∈ Y, and z, w ∈ Z with x ≥ u, y ≤ v, and z ≥ w:\n\nd₁(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ j * d₁(x, u) + k * d₂(y, v) + l * d₃(z, w)\nd₂(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ j * d₂(y, v) + k * d₁(x, u) + l * d₂(y, v)\nd₃(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ j * d₃(z, w) + k * d₂(y, v) + l * d₁(x, u)\n\nThis is a generalization of the contractive conditions found in tripled fixed point theorems.\n\n### **3. Existence of an Initial Point**\n\nThere must exist an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z that satisfies the following relations:\n\n*   x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\nThis condition, combined with the mixed monotone property, allows for the construction of iterative sequences that are non-decreasing for the first and third components and non-increasing for the second component.\n\n### **4. Continuity or Regularity**\n\nTo guarantee that the limit of the constructed sequences is indeed a fixed point, one of the following conditions must hold:\n\n*   **Continuity:** The functions F, G, and H are continuous.\n*   **Regularity of the Space:** If a non-decreasing sequence {xₙ} converges to x, then xₙ ≤ x for all n. Similarly, if a non-increasing sequence {yₙ} converges to y, then yₙ ≥ y for all n.\n\nIf these conditions are met, then there exists an FGH-tripled fixed point (x, y, z). To ensure the uniqueness of the fixed point, an additional condition is often required: for any two points in X × Y × Z, there exists a third point that is comparable to both.\n\nThis framework is a generalization of the concepts of coupled and tripled fixed points. The specific domains of the functions F, G, and H, as provided in the query, necessitate a tailored definition of the mixed monotone property and the contractive condition as outlined above. The core principles, however, remain rooted in the Banach contraction principle extended to partially ordered metric spaces.\n\n<<<An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z exists under several key conditions, primarily within the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces.

H would be non-decreasing in its first argument and non-increasing in its second and third arguments.\n\n2.  **Contractive Condition:** The mappings must satisfy a contraction inequality. This means there exist constants j, k, l ∈ [0, 1) with a sum less than 1, such that the distances between the function outputs are less than a linear combination of the distances between their inputs. For instance, d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ j * d(x, u) + k * d(y, v) + l * d(z, w) for all comparable elements (x, y, z) and (u, v, w), with similar inequalities for G and H.\n\n3.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must be a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific order relationship with the output of the functions, such as x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).\n\n4.  **Continuity or Regularity:** Either the functions F, G, and H must be continuous, or the underlying metric spaces must satisfy a regularity condition concerning the convergence of monotone sequences.\n\nIf these conditions hold, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed.
