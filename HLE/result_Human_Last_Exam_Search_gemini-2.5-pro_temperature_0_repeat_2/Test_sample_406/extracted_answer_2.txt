An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z exists under several key conditions, primarily within the context of partially ordered complete metric spaces. A point (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.

The primary conditions are:

1.  **Mixed Monotone Property:** The functions must exhibit specific monotonic behavior with respect to the partial orders on the spaces X, Y, and Z. Generally, F would be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in the second. G would be non-decreasing in its first and third arguments and non-increasing in the second. H would be non-decreasing in its first argument and non-increasing in its second and third arguments.

2.  **Contractive Condition:** The mappings must satisfy a contraction inequality. This means there exist constants j, k, l ∈ [0, 1) with a sum less than 1, such that the distances between the function outputs are less than a linear combination of the distances between their inputs. For instance, d(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ j * d(x, u) + k * d(y, v) + l * d(z, w) for all comparable elements (x, y, z) and (u, v, w), with similar inequalities for G and H.

3.  **Existence of an Initial Point:** There must be a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that satisfies a specific order relationship with the output of the functions, such as x₀ ≤ F(x₀, y₀, z₀), y₀ ≥ G(y₀, x₀, y₀), and z₀ ≤ H(z₀, y₀, x₀).

4.  **Continuity or Regularity:** Either the functions F, G, and H must be continuous, or the underlying metric spaces must satisfy a regularity condition concerning the convergence of monotone sequences.

If these conditions hold, the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed. For the fixed point to be unique, an additional condition on the comparability of elements in the space is typically required.
