    "There are four homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n\nA homogeneous planar continuum is a compact, connected set in the plane where for any two points, there is a continuous transformation of the set onto itself that maps one point to the other. The classification of these objects, a problem that was open for many years, was completed in 2014.\n\nThe four homeomorphism classes are:\n*   **The point:** This is the only degenerate homogeneous planar continuum (a continuum with only one point).\n*   **The circle:** This was long known to be a homogeneous planar continuum.\n*   **The pseudo-arc:** This was shown to be a homogeneous planar continuum by R. H. Bing in 1948. It is a fractal-like object that contains no arcs.\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This was constructed by Bing and F. Burton Jones and also shown to be homogeneous. It can be thought of as a circle where each point is replaced by a pseudo-arc.\n\nIn 2014, Logan Hoehn and Lex Oversteegen proved that these are the only non-degenerate homogeneous continua in the plane, thus completing the classification. Any two pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other, as are any two circles of pseudo-arcs. These three non-degenerate examples are topologically distinct from each other.\n\n<<<4>>>"
