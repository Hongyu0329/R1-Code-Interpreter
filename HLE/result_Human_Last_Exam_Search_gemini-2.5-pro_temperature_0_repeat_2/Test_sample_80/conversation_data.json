    "The search results confirm that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard is 14. The formula for an n x n board is 2n - 2. For an 8x8 board, this is 2 * 8 - 2 = 14.\n\nMy detailed analysis of the attacking graph of the edge squares also resulted in a maximum of 14 bishops.\n- The 28 edge squares are divided into two independent sets based on color (14 dark, 14 light).\n- The dark squares graph consists of one 2-node component (a1-h8) and three 4-node cycles (C4). The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the dark squares is 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n- The light squares graph has the same structure: one 2-node component (a8-h1) and three 4-node cycles. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops on the light squares is 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.\n- The total maximum number of bishops on the edge squares is therefore 7 + 7 = 14.\n\nThe question is \"how many edge squares would lack bishops?\".\nTotal number of edge squares = 28.\nMaximum number of bishops on edge squares = 14.\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThe search results also show that one of the solutions for placing the maximum of 14 bishops involves placing them all on the edge squares. For example, placing bishops on all squares of the first row and all squares of the last row, except for two corners, would result in 8 + 6 = 14 bishops. However, this is not a valid solution as bishops in the same row would attack each other along diagonals. A common solution is to place the bishops on the first and last ranks (rows). For instance, placing bishops on all squares of the first rank (8 bishops) and all squares of the last rank (6 bishops, leaving out the corners that are attacked) is not a valid configuration.\n\nA valid configuration for placing the maximum 14 bishops is to place them on all the squares of the first row and all the squares of the last row, but this is not correct. A correct placement for 2n-2 bishops is to place them on all squares in the first row and all squares in the last row except for the two corners. This is not correct either. A correct placement is to place them on the first and last rows. For n=8, this would be 14 bishops. Let's check this. Place bishops on row 1 (a1 to h1) and row 8 (a8 to h8).\nA bishop on a1 attacks h8. A bishop on b1 attacks g8 and a2. A bishop on c1 attacks f8 and b2, etc. This is not a non-attacking configuration.\n\nA valid configuration given in many sources is to place the bishops on all squares of the top row and all squares of the bottom row. This is incorrect. A valid configuration is to place bishops on all squares of the first row and all squares of the second row. This is also incorrect.\n\nA valid solution is to place the 14 bishops on the 14 squares of the first and last *columns* (files 'a' and 'h'). Let's check this.\nPlace bishops on a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8 and h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8.\nA bishop on a1 attacks h8. So this is not valid.\n\nLet's reconsider the placement on the first and last *rows*.\nPlace bishops on all squares of row 1 and row 8.\na1 attacks h8. b1 attacks g8. c1 attacks f8. d1 attacks e8. e1 attacks d8. f1 attacks c8. g1 attacks b8. h1 attacks a8.\nAll bishops on the first row attack a bishop on the eighth row. So we can only place bishops on one of these rows, which would be 8 bishops. But we know the maximum is 14.\n\nThe solution is to place the bishops on all squares of the first rank (row 1) and all squares of the last rank (row 8) except for a1 and h8. This is 14 bishops. Let's check.\nBishops on b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, h1 and a8, b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8.\nb1 attacks a2 and g7. No bishops there.\nc1 attacks b2 and h6. No bishops there.\nh1 attacks a8. So this is not valid.\n\nLet's try placing bishops on all squares of the first row, and all squares of the second row.\nBishops on row 1 and 2.\na1 attacks b2. So not valid.\n\nThe actual solution for placing 2n-2 bishops is to place them on all squares in the first row and all squares in the last row, except for the two corners of one of the rows. This is not correct.\nThe standard solution is to place bishops on all squares of the first row, and all squares of the last column.\nBishops on a1, b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, h1 and h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, h7, h8.\na1 is on the same diagonal as h8. So this is not valid.\n\nLet's go back to my graph analysis which is purely mathematical and doesn't rely on finding the specific configuration.\n- Total edge squares = 28.\n- These 28 squares form an attack graph.\n- The graph for dark squares has a max independent set of 7.\n- The graph for light squares has a max independent set of 7.\n- Total max non-attacking bishops on the edge squares is 7 + 7 = 14.\nThis seems solid. The fact that the general maximum for an 8x8 board is also 14 is a strong confirmation, as it's known that maximal placements occur on the edges.\n\nSo, if they succeeded in placing the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares, they would have placed 14 bishops.\nThe number of edge squares lacking bishops would be the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThe question is simple and direct, and my detailed analysis and the confirmation from external sources about the maximum number of bishops converge to the same number.\n\nFinal check of the logic:\n1.  Total edge squares: 28. Correct.\n2.  Goal: Maximize non-attacking bishops on these 28 squares.\n3.  My graph analysis shows the maximum is 14.\n4.  External sources confirm the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on an 8x8 board is 14.\n5.  It is also stated that for a configuration with 14 bishops, the bishops must be on the edges of the board. This directly confirms that the maximum number of bishops on the edge squares is indeed 14.\n6.  Number of squares without bishops = Total edge squares - Maximum bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThe logic holds. The answer is 14.\n\nFinal answer structure:\n- State the total number of edge squares.\n- State the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on these squares, with citation.\n- Calculate the difference.\n- Provide the final answer.\n\nThe total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard is 28.\nThe maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 chessboard is 14.\nFor a placement of 14 bishops to be possible, they must all be placed on the edge squares.\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14.\nThe number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed.\n28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThe reasoning is sound. I am ready to provide the final answer.\n\nFinal Answer: 14.\nThe question is \"how many edge squares would lack bishops?\".\nThe calculation is 28 - 14 = 14.\nThe final answer is 14.\nI will now write the final response.\n\nI will first state the total number of edge squares on a chessboard.\nThen, I will state the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on a chessboard, which all must lie on the edge squares.\nFinally, I will calculate the number of edge squares without bishops and provide the final answer.\nThis seems like a complete plan. I have all the necessary information.\n\nTotal edge squares = (8 * 4) - 4 = 28 or 8+8+6+6 = 28.\nMaximum number of non-attacking bishops on an 8x8 board = 2n-2 = 2*8-2 = 14.\nIt is a known result that these 14 bishops must occupy the edge squares.\nSo, number of bishops on edge squares = 14.\nNumber of empty edge squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\nThe logic is consistent and verified.\n\nThe phrase \"two people played a game of chess\" is indeed flavour text to frame this as a cooperative puzzle rather than a standard competitive game. The objective is clear: \"placing as many bishops on the edge squares of the board as possible\". This implies finding the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the perimeter.\n\nMy analysis of the attack graph of the 28 edge squares, which resulted in a maximum independent set of size 14, is a rigorous way to prove this from first principles, but citing the well-known result is more efficient and equally valid.\n\nThe final answer is the number of empty squares, not the number of bishops.\nNumber of empty edge squares = 14.\nThe question is clear: \"how many edge squares would lack bishops?\".\nThe answer is 14.\nI am confident in this answer.\n\nTo be very clear in the explanation:\n1.  An 8x8 chessboard has 64 squares in total. The squares on the outer border are the edge squares. There are 8 squares on each of the four sides, with the 4 corner squares being shared by two sides. So, the total number of edge squares is (8 x 4) - 4 = 28.\n2.  The problem is to place the maximum number of bishops on these 28 edge squares so that no two bishops attack each other.\n3.  The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 board is 14. It is also a known result in chess puzzles that any arrangement of 14 non-attacking bishops must have all of them placed on the edge squares of the board.\n4.  Therefore, if the two people succeeded, they would have placed 14 bishops on the edge squares.\n5.  The number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of bishops placed: 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nThe response will be structured this way.To determine how many edge squares would lack bishops, we must first calculate the total number of edge squares and then find the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on them.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. This can be calculated by summing the squares on each side and subtracting the double-counted corners: (8 × 4) - 4 = 28.\n\nThe next step is to determine the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on these edge squares without any of them attacking each other. This is a classic chess puzzle. The maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 board is 14. For a maximal placement of 14 bishops, they must all occupy squares on the perimeter of the board.\n\nTherefore, if the two people succeeded in their goal, they would have placed 14 bishops on the 28 available edge squares.\n\nThe number of edge squares that would lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of placed bishops:\n\n28 (total edge squares) - 14 (placed bishops) = 14.\n\nThus, 14 edge squares would be left without a bishop.\n\n<<<14>>>"
