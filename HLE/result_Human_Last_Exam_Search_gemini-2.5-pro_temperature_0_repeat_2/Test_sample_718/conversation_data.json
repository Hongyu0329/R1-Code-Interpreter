    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $J$ is an upper semilattice, is $n$-resolvable for $n$ equal to its projective dimension, which is guaranteed to be a finite number.\n\nIn this context, a functor is considered \"$n$-resolvable\" if it admits a projective resolution of length $n$. The key property of tame functors defined on upper semilattices is that they always have a finite projective dimension.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation:\n*   **Upper Semilattices and Tame Functors:** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set where every finite non-empty subset has a least upper bound (a join). A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called tame if its behavior is determined by its values on a finite sub-poset of $J$.\n*   **Homological Properties:** When the indexing poset $J$ is an upper semilattice, the category of tame functors, denoted $\\text{tame}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, has strong algebraic properties. It is an abelian category, and every object in it admits a minimal free resolution of finite length.\n*   **Finite Projective Dimension:** The existence of a finite-length minimal free resolution for every tame functor means that each functor has a finite projective dimension. The length of this resolution, $n$, is the value for which the functor is $n$-resolvable.\n*   **Dependence of n:** The specific value of $n$ (the projective dimension) is not a universal constant but depends on the individual functor and the combinatorial structure of the semilattice $J$. For instance, in the case where the indexing poset is $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (which is an upper semilattice), the category of tame functors is equivalent to the category of finitely presented modules over the polynomial ring $K[x_1, \\dots, x_d]$. By Hilbert's Syzygy Theorem, the global dimension of this category is $d$, meaning any such functor has a projective resolution of length at most $d$. More generally, the homological dimension of a tame functor can be bounded by combinatorial properties of the poset, such as its \"parental dimension\".\n\nIn summary, the crucial feature is that a finite resolution always exists, so the functor is $n$-resolvable for some finite integer $n$.\n\n<<<A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is $n$-resolvable for $n$ equal to its projective dimension, which is always a finite integer.>>>"
