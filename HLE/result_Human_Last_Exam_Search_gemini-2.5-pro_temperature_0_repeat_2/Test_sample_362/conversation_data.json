    "The Wittig reaction is a versatile method for synthesizing alkenes from aldehydes or ketones. This reaction involves a phosphorus ylide, also known as a Wittig reagent, reacting with a carbonyl compound to form a new carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nThe reactants in this specific case are:\n*   **Pivalaldehyde:** Also known by its systematic name 2,2-dimethylpropanal, it is an aldehyde with a sterically bulky tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n*   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the Wittig reagent. The name indicates a triphenylphosphine group (PPh₃) double-bonded to an ethylidene group (=CH-CH₂-), which in turn is substituted at the second carbon with a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n\nIn the Wittig reaction, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide are replaced by a new double bond formed between the respective carbon atoms. The other product of this reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\n(CH₃)₃C-CHO + Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) → (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl) + Ph₃P=O\n\nThe resulting organic product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\nRegarding the stereochemistry of the double bond, the nature of the ylide is crucial. The ylide in this reaction, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, is considered a non-stabilized or unstabilized ylide because the ylidic carbon is attached to an alkyl group, not a strong electron-withdrawing group. Wittig reactions involving such unstabilized ylides typically yield the (Z)-alkene as the major product under standard, salt-free conditions. Therefore, the primary product is expected to be (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
