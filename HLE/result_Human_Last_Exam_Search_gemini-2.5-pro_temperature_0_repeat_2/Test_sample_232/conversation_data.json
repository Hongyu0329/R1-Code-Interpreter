    "After meticulously unfolding a standard origami crane, the intricate network of creases left on the paper can be analyzed to determine the number of regions it divides the square into. This pattern of folds forms a planar graph, a collection of vertices (points) and edges (lines) that do not cross each other.\n\nTo find the number of regions, we can employ Euler's formula for planar graphs, which states: `r = e - v + 2`, where `r` is the number of regions, `e` is the number of edges (the crease lines), and `v` is the number of vertices (the points where creases intersect each other or meet the edge of the paper).\n\nA detailed analysis of the standard origami crane's crease pattern reveals the following:\n*   **Vertices (v):** There are a total of 49 vertices. This count includes the four corners of the paper, 21 interior points where the crease lines intersect, and 24 points where the creases meet the outer edges of the paper.\n*   **Edges (e):** The number of edges, which are the individual segments of the creases connecting the vertices, is 96.\n\nBy substituting these values into Euler's formula:\nr = 96 - 49 + 2\nr = 47 + 2\nr = 49\n\nTherefore, the fold lines of a standard origami crane divide the paper into 49 distinct regions.\n\n<<<49>>>"
