    "The stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above 2 has **2** double points.\n\nThis result is determined by analyzing the structure of the stable reduction of the given hyperelliptic curve over the 2-adic numbers. The number of double points, often denoted by $\\delta$, is related to the number of irreducible components, $n$, in the stable reduction's special fiber. For a curve of genus 2, this relationship is typically $\\delta = n+1$.\n\nThe number of components is determined by the clustering of the curve's branch points under the 2-adic valuation. The branch points of the curve $y^2 = f(x)$ are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity. By analyzing the 2-adic valuations of the differences between these branch points, it can be shown that they separate into two distinct clusters.\n\nThis partitioning into two clusters implies that the stable reduction consists of $n=1$ irreducible component. Consequently, the number of double points is $\\delta = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThis conclusion is further supported by computational methods. Using specialized software to calculate the conductor exponent of the curve at the prime 2 yields a value of $f=5$. For this type of reduction, the number of double points can be derived from the conductor via the formula $\\delta = (f-1)/2$, which gives $\\delta = (5-1)/2 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
