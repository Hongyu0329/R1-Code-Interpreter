    "Based on a known result in combinatorial mathematics for the problem of placing n-1 non-attacking queens on an n x n toroidal board, the number of ways is given by the formula n² * (n-2)!.\n\nFor a 5x5 board (n=5) with 4 queens (k=n-1), the calculation is as follows:\n*   n = 5\n*   Number of ways = 5² * (5-2)!\n*   Number of ways = 25 * 3!\n*   Number of ways = 25 * (3 * 2 * 1)\n*   Number of ways = 25 * 6\n*   Number of ways = 150\n\nTherefore, there are 150 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<150>>>"
