    "The search results confirm that the problem of finding a continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is a known problem in the study of functional equations, specifically concerning functional square roots. The function $f$ is sometimes called a half-exponential function.\n\nMy derivation of the properties of $f$ aligns with the discussions found in the search results. Key findings from my analysis that are supported by the search results include:\n*   Any such continuous function $f$ must be strictly increasing. An injective continuous function must be monotonic, and if $f$ were decreasing, $f(f(x))$ would be increasing, but this leads to a contradiction.\n*   There exists a value $a < 0$ such that $f(a) = 0$. The range of $f$ is $(a, \\infty)$.\n*   The construction of a solution is based on defining the function on a specific interval, such as $[a, 0]$, and then extending it to the entire real line using the given functional equation.\n\nThe core of the question is about the cardinality of the set of these solutions. My analysis concluded that the number of solutions is uncountably infinite. This is because for any choice of $a \\in (-\\infty, 0)$, one can choose an arbitrary continuous, strictly increasing function $\\phi$ from $[a, 0]$ to $[0, e^a]$. Each unique choice of the pair $(a, \\phi)$ generates a unique solution for $f(x)$.\n\n*   The number of choices for $a$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n*   For each fixed $a$, the number of possible functions $\\phi$ is also $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of these cardinalities, $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$. The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since the set of solutions is a subset of the set of all continuous functions, its cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$. As we have constructed a set of solutions with cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the set of all solutions must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$. The search results confirm that there are infinitely many continuous solutions.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$.>>>"
