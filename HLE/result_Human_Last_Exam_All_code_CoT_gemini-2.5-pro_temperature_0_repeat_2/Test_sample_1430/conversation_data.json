    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$, where $C$ is a genus 3 curve. The rank of the Néron-Severi group is also known as the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho(X)$.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Relate $\\rho(X)$ to the curve $C$**: There is a fundamental formula that connects the Picard number of a symmetric power of a curve, $\\rho(C^{(d)})$, to the Picard number of the curve's Jacobian, $\\rho(Jac(C))$. For $d \\ge g$ (where $g$ is the genus), this formula is:\n    $$ \\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(Jac(C)) + 1 $$\n    In our case, the genus is $g=3$ and the symmetric power is $d=15$. Since $15 \\ge 3$, this formula applies.\n\n2.  **Find the range of $\\rho(Jac(C))$**: The problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible values for $\\rho(Jac(C))$ for a genus 3 curve.\n    *   **Smallest Rank**: For a *general* curve $C$ of genus $g$, its Jacobian $Jac(C)$ has a Néron-Severi group of the minimum possible rank. This rank is 1, with the group being generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor).\n    *   **Largest Rank**: The rank $\\rho(Jac(C))$ is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(Jac(C))$. For the Jacobian of a genus $g$ curve, this Hodge number is $h^{1,1}(Jac(C)) = g^2$. This maximum rank is achieved for certain *special* curves, such as those whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final ranks**: Using the formula from step 1 and the minimum/maximum values from step 2, we can calculate the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(C^{(15)})$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Symmetric power X = C^(d)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: State the key formula.\")\n    print(f\"Let C be a curve of genus g={g} and X = C^(d) with d={d}.\")\n    print(\"For d >= g, the rank of the Neron-Severi group, rho(X), is given by:\")\n    print(\"rho(X) = rho(Jac(C)) + 1\")\n    print(f\"Since {d} >= {g}, this formula applies.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the range of rho(Jac(C)).\")\n    # Smallest rank\n    print(\"--- Smallest Rank Calculation ---\")\n    print(\"The smallest rank rho(Jac(C)) occurs for a general curve.\")\n    rho_jac_min = 1\n    print(f\"For a general curve of genus g={g}, rho(Jac(C))_min = {rho_jac_min}.\")\n    \n    smallest_rank = rho_jac_min + 1\n    print(\"The smallest rank of NS(X) is therefore:\")\n    print(f\"rho(X)_min = rho(Jac(C))_min + 1 = {rho_jac_min} + 1 = {smallest_rank}\\n\")\n\n    # Largest rank\n    print(\"--- Largest Rank Calculation ---\")\n    print(\"The largest rank rho(Jac(C)) is bounded by the Hodge number h^(1,1)(Jac(C)).\")\n    print(\"For the Jacobian of a genus g curve, h^(1,1)(Jac(C)) = g^2.\")\n    rho_jac_max = g**2\n    print(f\"For g={g}, the maximum possible rank is rho(Jac(C))_max = {g}^2 = {rho_jac_max}.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is achieved for special curves (e.g., with maximal complex multiplication).\")\n\n    largest_rank = rho_jac_max + 1\n    print(\"The largest rank of NS(X) is therefore:\")\n    print(f\"rho(X)_max = rho(Jac(C))_max + 1 = {rho_jac_max} + 1 = {largest_rank}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The smallest possible rank is {smallest_rank}.\")\n    print(f\"The largest possible rank is {largest_rank}.\")\n\nsolve_neron_severi_rank()\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.>>>\n```"
