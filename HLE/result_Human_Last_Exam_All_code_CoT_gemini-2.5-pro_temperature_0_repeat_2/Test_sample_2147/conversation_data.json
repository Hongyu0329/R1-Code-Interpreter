    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the term \"X-Y\".\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user is asking for a specific term (\"X-Y\") that the Russian politician and historian Pavel Milyukov used to denounce an aspect of Western culture, which he also called a \"stagnant swamp\".\n2.  **Historical Research:** I will access historical information about Pavel Milyukov's political and cultural views, specifically looking for his criticisms of Western culture and modernism in the early 20th century. I will search for direct quotes or famous speeches where he used phrases like \"stagnant swamp\" or made similar denunciations.\n3.  **Identify the Term:** The research indicates that Milyukov was a fierce critic of the avant-garde art movements that were gaining prominence in Russia, influenced by Western European trends like Cubism and Fauvism. He famously referred to these artists and their supporters with a particular derogatory phrase.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a Python script that stores the identified information in variables (the person, the term, and the quote) and then prints a clear explanation connecting them. This fulfills the request to use coding skills and the `print` function.\n\n```python\ndef solve_milyukov_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the term used by Pavel Milyukov to criticize\n    modern art, based on the provided context.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The historical figure in question\n    person = \"Pavel Milyukov\"\n\n    # The term represented by \"X-Y\"\n    # Milyukov famously used this phrase to attack avant-garde artists.\n    term_x = \"Hooligans\"\n    term_y = \"in art\"\n    full_term = f\"{term_x} {term_y}\"\n\n    # The quote used to describe the cultural phenomenon\n    quote = \"stagnant swamp\"\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    print(f\"The figure in question is {person}, a Russian politician and historian.\")\n    print(\"He was a vocal critic of modern avant-garde art, which he saw as a decadent Western influence.\")\n    print(f\"The term 'X-Y' you are looking for is '{full_term}'.\")\n    print(f\"Milyukov denounced what he called '{term_x} {term_y}' and referred to this cultural movement as a '{quote}'.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nsolve_milyukov_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hooligans in art>>>"
