    Solves the language transparency puzzle based on linguistic principles.

    The theory of "MÃ¼ller-Gotama (1994)" is not a recognized academic source,
    so the solution is derived from general knowledge of historical linguistics
    and morphology. Semantic transparency refers to how easily a word's meaning
    can be deduced from its parts.

    - Russian: High transparency due to a very regular prefix/suffix system.
    - German: High transparency due to extensive and clear compounding.
    - Old English: More transparent than Modern English, with clearer Germanic roots.
    - Modern English: Low transparency due to heavy borrowing and opaque idioms.

    We will assign illustrative scores to model this relationship.
