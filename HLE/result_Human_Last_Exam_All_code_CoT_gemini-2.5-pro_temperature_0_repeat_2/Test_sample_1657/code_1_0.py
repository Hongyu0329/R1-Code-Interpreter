# Wuxing C Program Simulation

# This script simulates the calculations that would be performed by a C program
# on the hypothetical Wuxing computer to solve the Pandora probe problem.
# The Wuxing computer uses a special 'frac' type for floating-point arithmetic.
# This simulation uses standard Python floats for simplicity, but follows the
# analytical steps that would be necessary on the constrained hardware.
