# Step 1: Define the scansion for each part of the line based on natural stress.
scansion_parts = [
    "xxx",  # For "And in the"
    "/x",   # For "letter"
    "x",    # For "my"
    "/x",   # For "cousin"
    "/x",   # For "mentions"
    "x",    # For "a"
    "/",    # For "piece"
    "x",    # For "of"
    "x/"    # For "advice"
]

# Step 2: Combine the parts to create the full scansion string.
# The prompt asks to show the components of the final result,
# so we will build the string from its identified parts.
final_scansion = "".join(scansion_parts)

# Step 3: Print the final result.
