    "I have analyzed the pattern in the provided examples. The transformation appears to be a \"bubble physics\" simulation where a '2' element moves within a grid of '0's and '1's.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Parse the Grid**: The input is a string with rows separated by commas. I will first parse this into a 2D grid (a list of lists of characters) to easily access and modify individual cells.\n2.  **Locate the '2'**: I will scan the grid to find the coordinates (row `r`, column `c`) of the '2'. The examples suggest there will be at most one '2'.\n3.  **Determine the Movement Rule**:\n    *   The '2' always moves to the row above it (row `r-1`).\n    *   The destination column depends on the character immediately to the left of the '2', at `(r, c-1)`.\n    *   Based on my analysis of `Input_A` and `Input_B`:\n        *   If the character at `(r, c-1)` is '1', the '2' is \"deflected\" to the left. The new column will be `c-1`.\n        *   If the character at `(r, c-1)` is '0', the '2' is \"deflected\" to the right. The new column will be `c+1`.\n4.  **Apply the Transformation**:\n    *   The original cell of the '2' at `(r, c)` will be changed to '0'.\n    *   The destination cell, determined in the previous step, will be changed to '2'.\n5.  **Format the Output**: The modified 2D grid will be converted back into a comma-separated string to match the required output format.\n6.  **Solve for Input_C**: I will apply this logic to `Input_C` to find the value of `MISSING`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_puzzle(input_str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by transforming the grid based on the movement of the '2'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
