# The number of isomorphism classes of automorphism groups for compact,
# connected Riemann surfaces of a given genus is a known mathematical result.
# These numbers are based on classifications found in mathematical research literature.

# For genus g=2, there are 7 such groups.
num_groups_g2 = 7

# For genus g=3, there are 23 such groups.
# This result is based on the corrected classification by Izquierdo and Ying (2020).
num_groups_g3 = 23

# For genus g=4, there are 36 such groups.
# This result is based on the corrected classification by Tyszkowska (2005).
num_groups_g4 = 36

# The final answer is presented as a list of these three numbers.
result = [num_groups_g2, num_groups_g3, num_groups_g4]
