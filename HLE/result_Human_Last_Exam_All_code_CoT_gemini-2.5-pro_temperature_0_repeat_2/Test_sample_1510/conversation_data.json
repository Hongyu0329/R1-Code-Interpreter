    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we first need to know the point group for each of the 17 wallpaper groups. The order of a point group is the number of symmetry operations it contains (e.g., rotations, reflections). The point groups of order 2 are C2 (a single 180Â° rotation) and D1 (a single reflection).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a data structure containing all 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point group.\n2.  Iterate through this data to find the groups whose point group order is exactly 2.\n3.  List the names of these groups.\n4.  Count them and display the total as a sum, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this task.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order of its point group.\n    # The point groups of order 2 are C2 and D1 (m).\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        \"p1\": 1,\n        \"p2\": 2,    # Point group C2\n        \"pm\": 2,    # Point group D1 (m)\n        \"pg\": 2,    # Point group D1 (m)\n        \"cm\": 2,    # Point group D1 (m)\n        \"p2mm\": 4,\n        \"p2mg\": 4,\n        \"p2gg\": 4,\n        \"c2mm\": 4,\n        \"p4\": 4,\n        \"p4mm\": 8,\n        \"p4gm\": 8,\n        \"p3\": 3,\n        \"p3m1\": 6,\n        \"p31m\": 6,\n        \"p6\": 6,\n        \"p6m\": 12\n    }\n\n    # Filter the dictionary to find groups with a point group of order 2.\n    groups_with_order_2 = []\n    for group_name, order in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if order == 2:\n            groups_with_order_2.append(group_name)\n\n    # The total count is the number of groups found.\n    count = len(groups_with_order_2)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are: {', '.join(groups_with_order_2)}.\")\n\n    # Display the count as a sum, showing '1' for each group found.\n    sum_equation = \" + \".join(['1'] * count)\n    print(f\"The final calculation is: {sum_equation} = {count}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_count()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
