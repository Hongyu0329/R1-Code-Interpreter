# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology T can have,
# given that T is neither trivial nor discrete on a set X with cardinality c.

# Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
# A theorem in general topology states that any non-trivial, non-discrete topology on an infinite set has at least one complement.
# This means the number of complements must be greater than or equal to 1.
lower_bound = 1

# Step 2: Show that the lower bound is achievable.
# It is also a known result that there exist topologies that have exactly one complement.
# Such topologies have been constructed in mathematical literature for any infinite set,
# including one with cardinality c.
# This means that a topology can have exactly 1 complement.
achievable_minimum = 1

# Step 3: Conclude the smallest possible number.
# Since the number of complements must be at least 1, and we know that the number can be exactly 1,
# the smallest possible number of complements is 1.
smallest_possible_number_of_complements = 1

# The final answer is the number 1.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as just printing the final numerical answer.
