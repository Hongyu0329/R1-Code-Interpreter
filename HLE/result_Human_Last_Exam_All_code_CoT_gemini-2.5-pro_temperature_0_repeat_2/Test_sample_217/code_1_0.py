def solve_mimicry_puzzle():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the correct triplets from the user's list.

    The correct triplets are determined based on biological accuracy:
    1. Triplet 1: Both bird species (Charadrius vociferus, Recurvirostra avosetta) are known for their "broken-wing" distraction displays. While "Aristotelian mimicry" is a non-standard term, it can be interpreted as referring to this shared deceptive behavior, linking all elements.
    5. Triplet 5: Heliconiini butterflies and certain day-flying moths (like some in the Melipotini tribe's family) are classic examples of MÃ¼llerian mimicry, sharing warning coloration.
    8. Triplet 8: Both the Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and the Dogbane tiger moth (Cycnia tenera) are textbook examples of aposematism (warning signaling), using visual (wing) and acoustic (tymbal) signals, respectively.
