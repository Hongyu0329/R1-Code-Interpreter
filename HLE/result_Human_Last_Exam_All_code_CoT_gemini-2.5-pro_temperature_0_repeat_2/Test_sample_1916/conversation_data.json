    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic categories that have exactly one object and three morphisms.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understanding the structure:** A category with a single object is mathematically equivalent to a structure called a **monoid**.\n    *   The single object `X` doesn't play a major role other than being the source and target of all morphisms.\n    *   The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid.\n    *   The composition of morphisms corresponds to the binary operation of the monoid.\n    *   The identity morphism `id_X` corresponds to the identity element of the monoid.\n    *   The associativity of composition in the category corresponds to the associativity of the monoid's operation.\n\n2.  **Setting up the problem:** We have three morphisms. One of them must be the identity morphism, let's call it `id`. Let the other two be `f` and `g`. So, our set of morphisms is `{id, f, g}`. We need to define the composition `∘` for all pairs of these morphisms.\n\n3.  **Defining Composition:** The composition rules involving `id` are fixed by the identity axiom (e.g., `f ∘ id = f`, `id ∘ g = g`, etc.). The only compositions we need to define are the four involving only `f` and `g`:\n    *   `f ∘ f`\n    *   `f ∘ g`\n    *   `g ∘ f`\n    *   `g ∘ g`\n    Each of these must result in one of `{id, f, g}`. This gives `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^4 = 81` possible ways to define the composition.\n\n4.  **Checking Axioms:** For each of the 81 possibilities, we must check if the **associativity axiom** holds: `(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)` for all `a, b, c` in `{id, f, g}`.\n\n5.  **Handling Isomorphism:** Two single-object categories are \"isomorphic\" if their corresponding monoids are isomorphic. This means there's a one-to-one mapping of morphisms that preserves the composition structure and the identity. In our case, with morphisms `{id, f, g}`, an isomorphism must map `id` to `id`. The only non-trivial mapping is to swap `f` and `g`. So, two structures are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by consistently swapping the roles of `f` and `g`.\n\n6.  **Execution:** The Python script will:\n    a. Represent `id, f, g` as numbers `0, 1, 2`.\n    b. Iterate through all 81 possible composition tables.\n    c. For each table, check if it's associative.\n    d. If it is, find its \"canonical form\" to handle isomorphisms. We do this by generating the isomorphic table (by swapping `f` and `g`) and picking the one that comes first lexicographically.\n    e. Store these unique canonical forms in a set to count them.\n    f. Finally, print the definitions for each unique category found and the total count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef check_associativity(table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a 3x3 composition table is associative.\"\"\"\n    for a in range(3):\n        for b in range(3):\n            for c in range(3):\n                # Check if (a*b)*c == a*(b*c)\n                if table[table[a][b]][c] != table[a][table[b][c]]:\n                    return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_canonical_form(table):\n    \"\"\"\n    Gets the canonical representation of a monoid table to handle isomorphism.\n    Two tables are isomorphic if one can be obtained by swapping f (1) and g (2).\n    The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of the two.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The table is represented as a tuple of tuples to be hashable\n    table_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in table)\n\n    # Define the swap mapping: id -> id, f -> g, g -> f\n    swap_map = {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1}\n    \n    # Create the isomorphic table by applying the swap to rows, columns, and results\n    iso_table = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # The new composition a' * b' is s(s(a') * s(b'))\n            # where s is the swap function.\n            iso_table[i][j] = swap_map[table[swap_map[i]][swap_map[j]]]\n    \n    iso_table_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in iso_table)\n\n    # The canonical form is the lexicographically smaller of the two tuples\n    return min(table_tuple, iso_table_tuple)\n\ndef find_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding all non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Morphisms are represented as 0 (id), 1 (f), 2 (g)\n    morphisms = [0, 1, 2]\n    \n    # We need to define the 4 compositions: f*f, f*g, g*f, g*g\n    # Each can be id, f, or g (0, 1, or 2).
