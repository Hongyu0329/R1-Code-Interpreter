    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving an E2 elimination reaction with specific stereochemistry. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. This combination strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction over substitution.\n\n2.  **Recall E2 Stereochemistry:** The E2 mechanism requires a specific spatial arrangement of the leaving group (bromine) and the proton to be removed. They must be *anti-periplanar*. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this translates to a *trans-diaxial* requirement: both the leaving group and the beta-hydrogen must be in axial positions, one pointing up and the other down.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Substrate's Conformation:**\n    *   The name (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane tells us the bromine at carbon 1 and the methyl group at carbon 2 are *trans* to each other.\n    *   For an E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (Br) must be in an axial position.\n    *   In a 1,2-trans substituted cyclohexane, if one group is axial, the other must also be axial. Therefore, the reaction must proceed from the conformation where both the bromine and the methyl group are in axial positions.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Possible Elimination Pathways:**\n    *   The leaving group (Br) is on carbon C1. The adjacent carbons with hydrogens (beta-carbons) are C2 and C6.\n    *   **Path A (Elimination from C2):** This would form the more substituted Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene. However, in the required reactive conformation, the methyl group on C2 is axial. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in an equatorial position. An equatorial hydrogen is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine, so this elimination pathway is stereochemically forbidden.\n    *   **Path B (Elimination from C6):** This would form the less substituted Hofmann product, 3-methylcyclohexene. Carbon C6 has two hydrogens, one axial and one equatorial. The axial hydrogen on C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) relative to the axial bromine on C1.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The base will abstract the axial hydrogen from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group on C2 is untouched. The sole product of this reaction is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nThe following Python code will print this detailed explanation.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide\n    and identifies the major organic product.\n    \"\"\"\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK)\"\n    product = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n\n    print(\"### Step-by-Step Reaction Analysis ###\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"1.
