    "To find the number of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$, we can use a computational approach. The problem asks for the number of ordered tuples $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ that satisfy the equation.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the Python script:\n\n1.  **Strategy**: A direct brute-force search over all possible values for the five variables would be too slow. Instead, we will first find all unique unordered sets of non-negative integers `{x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}` whose squares sum to 2024. For each unique set, we will then calculate how many distinct ordered solutions (permutations) it can form.\n\n2.  **Ordered Search**: To find the unique sets efficiently and without duplicates, we will search for solutions that satisfy the condition $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le x_5$. This ordering constraint allows us to significantly prune the search space.\n\n3.  **Optimized Loop Bounds**: The search will be performed using nested loops. The ordering constraint allows us to derive tight upper bounds for each variable. For instance, since $x_1$ is the smallest, we must have $5x_1^2 \\le 2024$, which means $x_1 \\le \\sqrt{2024/5} \\approx 20$. Similar optimizations are applied to the loops for $x_2, x_3,$ and $x_4$.\n\n4.  **Finding Solutions**: For each valid combination of $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, we calculate the required value for $x_5^2$ as $2024 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2)$. We then check if this value is a perfect square and if the resulting $x_5$ maintains the order ($x_5 \\ge x_4$).\n\n5.  **Counting Permutations**: Once a valid ordered set `{x1, x2, x3, x4, x5}` is found, we need to count the number of distinct permutations. This is calculated using the formula for permutations with repetitions: $5! / (n_1! \\cdot n_2! \\cdot \\ldots)$, where $n_i$ is the number of times each distinct value appears in the set.\n\n6.  **Summing the Results**: The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutation counts for all unique sets found.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    x1^2 + x2^2 + x3^2 + x4^2 + x5^2 = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    target = 2024\n    max_val = int(math.sqrt(target))\n    \n    # Pre-calculate squares and store them in a set for fast O(1) lookups.\n    squares_set = {i*i for i in range(max_val + 1)}\n    \n    total_solutions = 0\n    \n    # We search for solutions with x1 <= x2 <= x3 <= x4 <= x5 to find unique sets.\n    # The loop bounds are optimized based on this ordering.\n    max_x1 = int(math.sqrt(target / 5))\n    \n    for x1 in range(max_x1 + 1):\n        s1 = x1 * x1\n        \n        max_x2 = int(math.sqrt((target - s1) / 4))\n        for x2 in range(x1, max_x2 + 1):\n            s2 = x2 * x2\n            sum2 = s1 + s2\n            \n            max_x3 = int(math.sqrt((target - sum2) / 3))\n            for x3 in range(x2, max_x3 + 1):\n                s3 = x3 * x3\n                sum3 = sum2 + s3\n                \n                max_x4 = int(math.sqrt((target - sum3) / 2))\n                for x4 in range(x3, max_x4 + 1):\n                    s4 = x4 * x4\n                    sum4 = sum3 + s4\n                    \n                    # Calculate the required value for x5^2.\n                    rem_sq = target - sum4\n                    \n                    if rem_sq in squares_set:\n                        x5 = int(math.sqrt(rem_sq))\n                        \n                        # Ensure the ordering is maintained: x4 <= x5.\n                        if x5 >= x4:\n                            # A valid set {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5} is found.\n                            nums = [x1, x2, x3, x4, x5]\n                            \n                            # Calculate the number of permutations for this set.\n                            counts = Counter(nums)\n                            denominator = 1\n                            for count in counts.values():\n                                denominator *= math.factorial(count)\n                            \n                            permutations = math.factorial(5) // denominator\n                            total_solutions += permutations\n\n    # Final output\n    print(f\"The number of non-negative integer solutions is {total_solutions}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation is:\")\n    print(\"1*x1^2 + 1*x2^2 + 1*x3^2 + 1*x4^2 + 1*x5^2 = 2024\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_diophantine_equation()\n```\n<<<2440>>>"
