    "Based on the principles of crystal optics, the premise of your question contains a fundamental contradiction. I will explain the reasoning and then provide a Python script to list the relevant crystal classes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Physics:** First, I will clarify the relationship between chirality, crystal symmetry, and optical activity. The key principle is that **optical activity is a property exclusive to chiral structures**. A crystal is chiral if its structure is not superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal class must not contain any roto-inversion operations, which include a center of inversion (Ä«) or a mirror plane (m).\n2.  **Address the Contradiction:** An \"achiral\" crystal class, by definition, possesses at least one of these symmetry elements (a mirror plane or inversion center). The presence of such symmetry forbids optical activity. Therefore, there are **no achiral crystal classes that exhibit optical activity**.\n3.  **Provide a Solution:** To directly address the components of your question, the Python code below will identify all crystal classes that are both **achiral** and **non-polar**. It will then explicitly state that, because they are achiral, they are not optically active. This should clarify the distinction and answer the query as precisely as possible.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies achiral and non-polar crystal classes and explains why they\n    are not optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 32 crystal classes (point groups)\n    # Format: (Hermann-Mauguin symbol, is_chiral, is_polar)\n    crystal_classes = [\n        # Triclinic\n        (\"1\", True, True), (\"-1\", False, False),\n        # Monoclinic\n        (\"2\", True, True), (\"m\", False, True), (\"2/m\", False, False),\n        # Orthorhombic\n        (\"222\", True, False), (\"mm2\", False, True), (\"mmm\", False, False),\n        # Tetragonal\n        (\"4\", True, True), (\"-4\", False, False), (\"4/m\", False, False),\n        (\"422\", True, False), (\"4mm\", False, True), (\"-42m\", False, False),\n        (\"4/mmm\", False, False),\n        # Trigonal\n        (\"3\", True, True), (\"-3\", False, False), (\"32\", True, False),\n        (\"3m\", False, True), (\"-3m\", False, False),\n        # Hexagonal\n        (\"6\", True, True), (\"-6\", False, False), (\"6/m\", False, False),\n        (\"622\", True, False), (\"6mm\", False, True), (\"-6m2\", False, False),\n        (\"6/mmm\", False, False),\n        # Cubic\n        (\"23\", True, False), (\"m-3\", False, False), (\"432\", True, False),\n        (\"-43m\", False, False), (\"m-3m\", False, False)\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Analyzing crystal classes based on symmetry properties...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Fundamental Principle: A crystal class can only be optically active if it is chiral.\")\n    print(\"A chiral class is one that does not have a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\")\n    print(\"An achiral class, by definition, has at least one of these symmetry elements and therefore cannot be optically active.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"The following crystal classes are both ACHIRAL and NON-POLAR:\")\n    \n    achiral_nonpolar_classes = []\n    for name, is_chiral, is_polar in crystal_classes:\n        if not is_chiral and not is_polar:\n            achiral_nonpolar_classes.append(name)\n            \n    print(\", \".join(achiral_nonpolar_classes))\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Because all the crystal classes listed above are achiral, none of them have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\")\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n<<<There are no achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.>>>"
