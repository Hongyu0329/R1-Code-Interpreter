    # A Red PCP has rejection probability P_reject >= c * delta.

    # 2. The core of the argument is analyzing a local minimum.
    # Let 'pi' be a proof that is a local minimum for P_reject but not a correct proof.
    # Let 'd' be its Hamming distance to the nearest correct proof 'pi_star'.
    # Let 'v' be a neighbor of 'pi' that is one step closer to 'pi_star'.

    # definition of a local minimum (P_reject(v) >= P_reject(pi)):
    # c * d / N <= P_reject(pi) <= P_reject(v) <= C * (d - 1) / N
    # This simplifies to c * d <= C * (d - 1).
