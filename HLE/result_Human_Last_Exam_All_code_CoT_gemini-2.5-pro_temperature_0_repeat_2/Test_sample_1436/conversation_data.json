    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script to calculate the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Diagram:** The problem describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (internal lines or propagators). This corresponds to a second-order vacuum bubble diagram in a theory like $\\phi^4$ theory, where two vertices are connected to each other by four distinct lines.\n2.  **Define Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, S, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group. It accounts for the number of ways the components of the diagram (vertices and lines) can be permuted without changing the diagram's topology. It is calculated as the product of the factorials of the number of identical, swappable components.\n3.  **Calculate Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical and can be swapped with each other without changing the diagram. This contributes a factor of $2!$.\n4.  **Calculate Line Permutations:** The four lines connecting the two vertices are identical. They can be permuted among themselves in any order. This contributes a factor of $4!$.\n5.  **Calculate Total Symmetry Factor:** The total symmetry factor is the product of the vertex and line permutation factors: $S = 2! \\times 4!$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python script will use the `math.factorial` function to compute the factorials and then multiply them to get the final result, printing each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four internal lines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of identical vertices that can be interchanged\n    num_vertices = 2\n    \n    # Number of identical lines connecting the vertices\n    num_lines = 4\n    \n    # The symmetry factor arises from permutations of identical components.\n    # 1.
