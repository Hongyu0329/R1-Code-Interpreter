    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Graph:** First, I'll define the structure of a barbell graph with 10 nodes. This graph is formed by two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, which are connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck.\"\n2.  **Understand the Process:** Next, I'll analyze the \"randomized uniform gossiping\" process. In each step, a node `i` is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes. Then, one of its neighbors `j` is also selected uniformly at random. The edge `(i, j)` is the one sampled in that step.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** The probability of selecting a neighbor depends on the node's degree (the number of connections it has).\n    *   For the two nodes connected by the bottleneck, their degree is the number of connections within their 5-node clique (which is 4) plus the one connection via the bottleneck. So, their degree is 5.\n    *   All other nodes are only connected within their respective cliques, so their degree is 4.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge, let's call it `(u, v)`, can be sampled in two ways:\n    *   We pick node `u` first, then its neighbor `v`.\n    *   We pick node `v` first, then its neighbor `u`.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events. The probability of picking any node is `1/10`. The probability of picking a specific neighbor of that node is `1/degree`.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** Finally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the final equation and the resulting probability.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gossiping_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
