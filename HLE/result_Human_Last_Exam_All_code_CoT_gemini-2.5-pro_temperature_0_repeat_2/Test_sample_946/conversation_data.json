    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a trivia question from the \"Homestar Runner\" series. I will provide a Python script to print the answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific episode, which is \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n2.  Recall or look up the events of the Junior prom scene in that episode.\n3.  Identify the name of the \"live musical guest,\" which is a cardboard cutout.\n4.  Create a Python script that stores this name in a variable.\n5.  Use a `print()` statement to display the answer in a full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the Homestar Runner trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the fictional singer represented by a cardboard cutout\n    fictional_singer = \"Kaiser\"\n\n    # Print the answer\n    print(f\"In the 'Homestar Runner' episode 'Teen Girl Squad #15', the cardboard cutout of the fictional singer {fictional_singer} performs at the Junior prom.\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Kaiser>>>"
