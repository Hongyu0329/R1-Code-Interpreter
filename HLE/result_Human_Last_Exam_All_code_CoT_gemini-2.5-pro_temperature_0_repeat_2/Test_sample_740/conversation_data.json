    "To find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`\n    where the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n2.  **Simplify the Kernel**: The kernel can be written as a sum:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This shows that the kernel is separable (also known as a degenerate kernel). The integral operator maps any function `u(y)` to a polynomial in `x` of degree at most `n-1`.\n\n3.  **Formulate a System of Linear Equations**: Since the image of the integral operator is the space of polynomials of degree at most `n-1`, the solution `u(x)` must also be a polynomial of this form. Let's define the moments of `u(x)` as `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy` for `k = 0, ..., n-1`.\n    The integral equation can be rewritten in terms of these moments:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}`.\n    Now, we can substitute this expression for `u(y)` back into the definition of `c_k` to get a self-consistent system of equations for the coefficients `c_k`:\n    `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k (1 + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j y^{n-1-j}) dy`\n    `c_k = 1/(k+1) + λ ∑_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j / (k+n-j)`\n    This is a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, ..., c_{n-1}`. In matrix form, this is `(I - λA)c = b`, where:\n    *   `c` is the column vector of coefficients `[c_0, ..., c_{n-1}]ᵀ`.\n    *   `b` is the column vector with elements `b_k = 1/(k+1)`.\n    *   `A` is the `n x n` matrix with elements `A_{kj} = 1/(k+n-j)`.\n\n4.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system has no solution if the determinant of the coefficient matrix `(I - λA)` is zero, and the vector `b` is not in the range of `(I - λA)`.\n    *   `det(I - λA) = 0` implies that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n    *   The second condition (that `b` is not in the range) is generally satisfied in this case. This means that for each value of `λ` that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of `A`, the equation will have no solution.\n\n5.  **Python Implementation**: We can write a Python script to construct the matrix `A` for a given `n`, compute its eigenvalues `μ`, and then find the corresponding values of `λ = 1/μ`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation for a user-specified value of `n`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution\n    for a given integer n >= 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # Construct the matrix A\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for k in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            A[k, j] = 1.0 / (k + n - j)\n\n    # Calculate the eigenvalues of A\n    try:\n        eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(f\"Error: Eigenvalue computation failed for n={n}.\", file=sys.stderr)\n        return\n\n    # Lambda values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues\n    # Filter out potential division by zero if an eigenvalue is 0\n    lambdas = [1/mu for mu in eigenvalues if abs(mu) > 1e-9]\n\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the equation has no solution for the following values of lambda:\")\n    for val in lambdas:\n        # The eigenvalues of this real, non-symmetric matrix can be complex\n        if np.iscomplex(val):\n            print(f\"{val.real:.8f} + {val.imag:.8f}j\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"{val.real:.8f}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # You can change the value of n here.\n    # For example, n=1, n=2, n=3, etc.\n    try:\n        n_val = int(input(\"Enter the value of n (a positive integer): \"))\n        solve_for_lambda(n_val)\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        print(\"Invalid input. Please enter a positive integer for n.\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n```\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where A[k, j] = 1 / (k + n - j) for k, j in {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
