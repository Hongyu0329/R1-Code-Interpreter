    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec:\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates:** First, I will find the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the Waskaganish gathering place.\n2.  **Identify Neighbors:** Next, I will identify the provinces and territories that border Quebec. The primary candidates for the closest are Ontario (to the west) and the territory of Nunavut (which includes the islands in James Bay, to the north). New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador are significantly farther away.\n3.  **Find Closest Points:** I will determine the coordinates of the nearest point in Ontario and the nearest point in Nunavut to Waskaganish.\n    *   For **Ontario**, the border is a straight line of longitude (79° 31' W) just west of Waskaganish. The closest point will be on this line at the same latitude as Waskaganish.\n    *   For **Nunavut**, the closest point will be on one of the islands in James Bay. Charlton Island is the most likely candidate. I will use the coordinates of its southern tip.\n4.  **Calculate Distances:** Using the Haversine formula, which accurately calculates distances on a sphere, I will compute the distance from Waskaganish to the identified points in both Ontario and Nunavut.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude:** Finally, I will compare the two calculated distances to determine which province or territory is closer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport geopy.distance\n\ndef find_closest_province():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and determines the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, QC (outside of Quebec).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define coordinates for Waskaganish\n    waskaganish = (51.473, -78.761)\n\n    # Step 2: Define coordinates for the closest points in neighboring regions\n    # The Ontario border is at longitude 79° 31' W (-79.517 degrees).\n    # The closest point is on this line at the same latitude as Waskaganish.\n    ontario_border_point = (51.473, -79.517)\n\n    # The closest point in Nunavut is the southern tip of Charlton Island in James Bay.\n    nunavut_charlton_island = (51.99, -79.42)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the distances\n    # The geopy.distance.geodesic function calculates the distance between two points on the Earth's surface.\n    # We will treat the coordinates as the numbers in our \"equation\".\n    \n    print(\"Equation 1: Distance to Ontario\")\n    print(f\"Calculating geodesic distance between Waskaganish {waskaganish} and the Ontario border {ontario_border_point}\")\n    dist_to_ontario = geopy.distance.geodesic(waskaganish, ontario_border_point).km\n    print(f\"Result: {dist_to_ontario:.2f} km\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Equation 2: Distance to Nunavut\")\n    print(f\"Calculating geodesic distance between Waskaganish {waskaganish} and Nunavut (Charlton Island) {nunavut_charlton_island}\")\n    dist_to_nunavut = geopy.distance.geodesic(waskaganish, nunavut_charlton_island).km\n    print(f\"Result: {dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Compare distances and determine the closest\n    print(\"--- Comparison ---\")\n    if dist_to_ontario < dist_to_nunavut:\n        closest_province = \"Ontario\"\n        closest_distance = dist_to_ontario\n        print(f\"{dist_to_ontario:.2f} km (to Ontario) < {dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km (to Nunavut)\")\n    else:\n        closest_province = \"Nunavut\"\n        closest_distance = dist_to_nunavut\n        print(f\"{dist_to_nunavut:.2f} km (to Nunavut) < {dist_to_ontario:.2f} km (to Ontario)\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe closest province or territory to Waskaganish, outside of Quebec, is {closest_province}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_closest_province()\n```\n<<<Ontario>>>"
