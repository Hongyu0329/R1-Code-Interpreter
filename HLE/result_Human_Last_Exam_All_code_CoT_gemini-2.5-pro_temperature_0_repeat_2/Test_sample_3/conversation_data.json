    "This problem involves finding the largest possible order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup for an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the theoretical background:** The classification of possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over quadratic number fields is a known result in number theory. I will use this classification for the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n2.  **List non-cyclic possibilities:** A torsion subgroup, being a finite abelian group, has the structure $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ where $m$ divides $n$. It is non-cyclic if and only if $m > 1$. I will list all such groups that are known to occur over $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n3.  **Calculate the orders:** For each possible non-cyclic group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$, the order is simply $m \\times n$.\n4.  **Find the maximum:** I will compare the orders calculated in the previous step and find the maximum value.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these steps systematically. The script will encode the list of possible groups, compute their orders, and print the final result, including the group structure that gives the largest order.\n\nThe known non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can appear over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/2N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/3N\\mathbb{Z}$ for $N \\in \\{1, 2\\}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe following Python code will calculate the orders for all these groups and identify the largest one.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_torsion_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup\n    of an elliptic curve over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    The calculation is based on the complete classification of possible torsion\n    subgroups for elliptic curves over quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the classification, the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups\n    # G = Z/mZ x Z/nZ over Q(sqrt(-3)) are known.
