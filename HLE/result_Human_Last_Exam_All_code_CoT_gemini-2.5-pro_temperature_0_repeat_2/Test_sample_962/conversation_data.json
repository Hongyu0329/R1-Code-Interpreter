    "Of course. Here is a plan to design a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol, followed by a Python code implementation that demonstrates the core logic.\n\n### Plan: Designing a Two-Round Threshold Signature Scheme\n\nThe most suitable foundation for a two-round threshold signature scheme is the **Schnorr signature algorithm**. Its algebraic structure is linear, which makes it highly compatible with secret sharing techniques. Modern, provably secure schemes like **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)** are built on this principle and achieve a two-round online signing protocol.\n\nHere is the design, broken down into three phases:\n\n**Phase 1: Key Generation (One-Time Setup)**\n\nThis phase, often called a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) ceremony, is performed once to create the keys.\n1.  **Choose Parameters:** All parties agree on public cryptographic parameters: a large prime `p`, a prime `q` that divides `p-1`, and a generator `g` of a subgroup of order `q`.\n2.  **Share the Secret:** A trusted dealer (or a distributed protocol) defines a secret polynomial `f(z)` of degree `t-1` over the field `Z_q`.\n3.  **Master Keys:** The master private key is `x = f(0)`, and the corresponding master public key is `Y = g^x mod p`. The master private key `x` is never explicitly computed by any single party.\n4.  **Distribute Shares:** Each of the `n` parties, `P_i`, receives a private key share `x_i = f(i)`.\n\n**Phase 2: Signing Protocol (Two Rounds)**\n\nWhen a group of at least `t` participants wants to sign a message `m`:\n\n*   **Round 1: Commitment**\n    1.  Each of the `t` participating signers `P_i` secretly generates a random, single-use number called a nonce, `k_i`.\n    2.  Each signer computes a public commitment `R_i = g^{k_i} mod p`.\n    3.  Each signer broadcasts their commitment `R_i` to all other participants.\n\n*   **Round 2: Signature Share Generation**\n    1.  After receiving all `t` commitments, each signer `P_i` computes the group commitment `R` by multiplying all the individual commitments: `R = (R_1 * R_2 * ... * R_t) mod p`.\n    2.  Each signer computes a common challenge value `e` by hashing the group commitment `R`, the master public key `Y`, and the message `m`. `e = H(R, Y, m)`.\n    3.  Each signer uses their private share `x_i`, their nonce `k_i`, the challenge `e`, and a special value called a **Lagrange coefficient** (`lambda_i`) to compute their partial signature: `s_i = (k_i + e * lambda_i * x_i) mod q`.\n    4.  Each signer broadcasts their partial signature `s_i`.\n\n**Phase 3: Aggregation and Verification**\n\n*   **Aggregation:** A designated aggregator (which can be any of the signers or an external party) collects the `t` partial signatures. The final signature scalar `s` is calculated by summing them up: `s = (s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_t) mod q`. The complete signature is the pair `(R, s)`.\n*   **Verification:** Anyone can verify the signature. They compute the same challenge `e = H(R, Y, m)` and check if the verification equation holds: `g^s mod p == (R * Y^e) mod p`.\n\nThis design is secure because no single party knows the full private key `x` or the full nonce `k`. The two-round structure is efficient for online operations. To achieve \"tight security,\" real-world protocols like FROST add a pre-computation step to generate nonces, which prevents certain advanced attacks without adding rounds to the online signing phase.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this entire process.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\n# Helper function for modular inverse (to compute 1/a mod m)\ndef mod_inverse(a, m):\n    \"\"\"Computes the modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m.\"\"\"\n    a = a % m\n    for x in range(1, m):\n        if (a * x) % m == 1:\n            return x\n    return 1 # Should not happen if m is prime\n\ndef get_lagrange_coeff(i, participants, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Lagrange coefficient for participant i in the set of participants.\n    lambda_i = product(j / (j - i)) for j in participants, j != i\n    \"\"\"\n    numerator = 1\n    denominator = 1\n    for j in participants:\n        if i == j:\n            continue\n        numerator = (numerator * j) % q\n        denominator = (denominator * (j - i)) % q\n    \n    return (numerator * mod_inverse(denominator, q)) % q\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main function to simulate the t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\"\"\"\n    # --- Phase 1: Key Generation (Simulated with a Trusted Dealer) ---\n    print(\"--- Phase 1: Key Generation ---\")\n    \n    # 1.
