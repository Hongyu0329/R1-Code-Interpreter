# The number of correct statements among the given choices.
# Statement A is correct because the definition of segregation relies on an "order of appearance", which is not well-defined for Datalog programs (sets of rules).
# Statement B is incorrect because it misrepresents the claim. The claim is about semantic equivalence on a set of facts, not syntactic program identity.
# Statement C is correct. It accurately describes that the composition of aggregation and then segregation is not an identity operation due to information loss, which is a key property of the operators.
# Statement D is correct because the notation for segregating the fact set, gamma^-1[S_0], inherits the same ambiguity as the segregation process for the program P.
# Statement E is incorrect because its summary that the operations "have no effect" is inaccurate. The operations do have an effect; it is their composition that yields the equivalent result.
# Therefore, there are 3 correct statements: A, C, and D.
