    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. The general form is $SD_{2^n}$, so we first determine the value of $n$ by solving $2^n = 512$.\n2.  **Analyze Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. We need to count how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way. We will analyze two cases based on the exponent $k$:\n    *   **Case 1: $k$ is odd.** We will determine the resulting subgroup $G^k$.\n    *   **Case 2: $k$ is even.** We will determine the set of possible subgroups $G^k$.\n3.  **Sum the Results:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the unique subgroups found in both cases.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be provided to perform the calculation based on the derived formula and print the result, including the numbers in the final calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The size of the semidihedral group is given.\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the order is 2^n.\n    # We find n from the given group size: 2^n = 512.\n    # n = log2(512)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Error: Group size must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"The group is the semidihedral group of size {group_size}, which is SD_{{2^{n}}}. So, n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups in SD_{2^n} (for n >= 3) is n.\")\n    print(\"Here is the breakdown:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Case 1: Power subgroups from odd exponents (k)\n    # For any odd k, the power subgroup G^k is the group G itself.\n    # This gives us 1 unique power subgroup.\n    num_from_odd_k = 1\n    print(f\"1. For any odd exponent k, the power subgroup G^k is the group G itself.\")\n    print(f\"   This gives {num_from_odd_k} unique subgroup.\")\n    print()\n\n    # Case 2: Power subgroups from even exponents (k)\n    # For any even k, the power subgroup G^k is a proper cyclic subgroup.\n    # For SD_{2^n}, these are the subgroups <r^(2^j)> for j = 1, 2, ..., n-1,\n    # where r is the generator of the maximal cyclic subgroup of order 2^(n-1).\n    # This gives n-1 unique power subgroups.\n    num_from_even_k = n - 1\n    print(f\"2. For even exponents k, the power subgroups are a set of {n-1} distinct cyclic subgroups.\")\n    print(f\"   The number of these subgroups is n - 1 = {n} - 1 = {num_from_even_k}.\")\n    print()\n\n    # Total number of power subgroups\n    total_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n\n    print(\"The total number of power subgroups is the sum from both cases.\")\n    print(f\"Total number = (subgroups from odd k) + (subgroups from even k)\")\n    print(f\"Total number = {num_from_odd_k} + {num_from_even_k} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\nsolve_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
