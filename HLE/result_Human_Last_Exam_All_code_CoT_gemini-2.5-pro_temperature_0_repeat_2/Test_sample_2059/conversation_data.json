    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Polynomial:** Let the given polynomial be $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right)$. We are given that $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$.\n\n2.  **Relate the Sum of Squares to a Constant Term:** The sum of the squares of the coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, can be found by calculating the constant term of the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$. The constant term of $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = (\\sum_j a_j x^j)(\\sum_l a_l x^{-l})$ is the sum of all terms $a_j a_l$ where $j-l=0$, which is precisely $\\sum_j a_j^2$.\n\n3.  **Simplify the Product:** Let $P_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$. Then $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(P_i(x)P_i(x^{-1})\\right)$. Let's call the product polynomial $Q(x)$, so $Q(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} Q_i(x)$ where $Q_i(x) = P_i(x)P_i(x^{-1})$.\n\n4.  **Find a Recurrence Relation:** Let $x_n$ be the constant term of the partial product $\\prod_{i=0}^{n} Q_i(x)$. We want to find $x_{19}$. We can establish a recurrence relation for $x_n$. By analyzing the exponents (which are sums of powers of 3), we can show that the constant term $x_n$ depends only on the constant terms from the previous step and coefficients of specific higher-order terms. This analysis leads to the following linear recurrence relation for $n \\ge 2$:\n    $x_n = 6x_{n-1} - 2x_{n-2}$\n\n5.  **Find Initial Conditions:** We need the first two terms of the sequence to use the recurrence.\n    *   $x_0$ is the constant term of $Q_0(x) = (1+x+x^2+x^3)(1+x^{-1}+x^{-2}+x^{-3})$. The constant term is $1^2+1^2+1^2+1^2 = 4$. So, $x_0 = 4$.\n    *   $x_1$ is the constant term of $Q_0(x)Q_1(x)$. A detailed calculation shows that $x_1 = 22$.\n\n6.  **Solve the Recurrence:** With the initial values $x_0 = 4$ and $x_1 = 22$, and the recurrence $x_n = 6x_{n-1} - 2x_{n-2}$, we can compute the value of $x_{19}$ programmatically. The final equation to find the answer is $x_{19} = 6x_{18} - 2x_{17}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the given polynomial expansion.\n    The problem boils down to solving the recurrence relation x_n = 6*x_{n-1} - 2*x_{n-2}\n    with initial conditions x_0 = 4 and x_1 = 22.
