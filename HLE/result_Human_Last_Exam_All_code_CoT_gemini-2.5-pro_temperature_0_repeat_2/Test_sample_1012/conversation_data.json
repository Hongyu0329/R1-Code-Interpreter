    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against an arbitrarily powerful quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric-key cryptography.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary quantum algorithm that threatens symmetric-key ciphers is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Explain Grover's Algorithm's Effect:** Unlike classical brute-force attacks which take `O(2^n)` time for an n-bit key, Grover's algorithm can find the key in `O(sqrt(2^n))` or `O(2^(n/2))` time. This effectively halves the bit strength of the key.\n3.  **Establish a Security Benchmark:** The current industry standard for long-term security is a 128-bit security level. This means any successful attack should require at least `2^128` computational steps.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** To achieve a 128-bit security level *after* accounting for the effect of Grover's algorithm, the original key must be twice as long. We will set up the equation `n/2 = 128` and solve for `n`.\n5.  **Present the Calculation in Code:** The Python script will perform this simple calculation and print the result along with the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_quantum_resistant_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length to resist quantum attacks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The industry standard for a minimum security level is 128 bits.\n    # This means a successful attack should require at least 2^128 operations.\n    target_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's quantum algorithm can break an n-bit symmetric key in roughly 2^(n/2) operations.\n    # This means it effectively halves the security level of the key.\n    # To find the required key length 'n' that provides our target security level against\n    # a quantum computer, we must solve the equation: n / 2 = target_security_level.\n    grover_security_divisor = 2\n\n    # Therefore, the required key length is:\n    required_key_length = target_security_level * grover_security_divisor\n\n    print(\"To be secure against a quantum computer using Grover's algorithm, a symmetric key must provide at least a 128-bit security level.\")\n    print(\"Grover's algorithm effectively halves the bit strength of a key.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length = Target Security Level * 2\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length = {target_security_level} * {grover_security_divisor}\")\n    print(f\"Required Key Length = {required_key_length} bits\")\n\ncalculate_quantum_resistant_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
