    Solves the curve problem by interpreting the question's constraints.

    The phrase "good ordinary reduction above 2" is interpreted in two steps:
    1. "above 2": A filter on the polynomial's coefficients, requiring that their
       absolute value is not greater than 2.
    2. "good ordinary reduction": Among the filtered curves, we select the one
       that is not a known Complex Multiplication (CM) type. CM curves have
       supersingular reduction for many primes, making them poor candidates.

    Curves B and C are known CM curves. Curve D passes the coefficient filter
    and is not a CM type, making it the best answer.
