    # Information from the text
    # Fact 1: CA biotype thrives on a diet with sucrose:raffinose ratio of 3:8.
    # Fact 2: MA biotype thrives on a sucrose-only diet.
    # Fact 3: Galactosidase metabolizes raffinose (an RFO).
    # Fact 4: Host transfer: CA to cotton, MA to watermelon.
    # Inference: Watermelon is high in raffinose; Cotton is low in raffinose.

    # Statement A
    print("\nStatement A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. CA's preference for a raffinose-rich diet (3:8) compared to MA's preference for sucrose indicates a better ability to metabolize RFOs.")

    # Statement B
    print("\nStatement B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. This is explicitly stated in the description of the artificial diet experiment.")

    # Statement C
    print("\nStatement C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. Moving to cotton means less raffinose substrate for the galactosidase enzyme, which would logically lead to decreased activity.")

    # Statement D
    print("\nStatement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("Analysis: NOT TRUE. The reason provided ('higher glucose levels') is not supported by the text. The text does not mention glucose levels or their effect on galactosidase. The direct cause is the change in raffinose levels.")

    # Statement E
    print("\nStatement E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. Moving to watermelon means more raffinose substrate, which would likely induce higher galactosidase enzyme activity.")

    print("\n--------------------------------------------------")
