# Step 1: Define the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar (C138H96).
hydrogens_in_nanocar = 96

# Step 2: The prefix "perfluoro-" indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar is equal to the
# number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar.
fluorines_in_perfluoronanocar = hydrogens_in_nanocar

# Step 3: Print the explanation and the final count.
print(f"A standard nanocar has {hydrogens_in_nanocar} hydrogen atoms.")
print(f"In a perfluoronanocar, all {hydrogens_in_nanocar} hydrogen atoms are replaced by an equal number of fluorine atoms.")
print(f"Therefore, a perfluoronanocar would contain {fluorines_in_perfluoronanocar} fluorine atoms.")
