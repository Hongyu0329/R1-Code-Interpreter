    # Choice A: Aboriginal masks
    print("Choice A: Aboriginal masks")
    print("Analysis: William Friedkin's 'The Exorcist' famously features an ancient Assyrian demon amulet (Pazuzu), not an Aboriginal mask. Fritz Lang's work is not known for featuring Aboriginal masks.")
    print("Verdict: Not a common element.\n")

    # Choice B: Magic wands
    print("Choice B: Magic wands")
    print("Analysis: The works of both directors—spanning sci-fi, noir, horror, and crime thrillers—do not feature magic wands as a notable element.")
    print("Verdict: Not a common element.\n")

    # Choice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen
    print("Choice C: The first ever cyborgs on screen")
    print("Analysis: Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' (1927) is celebrated for featuring the Maschinenmensch, one of cinema's first robots or cyborgs. This is a defining element of Lang's film, but it does not appear in William Friedkin's filmography.")
    print("Verdict: An element of Lang's work, but not common to both.\n")

    # Choice D: Bugs
    print("Choice D: Bugs")
    print("Analysis: Bug imagery is a strong motif for William Friedkin, seen with the locusts in 'The Exorcist' and as the central plot device in 'Bug'. However, this is not a known or significant element in the major films of Fritz Lang.")
    print("Verdict: An element of Friedkin's work, but not common to both.\n")

    # Final Conclusion
    print("="*70)
    print("Conclusion: None of the choices A, B, C, or D represent an element that actually appears in the significant works of BOTH Fritz Lang and William Friedkin.")
    print("Therefore, the correct option is E.")
