    "The task is to identify the radical (bushu) of the Japanese character 謄 and provide its name in Hepburn romanization.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji:** The character 謄 is a phono-semantic compound character (形声文字). It is composed of two parts arranged side-by-side (left and right).\n2.  **Identify the Radical:** The left part is 言, which means \"word\" or \"speech\". The right part is 朕, which serves as the phonetic component. In this structure, the left part, 言, is the radical that indicates the character's general meaning, which is related to words, speaking, or documents.\n3.  **Name the Radical:** When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏). Its specific name is ごんべん (gonben).\n4.  **Romanize the Name:** The Hepburn romanization of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n5.  **Create Python Code:** I will write a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The kanji in question is 謄.\n    # The radical is 言 (word), which is on the left side.\n    # The name for the 言 radical when it's on the left is ごんべん (gonben).\n    # The Hepburn transcription of ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_name)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
