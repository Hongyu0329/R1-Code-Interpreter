    Calculates the minimax risk for estimating the parameter theta of a Binomial distribution
    under the specified conditions.

    The problem is interpreted as having n i.i.d. observations X_i ~ Bin(n, theta).
    The sufficient statistic is S = sum(X_i), which follows a Bin(n^2, theta) distribution.
    Let N = n^2. The minimax risk for estimating theta from S ~ Bin(N, theta)
    with squared error loss is given by the formula: 1 / (4 * (sqrt(N) + 1)^2).

    This simplifies to 1 / (4 * (n + 1)^2).

        n: The number of i.i.d. observations (must be a positive integer).
