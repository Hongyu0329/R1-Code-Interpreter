    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the mathematical formula for `a(n)`, which represents the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of `n` variables.\n2.  Based on established results in Boolean function theory, this maximum value is given by the binomial coefficient `C(n, k)` where `k` is chosen to maximize the coefficient. This occurs when `k` is `floor(n/2)`.\n3.  Therefore, the formula is `a(n) = C(n, floor(n/2))`.\n4.  I will then write a Python script to calculate `a(4)` using this formula.\n5.  The script will first calculate `k = floor(4/2)`.\n6.  Then, it will compute `C(4, k)` using Python's `math.comb` function.\n7.  Finally, the script will print the full equation with the calculated numbers and the final result, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_max_prime_implicants():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 4\n\n    print(f\"To find a(n), the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function of n variables, we use a known result from combinatorics.\")\n    print(\"The maximum value is given by the largest binomial coefficient C(n, k) for a fixed n.\")\n    print(\"This coefficient is maximized when k is as close to n/2 as possible, which is k = floor(n/2).\")\n    print(f\"So, the formula is a(n) = C(n, floor(n/2)).\")\n\n    # Step 1: Set n\n    print(f\"\\nFor this problem, n = {n}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate k\n    k = math.floor(n / 2)\n    print(f\"The value of k is floor({n}/2) = {k}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the result using the formula a(n) = C(n, k)\n    result = math.comb(n, k)\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = C({n}, {k}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve_max_prime_implicants()\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    If a(n) is the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of n variables.
