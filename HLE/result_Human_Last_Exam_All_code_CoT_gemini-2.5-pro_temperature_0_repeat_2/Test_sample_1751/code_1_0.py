    print("  - Saturated chains are straight and flexible. They can align parallel to each other, maximizing van der Waals interactions and allowing for very tight, ordered packing.")
    print("  - A trans double bond, while less disruptive than a cis bond, introduces a rigid point in the hydrocarbon chain. This rigidity prevents the chains from packing as closely and efficiently as fully saturated chains.\n")

    print("Step 3: Connecting packing to surface area.")
    print("  - When a lipid monolayer is compressed, the surface area is determined by how tightly the individual molecules can pack together.")
    print("  - Tighter packing corresponds to a more ordered state and a smaller area per molecule.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print(f"The fully saturated chains of {dihydroceramide['name']} allow for tighter and more ordered packing than the chains of {ceramide['name']}, which are disrupted by a double bond.")
    print("This is consistent with the observation that dihydroceramide forms 'highly ordered domains'.")
    print(f"Therefore, the lipid with the tighter packing, {dihydroceramide['name']}, will have a lower surface area when compressed.\n")
