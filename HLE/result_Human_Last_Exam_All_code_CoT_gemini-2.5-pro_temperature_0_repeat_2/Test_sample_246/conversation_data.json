    "To find the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the manifold and the relevant mathematical formula.** The manifold in question is the 2-fold branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun trefoil knot. Let's denote the knot by $K$ (the trefoil) and the number of twists by $n=5$. The resulting 4-manifold is often denoted as $\\Sigma_2(\\tau_n K)$. The fundamental group of this manifold, $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2(\\tau_n K))$, is known to be a finite cyclic group.\n\n2.  **Find the order of the fundamental group.** A well-established formula from knot theory (due to Kawauchi, based on work by Kervaire and Turaev) gives the order of this cyclic group:\n    Order = $|n \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma(K)}{2} + (-1)^{n+1}|$\n    where $n$ is the number of twists and $\\sigma(K)$ is the signature of the knot $K$.\n\n3.  **Determine the specific parameters.**\n    *   The knot $K$ is the trefoil knot ($3_1$). The standard convention in knot tables is for the left-handed trefoil, which has a signature $\\sigma(K) = -2$.\n    *   The number of twists is given as $n=5$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the order.** We substitute these values into the formula:\n    Order = $|5 \\cdot \\frac{-2}{2} + (-1)^{5+1}| = |5 \\cdot (-1) + (-1)^6| = |-5 + 1| = |-4| = 4$.\n    Thus, the fundamental group is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_4$.\n\n5.  **Find the minimal number of generators.** A cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}_m$ (for $m>1$) can be generated by a single element. Therefore, the minimal number of generators for $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ is 1.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of generators for the fundamental group of the\n    double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters from the problem statement.\n    # The knot is the trefoil knot (3_1).\n    # By convention, the trefoil knot 3_1 is the left-handed one.\n    # The signature of the left-handed trefoil knot.\n    sigma_K = -2\n    \n    # The number of twists.\n    n = 5\n\n    # Step 2: Use the formula for the order of the fundamental group.\n    # The formula is: |n * sigma(K)/2 + (-1)^(n+1)|\n    # The fundamental group is known to be cyclic.\n    term1 = n * (sigma_K / 2)\n    term2 = (-1)**(n + 1)\n    order = abs(term1 + term2)\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the minimal number of generators.\n    # For a cyclic group Z_m with m > 1, the minimal number of generators is 1.\n    if order > 1:\n        min_generators = 1\n    else:\n        min_generators = int(order) # It would be 0 or 1 for Z_0 or Z_1\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(\"The problem is to find the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Identify the parameters.\")\n    print(f\"The knot K is the trefoil knot (3_1).
