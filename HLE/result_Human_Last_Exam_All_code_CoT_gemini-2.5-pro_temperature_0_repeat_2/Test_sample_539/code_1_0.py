    # by the 1-dimensional WL algorithm on the product graph G^l.
    # Let's denote this dimension as d.
    d = 1

    # The governing theorem is:
    # G^l is d-indistinguishable from H^l <=> G is (d + l - 1)-indistinguishable from H.

    # We are given that G is indistinguishable from H for any dimension up to k.
    # So, for the property to hold, the required dimension for G and H must be at most k:
    # d + l - 1 <= k

    # We solve for l symbolically:
    # l <= k - d + 1

    # Now, we substitute the value d = 1 into the inequality.
    # l <= k - 1 + 1
    # l <= k

    # The maximum integer value for l is k.
    # The final equation is l = k.
