    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know which \"book of manners\" is found in the same manuscript as the Middle English poem *Sir Launfal*.\n2.  **Research the manuscript:** The poem *Sir Launfal* survives in a single manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n3.  **Identify the contents:** This manuscript is a miscellany, containing a collection of different works. I will identify the other texts in this collection.\n4.  **Locate the \"book of manners\":** I will search the list of contents for a text that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" or a courtesy book.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will create a Python script that stores the name of the poem and the book of manners in variables and then prints a sentence that answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the book of manners\n    preserved alongside the poem 'Sir Launfal'.\n    \"\"\"\n    poem_in_question = \"Sir Launfal\"\n    manuscript = \"Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n    book_of_manners = \"The Boke of Curtasye\"\n    common_name = \"The Book of Courtesy\"\n\n    print(f\"The poem '{poem_in_question}' is preserved in the manuscript {manuscript}.\")\n    print(f\"Alongside it is a book of manners known as '{book_of_manners}' (or '{common_name}').\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What book of manners was Sir Launfal preserved alongside?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
