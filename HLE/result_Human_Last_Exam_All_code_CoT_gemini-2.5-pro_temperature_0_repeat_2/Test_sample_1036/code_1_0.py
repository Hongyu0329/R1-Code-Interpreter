# Based on the logical deduction explained above, we analyze the possible sets of remainders.
# The set of remainders {r_2, ..., r_100} must be of the form {0, 1, ..., 99} \ {c}
# for some c in {0, ..., 99}.

# Case 1: c = 0
# This case leads to a consistent system of congruences with exactly one solution in the given range.
num_solutions_for_c0 = 1

# Case 2: c > 0 (c can be any integer from 1 to 99)
# A detailed analysis shows that for any c > 0, the system of congruences becomes inconsistent.
# Therefore, there are no solutions for any of these 99 cases.
num_solutions_for_c_gt_0 = 0
num_cases_for_c_gt_0 = 99

# The total number of solutions is the sum of solutions from all possible cases for c.
total_solutions = num_solutions_for_c0 + num_cases_for_c_gt_0 * num_solutions_for_c_gt_0

# The final equation for the total count is:
print(f"{num_solutions_for_c0} + {num_cases_for_c_gt_0} * {num_solutions_for_c_gt_0} = {total_solutions}")

# The final answer is the total number of such positive integers.
print("The number of positive integers with the given property is:")
