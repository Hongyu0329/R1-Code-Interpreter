    "My plan is to solve this multi-part riddle.\n1.  First, I will analyze the initial clue: \"As Kurt Vonnegut noted, this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.\" This is a known quote where Vonnegut was referring to the philosopher Bertrand Russell.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the second clue, which is also a constraint: \"Name this man in two words that start with the same letter.\"\n3.  I will notice that \"Bertrand Russell\" does not fit this constraint (B and R are different letters). This indicates a trick in the riddle.\n4.  The trick is likely that the Vonnegut clue is not meant to identify Bertrand Russell himself, but to point towards the surname \"Russell\".\n5.  I will then search for a notable person with the surname \"Russell\" whose first name begins with 'R', thus satisfying the \"two words that start with the same letter\" constraint.\n6.  A plausible answer is the contemporary artist Robert Russell, whose name fits the R.R. format and connects to the original clue via the shared surname.\n7.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to print this name, as requested by the prompt format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the man who fits the clues.\n    Clue 1: Associated with Kurt Vonnegut's \"porcupine\" comment, pointing to the surname \"Russell\".\n    Clue 2: Name must be two words starting with the same letter.\n    The solution \"Robert Russell\" fits both clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    first_name = \"Robert\"\n    last_name = \"Russell\"\n    print(f\"{first_name} {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Robert Russell>>>"
