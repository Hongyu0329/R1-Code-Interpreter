# Plan: Calculate the number of carbons in "mercedesbenzene",
# which is the nickname for 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene.

# 1. Define the number of carbons in the base benzene ring.
carbons_in_benzene_ring = 6

# 2. Define the number of methyl groups (the "points" of the star).
number_of_methyl_groups = 3

# 3. Define the number of carbons in each methyl group.
carbons_per_methyl_group = 1

# 4. Calculate the total carbons from the methyl groups.
total_carbons_from_groups = number_of_methyl_groups * carbons_per_methyl_group

# 5. Calculate the total number of carbons in the molecule.
total_carbons = carbons_in_benzene_ring + total_carbons_from_groups

# 6. Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.
