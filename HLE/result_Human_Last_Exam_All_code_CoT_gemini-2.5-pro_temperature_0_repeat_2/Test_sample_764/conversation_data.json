    "The question asks about the equivalence of two different formulations of the Lasso regression: one with a constraint on the L1 norm of the coefficients (the budget form) and one with an L1 penalty term (the Lagrangian form).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship**: The two forms are connected through the principles of Lagrangian duality for convex optimization problems. In general, for a given penalty `Œª`, there is a corresponding budget `t` that yields the same solution, and vice-versa.\n2.  **Consider the \"strictly true\" condition**: This implies the equivalence must hold in all cases. We need to investigate if there are any conditions under which the equivalence of the solution sets breaks down.\n3.  **Investigate non-unique solutions**: The Lasso objective function is a sum of a convex RSS term and a convex L1 penalty. The overall function is strictly convex (guaranteeing a unique solution) only if the RSS term is strictly convex, which requires the predictor matrix `X` to have full column rank. If `p > N` (more predictors than observations) or if predictors are perfectly collinear, the RSS is not strictly convex, and the Lasso solution may not be unique.\n4.  **Construct a counterexample**: We will create a simple case with `p > N` (`p=2`, `N=1`) to see if the solution sets of the two formulations are identical.\n5.  **Demonstrate with Python**: Write a Python script to explicitly define the problem and analyze the solution sets for both formulations, showing whether they are the same.\n6.  **Select the best answer**: Based on the analysis, determine which multiple-choice option accurately describes the relationship.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations and Code\n\nLet's consider a simple case where `N=1` and `p=2`. Let the observation be `y = [1]` and the predictor matrix be `X = [[1, 1]]`.\n\nThe Residual Sum of Squares (RSS) is:\n`RSS(Œ≤) = (y - XŒ≤)¬≤ = (1 - (Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ))¬≤`\n\nThe two Lasso formulations are:\n\n1.  **Constrained Form**: `argmin (1 - Œ≤‚ÇÅ - Œ≤‚ÇÇ)¬≤` subject to `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ| ‚â§ t`\n2.  **Penalized Form**: `argmin (1 - Œ≤‚ÇÅ - Œ≤‚ÇÇ)¬≤ + Œª(|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ|)`\n\nLet's analyze the solution sets for `Œª = 1.0` and a corresponding `t = 0.5`.\n\n*   **Penalized Form (`Œª=1.0`)**: The objective function is minimized by making `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ` close to 1 and `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ|` small. It can be shown that this problem is equivalent to minimizing `(1-s)¬≤ + Œª|s|` where `s = Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ`, with the additional constraint that the solution `(Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ)` must be sparse (i.e., one coefficient is zero) to minimize the `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ|` term for a fixed sum `s`. The optimal sum is `s_opt = 1 - Œª/2 = 0.5`. Therefore, the solution set contains only the two sparse solutions: `(0.5, 0)` and `(0, 0.5)`.\n\n*   **Constrained Form (`t=0.5`)**: We want to minimize `(1 - Œ≤‚ÇÅ - Œ≤‚ÇÇ)¬≤`, which means we want the sum `s = Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ` to be as close to 1 as possible, while respecting the constraint `|Œ≤‚ÇÅ| + |Œ≤‚ÇÇ| ‚â§ 0.5`. The maximum possible value for `s` under this constraint is `0.5`. This maximum is achieved for any pair `(Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ)` such that `Œ≤‚ÇÅ + Œ≤‚ÇÇ = 0.5` and `Œ≤‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÇ ‚â• 0`. This describes the entire line segment connecting the points `(0.5, 0)` and `(0, 0.5)`.\n\nSince the solution set for the penalized form (two points) is not the same as the solution set for the constrained form (a line segment), the equivalence is not strictly true in all cases. It fails when the solution is not unique. However, when the solution is unique (e.g., when `N > p` and `X` has no collinearities), the equivalence holds. This makes the statement \"False in general, but often true in practice\".\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this discrepancy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_lasso_equivalence_issue():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that the solution sets for the constrained\n    and penalized forms of Lasso are not always identical, particularly\n    when the ordinary least squares solution is not unique (e.g., p > N).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Investigating the equivalence of two Lasso formulations.\")\n    print(\"Formulation 1 (Constrained): argmin RSS(b) s.t. ||b||_1 <= t\")\n    print(\"Formulation 2 (Penalized): argmin RSS(b) + lambda * ||b||_1\")\n    print(\"\\nWe use an example where p > N to ensure non-unique solutions:\")\n    print(\"N=1 observation, p=2 predictors.\")\n    # y = 1, X = [[1, 1]]\n    # The residual sum of squares (RSS) is (1 - (b1*x1 + b2*x2))^2 = (1 - b1 - b2)^2\n    print(\"y = [1], X = [[1, 1]]\")\n    print(\"RSS(b) = (1 - b1 - b2)^2\")\n\n    # We choose lambda = 1.0.
