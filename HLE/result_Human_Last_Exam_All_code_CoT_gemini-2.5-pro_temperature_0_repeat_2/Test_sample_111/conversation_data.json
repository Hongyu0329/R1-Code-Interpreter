    "This is a historical question rather than a coding task. The answer can be determined by examining the known facts about Geoffrey Chaucer's life and career.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death. Historical records show she died on September 12, 1368.\n2.  Review Geoffrey Chaucer's biographical information for the year 1368. By 1367, Chaucer was an esquire (*esquier*) in the household of King Edward III.\n3.  This position was based in England, and his duties were connected to the English court.\n4.  Given that Blanche died in England (at Bolingbroke Castle, Lincolnshire) and Chaucer was in service to the English court at the time, the historical consensus is that he was in England. He would later write *The Book of the Duchess* as an elegy for her.\n5.  The following Python code will state this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_chaucer_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to a historical question based on known facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Date of Blanche of Lancaster's death\n    year_of_death = 1368\n\n    # Chaucer's known location and occupation around that time\n    chaucer_occupation = \"Esquire in the royal court of King Edward III\"\n    chaucer_location = \"England\"\n    \n    # The answer choice corresponding to England\n    answer_choice = 'C'\n\n    print(f\"The question is: Where was Geoffrey Chaucer when Blanche of Lancaster died in {year_of_death}?\")\n    print(f\"Based on historical records, Chaucer was an '{chaucer_occupation}'.\")\n    print(f\"This position was based in {chaucer_location}, where Blanche also died.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the correct answer is {answer_choice}: {chaucer_location}.\")\n\nfind_chaucer_location()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
