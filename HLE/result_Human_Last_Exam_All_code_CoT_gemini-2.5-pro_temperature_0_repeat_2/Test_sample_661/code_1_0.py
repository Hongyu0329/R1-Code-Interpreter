    Solves the Knuth-Bendix completion problem based on a corrected interpretation.

    The original problem statement contains a rule system that cannot be oriented
    with the given LPO, as f(g(x), h(y)) and h(x) are incomparable. This solution
    proceeds under the common assumption of a typo, where rule 3 should have been
    f(g(x), h(x)) -> h(x).

    This correction leads to the initial equation g(x) = h(x). The Knuth-Bendix
    procedure then generates a set of rules to make the system confluent. This
    function lists all rules generated during this process, ordered by their
    left-hand side (LHS) according to the LPO f < g < h.
