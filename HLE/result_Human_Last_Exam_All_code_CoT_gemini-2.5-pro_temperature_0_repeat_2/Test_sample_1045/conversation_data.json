    "To solve this, we need to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions (also known as basis functions) for each atom in toluene (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set and then sum them up.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Analyze the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For Carbon (a second-row atom):**\n        *   The core orbital (1s) is described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are split. The inner part is described by 1 contracted function for the 2s orbital and 3 for the 2p orbitals (from 3 primitive Gaussians each). This is 4 functions.\n        *   The outer part is described by 1 contracted function for the 2s orbital and 3 for the 2p orbitals (from 1 primitive Gaussian each). This is another 4 functions.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 functions.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (a first-row atom):**\n        *   It has no core orbitals.\n        *   The valence orbital (1s) is split. The inner part is described by 1 contracted function (from 3 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The outer part is described by 1 contracted function (from 1 primitive Gaussian).\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = 2 functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and add the results together.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from carbon atoms\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from hydrogen atoms\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final calculation breakdown\nprint(\"Calculation for Toluene (C7H8) with 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H) = {total_functions_carbon} + {total_functions_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
