Classification of Fusion Experiments:
========================================

Experiments that use both B and C:
(Elongated/rotating surfaces and a non-planar axis)
- LHD
- Wendelstein 7-X
- NCSX

Experiments that use both A and B:
(Toroidal current and elongated/rotating surfaces)
- Tokamaks
- Reversed Field Pinches

Experiments that use only property B:
- None

Experiments that use A, B, and C:
- None

========================================
Note: The prompt's categories ('Only B', 'B and C', 'A, B, and C') do not fully cover the listed devices.
Tokamaks and RFPs use properties A and B. The classification above shows where each device fits based on its physical principles.
