# Question 1: How many carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1?
# Step 1: Compound 11 is cis-2-butene-1,4-diol, which has 4 carbon atoms (HO-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OH).
# Step 2: Ozonolysis of the double bond cleaves the 4-carbon chain into two identical 2-carbon fragments, yielding aldehyde 12 (TESO-CH2-CHO).
# Step 3: The synthesis proceeds using one of these 2-carbon fragments.
# Step 4: The subsequent reactions (Henry, Michael addition, Wittig, Nef, RCM, oxidation, etc.) modify other parts of the molecule, but this 2-carbon backbone is preserved and is part of the final product, compound 1.
# Therefore, 2 carbons from compound 11 are present in compound 1.
carbons_from_11_in_1 = 2

# Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?
# Step 1: Compound 11 has 2 oxygen atoms, one in each hydroxy group.
# Step 2: After ozonolysis, the 2-carbon fragment used for the synthesis (aldehyde 12) contains one of these original oxygen atoms (protected as a TES ether, TESO-).
# Step 3: This TESO- group, containing one oxygen from compound 11, is carried through the synthesis in compounds 10, 7, and 13.
# Step 4: Compound 14 is formed via a Nef reaction on compound 13. This reaction converts the nitro group to an aldehyde and does not affect the TESO- group.
# Therefore, 1 oxygen from compound 11 is present in compound 14.
oxygens_from_11_in_14 = 1

# Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
# Step 1: The synthesis proceeds from compound 10 to compound 7. A product (7) cannot contribute atoms to a reactant (10) that was consumed to make it.
# Step 2: The question is likely a typo and is intended to ask "How many nitrogen atoms are in compound 10?" or "How many nitrogen atoms from 10 are in 7?".
# Step 3: Compound 10 is a nitroolefin, formed from aldehyde 12 and nitromethane (MeNO2). The nitro group (-NO2) from nitromethane is added, which contains one nitrogen atom.
# Step 4: This single nitrogen atom is present in compound 10 and is subsequently carried over into compound 7.
# Based on this logical interpretation, the answer is 1.
nitrogens_question = 1

# The final answer is the combination of the three numbers.
# The prompt asks to "output each number in the final equation".
# We will print the three numbers separated by commas.
