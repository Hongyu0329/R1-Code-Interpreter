    "To find the maximal chromatic number of a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Graph Operation:** The \"sum\" of graphs refers to the graph join operation. The join of two graphs, \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), is formed by taking their disjoint union and adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\). The graph \\( G \\) is the join of three cycles of length \\( n \\), which we can denote as \\( C_n + C_n + C_n \\).\n\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:** A key property of the graph join is that its chromatic number is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs. For \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), the chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) \\).\n\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on the parity of its length \\( n \\):\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even (\\( n \\ge 4 \\)), the cycle is bipartite, and its chromatic number is 2.\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd (\\( n \\ge 3 \\)), the cycle is not bipartite, and its chromatic number is 3.\n\n4.  **Maximize the Chromatic Number:** To find the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\), we must choose \\( n \\) such that \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is maximized. The maximum value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is any odd number.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Result:** By substituting the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into our equation for \\( \\chi(G) \\), we get the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\).\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Explain the relationship between the chromatic number of the sum of graphs\n    # and the individual graphs.\n    print(\"The graph G is the sum (join) of three cycles of length n.\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a graph join is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximal chromatic number of a single cycle C_n.\n    # chi(C_n) = 2 for even n, and 3 for odd n.
