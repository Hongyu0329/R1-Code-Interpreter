    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to scan the Latin line:\n\nFirst, I will identify the meter of the line. The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from the Roman playwright Plautus and is an **iambic senarius**. This meter consists of six iambic feet (an iamb is a short syllable followed by a long one: S L).\n\nSecond, I will note that Plautine meter is famously flexible. It allows for many substitutions, where other types of feet can replace the standard iambs. Also, phonological phenomena like elision (dropping a final vowel before an initial vowel) and prodelision (dropping an initial vowel after a final vowel) are common.\n\nThird, to make the line fit the meter, I will apply prodelision to the words \"bene esse,\" which become \"bene 'sse\". This is a crucial step.\n\nFourth, I will determine the quantity (long or short) of each syllable in the modified line based on the rules of Latin prosody (vowel length, diphthongs, and length by position).\n\nFinally, I will group the syllables into six metrical feet, showing the substitutions used, and format the result as requested with \"L\" for long, \"S\" for short, and a space separating each foot.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the scansion:\n*   **Line**: `et tibi bene 'sse soli quom sibi sit male`\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti bi` -> Dactyl (`L S S`)\n*   **Foot 2**: `be ne 'sse` -> Tribrach (`S S S`)\n*   **Foot 3**: `so li` -> Spondee (`L L`)\n*   **Foot 4**: `quom si` -> Trochee (`L S`)\n*   **Foot 5**: `bi sit` -> Iamb (`S L`)\n*   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> Pyrrhic (`S S`)\n\nHere is the Python code to display the result.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of the Latin line.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    Feet are separated by a space.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The line is an iambic senarius: et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\n    # Scansion breakdown:\n    # Foot 1: et ti bi (L S S) - Dactyl\n    # Foot 2: be ne 'sse (S S S) - Tribrach (prodelision of esse)\n    # Foot 3: so li (L L) - Spondee\n    # Foot 4: quom si (L S) - Trochee\n    # Foot 5: bi sit (S L) - Iamb\n    # Foot 6: ma le (S S) - Pyrrhic\n    \n    foot1 = \"L S S\"\n    foot2 = \"S S S\"\n    foot3 = \"L L\"\n    foot4 = \"L S\"\n    foot5 = \"S L\"\n    foot6 = \"S S\"\n    \n    # Joining feet with a space as requested\n    scansion = \" \".join([foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4, foot5, foot6])\n    \n    print(scansion)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n```\n<<<L S S S S S L L L S S L S S>>>"
