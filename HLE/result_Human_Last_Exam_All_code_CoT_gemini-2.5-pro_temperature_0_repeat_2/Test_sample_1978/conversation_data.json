    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System Dimension**: The problem describes a system of differential equations. The matrix `A` is given as a 202000x202000 matrix, and the vector `I(t)` has 202000 components. This determines the dimension of the system, `n = 202000`. The description of `x(t)` only showing components up to 2024 is illustrative, not restrictive.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Boundary Conditions**: The problem provides six boundary conditions. We need to determine how many of these are linearly independent.\n    *   `x₁(T) - x₁(0) = 0`\n    *   `x₂(T) - x₂(0) = 0`\n    *   `5x₂(T) - 5x₂(0) = 0` (This is 5 times the second condition)\n    *   `100x₂(T) - 100x₂(0) = 0` (This is 100 times the second condition)\n    *   `1000x₂(0) - 1000x₂(T) = 0` (This is -1000 times the second condition)\n    *   `100x₂₀₂₄(T) - 100x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0` (This is equivalent to `x₂₀₂₄(T) - x₂₀₂₄(0) = 0`)\n    By inspection, the conditions on `x₂` are all multiples of each other. Therefore, we have only three unique, linearly independent boundary conditions, which constrain the components `x₁`, `x₂`, and `x₂₀₂₄`. The number of independent conditions is `k = 3`.\n\n3.  **Define the Index**: The \"index\" of a linear boundary-value problem refers to the Fredholm index of the associated linear operator `L`, where `L(x) = (x' - Ax, BoundaryConditions(x))`. The index is defined as:\n    `Index = dim(ker(L)) - dim(coker(L))`\n    where `ker(L)` is the kernel (null space) of the operator and `coker(L)` is its cokernel.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Dimension of the Kernel (dim(ker(L)))**: The kernel of `L` is the set of solutions to the homogeneous problem `x'(t) = Ax(t)` that also satisfy the homogeneous boundary conditions.\n    *   Since `A` is diagonal, the solution is `xᵢ(t) = xᵢ(0) * exp(-t/Rᵢ)`.\n    *   The boundary condition for a constrained component `i` (where `i` is 1, 2, or 2024) is `xᵢ(T) - xᵢ(0) = 0`.\n    *   Substituting the solution gives `xᵢ(0) * exp(-T/Rᵢ) - xᵢ(0) = 0`, or `xᵢ(0) * (exp(-T/Rᵢ) - 1) = 0`.\n    *   Assuming `Rᵢ` and `T` are positive, `exp(-T/Rᵢ) - 1` is non-zero. Thus, `xᵢ(0)` must be 0 for `i = 1, 2, 2024`.\n    *   The initial state vector `x(0)` has `k=3` of its components fixed to zero. The remaining `n - k` components can be chosen freely.\n    *   The dimension of the space of solutions to the homogeneous problem is the number of free parameters, so `dim(ker(L)) = n - k`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Dimension of the Cokernel (dim(coker(L)))**: The dimension of the cokernel corresponds to the number of solvability conditions for the non-homogeneous problem. For this underdetermined system (where `n > k`), the operator `L` is surjective, meaning a solution exists for any forcing function `I(t)`. This implies there are no additional constraints on the input, and the cokernel is trivial. Thus, `dim(coker(L)) = 0`.\n\n6.  **Compute the Final Index**: Combine the results from the previous steps to calculate the index.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bvp_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system.\n    # The matrix A is 202000x202000, so the system dimension n is 202000.\n    n = 202000\n    print(f\"The dimension of the system is n = {n}.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions.\n    # The given boundary conditions are:\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # 3. 5*x_2(T) - 5*x_2(0) = 0  (dependent on 2)\n    # 4. 100*x_2(T) - 100*x_2(0) = 0 (dependent on 2)\n    # 5. 1000*x_2(0) - 1000*x_2(T) = 0 (dependent on 2)\n    # 6. 100*x_2024(T) - 100*x_2024(0) = 0 (equivalent to x_2024(T) - x_2024(0) = 0)\n    # The independent conditions constrain components x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n    k = 3\n    print(f\"The number of linearly independent boundary conditions is k = {k}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Define the index of the problem.\n    # Index = dim(ker(L)) - dim(coker(L))\n    # where L is the linear operator for the BVP.\n    print(\"\\nThe index of the problem is defined as Index = dim(ker(L)) - dim(coker(L)).\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the dimension of the kernel of L.\n    # dim(ker(L)) is the number of free parameters in the solution to the homogeneous problem.\n    # Each independent boundary condition removes one degree of freedom.\n    dim_ker_L = n - k\n    print(f\"The dimension of the kernel is dim(ker(L)) = n - k = {n} - {k} = {dim_ker_L}.\")\n\n    # Step 5: Calculate the dimension of the cokernel of L.\n    # For this underdetermined system, the operator L is surjective,\n    # meaning a solution exists for any forcing term.\n    # This implies the cokernel is trivial.\n    dim_coker_L = 0\n    print(f\"The dimension of the cokernel is dim(coker(L)) = {dim_coker_L}.\")\n\n    # Step 6: Compute the final index.\n    index = dim_ker_L - dim_coker_L\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Index = dim(ker(L)) - dim(coker(L)) = {dim_ker_L} - {dim_coker_L} = {index}\")\n    \n    return index\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    final_index = solve_bvp_index()\n    print(f\"\\n<<<The index of the considered problem is {final_index}.>>>\")\n\n```\n<<<201997>>>"
