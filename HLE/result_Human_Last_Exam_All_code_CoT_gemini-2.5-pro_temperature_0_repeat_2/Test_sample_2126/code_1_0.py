# The problem simplifies under the assumption that the function v(x,t)
# is separable in the form v(x,t) = f(x) + g(t).
# Let w(x,t) = D_x^{1/2} v(x,t) = D_x^{1/2} (f(x) + g(t)) = D_x^{1/2} f(x).
# The result w(x,t) is a function of x only.
# The second step is to compute D_t^{1/2} w(x,t).
# Since w(x,t) does not depend on t, its derivative with respect to t is 0.
# The Caputo fractional derivative of a function that is constant with respect to
# the variable of differentiation is 0.
# Therefore, the final quantity is 0.

# The equation to be printed is the final value.
final_value = 0

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Since the final value is a single number, we just print it.
