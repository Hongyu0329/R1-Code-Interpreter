w, r, d, M, j = sympy.symbols('w r d M j')

# Part (a): Find the condition for x^d * a * r = 0.
# Based on the derivation x^n * r = w^n * r, we have:
# x^d * (a * r) = w^d * (a * r)
# For this to be 0 for all a and r, the condition is w^d = 0.
condition_a = sympy.Eq(w**d, 0)

# Part (b): Derive the expression for x^d * r.
# Based on the derivation x^n * r = w^n * r, for n=d:
expression_b = w**d * r

# Part (c): Can x^j * a * r for j >= M be zero?
# The expression is w^j * (a * r).
# This can be zero if, for example, w = 0. The problem's conditions do not forbid this.
# So, yes, it can be zero.

# The final output will be printed in the required format.
