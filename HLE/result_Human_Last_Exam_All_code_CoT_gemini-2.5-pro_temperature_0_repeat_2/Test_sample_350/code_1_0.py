# The user wants to identify the two key historical philosophers or theologians
# that Wolfhart Pannenberg drew upon for his argument about cosmic history and contingent time.
# Based on the analysis of Pannenberg's theology:
# 1. Georg Hegel's philosophy of history is the foundational dialogue partner for Pannenberg's own "theology of history."
# 2. Friedrich Schelling's later philosophy of nature and his concept of contingency provided the framework for Pannenberg to expand his theology of history into a "cosmic history" that engages with modern physics.
# Therefore, the correct pair is Georg Hegel and Friedrich Schelling.
# This corresponds to option E.
