# This script prints the solution to the model theory problem based on the analysis above.

# Part (a): The O-definable subsets.
# Based on the automorphism group of the model, the only invariant subsets are the trivial ones.

# Part (b): O-minimality.
# The definable set Q = {x | V(x, 0)} is a counterexample to o-minimality.

# Part (c): Quantifier Elimination.
# The density of the Q-cosets allows for the elimination of quantifiers.
