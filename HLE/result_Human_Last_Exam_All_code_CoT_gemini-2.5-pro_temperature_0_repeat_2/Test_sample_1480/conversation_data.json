    "To calculate the rule activation level for a fuzzy rule, we combine the firing level of the rule's antecedent (the \"IF\" part) with the membership function of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part). This combination is performed using a t-norm operation, which is a mathematical function that models a fuzzy logical \"AND\".\n\nThe most common t-norms are the **minimum** and **product** operators. Since the specific t-norm was not mentioned, I will use the **minimum** operator, which is the most widely used for this purpose.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the given values: the antecedent firing level `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and the consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values to find the rule activation level.\n3.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given values\n# Phi_k(x') is the firing level of the rule's antecedent\nphi_k = 0.7\n# muG_k_j(y_j) is the membership degree of the consequent\nmu_g = 0.9\n\n# The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm operation\n# to the antecedent's firing level and the consequent's membership degree.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm, which is the most common choice.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_g)\n\n# Print the final equation showing the inputs and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated as: min({phi_k}, {mu_g})\")\nprint(f\"Result: {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
