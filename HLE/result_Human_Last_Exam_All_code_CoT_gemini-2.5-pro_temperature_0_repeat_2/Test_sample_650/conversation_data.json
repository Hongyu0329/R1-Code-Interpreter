    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step analysis of the algorithm's time complexity, presented in a Python script as requested.\n\n### Plan for Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify Input Size**: The primary input is the integer `n`. The size of this input for complexity analysis is the number of bits required to represent it, which we'll call `k`. Note that `k` is proportional to `log n`.\n2.  **Analyze the Loop**: The algorithm's runtime is dominated by the `while` loop. I will determine how many times this loop executes as a function of the input size `k`.\n3.  **Analyze Work per Iteration**: I will determine the computational cost of the operations inside the loop (`division`, `multiplication`, `subtraction`). For a general algorithm, we must assume `n` can be arbitrarily large, so these are not O(1) operations. Their cost depends on the number of bits in the numbers being processed.\n4.  **Calculate Total Complexity**: By multiplying the number of iterations by the cost of each iteration (and summing correctly, as the cost per iteration changes), I will derive the final time complexity in terms of `n`.\n\nHere is the Python script that prints the detailed analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"--- Time Complexity Analysis of IMAG(n, c) ---\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define Input Size\")\n    print(\"The algorithm takes an integer 'n' as input. In complexity analysis, the input size is the number of bits required to represent 'n'.\")\n    print(\"Let k be the number of bits in n. Then, k is proportional to log₂(n). We write this as k = O(log n).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine the Number of Loop Iterations\")\n    print(\"The 'while q > 0' loop is the core of the algorithm. In each iteration, the variable 'x' is replaced by 'q', where q = ⌊x/c⌋.\")\n    print(\"This means the value of the number being processed is divided by the base 'c' in each step.\")\n    print(\"The loop will run until the number becomes 0. The number of times you can divide n by c is log_c(n).\")\n    print(\"So, the number of iterations is O(log_c(n)). Using the logarithm change of base rule, this is O(log n / log c).\")\n    print(\"Since c is a constant (c ≥ 2), the number of iterations is simply O(log n).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Determine the Cost of Operations Inside the Loop\")\n    print(\"The main operations are `q := ⌊x/c⌋` and `a_i := x - qc`. These are integer division and modulo operations.\")\n    print(\"For arbitrarily large integers, the cost of these operations depends on the number of bits. The cost to divide a k-bit number by a d-bit number (where d=O(log c)) is O(k * d).\")\n    print(\"The number of bits in the variable 'x' decreases in each iteration. It starts at O(log n) and decreases.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the Total Time Complexity\")\n    print(\"To find the total time, we sum the costs of all O(log n) iterations.\")\n    print(\"The cost of the first iteration is O(log(n) * log(c)). The cost of the second is O(log(n/c) * log(c)), and so on.\")\n    print(\"The total time T(n) is the sum of these costs:\")\n    print(\"T(n) = O( Σ_{i=0 to log_c(n)} [ (log n - i*log c) * log c ] )\")\n    print(\"This can be simplified.
