    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we need to identify its heptad repeat pattern `(abcdefg)n` and analyze the amino acids at the core `a` and `d` positions. The size and shape of these core residues dictate the packing efficiency and, consequently, the number of helices in the coiled-coil.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will write a Python script to analyze the input sequence: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`.\n2.  The script will test all seven possible alignments (frames) of the heptad repeat pattern against the sequence.\n3.  For each frame, it will identify the residues at the `a` and `d` positions and calculate a \"hydrophobicity score\" to find the most likely alignment. The best alignment is the one that places the most hydrophobic residues at these core positions.\n4.  Once the optimal frame is identified, the script will analyze the composition of its `a` and `d` residues based on established principles:\n    *   **Dimers (2-helices)** are often characterized by Leucine (L) at the `d` position and a beta-branched residue (Isoleucine 'I' or Valine 'V') at the `a` position.\n    *   **Trimers (3-helices)** frequently have Leucine (L) at the `a` position and a beta-branched residue (I/V) or Leucine (L) at the `d` position.\n    *   **Tetramers (4-helices)** typically require beta-branched residues (I/V) at both the `a` and `d` positions for stable packing.\n5.  The script will apply these rules to the identified core residues to predict the most probable oligomeric state and print the step-by-step reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing protein sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Find the optimal heptad repeat frame ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the optimal heptad repeat (abcdefg) frame.\")\n    print(\"The best frame maximizes the hydrophobicity of the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\\n\")\n\n    # Scoring for hydrophobicity\n    hydrophobic_scores = {'L': 2, 'I': 2, 'V': 2, 'W': 2, 'F': 2, 'M': 2, 'A': 1, 'Y': 1}\n    \n    best_frame_info = {\n        'offset': -1,\n        'score': -1,\n        'a_residues': [],\n        'd_residues': []\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through all 7 possible frames (by changing the start offset)\n    for offset in range(7):\n        a_residues = []\n        d_residues = []\n        current_score = 0\n        \n        for i, residue in enumerate(sequence):\n            # Heptad position (0-6) corresponds to (a-g)\n            heptad_pos_index = (i - offset + 7) % 7\n            \n            if heptad_pos_index == 0:  # 'a' position\n                a_residues.append(residue)\n                current_score += hydrophobic_scores.get(residue, 0)\n            elif heptad_pos_index == 3:  # 'd' position\n                d_residues.append(residue)\n                current_score += hydrophobic_scores.get(residue, 0)\n        \n        if current_score > best_frame_info['score']:\n            best_frame_info['score'] = current_score\n            best_frame_info['offset'] = offset\n            best_frame_info['a_residues'] = a_residues\n            best_frame_info['d_residues'] = d_residues\n\n    a_res = best_frame_info['a_residues']\n    d_res = best_frame_info['d_residues']\n    \n    print(\"Optimal frame identified.
