To determine whether Kenneth Burke's "Tribal No" is in the realm of motion or action, we must first understand his distinction between these two terms.

1.  **Realm of Motion:** For Burke, this is the non-symbolic realm. It encompasses the purely physical, biological, and sensory world. A rock falling, a planet orbiting, or a body digesting food are all instances of motion. There is no choice, motive, or morality involved. Nature, in its raw state, is the realm of motion.

2.  **Realm of Action:** This is the uniquely human realm of the "symbol-using animal." Action is symbolic and involves choice, purpose, and motive. Crucially, action is impossible without the "Negative."

3.  **The Negative:** The concept of "no" or "not" is a purely linguistic invention, according to Burke. Nature has no negative; a tree is a tree, it is not "not-a-rock." The negative allows for the creation of rules, commandments, and prohibitions (e.g., "Thou shalt *not*..."). This introduction of the negative creates the possibility of obedience and disobedience, and thus, moral choice.

4.  **The "Tribal No":** This refers to the foundational, shared prohibitions and commandments that structure a society. It is the collective set of "don'ts" that define a culture's moral landscape.

**Conclusion:**
The "Tribal No" is fundamentally a symbolic construct. It is built upon the linguistic principle of the negative and exists to create a framework for moral choice. It is not a sensory object or a biological process (motion). Instead, it is a product of the collective human imagination, a set of ideas that govern behavior. Therefore, the "Tribal No" is squarely in the realm of **Action**, and its nature is **imaginal** because it is a concept imagined and sustained by the community through language.
