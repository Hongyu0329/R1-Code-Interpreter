    Solves the problem of finding the Lebesgue measure of the set S.

    The problem asks for the Lebesgue measure of the set S of points x_0 in [0,1]
    such that the sequence defined by x_{n+1} = f(x_n) with f(x) = (2x + sin(2*pi*x))/3
    contains exactly 7 distinct values.

    1.  Condition for the set of values to be finite:
        For the sequence {x_n} to have a finite number of distinct values, it must be
        eventually periodic. This means that after a certain number of initial terms (the tail),
        the sequence repeats in a cycle.

    2.  Condition for exactly 7 distinct values:
        If the sequence has exactly 7 distinct values, it must be of the form
        {x_0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6}, where these values are all distinct.
        The next term, x_7 = f(x_6), must be one of these 7 values. Let's say x_7 = x_k
        for some k in {0, 1, ..., 6}.
        This implies that x_k is a periodic point, and x_0 is a point that lands on this
        periodic orbit after k steps. The set S is the collection of all such points x_0.

    3.  Nature of the set of periodic points:
        A point x is periodic with period p if f^p(x) = x (and p is the smallest such integer).
        The function f(x) is an analytic function (it has a convergent Taylor series everywhere).
        For an analytic function, an equation like f^p(x) - x = 0 can only have a finite
        number of solutions in a compact interval like [0,1], unless f^p(x) - x is identically zero.
        We can verify that f^p(x) is not the identity function for any p. For p=1, f(x)=x
        means sin(2*pi*x) = x, which only holds for isolated points (x=0 and x approx 0.736).
        For p>1, if f^p(x) were the identity on an interval, its derivative would be 1 on that
        interval. The derivative of f^p(x) is a product of terms like f'(f^j(x)). This would
        require f'(x) to be constant on an interval, which is clearly not the case for
        f'(x) = (2 + 2*pi*cos(2*pi*x))/3.
        Therefore, the set of periodic points of any period p is a finite set.

    4.  The nature of the set S:
        The set of all periodic points is the union of all p-periodic points for p=1, 2, ...
        This is a countable union of finite sets, which means the set of all periodic points is countable.
        The set S consists of points that are preimages of these periodic points. The set of all
        preimages of a countable set under f is also a countable set.

    5.  Lebesgue measure of a countable set:
        A fundamental theorem in measure theory states that any countable subset of the real numbers
        has a Lebesgue measure of zero.

    6.  Conclusion:
        Since S is a countable set, its Lebesgue measure is 0.
