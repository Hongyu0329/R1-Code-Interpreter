    # The problem reduces to solving a system of constraints on the number of vertices.
    # Let k be the number of r-vertices (poles) in ]0,1[.
    # Let a be the number of p-vertices (zeros) in ]0,1[.
    # Let b be the number of q-vertices (preimages of 1) in ]0,1[.
    
    # From the properties of the specified "simple dessin", we can deduce two main relations:
    # 1. a + b + k = d (from Riemann-Hurwitz, where d is the degree of the function)
    # 2. a + b + k = 2*d - 4 (from the property that all critical points are real)
    
    # Equating these gives d = 2*d - 4, which implies d = 4.
    d = 4
    
    # Substituting d=4 back into the first equation gives:
    # a + b + k = 4
    
    # An additional constraint derived from analyzing the function's behavior is b >= k.
    # To maximize k, we should minimize a. Let's set a = 0.
    a = 0

    # The inequality is b >= k.
