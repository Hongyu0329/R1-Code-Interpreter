    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Diels-Alder reaction. Here is my plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:** The first reactant is butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene), which is a conjugated diene. The second reactant is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, which is an alkene and will act as the dienophile. The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a Diels-Alder reaction, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition that forms a six-membered ring.\n\n2.  **Determine the Product's Structure:**\n    *   The four carbons of the diene (CH2=CH-CH=CH2) and the two carbons of the dienophile (CCl2=CF2) will form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   The pi electrons rearrange: the two double bonds from the diene and one from the dienophile are consumed to form two new carbon-carbon single bonds and one new carbon-carbon double bond within the ring.\n    *   The resulting ring is a cyclohexene derivative. The new double bond is located between the two central carbons of the original diene.\n    *   The substituents from the dienophile (two chlorine atoms and two fluorine atoms) remain attached to their respective carbons in the newly formed ring.\n\n3.  **Name the Product:** The final structure is a cyclohexene ring substituted with two chlorine atoms on one carbon and two fluorine atoms on the adjacent carbon. Following IUPAC nomenclature rules to give the substituents the lowest possible numbering, the product is named **3,3-dichloro-4,4-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will print out this step-by-step reasoning, the final balanced chemical equation, and the name of the product. It will also extract and print the numerical values from the chemical formula equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the reactants and reaction type.\")\n    print(\"Reactant 1 (Diene): 1,3-Butadiene (C4H6)\")\n    print(\"Reactant 2 (Dienophile): 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (C2Cl2F2)\")\n    print(\"This is a [4+2] cycloaddition known as the Diels-Alder reaction, which forms a six-membered ring.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Predicting the product structure.\")\n    print(\"The 4 carbons of the diene and the 2 carbons of the dienophile combine.\")\n    print(\"A new cyclohexene ring is formed.
