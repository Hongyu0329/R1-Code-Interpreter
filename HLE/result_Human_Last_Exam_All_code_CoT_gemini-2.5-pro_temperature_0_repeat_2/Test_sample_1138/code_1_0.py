        "The premise states: 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)'.",
        "This premise contains a contradiction. Standard, properly implemented ECDSA is designed to be existentially *unforgeable* under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA), which is a core security goal. It is not considered 'existentially forgeable'.",
        "",
        "Step 2: Formulate a consistent interpretation.",
        "To resolve this contradiction, we should assume the question refers to a scenario where ECDSA is broken or flawed, making it forgeable. A well-known vulnerability that makes ECDSA forgeable is 'nonce reuse', where the same secret random number (k) is used to sign two different messages. This critical flaw not only allows for forgeries but also enables an attacker to calculate and recover the secret key (sk).",
        "",
        "Step 3: Evaluate the answer choices based on this 'broken ECDSA' interpretation.",
        "A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.",
        "This statement claims that creating a second, different signature for the same message is hard. However, in our 'broken ECDSA' scenario where the secret key 'sk' is recoverable, an adversary can easily generate any number of new signatures for any message. Thus, this statement is FALSE.",
        "",
        "B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.",
        "This statement claims that recovering the secret key is hard. As explained, the nonce reuse flaw allows a computationally bounded adversary to recover 'sk' with a high (non-negligible) probability. Thus, this statement is FALSE.",
        "",
        "D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.",
        "This statement claims that for ALL forgeable schemes, it's hard to recover the message from the signature. The 'for all' quantifier makes this a very strong claim. It's possible to construct a signature scheme that is both forgeable and allows for message recovery. Therefore, this statement is likely FALSE.",
        "",
        "C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.",
        "This statement claims that there exists at least one forgeable scheme where an adversary can create a signature for a given message 'm'. Our 'broken ECDSA' example fits this perfectly. Since the adversary can recover the secret key, they can generate a valid signature for any message 'm' they are given. This confirms the existence of such a scheme. Thus, this statement is TRUE.",
        "",
        "Step 4: Conclusion.",
        "Based on a consistent interpretation that resolves the question's premise, statement C is the only one that holds true."
