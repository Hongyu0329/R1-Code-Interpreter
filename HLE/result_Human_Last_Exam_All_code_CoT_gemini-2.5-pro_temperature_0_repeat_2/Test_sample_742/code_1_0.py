    print("--- Analyzing the Question: Can Quantum Mechanics Prove Gödel's God? ---")
    print("\nStep 1: Understanding Gödel's Ontological Proof")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("Gödel's proof is not a physical or numerical calculation. It is a formal argument in modal logic (specifically, S5 logic).")
    print("Key characteristics:")
    print("  - It starts with a set of axioms and definitions (e.g., defining 'God' as a being with all 'positive properties').")
    print("  - It uses logical deduction to show that from these axioms, the necessary existence of such a being follows.")
    print("  - Its validity is confined to its own logical system. It doesn't make claims about the physical world, only about what is true if you accept its initial axioms.")
    print("  - There are no numerical equations in the proof, only logical symbols and propositions.")

    print("\nStep 2: Understanding the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics (QM)")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The mathematics of QM is designed to describe the behavior of the physical universe at the subatomic level.")
    print("Key mathematical tools:")
    print("  - Hilbert Spaces: Abstract vector spaces where the state of a system is represented.")
    print("  - Linear Operators: Mathematical objects that represent physical observables (e.g., position, momentum).")
    print("  - Schrödinger Equation: A differential equation describing how a quantum state evolves over time.")
    print("  - Probability Theory: Used to predict the outcomes of measurements.")
    print("The goal of this math is to create models that match experimental results. It is a framework for physics, not abstract metaphysics.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Fundamental Disconnect (The Answer)")
    print("-------------------------------------------------")
    print("It is not possible to use the mathematics of QM to prove Gödel's entities. This is a 'category error'.")
    print("Reasons:")
    print("  1. Different Domains: QM describes physical reality. Gödel's proof explores a system of abstract logic. One is descriptive of the cosmos, the other is a self-contained logical argument.")
    print("  2. Incompatible Tools: The concepts in Gödel's proof ('positive property', 'necessary existence') have no corresponding mathematical object or operator in a Hilbert space. There is no 'God operator' in the Schrödinger equation.")
    print("  3. No 'Final Equation': The request to 'output each number in the final equation' cannot be fulfilled because no such equation connecting the two exists. The frameworks are fundamentally incommensurable.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is unequipped to address the axioms or conclusions of Gödel's ontological proof. The two operate in entirely separate conceptual and mathematical universes.")
