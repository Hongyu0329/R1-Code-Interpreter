    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The method involves stacking the two matrices and then using elementary row operations to reduce the stacked matrix to a simpler form. The resulting non-zero part of the matrix will be a GCRD.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using Python's `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n2.  Create a single stacked matrix `M` by vertically joining P1 and P2, i.e., `M = [P1; P2]`.\n3.  Perform a sequence of elementary row operations on `M` to transform it into a row-echelon form. The elementary operations are:\n    a. Swapping two rows.\n    b. Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    c. Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n4.  The goal is to reduce `M` to the form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix. This matrix `G` is a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n5.  The GCRD is not unique. Any GCRD can be multiplied on the left by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant) to get another valid GCRD. We will simplify our resulting `G` to its most basic form, which is often the identity matrix if the original matrices are right coprime.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_greatest_common_right_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    given polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using the Euclidean algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # --- Begin Euclidean Algorithm via Elementary Row Operations ---\n\n    # To simplify the process, we want a row with a constant pivot.\n    # We can achieve this by adding row 4 to row 3.\n    # M[2, :] corresponds to the 3rd row (0-indexed).\n    # Operation: R3 -> R3 + R4\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + M[3, :]\n\n    # Now, row 3 is [-1, 1].
