    # Step 1: Define the problem and relevant terms.
    print("--- Problem Definition ---")
    print("The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of nonprincipal ultrafilters on the natural numbers (N), where all elements of the antichain are 'below' a fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V.")
    print("\nKey terms:")
    print("- Nonprincipal Ultrafilter: A maximal collection of 'large' subsets of N. 'Nonprincipal' means it contains all cofinite sets.")
    print("- The relation U <= V: This means there exists a nondecreasing, finite-to-one function f: N -> N such that U is the pushforward of V by f (i.e., U = {A subset of N | f^{-1}(A) is in V}). This is a standard order in set theory known as the Tukey order.")
    print("- Antichain: A set of ultrafilters where for any two distinct elements U1 and U2, neither U1 <= U2 nor U2 <= U1 holds.")

    # Step 2: Establish an upper bound.
    print("\n--- Upper Bound ---")
    print("An ultrafilter U is below V if it is generated by a nondecreasing, finite-to-one function f.")
    print("The number of such functions f: N -> N is equal to the cardinality of the continuum, c = 2^aleph_0.")
    print("Therefore, for a fixed V, there can be at most 2^aleph_0 ultrafilters below it. This means the size of any antichain is also at most 2^aleph_0.")

    # Step 3: The construction for a lower bound.
    print("\n--- Construction of a Large Antichain ---")
    print("To find a lower bound, we construct an antichain of size 2^aleph_0. This construction, due to Andreas Blass, works for any given nonprincipal ultrafilter V.")
    print("1. Start with an 'almost disjoint' family of sets: This is a family {A_x} of infinite subsets of N, indexed by a set X of size 2^aleph_0, such that for any distinct x, y in X, the intersection A_x intersect A_y is finite.")
    print("2. Define a family of functions {f_x} based on {A_x}: For each x in X, define a function f_x: N -> N as follows:")
    print("   f_x(n) = max( {2k | k <= n and k is in A_x} U {2k+1 | k <= n and k is not in A_x} )")
    print("   Each function f_x can be shown to be nondecreasing and finite-to-one.")

    # Step 4: The result of the construction.
    print("\n--- Result ---")
    print("For any fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V, we define a family of ultrafilters {U_x} by taking the pushforward: U_x = (f_x)_*(V).")
    print("The core of the proof is to show that for any two distinct indices x and y, the ultrafilters U_x and U_y are incomparable under the Tukey order.")
    print("This relies on the fact that A_x and A_y are almost disjoint, which makes the functions f_x and f_y sufficiently different.")
    print("This means the family {U_x | x in X} is an antichain. The size of this antichain is |X| = 2^aleph_0.")

    # Step 5: Conclusion.
    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The construction provides a lower bound of 2^aleph_0 for the size of the antichain.")
    print("Since the upper bound is also 2^aleph_0, the largest possible cardinality is exactly 2^aleph_0.")
