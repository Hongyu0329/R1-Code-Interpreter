# The user wants to compute the partial derivative D_x rho(alpha, beta).
# Let's denote the point by (a, b) instead of (alpha, beta) to avoid confusion with the curve variable x.
# The task is to compute the partial derivative of the signed distance function rho(a, b)
# with respect to 'a', evaluated at a point where the L-infinity nearest point on the curve y=x^5 is (1,1).

print("For the function f(x) = max(g(x), h(x)) to have a minimum at x_0, it's generally required that g(x_0) = h(x_0).")

print("This, combined with the condition that (alpha, beta) is above the curve (beta >= alpha^5), implies that alpha < 1 and beta > 1.")
