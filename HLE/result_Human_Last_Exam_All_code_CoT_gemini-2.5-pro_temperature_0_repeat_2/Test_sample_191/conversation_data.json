    "My plan is to answer your biological question using a Python script as requested. The question is about identifying a specific protein related to amyloid engulfment by macrophages.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan:\n1.  I will create a Python script that simulates a query to a biological knowledge base.\n2.  The script will store the name of the protein and a brief explanation of its role in a variable.\n3.  The script will then print this information to the console.\n4.  As per your instructions, I will make sure to highlight the number associated with the protein, treating it as the 'number in the final equation'.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the protein whose breakdown\n    facilitates the macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the protein, its key numerical component, and the explanation.\n    protein_name = \"Complement C3\"\n    protein_component_number = 3\n    explanation = (\n        \"When the protein Complement C3 is broken down (cleaved) into its active fragments, \"\n        \"such as C3b, it coats amyloid plaques. This process, called opsonization, \"\n        \"acts as a signal, allowing macrophages (like microglia in the brain) to recognize \"\n        \"and engulf the amyloid deposits.\"\n    )\n\n    # 2. Print the answer in a structured format.\n    print(f\"The protein in question is: {protein_name}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Explanation of the mechanism:\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # 3. Fulfilling the instruction to output the number from the 'equation'.\n    # In this biological context, the 'equation' is the protein's name itself.\n    print(f\"The key number in the protein's name is: {protein_component_number}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement C3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
