    print("\nHere is a breakdown of the key structural differences:\n")

    print("1. Monomers (The Building Blocks):")
    print("   - Polysaccharides are polymers made of monosaccharide (simple sugar) monomers, like glucose.")
    print("   - Polynucleotides are polymers made of nucleotide monomers. Each nucleotide is a far more complex unit composed of three distinct parts:")
    print("     a) A phosphate group")
    print("     b) A five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose)")
    print("     c) A nitrogenous base\n")

    print("2. Backbone and Linkages:")
    print("   - In polysaccharides, the sugar monomers are linked together by glycosidic bonds.")
    print("   - In polynucleotides, the nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds, which create a distinct sugar-phosphate backbone. This backbone is fundamentally different from the all-sugar backbone of a polysaccharide.\n")

    print("3. Elemental Composition:")
    print("   - Polysaccharides are primarily composed of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Oxygen (CHO).")
    print("   - Polynucleotides always contain Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen (in the bases), and Phosphorus (in the phosphate groups) (CHONP).\n")

    print("In summary, due to fundamental differences in their monomer units, the chemical bonds linking them, and their overall elemental composition, polynucleotides and polysaccharides are structurally distinct categories of molecules.")
