    "My plan is to first deduce the transformation rule that converts the input grids to the output grids. I will analyze the relationship between a cell's value in the output grid and the values of its neighboring cells in the input grid. After identifying a consistent rule across all five examples, I will apply this rule to the sixth test input grid to generate its corresponding output grid.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** I will examine the relationship between each cell `O[r][c]` in the output grid and the 3x3 neighborhood around the corresponding cell `I[r][c]` in the input grid. I'll hypothesize that the output value depends on the original cell's value (`I[r][c]`) and the number of its \"live\" (value 1) neighbors.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Rule:** By creating a mapping `(I[r][c], neighbor_sum) -> O[r][c]` for several cells across the examples, I will deduce a general rule. The rule appears to be a variation of Conway's Game of Life. Let `N` be the number of live neighbors in the 8-cell Moore neighborhood (assuming cells outside the grid are 0).\n    - For a cell at `(r, c)`, I will calculate `N`, the sum of its 8 neighbors in the input grid.\n    - The rule I've found is: The output cell `O[r][c]` is 1 if `N` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, the output cell is 0. This rule is independent of the original value of the cell `I[r][c]`.\n\n3.  **Verify the Rule:** I will mentally check this rule against all five provided examples to ensure its correctness and consistency.\n\n4.  **Apply to Test Grid:** Once the rule is confirmed, I will apply it to the sixth test input grid. I will iterate through each cell of the test grid, count its live neighbors, and determine the output value based on the rule.\n\n5.  **Generate Final Output:** I will construct the final 5x5 output grid. The Python code will print this grid. Finally, I will format the grid into a 25-character binary string as requested for the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the grid transformation puzzle by applying a specific cellular automaton rule.\n    The rule is: a cell in the output grid is 1 if its corresponding cell in the input grid\n    has exactly 2 or 3 live neighbors (value 1) in its 8-cell Moore neighborhood.
