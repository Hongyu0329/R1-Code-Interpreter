# Step 1: Define the chemical principles for the analysis.
# The problem involves a ligand substitution reaction and the subsequent analysis of the product's isomers.

# Step 2: Analyze the expected product and its general formula.
# Reactants: cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2] and dptztz (2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole)
# The most likely reaction is the substitution of the two Cl- ligands by the bidentate dptztz ligand.
# Product complex: [Ru(bpy)2(dptztz)]^2+
# This complex is of the type [M(AA)2(BB)], where:
# M = Ru (metal center)
# AA = bpy (a symmetric bidentate ligand)
# BB = dptztz (another symmetric bidentate ligand)

# Step 3: Determine the number of geometric isomers.
# For an octahedral complex of the type [M(AA)2(BB)] with symmetric ligands,
# there is only one possible spatial arrangement of the ligands.
num_geometric_isomers = 1
print(f"Analysis of the product complex [Ru(bpy)2(dptztz)]^2+:")
print(f"Number of geometric isomers = {num_geometric_isomers}")

# Step 4: Determine the number of optical isomers (enantiomers) for the geometric isomer.
# A complex with three bidentate ligands, like [Ru(bpy)2(dptztz)]^2+, is inherently chiral.
# A chiral molecule exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).
# These are often labeled as the Delta (Δ) and Lambda (Λ) isomers.
num_optical_isomers_per_geometric = 2
print(f"The geometric isomer is chiral, so it has a non-superimposable mirror image.")
print(f"Number of optical isomers (enantiomers) for this geometric isomer = {num_optical_isomers_per_geometric}")

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of isomers.
# Total isomers = (Number of geometric isomers) * (Number of optical isomers per geometric isomer)
total_isomers = num_geometric_isomers * num_optical_isomers_per_geometric

print("\nFinal Calculation:")
print(f"Total isomers = {num_geometric_isomers} (geometric) * {num_optical_isomers_per_geometric} (optical) = {total_isomers}")
print(f"\nTherefore, a total of {total_isomers} isomers are formed.")
