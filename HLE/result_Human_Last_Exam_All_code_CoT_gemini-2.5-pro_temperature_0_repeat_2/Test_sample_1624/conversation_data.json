    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the properties of the subset U**: The given conditions imply that $U$ is a 1-dimensional manifold. Since it's a subspace of a metric space, it is itself a metric space. A metric manifold is second-countable, which means it has a countable basis for its topology.\n2.  **Show that X is separable**: A space is separable if it has a countable dense subset. A second-countable space is always separable. Therefore, $U$ has a countable dense subset, let's call it $D$. We will then show that since $D$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, $D$ must also be dense in $X$. This proves that $X$ is a separable metric space.\n3.  **Determine the cardinality bound for a separable metric space**: There is a standard result in topology that the cardinality of any separable metric space is at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$. We will briefly outline the proof for this.\n4.  **Conclusion**: Conclude that an upper bound for the cardinality of $X$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$. We can also note that this bound is sharp (i.e., achievable) by considering an example like the topologist's sine curve.\n\nThis entire reasoning can be presented in a Python script that prints the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the properties of a metric space X to find an upper bound on its cardinality.\n\n    The space X has the following properties:\n    1. X is a connected metric space.\n    2. U is an open dense subset of X.\n    3. Each point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the real line R.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the upper bound on the cardinality of X:\n\n    Step 1: Analyze the subset U\n    The condition that each point in the open set U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R means that U is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. Since U is a subspace of the metric space X, U is also a metric space. A key theorem in topology states that any manifold that is also a metric space must be second-countable (i.e., it has a countable basis for its topology).\n\n    Step 2: Show that X is a separable space\n    A topological space is called 'separable' if it contains a countable dense subset. Any second-countable space is separable. Therefore, U contains a countable dense subset, which we can call D.\n\n    Now, we show that D is also dense in X.\n    - We are given that U is dense in X. This means for any point x in X and any open neighborhood N of x, the intersection N with U is non-empty.\n    - We know D is dense in U. This means for any non-empty open set within U (like N intersect U), its intersection with D is also non-empty.\n    - Combining these, (N intersect U) intersect D is non-empty, which implies N intersect D is non-empty.\n    - Since this holds for any point x in X and any of its neighborhoods N, D is a countable dense subset of X.\n    - Therefore, X is a separable metric space.\n\n    Step 3: Find the cardinality bound for a separable metric space\n    There is a standard theorem that the cardinality of any separable metric space is at most the cardinality of the continuum, c (which is 2 to the power of aleph-null).\n\n    Proof sketch:\n    - Let D be a countable dense subset of X.\n    - Consider the collection of all open balls B(d, q) where 'd' is a point in D and 'q' is a positive rational number. This collection of balls forms a countable basis for the topology of X. Let's call this basis B.\n    - We can define an injective (one-to-one) map from X to the power set of B, P(B). For each point x in X, we map it to the subset of all basis elements in B that contain x.\n    - This map is injective because for any two distinct points x and y, we can find a small enough ball from B that contains x but not y.\n    - Since there is an injection from X to P(B), the cardinality of X is less than or equal to the cardinality of P(B).\n    - The cardinality of P(B) is 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of B. Since B is countable, its cardinality is aleph-null.\n    - Thus, the cardinality of X is at most 2^(aleph-null) = c.\n\n    Step 4: Conclusion\n    The cardinality of X is bounded above. The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum. This bound is achievable, as demonstrated by spaces like the closure of the topologist's sine curve, which satisfies all the conditions and has a cardinality of c.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(explanation)\n\n    final_answer = \"The upper bound on the cardinality of X is the cardinality of the continuum (c).\"\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(final_answer)\n\nsolve_cardinality_problem()\n```\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum ($\\mathfrak{c}$)>>>"
