    This function explains the steps to calculate the thickness of the double point.
    The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.
    The valuation v is the 2-adic valuation, v(2)=1.

    Step 1: Rewrite the equation.
    z^2 - 1 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3
    (z - 1) * (z + 1) = 2 * x^3 * (x^2 + 1)

    Step 2: Let y = z - 1. Then z + 1 = y + 2.
    The equation becomes:
    y * (y + 2) = 2 * x^3 * (x^2 + 1)

    Step 3: The thickness of the node in the stable reduction is the minimal
    positive 2-adic valuation of the right-hand side (RHS) for x in the ring
    of 2-adic integers Z_2.
    Let F(x) = 2 * x^3 * (x^2 + 1).
    The valuation is v(F(x)) = v(2) + 3*v(x) + v(x^2 + 1).
    Since v(2) = 1, this is:
    v(F(x)) = 1 + 3*v(x) + v(x^2 + 1).

    We analyze this valuation for different v(x):
    Case 1: v(x) > 0. Let v(x) = a, where a is a positive integer.
    Then v(x^2) = 2a > 0, so v(x^2 + 1) = v(1) = 0.
    v(F(x)) = 1 + 3*a + 0 = 1 + 3a. The minimum for a>=1 is 1 + 3*1 = 4.

    Case 2: v(x) = 0. This means x is a 2-adic unit (an odd integer).
    If x is odd, x^2 is of the form 4k+1. So x^2 = 1 (mod 4).
    Then x^2 + 1 = 2 (mod 4).
    This means v(x^2 + 1) = 1.
    v(F(x)) = 1 + 3*0 + 1 = 2.

    Case 3: v(x) < 0. This case corresponds to x not being in Z_2 and is not
    relevant for finding the thickness of the node in the reduction over Z_2.

    Comparing the positive valuations, the minimum is 2.
    This value corresponds to the thickness of the double point.
