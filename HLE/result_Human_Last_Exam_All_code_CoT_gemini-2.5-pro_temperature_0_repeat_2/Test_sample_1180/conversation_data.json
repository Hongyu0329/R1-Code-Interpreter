    "To solve this problem, we need to find the stable reduction of the hyperelliptic curve $C$ defined by the equation $z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$ over the 2-adic numbers $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The valuation $v$ is the standard 2-adic valuation, normalized so that $v(2)=1$. The \"thickness\" of a double point in the stable reduction corresponds to an integer $n$ in a local model of the form $uv = \\pi^n$, where $\\pi$ is a uniformizer of the valuation ring.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the curve equation**\n\nLet's rewrite the equation to better understand its structure.\n$z^2 - 1 = 2x^5 + 2x^3$\n$(z-1)(z+1) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\nThis equation involves the product of two terms, $z-1$ and $z+1$, whose difference is $(z+1)-(z-1)=2$. This suggests a change of variables might be helpful.\n\nLet $y = z-1$. Then $z+1 = y+2$. The equation becomes:\n$y(y+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the valuations**\n\nWe are looking for a double point (a node) in the stable reduction. Nodes are formed where two components of the reduction meet. In our model, the components are suggested by the two factors $y$ and $y+2$. These two \"components\" meet where the right-hand side (RHS) is \"small\" in 2-adic terms, i.e., where its valuation is high.\n\nLet's analyze the valuation of the RHS, $F(x) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$.\n$v(F(x)) = v(2x^3(x^2+1)) = v(2) + 3v(x) + v(x^2+1)$\n$v(F(x)) = 1 + 3v(x) + v(x^2+1)$\n\nWe need to understand the term $v(x^2+1)$:\n*   If $v(x) > 0$, then $v(x^2) > 0$, so $v(x^2+1) = v(1) = 0$.\n*   If $v(x) = 0$ (i.e., $x$ is a 2-adic unit), then $x$ is odd. Let $x=2k+1$. $x^2 = 4k^2+4k+1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. So $x^2+1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 4$. This means $v(x^2+1) = 1$.\n*   If $v(x) < 0$, then $v(x^2) < 0$, so $v(x^2+1) = v(x^2) = 2v(x)$.\n\nNow let's find the valuation of $F(x)$ in these cases:\n*   If $v(x) > 0$, say $v(x)=a>0$: $v(F(x)) = 1 + 3a + 0 = 1+3a$. The minimum positive value is $4$ (for $a=1$).\n*   If $v(x) = 0$: $v(F(x)) = 1 + 3(0) + 1 = 2$.\n*   If $v(x) < 0$, say $v(x)=-a<0$: $v(F(x)) = 1 + 3(-a) + 2(-a) = 1-5a$. This is not positive for $a \\ge 1$.\n\nThe minimal positive valuation of the RHS occurs when $v(x)=0$, and this minimal valuation is 2. This \"thinnest\" part of the connection between the two components $y=0$ and $y=-2$ will determine the thickness of the node.\n\n**Step 3: Find a local model for the node**\n\nLet's analyze the equation at a point where this minimal valuation is achieved, for example, by taking a 2-adic unit like $x=1$.\nThe equation becomes $y(y+2) = 2(1)^3(1^2+1) = 2(2) = 4$.\nSo we have $y^2 + 2y - 4 = 0$.\n\nTo find the thickness, we want to transform this into a local equation of the form $uv = \\pi^n$.\nLet's make the substitution $y=2Y$.\n$(2Y)(2Y+2) = 4$\n$4Y(Y+1) = 4$\n$Y(Y+1) = 1$\n\nThis equation $Y^2+Y-1=0$ defines the coordinates of the nodes over the residue field. The reduction modulo 2 is $Y^2+Y+1=0$, which has two distinct roots in the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_4$, but not in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This confirms that the node is defined over an unramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\nThe original equation is $y(y+2) = F(x)$. We found that the minimum valuation of $F(x)$ for $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2$ is 2. Let's write $F(x) = 2^2 \\cdot u$, where $u = \\frac{x^3(x^2+1)}{2}$ is a 2-adic unit for any unit $x$.\nSo we have the local equation $y(y+2) = 4u$.\nLet $U=y$ and $V=y+2$. Then $V-U=2$ and $UV=4u$.\nThis is not yet in the form $U'V' = 2^n$. Let's try another substitution.\nLet $y=2Y$. The equation becomes $2Y(2Y+2) = 4u$, which simplifies to $Y(Y+1)=u$.\nThis equation describes a smooth curve over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ whose special fiber $Y(Y+1)=\\bar{u}$ is smooth over $\\mathbb{F}_4$ (since $\\bar{u} \\neq 0$). This is not a model of a node.\n\nLet's reconsider the equation $y(y+2) = F(x)$. The stable model is not just about one point $x=1$, but about a family over $x$. The node in the stable reduction is formed over the whole region where $v(x)=0$.\nLet's define new variables $U = y$ and $V = y+2$.\nThe equation of the curve is $UV = 2x^3(x^2+1)$.\nThe stable reduction has a node whose thickness is given by the minimal valuation of the RHS for $x$ in the valuation ring $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\nAs calculated before, $\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}_2} v(2x^3(x^2+1)) = 2$.\nThis minimum value corresponds to the thickness of the double point.\n\nThe thickness of the double point is the exponent $n$ in the local model $uv=2^n$. This value is the minimum possible valuation of the right-hand side of the equation $y(y+2) = 2x^3(x^2+1)$ for $x$ in the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. We found this minimum valuation to be 2.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_thickness():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to calculate the thickness of the double point.\n    The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    The valuation v is the 2-adic valuation, v(2)=1.\n\n    Step 1: Rewrite the equation.\n    z^2 - 1 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3\n    (z - 1) * (z + 1) = 2 * x^3 * (x^2 + 1)\n\n    Step 2: Let y = z - 1. Then z + 1 = y + 2.\n    The equation becomes:\n    y * (y + 2) = 2 * x^3 * (x^2 + 1)\n\n    Step 3: The thickness of the node in the stable reduction is the minimal\n    positive 2-adic valuation of the right-hand side (RHS) for x in the ring\n    of 2-adic integers Z_2.\n    Let F(x) = 2 * x^3 * (x^2 + 1).\n    The valuation is v(F(x)) = v(2) + 3*v(x) + v(x^2 + 1).\n    Since v(2) = 1, this is:\n    v(F(x)) = 1 + 3*v(x) + v(x^2 + 1).\n\n    We analyze this valuation for different v(x):\n    Case 1: v(x) > 0. Let v(x) = a, where a is a positive integer.\n    Then v(x^2) = 2a > 0, so v(x^2 + 1) = v(1) = 0.\n    v(F(x)) = 1 + 3*a + 0 = 1 + 3a. The minimum for a>=1 is 1 + 3*1 = 4.\n\n    Case 2: v(x) = 0. This means x is a 2-adic unit (an odd integer).\n    If x is odd, x^2 is of the form 4k+1. So x^2 = 1 (mod 4).\n    Then x^2 + 1 = 2 (mod 4).\n    This means v(x^2 + 1) = 1.\n    v(F(x)) = 1 + 3*0 + 1 = 2.\n\n    Case 3: v(x) < 0. This case corresponds to x not being in Z_2 and is not\n    relevant for finding the thickness of the node in the reduction over Z_2.\n\n    Comparing the positive valuations, the minimum is 2.\n    This value corresponds to the thickness of the double point.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    v_2 = 1\n    # We want to find min(1 + 3*v(x) + v(x^2+1)) for x in Z_2.\n    \n    # Case v(x) > 0 (e.g., v(x)=1)\n    v_x_gt_0 = 1\n    v_x_squared_plus_1_case1 = 0\n    val_case1 = v_2 + 3 * v_x_gt_0 + v_x_squared_plus_1_case1\n    \n    # Case v(x) = 0\n    v_x_eq_0 = 0\n    v_x_squared_plus_1_case2 = 1\n    val_case2 = v_2 + 3 * v_x_eq_0 + v_x_squared_plus_1_case2\n    \n    thickness = min(val_case1, val_case2)\n    \n    print(\"The equation of the curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\")\n    print(\"This can be rewritten as (z-1)*(z+1) = 2*x^3*(x^2+1).\")\n    print(\"The thickness of the double point is the minimal 2-adic valuation of the right-hand side for x in the 2-adic integers.\")\n    print(\"The valuation is v(2*x^3*(x^2+1)) = v(2) + 3*v(x) + v(x^2+1).\")\n    print(f\"We know v(2) = {v_2}.\")\n    print(\"If v(x) > 0 (e.g., v(x)=1), the valuation is 1 + 3*1 + 0 = 4.\")\n    print(f\"If v(x) = 0, x is a unit.
