# Given constants
A = 10**10
B = 1/100000 - 1
T = 10**20
alpha1 = 0

# The differential equation for X0(t) is X0'(t) = -(B+1)X0(t) + A
# The boundary condition is X0(0) - X0(T) = alpha1 = 0, so X0(0) = X0(T)
# The general solution is X0(t) = A/(B+1) + C1 * exp(-(B+1)*t)
# Applying the boundary condition:
# A/(B+1) + C1 = A/(B+1) + C1 * exp(-(B+1)*T)
# C1 = C1 * exp(-(B+1)*T)
# C1 * (1 - exp(-(B+1)*T)) = 0
# Since T > 0 and B+1 > 0, (1 - exp(-(B+1)*T)) is not zero.
# Therefore, C1 must be 0.
# This leaves the solution X0(t) = A / (B+1).

# Calculate B+1
B_plus_1 = B + 1

# Calculate the value of X0(t), which is constant
X0_t = A / B_plus_1

# The question asks for the value of X0 at T = 10^20.
# Since the solution is a constant, this is just X0_t.
X0_T = X0_t
