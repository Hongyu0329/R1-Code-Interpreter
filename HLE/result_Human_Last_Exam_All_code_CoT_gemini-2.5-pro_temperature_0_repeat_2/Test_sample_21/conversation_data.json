    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$, and then apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Galois Group:** The given polynomial is a known example in algebraic number theory. Its Galois group, $G$, over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the projective special linear group $\\text{PSL}(2,7)$, which is one of the finite simple groups. This is a non-trivial result from the mathematical literature.\n2.  **Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem:** This theorem states that the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which a polynomial $f(x)$ has a certain factorization pattern modulo $p$ is equal to the proportion of elements in its Galois group $G$ that have the corresponding cycle structure when acting on the roots of $f(x)$.\n3.  **Find the relevant proportion:** For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element corresponding to $p$ must act as a single cycle on the 7 roots of the polynomial. This means we need to find the proportion of elements in $G = \\text{PSL}(2,7)$ that are 7-cycles.\n4.  **Calculate the group order:** The order of the group $\\text{PSL}(2,q)$ is given by the formula $|G| = (q^2-1)q / \\gcd(2, q-1)$. For $q=7$, we can calculate the order of our group.\n5.  **Count the 7-cycles:** We will use Sylow's theorems to count the number of elements of order 7 (which are the 7-cycles) in $\\text{PSL}(2,7)$.\n6.  **Compute the density:** The density is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the total order of the group.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the density.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the natural density of primes p for which the polynomial\n    f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22 remains irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: The Galois group is G = PSL(2,7) and we need the proportion of 7-cycles.\n    # This is a known result from algebraic number theory.\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the order of G = PSL(2,7).\n    q = 7\n    # The formula for the order of PSL(2,q) is (q^2 - 1) * q / gcd(2, q-1)\n    group_order = (q**2 - 1) * q / math.gcd(2, q - 1)\n    group_order = int(group_order)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the number of 7-cycles in G.
