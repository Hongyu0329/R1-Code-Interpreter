    print("2. Input Construction:")
    print(f"   - We construct a set of 2^({N_sym}*{q_sym}) distinct input matrices, parameterized by a tuple of {N_sym} binary strings (\u03C3\u2081, ..., \u03C3\u2099), where each \u03C3\u2097 \u2208 {{0,1}}^{q_sym}.")
    print(f"   - For each input matrix, the i-th row's indexing component, y\u2097, is determined by \u03C3\u2097. The z\u2097 vectors are fixed across all these inputs in a way that allows us to create distinguishable outputs (e.g., z\u209A = e\u209A and z\u209A\u208A\u209A = -e\u209A for j=1..{q_sym}, where e\u209A are standard basis vectors). This is possible under the given constraints {q_sym} < {d_prime_sym} and {q_sym} \u2264 {N_sym}/2.\n")

    print(f"   - The network f must approximate qSA with error \u03B5 = 1/(2*{q_sym}). By the triangle inequality, the network's outputs f(X)\u2096 and f(X')\u2096 must be separated by at least:")
    print(f"     ||f(X)\u2096 - f(X')\u2096|| \u2265 ||qSA(X)\u2096 - qSA(X')\u2096|| - 2\u03B5 \u2265 2/{q_sym} - 2 * (1/(2*{q_sym})) = 1/{q_sym}.")
    print(f"   - Since this distance is positive, the network must produce distinct outputs, f(X) \u2260 f(X'), for any two distinct inputs X and X' from our set.\n")

    print("4. Dimensionality Argument:")
    print(f"   - The network function is f(x) = g(Wx), where x is the flattened input. If f(X) \u2260 f(X'), it must be that Wx \u2260 Wx'.")
    print(f"   - This means the linear transformation W must map every distinct input x from our set to a distinct hidden representation Wx.")

    print(f"   - The set of difference vectors {{x - x' | for all x, x' in our set}} spans a vector space V of dimension {N_sym}*{q_sym}.")
    print(f"   - For Wx \u2260 Wx' to hold for all pairs, the null space of W cannot contain any non-zero vector from V. This means W must be injective when restricted to V.")
    print(f"   - By the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the image of V under W must be equal to the dimension of V. That is, dim(W(V)) = dim(V) = {N_sym}*{q_sym}.")
    print(f"   - Since W(V) is a subspace of the hidden space \u211D\u207F, its dimension cannot be larger than {m_sym}.\n")

    print("5. Conclusion:")
    print(f"   - We must have {m_sym} \u2265 dim(W(V)).")
    print(f"   - Therefore, the lower bound for {m_sym} is {N_sym}*{q_sym}.")
