    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we first need to establish the frequency of sound produced by muscle contractions. Then, we will compare this frequency with the known hearing ranges of the animals listed.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Target Frequency:** Research the frequency range of sounds produced by human muscle contractions (a field known as mechanomyography). This sound is typically very low, in the 5-25 Hz range.\n2.  **Gather Hearing Range Data:** Collect the approximate hearing ranges for each animal in the answer choices (Dog, Bat, Herring, Whale, Human).\n3.  **Compare and Analyze:** Write a Python script to compare the muscle twitch frequency with each animal's hearing range. The script will store the data, iterate through each animal, print the comparison, and identify the animal whose hearing range best covers the low-frequency muscle sounds.\n4.  **Determine the Answer:** The animal with a hearing range that extends low enough to overlap with the 5-25 Hz range is the most likely candidate.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines which animal can hear human muscle twitches by comparing\n    frequency ranges.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of a human muscle twitch.\n    # The sound from muscle contraction (mechanomyography) is very low frequency.\n    muscle_twitch_freq_low = 5  # Hz\n    muscle_twitch_freq_high = 25 # Hz\n\n    # Step 2: Define the approximate hearing ranges for the animals.\n    # Data is stored as a dictionary: {Animal: (lower_bound_Hz, upper_bound_Hz)}\n    hearing_ranges = {\n        \"A.
