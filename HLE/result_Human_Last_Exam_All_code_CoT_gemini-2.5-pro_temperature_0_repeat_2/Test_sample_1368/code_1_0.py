def solve():

    This function determines the shortest sequence of commands to construct a square inscribed in a circle.

    The steps are:
    1. L: Draw a line through the center and the given point on the circumference to define the first diameter.
    2. C: Draw a circle from one end of the diameter, using the full diameter as the radius.
    3. C: Draw a second circle from the other end of the diameter, using the full diameter as the radius.
    4. L: Draw a line between the two intersection points of the circles from steps 2 and 3. This line is the perpendicular bisector and defines the second diameter, thus locating the final two vertices of the square.
