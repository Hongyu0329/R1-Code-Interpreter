# Step 1: Define the values of the constants as derived from the analysis.
# K1, K2, K3, K4 are derived by comparing the calculated denominator of A_m
# with the given formula.
K1 = 4
K2 = 2
K3 = -1
K4 = 2

# Step 2: Determine the value of K.
# The product K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4 should be a single numerical value.
# This suggests that K, which likely corresponds to the parameter k in the
# boundary condition, must have a specific value. A standard assumption in
# such problems is K=1.
K = 1

# Step 3: Calculate the final product.
product = K * K1 * K2 * K3 * K4

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
