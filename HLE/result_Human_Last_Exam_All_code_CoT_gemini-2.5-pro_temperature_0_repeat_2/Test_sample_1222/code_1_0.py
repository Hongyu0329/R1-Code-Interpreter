    print("Explanation:")
    print("The problem statement defines the action of g on the vertices Q_0 as g . e_i = e_{n-d-i}.")
    print("This type of action, which maps an index i to (constant - i), is a reflection by definition.")
    print("The property of g being a reflection is a premise of the problem, not a conclusion to be derived.")

    print("Part (b): Provide a condition on d for which sigma(a) != 0 must hold for all a in Q_1.\n")
    print("Explanation of the Derivation:")
    print("1. We start with the defining property of the map sigma: sigma(g . a) = lambda^{-1} * g . sigma(a).")
    print("2. Let's consider the case where an arrow 'a' is a fixed point of the action g, meaning g . a = a.")
    print("3. For an arrow a: i -> j, its transformation g . a is an arrow from (n-d-i) to (n-d-j).")
    print("4. For g . a = a, we need the start and end points to be identical. This means n-d-i = i and n-d-j = j.")
    print("5. This can only happen if i = j (so 'a' is a loop) and the vertex 'i' satisfies the equation 2*i = n - d.")
    print("6. For this equation to have an integer solution for the vertex index 'i', the term (n - d) must be an even number.")
    print("\n7. If a fixed arrow 'a' exists (which is possible if n-d is even), the condition on sigma becomes:")
    print("   sigma(a) = sigma(g . a) = lambda^{-1} * g . sigma(a).")
    print("8. Since g fixes the vertex 'i' where the loop 'a' resides, g acts as the identity on paths at 'i'. Thus, g . sigma(a) = sigma(a).")
    print("9. The equation simplifies to: sigma(a) = lambda^{-1} * sigma(a), which can be written as (1 - lambda^{-1}) * sigma(a) = 0.")
    print("10. In the non-trivial case for Taft algebras, lambda is not equal to 1, so (1 - lambda^{-1}) is not zero.")
    print("11. This forces sigma(a) = 0 for any such fixed arrow 'a'.")
    print("\n12. This result contradicts the requirement that sigma(a) != 0 for ALL arrows.")
    print("13. To guarantee that sigma(a) can be non-zero for all arrows, we must impose a condition on 'd' that prevents this scenario.")
    print("14. The scenario is only possible if g can have a fixed vertex. We must therefore choose 'd' such that g has no fixed vertices.")
    print("15. The condition for a fixed vertex is that n - d is even. To prevent it, n - d must be odd.")
