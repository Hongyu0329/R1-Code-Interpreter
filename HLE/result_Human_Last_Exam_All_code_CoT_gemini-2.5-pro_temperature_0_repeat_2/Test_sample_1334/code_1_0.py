    This function solves the three theoretical questions about dessins d'enfants and group theory.
    The reasoning for each answer is provided in the comments.

    # Part (a): True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act
    # semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    #
    # A covering of dessins D -> D_N induced by a normal subgroup N is defined as 'smooth'
    # if the valencies of vertices and the lengths of face boundaries are the same for both D and D_N.
    # A fundamental theorem in the theory of dessins states that this condition is equivalent to the
    # normal subgroup N acting semi-regularly (i.e., with trivial point stabilizers) on the sets
    # of vertices, edges, and faces of D. The condition that the covering is 'minimal' (i.e., N is a
    # minimal normal subgroup) does not alter this requirement for smoothness.
    # Therefore, the statement is True.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth
    # covering of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    #
    # The question provides the definition of a quasi-simple group, which includes two conditions:
    # 1. G/Z(G) is a non-abelian simple group.
    # 2. G is a perfect group, meaning it equals its commutator subgroup (G = G').
    # The question asks if it is necessary for G to be a perfect group, given that it is quasi-simple.
    # According to the provided definition, being a perfect group is a required part of being
    # quasi-simple. The other information about the dessin is extraneous to this definitional question.
    # Therefore, the statement is True.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin
    # that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    #
    # 1. Let D be the covering dessin (monodromy G) and D_N be the base dessin (monodromy G/N).
    # 2. D_N is unicellular, meaning the face permutation f_N = (bw)N is a single long cycle on the darts of D_N.
    # 3. The covering is smooth, so the cycle structure of f = bw on the darts of D must match that of f_N.
    #    This implies that f is a product of |N| disjoint cycles of the same length.
    # 4. The faces of D are the orbits of the group generated by f. Thus, D has exactly |N| faces.
    # 5. G is 'face-quasiprimitive', meaning it acts quasiprimitively on the set of faces. By definition
    #    of a quasiprimitive action, every non-trivial normal subgroup of G must be transitive on the set of faces.
    # 6. Since N is a minimal normal subgroup, it must be transitive on the set of faces.
    # 7. A group N acting transitively on a set of size |N| must act regularly (i.e., point stabilizers are trivial).
    # 8. The O'Nan-Scott theorem for quasiprimitive groups classifies them into several types. The types (SD), (CD),
    #    and (PA) are characterized by having no regular normal subgroups. Since we have shown that N is a regular
    #    minimal normal subgroup, these three types are ruled out.
    # 9. The remaining types from the provided list are (HA), (AS), (TW), (HS), and (HC). These types all
    #    admit a regular minimal normal subgroup and are therefore all possible.
    answer_c = "HA, AS, TW, HS, HC"

    # Print the final answer in the specified format.
