    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, I will determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. I will use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial is a key component. Its value, and whether it is a perfect square, helps classify the Galois group. For a polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: I will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial, which for $x^4 + cx + d$ is $g(x) = x^3 - 4dx - c^2$. I will then check if this cubic polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by searching for rational roots.\n4.  **Classify the Galois Group**: Based on the irreducibility of $f(x)$, whether $\\Delta$ is a perfect square, and the reducibility of the resolvent cubic, I can narrow down the possible Galois groups. The combination of an irreducible quartic, a non-square discriminant, and a reducible resolvent cubic means the group is either the cyclic group $C_4$ or the dihedral group $D_4$.\n5.  **Distinguish Between $C_4$ and $D_4$**: A standard criterion to distinguish between these two groups is to check if the discriminant $\\Delta$ can be expressed as a sum of two squares. If it is, the group is $C_4$ (order 4); otherwise, it is $D_4$ (order 8).\n6.  **Determine the Order**: Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that implements this plan to calculate the order of the Galois group.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the prime factorization of a positive integer n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef is_sum_of_two_squares(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a positive integer n is a sum of two squares using Fermat's theorem.\n    This is true if and only if no prime p = 3 (mod 4) appears to an odd power\n    in the prime factorization of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p, exponent in factors.items():\n        if p % 4 == 3 and exponent % 2 != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_rational_roots(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds integer roots of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.\n    By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be an integer\n    divisor of the constant term.\n    \"\"\"\n    const_term = coeffs[-1]\n    if const_term == 0:\n        return [0]\n    \n    roots = []\n    # Generate divisors of the constant term\n    divs = []\n    for i in range(1, int(abs(const_term)**0.5) + 1):\n        if const_term % i == 0:\n            divs.append(i)\n            divs.append(-i)\n            if i*i != abs(const_term):\n                divs.append(const_term // i)\n                divs.append(-(const_term // i))\n    \n    divs = sorted(list(set(divs)))\n\n    # Test each divisor\n    for d in divs:\n        val = 0\n        # Evaluate polynomial using Horner's method\n        for coeff in coeffs:\n            val = val * d + coeff\n        if val == 0:\n            roots.append(d)\n    return roots\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + cx + d\n    c, d = 8, 14\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\")\n    print(\"By Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the quartic.\")\n    # For x^4 + cx + d, the discriminant is -27*c^4 + 256*d^3\n    delta = -27 * c**4 + 256 * d**3\n    print(f\"The discriminant is Delta = -27 * {c}^4 + 256 * {d}^3 = {delta}\")\n\n    delta_sqrt_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    is_delta_square = (delta_sqrt_int * delta_sqrt_int == delta)\n    print(f\"Is Delta a perfect square in Q?
