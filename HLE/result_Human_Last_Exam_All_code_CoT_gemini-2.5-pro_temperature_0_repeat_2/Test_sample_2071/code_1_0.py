def find_dance_scene_word():
    """
    This function identifies the word in the song "You Never Can Tell"
    at which Mia Wallace performs her exaggerated right leg move for the second time.

    Analysis of the scene reveals the following:
    - The dance move in question is an exaggerated swing of her right leg.
    - This move is performed at the end of the song's chorus, on the last word.
    - The chorus line is: "'C'est la vie,' say the old folks, it goes to show you never can tell."
    - The first time she does this move is on the word "tell" at the end of the first chorus.
    - She repeats this exact same move for the second time at the end of the second chorus.
    - Therefore, the word is the same for both instances.
