    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of orbits of the set of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ under the action of the group $GL_2(R)$ of invertible linear transformations.\n\nA quadratic form is a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\nTwo forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if there is an invertible matrix $T = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ (with $p,q,r,s \\in R$ and determinant $ps-qr$ being a unit in $R$, i.e., odd) such that $Q_2(x, y) = Q_1(px+qy, rx+sy)$.\n\nWe can classify the forms into three distinct types that are preserved under this group action:\n1.  **Type I, b odd**: Forms where the coefficient $b$ is odd.\n2.  **Type I, b even**: Forms where not all coefficients $a,b,c$ are even, but $b$ is even.\n3.  **Type II**: Forms where all coefficients $a, b, c$ are even.\n\nThe total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the number of classes within each type. Instead of performing the classification by hand, which is quite complex, we can write a program to compute this. The program will:\n1.  Generate all 512 possible quadratic forms $(a, b, c)$.\n2.  Partition these forms into the three types mentioned above.\n3.  Generate the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n4.  For each type, count the number of equivalence classes (orbits) by picking a form, computing its entire orbit, removing those forms from the set, and repeating until no forms are left.\n5.  Finally, sum the counts from the three types to get the total number of classes.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_gl2_z8():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the group GL_2(Z/8Z) of invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z.\n    A matrix is invertible if its determinant is a unit in Z/8Z (i.e., odd).\n    \"\"\"\n    G = []\n    for p in range(8):\n        for q in range(8):\n            for r in range(8):\n                for s in range(8):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % 8\n                    if det in [1, 3, 5, 7]:\n                        G.append(np.array([[p, q], [r, s]], dtype=int))\n    return G\n\ndef apply_transform(T, Q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies a linear transform T to a quadratic form Q.\n    If Q is ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 and the transform is (x,y) -> (px+qy, rx+sy),\n    the new form Q' = a'x^2 + b'xy + c'y^2 has coefficients:\n    a' = ap^2 + bpr + cr^2\n    b' = 2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs\n    c' = aq^2 + bqs + cs^2\n    \"\"\"\n    a, b, c = Q\n    p, q = T[0, 0], T[0, 1]\n    r, s = T[1, 0], T[1, 1]\n    \n    a_new = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % 8\n    b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % 8\n    c_new = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % 8\n    \n    return (a_new, b_new, c_new)\n\ndef count_classes_in_set(form_set, G):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of equivalence classes (orbits) in a given set of forms.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_classes = 0\n    forms_to_process = form_set.copy()\n    \n    while forms_to_process:\n        num_classes += 1\n        # Pick a representative form from the set\n        q_rep = forms_to_process.pop()\n        \n        # Compute its orbit\n        orbit = set()\n        queue = [q_rep]\n        visited = {q_rep}\n        \n        head = 0\n        while head < len(queue):\n            current_q = queue[head]\n            head += 1\n            orbit.add(current_q)\n            \n            for T in G:\n                new_q = apply_transform(T, current_q)\n                if new_q not in visited:\n                    visited.add(new_q)\n                    queue.append(new_q)\n        \n        # Remove the entire orbit from the set of forms to process\n        forms_to_process -= orbit\n        \n    return num_classes\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to classify quadratic forms and print the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Partition all 512 forms into three disjoint sets based on their type.\n    forms_type_I_b_odd = set()\n    forms_type_I_b_even = set()\n    forms_type_II = set()\n\n    for a in range(8):\n        for b in range(8):\n            for c in range(8):\n                q = (a, b, c)\n                # Type II: a, b, c are all even\n                if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and c % 2 == 0:\n                    forms_type_II.add(q)\n                # Type I, b odd\n                elif b % 2 != 0:\n                    forms_type_I_b_odd.add(q)\n                # Type I, b even (and not all a,b,c are even)\n                else:\n                    forms_type_I_b_even.add(q)\n\n    # Generate the transformation group\n    G = get_gl2_z8()\n\n    # Count classes in each partition\n    count_I_b_even = count_classes_in_set(forms_type_I_b_even, G)\n    count_I_b_odd = count_classes_in_set(forms_type_I_b_odd, G)\n    count_II = count_classes_in_set(forms_type_II, G)\n    \n    total = count_I_b_even + count_I_b_odd + count_II\n    \n    print(\"The number of equivalence classes can be found by classifying the forms into types.\")\n    print(f\"Number of classes of Type I (b even): {count_I_b_even}\")\n    print(f\"Number of classes of Type I (b odd): {count_I_b_odd}\")\n    print(f\"Number of classes of Type II (a,b,c all even): {count_II}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of equivalence classes is the sum of these counts:\")\n    print(f\"{count_I_b_even} + {count_I_b_odd} + {count_II} = {total}\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<42>>>\n```"
