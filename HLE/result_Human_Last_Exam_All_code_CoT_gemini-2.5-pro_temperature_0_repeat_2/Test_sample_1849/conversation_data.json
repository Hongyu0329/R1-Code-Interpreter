    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm is a fundamental concept in reinforcement learning. To determine the conditions under which it converges, we need to analyze its core update rule, which is based on the Bellman operator.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Value Iteration Update Rule:** The algorithm iteratively updates the value function `V(s)` for each state `s` using the Bellman operator `T`:\n    `V_{k+1}(s) = T(V_k)(s) = max_a (R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s'))`\n    where `R` is the reward, `γ` is the discount factor, and `P` is the transition probability.\n\n2.  **Identify the Convergence Condition:** The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the unique optimal value function `V*` if the Bellman operator `T` is a **contraction mapping** in the max-norm. This means there exists a constant `c` with `0 <= c < 1` such that for any two value functions `V1` and `V2`:\n    `||T(V1) - T(V2)||_∞ <= c * ||V1 - V2||_∞`\n    where `||V||_∞ = max_s |V(s)|`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Contraction Property:** We will show how the reward function `R` behaves in the contraction proof. By demonstrating that `R` cancels out, we can conclude that the range of `R` does not affect the convergence property itself.\n\n4.  **Write Python Code to Explain:** The Python code will not perform a numerical simulation but will use print statements to walk through the mathematical proof, highlighting the key steps and the role of the reward function.\n\n```python\ndef explain_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the convergence condition for the value iteration algorithm\n    and the role of the reward function's range.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Value Iteration Algorithm and Convergence Analysis\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n    # 1.
