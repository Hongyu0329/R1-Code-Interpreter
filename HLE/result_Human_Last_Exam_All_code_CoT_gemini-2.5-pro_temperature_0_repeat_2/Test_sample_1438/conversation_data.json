    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the properties of fermions are captured using anti-commuting numbers known as Grassmann variables. The Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state, is mathematically encoded in the property that for any Grassmann variable `η`, its square is zero: `η² = 0`.\n\nThe integration measure for these variables, `dη`, is not a value in the traditional sense but is defined by a set of rules for integration (Berezin integral). These rules are specifically constructed to be consistent with the `η² = 0` property. The two fundamental rules are:\n\n1.  `∫ dη = 0`\n2.  `∫ dη η = 1`\n\nTo demonstrate the consequence of this measure, we can calculate the value of the most fundamental integral in fermionic path integrals: the Gaussian Grassmann integral for a pair of complex Grassmann variables `ψ` and `ψ̄` (representing a fermion and its conjugate). The result of this integral is the key \"value\" that emerges from the measure.\n\nThe following Python code will symbolically walk through the steps to calculate this integral, `I = ∫ dψ̄ dψ e^(-aψ̄ψ)`, where `a` is a complex number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_fermionic_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically calculates the Gaussian Grassmann integral for a single complex fermion.\n    This demonstrates the result of the integration measure that maintains the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Problem: Calculate the value of the integral I = ∫ dψ̄ dψ e^(-aψ̄ψ)\")\n    print(\"This is the fundamental Gaussian integral for a single complex fermion.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Taylor expand the exponential.\")\n    print(\"Because ψ² = 0 and ψ̄² = 0, any term with (ψ̄ψ)² or higher is zero.\")\n    print(\"(ψ̄ψ)² = ψ̄ψψ̄ψ = -ψ̄ψ̄ψψ = 0.\")\n    print(\"So, the expansion truncates after the linear term:\")\n    print(\"e^(-aψ̄ψ) = 1 - aψ̄ψ\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Substitute the expansion into the integral.\")\n    print(\"I = ∫ dψ̄ dψ (1 - aψ̄ψ)\")\n    print(\"I = ∫ dψ̄ dψ (1) - a * ∫ dψ̄ dψ (ψ̄ψ)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluate the first term.\")\n    print(\"Using the rule ∫ dη = 0:\")\n    print(\"∫ dψ̄ dψ (1) = ∫ dψ̄ (∫ dψ * 1) = ∫ dψ̄ (0) = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Evaluate the second term, J = ∫ dψ̄ dψ (ψ̄ψ).\")\n    print(\"We integrate with respect to ψ first.
