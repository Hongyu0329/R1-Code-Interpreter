    "My plan is to solve this problem by simulating each of the three Turing Machines. Here are the steps I will take:\n\n1.  **Parse the Rules**: I will first write a function to parse the compact string representation of each Turing Machine's rules into a more usable data structure. I'll assume the standard convention where the rules are listed in order for states A, B, C, etc., and for each state, the rules for reading a '0' and a '1' are given sequentially.\n2.  **Implement the Simulator**: I will create a Turing Machine simulator function. This function will manage the machine's state, its tape (represented as a dictionary to handle infinite length in both directions), the head's position, and a step counter.\n3.  **Execute Simulation**: The simulator will start from State 'A' on an empty (all zeros) tape. It will run step-by-step, applying the rules, until it reaches the 'H' (Halt) state. I will also include a safety limit on the maximum number of steps to prevent getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n4.  **Determine the Winner**: I will run the simulation for all three machines, record the number of steps each one takes to halt, and then identify which machine ran for the longest time.\n5.  **Output the Result**: The final code will print the step counts for each machine and then explicitly state which machine took the most steps and what that count was.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the simulation and find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_turing_machines():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates three Turing Machines to determine which one\n    halts after the most steps on an empty initial tape.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the Turing Machine rules from the input strings ---\n    # The rules for each machine are provided as a single string.\n    machine_strings = [\n        \"B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L\",  # Machine 1\n        \"B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R\",  # Machine 2\n        \"B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R\"   # Machine 3\n    ]\n\n    def parse_rules(rule_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        Parses the compact rule string into a list of rule tuples.\n        Format: (next_state, value_to_write, direction_to_move)\n        \"\"\"\n        parts = rule_string.split()\n        # The number of states is half the number of rules (since there's a rule for 0 and 1)\n        num_states = len(parts) // 2\n        # Map state characters (A, B, C...) to integer indices (0, 1, 2...)\n        state_map = {chr(ord('A') + i): i for i in range(num_states)}\n        state_map['H'] = -1  # Use -1 to represent the Halt state\n\n        # Create a structure to hold the parsed rules\n        parsed_rules = [[None, None] for _ in range(num_states)]\n\n        for i in range(num_states):\n            for j in range(2):  # j=0 for tape value '0', j=1 for tape value '1'\n                rule_str = parts[i * 2 + j]\n                \n                next_state_char = rule_str[0]\n                write_val = int(rule_str[1])\n                move_char = rule_str[2]\n\n                next_state_idx = state_map[next_state_char]\n                move_direction = 1 if move_char == 'R' else -1\n\n                parsed_rules[i][j] = (next_state_idx, write_val, move_direction)\n        return parsed_rules\n\n    # --- Step 2: Implement the Turing Machine simulator ---\n    def simulate_tm(rules, max_steps=2000000):\n        \"\"\"\n        Simulates a Turing Machine based on a given set of rules.\n        \"\"\"\n        tape = {}  # Use a dictionary for the tape to allow for negative indices\n        head_pos = 0\n        state = 0  # Start in state 'A' (index 0)\n        steps = 0\n\n        while state != -1:  # Loop until we reach the Halt state\n            if steps >= max_steps:\n                return -1  # Return -1 if it runs too long (likely doesn't halt)\n\n            # Read the value on the tape at the current head position.
