    "My plan to solve this geographical riddle is to deconstruct the clues provided and use them as filters to identify the correct location.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Isolation:** The location is an island town \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\" This points to one of the most remote inhabited islands on Earth.\n    *   **Geography:** The town \"sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\" This is a very specific geological feature.\n    *   **Nomenclature:** The bay \"shares the town's name.\"\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** Extremely isolated, but its main settlement, Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, doesn't fit the naming or caldera bay criteria.\n    *   **Santorini, Greece:** A famous caldera, but it's not isolated; it's close to many other Greek islands.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** This is a prime candidate. It is one of the most isolated inhabited islands in the world, over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands. Its main town is named **Hanga Roa**, and it is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**, satisfying the name-sharing clue. The entire island is volcanic, and the town is located between two extinct volcanoes. One of these, Rano Kau, is a massive and famous caldera whose formation created the headland of the bay.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Hanga Roa on Easter Island is the only location that fits all the clues.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the geographical riddle based on a step-by-step analysis of the clues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Clue 1: More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    # This points to a highly remote location like Easter Island.\n    # Distance from Easter Island to Pitcairn Islands is ~2,075 km.\n    distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km = 2075\n    \n    # Clue 2 & 3: Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name.\n    # On Easter Island, the main town is Hanga Roa.\n    # It is located on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    # The bay is on a volcanic island and is geographically shaped by the massive Rano Kau caldera.\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    bay_name = \"Hanga Roa Bay\"\n    \n    # Verification\n    is_remote = distance_to_nearest_inhabited_land_km > 500\n    name_matches = town_name in bay_name\n    \n    if is_remote and name_matches:\n        print(f\"The island town is: {town_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
