    "Of all the noble gases, Radon (Rn) is technically the rarest on Earth. However, because Radon is radioactive, highly unstable (its most stable isotope has a half-life of only 3.8 days), and its concentration varies wildly, the rarest *stable* noble gas, Xenon (Xe), is typically cited as the answer.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that calculates the abundance of Xenon as a percentage of Earth's total mass. This directly addresses the user's question about the \"percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" The physical constants used, such as the mass of the Earth and the total mass of Xenon, have not changed since 2002.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the total mass of the Earth and the total mass of Xenon in the atmosphere (which accounts for over 99.99% of all Xenon on Earth).\n2.  Calculate the percentage by dividing the mass of Xenon by the mass of the Earth and multiplying by 100.\n3.  Print the inputs to the calculation and the final result to show the steps, as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the abundance of Xenon, the rarest stable noble gas,\n# as a percentage of Earth's total mass. The values used are standard\n# scientific constants that were the same in 2002.\n\n# Step 1: Define the necessary constants.\n# The mass of the Earth in kilograms.\nmass_of_earth_kg = 5.972 * (10**24)\n\n# The total mass of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere in kilograms.\n# This is an excellent approximation for the total mass of Xenon on Earth.\nmass_of_xenon_kg = 1.9 * (10**13)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the percentage.\n# The formula is (mass of Xenon / mass of Earth) * 100.\npercentage = (mass_of_xenon_kg / mass_of_earth_kg) * 100\n\n# Step 3: Print the results and the components of the calculation.\nprint(\"The rarest stable noble gas on Earth is Xenon (Xe).\")\nprint(\"Its abundance as a percentage of all terrestrial matter is calculated below.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(f\"Total mass of Xenon (kg): {mass_of_xenon_kg}\")\nprint(f\"Total mass of Earth (kg): {mass_of_earth_kg}\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: ({mass_of_xenon_kg} / {mass_of_earth_kg}) * 100\")\nprint(f\"Resulting Percentage: {percentage:.12f}%\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"Note: While Radon (Rn) is technically rarer, it is unstable and radioactive, so Xenon is considered the rarest stable noble gas.\")\n```\n<<<Xenon>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
