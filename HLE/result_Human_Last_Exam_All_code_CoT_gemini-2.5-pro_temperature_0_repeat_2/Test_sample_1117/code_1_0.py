    1.  The reaction is an 'exohedral functionalization'. The disilirane molecule adds to the OUTER surface of the C80 carbon cage. The cerium atoms remain trapped inside and do not directly interact or bond with the disilirane. This rules out any direct coordination.

    2.  Inside the cage, the two cerium atoms donate electrons to the carbon cage, becoming positively charged ions. These two positive ions strongly repel each other.

    3.  In the symmetric C80 cage before the reaction, the cerium ions already tend to align along a major axis to be as far apart as possible, occupying positions at the 'poles'.

    4.  The addition of the bulky disilirane group to the outside breaks the fullerene's symmetry and creates a single, well-defined molecular axis.

    5.  This external change alters the potential energy landscape inside the cage, effectively 'locking' the internal Ce-Ce axis into alignment with this new molecular axis. The two cerium atoms, still pushing each other apart, are now fixed in position at the opposite ends of this axis.

    Conclusion: The cerium atoms are now positioned at the poles of the fullerene, with their positions being fixed by the external chemical modification.
