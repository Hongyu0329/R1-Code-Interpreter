    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis of the question and the corresponding Python code to explain the answer.\n\nThe question asks to identify the ballroom dance in which overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible without violating the dance's core principles. To solve this, we need to analyze the fundamental techniques of each dance listed.\n\n1.  **Swing Dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep):** These dances are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, body sway, and rise and fall (except for Quickstep's version). In these dances, altering the amount of turn in a figure (overturning or underturning) is a common and necessary tool for \"floorcraft\"â€”navigating the dance floor and avoiding other couples. While a textbook figure has a prescribed amount of turn, a skilled dancer can and must adjust this rotation without violating the dance's technique.\n\n2.  **European Tango:** This dance is unique among the Standard dances. Its technique is fundamentally different. It has no body sway, no rise and fall, and its movement is sharp, staccato, and progressive. Turns are executed with precise foot placements and CBM (Contra Body Movement), but without the rotational swing or momentum found in the other dances. Attempting to add more rotation (overturn) to a figure like the Reverse Turn would require introducing body sway or taking additional, non-standard steps, which would fundamentally disregard and violate the core staccato technique of the Tango.\n\nTherefore, the European Tango is the correct answer. The following Python script outlines this reasoning.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical aspects of turning in different ballroom dances\n    to determine in which one overturning a reverse turn is technically impossible.\n    \"\"\"\n    dances_analysis = {\n        'A': 'Viennese Waltz: A swing dance where altering turn, while difficult due to speed, is possible for floorcraft.',\n        'B': 'English Waltz: A swing dance where overturning/underturning is a key part of floorcraft and choreography.',\n        'C': 'European Tango: Has no body sway. Turns are sharp and precise. Overturning would require adding rotational sway, which violates the core staccato technique.',\n        'D': 'Slow Foxtrot: A swing dance where adjusting turn is essential for its smooth, continuous character and for floorcraft.',\n        'E': 'Quickstep: A dynamic swing dance where altering rotation is necessary to navigate the floor at speed.'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analysis of Turning Technique in Ballroom Dances:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    for choice, reason in dances_analysis.items():\n        print(f\"Choice {choice}: {reason}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    correct_choice = 'C'\n    final_answer_dance = \"European Tango\"\n\n    # The \"final equation\" is showing the logic to the final answer.\n    print(\"\\nFinal Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The dance that fits the description is the {final_answer_dance}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the final answer is choice: {correct_choice}\")\n\nsolve_dance_question()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
