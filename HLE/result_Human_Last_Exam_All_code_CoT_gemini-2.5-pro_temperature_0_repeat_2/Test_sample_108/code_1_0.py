# Define the lengths of the robot arm segments
l1 = 40  # Shoulder to Elbow
l2 = 28  # Elbow to Wrist
l3 = 15  # Wrist to Hand
l4 = 10  # Hand (finger)

# Define the minimum clearance
clearance = 1

# Calculate the length of the first virtual link (P0 to P2)
# This represents the distance from the shoulder to the wrist if L1 and L2 are folded back.
d1 = l1 - l2

# Calculate the length of the second virtual link (P2 to P4)
# This represents the distance from the wrist to the finger if L3 and L4 are folded back.
# We adjust this length by the clearance value to account for the self-collision constraint.
d2 = l3 - l4 - clearance

# Calculate the final distance using the Pythagorean theorem.
# This models a minimal configuration where the virtual links form a right-angled triangle.
# The distance is one side of the triangle, with d1 as the hypotenuse and d2 as the other side.
final_distance = math.sqrt(d1**2 - d2**2)
