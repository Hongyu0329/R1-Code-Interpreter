    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ (also known as the non-interacting Green's function) describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is most clearly seen in the frequency-momentum representation.\n\nThe key idea is that the Green's function will have a singularity (a pole) when the energy of the propagating particle (represented by the frequency variable $\\omega$) matches the energy of an allowed single-particle state, $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe functional form is an inverse relationship, specifically:\n\n$G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta_{\\text{eff}}}$\n\nHere, the term $i\\eta_{\\text{eff}}$ is a crucial small imaginary part that shifts the pole slightly off the real axis. This ensures the causality of the propagator, meaning that effects do not precede their causes. The exact sign of this imaginary term depends on whether the state with energy $\\epsilon_k$ is occupied (a \"hole\" state) or unoccupied (a \"particle\" state) relative to the Fermi level (or chemical potential $\\mu$).\n\nFor the time-ordered (Feynman) Green's function, this is concisely written as:\n\n$G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere `sgn` is the sign function. This shows that the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy $\\epsilon_k$.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this relationship by calculating the value of $G_0$ for a specific set of parameters and printing the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the bare Green's function G_0 for a given set of parameters.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # omega: The frequency (energy) of the particle being propagated.\n    # epsilon_k: The energy eigenvalue of a specific single-particle state 'k'.\n    # mu: The chemical potential, which defines the Fermi level (energy separating occupied and unoccupied states).\n    # eta: A small positive infinitesimal to enforce causality.\n    omega = 2.5\n    epsilon_k = 2.0\n    mu = 0.0\n    eta = 0.1\n\n    # --- Explanation ---\n    print(\"The bare (non-interacting) time-ordered Green's function G_0(omega, k) depends on the\")\n    print(\"single-particle energy eigenvalue epsilon_k as follows:\")\n    print(\"\\n  G_0(omega, k) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i * eta * sgn(epsilon_k - mu))\\n\")\n    print(\"This shows G_0 is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency 'omega'\")\n    print(\"and the single-particle energy 'epsilon_k'.\\n\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Calculation for a specific case ---\n    print(\"Let's calculate G_0 for a specific set of values:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency (omega)              = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Single-particle energy (eps_k) = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Chemical potential (mu)        = {mu}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal (eta)            = {eta}\\n\")\n\n    # Calculate the sign term, which determines if the state is a particle or hole\n    sign_term = np.sign(epsilon_k - mu)\n\n    # --- Output the final equation with numbers ---\n    # Determine the sign for the imaginary part in the string representation\n    imag_sign = \"+\" if sign_term >= 0 else \"-\"\n    # The value of the imaginary part in the denominator\n    imag_value = eta * abs(sign_term)\n\n    print(\"The final equation with these numbers is:\")\n    # Using 1j for the imaginary unit in the calculation\n    denominator_calc = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta * sign_term\n    final_result = 1 / denominator_calc\n\n    # We explicitly show each number in the printed equation\n    print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ( {omega} - {epsilon_k} {imag_sign} i * {imag_value} )\")\n    print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ( {omega - epsilon_k} {imag_sign} i * {imag_value} )\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The final calculated value is:\")\n    print(f\"  G_0 = {final_result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<$G_0(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$>>>"
