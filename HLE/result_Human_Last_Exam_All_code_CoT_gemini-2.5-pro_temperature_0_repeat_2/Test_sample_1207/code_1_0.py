    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms.
    # The patient presents with a multi-system disorder involving:
    # - Eyes (transient monocular vision loss)
    # - CNS (pulsatile headaches, hearing loss, psychiatric history)
    # - Joints (joint pain)
    # - Lungs (dyspnea)
    # - Skin (painful area on lower extremity, likely erythema nodosum)
    symptoms_analysis = """
    The patient's presentation with transient monocular vision loss, pulsatile headaches, joint pain, dyspnea, hearing loss, and a painful lower extremity lesion points towards a systemic inflammatory disease. The constellation of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems is highly characteristic of Sarcoidosis.
    """

    # Step 2: Evaluate the answer choices in the context of Sarcoidosis.
    # - A. Periarticular bone demineralization: More typical for rheumatoid arthritis.
    # - B. Leptomeningeal enhancement with "snowball" hyperintensities: Leptomeningeal enhancement is a classic finding in neurosarcoidosis, resulting from granulomatous inflammation of the brain's coverings. This explains the headaches and cranial nerve involvement (hearing loss).
    # - C. Pleural effusion: Possible in pulmonary sarcoidosis but less common than hilar adenopathy.
    # - D. Vascular hemorrhage: A possible complication, but inflammation/enhancement is the primary finding.
    # - E. Intrasellar mass: A less common presentation of neurosarcoidosis.
    evaluation = """
    Given that Sarcoidosis is the most likely diagnosis, we look for the most characteristic imaging finding. Neurosarcoidosis frequently presents with inflammation of the meninges, which appears as leptomeningeal enhancement on a contrast-enhanced MRI. This finding directly correlates with the patient's neurological symptoms.
    """

    # Step 3: Conclude the most likely answer.
    conclusion = """
    Therefore, the most expected imaging modality and finding is an MRI showing leptomeningeal enhancement.
