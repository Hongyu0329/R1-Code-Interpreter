    # Step 1: The Bose-Einstein Distribution
    # The average number of particles, n(ε), in a single-particle state with energy ε
    # is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution.
    # n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)
    # where μ is the chemical potential, k_B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.
    print("Step 1: The Bose-Einstein distribution for the occupation number n(ε) of a state with energy ε is:")
    print("n(ε) = 1 / (exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1)\n")

    # Step 2: The Physical Constraint
    # A core physical principle is that the number of particles in any state cannot be negative.
    # Therefore, n(ε) must be greater than or equal to zero for all possible energy states ε.
    print("Step 2: A physical requirement is that the occupation number must be non-negative:")
    print("n(ε) >= 0\n")

    # Step 3: Deriving the Mathematical Condition
    # For n(ε) to be positive, the denominator of the distribution must also be positive.
    # exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) - 1 > 0
    # This implies: exp((ε - μ) / (k_B * T)) > 1
    # Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives: (ε - μ) / (k_B * T) > 0
    # Since k_B and T are positive, this simplifies to: ε - μ > 0, or μ < ε.
    print("Step 3: For n(ε) to be positive, the denominator must be positive, which leads to the condition:")
    print("μ < ε\n")

    # Step 4: The Most Stringent Limit
    # This condition, μ < ε, must hold for all available energy states. The most restrictive
    # or stringent condition is set by the lowest possible energy, the ground state energy, ε₀.
    # Therefore, the chemical potential must always be less than or equal to the ground state energy.
    # In the limit, as condensation is approached, μ approaches ε₀.
    print("Step 4: This condition must hold for all energy states, so the most stringent limit is set by the ground state energy ε₀:")
    print("μ <= ε₀\n")

    # Step 5: Behavior at Condensation
    # As the system is cooled towards the critical temperature (T_c), a macroscopic number of
    # particles begins to occupy the ground state. For n(ε₀) to become very large, its
    # denominator must approach zero. This means μ must approach ε₀ from below.
    # For T <= T_c, the chemical potential is effectively pinned at this limit: μ = ε₀.
    print("Step 5: At the onset of condensation (T <= T_c), the chemical potential μ approaches and becomes equal to the ground state energy ε₀.\n")

    # Step 6: Relation to T=0 Chemical Potential
    # The chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at absolute zero (T=0) is the energy
    # needed to add a particle to the system. Since all particles are already in the ground state,
    # this energy is simply the ground state energy, ε₀.
    # So, μ(T=0) = ε₀.
    print("Step 6: The chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at T=0 is also equal to ε₀.\n")

    # Step 7: Conclusion
    # The fundamental limit for μ is the ground state energy ε₀, which is the same as the
    # chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at T=0. This matches choice C.
    print("Conclusion: The fundamental limit on μ is that it must be less than or equal to the ground state energy, a value it reaches at condensation. This value is equal to the chemical potential of a non-interacting Bose gas at zero temperature.")
