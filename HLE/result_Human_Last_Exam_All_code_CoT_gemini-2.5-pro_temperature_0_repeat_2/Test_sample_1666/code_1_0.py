    # Question 1: Bryan's Employment Agreement
    print("1. Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in Bryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?")
    print("   - Analysis: Yes. Restrictive covenants are more easily enforced when tied to the sale of a business to protect goodwill. As a former owner and new CEO, the scope (6-month non-compete in Ontario, 1-year non-solicit) is likely considered reasonable.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Enforceable.\n")

    # Question 2: Ryan's Employment Agreement
    print("2. Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in Ryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?")
    print("   - Analysis: No. Despite being a former owner, Ryan's role as a 'Shift Manager' is non-executive. A province-wide non-compete is overly broad and unreasonable for such a position. The clauses are likely unenforceable.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Unenforceable.\n")

    # Question 3: New Employees' Employment Agreements
    print("3. Are the Employment Agreements for the 20 new employees entirely valid and enforceable?")
    print("   - Analysis: The agreements are generally valid, but the non-competition clauses are not. Under Ontario law, non-competes are prohibited for non-executive employees. An unenforceable clause typically does not void the entire contract; it is severed.")
    print("   - Conclusion: The agreements are valid, but the non-competition clauses are unenforceable.\n")

    # Question 4: The Pickup Truck
    print("4. Is Bryan required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan?")
    print("   - Analysis: No. For a contract to be valid, there must be consideration from both parties. Bryan's promise was a gratuitous promise (a gift) made out of appreciation, not in exchange for something of value from Stan. It is not a legally enforceable contract.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Not required.\n")

    print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Answer Choice Evaluation:")
    print("The analysis concludes that Bryan's clauses are enforceable, Ryan's are not, the new employees' non-competes are unenforceable (but the agreements are otherwise valid), and Bryan is not required to transfer the truck.")
    print("This combination of outcomes matches option A.")

    final_answer = "A"
    print(f"\n<<<The non-competition and non-solicitation clauses included in Bryan’s Employment Agreement with B&R Inc. are valid and enforceable, but the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses included as part of Ryan’s Employment Agreement are not enforceable.  The Employment Agreements with the new employees are valid, but the non-competition clauses will be viewed as unenforceable.  Bryan is not required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan.>>>")
