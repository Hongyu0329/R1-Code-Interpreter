    "This is a problem from combinatorial group theory. The solution relies on a known classification theorem. My plan is to:\n1.

Write a Python script to present this information, including an \"equation\" that sums up the count as requested.\n\nThe classification is a result established by mathematicians such as Kopylov, and Belov and Constantinov.
