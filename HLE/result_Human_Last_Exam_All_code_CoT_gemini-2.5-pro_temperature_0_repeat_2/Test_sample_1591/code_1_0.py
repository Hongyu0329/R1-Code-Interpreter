    This function solves the given boundary-value problem.
    
    The problem asks for the value of the expression:
    (x_n^1 - (3*r)/(2*pi)*sin(2*pi*n/3))^2 + (x_n^2)^2
    for n = 10^15.

    Step-by-step derivation:
    1. The system is periodic with period 3. Since 10^15 mod 3 = 1, the expression
       at n = 10^15 is the same as at n = 1.
    2. The expression at n=1 can be shown to be equal to the expression at n=0, which is
       (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
    3. The boundary condition x_2025^2 = 10^20 implies x_0^2 = 10^20 due to the 3-periodicity
       (2025 is a multiple of 3).
    4. The second boundary condition, -2/3*x_1^1 - 2/sqrt(3)*x_1^2 + sqrt(3)/(2*pi) = 0,
       leads to the relation: x_0^1 - sqrt(3)*x_0^2 = (3*sqrt(3)/(4*pi))*(1-r).
    5. For the problem to have a unique, well-defined solution, the result cannot depend on
       the free parameter 'r'. This suggests that the problem is implicitly constructed
       such that r=1.
    6. Assuming r=1, the relation simplifies to x_0^1 - sqrt(3)*x_0^2 = 0, so x_0^1 = sqrt(3)*x_0^2.
    7. We can now calculate the final value (x_0^1)^2 + (x_0^2)^2.
