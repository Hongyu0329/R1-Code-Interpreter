    """
    This function determines the scientific basis for using bypass notches in sheet metal forming.

    The core function of bypass notches in stamping dies is to manage the flow of material
    as the flat sheet is formed into a 3D shape. This is especially critical around
    complex geometries like small radii or sharp corners where material can either bunch up
    (causing wrinkles) or be overly restricted (causing thinning and tearing).

    Therefore, the notches are a tool to directly address and control the inflow of material.

    # The answer choices are:
    # A. To counteract overlapping wrinkle formation...
    # B. To counteract residual stresses...
    # C. To counteract the negative effect of certain sheet coatings...
    # D. To counteract issues of material inflow into forming cavities around complex geometries...
    # E. To counteract the unisotropic behaviour...
    # F. To counteract spike shaped burr formation...
    # G. To counteract an unwanted hydroforming effect of oil...
    # H. To counteract rollover zones...
    # I. To counteract excessive thinning...
    # J. To counteract crack formation during a bending operation...
    # K. To counteract biaxial stretching...

    # Option D is the most fundamental and encompassing reason. Wrinkles (A) and thinning (I)
    # are consequences of the material inflow issues described in D.
