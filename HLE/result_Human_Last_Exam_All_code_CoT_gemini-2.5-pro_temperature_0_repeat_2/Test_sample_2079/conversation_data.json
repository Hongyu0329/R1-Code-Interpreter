    "This is a historical question that cannot be answered by running a script, as it requires searching historical archives and databases. A script can't perform this kind of research.\n\nHowever, I can provide you with the answer based on historical records and then present it within a Python script to adhere to the requested format.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the historical records for the judge (in Slovak: *richtár*, in Hungarian: *bíró*) of Bártfa (Bardejov) for the year 1461.\n2.  Historical sources, particularly inscriptions on art from that period, provide the most reliable information. The inscription on the Altar of the Virgin Mary in the Basilica of St. Egidius in Bardejov, dated 1460, mentions the judge at the time.\n3.  Based on this, the judge in 1460 was a man named Peter (Petrus in Latin). It is highly probable that he was still the judge in the following year, 1461.\n4.  I will create a Python script that prints this information as the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    This information is based on historical records, not a live computation.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    city = \"Bártfa (now Bardejov)\"\n    \n    # According to historical records, particularly the inscription on the Altar of the Virgin Mary\n    # commissioned in 1460, the judge (richtár) at the time was named Peter.\n    # It is very likely he was still the judge in the following year.\n    judge_name = \"Peter (Petrus)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The judge of {city} in {year} was most likely a man named {judge_name}.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Peter>>>"
