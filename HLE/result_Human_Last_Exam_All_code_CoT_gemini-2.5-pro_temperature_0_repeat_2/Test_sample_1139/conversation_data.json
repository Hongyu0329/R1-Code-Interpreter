    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of independent real variables required to parametrize the appropriate mathematical space. This number is the dimension of the target manifold of the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the Target Manifold:** For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target manifold for the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with `n` replicas is the symmetric space O(2n) / U(n).\n2.  **Determine the Dimension:** The dimension of a quotient space G/H is calculated as dim(G) - dim(H).\n3.  **Calculate Group Dimensions:** We will use the standard formulas for the dimensions of the orthogonal group O(k) and the unitary group U(k):\n    *   dim(O(k)) = k * (k - 1) / 2\n    *   dim(U(k)) = k^2\n4.  **Substitute Values:** We are given `n = 2` replicas. Therefore, the manifold is O(4) / U(2). We will calculate the dimensions of O(4) and U(2) and find their difference.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_variables_class_d(n_replicas):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric\n    sigma-model of symmetry class D.\n\n    The bosonic sector's target manifold for class D with n replicas is O(2n)/U(n).\n    The number of variables is the dimension of this manifold.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"For symmetry class D with n={n_replicas} replicas, the target manifold for the bosonic sector is O(2*n) / U(n).\")\n    \n    # Parameters for the groups\n    k_O = 2 * n_replicas\n    k_U = n_replicas\n    \n    print(f\"For n={n_replicas}, this becomes the manifold O({k_O}) / U({k_U}).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe number of variables is the dimension of this manifold, calculated as dim(O(k)) - dim(U(k)).\")\n\n    # Dimension of O(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2\n    dim_O = (k_O * (k_O - 1)) // 2\n    print(f\"\\nFirst, we calculate the dimension of O({k_O}):\")\n    print(f\"dim(O({k_O})) = ({k_O} * ({k_O} - 1)) / 2 = {dim_O}\")\n\n    # Dimension of U(k) = k^2\n    dim_U = k_U ** 2\n    print(f\"\\nNext, we calculate the dimension of U({k_U}):\")\n    print(f\"dim(U({k_U})) = {k_U}^2 = {dim_U}\")\n\n    # Dimension of the quotient space\n    num_variables = dim_O - dim_U\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinally, we find the difference to get the number of non-Grassman variables:\")\n    print(f\"Number of variables = dim(O({k_O})) - dim(U({k_U}))\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {dim_O} - {dim_U} = {num_variables}\")\n\n# Number of replicas given in the problem\nn = 2\ncalculate_variables_class_d(n)\n```\n<<<2>>>"
