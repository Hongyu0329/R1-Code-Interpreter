    "Of course. Here is a plan to derive the expression, followed by a Python script that carries out the calculation and prints the result.\n\n### Plan\n\nMy plan is to solve this problem by first recalling the theoretical background of the phi^4 theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions. I will then write a Python script that performs the following steps:\n\n1.  State the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u`, which governs its change with the energy scale.\n2.  Explain that a fixed point `u*` corresponds to a scale-invariant theory, which occurs when the beta function is zero (`β(u*) = 0`).\n3.  Set up and solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` for the non-trivial fixed point.\n4.  Print out the derivation steps and the final expression for `u*` in terms of `ϵ`, ensuring each numerical component of the final formula is explicitly shown in the output.\n\nThis will give us the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher\n    fixed point in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variables\n    # u_star represents the fixed point coupling constant.\n    # epsilon represents the deviation from 4 dimensions, d = 4 - epsilon.\n    u_star, epsilon = sympy.symbols('u^* epsilon')\n    pi = sympy.pi\n\n    # The one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling u in phi^4 theory\n    # in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions is given by:\n    # β(u) = -ε*u + (3*u^2) / (16*π^2)\n    # The first term arises from the canonical dimension of the coupling.\n    # The second term is the one-loop quantum correction.\n    beta_function_expr = -epsilon * u_star + (3 * u_star**2) / (16 * pi**2)\n\n    print(\"To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u^* in the ϕ^4 theory,\")\n    print(\"we start with the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - ε dimensions:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ε*u + (3*u^2) / (16*π^2)\\n\")\n\n    # Fixed points are found by solving β(u^*) = 0.\n    # This corresponds to a scale-invariant theory.\n    print(\"A fixed point u^* is a value of the coupling where the theory is scale-invariant,\")\n    print(\"which occurs when the beta function is zero.
