    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ and $D(s), N(s)$ are left coprime. Two polynomial matrices are considered left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: I will start by finding an initial, simple factorization. A straightforward way to do this is to clear the denominators of each row of $H(s)$ independently. This gives a diagonal polynomial matrix $D_{prelim}(s)$ and a corresponding polynomial matrix $N_{prelim}(s)$.\n2.  **Coprimeness Check**: This initial factorization is often not coprime. I will check for coprimeness by finding the roots of the determinant of $D_{prelim}(s)$. At these roots, I will evaluate the rank of the composite matrix $[D_{prelim}(s) \\quad N_{prelim}(s)]$. If the rank is less than the number of rows, the factorization is not coprime at that root.\n3.  **Factor Reduction**: If a rank deficiency is found at a root $s_i$, it indicates a common left divisor involving the term $(s-s_i)$. I will find the linear dependency among the rows of the evaluated matrix. Then, I'll apply this row operation to the polynomial matrices $D_{prelim}(s)$ and $N_{prelim}(s)$ using a unimodular matrix. This process isolates the common factor, which can then be canceled out.\n4.  **Final Result**: I will repeat the process until the factorization is coprime. The resulting matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, will be the final answer.\n\nI will now provide the Python code that implements this step-by-step plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_left_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function H(s).\n    The factorization is of the form H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the symbolic variable and printing\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n    sympy.init_printing(use_unicode=True, wrap_line=False)\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n    print(\"Given transfer function H(s):\")\n    sympy.pprint(H)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 1: Find an initial factorization by clearing denominators row-by-row.\n    # The least common denominator for row 1 is (s+1).\n    # The least common denominator for row 2 is (s^2-1).\n    D_prelim = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s + 1, 0],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n    \n    # Calculate N_prelim = D_prelim * H\n    N_prelim = sympy.simplify(D_prelim * H)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Initial (non-coprime) factorization H(s) = D_prelim(s)^-1 * N_prelim(s)\")\n    print(\"D_prelim(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D_prelim)\n    print(\"\\nN_prelim(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N_prelim)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Check for coprimeness at the roots of det(D_prelim(s)).\n    # det(D_prelim(s)) = (s+1)*(s^2-1).
