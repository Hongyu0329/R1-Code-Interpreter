    # Step 2: Define the expected product from the reaction with 2 eq. of NBS.
    # The most reactive positions for bromination are the C5 positions on the outer thiophenes.
    # With 2 equivalents of NBS, we expect a symmetric di-brominated product.
    # This product would have two types of aromatic protons:

    # 2. The H1/H7 protons on the inner, fused thiophene rings (equivalent).

    # Step 4: Propose a new structure that fits the data.
    # The sluggish reaction and excess NBS (2.5 eq) likely led to over-bromination.
    # A tri-brominated product, where the third bromine adds to an inner core position (e.g., C1), would break the molecule's symmetry.
    # An asymmetric molecule would have:
    # 1. One H3 proton on the first outer thiophene.
    # 2. A different H3 proton on the second outer thiophene.
    # 3. The remaining H7 proton on the inner core.
    # This results in 3 unique aromatic signals, matching the observation.
