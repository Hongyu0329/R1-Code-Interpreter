    """
    This function analyzes the provided options and determines the best solution
    for the biometric authentication challenge.

    The four key requirements are:
    1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
    2. An unwilling (coerced) user will NOT authenticate.
    3. The system remains uncompromised if biometric data is stolen.
    4. The solution applies to a wide range of biometric modalities.

    Analysis of the best fit:
    - Option H, Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication, uniquely addresses all four points.
    - It uses context (location, IP, device) to detect spoofing and coercion (e.g., a user in an unusual location).
    - It makes stolen biometric data less useful because the attacker would also need to replicate the context.
    - It is independent of the specific biometric modality used.
    """

    explanation = "Adaptive Context-Aware Authentication is the only solution that comprehensively addresses all four requirements: preventing spoofing, protecting against coercion by detecting anomalous contexts (like a kidnapping), making stolen data less useful without the correct context, and being applicable across all biometric types."
