No, the approach is not scientifically valid. It is fundamentally flawed because the ecological function of mimicry is to signal to natural predators (like birds), not humans. Predators often have different visual systems (e.g., they can see UV light) and may perceive similarity very differently than a human observer. Therefore, clustering based on human perception can lead to ecologically incorrect conclusions about mimicry syndromes.
