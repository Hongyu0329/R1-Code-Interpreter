Step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **Point Types on the Berkovich Line over C_p:**
    The points on the Berkovich projective line over the complete, algebraically closed field C_p are classified as follows:
    - Type 1: Classical points corresponding to P^1(C_p). These are equivalent to disks of radius 0.
    - Type 2: Disks D(a, r) where the radius r is in the value group |C_p^x|_p = p^Q.
    - Type 3: Limits of nested sequences of disks, corresponding to disks with radii r not in p^Q.
    - Type 4: These points do not exist over a complete field like C_p.

2.  **Analyzing the Construction:**
    The problem considers points (z_0, z) from C_p^x * C_p. A point (z_0, z) can be mapped to a disk in C_p. A standard identification is to associate (z_0, z) with the disk D(a, r) where:
    - Center a = z / z_0
    - Radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p

3.  **Identifying Excluded Types:**
    - For a point to be Type 1, its corresponding disk must have a radius of 0 or infinity.
    - Since z_0 is in C_p^x, its norm |z_0|_p is finite and non-zero (0 < |z_0|_p < infinity).
    - Consequently, the radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p is also finite and non-zero (0 < r < infinity).
    - This means the construction cannot produce Type 1 points.
    - Type 4 points are already known not to exist over C_p.

4.  **Identifying Included Types:**
    - The value group of C_p^x is p^Q. For any z_0 in C_p^x, the radius r = 1 / |z_0|_p is an element of p^Q.
    - Disks with radii in p^Q are, by definition, Type 2 points. The construction can form any Type 2 disk by choosing appropriate z_0 and z. So, Type 2 points are included.
    - The specific equivalence relation given is known to define the Berkovich analytic upper half-plane. This space is the complement of the Type 1 points in the Berkovich line and is complete.
    - The set of Type 2 points is not complete. Its completion is the space containing both Type 2 and Type 3 points. Since the construction yields a complete space containing all Type 2 points, it must also include their limit points, which are the Type 3 points.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The subset includes points of Type 2 and Type 3.
    The numbers in the final answer are 2 and 3.
