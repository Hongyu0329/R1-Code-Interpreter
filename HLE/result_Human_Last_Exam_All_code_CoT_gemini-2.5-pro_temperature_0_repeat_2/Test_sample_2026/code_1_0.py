# Step 1: Define the squared radius (R²) of the sphere.
# From the derivation, the solvability conditions for the nonlinear problem
# require the initial values (x₀, y₀, z₀) to satisfy the equation of a sphere:
# x₀² + y₀² + z₀² = R²
# where R² is determined by the given constraint.
# The derivation yields: 2 * (x₀² + y₀² + z₀²) = 10²⁵
# Therefore, R² = 10²⁵ / 2.
R_squared = 10**25 / 2

# Step 2: The area required is the surface area of this sphere.
# The formula for the surface area of a sphere is A = 4 * π * R².
# Substituting R², we get A = 4 * π * (10²⁵ / 2), which simplifies to A = 2 * π * 10²⁵.

# Step 3: Define the numbers in the final simplified equation for the area.
num_factor = 2
pi_value = math.pi
num_power_of_10 = 10**25

# Step 4: Calculate the final area.
area = num_factor * pi_value * num_power_of_10

# Step 5: Print the results as requested by the prompt.
# The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.
print("The final equation for the area (A) is: A = 2 * π * 10²⁵")
print("The numbers that make up this equation are:")
print(f"Factor: {num_factor}")
print(f"Pi (π): {pi_value}")
print(f"Power of 10: {num_power_of_10:.0e}")

print(f"\nThe calculated total area is: {area}")
print(f"In scientific notation, the area is approximately: {area:.4e}")

# The final answer is the numerical value of the area.
# The <<<>>> format is used for the final answer as requested.
print(f"\n<<<{area}>>>")
