    # --- Statement A ---
    print("--- Statement A ---")
    print("A. Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. The KKT condition sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0 requires support vectors (where alpha_i > 0) from both classes (+1 and -1) for the sum to be zero.\n")

    # --- Statement B ---
    print("--- Statement B ---")
    print("B. With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. Cost-sensitive SVMs use different penalty parameters for each class, leading to optimal but unequal margins to handle class imbalance or asymmetric costs.\n")

    # --- Statement C ---
    print("--- Statement C ---")
    print("C. Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. This is the 'kernel trick'. The RBF kernel, for example, maps to an infinite-dimensional space, but its computation is tractable because we never form the feature vectors explicitly.\n")

    # --- Statement D ---
    print("--- Statement D ---")
    print("D. It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points.")
    print("Analysis: TRUE. The decision boundary is determined only by support vectors. Interior points have zero weight in the solution, so moving them (while keeping them interior) doesn't change the boundary.\n")

    # --- Statement E ---
    print("--- Statement E ---")
    print("E. Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer.")
    print("Analysis: FALSE. This is a false mathematical statement. A strictly convex function has at most one minimizer, but its existence is not guaranteed. For example, f(x) = e^x is strictly convex but has no minimum on the real line.\n")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The statement that is not true is E.")
