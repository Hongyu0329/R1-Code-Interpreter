    "The user is asking for the specific term used to describe the time value between heartbeats, which is the fundamental measurement for calculating Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify the correct terminology for the time between heartbeats. This is most commonly known as the \"Inter-Beat Interval\" (IBI) or, in the context of an ECG, the \"R-R interval\".\n2.  Create a simple Python script that defines this term and uses the `print()` function to display the answer, as requested by the user's instructions.\n3.  Provide the final, concise answer in the specified `<<<>>>` format.\n\n```python\ndef find_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the name of the value computed between\n    heartbeats to measure Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The value captured between consecutive heartbeats is the time interval.\n    # This is the fundamental data point for all HRV analysis.\n    value_name = \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\"\n    alternative_name = \"R-R Interval\" # Specifically from ECG QRS complex\n\n    # The prompt mentions PPG, for which IBI is a very common term.\n    # R-R interval is also widely used, even when the source isn't strictly an ECG.\n    \n    print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats for HRV is the time interval between them.\")\n    print(f\"This is most commonly called the '{value_name}' or '{alternative_name}'.\")\n\nfind_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
