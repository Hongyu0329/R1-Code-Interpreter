    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Theoretical Framework:** The problem requires using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a key tool in the renormalization group theory for calculating critical exponents.\n2.  **Define Parameters:**\n    *   The system is in the universality class of the Ising model, for which the order parameter has `n=1` component.\n    *   The spatial dimension is given as `d=3`.\n    *   The upper critical dimension `d_c` for this universality class is `4`.\n3.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The expansion parameter `ϵ` is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension: `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n4.  **State the Formula:** The first-order epsilon expansion for the specific heat exponent `α` for the O(n) model is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Perform the Calculation:** Substitute the values of `n` and `ϵ` into the formula to find the value of `α`.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** Create a Python script that automates this calculation, clearly showing each step and printing the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set encoding to utf-8 to ensure proper display of Greek letters\nif sys.stdout.encoding != 'utf-8':\n    sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Parameters ---\n    # For the Ising model universality class, the order parameter has n=1 component.\n    n = 1\n    # The spatial dimension of the system.\n    d = 3\n    # The upper critical dimension for this universality class.\n    d_c = 4\n\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat scaling exponent α for the Ising model (n=1) in d=3.\")\n    print(\"The calculation uses the epsilon (ϵ) expansion to first order.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate epsilon (ϵ) ---\n    # Epsilon is the deviation from the upper critical dimension d_c.\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the expansion parameter ϵ = d_c - d\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Apply the formula for α ---\n    # The first-order epsilon expansion formula for α is:\n    # α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the first-order epsilon expansion formula for α.\")\n    print(\"Formula: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    print(f\"Substituting n = {n} and ϵ = {epsilon} into the formula:\")\n\n    # Perform the calculation step-by-step\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    n_plus_8 = n + 8\n    denominator = 2 * n_plus_8\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / (2 * {n_plus_8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # --- Final Result ---\n    print(f\"The final calculated value for the scaling exponent α is: {alpha}\")\n    return alpha\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
