    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime 2, we will follow a procedure derived from the theory of stable reduction of hyperelliptic curves, often referred to as Tate's algorithm for hyperelliptic curves or Liu's algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the reduction modulo 2:** We'll start by reducing the equation of the curve modulo 2. This will reveal the structure of the singularity in the special fiber.\n2.  **Transform the equation:** The form of the reduced equation suggests a specific algebraic manipulation of the original equation. We will rewrite the polynomial $f(x)$ as $f(x) = g(x)^2 + 4k(x)$ for some polynomials $g(x)$ and $k(x)$.\n3.  **Analyze the key polynomial:** The properties of the stable reduction are encoded in the polynomial $k(x)$. We will reduce $k(x)$ modulo 2 to get a polynomial $\\bar{k}(x)$.\n4.  **Determine the multiplicity:** The number of double points is determined by the multiplicity of the roots of $\\bar{g}(x)$ (the reduction of $g(x)$) in the polynomial $\\bar{k}(x)$.\n5.  **Calculate the final number:** A standard formula gives the number of double points as $m-1$, where $m$ is the multiplicity found in the previous step.\n\nThis entire process can be implemented using Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define x as a symbol for our polynomial\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n\n    # The polynomial f(x) from the curve equation y^2 = f(x)\n    f = 8*x**5 + 4*x**4 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 8*x\n    print(f\"The curve is given by the equation y^2 = {f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Reduce the polynomial f(x) modulo 2.\n    # This is done by taking each coefficient modulo 2.\n    f_poly = sympy.Poly(f, x)\n    f_mod_2_coeffs = [c % 2 for c in f_poly.all_coeffs()]\n    f_mod_2 = sympy.Poly(f_mod_2_coeffs, x).as_expr()\n    \n    print(f\"Step 1: Reduce the polynomial modulo 2.\")\n    print(f\"f(x) mod 2 = {f_mod_2}\")\n    print(\"The reduced equation y^2 = x^2 is highly singular.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Rewrite f(x) based on the reduction.\n    # The reduction f(x) mod 2 = x^2 suggests g(x) = x.\n    # We check if f(x) can be written as g(x)^2 + 4k(x).\n    g = x\n    remainder = sympy.simplify(f - g**2)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: Rewrite the polynomial.\")\n    print(f\"We test the form f(x) = g(x)^2 + 4k(x) with g(x) = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"f(x) - g(x)^2 = {remainder}\")\n    \n    # Check if the remainder is divisible by 4\n    is_divisible_by_4 = all((c % 4) == 0 for c in sympy.Poly(remainder, x).all_coeffs())\n    if not is_divisible_by_4:\n        print(\"The remainder is not divisible by 4.
