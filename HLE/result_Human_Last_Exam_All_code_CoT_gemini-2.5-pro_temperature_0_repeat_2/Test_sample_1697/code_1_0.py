    This function identifies the product of a two-step organic reaction.

    Step 1: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide reacts with sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF.
    This is a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction. The strong base sec-BuLi,
    activated by TMEDA, deprotonates the most acidic proton on the aromatic ring.
    The N,N-diethylamide group (at C1) and the dimethylamino group (at C3) both
    direct the deprotonation to the C2 position. This forms a lithiated intermediate.

    Step 2: The intermediate reacts with methyl iodide (CH3I).
    The nucleophilic lithiated carbon at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group,
    substituting the lithium with a methyl group.
