    "To develop an analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime, we can use methods from asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** For small $\\epsilon$, the denominator $\\epsilon + g(x)$ (where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$) becomes small when $g(x)$ is small. For $x \\ge 0$, $g(x)$ is zero only at $x=0$. This means the main contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n2.  **Dominant Balance and Rescaling:** Near $x=0$, the term $9x^5$ is the dominant part of $g(x)$. We perform a change of variables to zoom into this region. Let's set the two small terms in the denominator to be of the same order: $\\epsilon \\sim 9x^5$. This suggests the scaling $x = (\\epsilon/9)^{1/5} u$.\n3.  **Asymptotic Expansion:** With this change of variables, the integral is transformed. The new integrand can be expanded as a series for small $\\epsilon$. The integration limits for the new variable $u$ can be extended to $[0, \\infty)$ with negligible error for small $\\epsilon$.\n4.  **Term-by-term Integration:** We integrate the first few terms of the expansion. These integrals are standard and can be evaluated using the Beta function, leading to an asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$. We will compute the first two terms of this series.\n5.  **Final Formula:** The resulting two-term formula, $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{e_1} + C_2 \\epsilon^{e_2}$, will be our analytical approximation. The Python code below will compute the numerical values for the coefficients ($C_1, C_2$) and exponents ($e_1, e_2$).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the coefficients and exponents for the approximation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients and exponents for the asymptotic approximation of the integral.\n    The integral is I(eps) = integral from 0 to 15 of 1 / (eps + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8) dx.\n    The approximation has the form I(eps) ~ C1 * eps^e1 + C2 * eps^e2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters from the denominator polynomial g(x) = p1*x^a + p2*x^b + p3*x^c\n    p1 = 9.0\n    a = 5.0\n    p2 = 5.0\n    b = 6.0\n    \n    # --- Exponent Calculation ---\n    # Exponent of the leading term\n    e1 = (1 - a) / a\n    # Exponent of the first correction term\n    e2 = (b - 2 * a + 1) / a\n    \n    # --- Coefficient Calculation ---\n    pi = math.pi\n    \n    # Coefficient of the leading term, C1\n    # C1 = p1^(-1/a) * integral_0^inf (1 / (1+u^a)) du\n    # The integral is pi / (a * sin(pi/a))\n    integral_1 = pi / (a * math.sin(pi / a))\n    C1 = (p1**(-1/a)) * integral_1\n    \n    # Coefficient of the second term, C2\n    # C2 = -p2 * p1^(-(b+1)/a) * integral_0^inf (u^b / (1+u^a)^2) du\n    # The integral can be shown to be ((b-a+1)/a) * integral_0^inf (u^(b-a) / (1+u^a)) du\n    # The second integral is pi / (a * sin(pi*(b-a+1)/a))\n    integral_2_part1 = (b - a + 1) / a\n    integral_2_part2 = pi / (a * math.sin(pi * (b - a + 1) / a))\n    integral_2 = integral_2_part1 * integral_2_part2\n    C2 = -p2 * (p1**(-(b + 1) / a)) * integral_2\n    \n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"The analytical approximation for I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(eps) = C1 * eps^e1 + C2 * eps^e2\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculated values for the constants:\")\n    print(f\"C1 = {C1}\")\n    print(f\"e1 = {e1}\")\n    print(f\"C2 = {C2}\")\n    print(f\"e2 = {e2}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal formula with numerical values:\")\n    # We need to output each number in the final equation.\n    # The '+' sign is handled by the sign of C2.\n    print(f\"I(eps) = {C1} * eps**({e1}) + ({C2}) * eps**({e2})\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) ~ (pi / (5 * 9^(1/5) * sin(pi/5))) * epsilon^(-4/5) - (2 * pi / (5 * 9^(7/5) * sin(2*pi/5))) * epsilon^(-3/5)>>>"
