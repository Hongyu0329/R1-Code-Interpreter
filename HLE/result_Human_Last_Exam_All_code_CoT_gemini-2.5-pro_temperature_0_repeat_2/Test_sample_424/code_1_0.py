    # Step 1: Define the problem
    # The planar set T is a union of a unit circle, five line segments, and a circular arc.
    # We are looking for the number of points p in T such that the complement of T \ {p}
    # in the plane (R^2) has 3 or more connected components.

    # Step 2: Analyze the topology of the set T
    # The set T is a connected graph embedded in the plane.
    # We can determine the number of connected components of its complement, R^2 \ T.
    # The graph has two fundamental cycles that define bounded regions (faces):
    # 1. A region F1 in the bottom-right, bounded by parts of the unit circle, a line segment,
    #    the larger circular arc, and another line segment.
    # 2. A region F2 which is the area inside the unit circle, excluding F1.
    # The rest of the plane is the unbounded component, C_out.
    # So, the complement R^2 \ T has k=3 connected components.
    
    k = 3
    print(f"Step 1: The complement of the original set T has k = {k} connected components.")

    # Step 3: Condition for the number of components to remain 3
    # For a locally connected set like T, removing a point p can only cause components of the
    # complement to merge, thus reducing the number of components or keeping it the same.
    # The number of components of R^2 \ (T \ {p}) will be >= 3 only if it is exactly 3.
    # This happens if and only if the point p is on the boundary of exactly one of the
    # k=3 components of R^2 \ T.
    
    print("Step 2: To keep the number of components at 3, the removed point 'p' must be on the boundary of only one component.")

    # Step 4: Interpreting the question
    # The set of all points on the "antennae" of the graph T satisfy this condition, which is an infinite set.
    # Since the question asks for "how many points", it implies a finite count.
    # This suggests we should count the 'special' points of the figure, which are the vertices
    # of the graph representation of T.
    
    print("Step 3: The question asks for a finite number, so we count the vertices satisfying the condition.")

    # Step 5: Identify the vertices that border only one component.
    # These are the endpoints of the line segments that are not at a junction with another part of the set.
    # These points are 'dead ends' of the graph T.
    # Let's list them:
    
    points = {
        "p1": ("(0, 3/2)", "endpoint of the top vertical segment"),
        "p2": ("(-3/2, 0)", "endpoint of the left horizontal segment"),
        "p3": ("(-1/2, 1)", "left endpoint of the top horizontal segment"),
        "p4": ("(1/2, 1)", "right endpoint of the top horizontal segment"),
        "p5": ("(0, 1/2)", "inner endpoint of the top vertical segment"),
        "p6": ("(1/2, 0)", "inner endpoint of the right horizontal segment"),
        "p7": ("(-1/2, 0)", "inner endpoint of the left horizontal segment"),
        "p8": ("(0, -1/2)", "inner endpoint of the bottom vertical segment")
    }
    
    print("\nStep 4: The vertices that lie on the boundary of only one component are the endpoints of the 'antennae':")
    for name, (coord, desc) in points.items():
        print(f"- Point {name}: {coord}, the {desc}.")

    # Step 6: Count these points.
    count = len(points)
    
    print(f"\nStep 5: Counting these points.")
    equation_parts = ["1" for _ in points]
    equation_str = " + ".join(equation_parts)
    print(f"The total number of such points is {equation_str} = {count}.")
    
    # Final Answer
    # The problem asks for the number of such points.
    # Our analysis shows there are 8 such vertices.
