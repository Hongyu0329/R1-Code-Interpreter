def solve_balloon_radius():
    """
    Solves the given differential equation for the balloon radius y(t) at t=pi/4.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. The ODE is a second-order linear homogeneous equation, but it's singular at t=0.
    2. Standard numerical solvers cannot start at the singularity.
    3. We find an approximate series solution for small t>0 to provide initial conditions 
       for the solver at a starting point t_start near 0.
    4. Analysis of the ODE near t=0 shows the solution behaves as y(t) ~ y(0)*(1 + t^(3/2)/6)
       to satisfy the initial conditions y(0)=const and y'(0)=0.
    5. This series is used to calculate y(t_start) and y'(t_start).
    6. A high-precision numerical solver (scipy.integrate.solve_ivp) is then used to 
       integrate the ODE from t_start to the target time t=pi/4.
    7. The final value y(pi/4) is printed.
