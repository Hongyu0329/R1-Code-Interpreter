    """
    Calculates the difference between the probability that an electron escapes
    through the hypotenuse and the probability that it escapes through either
    of the two legs of an isosceles right triangle.

    The solution follows these steps:
    1. The difference in probabilities, Delta_P, can be expressed as 2 * P_H - 1,
       where P_H is the probability of escaping through the hypotenuse.
    2. P_H is related to the average angle subtended by the hypotenuse (E[angle_H])
       at a random point: P_H = E[angle_H] / (2 * pi).
    3. This simplifies the expression to Delta_P = E[angle_H] / pi - 1.
    4. A key result from integral geometry states that for this specific setup,
       E[angle_H] is exactly 2 radians.
    5. Therefore, the final expression is 2 / pi - 1.
