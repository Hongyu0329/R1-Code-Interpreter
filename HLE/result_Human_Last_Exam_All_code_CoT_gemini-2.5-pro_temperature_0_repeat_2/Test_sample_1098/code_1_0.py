    explanation = """
The thought experiment described is a physical version of "Maxwell's demon," which uses a one-way door acting as a Brownian ratchet.

1.  **The Second Law of Thermodynamics:** In an isolated system at a uniform temperature (thermal equilibrium), entropy (a measure of disorder) cannot decrease. A device that sorts gas molecules to one side would be decreasing entropy.

2.  **The Problem at a Single Temperature:** If the entire apparatus, including the gas in both chambers and the door mechanism itself, is at one constant temperature, it will not work. The reason is that the door and its latch are also made of atoms and are subject to the same random thermal motion (Brownian motion) as the gas. The thermal jiggling of the latch will cause it to fail randomly, allowing gas molecules to pass back to the original side. At thermal equilibrium, the rate of molecules passing forward is exactly balanced by the rate of molecules passing backward.

3.  **The Solution - Breaking Equilibrium:** To make the device work and trap gas on one side, you must break the thermal equilibrium. This requires a temperature difference. For example, if one chamber is heated to a higher temperature than the other, the molecules in the hot chamber will have more kinetic energy. They will strike the door more often and more forcefully, creating a net flow of gas to the colder chamber. This process uses a flow of heat from a hot source to a cold sink to perform work (compressing the gas), which is how a heat engine operates and is fully consistent with the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

4.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, the essential experimental parameter required to drive the process and accumulate all the gas on one side is Temperature (specifically, a temperature difference).
