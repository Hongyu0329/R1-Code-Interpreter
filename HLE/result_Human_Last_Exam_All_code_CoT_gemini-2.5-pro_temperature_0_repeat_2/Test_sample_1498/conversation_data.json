    "The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned in a specific section. The plan is to identify the starting and ending verse (bayt) numbers for this list and then use a Python script to present this information clearly.\n\n1.  **Identify the starting verse:** The poem introduces the list of 25 prophets in bayt 29, but the names themselves begin in the following verse. Bayt 30 starts with \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيْسُ نُوْحٌ هُوْدُ مَعْ...\" (They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with...). Therefore, the starting bayt is 30.\n2.  **Identify the ending verse:** The list continues through several verses, concluding with the mention of Prophet Muhammad (referred to as Taha). Bayt 35 reads \"عِيْسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ...\" ('Isa and Taha, the seal...). This is the final verse that contains names from the list of 25 prophets.\n3.  **Create the script:** A Python script will be written to state these two numbers, clearly indicating the range.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophet_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that mention the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The verse where the list of Prophets' names begins\n    start_bayt = 30\n\n    # The verse where the list of Prophets' names ends\n    end_bayt = 35\n\n    print(\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets are mentioned from:\")\n    print(f\"Bayt (verse) number: {start_bayt}\")\n    print(\"to\")\n    print(f\"Bayt (verse) number: {end_bayt}\")\n\nfind_prophet_verses()\n```\n<<<30-35>>>"
