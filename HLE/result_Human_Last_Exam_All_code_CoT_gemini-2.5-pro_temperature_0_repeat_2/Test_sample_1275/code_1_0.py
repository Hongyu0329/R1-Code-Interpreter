    # Answer for question A
    # A rational set K can be finite, e.g., K = {t} where t is a torsion element.
    # Then t is in alpha(K), but any word for t is not a quasigeodesic.
    # Therefore, not every geodesic word for an element in alpha(K) is fully quasireduced.
    answer_A = "No"

    # Answer for question B
    # Assuming alpha(K) contains loxodromic elements, a result by Papasoglu
    # provides a uniform bound for a (1, epsilon)-quasigeodesic word.
    # The bound is given in terms of the asynchronous fellow-travel constant R.
    # The equation for the bound is: bound = 2 * R.
    # The number in this equation is 2.
    constant_in_bound = 2

    answer_B = f"{constant_in_bound}*{variable_in_bound}"

    # Answer for question C
    # A context-free set K can be the set containing only the identity, K = {1}.
    # Then alpha(K) = {1}. The identity element is not represented by a quasigeodesic word.
    # Therefore, alpha(K) does not contain only quasigeodesic words.
