    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N**: A primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$.\n2.  **Analyze the order condition**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_{p^a}$. For the order to be 6, the order of each component must divide 6, and the set of orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n3.  **Count valid components**: For each prime power factor $p^a$, we will count the number of primitive characters modulo $p^a$ whose order divides 6.\n4.  **Calculate the total**: We will show that for any combination of such components, the resulting character's order is exactly 6. The total number is then the product of the counts from the previous step.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan and calculates the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function, phi(n), which counts the number of\n    positive integers up to a given integer n that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order 6.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Factorize the conductor N.\")\n    # N = 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13\n    print(f\"The prime factorization of N = {N} is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\")\n    print(\"A primitive character chi mod N can be uniquely decomposed as a product:\")\n    print(\"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13\")\n    print(\"where each chi_{p^a} is a primitive character modulo the prime power factor p^a.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the order condition.\")\n    print(\"The order of chi is lcm(ord(chi_4), ord(chi_9), ord(chi_7), ord(chi_11), ord(chi_13)).\")\n    print(\"For the order to be 6, the order of each component chi_{p^a} must divide 6.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Count the number of valid primitive components for each prime power factor.\")\n    \n    # Conductor 4 = 2^2\n    print(\"\\nFor conductor 4 (2^2):\")\n    num_prim_chars_4 = phi(4) - phi(2)\n    print(f\"The number of primitive characters is phi(4) - phi(2) = {phi(4)} - {phi(2)} = {num_prim_chars_4}.\")\n    print(\"This character has order 2.
