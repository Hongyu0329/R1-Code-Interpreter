    Calculates the exposure time required to measure a star's magnitude to a
    given accuracy.

    This function follows these steps:
    1. Determines the required Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) from the magnitude error.
    2. Calculates the total number of photons (N) needed, as N = SNR^2.
    3. Calculates the expected photon flux from the star based on its magnitude.
    4. Calculates the photon collection rate of the telescope.
    5. Divides the total photons needed by the collection rate to find the exposure time.
