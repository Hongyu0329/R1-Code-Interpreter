    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Product Term**: The general term in the product is $\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. I will factor this expression using the difference of cubes formula and the complex cube roots of unity, $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $\\omega^2 = e^{i4\\pi/3}$. This gives $\\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega z}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega^2 z}{n}\\right)$.\n\n2.  **Use the Gamma Function Product Formula**: The infinite product can be related to the Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function, which states that $\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{-\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right) e^{x/n}$. By combining three such products for $x=z$, $x=\\omega z$, and $x=\\omega^2 z$, the exponential terms cancel out (since $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$), leading to a concise formula for the product from $n=1$ to $\\infty$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega z)\\Gamma(1-\\omega^2 z)} $$\n\n3.  **Adjust the Starting Index**: The problem asks for the product starting from $n=3$. I will obtain this by taking the result from step 2 (the product from $n=1$) and dividing out the terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$.\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code**: I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to define this final symbolic expression. The script will print the result in a clear, readable format that explicitly shows the numbers involved in the calculation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to generate the solution:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import I, pi, exp, gamma, sstr, Symbol\n\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the symbolic expression for the infinite product\n    Product_{n=3 to oo} (1 - z^3/n^3) and prints the resulting formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable z\n    z = Symbol('z')\n\n    # The infinite product from n=1 to infinity is related to the Gamma function.\n    # The formula is: Prod_{n=1 to inf} (1 - z^3/n^3) = 1 / P_gamma\n    # where P_gamma = gamma(1-z) * gamma(1-omega*z) * gamma(1-omega^2*z)\n    # and omega = exp(I*2*pi/3) is a complex cube root of unity.\n    omega = exp(I * 2 * pi / 3)\n    gamma_product = gamma(1 - z) * gamma(1 - omega * z) * gamma(1 - omega**2 * z)\n\n    # The product in the question starts from n=3.\n    # We must divide the full product by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    n_1 = 1\n    term_n1 = (1 - z**3 / n_1**3)\n\n    n_2 = 2\n    term_n2 = (1 - z**3 / n_2**3)\n\n    # The final expression is 1 divided by the product of the gamma terms and the first two terms.\n    final_expression = 1 / (term_n1 * term_n2 * gamma_product)\n\n    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n    # We will print the final formula, showing the numbers 1 and 2 from the excluded terms.\n    # The starting index 3 is from the problem statement.\n    \n    print(\"The final expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    # We use sstr for a compact string representation of the sympy expression.\n    # The numbers 1 and 2 are explicitly shown in the denominator.\n    print(f\"1 / ( (1 - z**3/{n_1}**3) * (1 - z**3/{n_2}**3) * {sstr(gamma_product)} )\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the result\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<1 / ( (1 - z**3/1**3) * (1 - z**3/2**3) * gamma(1 - z)*gamma(1 - z*exp(2*I*pi/3))*gamma(1 - z*exp(4*I*pi/3)) )>>>"
