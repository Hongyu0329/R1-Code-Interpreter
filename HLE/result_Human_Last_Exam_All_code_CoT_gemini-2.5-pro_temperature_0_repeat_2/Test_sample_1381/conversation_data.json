    "An equilibrium point of the system is a set of abundances `X^* = (X_1^*, ..., X_N^*)` where `\\dot{X_i} = 0` for all `i=1, ..., N`. The abundances must also be non-negative, `X_i^* \\geq 0`.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of possible equilibria:\n\n1.  **Set up the equilibrium equations:** For each species `i`, the condition `\\dot{X_i} = 0` implies:\n    `R_i X_i^* [ (1 - \\frac{X_i^*}{K_i}) + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^N (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* ] = 0`\n    This means that for each species `i`, either `X_i^* = 0` (the species is extinct) or the term in the square brackets is zero.\n\n2.  **Characterize equilibria by subsets:** An equilibrium is uniquely defined by the subset of species `C` that have positive abundance (`X_i^* > 0`). For any of the `2^N` subsets of the `N` species, we need to check if a corresponding equilibrium can exist.\n\n3.  **Solve for the equilibrium abundances:** For a given subset of coexisting species `C`, the abundances `X_i^*` for `i \\in C` are determined by the system of equations:\n    `1 - \\frac{X_i^*}{K_i} + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j \\in C} (A_i - A_j) R_j X_j^* = 0`\n    This system can be solved and, as shown through algebraic manipulation in the thought process, leads to a unique potential solution for the `X_i^*` values.\n\n4.  **Check the positivity condition:** For the potential solution to be a valid equilibrium, we must have `X_i^* > 0` for all `i \\in C`. This condition simplifies to the following system of inequalities:\n    `1 + \\frac{\\Gamma}{N} \\sum\\limits_{j \\in C} (A_i - A_j) R_j K_j > 0` for every `i \\in C`.\n\n5.  **Verify feasibility by varying parameters:** The question is whether for any chosen subset `C`, we can find parameters (`R_i, K_i, A_i, \\Gamma \\geq 1`) that satisfy these inequalities. We can show this is always possible. For instance, by choosing all `A_i` values to be very close to each other (e.g., `A_i = 1 + \\epsilon \\cdot i` for a very small `\\epsilon`), the term `(A_i - A_j)` becomes very small. This makes the entire summation term approach zero, and the inequalities simplify to `1 > 0`, which is always true.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since we can find parameters to make the equilibrium abundances positive for any of the `2^N` possible subsets of species, there can be `2^N` distinct equilibria, each corresponding to a unique combination of surviving species.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this number for a given `N`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_equilibria(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of possible equilibria for the generalized Lotka-Volterra system.\n\n    Args:\n        N (int): The number of species in the system.

Prints the result to the console.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(N, int) or N < 0:\n        print(\"Error: N must be a non-negative integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # The number of possible equilibria is 2^N, as each species can either be\n    # present or absent in an equilibrium state.\n    num_equilibria = 2**N\n    \n    # We use math.pow to ensure the result is handled as a float for large N if needed,\n    # though 2**N with integers is fine in Python.\n    result = int(math.pow(2, N))\n\n    print(f\"For a system with N = {N} species:\")\n    # The final equation is Number of Equilibria = 2^N\n    # We output each number/symbol in this equation.\n    print(f\"The number of possible equilibria is 2^{N} = {result}\")\n\n# Example: Calculate the number of equilibria for a system with 10 species.\nN_species = 10\ncalculate_equilibria(N_species)\n```\n<<<2**N>>>"
