    # 2. The risk is of imminent death or serious bodily harm.
    # 3. Disclosure is necessary to prevent the harm.
    # 4. The lawyer does not disclose more information than is required.

    # Analysis of Conditions
    condition_1_met = True  # Specific threat provides reasonable grounds.
    condition_2_met = True  # "Tonight" is imminent; "end things" with a gun is serious.
    condition_3_met = True  # Contacting police is necessary to prevent the harm.
    condition_4_met = True  # Arguably, all info (including vacation homes) could be required by police to locate the client urgently.

    # Evaluating the options
    # A: Incorrect, threat was imminent.
    # B: Incorrect, public safety exception exists.
    # C: Incorrect, the information disclosed can be reasonably argued as necessary for the police to act.
    # D: Incorrect, disclosure is permitted ('may'), not mandatory ('must').
    # E: Correct, this aligns with the analysis that all conditions for the public safety exception were met.
