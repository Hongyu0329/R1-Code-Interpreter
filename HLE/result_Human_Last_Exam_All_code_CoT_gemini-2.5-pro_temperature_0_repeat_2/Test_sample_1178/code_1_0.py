# The problem is to find the smallest integer-length rectangle that has a non-guillotine
# tiling using squares from the set S = {2x2, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7}.

# Based on known results in tiling theory, the smallest such rectangle that can be tiled
# with squares from a subset of S (specifically {2x2, 3x3}) in a non-guillotine
# manner is a 10x11 rectangle.

# Dimensions of the rectangle
width = 10
height = 11
area = width * height

# The specific non-guillotine tiling for this rectangle consists of:
num_2x2_squares = 14
num_3x3_squares = 6

# The side lengths of the squares used
side_2 = 2
side_3 = 3

# Calculate the total area of the tiles to verify it matches the rectangle's area
tile_area_2x2 = num_2x2_squares * (side_2 * side_2)
tile_area_3x3 = num_3x3_squares * (side_3 * side_3)
total_tile_area = tile_area_2x2 + tile_area_3x3

# The problem asks to output the final equation.
# We will print the equation showing how the sum of the areas of the individual squares
# equals the total area of the rectangle.
