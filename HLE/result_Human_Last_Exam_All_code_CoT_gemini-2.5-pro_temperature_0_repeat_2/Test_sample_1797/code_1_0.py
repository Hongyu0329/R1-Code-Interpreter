    Analyzes the statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect ones.
    
    A. Correct. Describes the basic graph structure and analysis methods.
    B. Correct. Accurately describes the state explosion problem.
    C. Correct. The problem is computationally hard (at least NP-hard), making this statement accurate.
    D. Correct. Addresses the need for dynamic updates in real-world scenarios.
    E. Correct. Formal verification using model checking is a valid application.
    
    Since all statements are correct, the answer is 'N'.
