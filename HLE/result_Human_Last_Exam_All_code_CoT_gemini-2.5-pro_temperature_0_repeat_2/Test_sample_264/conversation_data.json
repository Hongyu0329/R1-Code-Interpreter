    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Model the Cubes:** I'll place the first cube (Cube A) in a standard position in a 3D coordinate system. The most convenient position is with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and extending to (1,1,1). This means Cube A occupies the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift:** The \"main diagonal\" of this cube connects the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite corner (1,1,1). A shift \"by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is most naturally interpreted as a displacement by the vector `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. Therefore, the second cube (Cube B) will occupy the space where `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n3.  **Find the Intersection:** The intersection is the region of space that belongs to *both* Cube A and Cube B. I will find the boundaries of this region by finding the overlapping range for each coordinate (x, y, and z).\n    *   For the x-coordinate, the overlap is between `max(0, 1/2)` and `min(1, 3/2)`, which is the range `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   The same logic applies to the y and z coordinates.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Volume:** The resulting intersection is a smaller cube. I will calculate its side length from the ranges found in the previous step. The volume is simply the side length of this intersection cube raised to the power of 3.\n\n5.  **Generate the Code:** I will write a Python script that performs this calculation and prints out the final equation with all the numbers, as you requested.\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters of the problem\noriginal_side_length = 1.0\nshift_along_axis = 0.5\n\n# The intersection of the two cubes forms a new, smaller cube.\n# Its side length is the difference between the original side length and the shift.\nintersection_side_length = original_side_length - shift_along_axis\n\n# The volume of a cube is its side length cubed.\nvolume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers.\nprint(\"The intersection of the two cubes forms a smaller cube.\")\nprint(f\"The side length of this intersection cube is the original side length minus the shift: {original_side_length} - {shift_along_axis} = {intersection_side_length}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe volume is the cube of this new side length.\")\nprint(f\"Volume = ({intersection_side_length}) ^ 3\")\nprint(f\"So, the final equation is: Volume = {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} = {volume}\")\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
