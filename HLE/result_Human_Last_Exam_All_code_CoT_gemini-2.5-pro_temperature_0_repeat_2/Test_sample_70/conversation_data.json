    "To identify the flags of African nations that share the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first determine the rank of the Danish flag and then find African flags with a matching rank structure.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Danish Flag:** The flag of Denmark features a white Nordic cross on a red background. If we represent this flag as a matrix, its design is composed of two distinct types of rows: rows that are all white (for the horizontal bar of the cross) and rows that are red and white (for the parts of the flag above and below the horizontal bar). The problem states to assume maximal rank, meaning we choose numerical values for the colors such that they are linearly independent. With two linearly independent row patterns, the rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify Criteria for Rank 2 Flags:** We need to find African flags whose geometric patterns also result in exactly two linearly independent row or column vectors. This typically occurs in flags with very simple designs, such as:\n    *   A triband flag where the outer bands are the same color (e.g., A-B-A pattern).\n    *   A flag composed of two distinct sections, creating two unique row or column patterns.\n\n3.  **Analyze Flags of African Nations:**\n    *   Most tricolor flags (e.g., Gabon, Senegal) have three distinct patterns, giving them a rank of 3.\n    *   Flags with central emblems or complex patterns (e.g., Kenya, Somalia, Angola) introduce additional unique rows/columns, resulting in a rank of 3 or higher.\n    *   The search reveals three flags that fit the rank-2 structure:\n        *   **Nigeria:** A vertical green-white-green triband. This has only two unique column patterns (a green column and a white column), giving it a rank of 2.\n        *   **Benin:** A design with a vertical green stripe at the hoist and two horizontal stripes (yellow and red) on the fly. This creates exactly two unique row patterns: `[Green, Yellow, ...]` and `[Green, Red, ...]`. These two patterns are linearly independent, resulting in a rank of 2.\n        *   **Madagascar:** A similar design to Benin, with a vertical white stripe and two horizontal stripes (red and green). This also creates two unique, linearly independent row patterns, giving it a rank of 2.\n\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** The following Python script will print the names of these countries. To adhere to the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the code will also print the simple equation `rank(Country) = 2` for each qualifying nation, demonstrating that their rank is equal to that of Denmark.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies African nations whose flags have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n    The rank of the Danish flag is 2. We look for African flags that are also rank 2.\n    This occurs when a flag's design is composed of exactly two linearly independent row or column patterns.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The rank of the Danish flag is 2.

The number is 2.\n        print(f\"rank({country}) = {denmark_rank}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal list of countries:\")\n    for country in rank_2_african_flags:\n        print(country)\n\nsolve_flag_rank()\n```\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, Nigeria>>>"
