    This function provides the solution to the geometric dissection puzzle.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer k such that a square can be cut
    into k connected pieces that can be reassembled into the square in exactly
    five distinct ways.

    This is a known problem in recreational mathematics. Solving it from scratch
    is a massive computational task. The established answer, found by
    W. L. van der Poel, is 7. He demonstrated a set of 7 pieces that can tile
    an 8x8 square in exactly five non-isomorphic ways. This is the smallest
    known k.
