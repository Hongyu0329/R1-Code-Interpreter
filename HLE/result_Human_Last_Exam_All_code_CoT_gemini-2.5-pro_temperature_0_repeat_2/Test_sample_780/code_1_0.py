    Solves the problem by finding the value of S(N) mod p.

    The problem asks for the number of colorings S(n) of a 2xn rectangle with 510 colors,
    with the constraint that no 2x3 subgrid is monochromatic with one of the first 203 colors.
    We need to find S(N) mod p where N = 23626 * (23628^100 - 23628^50) and p = 23627.

    Step 1: Recurrence Relation
    Let T = 510 be the total number of colors.
    Let B = 203 be the number of "bad" colors.
    Let S(n) be the number of valid colorings for a 2xn rectangle.
    Through a state-based analysis (states depending on the coloring of the last columns),
    we can derive a linear recurrence relation for S(n):
    S(n) = (T^2 - 1) * S(n-1) + (T^2 - 1) * S(n-2) + (T^2 - B) * S(n-3)
    with initial values S(0) = 1, S(1) = T^2, S(2) = T^4.

    Step 2: Recurrence Modulo p
    We need to compute everything modulo p = 23627.
    Let's compute the coefficients of the recurrence modulo p.
    T = 510
    B = 203
    p = 23627

    T^2 - B = 510^2 - 203 = 260100 - 203 = 259897.
    259897 / 23627 = 11.
    So, T^2 - B is a multiple of p, which means T^2 - B = 0 (mod p).

    This simplifies the recurrence significantly.
    T^2 = B (mod p) => 510^2 = 203 (mod 23627).
    The coefficient T^2 - 1 becomes B - 1 (mod p).
    The recurrence for n >= 3 becomes:
    S(n) = (B - 1) * S(n-1) + (B - 1) * S(n-2) (mod p).

    Step 3: Analyze the argument N
    N = 23626 * (23628^100 - 23628^50).
    Let p = 23627.
    N = (p - 1) * ((p + 1)^100 - (p + 1)^50).
    The characteristic polynomial of the simplified recurrence is x^2 - (B-1)x - (B-1) = 0.
    The roots of this polynomial are in the finite field F_{p^2}.
    The period of the sequence generated by this recurrence divides p^2 - 1.
    N is a multiple of p-1 and p+1, so N is a multiple of (p-1)(p+1) = p^2 - 1.
    Therefore, N is a multiple of the period of the sequence S(n) for n >= 1.

    Step 4: Calculate the final value
    Let the sequence be a_n = S(n+1) for n >= 0.
    a_0 = S(1) = T^2 = B (mod p).
    a_1 = S(2) = T^4 = B^2 (mod p).
    The recurrence a_n = (B-1)a_{n-1} + (B-1)a_{n-2} holds for n >= 2.
    We need to compute S(N) = a_{N-1}.
    Since N is a multiple of the period, a_{N-1} = a_{-1} (mod p).
    We can find a_{-1} by running the recurrence backward:
    a_1 = (B-1)a_0 + (B-1)a_{-1}
    B^2 = (B-1)B + (B-1)a_{-1}
    B^2 = B^2 - B + (B-1)a_{-1}
    B = (B-1)a_{-1}
    a_{-1} = B * (B-1)^-1 (mod p).

    This is the value we need to compute.
