# Plan:
# 1. The problem asks for the average value of the complex coordinates z
#    where the inverse of the gradient of S(z) approaches zero. This is equivalent
#    to finding the average of the coordinates of the poles of the gradient of S(z).
# 2. The poles of the gradient of S(z) are the poles of the functions E(z) and B(z).
# 3. We will find the sum and number of poles for E(z) and B(z) based on their governing equations.

# Poles of E(z)
# The equation for E(z) involves transformations w1(z) and w2(z) which have poles at z=2 and z=1.
# We assume these are the poles of E(z).
poles_E = [1, 2]
num_poles_E = len(poles_E)
sum_poles_E = sum(poles_E)

# Poles of B(z)
# The equation for B(z) has a right-hand side with a denominator 4*z**4 - z**3 + z**2 + 1.
# The poles of the RHS are the roots of this polynomial.
# Let P1(z) = 4*z**4 - z**3 + z**2 + 1.
# By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of P1(z) is -(-1)/4 = 1/4.
num_poles_B1 = 4
sum_poles_B1 = 1/4

# The equation for B(z) also involves B(1/z), suggesting the full set of poles
# also includes the poles of the reciprocal term. The denominator of the reciprocal term is
# P2(z) = z**4 + z**2 - z + 4.
# By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of P2(z) is -(0)/1 = 0.
num_poles_B2 = 4
sum_poles_B2 = 0

# Total number and sum of poles for B(z)
num_poles_B = num_poles_B1 + num_poles_B2
sum_poles_B = sum_poles_B1 + sum_poles_B2

# Total number and sum of all poles
total_num_poles = num_poles_E + num_poles_B
total_sum_poles = sum_poles_E + sum_poles_B

# Calculate the average
average_z = total_sum_poles / total_num_poles

# Print the calculation step-by-step
