    This function determines the smallest possible size of the limit of a specific functor.

    The problem states:
    - J is a directed poset.
    - F is a functor from J^op to Set.
    - For every object j in J, F(j) is a non-empty set.
    - For every morphism in J^op, the corresponding map in Set is surjective.

    The limit, lim_{J^op} F, is the set of all "compatible families" of elements.
    A family (x_j)_{j in J} is compatible if for every j1 <= j2 in J,
    the map from F(j2) to F(j1) sends x_j2 to x_j1.
