    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A*sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B*sin(bt)`. Our curve has `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and a phase shift `δ` of `π/2` in the x-component (since `cos(θ) = sin(θ + π/2)`).\n\n2.  **Find the relevant formula:** For a Lissajous curve given by `x(t) = cos(nt)` and `y(t) = sin(mt)`, where `n` and `m` are coprime integers (their greatest common divisor is 1), there is a standard formula to calculate the number of self-intersection points.\n\n3.  **State the formula:** The number of self-intersection points, `N`, is given by:\n    `N = (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2`\n\n4.  **Apply the formula to the specific case:**\n    *   In our problem, `n = 9` and `m = 5`.\n    *   First, we check if they are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is `gcd(9, 5) = 1`, so they are coprime.\n    *   Now, we can plug these values into the formula.\n    *   `N = (9 - 1) * (5 - 1) / 2`\n    *   `N = 8 * 4 / 2`\n    *   `N = 32 / 2`\n    *   `N = 16`\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lissajous_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve\n    of the form (cos(nt), sin(mt)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the curve equations x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t)\n    n = 9\n    m = 5\n\n    # The formula for the number of self-intersections for coprime n and m is:\n    # N = (n - 1) * (m - 1) / 2\n    \n    # Check if n and m are coprime (greatest common divisor is 1)\n    # This is a precondition for the formula.\n    import math\n    if math.gcd(n, m) != 1:\n        print(f\"Error: n={n} and m={m} are not coprime.
