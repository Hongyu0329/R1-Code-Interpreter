# The problem simplifies to calculating the definite integral of u(x,y,-y,0) from x=0 to 1.
# The analytical solution to this integral is 3 * (ln(3) - ln(e^2 + e + 1)).

# Let's define the components of the final equation.
# The equation is of the form: A * (ln(B) - ln(C))
A = 3
B = 3
C = math.exp(2) + math.exp(1) + 1

# Calculate the final result
result = A * (math.log(B) - math.log(C))

# Print the breakdown of the final equation and the result
print("The analytical solution to the integral is of the form: A * (ln(B) - ln(C))")
print("The values for the final equation are:")
print(f"A = {A}")
print(f"B = {B}")
