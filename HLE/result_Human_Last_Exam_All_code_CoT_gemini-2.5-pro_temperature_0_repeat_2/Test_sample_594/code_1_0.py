# The user wants to identify the most unlikely effect from the given list.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis of sintering with gas evolution:
# A, B, C, E, and F are all likely, well-documented effects.
# D is unlikely because the high porosity in the interior, caused by trapped gas,
# would pin grain boundaries, leading to smaller, not larger, grain sizes compared to the denser surface.
# The pinning effect often outweighs any potential grain coarsening from vapor transport.

unlikely_effect = "D"
explanation = "Larger grain sizes in the interior of the part than near the part's surface. This is unlikely because the high concentration of pores in the interior (due to trapped gas) would pin grain boundaries, inhibiting grain growth. This typically results in smaller grains in the porous interior compared to the denser surface, where grains can grow more freely."
