    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the game's data, this is 3640.\n2.  Next, I will find the formula Terraria uses to scale boss health for additional players in Expert Mode. The health is increased by 35% for each player after the first.\n3.  The formula can be expressed as: `Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * 0.35)`.\n4.  The problem asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. As the \"NumberOfPlayers\" variable in the formula increases, the \"Total Health\" also increases without any upper limit. This is a linear relationship.\n5.  Therefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the boss's health also approaches infinity.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that defines the components of this formula and explains the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants from the Terraria health scaling formula for Expert Mode.\nbase_health = 3640\nhealth_increase_per_player = 0.35\n\n# The formula for total health is:\n# Total Health = base_health * (1 + (number_of_players - 1) * health_increase_per_player)\n\nprint(\"The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode is based on the number of players.\")\nprint(\"Final Health = Base Health * (1 + (Number of Players - 1) * Health Increase per Player)\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the numbers in that final equation:\")\nprint(f\"Base Health: {base_health}\")\nprint(f\"Constant '1': 1\")\nprint(f\"Constant '-1': -1\")\nprint(f\"Health Increase per Player: {health_increase_per_player}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nSince the 'Number of Players' can theoretically be infinite, and the health scales linearly with it,\")\nprint(\"the theoretical maximum health is also infinite. There is no cap on this scaling in the game's code.\")\n\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
