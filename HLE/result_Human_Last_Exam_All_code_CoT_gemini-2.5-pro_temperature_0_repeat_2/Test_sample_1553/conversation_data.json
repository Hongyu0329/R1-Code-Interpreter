    "My plan is to first identify the main character of the novel \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" and then find the name of the character they marry within the story's plot. I will then create a simple Python script to store this name in a variable and print it as the output.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the name of the character\n# that the protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" marries.\n\n# The name of the character is stored in a variable.\ncharacter_name = \"Angelina\"\n\n# Print the name to the console.\nprint(character_name)\n```\n<<<Angelina>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
