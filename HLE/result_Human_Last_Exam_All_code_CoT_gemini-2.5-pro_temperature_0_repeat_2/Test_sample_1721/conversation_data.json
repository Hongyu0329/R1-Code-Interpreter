    "To solve this problem, we are looking for the largest constant `c` representing the density of a set `A \\subseteq \\{1, ..., N\\}` whose sumset `A+A` contains no square numbers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Strategy**: We will use modular arithmetic to construct the set `A`. We choose a modulus `m` and define `A` as the set of numbers `n \\in \\{1, ..., N\\}` whose residues modulo `m` fall into a specific set `R`. That is, `A = {n | n \\pmod m \\in R}`. The density of such a set `A` is `|A|/N`, which approaches `|R|/m` as `N` grows large.\n\n2.  **Condition**: The condition that `A+A` contains no squares means that for any `a, b \\in A`, `a+b` is not a perfect square. If we choose `R` such that the sumset `R+R = {r_1 + r_2 \\pmod m | r_1, r_2 \\in R}` has no elements in common with the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`, `S_m = {k^2 \\pmod m}`, then the condition on `A+A` is satisfied.\n\n3.  **Optimization**: The problem is now to find `\\max_{m, R} \\frac{|R|}{m}` subject to the condition `(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset`. For a given `m`, finding the largest `R` is a computationally intensive task, equivalent to finding the maximum clique in a specially constructed graph.\n\n4.  **Implementation**: The Python code below will perform a search over various moduli `m`. For each `m`, it will:\n    a. Determine the set of quadratic residues `S_m`.\n    b. Identify candidate elements for `R`.\n    c. Construct a \"compatibility graph\" where an edge exists between two candidates if their sum is not a quadratic residue.\n    d. Find the size of the largest clique in this graph, which corresponds to the size of the largest valid set `R`. This is done using a recursive backtracking algorithm with memoization.\n    e. Keep track of the best density `|R|/m` found.\n\nThis computational approach will provide strong evidence for the value of `c`. The result from the code, combined with a theoretical argument (for example, by analyzing the case `m=3`), allows us to determine the largest possible value for `c`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nmemo_clique = {}\nadj_map = {}\nm_current = 0\n\ndef find_max_clique_set(P):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum clique in the graph defined on the vertex set P.\n    Uses recursion with memoization.\n    The graph's adjacency information is stored in the global `adj_map`.\n    \"\"\"\n    # P must be a tuple for memoization key\n    P_tuple = tuple(sorted(P))\n    if not P:\n        return []\n    if P_tuple in memo_clique:\n        return memo_clique[P_tuple]\n\n    # Simple pivot selection\n    v = P[0]\n    \n    # Neighbors of v within the current candidate set P\n    neighbors_of_v_in_P = [p for p in P[1:] if p in adj_map[v]]\n\n    # Case 1: Max clique includes v\n    clique1 = [v] + find_max_clique_set(neighbors_of_v_in_P)\n    \n    # Case 2: Max clique does not include v\n    clique2 = find_max_clique_set(P[1:])\n    \n    # Return the larger of the two cliques\n    result = clique1 if len(clique1) > len(clique2) else clique2\n    memo_clique[P_tuple] = result\n    return result\n\ndef solve_for_m(m):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given modulus m, finds the largest set R and the corresponding density.\n    \"\"\"\n    global memo_clique, adj_map, m_current\n    \n    # Reset memoization cache for each new m\n    if m != m_current:\n        memo_clique = {}\n        m_current = m\n\n    # S_m: set of quadratic residues modulo m\n    S_m = {pow(k, 2, m) for k in range(m)}\n    # U_m: set of non-quadratic residues (where sums are allowed)\n    U_m = {i for i in range(m) if i not in S_m}\n    \n    # Candidates for R are residues r such that 2r is not a quadratic residue.\n    # This is because if r is in R, r+r must not be a square.\n    candidates = [r for r in range(m) if (2 * r) % m in U_m]\n    \n    if not candidates:\n        return 0, []\n        \n    # Build the compatibility graph for the candidates\n    # An edge (u,v) exists if u+v is not a quadratic residue\n    adj_map = {c: {c2 for c2 in candidates if (c + c2) % m in U_m} for c in candidates}\n\n    max_R = find_max_clique_set(candidates)\n    return len(max_R), max_R\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to iterate through moduli and find the best density.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_density = 0.0\n    best_m_overall = 0\n    best_R_overall = []\n    \n    # Set a reasonable limit for m to search\n    M_LIMIT = 36\n    print(f\"Searching for best density c = |R|/m for m up to {M_LIMIT}...\\n\")\n    \n    for m in range(2, M_LIMIT + 1):\n        size, R = solve_for_m(m)\n        if m > 0 and size > 0:\n            density = size / m\n            print(f\"m = {m:2d}: |R| = {size:2d}, density = {density:.4f}, R = {sorted(R)}\")\n            \n            # Using a small tolerance for float comparison\n            if density > max_density + 1e-9:\n                max_density = density\n                best_m_overall = m\n                best_R_overall = R\n            # If densities are equal, prefer the one with smaller m\n            elif abs(density - max_density) < 1e-9:\n                if m < best_m_overall:\n                    best_m_overall = m\n                    best_R_overall = R\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Best Result Found ---\")\n    final_R_size = len(best_R_overall)\n    final_m = best_m_overall\n    final_density = final_R_size / final_m if final_m > 0 else 0\n    \n    print(f\"The final equation is c = |R| / m\")\n    print(f\"The best value found is c = {final_R_size} / {final_m}\")\n    print(f\"This gives a density of c = {final_density:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"Achieved with modulus m = {final_m} and the set of residues R = {sorted(best_R_overall)}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n<<<1/3>>>"
