    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question of historical linguistics.\n\nMy plan is to trace the etymology of the modern word \"sister\" to identify the point where it was influenced by the Norse language. Then, I will identify the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word and project its natural evolution into Modern English by applying known sound changes, assuming the Norse influence never happened. The Python code below will walk through this process and print the final, hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be\n    without the influence of the Old Norse language from Viking invasions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. The current word \"sister\" comes from Middle English \"sister\", which was\n    #    heavily influenced by, and largely replaced, the native word due to the\n    #    Old Norse cognate \"systir\".\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n\n    # 2. The original, native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was \"sweostor\".\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    # 3. To find the modern equivalent, we trace the likely evolution of \"sweostor\"\n    #    through Middle English to Modern English.\n\n    #    - From Old English to Middle English: The 'eo' sound in 'sweostor'\n    #      would typically simplify to a short 'e' sound. The unstressed 'o' in the\n    #      second syllable would also reduce to an 'e'.\n    #      This gives us the Middle English form \"swester\". This form actually\n    #      existed and was used alongside \"sister\".\n    middle_english_word = \"swester\"\n\n    #    - From Middle English to Modern English: The short 'e' vowel in \"swester\"\n    #      would have been stable and not undergone the Great Vowel Shift in the\n    #      same way a long vowel would have. Its pronunciation would remain,\n    #      similar to the evolution of \"fether\" to \"feather\".\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n\n    print(f\"The original Old English word was: '{old_english_word}'\")\n    print(f\"It was replaced by the Old Norse-influenced word: '{current_word}' (from O.N. '{old_norse_word}')\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Without Norse influence, the native word would have evolved as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Old English '{old_english_word}' -> Middle English '{middle_english_word}' -> Modern English '{hypothetical_modern_word}'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Therefore, the Modern English word for 'sister' would likely be: {hypothetical_modern_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
