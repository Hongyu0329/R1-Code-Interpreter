    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of `tan(10^100)`, we need to perform a high-precision calculation. Standard floating-point arithmetic is insufficient due to the immense size of the input value.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The number `10^100` (a 1 followed by 100 zeros) is far too large for standard computer floating-point types. We will use Python's `mpmath` library, which is designed for arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic. You may need to install it first (`pip install mpmath`).\n2.  The `tan(x)` function is periodic with a period of `π`. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. To calculate the value accurately, the library must first find the remainder of `10^100` when divided by a very precise value of `π`. This process is called argument reduction.\n3.  We will set the precision of `mpmath` to a high value (e.g., 120 decimal places) to ensure the argument reduction and the final `tan` calculation are accurate.\n4.  We will then compute `tan(10^100)` using `mpmath`.\n5.  Finally, we will convert the numerical result to a string and extract the first three characters that appear after the decimal point.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# Set the precision for the calculation.\n# dps stands for decimal places. A precision of 120 is sufficient for this problem.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 120\n\n# Define the large number x = 10^100 using mpmath's high-precision float type.\nbase = 10\nexponent = 100\nx = mpmath.mpf(base)**exponent\n\n# Calculate tan(x). mpmath handles the argument reduction automatically.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# To fulfill the requirement \"output each number in the final equation\",\n# we print the equation with the calculated result.\n# We format the result to show a few more digits for context.\nprint(f\"tan({base}^{exponent}) = {mpmath.nstr(result, 15)}\")\n\n# Now, we extract the first 3 digits after the comma (decimal point).\n# Convert the result to a string.\nresult_str = str(result)\n\n# Find the index of the decimal point.\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\n\n# Slice the string to get the three characters immediately after the decimal point.\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are: {first_three_digits}\")\n```\n<<<557>>>"
