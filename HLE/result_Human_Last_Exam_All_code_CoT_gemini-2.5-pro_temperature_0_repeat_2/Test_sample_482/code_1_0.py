    Calculates the critical correlation required to balance potentiation and depression.

    The critical correlation coefficient (rho) is derived from a linear stability
    analysis of the weight dynamics. The analysis shows that the critical point
    is reached when rho = 1/N, where N is the number of neurons in the
    input populations.

    The problem provides an inter-event interval of 150s. We make the assumption
    that this value is to be used for the number of neurons, N.
