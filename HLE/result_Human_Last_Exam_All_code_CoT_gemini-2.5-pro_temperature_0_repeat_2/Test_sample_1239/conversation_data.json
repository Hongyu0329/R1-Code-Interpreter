    "To determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the continuous transformations that leave the equations invariant and count the number of independent parameters (generators) for these transformations. This number is the dimension of the Lie algebra of the symmetry group.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  List the fundamental symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n2.  For each type of symmetry, determine its contribution to the total dimension. This is the number of independent parameters that define the transformation.\n3.  Sum the dimensions from all symmetry types to get the total dimension of the Lie group.\n4.  The Python script will codify this process by defining a variable for the dimension of each symmetry, printing the breakdown, and then calculating and printing the total sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The dimension of a Lie group is the number of its generators.
