def solve_continuum_problem():
    """
    This function solves the problem by translating it into a graph theory question.

    The problem asks for the largest number n for an essential decomposition of a
    special continuum X with 5 special points {a,b,c,d,e}.

    1. The properties of X imply that any proper subcontinuum in the decomposition
       can contain at most 2 of the 5 special points.
    2. This allows us to model the decomposition as a graph where the 5 points are
       vertices and the n subcontinua are edges.
    3. The "essential" nature of the decomposition implies that this graph must be
       triangle-free. If there were a triangle of continua (edges), one would be
       subsumed by the other two, violating the essential condition.
    4. The problem is now: what is the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free
       graph with 5 vertices?
    5. By Turan's theorem, this maximum is achieved by a complete bipartite graph
       with partitions as equal in size as possible.
    6. For 5 vertices, the partitions are of size 2 and 3. The number of edges
       in this K_{2,3} graph is the product of the partition sizes.

    # into two sets with sizes as close as possible.
    partition1_size = num_vertices // 2
    partition2_size = num_vertices - partition1_size
    
    # The maximum number of edges is the product of the sizes of the partitions.
