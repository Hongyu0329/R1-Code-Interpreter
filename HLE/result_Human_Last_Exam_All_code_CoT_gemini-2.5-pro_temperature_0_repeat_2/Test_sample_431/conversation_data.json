    "To determine the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker domain of the human GABAAρ1 receptor, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Retrieve Protein Information**: I will use the canonical amino acid sequence for the human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt accession number P24046).\n2.  **Identify Domain Boundaries**: Based on the UniProt annotation, the third transmembrane domain (TM3) ends at position 313, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) begins at position 429. Therefore, the TM3-TM4 linker spans from residue 314 to 428.\n3.  **Extract Linker Sequence**: I will extract the specific amino acid sequence corresponding to this linker domain.\n4.  **Count Cysteine Residues**: I will then count the occurrences of the Cysteine residue, represented by the single-letter code 'C', within the extracted linker sequence.\n\nThis process will be automated using a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef count_cysteine_in_linker():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of Cysteine residues in the TM3-TM4 linker\n    of the human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt: P24046).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Full amino acid sequence for human GABAAρ1 receptor (UniProt: P24046)\n    full_sequence = (\n        \"MGFALFLLAWATLASLSPGARADDIWVPGSFFRQVTPQALMELNSRVVARLPGLGPLRL\"\n        \"PLDQVNVLLDGWLPVSFLDYEKPMSSIVSTNILDRLLDLLGYDNRLRPGFGGPPVNYGG\"\n        \"KAVSYTLESIRYSIPDLFFVNSIVYWTDFFHQVATDMPLRILLDSALKVPDLNVYALLE\"\n        \"GRSWKDEYRVCDVTFFTSYTGIDLSLDITSEVNLMTTPNFLLSKKSPLHAKPTVFERLM\"\n        \"KPLWIPDLVLYNNTVGKYAIHVTCSCLALLNSHFRFDAYAKMDLVSLYLGIPLMLIWCE\"\n        \"VFVAFLLQESAGAQAQPARTSVPAKASAPPLKQESLTTAPPAPKSPEEMRKLFIQRAAY\"\n        \"LRELKRNPSVEEAESEPTRKMSAEDPMKNKWRYVFFPMAFLIFNMFWVIYKWINDKEVE\"\n        \"KTSKADSTSRQLKQPLGPGSPNTALSKADDSLAEVQTSLGSTIAKSIDVY\"\n    )\n\n    # UniProt positions are 1-based.
