def solve_history_question():
    """
    This function analyzes the historical question and determines the best answer.
    The question asks for two pieces of information:
    1. The year of a key shift in the French monarchy's stylization.
    2. The biographer who gave the relevant monarch his epithet.

    Historical Analysis:
    - The monarch in question is Philip II Augustus.
    - The shift from 'King of the Franks' (personality of law) to 'King of France' (territoriality of law) began around 1190.
    - Philip II's reign ended in 1223. The entire reign 'contained' this morphing.
    - The biographer who gave Philip the epithet 'Augustus' was Rigord.

    Evaluating the Options:
    A. 1190, Suetonius: Correct year for the start of the change, but wrong biographer.
    B. 1250, Joinville: Wrong year and wrong biographer (Joinville wrote about Louis IX).
    C. 1223, Rigord: The year is the end of Philip II's reign, and the biographer is correct.
    D. 1789, Voltaire: Wrong year and wrong biographer.
    E. 1190, Baldwin: Correct year for the start of the change, but wrong biographer.

    Conclusion:
    Option C is the strongest choice. It correctly identifies the biographer, Rigord, who is the source of the epithet 'Augustus'. While 1190 is a more precise date for the beginning of the title change, the year 1223 represents the end of the reign of the monarch in question, Philip II, and is paired with the correct biographer.
    """
    
    # The chosen answer is C, which contains the year 1223 and the name Rigord.
    year = 1223
    biographer = "Rigord"
    
    # The final equation is the combination of the correct year and biographer.
    # Outputting each number in the final equation as requested.
    print(f"The year in the correct option is: {year}")
    print(f"The biographer in the correct option is: {biographer}")
    print("This corresponds to option C.")
