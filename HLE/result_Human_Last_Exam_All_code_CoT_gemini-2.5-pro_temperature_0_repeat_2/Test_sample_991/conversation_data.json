    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Riddle:** I will break down the riddle into three distinct visual components:\n    *   \"A wooden stick\"\n    *   \"hanging a square box\"\n    *   \"a ladder placed in the center\"\n2.  **Identify Character Components:** I will map each visual component to a corresponding part (radical or stroke) of a Chinese character.\n3.  **Synthesize the Character:** I will combine these components to form the final Chinese character.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this step-by-step explanation and reveals the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the riddle:\n\n```python\ndef solve_character_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by breaking it down into its components and\n    mapping them to parts of a Chinese character.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The riddle is: 'A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.'\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: The wooden stick\n    print(\"1. 'A wooden stick' points to the character for wood, which is the radical '木' (mù). This forms the base of our character.\")\n\n    # Step 2: The hanging box and ladder\n    print(\"2. 'Hanging a square box' with 'a ladder placed in the center' describes the component that sits on top of the '木'.\")\n    print(\"   - This component looks like a box '口' with vertical lines inside, resembling a ladder.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the components\n    print(\"\\n3. When we place this 'box with a ladder' component on top of the 'wooden stick' (木), we form the final character.\")\n\n    final_character = \"柬\"\n    print(f\"\\nThe resulting character is: {final_character}\")\n\n\nsolve_character_riddle()\n```\n<<<柬>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.
