    print("   - The lab INCORRECTLY concluded that the antibiotic was effective.")
    print("   - The CORRECT conclusion should have been that the lack of growth was due to the non-viable, old bacterial culture used for the test.")

    print(f"\n4. The Final Outcome:")

    print("   - Batches 1 & 2 (with active antibiotic) inhibited this contamination.")
