    "Here is my plan to find the answer:\n1.  Analyze the user's question to identify the key constraints. The molecule must be a \"polycyclic hydrocarbon\" and its name must be derived from a \"creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years.\"\n2.  The timeframe \"over 65 million years\" points directly to the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs and their contemporaries, such as pterosaurs.\n3.  I will search for polycyclic hydrocarbons named after these types of creatures.\n4.  A known example is a molecule whose 2D chemical structure resembles a pterodactyl. This molecule was synthesized and named \"Pterodactyladiene\".\n5.  I will write a simple Python script to print this name as the answer, fulfilling the user's request for a code block.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The creature in question is the pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived\n    # alongside dinosaurs and went extinct in the same event about 66 million years ago.\n    # A specific polycyclic hydrocarbon was synthesized and named for its\n    # resemblance to a pterodactyl.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Pterodactyladiene\"\n    \n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is: {hydrocarbon_name}\")\n\nfind_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<Pterodactyladiene>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
