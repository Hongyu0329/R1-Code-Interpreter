    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Attacks:** The problem is set on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A toroidal board wraps around both horizontally and vertically. This \"wrap-around\" nature is crucial for defining attacks. For two queens placed at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board:\n    *   **Row Attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Toroidal Diagonal Attacks:** This is the tricky part. We can use modular arithmetic to check for diagonal attacks that wrap around the board.\n        *   They are on the same \"main\" diagonal if `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`.\n        *   They are on the same \"anti\" diagonal if `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`.\n\n2.  **Strategy:** The board size (25 squares) and the number of queens (4) are small enough for a brute-force approach. The plan is as follows:\n    *   Generate all possible ways to place 4 queens on the 25 squares. The `itertools.combinations` function in Python is ideal for this, as it will give us every unique set of 4 squares.\n    *   For each set of 4 squares (a potential placement), we will check if it's a valid \"non-attacking\" configuration.\n    *   To check a placement, we will examine every pair of queens within that placement. If any pair attacks each other according to the toroidal rules, the entire placement is invalid.\n    *   We will maintain a counter, incrementing it only for placements where no queens attack each other.\n\n3.  **Implementation:** The Python script will:\n    *   Define the board size `N=5` and the number of queens `NUM_QUEENS=4`.\n    *   Create a list of all 25 possible square coordinates.\n    *   Use `itertools.combinations` to loop through every possible 4-queen placement.\n    *   Inside the loop, check each pair of queens for row, column, or toroidal diagonal attacks.\n    *   If a placement is found to be valid, increment a counter.\n    *   Finally, print the total count of valid placements, including the parameters of the problem for clarity.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_non_attacking_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5\n    toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n    # Create a list of all possible squares on the board, e.g., (0, 0), (0, 1), ...\n    squares = [(r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N)]\n\n    # Generate all unique combinations of placing NUM_QUEENS on the squares\n    possible_placements = itertools.combinations(squares, NUM_QUEENS)\n\n    valid_placement_count = 0\n\n    # Iterate through each possible placement\n    for placement in possible_placements:\n        is_valid = True\n        # Check for attacks between any pair of queens in the current placement.\n        # We can use itertools.combinations again to get all unique pairs of queens.\n        for q1, q2 in itertools.combinations(placement, 2):\n            r1, c1 = q1\n            r2, c2 = q2\n\n            # Check for attacks: row, column, and the two toroidal diagonals\n            if (r1 == r2 or\n                    c1 == c2 or\n                    (r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N or\n                    (r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N):\n                is_valid = False\n                break  # An attack was found, so this placement is invalid.\n\n        if is_valid:\n            valid_placement_count += 1\n\n    # Print the final result including the parameters of the problem\n    print(f\"On a {N}x{N} toroidal board, the number of ways to place {NUM_QUEENS} non-attacking queens is:\")\n    print(valid_placement_count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_non_attacking_queens()\n```\n<<<200>>>"
