    "Here is my plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  **Establish the Start Date:** The Second Great War begins with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*, which is set in the year 2504.\n2.  **Establish the End Date:** The war concludes with the epilogue of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, where Amon is finally defeated. This takes place in the year 2506.\n3.  **Calculate the Duration:** I will subtract the start year from the end year to find the total duration.\n4.  **Round Up:** The problem requires the answer to be rounded up to the nearest whole year. I will use a ceiling function for this, although in this case, the result is already an integer.\n5.  **Generate Code:** I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War in StarCraft lore starts with the events of Wings of Liberty\n# and ends with the epilogue of Legacy of the Void.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the duration in years\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# The question asks to round up the result.\n# Since the result is an integer, ceiling won't change it, but we follow the instruction.\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore began in the year {start_year} and ended in the year {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"The calculation for the duration is: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"Rounding up to the nearest whole year, the war lasted for {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
