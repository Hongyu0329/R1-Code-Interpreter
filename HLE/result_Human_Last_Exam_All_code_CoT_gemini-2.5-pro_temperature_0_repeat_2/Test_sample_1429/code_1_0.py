    print("The machine described is a Random Access Machine (RAM). Its instruction set includes arithmetic (ADD), bitwise logic (BITWISENAND), memory access (LOAD/STORE), and conditional control flow (BRANCHIFZERO). This set of operations is known to be sufficient for universal computation.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: The 'Boopable' Definition.")
    print("A function is 'boopable' if a program for it works given sufficiently large resources (R, A, W). This means we can assume the machine has an arbitrarily large memory and register file for any given computation. This is analogous to a Turing machine's infinite tape, which provides unbounded (but finite for any single run) memory.")
    
    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion for A.")
    print("A machine with a universal instruction set and access to unbounded memory is Turing-equivalent. Therefore, any function computable by this machine (a 'boopable' function) is by definition Turing-computable.")

    print("\nPlan: We will analyze the strict performance constraint (`<= x+50` steps) and determine if it's achievable with the given instruction set.")
    
    print("\nStep 1: The Time Constraint.")
    print("The program must perform `x` BOOPs. The total steps allowed is `x + 50`. This leaves a tiny, constant 'overhead' budget of 50 instructions for all setup, looping, and halting logic, regardless of the size of `x`.")
    
    print("\nStep 2: The Failure of a Looping Strategy.")
    print("A simple loop to perform an action `x` times requires multiple instructions per iteration (e.g., BOOP, ADD to decrement a counter, BRANCHIFZERO to loop). Let's say the loop body has C instructions.")
    print("The total steps would be approximately C * x. The constraint is `C * x <= x + 50`.")

    print("This inequality, `(C-1)*x <= 50`, is false for large `x` if C > 1. Thus, a standard loop is too slow.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Impossibility of a 'Straight-Line' Strategy.")
    print("To meet the time budget, the program would need to execute `x` BOOPs and then HALT. This would require placing a HALT instruction at a memory address determined by `x`.")
    print("However, the `STORE adr <- reg` instruction requires `adr` to be a fixed, immediate address. The machine lacks indirect addressing, so it cannot use the value of `x` from a register as a memory address to write to. Therefore, it cannot place the HALT instruction dynamically.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion for B.")
    print("Since simple loops are too slow and the instruction set is too limited to implement a faster dynamic or self-modifying solution, no such program L can exist.")
