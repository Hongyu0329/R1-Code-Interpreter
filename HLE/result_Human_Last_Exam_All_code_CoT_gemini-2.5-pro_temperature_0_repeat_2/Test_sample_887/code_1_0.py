    print("An infrared laser excites the C-H bond in a CHD3 molecule. This means energy is specifically added to the C-H bond's vibrational motion, a process called mode-selective excitation.")

    print("\nStep 2: How vibrational energy affects reactivity.")
    print("The energy added to the C-H bond helps the system overcome the activation energy barrier required for a chemical reaction to occur. This generally increases the reaction rate.")

    print("\nStep 3: Considering the reaction pathways.")
    print("The reaction with atomic fluorine (F) can break either the C-H bond or a C-D bond.")
    print("  - Pathway 1 (H-abstraction): F + CHD3 -> HF + CD3")
    print("  - Pathway 2 (D-abstraction): F + CHD3 -> DF + CHD2")

    print("\nStep 4: The impact of selective excitation.")
    print("Because the C-H bond is selectively 'energized', Pathway 1 is preferentially promoted. The excited C-H bond is much more likely to break than the 'cold' C-D bonds.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final conclusion.")
    print("The overall effect is twofold:")
    print("  a) The reaction is accelerated because of the extra energy.")
    print("  b) The reaction becomes selective, enhancing the probability of breaking the C-H bond over the C-D bonds.")
    
    print("\nMatching this conclusion with the answer choices, option D is the most accurate.")
    print("D. It accelerates the reaction by enhancing the likelihood of H atom removal over D atoms.")
