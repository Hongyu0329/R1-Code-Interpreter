# According to the new axiom, the number of parallel lines that can be drawn
# through a point not on a given line is 3.
num_parallel_lines = 3

# We have three sets of new lines:
# 1. Lines through vertex A, parallel to side BC.
# 2. Lines through vertex B, parallel to side AC.
# 3. Lines through vertex C, parallel to side AB.
# Each set contains `num_parallel_lines`.

# Calculate the number of intersections between pairs of these sets.
# A line from one set (e.g., through A, parallel to BC) will intersect a line
# from another set (e.g., through B, parallel to AC) because their reference
# lines (BC and AC) are not parallel.

# Intersections between lines from A and lines from B
intersections_A_B = num_parallel_lines * num_parallel_lines

# Intersections between lines from B and lines from C
intersections_B_C = num_parallel_lines * num_parallel_lines

# Intersections between lines from C and lines from A
intersections_C_A = num_parallel_lines * num_parallel_lines

# The total number of intersections is the sum of these.
# We assume these intersection points are all distinct.
total_intersections = intersections_A_B + intersections_B_C + intersections_C_A
