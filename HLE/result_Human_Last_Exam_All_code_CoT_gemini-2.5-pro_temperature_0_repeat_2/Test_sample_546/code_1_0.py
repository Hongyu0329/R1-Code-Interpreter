# As derived in the explanation, the complex expression for f(p)
# simplifies to 2**81, regardless of the specific large value of p,
# provided the primality conditions hold.
# The modulus M is much larger than 2**81, so the final result is just 2**81.

# The final simplified equation is f(p) = 2^81.
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result using Python's arbitrary-precision integers.
result = pow(base, exponent)

# As requested, we output each number in the final equation.
