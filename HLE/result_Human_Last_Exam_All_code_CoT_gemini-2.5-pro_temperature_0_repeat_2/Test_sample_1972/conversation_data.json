    "Here is my plan to answer your question:\n1.  I will first identify the key elements in your query: the specific quote (\"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\") and the description of the author (\"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\").\n2.  I will use this information to determine the specific text by Jorge Luis Borges where these statements were made.\n3.  My search indicates that these descriptions are from Borges's prologue to a novel written by his close friend and collaborator.\n4.  I will identify the novel and the author from the context of that prologue.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print the answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the novel and author\n    Borges referred to with the given descriptions.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel = \"The Invention of Morel (La invenci√≥n de Morel)\"\n    author = \"Adolfo Bioy Casares\"\n\n    print(f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges was referring to is '{novel}'.\")\n    print(f\"The author, described as a continuator of Faulkner, is {author}.\")\n\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<The Invention of Morel by Adolfo Bioy Casares>>>"
