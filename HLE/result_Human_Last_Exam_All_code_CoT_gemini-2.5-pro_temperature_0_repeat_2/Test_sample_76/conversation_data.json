    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we can analyze the behavior of the polynomial for large values of $|x|$. For large $|x|$, the term $x^3$ dominates, which suggests that $P(x)$ is unlikely to be a perfect square. We can make this more rigorous by bounding $P(x)$ between the squares of two consecutive polynomials.\n\nLet's analyze $P(x)$ for large positive $x$. We can try to bound $P(x)$ by comparing it to the square of a polynomial-like expression in $x$.\nConsider the square of $(x^{3/2} - 8x^{1/2})^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x$. This is not a polynomial in $x$, but it gives us a good start.\nLet's try to bound $P(x)$ by the squares of polynomials of the form $(x-a)\\sqrt{x+b}$, which when squared are polynomials.\nLet's try to bound $P(x)$ by $(x-8)^2(x+c)$.\n$(x-8)^2(x+c) = (x^2-16x+64)(x+c) = x^3 + (c-16)x^2 + (64-16c)x + 64c$.\nWe want this to be close to $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\nComparing the $x^2$ terms, we have $c-16 = -16$, which gives $c=0$.\nSo let's compare $P(x)$ with $(x-8)^2 x = x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x$.\n$P(x) - (x^3 - 16x^2 + 64x) = -72x + 1056 - 64x = -136x + 1056$.\nFor $x > 1056/136 \\approx 7.76$, this difference is negative. So for $x \\ge 8$, $P(x) < x(x-8)^2$.\n\nLet's try to bound $P(x)$ between two consecutive squares.\nConsider the square of $(x-9)^2(x-c)$.\nLet's try to bound $P(x)$ by $(x-k)^2(x-l)$.\nLet's try to
