    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\nThe number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order `2n` for the electron or photon propagators, denoted as `a(n)`, is given by the double factorial of `(2n - 1)`. The formula is:\n`a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`\n\nA double factorial, `k!!`, is the product of all integers from `k` down to 1 that have the same parity (odd or even) as `k`. For example, `5!! = 5 * 3 * 1`.\n\nTo find `a(3)`, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Set `n = 3`.\n2.  Calculate the value `k = 2n - 1`.\n3.  Calculate the double factorial of `k`.\n4.  Print the full calculation, showing each number in the product and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n.\n    The user asks for a(3).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    \n    # The formula is a(n) = (2n - 1)!!\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n    \n    result = 1\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Calculate the double factorial and store the factors\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        factors.append(str(i))\n        \n    # Create the string representation of the equation\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(factors)\n    \n    # Print the final result showing the full equation\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the number of diagrams a({n}) is calculated as ({2*n - 1})!!.\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagrams()\n```\n<<<15>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
