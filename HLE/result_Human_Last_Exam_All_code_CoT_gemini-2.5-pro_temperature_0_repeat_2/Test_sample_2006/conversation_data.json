    "My plan is to solve the riddle by treating the haiku as a mathematical word problem.\n\n1.  **Identify the numbers:** I will parse the haiku line by line to extract the numbers involved in the equation.\n    *   \"An August tempest\" gives us the number 8, as August is the 8th month.\n    *   \"Twice fifteen\" is a simple calculation: 2 * 15 = 30.\n    *   \"A divine one\" refers to the number 1.\n\n2.  **Identify the operators:** The words in the haiku will be interpreted to find the operators connecting these numbers.\n    *   The numbers appear in the order 8, 30, 1.\n    *   The word \"tempest\" in the first line suggests a powerful, multiplying force, so I'll use multiplication (`*`).\n    *   The phrase \"winds of change\" in the second line suggests finding a difference, which points to subtraction (`-`).\n    *   This gives the equation: `8 * 30 - 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the result:** I will solve this equation.\n\n4.  **Answer the final question:** The prompt asks for the answer \"in alphabetical order\". I will interpret this to mean I should take the digits of the final numerical result, sort them alphabetically (e.g., '1', '2', '7'), and the first digit in that sorted list is the answer.\n\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will create a Python script to perform these steps, making sure to print the full equation as requested before printing the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_haiku_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the math riddle presented in the haiku.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
