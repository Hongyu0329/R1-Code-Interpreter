    "To find the smallest number `n` such that a set `G` of `n` elements with a binary operation `.` is not a group, we need to find the smallest `n` for which we can define an operation that violates at least one of the group axioms.\n\nA group `(G, .)` must satisfy:\n1.  **Closure**: For all `a, b` in `G`, `a . b` is in `G`. (This is implied by \"binary operation on G\").\n2.  **Associativity**: For all `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)`.\n3.  **Identity Element**: There exists an element `e` in `G` such that `a . e = e . a = a` for all `a` in `G`.\n4.  **Inverse Element**: For each `a` in `G`, there exists `b` in `G` such that `a . b = b . a = e`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  By standard convention in abstract algebra, a group is defined on a non-empty set, so we will search for `n >= 1`.\n2.  I will write a Python script that iterates through `n = 1, 2, 3, ...`.\n3.  For each `n`, the script will systematically generate all possible binary operations. A binary operation on `n` elements can be represented by an `n x n` multiplication table (a Cayley table).\n4.  For each generated operation, the script will check if it satisfies the group axioms: associativity, existence of an identity element, and existence of inverse elements.\n5.  The first value of `n` for which the script finds an operation that fails at least one of these axioms is the answer. The script will then print this number `n`, the specific operation table that serves as a counterexample, and a detailed explanation of which axiom it violates.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef find_smallest_non_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest integer n >= 1 for which there exists a binary operation\n    on a set of n elements that does not form a group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Start checking from n=1, as groups are conventionally non-empty.\n    n = 1\n    while True:\n        print(f\"--- Checking for n = {n} ---\")\n        elements = list(range(n))\n        num_operations = n**(n*n)\n        \n        is_always_a_group = True\n        \n        # Generate all possible binary operations (Cayley tables) for size n.\n        # An operation is a function GxG -> G, which can be represented by an n x n table.\n        # There are n choices for each of the n*n entries in the table.\n        # We use itertools.product to generate all possible tables.\n        for table_flat in itertools.product(elements, repeat=n*n):\n            table = [list(table_flat[i*n : (i+1)*n]) for i in range(n)]\n            \n            # Check if this operation table forms a group.\n            is_g, reason, equation = check_group_properties(table, n)\n            \n            if not is_g:\n                # We found an operation for this n that is NOT a group.\n                # This means n is our answer.\n                is_always_a_group = False\n                print(f\"\\nSuccess!
