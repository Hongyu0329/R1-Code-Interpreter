    This function determines for which integers n the associate graph AG(Z_n) is a ring graph.
    
    A ring graph (or cycle graph) must be connected and 2-regular.

    1. Connectivity: The graph AG(Z_n) is a disjoint union of cliques. For it to be
       connected, it must be a single clique. This occurs if and only if n is a prime number.
       If n is a prime p, the graph is a complete graph K_{p-1}.

    2. 2-Regularity: For a complete graph K_{p-1}, the degree of every vertex is p-2.
       For this to be a ring graph, the degree must be 2. This implies p-2 = 2, so p = 4.

    3. Contradiction: The first condition requires n to be prime, while the second requires n=4.
       Since 4 is not a prime number, these conditions are contradictory.
       Therefore, no such integer n exists.
