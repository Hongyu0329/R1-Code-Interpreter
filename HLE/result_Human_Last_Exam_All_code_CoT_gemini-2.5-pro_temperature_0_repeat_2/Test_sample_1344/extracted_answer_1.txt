The optimal combination is a Zirconium (Zr) based Constrained-Geometry Catalyst (CGC) grafted onto a Sulfated Zirconia (SZ) support. This system is bifunctional: the Zr site catalyzes polymerization and H2 activation, while the acidic SZ support facilitates the C-C bond cleavage required for hydrogenolysis.
