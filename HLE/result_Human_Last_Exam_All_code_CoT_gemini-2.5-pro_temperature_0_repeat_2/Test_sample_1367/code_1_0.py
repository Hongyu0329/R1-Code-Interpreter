    This function provides the answers to the questions about the vertex algebra V(p).

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) The vertex algebra V(p), also known as the triplet W-algebra W(p), is a well-studied object.
        A key result states that V(p) is simple if and only if p is not a prime number.
        Since there are prime numbers in the set of positive integers (e.g., p=2, 3, 5), V(p) is not simple for all p. Thus, the answer is No.

    (b) If a non-trivial ideal I exists in V(p), it must satisfy certain conditions.
        1. By definition, an ideal I is a subspace closed under the action of any element in V(p). Since L_k(sl_2) is a subalgebra of V(p), any ideal of V(p) is necessarily a module for L_k(sl_2).
        2. The simplicity of a vertex algebra is equivalent to the irreducibility of its vacuum module. For a highest-weight module like V(p), reducibility is equivalent to the existence of a singular vector (a highest-weight vector of a proper submodule). An ideal is a proper submodule, which must be generated by a singular vector. Therefore, the ideal must contain a singular vector.
        Since both conditions are necessary, the answer is Both.

    (c) Simplicity of V(p) means it is irreducible as a module over itself. The question asks if this implies irreducibility as a module over its subalgebra L_k(sl_2).
        An algebra can be simple while being reducible as a module for a subalgebra. In fact, V(p) is a larger structure than L_k(sl_2) and generally decomposes into a direct sum of several irreducible L_k(sl_2)-modules. This means it is reducible as an L_k(sl_2)-module, even when V(p) itself is simple (e.g., for p=4, which is not prime).
        Therefore, simplicity of V(p) does not imply its irreducibility as an L_k(sl_2)-module. The answer is No.
