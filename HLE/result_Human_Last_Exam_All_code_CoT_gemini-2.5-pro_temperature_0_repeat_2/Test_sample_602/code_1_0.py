    This function calculates the exact value of l(n) by finding its limit as n -> infinity.

    The step-by-step derivation shows that l(n) is a complex function of n.
    l(n) = (2*n**2 + 2 - 2*(2*n - 1)*sqrt(n**2 - n + 1)) / n**2
    Since the problem asks for a single "exact value", it's interpreted as asking for the limit of l(n) as n approaches infinity.
    We use the sympy library for symbolic mathematics to compute this limit.
