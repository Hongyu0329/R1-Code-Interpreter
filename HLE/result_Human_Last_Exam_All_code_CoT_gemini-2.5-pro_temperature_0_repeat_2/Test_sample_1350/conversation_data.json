    "This is a literary question that requires knowledge of the book \"The House of the Wolfings\" by William Morris. My plan is to identify the character based on the plot details described in the prompt and then present this answer using a Python script as requested.\n\nThe character who travels to a Roman city is the Wood-Sun, the \"fetch\" or spiritual counterpart of the Hall-Sun. It is the Wood-Sun who observes the Romans and reports back to the Wolfings, describing their customs and their founding myth involving twin boys being suckled by a she-wolf, a clear allusion to Romulus and Remus.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this character.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the character from\n    William Morris's \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes the\n    Roman founding myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character who travels to a Roman city and witnesses their customs\n    # is the Wood-Sun. She is the one who describes their origin story,\n    # which readers recognize as the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n    character_name = \"The Wood-Sun\"\n\n    print(f\"In William Morris's The House of the Wolfings, the character who describes the Roman founding myth (alluding to Romulus and Remus) is: {character_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_character()\n```\n<<<The Wood-Sun>>>"
