    "Of course. Here is a Python script that explains and identifies the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for the specified catalytic reactions.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Acknowledge that the \"ideal\" ratio is not one single value but falls within an optimal range found through experimental research.\n2.  Explain the scientific reasoning behind this optimal range, which involves maximizing the active sites at the Ni-Ceria interface while preventing the formation of less active, bulk nickel oxide.\n3.  State the commonly accepted optimal range in terms of atomic percentage.\n4.  Convert this atomic percentage to a more direct Ni/Ce molar ratio to provide a clear and actionable answer.\n5.  Present this information using `print` statements within a Python code block.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_ideal_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalysis\n    based on findings from scientific literature.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts in Water Gas Shift (WGS) and water splitting reactions is determined by a balance between two factors:\")\n    print(\"1.
