    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Represent the Group G**: I will first represent the given permutation group `G` in a computational format. The group acts on a set of 12 elements `{1, 2, ..., 9, x, y, z}`. I will map these elements to integers `0` through `11` to use the `sympy` library in Python.\n2.  **Identify the Group G**: Using `sympy`, I will compute the order of `G` and check if it is a simple group. These properties are often sufficient to identify the group from the list of known finite simple groups.\n3.  **Find the Schur Multiplier A**: Once `G` is identified, I will look up its Schur multiplier, `A = M(G)`. The Schur multipliers for all sporadic simple groups (like the Mathieu groups) are well-documented.\n4.  **Count Proper Subgroups of A**: The Schur multiplier `A` is a finite abelian group. I will determine its structure and then count its proper subgroups. A proper subgroup is any subgroup other than the group itself.\n5.  **Consider Isomorphism**: Finally, I will count how many distinct isomorphism classes these proper subgroups fall into.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out these steps, printing the reasoning at each stage.\n\n```python\nimport sys\ntry:\n    from sympy.combinatorics import Permutation, PermutationGroup\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Sympy library not found.
