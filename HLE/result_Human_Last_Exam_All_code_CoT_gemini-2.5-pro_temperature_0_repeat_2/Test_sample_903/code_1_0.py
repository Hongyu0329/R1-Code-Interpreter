    Analyzes the reaction to determine the atoms coordinated to the Zinc center.

    Reactants:
    1. Ligand: 1,3-Di[3-(2â€™-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene
       - This is a tetradentate ligand with four Nitrogen (N) donor atoms.
    2. Metal Salt: ZnBr2
       - This provides the Zn(II) center and two Bromide (Br) ions, which can act as ligands.

    Stoichiometry: 1:1

    Prediction:
    The four nitrogen atoms from the ligand and the two bromide ions from the salt
    will coordinate to the central Zn(II) ion, forming a stable 6-coordinate complex.
