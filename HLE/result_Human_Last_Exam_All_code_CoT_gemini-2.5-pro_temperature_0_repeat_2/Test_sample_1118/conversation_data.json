    "This is a question about art history. My plan is to use my knowledge base to identify the object in Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait. I will then create a Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it in a full sentence to answer your question.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In his 1933 \"Self-Portrait with Poppy\", Curt Querner holds a poppy flower.\n    # This was painted after his escape from the Gestapo and is seen as a symbol\n    # of resistance and life against the encroaching Nazi regime.\n    symbol = \"a poppy\"\n    \n    print(f\"In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol()\n```\n<<<A poppy>>>"
