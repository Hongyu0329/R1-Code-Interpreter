    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the spaces involved and apply a known theorem from algebraic topology.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the general form of the map:** The map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is an instance of the general map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$.\n2.  **Simplify the target space:** The smash product of two spheres $S^p \\wedge S^q$ is homotopy equivalent to a single sphere $S^{p+q}$. Therefore, the target space $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n3.  **Apply the relevant theorem:** A result by G.W. Whitehead, related to the EHP sequence, gives the connectivity of this map. The theorem states that the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^p \\wedge \\Omega S^q) \\to \\Omega(S^p \\wedge S^q)$ is $(p+q-1)$-connected. A map is $k$-connected if it induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_i$ for $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** We will substitute the given values, $p=4$ and $q=6$, into the formula $p+q-1$ to find the connectivity.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The map is an instance of a general map involving spheres S^p and S^q.\n    # In this case, p and q are the dimensions of the spheres.\n    p = 4\n    q = 6\n\n    # A standard theorem in algebraic topology states that the connectivity\n    # of the map Sigma(Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q) -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q)\n    # is given by the formula: p + q - 1.\n    \n    # We apply this formula to our specific case.\n    connectivity = p + q - 1\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the connectivity of the map:\")\n    print(\"  Σ(ΩS^4 ∧ ΩS^6) → Ω(S^4 ∧ S^6)\")\n    print(\"\\nThis is a specific case of a general map for spheres S^p and S^q.\")\n    print(\"A theorem by G.W.
