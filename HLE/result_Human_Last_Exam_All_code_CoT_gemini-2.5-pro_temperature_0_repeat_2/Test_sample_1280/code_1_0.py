# The problem asks for the maximum number of energy levels that can differ
# between two supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians H_0 and H_1.
#
# Let the set of eigenvalues (the spectrum) of H_0 be S_0 and for H_1 be S_1.
# The theory of supersymmetric quantum mechanics shows that for the given
# factorization, the spectra are related such that:
# S_0 \ { -alpha } = S_1 \ { -alpha }
#
# This means the two sets of eigenvalues are identical except possibly for the
# single value -alpha.
#
# Let's consider the possible cases for the symmetric difference between the sets,
# which represents the differing levels:
# 1. -alpha is in S_0 but not in S_1. The sets differ by one level.
# 2. -alpha is in S_1 but not in S_0. The sets differ by one level.
# 3. -alpha is in both S_0 and S_1, or in neither. The sets are identical,
#    differing by zero levels.
#
# The maximum number of differing levels is therefore 1.

max_differing_levels = 1

# There is no equation with multiple numbers in this theoretical problem.
# The final answer is the number derived from the theory.
