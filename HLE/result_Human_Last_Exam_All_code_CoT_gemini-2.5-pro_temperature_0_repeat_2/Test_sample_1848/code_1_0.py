    This script explains the solution to the given problem in combinatorial set theory.
    The problem asks for the largest cardinality of a collection A of omega_4-sized
    subsets of omega_4, such that the intersection of any two distinct subsets in A
    has a cardinality strictly less than omega_4, given that 2**omega_3 = omega_4.
