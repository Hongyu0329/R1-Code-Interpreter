    This function solves for the value of capacitor x in the ladder circuit.

    The problem reduces to solving the quadratic equation for x (the characteristic capacitance):
    2*x^2 + 2*c*x - c^2 = 0
    where c is the capacitance of the capacitors in each cell.

    The solution to a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a.
    In our case, a=2, b=2c, c=-c^2.
    x = [-2c ± sqrt((2c)^2 - 4(2)(-c^2))] / (2*2)
    x = [-2c ± sqrt(4c^2 + 8c^2)] / 4
    x = [-2c ± sqrt(12c^2)] / 4
    x = [-2c ± 2c*sqrt(3)] / 4
    x = c * (-1 ± sqrt(3)) / 2

    Since capacitance must be positive, we take the positive root.
    x = c * (sqrt(3) - 1) / 2
