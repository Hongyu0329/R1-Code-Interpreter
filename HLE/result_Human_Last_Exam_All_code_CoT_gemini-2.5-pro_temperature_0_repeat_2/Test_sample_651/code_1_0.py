    # Plan:
    # 1. Analyze the geometry of the triangle and the trajectory for a small angle theta.
    # 2. Determine the range of possible directions for the trajectory vector `v = y - x`.
    # 3. Determine the direction of the inner normal vector `n_A` to the side A.
    # 4. Use the properties of the vectors and the definition of the angle `alpha` to find its supremum, M(theta).
    # 5. Calculate the limit of M(theta) as theta approaches 0.

    print("Step-by-step derivation:")
    
    # Step 1: Approximating the geometry for small theta
    # The triangle vertices are O(0,0), B(5,0), and C(5*e^(i*theta)).
    # For small theta, C is approximately (5, 5*theta).
    # The side A connects B(5,0) and C(5, 5*theta).
    # The starting point x is on the unit circle arc from (1,0) to (cos(theta), sin(theta)) approx (1, theta).
    print("1. For a small angle theta, the triangle is a thin sliver.")
    print("   - The starting points 'x' are on a small arc near (1,0).")
    print("   - The target side 'A' is a small segment near x=5.")

    # Step 2: Range of trajectory vector directions
    # The trajectory vector is v = y - x.
    # x is a point with x-coordinate approx 1 and y-coordinate in [0, theta].
    # y is a point with x-coordinate approx 5 and y-coordinate in [0, 5*theta].
    # So, v = (y_x - x_x, y_y - x_y) is approx (4, delta_y).
    # The range of delta_y is [min(y_y) - max(x_y), max(y_y) - min(x_y)] = [0 - theta, 5*theta - 0] = [-theta, 5*theta].
    # The angle of v is arg(v) = atan(delta_y / 4).
    # For small theta, the range of arg(v) is approximately [atan(-theta/4), atan(5*theta/4)], which is [-theta/4, 5*theta/4].
    print("2. The direction of the trajectory vector v = y - x is analyzed.")
    print("   The range of angles for v, for small theta, is approximately [-theta/4, 5*theta/4].")

    # Step 3: Direction of the inner normal vector
    # A rigorous calculation shows the inner normal n_A has an angle of pi + theta/2.
    print("3. The inner normal vector n_A to side A has an angle of approximately pi + theta/2.")

    # Step 4: Finding the supremum M(theta)
    # alpha is the angle between the trajectory vector v and the inner normal n_A.
    # For a physical trajectory hitting the wall, v must point towards the wall.
    # This implies the angle alpha must be obtuse, i.e., alpha is in (pi/2, pi].
    # We want to find the supremum of alpha.
    # alpha = acos(cos(arg(v) - arg(n_A))).
    # The difference in angles, delta = arg(v) - arg(n_A), is in the range:
    # [-theta/4 - (pi + theta/2), 5*theta/4 - (pi + theta/2)] = [-pi - 3*theta/4, -pi + 3*theta/4].
    # The range of alpha is [acos(cos(-pi + 3*theta/4)), acos(cos(-pi))] = [pi - 3*theta/4, pi].
    # The supremum M(theta) is the maximum value in this range, which is pi.
    print("4. The angle alpha between v and n_A must be obtuse (in (pi/2, pi]).")
    print("   The supremum of alpha, M(theta), is found by maximizing the angle between v and n_A.")
    print("   This analysis shows that for any small theta > 0, M(theta) = pi.")

    # Step 5: The limit
    # Since M(theta) = pi for any small theta > 0, the limit is pi.
    limit_val = math.pi
    print("5. The limit of M(theta) as theta approaches 0 is the limit of a constant.")

    print(f"The final equation is: lim_{{theta -> 0}} M(theta) = {limit_val}")
    print("Each number in the final equation is:")
