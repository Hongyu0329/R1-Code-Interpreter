    The energy E is a quadratic form in the dislocation density tensor alpha, which is a general rank-2 tensor.
    For a cubic crystal, the number of independent coefficients in a quadratic form of a general rank-2 tensor
    is equal to the number of irreducible representations in the decomposition of that tensor under the cubic group.
    The 9 components of a rank-2 tensor decompose into 4 irreducible representations (A1g, T1g, Eg, T2g).
    Each irrep contributes one independent coefficient to the energy functional.
