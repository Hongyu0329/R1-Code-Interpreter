    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 method, we need to analyze the stability region of the method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the BDF4 method's stability function.** The stability of a linear multistep method is determined by applying it to the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$. This leads to a stability region in the complex plane for $z = h\\lambda$. The boundary of this region is given by $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta}) / \\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, where $\\rho(\\xi)$ and $\\sigma(\\xi)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method. For BDF4, with the convention $\\sigma(\\xi) = \\xi^4$, the polynomial $\\rho(\\xi)$ is:\n    $\\rho(\\xi) = \\frac{25}{12}\\xi^4 - 4\\xi^3 + 3\\xi^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\xi + \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n2.  **Identify the condition for the stability angle $\\alpha$.** The method is $A(\\alpha)$-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\le \\alpha\\}$. The maximum possible value of $\\alpha$ is determined by the rays from the origin that are tangent to the stability boundary. The angle of such a ray, $\\phi$, is an extremum of $\\arg(z(\\theta))$.\n\n3.  **Find the point of tangency.** The condition for the tangent to the curve $z(\\theta)$ to pass through the origin is that the argument of $z(\\theta)$ is at an extremum. This condition can be formulated as a polynomial equation in terms of $c = \\cos(\\theta)$. After a lengthy derivation, this equation simplifies to:\n    $(c-1)^3 (5c-1) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solve for the angle.** The equation has a trivial root $c=1$ (corresponding to $\\theta=0$, where $z=0$) and a non-trivial root $c = 1/5$. This non-trivial root gives the point of tangency that defines the stability angle.\n\n5.  **Calculate the tangent point and the angle.** With $\\cos(\\theta) = 1/5$, we can find the exact coordinates $(R, I)$ of the point $z(\\theta) = R+iI$ on the boundary.\n\n6.  **Determine $\\alpha$.** The angle of the tangent ray is $\\phi = \\arg(z) = \\arctan(I/R)$. The stability angle is given by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi$. This leads to $\\tan(\\alpha) = -\\tan(\\phi) = -I/R$.\n\n7.  **Implement in Python.** We will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform these calculations with exact arithmetic and derive the final expression for $\\alpha$. The code will print out the components of the final formula as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the exact stability angle alpha for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the BDF4 characteristic polynomial rho(xi)\n    # The stability boundary is given by z(xi) = rho(xi) / xi^4 for xi on the unit circle.\n    xi = sympy.Symbol('xi')\n    rho = (sympy.S(25)/12)*xi**4 - 4*xi**3 + 3*xi**2 - (sympy.S(4)/3)*xi + sympy.S(1)/4\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The BDF4 characteristic polynomial rho(xi) is defined.\")\n    print(f\"rho(xi) = {rho}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the value of cos(theta) for the point of tangency.\n    # The condition for the tangent to the stability boundary z(exp(i*theta)) passing\n    # through the origin simplifies to a polynomial equation in c = cos(theta).\n    # This equation is (c - 1)^3 * (5*c - 1) = 0.\n    c = sympy.Symbol('c')\n    poly_eqn = (c - 1)**3 * (5*c - 1)\n    print(\"Step 2: The condition for the extremal angle simplifies to a polynomial equation for c = cos(theta):\")\n    print(f\"{poly_eqn} = 0\")\n    \n    # The non-trivial root gives the stability angle.\n    c_sol = sympy.S(1)/5\n    print(f\"The non-trivial root is c = cos(theta) = {c_sol}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the coordinates (R, I) of the tangency point z.\n    # We find sin(theta) and then substitute xi = cos(theta) + i*sin(theta) into z(xi).\n    s_sol = sympy.sqrt(1 - c_sol**2)  # Take the positive root for theta in (0, pi)\n    \n    xi_sol = c_sol + sympy.I * s_sol\n    \n    # z(xi) = rho(xi) / xi^4 = rho(xi) * conjugate(xi)^4 since |xi|=1\n    z_sol = sympy.simplify(rho.subs(xi, xi_sol) * (xi_sol.conjugate())**4)\n    \n    R_sol = sympy.re(z_sol)\n    I_sol = sympy.im(z_sol)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: For this value of cos(theta), the point on the stability boundary is z = R + i*I where:\")\n    print(f\"R = {R_sol}\")\n    print(f\"I = {I_sol}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the stability angle alpha.\n    # The angle of the tangent ray is phi = arg(z).
