    This script analyzes a surgical complication scenario and determines the best course of action.

    The Plan:
    1. Define the problem: A stapler is stuck on the appendix base during a laparoscopic procedure.
    2. Evaluate each option based on surgical principles, prioritizing patient safety.
    3. Eliminate options that are overly risky or unnecessarily aggressive.
    4. Compare the remaining valid options to find the most logical and standard-of-care approach.
    5. Print the final conclusion.

    print("The primary goal is patient safety, which means preventing injury to the cecum and avoiding abdominal contamination.")

    print("Evaluating the options:")

    print("\nOption A: Staple and resect part of the cecum.")
    print("Analysis: This is unnecessarily aggressive. Removing healthy bowel (cecum) increases the complexity and risk of the procedure significantly. This is incorrect.")

    print("\nOption B: Pry the stapler open laparoscopically.")
    print("Analysis: This is extremely dangerous. The force required could easily tear the cecum, leading to severe contamination. This is incorrect.")

    print("\nPrinciple of Conversion to Open Surgery:")
    print("When a laparoscopic procedure encounters a critical issue that cannot be safely resolved, the standard of care is to convert to an open procedure for better control and visibility.")
    print("This makes options C, D, E, and F potentially viable, as they all involve an open incision.")

    print("Comparing the 'Open' options:")

    print("\nIncision Type: Midline (E, F) vs. Extending a Port (C, D).")
    print("Analysis: A midline incision is large and not typically required for an appendectomy. Extending the existing port incision is more direct, less invasive, and provides excellent access to the specific problem area.")
    print("Conclusion: Extending the port is the superior approach.")

    print("\nAction: 'Pry open' (C, E) vs. 'Complete the appendectomy' (D, F).")
    print("Analysis: 'Prying' the device open is a risky maneuver that can cause tissue damage. 'Completing the appendectomy' is the correct overall goal, which implies safely controlling the bowel, dissecting the appendix stump from the stapler, and ensuring the stump is securely closed under direct vision.")

    print("\nFinal Decision:")
    print("Option D combines the correct principle (convert to open), the best incision (extend the port), and the correct goal (safely complete the operation). It is the safest and most appropriate next step.")
