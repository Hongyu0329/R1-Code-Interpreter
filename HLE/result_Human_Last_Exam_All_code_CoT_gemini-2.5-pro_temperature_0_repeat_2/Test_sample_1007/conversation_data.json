    "To determine which ballet step ends in the same leg position as it starts, I will analyze the definition of each step provided in the answer choices. My plan is to represent each step and its key characteristic (whether the start and end positions are the same) in a data structure. Then, I will write a Python script to iterate through this data, print the analysis for each step, and identify the correct one.\n\nHere is the breakdown of each step:\n*   **Entrechat six:** This is a jump where the dancer starts in fifth position, beats their legs six times in the air, and lands back in the *exact same* fifth position they started from.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** This step starts in a closed position (e.g., fifth), opens to a second position, and closes back to fifth. However, the word \"changé\" explicitly means \"changed,\" so the foot that was in front at the start is in the back at the end.\n*   **Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step typically involves brushing one leg out and jumping to bring both legs together in the air, landing in fifth position. In most common forms (like assemblé dessus or dessous), the feet change their front/back orientation.\n*   **Glissade derrière:** A \"gliding\" step. Starting from fifth, the back foot glides out and the front foot closes behind it. This action changes which foot is in front.\n*   **Gargouillade:** A complex, decorative step that involves circular movements of the legs (ronds de jambe) and results in the feet changing their position in the final fifth position.\n\nBased on this analysis, the Entrechat six is the correct answer. The following Python code will programmatically arrive at this conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one starts and ends\n    in the same leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary to store information about each ballet step.\n    # The 'same_position' key indicates if the start and end leg positions are identical.\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'description': 'A vertical jump where the legs beat six times, starting from and landing in the same fifth position.',\n            'same_position': True\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Échappé battu changé',\n            'description': 'A step that moves from a closed to an open position and back to closed. \"Changé\" means the feet switch their front/back orientation.',\n            'same_position': False\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Assemblé',\n            'description': 'A jump where the legs are assembled in the air.
