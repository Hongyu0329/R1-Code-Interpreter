The Rust code will not compile due to a borrow checker error in the `FeedForward::backward` method.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:

1.  **The Problematic Code:** The error occurs in these lines within `FeedForward::backward`:
    ```rust
    // Inside a loop...
    self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);
    // and later...
    self.w1.set(j, k, self.w1.get(j, k) - ...);
    ```

2.  **Rust's Borrowing Rules:** Rust's memory safety is guaranteed by the borrow checker, which enforces a strict set of rules. One key rule is: you cannot have a mutable borrow of a value while an immutable borrow also exists.

3.  **The Conflict:**
    - The `set` method on the `Matrix` struct is defined as `fn set(&mut self, ...)`, so calling `self.w2.set(...)` requires a *mutable* borrow of `self.w2`.
    - To calculate the value to be set (the third argument to `set`), the code calls `self.w2.get(j, k)`. The `get` method is defined as `fn get(&self, ...)`, which requires an *immutable* borrow of `self.w2`.
    - The compiler sees that to execute this single line, it would need to borrow `self.w2` both mutably (for the `set` call) and immutably (to calculate the argument for `set`) at the same time. This is a direct violation of the borrowing rules.

4.  **Conclusion:** The compiler will detect this conflict and produce an error, preventing the code from compiling. The error message would be similar to "cannot borrow `self.w2` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable".

Therefore, the code will not compile due to an error.
