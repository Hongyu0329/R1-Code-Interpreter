    1.  The reaction is a nucleophilic substitution between the alcohol group of {reactant1} and {reactant2}.
    2.  The alcohol's oxygen atom attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionoformate, displacing the chloride.
    3.  This forms a new compound, an O,O'-disubstituted thionocarbonate.
    4.  The NMR data confirms this structure. The vinylic proton on the C2 of the geranyl moiety (-C=CH-CH2O-) is analyzed.
    5.  In geraniol, this proton's signal is at {geraniol_proton_shift}.
    6.  In Compound 1, the signal shifts significantly downfield to {compound1_proton_shift}.
    7.  This shift is caused by the strong electron-withdrawing (deshielding) effect of the newly formed thionocarbonate group.
