# 1. Define physical constants and problem inputs in SI units.
# Pandora's average orbital radius from Pegasi in meters
a = 100_000_000 * 1000
# Pandora's orbital period in seconds
T = 800 * 24 * 3600
# Speed of light in m/s
c = 299792458
# Pioneer's distance from the event horizon in meters
d = 13 * 1000

# 2. Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of Pegasi.
# The formula is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of Rs:
# Rs = (8 * pi^2 * a^3) / (T^2 * c^2)
Rs_numerator = 8 * (math.pi ** 2) * (a ** 3)
Rs_denominator = (T ** 2) * (c ** 2)
Rs = Rs_numerator / Rs_denominator

# 3. Calculate the time dilation factor (f) using the Taylor approximation.
# The Bagua architecture lacks a sqrt function, so we use the approximation:
# f = 1 / sqrt(1 - Rs/r) ≈ 1 + 0.5 * (Rs / (Rs + d))
f = 1 + 0.5 * (Rs / (Rs + d))

# 4. Determine the memory usage (z) for the most efficient Bagua C program.
# The program would use one 'frac' variable, which has a size of 8 trits.
# z = sizeof(signed char) + sizeof(unsigned wchar) + sizeof(signed char)
# z = 2 trits + 4 trits + 2 trits
z = 8

# 5. Output the final equation with its numbers and the final answer.
