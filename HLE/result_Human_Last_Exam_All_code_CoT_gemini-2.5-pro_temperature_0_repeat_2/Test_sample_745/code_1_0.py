    This function provides the answer to the topology problem.
    
    The problem asks for the largest number of components the set X \ C can have, given:
    - X is a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (the continuum).
    - A is a connected subset of X.
    - C is a connected component of X \ A.

    While a common but flawed theorem suggests the answer is 1, the theorem fails in spaces
    that are not locally connected. Counterexamples can be constructed where the number of
    components is greater than 1. The maximum possible number of components is in fact c,
    the cardinality of the continuum.
