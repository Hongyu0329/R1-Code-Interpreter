    "Of course. The quantity you're asking about is a cornerstone of nuclear reactor noise analysis. Here is a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to define the relationship and explain what this transformed function is called.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will provide a brief explanation of the physical context. The \"generalized pair correlation function\" in nuclear engineering describes the probability of finding pairs of neutrons at certain positions, energies, and times.\n2.  I will then explain that its double Fourier transform is a well-known quantity in signal processing and physics.\n3.  The Python code will then be presented. This script, when run, will:\n    *   Use the `sympy` library to formally define the mathematical symbols and functions involved.\n    *   State the common name for the transformed function: the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**.\n    *   Present the defining mathematical equation that connects the pair correlation function to the PSD, in accordance with the Wiener-Khinchin theorem.\n    *   Explicitly list and describe each symbol and component in the final equation, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef explain_fourier_transform_of_correlation_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script defines and explains the space-time Fourier transform\n    of the generalized pair correlation function in nuclear physics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
