    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThis is a knowledge-based question. My plan is to identify the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School based on the specific concepts mentioned (\"hallmark,\" \"symptoms,\" and \"signals\"). Then, I will write a simple Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School\n  philosopher known for distinguishing between symptoms and signals as\n  part of his analysis of signs (hallmarks).\n  \"\"\"\n  philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n  print(f\"The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who made this distinction is: {philosopher}\")\n\nfind_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
