        "The only ways to stop this chain are to accept a circular justification (e.g., J1 is justified by J3, "

        "in believing your lottery ticket will lose, but you don't *know* it will lose, even if it does.\n"
        "b) Fallibility: If justification can be fallible (i.e., it doesn't guarantee truth), then the "
        "connection between our evidence and reality seems coincidental. It means we can't distinguish, based on "
        "justification alone, between a justified belief that will become knowledge (because it happens to be true) "
