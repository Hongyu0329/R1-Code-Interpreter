    # B is false: The algorithm is NOT resilient to high treewidth.
    # C is true: The nodes are cliques, and the algorithm uses potentials which are joint distributions over these cliques.
    # D is false: The premise (resilience to high treewidth) is false.
    # E is true: This is the main limitation of the junction tree algorithm.
    # F is false: Same as D.
    # G is true: The need to handle joint distributions over large cliques is why high treewidth is a problem.
    # H is false: The relationship is exponential, not linear.
    # I is true: The complexity is exponential in the number of variables in the largest clique.
    # J is false: The efficiency is highly dependent on the number of variables.
    # L is true: This is a correct characterization of the running intersection property.
