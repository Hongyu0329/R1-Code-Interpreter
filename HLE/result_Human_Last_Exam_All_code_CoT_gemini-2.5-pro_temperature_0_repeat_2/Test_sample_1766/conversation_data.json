    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`, and the spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is obtained by combining `l` and `s`. The possible values for `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by $\\hbar m_j$, where the magnetic quantum number `m_j` can take values from `-j` to `+j` in steps of 1.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script to perform these calculations for each possible `j` value and print the results in the form of the eigenvalue equations.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l={l} and spin quantum number s={s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    j_vals = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n    \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {list(j_vals)}\\n\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalue equation for J^2 is: J^2 |j, m_j> = j(j+1)hbar^2 |j, m_j>\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalue equation for J_z is: J_z |j, m_j> = m_j*hbar |j, m_j>\\n\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate and display the eigenvalues for each j value.\n    # We will iterate in descending order of j, which is a common convention.\n    for j in sorted(j_vals, reverse=True):\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print the J^2 eigenvalue equation with the calculated value\n        print(f\"  J^2 |{j}, m_j> = {j}({j} + 1) hbar^2 |{j}, m_j> = {j2_eigenvalue:.2f} hbar^2 |{j}, m_j>\")\n        \n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j_vals = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values are: {list(m_j_vals)}\")\n        \n        # Print the J_z eigenvalue equations for each m_j\n        print(\"  The corresponding J_z eigenvalues are:\")\n        for m_j in m_j_vals:\n            print(f\"    J_z |{j}, {m_j}> = {m_j} hbar |{j}, {m_j}>\")\n        \n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z\n    for a p-electron (l=1, s=1/2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l={l} and spin quantum number s={s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    j_vals = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n    \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {list(j_vals)}\\n\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalue equation for J^2 is: J^2 |j, m_j> = j(j+1)hbar^2 |j, m_j>\")\n    print(\"The eigenvalue equation for J_z is: J_z |j, m_j> = m_j*hbar |j, m_j>\\n\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate and display the eigenvalues for each j value.\n    # We will iterate in descending order of j, which is a common convention.\n    for j in sorted(j_vals, reverse=True):\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Print the J^2 eigenvalue equation with the calculated value\n        print(f\"  J^2 |{j}, m_j> = {j}({j} + 1) hbar^2 |{j}, m_j> = {j2_eigenvalue:.2f} hbar^2 |{j}, m_j>\")\n        \n        # Determine the possible m_j values for the current j\n        m_j_vals = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values are: {list(m_j_vals)}\")\n        \n        # Print the J_z eigenvalue equations for each m_j\n        print(\"  The corresponding J_z eigenvalues are:\")\n        for m_j in m_j_vals:\n            print(f\"    J_z |{j}, {m_j}> = {m_j} hbar |{j}, {m_j}>\")\n        \n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n>>>"
