def solve_mystery_translation_challenge():
    """
    This function determines which translation practices can solve a specific
    phonetic-based plot challenge found in two mystery stories.

    The shared challenge in Asimov's "The Next Day" (a homophone clue) and
    Chesterton's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter" (a dialect/pronunciation clue)
    is that the plot hinges on language-specific sounds.

    The function evaluates six proposed methods:
    I.   Transcreation (finding an analogous pun/accent in the target language) - Capable.
    II.  Embedded audio links (playing the original English sound) - Capable.
    III. Changing the setting (insufficient on its own) - Not Capable.
    IV.  Making a character a foreigner (a specific type of transcreation) - Capable.
    V.   Pictorial illustration (cannot convey sound) - Not Capable.
    VI.  Footnotes with phonetic explanation - Capable.

    The final answer is the Roman numerals of the capable methods, sorted
    and separated by hyphens.
