def solve_graph_process():
    """
    This function encapsulates the reasoning for determining the bounds on the number of steps
    for the described graph process.

    The analysis proceeds as follows:
    1.  A vertex `v` is removed in one step if its degree `d_v` is a local maximum, i.e., `d_v >= d_u` for all its neighbors `u`.
        The life loss for such a vertex is `sum(min(1/d_v, 1/d_u)) = sum(1/d_v) = d_v * (1/d_v) = 1`.
    2.  A game can last many steps if we create a chain of dependencies, where a vertex `v_i` becomes a local maximum only after its neighbor `v_{i+1}` (with a higher degree) is removed.
    3.  We can construct a tree with a "spine" `v_1, ..., v_k` where degrees are strictly increasing, e.g., `d(v_i) > d(v_{i-1})`. This can be engineered to make the process last `k` steps.
    4.  Analysis of such a construction shows that the number of steps `k` is bounded by the maximum degree `Δ`, i.e., `k = O(Δ)`.
    5.  For a general forest, maximizing `k` under the constraint of `n` vertices leads to a construction where `k = O(sqrt(n))` and `Δ = O(sqrt(n))`.

    Applying these findings to the three cases:

    Case 1: Forest of maximum degree at most sqrt(log n).
    The number of steps is `k = O(Δ) = O(sqrt(log n))`.
    Comparing `sqrt(log n)` to the categories:
    - It's `ω(2^sqrt(log log n))`.
    - It's `O((log n)^0.9)` since `0.5 < 0.9`.
    This matches category 6.
    f1_category = 6

    Case 2: Forest of maximum degree at most log n.
    The number of steps is `k = O(Δ) = O(log n)`.
    A construction exists that achieves this bound, so `k = Theta(log n)`.
    This matches category 8.
    f2_category = 8

    Case 3: Any forest.
    The maximum number of steps is achieved by a construction yielding `k = Theta(sqrt(n))`.
    `sqrt(n)` is `ω(log n)`.
    This matches category 9.
    f3_category = 9

    The resulting three-digit number is formed by these categories.
