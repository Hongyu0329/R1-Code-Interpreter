    # (a) If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # Yes. The group G acts quasiprimitively on the face set F. By definition, this means
    # every non-trivial normal subgroup of G is transitive on F. The socle N is a
    # non-trivial normal subgroup. Therefore, N acts transitively on the faces F.
    # The quotient dessin D_N has faces corresponding to the orbits of N on F.
    # Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit, so D_N has one face,
    # meaning it is unicellular.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # (b) Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group
    # of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    # A smooth covering requires that the kernel N has a trivial intersection with the
    # cyclic groups generated by the vertex and face rotation permutations.
    # - Type AS (Almost Simple): It is a known result that this is not possible.
    # - Type HA (Holomorph of Abelian) and TW (Twisted Wreath): Constructions for
    #   such smooth coverings exist and are known in the literature.
    # Thus, the possible types are HA and TW.
    answer_b = "HA, TW"

    # (c) True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth
    # covering of D_N.
    # False. There are known constructions of regular maps (a type of dessin) that
    # are smooth coverings and have automorphism groups of type TW for small l.
    # For example, constructions exist for G = A_n wr C_2, where l=2.
    # Since a counterexample exists for l=2 (which is <= 5), the statement is False.
    answer_c = "False"

    # Combine the answers into the final formatted string.
    final_answer_string = f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}; (c) {answer_c}"
