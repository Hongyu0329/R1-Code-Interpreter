    "This is a music theory question. I will identify the song by recalling the chord progressions of famous Beatles songs. The specific progression is from the tonic chord (the \"home\" chord of the key, designated as I) to the minor fifth chord (the chord built on the fifth note of the scale, but made minor, designated as v).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to know which Beatles song starts with a I -> v chord progression.\n2.  **Recall Beatles Intros:** I will mentally scan the openings of well-known Beatles songs.\n3.  **Identify the Song:** The song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* is famous for this exact opening.\n4.  **Analyze the Chords of \"Michelle\":**\n    *   The song is in the key of F major. The tonic chord (I) is therefore F major.\n    *   The fifth note in the key of F major is C. The standard dominant fifth chord (V) would be C major.\n    *   However, the song famously jumps from the F major chord to a C *minor* chord. This C minor is the minor fifth (v) in the key of F.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will create a simple Python script that prints out the explanation and the name of the song, as there is no computation to be performed.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song that starts with a chord jump\n    from the tonic to the minor fifth and explains the music theory behind it.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    key = \"F Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the breakdown:\")\n    print(f\"1.

In the key of {key}, the fifth note is C. A C minor chord is therefore the minor fifth (v).\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe progression is {tonic_chord} -> {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
