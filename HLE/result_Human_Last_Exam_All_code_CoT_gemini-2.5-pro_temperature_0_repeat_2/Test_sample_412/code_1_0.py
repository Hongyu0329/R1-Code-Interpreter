Let's analyze the problem step-by-step to find the property equivalent to the continuity of a map $f: X \\to Y$.

**1. Standard Definition of Continuity**

A function $f$ is continuous at a standard point $x_0 \\in X$ if for every open neighborhood $V$ of $f(x_0)$, there exists an open neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V$. The function $f$ is continuous on $X$ if it is continuous at every point in $X$.

**2. Key Concepts in Nonstandard Analysis**

*   **Nonstandard Extension ($X^*$):** For any topological space $X$, its nonstandard extension $X^*$ is a larger space containing the original "standard" points from $X$ as well as new "nonstandard" points.
*   **Infinitesimally Close ($\\sim$):** Two points $a, b \\in X^*$ are infinitesimally close, written $a \\sim b$, if they belong to the same monad. For a standard point $x \\in X$, its monad, $\\mu(x)$, is the set of all points $y \\in X^*$ such that $y \\sim x$. This means that for every standard open neighborhood $U$ of $x$, the point $y$ is in the nonstandard extension $U^*$ of $U$.
*   **Important Note:** For two standard points $x_0, x_1 \\in X$, the relation $x_0 \\sim x_1$ holds if and only if $x_0 = x_1$.

**3. The Infinitesimal Criterion for Continuity**

A fundamental result in nonstandard analysis states that a standard function $f$ is continuous at a standard point $x_0$ if and only if its extension maps every point infinitesimally close to $x_0$ to a point infinitesimally close to $f(x_0)$. For $f$ to be continuous on the entire space $X$, this must hold for all standard points $x_0 \\in X$.

**4. Analysis of the Options**

Let's evaluate each option based on this criterion:

*   **A. $\\forall x_0, x_1 \\in X: x_0 \\sim x_1 \\implies f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1)$**
    Since $x_0$ and $x_1$ are standard points (from $X$), $x_0 \\sim x_1$ is equivalent to $x_0 = x_1$. The statement thus reads: $\\forall x_0, x_1 \\in X: x_0 = x_1 \\implies f(x_0) = f(x_1)$. This is simply the definition of a well-defined function and holds for any map, continuous or not.

*   **B. $\\forall x_0 \\in X, \\forall x_1 \\in X^*: x_0 \\sim x_1 \\implies f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1)$**
    This statement says that for any standard point $x_0$, if a (possibly nonstandard) point $x_1$ is infinitesimally close to $x_0$, then its image $f(x_1)$ is infinitesimally close to $f(x_0)$. This is precisely the infinitesimal criterion for continuity discussed above. It is a well-established theorem that this property is equivalent to standard continuity.

*   **C. $\\forall x_0, x_1 \\in X^*: x_0 \\sim x_1 \\implies f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1)$**
    This is a stronger condition known as **S-continuity** or **microcontinuity**. It requires the property to hold for any pair of infinitesimally close points, even if both are nonstandard. The standard continuous function $f(x) = x^2$ on $\\mathbb{R}$ is a counterexample. Let $H$ be an infinite hyperreal number. Then $H \\sim H + 1/H$, but $f(H+1/H) - f(H) = (H+1/H)^2 - H^2 = 2 + 1/H^2$, which is not infinitesimal. Thus, C is not equivalent to continuity.

*   **D. $\\forall x_0, x_1 \\in X: f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1) \\implies x_0 \\sim x_1$**
    For standard points, this means $f(x_0) = f(x_1) \\implies x_0 = x_1$. This is the definition of an **injective** (one-to-one) function, which is unrelated to continuity.

*   **E. $\\forall x_0 \\in X, \\forall x_1 \\in X^*: f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1) \\implies x_0 \\sim x_1$**
    This is the converse of B. It is not equivalent to continuity. Consider the continuous constant function $f(x) = c$. Let $x_0=1, x_1=2$. Then $f(x_0)=c$ and $f(x_1)=c$, so $f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1)$. However, $x_0 \\not\\sim x_1$ (since $1 \\neq 2$). This property fails for many continuous functions.

*   **F. $\\forall x_0, x_1 \\in X^*: f(x_0) \\sim f(x_1) \\implies x_0 \\sim x_1$**
    This is the converse of C and a stronger version of E. The same counterexample of the constant function shows this is not equivalent to continuity.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis, property B is the only one that is equivalent to the standard definition of continuity for a map $f: X \\to Y$.
