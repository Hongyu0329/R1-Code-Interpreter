Here is a step-by-step explanation of the chemical transformations:

**1. Reaction 1: Starting Material to Product A**

*   **Starting Material:** [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene. Its structure is a phenyl group attached to a butyl chain with a bromine atom at position 3, having an (S) configuration. (Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH(Br)-CH₃)
*   **Reagents & Reaction:** The starting material is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), which is a strong and sterically bulky base. These conditions favor an E2 elimination reaction. Because the base is bulky, it preferentially abstracts a proton from the less sterically hindered terminal methyl group (the Hofmann pathway) over the more hindered internal carbon.
*   **Product A:** The major product is the less substituted alkene, **4-phenylbut-1-ene** (Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH₂). The chiral center at carbon-3 is destroyed during the formation of the double bond, so product A is achiral.

**2. Reaction 2: Product A to Product B**

*   **Reagents & Reaction:** Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene) is treated with borane in THF (BH₃·THF), followed by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). This is a **hydroboration-oxidation** reaction. This process adds an H and an OH group across the double bond with **anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity**. This means the hydroxyl (-OH) group adds to the carbon atom of the double bond that has more hydrogen atoms (the less substituted carbon).
*   **Product B:** For 4-phenylbut-1-ene, the -OH group adds to the terminal carbon (C1). The resulting product is **4-phenylbutan-1-ol** (Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂OH). This molecule is achiral.

**3. Reaction 3: Product B to Product C**

*   **Reagents & Reaction:** Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol) is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr₃). This is a standard reagent for converting a primary alcohol into a primary alkyl bromide. The reaction proceeds via an SN2-type mechanism.
*   **Product C:** The hydroxyl group of 4-phenylbutan-1-ol is replaced by a bromine atom to yield the final product, C.

**Identity of the Final Product (C)**

*   **IUPAC Name:** The final product, C, is **(4-bromobutyl)benzene**.
*   **Chirality:** The molecule (4-bromobutyl)benzene (Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂Br) has no chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different substituents. Since no carbon atom in the final product meets this requirement, **product C is achiral**. The initial chirality of the starting material was lost in the first elimination step and was not reintroduced in subsequent steps.
