    This script calculates the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for a specific Lagrangian.

    The problem involves a Lagrangian submanifold in the complex 4-dimensional projective space (CP^4).
    This Lagrangian is constructed by a twofold iterated Biran lift of a Chekanov torus,
    which is originally a Lagrangian in CP^2.

    The calculation proceeds as follows:
    1. Start with the base number of Maslov 2 disks for the Chekanov torus in CP^2.
    2. For each Biran lift (from CP^(k-1) to CP^k), add the number of new disks created.
