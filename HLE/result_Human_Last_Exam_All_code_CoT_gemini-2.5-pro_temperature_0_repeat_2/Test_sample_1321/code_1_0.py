    # Q10, Q11, Q12: 1D case.
    # In 1D, to place k=2, we need a sum of 2, which must be 1+1. This creates a '1,2,1' block.
    # The newly placed '2' has its two neighbors occupied by '1's.
    # No empty cell can be adjacent to this '2'.
    # Therefore, '2' can never contribute to a neighbor sum for placing a future number.
    # All subsequent sums must be formed from '1's, which can only be 1 or 2.
    # Thus, k=3 can never be placed. So, a(n)<=2 for any n.
    # For n>=2, we can place 1s at positions 0 and 2, then place 2 at 1. So a(n)=2 for n>=2.
