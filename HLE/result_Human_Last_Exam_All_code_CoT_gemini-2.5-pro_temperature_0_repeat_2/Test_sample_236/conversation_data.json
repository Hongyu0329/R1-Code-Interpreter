    "To solve this problem, we need to identify all knots with four or fewer crossings, determine which integral surgeries on them result in homology spheres, and then count how many distinct homology cobordism classes these spheres represent.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **List Knots:** Identify all distinct knots with a crossing number of 4 or less. This includes the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). We must also consider chirality, so we'll look at both the right-handed and left-handed trefoil.\n2.  **Identify Homology Spheres:** An integral Dehn surgery on a knot K, denoted `S³_n(K)`, results in a homology 3-sphere if and only if the surgery coefficient `n` is either `+1` or `-1`.\n3.  **Determine Homology Cobordism Class:** The resulting homology sphere `S³_n(K)` (for n=±1) represents the trivial element in the homology cobordism group if and only if its Rohlin invariant is zero. This, in turn, is true if and only if the signature of the knot, `σ(K)`, is a multiple of 8.\n4.  **Count Unique Elements:** We will examine each knot:\n    *   **Unknot (0_1):** Signature `σ(0_1) = 0`. Since 0 is a multiple of 8, both `+1` and `-1` surgeries yield the trivial element.\n    *   **Figure-eight knot (4_1):** Signature `σ(4_1) = 0`. Since 0 is a multiple of 8, both surgeries yield the trivial element.\n    *   **Trefoil knot (3_1):** The right-handed trefoil has signature `σ(RH 3_1) = -2`. Since -2 is not a multiple of 8, its surgeries yield non-trivial elements. The `+1` surgery gives the Poincaré homology sphere (P), and the `-1` surgery gives its inverse (-P). The left-handed trefoil (`σ(LH 3_1) = +2`) similarly yields -P and P for `+1` and `-1` surgeries, respectively.\n5.  **Summing Up:** By collecting all the unique elements, we find the trivial element (from the unknot and figure-eight), the Poincaré sphere P, and its inverse -P (both from the trefoil knot).\n\nThe following Python script automates this counting process by encoding the properties of these knots and applying the rules of homology cobordism.\n\n```python\ndef count_homology_cobordism_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of homology cobordism group elements representable\n    by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define knots with at most 4 crossings and their signatures.\n    # We consider right-handed (RH) and left-handed (LH) versions for chiral knots.\n    # The figure-eight knot (4_1) is amphichiral, so one entry suffices.\n    knots = {\n        'Unknot (0_1)': 0,\n        'Right-handed Trefoil (3_1)': -2,\n        'Left-handed Trefoil (-3_1)': 2,\n        'Figure-eight knot (4_1)': 0\n    }\n\n    # This set will store the unique elements found.
