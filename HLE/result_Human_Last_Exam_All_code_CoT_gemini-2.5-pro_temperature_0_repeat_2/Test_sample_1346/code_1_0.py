# The user wants me to solve a math problem using Python.
# The problem is to calculate a(p^4+4p^3-5p^2-3p+8) mod p for two primes p,
# where a(n) is the number of ways to tile a 3x(2n) rectangle with dominoes.

# Step 1: Find the recurrence relation for a(n).
# This is a known result from combinatorics. The number of tilings of a 3x(2n)
# rectangle with 1x2 dominoes follows the recurrence:
# a(n) = 4*a(n-1) - a(n-2)
# with initial conditions a(0) = 1 (the empty tiling) and a(1) = 3.

    """
    Calculates a(k) using the recurrence relation.
    a(n) = 4*a(n-1) - a(n-2) with a(0)=1, a(1)=3.

        a_prev = a_curr
        a_curr = a_next
        
    return a_curr

# Step 2: Analyze the behavior of a(n) mod p.
# The behavior depends on the roots of the characteristic equation x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0 mod p.
# The discriminant is D = 16 - 4 = 12. The behavior depends on whether 12 is a
# quadratic residue mod p, which is the same as whether 3 is a quadratic residue mod p.
# We use the Legendre symbol (3/p).

# Case 1: (3/p) = 1. The characteristic equation has roots in F_p.
# The sequence a(n) mod p has a period dividing p-1.
# So, a(N) mod p = a(N mod (p-1)) mod p.
# Let N(p) = p^4+4p^3-5p^2-3p+8.
# Since p = 1 (mod p-1), we have N mod (p-1) = 1+4-5-3+8 = 5.

# Case 2: (3/p) = -1. The characteristic equation has roots in F_{p^2}.
# The sequence a(n) mod p has a property a(k) = a(k - (p+1)) mod p.
# So, a(N) mod p = a(N mod (p+1)) mod p.
# Since p = -1 (mod p+1), we have N mod (p+1) = (-1)^4+4(-1)^3-5(-1)^2-3(-1)+8 = 1-4-5+3+8 = 3.
