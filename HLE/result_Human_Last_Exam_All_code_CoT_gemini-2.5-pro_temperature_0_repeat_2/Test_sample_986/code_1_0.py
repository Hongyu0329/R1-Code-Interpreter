    print("\n1. Understanding the Graph X:")
    print("  - The problem defines a directed graph G with vertices as real numbers (R) and a directed edge (x, y) if x < y.")
    print("  - X is the line graph of G. A vertex in X represents an edge from G, so it's a pair (x, y) with x < y.")
    print("  - The clique number of X refers to the clique number of its underlying undirected graph.")
    print("  - Two vertices in X, u=(x1, y1) and v=(x2, y2), are adjacent if one 'ends' where the other 'begins'.")
    print("  - Adjacency condition: y1 = x2 or y2 = x1.")

    print("\n2. Checking for a 2-Clique (a clique of size 2):")
    print("  - A 2-clique is just an edge. We need to see if any two vertices in X are connected.")
    print("  - Let's pick three real numbers a < b < c. For example, a=1, b=2, c=3.")
    print("  - Let vertex v1 = (a, b) and vertex v2 = (b, c).")
    print("  - In our example, v1 = (1, 2) and v2 = (2, 3).")
    print("  - To check for adjacency, we see if the head of v1 (y1=2) equals the tail of v2 (x2=2).")
    print("  - The adjacency equation is y1 = x2.")
    print(f"  - For our example, the numbers in the equation are: {2} = {2}.")
    print("  - Since the condition holds, v1 and v2 are adjacent. A 2-clique exists.")
    print("  - Therefore, the clique number is at least 2.")

    print("\n3. Checking for a 3-Clique (a clique of size 3):")
    print("  - Let's assume a 3-clique exists, with vertices v1=(x1, y1), v2=(x2, y2), v3=(x3, y3).")
    print("  - For them to form a clique, every pair must be adjacent.")
    print("  - This leads to a set of conditions. We can analyze the structure of these connections.")
    print("  - Any such structure must be a tournament on the indices {1, 2, 3}. Let's test the possibilities.")
    
    print("\n  Case A: The connections form a 3-cycle (e.g., v1 -> v2 -> v3 -> v1).")
    print("    - This implies the following set of equations:")
    print("      y1 = x2")
    print("      y2 = x3")
    print("      y3 = x1")
    print("    - The definition of the vertices requires inequalities:")
    print("      x1 < y1  (from v1)")
    print("      x2 < y2  => y1 < y2 (from v2, substituting y1=x2)")
    print("      x3 < y3  => y2 < x1 (from v3, substituting y2=x3 and y3=x1)")
    print("    - Combining these gives the final inequality: x1 < y1 < y2 < x1.")
    print("    - This is a contradiction, as it implies x1 < x1. So this case is impossible.")

    print("\n  Case B: The connections form a transitive tournament (e.g., v1 connects to v2 and v3, and v2 connects to v3).")
    print("    - This implies the following set of equations:")
    print("      y1 = x2")
    print("      y1 = x3")
    print("      y2 = x3")
    print("    - From the first two, we get x2 = x3.")
    print("    - The third equation then becomes y2 = x2.")
    print("    - However, vertex v2=(x2, y2) requires the inequality x2 < y2.")
    print("    - This leads to the contradictory final statement: x2 < x2. So this case is also impossible.")

    print("\n4. Conclusion:")
    print("  - We have shown that a 2-clique exists, but any attempt to form a 3-clique leads to a logical contradiction.")
    print("  - Therefore, the size of the largest possible clique is 2.")
    
    clique_number = 2
