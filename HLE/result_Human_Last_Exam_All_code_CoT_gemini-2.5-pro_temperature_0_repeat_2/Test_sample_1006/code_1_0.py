The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact space X with two properties:
1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R.
2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends uniquely to a continuous function on X.

This set of properties uniquely identifies the topological space X up to homeomorphism. Here's why:

- The properties describe X as a 'compactification' of the long ray R.
- Property (2) is the universal mapping property that defines the Stone-Cech compactification, denoted as beta R.
- The Stone-Cech compactification of a space is unique up to homeomorphism. Any compactification that satisfies this universal extension property for bounded real-valued functions must be homeomorphic to the Stone-Cech compactification.
- Therefore, any space X that meets the given criteria must be homeomorphic to beta R.
- Since all such spaces X are homeomorphic to the same space (beta R), they are all homeomorphic to each other.
- This means they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.
