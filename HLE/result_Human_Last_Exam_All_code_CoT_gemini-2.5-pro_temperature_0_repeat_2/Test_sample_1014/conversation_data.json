    "My plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881 is as follows:\n1.  I will write a Python function that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2.  The function will first handle the factor of 2 by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 until it is odd. If 2 is a factor, it will be recorded as the largest prime found so far.\n3.  Next, since `n` is now odd, I will iterate through odd numbers `i` (starting from 3) up to the square root of the current value of `n`.\n4.  For each `i`, I will check if it divides `n`. If it does, I will update the largest prime factor to `i` and divide `n` by `i` repeatedly until it's no longer divisible.\n5.  After the loop, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, it means this remaining number is a prime factor itself and must be the largest one.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the original number and its largest prime divisor. The instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" will be interpreted as printing a clear statement showing the relationship between the input number and its largest prime factor.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the largest prime divisor of a given number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    largest_prime = -1\n\n    # Handle the case of factor 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        largest_prime = 2\n        n //= 2\n\n    # n must be odd at this point.\n    # So we can skip even numbers in our search.\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            largest_prime = i\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2. If n was reduced to 1, this won't execute.\n    # If n remains, it's the largest prime factor.\n    if n > 1:\n        largest_prime = n\n\n    # Per the instructions, outputting the numbers in a final \"equation\" format.\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {largest_prime}\")\n\n# The number we need to analyze\nnumber = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number)\n```\n<<<3461>>>"
