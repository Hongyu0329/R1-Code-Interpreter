    # Let's assume the beam can be described by a set of N spatial modes.
    # A spatial mode is a fundamental shape of the beam's cross-section (like a pixel or a Laguerre-Gaussian mode).
    N = 100  # We can choose any number > 0 for N; the conclusion is the same.

    # --- Step 1: Calculate the required Degrees of Freedom for the Output ---
    # An arbitrary vector beam has a spatially varying polarization.
    # This means for each of the N spatial modes, we must be able to define the
    # complex amplitude for two orthogonal polarization components (e.g., horizontal and vertical).
    # DOF per mode = 2 (one for each polarization component).
    # Total DOF for an arbitrary vector beam = N modes * 2 polarizations.

    # --- Step 2: Calculate the available Degrees of Freedom at the Input ---
    # The input beam has a fixed linear polarization.
    # This means we can only control the complex amplitude for one polarization component.
    # The other polarization component is always zero.
    # DOF per mode = 1 (for the single fixed polarization).
    # Total controllable DOF at the input = N modes * 1 polarization.

    # --- Step 3: Compare the DOF and conclude ---
    # A linear system (like the one described) cannot create more degrees of freedom
    # than are provided at the input. To generate any arbitrary vector beam, the
    # number of controllable input DOFs must be at least equal to the required output DOFs.
