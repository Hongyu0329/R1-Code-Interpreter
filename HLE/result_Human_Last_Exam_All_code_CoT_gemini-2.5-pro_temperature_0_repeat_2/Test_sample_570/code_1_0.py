    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines
    px + qy = 1, where p and q are coprime integers.

    The optimal shape is a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with
    vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).

    This diamond can be viewed as two triangles:
    1. Triangle 1 with vertices (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0).
    2. Triangle 2 with vertices (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0).

    We calculate the area of one triangle and multiply by 2.
    Let's take Triangle 1. Its base can be the segment from (-1, 0) to (1, 0).
    The height is the perpendicular distance from the vertex (0, 1) to the base.
