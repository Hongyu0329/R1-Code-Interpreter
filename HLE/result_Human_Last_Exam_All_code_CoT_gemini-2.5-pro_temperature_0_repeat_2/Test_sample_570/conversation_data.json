    "This is a classic problem in convex geometry and the geometry of numbers. The minimal area of such a convex domain is 2.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Rephrase the Problem**: The condition that a convex set `K` intersects a line `px + qy = 1` can be expressed using the support function of `K`, denoted `h_K(v) = sup_{x in K} <x, v>`. The condition for intersection is `-h_K(-v) <= 1 <= h_K(v)` for `v = (p, q)`.\n2.  **Simplify the Condition**: The set of vectors `v = (p, q)` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers is centrally symmetric (if `v` is in the set, so is `-v`). This means `K` must intersect both `px + qy = 1` and `-px - qy = 1`. This leads to the simplified condition `h_K(v) >= 1` for all such vectors `v`.\n3.  **Use Duality**: The problem can be solved by considering the polar dual `K*` of the convex set `K`. Minimizing the area of `K` is related to maximizing the area of `K*`. The condition `h_K(v) >= 1` translates to the condition that the interior of `K*` cannot contain any primitive integer vectors `(p, q)`.\n4.  **Find the Optimal Shape**: The convex set `K*` with the largest area whose interior contains no non-zero integer points is a square of area 4 (by Minkowski's theorem). A specific example is the square `Q = [-1, 1] x [-1, 1]`.\n5.  **Find the Minimal Area**: Using the relationship between the area of a set and its polar dual (specifically, the Mahler conjecture, which is a theorem in 2D), `Area(K) * Area(K*) >= 8`. This gives a lower bound for the area of any centrally symmetric solution: `Area(K) >= 8 / 4 = 2`.\n6.  **Construct the Solution**: This lower bound of 2 is achieved by the polar dual of the square `Q`. This set is the diamond (a square rotated by 45Â°) defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\n7.  **Calculate the Area**: The final step is to calculate the area of this diamond shape. It can be seen as two triangles joined at the base. I will write a Python script to perform and display this calculation.\n\nThe Python code below calculates the area of the optimal diamond shape `|x| + |y| <= 1`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_minimal_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal area of a convex domain that intersects all lines\n    px + qy = 1, where p and q are coprime integers.\n\n    The optimal shape is a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with\n    vertices at (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1).\n\n    This diamond can be viewed as two triangles:\n    1.
