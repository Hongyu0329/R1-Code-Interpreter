    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, the Chern number of the resulting junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. The negligible tunneling barrier implies that the two systems are strongly coupled, effectively forming a single, wider topological insulator.\n\nThe Chern number is a topological invariant that determines the quantized Hall conductance of a two-dimensional system according to the formula σ_xy = C * (e^2/h), where C is the Chern number, e is the elementary charge, and h is Planck's constant. When two conductors are placed in parallel, their conductances add up. In this case, the total Hall conductance of the combined system is the sum of the conductances of the two individual Chern insulators.\n\nTherefore, the total Hall conductance is:\nσ_total = σ_1 + σ_2 = 1 * (e^2/h) + 1 * (e^2/h) = 2 * (e^2/h)\n\nFrom this, the Chern number of the combined system, C_junction, can be determined:\nC_junction = σ_total / (e^2/h) = 2\n\nThis conclusion is also supported by the bulk-boundary correspondence principle. Each Chern insulator with C=1 possesses one chiral edge state on each of its boundaries. When the two insulators are joined laterally, their outer edge states combine. The new, wider system will have two parallel chiral edge states on its top boundary and two on its bottom boundary, corresponding to a total Chern number of 2. At the interface where the two insulators are joined, the number of chiral edge states is given by the difference between their Chern numbers, which is |C₁ - C₂| = |1 - 1| = 0. This means there are no net chiral states at the internal junction, allowing for unimpeded transport between the two regions, which is consistent with a negligible tunneling barrier. Studies on stacked and heterostructure systems also support the idea that Chern numbers can be additive.\n\n<<<2>>>"
