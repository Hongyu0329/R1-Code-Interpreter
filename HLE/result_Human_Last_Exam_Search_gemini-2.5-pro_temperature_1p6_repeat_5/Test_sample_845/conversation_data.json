    "When HR (Heart Rate) and HRV (Heart Rate Variability) are tracked by capturing beat-to-beat intervals using PPG (photoplethysmography), the value computed between heartbeats is called the **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**.\n\nMore specifically, when using PPG technology which measures the pulse wave, this interval can be referred to as the **Pulse-to-Pulse (PP) interval**. This is to distinguish it from the \"RR interval,\" which is the term used when measurements are taken with an electrocardiogram (ECG).\n\nIn essence, while \"beat-to-beat interval\" is a correct general description, the most common and technically accurate terms in the context of PPG are:\n\n*   **Interbeat Interval (IBI)**: A widely used term for the time between consecutive heartbeats.\n*   **Pulse-to-Pulse (PP) interval**: A more specific term for the interval measured between consecutive pulse waves detected by PPG.\n\nThis interval is typically measured in milliseconds. The variation of these intervals over time is what constitutes Heart Rate Variability.\n\n<<<Interbeat Interval (IBI) or Pulse-to-Pulse (PP) interval>>>"
