    "The searches in step 2 have provided significant details on three promising remote islands: Tristan da Cunha, Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island.\n\nFor Tristan da Cunha, the main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. The island is volcanic and extremely remote. However, while the settlement is at the base of a volcano, Queen Mary's Peak, it is not explicitly described as being on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera that shares the town's name. It's on the northwest coast on a flat area.\n\nFor Pitcairn Island, the only settlement is Adamstown, located near Bounty Bay. The island is described as a remnant of a shield volcano with a dissected caldera, and Adamstown lies within the volcanic basin. It is very isolated. The names \"Adamstown\" and \"Bounty Bay\" are different.\n\nFor Easter Island, the main town is Hanga Roa, which means \"Long Bay\" or \"Wide Bay\". The island is volcanic with multiple calderas, including Rano Kau near Hanga Roa. Hanga Roa is situated on the west coast between the extinct volcanoes of Terevaka and Rano Kau. The town is on a bay, but it is not explicitly stated that the bay is a volcanic caldera itself. The bay is named Hanga Roa, sharing its name with the town. Easter Island is extremely isolated.\n\nTo definitively answer the question, the key remaining ambiguity is whether Hanga Roa sits on a bay that *is* a volcanic caldera. Similarly, for Adamstown, is Bounty Bay part of the volcanic caldera? For Tristan da Cunha, is there a bay associated with the settlement that is a caldera?\n\nI need to refine my search to clarify the relationship between the town, the bay, and a volcanic caldera for each of these islands.The research has narrowed down the potential candidates to Tristan da Cunha, Pitcairn Island, and Easter Island.\n\n- **Tristan da Cunha:** The only settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It's located on the northwest coast at the base of the Queen Mary's Peak volcano, but there is no indication that the bay it sits on is a volcanic caldera or that the bay shares the town's name. It overlooks \"Big and Little Beach\".\n\n- **Pitcairn Island:** The only settlement is Adamstown, situated near Bounty Bay. The island is a volcanic remnant with a collapsed caldera, and Adamstown is within this volcanic basin. However, the bay is named Bounty Bay, not Adamstown Bay.\n\n- **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is Hanga Roa. The name \"Hanga Roa\" means \"long bay\" or \"wide bay\" in the Rapa Nui language, and it sits on a bay of the same name. The town is located between the extinct volcanoes Terevaka and Rano Kau. Rano Kau has a large crater lake, and the island has a volcanic origin with several calderas. While Hanga Roa is on a bay, it's not explicitly a caldera itself but is located in the lowlands between volcanoes. The island is extremely isolated, being over 3,500 km from Chile.\n\nBased on the evidence, Hanga Roa on Easter Island fits the criteria most closely. The town's name is the same as the bay it sits on, and it is located on a volcanic island with calderas. The other islands do not have a town and bay that share the same name and are formed by a volcanic caldera. I have sufficient information to answer the question.\n\nHanga Roa, the main town and capital of Easter Island (a Chilean dependency), is situated on Hanga Roa Bay. The name \"Hanga Roa\" translates to \"long bay\" or \"wide bay\" in the Rapa Nui language. This remote island town is located more than 3,500 kilometers west of mainland Chile.\n\nEaster Island is of volcanic origin, shaped by three main extinct volcanoes: Terevaka, Poike, and Rano Kau. The town of Hanga Roa is nestled on the island's west coast, in the lowlands between the Terevaka and Rano Kau volcanoes. One of the island's most notable features is the Rano Kau crater, a large volcanic caldera with a crater lake that is located near Hanga Roa. While the town itself is not inside a caldera, it sits on a bay named after the town and is intrinsically linked to the volcanic landscape of the immensely isolated Easter Island.\n\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
