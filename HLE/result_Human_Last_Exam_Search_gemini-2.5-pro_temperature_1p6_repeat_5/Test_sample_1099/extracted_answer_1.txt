The minimal resources required to simulate the correlations of measurement results on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model are, on average:
- **For projective measurements:** 1 bit of classical communication OR 1 non-signaling PR-Box.
- **For general POVM measurements:** 2 bits of classical communication.
