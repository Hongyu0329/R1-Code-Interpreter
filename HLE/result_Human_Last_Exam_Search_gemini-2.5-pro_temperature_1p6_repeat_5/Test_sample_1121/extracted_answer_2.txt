In summary, for a distance-3 surface code assuming a viable physical error rate of 0.1%, the approximate number of physical non-Clifford gates required to generate one logical non-Clifford gate is in the low hundreds (around 200-300). However, for a distance-5 surface code with a high faulty gate error rate of 1%, the system is operating at the fault-tolerance threshold, making it infeasible to implement a universal quantum computer. The error correction would fail to suppress errors effectively, and thus a meaningful number of required non-Clifford gates cannot be provided as the process would not succeed.
