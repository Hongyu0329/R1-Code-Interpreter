    "To find the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ), we can systematically categorize expressions by their structure and length. The precedence of operators is ! > & > |. For operators of the same precedence, we assume left-associativity.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the valid structures for true expressions of exactly 5 symbols:\n\n### Type A: Expressions without external parentheses\n\nThese are expressions whose top-level structure is not enclosed in parentheses.\n\n1.  **`L op L op L`**: Three literals and two operators.\n    *   `L & L & L`: This is true only if all literals are `T`. This gives one expression: `T & T & T`.\n    *   `L | L | L`: This is true if at least one literal is `T`. With three literals, there are 2Â³ = 8 combinations, only one of which is false (`F | F | F`). This gives 8 - 1 = 7 true expressions.\n    *   `L & L | L`: Parsed as `(L & L) | L`. This is true if `L3` is `T` (4 combinations for L1, L2) or if `L1` and `L2` are `T` and `L3` is `F` (`T & T | F`). This gives 4 + 1 = 5 true expressions.\n    *   `L | L & L`: Parsed as `L | (L & L)`. This is true if `L1` is `T` (4 combinations for L2, L3) or if `L2` and `L3` are `T` and `L1` is `F` (`F | T & T`). This gives 4 + 1 = 5 true expressions.\n    *   Total for this type: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = **18 expressions**.\n\n2.  **`!L op !L`**: Two `!L` expressions joined by an operator. The length is 2 (!L) + 1 (op) + 2 (!L) = 5.\n    *   `!L & !L`: This is true only if both `!L` are true, meaning both literals are `F`. One expression: `!F & !F`.\n    *   `!L | !L`: This is true if at least one `!L` is true. It is false only if both are false (`!T | !T`). This gives 3 true expressions: `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, and `!F | !F`.\n    *   Total for this type: 1 + 3 = **4 expressions**.\n\n3.  **`!!L op L` and `L op !!L`**: A literal combined with a double-negated literal. The length is 3 (!!L) + 1 (op) + 1 (L) = 5.\n    *   `!!L & L` and `L & !!L`: True only if both operands are true. `!!T` is true. Thus, `!!T & T` and `T & !!T` are the two true expressions.\n    *   `!!L | L` and `L | !!L`: True if at least one operand is true.\n        *   `!!L | L'`: `!!T | T`, `!!T | F`, `!!F | T`. (3 expressions)\n        *   `L | !!L'`: `T | !!T`, `T | !!F`, `F | !!T`. (3 expressions)\n    *   Total for this type: 2 + 3 + 3 = **8 expressions**.\n\n### Type B: Expressions with external parentheses or a leading NOT\n\nThese expressions' top-level structure is either `(E)` or `!E`.\n\n1.  **`(E)` where E is a true expression of length 3**:\n    *   `E` is `L op L`: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. Placing parentheses around these gives 4 true expressions of length 5: `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`.\n    *   `E` is `!!L`: `!!T` is a true expression of length 3. This gives `(!!T)`.\n    *   `E` is `(L)`: `(T)` is a true expression of length 3. This gives `((T))`.\n    *   Total for this type: 4 + 1 + 1 = **6 expressions**.\n\n2.  **`!E` where E is a false expression of length 4**:\n    *   `E` is `!(L)`: The expression `!(T)` has length 4 and is false. `!E` becomes `!!(T)`, which is a true expression of length 5.\n    *   `E` is `((L))`: The expression `((F))` has length 4 and is false. `!E` becomes `!((F))`, which is a true expression of length 5.\n    *   `E` is of the form `L op !L'` or `!L op L'`: We list the false expressions of this form:\n        *   Using `&`: `T&!T`, `F&!T`, `F&!F`, `!T&T`, `!T&F` (5 expressions).\n        *   Using `|`: `F|!T`, `!T|F` (2 expressions).\n        *   There are 7 such false expressions. Placing `!` in front of each makes them true. E.g., `!(T&!T)`. This gives **7 true expressions**.\n    *   Total for this type: 1 + 1 + 7 = **9 expressions**.\n\nSumming up all the non-overlapping categories:\n18 (from A1) + 4 (from A2) + 8 (from A3) + 6 (from B1) + 9 (from B2) = **45**.\n\n<<<45>>>"
