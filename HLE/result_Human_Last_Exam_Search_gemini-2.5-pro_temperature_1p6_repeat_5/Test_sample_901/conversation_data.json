    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The major product formed in this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1.  **Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, which is a secondary alkyl halide. Potassium tert-butoxide (KOC(CH₃)₃) is a strong, sterically bulky base. The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong base favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n\n2.  **Stereochemical Requirement for E2 Reactions**: The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the hydrogen atom to be eliminated and the leaving group (in this case, bromine) must be in an anti-periplanar orientation. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both groups must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (trans-diaxial).\n\n3.  **Conformational Analysis**: The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, has a *cis* relationship between the bromine and methyl groups. For the E2 elimination to occur, the bromine atom must occupy an axial position. In the required chair conformation, the bulky methyl group will consequently occupy the more stable equatorial position. In this conformation, there are two different beta-hydrogens (hydrogens on carbons adjacent to the carbon with the bromine) that are anti-periplanar to the axial bromine: one on carbon 2 and one on carbon 6.\n\n4.  **Regioselectivity (Zaitsev vs. Hofmann Rule)**:\n    *   Elimination of the hydrogen from carbon 2 would form 1-methylcyclohexene (the **Zaitsev product**), which is a more substituted and more stable alkene.\n    *   Elimination of the hydrogen from carbon 6 would form 3-methylcyclohexene (the **Hofmann product**), which is a less substituted and less stable alkene.\n\n5.  **Effect of the Bulky Base**: Potassium tert-butoxide is a sterically hindered (bulky) base. Due to its large size, it preferentially removes the most accessible, least sterically hindered proton. The hydrogen on carbon 6 is more accessible than the hydrogen on carbon 2, which is sterically shielded by the adjacent methyl group. Therefore, the reaction favors the formation of the Hofmann product.\n\nThe major product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
