    "Based on the principles of coiled-coil protein design, the oligomeric state is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat. A detailed analysis of the provided sequences leads to the following predictions:\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: When aligned to a heptad repeat, the core 'a' and 'd' positions are predominantly occupied by Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L) respectively. This combination is a well-established motif for the formation of a **dimer**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: The hydrophobic core of this sequence is primarily composed of Alanine (A) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. The presence of a polar Asparagine (N) residue in one of the core 'd' positions is a feature often used to ensure the specificity of a **dimer**.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: In this sequence, the 'a' and 'd' positions are both predominantly occupied by Isoleucine (I). This pattern of Isoleucine at both core positions is a strong determinant for the formation of a **tetramer**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: This sequence also follows the classic pattern of Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position and Leucine (L) at the 'd' position, which directs the formation of a **dimer**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: Here, the 'a' positions are occupied by Isoleucine (I), while the 'd' positions are occupied by Threonine (T). The presence of a beta-branched amino acid like Threonine at the 'd' position is a known design principle for creating a **trimer**.\n\nTherefore, the predicted oligomeric states for the given sequences are 2, 2, 4, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<D>>>"
