    "I am unable to provide a precise number for the involutions in PSU(4,997). The calculation requires detailed information about the structure and order of the centralizers of involutions in this group, which has proven difficult to definitively ascertain from available sources.\n\nBased on my research, here is what I can determine:\n\n*   **The Group:** The group in question is the projective special unitary group `G = PSU(4,997)`. For an odd prime power `q`, such as 997, `PSU(4,q)` is a finite simple group.\n\n*   **Order of the Group:** The order of `PSU(4,q)` is given by the formula:\n    `|G| = (1/d) * q^6 * (q^4 - 1) * (q^3 + 1) * (q^2 - 1)`, where `d = gcd(4, q + 1)`.\n    For `q = 997`, we have `d = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    Therefore, the order of PSU(4,997) is:\n    `|PSU(4,997)| = (1/2) * 997^6 * (997^4 - 1) * (997^3 + 1) * (997^2 - 1)`.\n\n*   **Conjugacy Classes of Involutions:** For an odd `q`, the group `PSU(4,q)` has exactly two conjugacy classes of involutions. An involution is an element of order 2. The total number of involutions is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n\n*   **Centralizers and Class Sizes:** The number of involutions in a specific conjugacy class is the order of the group divided by the order of the centralizer of a representative involution from that class.\n    *   One of these conjugacy classes consists of involutions whose centralizer in `PSU(4,q)` has the order `q^2 * (q^4 - 1)`. For `q=997`, this is `997^2 * (997^4 - 1)`. The size of this class is `(q^4 * (q^3 + 1) * (q^2 - 1)) / gcd(4, q + 1)`.\n    *   I have been unable to find a verifiable formula for the order of the centralizer of the second class of involutions. While values for specific small `q` are available in resources like the ATLAS of Finite Groups, a general formula that can be confidently applied to `q=997` is not readily available in the searched literature. Different sources provide complex structural descriptions that are not straightforward to translate into an order, or they contain formulas that could not be independently verified against known values.\n\nWithout a reliable formula for the size of the second conjugacy class of involutions, a final numerical answer cannot be computed.\n\n"
