    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is Dr. Snaut who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth. This is a nuanced aspect of his character, who often expresses a deep sense of disillusionment and melancholy about humanity's venture into space.\n\nOne of the ways Snaut's longing for Earth manifests is through his attempt to replicate the sound of leaves. He attaches strips of paper to an air vent, and at night, the moving air creates a sound reminiscent of rustling leaves. This act reveals his deep-seated homesickness and a sense of being disconnected from his terrestrial roots, a feeling that can be interpreted as a form of shame for having abandoned the natural world.\n\nSnaut's dialogue throughout the film further underscores his feelings of displacement and his belief that humanity is not ready for the cosmos. He famously states, \"We don't want other worlds; we want a mirror,\" and \"Man needs man,\" highlighting his conviction that humanity is seeking a reflection of itself rather than genuine exploration. These philosophical musings are born from the psychological distress of being isolated in the sterile environment of the space station, far from the familiar and comforting sounds and sights of Earth. While other characters, like Kris Kelvin, experience their own forms of guilt and memory, it is Snaut who most clearly demonstrates a longing for the simple, natural phenomena of Earth, such as the sound of leaves.\n\n<<<C>>>"
