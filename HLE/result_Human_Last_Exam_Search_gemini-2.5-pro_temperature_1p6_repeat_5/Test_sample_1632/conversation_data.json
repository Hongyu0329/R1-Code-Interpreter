    "A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The number of such distinct walks of a given length, `n`, is denoted by `a(n)`. For a two-dimensional square lattice, also known as a Manhattan lattice, this value has been calculated for various `n`.\n\nThe number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice is 44,100. There is no simple formula to calculate this number for any given `n`, and the computation becomes exceedingly difficult as `n` increases.\n\nThe sequence of the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411. The known values in this sequence have been determined through computer-intensive enumeration methods. For the first few values of `n`, the number of self-avoiding walks are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(10) = 44,100\n\n<<<44100>>>"
