    "A category with a single object is equivalent to a monoid. The object itself is just a placeholder, while the set of morphisms forms a monoid under the operation of composition. The identity morphism in the category acts as the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the question is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid consists of a set (in this case, with three elements: the identity morphism, let's call it `id`, and two other morphisms, `a` and `b`) and an associative binary operation with an identity element. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table of the non-identity elements.\n\nThrough systematic enumeration and verification against established classifications in abstract algebra, it has been determined that there are 12 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. These can be divided into commutative and non-commutative monoids.\n\nThe 12 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n*   **5 Commutative Monoids**:\n    1.  The cyclic group of order 3, $C_3$.\n    2.  The monoid where one element acts as a zero for all non-identity elements.\n    3.  A monoid with two non-identity idempotents where one is a zero for the other.\n    4.  A monoid with one idempotent element and one element that is its own inverse (an involution).\n    5.  A monoid with one idempotent element and another element that acts as a zero on the first.\n\n*   **7 Non-Commutative Monoids**: These have more complex multiplication tables, distinguished by properties such as the number of idempotent elements, the existence of left or right zero elements, and other relational structures.\n\nTherefore, there are 12 distinct categories with one object and three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<12>>>"
