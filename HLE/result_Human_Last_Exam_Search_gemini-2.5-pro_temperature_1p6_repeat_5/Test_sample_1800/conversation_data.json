    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles exhibit promising catalytic properties for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting (WS), with the ideal nickel-to-cerium ratio being crucial for maximizing performance in each application. The optimal ratio, however, differs significantly between the two reactions due to their distinct mechanisms.\n\n### Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which involves the reaction of carbon monoxide with water to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, a lower nickel concentration is generally favored. Research indicates that an optimal nickel proportion is in the range of **5 to 15 wt%**.\n\nSeveral studies support this finding. For instance, in the reverse WGS reaction, an optimum Ni proportion of around 7% molar has been reported. Other research on Ni/CeO₂ catalysts demonstrated high activity for CO conversion with nickel content ranging from 5 to 12.5 wt%. Another study identified 15 wt% NiO/CeO₂ as both active and stable for CO oxidation. Even at higher concentrations, such as 40% Ni-ceria, the material shows catalytic activity, though the lower ranges are more commonly cited as optimal. These findings suggest that a modest amount of nickel on a ceria support creates a highly efficient catalyst for the WGS reaction.\n\n### Water Splitting (WS)\n\nIn contrast, for water splitting, which encompasses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a significantly higher nickel concentration is beneficial. The ideal ratio appears to be in the range of **a 1:2 to a 3:1 Ni/Ce molar ratio**.\n\nFor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key step in water splitting, Ni-Ceria catalysts with compositions of Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ and Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ have shown enhanced activity. The Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ catalyst, in particular, demonstrated remarkable stability. This corresponds to a 3:1 Ni to Ce ratio. Computational studies corroborate these experimental findings, suggesting that a 3Ni/1Ce ratio provides favorable adsorption energy for the water-splitting reaction.\n\nFor the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a study on Ni₃N-CeO₂/NF catalysts found that a Ce/Ni molar ratio of 2 (Ni₃N-2CeO₂/NF) yielded the best performance. This translates to a 1:2 Ni/Ce ratio (or 33.3% Ni). Furthermore, research on Ni and Fe co-doped ceria for overall water splitting utilized a high doping level of 20 mol% of Ni and Fe in a 1:1 ratio in the ceria, also pointing to a higher metal concentration being effective.\n\nIn summary, the ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts is application-dependent:\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a lower nickel content, typically in the **5-15 wt%** range, is ideal for maximizing catalytic performance.\n*   For **water splitting**, a higher nickel content, with a **Ni/Ce molar ratio between 1:2 and 3:1**, proves to be more effective.\n\nThese differences highlight the importance of tuning the catalyst composition to the specific chemical transformation desired.\n\n<<<The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal performance is typically achieved with a lower nickel concentration, in the range of 5 to 15 wt%. For water splitting (WS), a higher nickel content is more favorable, with ideal Ni/Ce molar ratios ranging from 1:2 to 3:1.>>>"
