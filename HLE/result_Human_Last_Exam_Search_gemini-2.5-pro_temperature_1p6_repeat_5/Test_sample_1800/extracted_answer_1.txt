The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal performance is typically achieved with a lower nickel concentration, in the range of 5 to 15 wt%. For water splitting (WS), a higher nickel content is more favorable, with ideal Ni/Ce molar ratios ranging from 1:2 to 3:1.
