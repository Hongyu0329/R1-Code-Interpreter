    "In the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*), the brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **fin lobes**. The entire brain is encased posteriorly by a layer of cartilage.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is part of a larger group of structures in the subesophageal mass known as the palliovisceral lobe complex. This complex, which is involved in controlling locomotion, includes the palliovisceral lobe itself, the lateral ventral palliovisceral lobes, the fin lobes, the posterior chromatophore lobes, and the dorsal and ventral vasomotor lobes. The palliovisceral lobe specifically is associated with the control of escape movements and the ejection of ink.\n\nDetailed anatomical atlases, such as Cuttlebase.org, which is based on MRI scans and histological data, provide a three-dimensional view of the dwarf cuttlefish brain, illustrating the relative positions of these lobes. These resources confirm that the posterior chromatophore lobes, which control the chromatophores on the mantle, fin, and visceral mass, and the fin lobes, responsible for the movement of the fins, are situated towards the rear of the palliovisceral lobe. <<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the fin lobes.>>>"
