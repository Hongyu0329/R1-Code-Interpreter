    "Answering the question of the earliest known recorded date by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas in an aboriginal writing system reveals a fascinating competition among ancient Mesoamerican cultures. Based on current archaeological evidence, the distinction likely belongs to the Olmec or the Zapotec civilization, with a notable, albeit later, entry from the Maya.\n\nThe earliest, though debated, recorded date is found on an Olmec cylinder seal from San Andrés, Tabasco, Mexico, dated to approximately 650 BCE. The seal contains glyphs that have been interpreted as \"3 Ajaw,\" a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican calendar. This could represent a specific date or the name of a ruler, as it was common in Mesoamerican cultures to be named after one's birthdate. However, some scholars suggest that these symbols may be iconographic rather than a definitive written date.\n\nA stronger, more widely accepted candidate for the earliest recorded date comes from the Zapotec civilization. At the site of San José Mogote in Oaxaca, Mexico, a carved stone monument, known as Monument 3, features glyphs that are interpreted as the calendar day-name \"1 Earthquake.\" This monument is dated to before 500 BCE. The inscription is considered one of the earliest examples of writing in Mesoamerica and directly references a specific day in the Zapotec calendar.\n\nWhile the Olmecs are also credited with the earliest evidence of writing in the Americas, with the discovery of the Cascajal Block dating to around 900 BCE, this artifact does not contain any calendrical dates.\n\nFor a long time, the Maya were thought to hold this record, but their earliest confirmed date is significantly later. A mural fragment discovered in San Bartolo, Guatemala, bears the date \"7 Deer,\" corresponding to a day in the 260-day calendar, and has been dated to between 300 and 200 BCE.\n\nIn summary, while the Olmec seal from San Andrés presents a potential earlier date of 650 BCE, the Zapotec \"1 Earthquake\" glyph from before 500 BCE is a more definitively accepted calendrical record.\n\n<<<The earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is a subject of scholarly discussion, with the primary candidates being an Olmec artifact dated to c. 650 BCE and a Zapotec monument from before 500 BCE. The Olmec cylinder seal from San Andrés, Mexico, features glyphs interpreted as the calendar day \"3 Ajaw\". The Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote displays the widely recognized calendrical glyph for \"1 Earthquake\". While the Olmec artifact is older, its interpretation as a date is debated, whereas the Zapotec glyph is more broadly accepted as a calendrical notation.>>>"
