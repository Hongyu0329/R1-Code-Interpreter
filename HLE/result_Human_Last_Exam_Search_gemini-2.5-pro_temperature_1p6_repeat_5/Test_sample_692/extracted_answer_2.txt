The earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas is a subject of scholarly discussion, with the primary candidates being an Olmec artifact dated to c. 650 BCE and a Zapotec monument from before 500 BCE. The Olmec cylinder seal from San Andrés, Mexico, features glyphs interpreted as the calendar day "3 Ajaw". The Zapotec Monument 3 from San José Mogote displays the widely recognized calendrical glyph for "1 Earthquake". While the Olmec artifact is older, its interpretation as a date is debated, whereas the Zapotec glyph is more broadly accepted as a calendrical notation.
