    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in four primary colors: white (which can also appear yellow), red, black, and violet.\n\nPhosphorus is an element known for existing in various structural forms called allotropes, each with distinct properties, including color. The main allotropes and their corresponding colors are:\n\n*   **White Phosphorus:** This is a translucent, waxy solid. While it is known as white phosphorus, it often has a yellowish appearance due to impurities or degradation, and is sometimes referred to as yellow phosphorus.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** This allotrope is commonly a deep red or reddish-violet powder. Some forms of red phosphorus can also exhibit an iron-grey luster.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** As the most thermodynamically stable form, black phosphorus has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite. It can also appear as a grey crystal.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, this allotrope has a violet or purple color. Depending on the preparation and crystal structure, it can also appear as red-brown or have a steely blue luster.\n\nOther forms of phosphorus, such as blue phosphorus, are typically two-dimensional materials and not observed as a bulk solid with a distinct color. Diphosphorus is a gaseous allotrope found at very high temperatures.\n\n<<<4>>>"
