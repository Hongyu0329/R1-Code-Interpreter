The precise amino acid residues in the human beta-1 subunit that are hotspots for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are located within the Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain, forming a hydrophobic AID-binding pocket. Key residues include a set of highly conserved hydrophobic amino acids. For gating modulation, specific residues within the GK domain are also responsible, and studies on homologous channels suggest that certain negatively charged amino acids and the overall structural integrity of the GK and its interaction with the SH3 domain play a crucial role. Exact residue numbers for the human beta-1 subunit can be inferred from structural data (e.g., PDB: 7XLQ) and its UniProt entry (Q02641). For example, studies on the highly similar beta-4 subunit point to conserved residues like M204, L208, and L350 as being part of the binding pocket. In the human beta-1 subunit, these would correspond to residues in homologous positions within the GK domain. The modulation of gating is a complex process where the binding of the beta-1 subunit, through its GK domain, allosterically influences the gating machinery of the alpha-1 subunit, with studies on Cav2.3 indicating the GK domain itself contains the determinants for inactivation modulation.
