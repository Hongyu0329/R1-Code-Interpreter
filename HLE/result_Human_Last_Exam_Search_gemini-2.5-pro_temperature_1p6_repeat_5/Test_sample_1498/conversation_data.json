    "In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam (The Creed of the Laymen) by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, the names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned in a distinct section.\n\nThe enumeration begins with the verse that introduces the necessity of knowing the twenty-five mentioned prophets:\n\nتَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ\nكُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n\n*Tafṣīlu khamsatin wa ʿishrīna lazim,*\n*Kulla mukallafin faḥaqqiq waghtanim.*\n\n(The details of twenty-five are binding, for every responsible person, so verify and benefit.)\n\nThis is immediately followed by the verses that list the names of the prophets, starting with:\n\nهُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ\nصَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n\n*Hum Ādamu Idrīsu Nūḥun Hūdu maʿ,*\n*Ṣāliḥu wa Ibrāhīmu kullun muttabaʿ.*\n\n(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.)\n\nThe listing of the prophets concludes with the verse that mentions the final prophets by name:\n\nإِلْـيَـاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\nعِـيْـسَـى وَطَـهَ خَاتَمٌ دَعْ غَيًّا\n\n*Ilyāsu Yūnus Zakariyyā Yaḥyā,*\n*ʿĪsā wa Ṭāhā khātamun daʿ ghayyā.*\n\n(Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha [Prophet Muhammad], the seal of the prophets, so leave misguidance.)\n\nTherefore, the section dedicated to the names of the prophets spans from the introductory verse about the twenty-five prophets to the verse that concludes their enumeration.\n\n<<<The names of the Prophets in Islam are mentioned in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' from the verse \"تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ\" (The details of twenty-five are binding) to the verse \"إِلْـيَـاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى\" (Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya).>>>"
