    "During World War II, British counterintelligence, specifically the interrogator Lieutenant-Colonel Oreste Pinto, suspected a Belgian refugee of being a German spy because he claimed to be a waiter but aroused suspicion. This refugee's true profession was that of a **professional circus acrobat and tumbler**.\n\nThe story is one of the documented cases of Oreste Pinto, a Dutch counter-intelligence officer who worked for MI5 during the war. His memoirs, which were popularized in the \"Spycatcher\" books and a subsequent BBC television series, detail his methods of interrogating refugees to uncover enemy agents. In one notable case, a Belgian refugee claimed to have been a hotel waiter for many years. Pinto became suspicious of the man who called himself a \"perfect waiter\". Through a series of questions designed to test his knowledge of the trade, Pinto exposed the man's claim as a lie. The man's hands, despite being well-kept, did not show the tell-tale signs of long-term work in catering, such as nicotine stains from holding ashtrays or small cuts and burns. Ultimately, the man confessed that he was not a waiter but a professional circus acrobat and tumbler. He had concealed his real profession, fearing that the British authorities would not consider it a serious or essential skill and might, therefore, refuse him entry into the country.\n\nWhile the name \"Andre Vernault\" does not appear in the accounts of this case, the details of a Belgian refugee posing as a waiter who was unmasked by Oreste Pinto align with this well-documented incident from Pinto's \"Spycatcher\" files.\n\n<<<professional circus acrobat and tumbler>>>"
