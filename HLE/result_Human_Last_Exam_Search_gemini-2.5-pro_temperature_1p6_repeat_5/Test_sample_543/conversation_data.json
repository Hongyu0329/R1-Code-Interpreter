    "In the reaction between 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene and excess phenyl magnesium bromide in THF, a multiple Grignard cross-coupling reaction occurs. The reactivity of halogens on an aromatic ring towards Grignard reagents follows the order I > Br > Cl. Consequently, the iodine atom at the second position is the most reactive and will be substituted first by a phenyl group.\n\nGiven that phenyl magnesium bromide is used in excess, the reaction will not stop after the first substitution. The two less reactive bromine atoms at positions 1 and 3 will also be replaced by phenyl groups. This type of reaction, coupling a Grignard reagent with an aryl halide, is a variation of the Kumada coupling, especially if catalyzed.\n\nThe aqueous work-up serves to quench any unreacted phenyl magnesium bromide and protonate any intermediates, yielding a neutral final product.\n\nThe final product is a benzene ring where the hydrogen atoms at positions 1, 2, and 3 have been substituted with phenyl groups. The IUPAC name for this compound is 1,2,3-triphenylbenzene.\n\n<<<1,2,3-triphenylbenzene>>>"
