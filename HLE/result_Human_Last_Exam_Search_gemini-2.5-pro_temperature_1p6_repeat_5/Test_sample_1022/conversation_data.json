    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we can use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\nThe Künneth formula for the bounded cohomology of a product of two groups, $G_1$ and $G_2$, with real coefficients is given by the following isomorphism:\n\n$H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} (H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\hat{\\otimes} H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nwhere $\\hat{\\otimes}$ represents the projective topological tensor product. When the cohomology groups are finite-dimensional vector spaces, this simplifies to the standard tensor product of vector spaces. The dimension of the direct sum is the sum of the dimensions of each component, and the dimension of a tensor product of vector spaces is the product of their individual dimensions.\n\nIn our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ (Thompson's group T) and $n=4$. The formula for the dimension is:\n\n$\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim(H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R})) \\cdot \\dim(H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R}))$\n\nThis sum expands to the following terms:\n*   $p=0, q=4: \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=1, q=3: \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=2, q=2: \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=3, q=1: \\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n*   $p=4, q=0: \\dim H_b^4(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n\nNext, we need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T, which is often identified with the group of orientation-preserving piecewise-linear homeomorphisms of the circle, $Homeo_+(S^1)$. The relevant dimensions are:\n*   **$\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$**: For any group, the degree 0 bounded cohomology is the space of constant functions, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n*   **$\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$**: Since T is a simple group, it is a perfect group, meaning its abelianization is trivial. This implies that its first cohomology group $H^1(T, \\mathbb{R})$ is zero, and consequently, the first bounded cohomology group is also zero.\n*   **$\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$**: The second bounded cohomology of T is known to be one-dimensional, generated by the bounded Euler class.\n*   **$\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for $k \\geq 3$**: The higher-degree bounded cohomology groups of T are known to be zero.\n\nNow we can calculate the dimension of each term in the sum:\n*   For $p=0, q=4$: $1 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $p=1, q=3$: $0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $p=2, q=2$: $1 \\cdot 1 = 1$\n*   For $p=3, q=1$: $0 \\cdot 0 = 0$\n*   For $p=4, q=0$: $0 \\cdot 1 = 0$\n\nSumming these dimensions gives the total dimension of $H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$:\n\n$0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1$\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
