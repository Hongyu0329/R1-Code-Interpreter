    "After Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the *Iliad* is **Mount Parnassus**, with a height of 2,457 meters (8,061 feet).\n\nSeveral mountains are referenced in the *Iliad* and associated with Greek mythology, each a real and historically significant location. The epic frequently mentions \"many-fountained Ida,\" from which the gods observed the Trojan War; this refers to Mount Ida in the Troad region of modern-day Turkey, also known as Kaz Dağı, which stands at 1,774 meters (5,820 feet). Another notable peak is Mount Ida on Crete, the highest point on the island at 2,456 meters (8,058 feet), famed as the mythical birthplace of Zeus.\n\nOther mountains from Greek lore and the epic traditions include Mount Pelion, with an elevation of 1,624 meters (5,328 feet), and Mount Othrys, which reaches 1,726 meters (5,663 feet). When their elevations are compared, Mount Parnassus emerges as the tallest among them.\n\nHere is a comparison of the heights of the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* and associated myths, excluding Mount Olympus:\n\n*   **Mount Parnassus:** 2,457 meters (8,061 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Crete):** 2,456 meters (8,058 feet)\n*   **Mount Ida (Troad, Turkey):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet)\n*   **Mount Othrys:** 1,726 meters (5,663 feet)\n*   **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet)\n\n<<<Mount Parnassus>>>"
