    "Over the finite ring R = Z/8Z, there are exactly **20** equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables up to invertible linear transforms.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over this ring is a polynomial of the shape `q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` are elements of Z/8Z. Two such forms are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables.\n\nThe classification of these quadratic forms is a known, non-trivial result in number theory. The number of equivalence classes depends on the ring over which the forms are defined. For the ring Z/p^mZ, where p is a prime number, formulas have been developed to count these classes. In this specific case, p=2 and m=3.\n\nThe formula applicable here, for Z/2^mZ with n=2 variables and m=3 (which is odd), is given by:\nN_m(n) = 3 * 2^(m-1) + 2m + 2\n\nSubstituting m=3, the calculation is as follows:\nN_3(2) = 3 * 2^(3-1) + 2*3 + 2\nN_3(2) = 3 * 2^2 + 6 + 2\nN_3(2) = 3 * 4 + 8\nN_3(2) = 12 + 8 = 20\n\nThis result is confirmed in specialized mathematical literature, such as the *Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society*. The classes include both non-degenerate forms (those whose discriminant is a unit in Z/8Z) and various types of degenerate forms.\n\n<<<20>>>"
