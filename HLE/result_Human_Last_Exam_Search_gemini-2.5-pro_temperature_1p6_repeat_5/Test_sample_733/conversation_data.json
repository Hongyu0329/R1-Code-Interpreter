    "A finite group that contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 must be one of the following five types:\n\n*   The cyclic group of order 5, denoted C₅\n*   The cyclic group of order 6, denoted C₆\n*   The dihedral group of order 8, denoted D₈\n*   The dihedral group of order 10, denoted D₁₀\n*   The dihedral group of order 12, denoted D₁₂\n\nThis classification was established by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart in their work on locally maximal product-free sets of small size. A set *S* in a group *G* is product-free if for all *a, b* in *S*, the product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (or locally maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nFor a set of size 2, say *S* = {*a, b*}, to be a maximal by inclusion product-free set, it must satisfy the product-free condition (*a*², *b*², *ab*, and *ba* are not in {*a, b*}) and the maximality condition (for any other element *g* in the group, the set {*a, b, g*} is not product-free).\n\nThe five groups listed above are the only finite groups that can accommodate a maximal by inclusion product-free set of exactly two elements. Research by Anabanti and others has extended this classification to sets of size 3 and 4. For instance, it has been shown that a group with a locally maximal product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24.\n\nIt's worth noting that in abelian groups, these sets are often referred to as \"sum-free sets\". The classification of groups with small locally maximal product-free sets is part of a broader effort to understand the structure of product-free sets in finite groups.\n\n<<<There are 5 such finite groups.>>>"
