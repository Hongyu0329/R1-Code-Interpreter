The infinitesimal transformations for the given heat equation are generated by the following Lie algebra:
*   `X_1 = ∂_t` (time translation)
*   `X_2 = ∂_x` (space translation)
*   `X_3 = 2t * ∂_t + x * ∂_x - (2/k_1)u * ∂_u` (scaling transformation)

From these generators, we can determine the Lie group of transformations by exponentiation. The transformation on the `x` coordinate is determined by the `x` components of these transformations.

The general representation for the transformation on `x`, denoted `x'`, is an affine transformation given by:
`x'(x) = a * x + b`
where `a` and `b` are real constants, with `a` typically being positive. This covers all combinations of spatial translations and scaling.
