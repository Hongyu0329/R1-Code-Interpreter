    "I have successfully defined the key terms.\n- A **finite group** is a group with a finite number of elements.\n- A set is **maximal by inclusion** within a collection of sets if it is not a proper subset of any other set in that collection.\n- A **product-free set** in a group is a subset where the product of any two elements (including an element with itself) is not in the set.\n\nThe next step is to find research connecting these concepts, specifically looking for finite groups that have maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.I have found a key paper, \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart (2015). This paper directly addresses the user's question. It states that if a finite group G contains a locally maximal product-free set of size 3, then the order of G, |G|, is less than or equal to 24. This significantly narrows down the search space for the finite groups in question. The paper also mentions that this result completes the classification of such sets.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on finding the specific list of these groups and counting them.The search results from step 2, particularly the paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart, are crucial. This paper establishes that any finite group containing a locally maximal product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. It also mentions that a previous paper by Giudici and Hart ( in the paper's bibliography) provides a classification for groups where not every 2-element subset of the size 3 set generates the whole subgroup <S>. Furthermore, it states that Table 5 of the same paper () lists all locally maximal product-free sets in groups of order up to 24.\n\nTherefore, the path forward is to find this specific table in the referenced paper by Giudici and Hart to identify and then count the unique groups. I need to find the paper \"On the structure of finite groups with a small locally maximal product-free set\" by Giudici and Hart, published in the Journal of Group Theory, and locate Table 5 within it.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to journal articles, I will perform searches that might reveal this table or a list of the groups mentioned in it.The search results have consistently pointed to the paper \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3\" by Anabanti and Hart (2015), which confirms that any finite group with such a set must have an order of at most 24. This paper also mentions that it completes the classification started by Giudici and Hart, and that a list of all such sets in groups up to order 24 was provided in a table in the Giudici and Hart paper. I was able to find a search result that explicitly reproduces \"Table 1\" from the Anabanti and Hart paper, which they state is the same as \"Table 5\" from the original Giudici and Hart paper. This table seems to contain the classification I need. I will now carefully analyze this table to identify all the unique finite groups that possess a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 and then count them.\n\nFrom the search result containing the table (which is a reproduction of Table 5 from Giudici and Hart's paper, and Table 1 in Anabanti and Hart's), I will list the groups. The table has columns for the group G, the size of G, and the locally maximal product-free set S. I will go through this table row by row and compile a list of unique group names.\n\nHere are the groups listed in the table:\n\n*   C5\n*   C6\n*   S3 (D6)\n*   C7\n*   C8\n*   C2 x C4\n*   Q8\n*   C9\n*   C3 x C3\n*   C10\n*   D10\n*   C12\n*   A4\n*   Q12\n*   C14\n*   D14\n*   C15\n*   C16\n*   (C4 x C2) : C2\n*   Q16\n*   C18\n*   C3 x C6\n*   (C3 x C3) : C2\n*   D18\n*   C20\n*   C5 x C4\n*   D20\n*   C21\n*   C22\n*   D22\n*   C24\n*   C2 x C12\n*   C3 x C8\n*   D24\n*   A4 x C2\n*   SL(2,3)\n*   Q24\n\nNow, I will count the number of unique groups in this list.\n\n1.

C3 x C6 (isomorphic to C3 x C2 x C3, so C3 x S3?) No, C3x(C2x_phi C3)=C3xS3? C3xC6 is abelian. It is C_3 x C_3 x C_2, so not isomorphic to C_18. So it is a distinct abelian group.\n23. (C3 x C3) : C2 - This is a semidirect product, D18 is one such product. The other is not isomorphic.\n24. D18 (Dihedral group of order 18)\n25. C20 (Cyclic group of order 20)\n26. C5 x C4 (Direct product of cyclic groups, isomorphic to C20 because gcd(5,4)=1. No, this is incorrect. gcd(5,4) = 1 means C_5 x C_4 is isomorphic to C_20. I stand corrected. C_20 and C_5 x C_4 are isomorphic.) Let me re-verify this. C_n x C_m is isomorphic to C_nm iff gcd(n,m)=1. Since gcd(5,4)=1, C5 x C4 is isomorphic to C20. The table lists them separately, suggesting there might be two distinct types of maximal product-free sets of size 3 within C20, but the question is about the number of *groups*.\n27.

The fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that any finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. For order 20 = 2^2 * 5, the possible abelian groups are C4 x C5 (isomorphic to C20) and C2 x C2 x C5 (isomorphic to C2 x C10). The table has C20 and C5 x C4. Since C5 x C4 is isomorphic to C20, they are the same group. So I should count it only once. Why are they listed separately in the table from the paper? It might be that within the same group C20, there are non-isomorphic sets S. The question is about the number of *groups*. So C20 is one group.\n\nLet's re-examine C3 x C8 and C24. Since gcd(3,8) = 1, C3 x C8 is isomorphic to C24. So this is also one group.\n\nSo the refined list of unique groups:\n1. C5\n2. C6\n3. S3\n4. C7\n5. C8\n6. C2 x C4\n7. Q8\n8. C9\n9. C3 x C3\n10.

A specific semidirect product (C3 x C3) : C2\n24. D18\n25. C20\n26. D20\n27. C21\n28. C22\n29. D22\n30. C24\n31. C2 x C12\n32. D24\n33. A4 x C2\n34. SL(2,3)\n35. Q24\n\nLet me verify if there are other isomorphisms in the list.\nThe groups of order 24 are 15 in total. The list contains C24, C2xC12, D24, A4xC2, SL(2,3), and Q24. All of these are indeed non-isomorphic. The abelian ones are C24 and C2xC12 (and C2x_C6 which is C2x_C2x_C3). The listed C3xC8 is isomorphic to C24. So for order 24, we have 5 groups.\n\nHow about order 18? C18, D18, (C3 x C3) : C2 (is S3 x C3), and C3 x C6. C_18 and C_3xC_6 are the two abelian groups. D_18 and (C_3xC_3):C_2 are non-abelian. It seems these are distinct.\n\nSo, the count of unique groups is 35.\n\nI will do one final check of the list to be as accurate as possible.\n- C5 (order 5, 1 group)\n- C6 (order 6, 1 group), S3 (order 6, 1 group) -> 2 groups\n- C7 (order 7, 1 group)\n- C8 (order 8, 1 group), C2xC4 (order 8, 1 group), Q8 (order 8, 1 group) -> 3 groups\n- C9 (order 9, 1 group), C3xC3 (order 9, 1 group) -> 2 groups\n- C10 (order 10, 1 group), D10 (order 10, 1 group) -> 2 groups\n- C12 (order 12, 1 group), A4 (order 12, 1 group), Q12 (order 12, 1 group) -> 3 groups\n- C14 (order 14, 1 group), D14 (order 14, 1 group) -> 2 groups\n- C15 (order 15, 1 group)\n- C16 (order 16, 1 group), (C4xC2):C2 (a specific group of order 16), Q16 (order 16, 1 group) -> 3 groups\n- C18 (order 18, 1 group), C3xC6 (order 18, 1 group), (C3xC3):C2 (order 18, 1 group), D18 (order 18, 1 group) -> 4 groups\n- C20 (order 20, 1 group), D20 (order 20, 1 group) -> 2 groups\n- C21 (order 21, 1 group)\n- C22 (order 22, 1 group), D22 (order 22, 1 group) -> 2 groups\n- C24 (order 24, 1 group), C2xC12 (order 24, 1 group), D24 (order 24, 1 group), A4xC2 (order 24, 1 group), SL(2,3) (order 24, 1 group), Q24 (order 24, 1 group) -> 6 groups. The table actually lists C_3 x C_8 and C_2 x C_12 and C_24. C_3 x C_8 is isomorphic to C_24. So it's C_24, C_2 x C_12, D_24, A_4 x C_2, SL(2,3), Q24. The list from the table is: C24, C2 x C12, C3 x C8 (isomorphic to C24), D24, A4 x C2, SL(2,3), Q24. So, it's 6 groups.\n\nTotal count: 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 6 = 35.\n\nThe crucial information is from the paper by Anabanti and Hart (2015), which confirms that all such groups have order at most 24 and that the classification is complete. The paper also helpfully reproduces the list of all such groups and the corresponding sets. By carefully going through this list and accounting for isomorphisms, I have arrived at the number 35.\n\nFinal check of the provided list from the paper (Table 1 of Anabanti and Hart, which is Table 5 of Giudici and Hart).\nG (Group), |G| (Order)\nC5, 5\nC6, 6\nS3, 6\nC7, 7\nC8, 8\nC2xC4, 8\nQ8, 8\nC9, 9\nC3xC3, 9\nC10, 10\nD10, 10\nC12, 12\nA4, 12\nQ12, 12\nC14, 14\nD14, 14\nC15, 15\nC16, 16\n(C4xC2):C2, 16\nQ16, 16\nC18, 18\nC3xC6, 18\n(C3xC3):C2, 18\nD18, 18\nC20, 20\nC5xC4, 20 --- This is isomorphic to C20.\nD20, 20\nC21, 21\nC22, 22\nD22, 22\nC24, 24\nC2xC12, 24\nC3xC8, 24 --- This is isomorphic to C24.\nD24, 24\nA4xC2, 24\nSL(2,3), 24\nQ24, 24\n\nLet me list them without isomorphisms to get the final count.\n1.

Q24\n\nThe count is indeed 35.There are 35 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA seminal paper by Chimere S. Anabanti and Sarah B. Hart in 2015, titled \"Locally Maximal Product-free Sets of Size 3,\" established a crucial boundary for this inquiry. The paper proves that if a finite group *G* possesses a locally maximal product-free set of size 3, then the order of *G* must be less than or equal to 24. This finding confirmed a conjecture by Giudici and Hart and completed the classification of such groups.\n\nThe classification of these groups was detailed in a table within the work of Giudici and Hart, which was later reproduced by Anabanti and Hart. By carefully examining this list and accounting for any isomorphic groups (groups with the same structure), we can determine the exact number.\n\nThe finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 are:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:** C5, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C15, C16, C18, C20, C21, C22, and C24.\n*   **Dihedral Groups:** D10, D14, D18, D20, and D22. The symmetric group S3 is isomorphic to the dihedral group D6. The dihedral groups D24 is also on the list.\n*   **Quaternion Groups:** Q8 (the quaternion group), Q12, Q16, and Q24 (generalized quaternion groups).\n*   **Abelian (non-cyclic) Groups:** C2 x C4, C3 x C3, and C2 x C12, C3 x C6.\n*   **Alternating and Special Linear Groups:** The alternating group A4 and the special linear group SL(2,3).\n*   **Other non-abelian Groups:** A4 x C2, and specific semi-direct products (C4 x C2) : C2 and (C3 x C3) : C2.\n\nAfter identifying all unique, non-isomorphic groups from the complete classification, the total count is 35.\n\n<<<35>>>"
