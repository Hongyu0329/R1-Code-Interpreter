In summary, your physical intuition is correct. The calculation of normalized magnetic helicity for AIC waves uses the magnetic field components perpendicular to the **local mean magnetic field**. The magnetic field at the L1 point is typically not radial due to the Parker spiral. Therefore, the coordinate system used for the calculation is one that is aligned with the local interplanetary magnetic field, not one fixed to the radial direction.
