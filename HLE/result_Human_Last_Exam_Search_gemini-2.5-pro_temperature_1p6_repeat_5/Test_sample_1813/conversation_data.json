    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), we first need to understand the definition of this number. The term \"generalized Markov number\" can refer to several different concepts in number theory. A prominent one, found in the study of the Markov and Lagrange spectra, relates a rational number \\( p/q \\) to a specific quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction is constructed from the continued fraction of \\( p/q \\). The Markov value of this irrational number is then termed a generalized Markov number, often denoted as \\( m_{p/q} \\). The continued fraction we seek is that of the underlying quadratic irrational.\n\nThe construction, based on the work of Beresnev, is as follows:\n\n1.  **Compute the continued fraction of the rational number \\( r = p/q \\).** The representation must be chosen such that the final term is at least 2.\n    The continued fraction of \\( \\frac{4}{7} \\) is calculated as:\n    \\( \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} \\)\n    \\( \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}} \\)\n    So, \\( \\frac{4}{7} = [0; 1, 1, 3] \\). The coefficients are \\( c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3 \\). The last term, 3, satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to 2.\n\n2.  **Construct the periodic part of the associated continued fraction.** For a rational number \\( r = [0; c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_n] \\), the associated quadratic irrational number, let's call it \\( \\alpha_r \\), has a purely periodic continued fraction \\( [0; \\overline{P}] \\) where the period \\(P\\) is constructed as:\n    \\( P = (c_1, \\dots, c_{n-1}, c_n, c_{n-1}, \\dots, c_1, 2) \\)\n\n3.  **Apply the formula for \\( r = 4/7 \\).**\n    With \\( n=3 \\), and coefficients \\( (c_1, c_2, c_3) = (1, 1, 3) \\), the periodic block is:\n    \\( P = (c_1, c_2, c_3, c_2, c_1, 2) = (1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2) \\)\n\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\) is therefore the one with this repeating block.\n\nThe final result for the continued fraction is:\n<<<\\[ [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2}] \\]>>>"
