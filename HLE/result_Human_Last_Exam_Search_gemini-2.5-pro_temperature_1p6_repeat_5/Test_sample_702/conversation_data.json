    "The connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$ is determined by the properties of the induced map on homotopy groups.\n\n### Analysis of the Spaces\n\nFirst, we determine the connectivity of the domain and codomain spaces.\n\n*   **Domain:** $A = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n    *   A sphere $S^n$ is $(n-1)$-connected. Thus, $S^4$ is 3-connected and $S^6$ is 5-connected.\n    *   The loop space functor $\\Omega$ reduces connectivity by 1. Therefore, $\\Omega S^4$ is 2-connected and $\\Omega S^6$ is 4-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of a smash product of two spaces is at least the sum of their individual connectivities plus one. So, the smash product $P = \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ has connectivity $\\text{conn}(P) \\ge \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^4) + \\text{conn}(\\Omega S^6) + 1 = 2 + 4 + 1 = 7$. Thus, $P$ is 7-connected.\n    *   The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1. Consequently, the domain $A = \\Sigma(P)$ is $(7+1) = 8$-connected. This means that $\\pi_i(A) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n*   **Codomain:** $B = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n    *   The smash product of spheres is another sphere: $S^4 \\wedge S^6 \\simeq S^{10}$.\n    *   The codomain is therefore homotopy equivalent to $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   Since $S^{10}$ is 9-connected, its loop space, $\\Omega S^{10}$, is $(9-1) = 8$-connected. This means that $\\pi_i(B) = 0$ for all $i \\le 8$.\n\n### Connectivity of the Map\n\nA map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be $k$-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups, $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < k$ and a surjection for $i=k$.\n\nSince both the domain and codomain are 8-connected, the induced map on homotopy groups is an isomorphism from the trivial group to itself for all $i < 9$. Thus, the connectivity of the map is at least 9. To determine if it is 9-connected or higher, we must analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group, $\\pi_9$.\n\n*   **$\\pi_9$ of the Domain:**\n    By the Freudenthal Suspension Theorem, $\\pi_9(A) = \\pi_9(\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\cong \\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Since the space $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is 7-connected, the Hurewicz Theorem states that its first non-trivial homotopy group is isomorphic to its first non-trivial homology group.\n    $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong H_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$.\n    Using the KÃ¼nneth theorem for homology of a smash product, $\\tilde{H}_8(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\cong \\tilde{H}_3(\\Omega S^4) \\otimes \\tilde{H}_5(\\Omega S^6)$.\n    The first non-trivial homotopy group of $\\Omega S^4$ is $\\pi_3(\\Omega S^4) = \\pi_4(S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Similarly, for $\\Omega S^6$, it is $\\pi_5(\\Omega S^6) = \\pi_6(S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    By the Hurewicz theorem again, $\\tilde{H}_3(\\Omega S^4) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\tilde{H}_5(\\Omega S^6) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n    Therefore, $\\pi_9(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\otimes \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n*   **$\\pi_9$ of the Codomain:**\n    $\\pi_9(B) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^{10}) = \\pi_{10}(S^{10}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThe map in question is a standard construction in homotopy theory, adjoint to the map that smashes two loops together. The induced map on the lowest-dimensional non-trivial homotopy groups, in this case $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$, is a homomorphism from $\\mathbb{Z}$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. It is a classical result of homotopy theory that this map is an isomorphism; its degree is $\\pm 1$.\n\nSince $f_*: \\pi_9(A) \\to \\pi_9(B)$ is an isomorphism, it is also a surjection. This satisfies the condition for the map to be 9-connected.\n\nTo determine if the map is 10-connected, we would need to check if $f_*: \\pi_i(A) \\to \\pi_i(B)$ is an isomorphism for $i<10$ and a surjection for $i=10$. We already know it is an isomorphism for $i=9$. We would then need to analyze if $f_*: \\pi_{10}(A) \\to \\pi_{10}(B)$ is a surjection. This would require calculating $\\pi_{10}(A) = \\pi_9(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ and $\\pi_{10}(B) = \\pi_{11}(S^{10})$ and understanding the map between them. This is a significantly more complex problem. However, such maps in algebraic topology are typically only isomorphisms on the lowest dimension.\n\nBased on the isomorphism on $\\pi_9$, the homotopy fiber of the map is 8-connected, which makes the map itself 9-connected.\n\n<<<9>>>"
