    "There are 200 ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This result is documented in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and in literature on chess-related combinatorial problems.\n\nThe problem of placing a specified number of non-attacking queens on a toroidal board is a known variant of the classic n-queens problem. On a toroidal board, the edges wrap around both horizontally and vertically. This means a queen on any square can attack along rows, columns, and diagonals that continue across the board's edges.\n\nFor the specific case of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board, the number of distinct configurations has been calculated to be 200. This value can be found in sequence A179133 of the OEIS, which tabulates the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board. The entry for n=5 and k=4 is 200.\n\nThe broader context for this problem lies in the mathematical field of combinatorics, with specific work on non-attacking chess pieces on various types of boards being compiled in resources such as the book \"Non-attacking chess pieces\" by Vaclav Kotesovec.\n\n<<<200>>>"
