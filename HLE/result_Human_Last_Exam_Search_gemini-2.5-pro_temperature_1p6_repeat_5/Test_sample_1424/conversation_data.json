    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, denoted as G₀, describes the propagation of a single, non-interacting particle. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is fundamental to many-body theory.\n\nThe bare Green's function in frequency-momentum space is given by the following expression:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη)**\n\nwhere:\n*   **G₀(k, ω)** is the bare Green's function for a particle with momentum **k** and frequency **ω**.\n*   **ħω** represents the energy of the particle.\n*   **ϵ_k** is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a given momentum **k**.\n*   **iη** is an infinitesimally small positive imaginary term that ensures the correct causal time-ordering of events. The sign of this term can vary depending on whether the retarded, advanced, or time-ordered Green's function is being considered. For the time-ordered Green's function, commonly used in path integral calculations, the expression can be more precisely written by including the Fermi-Dirac distribution function for fermions (or Bose-Einstein for bosons) to account for occupied and unoccupied states.\n\nFor the common case of the time-ordered Green's function for fermions at zero temperature, the formula is often expressed as:\n\n**G₀(k, ω) = [ (1 - n_k) / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη) ] + [ n_k / (ħω - ϵ_k - iη) ]**\n\nHere, n_k is the occupation number, which is 1 if the state with energy ϵ_k is occupied (ϵ_k < ϵ_F, the Fermi energy) and 0 if it is unoccupied (ϵ_k > ϵ_F). This form explicitly shows the contributions from particle and hole propagation. For unoccupied states, the pole is slightly below the real axis, and for occupied states, it is slightly above.\n\nIn essence, the bare Green's function has a pole in the complex frequency plane at the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k. This pole signifies the energy-momentum relationship of a free particle, and the residue of this pole is related to the probability amplitude for the particle's propagation.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, has an inverse functional dependence on the difference between the energy variable (ħω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k). Specifically, in frequency-momentum space, it takes the form G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη), where η is an infinitesimal constant that enforces causality.>>>"
