    "The reaction described is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM).\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The initial compound is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has an aromatic ring with two substituents: a strong directing group, N,N-diethylamide (-CONEt2), at position 1, and a weaker directing group, dimethylamino (-NMe2), at position 3.\n\n2.  **First Reagent: `sec`-BuLi and TMEDA in THF:**\n    *   `sec`-Butyllithium (`sec`-BuLi) is a very strong base.\n    *   Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) is an additive that chelates the lithium ion, increasing the basicity and reactivity of the organolithium reagent. THF is the solvent.\n    *   The N,N-diethylamide group is a powerful directed metalation group (DMG). It directs the strong base to deprotonate (a process called lithiation) one of the adjacent (*ortho*) positions on the benzene ring.\n    *   The starting material has two potential ortho positions relative to the stronger amide directing group: C2 and C6. The dimethylamino group is at C3.\n    *   The lithiation will occur at the C2 position, which is between the amide and the dimethylamino groups. This is because the amide is a significantly stronger directing group than the amino group. The lithium atom is also stabilized by chelation between the amide's oxygen and the dimethylamino's nitrogen.\n\n3.  **Intermediate:** After the first step, a lithiated intermediate is formed: N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n4.  **Second Reagent: Methyl iodide (CH‚ÇÉI):**\n    *   Methyl iodide is an electrophile.\n    *   The organolithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile. The negatively charged carbon atom (at the C2 position) attacks the methyl group of the methyl iodide in an electrophilic quench step.\n\n**Final Product:**\n\nThe lithium atom at the C2 position is replaced by a methyl group. Therefore, the final compound obtained is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
