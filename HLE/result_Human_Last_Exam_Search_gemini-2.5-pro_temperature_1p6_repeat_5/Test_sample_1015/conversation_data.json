    "A key distinction between a cambré-derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips and the resulting engagement of the torso.\n\nIn the Vaganova method, there is a strong emphasis on maintaining a square and stable torso, with the hips held level over the supporting leg(s). The backbend is initiated from the upper and middle back, with the spine elongating upwards before arching back. This creates a sense of controlled, harmonious movement where the upper body works independently of a stable lower body. The arms and head follow prescribed, elegant lines in coordination with the backbend.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often encourages a more dynamic and less rigid use of the torso and hips to achieve a desired aesthetic line. A signature element of the Balanchine style, particularly evident in movements like arabesque, is allowing the hip of the working leg to lift. This principle of a less squared-off torso allows for a greater sense of length and a \"three-dimensional spiral from the waist up.\" While a cambré-derrière is a bend of the spine, the foundational principles of hip placement in Balanchine suggest a different approach than the strict alignment of Vaganova. This freedom in the hips contributes to the speed, athleticism, and expansive look characteristic of the Balanchine style.\n\nWhile other differences exist, such as arm placement (more rounded and codified in Vaganova, often more open or with \"broken\" wrists in Balanchine) and head position (a specific forward and upward tilt in Balanchine), the foundational difference in the use of the hips dictates the overall shape and quality of the movement.\n\n<<<B>>>"
