    "The search results from the first step mentioned the demolition of two bell towers, nicknamed \"ass's ears,\" on the Pantheon. The second step confirmed this and provided a more precise demolition date. Multiple sources state that these bell towers, added in the 17th century by Pope Urban VIII, were widely disliked and were removed in the late 19th century. Specifically, sources point to their demolition in 1883.\n\nThis contradicts the user's premise that a unique architectural feature was removed in 1950. The provided search results do not mention any significant architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda or the Pantheon in or around 1950. The major architectural alteration identified—the removal of the \"donkey's ears\" bell towers—occurred much earlier, in 1883.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, the unique architectural feature that was removed were the two bell towers, but the year of removal was 1883, not 1950. I can now answer the user's question based on this information, pointing out the discrepancy in the date.\n\nA unique architectural feature of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" that was removed, though not in 1950, were two bell towers on the Pantheon, derisively nicknamed the \"donkey's ears\" (\"orecchie d'asino\"). These towers were added in the 17th century under Pope Urban VIII and were demolished in 1883.\n\nThe bell towers were a notable feature for centuries, despite being unpopular with the Roman public for clashing with the classical architecture of the Pantheon. Their removal was part of an effort to restore the Pantheon to its original appearance.\n\nWhile historical records point to several modifications to the Pantheon and the surrounding piazza over the centuries, such as the clearing of market stalls and the addition of the central fountain and obelisk, the removal of the bell towers remains the most significant architectural deletion. There is no evidence of a major architectural feature being removed in 1950. The changes in that century were more focused on restoration and preservation of the ancient structure.\n\n<<<The two bell towers on the Pantheon, known as the \"donkey's ears,\" which were demolished in 1883.>>>"
