    "There are three wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n\nThe 17 wallpaper groups are classified based on their symmetry operations, which include translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. The collection of rotations and reflections that leave a single point fixed is known as the point group of the wallpaper group. The crystallographic restriction theorem dictates that the order of the point group for a wallpaper group can only be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\n\nA point group of order 2 corresponds to either a single twofold rotation (C₂) or a single reflection (D₁). The wallpaper groups that possess a point group of order 2 are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a point group C₂, characterized by twofold rotational symmetry without any reflections.\n*   **pm**: This group's point group is D₁, which contains a reflection axis.\n*   **pg**: The point group for pg is also D₁, which in this case arises from a glide reflection.\n\nWhile the wallpaper group **cm** also has a point group D₁, it is associated with a centered lattice and is also counted among those with a point group of order 2.\n\nTherefore, a thorough count reveals there are four such groups.\n\n<<<4>>>"
