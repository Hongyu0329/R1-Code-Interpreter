    "The exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 numerical scheme can be expressed in terms of the arctangent function. The stability of a linear multistep method, such as the fourth-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF4), is analyzed by examining its absolute stability region in the complex plane. A method is termed A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the angular sector $\\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent to the boundary of the stability region from the origin.\n\nFor the BDF4 method, the boundary of the stability region is given by the set of complex numbers $w(\\phi) = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\frac{1}{j} (1 - e^{-i\\phi})^j$ for $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$. The angle $\\alpha$ is found by determining the line from the origin that is tangent to this curve.\n\nThe exact value of $\\tan(\\alpha)$ was first determined by Akrivis and Katsoprinakis and later presented in a simplified manner by Gander and Wanner. According to their work, the square of the tangent of half the angle parameterizing the unit circle at the point of tangency, $t_0^2 = \\tan^2(\\phi_0/2)$, is a rational expression involving the square root of 2033. For BDF4, this value is:\n$t_0^2 = \\frac{8525 + 155\\sqrt{2033}}{2401}$\n\nThis leads to a complex but exact expression for $\\tan(\\alpha)$. The exact value for the tangent of the stability angle for BDF4 has been derived. From this, the angle $\\alpha$ is given by:\n$$ \\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{12(20\\sqrt{2033} - 693)}{(4\\sqrt{2033}+183)\\sqrt{2(9\\sqrt{2033}-85)}}\\right) $$\nA numerical approximation for this angle is $\\alpha \\approx 73.35^\\circ$. The expression inside the arctan function represents the exact slope of the tangent to the stability region boundary from the origin.\n\n<<<$\\alpha = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{12(20\\sqrt{2033} - 693)}{(4\\sqrt{2033}+183)\\sqrt{2(9\\sqrt{2033}-85)}}\\right)$>>>"
