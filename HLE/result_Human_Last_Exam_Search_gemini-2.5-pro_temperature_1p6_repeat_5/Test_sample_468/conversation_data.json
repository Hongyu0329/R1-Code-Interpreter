    "Fairy bees, unknown\n\nThe currently used common name for the genus *Perdita* (Smith, 1853) in their native range is \"fairy bees\". This name is widely used in scientific and popular literature. Another common name sometimes used, often in conjunction with fairy bees, is \"miner bees\".\n\nThe exact year that the name \"fairy bees\" was coined is not definitively documented in available resources. While the genus *Perdita* was named by Frederick Smith in 1853, the origin of its common name is less clear. There is anecdotal evidence suggesting the name may have been popularized more recently through online platforms, but this is not substantiated. However, the term is now well-established, appearing in various entomological guides and publications. For instance, a 2024 publication refers to *Perdita meconis* as a \"small fairy bee\".\n\n<<<Fairy bees, unknown>>>"
