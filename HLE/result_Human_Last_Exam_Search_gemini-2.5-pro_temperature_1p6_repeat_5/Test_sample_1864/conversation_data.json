    "For a successful five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads, you should prepare a minimum of 13 essential control samples to ensure accurate setup, compensation, and gating. These controls are crucial for obtaining reliable and reproducible results.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the essential controls required for your experiment with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750 detection channels:\n\n### **I. Core Instrument and Staining Controls (7 samples)**\n\n1.  **Unstained Cells (1 sample):** This sample contains only your cells without any fluorescent labels or beads. It is essential for determining the baseline autofluorescence of your cell population and for setting the negative gates.\n\n2.  **Compensation Controls (5 samples):** For any multicolor experiment, you need to correct for the spectral overlap between different fluorochromes. This requires a single-stained control for each fluorochrome in your panel. These can be prepared using either cells or compensation beads.\n    *   **AF350 single-positive control**\n    *   **GFP single-positive control** (this will likely be a sample of cells expressing GFP)\n    *   **PE single-positive control**\n    *   **AF647 single-positive control**\n    *   **AF750 single-positive control**\n\n3.  **Viability Dye Control:** Dead cells can bind non-specifically to antibodies and have higher autofluorescence, leading to false-positive results. Therefore, a viability dye is a critical control. If one of your five fluorochromes is used as a viability dye, a separate control is not needed as it is covered by the compensation controls. If you use an additional viability dye, you will need a separate single-positive control for it. For this calculation, we assume one of the five specified channels is for viability.\n\n### **II. Gating and Specificity Controls (6 samples)**\n\n4.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls (5 samples):** FMO controls are critical for accurate gating in a multicolor panel, especially for identifying dim populations or when expression patterns are contiguous. An FMO control includes all the fluorescent labels in your panel *except for one*. This helps to visualize the spread of fluorescence from other channels into the channel of interest, allowing for precise gate placement. You should prepare an FMO control for each of your five channels:\n    *   **AF350 FMO** (stained with GFP, PE, AF647, AF750)\n    *   **GFP FMO** (stained with AF350, PE, AF647, AF750)\n    *   **PE FMO** (stained with AF350, GFP, AF647, AF750)\n    *   **AF647 FMO** (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF750)\n    *   **AF750 FMO** (stained with AF350, GFP, PE, AF647)\n\n5.  **Streptavidin Bead-Specific Controls (at least 1 sample):** Since you are using streptavidin beads, it is crucial to understand their properties and potential for non-specific interactions.\n    *   **Streptavidin Beads Alone:** This sample contains only the streptavidin beads and is used to check for their autofluorescence in all your detection channels.\n    *   **Secondary Reagent Control:** If you are using a biotinylated antibody followed by a fluorescently-labeled streptavidin, you must include a control with your cells and the fluorescent streptavidin only (without the biotinylated antibody) to check for non-specific binding of the streptavidin. This can often be one of the most important controls for this type of assay.\n\nCombining these controls provides a robust foundation for your experiment. While you may also include biological controls (e.g., cells known to be positive or negative for your markers), the 13 controls listed above are essential for the technical setup and validation of a five-color sorting experiment involving streptavidin beads.\n\n<<<13>>>"
