    "It is not possible to provide a precise number of \"pas de Balanchine\" movements performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo of William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" for the Semperoper Ballett in 2015.\n\nThere are several reasons for this:\n\nFirst, a \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized, discrete step in the standard vocabulary of ballet in the way a \"pas de chat\" or a \"grand jet√©\" is. Rather, it often refers to the characteristic style of movement and aesthetic quality associated with the choreographer George Balanchine. This includes a particular way of walking or a specific dynamic quality, which is not a quantifiable unit. While some dancers and schools may teach a specific combination of steps they call a \"pas de Balanchine,\" this is not a universally codified term.\n\nSecond, the choreography in question is by William Forsythe, not George Balanchine. While Forsythe's highly influential style evolved from the neoclassical work of Balanchine, he developed his own distinct and innovative choreographic language. His work challenges and deconstructs classical ballet traditions, employing off-balance movements and intricate, high-speed footwork. Therefore, it is unlikely that a specific \"pas de Balanchine\" would be formally incorporated and counted in a Forsythe piece.\n\nFinally, while reviews and photographs confirm that Svetlana Gileva performed with the Semperoper Ballett in \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" around 2015, and was praised for her performance, a publicly available video of the specific 2015 performance showing the \"Jete Woman\" solo in its entirety could not be located to attempt a speculative count based on any informal definition of the step. A YouTube link to a 2015 performance by the Semperoper Ballett featuring Svetlana Gileva in what is likely the correct role is unfortunately no longer active.\n\nGiven these factors, providing an accurate count of a non-standard, stylistically defined movement within another choreographer's work is not feasible.\n\n<<<It is not possible to provide a specific number.>>>"
