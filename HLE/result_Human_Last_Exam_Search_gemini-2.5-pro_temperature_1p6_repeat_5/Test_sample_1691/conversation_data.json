    "An analytical formula that approximates the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for the small $\\epsilon$ regime is developed using singular perturbation theory.\n\nFor small values of $\\epsilon$, the dominant contribution to the integral arises from the vicinity of $x=0$. This is because the denominator of the integrand, $P(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$, approaches zero only at $x=0$ within the integration interval. In the neighborhood of $x=0$, the polynomial $P(x)$ can be approximated by its leading term, which is $9x^5$.\n\nTherefore, the integral can be approximated by:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\nSince the integrand decreases rapidly for larger values of $x$, the primary contribution to the integral is from a small region around $x=0$. This allows for the extension of the upper integration limit to infinity, which simplifies the calculation without significantly affecting the result for the leading-order approximation.\n\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} dx$\n\nTo solve this integral, a substitution is made: let $u^5 = \\frac{9x^5}{\\epsilon}$. This leads to $x = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} u$ and $dx = (\\frac{\\epsilon}{9})^{1/5} du$. After applying this substitution, the integral transforms into:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{1}{9^{1/5} \\epsilon^{4/5}} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^5} du$\n\nThe definite integral $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{1 + u^n} du$ has a known value, given by the formula $\\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$. For $n=5$, this evaluates to $\\frac{\\pi/5}{\\sin(\\pi/5)}$.\n\nBy substituting this result back, we obtain the final analytical approximation for $I(\\epsilon)$:\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n\nThis formula shows that the integral diverges as $\\epsilon$ approaches zero, with the value being proportional to $\\epsilon^{-4/5}$.\n\n<<<\n$I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)} \\epsilon^{-4/5}$\n>>>"
