    "After a gene duplication event, the two resulting gene copies are initially redundant. This redundancy means that one copy is often lost to deactivating mutations, a process known as pseudogenization or nonfunctionalization, which is the most common fate for duplicate genes. However, several mechanisms can lead to the preservation and functional divergence of both copies.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This mechanism involves the non-reciprocal transfer of genetic information between duplicated genes. It tends to homogenize the sequences of the duplicates, thereby counteracting their divergence. While it can create novel chimeric alleles, its primary role is not the stable retention and divergence of two separate functional genes.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This process results in one gene copy becoming a non-functional pseudogene. This is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not the retention of two functional, diverged genes.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one gene copy retains the original ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, advantageous function. This process clearly leads to both retention and divergence and is a key driver of evolutionary novelty. However, it requires a relatively rare beneficial mutation to occur before one copy is silenced.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism, also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model, proposes that each duplicate copy accumulates degenerative mutations in different subfunctions (e.g., in different regulatory elements controlling expression in various tissues). As a result, both gene copies become essential to perform the complete set of functions of the ancestral gene. This partitioning of the original function ensures the retention of both copies through a neutral process, as losing either copy would be detrimental. This division of labor is a form of functional divergence. Many researchers consider subfunctionalization a more common and parsimonious explanation for the widespread preservation of duplicate genes than neofunctionalization because it relies on more frequent, nearly neutral mutations rather than rare, beneficial ones. It can also act as an intermediate step, preserving genes long enough for neofunctionalization to eventually occur.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary process describing the rapid diversification of a single lineage into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that facilitates adaptive radiation, adaptive radiation itself is not a direct molecular mechanism that explains the fate of individual duplicate genes within a genome.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBoth neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are valid mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely and frequent mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicates because it is driven by more common, neutral degenerative mutations rather than rare, beneficial gain-of-function mutations. It provides a direct pathway for both retaining the two copies (as they are co-dependent) and their divergence (as they have partitioned the original functions).\n\n<<<D>>>"
