    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, from an object $[n]$ to an object $[m]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and $g: [m] \\to [n]$, that satisfy the conditions $id_{[n]} \\le g \\circ f$ and $f \\circ g \\le id_{[m]}$. The pair $(f, g)$ forms an adjunction where $f$ is the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint.\n\nThe existence of such an adjunction is determined by a specific property of the left adjoint map $f$. A map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ can be a left adjoint if and only if it has a right adjoint $g$. This right adjoint is uniquely determined by the formula $g(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le j\\}$. For this map $g$ to be well-defined for all $j \\in [m]$, the set under consideration must always be non-empty. This is true for all $j \\in [m]$ if and only if it holds for $j=0$. The condition that the set $\\{i \\in [n] \\mid f(i) \\le 0\\}$ is non-empty means there must be some $i \\in [n]$ such that $f(i) = 0$. Since $f$ is order-preserving, this is equivalent to the condition that $f(0) = 0$.\n\nTherefore, counting the number of internal adjunctions from $[n]$ to $[m]$ is equivalent to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ that satisfy $f(0) = 0$.\n\nFor this specific problem, we have $n=23$ and $m=37$. We are looking for the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$. An order-preserving map from $$ to $$ is a sequence of values $(f(0), f(1), \\dots, f(23))$ such that $f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$ where each $f(i)$ is in $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first value in the sequence. Thus, we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences of length 23, namely $(f(1), \\dots, f(23))$, with values chosen from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$. The size of this set is 38.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem equivalent to choosing a multiset of size 23 from a set of 38 distinct elements. The number of ways to do this can be calculated using the stars and bars formula, which gives the number of multisets of size $k$ from a set of size $N$ as $\\binom{N+k-1}{k}$.\n\nIn our case, $k=23$ (the number of values we need to choose for $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$) and $N=38$ (the size of the set of possible values $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nCalculating this binomial coefficient gives the total number of such maps, and therefore, the total number of internal adjunctions.\n$$ \\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! \\cdot 37!} = 463,551,339,948,841,600 $$\n\n<<<463551339948841600>>>"
