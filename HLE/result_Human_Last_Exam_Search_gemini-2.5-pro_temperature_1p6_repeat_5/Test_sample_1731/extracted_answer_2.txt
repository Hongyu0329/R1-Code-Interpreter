The equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas, derived using large deviation theorems, are consistent with the Stefan-Boltzmann law and standard thermodynamic relations. The mean energy per unit volume is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, `<E>/V ∝ T⁴`, and the entropy is proportional to the third power of the temperature, `S ∝ T³`.
