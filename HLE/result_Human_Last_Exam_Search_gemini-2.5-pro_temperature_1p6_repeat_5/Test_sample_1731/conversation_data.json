    "I have performed a comprehensive search on the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems. The results provide a good foundation, explaining that both theorems bound the probability of an empirical average deviating from its mean and are asymptotically tight. They are essentially equivalent, with Sanov's theorem having a more direct information-theoretic interpretation and its proof being a generalization of Boltzmann's 1877 calculation. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem is often easier to apply from a measure-theoretic standpoint. Sanov's theorem deals with the large deviations of the empirical measure, with the rate function being the relative entropy. Cramer's theorem deals with the large deviations of the empirical mean, with the rate function being the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the log-moment generating function.\n\nI now need to connect these concepts to the Bose case of light quanta (a photon gas) and its specific properties, namely entropy and mean energy. I have found one very relevant article that applies these theorems to the spatial and energy distributions of photons and Planck's oscillators, reproducing the results of Bose and Planck within the large deviation theory framework.\n\nThe next steps will involve delving deeper into the application of these theorems to the Bose-Einstein statistics that govern photons. I need to find resources that detail the statistical mechanics of a photon gas and then use the framework of large deviation theory to derive the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy.I have now conducted a targeted search for the application of large deviation theorems to the Bose gas of photons. The search results have been highly successful, directly pointing to a key arXiv preprint titled \"Large Deviation Theory for Bose Gas of Photons and Planck's Oscillators\" by D. P. Shinde. This paper explicitly uses the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems to derive the large deviation probabilities, entropies, and rate functions for the spatial and energy distributions of photons and Planck's oscillators. It claims to reproduce the results of Bose and Planck within this framework.\n\nOther search results provide context on large deviations in Bose-Einstein condensates and the statistical properties of photon gases, but the aforementioned preprint appears to be the most direct and comprehensive resource for answering the user's question. I will now focus my efforts on thoroughly understanding and utilizing the information within this paper to formulate the final answer. I have sufficient information to proceed with deriving the equilibrium values without needing further searches.\n\nMy next step is to carefully analyze the mathematical derivations presented in the Shinde paper. I will identify the key equations that link the large deviation theorems to the entropy and mean energy of the photon gas. Once I have a clear understanding of their methodology and results, I will synthesize this information to provide the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy as requested by the user.\n\nGiven the very specific and technical nature of the user's request, and the direct applicability of the key research paper I have found, I am confident I can now formulate a complete and accurate response.\n\nLarge deviation theory offers a powerful framework for understanding the statistical mechanics of physical systems by quantifying the probability of rare events. In the context of a photon gas, which follows Bose-Einstein statistics, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems can be employed to determine the equilibrium thermodynamic properties, such as entropy and mean energy. A recent study has successfully applied these theorems to a Bose gas of photons, reproducing the foundational results of Bose and Planck.\n\nThis approach considers the photons as indistinguishable systems distributed among various spatial cells and energy levels. The equilibrium state is the one that maximizes the entropy, which is directly related to the probability of a given macroscopic configuration.\n\n### Equilibrium Distribution and Mean Energy\n\nBy applying large deviation theorems to the energy distribution of photons, the equilibrium distribution of photons across different energy levels is found. The number of photons, *n<sub>s</sub>*, in a state with energy *ε<sub>s</sub>* is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n\n```\nn_s = 1 / (exp(β(ε_s - μ)) - 1)\n```\n\nwhere *β* is the inverse temperature (1/k<sub>B</sub>T) and *μ* is the chemical potential. For a photon gas, the number of particles is not conserved, which implies that the chemical potential *μ* is zero.\n\nThe mean energy, `<E>`, of the photon gas at equilibrium is then the sum of the energies of all photons in their respective states. For a continuous distribution of energy states, this is given by the integral of the energy multiplied by the density of states and the Bose-Einstein distribution. This leads to the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law for the energy density of black-body radiation:\n\n```\n<E>/V = (8π⁵k⁴ / (15h³c³)) * T⁴\n```\nHere, *V* is the volume, *k* is the Boltzmann constant, *h* is Planck's constant, and *c* is the speed of light. This demonstrates that the mean energy of the photon gas is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature.\n\n### Equilibrium Entropy\n\nThe entropy of the photon gas at equilibrium can be determined from the thermodynamic relation F = <E> - TS, where F is the Helmholtz free energy. The free energy can be calculated from the partition function of the system. In the context of large deviation theory, the entropy is also directly related to the rate function of the system's probability distribution at equilibrium.\n\nThe resulting expression for the entropy, *S*, of a photon gas is given by:\n\n```\nS = (32π⁵k⁴V / (45h³c³)) * T³\n```\n\nThis shows that the entropy of a photon gas is proportional to the cube of the temperature. This result is consistent with the third law of thermodynamics, as the entropy approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero.\n\nIn summary, the application of Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems to a Bose gas of light quanta successfully recovers the established equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy, affirming the consistency of large deviation theory with the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics for quantum systems.\n\n<<<The equilibrium values for the mean energy and entropy of a photon gas, derived using large deviation theorems, are consistent with the Stefan-Boltzmann law and standard thermodynamic relations. The mean energy per unit volume is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, `<E>/V ∝ T⁴`, and the entropy is proportional to the third power of the temperature, `S ∝ T³`.>>>"
