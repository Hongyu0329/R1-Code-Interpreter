    "### Eigenvalues for a p-Electron in Spin-Orbit Coupling\n\nFor a p-electron, the interaction between its orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum, known as spin-orbit coupling, leads to a set of specific quantized values for the total angular momentum. The eigenvalues of the operators for the square of the total angular momentum ($J^2$) and its z-component ($J_z$) can be determined as follows.\n\n#### Defining the Initial Quantum Numbers\n\n*   A **p-electron** is characterized by an orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l = 1`.\n*   An **electron** has a spin angular momentum quantum number, `s = 1/2`.\n\n#### Determining the Total Angular Momentum (J)\n\nThe total angular momentum, `J`, is the vector sum of the orbital (`L`) and spin (`S`) angular momenta. The quantum number for the total angular momentum, `j`, can take values ranging from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n\nFor a p-electron:\n*   `j_max = l + s = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n*   `j_min = |l - s| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n\nThus, the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number `j` are **1/2** and **3/2**. This splitting of a single energy level into multiple states based on `j` is a characteristic feature of spin-orbit coupling.\n\n#### Common Eigenvalues of J² and Jz\n\nSince the operators $J^2$ and $J_z$ commute, we can find states that are simultaneous eigenfunctions of both. These states are denoted by `|j, m_j>`, where `m_j` is the total magnetic quantum number.\n\nThe eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ are given by the standard formulas from quantum mechanics:\n*   Eigenvalue of $J^2$:  `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`\n*   Eigenvalue of $J_z$: `ħ * m_j`, where `m_j` can be `-j, -j + 1, ..., j - 1, j`.\n\nThis results in two sets of common eigenvalues, one for each possible value of `j`:\n\n**Case 1: j = 3/2**\n*   **Eigenvalue of $J^2$**: `ħ² * (3/2) * (3/2 + 1) = (15/4)ħ²`\n*   **Eigenvalues of $J_z$**: For `j = 3/2`, `m_j` can be `-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2`. The corresponding eigenvalues are `-3/2 ħ, -1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ, 3/2 ħ`. This gives a set of four degenerate states (in the absence of an external magnetic field).\n\n**Case 2: j = 1/2**\n*   **Eigenvalue of $J^2$**: `ħ² * (1/2) * (1/2 + 1) = (3/4)ħ²`\n*   **Eigenvalues of $J_z$**: For `j = 1/2`, `m_j` can be `-1/2, 1/2`. The corresponding eigenvalues are `-1/2 ħ, 1/2 ħ`. This gives a set of two degenerate states.\n\nIn summary, the p-electron state splits into a quartet of states with `j = 3/2` and a doublet of states with `j = 1/2`, each with distinct eigenvalues for the total angular momentum and its z-component."
