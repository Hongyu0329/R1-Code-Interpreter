An optimal single-site catalyst for both olefin polymerization and polyolefin hydrogenolysis is a zirconium hydride species supported on silica-alumina. This system is effective because the active site can facilitate both the insertion of olefins for polymerization and the reverse reaction, Î²-alkyl elimination, for degradation in the presence of hydrogen.
