    "To determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein coiled-coil sequence, we must first identify the heptad repeat pattern and then analyze the residues at the core positions. The \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of side chains from these core positions is a primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n\nThe standard coiled-coil sequence is a seven-amino-acid repeat, termed a heptad, with positions labeled `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, and `g`. The `a` and `d` positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues and form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil, which dictates the stability and oligomeric state.\n\nThe provided sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\n\nTo find the correct heptad register, we look for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues that would place them consistently at the `a` and `d` positions. Let's test the most plausible frame for the repeating unit. By ignoring the first two residues (which are often non-canonical) and assigning position `c` to the third residue (E), we find a highly consistent pattern:\n\n**Position:** `  c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g  `\n**Sequence:** `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nThis alignment reveals the residues at the critical `a` and `d` core positions:\n*   **'a' positions:** L (residue 7), L (residue 14), W (residue 21), L (residue 28)\n*   **'d' positions:** I (residue 3), I (residue 10), I (residue 17), I (residue 24)\n\nThe dominant residues are **Leucine (L)** at the `a` positions and **Isoleucine (I)** at the `d` positions. Tryptophan (W) is also a large hydrophobic residue suitable for a core position.\n\nExtensive research on model coiled-coils like GCN4 has established rules linking the identity of amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions to the resulting oligomeric state:\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Predominantly Isoleucine at `a` and Leucine at `d`.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** A more even distribution of Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` positions.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** Predominantly Leucine at `a` and Isoleucine at `d`.\n\nThe sequence in question clearly follows the pattern for tetramer formation, with Leucine residues overwhelmingly occupying the `a` positions and Isoleucine residues exclusively at the `d` positions. This specific arrangement of core hydrophobic residues allows for the optimal knobs-into-holes packing for a four-helix bundle.\n\nTherefore, the oligomeric state of this protein coiled-coil sequence would be 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
