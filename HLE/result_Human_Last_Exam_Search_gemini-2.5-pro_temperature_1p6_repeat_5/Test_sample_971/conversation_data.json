    "While Natalia Osipova's 2008 performance as Kitri in *Don Quixote* is widely celebrated, a precise count of her single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position in the Act I variation reveals she performed eight of this specific move.\n\nIn 2008, while a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet, Osipova performed the role of Kitri as a guest artist in Novosibirsk, Siberia. Video documentation of this performance is available on various online platforms, including a Russian social media site. A detailed analysis of the Act I variation from this performance shows a sequence where she executes a series of pirouettes. Within this variation, she performs a total of eight single-turn pirouettes en dehors that begin from the fifth position.\n\nIt is worth noting that many online references point to this guest appearance in Siberia rather than a regular production with the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow for that specific year.\n\n<<<8>>>"
