    "The symmetry group of the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C₁ in Schoenflies notation. This information is based on the comprehensive database of the best-known packings of equal circles in a circle. In this database, if the symmetry group field for a specific number of circles is empty, it signifies a C₁ symmetry. C₁ symmetry implies that the arrangement has no rotational or reflectional symmetry, which is the lowest possible symmetry order.\n\n<<<C₁>>>"
