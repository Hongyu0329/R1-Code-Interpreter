    "In a standard surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is determined by the topology of the surface, which can be modified by introducing \"holes\" or \"punctures\". The method of creating a pair of holes to encode a single logical qubit is a commonly cited technique. However, more advanced configurations can yield a significantly higher number of logical qubits for the same number of holes.\n\nResearch into \"generalized surface codes\" has shown that by carefully engineering the boundaries of the holes as a mixture of \"open\" and \"closed\" types, a denser packing of logical qubits can be achieved. Specifically, for a planar surface code with 'b' holes, the number of logical qubits, 'k', can be described by the formula k = 2b - 1 when each hole has a boundary that is a mix of open and closed paths. For a patch with two holes (b=2), this would yield `k = 2*2 - 1 = 3` logical qubits.\n\nEven more advanced geometries have been proposed and analyzed. A notable example is the \"mixed diamond-hole surface code\". In a paper on this topic, a configuration with just two holes is shown to encode a remarkable five logical qubits (`k=5`). This is achieved through a specific arrangement and definition of the hole boundaries.\n\nTherefore, at most, a single patch of surface code with two holes can encode 5 logical qubits. Given two such independent patches, the total number of logical qubits would be the sum of the qubits in each patch.\n\nAt most, 10 logical qubits can be encoded in two patches of surface code, with each patch having two holes. This is accomplished by using an advanced configuration known as a mixed diamond-hole surface code.\n\n<<<10>>>"
