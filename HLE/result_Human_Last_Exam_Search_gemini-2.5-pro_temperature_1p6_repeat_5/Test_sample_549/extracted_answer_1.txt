The quantum correction to the conductivity for an electron in a bulk semiconductor due to weak localization is given by the formula:
δσ = (e² / (2π²ħ)) \* (1/L_φ - 1/l_e)
where 'e' is the elementary charge, 'ħ' is the reduced Planck constant, 'l_e' is the elastic mean free path, and 'L_φ' is the phase coherence length. Since L_φ > l_e, this correction is negative, representing a decrease in conductivity.
