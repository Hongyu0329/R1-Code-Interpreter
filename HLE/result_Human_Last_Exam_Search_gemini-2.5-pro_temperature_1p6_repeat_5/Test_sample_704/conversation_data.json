    "On Sir Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between the color produced when combining yellow and blue, and blue itself, is **G**.\n\nIsaac Newton, in his 1704 book *Opticks*, proposed a correlation between the colors of the visible light spectrum and the notes of a musical scale. He organized the seven colors of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—in a circular arrangement. He then analogized these colors to the seven notes of a musical scale, specifically the Dorian mode starting on the note D.\n\nThe correspondence between the colors and the musical notes in Newton's system is as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to **D**\n*   **Orange** corresponds to **E**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to **A**\n*   **Indigo** corresponds to **B**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to **C**\n\nWhen yellow and blue are combined, particularly in the context of pigments (subtractive mixing), the resulting color is green. On Newton's color wheel, green is situated between yellow and blue.\n\nTherefore, the range on Newton's color circle \"between the colour produced when combining yellow and blue (which is green), and blue itself\" is the segment from green to blue. The musical note that corresponds to the beginning of this range, green, is G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
