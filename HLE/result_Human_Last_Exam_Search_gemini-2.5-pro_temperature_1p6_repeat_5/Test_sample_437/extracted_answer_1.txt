The value of the integral is $\zeta$ if the orbitals $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$ are identical, and $\frac{4(\zeta_i \zeta_j)^{3/2}}{(\zeta_i + \zeta_j)^2}$ if they have different orbital exponents $\zeta_i$ and $\zeta_j$. Assuming the question implies the simplest case of a single orbital type, the answer is $\zeta$.
