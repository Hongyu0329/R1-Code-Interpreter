    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is commonly called the **dynamic structure factor**, often denoted as *S(q, ω)* in the nuclear criticality community and related fields of physics.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, *G(r, t)*, provides the probability of finding a particle at a position *r* at time *t*, given that another particle was at the origin (*r* = 0) at time *t* = 0. Its double Fourier transform with respect to space (*r*) and time (*t*) yields the dynamic structure factor *S(q, ω)*. Here, *q* represents the wave vector (the Fourier variable for space) and *ω* represents the angular frequency (the Fourier variable for time).\n\nIn the context of nuclear systems, particularly in reactor physics and criticality safety, the analysis of neutron correlations is fundamental. The dynamic structure factor contains information about the collective dynamics and correlations of neutrons within the system. While techniques like the Feynman-alpha and Rossi-alpha methods focus on the temporal correlations of neutron counts to determine reactor parameters, the underlying physics is described by the transport of correlated particles.\n\nThe terminology is shared with condensed matter physics, where inelastic neutron or X-ray scattering experiments directly measure the dynamic structure factor to probe the microscopic structure and dynamics of materials. The dynamic structure factor reveals the energy and momentum transfer between the scattered particles (like neutrons) and the system, providing a comprehensive picture of the space-time correlations.\n\nWhen dealing with systems composed of different types of particles, the term \"generalized dynamic structure factor\" may be used to account for the weighted sum of the partial dynamic structure factors for each pair of particle species. In essence, the dynamic structure factor provides a complete description in reciprocal space (momentum and frequency space) of the pair correlations in real space and time.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor>>>"
