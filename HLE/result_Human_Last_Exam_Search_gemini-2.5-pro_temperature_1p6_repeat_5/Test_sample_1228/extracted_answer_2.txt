Yes, under the standard and experimentally verified properties of kaons, they can induce an asymmetry between neutrinos and antineutrinos. This is because neutral kaons exhibit CP violation, which leads to slightly different decay rates into neutrinos versus antineutrinos. However, this is only possible by disregarding the hypothetical constraint that these rates are the same. If that specific constraint is strictly enforced, then no asymmetry can be generated.
