It is not possible to prove the existence of Gödel's god-like entities using the customary setting of the mathematics used for quantum mechanics. The two systems are fundamentally incompatible in their languages, axioms, and the domains they describe. Quantum mechanics uses functional analysis and Hilbert spaces to model physical phenomena, while Gödel's proof is a formal argument in higher-order modal logic dealing with abstract metaphysical concepts that have no representation in quantum formalism.
