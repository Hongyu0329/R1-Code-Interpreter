    "I am unable to identify the specific individual who served as the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in the year 1461.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that Bártfa, as a free royal town in the 15th century, was administered by a judge (also referred to as a mayor or reeve) and a town council, the name of the person holding this office in 1461 is not available in the searched documents.\n\nResearch indicates the existence of records detailing the town's administration, including lists of councillors for years surrounding 1461. For example, one source names Stefan Walich as \"Burgermaister\" (mayor) for the terms 1467/68 and 1468/69. Furthermore, documents from the early 1460s mention interactions with the \"judge and lay judges of Bártfa,\" but do not provide their names.\n\nTo definitively name the judge of Bártfa in 1461 would require consulting specialized archival records, such as the municipal archives of Bardejov, or in-depth scholarly works on the history of the town's administration, which are not accessible through the available search tools. One such potentially relevant but inaccessible publication is Mária Fedorčáková's \"Civitas nostra Bardfa vocata. The Administration of the Town of Bardejov in the Middle Ages (1320–1526)\".\n\n<<<I am unable to provide the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461.>>>"
