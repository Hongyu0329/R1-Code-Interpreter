    "To determine the VC dimension of $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ where $S$ is a schema containing 4 unary predicates, we must first understand the class of concepts definable by this logic.\n\n### 1. Definable Sets (Concepts)\nLet the four unary predicates in the schema $S$ be $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), \\text{and } P_4(x)$. The logical fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas built using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the constants true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nA formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in this logic defines a subset of the domain of a given structure. Let's analyze the form of such a formula. Any formula $\\phi(x)$ can be written in prenex normal form as $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a quantifier-free formula using only $\\land, \\top, \\bot$.\n\nSince all predicates are unary, an atomic formula is of the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is a variable. The quantifier-free part $\\psi$ is a conjunction of such atomic formulas. We can separate the atoms involving the free variable $x$ from those involving only the existentially quantified variables $\\vec{y}$:\n$\\psi(x, \\vec{y}) = \\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$.\n\nThus, the formula $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to:\n$\\phi(x) \\equiv \\exists \\vec{y} (\\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})) \\equiv \\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists \\vec{y} \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y}))$.\n\nThe part $\\exists \\vec{y} \\psi_{\\vec{y}}(\\vec{y})$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). For any given logical structure (a domain and interpretation of the predicates), this sentence is either true or false.\n*   If the sentence is false, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\bot$, defining the empty set.\n*   If the sentence is true, $\\phi(x)$ is equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$.\n\nThe formula $\\psi_x(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving $x$, so it has the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for some index set $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThe formula $\\top$ corresponds to an empty conjunction ($I = \\emptyset$). The formula $\\bot$ defines the empty set.\n\nTherefore, for any structure, the collection of sets definable by this logic is a subset of the collection of sets defined by formulas of the form $\\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ for all $I \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, plus the empty set.\n\nTo find the VC dimension of the logic, we must find the maximum VC dimension over all possible structures. We can choose a structure that is rich enough to realize all these concepts distinctly. Let our domain be the set of all 4-bit binary vectors $\\{0,1\\}^4$. Let the interpretation of the predicates be $P_i(v) \\iff v_i = 1$. The set of definable concepts is then equivalent to the set of functions on $\\{0,1\\}^4$ represented by **monotone conjunctions** of 4 Boolean variables, plus the always-false function.\n\n### 2. VC Dimension of Monotone Conjunctions\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the concept class of monotone conjunctions of 4 variables. Let $n=4$. The concept class is $\\mathcal{C} = \\{ h_I \\mid I \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\}$, where $h_I(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} x_i$. Adding the empty set concept does not change the VC dimension.\n\nThe VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions over $n$ variables is $n$. Let's prove this for $n=4$.\n\n**Part 1: Show VC dimension is at least 4.**\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must find a set of 4 points that can be shattered by the class of monotone conjunctions. Consider the set of 4 points in $\\{0,1\\}^4$ that each have exactly three '1's:\n$X = \\{ \\bar{e}_1, \\bar{e}_2, \\bar{e}_3, \\bar{e}_4 \\}$, where:\n*   $\\bar{e}_1 = (0, 1, 1, 1)$\n*   $\\bar{e}_2 = (1, 0, 1, 1)$\n*   $\\bar{e}_3 = (1, 1, 0, 1)$\n*   $\\bar{e}_4 = (1, 1, 1, 0)$\n\nLet $Y$ be an arbitrary subset of $X$. We need to find a monotone conjunction $h_I(\\mathbf{x}) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} x_i$ that is true for all points in $Y$ and false for all points in $X \\setminus Y$.\nLet $J \\subseteq \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ be the set of indices such that $Y = \\{ \\bar{e}_j \\mid j \\in J \\}$. Let's choose the concept corresponding to the index set $I = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\} \\setminus J$.\nLet's evaluate this concept $h_I$ on a point $\\bar{e}_k \\in X$:\n$h_I(\\bar{e}_k) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} (\\bar{e}_k)_i$.\nThe $i$-th component of $\\bar{e}_k$, $(\\bar{e}_k)_i$, is 1 if and only if $i \\neq k$.\nSo, $h_I(\\bar{e}_k)$ is true if and only if for all $i \\in I$, we have $i \\neq k$. This is equivalent to saying that $k$ is not in the set $I$.\nBy our choice of $I$, $k \\notin I \\iff k \\in J$.\nThis means $h_I(\\bar{e}_k)$ is true if and only if $\\bar{e}_k \\in Y$.\nSince this holds for any subset $Y$, the set $X$ is shattered. The size of $X$ is 4, so the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n**Part 2: Show VC dimension is at most 4.**\nThe class of monotone conjunctions is a subclass of the class of all conjunctions (monomials), which also allow for negated variables. The VC dimension of the class of all monomials on $n$ variables is $n$. Since our concept class is a subset of the class of all monomials on 4 variables, its VC dimension cannot be greater than 4.\n\nFrom Parts 1 and 2, the VC dimension of the class of monotone conjunctions on 4 variables is exactly 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
