    "This sequence is based on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\nThe standard sequence of letters on the bottom row is Z, X, C, V, B, N, M.\n\nThe provided sequence, ZXXCVYBN_, follows this pattern with two exceptions:\n1.  An extra 'X' is inserted.\n2.  A 'Y' is inserted between 'V' and 'B'.\n\nThese extra letters are designed to mislead, but the underlying pattern is the progression of keys on the keyboard's bottom row. After 'N', the next and final letter on this row is 'M'.\n\n<<<M>>>"
