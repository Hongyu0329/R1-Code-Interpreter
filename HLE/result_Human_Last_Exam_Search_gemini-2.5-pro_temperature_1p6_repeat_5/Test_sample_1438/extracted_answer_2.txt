The measure for a Grassmann variable integral is defined by the Berezin integration rules: \( \int d\theta = 0 \) and \( \int d\theta \, \theta = 1 \). These rules are a direct consequence of the anti-commuting nature of Grassmann variables \( (\theta^2=0) \), which mathematically encodes the Pauli exclusion principle.
