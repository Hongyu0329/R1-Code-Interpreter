    "There are 14 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be A and B. Any category with two objects must have two identity morphisms, id_A: A → A and id_B: B → B. Since the total number of morphisms is 4, there are two additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them f and g.\n\nThe different ways to distribute these two non-identity morphisms into the hom-sets Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), Hom(B,A), and Hom(B,B) determine the structure of the category. We can classify the categories based on these distributions, up to isomorphism (which includes swapping the labels of objects A and B).\n\nThe distinct cases are:\n\n1.  **Both morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object:** For instance, f and g are both in Hom(A,A). The set {id_A, f, g} must form a monoid under composition. There are 5 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each of these defines a valid category structure. This gives **5** categories.\n\n2.  **One morphism is an endomorphism of A and one is an endomorphism of B:** f is in Hom(A,A) and g is in Hom(B,B). Here, {id_A, f} and {id_B, g} must each form a monoid of order 2. A monoid of order 2 can have its non-identity element be idempotent (x*x = x) or be of order 2 (x*x = id). Up to isomorphism, this gives three combinations for the structures of the two monoids:\n    *   Both are groups (Z₂).\n    *   Both are idempotent monoids.\n    *   One is a group and one is an idempotent monoid.\n    This gives **3** categories.\n\n3.  **One is an endomorphism of A and one goes from A to B:** f is in Hom(A,A) and g is in Hom(A,B). {id_A, f} must be a monoid of order 2, giving two choices. For composition to be associative, g∘f must be g. Both monoid structures are compatible with this requirement. The two resulting categories are non-isomorphic. This gives **2** categories.\n\n4.  **One is an endomorphism of A and one goes from B to A:** f is in Hom(A,A) and g is in Hom(B,A). This is the dual situation to the previous case and results in **2** distinct non-isomorphic categories.\n\n5.  **Both morphisms go from A to B:** f and g are in Hom(A,B). There are no possible non-trivial compositions between f and g. The category structure is uniquely determined. This gives **1** category.\n\n6.  **One morphism goes from A to B and the other from B to A:** f is in Hom(A,B) and g is in Hom(B,A). For composition to be well-defined within the given four morphisms, we must have g∘f = id_A and f∘g = id_B. This defines a single category where the two objects are isomorphic. This gives **1** category.\n\nSumming up the number of categories in each case: 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
