    "This is a trick question.

The sequence is not present in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). While some numbers in the sequence also appear in the Collatz sequence for the starting number 27, the overall sequence does not match, and it contains numbers not found in that Collatz sequence.\n\nIt is highly probable that this is not a standard mathematical sequence. It could be a sequence derived from a specific puzzle, an encoding, or a non-mathematical source for which context is not available. Without the underlying rule or source, it is impossible to determine the next number.\n\nTherefore, the next number in the sequence cannot be determined from the information provided.\n\n<<<I am unable to determine the next number in the sequence.>>>"
