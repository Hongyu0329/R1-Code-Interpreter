    "The first winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen was *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937).\n\nThe film, which won the Oscar for Best Picture at the 10th Academy Awards, is a biographical picture about the French writer Ã‰mile Zola. While much of the film was shot on Hollywood backlots, exterior shots establishing the Parisian setting were used. The Place de la Concorde in Paris, the location of one of the two Luxor Obelisks, is shown in the film.\n\nOther Best Picture winners were filmed in Paris, but later. *An American in Paris* (1951) used a set that suggested the Place de la Concorde, but featured a replica of the fountain, not the actual obelisk. *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) and *Gigi* (1958) also feature Parisian scenes, with *Gigi* explicitly mentioning the Place de la Concorde as a location. However, *The Life of Emile Zola* predates these films.\n\nThe other Luxor Obelisk remains at the Luxor Temple in Egypt. While many films have been set in Egypt, no earlier Best Picture winner has been identified as depicting this obelisk.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
