    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter H.\n\nThe two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce, also known as the \"Via dei Licei\" (Street of the High Schools). The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is composed of the Liceo Classico \"G. Galilei\" and the Istituto Tecnico Economico \"A. Pacinotti\". The two institutes are in adjacent buildings and share an internal courtyard with the neighboring Liceo Scientifico \"Ulisse Dini\".\n\nAn aerial view of the school complex clearly shows the layout of the buildings. The main structures of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Liceo Ulisse Dini run parallel to each other along the street. A connecting building or wing links these two parallel structures, forming the distinct shape of the letter H.\n\n<<<H>>>"
