    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed in a public transport scene is *Collateral* (2004).\n\nIn the film's climax, the hitman Vincent (played by Tom Cruise) is fatally wounded by the taxi driver Max (played by Jamie Foxx) during a shootout on a metro rail train. As Vincent sits dying, a new passenger boards the train and sits across from him. This interaction, though brief and seemingly insignificant, underscores the anonymous nature of Vincent's death, a theme he had discussed earlier in the movie. While the specific phrase \"Thank you\" is not what seals his fate, the mundane reality of everyday commuters coming and going highlights the lonely and unnoticed demise of the once-unstoppable assassin.\n\n*Collateral* received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max.\n\n<<<Collateral>>>"
