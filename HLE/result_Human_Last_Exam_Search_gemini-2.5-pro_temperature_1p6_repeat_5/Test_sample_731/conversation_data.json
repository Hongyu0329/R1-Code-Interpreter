    "A power subgroup of a group is a subgroup that is generated by a single element; in other words, it is a cyclic subgroup. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we must determine the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of size 512, denoted as SD_512, is a group of order 2^n where n=9. It can be defined by the presentation:\nSD_512 = <a, b | a^(256) = b^2 = 1, bab = a^(127)>\n\nThe elements of this group consist of two types:\n1.  Powers of `a`: `a^i` for 0 ≤ i < 256.\n2.  Elements of the form `a^i*b`: `a^i*b` for 0 ≤ i < 256.\n\nWe can find the number of cyclic subgroups by analyzing the subgroups generated by each type of element.\n\n**1. Cyclic subgroups generated by powers of `a`:**\nThe element `a` generates a cyclic subgroup `<a>` of order 256. The number of distinct subgroups of a cyclic group of order `m` is equal to the number of divisors of `m`. The order of `<a>` is 256 = 2^8. The divisors of 2^8 are 2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^8, which means there are 8 + 1 = 9 cyclic subgroups within `<a>`.\n\n**2. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `a^i*b`:**\nWe need to determine the orders of these elements. The square of an element `a^i*b` is:\n`(a^i*b)^2 = a^i * b * a^i * b = a^i * (ba^ib)`\nUsing the relation `ba = a^127 * b`, we can deduce that `ba^i = a^(127i) * b`. Therefore:\n`(a^i*b)^2 = a^i * (a^(127i) * b) * b = a^(128i) * b^2 = a^(128i)`\n\nThe order of `a^(128i)` depends on whether `i` is even or odd:\n*   If `i` is even (i = 2k), then `(a^(2k)*b)^2 = a^(128*2k) = a^(256k) = e`. These 128 elements have an order of 2 and generate 128 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 2.\n*   If `i` is odd (i = 2k+1), then `(a^((2k+1))*b)^2 = a^(128*(2k+1)) = a^128`. Since `(a^128)^2 = a^256 = e`, the order of these elements is 4. There are 128 such elements of order 4. Each pair of elements {`a^i*b`, `(a^i*b)^3`} generates the same cyclic subgroup. Thus, these 128 elements generate 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4.\n\nThese subgroups are not contained within `<a>` because they include the element `b`.\n\n**Total Number of Power Subgroups:**\nThe total count is the sum of the distinct subgroups from each category:\n*   Subgroups from `<a>`: 9\n*   Subgroups from `a^i*b` with `i` even: 128\n*   Subgroups from `a^i*b` with `i` odd: 64\n\nTotal = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\nThis result can be confirmed using a known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups, `c(G)`, in a semidihedral group `SD_{2^n}` for `n ≥ 4`. The formula is:\n`c(SD_{2^n}) = 3 * 2^(n-3) + n`\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, `2^n = 512`, so `n=9`. Applying the formula:\n`c(SD_{512}) = 3 * 2^(9-3) + 9`\n`c(SD_{512}) = 3 * 2^6 + 9`\n`c(SD_{512}) = 3 * 64 + 9`\n`c(SD_{512}) = 192 + 9`\n`c(SD_{512}) = 201`\n\nBoth methods yield the same result.\n\n<<<201>>>"
