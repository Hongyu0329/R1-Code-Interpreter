    "The Wittig reaction is a process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound with a phosphorus ylide (also known as a Wittig reagent).\n\nTo determine the product of the specified reaction, we must first identify the structures of the two reactants:\n\n1.  **Pivalaldehyde:** This is an aldehyde also known by its systematic IUPAC name, 2,2-dimethylpropanal. Its structure consists of a tert-butyl group, (CH₃)₃C–, attached to an aldehyde functional group, –CHO. It is considered a sterically bulky aldehyde.\n\n2.  **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane:** This is the phosphorus ylide.\n    *   \"triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane\" refers to the P(C₆H₅)₃ (or PPh₃) portion of the molecule.\n    *   \"ethylidene\" indicates a two-carbon chain attached to the phosphorus via a double bond. In this case, it is specifically =CHCH₃.\n    *   \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" specifies that a 2-chlorophenyl group is attached to the second carbon of the ethylidene group.\n    *   Therefore, the structure of the ylide is (C₆H₅)₃P=CHCH₂–(C₆H₄Cl). This is a non-stabilized ylide because the carbon atom of the ylide is attached to an alkyl group.\n\nThe Wittig reaction proceeds by forming a new carbon-carbon double bond between the carbonyl carbon of the aldehyde and the ylide carbon, replacing the C=O and P=C double bonds with a C=C and a P=O bond.\n\nThe resulting product from the reaction of pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. Triphenylphosphine oxide, (C₆H₅)₃P=O, is formed as a byproduct.\n\nThe reaction produces a new alkene, which can have E/Z (or trans/cis) stereoisomers. Non-stabilized ylides typically favor the formation of the Z-alkene. However, the use of a sterically hindered aldehyde like pivalaldehyde can increase the proportion of the E-alkene. Thus, a mixture of E and Z isomers is expected.\n\n<<<1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene>>>"
