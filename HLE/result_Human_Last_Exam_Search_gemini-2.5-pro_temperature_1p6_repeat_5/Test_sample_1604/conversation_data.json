    "I have found a list of Lady Butler's paintings and the battles they depict. Now I need to determine the date of each battle and find the latest one.\n\nHere is a list of paintings and the battles/wars they depict, based on the search results:\n\n*   **The Roll Call** (painted 1874): Aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman (5 November 1854) during the Crimean War (1853-1856).\n*   **The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras** (painted 1875): Battle of Quatre Bras (16 June 1815), part of the Napoleonic Wars.\n*   **Balaclava** (painted 1876): Aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava (25 October 1854) during the Crimean War.\n*   **The Return from Inkerman** (painted 1877): Aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman (1854) in the Crimean War.\n*   **Remnants of an Army** (painted 1879): Jellalabad, January 13th 1842, during the First Anglo-Afghan War.\n*   **The Defence of Rorke's Drift** (painted 1880): Battle of Rorke's Drift (22-23 January 1879) during the Anglo-Zulu War.\n*   **Scotland Forever!** (painted 1881): Charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815).\n*   **Floreat Etona!** (painted 1882): Battle of Laing's Nek (28 January 1881) during the First Boer War.\n*   **The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj** (painted 1917): Battle of Huj (8 November 1917) during World War I.\n*   **The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards** (painted 1927): Battle of Mons (23 August 1914) during World War I.\n*   **A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders** (painted 1929): World War I subject.\n*   **Charge of the Egyptian Camel Corps**: Depicts a charge, but the specific battle and date are not mentioned in the search results so far. The painting was damaged during the Irish Civil War (1922-1923).\n*   **Listed for the Connaught Rangers**: The context suggests a recruiting scene rather than a specific battle.\n*   **Halt on a Forced March**: Depicts a general scene, not a specific battle.\n*   **Steady the Drums and Fifes**: Depicts a general scene, not a specific battle.\n*   **Scots Guards Saving the Colours at Alma**: Battle of Alma (20 September 1854) during the Crimean War.\n\nNow I will order the battles chronologically to find the latest one:\n\n1.  **Battle of Quatre Bras** and **Battle of Waterloo**: June 1815\n2.  **Jellalabad (from \"Remnants of an Army\")**: January 1842\n3.  **Battle of Alma**, **Battle of Balaclava**, **Battle of Inkerman**: 1854\n4.  **Battle of Rorke's Drift**: January 1879\n5.  **Battle of Laing's Nek**: January 1881\n6.  **Battle of Mons**: August 1914\n7.  **Battle of Huj**: November 1917\n8.  **A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders**: World War I (1914-1918)\n\nBased on this, the latest identifiable battle is the **Battle of Huj** in November 1917. While \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" also depicts a World War I scene and was painted later, the Battle of Huj is the latest specific, dated battle mentioned among her works. The painting itself was created in 1917, close to the event.\n\nThe painting depicting the Battle of Huj is the latest historically. The Battle of Huj took place on November 8, 1917. The other battles depicted are from the Napoleonic Wars, the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Crimean War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the First Boer War, all of which occurred earlier. Although \"The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\" and \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" are from World War I, the Battle of Huj in November 1917 is the latest specific engagement.I have gathered information about several paintings by Lady Butler and the historical battles they depict.\n\n*   **\"The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj\"**: This painting depicts the Battle of Huj, which took place on November 8, 1917, during World War I. This was part of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.\n*   **\"The Retreat from Mons: The Royal Horse Guards\"**: This work, painted in 1927, shows the retreat after the Battle of Mons, which occurred on August 23, 1914.\n*   **\"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\"**: Painted in 1929, this is noted as her last oil painting and is a World War I subject, placing the event between 1914 and 1918.\n*   **\"The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia, 26 February 1916\"**: This painting depicts a battle that occurred on February 26, 1916.\n*   **\"After the Battle: Arrival of Lord Wolseley and Staff at the Bridge of Tel-el-Kebir at the Close of the Action, 13 September 1882\"**: This work shows an event from the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882.\n*   **\"To the front: French cavalry leaving a Breton city on the declaration of war\"**: This painting is set during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871.\n*   Other paintings like \"The Defence of Rorke's Drift\" (1879), \"Floreat Etona!\" (Battle of Laing's Nek, 1881), and her works on the Crimean War (1850s) and Napoleonic Wars (early 1800s) all depict earlier conflicts.\n\nComparing the dates of these specific battles:\n\n*   Battle of Mons: August 23, 1914\n*   The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia: February 26, 1916\n*   Battle of Huj: November 8, 1917\n\nThe Battle of Huj on November 8, 1917, is the latest specific historical battle identified among Lady Butler's paintings. While \"A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders\" also depicts a World War I scene and was painted later, the battle it portrays is not specified with a date that would place it after November 1917. Therefore, the battle depicted in \"The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj\" is the latest historically.\n\nThe battle depicted in a painting by Lady Butler that occurred latest historically is the **Battle of Huj**.\n\nThis charge, carried out by the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry, took place on November 8, 1917, during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War. Lady Butler immortalized this event in her painting titled *The Charge of the Warwickshire and Worcestershire Yeomanry at Huj*.\n\nOther paintings by Lady Butler depicting World War I scenes include *The Retreat from Mons* (painted in 1927), which portrays the retreat following the Battle of Mons on August 23, 1914, and *A Detachment of Cavalry in Flanders* (painted in 1929), which depicts a general scene from the war. Another work, *The Dorset Yeomen at Agagia*, shows a battle from February 26, 1916. However, the Battle of Huj in November 1917 is the latest specific, dated battle among her known works.\n\nHer other famous works depict earlier 19th-century conflicts, such as the Napoleonic Wars, the First Anglo-Afghan War, the Crimean War, the Anglo-Zulu War, and the First Boer War. For instance, *The Defence of Rorke's Drift* (painted in 1880) depicts an 1879 event, and *Scotland Forever!* (painted in 1881) portrays the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\n<<<The Battle of Huj>>>"
