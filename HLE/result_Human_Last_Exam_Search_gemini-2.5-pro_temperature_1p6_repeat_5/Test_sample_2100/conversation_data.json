    "The man \"a joy-discovering sailor\" referred to by Andrei Voznesensky is Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov. The answer to the question of his final resting place, a mystery for a significant period, began to emerge in the late 1980s.\n\nVoznesensky's poem \"Avos!\" (1970) chronicles the tragic love story of Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer, and María de la Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco. The poem later became the basis for the popular Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" with lyrics by Voznesensky.\n\nIn 1806, during a visit to Spanish California to secure provisions for the struggling Russian colonies in Alaska, the 42-year-old Rezanov met and fell in love with the 15-year-old Concepción. After becoming engaged, Rezanov embarked on the long journey back to St. Petersburg to seek permission from the Tsar to marry a Catholic. However, he fell ill while crossing Siberia, died in Krasnoyarsk in March 1807, and was buried there. For years, the exact location of his grave was uncertain, especially after its destruction during the Soviet era.\n\nThe question of his grave's location, as alluded to in Voznesensky's poetic query, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", was addressed in the latter part of the 20th century. While his original gravesite was destroyed, his remains were reportedly moved in the late 1950s. By the late 1980s, his story and the location of his grave had regained attention. In October 2000, a memorial service was held at the Trinity Churchyard in Krasnoyarsk where a new white cross was placed on his grave, symbolically reuniting the lovers by bringing soil and a rose from Concepción's grave in California.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
