    "Based on an analysis of the health scaling formula for bosses in Terraria's Expert Mode, which appears to be derived from the game's source code, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players is itself infinite.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n*   In Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 for one player.\n*   For each additional player, the boss's health is increased by a progressively larger multiplier.\n*   For a small number of players (2 to 9), a complex recursive-like formula determines the health multiplier. For example, with two players, the health is increased by 35% to 4,914. For three players, it is 6,976, and for four players, it is 9,565.\n*   Crucially, for 10 or more players, a different formula is applied to the health multiplier. This formula is: `Modified Multiplier = (Unmodified Multiplier * 2 + 8) / 3`.\n*   The \"Unmodified Multiplier\" continues to increase as more players are added. As the number of players `(n)` approaches infinity, the Unmodified Multiplier also approaches infinity.\n*   Because the Unmodified Multiplier grows without bound, the Modified Multiplier, which is roughly two-thirds of the Unmodified Multiplier for very large values, will also grow without bound.\n\nTherefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the health multiplier for the Eye of Cthulhu also approaches infinity. This means there is no theoretical maximum health; it would increase indefinitely.\n\n<<<infinite>>>"
