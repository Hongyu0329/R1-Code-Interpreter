To maximize MM's hypertension treatment, the following three medications are recommended:

*   **Amlodipine:** A long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). CCBs are highly effective first-line agents, particularly in African American patients. Amlodipine will provide potent vasodilation to help lower her blood pressure. This is a suitable choice as only the non-dihydropyridine CCB, verapamil, is listed as a medication she cannot take.
*   **Losartan:** An angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Given MM's diagnosis of diabetes (A1C of 6.7%), guidelines strongly recommend an ACE inhibitor or an ARB to be included in her regimen for both blood pressure control and potential kidney protection. ARBs are often chosen over ACE inhibitors as they do not carry the risk of a persistent cough.
*   **Spironolactone:** A mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA). MM's condition is defined as resistant hypertension because her blood pressure remains above the goal of <130/90 mmHg despite, presumably, being on three antihypertensive agents. For patients with resistant hypertension, guidelines recommend the addition of an MRA like spironolactone as the next therapeutic step. Evidence from multiple studies and meta-analyses, including the PATHWAY-2 trial and 2024 European guidelines, has shown that spironolactone is superior to other potential add-on therapies like beta-blockers or alpha-blockers for reducing blood pressure in this specific population. This medication is not on her list of restricted drugs. Her normal kidney function (SCr = 0.9) allows for its initiation, although her potassium levels will require monitoring.
