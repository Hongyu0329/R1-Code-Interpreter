    "The first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nFrom the search results, the prime factorization of $53599$ is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a primitive Dirichlet character of conductor $d = d_1 d_2 \\dots d_k$ where $d_i$ are pairwise coprime. Then $\\chi$ can be uniquely written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $d_i$. The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple of the orders of the $\\chi_i$.\n\nIn our case, $d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let $\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$, where $\\chi_p$ is a primitive character modulo $p$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is the product of the conductors of the $\\chi_p$, which is $7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31 = 53599$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\nThe number of primitive characters modulo a prime $p$ is $\\phi(p-1)$. The order of a primitive character modulo $p$ must divide $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n\nLet's find the number of primitive characters of the required orders for each prime factor:\n*   **For p=7:** We need characters of order dividing 6. The number of primitive characters modulo 7 is $\\phi(7-1) = \\phi(6) = (2-1)(3-1) = 2$. These have orders 3 and 6. The number of characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$. So there is $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3 and $\\phi(6)=2$ characters of order 6. In total there are 4 primitive characters modulo 7 with orders that are divisors of 6.\n\n*   **For p=13:** We need characters of order dividing 6. The number of primitive characters modulo 13 is $\\phi(13-1) = \\phi(12) = \\phi(4)\\phi(3) = 2 \\times 2 = 4$. Their orders divide 12. We are interested in characters of orders 1, 2, 3, 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6$.\n\n*   **For p=19:** We need characters of order dividing 6. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(19-1)=\\phi(18) = \\phi(2)\\phi(9) = 1 \\times 6 = 6$. We need characters of orders that divide 6. These are characters of orders 1, 2, 3, 6, and the number of such characters is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6$.\n\n*   **For p=31:** We need characters of order dividing 6. The number of primitive characters modulo 31 is $\\phi(31-1) = \\phi(30) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3)\\phi(5) = 1 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 8$. We are interested in characters of orders dividing 6, i.e., orders 1, 2, 3, 6. The number of such is $\\phi(1)+\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+1+2+2 = 6$.\n\nLet $N_p(k)$ be the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ of order $k$.\nLet $k_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. We need $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})=6$.\nThis means that for each prime $q$ dividing 6 (i.e., $q=2,3$), the highest power of $q$ dividing one of the $k_p$ must be $q^1$.\nThis can be computed by finding all combinations of orders $(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$ such that $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$. The number of such characters is the product of the number of characters for each choice of orders, i.e., $\\prod_p N_p(k_p)$.\n\nA more systematic way is to use the formula for the number of characters of order dividing $k$, which is $\\gcd(k, \\phi(d))$.\nLet $N(k)$ be the number of characters of order $k$.\nThe number of characters of order dividing 6 is the sum of characters of order 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nNumber of characters of order dividing 6 = $N(1)+N(2)+N(3)+N(6)$.\nThe number of primitive characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ and order $k$ is given by $\\sum_{k_1 k_2 \\dots k_r=k} \\phi(k_1)\\dots\\phi(k_r)$, where the sum is over all factorizations of $k$ and we must have $\\gcd(k_i, p_i-1)=k_i$.\n\nLet's use an alternative method. Let $G = (\\mathbb{Z}/d\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/19\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\times (\\mathbb{Z}/31\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\nThe group of characters $\\hat{G}$ is isomorphic to $G$.\nThe orders of the cyclic groups are $\\phi(7)=6$, $\\phi(13)=12$, $\\phi(19)=18$, $\\phi(31)=30$.\nLet $n_k$ be the number of elements of order $k$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_m$. This is $\\phi(k)$ if $k|m$ and 0 otherwise.\nLet $C_m = \\mathbb{Z}_m$. The number of elements of order 6 in $C_6 \\times C_{12} \\times C_{18} \\times C_{30}$ is given by the formula:\n$\\sum_{\\text{lcm}(i,j,k,l)=6} \\phi(i)\\phi(j)\\phi(k)\\phi(l)$ where $i|6, j|12, k|18, l|30$.\nThe possible orders are divisors of 6: 1, 2, 3, 6.\nLet's compute the number of elements with order dividing 6, dividing 3, dividing 2 and dividing 1.\n$N_6 = (\\text{number of elements of order dividing 6})$.\n$N_6 = \\gcd(6,6)\\gcd(6,12)\\gcd(6,18)\\gcd(6,30) = 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 \\times 6 = 1296$.\n$N_3 = \\gcd(3,6)\\gcd(3,12)\\gcd(3,18)\\gcd(3,30) = 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 81$.\n$N_2 = \\gcd(2,6)\\gcd(2,12)\\gcd(2,18)\\gcd(2,30) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n$N_1 = \\gcd(1,6)\\gcd(1,12)\\gcd(1,18)\\gcd(1,30) = 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nThe number of elements of order 6 is $N_6 - N_3 - N_2 + N_1 = 1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\nLet's verify this using the orders of the components. Let $A_p$ be the set of orders of primitive characters mod $p$ that divide 6.\n$A_7 = \\{1,2,3,6\\}$. Number of characters: $\\phi(1), \\phi(2), \\phi(3), \\phi(6)$, so 1,1,2,2.\n$A_{13} = \\{1,2,3,6\\}$. Number of characters: 1,1,2,2.\n$A_{19} = \\{1,2,3,6\\}$. Number of characters: 1,1,2,2.\n$A_{31} = \\{1,2,3,6\\}$. Number of characters: 1,1,2,2.\n\nTotal number of characters of order dividing 6: $(1+1+2+2)^4 = 6^4=1296$.\nTotal number of characters of order dividing 3: Orders can be 1 or 3. $(1+2)^4=3^4=81$.\nTotal number of characters of order dividing 2: Orders can be 1 or 2. $(1+1)^4=2^4=16$.\nTotal number of characters of order dividing 1: Order must be 1. $1^4=1$.\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (order dividing 6) - (order dividing 3) - (order dividing 2) + (order dividing 1)\n$= 1296 - 81 - 16 + 1 = 1200$.\n\nAll characters modulo $d=p_1 p_2 \\dots p_r$ are primitive when $d$ is square-free.\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6 is 1200.\n\n<<<1200>>>"
