    "The initial search results confirm that optical activity arises from chirality, which is the absence of a center of symmetry and mirror planes. The key takeaway is that for a crystal to be optically active, it must belong to a non-centrosymmetric point group. The search results also mention that chirality is related to the dissymmetric arrangement of atoms. I need to delve deeper into the definitions of \"achiral\" and \"non-polar\" crystal classes and then cross-reference this with the symmetry requirements for optical activity. My next step should be to find a comprehensive list of the 32 crystal classes and their properties, specifically their centrosymmetry, polarity, and chirality. This will allow me to identify the classes that fit the user's specific criteria.The search results from step 2 have provided a significant breakthrough. Multiple sources explicitly state that there are achiral and non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity. Specifically, the crystal classes m (C_s), mm2 (C_2v),  (S_4), and m (D_2d) are identified. These sources confirm that the conventional understanding of chirality being a strict requirement for optical activity is nuanced in the context of crystal optics.\n\nThe key information gathered is:\n- Optical activity is the rotation of plane-polarized light.\n- Generally, chiral materials (lacking mirror symmetry) are optically active.\n- Some achiral crystal classes can exhibit optical activity.\n- These classes are named as m (C_s), mm2 (C_2v), (S_4), and m (D_2d).\n- These crystal classes are also non-polar.\n\nThe initial plan was to go through the 32 crystal classes and analyze their properties. However, the search results have directly provided the answer with supporting evidence. Therefore, I can now formulate the final response.\n\nAn analysis of crystal symmetry reveals that while optical activity is predominantly associated with chiral materials, there are specific instances of achiral and non-polar crystal classes that also exhibit this property.\n\nOptical activity, the ability of a substance to rotate the plane of polarized light, is fundamentally linked to the absence of a center of symmetry and mirror planes in the material's structure. Materials that lack these symmetry elements are termed chiral.\n\nHowever, a nuanced understanding is required in solid-state physics and crystallography. Certain crystal classes are considered achiral because they possess roto-inversion axes, which include mirror symmetry operations. They are also non-polar, meaning they do not have a net electric dipole moment. Despite this, they can still rotate plane-polarized light.\n\nThe achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are:\n*   **m (C_s)**\n*   **mm2 (C_2v)**\n*   **-4 (S_4)**\n*   **-42m (D_2d)**\n\nThe existence of optical activity in these specific achiral, non-polar crystal classes has been experimentally confirmed. For instance, research on crystals belonging to the -42m class has demonstrated X-ray Natural Circular Dichroism, a form of optical activity, in a non-chiral, non-polar material. This phenomenon occurs because the overall symmetry of the crystal lattice allows for a rotational effect on light, even though the constituent building blocks (molecules or unit cells) may possess mirror symmetry.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are m (C_s), mm2 (C_2v), -4 (S_4), and -42m (D_2d).>>>"
