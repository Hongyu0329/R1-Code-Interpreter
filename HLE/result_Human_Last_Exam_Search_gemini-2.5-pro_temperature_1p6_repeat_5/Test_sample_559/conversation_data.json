    "Answering the question requires finding the separatrices of the given system of differential equations in the phase plane for $u \\geq 0$. A separatrix is a curve in the phase plane that divides it into regions with distinct long-term dynamic behaviors. Typically, the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points serve as separatrices.\n\nThe given system is:\n$$d'(t)=2d^2(t)+(-3u(t)+5u^2(t))d(t)-u(t)(1-u(t))u^2(t)$$\n$$u'(t)=(u(t)-1)u^2(t)$$\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\nFrom $u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0$, we find $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\n*   If $u=0$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 = 0$, which implies $d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, the equation for $d'$ becomes $2d^2 + (-3+5)d - 0 = 0$, so $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, which gives $2d(d+1)=0$. This yields $d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nNext, we analyze the stability of these points by calculating the Jacobian matrix of the system, $J(u,d)$:\n$$ J(u,d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2-2u & 0 \\\\ (10u-3)d-3u^2+4u^3 & 4d-3u+5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n*   At $(1,-1)$:\n    $ J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ (10-3)(-1)-3+4 & 4(-1)-3+5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, the point $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$ are separatrices. Let's find them.\nThe stable manifold corresponds to the eigenvector for $\\lambda_2=-2$.\n$(J - (-2)I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 0 \\\\ -6 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $v_u=0$. The eigenvector is tangent to the line $u=1$. Indeed, the line $u=1$ is the stable manifold for the saddle point.\n\nThe unstable manifold corresponds to the eigenvector for $\\lambda_1=1$.\n$(J - 1I)v = 0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, which gives $-6v_u-3v_d=0$, or $v_d = -2v_u$. The eigenvector is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nWe search for an invariant curve of the form $d=f(u)$ that passes through the saddle point. Let's test if a simple polynomial function is a solution. We can try to guess a particular solution for the Riccati equation for $d$.\nLet's test the function $d = -u^2$.\nWe calculate the derivative with respect to time: $d' = -2u \\cdot u' = -2u \\cdot (u^2(u-1)) = 2u^3 - 2u^4$.\nNow, we substitute $d=-u^2$ into the right-hand side of the first differential equation:\n$$2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$= 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$$\n$$= (2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$$\n$$= -2u^4 + 2u^3$$\nThe expressions match. Therefore, $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution trajectory of the system.\n\nThis curve passes through the equilibrium point $(0,0)$ (since $d(0) = -0^2=0$) and the saddle point $(1,-1)$ (since $d(1) = -1^2=-1$). A trajectory that connects two equilibrium points is a separatrix. The slope of this curve at $(1,-1)$ is $d'(u)|_{u=1} = -2(1) = -2$, which matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector at the saddle point. Thus, the curve $d=-u^2$ represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$. This curve separates the phase plane into regions with different behaviors. For instance, in the region $0<u<1$, trajectories above this curve tend towards $(0, +\\infty)$, while trajectories below it tend towards $(0, -\\infty)$.\n\nThe separatrix of the system is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
