    "In the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions (specifically in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions), the leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, often denoted as u*, can be determined through the epsilon expansion. This fixed point is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nThe analysis involves calculating the beta function, which describes how the coupling constant changes with the energy scale. To the leading order in the coupling `u`, the beta function is given by:\n\nβ(u) = -ϵu + Bu²\n\nHere, ϵ = 4 - d represents the deviation from four dimensions. The constant B depends on the specific conventions and normalization used for the coupling constant. For a scalar field theory with a single component (N=1), a common result for the beta function with coupling λ is:\n\nβ(λ) = -ϵλ + (3λ²)/(16π²)\n\nA fixed point λ* is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero, meaning the coupling no longer changes with the energy scale. Setting the beta function to zero yields two solutions: a trivial one at λ* = 0 (the Gaussian fixed point) and the non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n\nBy solving β(λ*) = 0 for the non-trivial case, we find:\n\n-ϵλ* + (3(λ*)²)/(16π²) = 0\n\nThis gives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling:\n\nλ* = (16π²/3)ϵ\n\nIt is important to note that different normalizations of the coupling constant are used in literature. If a rescaled coupling `u = λ / (16π²) ` is used, the beta function becomes β(u) = -ϵu + 3u², which leads to a fixed point at `u* = ϵ/3`. Regardless of the normalization, the key result is that the fixed point coupling is directly proportional to ϵ at the leading order.\n\n<<<u* = (16π²/3)ε>>>"
