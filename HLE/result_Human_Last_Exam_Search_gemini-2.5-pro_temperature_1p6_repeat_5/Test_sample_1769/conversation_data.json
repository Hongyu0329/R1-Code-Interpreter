    "Without the linguistic influence of the Norse invasions and interactions with the Anglo-Saxons between the 7th and 12th centuries, the Modern English word for a female sibling would have evolved directly from the Old English word, which was \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\".\n\nThe current word \"sister\" is a product of a linguistic blend. While it has roots in the Old English \"sweostor,\" its modern form, particularly the 'i' vowel, was directly influenced by the Old Norse word \"systir\". This interaction began with the Viking raids and the subsequent settlement in the Danelaw, which led to significant borrowing of Old Norse words into the English language, including fundamental vocabulary like \"egg,\" \"knife,\" \"leg,\" and even grammatical words like the pronouns \"they,\" \"them,\" and \"their\".\n\nIn the absence of this Norse influence, the Old English \"sweostor\" or \"swuster\" would have followed a different evolutionary path. During the Middle English period, it existed as \"suster\". Following the typical sound changes that transformed Middle English into Modern English, similar to how \"brōþor\" became \"brother\", the word \"suster\" would have likely retained its form.\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word would most probably be **suster**.\n\n<<<suster>>>"
