    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman.\n\nPhysicist Murray Gell-Mann, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his work on the theory of elementary particles, appeared in one of Enron's \"Ask Why\" commercials. In a recorded talk, Gell-Mann confirmed his participation, stating he was asked to discuss the question \"Why not?\".\n\nPaul Krugman, who was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, also had a connection to Enron. He served on Enron's advisory board in 1999 for which he was paid. He disclosed this relationship in a column for the New York Times. While he was associated with the company, direct evidence of his appearance in the \"Ask Why\" television commercials from 2000 is less definitive than that of Gell-Mann.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Paul Krugman>>>"
