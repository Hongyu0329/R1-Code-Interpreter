    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nThis is based on the molecular formula of a well-documented nanocar, C430H274O12. The term \"perfluoro\" indicates that all of the hydrogen (H) atoms in the original molecule are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n\nThe specific nanocar in question has 274 hydrogen atoms in its structure. In a perfluorinated version, each of these hydrogen atoms would be substituted with a fluorine atom. Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms, resulting in a total of 274 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<274>>>"
