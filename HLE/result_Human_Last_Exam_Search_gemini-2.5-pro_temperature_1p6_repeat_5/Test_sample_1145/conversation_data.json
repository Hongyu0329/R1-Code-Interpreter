    "To determine the probability that a particle in a one-dimensional box is located in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 quantum state, we must calculate the integral of the probability density function over this specific interval.\n\n### 1. The Wavefunction and Probability Density\n\nThe normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\n`ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n\nFor the n=2 state (the first excited state), the wavefunction is:\n`ψ₂(x) = √(2/a) * sin(2πx/a)`\n\nThe probability density, `P(x)`, is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude.\n`P(x) = |ψ₂(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a)`\n\n### 2. Setting up the Probability Integral\n\nThe probability `P` of finding the particle in the interval from `x₁ = 0.495a` to `x₂ = 0.505a` is the integral of the probability density function over this range.\n`P = ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n### 3. Solving the Integral\n\nTo solve this integral, we can use the trigonometric identity `sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2`.\n`sin²(2πx/a) = (1 - cos(4πx/a))/2`\n\nSubstituting this into the integral gives:\n`P = (2/a) ∫(from 0.495a to 0.505a) (1/2) * (1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx`\n`P = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)]` evaluated from `0.495a` to `0.505a`.\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression at the limits:\n`P = (1/a) * { [0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)] - [0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)] }`\n`P = (0.505 - 0.495) - (1/4π) * [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]`\n\nUsing the identities `sin(2π + θ) = sin(θ)` and `sin(2π - θ) = -sin(θ)`:\n`P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))]`\n`P = 0.01 - (1/4π) * [2sin(0.02π)]`\n`P = 0.01 - sin(0.02π)/(2π)`\n\n### 4. Numerical Calculation\n\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value:\n`P ≈ 0.01 - sin(0.02 * 3.14159) / (2 * 3.14159)`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - sin(0.06283) / 6.28318`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - 0.06279 / 6.28318`\n`P ≈ 0.01 - 0.0099935`\n`P ≈ 0.00000647`\n\nThis result is very small, which is expected. The interval `[0.495a, 0.505a]` is centered at `x = 0.5a`, which is a node for the n=2 wavefunction. At a node, the probability density is exactly zero. Therefore, the probability of finding the particle in a very narrow interval around this node is extremely low.\n\n<<<0.00000647>>>"
