The expression for the Electrical double-layer potential distribution $\psi(y)$ is:
$$
\psi(y) = z_1(1+\beta k) \frac{\sinh(k(H-y))}{\sinh(kH)}
$$
where:
-   $\psi(y)$ is the electrical potential at a distance $y$ from the bottom surface.
-   $z_1$ is the slip-independent zeta potential of the bottom surface.
-   $\beta$ is the slip length.
-   $k$ is the Debye-HÃ¼ckel parameter.
-   $H$ is the height of the microchannel.
-   $y$ is the coordinate across the channel height, with $y=0$ at the bottom surface and $y=H$ at the top surface.
