    "When the spiroketal `CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1` is added to a solution of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, it undergoes acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. K-etals are known to be stable in basic conditions but readily hydrolyze back to their corresponding ketone and alcohol components in the presence of acid.\n\nThe reaction proceeds as follows:\nKetal + H₂O --(H⁺)--> Ketone + Diol\n\nBased on the provided SMILES string, the spiroketal is formed from a ketone that has a methyl group (`C`) and a phenyl group (`C1=CC=CC=C1`) attached to the carbonyl carbon. This ketone is acetophenone. The other product is a diol, which corresponds to the remainder of the bicyclic structure.\n\nThe two products of the hydrolysis are:\n1.  **Acetophenone**: The ketone product. Its chemical formula is C₈H₈O, and its molar mass is approximately 120.15 g/mol.\n2.  **A Diol**: The exact structure of the diol is difficult to determine from the unconventional SMILES string provided. However, common diols used to form ketals, such as ethylene glycol (molar mass 62.07 g/mol) or propane-1,3-diol (molar mass 76.09 g/mol), have molar masses significantly lower than acetophenone. For the diol to be heavier than acetophenone, its molar mass would need to exceed 120.15 g/mol, which would require a carbon skeleton of at least seven carbon atoms (e.g., C₇H₁₆O₂ has a molar mass of 132.16 g/mol). Given no other information, it is most probable that acetophenone is the product with the higher molar mass.\n\nThe product with the higher molar mass is therefore acetophenone.\n\n<<<CC(=O)C1=CC=CC=C1>>>"
