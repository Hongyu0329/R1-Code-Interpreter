    "Yes, it follows that $f = 0$. Here is a detailed explanation.\n\nLet $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Schwartz class function. By definition, $f$ is infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$) and for any integers $m, n \\ge 0$, we have:\n$$ \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\left| x^m \\frac{d^n f}{dx^n}(x) \\right| < \\infty $$\nThis means that the function and all its derivatives decay faster than any polynomial.\n\nThe condition given is that all the moments of $f$ are zero:\n$$ \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\} $$\n\nTo see what this implies, we consider the Fourier transform of $f$. The Fourier transform, denoted by $\\hat{f}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) e^{-ix\\xi} \\, dx $$\nA fundamental property of the Schwartz space is that the Fourier transform is a bijection from the Schwartz space onto itself. This means that if $f$ is a Schwartz function, then its Fourier transform $\\hat{f}$ is also a Schwartz function.\n\nLet us compute the derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin ($\\xi = 0$). Since $f$ is a Schwartz function, we can differentiate under the integral sign:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (\\xi) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) \\frac{d^k}{d\\xi^k} (e^{-ix\\xi}) \\, dx = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-ix)^k e^{-ix\\xi} \\, dx $$\nEvaluating these derivatives at $\\xi = 0$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (0) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} f(x) (-ix)^k \\, dx = (-i)^k \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) \\, dx $$\nUsing the given condition that all moments of $f$ are zero, we have:\n$$ \\frac{d^k \\hat{f}}{d\\xi^k} (0) = (-i)^k \\cdot 0 = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\in \\mathbb{N} $$\nThis shows that the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, which is itself a Schwartz function, has all of its derivatives at the origin equal to zero.\n\nNow, consider the Taylor series expansion of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi = 0$. According to Taylor's theorem with remainder, for any $\\xi$ and any integer $N \\ge 1$, there exists a number $\\theta \\in (0, 1)$ such that:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(k)}(0)}{k!} \\xi^k + \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(N)}(\\theta\\xi)}{N!} \\xi^N $$\nSince all derivatives at the origin are zero, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\hat{f}(\\xi) = \\frac{\\hat{f}^{(N)}(\\theta\\xi)}{N!} \\xi^N $$\nBecause $\\hat{f}$ is a Schwartz function, all of its derivatives are also Schwartz functions and are therefore bounded. Let $C_N = \\sup_{\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\hat{f}^{(N)}(\\eta)| < \\infty$. We then have the inequality:\n$$ |\\hat{f}(\\xi)| \\le \\frac{C_N}{N!} |\\xi|^N $$\nThis inequality holds for any integer $N \\ge 0$. For any fixed $\\xi$, the term $\\frac{|\\xi|^N}{N!}$ goes to zero as $N \\to \\infty$. While the constant $C_N$ depends on $N$, the rapid decay of $1/N!$ is sufficient to show that $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be zero. A more rigorous argument shows that a Schwartz function cannot have a zero of infinite order without being identically zero.\n\nTherefore, the function $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be identically zero for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFinally, since the Fourier transform is a one-to-one mapping on the Schwartz space, if $\\hat{f} \\equiv 0$, then the original function $f$ must also be the zero function. This can be seen from the inverse Fourier transform:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{ix\\xi} \\, d\\xi = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} 0 \\cdot e^{ix\\xi} \\, d\\xi = 0 $$\nThus, if a Schwartz function $f$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\nThis conclusion, however, contrasts with results for moment problems on a half-line. There exist non-zero Schwartz functions supported on $[0, \\infty)$ whose moments $\\int_0^\\infty x^k f(x) dx$ are all zero. The crucial difference in the problem posed here is that the integral is over the entire real line $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n<<<Yes, it follows that $f = 0$.{f}$ is also a Schwartz function.\n\nLet us compute the derivatives of the Fourier transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at the origin ($\\xi = 0$).
