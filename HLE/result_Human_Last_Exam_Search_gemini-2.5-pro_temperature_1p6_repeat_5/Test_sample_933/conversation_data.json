    "Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is synthesized by the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gas. The most commonly cited and efficient method for its preparation involves heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine in a 1:5 molar ratio in a nickel container to a temperature of 400°C. The reaction is typically carried out at a pressure of about 6 atmospheres.\n\nThe synthesis of xenon fluorides is highly dependent on the reaction temperature. At lower temperatures, the formation of xenon difluoride (XeF₂) is favored, while at higher temperatures and with an excess of fluorine, xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) is the preferred product. This positions the optimal production of xenon tetrafluoride at an intermediate temperature.\n\nWhile reaction products of xenon and fluorine have been observed at temperatures as low as 270°C, this is generally for the production of XeF₂. For the efficient and specific synthesis of XeF₄, the established temperature is 400°C. A patent for the process specifies a temperature range of 350 to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature for a quantitative reaction. Flow methods have also been described using a temperature range of 300-500°C, but these can result in contamination with XeF₂.\n\nGiven the provided choices, 400°C is the well-documented temperature for the efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n\n<<<B>>>"
