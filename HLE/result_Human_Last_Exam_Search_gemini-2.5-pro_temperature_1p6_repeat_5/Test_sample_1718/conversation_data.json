    "On a general n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor possesses a number of symmetries which reduce its number of independent components to `n^2(n^2 - 1)/12`.\n\nA Kähler manifold is a complex manifold with a complex dimension *n* (and therefore a real dimension of *2n*) that has a compatible Riemannian metric and a symplectic structure. This intricate structure introduces additional symmetries to the Riemann tensor, further constraining its independent entries.\n\nThe essential additional symmetries for the Riemann tensor *R* on a Kähler manifold with complex structure *J* are:\n*R(X, Y, Z, W) = R(JX, JY, Z, W) = R(X, Y, JZ, JW)*.\n\nThese relations, combined with the standard symmetries, lead to a significant simplification. When expressed in a local complex coordinate system, the only components of the Riemann tensor that do not vanish are of the form `R_i anti-j k anti-l`, and these are subject to further symmetries.\n\nDue to these extensive symmetries, the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n* is not given by the general formula for a real *2n*-dimensional manifold, but is instead `(n(n+1)/2)^2`.\n\nTo illustrate:\n*   For a complex dimension *n* = 1 (a real 2D manifold, like a Riemann surface), the number of independent components is (1(2)/2)² = 1. This matches the general formula for a 2D Riemannian manifold.\n*   For a complex dimension *n* = 2 (a real 4D manifold), the number of independent components is (2(3)/2)² = 3² = 9. This is considerably less than the 20 independent components for a general 4D Riemannian manifold.\n\nThe number of independent entries for the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension *n* is given by the formula:\n\n(n(n+1)/2)²\n\n<<< (n(n+1)/2)^2 >>>"
