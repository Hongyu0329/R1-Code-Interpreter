    "The maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not a complete graph, is 12344.\n\nHere is the reasoning:\n\n1.  **Chromatic Number Basics**: The chromatic number of a graph, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required for a proper vertex coloring. A proper coloring ensures that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. For any graph with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$. The only graph that requires $n$ colors is the complete graph $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n2.  **Constraint on the Graph**: The problem states that the graph $G$ has $n = 12345$ vertices and is not the complete graph $K_{12345}$. Since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than 12345. This means $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n3.  **Achieving the Maximum**: To show that 12344 is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to demonstrate that there exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not complete, and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\n4.  **Constructing the Graph**: Consider a graph $G$ that is composed of two disconnected components:\n    *   A complete graph $K_{12344}$ on 12344 vertices.\n    *   A single isolated vertex.\n\n    This graph $G$ has a total of $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. Because it is disconnected, it is not a complete graph.\n\n5.  **Coloring the Constructed Graph**: The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n    *   The chromatic number of the complete graph $K_{12344}$ is 12344.\n    *   The chromatic number of an isolated vertex is 1.\n\n    Therefore, the chromatic number of $G$ is $\\chi(G) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nThis construction demonstrates that a chromatic number of 12344 is achievable for a non-complete graph with 12345 vertices. Thus, the maximum number of colors required is 12344.\n\nThis result relates to Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. In our constructed graph, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12343$ (the degree of any vertex in the $K_{12344}$ component), while the chromatic number is $12344$. This case, where $\\chi(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$, is possible because one of the graph's components is a complete graph, which is an exception covered by the conditions of Brooks' theorem.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
