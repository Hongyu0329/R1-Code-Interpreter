The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control check. This check used a sensitive lab strain of *Bacillus subtilis* and showed the "expected result" of no growth. However, this result was misleading because the person who prepared Batch 3 had added the heat-sensitive antibiotic, chloramphenicol, *before* autoclaving, which destroyed its effectiveness. The QC test was not sufficient to detect this failure, leading the lab to falsely conclude that the antibiotic was active and the media was safe for use.
