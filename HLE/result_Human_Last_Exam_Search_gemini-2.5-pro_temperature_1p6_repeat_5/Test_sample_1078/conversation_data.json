    "There are 18 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThese are categorized into irreducible and reducible groups. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram.\n\n**Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nAn irreducible Weyl group is one whose Dynkin diagram is connected. The classification of finite irreducible Weyl groups includes the families A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, and the exceptional groups E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, and G_2. The subscript indicates the rank of the group. For a rank of 4, the irreducible Weyl groups are:\n*   A₄\n*   B₄\n*   C₄\n*   D₄\n*   F₄\n\nThis gives a total of 5 irreducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Reducible Finite Weyl Groups of Rank 4**\n\nA reducible Weyl group is one whose Dynkin diagram is disconnected, and it is isomorphic to the direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of a reducible group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. To find all non-isomorphic reducible Weyl groups of rank 4, we consider all partitions of the number 4 and the non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of ranks 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups of lower ranks are:\n*   **Rank 1:** A₁ (note that B₁ and C₁ are isomorphic to A₁)\n*   **Rank 2:** A₂, B₂ (which is isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n*   **Rank 3:** A₃ (which is isomorphic to D₃), B₃, C₃\n\nThe partitions of 4 lead to the following combinations of direct products:\n\n1.  **Partition 3 + 1:**\n    *   A₃ × A₁\n    *   B₃ × A₁\n    *   C₃ × A₁\n\n2.  **Partition 2 + 2:**\n    *   A₂ × A₂\n    *   A₂ × B₂\n    *   A₂ × G₂\n    *   B₂ × B₂\n    *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   G₂ × G₂\n\n3.  **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   B₂ × A₁ × A₁\n    *   G₂ × A₁ × A₁\n\n4.  **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:**\n    *   A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁\n\nThis gives a total of 3 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 13 reducible finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nCombining the irreducible and reducible cases, the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is 5 + 13 = 18.\n\n<<<18>>>"
