    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is, in fact, infinite-dimensional. This is because the equations are invariant under Galilean transformations with arbitrary time-dependent translation vectors and under arbitrary time-dependent additions to the pressure.\n\nHowever, it is standard to consider the maximal *finite-dimensional* Lie algebra of symmetries. The dimension of this Lie group is 12.\n\nThe symmetries that generate this 12-dimensional Lie group are:\n*   **Time translation** (1 dimension): Shifting the time coordinate, $t \\to t + a$.\n*   **Space translations** (3 dimensions): Shifting the spatial coordinates, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$.\n*   **Spatial rotations** (3 dimensions): Rotating the spatial coordinates, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$, where $R$ is a rotation matrix in SO(3).\n*   **Galilean boosts** (3 dimensions): Transforming to a constantly moving inertial frame, $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{v}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}$.\n*   **Scaling transformations** (1 dimension): A dilation of space, time, velocity, and pressure according to a single parameter, often of the form $t \\to \\lambda^2 t, \\mathbf{x} \\to \\lambda\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to \\lambda^{-1}\\mathbf{u}, p \\to \\lambda^{-2}p$.\n*   **Pressure shift** (1 dimension): A constant shift in the pressure, $p \\to p + c$.\n\nThe total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of these independent transformations: $1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 12$.\n\n<<<12>>>"
