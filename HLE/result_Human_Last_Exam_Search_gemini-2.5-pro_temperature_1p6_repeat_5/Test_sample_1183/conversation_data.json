    "The molecule represented by the SMILES string `C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` is a type of substituted triangulene. The core of this molecule is triangulene, which is known for its planar structure and threefold symmetry. Unsubstituted triangulene has a D3h symmetry point group.\n\nThe molecule in question has three ethynyl (–C≡C–H) groups attached to its corners. These linear substituents are placed symmetrically on the planar triangulene core. This symmetric substitution does not break the key symmetry elements of the D3h point group:\n\n*   A principal C3 axis of rotation (threefold).\n*   Three C2 axes of rotation perpendicular to the C3 axis.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the plane of the molecule itself.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv).\n*   An S3 improper rotation axis.\n\nBecause the ethynyl groups do not disrupt these symmetry elements, the entire molecule retains the D3h symmetry of the triangulene core.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
