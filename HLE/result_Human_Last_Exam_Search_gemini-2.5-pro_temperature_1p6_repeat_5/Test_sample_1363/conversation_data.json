    "In the Viennese Waltz, it is considered technically impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the fundamental principles of the dance. This is due to the dance's high speed, continuous rotation, and the specific footwork involved.\n\nThe Viennese Waltz reverse turn is characterized by a crossing action of the feet for both the leader and follower. The dance moves at a rapid tempo, and the couple rotates continuously down the line of dance. While a standard reverse turn completes one full rotation over six steps, navigating a corner on the dance floor would necessitate an overturn. However, attempting to add more rotation to the reverse turn at such a high speed is exceedingly difficult and disrupts the couple's balance and momentum, particularly for the partner moving forward. For this reason, it is standard practice to use natural turns, which can be under-turned, to navigate the corners of the dance floor. It is easier to reduce the amount of turn in a natural turn than it is to add turn to a reverse turn. Consequently, attempting to overturn a reverse turn in Viennese Waltz is considered a violation of its technique, as it makes the figure practically un-danceable in a fluid and controlled manner. Dancers will instead typically change from reverse turns to natural turns before reaching a corner.\n\nIn the other dances listed, while overturning a reverse turn may be considered poor technique in certain contexts, it is not deemed impossible:\n\n*   **English Waltz:** The slower tempo allows for more variation in the amount of turn, and overturned figures are sometimes used for choreographic effect.\n*   **European Tango:** The character of the Tango, with its staccato action, is different from the continuous flow of the Viennese Waltz. While specific alignments are required, there isn't the same inherent technical barrier to overturning a reverse turn.\n*   **Slow Foxtrot:** While it is a technical error for the lady to overturn her heel turn within the reverse turn, this applies to a specific part of the figure and not the entire turn itself being impossible to overturn.\n*   **Quickstep:** Like the English Waltz, Quickstep has instances of overturned figures, and variations in the amount of turn are common in advanced choreography.\n\nTherefore, the unique combination of speed, continuous rotation, and footwork in the Viennese Waltz makes overturning the reverse turn a technical impossibility without compromising the essence of the dance.\n\n<<<A>>>"
