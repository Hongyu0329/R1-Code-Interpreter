    "In a 100BB rake-free cash game, the absence of rake incentivizes a wider opening range from all positions, especially from the button, where you are guaranteed to have a positional advantage post-flop. While pre-flop opening ranges can vary slightly based on the specific GTO (Game Theory Optimal) solver and its inputs, modern solvers for rake-free environments indicate a very wide opening range from the button.\n\nAnalysis of various GTO-based pre-flop charts and poker theory indicates that you should be opening a significant portion of your suited hands from the button. Some simplified or more conservative charts suggest opening J6s and better. However, in a rake-free environment, this range expands. More comprehensive charts and GTO solutions show that weaker suited jacks are also profitable opens. Specifically, GTO Wizard's analysis suggests that hands as weak as J4s can be included in the button's opening range under certain conditions.\n\nConsidering a standard, simplified GTO opening range for a rake-free 100bb cash game from the button, the worst suited jack that is consistently considered a profitable open is J5s.\n\n<<<J5s>>>"
