    "In the provided chess position, with the FEN \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\", White's optimal move is clear.\n\nAn analysis of the position reveals that White has a decisive, winning move. The black queen on c5 is the sole defender of the vulnerable c3 square and is also crucial in restraining White's passed d-pawn.\n\nWhite's best move is to capture the pawn on c3 with the queen.\n\n<<<Qxc3>>>"
