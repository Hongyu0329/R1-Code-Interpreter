    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we must first understand how many functions this basis set assigns to each type of atom.\n\n### Toluene Composition\nToluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it is composed of:\n*   7 Carbon atoms\n*   8 Hydrogen atoms\n\n### 6-31G Basis Set for Each Atom\n\nThe notation \"6-31G\" describes a split-valence basis set. Here's how it breaks down for each atom type:\n\n*   **For each Carbon atom (a heavy atom):**\n    *   The core (1s) orbital is described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n    *   The valence shell is split into two parts (double-zeta). For carbon, the valence orbitals are 2s and 2p.\n        *   The inner part of the valence shell (2s and 2p orbitals) is described by one contracted function per orbital, each made from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   The outer part of the valence shell is described by one contracted function per orbital, each made from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Therefore, for each carbon atom, we have:\n        *   1 function for the 1s orbital.\n        *   2 functions for the 2s orbital.\n        *   2 functions for each of the three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz), totaling 6 functions.\n    *   In total, each carbon atom has 1 + 2 + 6 = 9 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen atom:**\n    *   Hydrogen only has a valence shell (1s orbital) and no core orbitals.\n    *   The 1s orbital is also split into two parts:\n        *   An inner part represented by one contracted function made of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   An outer part represented by one contracted function made of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   Thus, each hydrogen atom has 1 + 1 = 2 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n### Total Calculation\nNow, we can calculate the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for the entire toluene molecule:\n\n*   **For the 7 Carbon atoms:** 7 atoms × 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n*   **For the 8 Hydrogen atoms:** 8 atoms × 2 functions/atom = 16 functions\n\n**Total Contracted Gaussian Functions** = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
