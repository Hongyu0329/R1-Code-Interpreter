    "Based on an analysis of the provided sequence, every number is divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it is an even number and the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The final two numbers in the sequence are 2340 and 2352. The difference between them is 12 (2352 - 2340 = 12). A simple continuation of this pattern would be to add 12 to the last number.\n\n2352 + 12 = 2364\n\nTo verify, the sum of the digits of 2364 is 2 + 3 + 6 + 4 = 15, which is divisible by 3, and 2364 is an even number. Therefore, 2364 is divisible by 6, which is a consistent property of the sequence.\n\n<<<2364>>>"
