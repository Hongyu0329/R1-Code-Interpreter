    "In the framework of renormalization group theory, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat of a system near its critical point can be calculated using the epsilon (ε) expansion. This method involves a perturbative expansion in the parameter ε = d_c - d, where d_c is the upper critical dimension and d is the spatial dimension of the system.\n\nFor a system described by the O(n)-symmetric φ⁴ field theory, which includes the Ising model (n=1) universality class, the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4. The question specifies a spatial dimension of d=3. Therefore, the expansion parameter is ε = 4 - 3 = 1.\n\nThe critical exponent α is related to the correlation length exponent ν through the hyperscaling relation 2 - α = dν, which is valid for dimensions below the upper critical dimension. The epsilon expansion for the correlation length exponent ν to the first order in ε is given by:\nν ≈ 1/2 + [(n+2)/(4(n+8))]ε\n\nUsing the hyperscaling relation (with d = 4 - ε), we can derive the first-order expansion for α:\n2 - α = (4 - ε) * [1/2 + (n+2)/(4(n+8))ε]\n2 - α ≈ 2 + [(n+2)/(n+8)]ε - ε/2\n-α ≈ [ (2(n+2) - (n+8)) / (2(n+8)) ]ε\n-α ≈ [ (2n + 4 - n - 8) / (2(n+8)) ]ε\n-α ≈ [ (n - 4) / (2(n+8)) ]ε\nα ≈ [ (4 - n) / (2(n+8)) ]ε\n\nFor a standard magnetic system without a specified symmetry, the Ising universality class (n=1) is typically assumed. Substituting n=1 and ε=1 into this formula gives the value for the specific heat exponent α:\n\nα ≈ [ (4 - 1) / (2(1+8)) ] * 1\nα ≈ 3 / (2 * 9)\nα ≈ 3 / 18\nα ≈ 1/6\n\nThus, to first order in the epsilon expansion, the specific heat exponent for a system in the Ising universality class at d=3 is approximately 1/6.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
