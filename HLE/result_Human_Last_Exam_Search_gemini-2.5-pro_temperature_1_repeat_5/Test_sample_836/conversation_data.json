    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, G(r,t), is commonly known as the **dynamic structure factor**, denoted as S(Q,ω) or sometimes S(k,ω), in the nuclear criticality community. This terminology is consistent with its use in the broader fields of condensed matter physics and neutron scattering.\n\nThe generalized pair correlation function, introduced by Léon Van Hove, describes the probability of finding a particle at a certain position and time, given that another particle was at the origin at time zero. Its double Fourier transform, the dynamic structure factor, provides crucial information about the energy and momentum transfer during scattering events.\n\nIn the context of nuclear criticality safety, the dynamic structure factor is a key component of the **thermal scattering law**, often expressed as S(α,β) in nuclear data libraries. This law is essential for accurately modeling the interaction of thermal neutrons with moderating and scattering materials in nuclear systems. Precise knowledge of the thermal scattering law, and therefore the dynamic structure factor, is critical for calculating the effective multiplication factor (k-eff) and ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors and fissile material handling operations. Nuclear data processing codes, such as NJOY, use the dynamic structure factor to generate the thermal scattering cross-section data that are then used in simulation tools like MCNP for criticality analysis.\n\n<<<dynamic structure factor"
