    "The man Andrei Voznesensky called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" is Nikolai Rezanov.\n\nThis Russian nobleman and diplomat (1764-1807) was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and the effort to colonize parts of North America. His journey to California in 1806, where he sought provisions for the starving Russian settlement in Alaska, became the basis for a famous love story between him and Concepción Argüello, the daughter of the commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco.\n\nVoznesensky's poem, which became the libretto for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" tells this story. Rezanov died of fever and exhaustion in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his return journey to St. Petersburg in 1807. He was buried at the Resurrection Cathedral, but his grave was later destroyed. For many years, the exact location of his remains was unknown, prompting Voznesensky's line, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\". His remains were eventually reburied, and in 2000, a new memorial cross was dedicated at his grave in the Trinity churchyard of Krasnoyarsk.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
