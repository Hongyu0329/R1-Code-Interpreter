    "An integral equation of the form `u(x) = f(x) + λ ∫ₐᵇ K(x, y) u(y) dy` is known as a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The given equation is:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n\nHere, the inhomogeneous term is `f(x) = 1` and the kernel is `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`.\n\n### Analysis of the Kernel\nThe kernel can be expressed as a finite sum:\n`K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ xⁿ⁻ⁱ yⁱ⁻¹`\nThis shows that the kernel is separable (or degenerate). A kernel is separable if it can be written in the form `K(x, y) = ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ gᵢ(x)hᵢ(y)`. In this case, `gᵢ(x) = xⁿ⁻ⁱ` and `hᵢ(y) = yⁱ⁻¹`.\n\n### Reduction to a System of Linear Equations\nSubstituting the separable kernel into the integral equation gives:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ xⁿ⁻ⁱ ∫₀¹ yⁱ⁻¹ u(y) dy`\n\nLet `cᵢ = ∫₀¹ yⁱ⁻¹ u(y) dy`. These `cᵢ` are constants. The solution `u(x)` must then have the form:\n`u(x) = 1 + λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ cᵢ xⁿ⁻ⁱ`\n\nTo find the constants `cⱼ`, we substitute this form of `u(x)` back into the definition of `cⱼ`:\n`cⱼ = ∫₀¹ yʲ⁻¹ (1 + λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ cᵢ yⁿ⁻ⁱ) dy`\n`cⱼ = ∫₀¹ yʲ⁻¹ dy + λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ cᵢ ∫₀¹ yʲ⁻¹⁺ⁿ⁻ⁱ dy`\n`cⱼ = [yʲ/j]₀¹ + λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ cᵢ [yⁿ⁺ʲ⁻ⁱ / (n+j-i)]₀¹`\n`cⱼ = 1/j + λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ cᵢ / (n+j-i)`\n\nThis can be written as a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c₁, c₂, ..., cₙ`:\n`cⱼ - λ ∑ᵢ<binary data, 1 bytes>₁ⁿ (1 / (n+j-i)) cᵢ = 1/j` for `j = 1, 2, ..., n`.\n\nIn matrix form, this system is `(I - λA)C = B`, where:\n*   `C` is the column vector of the unknown coefficients `[c₁, ..., cₙ]ᵀ`.\n*   `B` is the column vector `[1, 1/2, ..., 1/n]ᵀ`.\n*   `A` is an `n x n` matrix with elements `Aⱼᵢ = 1 / (n+j-i)`.\n\n### Condition for No Solutions\nAccording to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of linear equations (and thus the integral equation) has no solution if and only if:\n1.  The determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero: `det(I - λA) = 0`.\n2.  The vector `B` is not in the column space of `(I - λA)`.\n\nThe first condition, `det(I - λA) = 0`, implies that `1/λ` must be an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`. The values of `λ` that satisfy this are called the characteristic values of the integral equation.\n\nThe second condition means that the inhomogeneous term `f(x)=1` is not orthogonal to the null space of the adjoint homogeneous integral equation. It can be shown that for this specific kernel, this condition is always met for all characteristic values of `λ`.\n\nTherefore, the integral equation has no solution for all values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the matrix `A`.\n\n### Examples\n**Case n = 1:**\nThe equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ u(y) dy`.\nThe matrix `A` is a 1x1 matrix: `A₁₁ = 1/(1+1-1) = 1`.\nThe only eigenvalue of `A` is `μ = 1`.\nThe equation has no solution for `λ = 1/μ = 1`.\n\n**Case n = 2:**\nThe equation is `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ (x+y)u(y) dy`.\nThe matrix `A` is:\n`A = [[1/(2+1-1), 1/(2+1-2)], [1/(2+2-1), 1/(2+2-2)]] = [[1/2, 1], [1/3, 1/2]]`\nThe characteristic equation for the eigenvalues `μ` of `A` is `det(A - μI) = 0`:\n`(1/2 - μ)² - 1/3 = 0`\n`1/2 - μ = ±1/√3`\n`μ = 1/2 ± 1/√3`\nThe values of `λ` for which there is no solution are the reciprocals of these eigenvalues:\n`λ = 1 / (1/2 ± 1/√3) = 2 / (1 ± 2/√3) = 2√3 / (√3 ± 2)`\n`λ₁ = 2√3(√3 - 2) / (3 - 4) = -6 + 4√3`\n`λ₂ = 2√3(√3 + 2) / (3 - 4) = -6 - 4√3`\n\n### General Conclusion\nFor a general integer `n`, the equation `u(x) = 1 + λ ∫₀¹ dy (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y) u(y)` has no solution for values of `λ` that are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the `n x n` matrix `A` defined by `Aⱼᵢ = 1 / (n+j-i)`.\n\n<<<The values of λ for which the equation has no solutions are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of the n x n matrix A, where the elements of the matrix are given by A(j,i) = 1/(n+j-i).>>>"
