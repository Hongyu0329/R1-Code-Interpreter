    "Assuming optimal play from both sides, White can win in 4 moves.\n\nThe winning sequence is a forced checkmate initiated by the move Queen takes pawn on f7. Here is the move-by-move breakdown:\n\n1.  **Qxf7+** The game begins with this move, forcing the black king to the h7 square.\n2.  **... Kh7** This is the only legal response for Black.\n3.  **Bg6+** White continues the attack, leaving Black with only one move to escape immediate checkmate.\n4.  **... Kh8** If Black had chosen to capture the bishop (...fxg6), White would have checkmated with either Qf8# or Rxf8#.\n5.  **Qf8+** White sacrifices the queen to clear the path for the rook.\n6.  **... Rxf8** Black is forced to capture the white queen.\n7.  **Rxf8#** White delivers the final checkmate.\n\n<<<4>>>"
