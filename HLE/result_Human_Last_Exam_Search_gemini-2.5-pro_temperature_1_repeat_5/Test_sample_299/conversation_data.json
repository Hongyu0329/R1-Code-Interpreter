    "The cardinality of the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy the equation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted by $\\mathfrak{c}$ or $|\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at this conclusion:\n\n### 1. Basic Properties of the Function *f*\n\n*   **Injectivity:** The function must be injective (one-to-one). If we assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$. This implies $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$, and since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective function, it follows that $x_1 = x_2$.\n*   **Monotonicity:** A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n### 2. Analysis of Potential Decreasing Solutions\n\nLet's assume that $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n*   A strictly decreasing continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have a unique fixed point. That is, there must exist a real number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n*   If such a fixed point exists, then applying $f$ again gives $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n*   From the original equation, this means $\\exp(x_0) = x_0$.\n*   However, the equation $\\exp(x) = x$ has no real solutions, as the graph of $y = \\exp(x)$ always lies above the graph of $y = x$.\n*   This contradiction proves that there can be no strictly decreasing continuous solutions to the equation.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Potential Increasing Solutions\n\nNow, let's assume that $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n*   If $f$ is strictly increasing, its composition with itself, $f \\circ f$, is also strictly increasing. This is consistent with the right-hand side of the equation, $\\exp(x)$, which is a strictly increasing function.\n*   The existence of such a function, often called a functional square root or half-iterate of the exponential function, was first studied by Hellmuth Kneser. He demonstrated that continuous, real-analytic, increasing solutions do exist.\n*   Constructing an explicit solution is non-trivial, but we can demonstrate that if one such solution exists, there must be uncountably many. The general method involves defining the function on a specific interval and then extending it to all real numbers using the property $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$, which can be derived from the original equation: $f(\\exp(x)) = f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$.\n*   Let's assume one such increasing solution, $f_0(x)$, exists. We can generate a family of new solutions by conjugating $f_0$ with a function $\\phi$ that commutes with $\\exp(x)$. That is, a continuous, invertible function $\\phi$ satisfying $\\phi(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(\\phi(x))$.\n*   If we define $f(x) = \\phi^{-1}(f_0(\\phi(x)))$, then $f(f(x)) = \\phi^{-1}(f_0(f_0(\\phi(x)))) = \\phi^{-1}(\\exp(\\phi(x)))$. Since $\\phi$ commutes with $\\exp$, its inverse also does, meaning $\\phi^{-1}(\\exp(y)) = \\exp(\\phi^{-1}(y))$. Thus, $f(f(x)) = \\exp(\\phi^{-1}(\\phi(x))) = \\exp(x)$.\n*   The number of such functions $\\phi$ is uncountably infinite. One can construct such a $\\phi$ by defining it as an arbitrary continuous increasing function on an interval of the form $[a, e^a]$ and then extending it. This freedom of choice leads to a vast number of solutions. The number of such choices is equivalent to the number of continuous functions on an interval, which has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe set of continuous functions satisfying $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ can be divided into two disjoint sets: strictly increasing solutions and strictly decreasing solutions.\n*   The set of decreasing solutions is empty.\n*   The set of increasing solutions is non-empty and has the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such functions is $0 + \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n<<<The cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.>>>"
