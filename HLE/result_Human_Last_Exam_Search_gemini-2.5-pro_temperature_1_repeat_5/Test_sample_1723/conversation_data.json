    "The previous searches have shown that while several mushroom genera have blue coloring on the fruiting body, their spore prints are not blue.\n\n*   *Lactarius indigo*: yellow-cream spore print.\n*   *Stropharia caerulea*: purple-black spore print.\n*   *Panaeolus cyanescens*: black spore print.\n*   *Cortinarius rotundisporus*: reddish-brown spore print.\n*   *Entoloma hochstetteri*: pink spore print.\n*   *Mycena cyanorrhiza*: white spore print.\n*   *Pleurotus columbinus* (Blue Oyster): The spore print color is not explicitly stated in the search results, but it is implied to be white or light-colored, typical for oyster mushrooms.\n\nThe search for \"mushroom genus with blue spore print\" did not yield a direct answer. The results often refer to blue-staining fungi or fungi with blue bodies, but not blue spores. It is possible that a mushroom genus with a distinctly blue spore print does not exist or is not well-documented in the search results I have obtained. I need to perform a more targeted search to confirm if any mushroom genus is known to produce a blue spore print.The performed searches have consistently shown that while some mushrooms have a blue color, their spore prints are of different colors like yellow, pink, brown, or black. For example, the striking *Entoloma hochstetteri* is all-blue but has a pink spore print. The *Indigo Milk Cap* (*Lactarius indigo*) is another blue mushroom with a yellowish-cream spore print. The *Blue Roundhead* (*Stropharia caerulea*) has a purple-black spore print.\n\nHowever, one search result mentions a new species, *Amaurodon aquicoeruleus*, which is characterized by having spores that are \"distinctly blue in water\". This indicates that the genus *Amaurodon* contains at least one species with blue spores. Another result mentions that most species of the filamentous fungi *Penicillium* produce blue-green spores. While *Penicillium* is a mold and not typically what is thought of as a \"mushroom,\" it is a genus of fungi. The user's question asks for a \"genus of mushroom\". While molds are fungi, the term mushroom usually refers to a macrofungus with a distinct fruiting body. *Amaurodon* fits this description better as it belongs to the Thelephorales, which are mushroom-forming fungi.\n\nTherefore, I have found a genus that seems to match the user's request.\n\nA single genus of mushroom known to produce a distinctly blue spore print is ***Amaurodon***.\n\nWhile many mushrooms may have blue coloration on their caps or stems, the color of their spore print is a distinct characteristic used for identification and is often different from the mushroom's external color. For instance, the well-known blue mushroom *Entoloma hochstetteri* has a pink spore print, and the *Indigo Milk Cap* (*Lactarius indigo*) produces a yellowish-cream spore print. Similarly, the *Blue Roundhead* (*Stropharia caerulea*) has a purple-black spore print.\n\nThe genus *Amaurodon*, however, is distinguished by species that have spores which are blue to green in color. One particular species, *Amaurodon aquicoeruleus*, is noted for its bright blue spores when mounted in water. While the term \"mushroom\" often brings to mind the classic stemmed and gilled fungi, *Amaurodon* species are a type of corticioid or \"crust\" fungi, which are also mushroom-forming fungi.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the genus of molds, *Penicillium*, is known for producing blue-green spores; however, these are not typically classified as mushrooms.\n\n<<<Amaurodon>>>"
