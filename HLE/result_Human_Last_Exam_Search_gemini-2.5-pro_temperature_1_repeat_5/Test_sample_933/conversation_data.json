    "The most widely recognized and efficient method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) is through the direct reaction of xenon (Xe) and fluorine (F₂) gases. This synthesis is typically conducted by heating a mixture of xenon and fluorine, generally in a 1:5 molar ratio, within a sealed nickel vessel to a temperature of 400°C. The use of a nickel container is crucial as it reacts with fluorine to form a protective, non-reactive layer of nickel(II) fluoride on its inner surfaces.\n\nA US patent for this production process specifies an optimal temperature range of 350°C to 450°C, with 400°C being the preferred temperature to ensure a quantitative reaction. While other methods and temperatures exist, they are generally less efficient or lead to different products. For instance, an equilibrium exists between xenon difluoride (XeF₂), XeF₄, and xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆). Lower temperatures tend to favor the formation of XeF₂, while temperatures higher than 400°C favor the production of XeF₆. Although flow methods using a nickel tube heated to 300-500°C can produce XeF₄, they often result in significant contamination with XeF₂. Some reaction products have been observed at temperatures as low as 270°C, but 400°C remains the established temperature for efficient synthesis. Other techniques, such as using an electric glow discharge, can produce a mixture of xenon fluorides at very low temperatures (e.g., -80°C to 0°C), but this method has low productivity and does not yield pure XeF₄.\n\nConsidering the provided options, 400°C is the coldest temperature at which Xenon tetrafluoride can be produced efficiently.\n\n<<<B>>>"
