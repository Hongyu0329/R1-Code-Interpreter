    "Once a single-dose ampule is opened or punctured in a sterile environment, it must be used immediately and cannot be stored for any period. Any unused portion must be discarded. This is a strict guideline from sources such as the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and state regulations.\n\nThe guidance for single-dose *vials* differs, allowing for use up to 12 hours after initial entry if maintained in an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment. However, for ampules, which are glass containers that are broken open and cannot be resealed, the risk of contamination is much higher, leading to the immediate use and discard rule.\n\n<<<Immediately, with any unused portion to be discarded.>>>"
