    "The number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = cos(at) and y(t) = sin(bt) can be determined using a standard formula when a and b are integers.\n\nIn this specific case, the curve is given by (cos(9t), sin(5t)), so we have a = 9 and b = 5.\n\nFor a Lissajous curve where 'a' and 'b' are coprime integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2\n\nFirst, we check if a=9 and b=5 are coprime. The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5 is 1, so they are coprime.\n\nNow, we can apply the formula:\nNumber of self-intersections = (9 - 1)(5 - 1) / 2\n= (8)(4) / 2\n= 32 / 2\n= 16\n\nThe curve has 16 self-intersection points.\n\n<<<16>>>"
