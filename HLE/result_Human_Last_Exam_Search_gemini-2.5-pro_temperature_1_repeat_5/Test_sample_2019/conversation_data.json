    "The initial search has provided a significant amount of information regarding the n-queens problem on a toroidal board. Specifically, it has been established that a solution for placing *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This confirms that for a 5x5 board, a solution of placing 5 queens exists.\n\nHowever, the user's question is about placing 4 non-attacking queens, not 5. This is a variation of the classic problem. The search results primarily discuss the *n*-queens problem, where the number of queens equals the board size. There is no direct answer or formula in the search results for placing *k* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board where *k* < *n*.\n\nTherefore, the next steps should focus on finding information specifically about the 4-queens problem on a 5x5 toroidal board. I need to find out if this specific problem has been studied and if there are known results.The search results have confirmed that for an *n*x*n* toroidal board, a solution for placing *n* non-attacking queens exists if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This means for a 5x5 board, it is possible to place 5 non-attacking queens. The search also provided a reference to a MathOverflow question which states that it has been proven by computer search that 4 queens are not enough to dominate a 5x5 toroidal board, implying no solution exists for placing 4 non-attacking queens. However, this is about \"dominating\" the board, which is a different problem from \"non-attacking\". The query \"placing 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board solutions\" did not yield a direct answer to the number of ways. One result mentions a book by Vaclav Kotesovec, \"Non-attacking chess pieces\", which might contain the answer, but the book itself is not directly accessible. The other results focus on the n-queens problem where the number of queens equals the board size. Therefore, I need to perform a more targeted search to find a reliable source that either explicitly states the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board or provides a method to calculate it.The search for \"Vaclav Kotesovec Non-attacking chess pieces 4 queens 5x5 toroidal\" and related queries provided some valuable context but not a direct answer. I found references to Kotesovec's extensive work on non-attacking chess pieces, including a large online book. However, I was unable to access the specific page or table that might contain the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. The searches also brought up discussions on the n-queens problem on a torus, confirming that for n=5, a solution with 5 queens exists. One MathOverflow answer mentioned that it has been proven by computer evaluation that 4 queens are not enough to \"dominate\" a 5x5 toroidal board, but this is a different problem. The key is to find a reliable source, preferably Kotesovec's work or the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS), that directly addresses the number of placements for 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal board. I have searched for OEIS sequences related to this but haven't found an exact match yet. My next step will be to try and find a direct way to access the relevant information within Kotesovec's online book or find a specific OEIS sequence.The previous searches have not yielded a direct numerical answer to the question. While I've found extensive resources on the n-queens problem, including on toroidal boards, the specific case of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is not explicitly detailed in the general discussions. I've attempted to search within Václav Kotěšovec's website and the OEIS, which are the most likely sources for such specific combinatorial data, without immediate success. The key challenge is that most literature focuses on the *n*-queens problem (where the number of queens equals the board dimension) or the domination problem, neither of which directly answers the user's question.\n\nMy next step needs to be a more direct attempt to find the exact number. Since general searches are proving insufficient, I will try a more targeted approach. I will look for any available tables or databases within the previously identified resources that might list the number of ways to place *k* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board. I will also try to broaden my search for forums or discussion groups where this specific problem might have been solved and the solution posted.The previous searches have provided some crucial information and pointed towards promising resources, but a direct answer remains elusive. I have learned that the problem of placing *n* queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board is well-studied, with solutions existing for n=5. However, the specific case of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board is not covered in the general results.\n\nThe most promising lead is the work of Vaclav Kotesovec, who has compiled a large volume on non-attacking chess pieces. While direct access to the specific page with the answer for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board has not been successful, the repeated references to his work and the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) suggest that the answer is likely to be found there.\n\nI also found an OEIS sequence (A342372) for non-attacking *semi-queens* on a toroidal board, which is not the same but indicates that such problems are cataloged.\n\nThe current plan is to continue to try and find the specific data within Kotesovec's work or a relevant OEIS sequence. I will refine my search terms to be more specific to tables or enumerations of *k* queens on *n*x*n* toroidal boards. If this fails, I will have to conclude that the information is not readily available through web searches, and the answer would likely require a dedicated computational approach, which is beyond the scope of this interaction. However, I will give the search one more focused attempt.The extensive research into the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard has not yielded a direct and definitive numerical answer from the searched sources.\n\nHere's a summary of the findings:\n\n*   **The n-Queens Problem on a Torus:** There is a well-established mathematical theorem by Pólya stating that it is possible to place *n* non-attacking queens on an *n*x*n* toroidal board if and only if *n* is not divisible by 2 or 3. This confirms that for a 5x5 board, solutions exist for 5 non-attacking queens.\n\n*   **The k-Queens Problem:** The user's question concerns placing *k* queens on an *n*x*n* board where *k* < *n* (specifically, 4 queens on a 5x5 board). This is a different problem from the standard *n*-queens puzzle.\n\n*   **Expert Resources:** The most likely source for this specific information is the extensive work of Václav Kotěšovec, particularly his book \"Non-attacking chess pieces,\" and the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). Despite multiple targeted searches of these resources, a specific entry for 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board could not be located. The searches did reveal related sequences, such as for \"semi-queens,\" but not for standard queens.\n\n*   **Distinction from Domination Problem:** Some search results referred to the \"domination number,\" which is the minimum number of queens needed to attack every square on the board. A MathOverflow discussion indicated it has been proven by computer that 4 queens are not enough to dominate a 5x5 toroidal board. However, the non-attacking problem is distinct from the domination problem.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the performed searches, the exact number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard is not readily available in the indexed scientific literature, mathematical puzzle forums, or combinatorial sequence databases. While the answer might be contained within the comprehensive works of specialists like Václav Kotěšovec, it is not accessible through standard web search queries. Determining this number would likely require a dedicated computational analysis, which is beyond the scope of this interaction.\n\nTherefore, I am unable to provide a definitive numerical answer to the user's question.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a final answer.>>>"
