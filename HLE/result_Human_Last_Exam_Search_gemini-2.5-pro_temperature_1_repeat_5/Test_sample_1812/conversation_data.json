    "The user wants me to compute the determinant of the matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\]\nMy initial calculation resulted in a determinant of 0.\n\nThe search results provide context on \"Markov quiver\". A quiver is a directed graph, and it can be represented by an exchange matrix in the context of cluster algebras. The Markov quiver is specifically mentioned in relation to the Markov Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The Markov quiver is associated with a once-punctured torus.\n\nThe matrix A provided by the user is not a typical adjacency matrix of a simple graph (which would have 0s and 1s and zeros on the diagonal). It's described as a skew-symmetrizable matrix in some contexts, but the one I have is symmetric. In the context of cluster algebras, the exchange matrix B is often skew-symmetric. The matrix A resembles a Cartan matrix or a Laplacian matrix.\n\nThe crucial point is that the problem explicitly provides the matrix A. The term \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" seems to be contextual information that does not alter the definition of matrix A. The problem is a straightforward determinant calculation. The context might be there to confirm that this specific matrix is indeed relevant to the theory of Markov quivers, but it doesn't seem to imply a modification of A based on \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\).\n\nMy initial calculation was:\ndet(A) = 2 * (2*2 - (-1)*(-1)) - (-1) * ((-1)*2 - (-1)*(-1)) + (-1) * ((-1)*(-1) - 2*(-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) - (-1) * (-2 - 1) + (-1) * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 + 1 * (-3) - 1 * 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe calculation is correct. The determinant is 0. I don't need further search or computation. The additional information in the prompt appears to be a distraction from the main task.\n\nFinal Answer will be 0.\nThe determinant of the matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis calculated as follows:\n\ndet(A) = 2 * (2 * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) - (-1) * ((-1) * 2 - (-1) * (-1)) + (-1) * ((-1) * (-1) - 2 * (-1))\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe determinant is 0. The additional information about the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) does not change the matrix A which was explicitly given. This matrix is related to the degenerate case of the Markov equation, which is consistent with a determinant of 0.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe calculation of the determinant is as follows:\n```\ndet(A) = 2 * ( (2 * 2) - (-1 * -1) ) - (-1) * ( (-1 * 2) - (-1 * -1) ) + (-1) * ( (-1 * -1) - (2 * -1) )\ndet(A) = 2 * (4 - 1) + 1 * (-2 - 1) - 1 * (1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2 * 3 - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n```\nThe result is 0.\n\nFinal check on the calculation:\n2 * (4-1) = 6\n-(-1) * (-2-1) = 1 * (-3) = -3\n-1 * (1 - (-2)) = -1 * 3 = -3\nSum = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0.\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe context provided (\"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\") appears to be extraneous information, as the matrix A is explicitly defined. The task is to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\nFinal answer is 0.\nThe determinant of the given adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver is 0.\n\nThe matrix provided is:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix is calculated using the formula:\ndet(A) = a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)\n\nSubstituting the values from the matrix A:\ndet(A) = 2((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) - (-1)((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) + (-1)((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1))\ndet(A) = 2(4 - 1) + 1(-2 - 1) - 1(1 + 2)\ndet(A) = 2(3) - 3 - 3\ndet(A) = 6 - 6\ndet(A) = 0\n\nThe additional information regarding \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) appears to be contextual and does not alter the composition of the matrix A for this specific problem.\n\n<<<0>>>"
