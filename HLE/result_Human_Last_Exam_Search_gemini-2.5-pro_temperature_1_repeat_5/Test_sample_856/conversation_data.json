    "Zero.\n\nA closed orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is known as a spherical 3-manifold. For such a manifold, its universal cover is the 3-sphere, $S^3$, and the manifold can be represented as the quotient space $S^3/\\Gamma$, where $\\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(4) that acts freely on $S^3$.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group of such a manifold must be isomorphic to a finite subgroup of SO(4). The question then becomes whether a group of cardinality 10! can be a subgroup of SO(4).\n\nThe order of the group in question is $10! = 3,628,800$.\n\nThe classification of finite subgroups of SO(4) is well-established. The largest finite subgroup of SO(4) is the rotational symmetry group of the 600-cell, which is the derived subgroup of the Coxeter group $W(H_4)$, and has an order of 7200.\n\nSince $10! = 3,628,800$ is significantly larger than 7200, no group of order 10! can be a subgroup of SO(4). Consequently, no such group can act freely on the 3-sphere to form a closed orientable 3-manifold.\n\nThus, there are no closed orientable 3-manifolds whose fundamental group has a cardinality of 10!.\n\n<<<0>>>"
