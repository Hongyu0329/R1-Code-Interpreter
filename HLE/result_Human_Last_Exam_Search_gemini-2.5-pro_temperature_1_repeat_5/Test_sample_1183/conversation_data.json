    "The symmetry group of the molecule with the SMILES string C#Cc1cc2ccc3c(C#C)cc4ccc5c(C#C)cc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 is **D3h**.\n\nThe provided SMILES string corresponds to the chemical compound **2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaethynyltriphenylene**. This molecule possesses a high degree of symmetry.\n\nThe central core of the molecule is triphenylene, a planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The six ethynyl (-C≡CH) groups are attached to the outer benzene rings in a highly symmetrical pattern. The analysis of the molecule's structure reveals the following symmetry elements:\n\n*   A principal three-fold axis of rotation (C₃) that passes through the center of the molecule, perpendicular to its plane.\n*   Three two-fold axes of rotation (C₂) that lie within the plane of the molecule, each passing through the centers of opposing benzene rings.\n*   A horizontal mirror plane (σh) which is the same as the plane of the molecule.\n*   Three vertical mirror planes (σv) that each contain the principal C₃ axis and one of the C₂ axes.\n*   A three-fold improper rotation axis (S₃) coincident with the C₃ axis.\n\nThe combination of a C₃ axis with three perpendicular C₂ axes places the molecule in the D₃ point group family. The presence of the horizontal mirror plane (σh) further classifies it into the **D3h** point group. Molecules belonging to the D3h point group have 12 symmetry operations in total.\n\n<<<D3h>>>"
