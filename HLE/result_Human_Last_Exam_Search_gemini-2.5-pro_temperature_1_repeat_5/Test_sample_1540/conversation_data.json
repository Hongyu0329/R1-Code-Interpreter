    "To solve the problem of case-insensitive lexicographical string comparison with maximum memory efficiency, it is best to avoid storing both strings in memory simultaneously. The optimal approach involves reading the first string into a buffer and then processing the second string character by character from the input stream, performing the comparison on the fly. This method significantly reduces memory usage by eliminating the need for a second buffer.\n\n### The Most Memory-Efficient C Program\n\nHere is the C code designed to solve the problem while minimizing memory consumption for its variables:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is optimized for memory efficiency by only storing one string\n * and reading the second one character by character.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer to store the first string. The maximum length is 100,\n    // so we need 101 bytes for the characters plus the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // An index for the first string. 'unsigned char' is used as it's the\n    // smallest integer type (1 byte) and the string length (0-100) fits.\n    unsigned char i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to hold characters of the second string. It must be an 'int'\n    // to correctly handle the End-Of-File (EOF) marker from getchar().\n    int c;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // `scanf` with \"%s\" leaves a newline character in the input buffer.\n    // This `getchar()` call consumes that newline, preventing the subsequent\n    // loop from terminating prematurely.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Read the second string character by character until a newline or EOF\n    // is encountered.\n    while ((c = getchar()) != '\\n' && c != EOF) {\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0;\n        }\n        // Move to the next character.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes without finding any differences, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Calculation of Memory Usage (m)\n\nThe total memory used for variables in this program (`m`) is the sum of the sizes of all local variables declared within the `main` function. On typical competitive programming platforms (which are usually 64-bit systems), the sizes of the data types are standard.\n\n*   **`char s1[101]`**: An array to hold the first string. The `sizeof(char)` is guaranteed by the C standard to be 1 byte. Therefore, the memory for this array is `101 * 1 = 101` bytes.\n*   **`unsigned char i`**: An index for the array. Since the maximum string length is 100, an `unsigned char` (range 0-255) is sufficient and is the smallest integer type available, using `1` byte.\n*   **`int c`**: A variable to store the character read by `getchar()`. This type must be `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value. On most modern systems, `sizeof(int)` is `4` bytes.\n\nThe total memory `m` is calculated as follows:\n\nm = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c)\nm = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 4 bytes\nm = 106 bytes\n\n<<<106>>>"
