    "The search results confirm my initial reasoning. Several sources define a clique as a subset of vertices where the induced subgraph is complete. This is the key definition. The distinction between maximal and maximum cliques is also discussed, but the question is about all possible induced cliques, not restricted to maximal ones. Result explicitly states that a 4-clique contains many different 3-cliques and 2-cliques, which supports the idea of nesting cliques. The other search results discuss related but different problems, like the number of maximal clique sizes, or the number of distinct induced subgraphs in general (not just cliques). None of the results contradict my simple construction.\n\nMy initial line of reasoning stands firm.\n1. The number of vertices is n = 128.\n2. A clique is a set of vertices that induces a complete subgraph.\n3. The size of a clique, k, must be an integer between 1 and 128, inclusive.\n4. Therefore, there are at most 128 different possible sizes for a clique in a graph with 128 vertices.\n5. To show that 128 is achievable, we need to construct a graph G on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all sizes from k=1 to k=128.\n6. Consider the complete graph G = K_128. This is a graph on 128 vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n7. For any integer k between 1 and 128, we can choose any subset of k vertices from the graph.\n8. The subgraph induced by this subset of k vertices will have all possible edges between them, because all edges are present in the K_128.\n9. Therefore, the induced subgraph is a complete graph of size k, a K_k.\n10. This means the K_128 has induced subgraphs of all possible clique sizes from 1 to 128.\n11. The number of these different sizes is 128.\n12. Since we have shown an upper bound of 128 and a construction that achieves it, the maximum possible number is 128.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and confirmed by the definitions found in the search results.\n\nFinal Answer: The maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n = 128 vertices is 128. This is achieved by the complete graph K_128. For any integer k from 1 to 128, any subset of k vertices from the K_128 induces a k-clique (a complete graph on k vertices). Thus, all 128 possible clique sizes are present as induced subgraphs.\n\nI am ready to provide the final answer.\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can simultaneously appear as induced subgraphs of a single graph on n = 128 vertices is 128.\n\nTo see why, first note that the size of any clique in a graph with 128 vertices must be an integer between 1 and 128. Therefore, the number of different clique sizes cannot exceed 128.\n\nTo show that 128 is achievable, we must construct a graph on 128 vertices that contains induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128. Consider the complete graph on 128 vertices, denoted K_128. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nAn induced subgraph is formed by a subset of vertices and all the edges that exist between them in the original graph. A clique is a set of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent, meaning the induced subgraph on that set of vertices is a complete graph.\n\nLet's verify that K_128 contains induced cliques of every size k, for k from 1 to 128.\nFor any integer k in {1, 2, ..., 128}, we can choose an arbitrary subset of k vertices from the 128 vertices of the graph.\nLet this subset of k vertices be U. The subgraph induced by U consists of the vertices in U and all edges from K_128 that connect two vertices in U. Since in K_128 all vertices are connected to all other vertices, the induced subgraph on U is also a complete graph, specifically a K_k. For example, a 4-clique contains smaller 3-cliques and 2-cliques within it as induced subgraphs.\n\nSince we can do this for any k from 1 to 128, the graph K_128 contains induced subgraphs isomorphic to K_1, K_2, ..., K_128. Therefore, there are 128 different clique sizes present as induced subgraphs in K_128.\n\nAs the number of possible clique sizes is at most 128, and we have found a graph that achieves this number, the maximum possible number is 128.\n\n<<<128>>>"
