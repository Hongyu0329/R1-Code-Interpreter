    "I have been unable to identify the name of the judge of Bártfa (now Bardejov) in 1461 through the available search results.\n\nWhile historical records confirm that Bártfa, as a free royal town, had a town judge (known as a *bíró* in Hungarian or *Richter* in German) and a town council during the 15th century, the specific individual holding this office in 1461 is not mentioned in the accessed documents.\n\nSeveral sources reference archival materials from Bártfa for this period, most notably the collection \"Bártfa szabad királyi város levéltára 1319–1526\" compiled by Béla Iványi. This collection of archival documents is the most likely place to contain the name of the judge. However, a detailed examination of this multi-volume work, which would be necessary to locate the specific information, is not possible with the available tools.\n\nOne source mentions a damaged document from 1461 which unfortunately lacks information about the town's council structure for that year. This suggests that the records for this specific year might be incomplete.\n\nAlthough names of other town officials from the 15th century, such as council member Juraj Stenczel, have been found, the name of the judge for 1461 remains unconfirmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the conducted research, the name of the judge of Bártfa in 1461 cannot be provided at this time.\n\n<<<I am unable to answer this question.>>>"
