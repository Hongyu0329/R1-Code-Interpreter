    "The Grigorchuk group, denoted by G, is a fascinating mathematical object with many unusual properties. To determine the number of its subgroups of index 4, we can analyze its structure, particularly its abelianization.\n\nThe Grigorchuk group is a finitely generated infinite 2-group, which means every element has an order that is a power of two. An important consequence of this is that the index of any finite-index subgroup must also be a power of two.\n\nThe abelianization of a group G is the quotient group G/[G,G], where [G,G] is the derived subgroup (or commutator subgroup). For the Grigorchuk group, the abelianization is known to be isomorphic to the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2, that is, (ℤ/2ℤ)³. This means the derived subgroup [G,G] has an index of 8 in G.\n\nAny subgroup of index 4 in G must contain the derived subgroup [G,G]. This is because if H is a subgroup of index 4, the quotient group G/H has order 4. Since any group of order 4 is abelian, the derived subgroup of G/H is trivial. The derived subgroup of a quotient group (G/H)' is [G,G]H/H. For this to be the trivial subgroup, we must have [G,G]H = H, which implies that [G,G] is a subgroup of H.\n\nTherefore, the subgroups of index 4 in G are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of index 4 in the abelianization G/[G,G] ≅ (ℤ/2ℤ)³. A subgroup of index 4 in (ℤ/2ℤ)³ has order |(ℤ/2ℤ)³| / 4 = 8 / 4 = 2.\n\nThe number of subgroups of order 2 in (ℤ/2ℤ)³ is equal to the number of non-identity elements, since each non-identity element has order 2 and generates a unique subgroup of order 2. The group (ℤ/2ℤ)³ has 2³ - 1 = 7 non-identity elements.\n\nThus, there are 7 subgroups of order 2 in (ℤ/2ℤ)³, which in turn means there are 7 subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group. All of these subgroups are normal because they correspond to subgroups of an abelian quotient group.\n\nAdditionally, it is a known property that all maximal subgroups of the Grigorchuk group have index 2. The number of these maximal subgroups corresponds to the number of subgroups of index 2 in its abelianization, which is 7. The subgroups of index 4 are the intersections of pairs of these distinct maximal subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
