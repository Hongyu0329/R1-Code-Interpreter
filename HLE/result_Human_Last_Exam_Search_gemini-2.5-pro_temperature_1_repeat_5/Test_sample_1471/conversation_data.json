    "To solve the equation, we first need to convert the Roman numerals into modern (Arabic) numbers.\n\n*   **XL**: In Roman numerals, when a smaller value (X = 10) comes before a larger value (L = 50), it is subtracted. So, XL = 50 - 10 = 40.\n*   **XXX**: This represents three tens added together. So, XXX = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30.\n*   **XXIV**: This is a combination of XX (20) and IV (4). So, XXIV = 20 + 4 = 24.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the equation:\n\n40 / 30 - 24\n\nFollowing the order of operations (division before subtraction), we first calculate the division:\n\n40 / 30 = 4/3\n\nNext, we perform the subtraction:\n\n4/3 - 24\n\nTo subtract these, we can find a common denominator:\n\n4/3 - 72/3 = -68/3\n\nAs a decimal, this is approximately -22.67.\n\n<<<-68/3>>>"
