**a) No Interaction:**
The absorption cross-section σ(ω₀) is given by:
`σ_a(ω₀) ∝ N * ω_e * |μ_e|² * exp[-(ω_e - ω₀)²τ²/2]`
where:
- `N` is the number of molecules.
- `ω_e` is the electronic transition frequency of a single molecule.
- `μ_e` is the transition dipole moment of a single molecule.
- `ω₀` is the carrier frequency of the laser pulse.
- `τ` is the duration parameter of the Gaussian pulse.
The spectrum consists of a single Gaussian peak centered at the monomer frequency `ω_e`, with an intensity proportional to `N`.

**b) Near-Neighbor Interaction:**
The absorption cross-section is described by the Frenkel exciton model:
`σ_b(ω₀) ∝ N * (ω_e + 2J/ħ) * |μ_e|² * exp[- (ω_e + 2J/ħ - ω₀)²τ²/2]`
where:
- `J` is the near-neighbor coupling energy.
- `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.
Due to excitonic selection rules, the absorption spectrum is dominated by a single peak corresponding to the k=0 exciton state. This peak is shifted from the monomer frequency by an amount `2J/ħ`. The entire oscillator strength of the chain is concentrated in this single transition.
