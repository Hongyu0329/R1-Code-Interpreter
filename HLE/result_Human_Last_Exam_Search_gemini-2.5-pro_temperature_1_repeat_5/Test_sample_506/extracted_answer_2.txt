**1. Amlodipine**

*   **Rationale:** Amlodipine is a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB). Guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) recommend CCBs as first-line therapy for hypertension in African American patients. The combination of a CCB with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker is highly effective. Given that MM's hypertension is resistant and she cannot take verapamil, amlodipine is a primary and potent agent for her regimen.

**2. Valsartan**

*   **Rationale:** Valsartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). For patients with hypertension and diabetes (as indicated by her A1C of 6.7%), a RAS inhibitor like an ARB or an ACE inhibitor is a recommended first-line agent due to its beneficial effects on kidney disease progression. ARBs are often chosen over ACE inhibitors for their lower risk of side effects like cough, which is more common in African American patients. A combination of an ARB and a CCB is a preferred and highly effective strategy for blood pressure control.

**3. Chlorthalidone**

*   **Rationale:** MM has resistant hypertension, defined as blood pressure above goal despite the use of three medications, which should ideally include a diuretic. While the patient cannot take several specified diuretics, chlorthalidone is not on her exclusion list. It is a potent, long-acting thiazide-like diuretic that is preferred in guidelines over the more commonly used hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) due to stronger evidence of reducing cardiovascular events. Studies have shown it to be more effective at lowering blood pressure than HCTZ. This three-drug combination of an ARB, a CCB, and a thiazide-like diuretic is a standard, guideline-directed approach for managing difficult-to-control hypertension.
