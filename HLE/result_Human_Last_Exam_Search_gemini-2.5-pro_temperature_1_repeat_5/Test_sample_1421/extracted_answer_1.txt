The formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time representation using Feynman’s path integral formalism is Z = ∫ Dψ Dψ̄ exp[-S_E(ψ, ψ̄)], where the integral is over Grassmann-valued fields ψ and ψ̄ with anti-periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction (from 0 to β = 1/T), and S_E is the Euclidean action of the fermionic system.
