    "The provided sequence of numbers is:\n1014, 1020, 1032, 1050, 1104, 1224, 1230, 1290, 1410, 1440, 1452, 1482, 1500, 1512, 1560, 1584, 1602, 1734, 1812, 1890, 1902, 1932, 1974, 2004, 2040, 2064, 2070, 2130, 2142, 2274, 2340, 2352\n\nFirst, we can confirm that all numbers in the sequence are divisible by 6.\n\nTo find the next number, we can analyze the differences between consecutive terms:\n*   1020 - 1014 = 6\n*   1032 - 1020 = 12\n*   1050 - 1032 = 18\n*   1104 - 1050 = 54\n*   1224 - 1104 = 120\n*   1230 - 1224 = 6\n*   1290 - 1230 = 60\n*   1410 - 1290 = 120\n*   1440 - 1410 = 30\n*   1452 - 1440 = 12\n*   1482 - 1452 = 30\n*   1500 - 1482 = 18\n*   1512 - 1500 = 12\n*   1560 - 1512 = 48\n*   1584 - 1560 = 24\n*   1602 - 1584 = 18\n*   1734 - 1602 = 132\n*   1812 - 1734 = 78\n*   1890 - 1812 = 78\n*   1902 - 1890 = 12\n*   1932 - 1902 = 30\n*   1974 - 1932 = 42\n*   2004 - 1974 = 30\n*   2040 - 2004 = 36\n*   2064 - 2040 = 24\n*   2070 - 2064 = 6\n*   2130 - 2070 = 60\n*   2142 - 2130 = 12\n*   2274 - 2142 = 132\n*   2340 - 2274 = 66\n*   2352 - 2340 = 12\n\nThe sequence of differences is: 6, 12, 18, 54, 120, 6, 60, 120, 30, 12, 30, 18, 12, 48, 24, 18, 132, 78, 78, 12, 30, 42, 30, 36, 24, 6, 60, 12, 132, 66, 12.\n\nThis sequence of differences does not follow a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern. A search for this specific sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) does not yield a match.\n\nHowever, we can observe a recurring pattern within the differences where a number is followed by its half:\n*   48 is followed by 24.\n*   132 is followed by 66.\n\nThe last difference is 12. Following this observed pattern, the next difference could be half of 12, which is 6.\n\nAdding this difference to the last number in the sequence:\n2352 + 6 = 2358.\n\nTo check if 2358 fits the basic rule of the sequence, we can verify if it's divisible by 6. A number is divisible by 6 if it's divisible by both 2 and 3.\n*   2358 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.\n*   The sum of its digits is 2 + 3 + 5 + 8 = 18. Since 18 is divisible by 3, 2358 is divisible by 3.\n\nSince 2358 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is divisible by 6.\n\nThus, a plausible next number in the sequence is 2358.\n\n<<<2358>>>"
