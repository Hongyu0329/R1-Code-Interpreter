**Value of Î±:**
The exact value is \(\alpha = \frac{1}{22.5 \arccos(\frac{1.5}{\sqrt{22.5}}) - 6.75}\).
Numerically, this is approximately **0.04683**.

**Value of P(X<3):**
The value is given by the expression \(\alpha \int_{1}^{3} (-1.5 + \sqrt{22.5 - (x-5.5)^2}) dx\).
Numerically, this is approximately **0.147**.
