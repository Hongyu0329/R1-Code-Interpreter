    "After a gene is duplicated in a eukaryotic genome, it has several potential fates. The most common outcome is that one of the two copies accumulates disabling mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene, a process called pseudogenization. This, however, represents a loss of the duplicated gene, not its retention. For both copies to be retained in the genome over evolutionary time, there must be a selective advantage to keeping them.\n\nSeveral mechanisms can lead to the retention and subsequent divergence of these duplicated genes:\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization:** In this scenario, one of the gene copies maintains the original, ancestral function, while the other copy accumulates mutations that give it an entirely new, beneficial function. Because one gene performs the original role and the second performs a new one, natural selection favors the preservation of both copies. This process directly accounts for both the retention and the functional divergence of the duplicates.\n\n*   **Subfunctionalization:** This mechanism occurs when the ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in different tissues or at different times. After duplication, each gene copy can accumulate mutations that degrade a different sub-function. Consequently, both genes are required to carry out the complete set of functions that the single ancestral gene originally performed. This \"division of labor\" makes both copies essential, leading to their retention and divergence in terms of their specific roles or expression patterns. The Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation (DDC) model describes this process, which can happen through neutral mutations, making it a highly plausible pathway for preserving duplicates.\n\n*   **Gene Conversion:** This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer between highly similar sequences, such as recently duplicated genes. Instead of promoting divergence, gene conversion tends to homogenize the two copies, making them more similar. While it is an important process in the evolution of gene families, it works against divergence and does not, by itself, provide a primary reason for retaining both copies.\n\n*   **Adaptive Radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many species that occupy different ecological niches. Gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, but it is not a direct molecular mechanism for retaining a specific pair of duplicated genes.\n\nConsidering the choices, both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are the primary models that explain how duplicated genes are both retained and diverge in function. Pseudogenization (B) is the loss of a gene, gene conversion (A) opposes divergence, and adaptive radiation (E) is a macroevolutionary outcome, not a direct mechanism at the gene level. Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are considered crucial. However, subfunctionalization is often presented as a more likely initial step for retention because it can result from the accumulation of common, neutral degenerative mutations, whereas neofunctionalization requires a rarer beneficial gain-of-function mutation. Nonetheless, both are key and likely mechanisms. In the context of a multiple-choice question where both are options, they represent the core correct answers for this phenomenon.\n\n<<<D>>>"
