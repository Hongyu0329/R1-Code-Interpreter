    "Answering the user's request, the island town that is more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island and sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera sharing the town's name is **Adamstown** on **Pitcairn Island**.\n\nPitcairn Island is a remote volcanic island in the south-central Pacific Ocean, with its nearest inhabited neighbor, Mangareva, being approximately 688 kilometers away. The island itself is the remnant of a volcano, and its only settlement, Adamstown, is located within a volcanic basin, which is a collapsed caldera.\n\nGeological descriptions of Pitcairn Island indicate that the top of the island has a semi-circular pattern characteristic of a collapsed caldera. One source even describes the island as having a \"half moon shape open to the northeast by a volcanic crater of 3 km in diameter\". The main settlement of Adamstown lies within this volcanic crater. The town is situated on the north side of the island, overlooking Bounty Bay. While the bay is named Bounty Bay, the town of Adamstown is intrinsically linked to this bay, which forms the only viable landing site on the island.\n\nIn contrast, other remote islands do not fit the description as precisely. Edinburgh of the Seven Seas on Tristan da Cunha is located on a coastal plain at the base of a volcano, not within a caldera that forms a bay. Hanga Roa, the main town of Easter Island, is situated on a bay of the same name, which means \"wide bay\" or \"long bay\". However, this bay is located in a lowland area between two volcanoes and is not itself described as being a volcanic caldera.\n\n<<<Adamstown>>>"
