The set of all proper stabilizing controllers $H_2(s)$ for the system $H_1(s) = \frac{s}{s^2-1}$ is given by:
$H_2(s) = \frac{(1-s^2)K(s) + s p(s)}{s K(s) - p(s)}$
where:
1. $K(s)$ is any arbitrary polynomial.
2. $p(s)$ is any Hurwitz polynomial (a polynomial whose roots all have negative real parts) that satisfies the following two conditions based on the choice of $K(s)$:
    a. The degree of $p(s)$ is one greater than the degree of $K(s)$: $\deg(p) = \deg(K) + 1$.
    b. The leading coefficient of $p(s)$ is the same as the leading coefficient of $K(s)$.
