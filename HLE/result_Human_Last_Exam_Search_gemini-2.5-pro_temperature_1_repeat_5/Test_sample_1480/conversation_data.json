    "In an interval type-3 fuzzy system, the rule activation level is determined by applying a t-norm operation to the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′)`, and the membership degree of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`. A t-norm, or triangular norm, is a function that generalizes the logical 'AND' operation for fuzzy logic.\n\nThere are several types of t-norms. The most common ones are:\n*   **Minimum t-norm:** `T(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n*   **Product t-norm:** `T(a, b) = a * b`\n*   **Lukasiewicz t-norm:** `T(a, b) = max(0, a + b - 1)`\n\nSince the specific t-norm was not defined in the question, the result will differ based on which t-norm is applied. Typically, if no specific t-norm is mentioned, the minimum t-norm is often assumed due to its simplicity and common usage.\n\nGiven the values:\n*   `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`\n*   `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n\nThe rule activation level using the **minimum t-norm** is calculated as:\n`min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\nUsing the **product t-norm**, the calculation would be:\n`0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`\n\nUsing the **Lukasiewicz t-norm**, the result is:\n`max(0, 0.7 + 0.9 - 1) = max(0, 0.6) = 0.6`\n\nAssuming the most commonly used t-norm (minimum) is intended, the activation level is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
