    "This is a clever riddle! Here's how to solve it:\n\nThe title of the haiku, \"The Bays,\" is a pun. Phonetically, it sounds like \"The B's.\" This suggests that the answer is a list of famous things that start with the letter B.\n\nThe haiku itself provides clues to identify which \"B's\" we are looking for:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This line evokes a sense of power, drama, and storminess, which is a common description for the music of the great classical composers.\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: \"Twice fifteen\" is thirty (30). This points to the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. Around the age of 30, Beethoven confronted his growing deafness and began to compose in a new, revolutionary style that marked a major \"wind of change\" from the Classical to the Romantic era of music.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This suggests the older, established classical style, often seen as divinely perfect (personified by Mozart), yielding to the new, powerful romanticism of Beethoven and his successors.\n\nThese clues, taken together, point to the famous trio of German composers known as the **\"Three B's\"**.\n\nIn alphabetical order, the answer is:\n\n<<<Bach, Beethoven, Brahms>>>"
