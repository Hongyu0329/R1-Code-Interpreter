    "In the provided chess position, the optimal move for White is clear and decisive.\n\nThe position is defined by the FEN string: 8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1. White's key advantage is the powerful passed pawn on d6, which is only two squares from promotion. Black's queen on c5 is the primary piece preventing this pawn from advancing and also poses a threat to White's king.\n\nThe winning move for White is to eliminate Black's queen.\n\n<<<Qxc5+>>>"
