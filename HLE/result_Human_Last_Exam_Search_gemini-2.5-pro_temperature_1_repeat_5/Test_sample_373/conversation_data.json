    "The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during randomized uniform gossiping is 1/25. This result is derived from the structure of the graph and the mechanics of the gossiping process.\n\nA barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, known as the bottleneck or bridge. Let's denote the two 5-node cliques as C1 and C2. Within each clique, every node is connected to every other node.\n\nThe process of randomized uniform gossiping involves two steps:\n1.  A node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the network.\n2.  The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random to communicate with.\n\nTo calculate the probability of the bottleneck edge being used, we must consider the degrees of the nodes connected by this edge. Let the bottleneck edge connect node `u` in C1 and node `v` in C2.\n\n*   **Node Degree:** In the 5-node clique C1, node `u` is connected to the other 4 nodes. It is also connected to node `v` via the bottleneck edge. Therefore, the degree of node `u` is 4 + 1 = 5. Similarly, the degree of node `v` in C2 is also 5.\n\nThe bottleneck edge is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n1.  Node `u` is selected and it chooses to communicate with node `v`.\n2.  Node `v` is selected and it chooses to communicate with node `u`.\n\nThe probabilities for these events are calculated as follows:\n*   The probability of selecting any single node from the 10 nodes is 1/10.\n*   The probability of node `u` being selected is 1/10. Given that `u` is selected, the probability of it choosing `v` from its 5 neighbors is 1/5. Thus, the probability of this event is (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n*   Similarly, the probability of node `v` being selected is 1/10. The probability of it choosing `u` from its 5 neighbors is 1/5. Thus, the probability of this event is also (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50.\n\nThe total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\nTotal Probability = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25.\n\nThis low probability of traversing the bottleneck is a key reason why information spreads slowly in gossiping algorithms on barbell graphs.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
