    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, corresponds to a Galois connection between posets. Let's break down what this means.\n\n### Understanding the problem\n1.  **The Simplex Category $\\Delta$:** The objects of $\\Delta$ are the finite ordered sets $[n] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, n\\}$ for $n \\ge 0$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\n\n2.  **Locally Posetal 2-Category:** When we view $\\Delta$ as a locally posetal 2-category, we introduce \"2-morphisms\". For any two parallel morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a 2-morphism from $f$ to $g$ if and only if $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$. This defines a partial order on each set of morphisms, making it a poset (and thus a category).\n\n3.  **Internal Adjunction:** An adjunction between two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$ in this 2-category consists of a pair of morphisms, $f: [m] \\to [n]$ and $g: [n] \\to [m]$, along with 2-morphisms (which are inequalities in this case) that serve as the unit and counit of the adjunction. These conditions are:\n    *   $id_{[m]} \\le g \\circ f$, which means for every $i \\in [m]$, $i \\le (g \\circ f)(i)$.\n    *   $f \\circ g \\le id_{[n]}$, which means for every $j \\in [n]$, $(f \\circ g)(j) \\le j$.\n\nThis pair of conditions precisely defines a **Galois connection** between the posets $[m]$ and $[n]$. The map $f$ is called the left adjoint and $g$ is the right adjoint.\n\n### Counting the Adjunctions\nThe problem of counting the number of internal adjunctions between $$ and $$ is equivalent to counting the number of such Galois connections. An adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint (or its right adjoint). Therefore, we can find the total number by counting the number of possible left adjoint maps $f: \\to$.\n\nA key theorem in order theory states that an order-preserving map between posets is a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all joins (suprema). The joins in a finite chain like $[k]$ are of two types:\n*   The join of a non-empty set of elements is its maximum. Any order-preserving map automatically preserves maxima.\n*   The join of the empty set is the least element (bottom) of the poset.\n\nFor the poset $[k]$, the bottom element is 0. Thus, for $f: \\to$ to be a left adjoint, it must be an order-preserving map that sends the bottom element of $$ to the bottom element of $$. This means $f$ must satisfy the condition $f(0) = 0$.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to a combinatorial one: counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: \\to$ such that $f(0)=0$.\n\n### The Combinatorial Calculation\nAn order-preserving map $f: \\to$ is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values:\n$f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(23)$.\nThe values $f(i)$ are in $ = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\n\nThe condition $f(0)=0$ fixes the first term of the sequence. We are left with choosing the values for $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(23)$ such that:\n$0 \\le f(1) \\le f(2) \\le \\dots \\le f(23) \\le 37$.\n\nThis is a classic stars-and-bars problem. We need to choose 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $38$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter as they will be arranged into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $r$ items with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{k+r-1}{k} $$\nIn our case:\n*   $k = 23$ (the number of values to choose: $f(1), \\dots, f(23)$).\n*   $r = 38$ (the number of possible values: $0, 1, \\dots, 37$).\n\nPlugging these into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\binom{23 + 38 - 1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThis binomial coefficient represents the total number of possible left-adjoint maps from $$ to $$, and therefore the total number of internal adjunctions.\n\nAlternatively, one could count the number of right adjoints $g: \\to$. A map is a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all meets (infima). This requires preserving the top element, so $g(37)=23$. Counting such maps gives $\\binom{37+24-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37}$, which is equal to $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<\\binom{60}{23}>>>"
