The interaction between the human voltage-gated calcium channel 2.3's alpha-1 and beta-1 subunits is primarily mediated by the alpha-1 subunit's Alpha-Interaction Domain (AID) binding to a hydrophobic pocket within the beta-1 subunit's Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain. While a definitive list of all "hotspot" residues on the human beta-1 subunit is not available in a single reference, key residues identified through structural and mutagenesis studies on homologous channels include a quartet of leucine residues and a critical arginine (such as R307 in CavÎ²3) within the GK domain's binding pocket.

The fine-tuning of the alpha-1 subunit's gating properties is also primarily governed by the GK domain of the beta-1 subunit, with its influence being intrinsically linked to the binding interaction. The structural integrity and interplay between the SH3, HOOK, and GK domains of the beta-1 subunit are crucial for the overall modulation of channel activation and inactivation. The N-terminus of the beta-1 subunit also contributes to this modulation.
