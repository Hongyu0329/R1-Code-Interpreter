    "The smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space X into a Banach space B is 0.\n\nTo determine the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings, we need to consider if it is possible for a given finite ultrametric space X and a given Banach space B to have no isometric embeddings at all. If we can find such a pair (X, B), then the number of embeddings would be 0, which is the smallest possible non-negative integer.\n\nAn isometric embedding of a metric space (X, d) into a normed space (B, ||.||) is a function f: X → B such that for all x₁, x₂ in X, the equality ||f(x₁) - f(x₂)|| = d(x₁, x₂) holds.\n\nLet's construct an example where no such embedding exists:\n\n1.  **Choose the finite ultrametric space X**: Let X be a set of three points, X = {x₁, x₂, x₃}. Let the metric d be defined as d(xᵢ, xⱼ) = 1 if i ≠ j, and d(xᵢ, xᵢ) = 0. This is an ultrametric space because for any three distinct points, the distances between them are 1, 1, and 1. The ultrametric inequality d(x, z) ≤ max{d(x, y), d(y, z)} is satisfied, as 1 ≤ max{1, 1}.\n\n2.  **Choose the Banach space B**: Let B be the set of real numbers ℝ, with the norm being the absolute value function |.|. ℝ is a Banach space, and its cardinality K is the cardinality of the continuum (c).\n\n3.  **Attempt to find an isometric embedding**: We are looking for a function f: X → ℝ, which means we need to find three real numbers a = f(x₁), b = f(x₂), and c = f(x₃) that satisfy the following conditions:\n    *   |a - b| = d(x₁, x₂) = 1\n    *   |b - c| = d(x₂, x₃) = 1\n    *   |a - c| = d(x₁, x₃) = 1\n\n    Let's try to find such numbers. We can fix the position of the first point without loss of generality. Let a = 0.\n    *   From |a - b| = 1, we have |0 - b| = 1, which means b = 1 or b = -1.\n\n    We now have two cases:\n    *   **Case 1: b = 1**. The other two conditions become |1 - c| = 1 and |0 - c| = 1.\n        *   |c| = 1 implies c = 1 or c = -1.\n        *   |1 - c| = 1 implies 1 - c = 1 or 1 - c = -1, which means c = 0 or c = 2.\n        There is no value of c that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\n\n    *   **Case 2: b = -1**. The other two conditions become |-1 - c| = 1 and |0 - c| = 1.\n        *   |c| = 1 implies c = 1 or c = -1.\n        *   |-1 - c| = 1 implies -1 - c = 1 or -1 - c = -1, which means c = -2 or c = 0.\n        Again, there is no value of c that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\n\nSince it is impossible to find three such points in ℝ, there is no isometric embedding of this particular finite ultrametric space X into the Banach space ℝ.\n\nFor this choice of X and B, the number of isometric embeddings is 0. Since the number of embeddings cannot be negative, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\nIt is worth noting that for any given finite ultrametric space X, there always exists *some* Banach space into which it can be isometrically embedded. For instance, the space X described above can be isometrically embedded into ℝ² (as the vertices of an equilateral triangle). However, the question asks for the smallest possible number of embeddings, allowing us to choose both X and B. By choosing them appropriately, we can achieve a total of zero embeddings.\n\n<<<0>>>"
