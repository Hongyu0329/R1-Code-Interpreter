    "The largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that can fit inside a 15 by 15 by 15 cube is 351.\n\nTo determine this maximum number, a methodical packing strategy is used. The volume of the large cube is 15x15x15 = 3375 cubic units, and the volume of a single block is 9x1x1 = 9 cubic units. While dividing the cube's volume by the block's volume suggests a theoretical maximum of 375 blocks (3375 / 9), this doesn't account for the physical constraints of fitting the blocks without overlap.\n\nA proven method for solving this is the greedy algorithm, where the cube is filled by orienting the blocks in one direction at a time in the available space.\n\n1.  **First Orientation (e.g., along the X-axis):** The blocks are aligned with their 9-unit length parallel to one axis of the cube.\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit X-axis: floor(15/9) = 1\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit Y-axis: floor(15/1) = 15\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit Z-axis: floor(15/1) = 15\n    This allows for `1 × 15 × 15 = 225` blocks, occupying a volume of 9x15x15. The remaining space is a block of 6x15x15.\n\n2.  **Second Orientation (e.g., along the Y-axis):** The remaining 6x15x15 space is then filled with blocks aligned along a second axis.\n    *   Number of blocks along the 6-unit X-dimension: floor(6/1) = 6\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit Y-dimension: floor(15/9) = 1\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit Z-dimension: floor(15/1) = 15\n    This adds another `6 × 1 × 15 = 90` blocks. This fills a 6x9x15 volume, leaving a 6x6x15 space.\n\n3.  **Third Orientation (e.g., along the Z-axis):** The final available space of 6x6x15 is filled with blocks oriented along the third axis.\n    *   Number of blocks along the 6-unit X-dimension: floor(6/1) = 6\n    *   Number of blocks along the 6-unit Y-dimension: floor(6/1) = 6\n    *   Number of blocks along the 15-unit Z-dimension: floor(15/9) = 1\n    This yields `6 × 6 × 1 = 36` blocks.\n\nAfter this step, the remaining empty space is a 6x6x6 cube, into which no 9x1x1 block can fit.\n\nThe total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from all three packing stages: `225 + 90 + 36 = 351`. This greedy approach is optimal for this problem, particularly because the block's length (9) is more than half the cube's edge length (15/2 = 7.5).\n\n<<<351>>>"
