For a five-channel flow cytometry sorting experiment using Streptavidin beads with detection channels for AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750, you should prepare a minimum of 8 essential controls, and ideally up to 13 or more, for a comprehensive setup.

Here is a breakdown of the essential controls:

**Core Controls (Minimum of 8):**

1.  **Unstained Cells:** To determine the natural autofluorescence of your cells and to set the baseline for voltage settings.
2.  **Viability Dye Control:** A single-color control for your viability dye to gate out dead cells and for compensation.
3.  **Single-Stain Control for AF350:** For compensation of the AF350 signal into other channels. This can be done with cells or compensation beads.
4.  **Single-Stain Control for GFP:** For compensation of the GFP signal. You can use your GFP-positive cells or GFP-specific compensation beads.
5.  **Single-Stain Control for PE:** For compensation of the PE signal.
6.  **Single-Stain Control for AF647:** For compensation of the AF647 signal.
7.  **Single-Stain Control for AF750:** For compensation of the AF750 signal.
8.  **Unstained Streptavidin Beads:** To check for any intrinsic fluorescence from the beads themselves.

**Highly Recommended Controls for Sorting Accuracy (Up to 5 additional controls):**

9.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Control for AF350:** To accurately set the gate for the AF350 channel by assessing the spread from all other fluorochromes.
10. **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Control for GFP:** To accurately set the gate for the GFP channel.
11. **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Control for PE:** To accurately set the gate for the PE channel.
12. **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Control for AF647:** To accurately set the gate for the AF647 channel.
13. **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Control for AF750:** To accurately set the gate for the AF750 channel.

**Additional Optional Controls:**

*   **Isotype Controls:** One for each primary antibody's isotype to assess non-specific antibody binding.
*   **Biological Controls:** Positive and negative cell populations for your markers of interest to confirm antibody specificity and staining efficacy.

Therefore, the number of essential controls ranges from 8 to 13, with additional controls being beneficial for the most rigorous experimental design.
