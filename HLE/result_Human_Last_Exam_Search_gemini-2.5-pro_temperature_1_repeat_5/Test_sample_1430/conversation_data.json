    "The rank of the Néron-Severi group of an algebraic variety, also known as the Picard number, is a fundamental invariant that measures the complexity of its geometry in terms of divisors. For the 15th symmetric power X of a genus 3 Riemann surface C, its Néron-Severi rank depends crucially on the properties of the Jacobian variety of C.\n\nThe rank of the Néron-Severi group of X = C^(15), denoted ρ(X), is given by the formula:\nρ(X) = ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(C) + ρ(J(C))\n\nHere, d=15 is the symmetric power, C is the genus 3 curve, and J(C) is its Jacobian variety. Since C is a smooth projective curve, its Néron-Severi rank ρ(C) is always 1. The formula is valid for d ≥ g, and in this case, 15 ≥ 3. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the smallest and largest possible values for the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, ρ(J(C)).\n\n### Smallest Possible Rank\n\nThe smallest possible rank occurs for a \"generic\" Riemann surface. A generic genus 3 curve has a Jacobian J(C) whose ring of endomorphisms is as small as possible, namely the integers Z. In this case, the Néron-Severi group of J(C) is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_min(X) = 1 + ρ_min(J(C)) = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n### Largest Possible Rank\n\nThe largest possible rank is achieved when the curve C has special geometric properties, leading to a Jacobian with a large ring of endomorphisms, a condition known as complex multiplication (CM). The theoretical maximum rank for the Néron-Severi group of an abelian threefold like J(C) is g² = 3² = 9. However, the condition that an abelian variety be the Jacobian of a curve imposes strong restrictions.\n\nDetermining the maximal Picard number for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve has been a subject of intensive research. The maximal rank is not 9. Recent results in algebraic geometry have established that the maximum possible rank for the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve is 7.\n\nThis maximum value is achieved for certain special curves. Examples include:\n*   The Fermat quartic curve, defined by the equation x⁴ + y⁴ = z⁴.\n*   The hyperelliptic curve defined by y² = x⁷ - x.\n\nBoth of these curves have Jacobians whose Néron-Severi group has rank 7.\n\nTherefore, the largest possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of X is:\nρ_max(X) = 1 + ρ_max(J(C)) = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 8.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 8.>>>"
