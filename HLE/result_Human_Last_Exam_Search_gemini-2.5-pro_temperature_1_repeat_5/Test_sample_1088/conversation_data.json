    "The number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set depends on the atom being described. The notation specifies how the atomic orbitals are constructed from these primitive functions. Here is a breakdown for heavy atoms (any non-hydrogen atom, like carbon or oxygen) and for hydrogen atoms.\n\nThe notation **6-311G\\*\\*** can be deconstructed as follows:\n\n*   **6-311G**: This part describes the core and valence orbitals.\n    *   **6**: The core orbitals (like the 1s orbital in carbon) are represented by a single basis function that is a combination (contraction) of 6 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   **311**: The valence orbitals are more flexible, using a \"triple-split\" basis. They are described by three separate functions. The first is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, while the second and third are single, uncontracted primitive Gaussians.\n*   **\\*\\***: This indicates the addition of polarization functions to improve the description of chemical bonding.\n    *   The first **\\*** adds a single set of d-type polarization functions to each heavy atom. A set of spherical d-functions consists of 5 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The second **\\*** adds a single set of p-type polarization functions to each hydrogen atom. This set is composed of 3 primitive Gaussians (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\n### Calculation of Primitive Gaussians\n\n**For a heavy atom (e.g., Carbon or Oxygen):**\n\n*   **Core (1s orbital):** 6 primitives\n*   **Valence (2s and 2p orbitals):**\n    *   2s orbital: 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives\n    *   2p orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z): 3 sets of (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 \\* 5 = 15 primitives\n*   **Polarization (d-functions):** 5 primitives\n*   **Total for a heavy atom:** 6 + 5 + 15 + 5 = 31 primitive Gaussians.\n\n**For a hydrogen atom:**\n\n*   **Valence (1s orbital):** 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 primitives\n*   **Polarization (p-functions):** 3 primitives\n*   **Total for a hydrogen atom:** 5 + 3 = 8 primitive Gaussians.\n\nTo illustrate with an example, the total number of primitive Gaussians for a methane molecule (CH₄) would be:\n(1 × 31 for Carbon) + (4 × 8 for Hydrogen) = 31 + 32 = 63 primitives.\n*Correction:* My previous calculation for methane in the thinking process was based on 6 cartesian d-functions (32 primitives for Carbon), leading to a total of 64. The more standard spherical d-functions (5 primitives) results in 31 primitives for Carbon and a total of 63 for methane. A calculation for methanol (CH₃OH) using this method gives (1 x 31 for C) + (1 x 31 for O) + (4 x 8 for H) = 94 primitive Gaussians, which matches cited literature.\n\n<<<A 6-311G** basis set contains 31 primitive Gaussians for each heavy (non-hydrogen) atom and 8 primitive Gaussians for each hydrogen atom.>>>"
