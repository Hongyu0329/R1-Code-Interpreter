    "Of the rivers mentioned in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*, the three longest are the Tigris, the Araxes, and the Po, which is identified with the mythological Eridanus. These rivers are part of the rich geographical tapestry that Virgil weaves, grounding his epic in both the real and mythological worlds.\n\nThe longest of these is the **Tigris River**, with a length of approximately 1,750 to 1,900 kilometers (about 1,090 to 1,180 miles). The *Aeneid* mentions the Tigris in the context of a ship's name in Aeneas' fleet, reflecting the river's fame throughout the ancient world.\n\nThe second longest is the **Araxes River**, which flows for 1,072 kilometers (about 666 miles). In the *Aeneid*, Virgil refers to the Araxes in Book VIII as a river \"angry at the bridge\" (*pontem indignatus Araxes*), a phrase that alludes to the Roman efforts to conquer and bridge this formidable river in Armenia, symbolizing the extent of Roman power.\n\nThe third longest river is the **Po River**, which has a length of 652 kilometers (405 miles). In the *Aeneid*, the Po is identified with the mythological river **Eridanus**. Virgil describes the Eridanus as a great river flowing through the blessed groves of Elysium in the underworld. This connection elevates the status of the Po, the longest river in Italy, by associating it with a divine, otherworldly stream.\n\nOther notable rivers mentioned in the *Aeneid* are significantly shorter. The **Tiber River** (*Tiberis* or *Thybris*), central to the epic's Italian narrative, is 406 kilometers long. Several smaller rivers in Italy and Sicily are also mentioned, including the **Gela** (approximately 59 to 74 km), the **Crimisus** (about 23 km), the **Timavus** (2 km), and the **Numicus**, a small stream near Lavinium. The mythological rivers of the underworld, such as the Styx, Acheron, Lethe, Phlegethon, and Cocytus, are also featured prominently, though their lengths are not quantifiable in the same way as their real-world counterparts.\n\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Tigris, the Araxes, and the Po (Eridanus).>>>"
