    "In a standard planar surface code architecture, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded in a single patch is determined by the number of holes, or defects, introduced into the patch. For a planar patch with *h* holes of the same type, it can encode *h* logical qubits. One diagram explicitly shows a surface code with two closed holes that encodes two logical qubits. Another source confirms this relationship, stating that a planar lattice with *b* closed holes encodes *k=b* qubits.\n\nThe use of multiple patches allows for the storage of separate logical qubits which can then be made to interact, for example, through a process called lattice surgery to perform multi-qubit gates. Having two distinct patches means the total number of logical qubits is the sum of those encoded in each individual patch.\n\nGiven the query for two patches of surface code, each with two holes, the calculation is as follows:\n*   A single patch with two holes encodes 2 logical qubits.\n*   With two such patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits in each, which is 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, two patches of surface code, each with two holes, can encode a maximum of 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
