    "A hypothetical perfluoronanocar would be a molecule in which all hydrogen atoms of a nanocar have been replaced by fluorine atoms. The term \"nanocar\" can refer to several different molecular structures developed since the first one was synthesized in 2005 at Rice University.\n\nOne of the most well-documented nanocar structures has the chemical formula C430H274O12. This particular version has 274 hydrogen atoms. Therefore, a perfluorinated version of this specific nanocar would contain 274 fluorine atoms.\n\nIt is important to note that other nanocar designs exist with different chemical formulas. For example, a flexible nanocar structure with the formula C310H34 has also been described in scientific literature. A perfluorinated version of this molecule would contain 34 fluorine atoms.\n\nBased on the most frequently cited chemical formula, the number would be 274.\n\n<<<274>>>"
