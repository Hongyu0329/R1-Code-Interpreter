    "Based on an analysis of Terraria's game mechanics for Expert Mode, the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu with an infinite number of players would also be infinite. Here is a breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n### Base Health and Scaling Mechanism\n\nIn Expert Mode, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 3,640 when one player is present. When more players are in the game, the boss's health scales upwards. This scaling is not a simple linear increase but follows a multi-tiered formula based on the number of players.\n\n### Health Scaling Formula\n\nAccording to detailed analysis by the Terraria community, the health scaling follows a specific set of rules:\n\n*   **For 2 to 9 players:** The health multiplier increases with each player. The increase for each additional player is calculated based on the increase from the previous player. For two players, the health is 135% of the base, or 4,913 HP. The formula for the *additional* health multiplier `d_n` for the `n`-th player (where `n` is between 3 and 9) is `d_n = d_{n-1} + (1 - d_{n-1}) / 3`. As more players are added in this range, this additional multiplier gets progressively closer to 1.\n\n*   **For 10 or more players:** To prevent the health from escalating too dramatically, a modified formula is used. The game first calculates what the health multiplier would have been using the original formula (let's call it the unmodified multiplier, `M_u(n)`). It then applies a new formula to get the final, modified multiplier `M(n)`:\n    `M(n) = (M_u(n) * 2 + 8) / 3`\n\n### Analysis with an Infinite Number of Players\n\nThe crucial point is how these formulas behave as the number of players (`n`) approaches infinity.\n\n1.  The formula for the additional health increase per player (`d_n`) approaches a limit of 1. This means for a very large number of players, each new player would add roughly the same amount of health as the base health of the boss.\n2.  Because the increase per player stabilizes around a constant value, the unmodified multiplier `M_u(n)` grows without bound, approximately linearly with the number of players.\n3.  The final multiplier for 10+ players, `M(n)`, is a linear function of the `M_u(n)`.\n\nSince `M_u(n)` grows infinitely as `n` approaches infinity, the final multiplier `M(n)` also grows infinitely. Consequently, the Eye of Cthulhu's total health, which is its base health multiplied by `M(n)`, also approaches infinity. While the game has a practical player limit of 255, the underlying formula does not include a health cap.\n\nTherefore, given a hypothetical infinite number of players, the Eye of Cthulhu's health would also be infinite.\n\n<<<Infinite>>>"
