    "Unfortunately, after a thorough search, a publicly available video of the complete Act II Odette variation from the 2014 Bolshoi Theatre production of \"Swan Lake\" starring Svetlana Zakharova is not available for direct viewing. This prevents a definitive count of the *sissone fermes* performed.\n\nHowever, a recorded performance of this production from 2015 is available and is highly likely to feature the same choreography. This performance, officially titled \"Swan Lake | Svetlana Zakharova & Denis Rodkin | Bolshoi Ballet 2015,\" was broadcast in cinemas and is available for purchase or rent on platforms such as Amazon Video and Marquee TV.\n\nTo determine the exact number of *sissone fermes*, you can watch this 2015 recording and count them during the Odette variation in the second act. A *sissone ferme* is a ballet step where the dancer jumps from two feet and lands on two feet, with one foot closing behind or in front of the other. In the context of the Odette variation, this step is often performed with a soft, fluid quality, embodying the swan-like movements of the character.\n\nReviews of Zakharova's performance in this production describe her technique as immaculate and her portrayal of Odette as exquisite and refined. The choreography by Yuri Grigorovich is noted for its own distinct style, which may vary from other versions of \"Swan Lake.\"\n\nTherefore, to answer your specific question, direct observation of the 2015 recorded performance is the most reliable method.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a definitive numerical answer as I cannot directly view the performance to count the choreographic steps.>>>"
