    "The Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension of the class of first-order logic formulas $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ over a schema $S$ with 4 unary predicates is 4.\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for this result:\n\n### 1. Understanding the Formula Class\nThe schema $S$ contains four unary predicates, which we can denote as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$. The logical language $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$ allows for formulas constructed using only existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and the logical constants for true ($\\top$) and false ($\\bot$).\n\nIn the context of VC dimension, we are interested in formulas with one free variable, say $x$, which define concepts or subsets of a given domain. A formula $\\phi(x)$ in this class can be logically rearranged into two main parts:\n*   A part that involves the free variable $x$, which we can call $\\psi(x)$.\n*   A part that does not involve $x$, which is a sentence (a formula with no free variables), let's call it $\\theta$.\n\nThus, any formula $\\phi(x)$ can be seen as equivalent to $\\psi(x) \\land \\theta$.\n\nSince the language only uses conjunction and the predicates are unary, $\\psi(x)$ must be a conjunction of some subset of the atomic formulas involving $x$, namely $\\{P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)\\}$. For example, $\\psi(x)$ could be $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. The sentence $\\theta$ is a formula like $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2 (P_2(y_1) \\land P_4(y_2))$.\n\n### 2. Defining the Hypothesis Space\nFor a given logical structure (or database instance) $\\mathcal{A}$, the formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a set of elements from the domain of $\\mathcal{A}$. The sentence part, $\\theta$, is either true or false in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\neg\\theta$ (i.e., $\\theta$ is false in $\\mathcal{A}$), then $\\phi(x)$ is false for all $x$, and the defined set is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $\\mathcal{A} \\models \\theta$, the defined set is determined by $\\psi(x)$. The set will be the intersection of the extensions of the predicates in $\\psi(x)$. For example, if $\\psi(x) = P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$, the defined set is the intersection of the set of elements satisfying $P_1$ and the set of elements satisfying $P_3$.\n\nThe VC dimension is the size of the largest set of points that can be **shattered**. A set $C$ is shattered if for every one of its subsets, there is a formula in our class that defines exactly that subset.\n\n### 3. Establishing the Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$)\nTo show that the VC dimension is at least 4, we must demonstrate that there exists a structure $\\mathcal{A}$ in which a set of 4 elements can be shattered.\n\nLet the domain of our structure be the set $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. We define the extensions of the four predicates on this domain as follows:\n*   $P_1(x)$ is true for all $x \\in X$ except $a_1$.\n*   $P_2(x)$ is true for all $x \\in X$ except $a_2$.\n*   $P_3(x)$ is true for all $x \\in X$ except $a_3$.\n*   $P_4(x)$ is true for all $x \\in X$ except $a_4$.\n\nNow, for any arbitrary subset $Y \\subseteq X$, we can construct a formula that defines it. Let $I_Y = \\{i \\mid a_i \\notin Y\\}$. The formula $\\phi_Y(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_Y} P_i(x)$ will define exactly the set $Y$. For instance, to define the set $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$, we choose the formula $P_2(x) \\land P_4(x)$. An element $a_j$ satisfies this formula if and only if $P_2(a_j)$ is true (i.e., $j \\neq 2$) and $P_4(a_j)$ is true (i.e., $j \\neq 4$). The elements satisfying this are indeed $\\{a_1, a_3\\}$.\n\nSince we can define every subset of the 4-element set $X$, we have successfully shattered it. Therefore, the VC dimension must be at least 4.\n\n### 4. Establishing the Upper Bound (VC-dim $< 5$)\nTo show that the VC dimension is less than 5, we need to prove that no set of 5 elements can be shattered.\n\nConsider any structure $\\mathcal{A}$ and its interpretations of the four predicates as sets $S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4$. The formulas in our class can define sets that are intersections of these four base sets (e.g., $S_1 \\cap S_2$). The number of possible subsets of the four predicates is $2^4 = 16$. This means that using only conjunctions of the $P_i(x)$, we can define at most 16 distinct sets.\n\nThe existential part $\\theta$ of a formula acts as a switch: if it is false in the structure, the defined set is $\\emptyset$; otherwise, it is the set defined by the conjunction part. This means that for any fixed structure, the total number of definable sets is at most 17 (the 16 possible intersections plus the empty set, in case it wasn't already definable by an intersection).\n\nTo shatter a set of 5 elements, a hypothesis class must be able to realize all $2^5 = 32$ possible labelings of those elements. Since our formula class can define at most 17 distinct subsets in any given structure, it is impossible to generate all 32 required subsets. Therefore, no set of size 5 can be shattered.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining the lower bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$) and the upper bound (VC-dim $< 5$), we conclude that the VC dimension of the given class of formulas is exactly 4. This aligns with the known result that the VC dimension of a concept class formed by intersections of $k$ base sets is $k$.\n\n<<<4>>>"
