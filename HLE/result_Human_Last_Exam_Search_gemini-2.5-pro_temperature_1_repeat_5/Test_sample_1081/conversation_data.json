    "The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, up to $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy, is given by the number of $\\sigma$-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group $W$, where $\\sigma$ is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n\nFor a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that any algebraic group of type $E_8$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is of split type. For a split group, the Frobenius endomorphism acts trivially on the Weyl group. Consequently, the $\\sigma$-conjugacy classes are simply the ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\nTherefore, the problem is reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$. This is a well-known result in the theory of reflection groups. The number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is 112.\n\nThe classification of these conjugacy classes was completed by R. Carter in 1972. The group $W(E_8)$ has order 696,729,600. The 112 conjugacy classes include the identity class. Of these, 30 are elliptic.\n\nThus, the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, up to conjugacy by the rational points of the group, is the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group.\n\n<<<112>>>"
