    "The two Nobel laureates featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why,\" were physicist Murray Gell-Mann and economist Myron Scholes.\n\nA Reddit thread and a video of Murray Gell-Mann confirm his participation in an Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial. In the commercial, another individual appeared alongside Gell-Mann, who has been identified as Myron Scholes. Scholes was a co-recipient of the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on the Black-Scholes formula for options pricing, a tool that was ironically central to some of Enron's complex and ultimately fraudulent financial structures.\n\n<<<Murray Gell-Mann and Myron Scholes>>>"
