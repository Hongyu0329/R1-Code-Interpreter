    "The reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide with sec-butyllithium (sec-BuLi) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), followed by the addition of methyl iodide, results in the formation of **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nThis transformation is a classic example of a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reaction mechanism:\n\n1.  **Directed ortho-Metalation (Lithiation):**\n    *   The starting material, N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide, possesses two powerful directed metalation groups (DMGs): the N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂) and the dimethylamino group (-NMe₂).\n    *   DMGs are functional groups that can coordinate to the lithium atom of an organolithium reagent, such as sec-BuLi, and direct the deprotonation to a nearby (ortho) position on the aromatic ring. The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is generally a stronger directing group than the dimethylamino group.\n    *   The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is at position 1 of the benzene ring, and the dimethylamino group is at position 3.\n    *   The carboxamide group directs deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The dimethylamino group directs deprotonation to its ortho positions (C2 and C4).\n    *   Both groups cooperatively direct the deprotonation to the C2 position, which is the most activated and acidic site on the ring due to the synergistic electronic effects and the chelation of the lithium by both heteroatom-containing groups.\n    *   sec-Butyllithium, a strong base, in the presence of the chelating agent TMEDA, selectively removes the proton from the C2 position, forming a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n\n2.  **Electrophilic Quench:**\n    *   The resulting aryllithium compound is a potent nucleophile.\n    *   In the second step, this nucleophile reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I), which serves as an electrophile.\n    *   The carbanion at the C2 position attacks the methyl group of methyl iodide in a nucleophilic substitution reaction, displacing the iodide ion.\n\nThis sequence of reactions leads to the regioselective substitution of a hydrogen atom with a methyl group at the position ortho to both existing substituents, yielding the final product, N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
