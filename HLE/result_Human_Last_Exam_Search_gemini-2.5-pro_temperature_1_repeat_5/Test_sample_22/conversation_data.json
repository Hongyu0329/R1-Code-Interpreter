    "True.\n\nSNP heritability (h²_snp) represents the total proportion of phenotypic variance that can be explained by the additive effects of all the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) considered, typically those on a genotyping array. It is considered the theoretical maximum predictive power that can be achieved using a linear model of these SNPs.\n\nA polygenic score (PGS) is a tool built to predict a phenotype using a weighted sum of risk alleles from a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The predictive ability of this score is measured by the variance it explains (R²).\n\nIn theory, if the effect sizes of all SNPs were estimated from a GWAS with no error and the genetic architecture was perfectly captured, the variance explained by the resulting polygenic score could equal the SNP heritability. However, this represents an idealized and practically unattainable scenario.\n\nIn reality, the predictive power of a polygenic score is always lower than the SNP heritability due to several factors:\n*   **Estimation error:** The effect sizes used to create the score are estimated from a finite GWAS sample and are therefore subject to statistical noise and error.\n*   **Incomplete linkage disequilibrium (LD):** The GWAS sample used to build the score and the target sample in which the score is tested may have different LD patterns.\n*   **Uncaptured variants:** Not all causal variants are included or tagged perfectly by the SNPs used to calculate the score.\n\nBecause of these limitations, a polygenic score only captures a fraction of the total SNP heritability. For instance, the SNP heritability of ADHD is estimated at 21.6%, while current polygenic scores explain a maximum of 5.5% of the variance. Therefore, the predictive ability of a polygenic score is, in practice, necessarily lower than the SNP heritability for the phenotype.\n\n<<<True>>>"
