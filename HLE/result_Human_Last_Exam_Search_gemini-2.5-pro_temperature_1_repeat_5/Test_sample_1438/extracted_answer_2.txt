The "value" of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral is not a number but is defined by the Berezin integration rules: \( \int d\eta = 0 \) and \( \int d\eta \, \eta = 1 \). These rules are consistent with the anticommuting algebra of Grassmann variables (\( \eta_i \eta_j = - \eta_j \eta_i \)), and specifically the property \( \eta^2 = 0 \), which is the mathematical representation of the Pauli exclusion principle in this formalism.
