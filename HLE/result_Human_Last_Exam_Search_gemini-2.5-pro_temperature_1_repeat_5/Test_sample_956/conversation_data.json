    "The group $G$ is generated by three permutations, $a$, $b$, and $c$, on a set of 12 elements. Through computational group theory software, one can identify this group as the Mathieu group $M_{12}$. The Mathieu group $M_{12}$ is one of the 26 sporadic simple groups and has an order of 95,040.\n\nThe Schur multiplier of a group $G$, denoted $M(G)$, is the second homology group $H_2(G, \\mathbb{Z})$. For the Mathieu group $M_{12}$, the Schur multiplier is a cyclic group of order 2, denoted as $C_2$. Therefore, the abelian group $A$ in the question is isomorphic to $C_2$.\n\nWe are asked to count the number of proper subgroups of $A \\cong C_2$, up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup of a group is any subgroup other than the group itself. The subgroups of a cyclic group $C_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the divisors of the order $n$.\n\nFor the group $A \\cong C_2$, the order is 2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.\n*   The divisor 1 corresponds to the trivial subgroup, which has order 1.\n*   The divisor 2 corresponds to the group $C_2$ itself.\n\nThe proper subgroups of $C_2$ are those that are not equal to $C_2$. In this case, the only proper subgroup is the trivial subgroup of order 1. Up to isomorphism, there is only one group of order 1.\n\nTherefore, there is only one proper subgroup of $A$ up to isomorphism.\n\n<<<1>>>"
