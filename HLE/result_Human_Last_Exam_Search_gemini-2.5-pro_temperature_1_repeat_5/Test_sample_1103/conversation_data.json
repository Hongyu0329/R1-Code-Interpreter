    "The number of negative fundamental discriminants with class number 48 is 240. This result is a part of the complete classification of imaginary quadratic fields with class numbers up to 100, a significant achievement in the context of the Gauss class number problem.\n\nThe problem of determining all imaginary quadratic fields with a given class number has a long history, starting with the conjectures of Gauss. For any given class number, there are only a finite number of such fields. The complete classification for small class numbers was accomplished over many years by various mathematicians.\n\nThe definitive work that answers the question for class number 48 is the 2004 paper by Mark Watkins, titled \"Class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields,\" published in *Mathematics of Computation*. In this paper, Watkins completed the classification for all class numbers up to 100. The paper includes tables that list, for each class number *N* from 1 to 100, the number of negative fundamental discriminants with that class number.\n\nAccording to these tables, there are 240 negative fundamental discriminants for which the class number is 48.\n\n<<<240>>>"
