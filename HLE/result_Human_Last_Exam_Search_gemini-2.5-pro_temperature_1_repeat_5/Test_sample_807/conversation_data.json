    "The Crayola crayon color that contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is Shocking Pink.\n\nThe chemical compound 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride is more commonly known as Rhodamine B. Rhodamine B is a synthetic dye that appears as a green to reddish-violet powder but produces a vibrant, fluorescent pink or magenta color when used as a colorant. It is utilized in a variety of applications, including as a tracer dye, a biological stain, and a pigment in textiles, inks, and plastics.\n\nCrayola crayons are primarily composed of paraffin wax and color pigments. While the precise chemical composition of each crayon color is proprietary information that Crayola does not publicly disclose, evidence suggests the use of Rhodamine B in their products.\n\nThe color \"Shocking Pink\" was first introduced by Crayola in 1972 as part of its fluorescent crayon line. The name itself is famously associated with the fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who launched a perfume called *Shocking* in 1937 with packaging that featured this intense pink hue. Given that Rhodamine B produces a bright, fluorescent pink, it is the pigment responsible for the distinct color of the Shocking Pink crayon.\n\n<<<Shocking Pink>>>"
