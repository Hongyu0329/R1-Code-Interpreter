    "If two people succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of non-attacking bishops on the edge squares of a chessboard, 14 edge squares would remain without bishops.\n\nA standard 8x8 chessboard has 28 edge squares. The problem of placing the maximum number of non-attacking bishops can be broken down by the color of the squares, as bishops on white squares do not attack those on black squares. There are 14 light-colored and 14 dark-colored squares on the edge of the board.\n\nIt is a known puzzle in chess that the maximum number of non-attacking bishops that can be placed on an 8x8 board is 14. This is achieved by placing bishops along the edge squares. Specifically, one can place 7 bishops on the dark-colored edge squares and 7 on the light-colored edge squares.\n\nA possible arrangement for the 7 bishops on the dark squares is to place them on all the dark squares of the first rank (a1, c1, e1, g1) and the remaining non-attacked dark squares on the eighth rank (b8, d8, f8). A symmetrical arrangement works for the 7 bishops on the light-colored squares.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the edge squares is 14. Since there are 28 edge squares in total, the number of squares that would lack bishops is the difference:\n\n28 total edge squares - 14 bishops = 14 empty edge squares.\n\n<<<14>>>"
