To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we must first establish the rank of the Danish flag. When viewed as a matrix of colors, the rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. The Danish flag, with its white cross on a red field, generates two distinct types of rows, which are linearly independent. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.

The task is to find African flags whose designs also result in a maximal rank of 2. This typically occurs in flags with simple geometric structures, such as bicolors, or flags where more complex elements are arranged in a way that limits the number of linearly independent rows to two.

The following flags of African nations have a linear algebraic rank of 2:

*   **Algeria:** The flag is a vertical bicolor of green and white, with a red star and crescent in the center. The emblem's placement creates two unique, linearly independent row types.
*   **Angola:** This flag is a horizontal bicolor of red and black with a central emblem. The arrangement of the emblem on the striped background results in a set of row types that are spanned by two linearly independent vectors.
*   **Benin:** The flag features a green vertical band and two horizontal bands of yellow and red. This design creates two different and linearly independent row patterns.
*   **Burkina Faso:** A horizontal bicolor of red and green with a central yellow star. The star on the striped background creates row patterns that are spanned by a basis of two vectors.
*   **Cameroon:** This is a vertical tricolor of green, red, and yellow, with a yellow star in the central red stripe. The presence of the star on the middle stripe generates two distinct and linearly independent row types.
*   **Guinea-Bissau:** The flag has a vertical red band with a black star, alongside two horizontal bands of yellow and green. This structure produces row patterns that are spanned by two linearly independent vectors.
*   **Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band and two horizontal bands of red and green. This configuration results in two linearly independent row types.
*   **Mauritania:** The flag has a green field with a gold crescent and star, with a red stripe at the top and bottom. This creates two distinct row types: the red stripes and the central green stripe with the emblem.
*   **Nigeria:** A simple vertical tricolor of green, white, and green. This design has only two distinct column types (green and white), which are linearly independent.
*   **Senegal:** A vertical tricolor of green, yellow, and red, with a green star on the central yellow stripe. The star creates a second unique row type, resulting in a rank of 2.
*   **Sudan:** This flag is a horizontal tricolor of red, white, and black, with a green triangle at the hoist. The column vectors of this matrix are spanned by two linearly independent vectors.
