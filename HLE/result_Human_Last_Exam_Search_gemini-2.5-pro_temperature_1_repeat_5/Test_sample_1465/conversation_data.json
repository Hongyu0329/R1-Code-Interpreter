    "Determining the oligomeric state of coiled-coil protein sequences requires analyzing the pattern of amino acids, particularly at the core 'a' and 'd' positions of the characteristic heptad repeat, (abcdefg)n. The nature of the amino acids at these positions largely dictates whether the coiled-coil will form a dimer, trimer, tetramer, or a higher-order oligomer. The search results provide access to various online prediction tools and literature that describe the principles of coiled-coil oligomerization. Based on established principles from de novo protein design studies, a detailed analysis of each sequence leads to the following predictions.\n\n*   **Sequence 1: EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    This sequence is best analyzed by identifying the repeating heptad pattern. Assuming the pattern begins with the isoleucine (I) at position 2 in an 'a' position, we get the register `(a)IA(d)QAL(g)K`. This results in isoleucine (I) and alanine (A) at the 'a' positions and leucine (L) or tryptophan (W) at the 'd' positions. However, a more consistent pattern observed in designed coiled-coils places isoleucine at 'a' and leucine at 'd', which strongly favors the formation of a **dimer**.\n\n*   **Sequence 2: EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    This sequence follows a similar pattern to the first, with isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. This I-L pairing in the hydrophobic core is a classic determinant for a **dimer**. The key feature in this sequence is the substitution of an asparagine (N) at one of the 'a' positions. While polar residues like asparagine in the core can sometimes promote higher-order oligomers, a single substitution within a sequence that strongly favors dimerization is unlikely to change the overall oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Sequence 3: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    In this sequence, the hydrophobic core positions ('a' and 'd') are predominantly occupied by isoleucine (I). A core composed of isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions is a well-established motif that drives the formation of a **trimer**. The packing of the bulky, beta-branched isoleucine side chains is most favorable in a trimeric arrangement.\n\n*   **Sequence 4: EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    Analysis of the hydrophobic residues (I, L, W) and their spacing suggests that this sequence forms a coiled-coil with isoleucine (I) at the 'a' positions and leucine (L) at the 'd' positions. As with the first two sequences, this pattern is a strong predictor of a **dimer**. The presence of glutamine (Q) at other positions can influence stability but does not typically override the strong dimerization signal from the I-L core.\n\n*   **Sequence 5: EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    This sequence is a variation of sequence 1, with a threonine (T) replacing an alanine at a 'd' position. Threonine is a polar amino acid. The introduction of a polar residue into the normally hydrophobic core is a known strategy in protein design to force a higher-order oligomer, as this arrangement can shield the polar group from the hydrophobic environment more effectively. This specific design, with isoleucine at 'a' and a polar residue at 'd', often leads to the formation of a **tetramer**.\n\nBased on this analysis, the oligomeric states for the five sequences are 2, 2, 3, 2, and 4, respectively. This sequence of numbers is not present in the answer choices.\n\nRevisiting the analysis in light of the available options, let's consider alternative interpretations, particularly for sequences that might be misidentified. The sequences are very similar to those used in seminal studies by Harbury et al. on the principles of coiled-coil oligomerization.\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**: I at 'a' and L at 'd'. Should be a **dimer (2)**.\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**: I at 'a', L at 'd', with one N at 'a'. Should be a **dimer (2)**.\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**: I at 'a' and I at 'd'. Should be a **trimer (3)**.\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**: I at 'a' and L at 'd'. Should be a **dimer (2)**.\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**: I at 'a' and a mix of L and T at 'd'. Having a polar Threonine (T) in the hydrophobic core is known to favor tetramers. The original Harbury papers showed that peptides with `I` at 'a' and `L` at 'd' are dimers, `I` at 'a' and `I` at 'd' are trimers, and `L` at 'a' and `I` at 'd' are tetramers. The `I` at 'a' and `T` at 'd' combination also results in a **tetramer (4)**.\n\nSo, the predicted states are 2, 2, 3, 2, 4. This is not an option. Let's re-examine Sequence 3.\n\n*   **Sequence 3: EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**. Core is I-I. This is strongly trimeric.\n*   Let's re-examine Sequence 4: **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**. It has been argued that alternating patterns of I and L can form tetramers. In the GCN4-p-LI model, which is a tetramer, the 'a' positions are Leucine and the 'd' positions are Isoleucine. This sequence has Isoleucine at 'a' and Leucine at 'd', which is dimeric (GCN4-p-IL). The presence of many Glutamine (Q) residues might alter this, but dimer is the most likely state based on the hydrophobic core.\n*   Let's reconsider the options. Option D is 2, 2, 4, 2, 3. This would imply sequence 3 is a tetramer and sequence 5 is a trimer. This contradicts the well-established rules where an I-I core favors trimers and an I-T core favors tetramers.\n\nLet's carefully re-read the Harbury paper's findings.\n- p-IL (a=I, d=L): Dimer\n- p-LI (a=L, d=I): Tetramer\n- p-II (a=I, d=I): Trimer\n\n1.  `EIAQAL...` -> Core is I and L. Seems dimeric.\n2.  `EIAALK...` -> Core is I and L. Seems dimeric.\n3.  `EIAAIK...` -> Core is I and I. Seems trimeric.\n4.  `EIQKQL...` -> Core is I and L. Seems dimeric.\n5.  `EIAQTL...` -> Core is I and T. T at 'd' with I at 'a' is known to form tetramers.\n\nSo, the robust prediction is 2, 2, 3, 2, 4. This is not an option. Let's check the possibility of error in the question or options provided.\n\nLet's assume there is a different interpretation.\nWhat if sequence 3 (`EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`) forms a tetramer? This would mean the I-I packing leads to a 4-helix bundle. While less common than a trimer, it's possible.\nWhat if sequence 5 (`EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`) forms a trimer? The I-T core would need to pack favorably in a 3-helix bundle.\n\nIf we accept this (3 -> 4, 5 -> 3), the sequence becomes 2, 2, 4, 2, 3. This matches option D. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, and my primary analysis (2,2,3,2,4) is not an option, it is plausible that the intended answer relies on a nuance of these specific sequences from a particular study that deviates from the general rules, or there is an error in the question's answer key. However, based on the provided options, the permutation `2, 2, 4, 2, 3` is offered as a choice.\n\nFinal check of logic:\n- Seq 1 (I/L core) -> Dimer (2)\n- Seq 2 (I/L core) -> Dimer (2)\n- Seq 4 (I/L core) -> Dimer (2)\nThis leaves sequences 3 and 5 to be the trimer and tetramer.\n- Seq 3 (I/I core) -> Most likely Trimer (3)\n- Seq 5 (I/T core) -> Most likely Tetramer (4)\nPrediction: 2, 2, 3, 2, 4. No matching option.\n\nLet's swap them as per option D:\n- Seq 3 (I/I core) -> Tetramer (4)\n- Seq 5 (I/T core) -> Trimer (3)\nPrediction: 2, 2, 4, 2, 3. This matches Option D.\n\nWithout the original source publication for these exact sequences, it's impossible to resolve this ambiguity with 100% certainty. However, in the context of a multiple-choice question, one must often find the best fit among the given choices. The assignment of Dimer to sequences 1, 2, and 4 is the most confident prediction. The ambiguity lies with sequences 3 and 5. If we are forced to choose from the given options, and assuming there is a correct answer among them, option D requires swapping the expected states for sequences 3 and 5.\n\n<<<D>>>"
