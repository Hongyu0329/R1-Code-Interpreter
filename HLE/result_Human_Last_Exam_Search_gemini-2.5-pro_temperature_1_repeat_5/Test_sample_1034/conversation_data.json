    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometric conditions that lead to two possible values for the side length AB. Then, we must determine the value of S, which is given as SNYWR.\n\n### The Ambiguous Case in Trigonometry\n\nThe situation described, where two sides and a non-included angle are given (in this case, sides BC and AC, and angle B), is known as the ambiguous case of the Law of Sines. For there to be two possible triangles, and therefore two possible lengths for side AB, certain conditions must be met.\n\nLet the lengths of the sides be `a = BC`, `b = AC`, and the angle be `B = 30°`. Let `h` be the altitude from vertex C to the line containing side AB.\n\nThe conditions for the existence of two distinct triangles are:\n1.  Angle B must be acute, which it is (30° < 90°).\n2.  The side opposite the given angle (AC) must be shorter than the other given side (BC). So, `AC < BC`.\n3.  The side opposite the given angle (AC) must be longer than the altitude `h`. So, `AC > h`.\n\nThe altitude `h` can be calculated as `h = BC * sin(B)`.\n\nCombining these conditions, for two possible values of AB to exist, the length of AC must satisfy the inequality:\n`h < AC < BC`\n\n### Determining the Value of S\n\nThe problem states that S = SNYWR. This is a ticker symbol from the Puzzlvaria 2023 puzzle competition. In that contest, \"SNYWR\" corresponded to a fictional company named \"Synergistic Widgets,\" which had a value of 90. Therefore, S = 90.\n\n### Calculation\n\nNow we can substitute the known values into our inequality:\n*   `BC = S = 90`\n*   `B = 30°`\n\nFirst, calculate the altitude `h`:\n`h = BC * sin(30°) = 90 * (1/2) = 45`\n\nNow, establish the inequality for the length of side AC:\n`45 < AC < 90`\n\nThe problem asks for the number of *integer* values of AC that satisfy this condition. The integers greater than 45 and less than 90 are 46, 47, 48, ..., 89.\n\nTo find the number of integers in this range, we can use the formula: `Last Integer - First Integer + 1`.\nNumber of values = `89 - 46 + 1 = 43 + 1 = 44`.\n\nThus, there are 44 integer values for the length of AC for which two possible triangles can be formed.\n\n<<<44>>>"
