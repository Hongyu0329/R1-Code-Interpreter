    "When viewed from above, the buildings of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa form the letter H. The two high schools are located next to each other on Via Benedetto Croce, a street known as the \"Via dei Licei\" (Street of the High Schools). The Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti is a result of the merger of the Liceo Classico \"Galileo Galilei\" and the Istituto Tecnico Economico \"Antonio Pacinotti\". The two main buildings of the schools are parallel to each other and are connected by a shorter central structure, creating the distinct shape of the letter H. The internal courtyard is shared by both institutes.\n\n<<<H>>>"
