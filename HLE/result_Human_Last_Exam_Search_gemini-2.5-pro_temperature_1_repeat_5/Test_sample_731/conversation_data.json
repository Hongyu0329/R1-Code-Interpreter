    "A power subgroup of a group is a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element. To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we must determine the number of distinct cyclic subgroups.\n\nThe semidihedral group of order 2ⁿ, denoted SD₂ⁿ, is defined by the presentation:\nSD₂ⁿ = ⟨r, s | r²ⁿ⁻¹ = s² = 1, srs = r²ⁿ⁻²⁻¹⟩\n\nFor the semidihedral group of size 512, we have 2ⁿ = 512, which means n = 9. The group is SD₅₁₂ and its presentation is:\nSD₅₁₂ = ⟨r, s | r²⁵⁶ = s² = 1, srs = r¹²⁷⟩\n\nThe elements of this group consist of two types:\n1.  Powers of `r`: {rⁱ | 0 ≤ i < 256}\n2.  Elements of the form `srⁱ`: {srⁱ | 0 ≤ i < 256}\n\nWe need to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups ⟨g⟩ for every element g in SD₅₁₂.\n\n**1. Cyclic subgroups generated by powers of `r`:**\nThe element `r` generates a cyclic subgroup ⟨r⟩ of order 256. The number of distinct subgroups of a cyclic group of order `m` is equal to the number of divisors of `m`. Here, m = 256 = 2⁸. The number of divisors is 8 + 1 = 9. These 9 subgroups are generated by the elements rᵈ where d is a divisor of 256.\n\n**2. Cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form `srⁱ`:**\nWe must determine the order of these elements and how many distinct subgroups they generate. The square of an element `srⁱ` is:\n(srⁱ)² = srⁱsrⁱ = s(rⁱs)rⁱ = s(sr⁻ⁱ)rⁱ = r⁻ⁱrⁱ = 1 is for the dihedral group. For the semidihedral group `srs = r^k` which implies `sr=r^ks`.\nA more general identity is `srⁱs = (srs)ⁱ = r^(ik)`. For SD₅₁₂, k = 127.\nSo, (srⁱ)² = srⁱsrⁱ = r¹²⁷ⁱrⁱ = r¹²⁸ⁱ.\n\n*   **Case A: `i` is even.** Let `i = 2j`.\n    (sr²ʲ)² = r¹²⁸⁽²ʲ⁾ = r²⁵⁶ʲ = 1.\n    So, if `i` is even, the element `srⁱ` has order 2. There are 256/2 = 128 such elements (for i = 0, 2, ..., 254). Each of these 128 elements generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. These are distinct from the single subgroup of order 2 within ⟨r⟩ (which is ⟨r¹²⁸⟩). Thus, we have 128 new subgroups.\n\n*   **Case B: `i` is odd.** Let `i = 2j + 1`.\n    (srⁱ)² = r¹²⁸ⁱ = r¹²⁸ since i is odd and the order of r is 256. The element r¹²⁸ has order 2.\n    This means (srⁱ)⁴ = ((srⁱ)²)² = (r¹²⁸)² = 1.\n    So, if `i` is odd, the element `srⁱ` has order 4. There are 128 such elements (for i = 1, 3, ..., 255).\n    The subgroup generated by `srⁱ` is {1, srⁱ, r¹²⁸, (srⁱ)³}. The other generator of this subgroup is (srⁱ)³ = srⁱr¹²⁸ = srⁱ⁺¹²⁸.\n    This means that ⟨srⁱ⟩ = ⟨srⁱ⁺¹²⁸⟩. The 128 elements of order 4 pair up to generate the same subgroup. Therefore, they form 128 / 2 = 64 distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. These subgroups are not contained within ⟨r⟩, so they are all new subgroups.\n\nIn total, the number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from each case:\n*   Subgroups from ⟨r⟩: 9\n*   Subgroups from `srⁱ` with `i` even: 128\n*   Subgroups from `srⁱ` with `i` odd: 64\n\nTotal number of power subgroups = 9 + 128 + 64 = 201.\n\nThis result is confirmed by a known formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in SD₂ⁿ, which is n + 3 ⋅ 2ⁿ⁻³. For n=9, this gives 9 + 3 ⋅ 2⁶ = 9 + 3 ⋅ 64 = 9 + 192 = 201.\n\n<<<201>>>"
