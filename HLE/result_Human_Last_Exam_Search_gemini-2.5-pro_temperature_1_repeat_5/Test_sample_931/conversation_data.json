    "Adult Raphidiopterans, commonly known as snakeflies, are predators that primarily feed on small, soft-bodied arthropods. Their diet often includes aphids, mites, and insect eggs.\n\nIn addition to being predaceous, some adult snakeflies have been observed consuming pollen and nectar. Gut content analysis has confirmed the presence of pollen in some species. While most predatory species feed on insects like aphids, non-predatory species are known to feed on nectar, pollen, or honeydew.\n\nBased on the available information:\n*   **A. Nectar:** Snakeflies have been recorded feeding on nectar.\n*   **E. Totara Aphids:** As snakeflies are known predators of aphids in general, they would likely feed on Totara Aphids.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that adult snakeflies feed on fungus or leaf tissue. Therefore, both nectar and aphids are part of their recorded diet.\n\n<<<F>>>"
