    "To determine the probability of finding the particle in the 1D box within the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a for the n=2 state, we must calculate the integral of the probability density function over this specific interval.\n\n### Theoretical Basis\nThe normalized wave function for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length 'a' is given by:\n*ψₙ(x) = √(2/a) sin(nπx/a)*\n\nThe probability density, which describes the likelihood of finding the particle at a specific position, is the square of the wave function:\n*P(x) = |ψₙ(x)|² = (2/a) sin²(nπx/a)*\n\nThe probability of finding the particle in a given interval [x₁, x₂] is calculated by integrating the probability density over that interval:\n*Prob(x₁ ≤ x ≤ x₂) = ∫[from x₁ to x₂] (2/a) sin²(nπx/a) dx*\n\n### Calculation\nFor this problem, we have:\n*   Quantum number, n = 2\n*   Lower bound, x₁ = 0.495a\n*   Upper bound, x₂ = 0.505a\n\nThe interval is centered around x = 0.5a. For the n=2 state, the wave function has a node at the center of the box (x = a/2), meaning the probability density at this exact point is zero.\n*ψ₂(a/2) = √(2/a) sin(2π(a/2)/a) = √(2/a) sin(π) = 0*\n\nBecause the probability density is zero at the center of our interval, we must perform the full integration to find the non-zero probability over the small interval.\n\nThe integral to solve is:\n*Prob = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) sin²(2πx/a) dx*\n\nTo simplify the integral, we use the trigonometric identity sin²(θ) = (1 - cos(2θ))/2:\n*Prob = (2/a) ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (1/2)(1 - cos(4πx/a)) dx*\n*Prob = (1/a) [x - (a/4π)sin(4πx/a)] evaluated from 0.495a to 0.505a*\n\nEvaluating at the limits:\n*Prob = (1/a) * [ (0.505a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.505a)/a)) - (0.495a - (a/4π)sin(4π(0.495a)/a)) ]*\n*Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) [sin(2.02π) - sin(1.98π)]*\n\nUsing the identity sin(2π ± δ) = ±sin(δ), we get:\n*sin(2.02π) = sin(0.02π)*\n*sin(1.98π) = -sin(0.02π)*\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation:\n*Prob = 0.01 - (1/4π) [sin(0.02π) - (-sin(0.02π))] = 0.01 - (1/2π)sin(0.02π)*\n\nFor a small angle δ (in radians), sin(δ) can be approximated by the Taylor series δ - δ³/6. Let δ = 0.02π:\n*Prob ≈ 0.01 - (1/2π) [ (0.02π) - (0.02π)³/6 ]*\n*Prob ≈ 0.01 - [ 0.01 - (0.02π)³/(12π) ]*\n*Prob ≈ (0.000008 π³)/(12π) = (2/3)π² × 10⁻⁶*\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n*Prob ≈ (2/3) * (9.8696) × 10⁻⁶ ≈ 6.5797 × 10⁻⁶*\n\nThus, the probability of finding the particle in the interval from 0.495a to 0.505a is approximately 0.00000658.\n\n<<<0.00000658>>>"
