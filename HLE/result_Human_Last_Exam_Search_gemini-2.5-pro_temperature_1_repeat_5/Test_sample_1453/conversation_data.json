    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`, we must analyze its structure based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Heptad Repeat\n\nCoiled-coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern known as a heptad repeat, denoted by the letters `abcdefg`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are typically hydrophobic and form the core of the structure, which is stabilized by the \"knobs-into-holes\" packing of their side chains. The identity of these core residues is the primary determinant of the oligomeric state.\n\nThe provided sequence is: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n\nTo find the correct phasing of the heptad repeat, we must identify a pattern where hydrophobic residues consistently fall at the 'a' and 'd' positions. Let's test a possible alignment:\n\n*   **Sequence**: `G E I A Q S L K E I A K S L K E I A W S L K E I A Q S L K G`\n*   **Position**: `f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c d e f`\n\nWith this alignment, we can identify the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions:\n\n*   **'a' positions**: The amino acid at every 'a' position is **Alanine (A)**.\n*   **'d' positions**: The amino acid at every 'd' position is **Leucine (L)**.\n\nThis alignment provides a consistent and chemically sensible hydrophobic core, with small, nonpolar Alanine at all 'a' positions and larger, nonpolar Leucine at all 'd' positions.\n\n### 2. Knobs-into-Holes Packing and Oligomeric State\n\nThe specific combination of amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions dictates the packing efficiency and, consequently, the number of helices (oligomeric state) that will assemble.\n\n*   **Classic Rules**: Landmark studies on the GCN4 coiled-coil established rules for oligomerization. For example, having Isoleucine (a beta-branched amino acid) at 'a' and Leucine at 'd' strongly favors a **dimer (2 helices)**. Conversely, placing Leucine at 'a' and Isoleucine at 'd' favors a **tetramer (4 helices)**.\n*   **Impact of Alanine**: Alanine has a very small methyl side chain. The stability of a coiled-coil comes from the burial of hydrophobic surface area away from water.\n    *   **Dimer (State of 2)**: In a dimer, the 'a' position of one helix packs against the 'a' position of the other. An interface formed by two small Alanine residues would be minimal, likely providing insufficient hydrophobic interaction to drive stable dimerization.\n    *   **Tetramer (State of 4)**: A tetramer would require four Alanine residues to pack together at each 'a' layer. This would create a significant void or cavity in the hydrophobic core, which is energetically unfavorable and would destabilize the structure.\n    *   **Trimer (State of 3)**: A trimer offers the most plausible arrangement. It requires three helices to come together, burying more hydrophobic surface area than a dimer. The central cavity created by three Alanine side chains at the 'a' positions would be smaller and less destabilizing than the cavity in a tetramer. The stable layers formed by the larger Leucine residues at the 'd' positions would further support the trimeric structure. This state represents the best compromise between maximizing hydrophobic burial and maintaining efficient core packing without creating large destabilizing cavities.\n\nBased on this analysis of packing efficiency, the sequence is most likely to form a trimer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
