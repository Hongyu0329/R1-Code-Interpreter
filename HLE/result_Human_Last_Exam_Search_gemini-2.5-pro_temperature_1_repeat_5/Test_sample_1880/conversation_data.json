    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, the following steps are taken:\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility:**\nThe polynomial's irreducibility over the rational numbers ($\\mathbb{Q}$) is determined using Eisenstein's criterion. For the prime number $p=2$:\n*   2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\n*   2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n*   $2^2 = 4$ does not divide the constant term 14.\n\nSince these conditions are met, the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. This implies that the order of its Galois group is a multiple of 4.\n\n**2. Determine the Resolvent Cubic:**\nFor a quartic polynomial of the form $x^4 + cx + d$, the resolvent cubic is given by the formula $g(x) = x^3 - 4dx - c^2$. For the given polynomial, $c=8$ and $d=14$.\n\nSubstituting these values, the resolvent cubic is:\n$g(x) = x^3 - 4(14)x - 8^2 = x^3 - 56x - 64$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:**\nThe nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic provides information about the structure of the Galois group of the quartic polynomial. We test for rational roots of $g(x)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64.\n\nTesting the divisors, we find that $g(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSince $x=8$ is a root, $(x-8)$ is a factor of the resolvent cubic. Performing polynomial division:\n$(x^3 - 56x - 64) \\div (x - 8) = x^2 + 8x + 8$.\n\nThe remaining roots are found by solving the quadratic equation $x^2 + 8x + 8 = 0$ using the quadratic formula:\n$x = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{8^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = -4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe roots of the resolvent cubic are $8$, $-4 + 2\\sqrt{2}$, and $-4 - 2\\sqrt{2}$. Since one root is rational and the other two are irrational, the resolvent cubic has exactly one root in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n**4. Determine the Galois Group:**\nFor an irreducible quartic polynomial over the rationals:\n*   If the resolvent cubic is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is either $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n*   If the resolvent cubic has a rational root, the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$ or the cyclic group $C_4$.\n\nIn this case, since the resolvent cubic is reducible and has exactly one rational root, the Galois group of the polynomial $x^4 + 8x + 14$ is the dihedral group $D_4$.\n\n**5. Order of the Galois Group:**\nThe dihedral group $D_4$ is the group of symmetries of a square, and its order is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
