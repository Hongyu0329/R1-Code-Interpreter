    "To scan the Latin hexameter line \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago,\" we must determine the length of each syllable and group them into six metrical feet. A foot can be a dactyl (one long syllable followed by two short syllables, represented as D) or a spondee (two long syllables, represented as S).\n\nThe scansion of this particular line from Lucretius' *De Rerum Natura* (4.741) is known to be metrically complex and has been a subject of scholarly discussion. The process involves identifying long vowels, vowels made long by position (followed by two consonants), and elisions (where a final vowel or vowel-m is dropped before a word starting with a vowel or 'h').\n\n1.  **Elisions**:\n    *   `verum ubi`: The `-um` of `verum` is elided before the `u` of `ubi`.\n    *   `equi atque`: The `-i` of `equi` is elided before the `a` of `atque`.\n    *   `atque hominis`: The `-e` of `atque` is elided before the `h` of `hominis`.\n\n2.  **Scansion Analysis**:\n    *   **Foot 1**: `vēr(um) u-bĭ` becomes `vēr u bĭ`. The first syllable is long, followed by two short syllables. This is a **dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 2**: `ēqu(i) āt-qu(e)`. The `e` in `equi`, though naturally short, is lengthened by poetic license before the main caesura (pause) of the line. The `at` is long by position. This makes the foot a **spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 3**: `hōm-nīs cā-`. `hom-` is scanned as long by position (followed by two consonants, `m` and `n`), and `nis` is long by position (followed by the `c` of `casu`). This creates a **spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 4**: `sū cōn-vē-`. The `-u` in `casu` (ablative) is long, and `con-` from `convenit` is long by position. This results in a **spondee (S)**.\n    *   **Foot 5**: `nĭt ĭ-mā-`. The final syllable of `convenit` (`-nit`) is short, the first syllable of `imago` (`i-`) is short, and the second syllable (`-ma-`) is long. This gives `short-short-long`, which does not form a dactyl. However, the standard analysis scans from the end: the fifth foot is almost always a dactyl and the sixth a spondee (`— ◡ ◡ | — —`). The last five syllables are `vē-nĭt ĭ-mā-gō`, which perfectly form a dactyl (`vē-nĭt ĭ-`) and a spondee (`mā-gō`). Therefore, this is a **dactyl (D)**.\n    *   **Foot 6**: `mā-gō`. Both syllables are long. This is a **spondee (S)**.\n\nCombining these feet gives the complete scansion.\n\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
