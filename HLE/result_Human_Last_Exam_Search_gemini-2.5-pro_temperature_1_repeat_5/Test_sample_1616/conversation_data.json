    "Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule in English where a tense (long) vowel becomes lax (short) when it is followed by two or more syllables. Examining the words provided:\n\n*   **southern**: The vowel in \"south\" (/aʊ/) becomes the lax vowel /ʌ/ in \"southern\". While \"southern\" is now two syllables, in Middle English, it was pronounced with three syllables (*sūtherne*). The vowel shortening occurred at this stage, making it a classic, though now opaque, example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **derivative**: This word demonstrates trisyllabic laxing in the shift from the tense vowel /aɪ/ in \"derive\" to the lax vowel /ɪ/ in \"derivative\". The syllable with the changed vowel is followed by two more syllables (-a-tive).\n*   **serenity**: This is a clear example of the rule. The tense vowel /iː/ in \"serene\" becomes the lax vowel /ɛ/ in \"serenity\", where the affected syllable is followed by two others (-ni-ty).\n*   **gratitude**: The vowel in \"grateful\" (/eɪ/) laxes to /æ/ in \"gratitude\". The first syllable is followed by two more (-i-tude), fitting the pattern of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: The vowel change from \"shade\" (/eɪ/) to \"shadow\" (/æ/) is an example of a different process called disyllabic laxing, as the affected vowel is followed by only one syllable. Therefore, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: The vowel change from \"please\" (/iː/) to \"pleasant\" (/ɛ/) is also an example of disyllabic laxing, not trisyllabic laxing, because the vowel is followed by a single syllable.\n\nBoth *shadow* and *pleasant* did not undergo trisyllabic laxing; they underwent disyllabic laxing instead, which is considered a different process. However, since the question asks for a single answer, and both are valid examples of not undergoing *trisyllabic* laxing, there may be ambiguity. Both are consistently cited as examples of the separate rule of disyllabic laxing.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
