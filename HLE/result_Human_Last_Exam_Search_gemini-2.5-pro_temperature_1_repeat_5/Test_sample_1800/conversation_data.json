    "Ni-Ceria (Ni-CeO₂) nanoparticles have emerged as highly effective catalysts for both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting processes, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The catalytic performance of these materials is intricately linked to the atomic ratio of nickel to cerium, as this ratio significantly influences the catalyst's structural and electronic properties, such as oxygen vacancy concentration and metal-support interactions.\n\n### Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction\n\nFor the WGS reaction, which is crucial for hydrogen production and CO cleanup, the optimal Ni/Ce ratio can vary depending on the specific reaction conditions and catalyst preparation method. Research indicates that increasing the nickel loading is generally beneficial for catalytic activity. One study focusing on CO₂ methanation, a reaction closely related to the reverse WGS (rWGS), identified an optimal performance with a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of 1. Another investigation into the rWGS reaction determined that the best results were achieved with a molar Ni proportion of approximately 7%. Further research has demonstrated high CO conversion rates with Ni concentrations of 10 and 12.5 wt%. The addition of even small amounts of Ni (as low as 2 wt.%) has been shown to significantly enhance the WGS activity of ceria. The strong interaction between nickel and ceria is a key factor, with highly dispersed nickel species playing a crucial role.\n\n### Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio for Water Splitting\n\nIn the context of water splitting, Ni-Ceria nanoparticles are particularly promising for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is often the kinetic bottleneck in the overall process. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for water splitting is closely tied to the creation of oxygen vacancies, which act as active sites and enhance conductivity.\n\nOne study found that catalysts with Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 (Ni₇₅Ce₂₅Oₓ) and 1:1 (Ni₅₀Ce₅₀Oₓ) exhibited superior OER activity. This enhanced performance was attributed to a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies in these compositions. Another study on a Ni₃N-CeO₂ heterostructure for overall water splitting demonstrated excellent performance but explored a range of molar ratios rather than identifying a single optimum.\n\nFurthermore, research on Ni and Fe co-doped ceria for water splitting utilized a 20 mol% total doping of Ni and Fe in a 1:1 ratio, again highlighting the importance of the dopant concentration. The synergy between Ni and CeO₂ is consistently reported as a critical factor for enhancing catalytic proficiency in water electrolysis.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't a single universal Ni/Ce ratio that is optimal for all conditions and applications, a consensus emerges from the literature:\n\n*   For the **Water Gas Shift reaction**, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio in the range of **1.0** or a nickel loading of **7-12.5 wt%** appears to be highly effective.\n*   For **water splitting (OER)**, Ni/Ce atomic ratios of **3:1 and 1:1** have been shown to maximize catalytic performance due to the generation of a high concentration of oxygen vacancies.\n\nThe ideal ratio for a specific application will ultimately depend on the desired reaction, operating conditions, and the method of catalyst synthesis.\n\n<<<For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1.0 or a nickel loading of 7-12.5 wt% is often reported as optimal. For water splitting, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 have demonstrated the highest catalytic performance.>>>"
