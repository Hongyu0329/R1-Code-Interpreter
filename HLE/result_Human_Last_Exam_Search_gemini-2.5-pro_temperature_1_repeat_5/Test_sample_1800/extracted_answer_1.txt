For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, a Ni/Ce atomic ratio of approximately 1.0 or a nickel loading of 7-12.5 wt% is often reported as optimal. For water splitting, particularly the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), Ni/Ce atomic ratios of 3:1 and 1:1 have demonstrated the highest catalytic performance.
