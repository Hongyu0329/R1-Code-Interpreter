    "The defining characteristics of the European Tango distinguish it from the other Standard ballroom dances. Dances like the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep are swing dances, which involve continuous, flowing movements, and often incorporate sway. Tango, in contrast, is known for its staccato movements, the absence of rise and fall, and a sharp, grounded action.\n\nA reverse turn is a common figure in ballroom dancing that rotates to the left. In swing dances, the technical elements of sway and continuous body motion, while having prescribed amounts of turn, can be exaggerated. Overturning a reverse turn in a Waltz, for example, is a common error, but it is mechanically possible within the dance's framework, even if it results in poor technique and balance.\n\nIn Tango, however, the technique is fundamentally different. A reverse turn in Tango, such as a Rock Turn or a Basic Reverse Turn, requires sharp, staccato actions and maintaining a connection through the hips with feet kept close together. The technique explicitly forbids the use of sway. To overturn the turn, a dancer would need to introduce a swinging momentum or sway into the body, which is a direct contradiction of the foundational Tango technique. Therefore, attempting to overturn a reverse turn would mean abandoning the core principles of Tango movement.\n\nFor this reason, it is considered technically impossible to overturn a reverse turn in the European Tango without fundamentally disregarding the dance's unique technique.\n\n<<<C>>>"
