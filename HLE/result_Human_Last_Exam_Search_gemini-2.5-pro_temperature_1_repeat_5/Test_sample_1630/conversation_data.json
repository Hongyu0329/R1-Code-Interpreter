    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for the composite function $f(g(x))$.\n\n### 1. Define the Problem\nA fixed point of a function $h(x)$ is a value $x$ such that $h(x) = x$. In this case, our function is $h(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ and $g$ are polynomials of degree 3. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation:\n$f(g(x)) = x$\n\n### 2. Determine the Degree of the Composite Polynomial\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nThe composition of these two polynomials, $h(x) = f(g(x))$, results in a new polynomial. The degree of a composite polynomial is the product of the degrees of the individual polynomials.\nDegree of $h(x)$ = Degree of $f(x)$ × Degree of $g(x)$ = 3 × 3 = 9.\nSo, $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n### 3. Formulate the Fixed-Point Equation\nThe equation for the fixed points is $f(g(x)) = x$. We can rewrite this as:\n$f(g(x)) - x = 0$\n\nThis is a polynomial equation. Since $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree 9, the expression $f(g(x)) - x$ is also a polynomial of degree 9.\n\n### 4. Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a polynomial of degree $n$ has at most $n$ real roots.\nTherefore, the equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, which is a polynomial equation of degree 9, can have at most 9 real roots. This implies that the function $f(g(x))$ can have a maximum of 9 fixed points.\n\n### 5. Analyze the Constraints\nWe are given two conditions:\n1.  $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n2.  $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n\nFor a cubic polynomial, its derivative is a quadratic. For the derivative to be always positive, the cubic function must be strictly increasing. Thus, both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are strictly increasing functions.\n\nLet's examine the derivative of the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ using the chain rule:\n$h'(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$\n\nSince $g'(x) > 0$ for all $x$, and $f'(y) > 0$ for any input $y$, it follows that $f'(g(x))$ is also always positive. The product of two positive numbers is positive, so:\n$h'(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n\nThis means that the composite function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is also a strictly increasing function.\n\n### 6. Re-evaluate the Maximum Number of Fixed Points\nThe question now is whether the fact that $f(g(x))$ is strictly increasing limits the number of fixed points below 9. We are looking for the number of intersections between the graph of the strictly increasing degree-9 polynomial $y = f(g(x))$ and the graph of the strictly increasing line $y = x$.\n\nTo see if 9 intersections are possible, we can use Rolle's Theorem. Let $P(x) = f(g(x)) - x$. If $P(x) = 0$ has $k$ distinct real roots, then its derivative, $P'(x)$, must have at least $k-1$ distinct real roots.\n\nLet's analyze the derivative:\n$P'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$\n\n*   $g(x)$ is degree 3, so $g'(x)$ is degree 2.\n*   $f(x)$ is degree 3, so $f'(x)$ is degree 2.\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is of degree 2 × 3 = 6.\n*   The product $f'(g(x))g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nSo, $P'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. A polynomial of degree 8 can have at most 8 real roots. If $P'(x)=0$ has 8 roots, then by Rolle's Theorem, $P(x)=0$ can have at most $8+1=9$ roots.\n\nThe conditions $f' > 0$ and $g' > 0$ do not prevent $P'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$ from having 8 real roots. It is possible to construct the polynomials such that the graph of $y = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ oscillates and intersects the line $y=1$ at 8 different points, while always remaining positive.\n\nSince it is possible for the derivative $P'(x)$ to have 8 roots, it is possible for the function $P(x)$ to have 9 roots. Therefore, the constraints do not reduce the maximum number of fixed points.\n\nThe maximum number of fixed points is the degree of the polynomial equation $f(g(x)) - x = 0$, which is 9.\n\n<<<9>>>"
