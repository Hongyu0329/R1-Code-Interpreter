    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction for primes greater than 2, we need to analyze two properties for each curve: the places of bad reduction and the nature of the reduction (ordinary or supersingular) at the primes of good reduction.\n\nA hyperelliptic curve given by the equation `z^2 = f(x)` has **good reduction** at a prime `p` if the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)` is not divisible by `p`. For the curve to have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`, the discriminant of `f(x)` must only be divisible by the prime 2, if at all. In other words, the discriminant must be of the form `Â±2^k` for some integer `k`.\n\nLet's calculate the discriminant for the polynomial `f(x)` for each option:\n\n*   **A. z^2 = x^5 + 3:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 + 3`. The discriminant of a polynomial of the form `x^n + c` is given by `(-1)^(n(n-1)/2) * n^n * c^(n-1)`. For this curve, the discriminant is `(-1)^(10) * 5^5 * 3^4 = 3125 * 81 = 253125`. Since the discriminant is divisible by 3 and 5, the curve has bad reduction at `p=3` and `p=5`. Therefore, it does not have good reduction for all primes above 2.\n\n*   **B. z^2 = x^5 - 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^5 - 1`. The discriminant is `(-1)^(10) * 5^5 * (-1)^4 = 3125 = 5^5`. The discriminant is divisible by 5, so the curve has bad reduction at `p=5`. This means it does not have good reduction for all primes above 2.\n\n*   **C. z^2 = x^6 - 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = x^6 - 1`. The discriminant of `x^n - 1` is `(-1)^(n(n-1)/2) * n^n`. For `n=6`, this is `(-1)^15 * 6^6 = -46656 = -2^6 * 3^6`. Since the discriminant is divisible by 3, the curve has bad reduction at `p=3`. Thus, it does not have good reduction for all primes above 2.\n\n*   **D. z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1:** The polynomial is `f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1`. Calculating the discriminant for this polynomial yields `2048 = 2^11`. Since the discriminant is a power of 2, it is not divisible by any odd prime `p`. This means the curve has good reduction for all primes `p > 2`.\n\n*   **E. z^2 = 4*x + x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^5:** The polynomial is `f(x) = 4x^5 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 4x`. The discriminant of this polynomial is `130816 = 2^8 * 511 = 2^8 * 7 * 73`. As the discriminant is divisible by 7 and 73, the curve has bad reduction at `p=7` and `p=73`. Therefore, it does not have good reduction for all primes above 2.\n\nBased on the analysis of the discriminant, only the curve in option D has good reduction for all primes `p > 2`. A curve must have good reduction at a prime to have good ordinary reduction there. While a curve with good reduction at a prime `p` can be either ordinary or supersingular, it is a known result in number theory that a curve over `Q` without complex multiplication will have good ordinary reduction for a positive density of primes. The other options are eliminated because they have bad reduction at certain odd primes. Therefore, curve D is the only candidate that can have good ordinary reduction for any prime above 2.\n\n<<<D>>>"
