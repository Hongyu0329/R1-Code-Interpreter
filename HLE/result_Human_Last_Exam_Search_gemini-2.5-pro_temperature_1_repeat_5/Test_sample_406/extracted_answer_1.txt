An FGH-tripled fixed point for the functions F: X × Y × Z → X, G: Y × Z × X → Y, and H: Z × X × Y → Z exists if (X, d_X, ⪯_X), (Y, d_Y, ⪯_Y), and (Z, d_Z, ⪯_Z) are complete partially ordered metric spaces; F, G, and H satisfy a mixed monotone property and a contractive condition on the product space; and there exists an initial point (x₀, y₀, z₀) that has a specific order-relation with (F(x₀, y₀, z₀), G(y₀, z₀, x₀), H(z₀, x₀, y₀)). Additionally, either the functions must be continuous or the spaces must satisfy a regularity condition.
