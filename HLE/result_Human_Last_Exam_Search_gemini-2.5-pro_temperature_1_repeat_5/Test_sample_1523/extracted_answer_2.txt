In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the action of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time τ having a period β = 1/T). Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(φ, D_φ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) φ(x)

This expression is equivalent to twice the Euclidean action for the free scalar field, and it forms the quadratic part of the action in the exponent of the path integral for the partition function.
