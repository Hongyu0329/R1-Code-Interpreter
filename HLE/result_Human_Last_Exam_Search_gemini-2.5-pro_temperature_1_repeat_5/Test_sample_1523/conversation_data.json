    "In finite-temperature field theory, the partition function Z for a neutral scalar field φ is represented by a functional integral over all field configurations that are periodic in imaginary time τ with period β = 1/T, where T is the temperature. This is expressed as:\n\nZ = ∫ Dφ exp(-S_E[φ])\n\nwhere S_E[φ] is the Euclidean action of the scalar field.\n\nFor a free neutral scalar field with mass m, the Euclidean action is given by:\n\nS_E[φ] = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x [ ½ (∂_τ φ)² + ½ (∇φ)² + ½ m²φ² ]\n\nThis action can be rewritten by performing an integration by parts (assuming the boundary terms vanish due to the periodicity of φ in τ and assuming φ vanishes at spatial infinity). This allows us to express the action in terms of a differential operator, D_φ:\n\nS_E[φ] = ½ ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) φ(x)\n\nThe operator D_φ is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n\nThe inner product (A, B) in the space of real scalar fields over Euclidean spacetime is defined as:\n\n(A, B) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x A(x)B(x)\n\nFollowing this definition, the inner product of the field φ with the result of the operator D_φ acting on φ, denoted as (φ, D_φ), is:\n\n(φ, D_φ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(x) [(-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) φ(x)]\n\nThis expression is precisely twice the Euclidean action for the free scalar field. Therefore, the term appears in the exponent of the functional integral representation of the partition function as:\n\nZ = ∫ Dφ exp[-½ (φ, D_φ)]\n\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) in the functional integral representation of the partition function is given by the integral of the field ϕ multiplied by the action of the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator on ϕ over the Euclidean spacetime (with imaginary time τ having a period β = 1/T). Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n\n(φ, D_φ) = ∫₀^β dτ ∫ d³x φ(x) (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) φ(x)\n\nThis expression is equivalent to twice the Euclidean action for the free scalar field, and it forms the quadratic part of the action in the exponent of the path integral for the partition function."
