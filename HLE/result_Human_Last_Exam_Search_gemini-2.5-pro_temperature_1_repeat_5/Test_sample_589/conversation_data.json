    "The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager has a direct confrontation with a car and features prominent pink imagery is **Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (2019)**.\n\nIn the film, the teenage protagonist, Nancy Drew, played by Sophia Lillis, is threatened by a man in a car in a dark alley while she is on her skateboard. While the mode of transport is a skateboard and not a pink bicycle, the movie has a notable pink theme. For instance, a key clue in the mystery involves \"Pink Flamingo paint,\" and a DVD extra is titled \"Pink Footprints: Touring Twin Elms.\" The production also involved spray-painting grass and bushes pink for certain scenes.\n\nThe film was produced by A Very Good Production and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a major film studio. The discrepancy between the skateboard in the film and the \"pink bike\" in the query is likely a misremembering of details, as the other key elements strongly align.\n\n<<<Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase (2019)>>>"
