The final product, C, is **1-bromo-4-phenylbutane**.

**Chirality Explanation:**

The final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane, is **achiral**.

The starting material, [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, possessed a single stereocenter at carbon-3, making it a chiral molecule. However, the first reaction step is an elimination that forms 4-phenylbut-1-ene. This reaction removes the stereocenter by creating a carbon-carbon double bond. The subsequent reactions, hydroboration-oxidation and substitution with PBrâ‚ƒ, do not introduce any new stereocenters. Since the initial chirality was lost in the first step and no new chiral centers were formed, the final product C is achiral.
