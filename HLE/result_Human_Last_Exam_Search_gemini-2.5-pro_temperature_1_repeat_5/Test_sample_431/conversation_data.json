    "The human GABAAρ1 (Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit rho-1) homomeric receptor contains a single Cysteine residue in its TM3-TM4 linker domain.\n\nThe GABAAρ1 receptor, with the UniProt accession number P24046, has a well-defined structure consisting of four transmembrane (TM) domains. The third transmembrane domain (TM3) spans amino acid positions 343 to 365, and the fourth transmembrane domain (TM4) is located at positions 454 to 474. The region connecting these two domains, known as the TM3-TM4 linker, encompasses amino acid residues from position 366 to 453.\n\nThe amino acid sequence for this linker region is:\nTVQERKEQKLREKLPCTSGLPPPRTAMLDGNYSDGEVNDLDNYMPENGEKPDRMMVQLTLASERSSPQRKSQRSSYVSMRIDTHAIDKYSRI\n\nA manual count of the Cysteine (C) residues within this specific sequence reveals the presence of only one such residue.\n\n<<<1>>>"
