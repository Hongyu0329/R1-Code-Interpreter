    "The surname of the English poet is Auden.\n\nThe essay in question is Joseph Brodsky's \"A Guide to a Renamed City,\" which was originally written in English and is part of his 1986 collection *Less Than One*. In the essay, Brodsky compares the bare facades of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) with those of other European cities.\n\nThe original English sentence reads: \"Unlike, say, Vienna or Paris, where almost every facade is clad in more or less thick foliage...\"\n\nIn the well-known Russian translation by Viktor Golyshev, this sentence becomes: \"В отличие от Вены, скажем, или Парижа, где каждый фасад одет в более или менее густую листву...\" The word \"одет\" (pronounced \"odet\") means \"is dressed.\" This is a pun on the surname of the English poet W. H. Auden, whose name is transliterated into Russian as \"Оден\" (Oden). Brodsky held Auden in very high esteem and visited him in Austria, where Auden spent his later years and was eventually buried. This literary wordplay in the translation is a nod to Brodsky's deep admiration for the poet.\n\n<<<Auden>>>"
