    "There are 12 categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\nLet the two objects be A and B. A category on these objects must contain two identity morphisms, id_A: A → A and id_B: B → B. This leaves two additional non-identity morphisms, let's call them f and g.\n\nWe can classify the categories based on the distribution of these two non-identity morphisms among the four possible hom-sets: Hom(A, A), Hom(A, B), Hom(B, A), and Hom(B, B). For each distribution, we must define a valid composition law that satisfies associativity and the identity laws. The number of non-isomorphic categories is then found by considering all possible structures and identifying those that are not isomorphic to each other.\n\nThe classification proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Both non-identity morphisms are endomorphisms of the same object.**\n    *   This corresponds to the case where Hom(A, A) contains {id_A, f, g}, and Hom(B, B) contains only {id_B} (or vice-versa). The composition of morphisms in Hom(A, A) must define a monoid of order 3. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Each of these defines a distinct category structure. The case where the endomorphisms are on object B is isomorphic to this one by simply relabeling the objects. This gives **7** distinct categories.\n\n2.  **One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism of A, and the other is an endomorphism of B.**\n    *   Here, Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f} and Hom(B, B) = {id_B, g}. The composition is determined by the monoid structures on these sets; for a 2-element monoid, the only possibility is that the non-identity element is idempotent (f∘f = f and g∘g = g). This defines a single category, which is the disjoint union of two simple monoids. This gives **1** category.\n\n3.  **One non-identity morphism is an endomorphism, and the other is a morphism between the two objects.** There are two sub-cases that are not isomorphic:\n    *   f is in Hom(A, A) and g is in Hom(A, B). For the structure to be a category, we must have f∘f = f and g∘f = g. This defines one category.\n    *   f is in Hom(A, A) and g is in Hom(B, A). Similarly, we must have f∘f = f and f∘g = g. This category is not isomorphic to the previous one (it is its opposite).\n    The other two permutations of this case (where the endomorphism is on B) are isomorphic to these two by relabeling the objects. This gives **2** distinct categories.\n\n4.  **Both non-identity morphisms are between the two different objects.** There are two sub-cases:\n    *   Both morphisms go in the same direction, for instance, Hom(A, B) = {f, g}. In this case, no non-trivial compositions are possible. This gives a single categorical structure. The case where both go from B to A is isomorphic by relabeling. This gives **1** category.\n    *   One morphism goes from A to B (f), and the other from B to A (g). For this to be a category, we must define the compositions f∘g and g∘f. These must be the identity morphisms in their respective endomorphism sets, so f∘g = id_B and g∘f = id_A. This is the category known as the \"walking isomorphism\". This gives **1** category.\n\nSumming up the number of non-isomorphic categories from each case: 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 12.\n\n"
