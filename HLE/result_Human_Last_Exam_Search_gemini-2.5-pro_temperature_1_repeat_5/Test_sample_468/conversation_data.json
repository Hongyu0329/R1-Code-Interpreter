    "Multiple sources confirm that the most commonly used name for the genus *Perdita* in their native range of North America is \"fairy bee\". While they are also referred to as \"miner bees,\" this term is much broader and applies to the entire bee family Andrenidae, which includes other genera. The name \"fairy bee\" is more specific to *Perdita*, likely due to their very small size, with some species being among the smallest bees in the world.\n\nThe exact year the term \"fairy bee\" was coined is difficult to pinpoint from the available information. However, publications from the late 19th and early 20th centuries use this common name for specific species within the genus. For instance, *Perdita nevadensis* was given the common name \"Nevada Fairy Bee\" by Cockerell in 1896. Another example is the \"New England Fairy Bee\" (*Perdita novae-angliae*), which was described in 1907. This indicates the name \"fairy bee\" was already in use by entomologists at that time.\n\nSpecific species within the genus also have their own distinct common names, such as the \"Mojave poppy bee\" (*Perdita meconis*) and the \"euphorb mini-fairy bee\" (*Perdita minima*). Nevertheless, \"fairy bee\" remains the generally accepted common name for the genus as a whole.\n\n<<<fairy bee, 1896>>>"
