The one-step transformation is given by $p_i(t+1) = \frac{1}{2}(p_{i-1}(t) + p_{i+1}(t))$. The transition matrix is a circulant matrix with non-zero elements $A_{i,i+1} = A_{i,i-1} = 1/2$. The eigenvectors are $v_n$ with components $v_{n,j} = e^{ijk_n}$ for $k_n = 2\pi n/N$, and the eigenvalues are $\lambda_n = \cos(2\pi n/N)$. The rate of relaxation is determined by the second-largest eigenvalue, $\lambda_1 = \cos(2\pi/N)$.
