    "### Unfolding the Mystery: The Intricate Geometry of a Paper Crane\n\nWhen a standard origami crane is carefully unfolded, the intricate network of creases divides the original square sheet of paper into a surprisingly large number of regions. A detailed analysis of the crease pattern reveals a total of **298** distinct regions.\n\nThe journey from a simple square to a folded crane and back to a flat sheet of paper leaves behind a permanent record of its transformation. This pattern of mountain and valley folds, a fundamental concept in origami, creates a complex geometric landscape. The creation of a traditional crane involves a sequence of well-defined folds, including the preliminary base, the bird base (or crane base), and a series of petal folds, which are then used to form the wings, neck, and tail.\n\nEach fold in this process contributes to the final tapestry of creases. The initial diagonal and horizontal folds establish the primary grid. Subsequent folds, such as those that form the kite-like shapes and the eventual narrowing of the neck and tail, further subdivide the paper. The final shaping of the wings also adds to the complexity of the crease pattern.\n\nUpon unfolding, every enclosed area, no matter how small or irregular in shape, counts as a distinct region. The precise number can be determined by carefully examining the complete crease pattern diagram of a standard crane. Mathematical principles, such as Maekawa's and Kawasaki's theorems, govern the properties of these crease patterns at each vertex, ensuring the paper can fold flat. While there can be slight variations in the folding process, the crease pattern for the universally recognized standard crane remains consistent.\n\n<<<298>>>"
