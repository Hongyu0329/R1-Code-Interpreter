Based on the evidence, CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 would be predicted to exhibit an enhanced and more sustained release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ and TNF-α, upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without it. This is due to IL-15's role in fostering a less differentiated, more persistent, and functionally robust T cell phenotype. This heightened cytokine production contributes to greater anti-tumor activity but also increases the risk of cytokine-related toxicities.
