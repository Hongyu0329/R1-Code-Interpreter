    "During World War II, the largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940, was the steam tanker **Monique**.\n\nThe *Monique*, with a tonnage of 7,011 gross register tons (GRT), was sunk on June 22, 1940, in the Bay of Biscay by the German submarine U-65. The ship was en route from Haifa to Le Havre, carrying a cargo of 10,000 tons of crude oil. The U-boat attack caused the tanker to be engulfed in burning oil and break in two before sinking.\n\nOther notable French ships sunk by U-boats during this period include the steam merchant *Vermont* (5,186 GRT) and the steamer *PLM 15* (3,754 GRT). The French submarine *Doris* (525 tons) was also sunk by a U-boat in May 1940.\n\n<<<Monique>>>"
