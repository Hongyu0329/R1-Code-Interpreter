    "In the empty space outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body of mass $M$, the geometry of spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, which are components of the affine connection, are derived from the derivatives of the metric tensor. Due to the spherical symmetry and the static nature of the Schwarzschild metric, many of the Christoffel symbols are zero. However, because of the spacetime curvature and the use of a curvilinear coordinate system (spherical coordinates), several Christoffel symbols are non-zero.\n\nThe non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric are:\n\n*   $\\Gamma^t_{tr} = \\Gamma^t_{rt} = \\frac{GM}{r(r-2GM)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{tt} = \\frac{GM(r-2GM)}{r^3}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{rr} = -\\frac{GM}{r(r-2GM)}$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\theta\\theta} = -(r-2GM)$\n*   $\\Gamma^r_{\\phi\\phi} = -(r-2GM)\\sin^2\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{r\\theta} = \\Gamma^\\theta_{\\theta r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\theta_{\\phi\\phi} = -\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{r\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi r} = \\frac{1}{r}$\n*   $\\Gamma^\\phi_{\\theta\\phi} = \\Gamma^\\phi_{\\phi\\theta} = \\cot\\theta$\n\nWhen counting the unique non-zero Christoffel symbols, we consider the symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. Taking this symmetry into account, there are 9 distinct non-zero Christoffel symbols. Some sources may report a higher number by not combining the symmetric components in their count.\n\n<<<9>>>"
