The second coefficient in the heat kernel expansion of the spectral action for a massless gauged Dirac spinor field, integrated over a four-dimensional manifold M, is given by the integral of a local density `a₂(x)`. The general form of this density includes terms involving the curvature of the spacetime and the field strength of the gauge field. Specifically, for a Dirac operator `D` coupled to a gauge potential `A` on a Riemannian manifold, the square of the operator `D²` is of the form `D² = - (∇²I + E)`, where `∇` is the covariant derivative including the spin and gauge connections, and `E` is a potential term. The second heat kernel coefficient `a₂(x)` for this operator has the general form: `a₂(x) = tr( (1/6) R I + E )`, where `R` is the scalar curvature and the trace is over the spinor and gauge indices. For the specific case of a massless gauged Dirac spinor, after including the contributions from the field strength, the expression for the integrand of the `a₂` coefficient is proportional to `(c₁ R + c₂ F_μν F^μν)`, where `c₁` and `c₂` are numerical constants and `F_μν` is the gauge field strength. A commonly cited result for the `a₂` coefficient of the squared Dirac operator `D²` on a 4-dimensional manifold is `a₂(x) = (1/(4π)²) * ( (N/3)R - tr(F_μν F^μν)/2 )`, where N is the number of spinor components.
