    "In Major League Baseball, there are two types of Triple Crowns a player can achieve: one for batters and one for pitchers. The number of winners differs significantly depending on whether only the American and National Leagues are considered or if the now-recognized Negro Leagues are also included.\n\nA batter wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs) in the same season.
