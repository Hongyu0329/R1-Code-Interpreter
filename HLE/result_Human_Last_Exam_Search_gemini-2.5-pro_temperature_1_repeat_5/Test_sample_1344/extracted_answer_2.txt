An optimal single-site catalyst would feature a zirconium (Zr) or hafnium (Hf) metal center, supported on sulfated alumina (AlS). The catalyst would be functionalized with a robust ancillary ligand, such as a constrained-geometry "scorpionate" or a bulky N,N-bidentate ligand, and reactive alkyl ligands (e.g., neopentyl). The dual functionality is achieved by switching the reaction conditions: in the presence of an olefin monomer and a cocatalyst (like MAO), the system acts as a polymerization catalyst, while in the presence of hydrogen gas at elevated temperatures, it switches to a hydrogenolysis catalyst for polyolefin degradation.
