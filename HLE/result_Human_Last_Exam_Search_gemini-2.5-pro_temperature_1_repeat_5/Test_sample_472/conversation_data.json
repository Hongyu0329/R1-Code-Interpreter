    "The line \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\" is from the Roman playwright Terence's comedy, *Adelphoe* (The Brothers). The meter is the iambic senarius, a line consisting of six iambic feet (an iamb being a short syllable followed by a long one: S L). However, Roman comedy allows for substitutions, where a long syllable can be replaced by two short ones (a resolution) or a short syllable can sometimes be replaced by a long one (substitution), which can make scansion complex.\n\nHere is the scansion of the line:\n\net ti-bi be-ne es-se so-li quom si-bi sit ma-le\n\nApplying the rules of Latin scansion:\n\n*   **et**: Long by position (followed by two consonants, 't' and 'b').\n*   **ti-bi**: The 'i' in *tibi* is short.\n*   **be-ne**: Both 'e's are short.\n*   **es-se**: The first syllable 'es' is long by position (closed by 's'). The final 'e' is short.\n*   **so-li**: The 'o' and 'i' are both long by nature.\n*   **quom**: An old spelling of *cum*. It is long by position before the consonant 's' of *sibi*.\n*   **si-bi**: Both 'i's are short.\n*   **sit**: Long by position (closed by 't').\n*   **ma-le**: The 'a' is short and the final 'e' is long.\n\nThis gives the following pattern, divided into iambic feet with substitutions:\n\nL S | S S S L | S L | L L | S S L | S L\n\nTo fit the iambic senarius meter, resolutions and substitutions are common in Plautus and Terence. The second foot is resolved into a tribrach (S S S), and the fourth foot is a spondee (L L).\n\n<<<L S S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
