    "The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, of a vector field is a topological property that describes how the field lines are knotted and linked in three-dimensional space. While the Whitehead formula provides a formal method for its calculation via integration, the Hopf charge can often be determined more intuitively by examining the linking number of preimages.\n\nA preimage is the set of all points in the 3D space `(x, y, z)` that are mapped to a single point on the target sphere of the vector field `(nx, ny, nz)`. The Hopf charge is equal to the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct points on this sphere.\n\nIn the given vector field:\n*   The vector `(nx, ny, nz)` is always a unit vector, so it maps any point in 3D space to a point on the surface of a unit sphere (S²).\n*   The field is defined to be uniform at infinity. As the distance from the origin goes to infinity, `r2` approaches infinity, causing `G` to approach 0. This results in the vector field `(nx, ny, nz)` pointing to `(0, 0, 1)`, the \"north pole\" of the sphere.\n*   The preimage of the \"south pole\" `(0, 0, -1)` corresponds to the points where `G = PI`. This occurs when `r2 = 0`, which defines a circle in the xy-plane with the equation `x² + y² = 0.5` and `z = 0`.\n\nTo find the Hopf charge, we can determine the linking number of the preimages of two points on the sphere, for example, the south pole and an equatorial point like `(1, 0, 0)`.\n\n1.  **Preimage of the South Pole**: As established, this is the circle `C1` defined by `x² + y² = 0.5, z = 0`.\n2.  **Preimage of the point (1, 0, 0)**: This requires `f = atan2(y, x) = 0` and `G = PI/2`. The condition `f=0` implies `y=0` and `x>0`. The condition `G = PI/2` implies `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`. This equation describes a closed loop, `C2`, in the right-half of the xz-plane.\n\nThe circle `C1` pierces the xz-plane at the point `(1/√2, 0, 0)`. The loop `C2` lies entirely in the xz-plane and encloses this exact point. Therefore, the loop `C2` is linked exactly once with the circle `C1`.\n\nSince the linking number of these two preimages is 1, the Hopf charge of the given vector field is 1. This configuration is a classic example of a hopfion of charge 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
