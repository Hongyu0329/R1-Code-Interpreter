    "Without the influence of the Norse language following their invasions and settlement in England, the Modern English word for \"sister\" would most likely be **Suster**.\n\nThe modern word \"sister\" is a blend of Old English and Old Norse. The original Old English word for a female sibling was *sweostor* (pronounced roughly \"swe-oster\"), with regional variations such as *swuster*. This term belongs to the same ancient Proto-Germanic root (*swestr-) as the German *Schwester* and the Dutch *zuster*.\n\nDuring the Viking Age, contact between the Anglo-Saxons and Norse settlers led to the introduction of many Old Norse words into the English language. The Old Norse word for sister was *systir*.\n\nOver time, the Old Norse *systir* influenced the native Old English term. In Middle English, forms like *suster* existed, which was a natural evolution of the Old English *swuster*. However, the version with \"i\" derived from *systir* eventually became the standard form we use today.\n\nIf the Norse had never interacted with the Anglo-Saxons, the Old English *sweostor* or *swuster* would have followed a purely English linguistic path. Its Middle English form, *suster*, would likely have evolved into the Modern English **Suster**, with the \"u\" pronounced like the vowel in \"cup\".\n\n<<<Suster>>>"
