    "The full name of the person \"HE\" refers to is Arthur Schopenhauer.\n\nThis conclusion is based on a detailed analysis of the user's prompt, which contains several key philosophical concepts that point directly to Schopenhauer's main work, *The World as Will and Representation*.\n\n*   **Prohibition against representation:** Schopenhauer's central thesis is that the world we experience is a \"representation\" (*Vorstellung*)—a mental construct—and not the world as it truly is in itself. His philosophy is built on this concept, thus \"naturally ignoring\" a religious \"prohibition against representation\" by making it the very fabric of his system.\n*   **Another's material possessions:** This phrase alludes to the commandment against coveting. Schopenhauer's philosophy identifies the ultimate reality, the \"thing-in-itself,\" as the \"Will\"—a blind, ceaseless, striving impulse. In humans, this manifests as constant desire and craving, which is the root of all suffering and a philosophical parallel to covetousness.\n*   **At the end of HIS work:** *The World as Will and Representation* is structured in four books. The final book is dedicated to ethics, where Schopenhauer discusses the path to salvation from suffering through the denial of the \"will-to-live.\" This involves overcoming the endless desires (coveting) that the Will produces, thus addressing the issue of \"another's material possessions\" at the work's conclusion.\n\nThe name \"Veronika Campan\" mentioned in the prompt does not correspond to any known scholar of Schopenhauer and appears to be an error. The philosophical clues provided are strong enough to identify Arthur Schopenhauer as the subject of the interpretation.\n\n<<<Arthur Schopenhauer>>>"
