    "The sound produced by human muscle twitches is of a very low frequency. Research indicates that these sounds are predominantly below 50 Hz, with slow-twitch fibers generating sounds between 10 to 30 Hz and fast-twitch fibers producing sounds from 30 to 70 Hz. A significant portion of the sound power from a muscle twitch is even below 20 Hz.\n\nTo determine which animal might hear such a sound, we must compare these frequencies to the hearing ranges of the animals listed:\n\n*   **Human:** The typical human hearing range is 20 to 20,000 Hz. Since a large component of muscle twitch sounds falls below this range, it is unlikely a human could hear them.\n*   **Dog:** A dog's hearing range is approximately 40 or 67 Hz to 45,000 Hz, meaning they are not equipped to hear the very low frequencies of a muscle twitch.\n*   **Bat:** Bats are known for their high-frequency hearing, which can extend up to 200,000 Hz. Their lower limit of hearing is around 1,000 Hz, far above the frequency of muscle sounds.\n*   **Herring:** This fish is considered a hearing specialist. While their optimal hearing range is higher, some species of herring can detect infrasonic sounds as low as 5 Hz. This capability would allow them to perceive the low-frequency vibrations from a muscle twitch.\n*   **Whale:** Baleen whales, in particular, are adapted to hear very low-frequency sounds. Their hearing can extend down to as low as 7 Hz, which overlaps with the frequencies produced by muscle contractions.\n\nBoth herring and certain whales have hearing ranges that could detect human muscle twitches. However, herring are specifically noted as \"hearing specialists\" with a documented ability to detect sound in the very low-frequency spectrum where muscle twitch sounds occur.\n\n<<<C>>>"
