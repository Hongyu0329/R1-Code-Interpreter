    "Final Answer:\nBy applying the principles of large deviation theory, specifically the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems, one can derive the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of a photon gas, which is a system of bosons. This approach provides a statistical basis for the well-known laws of black-body radiation, such as Planck's law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, and yields the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy.\n\n### Equilibrium from Large Deviation Principles\n\nIn the framework of large deviation theory, a system's equilibrium state corresponds to the most probable macroscopic state, which is the state with the minimum large deviation rate function. For a system in contact with a heat bath, this corresponds to maximizing the entropy.\n\n*   **Boltzmann-Sanov Theorem and Entropy:** The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem is concerned with the large deviations of the empirical measure of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. When applied to the spatial distribution of photons in a cavity, it allows for the calculation of the probability of observing a particular macroscopic distribution. The rate function in Sanov's theorem is the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence). At equilibrium, the system will be found in the state that maximizes the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy, which is proportional to the logarithm of the probability of that spatial distribution. This maximization, subject to physical constraints, leads to the equilibrium entropy of the photon gas.\n\n*   **Cramer-Chernoff Theorem and Mean Energy:** The Cramer-Chernoff theorem deals with the large deviations of the sum of i.i.d. random variables. This theorem is applied to the energy distribution of the photons. By considering the total energy of the photon gas as a sum of the energies of individual photons, the Cramer-Chernoff theorem provides the probability of large fluctuations from the mean energy. The theorem utilizes the moment-generating function, which in statistical mechanics is analogous to the partition function. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the Cramer-Chernoff large deviation function reaches its minimum value, which corresponds to the system's mean energy.\n\nFor a photon gas, the number of particles is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero. This is a crucial constraint in the derivation.\n\n### Equilibrium Values for a Photon Gas (Bose Case)\n\nThe application of these large deviation theorems ultimately reproduces the established results for a photon gas in thermal equilibrium at a temperature T, enclosed in a volume V.\n\n#### **Mean Energy**\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy (U) of the photon gas, a result consistent with the Stefan-Boltzmann law, is found to be proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature. The derivation using the Cramer-Chernoff theorem confirms the result obtained from integrating Planck's distribution law. The mean energy is given by:\n\n*U* = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15c³h³) * V * T⁴\n\nwhere:\n*   *k* is the Boltzmann constant\n*   *c* is the speed of light\n*   *h* is the Planck constant\n*   *V* is the volume\n*   *T* is the absolute temperature\n\nThis demonstrates that the energy density (*U*/*V*) of a photon gas is solely a function of temperature.\n\n#### **Entropy**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy (S) of the photon gas is determined through the maximization of the Boltzmann-Sanov relative entropy. The resulting value is proportional to the volume and the cube of the absolute temperature:\n\n*S* = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45c³h³) * V * T³\n\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the mean energy as *S* = (4/3) * (*U*/T). The entropy per photon is independent of temperature, having a value of approximately 3.6*k*. The constant volume heat capacity of a photon gas approaches zero as the temperature approaches absolute zero, in accordance with the third law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn summary, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff large deviation theorems provide a rigorous mathematical framework to derive the equilibrium properties of a photon gas, confirming the results of Bose-Einstein statistics and Planck's theory of black-body radiation.\n\n<<<\n**Mean Energy (U):**\n*U* = (8π⁵k⁴ / 15c³h³) * V * T⁴\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n*S* = (32π⁵k⁴ / 45c³h³) * V * T³\n>>>"
