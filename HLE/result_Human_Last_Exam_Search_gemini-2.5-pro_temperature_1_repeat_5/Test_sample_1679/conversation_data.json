    "I have a list of Best Picture winners. Now I need to determine which of these, particularly the early ones, might have depicted a Luxor Obelisk. The search results mention that the Luxor Obelisks are located in Luxor, Egypt, and Paris, France. I will start by searching for early Best Picture winners that are set in or feature scenes in Paris or Egypt. I will also investigate films that have themes related to ancient Egypt, as they might depict the obelisk in its original location. The search results for \"early best picture winners that depict a Luxor Obelisk\" were not specific, so I will need to conduct more targeted searches.I have reviewed the plot summaries of the initial Best Picture winners and none of them appear to be set in Paris or Egypt. Specifically, *The Broadway Melody* is set in New York, *All Quiet on the Western Front* is set on the Western Front in France and Germany during World War I, *Cimarron* is set in Oklahoma, *Grand Hotel* is set in Berlin, and *Cavalcade* is set in London. The search for \"early best picture winners set in Paris\" did not yield immediate results for the very first winners. Therefore, I need to continue my investigation by examining later winners and specifically looking for films set in Paris or with Egyptian themes.I have gathered information about several Best Picture winners that were set in Paris, including \"An American in Paris\" and \"Gigi\". I've also looked into films with Egyptian themes or connections. The search results for \"An American in Paris\" mention a scene at the Place de la Concorde, which is where a Luxor Obelisk is located. Some sources state the film was shot on Hollywood backlots, while others say it was partially filmed in Paris. There's a specific mention of a model of the Place de la Concorde fountain being used, and a picture of Gene Kelly on a set \"suggesting\" the Place de la Concorde. To be certain, I need to verify if the actual Luxor Obelisk is visible in the final cut of \"An American in Paris\". For \"Gigi,\" while it was filmed in Paris, there is no mention of the Place de la Concorde. I also haven't found any Best Picture winners with clear on-screen depictions of the Luxor Obelisk in Egypt. Therefore, my next step is to focus on \"An American in Paris\" and confirm the on-screen presence of the obelisk.I've gathered conflicting information regarding the filming of \"An American in Paris\" and its depiction of the Place de la Concorde. Some sources say it was filmed on Hollywood backlots, while others mention location shooting in Paris. There are specific mentions of a set \"suggesting\" the Place de la Concorde and the use of a model of the fountain. To definitively answer the user's question, I need to find visual evidence from the film itself to confirm whether the actual Luxor Obelisk is shown. My next step will be to search for images or clips from the movie that specifically show the Place de la Concorde sequence. I will also continue to investigate other early Best Picture winners in parallel, in case my current lead with \"An American in Paris\" turns out to be a dead end. I will also broaden my search to include any Best Picture winner that might have even a brief, establishing shot of Paris that could include the obelisk.I've gathered more information about *An American in Paris* and its connection to the Place de la Concorde. The search results confirm that the film features a ballet sequence set in a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde, inspired by the painter Raoul Dufy. There are mentions of a set \"suggesting\" the location and the use of a model of the fountain. However, it's also stated that much of the film was shot on Hollywood backlots, and a search for actual stills from the movie showing the Place de la Concorde has yielded images that are clearly set reproductions. I have not found a definitive image or clip from the final film that shows the real Luxor Obelisk. The evidence points towards the on-screen depiction being a set. Therefore, I need to shift my focus to other Best Picture winners that might have authentic Parisian scenes. I will investigate *Gigi* and *Around the World in 80 Days (1956)* more closely to see if they feature the Place de la Concorde. I will also do a broader search for any other Best Picture winners with confirmed Parisian filming locations.I have gathered some crucial information. For *An American in Paris*, while there are scenes related to the Place de la Concorde, the evidence strongly suggests these were filmed on a set and not on location, meaning the actual Luxor Obelisk is likely not depicted. My investigation into *Gigi* has also not yielded any evidence of the Place de la Concorde being a filming location. However, the search results for *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) indicate that while many scenes were shot on sets, there was some location filming in Paris. I need to verify if any of these Parisian scenes feature the Place de la Concorde. I also found that *Midnight in Paris* did film at the Place de la Concorde, but this film was released in 2011 and is therefore a much later Best Picture winner. To definitively answer the user's question, I need to focus on confirming whether *Around the World in 80 Days* (1956) shows the Luxor Obelisk. If not, I will need to broaden my search again to other Best Picture winners that were filmed in Paris."
