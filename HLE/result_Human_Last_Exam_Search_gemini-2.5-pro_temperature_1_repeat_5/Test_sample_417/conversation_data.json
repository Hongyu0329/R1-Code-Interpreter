    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, a detailed analysis of the molecule's structure and symmetry is required.\n\nThe molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core with three identical chiral substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5 via methylene (-CH2-) bridges. The overall molecule possesses a C3 axis of symmetry, which means the three large substituents are chemically equivalent in the NMR spectrum. Therefore, we only need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in one of the three identical arms of the molecule.\n\nAn arm consists of the central core's repeating unit and one substituent. Let's break down the proton environments:\n\n**1. Central Core Protons:**\n*   **Ring Methyl Groups (-CH3):** The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. This gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Methylene Bridge Protons (-CH2-):** The three methylene groups are equivalent by the same C3 symmetry. However, each methylene group links an achiral benzene ring to a chiral substituent. This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic, and thus chemically non-equivalent. They will have different chemical shifts, resulting in **2 signals**.\n\n**2. Camphor-Derived Substituent Protons:**\nThe substituent is a complex, chiral, and rigid bicyclic system derived from camphor. The IUPAC name, (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazole, describes this structure. Due to the lack of internal symmetry within this group, all protons are in unique chemical environments unless accidental equivalence occurs. We will count the distinct proton types in one of these units:\n*   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (C3-H):** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring. This gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Bridgehead Proton (C4-H):** The proton on the bridgehead of the bicyclic system is unique. This gives **1 signal**.\n*   **Bicyclic Methylene Protons (C5-H2 and C6-H2):** There are two methylene groups on the six-membered ring of the camphor skeleton. The two protons (endo and exo) on the C5 carbon are diastereotopic, and so are the two protons on the C6 carbon. All four of these protons (C5-endo, C5-exo, C6-endo, C6-exo) are in different chemical environments. This results in **4 signals**.\n*   **Methyl Group Protons (-CH3):**\n    *   There is one methyl group on the C7 bridgehead. This gives **1 signal**.\n    *   There are two methyl groups on the C8 carbon (the \"methano\" bridge). These geminal methyl groups are diastereotopic because of the overall chirality of the molecule. This results in **2 signals**.\n\n**Total Number of Peaks:**\nSumming the signals from all the non-equivalent protons:\n*   From the core: 1 (Ar-CH3) + 2 (-CH2-) = 3 signals\n*   From one substituent: 1 (Pyrazole-H) + 1 (Bridgehead-H) + 4 (CH2 protons) + 1 (C7-CH3) + 2 (gem-CH3) = 9 signals\n\nTotal signals = 3 + 9 = 12.\n\nTherefore, a total of 12 peaks are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<H>>>"
