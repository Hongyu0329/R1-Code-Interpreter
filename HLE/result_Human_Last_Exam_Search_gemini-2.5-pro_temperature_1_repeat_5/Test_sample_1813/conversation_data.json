    "Based on the available research, the generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is a solution to the Diophantine equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + xy + xz + yz = 6xyz\\). These numbers can be indexed by rational numbers \\(p/q\\), and their computation is linked to the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\) through a complex combinatorial method involving \"snake graphs\".\n\nSpecifically, the paper \"A Generalization of Markov Numbers\" by E. Banaian and A. Sen explains that to find the value of \\(m_{p/q}\\), one must first determine a \"sign sequence\" based on the fraction, then derive a new continued fraction from this sequence, and finally compute the numerator (also known as the continuant) of this new continued fraction. This process, however, is intricate and a direct, simple formula for an arbitrary \\(p/q\\) is not provided in the surveyed literature.\n\nThe search results contain the initial members of the tree of solutions for the generalized Markov equation, such as 1, 2, 5, 18, and 37, but do not provide a mapping of which number corresponds to the specific fraction 4/7 or a table containing this value.\n\nDue to the complexity of the algorithm and the absence of a pre-computed value for \\( m_{4/7} \\) in the provided search results, it is not possible to determine the integer value of this specific generalized Markov number. Consequently, its continued fraction cannot be computed.\n\n<<<Cannot be determined from the provided information.>>>"
