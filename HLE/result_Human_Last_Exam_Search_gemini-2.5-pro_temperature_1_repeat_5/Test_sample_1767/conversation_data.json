    "When two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1, are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, they form a combined system. The Chern number, a topological invariant, is an additive quantity in such a configuration.\n\nThe Hall conductance of a single Chern insulator is quantized and is directly proportional to its Chern number (C), given by the formula G_xy = C * (e^2/h), where 'e' is the elementary charge and 'h' is Planck's constant. When two such insulators are connected in parallel, their Hall conductances add up.\n\nTherefore, the total Hall conductance of the combined system is the sum of the individual conductances:\nG_total = G_1 + G_2 = 1 * (e^2/h) + 1 * (e^2/h) = 2 * (e^2/h).\n\nThis corresponds to a total Chern number for the combined system. The number of chiral edge states on the outer boundary of the entire system will be equal to this total Chern number. While the interface between the two identical Chern insulators will not host any net chiral edge states (since the difference in their Chern numbers is |1-1| = 0), the overall system behaves as a single Chern insulator with a Chern number that is the sum of its parts.\n\nThus, the Chern number of the junction is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
