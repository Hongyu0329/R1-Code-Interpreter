    "The Wittig reaction is a chemical process that converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes using a phosphonium ylide. The reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane results in the formation of an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\n**Reactants:**\n*   **Aldehyde:** Pivalaldehyde, which has the structure (CH₃)₃CCHO.\n*   **Wittig Reagent:** The ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ5-phosphane, has the structure Ph₃P=CHCH₂(C₆H₄Cl). This is classified as an unstabilized ylide because the carbon bearing the negative charge in the resonance structure is not adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group.\n\n**Product Formation:**\nThe core of the Wittig reaction involves the replacement of the carbon-oxygen double bond of the aldehyde with a carbon-carbon double bond from the ylide. The oxygen atom from pivalaldehyde and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide are eliminated to form triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThe resulting alkene product has the following structure:\n(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl)\n\nThe systematic IUPAC name for this product is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n**Stereochemistry:**\nThe stereochemistry of the resulting alkene is influenced by the nature of the ylide. Reactions involving unstabilized ylides, such as the one in this case, typically yield the (Z)-alkene as the major product. This is due to the reaction proceeding under kinetic control. Therefore, the primary product formed is **(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n\n<<<**(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**>>>"
