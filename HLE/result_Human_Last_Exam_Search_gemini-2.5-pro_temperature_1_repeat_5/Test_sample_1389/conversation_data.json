    "For an all-or-nothing vaccine, 1-incidence rate ratio will correctly estimate the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why:\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine confers complete protection to a certain percentage of the vaccinated population, while the rest receive no protection at all. For instance, a vaccine with 80% efficacy would make 80% of recipients fully immune, and the other 20% would remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy:** This measures the reduction in risk of infection from a single exposure. In an all-or-nothing model, the successfully vaccinated individuals have a 0% chance of infection per exposure, while the unsuccessfully vaccinated have the same risk as unvaccinated individuals. The average reduction in risk across all vaccinated individuals, therefore, equals the proportion of people who were successfully protected.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the incidence rate of the disease in the vaccinated group divided by the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group. Vaccine efficacy (VE) is commonly calculated as 1 - IRR.\n*   **The Connection:** In the all-or-nothing scenario, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group is driven entirely by the fraction of the population that did not receive protection. The protected group contributes zero cases. Therefore, the overall incidence rate in the vaccinated group is reduced by a proportion equal to the fraction of people who are fully protected. This means that the calculation for vaccine efficacy using the incidence rate ratio (1 - IRR) will yield a value identical to the per-exposure efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
