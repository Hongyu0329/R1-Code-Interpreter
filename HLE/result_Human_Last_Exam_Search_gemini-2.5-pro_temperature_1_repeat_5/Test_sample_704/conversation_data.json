    "On Isaac Newton's color circle, the musical note that corresponds to the range between green (the combination of yellow and blue) and blue itself is G.\n\nIn the 17th century, Isaac Newton proposed a correlation between the seven colors of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale. He arranged these colors on a wheel and assigned them to the notes of the Dorian mode, which is a musical scale that can be played on the white keys of a piano starting from D.\n\nIn this system, the colors are allocated as follows:\n*   **Red** corresponds to the note **D**\n*   **Orange** corresponds to **E**\n*   **Yellow** corresponds to **F**\n*   **Green** corresponds to **G**\n*   **Blue** corresponds to **A**\n*   **Indigo** corresponds to **B**\n*   **Violet** corresponds to **C**\n\nThe color produced by combining yellow and blue is green. According to Newton's mapping, green is associated with the musical note G, and blue is associated with the note A. Therefore, the range between green and blue begins with the note G.\n\n<<<G>>>"
