    "The parametric curve is defined in two parts:\n*   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$. This represents the upper half of a unit circle, as $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ and for this interval of $t$, $y \\ge 0$.\n*   For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = 5\\sin t$. This corresponds to the lower half of an ellipse centered at the origin, since $\\frac{x^2}{1^2} + \\frac{y^2}{5^2} = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$ and for this interval of $t$, $y < 0$.\n\nTo find the smallest square that can outcircle the figure, we need to determine the maximum and minimum values of the x and y coordinates.\n\n**For the x-coordinate:**\nThe equation for x is $x = \\cos t$ for the entire range of $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\nThe maximum value of $\\cos t$ is 1.\nThe minimum value of $\\cos t$ is -1.\nTherefore, the width of the figure is $1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n**For the y-coordinate:**\nFor $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin t$. The maximum value of $\\sin t$ in this interval is 1 (at $t=\\pi/2$) and the minimum is 0.\nFor $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin t$. The minimum value of $\\sin t$ in this interval is -1 (at $t=3\\pi/2$), so the minimum value for y is $5 \\times (-1) = -5$. The maximum value is approaching 0.\nCombining both intervals, the maximum value of y is 1 and the minimum value is -5.\nTherefore, the height of the figure is $1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\nThe smallest square that can circumscribe this figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the two dimensions (width and height). The side length must be $\\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\nThe area of this square is the side length squared.\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>The parametric curve is defined in two parts:\n*   For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, the equations are $x = \\cos t$ and $y = \\sin t$.
