    "Glycolysis is the metabolic process that breaks down a six-carbon glucose molecule into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. This process consists of ten steps and occurs in the cytoplasm of cells. Critically, no carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced during the reactions of glycolysis. All six carbon atoms from the original glucose molecule are present in the two resulting pyruvate molecules.\n\nTherefore, if a molecule of 1,4-13C glucose goes through the process of glycolysis, no CO2 is released, and consequently, no 13C-labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n\nWhile subsequent processes in cellular respiration, such as the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (pyruvate decarboxylation) and the Krebs cycle, do release CO2, these are separate pathways from glycolysis.\n\nIn the step immediately following glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, the carboxyl group of pyruvate is removed and released as CO2. Tracing the labeled carbons from 1,4-13C glucose shows that the C4 of glucose becomes the carboxyl carbon (C1) of one of the pyruvate molecules. This specific pyruvate would then release one molecule of 13C-labeled CO2 during pyruvate decarboxylation. The C1 of glucose becomes the methyl carbon (C3) of the other pyruvate molecule, and this label is not released as CO2 in this step.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about the process of glycolysis, during which no decarboxylation occurs.\n\n<<<0>>>"
