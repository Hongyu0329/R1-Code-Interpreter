    "The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus is likely a misremembered scene from the 1993 film **_Carlito's Way_**, which received a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nIn _Carlito's Way_, the character Lalin (played by Viggo Mortensen), a wheelchair-bound informant, has a pivotal and tense meeting with the protagonist, Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino). While the scene does not take place on a bus and the specific words \"Thank you\" are not the trigger, this interaction is a crucial turning point that contributes to the unfolding tragedy and Carlito's ultimate fate. The film, directed by Brian De Palma, was lauded for its performances, with Sean Penn receiving a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The movie's central theme revolves around the idea that one's past and associations are inescapable, ultimately sealing Carlito's destiny despite his efforts to reform.\n\nIt is possible that the specific details of the bus and the phrase \"Thank you\" are being conflated with another film, but the core elements of a character's sealed fate in a critically acclaimed crime drama strongly point to a scene within _Carlito's Way_.\n\n<<<Carlito's Way>>>"
