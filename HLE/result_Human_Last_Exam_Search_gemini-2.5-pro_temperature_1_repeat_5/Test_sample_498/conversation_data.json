The main letters in the sequence, Z, X, C, V, B, N, are the first six letters on the bottom row, read from left to right. The next letter key in this row is M.\n\nThe sequence you provided, `ZXXCVYBN`, appears to be a slight variation of this common puzzle, but the underlying pattern of the keyboard's bottom row is the most logical solution.\n\n<<<M>>>"
