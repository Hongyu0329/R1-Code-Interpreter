    "There are four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\nIn two dimensions, there are 17 distinct wallpaper groups, which are classified based on their symmetries. Each wallpaper group has an associated point group, which describes the rotational and reflectional symmetries of the pattern, leaving at least one point fixed.\n\nThe order of a point group is the number of distinct symmetry operations it contains. Due to the crystallographic restriction theorem, the only possible rotational symmetries in a wallpaper pattern are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold. This limits the possible point groups to 10 types, which are either cyclic (C_n_) or dihedral (D_n_).\n\nThe point groups with an order of 2 are C₂ and D₁.\n*   **C₂**: This group contains a single 2-fold (180°) rotation and the identity operation. Its order is 2.\n*   **D₁**: This group contains a single reflection and the identity operation. Its order is 2.\n\nThe wallpaper groups that correspond to these point groups are:\n*   **p2**: This group has a 2-fold rotational symmetry but no reflections. Its point group is C₂.\n*   **pm**: This group has parallel reflection axes but no rotations. Its point group is D₁.\n*   **pg**: This group features glide reflections but no simple rotations or reflections. The point group associated with a glide reflection is a simple reflection, making its point group D₁.\n*   **cm**: This group contains reflections and has a centered lattice, but no rotations. Its point group is D₁.\n\nThe other wallpaper groups have point groups of a higher order. For instance, groups like `pmm`, `pmg`, `pgg`, and `cmm` have a point group of D₂, which is of order 4. Groups with 3-fold, 4-fold, or 6-fold rotations also have higher-order point groups.\n\nTherefore, the four wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2 are p2, pm, pg, and cm.\n\n<<<4>>>"
