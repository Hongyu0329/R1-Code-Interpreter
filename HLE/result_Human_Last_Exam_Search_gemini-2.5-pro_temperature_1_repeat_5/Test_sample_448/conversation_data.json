    "## Oganesson and Radon: Vying for the Title of Earth's Rarest Noble Gas in 2002\n\nIn 2002, the title of the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter could be claimed by two elements, depending on the criteria: the synthetic element Oganesson and the naturally occurring, radioactive gas Radon.\n\n**Oganesson (Og)**, a synthetic element first synthesized in 2002, is by far the rarest. As it does not occur naturally, its presence on Earth is limited to the few atoms ever created in a laboratory. Therefore, its percentage of all terrestrial matter is virtually zero.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring noble gases—Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn)—**Radon (Rn)** is the rarest. Its extreme rarity is a consequence of its short half-life; its most stable isotope has a half-life of only 3.8 days. Radon is continuously generated through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust. However, due to its rapid decay, it exists in extremely minute quantities. On average, the Earth's atmosphere is composed of about 1x10⁻¹⁹% radon.\n\nFor comparison, Xenon (Xe) is often cited as the rarest of the *stable* noble gases. The Earth's atmosphere contains about 0.0000087% Xenon. While this is a tiny fraction, it is significantly more abundant than Radon.\n\nTherefore, while Oganesson was technically the rarest noble gas in 2002 due to its artificial and limited creation, among the noble gases found in nature, Radon was and remains the rarest as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
