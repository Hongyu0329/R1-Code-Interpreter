    "The trefoil knot, which is the simplest non-trivial knot, has a minimal grid number of 5. This means the smallest square grid on which a trefoil knot can be drawn is 5x5.\n\nFor the trefoil knot, there are a total of 78,296 possible grid configurations on grids with a size up to 7x7, which represent both left- and right-handed versions. However, when considering only the minimal 5x5 grids, the number of diagrams is much smaller.\n\nWhen accounting for equivalences due to translation and rotation, the number of unique minimal grid diagrams is significantly reduced. For the two types of trefoil knots (left-handed and right-handed), there is only one unique minimal grid diagram for each.\n\nTherefore, for the left-hand trefoil knot, there is only one minimal grid diagram up to translation and rotation.\n\n<<<A>>>"
