    "For the synthesis of a 100-amino-acid peptide containing the unnatural amino acid azido phenylalanine, the most helpful technique would be a combination of **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)** and **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why this hybrid approach is ideal:\n\n*   **Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the foundational method for chemically building peptide chains. In SPPS, amino acids are sequentially added to a growing chain that is anchored to an insoluble resin support. This method is well-suited for incorporating unnatural amino acids like azido phenylalanine into the peptide sequence. However, directly synthesizing a peptide as long as 100 amino acids using only SPPS is challenging due to accumulating inefficiencies at each step, which can lead to low yields and purification difficulties.\n\n*   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** To overcome the length limitations of SPPS, Native Chemical Ligation is employed. This powerful technique allows for the joining of two smaller, unprotected peptide fragments in an aqueous solution. The reaction is highly specific and forms a native peptide bond at the ligation site. For a 100-amino-acid target, one could synthesize two shorter fragments of approximately 50 amino acids each via SPPS (with the azido phenylalanine incorporated into one of them) and then ligate them together.\n\n**The Combined Strategy:**\n\n1.  **Fragment Synthesis:** The 100-amino-acid sequence is strategically divided into two or more smaller segments.\n2.  **SPPS:** Each of these smaller peptide fragments is synthesized efficiently using automated solid-phase peptide synthesis, with the azido phenylalanine included in the appropriate fragment.\n3.  **Ligation:** The purified fragments are then joined together using native chemical ligation to form the full-length 100-amino-acid peptide.\n\nThis combination of SPPS and NCL is a robust and widely used strategy for the total chemical synthesis of large peptides and small proteins, as it sidesteps the difficulties of extremely long SPPS runs while allowing for the precise incorporation of unnatural amino acids.\n\nWhile other methods exist, they are less suitable for this specific task. For instance, recombinant protein expression using an expanded genetic code can incorporate azido phenylalanine, but this is a biosynthetic method rather than a direct chemical synthesis. Liquid-phase synthesis is generally not practical for peptides of this length. Therefore, the SPPS/NCL combination provides the most effective and practical solution.\n\n<<<The most helpful technique is a combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) to create smaller peptide fragments (one containing the azido phenylalanine) followed by Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) to join these fragments into the final 100-amino-acid peptide.>>>"
