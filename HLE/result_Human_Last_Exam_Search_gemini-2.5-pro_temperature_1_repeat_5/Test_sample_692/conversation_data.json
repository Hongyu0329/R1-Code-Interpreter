    "## Earliest Recorded Date in the Americas Found on Olmec Artifact\n\nThe earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is \"3 Ajaw,\" corresponding to a day in the 260-day sacred calendar. This inscription was discovered on a ceramic cylinder seal from the Olmec site of San Andrés in Tabasco, Mexico, and is dated to approximately 650 BCE.\n\nThe artifact depicts a bird with speech scrolls emanating from its beak, leading to the glyphs that have been interpreted as the calendrical date. This discovery is significant as it pushes back the evidence for the use of a formal writing system and the sacred calendar in Mesoamerica by several centuries.\n\nThe Olmec are considered one of the earliest major Mesoamerican civilizations, flourishing in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico between approximately 1500 BCE and 400 BCE. While other examples of early Olmec writing exist, such as the Cascajal Block dating to around 900 BCE, the San Andrés seal is the oldest artifact currently known to bear a specific date.\n\nThe interpretation of the San Andrés glyphs as a date is supported by many archaeologists, who note its similarity to later, well-documented Mesoamerican writing systems like that of the Maya. Some scholars, however, maintain a degree of caution, suggesting the symbols could be purely iconographic rather than representing a true writing system. Despite this debate, the \"3 Ajaw\" inscription from San Andrés remains the most widely cited and archaeologically supported candidate for the earliest recorded date in the Americas.\n\nOther early examples of dated inscriptions from different civilizations are from a later period. For instance, the earliest known Maya calendar notation, \"7 Deer,\" was found at San Bartolo, Guatemala, and dates to between 300 and 200 BCE. Zapotec calendrical glyphs from Monte Albán have been dated to as early as 500 BCE, but the specific dating of some key artifacts, like Monument 3 from San José Mogote, has been debated and potentially placed at a later time.\n\n<<<3 Ajaw, c. 650 BCE>>>"
