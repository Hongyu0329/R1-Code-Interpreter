The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is proportional to ϵ = 4-d. The specific expression depends on the normalization of the coupling constant. For a Lagrangian with an interaction term `(g/4!)φ⁴`, the fixed point in the MS scheme is `g* = (16π²/3)ε`. For a different common normalization in statistical mechanics, the fixed point is `u* = (2/3)ε`.
