    "The leading order expression for the non-trivial fixed point coupling, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, in the ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions depends on the normalization of the coupling constant in the Lagrangian. The dimension is taken as d = 4 - ϵ, where ϵ is a small positive parameter.\n\nTwo common conventions for the interaction term in the Lagrangian lead to different expressions for the fixed point coupling u*:\n\n**1. Normalization with g/4! (Common in Quantum Field Theory):**\n\nIf the interaction term in the Lagrangian is defined as `(g/4!)φ⁴`, the one-loop beta function in the Minimal Subtraction (MS) scheme is given by:\n`β(g) = -ϵg + (3g²)/(16π²)`\n\nSetting the beta function to zero, `β(g*) = 0`, yields the non-trivial fixed point coupling:\n`g* = (16π²/3)ε`\n\n**2. Normalization with a redefined coupling u (Common in Statistical Mechanics):**\n\nOften, the coupling constant is redefined to absorb the loop integration factors. If the beta function is expressed as:\n`β(u) = ϵu - (3/2)u²`\n\nThe Wilson-Fisher fixed point is found at:\n`u* = (2/3)ε`\n\nIt is crucial to state the convention used for the coupling constant, as the numerical prefactor of ϵ depends on it. The physical predictions for critical exponents, which are calculated from the properties of the theory at this fixed point, are independent of these conventions.\n\n<<<The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in ϕ⁴ theory near four dimensions is proportional to ϵ = 4-d. The specific expression depends on the normalization of the coupling constant. For a Lagrangian with an interaction term `(g/4!)φ⁴`, the fixed point in the MS scheme is `g* = (16π²/3)ε`. For a different common normalization in statistical mechanics, the fixed point is `u* = (2/3)ε`.>>>"
