    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, it is Dr. Gibarian who is so deeply affected by the absence of Earth's natural sounds that he creates a device to simulate the rustling of leaves.\n\nAccording to the film's script, the character Snaut reveals this to the protagonist, Kris Kelvin. Snaut explains, \"the rustling of leaves. It was Gibarian's invention. So simple, like all genius.\" This indicates that Gibarian was the one who most profoundly missed this specific sound of nature.\n\nWhile other characters also long for Earth, their reactions to Gibarian's invention differ. Kris immediately adopts the idea. In contrast, Dr. Sartorius openly mocks the device but secretly keeps one hidden in his closet, suggesting a sense of shame or an unwillingness to admit his own nostalgia. Although Kris uses the device and Sartorius hides it, the initial concept and the longing it represents originate with Gibarian.\n\n<<<E>>>"
