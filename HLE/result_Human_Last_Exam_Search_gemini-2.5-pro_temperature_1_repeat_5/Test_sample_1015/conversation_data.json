    "A key distinction between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods lies in the placement of the hips. In the Vaganova method, a strong emphasis is placed on maintaining a squared torso and hips throughout the movement to ensure stability and control. The backbend should initiate from the upper spine, while the hips remain aligned.\n\nConversely, the Balanchine method often allows for a more dynamic and less rigid torso. A notable characteristic of the Balanchine style, particularly in movements like an arabesque which forms the basis of a cambré derrière, is the opening of the hip of the working leg. In the Balanchine style, the \"square\" of the body can be altered, and the hip is often considered an extension of the leg to create a longer, more dramatic line. This fundamental difference in the use of the hips affects the entire aesthetic and execution of the backbend.\n\nWhile other elements such as arm placement, speed, degree of backbend, and head placement can differ between the two styles, the foundational difference in the approach to hip placement is a primary distinguishing factor in a cambré derrière. Balanchine's general characteristics include speed and a deep backbend, and Vaganova has very specific rules for head and arm placement. However, the allowance of an open hip in the Balanchine method is a core principle that directly contrasts with the Vaganova emphasis on a stable, square torso.\n\n<<<B>>>"
