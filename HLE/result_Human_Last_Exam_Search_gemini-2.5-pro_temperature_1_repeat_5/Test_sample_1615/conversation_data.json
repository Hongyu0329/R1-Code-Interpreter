    "Let $n = 12345$ be the number of vertices in the graph $G$. The chromatic number of a graph, denoted by $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nA fundamental property of the chromatic number is that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $K_n$, where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is not a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound for the chromatic number of $G$:\n$\\chi(G) < 12345$\n$\\chi(G) \\le 12344$\n\nTo determine if 12344 is the maximum possible number of colors, we need to show that there exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices, which is not a complete graph, and has a chromatic number of 12344.\n\nConsider the following two examples of such graphs:\n\n1.  **A complete graph with one missing edge**: Let's construct a graph $G_1$ by taking the complete graph $K_{12345}$ and removing a single edge between two vertices, say $u$ and $v$. This graph is not complete by construction. Since $u$ and $v$ are not adjacent, they can be assigned the same color. All other 12343 vertices are adjacent to both $u$ and $v$ and to each other, forming a clique of size 12343. These 12343 vertices require 12343 distinct colors, none of which can be the color assigned to $u$ and $v$. Thus, a total of $12343 + 1 = 12344$ colors are needed. As a result, $\\chi(G_1) = 12344$.\n\n2.  **A disconnected graph with a large complete component**: Let's construct a graph $G_2$ as the disjoint union of a complete graph $K_{12344}$ and an isolated vertex $K_1$. This graph has $12344 + 1 = 12345$ vertices. It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex. The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. In this case, $\\chi(G_2) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\nBoth constructions yield a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph and has a chromatic number of 12344. Since we have established that the chromatic number cannot exceed 12344, this is the maximum possible value.\n\nThis conclusion is also supported by Brooks' Theorem, which states that for a connected graph $G$ that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, the chromatic number is at most the maximum degree, $\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)$. In our first example, $G_1$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G_1) = 12344$, and we found that $\\chi(G_1) = 12344$, which is consistent with the theorem.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
