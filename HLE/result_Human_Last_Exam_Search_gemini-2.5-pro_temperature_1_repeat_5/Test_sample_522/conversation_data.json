    "This puzzle involves transforming a grid of numbers based on a specific rule. By analyzing the provided input-output pairs, we can determine the transformation logic.\n\nFirst, let's represent the comma-separated strings as grids.\n\n**Analysis of Input_A to Output_A**\n\n*   **Input Grid A:**\n    ```\n    0 0 1 1 1 1  (Row 0)\n    1 2 1 1 1 1  (Row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n    ```\n*   **Output Grid A:**\n    ```\n    2 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 0 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The `2` at position `(r=1, c=1)` becomes a `0`.\n    *   The `0` at position `(r=0, c=0)` becomes a `2`.\n\n**Analysis of Input_B to Output_B**\n\n*   **Input Grid B:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Output Grid B:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 2 1 1 1 1 0\n    1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n    ```\n*   **Changes:**\n    *   The `2` at position `(r=3, c=6)` becomes a `0`.\n    *   The `0` at position `(r=2, c=7)` becomes a `2`.\n\n**Identifying the Rule**\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the starting position of the `2` and the position where the new `2` appears.\n\n1.  The original `2` at `(r, c)` is replaced with a `0`.\n2.  A `0` at a new position `(r', c')` is replaced with a `2`. We need to find the rule for `(r', c')`.\n\n*   In **Example A**: `(r, c) = (1, 1)` moves to `(r', c') = (0, 0)`. The change is `dr = -1`, `dc = -1`.\n*   In **Example B**: `(r, c) = (3, 6)` moves to `(r', c') = (2, 7)`. The change is `dr = -1`, `dc = +1`.\n\nThe change in the row (`dr`) is consistently `-1`. So, `r' = r - 1`.\n\nNow let's determine the change in the column (`dc`).\n*   In A: `c=1`, `dc=-1`.\n*   In B: `c=6`, `dc=+1`.\n\nA pattern that fits this is `dc = (-1)^c`.\n*   For A: `dc = (-1)^1 = -1`. This is correct.\n*   For B: `dc = (-1)^6 = +1`. This is also correct.\n\nSo, the rule is: The `2` at `(r, c)` moves to a `0` at `(r-1, c + (-1)^c)`, and its original location `(r, c)` becomes a `0`.\n\n**Solving for Input_C**\n\n*   **Input_C:** `'000000,011120,111111'`\n*   **Input Grid C:**\n    ```\n    0 0 0 0 0 0  (Row 0)\n    0 1 1 1 2 0  (Row 1)\n    1 1 1 1 1 1  (Row 2)\n    ```\n1.  The `2` is located at `(r=1, c=4)`.\n2.  Its position `(1, 4)` will become `0`. The second string changes from `011120` to `011100`.\n3.  Calculate the new coordinates `(r', c')`:\n    *   `r' = r - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`.\n    *   `c' = c + (-1)^c = 4 + (-1)^4 = 4 + 1 = 5`.\n4.  The new `2` will be at `(0, 5)`. The `0` at this position in the first string (`000000`) becomes a `2`, so it changes to `000002`.\n\n**Constructing the Output**\n\n*   Row 0 becomes: `000002`\n*   Row 1 becomes: `011100`\n*   Row 2 remains: `111111`\n\nCombining these gives the value for MISSING.\n\n<<<000002,011100,111111>>>"
