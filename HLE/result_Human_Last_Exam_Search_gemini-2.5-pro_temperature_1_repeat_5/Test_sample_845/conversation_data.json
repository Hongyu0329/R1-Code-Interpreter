    "The value computed between heartbeats when tracking HR and HRV using PPG is called the **inter-beat interval (IBI)**. This interval is the time period between successive heartbeats and is typically measured in milliseconds.\n\nHeart Rate Variability (HRV) is the physiological phenomenon of the variation in these time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. While the term \"R-R interval\" is also used, it specifically refers to the interval between the R-peaks in an electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform. When using photoplethysmography (PPG), the more general term \"inter-beat interval\" or IBI is used to denote the time between consecutive pulse waves. HRV analysis, therefore, relies on this beat-to-beat interval data to assess the state of the autonomic nervous system.\n\n<<<inter-beat interval (IBI)>>>"
