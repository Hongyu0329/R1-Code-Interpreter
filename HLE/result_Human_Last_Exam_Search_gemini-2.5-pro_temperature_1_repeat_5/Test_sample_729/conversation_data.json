    "The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as Q128, is a non-abelian group with a specific structure that dictates the nature of its subgroups. To determine the number of power subgroups, we must first understand the definition of a power subgroup and the structure of Q128.\n\nA power subgroup of a group G, denoted G^k, is the subgroup generated by the k-th powers of all elements in G. The structure of Q128 can be given by the presentation:\n\nQ128 = < a, x | a⁶⁴ = 1, x² = a³², xax⁻¹ = a⁻¹ >\n\nThe elements of Q128 are of the form a^i or a^i * x for 0 ≤ i < 64. To find the distinct power subgroups, we analyze the subgroups generated by the k-th powers of these elements for integer values of k.\n\nThe distinct power subgroups of Q128 are as follows:\n*   **For k=1 (and any odd k):** The subgroup G¹ is generated by all elements of G, which is G itself. Thus, the first power subgroup is Q128.\n*   **For k=2:** The subgroup G² is generated by the squares of all elements. The square of an element `a^i` is `a^(2i)`. The square of an element `a^i*x` is `(a^i*x)² = a^i * x * a^i * x = a^i * (x a^i x⁻¹) * x² = a^i * a⁻¹ * a³² = a³²`. The subgroup generated by all `a^(2i)` and `a³²` is the cyclic subgroup `<a²>`, which has an order of 32.\n*   **For k=4:** The subgroup G⁴ is generated by the 4th powers of all elements. This results in the cyclic subgroup `<a⁴>` of order 16.\n*   **For k=8:** The subgroup G⁸ is the cyclic subgroup `<a⁸>` of order 8.\n*   **For k=16:** The subgroup G¹⁶ is the cyclic subgroup `<a¹⁶>` of order 4.\n*   **For k=32:** The subgroup G³² is the cyclic subgroup `<a³²>` of order 2.\n*   **For k=64:** The subgroup G⁶⁴ is the trivial subgroup {1}, as the order of every element divides 64.\n\nFor any integer `k` that is not a power of 2, it can be expressed as `k = 2^j * m` where `m` is odd. In this case, the power subgroup G^k is equal to G^(2^j). Therefore, the list above represents all distinct power subgroups.\n\nCounting these distinct subgroups, we have:\n1.  Q128\n2.  <a²> (Cyclic group of order 32)\n3.  <a⁴> (Cyclic group of order 16)\n4.  <a⁸> (Cyclic group of order 8)\n5.  <a¹⁶> (Cyclic group of order 4)\n6.  <a³²> (Cyclic group of order 2)\n7.  {1} (The trivial subgroup)\n\nThere are a total of 7 power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n<<<7>>>"
