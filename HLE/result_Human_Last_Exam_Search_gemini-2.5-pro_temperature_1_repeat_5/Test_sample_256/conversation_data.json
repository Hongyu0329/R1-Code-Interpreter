    "The symmetry group of the best-known packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle is C_1 in Schoenflies notation.\n\nThis information is based on the comprehensive database of circle packings provided by Eckard Specht on his website, packomania.com. This website is a widely recognized resource for the best-known solutions to the circle packing problem. The tables on this site list various properties of the packings, including their symmetry groups in Schoenflies notation. For many of the packings with a large number of circles, particularly for prime numbers like 1135, the arrangement lacks any rotational or reflectional symmetry. In such cases, the symmetry group is designated as C_1, which represents a group with only the identity element (i.e., no symmetry). The entry for N=1135 on the website, following the site's convention, has an empty field for the symmetry group, which indicates C_1 symmetry.\n\n<<<C_1>>>"
