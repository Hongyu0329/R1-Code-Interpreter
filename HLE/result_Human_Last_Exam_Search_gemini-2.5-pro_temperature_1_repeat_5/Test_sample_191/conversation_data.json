    "Serum Amyloid P component (SAP) is the protein that, when its association with amyloid is disrupted, allows for macrophage engulfment of the amyloid deposits.\n\nSAP is a normal plasma protein that is universally found in amyloid deposits, where it binds to amyloid fibrils of all types. This binding has a protective effect, making the amyloid fibrils resistant to degradation and inhibiting their uptake by macrophages. Essentially, SAP coats the amyloid, rendering it \"immunologically inert\" and preventing the immune system, including macrophages, from recognizing and clearing the pathological protein aggregates.\n\nThe process that enables macrophages to engulf amyloid involves the removal or targeting of this protective SAP. A therapeutic strategy has been developed that first depletes the levels of circulating SAP in the blood using a drug called miridesap (formerly CPHPC). Following this, anti-SAP antibodies are administered. These antibodies target the SAP that remains bound to the amyloid deposits. The binding of these antibodies to SAP triggers an immune response, leading to the rapid clearance of the amyloid by macrophage-derived cells. This demonstrates that disrupting the protective shield provided by SAP is a key step in allowing macrophages to engulf and clear amyloid.\n\n<<<Serum Amyloid P component>>>"
