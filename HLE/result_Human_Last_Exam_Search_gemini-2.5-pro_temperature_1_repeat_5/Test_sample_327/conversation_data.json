    "To determine the number of red and blue pieces needed to represent the number 13/16 in red-blue-Hackenbush, we can use the binary representation of the number. The method described in publications on combinatorial game theory, such as \"Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays,\" provides a standard construction for dyadic rational numbers (fractions with a power of two in the denominator).\n\nFirst, convert the number 13/16 into its binary form.\n$ \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{0}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + 0 + \\frac{1}{16} $\nThis corresponds to the binary representation $0.1101_2$.\n\nThe construction of the Hackenbush game for a binary number of this form involves a \"stalk\" of blue edges with red edges branching off. The number of blue edges in the main stalk corresponds to the number of digits after the decimal point in the binary representation. For $0.1101_2$, there are four digits, which means we will need a stalk of four blue pieces.\n\nNext, red pieces are added based on the binary digits. For each digit `1` at the *n*th position after the decimal point, a red piece is added. These red edges connect the top of the *n*th blue edge to the ground.\n\nLet's apply this to $0.1101_2$:\n*   The first digit is **1**, so a red piece is added at the top of the first blue piece.\n*   The second digit is **1**, so a red piece is added at the top of the second blue piece.\n*   The third digit is **0**, so no red piece is added at the top of the third blue piece.\n*   The fourth digit is **1**, so a red piece is added at the top of the fourth blue piece.\n\nCounting the pieces required:\n*   **Blue pieces:** 4 (for the central stalk)\n*   **Red pieces:** 3 (for each '1' in the binary representation)\n\nTherefore, a total of 4 blue pieces and 3 red pieces are needed. The total number of pieces is 4 + 3 = 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
