The number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R=Z/8Z is not a simple, readily available integer in standard mathematical literature. The classification over rings Z/p^kZ, especially for p=2, is a complex problem that involves detailed invariants and does not typically result in a single, easily cited number of classes.
