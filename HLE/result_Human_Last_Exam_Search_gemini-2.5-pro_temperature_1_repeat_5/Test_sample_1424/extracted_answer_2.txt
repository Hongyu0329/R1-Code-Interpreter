In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0(k, ω), for a non-interacting system is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue (ϵ_k). Specifically, the functional dependence is given by G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where k is the momentum, and δ is an infinitesimal constant that enforces the correct time-ordering.
