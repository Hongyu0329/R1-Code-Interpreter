    "### The Bare Green's Function in the Feynman Path Integral Formalism and its Dependence on Single-Particle Energy Eigenvalues\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0, for a non-interacting system exhibits a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. This relationship arises from the very construction of the Green's function as the inverse of the operator that defines the quadratic part of the action in the path integral.\n\nThe starting point is the generating functional, Z_0[J], for a non-interacting system, which is expressed as a path integral over fields (e.g., Grassmann fields for fermions) weighted by the exponential of the action, S_0:\n\nZ_0[J] = ∫ Dψ* Dψ exp[i * S_0(ψ*, ψ) + i ∫ d^d x dt J*(x,t)ψ(x,t) + i ∫ d^d x dt ψ*(x,t)J(x,t)]\n\nwhere J and J* are source terms. The action for a non-interacting system, S_0, is quadratic in the fields. By transforming to momentum (k) and frequency (ω) space, this action can be diagonalized and expressed in terms of the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k. For a fermionic system, the action takes the form:\n\nS_0 = ∑_k ∫ (dω / 2π) ψ*(k,ω) (ω - ϵ_k) ψ(k,ω)\n\nThe two-point bare Green's function, G_0(k, ω), is then calculated as the functional derivative of the generating functional with respect to the source terms, or more directly, it can be identified as the inverse of the operator appearing between the fields in the action. This yields the following expression for the bare Green's function in momentum-frequency space:\n\n**G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)**\n\nHere, δ is an infinitesimal positive quantity that ensures the correct time-ordering of the Green's function, with its sign depending on the specific definition of the contour in the complex frequency plane.\n\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function, G_0, on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, ϵ_k, is that of an inverse relationship. The poles of the bare Green's function in the complex frequency plane directly correspond to the single-particle energy eigenvalues of the system. This fundamental result connects the propagator, a concept central to the path integral formalism, to the energy spectrum of the non-interacting system.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, G_0(k, ω), for a non-interacting system is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency (ω) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue (ϵ_k). Specifically, the functional dependence is given by G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ), where k is the momentum, and δ is an infinitesimal constant that enforces the correct time-ordering.>>>"
