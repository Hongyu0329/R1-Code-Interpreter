    "Pure allotropes of phosphorus can be observed in five distinct colors: white, red, black, violet, and scarlet.\n\nThe most common allotropes are white and red phosphorus. White phosphorus is a translucent, waxy solid that can appear colorless or have a yellowish hue. This yellow coloration is often due to impurities or the gradual transformation into red phosphorus.\n\nRed phosphorus is known for its characteristic deep red color, which can range from orange-red to a dark reddish-violet. It is more stable than white phosphorus.\n\nBlack phosphorus is the most thermodynamically stable form and has a black, flaky appearance, similar to graphite.\n\nViolet phosphorus, also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, is typically described as having a violet or purple color. It can also appear as dark orange or brown transparent plates with a steely blue luster that look violet in a larger mass.\n\nScarlet phosphorus is another allotrope, appearing as a scarlet-colored powder. It is considered a transitional form between other allotropes.\n\nTherefore, the different pure allotropes of phosphorus exhibit a palette of five distinct colors.\n\n<<<5>>>"
