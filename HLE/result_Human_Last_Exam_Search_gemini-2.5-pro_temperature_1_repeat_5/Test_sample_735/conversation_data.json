    "There are exactly **25** finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3.\n\nA subset *S* of a group *G* is called \"product-free\" if for all elements *a* and *b* in *S*, their product *ab* is not in *S*. Such a set is \"maximal by inclusion\" (also known as \"locally maximal\") if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in the same group.\n\nThe classification of finite groups containing such sets of size 3 was completed by C. S. Anabanti and S. Hart. In their 2015 paper, they proved that any finite group containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3 must have an order of at most 24. This confirmed that an existing list of such groups, found in groups of order up to 24, was complete.\n\nThe 25 finite groups that contain maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 3 are:\n\n**Cyclic Groups (10 groups):**\n*   C₆, C₇, C₈, C₉, C₁₀, C₁₂, C₁₄, C₁₅, C₁₈, C₂₄\n\n**Dihedral Groups (5 groups):**\n*   D₆ (isomorphic to S₃), D₈, D₁₀, D₁₂, D₁₄\n\n**Quaternion Groups (2 groups):**\n*   Q₈, Q₁₂\n\n**Direct Products of Cyclic Groups (4 groups):**\n*   C₂ × C₂ (the Klein-four group)\n*   C₂ × C₄\n*   C₂ × C₆\n*   C₃ × C₃\n\n**Other Groups (4 groups):**\n*   A₄ (the alternating group on 4 elements)\n*   S₄ (the symmetric group on 4 elements)\n*   SL(2,3) (the special linear group of 2x2 matrices over the field with 3 elements)\n*   C₃ × S₃\n\nThis complete list is derived from the work of Giudici and Hart, and confirmed by Anabanti and Hart.\n\n<<<25>>>"
