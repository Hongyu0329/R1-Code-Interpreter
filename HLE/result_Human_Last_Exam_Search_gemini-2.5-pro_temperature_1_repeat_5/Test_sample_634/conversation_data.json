    "The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the polynomial matrices:\nP1 = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\nand\nP2 = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\nis the 2x2 identity matrix, I = [,].\n\nTo find the GCRD, a method based on row-reducing a stacked matrix containing both P1 and P2 is employed. This is a standard procedure for determining the GCRD of polynomial matrices. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1.  A composite matrix is formed by stacking P1 and P2:\n    M = [[s^2 + s, -s],\n         [-s^2 - 1, s^2],\n         [s, 0],\n         [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n2.  Elementary row operations, which correspond to left-multiplication by unimodular matrices, are applied to reduce this matrix. A unimodular matrix is a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant; these matrices are invertible in the ring of polynomial matrices.\n\n3.  The following row operations are performed:\n    *   The first row is replaced by (Row 1) + s * (Row 4). This results in a zero row:\n        [s^2 + s + s(-s-1), -s + s(1)] =\n    *   The second row is replaced by (Row 2) - s^2 * (Row 4). This yields:\n        [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2(1)] = [s^3 - 1, 0]\n\n4.  The matrix is now transformed into:\n    [,\n     [s^3 - 1, 0],\n     [s, 0],\n     [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n5.  Further row operations are performed on the non-zero rows. The block consisting of [s^3 - 1, 0] and [s, 0] can be reduced. By subtracting s^2 times the third row from the second row, we get [-1, 0]. This new row can then be used to eliminate the third row, resulting in another zero row.\n\n6.  At this stage, the set of independent rows is {[-1, 0], [-s - 1, 1]}.\n\n7.  Finally, the row [-s-1, 1] is reduced using the row [-1, 0]. By adding -(s+1) times the row [-1, 0] to [-s-1, 1], we obtain.\n\n8.  The final set of non-zero rows forms the GCRD. These rows are [-1, 0] and. Thus, a GCRD is:\n    G = [[-1, 0],]\n\nSince the determinant of G is -1 (a non-zero constant), G is a unimodular matrix. Any GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix. By multiplying G by itself (G is its own inverse), we obtain the identity matrix I.\n\nTherefore, the identity matrix I is also a GCRD, and it is the conventional normalized form. When the GCRD of two polynomial matrices is the identity matrix (or any unimodular matrix), the matrices are said to be right coprime.\n\n<<<[,]>>>"
