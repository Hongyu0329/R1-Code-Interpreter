    "The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe changes in the laws of nature, applicable to both the virgin birth of Jesus and alterations in natural law at the Fall, was **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine proposed the concept of **\"seminal reasons\"** (*logoi spermatikoi* or *seminales rationes*), a term he adapted from Stoic philosophy. This framework allowed him to explain events that appear to contravene the normal course of nature without suggesting that God's will is inconsistent or that nature's order is truly broken.\n\nHere is how Augustine's terminology applies to both scenarios:\n\n*   **Miracles like the Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued that a miracle is not an event that goes *against* nature as God created it, but rather one that goes against nature *as we know it* (\"Portentum ergo fit non contra naturam, sed contra quam est nota natura\"). He posited that God, at the initial creation, embedded latent potentials or \"seminal reasons\" within the natural order. A miracle, such as the virgin birth, occurs when God chooses to activate one of these hidden potentials, bringing about an outcome that natural processes alone would not produce. This allows for a supernatural event that is still part of God's original creative plan, manifesting in a manner contrary to the usual mode of development.\n\n*   **Alterations in Natural Law at the Fall:** Augustine also used this concept to explain the lasting consequences of the Fall of Man. He taught that all of humanity was \"seminally present in the loins of Adam\". Because of this, when Adam and Eve sinned, their nature became corrupted or \"vitiated\". This corruption—a fundamental change in human nature and its relationship with the created order, leading to things like the pain of childbirth and the necessity of toiling for food—was then passed down to all subsequent generations through the process of procreation. This constitutes a change in the operation of natural law, inherited by all humanity from the moment of the Fall.\n\nWhile other theologians, notably **Benjamin B. Warfield** in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, also developed precise terminology—such as the distinction between **\"immediate creation,\" \"mediate creation,\" and \"providence\"**—to describe God's different ways of acting in the world, Augustine was the first to develop a specialized conceptual tool to address both miraculous interventions and a systemic change in nature resulting from the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
