    "Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8. To determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene, we need to find the number of these functions for each atom (carbon and hydrogen) and then multiply by the number of atoms of each type in the molecule.\n\nFor the 6-31G basis set, the notation indicates how the atomic orbitals are represented:\n*   **6**: The core atomic orbitals (in this case, the 1s orbital for carbon) are described by a single contracted Gaussian function, which is a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n*   **31**: The valence atomic orbitals are split into two basis functions (a \"double-zeta\" basis set). For carbon (1s²2s²2p²), the valence orbitals are 2s and 2p.\n    *   The inner part of the valence orbitals (2s and 2p) is represented by one contracted Gaussian function made up of 3 primitive Gaussians.\n    *   The outer part is represented by another contracted Gaussian function made up of 1 primitive Gaussian.\n\n**For each Carbon atom (C):**\n*   **1s (core):** 1 contracted Gaussian function.\n*   **2s (valence):** 2 contracted Gaussian functions (one from the '3' and one from the '1').\n*   **2p (valence):** There are three 2p orbitals (2px, 2py, 2pz). Each is a valence orbital and is therefore split into two contracted Gaussian functions. So, for the 2p orbitals, there are 3 * 2 = 6 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\nIn total, each carbon atom has 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 6 (for 2p) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n**For each Hydrogen atom (H):**\n*   A hydrogen atom only has a 1s valence orbital. The 6-31G basis set splits this valence orbital into two parts.\n*   **1s (valence):** 2 contracted Gaussian functions (one from the '3' and one from the '1').\n\n**Calculation for Toluene (C7H8):**\n*   **Carbon (C7):** 7 atoms * 9 contracted Gaussian functions/atom = 63 contracted Gaussian functions.\n*   **Hydrogen (H8):** 8 atoms * 2 contracted Gaussian functions/atom = 16 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n**Total:**\nThe total number of contracted Gaussian functions is the sum for all atoms:\n63 (from Carbon) + 16 (from Hydrogen) = 79 contracted Gaussian functions.\n\n<<<79>>>"
