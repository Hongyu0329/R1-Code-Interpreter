    "Until the late 19th century, the Pantheon in Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" was adorned with a unique architectural feature: two bell towers that were added to the ancient structure in the 17th century. These bell towers were ultimately removed by the city administration between 1881 and 1883.\n\nThe twin bell towers, often derisively referred to as \"the ass's ears\" by critics, were added in 1628 under the patronage of Pope Urban VIII. Their design is often attributed to the famous Baroque artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini. For over two and a half centuries, these towers were a prominent, if controversial, part of the Pantheon's appearance.\n\nThe decision to demolish them was part of a broader effort in the late 19th century to restore the Pantheon to its original classical appearance and to clear the surrounding piazza of various medieval and later additions. This included the removal of sheds, small shops, and other structures that had accumulated around the ancient temple over the centuries.\n\nWhile your question specified the year 1950, historical records indicate that the removal of this particular and most notable architectural feature occurred in the late 19th century. There is no evidence of a significant architectural feature being removed from the Piazza della Rotonda in or around 1950.\n\n<<<the twin bell towers, often called \"the ass's ears\", added in the 17th century and removed in the late 19th century>>>"
