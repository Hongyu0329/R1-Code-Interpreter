    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we will first determine the momentum of the electron and the uncertainty in its momentum.\n\n### Momentum of the Electron in the First Bohr Orbit\n\nAccording to Bohr's model, the angular momentum (L) of an electron in an orbit is quantized and is given by the formula:\nL = n * (h / 2π) = nħ\nwhere 'n' is the principal quantum number, 'h' is Planck's constant, and 'ħ' is the reduced Planck's constant.\n\nFor the first Bohr orbit, n = 1, so the angular momentum is:\nL = ħ\n\nThe angular momentum can also be expressed as the product of the linear momentum (p) and the radius of the orbit (r):\nL = p * r\n\nTherefore, for the first Bohr orbit (with radius r₁), the momentum (p) is:\np = ħ / r₁\n\nThe radius of the first Bohr orbit, also known as the Bohr radius (a₀), is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ meters or 52.9 picometers (pm).\n\n### Uncertainty of the Momentum\n\nThe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that the product of the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) is at least on the order of the reduced Planck constant. The principle is mathematically stated as:\nΔx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2\n\nFrom this, the minimum uncertainty in momentum (Δp) can be calculated as:\nΔp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n\nThe problem states that the uncertainty in the position of the electron (Δx) is 10 pm.\n\n### Ratio of Uncertainty of Momentum to Momentum\n\nNow, we can find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum (Δp) to the momentum (p):\n\nRatio = Δp / p = [ħ / (2 * Δx)] / [ħ / r₁]\n\nThe reduced Planck's constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n\nRatio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n*   r₁ = 52.9 pm\n*   Δx = 10 pm\n\nRatio = 52.9 pm / (2 * 10 pm)\nRatio = 52.9 / 20\nRatio = 2.645\n\n<<<2.645>>>"
