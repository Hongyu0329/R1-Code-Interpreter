    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we first need to analyze the structure of such characters.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nThe conductor is $N = 36036$. Its prime factorization is:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n### Step 2: Decomposition of the Dirichlet Character\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive Dirichlet characters for each prime power factor of $N$.\n$\\chi = \\chi_4 \\cdot \\chi_9 \\cdot \\chi_7 \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\nwhere each $\\chi_{q^a}$ is a primitive character with conductor $q^a$.\n\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n\nWe need this order to be exactly 6. For the lcm of a set of integers to be 6, two conditions must be met:\n1.  Every integer in the set must be a divisor of 6.\n2.  The set must contain at least one integer that is a multiple of 2 and at least one that is a multiple of 3.\n\n### Step 3: Counting Primitive Characters for Each Factor\nWe now determine the number of available primitive characters for each prime-power factor, checking that their orders are divisors of 6.\n\n*   **Conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is $\\phi(4) - \\phi(2) = 2-1 = 1$ primitive character. Its order is 2, which divides 6. So, there is **1 choice** for $\\chi_4$.\n\n*   **Conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The number of primitive characters is $\\phi(9) - \\phi(3) = 6-2=4$. The orders of elements in $C_6$ are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The non-primitive characters (induced from mod 3) have orders 1 and 2. Therefore, the primitive characters have orders 3 and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n    Both orders (3 and 6) divide 6. Thus, there are $2+2 = \\textbf{4 choices}$ for $\\chi_9$.\n\n*   **Conductor 7**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/7\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The primitive characters are all non-principal characters, of which there are $\\phi(7)-1=5$. Their orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    All these orders divide 6. So, there are $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5 choices}$ for $\\chi_7$.\n\n*   **Conductor 11**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{10}$. The primitive characters are all non-principal characters, numbering $\\phi(11)-1=9$. Their orders are 2, 5, and 10. The only order that divides 6 is 2.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    There is only **1 choice** for $\\chi_{11}$.\n\n*   **Conductor 13**: The group of characters is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/13\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_{12}$. The primitive characters are the $\\phi(13)-1=11$ non-principal characters. Their possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. We only consider those that divide 6.\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2)=1$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3)=2$.\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6)=2$.\n    The total number of choices is $1+2+2 = \\textbf{5 choices}$ for $\\chi_{13}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Total Number of Characters\nLet's denote the order of a component character $\\chi_{q^a}$ as $k_{q^a}$.\n*   $k_4 = 2$\n*   $k_9 \\in \\{3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_7 \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n*   $k_{11} = 2$\n*   $k_{13} \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$\n\nThe total number of ways to form a character $\\chi$ where each component character's order divides 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component:\nNumber of combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\nNow we must verify that the lcm of the orders is exactly 6 for all these combinations.\n*   The order of $\\chi_4$ is 2, so the lcm will always be a multiple of 2.\n*   The order of $\\chi_9$ is either 3 or 6, so the lcm will always be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm of the orders is always a multiple of 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of 6. Furthermore, since the order of every component character is a divisor of 6, their lcm must also be a divisor of 6. The only integer that is both a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 is 6 itself.\n\nTherefore, every one of the 100 possible combinations of primitive component characters results in a character of order exactly 6.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is 100.\n\n<<<100>>>"
