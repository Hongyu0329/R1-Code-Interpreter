The total displacement field (D) through the transistor, which corresponds to the total charge density induced in the channel, is given by the sum of the contributions from the top and bottom gates:

D = D_tg + D_bg = C_tg * V_tg + C_bg * V_bg

Here, D_tg is the displacement field from the top gate and D_bg is the displacement field from the bottom gate. This combined displacement field represents the total surface charge density induced in the transistor's channel.
