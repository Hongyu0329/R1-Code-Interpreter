    "After a thorough analysis of The Beatles' discography, it appears there is no song that starts with a direct chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.\n\nWhile The Beatles were known for their innovative and often complex chord progressions, the specific sequence of a tonic (I) major chord immediately followed by a minor fifth (v) chord at the beginning of a song is not found in their work.\n\nSome songs feature interesting related progressions:\n\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"** from the album *A Hard Day's Night* opens with an A major chord (the tonic) and then the verse begins on an A minor chord. This is a shift from a major tonic to its parallel minor (i), not a jump to the minor fifth.\n*   **\"Strawberry Fields Forever\"** has a complex introduction. The verse of the song, which comes after the intro, does feature a move from the tonic A major to an E minor chord (the minor fifth), but this is not how the song begins.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\"** starts on an E minor chord, which is the tonic of the song, so there is no preceding tonic major chord.\n\nMany other Beatles songs feature unusual chord changes at the beginning, such as \"A Hard Day's Night\" and \"I Am the Walrus,\" but none match the specific tonic to minor fifth progression. For example, \"I Am The Walrus\" begins on a B major chord, while the song is in the key of A major, making it a II chord start. \"Things We Said Today\" has a verse that alternates between A minor and E minor, but the song is in A minor.\n\nTherefore, based on extensive analysis of their songbook, the premise of a Beatles song starting with a tonic to minor fifth chord jump seems to be incorrect.\n\n<<<No Beatles song has been identified to start with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord.>>>"
