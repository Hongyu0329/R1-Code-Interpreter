    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order 6, we follow these steps:\n\n### 1. Prime Factorization of the Conductor\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\nA search for the prime factors of 53599 reveals that $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. Let's denote the prime factors as $p_1=7, p_2=13, p_3=19, p_4=31$. All these primes are distinct, so $d$ is a square-free integer.\n\n### 2. Properties of Primitive Dirichlet Characters for a Square-Free Conductor\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\dots p_k$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\dots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$. For a prime modulus $p$, a character is primitive if and only if it is non-trivial.\n\nThe character $\\chi$ can be represented as a tuple $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character for the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n\n### 3. Order of the Character\nThe order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the component characters $\\chi_i$. We require the order of $\\chi$ to be 6.\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$.\n\nThis condition implies two things:\n1.  The order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$, must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, the possible orders are 2, 3, and 6.\n2.  The set of orders $\\{\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)\\}$ must contain at least one element divisible by 2 (i.e., an order of 2 or 6) and at least one element divisible by 3 (i.e., an order of 3 or 6).\n\n### 4. Counting Characters of Specific Orders for Each Prime Modulus\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\nLet's check the condition for our primes:\n*   $p_1=7$: $p_1-1 = 6$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n*   $p_2=13$: $p_2-1 = 12$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n*   $p_3=19$: $p_3-1 = 18$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n*   $p_4=31$: $p_4-1 = 30$, which is divisible by 2, 3, and 6.\n\nFor each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we can count the number of available non-trivial characters with orders dividing 6:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n\nFor each prime $p_i$, there are $1+2+2=5$ possible choices for the character $\\chi_i$ to have an order that is a divisor of 6 (and greater than 1).\n\n### 5. Applying Inclusion-Exclusion Principle\nWe need to count the number of 4-tuples of characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. We can do this by first counting all possibilities where the orders are divisors of 6, and then subtracting the cases where the lcm is not 6.\n\n1.  **Total number of characters whose order divides 6:**\n    For each of the four primes, there are 5 possible characters. Thus, there are $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$ such tuples. These are the primitive characters of conductor $d$ whose order divides 6.\n\n2.  **Subtract characters whose order is not exactly 6:**\n    The order is not 6 if it is a proper divisor of 6, i.e., 1, 2, or 3. Since all $\\chi_i$ are non-trivial, the order of $\\chi$ cannot be 1.\n    *   **Case A: The order of $\\chi$ divides 2.**\n        This happens if the order of every $\\chi_i$ is 2. For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2. So, there is $1^4 = 1$ character whose order is 2.\n    *   **Case B: The order of $\\chi$ divides 3.**\n        This happens if the order of every $\\chi_i$ is 3. For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3. So, there are $2^4 = 16$ characters whose order is 3.\n\nThe sets of characters of order dividing 2 and order dividing 3 are disjoint (except for the trivial character which we have already excluded). Therefore, the number of primitive characters of conductor $d$ and order 6 is the total number of candidates minus those whose order divides 2 or 3.\n\nNumber of characters = (Total characters with order dividing 6) - (Characters with order dividing 2) - (Characters with order dividing 3)\nNumber of characters = $625 - 1 - 16 = 608$.\n\n"
