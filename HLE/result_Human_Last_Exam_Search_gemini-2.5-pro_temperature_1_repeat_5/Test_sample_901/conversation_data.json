    "The reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide in tert-butyl alcohol is an E2 elimination reaction. The regioselectivity of this reaction is determined by the stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\nFirst, it is important to identify the relative stereochemistry of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane as *trans*. In this configuration, the bromine and methyl groups are on opposite sides of the cyclohexane ring.\n\nFor an E2 reaction to occur, the leaving group (bromine) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon must be in an anti-periplanar conformation, meaning they are both in axial positions and on opposite sides of the ring. Let's analyze the two possible chair conformations of the *trans* isomer:\n\n1.  **Diequatorial conformation:** In this more stable conformation, both the bulky bromine and methyl groups occupy equatorial positions. However, since the bromine is not in an axial position, this conformer cannot undergo an E2 reaction.\n2.  **Diaxial conformation:** In this less stable conformation, both the bromine and methyl groups are in axial positions. For the (1S,2R) isomer, the bromine will be axial-down and the methyl group will be axial-up. The reaction must proceed through this less stable conformer.\n\nWith the bromine in an axial-down position, the base will abstract a proton that is in an axial-up position on an adjacent carbon (C2 or C6).\n\n*   **At carbon 2 (C2):** The methyl group is in the axial-up position, which means the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. Since there is no axial hydrogen on C2, elimination to form the more substituted Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene) cannot occur.\n*   **At carbon 6 (C6):** This carbon has an axial-up hydrogen which is anti-periplanar to the axial-down bromine.\n\nTherefore, the bulky base, potassium tert-butoxide, will abstract the axial proton from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6. This results in the formation of the less substituted alkene.\n\nThe name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
