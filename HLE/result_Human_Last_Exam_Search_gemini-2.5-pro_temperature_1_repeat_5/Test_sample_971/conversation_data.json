    "Based on available written records, it is not possible to determine the exact number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position that Natalia Osipova performed in the Act I variation of the Bolshoi Ballet's 2008 production of *Don Quixote*.\n\nWhile numerous reviews and articles from that period praise her performance as Kitri, they refer to her turns in descriptive rather than numerical terms. For instance, critics highlighted her \"breathtaking technique\" and her ability to toss off \"multiple pirouettes with a laugh\". Her turns are often described as \"speedy multiple pirouettes\" and a \"dizzying series of revolutions\".\n\nDetailed choreographic breakdowns or specific counts of pirouettes for this particular performance are not available in the public record. Although video recordings of her 2008 performance exist, a precise count would require a visual analysis of the footage, which cannot be conducted through text-based research alone. Reviews of her later performances mention her executing \"awesome triple spins in the wedding act coda\". A 2007 review of her performance at the Kennedy Center noted that in the Act III fouett√© sequence, she performed \"mostly doubles, with a few triples sprinkled in-between, then did four or six singles before unleashing a 4ple pirouette\". However, this is for a different act and a year earlier.\n\nWithout a definitive written account or a frame-by-frame analysis of the 2008 performance of the Act I variation, any number provided would be speculative.\n\n<<<Unable to provide a specific number based on available written records.>>>"
