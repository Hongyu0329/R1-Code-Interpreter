    "Following the rules of the one-dimensional cellular automaton Rule 110, the binary pattern obtained after 20 iterations starting from a single cell in state 1 is `111110100010`.\n\nRule 110 determines the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its two immediate neighbors. The rules for the new state of the center cell are as follows:\n\n| Current Pattern | New State for Center Cell |\n|---|---|\n| 111 | 0 |\n| 110 | 1 |\n| 101 | 1 |\n| 100 | 0 |\n| 011 | 1 |\n| 010 | 1 |\n| 001 | 1 |\n| 000 | 0 |\n\nStarting with an initial state of a single \"1\" cell surrounded by \"0\"s, the pattern evolves with each iteration. The evolution of the pattern for the first 20 steps is as follows:\n\n*   **Generation 0:** 1\n*   **Generation 1:** 110\n*   **Generation 2:** 1110\n*   **Generation 3:** 11010\n*   **Generation 4:** 111110\n*   **Generation 5:** 1100010\n*   **Generation 6:** 11100110\n*   **Generation 7:** 110101110\n*   **Generation 8:** 111111010\n*   **Generation 9:** 1100001110\n*   **Generation 10:** 1110011010\n*   **Generation 11:** 11010111110\n*   **Generation 12:** 11111000010\n*   **Generation 13:** 110001001110\n*   **Generation 14:** 111011101010\n*   **Generation 15:** 110110111110\n*   **Generation 16:** 111110100010\n*   **Generation 17:** 1100011101110\n*   **Generation 18:** 111011011010\n*   **Generation 19:** 110110111110\n*   **Generation 20:** 111110100010\n\nThis behavior, arising from simple rules, is an example of the complex patterns that can be generated by cellular automata.\n\n<<<111110100010>>>"
