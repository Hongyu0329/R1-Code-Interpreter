    "A \"Manhattan lattice\" is another name for the square lattice. A self-avoiding walk is a path on a lattice that does not visit the same point more than once. The term a(n) denotes the number of distinct n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\nThe number of self-avoiding walks for a given number of steps is a known integer sequence, often cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). For a square lattice, this corresponds to sequence A001411.\n\nThe initial values for the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a square lattice are:\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n\nBased on this sequence, the value for a 10-step self-avoiding walk is 44,100.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
