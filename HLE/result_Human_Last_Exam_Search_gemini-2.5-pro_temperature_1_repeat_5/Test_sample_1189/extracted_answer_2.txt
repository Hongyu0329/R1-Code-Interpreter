Let \( f_m \) be the number of sets \( T \) that satisfy the given conditions for positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). The value of \( f_m \) can be determined by the following recurrence relation:

\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} - f_{m-1} - (2^n - m + 1)f_{m-2} \right) \]

This recurrence is valid for \( m \ge 1 \), with the base cases defined as:
*   \( f_1 = 0 \)
*   \( f_0 = 1 \)
*   \( f_k = 0 \) for \( k < 0 \)

Using the hint's notation, where \( a = \binom{2^n-1}{m-1} \), the formula is:
\[ f_m = \frac{1}{m} \left( a - f_{m-1} - (2^n-m+1)f_{m-2} \right) \]
