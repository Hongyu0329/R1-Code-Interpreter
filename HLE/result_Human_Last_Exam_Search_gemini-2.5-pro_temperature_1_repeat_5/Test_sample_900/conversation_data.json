    "I am unable to provide a precise number of \"pas de Balanchine\" performed by Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo for the following reasons:\n\n*   **Unavailable Video:** The primary video recording of Svetlana Gileva performing the \"Jete Woman solo\" from the Semperoper Ballett's 2015 production of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated\" is currently unavailable for viewing. Without a visual reference, it is impossible to analyze the choreography and count specific movements.\n\n*   **Ambiguous Terminology:** The term \"pas de Balanchine\" is not a formally recognized or defined step within the ballet lexicon. It is a descriptive phrase used to characterize movements or choreographic sequences that emulate the style of the renowned choreographer George Balanchine. This style is often characterized by speed, precision, musicality, and a neoclassical aesthetic. William Forsythe, the choreographer of \"In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,\" was heavily influenced by Balanchine. Therefore, one could interpret many movements or even the entire solo as being in the style of Balanchine, making a quantitative count subjective and speculative.\n\n**William Forsythe and the Influence of Balanchine**\n\nWilliam Forsythe is widely regarded as a revolutionary figure in contemporary ballet who has fundamentally altered the way we perceive and analyze classical dance. He expanded upon the foundations of classical ballet, pushing the boundaries of balance, flexibility, and coordination. His choreographic approach often involves deconstructing and reassembling classical ballet vocabulary, creating a unique and dynamic movement language.\n\nForsythe's work is frequently described as a continuation and extension of Balanchine's neoclassical innovations. Critics and scholars note that Forsythe, like Balanchine, emphasizes a deep connection to the music and a rigorous, yet expanded, use of the classical technique. His choreography is known for its intricate and high-speed ensemble sections, complex partnering, and demanding solos that require exceptional technical skill and artistry from the dancers. The \"Jete Woman solo\" is a prime example of this, designed to showcase the dancer's virtuosity and command of the Forsythe style.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is clear that Svetlana Gileva performed this notable solo as a principal dancer with the Semperoper Ballett, the specific number of \"pas de Balanchine\" cannot be determined due to the unavailability of the performance video and the interpretive nature of the term itself.\n\n<<<I am unable to provide a numerical answer to your question for the reasons detailed above.>>>"
