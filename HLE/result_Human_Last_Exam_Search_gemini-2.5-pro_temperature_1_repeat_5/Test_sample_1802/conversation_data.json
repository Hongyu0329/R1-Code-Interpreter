    "A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is a quantum channel that transforms a $d$-dimensional quantum state (qudit) $\\rho$ according to the formula:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{i,j=0}^{d-1} p_{ij} U_{ij} \\rho U_{ij}^\\dagger$\n\nHere, $\\{U_{ij}\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators), which form a basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_{ij}$ are probabilities, so they are non-negative and sum to one ($\\sum p_{ij} = 1$). The operators $K_{ij} = \\sqrt{p_{ij}} U_{ij}$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel is defined as its Choi rank, which is the minimum number of Kraus operators needed to describe the channel. For the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, its rank is determined by the dimension of the linear span of the operator products $\\{K_a^\\dagger K_b\\}$, where $\\{K_a\\}$ are the Kraus operators of the original channel $\\Lambda$.\n\nTo find the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$, we can choose a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ that maximizes this dimension. This is achieved by selecting a channel where all $d^2$ probabilities $p_{ij}$ are non-zero. A common example is the completely depolarizing channel, where $p_{ij} = 1/d^2$ for all $i,j$. For such a channel, the Kraus operators are $K_{ij} = \\frac{1}{d} U_{ij}$.\n\nThe rank of the complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$ is then given by:\n$\\text{rank}(\\Lambda^c) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{K_{ik}^\\dagger K_{jl}\\}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ (\\frac{1}{d} U_{ik})^\\dagger (\\frac{1}{d} U_{jl}) \\})$\n$= \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ \\frac{1}{d^2} U_{ik}^\\dagger U_{jl} \\})$\n\nThe product of two generalized Pauli operators, $U_{ik}^\\dagger U_{jl}$, is proportional to another generalized Pauli operator. Specifically, it is a scalar multiple of $U_{j-i, l-k}$. By allowing the indices $i, j, k, l$ to vary over all possible values from $0$ to $d-1$, the operator products $U_{ik}^\\dagger U_{jl}$ can generate the entire set of Pauli operators $\\{U_{mn}\\}$.\n\nSince the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{mn}\\}$ form a basis for the vector space of all $d \\times d$ matrices, $M_d(\\mathbb{C})$, the dimension of their span is $d^2$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$.\n\n<<<d^2>>>"
