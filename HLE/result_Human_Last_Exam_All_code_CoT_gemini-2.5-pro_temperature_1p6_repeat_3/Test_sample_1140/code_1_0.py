    The goal is to synthesize a peptide with two key features:
    1.  Length: At {peptide_length} amino acids, it is too long for a single, efficient Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) run. The cumulative yield would be extremely low.
    2.  Unnatural Amino Acid: It contains '{unnatural_aa}', which cannot be incorporated by standard recombinant protein expression systems (like in E. coli).

    The most helpful and common technique for this specific challenge is **{recommended_technique}**.
    
    This strategy breaks the difficult problem of synthesizing a long, modified peptide into several manageable steps:

    Step 1: **Divide and Conquer**
    The {peptide_length} amino acid sequence is strategically divided into smaller fragments. For example, two fragments of approximately 50 amino acids each. The division point is ideally a native Cysteine residue, or a site compatible with modern NCL variations.

    Step 2: **Chemical Synthesis of Fragments**
    Each smaller fragment is synthesized independently using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). This is highly efficient for peptides of this shorter length.
    - The fragment containing the unnatural amino acid ('X') is made by including the corresponding building block (e.g., Fmoc-L-4-azido-phenylalanine) in the SPPS cycle.
    - The N-terminal fragment is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester.
    - The C-terminal fragment is synthesized to have an N-terminal Cysteine.

    Step 3: **Ligation**
    The purified fragments are then joined together in a chemoselective reaction. The N-terminal Cysteine of one fragment attacks the C-terminal thioester of the other fragment, forming a native peptide bond at the ligation site.

    Step 4: **Purification**
    The final, full-length {peptide_length} amino acid peptide is purified to homogeneity, typically using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).
    
    This approach elegantly bypasses the limitations of both direct SPPS and standard recombinant expression.
