# The value of 'a' for which the volume constraint becomes the only obstruction
# is known to be the fourth power of the golden ratio, τ.
# The formula is a = ((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)^4.

# Define the integer numbers used in the equation.
one = 1
five = 5
two = 2
four = 4

# Calculate the golden ratio, τ (tau)
tau = (one + math.sqrt(five)) / two

# Calculate the final value of a = τ^4
a = tau**four

# As requested, we print the full equation with all its numbers,
# followed by the calculated result.
