    "The task is to identify the common name for the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function within the nuclear criticality community and to represent the answer using a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the term requested by the user. The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function, $g(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, is a fundamental quantity in physics and is known as the **Dynamic Structure Factor**, often denoted as $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega)$.\n2.  Next, I will present the mathematical formula for this transformation. The transform converts the function from real space and time coordinates ($\\mathbf{r}, t$) to reciprocal space (wavevector) and frequency coordinates ($\\mathbf{k}, \\omega$). The standard definition is $S(\\mathbf{k}, \\omega) = \\iint g(\\mathbf{r}, t) e^{-i(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} - \\omega t)} d^3\\mathbf{r} dt$.\n3.  Finally, as requested, I will provide a Python script. This script will not perform a symbolic or numerical calculation, as no specific function $g(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ is provided. Instead, it will use `print()` statements to clearly display the name of the resulting function, its mathematical definition, and break down the components of the defining equation. This will include explicitly printing the numerical values (coefficients) present in the standard form of the equation to meet the user's requirement.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the name of the double Fourier transform of the\n# generalized pair correlation function, g(r, t).\n\n# The resulting function is known as the Dynamic Structure Factor, S(k, ω).\n# This script will print its definition.\n\nprint(\"In the nuclear criticality community, as in condensed matter physics, the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function g(r, t) is called the Dynamic Structure Factor, denoted as S(k, ω).\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe mathematical definition is:\")\nprint(\"S(k, ω) = ∫ d³r ∫ dt  g(r, t) * exp[-i * (k⋅r - ωt)]\")\nprint(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n# The user also requested to output each number in the final equation.\n# We will now print the components and numerical coefficients of the equation.\n\nprint(\"\\nAnalysis of the equation's components and numbers:\")\n\n# The functions\nprint(\"Input Function: g(r, t) (Generalized Pair Correlation Function)\")\nprint(\"Output Function: S(k, ω) (Dynamic Structure Factor)\")\n\n# The core transformation term (Fourier kernel)\nprint(\"Fourier Kernel: exp[-i * (k⋅r - ωt)]\")\n\n# Identifying the numerical constants in the standard form of the equation\n# The coefficient of the integral is implicitly 1.\nprint(\"Coefficient of the integral: 1\")\n# The coefficient of 'i' in the exponent is -1.\nprint(\"Coefficient of 'i' in the exponent: -1\")\n# The coefficient of 'k⋅r' inside the parentheses is 1.\nprint(\"Coefficient of 'k⋅r' in the exponent term (k⋅r - ωt): 1\")\n# The coefficient of 'ωt' inside the parentheses is -1.\nprint(\"Coefficient of 'ωt' in the exponent term (k⋅r - ωt): -1\")\n\n# Note: Some Fourier transform conventions include a normalization factor like 1/((2π)^4),\n# but this is often omitted in the definition for simplicity in physics literature.\n# Based on the standard definition, the numbers are as listed above.\n```\n<<<Dynamic Structure Factor>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function commonly called in the nuclear criticality community? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
