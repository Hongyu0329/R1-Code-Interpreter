    explanation = """
The question asks whether it is a theorem of ZFC (standard set theory) that a certain object must exist.
Let's break down the object:
1.  A tree T of height ω₁.
2.  Each level L_α (for α < ω₁) is a maximal antichain in P(ω₁)/<ω₁. This is equivalent to a partition of ω₁ into at most ω₁ uncountable pieces (ignoring countable sets).
3.  Each level L_β is a refinement of L_α for β > α. This means the sequence of partitions gets progressively finer.
4.  The crucial property: The tree has no "common refinement" of all its levels.

The question "Does there always exist..." means "Is it provable in ZFC?".
To answer this "No", we can show that the non-existence of such a tree is consistent with ZFC.

We can appeal to strong forcing axioms, which are known to be consistent with ZFC (assuming the consistency of large cardinals). A relevant axiom here is the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA).

A known consequence of PFA is that many potentially "pathological" objects of height ω₁ are, in fact, well-behaved. PFA implies that any ω₁-long sequence of refining partitions of ω₁ (like the levels of the tree described) *must* have a common refinement.

Since a model of ZFC + PFA exists (is consistent), in that model, the tree described in the question *cannot* exist. Because we have a model of set theory where the object does not exist, it is not a theorem of ZFC that the object *always* exists.
