    """
    This function calculates the number of non-zero terms in the asymptotic expansion
    of f(x) up to the x^-100 term.

    The recurrence relation for the coefficients c_n is:
    - c_n = 1, if n is odd.
    - c_n = 1 - c_{n/2}, if n is even.
    - with the base case c_1 = 0.

    A coefficient c_n is non-zero if n = 2^k * q (with q odd) satisfies:
    1. q = 1 and k is odd.
    2. q >= 3 and k is even.

    The code counts the number of integers n from 2 to 100 satisfying these rules.
