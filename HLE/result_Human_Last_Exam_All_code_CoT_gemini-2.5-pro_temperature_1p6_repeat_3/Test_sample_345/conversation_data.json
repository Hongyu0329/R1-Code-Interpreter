    "To answer your question, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will search for the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther, specifying the year 1927.\n2.  I will then cross-reference the search results with the acquisition year 1967 to identify the specific museum.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script to store this information in variables and print a formatted string that clearly states the name of the museum.\n\n```python\ndef find_museum():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the information about the acquisition\n    of the painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Details of the artwork and acquisition\n    artist = \"Kurt Günther\"\n    painting_title = \"The Radionist\"\n    year_painted = 1927\n    year_acquired = 1967\n    \n    # The acquiring institution, based on information from the\n    # Dresden State Art Collections (Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, SKD).\n    # The specific collection is the Galerie Neue Meister, housed in the Albertinum.\n    acquiring_museum = \"Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery), Albertinum, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\"\n\n    # Print the answer in a full sentence\n    print(f\"In the year {year_acquired}, the {year_painted} tempera painting titled \\\"{painting_title}\\\" by {artist} was acquired by the following museum:\")\n    print(acquiring_museum)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_museum()\n```\n<<<Galerie Neue Meister (New Masters Gallery), Albertinum, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"
