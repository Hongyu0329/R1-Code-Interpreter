    "Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles for a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game, the button is the most profitable position to open-raise from. This allows for a very wide range of hands to be played profitably.\n\nWhen considering suited Jacks (JXs), their strength is primarily determined by the rank of the second card (the \"kicker\"). A higher kicker provides more potential to make stronger pairs and stronger straights. Therefore, the value of suited Jacks decreases as the kicker gets lower (e.g., JTs is much stronger than J3s).\n\nIn a standard button opening range, all suited Jacks, from JQs down to J2s, are considered profitable raises. The hand with the lowest profitability, and therefore the \"worst\" one to open while still being a correct play, is the one with the lowest possible kicker. This hand is Jack-Two suited.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_open():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n  in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on standard GTO strategy.\n\n  In poker GTO charts for the button position, the opening range is very wide.\n  For suited Jacks (JXs), all combinations from JQs down to J2s are\n  typically considered profitable opens.\n\n  The strength of these hands decreases as the kicker (the 'X') gets lower.\n  Therefore, the hand with the lowest EV (Expected Value) that is still a\n  standard open-raise is the one with the lowest kicker.\n  \"\"\"\n  worst_hand = \"J2s\"\n  print(worst_hand)\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
