    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we first need to understand the group's structure and the definition of a power subgroup.\n\n**1. The Generalized Quaternion Group Q_128**\n\nThe generalized quaternion group of order $2^n$, denoted $Q_{2^n}$, has a specific structure. For size 128, we have $2^n = 128$, so $n=7$. The group $Q_{128}$ can be defined by the presentation:\n$Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of this group can be uniquely written in the form $x^i y^j$ where $0 \\le i < 64$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n**2. Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a *power subgroup* if there exists an integer $m$ such that $H$ is the set of all $m$-th powers of elements in $G$. That is, $H = G^m = \\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n**3. Plan**\n\nOur goal is to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n\nA key property is that for any group $G$, the set of $m$-th powers $G^m$ only depends on the greatest common divisor of $m$ and the group's exponent. The exponent of a group is the smallest positive integer `k` such that $g^k=1$ for all elements `g` in the group. For $Q_{128}$, the exponent is 64.\n\nTherefore, we only need to compute the sets $G^d$ for each divisor $d$ of 64. The divisors of 64 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. By counting how many of these sets are unique, we will find the total number of power subgroups.\n\nWe will now execute this plan using a Python script. The script will:\n1.  Define the elements and multiplication rule for $Q_{128}$.\n2.  Iterate through the divisors of the exponent (64).\n3.  For each divisor `d`, compute the set $G^d = \\{g^d \\mid g \\in Q_{128}\\}$.\n4.  Count the number of unique sets generated.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure to find the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_power_subgroup_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \n    The group Q_128 is defined as <x, y | x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, yx = x^(-1)y>.\n    Elements are represented as tuples (i, j) corresponding to x^i * y^j.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 64  # Order of the cyclic subgroup <x>\n    \n    # Define the group multiplication for Q_128 (size 2*N = 128)\n    def multiply(g1, g2):\n        i1, j1 = g1\n        i2, j2 = g2\n        \n        if j1 == 0:\n            # (x^i1) * (x^i2 y^j2) = x^(i1+i2) y^j2\n            return ((i1 + i2) % N, j2)\n        else: # j1 == 1\n            # (x^i1 y) * (x^i2 y^j2)\n            # using the relation y * x^k = x^(-k) * y\n            if j2 == 0:\n                # (x^i1 y) * x^i2 = x^i1 * (y x^i2) = x^i1 * (x^(-i2) y) = x^(i1-i2) y\n                return ((i1 - i2) % N, 1)\n            else: # j2 == 1\n                # (x^i1 y) * (x^i2 y) = (x^(i1-i2) y) * y = x^(i1-i2) y^2\n                # y^2 = x^(N/2) = x^32\n                # Result is x^(i1-i2) * x^(N/2) = x^(i1-i2 + N/2)\n                return ((i1 - i2 + N // 2) % N, 0)\n\n    # Define exponentiation g^m using exponentiation by squaring\n    def power(g, m):\n        if m < 0: # Not needed for this problem, but good practice\n            raise ValueError(\"Power must be non-negative\")\n        if m == 0:\n            return (0, 0)  # Identity element x^0 y^0\n        \n        res = (0, 0)  # Start with identity\n        base = g\n        while m > 0:\n            if m % 2 == 1:\n                res = multiply(res, base)\n            base = multiply(base, base)\n            m //= 2\n        return res\n\n    # 1.
