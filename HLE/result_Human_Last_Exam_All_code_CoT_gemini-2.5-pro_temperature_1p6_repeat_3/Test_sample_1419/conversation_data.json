    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to derive the expression and present it with a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Beta Function:** I will start with the one-loop beta function, `β(u)`, for the coupling constant `u` in the `ϕ^4` theory. This function describes how the coupling changes with the energy scale. We will work in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions, where `ϵ` is a small positive parameter. The beta function to one-loop order is:\n    `β(u) = -ϵu + (3u² / (16π²))`\n\n2.  **Fixed Point Condition:** A fixed point, `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point of the theory. It is found by setting the beta function to zero:\n    `β(u*) = 0`\n\n3.  **Solve for u*:** I will solve the resulting equation for the non-trivial fixed point (where `u* ≠ 0`). This gives the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which controls the critical behavior of the system.\n    `-ϵu* + (3(u*)² / (16π²)) = 0`\n    `u* * (-ϵ + 3u* / (16π²)) = 0`\n    Solving for the non-zero `u*` gives:\n    `u* = (16π² / 3) * ϵ`\n\n4.  **Python Code:** I will write a Python script that constructs and prints this final expression in a clear, human-readable format, making sure to show each numerical component of the equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates and displays the leading order expression for the\n# Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n\n# The derivation starts from the one-loop beta function in d = 4 - epsilon dimensions:\n# beta(u) = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi^2)) * u^2\n# The non-trivial fixed point u* is found by setting beta(u*) = 0.\n# Solving for u* gives: u* = (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon\n\n# Define the numerical and symbolic components of the final expression.\nnumerator_coefficient = 16\ndenominator_coefficient = 3\npi_symbol = \"π^2\"\nepsilon_symbol = \"ε\"\n\n# Construct and print the final equation for the fixed point coupling.\n# The result shows the leading order dependence on epsilon.\nprint(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in terms of ε is:\")\nprint(f\"u* = ( {numerator_coefficient} * {pi_symbol} / {denominator_coefficient} ) * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n```\n<<<(16 * π^2 / 3) * ε>>>"
