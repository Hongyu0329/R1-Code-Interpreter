    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Epsilon Expansion Framework**: The epsilon expansion is a technique in renormalization group theory to calculate critical exponents near the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. We define a small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d` is the spatial dimension.\n2.  **Upper Critical Dimension**: For systems with a scalar order parameter (like the Ising model), the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The problem is set in `d = 3`, so `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n3.  **Model Selection**: In the absence of specific information, we assume the simplest and most common model for this context: the Ising model. In the language of O(n) models, the Ising model corresponds to n=1 (a scalar order parameter).\n4.  **Formula for α**: The specific heat exponent α, to the first order in `ϵ` for an n-component model, is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Calculation**: We will substitute `n=1` and `ϵ=1` into this formula to find the value of α.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the steps as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for the 3D Ising model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define parameters\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension for the Ising model\n    n = 1  # Number of components of the order parameter (n=1 for Ising)\n\n    # Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Numerator and denominator components of the formula for alpha\n    num_n_term = 4 - n\n    den_n_term = n + 8\n    den_factor = 2\n\n    # Perform the calculation symbolically to get a fraction\n    alpha_frac = sympy.Rational(num_n_term, den_factor * den_n_term) * epsilon\n\n    # Perform the calculation numerically\n    alpha_float = float(alpha_frac)\n\n    # Print the explanation and step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"To find the specific heat exponent α in d=3 using the epsilon expansion, we use the first-order formula for an O(n) model:\")\n    print(\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\")\n    print(\"\\nFor the 3D Ising model, the parameters are:\")\n    print(f\"  - Spatial dimension d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"  - Upper critical dimension d_c = {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"  - Order parameter components n = {n}\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, we calculate ε:\")\n    print(f\"  ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"\\nNow, we substitute n=1 and ε=1 into the formula:\")\n    # Using format to show each number in the equation\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({den_factor} * ({n} + {den_n_term})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {num_n_term} / ({den_factor} * {den_n_term}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {num_n_term} / {den_factor * den_n_term}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe result is:\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha_frac}\")\n    print(f\"As a decimal, α ≈ {alpha_float}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<1/6>>>"
