# The problem reduces to finding the lexicographically least tuple (a_1, b_1, ..., a_l, b_l)
# with a_i, b_i != 1 and minimal l, satisfying the equation derived from the Euler
# characteristic of the connect-sum being zero.

# The equation is: 2 * sum((1-a_i)*(1-b_i) for i in 1..l) = l-1
# Minimal l is 3, which gives: c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 1
# where c_i = (1 - a_i) * (1 - b_i).

# To find the lexicographically smallest tuple, we choose the smallest possible
# pairs (a,b) with a,b != 1. The smallest such pairs are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), etc.
# The combination c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=-1 satisfies the equation.
# To get c=1, the smallest pair is (0,0).
# To get c=-1, the smallest pair is (0,2).
# So we use two (0,0) pairs and one (0,2) pair.

# Let's define the pairs and calculate the corresponding c values for the final equation.
p1 = (0, 0)
p2 = (0, 0)
p3 = (0, 2)

c1 = (1 - p1[0]) * (1 - p1[1])
c2 = (1 - p2[0]) * (1 - p2[1])
c3 = (1 - p3[0]) * (1 - p3[1])
c_sum = c1 + c2 + c3

# To form the lexicographically smallest tuple (a1, b1, a2, b2, a3, b3) from the
# set of pairs {(0,0), (0,0), (0,2)}, we arrange them in increasing lexicographical order.
# The arrangement ((0,0), (0,0), (0,2)) yields the smallest final tuple.
