    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Factorize the Conductor N**: The properties of Dirichlet characters depend on the prime factorization of the conductor $N$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$.\n    So, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n\n2.  **Decomposition of Primitive Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product of primitive characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$.\n    $\\chi = \\chi_{4} \\cdot \\chi_{9} \\cdot \\chi_{7} \\cdot \\chi_{11} \\cdot \\chi_{13}$\n    where each $\\chi_{p^k}$ is a primitive Dirichlet character modulo $p^k$.\n\n3.  **Condition on the Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{4}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{9}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    For the order of $\\chi$ to be 6, this lcm must be 6. This implies:\n    a) The order of each component character must divide 6.\n    b) The set of component orders must contain a multiple of 2 and a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Count Choices for Each Component Character**: We need to count the number of primitive characters for each prime power factor whose order divides 6. We use the property that in a cyclic group of order $m$, there are $\\phi(d)$ elements of order $d$ for each $d|m$.\n\n    *   **For conductor 4 ($2^2$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. There is one primitive character, and its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, there is **1** choice for $\\chi_4$.\n\n    *   **For conductor 9 ($3^2$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, the possible orders for a primitive character are 3 or 6. Both of these divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{4}$.\n\n    *   **For conductor 7 ($7^1$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. Primitive characters are all non-trivial ones, so their orders can be 2, 3, or 6. All these divide 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n    *   **For conductor 11 ($11^1$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. We need primitive characters whose orders divide both 10 and 6. The only such order is 2. The number of characters of order 2 is $\\phi(2) = \\mathbf{1}$.\n\n    *   **For conductor 13 ($13^1$)**: The group of characters is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. We need primitive characters whose orders divide both 12 and 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = \\mathbf{5}$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The total number of primitive characters of order 6 is the product of the number of valid choices for each component. Let's verify the lcm condition. The order of $\\chi_4$ must be 2, which supplies the necessary factor of 2. The order of $\\chi_9$ must be 3 or 6, which supplies the necessary factor of 3. Since all component orders divide 6, the lcm of any combination will be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, we can multiply the number of choices for each component to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef euler_phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\n# The number of primitive characters for each prime power factor p^k whose order divides 6.\n# Calculated as Sum(phi(d)) for valid orders d.\n\n# For conductor 4 (2^2): primitive order is 2. phi(2) = 1\ncount_4 = euler_phi(2)\n\n# For conductor 9 (3^2): primitive orders are 3, 6. phi(3) + phi(6) = 2 + 2 = 4\ncount_9 = euler_phi(3) + euler_phi(6)\n\n# For conductor 7: primitive orders are 2, 3, 6. phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\ncount_7 = euler_phi(2) + euler_phi(3) + euler_phi(6)\n\n# For conductor 11: primitive order must divide gcd(10,6)=2. order is 2. phi(2) = 1\ncount_11 = euler_phi(2)\n\n# For conductor 13: primitive order must divide gcd(12,6)=6. orders are 2, 3, 6. phi(2)+phi(3)+phi(6) = 1+2+2=5\ncount_13 = euler_phi(2) + euler_phi(3) + euler_phi(6)\n\ncomponent_counts = [count_4, count_9, count_7, count_11, count_13]\n\n# Calculate the total number by multiplying the counts for each component.\ntotal_count = math.prod(component_counts)\n\n# Format the final equation string\nequation_str = \" * \".join(map(str, component_counts))\n\nprint(\"The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N=36036 and order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each prime power component.\")\nprint(f\"The number of choices for conductors 4, 9, 7, 11, and 13 are {component_counts[0]}, {component_counts[1]}, {component_counts[2]}, {component_counts[3]}, and {component_counts[4]} respectively.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n```\n<<<100>>>"
