    "The user is asking for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal's structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means its point group must possess a roto-inversion axis, which includes a center of inversion (`-1`) or a mirror plane (`m`, which is equivalent to `-2`).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal has no net electric dipole moment. This is true for any point group containing a center of inversion, and also for several non-centrosymmetric point groups that have multiple rotation axes preventing a unique polar direction.\n3.  **Optically Active**: The crystal has the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light. This is a physical property that requires the crystal structure to be **chiral**.\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction in these requirements. For a crystal class to be optically active, it **must be chiral**. The user's first condition states that the crystal class **must be achiral**. A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral simultaneously.\n\nTherefore, no crystal class can satisfy these contradictory conditions. The set of \"achiral and optically active\" crystal classes is empty.\n\nI will write a Python script to demonstrate this. The script will:\n1.  Define the 32 crystal point groups and their fundamental properties (chirality and polarity).\n2.  Explain the contradiction in the user's request.\n3.  Programmatically search for any classes that meet all three specified criteria.\n4.  Print the result of the search, which will be an empty set, confirming that no such classes exist.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal point groups to find those that are\n    achiral, non-polar, and have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The premise of the question contains a contradiction.\n    # 1.
