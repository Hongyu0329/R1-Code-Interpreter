    "My plan is to solve this problem by first simplifying the integral and then calculating the necessary values.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integrand is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is the derivative of `ln(F₃(x))`. Therefore, the integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`. This can be simplified to `ln(|F₃(1)| / |F₃(0)|)`. Let's call this value `V`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0)**: I will trace the functions to find the value at x=0.\n    *   F₀(0) = 0\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1)**: Similarly, I will find the value at x=1.\n    *   F₀(1) = 1\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(1)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n5.  **Compute the Final Value**: I will substitute the values of F₃(0) and F₃(1) back into the expression for `V`. Then, I will calculate `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral and calculates the final value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the functions based on the problem description.\n    # We don't need to define them as Python functions, but we need their values at x=0 and x=1.\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate F₃(0)\n    # F₀(0) = 0\n    # F₁(0) = sin(F₀(0)) = sin(0) = 0\n    # F₂(0) = e^(F₁(0)) = e^0 = 1\n    # F₃(0) = ln(1 + F₂(0)) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n    f3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate F₃(1)\n    # F₀(1) = 1\n    # F₁(1) = sin(F₀(1)) = sin(1)\n    # F₂(1) = e^(F₁(1)) = e^(sin(1))\n    # F₃(1) = ln(1 + F₂(1)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n    f3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n    # Step 4: Evaluate the definite integral V\n    # The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) from 0 to 1 is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    # Note: F₃(x) = ln(1+e^sin(x)).
