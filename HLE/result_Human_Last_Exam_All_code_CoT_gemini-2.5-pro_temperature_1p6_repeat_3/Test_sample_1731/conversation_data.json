    "My plan is to derive the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas (the Bose case for light quanta) using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are rigorously grounded by large deviation theorems.\n\nHere are the steps I will follow in the Python script:\n1.  **State the Theoretical Basis**: I will start by explaining that the equilibrium state of the photon gas corresponds to the macrostate with the maximum entropy, a principle supported by large deviation theory (like Boltzmann-Sanov). This state is the most probable one.\n2.  **Mean Energy `<E>` Derivation**:\n    *   I will use the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons (`<n(ε)> = 1 / (exp(ε/k_B T) - 1)`) and the density of states for photons in a 3D box (`g(ε) ∝ Vε²`).\n    *   The mean energy `<E>` is calculated by integrating the energy per state (`ε`) times the number of photons per state (`<n(ε)>`) over all states (`g(ε)dε`).\n    *   This will lead to the Stefan-Boltzmann law for total energy: `<E> = a * V * T⁴`.\n    *   The script will explicitly show how the radiation constant `a` is composed of fundamental physical constants (`π`, `k_B`, `h`, `c`) and calculate its numerical value.\n3.  **Entropy `S` Derivation**:\n    *   I will use the fundamental thermodynamic relationship for a photon gas, which can be derived from the grand canonical partition function: `S = (4/3) * <E> / T`.\n    *   By substituting the derived expression for `<E>`, I will find the formula for entropy: `S = b * V * T³`.\n    *   The script will calculate the numerical value of the entropy coefficient `b`.\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will print these derivations step-by-step, showing the symbolic formulas and the calculated numerical coefficients for both energy and entropy.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# --- Introduction ---\nprint(\"This script presents the derivation of equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas.\")\nprint(\"The foundation is Bose-Einstein statistics and the principle of maximum entropy, which is mathematically supported by Large Deviation Theory.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# --- Physical Constants (SI Units) ---\nk_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\nh = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant (J·s)\nc = 2.99792458e8     # Speed of light (m/s)\n\n# --- 1.
