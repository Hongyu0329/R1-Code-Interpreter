    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the primary allotropes of phosphorus:** I will list the most common and stable forms of phosphorus.\n2.  **Determine the color of each allotrope:** For each form, I will state its characteristic color. Note that \"white phosphorus\" is often called \"yellow phosphorus\" as it tends to turn yellow upon exposure to light, but these refer to the same allotrope, so we will count this as one color.\n3.  **Count the distinct colors:** I will sum the number of unique colors found.\n4.  **Generate the code:** The Python script will list the allotropes, their colors, and then print an equation that adds \"1\" for each distinct color to arrive at the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the colors of phosphorus allotropes and calculates the total number.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the main allotropes and their distinct colors.\n    # White phosphorus can appear yellowish, but it's fundamentally one color category.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The primary allotropes of phosphorus exhibit the following colors:\")\n    for allotrope, color in allotropes.items():\n        print(f\"- {allotrope} is {color}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Count the distinct colors.\n    num_colors = len(allotropes)\n    \n    # Step 4: Display the final calculation as an equation.\n    # The instruction requires showing each number in the equation.\n    # We will represent each distinct color with the number '1'.\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * num_colors\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we sum one for each distinct color:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
