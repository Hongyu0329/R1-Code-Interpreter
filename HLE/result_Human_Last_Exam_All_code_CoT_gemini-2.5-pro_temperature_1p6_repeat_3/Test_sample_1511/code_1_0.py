    # Part (b): Find the maximal sum for k=2, m=5.

    # We need to find the maximum possible value of |F| + |G|.
    # Let's consider two main candidates for the maximal sum.

    # Candidate 1: The trivial case.
    # If one family, say G, is empty, the cross-intersecting condition is vacuously true.
    # To maximize |F| + |G|, we take F to be the set of all k-multisets.
    # The size is (m + k - 1) choose k.
    # |G| = 0.
    total_multisets = math.comb(m + k - 1, k)
    sum_trivial = total_multisets
    
    # Candidate 2: The non-empty "star" construction.
    # Let F = G = S_x, where S_x is the family of all k-multisets containing a fixed element x.
    # The size of S_x is (m + k - 2) choose (k - 1).
    # The sum |F| + |G| is 2 * |S_x|.
    size_star = math.comb(m + k - 2, k - 1)
    sum_star = 2 * size_star

    # The actual maximum sum is the larger of these two candidates.
    max_sum = max(sum_trivial, sum_star)
    
    # The ratio between the two sums is (m+k-1)/k.
    # If (m+k-1)/k > 2 (i.e., m > k+1), the trivial case is larger.
    # For m=5, k=2, we have m > k+1 (since 5 > 3), so we expect the trivial case to be maximal.

    # Part (a): Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports?
    # Let A be in F and B be in G. If their supports are disjoint, then A and B are disjoint, so |A intersect B| = 0.
    # This contradicts the cross 1-intersecting property |A intersect B| >= 1.
    # This holds if F and G are non-empty. If one is empty (like in the maximal case for m>k+1),
    # it cannot "contain" any multiset, so the condition of the question cannot be met.
    # Therefore, the answer is No.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): What is |F| + |G|?
    # As calculated, the maximal sum for m=5, k=2 is sum_trivial.
    answer_b = max_sum
    
    # Part (c): Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element?
    # This asks if the maximal F must be of the form S_x.
    # For m > k+1 (like m=5, k=2), the maximal family is F=binom([m],k), G=emptyset.
    # F = binom([m],k) is not equal to S_x (it's a superset).
    # For m = k+1, F=binom([m],k) is one possible maximal family, and it is not S_x.
    # Since there exists a maximal configuration where F is not S_x, the condition is not necessary.
    # So the answer is No.
