    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Rephrasing the problem:** A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The morphisms of the category correspond to the elements of the monoid, and the composition of morphisms corresponds to the monoid's binary operation. The identity morphism is the identity element of the monoid. Therefore, the question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n2.  **Enumerating possibilities:** Let the three morphisms be represented by the set `{e, a, b}`, where `e` is the identity morphism. The composition operation is fixed whenever `e` is involved (e.g., `e ∘ a = a`). We only need to define the compositions for the non-identity elements:\n    *   `a ∘ a`\n    *   `a ∘ b`\n    *   `b ∘ a`\n    *   `b ∘ b`\n    Each of these four compositions can result in `e`, `a`, or `b`. This gives a total of `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables.\n\n3.  **Filtering for valid monoids:** We will programmatically generate all 81 possible tables. For each table, we'll check if it satisfies the associativity law (`(x ∘ y) ∘ z = x ∘ (y ∘ z)` for all `x, y, z`). The tables that satisfy this law define valid monoids.\n\n4.  **Counting isomorphism classes:** Two monoids are considered isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by simply renaming the non-identity elements. In our case, this means swapping the roles of `a` and `b`. To count the number of unique monoids up to isomorphism, we will find a \"canonical\" representation for each valid monoid. For a given monoid table, we'll generate its isomorphic counterpart (by swapping `a` and `b`) and choose the lexicographically smaller of the two as the canonical form. We then count the number of unique canonical forms.\n\n5.  **Implementation:** The plan will be implemented in a Python script that carries out the generation, validation, and counting process, and prints the final result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let the morphisms be represented by integers 0, 1, 2.\n    # 0: identity morphism 'e'\n    # 1: morphism 'a'\n    # 2: morphism 'b'\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n\n    # Generate all possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements {1, 2}.\n    # A table is a tuple (a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b).\n    # Each product can be 0, 1, or 2.
