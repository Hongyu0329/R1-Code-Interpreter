    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound using the Baire Category Theorem.
    # The theorem implies that in a decomposable continuum X = A U B,
    # at least one of A or B must have a non-empty interior.
    # The closure of this interior forms a regular proper subcontinuum.
    # This proves the cardinality must be at least 1.
    lower_bound = 1

    # Step 2: Establish an upper bound by providing a constructive example.
    # An example is the union of a Sierpinski carpet (which is regular) and a
    # pseudo-arc (which is not and has no regular subcontinua), joined at a point.
    # In this constructed continuum, only the Sierpinski carpet itself is a
    # regular proper subcontinuum. This shows a cardinality of 1 is possible.

    # Step 3: Conclude the result.
    # Since the cardinality must be >= 1 and we have shown that 1 is achievable,
    # the smallest possible cardinality is 1.
