The problem of stochastic logistic regression falls into a special class of stochastic convex optimization problems.

1.  The loss function is convex and smooth, but not globally strongly convex. This rules out the faster Theta(1/T) rate (Choice A).
2.  The standard rate for general convex problems is Theta(D/sqrt(T)). Given the regime T = O(e^D), this rate does not simplify to Theta(1/sqrt(T)) (Choice C).
3.  The logistic loss function has a special structure: it is locally strongly convex but grows more slowly (almost linearly) far from the minimum.
4.  Optimization theory shows that for functions with this hybrid structure, an intermediate convergence rate between 1/sqrt(T) and 1/T is achievable.
5.  The rate Theta(1/T^(2/3)) corresponds to such an intermediate case.

Therefore, the optimal rate of convergence is Theta(1/T^(2/3)).
