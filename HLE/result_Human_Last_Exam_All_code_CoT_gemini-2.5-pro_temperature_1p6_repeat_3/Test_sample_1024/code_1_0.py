# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes Allusion
# The couplet is a slightly inaccurate reference to "The Adventure of the Priory School",
# where horses' hooves are shod to create misleading cow tracks.
# The 'shoes' properly 'belonged' to the illusion they were meant to create: that of a cow.
answer_A = 6

# Part B: Thematic Resonance
# The flawed allusion in (A) and Kinbote's subsequent hijacking of its meaning
# perfectly underscores the theme of "education vs mis-education".
# Kinbote's deranged commentary is a direct product of his warped, solipsistic 'education'.
answer_B = 3

# Part C: Nabokov's Experience with Inter-reference
# Nabokov's most intensive work with "intricate back-referencing" was his
# monumental four-volume annotated translation of Alexander Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin".
