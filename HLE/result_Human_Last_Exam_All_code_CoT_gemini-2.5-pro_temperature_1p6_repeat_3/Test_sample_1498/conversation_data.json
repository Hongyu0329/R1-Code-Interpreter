    "My plan is to answer your question by locating the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that deals with the names of the prophets. The poem is known for its concise method of listing them. Instead of naming all 25 prophets individually, it references a Qur'anic passage for the first 18 and then lists the remaining 7 in the subsequent verse.\n\nI will write a Python script that:\n1.  Defines the starting and ending verse numbers for this section.\n2.  Prints a clear explanation of how these verses cover all 25 prophets.\n3.  Includes the original Arabic text of the verses and their English translation for complete clarity.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_in_poem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and explains the verses in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_bayt = 28\n    end_bayt = 29\n\n    print(f\"In the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the 25 prophets are mentioned from Bayt {start_bayt} to Bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    print(\"The author cleverly covers all 25 names across just two bayts (verses).\")\n    print(\"\\nFirst, he refers to a group of 18 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an.\")\n    print(f\"\\nBayt {start_bayt}:\")\n    print(\"فِي تِلْكَ حُجَّتُنَا مِنْهُمْ ثَمَانِيَةٌ       مِنْ بَعْدِ عَشْرٍ وَيَبْقَى سَبْعَةٌ وَهُمُ\")\n    print(\"Translation: In 'That is Our Argument' [Surah Al-An'am 6:83-86] there are eight after ten of them [i.e., 18], and seven remain, and they are:\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThen, he explicitly lists the remaining 7 prophets.\")\n    print(f\"\\nBayt {end_bayt}:\")\n    print(\"إِدْرِيْسُ هُودٌ شُعَيْبٌ صَالِحٌ وَكَذَا       ذُو الْكِفْلِ آدَمُ بِالْمُخْتَارِ قَدْ خُتِمُوا\")\n    print(\"Translation: Idris, Hud, Shu'ayb, Salih, and likewise Dhul-Kifl, Adam; with the Chosen One [Muhammad] they are sealed.\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Therefore, the discussion and listing of the prophets' names span from bayt {start_bayt} to {end_bayt}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_prophets_in_poem()\n```\n<<<From Bayt 28 to Bayt 29>>>"
