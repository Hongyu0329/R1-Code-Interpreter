    "This problem requires us to use Sir Isaac Newton's correlation between the seven colors of the visible spectrum and the seven notes of a musical scale.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  First, I need to establish Newton's mapping of colors to musical notes. The standard mapping is Red (C), Orange (D), Yellow (E), Green (F), Blue (G), Indigo (A), and Violet (B).\n2.  Next, I must identify the colors mentioned in the question.\n    *   The first color is \"the colour produced when combining yellow and blue\". In additive light mixing (like on a screen), this would be cyan, but in the context of pigments or Newton's color circle, mixing yellow and blue gives **Green**.\n    *   The second color is explicitly stated as **Blue**.\n3.  The question asks for the \"range between\" these two colors. This refers to the range from Green to Blue on the spectrum.\n4.  Finally, I will use the mapping from step 1 to find the musical notes that correspond to Green and Blue. These notes will define the requested range.\n\nThe Python code below will define this color-to-note mapping, identify the notes for Green and Blue, and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the musical notes corresponding to a range of colors on Newton's color circle.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to the musical scale.\n    newton_color_music_scale = {\n        'Red': 'C',\n        'Orange': 'D',\n        'Yellow': 'E',\n        'Green': 'F',\n        'Blue': 'G',\n        'Indigo': 'A',\n        'Violet': 'B'\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the two colors that define the range.\n    # The color produced by combining yellow and blue is Green.\n    start_color = 'Green'\n    end_color = 'Blue'\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding musical notes from the mapping.\n    start_note = newton_color_music_scale[start_color]\n    end_note = newton_color_music_scale[end_color]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.\n    print(f\"The question asks for the musical note(s) for the range between two colors on Newton's circle.\")\n    print(f\"The first color boundary is the result of combining yellow and blue, which is {start_color}.\")\n    print(f\"According to Newton's mapping, {start_color} corresponds to the musical note: {start_note}.\")\n    print(f\"The second color boundary is {end_color}.\")\n    print(f\"According to Newton's mapping, {end_color} corresponds to the musical note: {end_note}.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the musical notes corresponding to the range from {start_color} to {end_color} are {start_note} and {end_note}.\")\n\nsolve_newton_music_puzzle()\n```\n<<<F and G>>>"
