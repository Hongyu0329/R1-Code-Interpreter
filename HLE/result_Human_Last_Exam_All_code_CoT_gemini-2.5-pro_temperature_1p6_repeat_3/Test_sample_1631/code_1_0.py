    # The problem describes adding notches to a sheet metal blank before forming.
    # The primary purpose of such features is to control how the material flows
    # from the flat blank into the 3D die cavity.

    # Option D correctly identifies the root cause: "issues of material inflow into forming cavities around
    # complex geometries". When forming a part with sharp corners or deep sections, the flat blank edge
    # can get stuck or bunch up at these features. This restricts the flow of material, which in turn
    # can lead to other defects like wrinkles (Option A) or tears/thinning (Option I).

    # A bypass notch is a geometric solution that strategically removes a small amount of material from the
    # blank edge. This relieves the material congestion at the complex feature (e.g., a tight corner),
    # allowing the rest of the material to flow ("bypass") more smoothly into the die.

    # Therefore, controlling the material inflow is the fundamental principle.

    explanation = """The scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal forming is to manage material flow. 
When forming parts with complex geometries, such as sharp corners or small radii, the edge of the sheet metal blank can jam or bunch up, restricting the flow of material into the die cavity. 
This restriction is a primary cause of defects like wrinkles, splits, and excessive thinning. 
A bypass notch is a cutout strategically placed in the blank to remove the material that would otherwise cause this congestion. This allows the surrounding material to 'bypass' the difficult geometry and flow more smoothly into the die, thus preventing the formation of defects.
