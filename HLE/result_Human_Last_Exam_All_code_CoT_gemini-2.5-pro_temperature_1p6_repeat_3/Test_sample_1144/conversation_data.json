    "To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:\n1.  **Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (Δp):** We will use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, which states that `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so the equation becomes `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck's constant and `Δx` is the given uncertainty in position.\n2.  **Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p):** The angular momentum of an electron in a Bohr orbit is quantized as `L = nħ`, where `n` is the principal quantum number. Since `L = p * r`, the momentum `p` is `nħ / r`. For the first Bohr orbit, `n=1` and the radius `r` is the Bohr radius, `a₀`. So, the momentum is `p = ħ / a₀`.\n3.  **Calculate the ratio (Δp / p):** We will divide the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) by the momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p).\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations and find the ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define physical constants\nh_bar = 1.054571817e-34  # Reduced Planck's constant (J·s)\na0 = 5.29177210903e-11   # Bohr radius (m)\n\n# Given value\ndelta_x = 10e-12  # Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10 x 10^-12 m)\n\n# 1. Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# Using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: delta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = h_bar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# 2. Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p)\n# For the first Bohr orbit (n=1), p = h_bar / a0\np = h_bar / a0\n\n# 3. Calculate the ratio of delta_p to p\nratio = delta_p / p\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"Given uncertainty in position (Δx): {delta_x:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"Calculated uncertainty in momentum (Δp): {delta_p:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(f\"Calculated momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p): {p:.4e} kg·m/s\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final ratio is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = Δp / p = {delta_p:.4e} / {p:.4e} = {ratio:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is {ratio:.4f}.\")\n```\n<<<2.6461>>>"
