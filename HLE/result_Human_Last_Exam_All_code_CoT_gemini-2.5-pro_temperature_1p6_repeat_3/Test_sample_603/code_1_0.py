# The question asks for a fundamental limitation of bulk experiments.
# We will identify the correct choice and print it.

# Answer Choices
choices = {
    'A': 'Heat capacity change is assumed to be zero.',
    'B': 'The NNPB parameters are T-independent.',
    'C': 'Impossibility to capture heterogeneity in bulk experiments.',
    'D': 'Temperature oscillations in bulk calorimetry are too large to capture T-dependence.',
    'E': 'Temperature cannot be controlled in calorimetric experiments.'
}

# The correct choice is 'C' because bulk experiments measure the average
# properties of a large population, inherently masking differences
# (heterogeneity) between individual molecules or subpopulations.
