# The chemical reaction proceeds in two main steps:
# 1. A thermal sulfoxide syn-elimination to form an allyl vinyl ether.
# 2. An in-situ [3,3]-sigmatropic Claisen rearrangement of the allyl vinyl ether.
# The final major product is an unsaturated aldehyde.

# IUPAC Naming components:
# Principal group: Aldehyde -> "-al", at position 1
# Parent chain: 5 carbons -> "pent"
# Unsaturation: double bond at position 4 -> "4-en"
# Substituents: two methyl groups at position 5 -> "5,5-dimethyl"

# Assemble the name
final_iupac_name = "5,5-dimethylpent-4-enal"

# Print the final answer, which includes all the relevant numbers (5,5 and 4)
# as requested in the problem description.
