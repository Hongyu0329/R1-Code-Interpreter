    "My plan is to solve this trivia question by writing a Python script. Since directly searching the web within a script can be complex, I will embed the necessary information about the movie *Ovosodo* into a Python data structure, like a dictionary. The script will then access this dictionary to retrieve and print the name of the US city that the character Tommaso moves to.\n\n```python\ndef find_destination_city():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores movie plot information and retrieves the\n    US city Tommaso moves to in the movie Ovosodo.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Storing movie plot details in a dictionary.\n    movie_database = {\n        'Ovosodo': {\n            'year': 1997,\n            'character_moves': {\n                'name': 'Tommaso',\n                'destination_city': 'Philadelphia',\n                'destination_country': 'United States'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Retrieve the information from the data structure.\n    movie_title = 'Ovosodo'\n    character_name = movie_database[movie_title]['character_moves']['name']\n    city = movie_database[movie_title]['character_moves']['destination_city']\n\n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(f\"In the 1997 movie {movie_title}, the character {character_name} moves to the US city of {city}.\")\n\nfind_destination_city()\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
