However, high-spin d5 has a spherical (6S) ground state, so orbital angular momentum L=0, and B_orbital is negligible. The field is large, but limited to the contact term (typically 40-60 T).",
        "S=2 means 4 unpaired electrons, giving a large B_contact. The linear geometry is of very low symmetry, which leads to a ground state with a large, unquenched orbital angular momentum (L>0). This creates a massive B_orbital that adds to B_contact, producing an exceptionally large total hyperfine field (can exceed 100 T).",
        "S=2 means 4 unpaired electrons (large B_contact). However, the high symmetry of the tetrahedral geometry effectively 'quenches' the orbital angular momentum, making B_orbital small. The total field will be smaller than in option C.",
