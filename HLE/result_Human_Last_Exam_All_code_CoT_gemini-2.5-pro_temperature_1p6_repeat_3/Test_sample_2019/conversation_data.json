    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Rules:** The problem is set on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A toroidal board means it wraps around on all sides. When checking for attacks, we must consider this wrap-around behavior. For two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` board (`N=5` in this case), they attack each other if any of the following conditions are met:\n    *   **Row Attack:** `r1 == r2`\n    *   **Column Attack:** `c1 == c2`\n    *   **Diagonal Attack:** `(r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N`\n    *   **Anti-Diagonal Attack:** `(r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N`\n\n2.  **Devise a Strategy:** The board size (5x5) and the number of queens (4) are small enough to allow for a computational search of all possibilities. My strategy will be:\n    *   Generate all possible ways to place 4 queens on the 25 cells of the board. Since the queens are identical, the order of placement does not matter. This is a combination problem: \"25 choose 4\".\n    *   For each combination of 4 cells, check if it's a valid solution.\n    *   A combination is valid only if no two queens attack each other according to the toroidal rules defined above.\n    *   Keep a counter and increment it for every valid combination found.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will use Python's `itertools.combinations` library, which is perfect for this task.\n    *   First, I'll generate a list of all 25 cell coordinates.\n    *   Then, `itertools.combinations(all_cells, 4)` will give me every unique set of 4 cells.\n    *   I'll loop through these sets. For each set, I'll check all pairs of queens `(itertools.combinations(current_set, 2))` to see if they attack each other.\n    *   If no attacks are found within a set, I will increment the solution counter.\n    *   Finally, the code will print the total count in a descriptive equation-like format.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_toroidal_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    solution_count = 0\n\n    # Create a list of all possible cells on the board, e.g., (0, 0), (0, 1), ...\n    all_cells = [(r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N)]\n\n    # Generate all combinations of placing NUM_QUEENS on the available cells\n    # A placement is a tuple of queen positions, e.g., ((r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...)\n    for placement in itertools.combinations(all_cells, NUM_QUEENS):\n        is_valid = True\n        \n        # Check every pair of queens in the current placement for attacks\n        for queen1, queen2 in itertools.combinations(placement, 2):\n            r1, c1 = queen1\n            r2, c2 = queen2\n\n            # Check for row, column, and toroidal diagonal/anti-diagonal attacks\n            if (r1 == r2 or\n                    c1 == c2 or\n                    (r1 - c1) % N == (r2 - c2) % N or\n                    (r1 + c1) % N == (r2 + c2) % N):\n                is_valid = False\n                break  # An attack was found, no need to check other pairs in this placement\n\n        if is_valid:\n            solution_count += 1\n            \n    # The final equation shows the parameters of the problem and its solution\n    print(f\"Ways to place {NUM_QUEENS} queens on a {N}x{N} toroidal board = {solution_count}\")\n\nsolve_toroidal_queens()\n\n```\n<<<50>>>"
