    "To find the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary Group PSU(4, 997), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the group and involutions:** The group is G = PSU(4, q) where q = 997. An involution is an element `x` of order 2, i.e., `x^2 = 1` and `x != 1`.\n2.  **Relate to the Special Unitary Group:** The group PSU(4, q) is the quotient of the Special Unitary Group SU(4, q) by its center, Z(SU(4, q)). For q = 997, the center Z is of order `d = gcd(4, q+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. Let `Z = {I, -I}`.\n3.  **Find Preimages of Involutions:** An element `gZ` in PSU(4, q) is an involution if `(gZ)^2 = Z` and `gZ != Z`. This implies `g^2` must be in `Z` and `g` must not be in `Z`. So, we are looking for the number of elements `g` in SU(4, q) such that:\n    *   `g^2 = I` (g is an involution in SU(4,q)) and `g` is not `I` or `-I`.\n    *   `g^2 = -I` (g is a quasi-involution in SU(4,q)).\n4.  **Count the Preimages:** We need to count the number of such elements `g` in SU(4,q). This involves group-theoretic formulas based on conjugacy classes and centralizers.\n    *   The number of non-central involutions (where `g^2=I`) in SU(4,q) is given by the formula `N_1 = q^4(q^2-q+1)(q^2+1)`.\n    *   The number of quasi-involutions (where `g^2=-I`) in SU(4,q) is `N_2 = q^4(q^2-1)(q^3+1)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Involutions in PSU(4, q):** The total number of preimages not in the center is `N_1 + N_2`. Since each involution in PSU(4, q) corresponds to exactly two preimages in SU(4, q) (`g` and `-g`), the total number of involutions is `(N_1 + N_2) / 2`.\n6.  **Simplify the Formula:** After simplification, the total number of involutions is given by the formula:\n    `Number = (q^5 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 2q - 1)) / 2`\n7.  **Compute the Value:** We will use Python to substitute q = 997 into the formula and calculate the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# The prime for the finite field in PSU(4, q)\nq = 997\n\n# The formula for the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for q such that gcd(4, q+1)=2 is:\n# N = (q**5 * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 2*q - 1)) / 2\n# We can rewrite this to use integer arithmetic throughout.\n\nprint(f\"Calculating the number of involutions for q = {q}\")\nprint(\"The formula is: (q^5 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 2q - 1)) / 2\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Calculate each term of the formula\nterm1 = q**5\nterm2 = q**2 - q + 1\nterm3_num = q**2 + 2 * q - 1\n\n# Since term3_num is guaranteed to be even, we can perform integer division\nterm3 = term3_num // 2\n\nprint(f\"The equation becomes: {term1} * {term2} * ({term3_num} / 2)\")\nprint(f\"Which simplifies to: {term1} * {term2} * {term3}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Calculate the final result\nnumber_of_involutions = term1 * term2 * term3\n\nprint(f\"The total number of involutions in PSU(4, {q}) is:\")\nprint(number_of_involutions)\n```\n<<<487593630687332168923985397>>>"
