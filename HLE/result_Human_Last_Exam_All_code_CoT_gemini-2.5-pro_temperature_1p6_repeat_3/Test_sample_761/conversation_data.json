    "No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They are two distinct classes of biological macromolecules with fundamentally different structures, even when comparing their \"homo-\" forms (homopolynucleotides vs. homopolysaccharides).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the core differences:\n\n1.  **Monomers (Building Blocks)**:\n    *   **Polysaccharides** are polymers made of **monosaccharide** (simple sugar) monomers. The monomer is just a sugar unit (e.g., glucose).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** are polymers made of **nucleotide** monomers. A nucleotide is a far more complex monomer, composed of three parts: a pentose sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n\n2.  **Backbone and Linkages**:\n    *   In **polysaccharides**, the sugar monomers are linked directly to each other via **glycosidic bonds**.\n    *   In **polynucleotides**, the monomers are linked by a **sugar-phosphate backbone**. A **phosphodiester bond** connects the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar of the next.\n\n3.  **Elemental Composition**:\n    *   **Polysaccharides** primarily contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (C, H, O).\n    *   **Polynucleotides** always contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, **nitrogen** (in the bases), and **phosphorus** (in the phosphate groups).\n\nWhile both structures are polymers that involve a sugar, the identity of the monomer and the way those monomers are linked are completely different. Therefore, a polynucleotide cannot be classified as a polysaccharide.\n\n<<<No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides. They differ in their fundamental monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the chemical bonds linking these units (phosphodiester vs. glycosidic bonds), and their overall elemental composition.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
