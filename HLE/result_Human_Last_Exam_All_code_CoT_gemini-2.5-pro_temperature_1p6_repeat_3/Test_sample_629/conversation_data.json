    "Answering this question requires concepts from knot theory, specifically concerning grid diagrams. Here's a step-by-step plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n**1. Understand Minimal Grid Diagrams for the Trefoil Knot:**\nThe trefoil knot (denoted 3_1) is the simplest non-trivial knot. The smallest grid size (`n x n`) on which it can be represented is 3x3. This `n=3` is called the minimal grid number. A grid diagram is defined by the positions of `n` 'X's and `n` 'O's, with exactly one of each in every row and column. These positions can be encoded by two permutations.\n\n**2. Identify All Minimal Trefoil Diagrams:**\nWe can fix the 'X' positions to be the identity permutation `(0, 1, 2)` without loss of generality (any other 'X' permutation is equivalent via row/column reordering). A grid diagram for a knot is non-trivial (not the unknot) only if the 'O' permutation is a derangement of the 'X' permutation (meaning `x[i] != o[i]` for all `i`).\nFor `n=3`, the derangements of `(0, 1, 2)` are:\n*   `(1, 2, 0)`: This permutation, when paired with `(0, 1, 2)`, forms the **right-hand** trefoil.\n*   `(2, 0, 1)`: This permutation, when paired with `(0, 1, 2)`, forms the **left-hand** trefoil.\n\nThe question asks about the **left-hand** trefoil. We can generate all of its minimal grid diagrams by taking a base left-hand trefoil diagram and applying all possible permutations to its rows and columns. This results in exactly 6 distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil.\n\n**3. Define Equivalence:**\nThe problem asks for the number of diagrams \"up to translation and rotation\". This means we need to group the 6 left-hand trefoil diagrams into equivalence classes. Two diagrams are in the same class if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of:\n*   **Translations:** Cyclic shifts of the rows or columns.\n*   **Rotations:** 90, 180, or 270-degree rotations of the entire grid.\n\nA crucial point is that for minimal diagrams, some transformations (like a 180-degree rotation) can change a left-hand trefoil into a right-hand trefoil. Since the problem specifies we are only interested in diagrams for the *left-hand trefoil knot*, any transformation that results in a different knot type is disallowed.\n\n**4. Count the Equivalence Classes:**\nThe final step is to see how the 6 diagrams group together under the allowed transformations. We can do this by starting with one of the 6 diagrams and generating its entire \"orbit\" (all other diagrams it can be turned into). We then check if this orbit includes all 6 diagrams.\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic:\n1.  Generate the 6 known minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n2.  Start with the first diagram and find all others that are equivalent through allowed translations and rotations.\n3.  Count how many of the 6 diagrams fall into this first equivalence class.\n4.  If any diagrams are left over, start a new class and repeat.\n5.  The total number of classes found is the answer.\n\nIt turns out that all 6 minimal diagrams for the left-hand trefoil are equivalent to each other under this scheme. They form a single equivalence class.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_left_trefoil_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates the 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.\n    This is based on the standard construction (p, c.p) where p is any\n    permutation in S_3 and c is the 3-cycle (2,0,1).\n    \"\"\"\n    perms = [\n        (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2),\n        (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0)\n    ]\n    # The cycle that defines the left-hand trefoil when composed with a permutation\n    left_cycle = (2, 0, 1)\n    \n    diagrams = set()\n    for p in perms:\n        # p defines the X permutation\n        # o_perm is the composition of left_cycle and p\n        o_perm = (left_cycle[p[0]], left_cycle[p[1]], left_cycle[p[2]])\n        diagrams.add((p, o_perm))\n        \n    return list(diagrams)\n\ndef apply_row_shift(diagram, k):\n    \"\"\"Applies a cyclic shift to the rows.\"\"\"\n    x_perm, o_perm = diagram\n    n = len(x_perm)\n    # Shifting rows up by k is equivalent to cycling the permutation lists\n    new_x = x_perm[k:] + x_perm[:k]\n    new_o = o_perm[k:] + o_perm[:k]\n    return (tuple(new_x), tuple(new_o))\n\ndef apply_col_shift(diagram, k):\n    \"\"\"Applies a cyclic shift to the columns.\"\"\"\n    x_perm, o_perm = diagram\n    n = len(x_perm)\n    new_x = [(p + k) % n for p in x_perm]\n    new_o = [(p + k) % n for p in o_perm]\n    return (tuple(new_x), tuple(new_o))\n\ndef apply_rotation(diagram, deg):\n    \"\"\"Applies a geometric rotation to the grid.\"\"\"\n    if deg == 0:\n        return diagram\n    \n    x_perm, o_perm = diagram\n    n = len(x_perm)\n\n    current_x, current_o = x_perm, o_perm\n    \n    # Apply 90-degree rotation `deg/90` times\n    for _ in range(deg // 90):\n        # A point (r, c) moves to (c, n-1-r)\n        new_x = [0]*n\n        new_o = [0]*n\n        for r in range(n):\n            # For Xs\n            old_c_x = current_x[r]\n            new_r_x, new_c_x = old_c_x, n - 1 - r\n            new_x[new_r_x] = new_c_x\n            # For Os\n            old_c_o = current_o[r]\n            new_r_o, new_c_o = old_c_o, n - 1 - r\n            new_o[new_r_o] = new_c_o\n        current_x, current_o = tuple(new_x), tuple(new_o)\n        \n    return (current_x, current_o)\n    \n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of diagrams up to translation and rotation.\"\"\"\n    \n    lh_trefoils = get_left_trefoil_diagrams()\n    unclassified = set(lh_trefoils)\n    num_classes = 0\n    \n    while unclassified:\n        num_classes += 1\n        # Start a new class with an arbitrary unclassified diagram\n        rep = unclassified.pop()\n        \n        # Use a queue for a breadth-first search to find the whole class\n        queue = collections.deque([rep])\n        \n        while queue:\n            current_diagram = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # Apply all transformations\n            for k in range(1, 3): # shifts by 1 or 2\n                # Translations\n                t1 = apply_row_shift(current_diagram, k)\n                t2 = apply_col_shift(current_diagram, k)\n                \n                # Rotations\n                r1 = apply_rotation(current_diagram, 90)\n                # Note: 180 and 270 deg rotations on minimal trefoil diagrams can\n                # change their handedness.
