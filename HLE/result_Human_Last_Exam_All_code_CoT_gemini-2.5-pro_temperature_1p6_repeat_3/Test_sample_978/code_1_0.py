    print("----------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Party: Mark")
    print("Action: Negligently operated a riding lawnmower, causing it to fall into the pool.")
    print("Analysis: Mark's actions were the direct cause of the damage. He is directly liable.")
    print("\nParty: Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. (Employer)")
    print("Action: Employed Mark.")
    print("Analysis: Under vicarious liability, an employer is liable for the torts of an employee acting within the scope of employment. Evergreen is liable for Mark's negligence.")
    print("\nParty: Bruce's Neighbours")
    print("Action: Owned a dog and had a low fence.")
    print("Analysis: The neighbours' actions are too remote. The proximate cause of the damage was Mark's intervening negligent act. The neighbours are not liable.")
    print("\nConclusion for Incident 1: Mark and Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. are jointly and severally liable.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing liability for Lincoln's incident (damage to the car).")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Party: Lincoln")
    print("Action: Used a blower on rocks near a car, causing scratches.")
    print("Analysis: Lincoln's action was negligent, as a reasonable person would foresee this risk. He is directly liable.")
    print("\nParty: Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. (Employer)")
    print("Action: Employed Lincoln.")
    print("Analysis: As with Mark, Evergreen is vicariously liable for Lincoln's negligence while he was acting within the scope of his employment.")
    print("\nRegarding 'minimal damage':")
    print("Analysis: The extent of damage affects the amount of compensation, not the existence of liability. Scratches on a Ferrari constitute actual damage. The 'minimal damage' argument to negate liability is invalid.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluating the answer choices based on the conclusions.")
    print("---------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("A: Incorrect. It wrongly includes the neighbours and excludes Evergreen's liability for Lincoln's actions.")
    print("B: Incorrect. Liability is not pooled for two separate torts by different individuals.")
    print("C: Incorrect. It excludes Evergreen's liability for Lincoln's actions.")
    print("D: Incorrect. It wrongly claims 'minimal damage' negates liability.")
    print("E: Correct. This choice accurately reflects vicarious liability for both separate incidents.")
