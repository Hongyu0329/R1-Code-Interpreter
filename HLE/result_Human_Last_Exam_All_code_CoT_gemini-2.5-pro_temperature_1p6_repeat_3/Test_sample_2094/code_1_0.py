def find_hook_flash_champions():
    """
    Identifies which champions from a given list can perform a specific "hook-flash" mechanic.

    The mechanic is defined as casting a hook forward and then flashing backward during
    the cast animation to extend the hook's effective range.

    - Thresh: Can perform this. He can cast Q and then Flash during the wind-up.
      The hook originates from his new position but travels in the original direction,
      extending its range if he flashes backward.
    - Blitzcrank, Nautilus, Pyke: Cannot. Once their hook projectile is fired,
      its path is independent of their position. They can flash to reposition before
      the hook is released, but not in the specific way that extends the range
      by flashing backward.
