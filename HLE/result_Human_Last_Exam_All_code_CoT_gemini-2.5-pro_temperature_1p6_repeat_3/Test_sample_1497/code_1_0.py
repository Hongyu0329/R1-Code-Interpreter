# The final answer is determined by mapping each musical variation to the
# primary physical parameter it affects in the provided violin sound model.

# 1. 'sul ponticello' (bowing near the bridge) enhances high harmonics from the string,
#    which is controlled by the harmonic decay parameter 'Î½'. This is Group ii.

# 2. A bridge mute adds mass to the bridge, damping high-frequency vibrations
#    and thus affecting the higher body resonances 'f_2', 'a_2'. This is Group iv.

# 3. Filling a room with helium changes the speed of sound, which directly alters the
#    violin's air resonance frequency 'f_1'. This is Group iii.

# 4. Playing on the E string instead of the A string changes the fundamental
#    frequency 'F' of the open string. This is Group i.

# For the direction of change in (2): Adding a mute means adding mass to the bridge.
# Increasing the mass of a vibrating system lowers its resonant frequency.
# The last parameter of group iv is f_2, which is a resonant frequency.
# Therefore, f_2 goes down.

# The resulting sequence is: ii, iv, iii, i
# The direction for the second variation is: down

# We combine these into the final format.
final_answer = "ii,iv,iii,i,down"
