    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we first need to understand the structure of a standard nanocar and the meaning of \"perfluoro\".\n\n1.  **Nanocar Structure**: A first-generation nanocar, a single-molecule vehicle, is composed of a chassis and four fullerene (C60) wheels. The perfluorination process only affects the chassis, as the C60 wheels are pure carbon and contain no hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Chassis Structure**: The chassis is a hydrocarbon based on an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) scaffold. A common structure is `1,4-bis(3,5-bis(ethynyl)phenyl)benzene`. We need to count the number of hydrogen atoms in this molecule.\n    *   **Central Ring**: A central `benzene` ring connected at positions 1 and 4. A benzene ring (C6H6) has 6 hydrogens. With two connections, 2 hydrogens are removed. This leaves **4 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Outer Rings**: Two `phenyl` groups are attached to the central ring. These are connected at 3 points each (once to the central ring and twice to ethynyl groups). This leaves **3 hydrogens** per ring, for a total of **6 hydrogens**.\n    *   **Terminal Groups**: There are four `ethynyl` (-C≡CH) groups that connect the chassis to the wheels. Each has **1 hydrogen**, for a total of **4 hydrogens**.\n3.  **\"Perfluoro\" Meaning**: This prefix means that every hydrogen atom in the parent molecule is replaced by a fluorine atom.\n4.  **Calculation**: By summing the hydrogens from all parts of the chassis, we can find the total number of fluorine atoms required for perfluorination.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and display the process.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the hypothetical number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar.\n\n    The calculation is based on the structure of a first-generation nanocar's chassis,\n    where \"perfluoro\" implies all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the number of hydrogens on each part of the nanocar chassis.\n    # The chassis is 1,4-bis(3,5-bis(ethynyl)phenyl)benzene.\n\n    # A central 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring has (6 - 2) = 4 hydrogens.\n    h_central_ring = 4\n\n    # Two 1,3,5-trisubstituted phenyl rings.
