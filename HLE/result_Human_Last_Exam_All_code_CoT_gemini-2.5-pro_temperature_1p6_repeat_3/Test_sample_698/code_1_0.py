# Description: This script analyzes the options for a "True Avalanche" puzzle
# and prints the correct answer based on the puzzle's rules and description.

# The Puzzle:
# Write a true avalanche using the word "computer" that fits the description:
# "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# Analysis:
# 1. The key word "computer" establishes the syllable pattern we're looking for: com-pu-ter.
# 2. A "True Avalanche" must repeat this phonetic pattern.
# 3. The phrase must also match the description of software telling a bird to relieve itself.

# Let's check the most fitting option: 'Computer: "Come poo, tern!"'
# - Phonetic Pattern: "Come poo, tern" sounds almost identical to "com-pu-ter". It successfully repeats the syllables.
# - Description Match: A "tern" is a seabird. The phrase "Come poo" is a direct command for the bird to relieve itself, which aligns with the description of what the software does.
# - Conclusion: This option perfectly fulfills all requirements.

correct_answer = 'B. Computer: "Come poo, tern!"'
