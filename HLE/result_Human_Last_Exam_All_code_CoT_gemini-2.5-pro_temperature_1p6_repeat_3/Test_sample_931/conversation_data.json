    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have been recorded feeding on, I will perform a step-by-step analysis of the provided options based on established biological knowledge.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Establish the known dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans from entomological sources. They are primarily known to be predators of small, soft-bodied arthropods, but are also known to supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.\n2.  Create a Python script that codifies this knowledge.\n3.  The script will then evaluate each answer choice against the known facts.\n4.  It will check single-item options (A, B, C, D, E) first.\n5.  Based on the valid single items, it will evaluate the combination options (F, G).\n6.  The script will print its reasoning and identify the most comprehensive correct answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary options for adult Raphidiopterans based on known facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known facts about adult Raphidiopteran diet\n    known_diet_facts = {\n        \"predatory\": True,\n        \"prey_type\": \"small, soft-bodied arthropods (e.g., aphids, psyllids)\",\n        \"supplemental_diet\": [\"nectar\", \"pollen\"]\n    }\n\n    # The provided answer choices\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': ['A', 'E'],\n        'G': ['D', 'E']\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans...\\n\")\n\n    # Evaluate each option\n    is_correct = collections.defaultdict(bool)\n\n    # A: Nectar\n    if 'nectar' in known_diet_facts[\"supplemental_diet\"]:\n        print(\"Evaluating A (Nectar): Correct.
