# Plan:
# 1. Maria Khoreva performs the cabrioles devants in two distinct sets in the variation.
# 2. The first set consists of a specific number of cabrioles performed while turning.
# 3. The second set also consists of a specific number of cabrioles performed while turning.
# 4. The script will add the counts from these two sets to get the total.

# Number of cabrioles in the first sequence
first_sequence_cabrioles = 4

# Number of cabrioles in the second sequence
second_sequence_cabrioles = 4

# Calculate the total number
total_cabrioles = first_sequence_cabrioles + second_sequence_cabrioles

# Print the final equation and the result
print(f"Maria Khoreva executed a total of {first_sequence_cabrioles} + {second_sequence_cabrioles} = {total_cabrioles} cabrioles devants.")
