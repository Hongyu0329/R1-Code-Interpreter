    "The Chern number is a topological invariant, and a key property of such invariants is their additivity. When two topological systems, such as Chern insulators, are combined into a single larger system without closing the bulk energy gap, the Chern number of the combined system is simply the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual components.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator, C1.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator, C2.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number, C_total, by summing C1 and C2.\n4.  Print the individual Chern numbers and the final equation showing the sum.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\n# because the Chern number is an additive topological invariant.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the explanation and the final calculation\nprint(f\"The first Chern insulator has a Chern number C1 = {c1}.\")\nprint(f\"The second Chern insulator has a Chern number C2 = {c2}.\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the combined junction is the sum of the individual numbers.\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
