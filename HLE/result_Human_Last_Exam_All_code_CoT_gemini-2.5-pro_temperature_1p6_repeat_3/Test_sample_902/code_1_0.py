    The question asks if a program P exists that can compute the value of def_superfast(10000).

    The answer is no, such a program P cannot exist. The function is uncomputable. Here's a proof by contradiction:

    1.  Assume a program, let's call it P, exists. This program P is written in Python, and when run, it calculates and returns the integer value of def_superfast(10000).

    2.  Let's call the value that P computes 'S'. From the problem's definition:
        S = Huge_int + 1
        Where 'Huge_int' is the largest integer returned by any Python program with source code shorter than 10000 symbols.

    3.  Program P is itself a Python program that returns an integer. It is entirely feasible to write the source code for P to be less than 10000 symbols long. The logic it represents is complex, but the code describing it would not be exceptionally large.

    4.  If the source code of P is less than 10000 symbols and it returns an integer (S), then P itself belongs to the set of programs that are considered when calculating 'Huge_int'.

    5.  By definition, 'Huge_int' is the LARGEST integer returned by any program in that set. Since P is in that set, its output 'S' must be less than or equal to 'Huge_int'. This gives us the inequality:
        S <= Huge_int

    6.  Now we have a contradiction. From step 2, we have S = Huge_int + 1. From step 5, we have S <= Huge_int. This means:
        Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int

    This final inequality is a clear mathematical impossibility.

    Since our initial assumption (that program P exists) leads to a logical contradiction, the assumption must be false. Therefore, no program P can compute def_superfast(10000).
