    "Of course, let's break down this organic chemistry problem step-by-step.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** We'll start by looking at the substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and the reagent, potassium tert-butoxide. The reagent is a strong, bulky base, which strongly indicates an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** The E2 reaction has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and the proton to be removed must be in an **anti-periplanar** configuration. In a cyclohexane ring, this means they must be in a **trans-diaxial** arrangement (one pointing straight up, the other straight down on adjacent carbons).\n3.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation:** We need to draw the chair conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. The (1S,2R) configuration corresponds to a *trans* relationship between the bromo and methyl groups. This means they can exist in two chair conformations: one with both groups equatorial (diequatorial) and one with both groups axial (diaxial). While the diequatorial conformer is more stable, the E2 reaction can only proceed from the less stable **diaxial** conformer because only it places the leaving group (Br) in an axial position, which is necessary for the reaction.\n4.  **Find the Anti-Periplanar Proton:** In the reactive diaxial conformer, the bromine at C1 is axial. We must now look for an axial proton on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Elimination cannot occur here.\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is axial. The axial hydrogen at C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) to be removed by the base.\n5.  **Identify the Product:** Since elimination can only occur by removing the axial proton from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6. The methyl group at C2 is unaffected. The resulting product is named **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is a case where stereochemical constraints override Zaitsev's rule (which would have predicted the more substituted alkene, 1-methylcyclohexene).\n\nThe following python code will print the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the reaction between\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.\n\n    The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n    Key points:\n    1. E2 requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement for the leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen (H).\n    2. The substrate (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a trans isomer.\n    3. The reactive conformer must have Br in an axial position. This forces the methyl group into an axial position as well.\n    4. We check for axial hydrogens on adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n       - At C2, the methyl group is axial, so the hydrogen is equatorial. No elimination.\n       - At C6, there is an axial hydrogen available. Elimination occurs here.\n    5. A double bond forms between C1 and C6.\n    6. The product is named by giving the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2),\n       making the methyl group substituent at position 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    product_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\n    # The final equation is: Reactant -> Product. We will output the product name.\n    # The number '3' is part of the product name.\n    print(f\"The product of the reaction is: {product_name}\")\n\nsolve_reaction()\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
