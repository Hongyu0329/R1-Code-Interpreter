    This function identifies the product of the reaction between
    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide.

    The reaction is an E2 elimination.
    Key points:
    1. E2 requires an anti-periplanar (trans-diaxial) arrangement for the leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen (H).
    2. The substrate (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane is a trans isomer.
    3. The reactive conformer must have Br in an axial position. This forces the methyl group into an axial position as well.
    4. We check for axial hydrogens on adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).
       - At C2, the methyl group is axial, so the hydrogen is equatorial. No elimination.
       - At C6, there is an axial hydrogen available. Elimination occurs here.
    5. A double bond forms between C1 and C6.
    6. The product is named by giving the double bond the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2),
       making the methyl group substituent at position 3.
