    "This problem asks for the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping. Here's a step-by-step plan to solve this:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure**: A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each. These two cliques are connected by a single edge, which is known as the bottleneck or bridge.\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees**: We need to find the degree of the two specific nodes that are connected by this bottleneck edge. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n3.  **Model the Gossiping Process**: Randomized uniform gossiping consists of two steps: first, a node is selected uniformly at random from all nodes in the graph. Second, one of its neighbors is selected, also uniformly at random.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**: The bottleneck edge can be sampled in two ways: by starting at the node in the first clique and choosing its neighbor in the second, or vice-versa. The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two mutually exclusive events.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    during a randomized uniform gossiping step.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Problem parameters\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # Explanation of the plan\n    print(\"This script calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Define the graph's structure.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the Graph Structure\")\n    clique_size = total_nodes // 2\n    print(f\"A barbell graph with {total_nodes} nodes consists of two complete graphs (K_{clique_size}) connected by a single bottleneck edge.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the degrees of the nodes connected to the bottleneck.\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Determine Node Degrees\")\n    # In a complete graph K_k, each node has a degree of k-1.\n    degree_in_clique = clique_size - 1\n    # The two nodes at the ends of the bottleneck edge have one additional connection.\n    degree_bridge_node = degree_in_clique + 1\n    print(f\"The two nodes connected by the bottleneck each belong to a K_{clique_size}.\")\n    print(f\"Their degree within their clique is {clique_size} - 1 = {degree_in_clique}.\")\n    print(f\"Adding the bottleneck connection, their total degree is {degree_in_clique} + 1 = {degree_bridge_node}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the probability.\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the Probability\")\n    print(\"The bottleneck edge can be selected in two ways during a gossip step:\")\n    print(\"  1.
