# Problem parameters
# D = (C_2)^5, so |D| = 2^5
order_D = 2**5
# The inertial quotient E has order 5
order_E = 5

# Step 1: Calculate l(B)
# l(B) is the number of p'-classes of the inertial quotient E.
# The characteristic is p=2. The order of E is 5, which is odd (so all elements are 2'-elements).
# E is a cyclic group of prime order, so it's abelian.
# The number of conjugacy classes in an abelian group is its order.
l_B = order_E

# Step 2: Calculate k(B)
# k(B) is the number of orbits of E acting on Irr(D).
# We use Burnside's Lemma: k(B) = (1/|E|) * sum(|Irr(D)^g| for g in E)

# For the identity element g=1 in E, it fixes all characters of D.
# The number of irreducible characters of an abelian group is its order.
num_chars_D = order_D
fixed_by_identity = num_chars_D

# For any non-identity element g in E, we need to find the number of fixed characters.
# The order of such g is 5.
# The action of g on D gives a representation C_5 -> GL(5,2).
# This decomposes D into a 1-dim trivial module (fixed points) and a 4-dim irreducible module.
# The size of the fixed-point subgroup C_D(g) is 2^1 = 2.
# The size of the commutator subgroup [D,g] is |D|/|C_D(g)| = 32/2 = 16.
# The number of characters fixed by g is |D|/|[D,g]|.
num_fixed_by_non_identity = order_D / (order_D / 2)

# Number of non-identity elements in E
num_non_identity_elements = order_E - 1

# Apply Burnside's Lemma
sum_of_fixed_points = fixed_by_identity + num_non_identity_elements * num_fixed_by_non_identity
k_B = sum_of_fixed_points / order_E

# Ensure k_B is an integer
k_B = int(k_B)

# Step 3: Compute k(B) - l(B)
result = k_B - l_B
