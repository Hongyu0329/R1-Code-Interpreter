    This script determines and prints the Genji-kō partition for Chapter 39 of The Tale of Genji.

    Chapter 39 is titled "Yūgiri" (夕霧). Its associated pattern is the 38th in the
    standard Genji-kō sequence. The visual pattern for "Yūgiri" is as follows
    when mapping to the set of incense sticks {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

    - Sticks 1 and 2 are linked.
    - Stick 3 is independent.
    - Sticks 4 and 5 are linked.

    This corresponds to the partition {{1, 2}, {3}, {4, 5}}.
    The code will format this partition as requested, sorted by the minimum element
    of each subset.
