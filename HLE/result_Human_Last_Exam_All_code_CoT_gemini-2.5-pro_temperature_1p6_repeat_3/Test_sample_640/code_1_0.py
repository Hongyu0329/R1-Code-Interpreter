    print("In such a case, the Schr√∂dinger equation can be decoupled into independent channels in the new basis. The resulting S-matrix in the new basis (S') would be diagonal.")

In advanced scattering theory (specifically inverse scattering), it is known that one can construct potentials that are non-diagonal and cannot be diagonalized by a constant transformation (i.e., they are nontrivially coupled), yet they are 'transparent' to inter-channel scattering.")
