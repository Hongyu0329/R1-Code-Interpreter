    "The problem is to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation of the solution:\n\n**1. Definition of a Pauli Channel**\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d \\times d$ density matrix $\\rho$ is defined by the following operator-sum representation:\n$$\n\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k P_k \\rho P_k^\\dagger\n$$\nHere, $\\{P_k\\}_{k=0}^{d^2-1}$ represents the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (including the identity). These operators form a complete orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. The coefficients $p_k$ are probabilities that satisfy $p_k \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{k=0}^{d^2-1} p_k = 1$. The operators $K_k = \\sqrt{p_k} P_k$ are the Kraus operators of the channel.\n\n**2. Rank of a Channel and its Complement**\n\nA fundamental theorem in quantum channel theory states that the rank of any quantum channel $\\Lambda$ is equal to the rank of its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$.\n$$\n\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{rank}(\\Lambda)\n$$\nThis means we can solve the problem by finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself.\n\n**3. Calculating the Rank of a Pauli Channel**\n\nThe rank of a quantum channel with Kraus operators $\\{K_k\\}$ is given by the rank of its Gram matrix $G$, whose elements are defined by the inner product $G_{ij} = \\text{Tr}(K_i^\\dagger K_j)$.\n\nFor the Pauli channel, the Gram matrix elements are:\n$$\nG_{ij} = \\text{Tr}((\\sqrt{p_i} P_i)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_j} P_j)) = \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j)\n$$\nThe generalized Pauli operators have the orthogonality property $\\text{Tr}(P_i^\\dagger P_j) = d \\cdot \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. Substituting this into the expression for $G_{ij}$:\n$$\nG_{ij} = d \\sqrt{p_i p_j} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nThis result shows that the Gram matrix $G$ is a diagonal matrix. The rank of a diagonal matrix is simply the number of non-zero elements on its diagonal. An element $G_{ii} = d \\cdot p_i$ is non-zero if and only if the probability $p_i$ is non-zero.\nTherefore, the rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is equal to the number of non-zero coefficients $p_k$ in its definition.\n\n**4. Maximizing the Rank**\n\nTo maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities $p_k$. The channel is defined by a sum over all $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators. We can construct a valid channel where all $d^2$ coefficients are non-zero. For example, we can choose the uniform distribution:\n$$\np_k = \\frac{1}{d^2} \\quad \\text{for all } k = 0, 1, \\dots, d^2-1\n$$\nThis choice satisfies the conditions $p_k > 0$ and $\\sum_k p_k = d^2 \\times (1/d^2) = 1$. With this choice, the number of non-zero coefficients is $d^2$.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nSince we can have up to $d^2$ non-zero probability coefficients, the maximal possible rank for a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is $d^2$. Consequently, the maximal rank for its complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is also $d^2$.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes and prints this result.\n\n```python\n# Let 'd' represent the dimension of the qudit quantum system.\nd_symbol = 'd'\n\n# The maximal rank is d-squared.\n# The only explicit number in this formula is the exponent, which is 2.\nexponent = 2\n\n# Print the final answer and the numbers in its equation.\nprint(\"For a Pauli channel acting on a qudit of dimension 'd',\")\nprint(\"the maximal rank of its complementary channel is given by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Maximal Rank = {d_symbol} ** {exponent}\")\nprint(\"\\n# The numbers in the final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"The base is the symbolic dimension: '{d_symbol}'\")\nprint(f\"The exponent is: {exponent}\")\n```\n<<<d**2>>>"
