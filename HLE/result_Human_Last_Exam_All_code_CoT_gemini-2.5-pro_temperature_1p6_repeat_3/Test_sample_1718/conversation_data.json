    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will explain the properties of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold. A Kähler manifold has a complex structure, which imposes strong constraints on the curvature. Its real dimension, $n$, must be even, so we'll denote it as $n=2m$, where $m$ is the complex dimension.\n2.  I will explain how these constraints reduce the problem to counting the components of a specific type of tensor in complex coordinates, namely $R_{i\\bar{j}k\\bar{l}}$.\n3.  The symmetries of these components allow us to identify them with a Hermitian form on a related vector space.\n4.  The number of independent components is then the number of real parameters needed to define this Hermitian form, which follows a well-defined formula based on the dimension $m$. The formula is $(\\frac{m(m+1)}{2})^2$.\n5.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that calculates this value for a non-trivial example (complex dimension `m=2`, which corresponds to a real 4-dimensional manifold like a K3 surface) and prints out the full calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    for a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The real dimension of a Kähler manifold is even, n = 2m.\n    # We will use the complex dimension 'm' for the calculation.\n    # Let's calculate for a non-trivial example, a manifold of complex dimension m=2\n    # (i.e., a real 4-dimensional manifold).\n    m = 2\n\n    # The number of independent components is determined by the number of\n    # independent components of a Hermitian form on the space of symmetric\n    # (2,0)-tensors. The dimension of this space is N = m(m+1)/2.\n    N_dim_numerator = m * (m + 1)\n    N_dim = N_dim_numerator // 2\n\n    # The number of independent real components of an N x N Hermitian form is N^2.\n    result = N_dim ** 2\n\n    # As requested, we print each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension m = {m}:\")\n    print(\"The number of independent components is given by (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.\")\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    # Print the equation step-by-step\n    equation = f\"({m} * ({m} + 1) / 2)^2 = ({m} * {m+1} / 2)^2 = ({N_dim_numerator} / 2)^2 = ({N_dim})^2 = {result}\"\n    print(equation)\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
