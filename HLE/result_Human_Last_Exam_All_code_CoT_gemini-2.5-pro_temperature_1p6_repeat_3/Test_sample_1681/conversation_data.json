    "To find the quantum equilibrium for the Prisoner's Dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This involves setting up the game in a quantum framework, which can lead to new, more optimal equilibrium points compared to the classical version.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Game:** We start with the given payoff matrix: Cooperate-Cooperate (C,C) -> (5,5), Cooperate-Defect (C,D) -> (0,7), Defect-Cooperate (D,C) -> (7,0), and Defect-Defect (D,D) -> (1,1).\n2.  **Quantum Setup:**\n    *   **Initial State:** The crucial step is to start with a maximally entangled initial state. We will use the entangling operator `J = exp(i * (π/4) * σ_x ⊗ σ_x)` acting on the initial classical state `|CC>`, where `σ_x` is the Pauli-X matrix. This operator creates maximal entanglement between the players' qubits.\n    *   **Strategies:** The players' strategies are represented by unitary operators acting on their respective qubits. We will consider three key strategies:\n        *   **Cooperate (C):** The identity operator, `I`.\n        *   **Defect (D):** The quantum equivalent of defecting, represented by `D = -i * σ_y`.\n        *   **Quantum (Q):** A unique quantum strategy with no classical counterpart, represented by `Q = i * σ_z`.\n3.  **Calculate Payoffs:** The final state is determined by applying the players' strategy operators and then a disentangling operator `J†`. The expected payoff for each player is calculated based on the probabilities of measuring the final state in the classical basis `{|CC>, |CD>, |DC>, |DD>}`.\n4.  **Find Equilibrium:** We will calculate the payoffs for different strategy combinations to find the Nash Equilibrium. An equilibrium occurs when no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** We will write a Python script using `numpy` to perform the quantum calculations and demonstrate that the pair of Quantum strategies `(Q, Q)` forms a stable Nash Equilibrium, resolving the classical dilemma. The script will also explicitly show the final payoff calculation at this equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for a quantum Prisoner's Dilemma game.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
