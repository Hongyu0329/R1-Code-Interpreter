    # Analysis of Choice A
    print("\nChoice A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("  - Reasoning: CA thrives on raffinose (an RFO), while MA thrives on sucrose. This strongly implies CA is better at metabolizing RFOs.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")
    
    # Analysis of Choice B
    print("\nChoice B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("  - Reasoning: The text states they 'did well' on these respective diets, which indicates their preference or adaptation.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")
    
    # Analysis of Choice C
    print("\nChoice C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Reasoning: CA moves to a low-raffinose environment (cotton). Enzyme activity (galactosidase) is typically reduced when its substrate (raffinose) is scarce. This is a direct and fundamental biological principle.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")
    
    # Analysis of Choice D
    print("\nChoice D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Reasoning: This statement claims the same effect as C, but for a different reason. While high glucose (from sucrose) can sometimes inhibit enzymes for other sugars (a mechanism called catabolite repression), it's a less direct cause. The primary reason for decreased galactosidase activity would be the lack of its specific substrate, raffinose, as stated in C.")
    print("  - Verdict: As C provides the most direct and certain cause, this statement offering an alternative, less direct cause is the most likely candidate to be NOT TRUE.")

    # Analysis of Choice E
    print("\nChoice E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("  - Reasoning: MA moves to a high-raffinose environment (watermelon). To utilize this new food source, the aphid would likely increase the production/activity of the necessary enzyme (galactosidase). This is known as enzyme induction.")
    print("  - Verdict: Likely TRUE.")

    print("\nStep 3: Conclusion.")
    print("-----------------")
    print("Statements A, B, C, and E describe biologically sound and logical outcomes based on the provided text. Statement D describes a plausible outcome (decreased enzyme activity) but attributes it to a less direct cause than statement C. Since C offers the primary and most certain explanation, D is the statement that is most likely not true.")
