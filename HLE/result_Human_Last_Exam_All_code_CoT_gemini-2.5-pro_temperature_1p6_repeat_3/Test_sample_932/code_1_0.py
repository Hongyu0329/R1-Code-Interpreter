def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    Identifies insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be collected
    using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    The beat-sheet method collects insects that live on external foliage.
    The function filters a given list based on biological knowledge:
    1. Apis: Larvae are in hives. (Unlikely)
    2. Melipotini: Larvae are external foliage-feeding caterpillars. (Likely)
    3. Eupholini: Larvae are soil-dwelling root-feeders. (Unlikely)
    4. Acritini: Larvae are predators in decaying matter, not on foliage. (Unlikely)
    5. Oxyptilini: Larvae are often external foliage-feeding caterpillars. (Likely)
    6. Dictyophorini: Nymphs live on plants. (Likely)
    7. Acanthocerini: Larvae are wood-borers. (Unlikely)
