# The user wants to find the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables
# needed to parametrize the sigma-model for symmetry class D with 2 replicas.

# 1. Define the number of replicas provided in the problem.
n = 2

# 2. Calculate the dimension of the orthogonal part of the bosonic manifold.
# The manifold is O(4n)/(O(2n)xO(2n)).
# The dimension formula is q * (p-q) with p=4n and q=2n.
# So, dimension = (2n) * (4n - 2n) = (2n)*(2n) = 4n^2.
dim_orthogonal = 4 * n**2

# 3. Calculate the dimension of the symplectic part of the bosonic manifold.
# The manifold is Sp(4n)/(Sp(2n)xSp(2n)).
# The dimension is dim(Sp(4n)) - 2*dim(Sp(2n)).
# With dim(Sp(2k)) = k*(2k+1), this is 2n*(4n+1) - 2*n*(2n+1) = 4n^2.
dim_symplectic = 4 * n**2

# 4. The total number of variables is the sum of the two dimensions.
total_variables = dim_orthogonal + dim_symplectic

# 5. Print the explanation and the final equation.
