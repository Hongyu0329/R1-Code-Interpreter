    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimensionality of the bosonic sector of the relevant supersymmetric sigma-model manifold. This number corresponds to the count of non-Grassmann (i.e., real or complex number) variables required for its parametrization.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Symmetry Space**: For disordered systems of symmetry class D, the target manifold of the supersymmetric sigma-model with `n` replicas is the Riemannian symmetric superspace `O(4n|4n) / (O(2n|2n) × O(2n|2n))`. This structure incorporates the required retarded-advanced and replica indices.\n2.  **Isolate the Bosonic Sector**: The \"non-Grassman variables\" parametrize the purely bosonic part of this superspace. The bosonic part of a supergroup `O(p|q)` is `O(p) × Sp(q)`. Applying this rule, the bosonic sub-manifold `M_B` is given by:\n    `M_B = [O(4n) × Sp(4n)] / [(O(2n) × Sp(2n)) × (O(2n) × Sp(2n))]`\n    This can be separated into a product of two independent symmetric spaces:\n    `M_B = (O(4n) / (O(2n) × O(2n))) × (Sp(4n) / (Sp(2n) × Sp(2n)))`\n3.  **Calculate the Dimension**: The total number of variables is the dimension of `M_B`, which is the sum of the dimensions of the two factor spaces.\n    *   **Orthogonal Part**: The dimension of the symmetric space `O(p) / (O(q) × O(p-q))` is `q × (p-q)`. For our case, `p=4n` and `q=2n`, so the dimension is `(2n) × (4n-2n) = 4n²`.\n    *   **Symplectic Part**: The dimension of the symmetric space `Sp(2p) / (Sp(2q) × Sp(2(p-q)))` can be found by subtracting the dimensions of the Lie group algebras: `dim(Sp(2p)) - dim(Sp(2q)) - dim(Sp(2(p-q)))`. The dimension of the real symplectic group `Sp(2k)` is `k(2k+1)`. For our space `Sp(4n) / (Sp(2n) × Sp(2n))`, the dimension is `dim(Sp(4n)) - 2 × dim(Sp(2n))`. This evaluates to `2n(4n+1) - 2[n(2n+1)] = (8n² + 2n) - (4n² + 2n) = 4n²`.\n4.  **Sum and Substitute**: The total dimension is the sum of the two parts: `4n² + 4n² = 8n²`. We will substitute the given number of replicas, `n=2`, to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to find the number of non-Grassman (bosonic) variables\n# needed to parametrize the sigma-model for symmetry class D with 2 replicas.\n\n# 1. Define the number of replicas provided in the problem.\nn = 2\n\n# 2. Calculate the dimension of the orthogonal part of the bosonic manifold.\n# The manifold is O(4n)/(O(2n)xO(2n)).\n# The dimension formula is q * (p-q) with p=4n and q=2n.\n# So, dimension = (2n) * (4n - 2n) = (2n)*(2n) = 4n^2.\ndim_orthogonal = 4 * n**2\n\n# 3. Calculate the dimension of the symplectic part of the bosonic manifold.\n# The manifold is Sp(4n)/(Sp(2n)xSp(2n)).\n# The dimension is dim(Sp(4n)) - 2*dim(Sp(2n)).\n# With dim(Sp(2k)) = k*(2k+1), this is 2n*(4n+1) - 2*n*(2n+1) = 4n^2.\ndim_symplectic = 4 * n**2\n\n# 4. The total number of variables is the sum of the two dimensions.\ntotal_variables = dim_orthogonal + dim_symplectic\n\n# 5. Print the explanation and the final equation.\nprint(f\"The calculation is for n = {n} replicas in symmetry class D.\")\nprint(\"The total number of non-Grassman variables is the dimension of the bosonic target space,\")\nprint(\"which is composed of an orthogonal part and a symplectic part.\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of the orthogonal part (4 * n^2): 4 * {n}^2 = {dim_orthogonal}\")\nprint(f\"Dimension of the symplectic part (4 * n^2): 4 * {n}^2 = {dim_symplectic}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The total number of variables is the sum of these two dimensions.\")\nprint(\"Final Equation:\")\n# The request requires printing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"{dim_orthogonal} + {dim_symplectic} = {total_variables}\")\n\n```\n<<<32>>>"
