# This script calculates the total number of pas de Balanchines performed by 
# Svetlana Gileva in the Jete Woman solo from "In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated" (2015).

# The count is based on an analysis of the performance video.

# Count from the initial sequence.

# Calculate the total number of pas de Balanchines.
total_count = initial_sequence_count + transitional_sequence_count + final_sequence_count

# Output the breakdown of the count and the final equation.
