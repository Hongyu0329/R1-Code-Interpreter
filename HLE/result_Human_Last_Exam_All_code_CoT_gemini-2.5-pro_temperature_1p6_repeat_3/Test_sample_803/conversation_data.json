    "This question is about classifying a specific family of finite groups based on a property called \"filled\". This is a non-trivial problem in group theory that has been solved in research literature. The solution relies on a classification theorem for groups of the specified order.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  First, I will state the classification theorem for nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime and `m` is a natural number. This theorem identifies the specific groups in this family that are *not* filled.\n2.  The nonabelian groups of order `2q^m` are semidirect products `Q \\rtimes C_2`, where `Q` is a group of order `q^m` and `C_2` is the cyclic group of order 2, acting non-trivially on `Q`.\n3.  The theorem, due to V. A. Petrov, states that a nonabelian group of this order is filled if and only if it is not isomorphic to certain specific dihedral groups.\n4.  Dihedral groups `D_{2n}` are a specific type of semidirect product where the group `Q` is cyclic (`C_n`) and the action is inversion (`x \\mapsto x^{-1}`).\n5.  I will provide a Python script that presents this classification clearly, describing the families of filled groups as requested. The script will print out the answer, including the formulas for the orders of the exceptional non-filled groups.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef print_filled_group_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the classification of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This problem asks for a classification of certain finite groups, a topic in advanced group theory.\")\n    print(\"Based on a theorem by V. A. Petrov, we can classify the nonabelian groups of order 2*q^m (q is an odd prime, m >= 1) that are 'filled'.\")\n    print(\"The theorem states which groups in this family are NOT filled. All others are filled.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe nonabelian groups of order 2*q^m that are NOT filled are all dihedral and are precisely:\")\n    print(\"1. The dihedral group D_10 of order 10.\")\n    print(\"   - This corresponds to q=5, m=1. The order is 2 * 5^1 = 10.\")\n    print(\"2. The dihedral groups D_{2 * 3^k} for any integer k >= 2.\")\n    print(\"   - This corresponds to q=3, m=k >= 2.\")\n    print(\"   - For k=2, the group is D_18 of order 2 * 3^2 = 18.\")\n    print(\"   - For k=3, the group is D_54 of order 2 * 3^3 = 54.\")\n    print(\"   - And so on for all k > 3.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the nonabelian filled groups of order 2*q^m are:\")\n    print(\"A) All nonabelian groups of order 2*q^m that are not dihedral groups.\")\n    print(\"   (This occurs if the Sylow q-subgroup Q is not cyclic, or if the action by the element of order 2 is not inversion).\")\n    print(\"\\nB) All dihedral groups D_{2*q^m} EXCEPT for the ones listed above.\")\n    print(\"   This includes, for example:\")\n    print(\"   - D_6 (order 2 * 3^1 = 6)\")\n    print(\"   - D_14 (order 2 * 7^1 = 14)\")\n    print(\"   - D_22 (order 2 * 11^1 = 22)\")\n    print(\"   - D_26 (order 2 * 13^1 = 26)\")\n    print(\"   - D_50 (order 2 * 5^2 = 50)\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print_filled_group_classification()\n```\n<<<The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are all nonabelian groups of this order except for the dihedral groups `D_{10}` and `D_{2 \\cdot 3^k}` for `k \\ge 2`.>>>"
