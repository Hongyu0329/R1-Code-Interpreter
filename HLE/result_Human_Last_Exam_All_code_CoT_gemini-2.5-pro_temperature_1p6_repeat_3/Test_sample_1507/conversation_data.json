    "To solve this problem, we need to understand what the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron is. The outer-hull, or more formally, the convex hull, of a polyhedron is the smallest convex shape that contains it.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The vertices of a great icosahedron are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron.\n2.  Therefore, the convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n3.  The question \"What is the minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating the outer-hull?\" is equivalent to asking \"How many faces does a regular icosahedron have?\".\n4.  A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid, and its faces are already triangles.\n5.  We can use Euler's formula for polyhedra, `V - E + F = 2`, where `V` is the number of vertices, `E` is the number of edges, and `F` is the number of faces, to find the answer.\n6.  For a regular icosahedron, we know:\n    *   Number of vertices (V) = 12\n    *   Number of edges (E) = 30\n7.  By plugging these values into Euler's formula, we can calculate the number of faces (F), which corresponds to the number of visible triangles.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron shares its 12 vertices with the regular icosahedron.\n# Therefore, its convex hull (the \"outer-hull\") is a regular icosahedron.\n# We want to find the number of triangular faces on the surface of this regular icosahedron.\n\n# We can use Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = 2\n# V = number of vertices\n# E = number of edges\n# F = number of faces\n\n# For a regular icosahedron:\nV = 12  # Number of vertices\nE = 30  # Number of edges\n\n# We need to solve for F (the number of faces/triangles).\n# F = 2 - V + E\nF = 2 - V + E\n\n# Print the explanation and the result of the calculation.\nprint(\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"Using Euler's formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F):\")\nprint(f\"Given V = {V} and E = {E}\")\nprint(f\"The equation is: {V} - {E} + F = 2\")\nprint(f\"Solving for F: F = 2 - {V} + {E}\")\nprint(f\"The number of triangles is: {F}\")\n\n```\n<<<20>>>"
