The dance in which it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the European Tango.

Here is the reasoning:

1.  **Swing Dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep, Viennese Waltz):** These dances are characterized by continuous, flowing movement. They utilize principles like rise & fall, body sway, and pendulum swing. This creates a fluid motion that allows for rotation to be extended. While overturning a turn (turning more than the syllabus amount) is a technical fault, it is physically possible within the general mechanics of the dance. One can 'bleed' extra rotation into the next figure.

2.  **European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different. It is a "staccato" dance with no rise or fall and no body sway. Key characteristics include:
    *   **Action:** Sharp, precise, and clipped movements. Turns are not flowed but are instead executed with a quick, decisive action, often involving a head snap.
    *   **Footwork:** Feet are picked up and placed deliberately, not glided.
    *   **Frame:** The hold is very firm and compact, and the connection is used to lead sharp, directional changes.

Because of this unique technique, a Reverse Turn in Tango has a very specific and limited amount of rotation. To "overturn" it would mean introducing a continuous, swinging rotation, which would require abandoning the staccato action, the lack of rise and fall, and the precise foot placement that defines the Tango. You would have to disregard the entire technical foundation of the dance to achieve the extra turn, making it 'impossible' within the bounds of proper technique.

Therefore, the structure of the European Tango itself prevents overturning a figure like the Reverse Turn.
