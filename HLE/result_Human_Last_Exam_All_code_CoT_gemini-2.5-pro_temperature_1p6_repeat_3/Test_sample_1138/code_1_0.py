Here is a step-by-step analysis of the digital signature scheme question:

The question hinges on the term 'existentially forgeable' and the example of ECDSA. A standard, secure scheme like ECDSA should be existentially UNforgeable. However, ECDSA has a known property called 'malleability', which can be considered a type of existential forgery. Given a valid signature (r, s) for a message m, a new valid signature (r, n-s) for the same message m can be created without the secret key (where n is the curve order). This is a valid, new signature-message pair. We will proceed assuming this is why the question calls ECDSA 'existentially forgeable'.

Let's evaluate each option based on this understanding:

A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.
   - Analysis: This statement claims it is very hard to create a new signature for the same message. Due to the malleability `(r, s) -> (r, n-s)`, an adversary can easily accomplish this. The probability of success is 1, which is a non-negligible probability.
   - Conclusion: Statement A is FALSE.

B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.
   - Analysis: This statement refers to the difficulty of 'key recovery'. Signature malleability does not leak the secret key. The security of the key itself is based on the computational difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is believed to be hard. Therefore, an adversary's chance of finding the secret key remains negligible.
   - Conclusion: Statement B is TRUE.

C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.
   - Analysis: This asks if there is any scheme that is both existentially forgeable AND allows for forging signatures for any given message 'm' (this is known as selective or universal forgery). Consider a poorly designed scheme where the secret key can be trivially derived from the public key. An attacker could then sign any message 'm'. A scheme vulnerable to universal forgery is also, by definition, existentially forgeable (since being able to sign *any* message implies being able to sign *at least one*). Therefore, such schemes exist.
   - Conclusion: Statement C is TRUE.

D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.
   - Analysis: This claims that it's always hard to recover the message from the signature. However, a signature's purpose is authenticity, not confidentiality. It's possible to design a signature scheme where the message is appended to the signature itself, e.g., Sign'(sk, m) = (ECDSA_Sign(sk, H(m)), m). This scheme is still existentially forgeable (due to the ECDSA part), but the message 'm' is trivially retrievable from the signature. Since the claim is for 'all' schemes, this one counterexample is enough to disprove it.
   - Conclusion: Statement D is FALSE.

Summary:
- Statement A: False
- Statement B: True
- Statement C: True
- Statement D: False

Since both statements B and C are true, more than one option is true.
