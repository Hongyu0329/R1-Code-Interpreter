    "For a multi-color flow cytometry experiment, it's crucial to prepare a set of controls to ensure the instrument is set up correctly and the data is properly compensated for spectral overlap. Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the essential controls needed for your 5-channel experiment using streptavidin beads.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Unlabeled Control:** The first essential control is a tube containing only the streptavidin beads without any fluorochromes. This sample is used to assess the autofluorescence of the beads and to set the baseline voltage for your detectors. This counts as **1** control.\n2.  **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** For every fluorochrome in your panel, you need a separate control tube containing beads stained with just that single color. These controls are absolutely essential for the software to calculate the compensation matrix, which corrects for the spectral spillover from one fluorochrome into another's detector. Since you have five detection channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750), you will need **5** single-stain controls.\n3.  **Total Calculation:** The total number of essential controls is the sum of the unlabeled control and the single-stain controls.\n\nThe following Python script calculates this total and prints the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n\n    This script determines the minimum number of controls required for instrument setup\n    and spectral compensation for a 5-color sorting experiment using beads.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of different fluorochromes being used in the experiment.\n    num_fluorochromes = 5\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1.

Single-Stain Compensation Controls:\n    # One control is needed for each fluorochrome to calculate the compensation matrix\n    # and correct for spectral overlap.\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # Calculate the total number of essential controls.\n    total_essential_controls = unlabeled_beads_control + single_stain_controls\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final result.\n    print(\"Essential Controls for a 5-Color Streptavidin Bead Sorting Experiment:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n    print(f\"1.
