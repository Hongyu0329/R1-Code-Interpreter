    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of a piecewise function, $p(x)$, over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe integral can be split into two parts corresponding to the function's definition:\n1.  The integral of $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ from $x=0$ to $x=3$.\n2.  The integral of $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$ from $x=3$ to $x=4$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define Python Functions**: I will define two separate Python functions, one for each piece of the main function $p(x)$.\n2.  **Use Numerical Integration**: I will use the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library to numerically compute the definite integral for each part over its respective interval.\n3.  **Sum the Results**: I will add the results of the two integrals to find the total integral from 0 to 4.\n4.  **Print the Calculation**: The final script will print the values for each of the two integrals and then show the final sum, making the calculation process clear.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef p1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the function p(x) for the interval 0 <= x <= 3.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\ndef p2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the function p(x) for the interval 3 <= x <= 5.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# The integral is split at x=3\n# Part 1: Integral from 0 to 3\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# Part 2: Integral from 3 to 4\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\nprint(f\"The integral from x = 0 to x = 3 is calculated as: {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"The integral from x = 3 to x = 4 is calculated as: {integral2}\")\nprint(f\"The total integral from x = 0 to x = 4 is the sum of these two parts.\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.46421041935515>>>"
