    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n1.  **Understand Wallpaper Groups and Point Groups**: First, I need to understand the definitions. Wallpaper groups are the 17 possible two-dimensional repeating patterns. The point group of a wallpaper group consists of the symmetries (rotations, reflections) that leave at least one point fixed.\n2.  **Identify Point Groups of Order 2**: A group of order 2 has two symmetry operations: the identity operation and one other. For 2D point groups, this means either a 180-degree rotation (C2) or a single reflection (D1 or Cm).\n3.  **List and Filter Wallpaper Groups**: I will create a data structure containing all 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their respective point groups.\n4.  **Count and Display**: I will then iterate through this data to filter and count the groups where the point group order is exactly 2.\n5.  **Generate Code**: Finally, I will write a Python script to perform this counting and display the names of the relevant groups and the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups that have a point group of a specific order.\n    It then prints the names of these groups and the final count as a sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point group.\n    # Data is in the format: ('group_name', point_group_order)\n    wallpaper_groups_data = {\n        'p1': 1,\n        'p2': 2,\n        'pm': 2,\n        'pg': 2,\n        'cm': 2,\n        'p2mm': 4,\n        'p2mg': 4,\n        'p2gg': 4,\n        'c2mm': 4,\n        'p3': 3,\n        'p3m1': 6,\n        'p31m': 6,\n        'p4': 4,\n        'p4mm': 8,\n        'p4gm': 8,\n        'p6': 6,\n        'p6mm': 12\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Find the wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2\n    found_groups = []\n    for group_name, order in wallpaper_groups_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group_name)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    for group in found_groups:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n    \n    count = len(found_groups)\n    \n    # Create the summation string as requested\n    sum_equation = \" + \".join(['1'] * count)\n\n    print(f\"\\nIn total, there are {count} such groups.\")\n    print(f\"This can be represented as the sum: {sum_equation} = {count}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
