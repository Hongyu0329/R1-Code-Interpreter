    "Based on my research, the premise of your question contains a factual inaccuracy. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is the name of the former President of Nigeria. Nnamdi Azikiwe was the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record or credible source suggesting that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has ever added \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identified himself as such. The two are distinct historical figures.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not occur. I can, however, provide a script that clarifies this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_history():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's question about when Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\n    publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_a = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    person_b = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    print(f\"The user is asking for the year {person_a} publicly identified as Azikiwe.\")\n    print(\"\\nAfter a thorough review of historical records, here is the finding:\")\n    print(f\"1. {person_a} was a President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(f\"2. {person_b} was the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(\"\\nThere is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself by or adding the name 'Azikiwe' to his own.\")\n    print(\"The question is based on a mistaken premise, likely confusing two different Nigerian leaders.\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: The event never happened, so there is no year to provide.\")\n\ncheck_name_history()\n```\n<<<Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. This is a confusion between two different former presidents of Nigeria: Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe. Therefore, there is no such year.>>>"
