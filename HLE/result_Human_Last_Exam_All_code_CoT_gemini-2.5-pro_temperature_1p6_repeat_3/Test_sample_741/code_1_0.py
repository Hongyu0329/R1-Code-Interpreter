# The given summation is S(x) = sum_{i=0 to inf} 1 / ((x + i - 1)! * i!).
# Using the Gamma function, the summation can be identified as a known special function.
# S(x) is equivalent to the modified Bessel function of the first kind, I_{x-1}(2).
# We are looking for the largest value of x for which the sum is 0.
# This means we need to solve the equation I_{x-1}(2) = 0 for the largest x.
# Let v = x - 1. The problem is to find the largest root v of the equation I_v(2) = 0.
# The roots of I_v(2)=0 with respect to v are all real and negative. We need to find the largest one (closest to zero).
# We use a numerical solver from SciPy to find this root.
# Based on preliminary analysis, the largest root lies in the interval [-2.2, -2.1].
