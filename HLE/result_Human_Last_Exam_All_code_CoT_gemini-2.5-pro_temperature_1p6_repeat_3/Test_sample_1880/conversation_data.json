    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for determining the Galois group of a quartic polynomial.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Check for irreducibility:** We'll first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Eisenstein's criterion is a good candidate here. An irreducible quartic polynomial has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  **Compute the discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps determine if the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group, $A_4$. The group is a subgroup of $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Construct and analyze the resolvent cubic:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides more information to narrow down the possible group structures.\n4.  **Final determination:** Based on the results from the previous steps, we will perform a final test to distinguish between the remaining possible groups (in this case, $D_4$ and $C_4$). This test involves checking for the reducibility of the original polynomial over an extension field related to the discriminant.\n\nThe following Python script will perform the necessary calculations for each step and print the logic along the way.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_square_free(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the square-free part of a positive integer.\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return n\n    i = 2\n    sf = 1\n    # Factor out powers of 2\n    count = 0\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= 2\n    if count % 2 == 1:\n        sf *= 2\n    # Factor out powers of odd primes\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        count = 0\n        while n % i == 0:\n            count += 1\n            n //= i\n        if count % 2 == 1:\n            sf *= i\n        i += 2\n    if n > 1:\n        sf *= n\n    return sf\n\ndef solve_galois_quartic():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For f(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d\n    # Our polynomial is x^4 + 8x + 14\n    a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 8, 14\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {c}x + {d}\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n    # Step 1: Irreducibility\n    print(\"Step 1: Check irreducibility over Q\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\" - p=2 does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\")\n    print(f\" - p=2 divides the other coefficients ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d}).\")\n    print(f\" - p^2=4 does not divide the constant term ({d}).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group G is a transitive subgroup of S4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\")\n    # For a depressed quartic x^4 + cx + d, Delta = -27*c^4 + 256*d^3\n    delta = -27 * (c**4) + 256 * (d**3)\n    print(f\"The discriminant is Delta = -27 * ({c}^4) + 256 * ({d}^3) = {delta}\")\n    \n    sqrt_delta_int = math.isqrt(delta)\n    if sqrt_delta_int**2 == delta:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {delta} is a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group G is a subgroup of A4 (A4 or V4).\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The discriminant {delta} is not a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group G is not a subgroup of A4.\")\n        print(\"Possible groups: S4, D4, or C4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Resolvent Cubic\n    print(\"Step 3: Form and analyze the resolvent cubic R(y)\")\n    # For x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d, R(y) = y^3 - b*y^2 + (ac-4d)*y - (a^2*d-4bd+c^2)\n    p0 = c3 = 1\n    p1 = -b\n    p2 = a*c - 4*d\n    p3 = -(a**2 * d - 4*b*d + c**2)\n    print(f\"The resolvent cubic is R(y) = y^3 + ({p1})y^2 + ({p2})y + ({p3})\")\n\n    # Find rational roots of R(y)\n    rational_roots = []\n    # Test integer divisors of the constant term p3\n    for r in range(1, abs(p3) + 1):\n        if p3 % r == 0:\n            for root_candidate in [r, -r]:\n                if p0*root_candidate**3 + p1*root_candidate**2 + p2*root_candidate + p3 == 0:\n                    if root_candidate not in rational_roots:\n                        rational_roots.append(root_candidate)\n\n    if not rational_roots:\n        print(\"The resolvent cubic has no rational roots, so it is irreducible over Q.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group G is S4.\")\n        order = 24\n    else:\n        print(f\"The resolvent cubic is reducible over Q, with rational root(s): {rational_roots}\")\n        print(\"The Galois group G is not S4.
