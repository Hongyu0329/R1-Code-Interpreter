    The trp operon's transcription is fine-tuned by attenuation. The leader RNA (trpL) has four regions.
    
    - In HIGH Tryptophan: The ribosome moves quickly over the trpL gene, covering region 2. This prevents region 2 from pairing with region 3. As a result, region 3 pairs with the newly transcribed region 4, forming a 3-4 terminator stem-loop. This structure, followed by a U-rich sequence, terminates transcription.
    
    - In LOW Tryptophan: The ribosome stalls at Trp codons in region 1 because charged tRNA-Trp is scarce. This stall allows region 2 to pair with region 3, forming a 2-3 anti-terminator loop. This prevents the 3-4 terminator from forming, and transcription continues into the structural genes.
