    "To determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Luxor Obelisks:** There are two such obelisks. One is in Luxor, Egypt, and the other, its twin, stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. A film depicting either location would qualify.\n2.  **Analyze Best Picture Winners Chronologically:** I will examine the list of Academy Award winners for Best Picture, starting from the first ceremony, and check their settings.\n3.  **Cross-Reference Film Settings:**\n    *   Films set in Egypt will be checked for scenes in Luxor.\n    *   Films set in Paris will be checked for scenes at the Place de la Concorde.\n4.  **Pinpoint the First Film:** The earliest film on the winners' list that contains a confirmed depiction of either obelisk will be the answer.\n\n*   Early winners like *Wings* (1927/28) and *The Life of Emile Zola* (1937) are set partially in Paris, but a review of their scenes and the production methods of the era makes a clear shot of the Place de la Concorde unlikely, with no definitive evidence found.\n*   The 1951 winner, ***An American in Paris***, is a strong candidate. The film is famous for its 17-minute final ballet sequence, which is a visual celebration of Parisian landmarks. This sequence explicitly features a stylized representation of the Place de la Concorde, with its prominent Luxor Obelisk.\n*   The 1956 winner, ***Around the World in 80 Days***, also features the obelisk during on-location shots in Paris.\n*   No Best Picture winner set in Egypt, such as *Lawrence of Arabia* (1962) or *The English Patient* (1996), contains scenes at the Luxor Temple itself.\n\nBased on this chronological review, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner with a confirmed on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk. The following Python script will present this information.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. State the name of the movie.\n# 2. State which Academy Awards ceremony it won.\n# 3. State the year the film was awarded Best Picture.\n# 4. State the specific Luxor Obelisk that was depicted.\n# 5. Print the details.\n\nmovie_title = \"An American in Paris\"\naward_ceremony_number = 24\naward_year = 1952 # For the film year 1951\nobelisk_location = \"The Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\"\n\nprint(f\"The first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk was '{movie_title}'.\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the details:\")\nprint(f\"Movie Title: {movie_title}\")\nprint(f\"Award Ceremony: The {award_ceremony_number}th Academy Awards\")\nprint(f\"Year of Win: {award_year}\")\nprint(f\"Obelisk Depicted: {obelisk_location}\")\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
