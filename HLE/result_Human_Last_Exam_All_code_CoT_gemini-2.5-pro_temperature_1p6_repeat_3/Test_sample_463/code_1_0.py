# Plan:
# 1. Identify all organisms from the list that are capable of phototrophy (using light for metabolic energy).
# 2. This includes oxygenic photosynthesis (plants, algae, cyanobacteria), anoxygenic photosynthesis (certain bacteria), and retinal-based phototrophy (certain archaea).
# 3. Exclude all animals (heterotrophs) and organisms from aphotic zones.
# 4. Homo sapiens is excluded because Vitamin D synthesis is not a primary metabolic energy pathway (i.e., not a form of phototrophy).
# 5. Compile the list of indices for the qualifying organisms.
# 6. Print the comma-separated indices.

# Analysis of each taxon:
# 1) Acanthella cavernosa: Animal (sponge). No.
# 2) Gloeochaete wittrockiana: Green alga. Yes, performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
# 3) Homo sapiens: Animal. No, not a phototroph.
# 4) Riftia pachyptila: Animal (tube worm), lives at deep-sea vents (no light). No.
# 5) Halapricum salinum: Archaea. Yes, uses retinal-based phototrophy (bacteriorhodopsin).
# 6) Aphanothece castagnei: Cyanobacterium. Yes, performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
# 7) Baileya pleniradiata: Plant. Yes, performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
# 8) Acanthella pulchra: Animal (sponge). No.
# 9) Ectothiorhodosinus mongolicus: Purple sulfur bacterium. Yes, performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
# 10) Chlorobaculum tepidum: Green sulfur bacterium. Yes, performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
# 11) Stygichthys typhlops: Animal (cavefish), lives in caves (no light). No.
# 12) Gemmatimonas phototrophica: Bacterium. Yes, performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
# 13) Myonera garretti: Animal (bivalve). No.

# Final list of indices: 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12
