    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will combine the two integrals into a single integral, since they share the same denominator and integration limits.\n2.  Next, I will simplify the resulting integral by performing a substitution, letting `t = 1-x`. This will make the integrand much cleaner.\n3.  The core of the solution is to find the antiderivative of the simplified integrand. I'll demonstrate that the antiderivative is of the form `F(t) = A * t^2 * (3*t^8 - 4*t^4 + 6)^(1/4)`. I will determine the constant `A`.\n4.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral, which we'll call `I`, by computing `F(1) - F(0)`.\n5.  Finally, I will substitute the calculated value of `I` back into the original expression `(12)^4 * I^4` and compute the final numerical answer.\n6.  The Python code will print out each of these steps clearly, showing how the final value is derived.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_and_explain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the given mathematical expression and prints the step-by-step solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Combine the integrals\n    print(\"Step 1: Combine the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"The expression is (12)^4 * (I_1 - I_2)^4, where I_1 and I_2 are the two integrals.\")\n    print(\"Since the integrals have the same limits and denominator, we can combine them:\")\n    integral_str = \"I = integral from 0 to 1 of ((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x) / ((3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4)) dx\"\n    print(integral_str)\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Simplify the integral with substitution\n    print(\"Step 2: Simplify the integral using substitution.\")\n    print(\"Let t = 1 - x.
