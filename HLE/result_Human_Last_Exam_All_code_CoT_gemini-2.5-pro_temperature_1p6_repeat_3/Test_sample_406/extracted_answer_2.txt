The conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an FGH-tripled fixed point require that the sets X, Y, and Z are complete metric spaces and that the functions F, G, and H satisfy a set of specific contractive inequalities. The sum of the coefficients from these inequalities must result in an overall contraction factor k that is strictly less than 1, as detailed in the provided script's final equation.
