    "This problem belongs to the field of fixed-point theory in mathematics. The conditions for the existence of such a fixed point are typically given by a theorem that generalizes the famous Banach Fixed-Point Theorem to a system of operators on product spaces.\n\nBefore proceeding, I'll clarify two apparent typos in the problem statement for the functions and fixed-point equations. I will assume the intended formulation is:\n*   Functions: `F: X*Y*Z -> X`, `G: Y*X*Y -> Y`, and **`H`**`: Z*Y*X -> Z`\n*   Fixed Point: A triplet `(x, y, z)` such that `F(x,y,z) = x`, `G(y,x,y) = y`, and **`H`**`(z,y,x) = z`.\nThis is a standard formulation for a \"tripled fixed point\" problem involving three distinct functions.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that explains the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of such an FGH-tripled fixed point. The script will not execute a numerical computation but will use `print` statements to clearly outline the mathematical theorem and its required conditions, including the final inequality involving the contraction constants. This approach uses coding to present the solution, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef explain_fgh_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the conditions for the existence and uniqueness of an\n    FGH-tripled fixed point based on the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Use Unicode for clarity if the terminal supports it\n    use_unicode = sys.stdout.encoding.lower().startswith('utf')\n    \n    # Symbolic constants\n    a1, a2, a3 = (\"α₁\", \"α₂\", \"α₃\") if use_unicode else (\"a1\", \"a2\", \"a3\")\n    b1, b2, b3 = (\"β₁\", \"β₂\", \"β₃\") if use_unicode else (\"b1\", \"b2\", \"b3\")\n    g1, g2, g3 = (\"γ₁\", \"γ₂\", \"γ₃\") if use_unicode else (\"g1\", \"g2\", \"g3\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Conditions for an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point ---\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the mathematical space and functions\n    print(\"Step 1: The Setting\")\n    print(\"1.
