    "Here is my plan to address your request.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The request asks if Gödel's ontological proof for the existence of \"god-like entities\" can be proven using the mathematics of quantum mechanics (QM).\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Frameworks:**\n    *   **Gödel's Proof:** This proof is rooted in a highly abstract field called **modal logic** (specifically, S5) and **higher-order logic**. It deals with axioms about properties, possibility, and necessity. Its terms include \"positive properties,\" \"essence,\" and \"necessary existence.\"\n    *   **Quantum Mechanics:** The mathematical framework of QM is primarily **linear algebra over complex numbers**. It uses concepts like Hilbert spaces (infinite-dimensional vector spaces), linear operators (like the Hamiltonian), eigenvectors, and eigenvalues to describe the state and observables of a physical system.\n3.  **Compare the Frameworks:** The two mathematical languages are fundamentally different and designed to describe completely different domains. Gödel's proof is a statement in formal logic about metaphysics. The mathematics of QM is a framework for modeling the probabilistic behavior of physical energy and matter. There is no established dictionary or translation method to map the axioms of one onto the postulates of the other. Attempting to prove a theorem of modal logic using linear algebra is like trying to prove the Pythagorean theorem using only the rules of grammar.\n4.  **Formulate the Code:** Since a direct proof is not possible, the code will serve as an illustration of this disconnect.\n    *   The Python script will symbolically define the key concepts from both domains (Gödel's axioms and QM's postulates).\n    *   It will then explicitly state that no function or operator exists to connect them.\n    *   To satisfy the unusual constraint to \"output each number in the final equation,\" the script will construct a symbolic, conceptual \"equation\" representing this impossible mapping. It will then print the identifiers (e.g., 'A1' for Axiom 1, 'P1' for Postulate 1) of the elements involved. This fulfills the request in a metaphorical sense.\n    *   The script's final output will clearly state the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_proof_compatibility():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the feasibility of proving Gödel's ontological proof\n    using the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    godel_axioms = {\n        \"A1\": \"A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive.\",\n        \"A2\": \"A property is positive if it necessarily contains a positive property.\",\n        \"T1\": \"Positive properties are possibly exemplified.\",\n        \"A3\": \"The property of being God-like is a positive property.\",\n        \"A4\": \"If a property is positive, then it is necessarily positive.\",\n        \"D1\": \"A being has the property of being God-like if it possesses all positive properties.\",\n        \"D2\": \"A property is the essence of a being if it possesses that property and it is a necessary property.\",\n        \"A5\": \"Necessary existence is a positive property.\"\n    }\n\n    qm_postulates = {\n        \"P1\": \"The state of a quantum system is described by a state vector in a complex Hilbert space.\",\n        \"P2\": \"Observable quantities are represented by Hermitian operators on that Hilbert space.\",\n        \"P3\": \"The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator.\",\n        \"P4\": \"The probability of measuring a given eigenvalue is given by the Born rule.\",\n        \"P5\": \"The time evolution of the state vector is governed by the Schrödinger equation.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the conceptual domains.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Domain 1: Gödel's Ontological Proof (Modal Logic)\")\n    print(\"Domain 2: Quantum Mechanics (Linear Algebra, Hilbert Spaces)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Assess the mapping between domains.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    Gödel's proof is formulated in modal logic and higher-order logic.
