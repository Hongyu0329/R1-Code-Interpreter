    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert them from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color cannot be represented if it falls outside the sRGB gamut. We can check this by seeing if any of its linear sRGB components (R, G, or B) are outside the valid range of [0, 1].\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Color Space Conversion**: The conversion from a source RGB color space to a destination RGB color space is done in a linear color space (XYZ) and involves a few steps:\n    *   Convert the source ROMM RGB value to the CIE XYZ color space. ROMM RGB values are assumed to be linear.\n    *   Apply a chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) because ROMM RGB uses a D50 white point, while sRGB uses a D65 white point.\n    *   Convert the adapted XYZ value to the linear sRGB color space.\n2.  **Matrix Multiplication**: These three steps can be combined into a single 3x3 transformation matrix. We will multiply the input ROMM RGB vector by this matrix to get the resulting linear sRGB vector.\n3.  **Gamut Check**: For each resulting linear sRGB color `(R, G, B)`, we will check if all components are within the range `[0, 1]`. If any component is less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is \"out of gamut\" and cannot be represented in sRGB.\n4.  **Identify and Report**: We'll identify the numbers of the colors that are out of gamut and present them in ascending order.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It constructs the transformation matrix from established color science constants and applies it to each color to check its representability in the sRGB space.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines which ROMM RGB color values are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
