    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question**: The user wants to know the most likely mechanism for the *retention* (keeping both copies) and *divergence* (the two copies becoming different) of duplicated genes.\n\n2.  **Define a Data Structure**: I will create a Python dictionary to represent the answer choices. For each choice, I will store a description and two boolean flags:\n    *   `retains_both_copies`: Is this mechanism known for keeping both gene copies functional in the genome?\n    *   `promotes_divergence`: Does this mechanism cause the gene copies to become different from each other?\n\n3.  **Filter the Options**: I will write a script that iterates through these options and applies a logical filter. The correct mechanism must satisfy both conditions: `retains_both_copies` must be `True` AND `promotes_divergence` must be `True`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Filtered Results**: The filter will eliminate options A, B, and E, leaving C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization) as the valid models.\n\n5.  **Select the \"Most Likely\" Mechanism**: Both C and D are correct and important models. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" one. I will add a final logical step in the code to choose between them. Subfunctionalization is often considered a more probable *initial* outcome because it is driven by common loss-of-function mutations, which are much more frequent than the rare, specific gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. This makes it a very powerful and likely mechanism for initially preserving duplicate genes from being lost.\n\n6.  **Generate the Output**: The script will print its entire reasoning process, explaining why each option is accepted or rejected, and will state the final conclusion clearly.\n\nThis approach uses code to apply biological principles systematically to arrive at the most plausible answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes potential fates of duplicate genes to identify the most likely\n    mechanism for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mechanisms and their properties based on evolutionary biology principles.\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Gene conversion',\n            'description': 'A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, making them identical.',\n            'retains_both_copies': True,\n            'promotes_divergence': False # This process homogenizes genes, working against divergence.\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Pseudogenization',\n            'description': 'A process where one gene copy accumulates disabling mutations and becomes non-functional.',\n            'retains_both_copies': False, # One copy is functionally lost.\n            'promotes_divergence': True # The pseudogene diverges rapidly due to lack of selective pressure.\n        },\n        'C': {\n            'name': 'Neofunctionalization',\n            'description': 'One gene copy retains the original function, while the other acquires a new function through mutation.',\n            'retains_both_copies': True,\n            'promotes_divergence': True\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'Subfunctionalization',\n            'description': 'The ancestral gene had multiple functions, and each duplicate copy specializes by losing different subfunctions.',\n            'retains_both_copies': True,\n            'promotes_divergence': True\n        },\n        'E': {\n            'name': 'Adaptive radiation',\n            'description': 'A macroevolutionary process of rapid diversification of a lineage into new species.',\n            'retains_both_copies': None, # Not a mechanism at the gene level.\n            'promotes_divergence': None  # Not a mechanism at the gene level.\n        }\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the fates of a duplicated gene...\\n\")\n    print(\"The goal is to find a mechanism that leads to both RETENTION and DIVERGENCE.\\n\")\n    \n    valid_mechanisms = []\n    \n    # Step 2: Filter the mechanisms based on the criteria.\n    for key, data in mechanisms.items():\n        print(f\"--- Checking Option {key}: {data['name']} ---\")\n        wrapped_desc = \"\\n\".join(textwrap.wrap(f\"Description: {data['description']}\", width=70))\n        print(wrapped_desc)\n        \n        if data['retains_both_copies'] is None:\n            print(\"Result: REJECTED.
