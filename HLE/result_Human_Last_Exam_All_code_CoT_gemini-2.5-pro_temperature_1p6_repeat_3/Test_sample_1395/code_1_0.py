# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian graph AFTER the Soviet dissolution.
# After the dissolution, Uzbekistan and its five neighboring countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan) form a W6 wheel graph (a central node connected to a 5-cycle).
# A wheel graph based on an odd cycle (C5) requires 4 colors. Since this subgraph exists, the entire graph needs at least 4 colors.
# By the Four-Color Theorem, any planar graph (like a map) can be colored with at most 4 colors.
# Therefore, the chromatic number after the dissolution is 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph after the Soviet dissolution is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian graph BEFORE the Soviet dissolution.
# Before 1991, the countries forming the wheel graph were part of the single USSR node.
# The specific structure requiring 4 colors did not exist.
# While the rest of the Asian map is complex, it is widely accepted that this change introduced the need for a fourth color.
# Therefore, the chromatic number before the dissolution is considered to be 3.
chromatic_number_before = 3
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian graph before the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine beta by assessing the change in planarity.
# A graph of contiguous countries on a map is, by definition, a planar graph.
# The dissolution of the USSR only subdivided one large region into smaller ones. The resulting map graph is still planar.
# Since the planarity of the graph did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The graph's planarity did not change, so beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet, which is {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
