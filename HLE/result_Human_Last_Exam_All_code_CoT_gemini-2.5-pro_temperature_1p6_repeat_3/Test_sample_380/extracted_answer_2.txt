The justification for using a radial-based coordinate system to calculate magnetic helicity at L1, despite AIC waves propagating along the non-radial local magnetic field, is Taylor's "Frozen-in Flow" Hypothesis. The solar wind's high radial velocity is much greater than the wave's propagation speed in the plasma frame, causing wave structures to be advected past a spacecraft as if they were frozen in space. This allows a time series measurement to be interpreted as a one-dimensional spatial cut along the radial direction, making the analysis of field components perpendicular to the radial flow a standard, convenient, and well-justified method for statistical studies.
