    "Of course, I can help you solve this. Here is my plan to find the separatrix for the given system of differential equations:\n\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** A separatrix often connects or originates from special points in the phase plane called equilibrium points. These are points where the system is stationary, i.e., where both $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ are zero.\n2.  **Identify Saddle Points:** We will classify the equilibrium points by linearizing the system. The behavior of trajectories near these points is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix. A saddle point, which has both positive and negative real-part eigenvalues, is crucial because its stable and unstable manifolds act as separatrices.\n3.  **Determine the Manifolds:** The separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds corresponding to the saddle point. These are special trajectories that either approach the saddle point (stable manifold) or are repelled from it (unstable manifold) as time evolves.\n4.  **Find the Equation:** I will find an analytical expression for the unstable manifold of the saddle point. I'll do this by looking for an invariant function $H(u,d)$ such that the curve $H(u,d)=0$ is a trajectory of the system. This curve, passing through the saddle point, will be our separatrix.\n\nBased on this plan, I have derived the equation for the separatrix. The following Python code will print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# The system of differential equations is:\n# d'(t) = 2*d(t)**2 + (-3*u(t) + 5*u(t)**2)*d(t) - u(t)*(1-u(t))*u(t)**2\n# u'(t) = (u(t)-1)*u(t)**2\n\n# Step 1: Find equilibrium points by setting d'(t)=0 and u'(t)=0.\n# u'(t) = 0 gives u=0 or u=1.\n# If u=0, d'(t)=0 gives 2*d**2 = 0, so d=0. Point: (0, 0).\n# If u=1, d'(t)=0 gives 2*d**2 + 2*d = 0, so d=0 or d=-1. Points: (1, 0) and (1, -1).\n\n# Step 2: Classify the equilibrium points. The point (1, -1) is a saddle point.\n# A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behavior.\n# The stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point are separatrices.\n\n# Step 3 & 4: Find the equation for the unstable manifold of the saddle point (1,-1).\n# We search for an invariant curve of the form d = f(u).\n# By analyzing the system, we can find a function H(u,d) = d + u**2.\n# The time derivative of H is dH/dt = (2*d + 3*u**2 - 3*u) * H.\n# This means that if a trajectory starts on the curve H=0, it stays on that curve.\n# The equation H(u,d) = 0 gives d + u**2 = 0, or d = -u**2.\n# This curve passes through the saddle point (1, -1) and the equilibrium (0, 0).\n# This curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and is a separatrix of the system.\n\n# The following code prints the equation of this separatrix.\n# The equation is of the form: d = c * u^p\n\n# Define the variables and parameters for the equation of the separatrix\ndependent_var = \"d\"\nindependent_var = \"u\"\ncoefficient = -1\npower = 2\n\n# Print the final equation\nprint(\"The equation of the separatrix is:\")\n# We use string formatting to construct and print the equation.\n# The numbers in the equation, -1 and 2, are explicitly handled by variables.\nequation = f\"{dependent_var} = {coefficient} * {independent_var}**{power}\"\nprint(equation)\n\n```\n<<<d = -1 * u**2>>>"
