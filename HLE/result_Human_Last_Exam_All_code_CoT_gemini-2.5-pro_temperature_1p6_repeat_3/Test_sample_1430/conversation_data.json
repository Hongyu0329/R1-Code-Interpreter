    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem**: We are given a genus `g=3` Riemann surface `C`, and its 15th symmetric power `X = Sym^15(C)`. We need to find the minimum and maximum possible rank of its Néron-Severi group, `rho(X)`.\n\n2.  **Use the Fibration Structure**: For a degree `n` large enough (`n > 2g - 2`), the symmetric power `Sym^n(C)` has the structure of a fibration over the Jacobian variety `J(C)` of the curve `C`. The fibers of this map are projective spaces `P^(n-g)`.\n    *   In our case, `g=3` and `n=15`. The condition `15 > 2*3 - 2 = 4` holds.\n    *   Thus, `X = Sym^15(C)` is a `P^(15-3) = P^12` fibration over `J(C)`.\n\n3.  **Relate the Ranks**: For such a projective bundle structure, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the total space `X` is the sum of the ranks of the base and the fiber.\n    *   `rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + rho(P^12)`\n    *   The rank of the Néron-Severi group of any projective space `P^k` is 1.\n    *   Therefore, we get the key formula: `rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Find the Range for `rho(J(C))`**: The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for `rho(J(C))`, the rank of the Néron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve.\n\n5.  **Smallest Rank**: The rank `rho(J(C))` is always at least 1, because the polarization class (the theta divisor) is always present. For a *generic* or *general* curve `C` (one without special properties), the Néron-Severi group has this minimal rank. So, `min rho(J(C)) = 1`.\n\n6.  **Largest Rank**: The rank `rho(J(C))` is bounded by the Hodge number `h^(1,1)(J(C))`, which for a `g`-dimensional Jacobian is `g^2`.\n    *   For `g=3`, `rho(J(C)) <= 3^2 = 9`.\n    *   This maximum rank is achieved for very special curves known as curves with Complex Multiplication (CM). An example of such a curve is the Fermat curve `x^4 + y^4 = 1`, whose Jacobian has the maximum number of endomorphisms, leading to `rho(J(C)) = 9`. So, `max rho(J(C)) = 9`.\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**: Using the formula from step 3, we can now calculate the smallest and largest ranks for `rho(X)`.\n    *   Smallest rank: `min rho(X) = min rho(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Largest rank: `max rho(X) = max rho(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10`.\n\nThis logic will be implemented in the following Python script.\n\n```python\n#\n# This script calculates the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Neron-Severi\n# group for the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n#\n\n# Genus of the Riemann surface C\ng = 3\n\n# Degree of the symmetric power X = Sym^n(C)\nn = 15\n\nprint(\"Problem: Find the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X = Sym^15(C), where C is a genus 3 curve.\")\nprint(f\"Let g be the genus of C, g = {g}.\")\nprint(f\"Let n be the degree of the symmetric power, n = {n}.\")\n\n# Step 1: Use the relationship between the Neron-Severi ranks for a symmetric power\n# and the Jacobian of the curve.\n# For n > 2*g - 2, we have the formula: rho(Sym^n(C)) = rho(J(C)) + 1.\n# Here, J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\ncondition_value = 2 * g - 2\nprint(f\"\\nWe check the condition n > 2*g - 2, which is {n} > {condition_value}. This is true.\")\nprint(\"The formula rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1 applies.\")\n\n# Step 2: Determine the smallest possible rank for rho(J(C)).\n# For a generic curve C, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian J(C) is minimal.\nmin_rho_j_c = 1\nprint(f\"\\nThe minimum possible rank for rho(J(C)) for a genus {g} curve is {min_rho_j_c}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the smallest rank for X.\nsmallest_rank = min_rho_j_c + 1\nprint(f\"Therefore, the smallest possible rank of NS(X) is {min_rho_j_c} + 1 = {smallest_rank}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Determine the largest possible rank for rho(J(C)).\n# The rank rho(J(C)) is bounded by g^2. This maximum is achieved for special curves\n# with Complex Multiplication.\nmax_rho_j_c = g**2\nprint(f\"\\nThe maximum possible rank for rho(J(C)) for a genus {g} curve is g^2 = {g**2}, which is {max_rho_j_c}.\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the largest rank for X.\nlargest_rank = max_rho_j_c + 1\nprint(f\"Therefore, the largest possible rank of NS(X) is {max_rho_j_c} + 1 = {largest_rank}.\")\n\n```\n<<<The smallest rank is 2 and the largest rank is 10.>>>"
