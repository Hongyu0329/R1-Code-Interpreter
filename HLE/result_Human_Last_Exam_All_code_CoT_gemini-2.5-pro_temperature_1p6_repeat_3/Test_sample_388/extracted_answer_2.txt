Hello Allison, I have your prescriptions ready. I overheard you mention that you took Excedrin for a headache and that you are also picking up your prescription for Fluoxetine 20mg.

It's very important for you to know that combining Fluoxetine with Aspirin, which is an ingredient in Excedrin, can cause an increased risk of stomach and gastrointestinal bleeding.

For future headaches, I would recommend a safer alternative that doesn't have this interaction, such as plain Acetaminophen (Tylenol).

You should also watch for any signs of stomach bleeding, like severe stomach pain or dark, tarry stools, and contact your doctor if you experience them. If your headaches continue, it would be a good idea to discuss them with your doctor.
