    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Can V(p) decompose as stated?
    # Yes, for the admissible level k = -2 + 1/p, vertex operator algebras can be constructed
    # (e.g., via BRST cohomology of free field realizations) which possess a commuting sl_2
    # action and decompose in the specified form. This is a known result in the field.
    answer_a1 = "Yes"

    # Does a different decomposition exist?
    # The category of admissible representations of an affine Lie algebra at an admissible level
    # is semisimple. This means any module in this category that is completely reducible has a unique
    # decomposition into simple (irreducible) modules. Assuming V(p) falls into this class,
    # its decomposition is unique.
    answer_a2 = "No"


    # --- Part (b) ---
    # What is the top-level dimension of L(p)_n?
    # The problem statement explicitly defines L(p)_n as the simple module with
    # top-level rho_n, and rho_n as the (n+1)-dimensional irreducible sl_2-module.
    # Thus, the dimension is n+1 by definition.
    answer_b = "n + 1"


    # --- Part (c) ---
    # What is the minimal conformal weight in the decomposition for p = 2?
    # The conformal weight h_n of the highest-weight vector of L(p)_n is given by the
    # Sugawara construction: h_n = C_2(rho_n) / (2*(k + h_v)).
    # For sl_2, the dual Coxeter number h_v = 2.
    # The level is k = -2 + 1/p, so k + h_v = 1/p.
    # The quadratic Casimir for the (n+1)-dim representation rho_n is C_2(rho_n) = n*(n+2)/2.
    # So, h_n = (n*(n+2)/2) / (2*(1/p)) = p*n*(n+2)/4.

    p_c = 2
    # For p=2, the formula is h_n = 2*n*(n+2)/4 = n*(n+2)/2.
    # The decomposition runs over n = 0, 1, 2, ...
    # The function f(n) = n*(n+2)/2 is minimal for n >= 0 at n = 0.

    n_c = 0
    # The final equation is h_0 = (0 * (0 + 2)) / 2.
    # Here are the numbers in that final equation:
    num1 = n_c
    num2 = n_c + 2
    den = 2
    
    answer_c = (num1 * num2) / den
