# Plan:
# 1. Define the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups for Thompson's group T, H_b^k(T), for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
#    Let d_k = dim(H_b^k(T; R)).
# 2. Based on known results and standard assumptions in the field:
#    d_0 = 1
#    d_1 = 0
#    d_2 = 1 (Barge-Ghys)
#    d_3 = 1 (Matsumoto)
#    d_4 = 0 (Consequence of the structure of the cohomology ring of T)
# 3. Use the Künneth formula for the dimension of H_b^4(T x T; R):
#    dim = d_0*d_4 + d_1*d_3 + d_2*d_2 + d_3*d_1 + d_4*d_0
# 4. Compute and print the result.

# Dimensions of H_b^k(T; R)
d = {
    0: 1,
    1: 0,
    2: 1,
    3: 1,
    4: 0
}

# Apply the Künneth formula for dimension of H_b^4(T x T; R)
# sum_{p+q=4} d_p * d_q
# This expands to: d_0*d_4 + d_1*d_3 + d_2*d_2 + d_3*d_1 + d_4*d_0
terms = [
    (d[0], d[4]),
    (d[1], d[3]),
    (d[2], d[2]),
    (d[3], d[1]),
    (d[4], d[0])
]

# Calculate the result
result = sum(p * q for p, q in terms)

# Print the calculation step by step
calculation_str = " + ".join([f"{p} * {q}" for p, q in terms])
print(f"The dimension of H_b^4(T x T; R) is computed using the Künneth formula:")
print(f"dim = d(0)d(4) + d(1)d(3) + d(2)d(2) + d(3)d(1) + d(4)d(0)")
