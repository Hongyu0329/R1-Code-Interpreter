    The patient's presentation strongly suggests sacroiliac (SI) joint pathology, specifically sacroiliitis.

    1.  **High-Risk Profile**: The patient has a history of multiple systemic inflammatory diseases (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, Rheumatoid Arthritis), which are significant risk factors for developing sacroiliitis.
    2.  **Pain Pattern**: The pain location (L4-S1 distribution) is a classic referral pattern for the SI joint, often mimicking sciatica. The unremarkable X-ray is also consistent with early sacroiliitis, as joint changes may not be visible initially.
    3.  **Physical Exam Maneuver**: The question asks for a confirmatory maneuver while the patient is in the left decubitus position (lying on her left side) and the physician examines the symptomatic right leg.
    4.  **Evaluating the Options**: We need a maneuver that specifically provokes the SI joint.
        *   (A) Abduction tests for trochanteric bursitis.
        *   (D) External rotation can test for piriformis syndrome.
        *   (F) Extension of the hip in the side-lying position applies a torsional or shearing force directly to the SI joint. This is a component of Gaenslen's Test, a specific provocative test for SI joint dysfunction.
    5.  **Conclusion**: If extending the patient's right hip reproduces her characteristic pain, it provides strong clinical evidence to confirm sacroiliitis as the diagnosis over other possibilities like a primary disc issue or piriformis syndrome.
