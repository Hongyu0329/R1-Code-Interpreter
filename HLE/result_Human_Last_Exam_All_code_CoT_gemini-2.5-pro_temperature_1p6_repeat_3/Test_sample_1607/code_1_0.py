    # Detailed analysis of each statement leads to the following conclusions:
    # A) False. The momentum operator p̂ is a generator with a continuous spectrum.
    # B1) False. For a potential V(r) ∝ 1/r², the commutator [τ̂,Ĥ] is non-zero, making the premise of the implication false.
    # B2) False. The scaling exponents are off by a factor of 2. x̂ scales with e^(2θ) and p̂ with e^(-2θ) (for ħ=1).
    # C) False. [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is both a necessary and sufficient condition for [Ŝ(θ), Ĥ] = 0 to hold for all θ.
    # D) True. Since [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0, then Ĥ(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂Ĥ|ψ⟩ = τ̂(E|ψ⟩) = E(τ̂|ψ⟩).
    # E) True. L̂_z is the generator of rotations about the z-axis in quantum mechanics.
    # F) True. This is the core of Noether's theorem in quantum mechanics, derived from the Ehrenfest theorem.
    # G) True. The premise is always true for a single generator. The conclusion is true by the problem's definition of symmetry generators being Hermitian. A (True -> True) statement is True.
    # H) False. The quantum harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian is an unbounded operator with a discrete spectrum.
    # I) True. This follows from the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting operators.
    # J) True. As [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0, Ĥ(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜĤ|ψ⟩ = Ŝ(E|ψ⟩) = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩).

    # The letters corresponding to the true statements.
    true_statements = ['D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'I', 'J']

    # The statements are already in alphabetical order, but we ensure it.
    true_statements.sort()

    # The final answer is the concatenation of the sorted letters.
