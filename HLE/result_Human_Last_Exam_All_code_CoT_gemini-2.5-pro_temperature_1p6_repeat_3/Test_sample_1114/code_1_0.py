    Calculates the minimum number of particles N for a rank-7 pseudo-tensor.

    Thinking Process:
    1. A rank-k pseudo-tensor in 3D must be even under parity inversion if k is odd.
       For k=7 (odd), the function must be even.
    2. We use N-1 independent difference vectors from N particles.
    3. To create an even function from vectors that flip sign (d -> -d), we need an
       even number of them in each term.
    4. The cross product of two vectors, u = d1 x d2, is even under inversion.
       This requires at least 2 independent vectors (d1, d2).
    5. The condition is: N - 1 >= 2, which implies N >= 3.
    6. For N=3, we can form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor, for example, from the cross product
       (a pseudovector, rank 1, even) and a rank-6 true tensor (even).
       This makes the whole construct even, as required.
