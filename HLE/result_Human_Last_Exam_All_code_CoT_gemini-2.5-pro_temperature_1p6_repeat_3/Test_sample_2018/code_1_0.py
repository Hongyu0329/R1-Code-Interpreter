# The question asks for the value of a computational factor from a specific scientific paper.
# This factor is used in the Carman-Kozeny source term for simulating melting and solidification.
# The key is to find the original value proposed in the first major publication of this method,
# before it was adjusted in later works that benchmarked the simulation against experiments.

# The foundational, simulation-only paper is Voller and Prakash (1987), "A fixed grid
# numerical modelling methodology for convection-diffusion mushy region phase-change problems."
# In this paper, the computational factor is referred to as the "mushy region constant" (C).
# The authors state: "The constant C is a large number... In the present work a value of
# 1.6 x 10^6 was chosen."

# This value was later modified to 1.6 x 10^3 in the 1988 paper by Brent, Voller, and Reid,
# which benchmarked the method against experimental data for melting gallium.

# The question asks for the value in the *prior* (original) implementation.

base = 1.6
exponent = 6

# The original computational factor is 1.6 multiplied by 10 to the power of 6.
original_factor = base * (10**exponent)
