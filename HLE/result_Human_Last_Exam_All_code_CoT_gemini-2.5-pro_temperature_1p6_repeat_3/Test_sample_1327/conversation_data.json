    "To solve this number sequence puzzle, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the sequence**: First, I will look at the given sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. I'll try to find a simple arithmetic or geometric relationship between the terms.\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Since simple differences or ratios don't reveal an obvious pattern, I'll test a more complex hypothesis. A common type of pattern involves powers of a number. I'll test the relationship `x_n = 2^(n+c) + k_n`, where `x_n` is the n-th term and `k_n` is a remainder sequence.\n3.  **Find the Remainder Sequence**: I'll calculate the terms of the remainder sequence `k_n` based on the formula from step 2. Let's assume the pattern starts from the second term (`n=2`).\n4.  **Analyze the Remainder Sequence**: Once I have the sequence `k_n`, I will analyze it to find its underlying pattern. This might involve looking at the differences between its terms.\n5.  **Extrapolate the Pattern**: After identifying the pattern in the remainder sequence, I will use it to predict the next remainder.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Term**: Using the next remainder, I will calculate the next term in the original sequence.\n7.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic, showing the calculations step-by-step and printing the final equation and answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle by finding its underlying pattern.\n    The sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ...\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"Original sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Hypothesize a pattern of the form x_n = 2^(n+1) + k_n, starting from n=2.\n    print(\"Let's test the hypothesis that for n >= 2, the pattern is x_n = 2^(n+1) + k_n.\")\n    print(\"We calculate the remainder sequence 'k' for the known terms.\")\n    \n    k_sequence = []\n    # We treat the sequence as 1-indexed for the formula, but access it as 0-indexed.\n    # The pattern starts from the 2nd term (index 1).\n    for i in range(1, len(sequence)):\n        n = i + 1 # n-th term in the sequence (n=2, 3, 4, 5)\n        power_of_2 = 2**(n+1)\n        remainder = sequence[i] - power_of_2\n        k_sequence.append(remainder)\n        print(f\"For x_{n} = {sequence[i]}: k_{n} = {sequence[i]} - 2^({n}+1) = {sequence[i]} - {power_of_2} = {remainder}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe remainder sequence 'k' is: {k_sequence}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Find the pattern in the remainder sequence 'k'.\n    print(\"Now, let's find the pattern in the remainder sequence by looking at its differences.\")\n    k_diffs = []\n    for i in range(len(k_sequence) - 1):\n        diff = k_sequence[i+1] - k_sequence[i]\n        k_diffs.append(diff)\n        print(f\"Difference {i+1}: {k_sequence[i+1]} - {k_sequence[i]} = {diff}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe differences are: {k_diffs}.
