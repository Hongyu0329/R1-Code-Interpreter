    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the basic requirements for both spectroscopy and computed tomography.\n\n1.  **Spectroscopy Requirement**: To obtain spectral (wavelength) information, you need to disperse the light. A single diffraction grating is sufficient for this purpose. It splits a beam of light into its constituent colors, spreading them out along one axis. So, for spectral analysis of a single projection, 1 grating is needed.\n\n2.  **Computed Tomography (CT) Requirement**: Tomography is the process of reconstructing a 2D slice or 3D volume from multiple projection images taken from different angles. To reconstruct a volume from a \"single image\" or \"single shot,\" you must generate these multiple views simultaneously and project them onto a detector.\n\n3.  **Combining the Requirements**:\n    *   A single diffraction grating can provide spectral information, but it only disperses the light along one direction. This provides spectrally-resolved information for only a single viewing axis, which is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n    *   To create multiple views simultaneously for tomography, we need to project the object's image from different angles onto the detector. Using a second diffraction grating, placed perpendicular (or \"crossed\") to the first one, allows for dispersion in two dimensions (e.g., x and y). This setup creates a 2D array of diffraction orders on the detector. Each order ((1,0), (0,1), (1,1), etc.) corresponds to a view of the object from a slightly different angle, and each view is spectrally dispersed.\n    *   This provides the minimum necessary information for single-shot spectral computed tomography: multiple views for tomographic reconstruction, and spectral dispersion for each view.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of gratings is 2 (one for each axis of dispersion).\n\nThe following Python code explains this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grating_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the minimum number of diffraction gratings for\n    single-shot spectral computed tomography.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # To obtain spectral information for a single projection, we need to disperse light along one axis.\n    # This requires one diffraction grating.\n    grating_for_first_axis = 1\n\n    # Computed tomography requires views from multiple angles. To generate these views\n    # in a single shot without mechanical rotation, we need to project views from a second,\n    # non-collinear axis. This requires a second grating, typically crossed with the first.\n    grating_for_second_axis = 1\n\n    # The minimum number of gratings is the sum required for two independent axes of dispersion,\n    # which creates a 2D array of spectrally-resolved projections.\n    minimum_total_gratings = grating_for_first_axis + grating_for_second_axis\n\n    print(\"Explanation:\")\n    print(\"1. A single diffraction grating disperses light along one axis, providing spectral data for one set of projection angles. This is not enough for tomographic reconstruction.\")\n    print(\"2. To perform computed tomography, projections from multiple, non-collinear viewing angles are required.\")\n    print(\"3.

This two-grating system generates a 2D grid of diffraction orders, where each order is a spectrally-resolved view of the object from a unique angle.\")\n    print(\"5. This provides the minimum information needed for single-shot spectral computed tomography.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{grating_for_first_axis} (for 1st axis) + {grating_for_second_axis} (for 2nd axis) = {minimum_total_gratings}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe minimum number of diffraction gratings is {minimum_total_gratings}.\")\n\nsolve_grating_problem()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
