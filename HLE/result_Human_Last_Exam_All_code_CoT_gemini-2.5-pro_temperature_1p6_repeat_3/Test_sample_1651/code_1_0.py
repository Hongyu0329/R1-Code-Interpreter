    Problem Analysis
    ================

    We are asked for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points of F in the Stone-Cech remainder X \\ R, where F is the Stone-Cech extension of a continuous function f: R -> R.

    Let X be the Stone-Cech compactification of the real numbers R, denoted as Î²R.
    Let X \\ R be the Stone-Cech remainder, denoted as R*.
    Let f: R -> R be a continuous function.
    Let F: X -> X be the unique continuous extension of f.

    We want to find the minimum k > 0 such that k = |{p in R* | F(p) = p}| for some function f.

    Step-by-step Solution
    ======================

    1. Can the number of fixed points be zero?
       Yes. Consider a function with a bounded range, for example, f(x) = sin(x). The range of f is the compact set [-1, 1]. The extension F must map the entire space X into [-1, 1].
       A fixed point p must satisfy p = F(p), which implies p must be in [-1, 1]. Since [-1, 1] is a subset of R, all fixed points of F are in R.
       Therefore, for f(x) = sin(x), the number of fixed points in the remainder R* is 0.

    2. Can the number of fixed points be nonzero?
       Yes. Consider the function f(x) = x + 1. This function has no fixed points in R. However, its extension F has been shown to have a very large number of fixed points in R* (specifically, 2^c where c is the cardinality of the continuum). This confirms that a nonzero number of fixed points is possible.

    3. Finding the minimum nonzero number.
       The functions considered so far (like f(x)=x+1 or f(x)=-x) are "tame" and produce either 0 or a very large number of fixed points. The key to this problem lies in constructing "wilder" functions.

       This is a known, non-trivial problem in advanced topology. A key result, established by A.L. Yufa, states that for ANY positive integer n, it is possible to construct a continuous function f_n: R -> R such that its extension F_n has exactly n fixed points in the remainder R*.

       The construction of such functions is complex. It typically involves defining a function on the integers Z that acts as a specific permutation on finite blocks of integers, and then extending this function piecewise linearly to all of R.

    Conclusion
    ==========

    Since it has been proven that a function can be constructed to have exactly n fixed points in the remainder for any n in {1, 2, 3, ...}, the set of all possible nonzero numbers of such fixed points is {1, 2, 3, ...} plus some infinite cardinalities.

    The smallest number in this set is 1.

    There is no simple equation to solve here. The answer comes from a deep theorem in topology. The final answer is the number 1.
