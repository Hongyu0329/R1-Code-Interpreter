    print("  - Reason: Using the strong Left Second Premolar as the posterior abutment is logical. To stabilize the denture against the strong anterior bite forces and the long span, cross-arch stabilization is crucial. Clasping the Right Central Incisor (and potentially the Right Canine as well) creates a 'tripod' effect, distributing forces widely across the arch instead of overloading the weaker Left Central Incisor.")

The appropriate management involves a multi-phase approach. 
1. URGENT CARE: First, urgently manage the uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c=7.5%) via medical referral. Simultaneously, clean the wound, administer antibiotics and a tetanus booster due to the 28-hour delay, and perform a radiographic exam. 
2. CELLS OF INTEREST: Key cells for healing are neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts, all of whose functions are compromised by the patient's diabetic state.
3. DENTURE PLAN: The recommended prosthesis is a Cast Metal (Cobalt-Chromium) Framework Removable Partial Denture due to the long toothless span and high bite forces from the Class III skeletal pattern (SNB=88째). 
4. ABUTMENT TEETH: The abutment teeth should be the Left Second Premolar and the Right Central Incisor to achieve cross-arch stabilization, which is critical for the prosthesis's longevity and stability.
