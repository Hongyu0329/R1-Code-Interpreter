    This function demonstrates the calculation steps.
    Let K be the field Q_2(pi) where pi^5 = 2.
    Let v_K be the valuation on K with v_K(pi) = 1.
    The curve is z^2 = 2x^5+2x^3+1. Let x = 2^{-1/5}u = pi^{-1}u.
    The equation for the roots u becomes Q(u) = u^5 + pi^2*u^3 + 1 = 0.
    The special fiber mod pi has roots satisfying u^5+1 = (u+1)(u^4+u^3+u^2+u+1) = 0.
    This leads to two clusters of roots.
    The stable reduction has a double point. The thickness is related to the arithmetic of these clusters.
    A key quantity is the distance between the center of a cluster and the corresponding point on the special fiber.
    The first cluster corresponds to the root u_1 which is near -1.
    We can find a more precise location for u_1 using one step of Newton's method.
    u_1 is approximately u_0 - Q(u_0)/Q'(u_0) for u_0 = -1.
    Q(u_0) = Q(-1) = (-1)^5 + pi^2*(-1)^3 + 1 = -1 - pi^2 + 1 = -pi^2.
    Q'(u) = 5u^4 + 3*pi^2*u^2.
    Q'(u_0) = Q'(-1) = 5*(-1)^4 + 3*pi^2*(-1)^2 = 5 + 3*pi^2.
    So, u_1 - (-1) is approx -Q(-1)/Q'(-1) = pi^2 / (5 + 3*pi^2).
    The v_K valuation of this difference is:
    v_K(u_1 - (-1)) = v_K(pi^2) - v_K(5 + 3*pi^2).
    v_K(pi^2) is 2.
    v_K(5) is 0 and v_K(3*pi^2) is 2, so v_K(5+3*pi^2) = min(v_K(5), v_K(3*pi^2)) = 0.
    So, v_K(u_1 - (-1)) = 2 - 0 = 2.
    This value often represents the thickness of the node.
