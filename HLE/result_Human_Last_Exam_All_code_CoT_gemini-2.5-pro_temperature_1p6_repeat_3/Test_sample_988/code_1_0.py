    High temperature exposure (29°C) induces oxidative stress in Microcystis aeruginosa by disrupting metabolic balance, leading to the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) like superoxide radicals.

    The cell's primary and most immediate defense mechanism against a sudden burst of ROS is the activation of its enzymatic antioxidant system.

    1.  **Superoxide Dismutase (SOD):** This enzyme is the first line of defense. It rapidly converts the highly toxic superoxide radical (O₂⁻) into hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which is less toxic but still harmful.

    2.  **Catalase (CAT) and Peroxidases (e.g., APX):** These enzymes then immediately act to neutralize the hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), breaking it down into harmless water (H₂O) and oxygen (O₂).

    This enzymatic cascade is the fastest response the cell can mount because the activity of these pre-existing enzymes can be upregulated almost instantly. While other antioxidants like hydrosoluble (e.g., glutathione) and liposoluble (e.g., carotenoids) molecules are also crucial, their synthesis or regeneration cycles are part of a broader, and often slightly slower, response. Therefore, the enzymatic antioxidants are considered the *initially activated* defense system.
