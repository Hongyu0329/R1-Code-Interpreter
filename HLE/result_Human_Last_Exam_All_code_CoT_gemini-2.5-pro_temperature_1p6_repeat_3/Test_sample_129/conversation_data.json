    "This problem asks for the number of true boolean expressions that can be formed using exactly 5 symbols from the set {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Plan\n\nI will solve this using dynamic programming. Let `T[n]` be the number of true expressions of length `n`, and `F[n]` be the number of false expressions of length `n`. My goal is to find `T[5]`.\n\nA valid boolean expression can be formed in one of three ways:\n1.  **Unary negation:** `!E`, where `E` is a valid expression.\n2.  **Parentheses:** `(E)`, where `E` is a valid expression.\n3.  **Binary operation:** `E1 op E2`, where `E1` and `E2` are valid expressions and `op` is `&` or `|`.\n\nThe length of the expression is the number of symbols used.\n-   The length of `!E` is `1 + length(E)`.\n-   The length of `(E)` is `2 + length(E)`.\n-   The length of `E1 op E2` is `length(E1) + 1 + length(E2)`.\n\nI'll compute `T[n]` and `F[n]` for `n` from 1 to 5.\n\n**Base Case (n=1):**\n-   The only expressions are the variables `T` and `F`.\n-   `T[1] = 1` (for \"T\")\n-   `F[1] = 1` (for \"F\")\n\n**Recursive Step (for n > 1):**\nTo calculate `T[n]` and `F[n]`, I'll sum the counts from all possible ways to form an expression of length `n`:\n1.  **From `!E`:** `E` must have length `n-1`. `!E` is true if `E` is false.\n    -   Contribution to `T[n]`: `F[n-1]`\n    -   Contribution to `F[n]`: `T[n-1]`\n2.  **From `(E)`:** `E` must have length `n-2`. `(E)` has the same truth value as `E`.\n    -   Contribution to `T[n]`: `T[n-2]`\n    -   Contribution to `F[n]`: `F[n-2]`\n3.  **From `E1 op E2`:** The lengths of `E1` and `E2` must sum to `n-1`. I'll iterate through all possible lengths `k` for `E1` (from `1` to `n-2`), where `length(E2) = n-1-k`.\n    -   For each `k`, I calculate the number of true/false combinations for `&` and `|`.\n    -   Let `C[i] = T[i] + F[i]` be the total number of expressions of length `i`.\n    -   For `&`:\n        -   True combinations: `T[k] * T[n-1-k]`\n    -   For `|`:\n        -   True combinations: `C[k] * C[n-1-k] - F[k] * F[n-1-k]` (total combinations minus the case where both are false).\n    -   I'll sum these up over all `k` and both operators.\n\nFinally, `T[5]` will be the sum of contributions from `!E` (where `E` has length 4), `(E)` (where `E` has length 3), and `E1 op E2` (where `len(E1)+len(E2)=4`).\n\nThe Python code below will implement this logic, calculate the values, and print the breakdown of the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    # T[n] stores the number of True expressions of length n.\n    # F[n] stores the number of False expressions of length n.\n    T = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    F = collections.defaultdict(int)\n\n    # Base case: n = 1\n    # Expressions: \"T\", \"F\"\n    T[1] = 1  # \"T\"\n    F[1] = 1  # \"F\"\n\n    print(\"Calculating counts for n=1 to 5...\")\n    print(\"n=1: T[1]=1, F[1]=1\")\n\n    # Dynamic programming for n from 2 to 5\n    for n in range(2, 6):\n        # 1.
