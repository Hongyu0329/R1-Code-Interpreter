    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible projective dimension for a specific class of functors. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Mathematical Terms:** First, we'll break down the question into more familiar concepts from representation theory and homological algebra.\n    *   An **upper semilattice $J$** is a partially ordered set where any two elements have a least upper bound (a join). When viewed as a category, it has specific structural properties.\n    *   A **functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$** is a representation of the poset $J$. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra $KJ$.\n    *   A functor is **$n$-resolvable** if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. This means its projective dimension is at most $n$.\n    *   A **tame functor** refers to a functor on a category $J$ that has a tame representation type. A key result is that any finite upper semilattice $J$ gives rise to an incidence algebra $KJ$ that is of tame representation type. Thus, the condition \"tame\" is automatically satisfied for any functor on a finite upper semilattice.\n\n2.  **Reframe the Question:** Based on the analysis above, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum possible global dimension of the incidence algebra $KJ$ for any finite upper semilattice $J$. This maximum value will be our integer $n$.\n\n3.  **Apply a Key Theorem:** There is a classical result in homological algebra concerning the global dimension of semilattice algebras. A theorem by Barry Mitchell (1968) states that for any finite upper semilattice $J$, the global dimension of its incidence algebra $KJ$ is at most 2.\n\n4.  **Verify the Bound:** We need to check if this bound of 2 is the best possible (i.e., tight). We can do this by finding an example of a finite upper semilattice whose incidence algebra has a global dimension of exactly 2. The \"diamond lattice\" (denoted $M_3$), which consists of a bottom element, a top element, and two incomparable elements in between, is a simple example of an upper semilattice. The global dimension of its incidence algebra is known to be 2.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since the global dimension is at most 2, and we have an example where it is exactly 2, the smallest integer $n$ for which any such functor is $n$-resolvable is 2.\n\nThe Python code below will formalize this conclusion and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_resolvability():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the integer n for which a tame functor\n    f: J -> Vect_K on an upper semilattice J is n-resolvable.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The problem is to find the maximum projective dimension for modules\n    # over the incidence algebra KJ of a finite upper semilattice J.
