    "The problem asks for the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. This is determined by the topology of the surface.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to determine the correct formula and provide the corresponding code:\n\n1.  **Relate GSD to Topology**: The GSD of a topological code like the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. The value of `k` depends on the topology of the surface on which the code is defined.\n2.  **Identify Topological Features**: The surface is described by its genus (`g`), the number of smooth boundaries/holes (`n`), and the number of rough boundaries/holes (`m`). A \"hole\" implies a boundary component. For a surface created by punching holes in a sphere, the genus `g` is 0.\n3.  **Find the Formula for Logical Qubits (`k`)**: The number of logical qubits `k` for a toric code on a surface is given by a formula that accounts for genus and boundaries. For a surface of genus `g` with `n` smooth and `m` rough boundaries, a comprehensive formula for the number of logical qubits is:\n    `k = 2g + n + m - 2 + δ_{n,0} + δ_{m,0}`\n    where `δ_{i,0}` is the Kronecker delta, which is 1 if `i=0` and 0 otherwise.\n4.  **Apply to the Specific Case**: The problem implies starting from a sphere, so we set the genus `g=0`. The formula becomes:\n    `k = n + m - 2 + δ_{n,0} + δ_{m,0}`\n5.  **Interpret the Question's Context**: The answer choices are simple functions of `n` and `m`, without any special cases for when `n` or `m` are zero (i.e., no Kronecker deltas). This strongly suggests that the question is asking for the \"general case,\" where it's assumed there is at least one of each type of hole (`n > 0` and `m > 0`).\n6.  **Simplify the Formula**: In the general case where `n > 0` and `m > 0`, the Kronecker delta terms `δ_{n,0}` and `δ_{m,0}` are both zero. The formula for the number of logical qubits simplifies to:\n    `k = n + m - 2`\n7.  **Calculate the GSD**: With `k = n + m - 2`, the ground space degeneracy is:\n    `GSD = 2^k = 2^(n+m-2)`\n    This expression matches one of the answer choices.\n8.  **Prepare the Code**: I will write a Python function that implements this formula. The function will take `n` and `m` as arguments and print the step-by-step calculation for some example values, making it clear how the final GSD is obtained, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_toric_code_gsd(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code\n    on a surface with n smooth and m rough holes.\n\n    This calculation assumes the general case where n > 0 and m > 0.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes (must be > 0).\n        m (int): The number of rough holes (must be > 0).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:\n        print(\"This formula is for the general case where n > 0 and m > 0.\")\n        # We can use the more general formula for these cases if needed,\n        # but based on the problem's multiple-choice options,\n        # we focus on the case n>0, m>0.\n        k = n + m - 2 + (1 if n == 0 else 0) + (1 if m == 0 else 0)\n        if k < 0: # This should not happen for n,m >= 0\n            k = 0\n        gsd = int(math.pow(2, k))\n        print(f\"For the specific case n={n}, m={m}, the degeneracy is {gsd}.\")\n        return\n\n    # In the general case (n>0, m>0), the number of logical qubits k is n + m - 2.\n    k = n + m - 2\n    \n    # The Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n    gsd = int(math.pow(2, k))\n\n    print(f\"For a toric code with n = {n} smooth holes and m = {m} rough holes:\")\n    print(\"The number of logical qubits k is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"k = n + m - 2\")\n    print(f\"k = {n} + {m} - 2\")\n    print(f\"k = {k}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k:\")\n    print(f\"GSD = 2^{k}\")\n    print(f\"GSD = {gsd}\")\n\n\n# Example usage with n=3 smooth holes and m=2 rough holes.\ncalculate_toric_code_gsd(n=3, m=2)\n```\n<<<B>>>"
