    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Mathematical Problem:** The user is asking for the \"connectivity\" of a specific map from algebraic topology: $\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Relevant Theorem:** This map is a classic example in homotopy theory. Its connectivity is determined by a well-known theorem by G. W. Whitehead. The theorem relates the connectivity of spaces $X$ and $Y$ to the connectivity of the map $\\Sigma ( \\Omega X \\wedge \\Omega Y) \\to \\Omega(X \\wedge Y)$. The theorem states that if $X$ is $(q-1)$-connected and $Y$ is $(r-1)$-connected (with $q, r \\geq 2$), then the map is $(q+r-2)$-connected.\n\n3.  **Apply the Theorem to the Specific Case:**\n    *   Our spaces are $X = S^4$ (the 4-sphere) and $Y = S^6$ (the 6-sphere).\n    *   The n-sphere, $S^n$, is known to be $(n-1)$-connected.\n    *   For $S^4$, it is $(4-1)=3$-connected. This gives us $q-1=3$, so $q=4$.\n    *   For $S^6$, it is $(6-1)=5$-connected. This gives us $r-1=5$, so $r=6$.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:** With $q=4$ and $r=6$, the connectivity of the map is given by the formula $q+r-2$. Plugging in the values, we get $4+6-2$.\n\n5.  **Create a Python Script:** I will write a simple Python script to perform this calculation. The script will define the sphere dimensions, calculate the connectivity using the formula, and print the result along with an explanation of the formula being used. This approach fulfills the request to solve the task using coding skills.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).\n# This is a question in the field of algebraic topology.\n\n# Step 1: State the relevant theorem from homotopy theory.\n# A theorem by G. W. Whitehead gives the connectivity for maps of this form.\n# The theorem states:\n# For a map J: Sigma(Omega X wedge Omega Y) -> Omega(X wedge Y), if X is (q-1)-connected\n# and Y is (r-1)-connected (for q, r >= 2), then the map J is (q+r-2)-connected.\n\n# Step 2: Apply the theorem to our specific spaces, X = S^m and Y = S^n.\n# The n-sphere, S^n, is (n-1)-connected.\n# So, for X = S^m, we have q-1 = m-1, which implies q = m.\n# For Y = S^n, we have r-1 = n-1, which implies r = n.\n# Therefore, for spheres, the connectivity of the map is m + n - 2.\n\n# Step 3: Define the dimensions and calculate the connectivity for the given problem.\n# In this case, we have the 4-sphere (m=4) and the 6-sphere (n=6).\n\n# The dimension of the first sphere.\nm = 4\n# The dimension of the second sphere.\nn = 6\n\n# Calculate the connectivity using the formula.\nconnectivity = m + n - 2\n\n# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.\nprint(\"To find the connectivity of the map Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6), we use a standard theorem from homotopy theory.\")\nprint(\"The connectivity for a map of the form Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n) is given by the formula: m + n - 2.\")\nprint(\"\\nIn this problem, the dimensions of the spheres are m = 4 and n = 6.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{m} + {n} - 2 = {connectivity}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
