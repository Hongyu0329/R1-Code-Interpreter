# The problem asks for the connectivity of the map f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6).
# This is a question in the field of algebraic topology.

# Step 1: State the relevant theorem from homotopy theory.
# A theorem by G. W. Whitehead gives the connectivity for maps of this form.
# The theorem states:
# For a map J: Sigma(Omega X wedge Omega Y) -> Omega(X wedge Y), if X is (q-1)-connected
# and Y is (r-1)-connected (for q, r >= 2), then the map J is (q+r-2)-connected.

# Step 2: Apply the theorem to our specific spaces, X = S^m and Y = S^n.
# The n-sphere, S^n, is (n-1)-connected.
# So, for X = S^m, we have q-1 = m-1, which implies q = m.
# For Y = S^n, we have r-1 = n-1, which implies r = n.
# Therefore, for spheres, the connectivity of the map is m + n - 2.

# Step 3: Define the dimensions and calculate the connectivity for the given problem.
# In this case, we have the 4-sphere (m=4) and the 6-sphere (n=6).

# The dimension of the first sphere.
m = 4
# The dimension of the second sphere.
n = 6

# Calculate the connectivity using the formula.
connectivity = m + n - 2

# Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final calculation.
