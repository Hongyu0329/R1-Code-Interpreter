    "My plan is to first determine the underlying rule of the sequence. I'll analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers and the properties of the numbers themselves, such as the sum of their digits.\n\nAfter examining the sequence, I've determined that it consists of \"generated numbers\". A number `N` is a generated number if it can be expressed as `N = x + sum_of_digits(x)` for some integer `x`.\n\nFor instance, the first number in the sequence, 1014, is generated by `x = 993`:\n993 + (9 + 9 + 3) = 993 + 21 = 1014.\n\nSimilarly, the last number given, 2352, is generated by `x = 2337`:\n2337 + (2 + 3 + 3 + 7) = 2337 + 15 = 2352.\n\nTo find the next number, I need to find the smallest integer greater than 2352 that also fits this rule. I will write a Python script that iterates through integers starting from 2353 and checks if each one can be \"generated\". The first one that can be will be the answer. The script will also output the final equation showing the generation.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the next number in the sequence of 'generated numbers'.\n    A number N is in the sequence if it can be expressed as N = x + sum_of_digits(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def sum_digits(n):\n        \"\"\"Calculates the sum of the digits of an integer.\"\"\"\n        s = 0\n        for digit in str(n):\n            s += int(digit)\n        return s\n\n    last_known_number = 2352\n    num_to_check = last_known_number + 1\n\n    while True:\n        # Search for a generator 'x' for the current num_to_check.\n        # The generator 'x' must be less than num_to_check.\n        # The maximum sum of digits for a 4-digit number is for 9999 (36),\n        # so we only need to check a small range of potential generators.\n        potential_generator_start = max(1, num_to_check - 100)\n        \n        for x in range(potential_generator_start, num_to_check):\n            if x + sum_digits(x) == num_to_check:\n                # Found the next number and its generator\n                next_number = num_to_check\n                generator = x\n                \n                print(f\"The sequence is composed of 'generated numbers', where a number N = x + (sum of digits of x).\")\n                print(f\"The last number given is {last_known_number}.\")\n                print(f\"The next generated number after {last_known_number} is {next_number}, which is generated by {generator}.\")\n                \n                # Format the final equation with each digit separate\n                digits_str_list = list(str(generator))\n                equation = f\"{generator} + {' + '.join(digits_str_list)} = {next_number}\"\n                \n                print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n                print(equation)\n                return next_number\n        \n        num_to_check += 1\n\n# Execute the function and capture the answer\nfinal_answer = find_next_number_in_sequence()\nprint(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
