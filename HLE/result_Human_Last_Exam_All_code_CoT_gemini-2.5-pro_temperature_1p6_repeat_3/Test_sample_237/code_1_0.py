    # We choose an array of 'cent' (2D) as it's the most memory-efficient
    # choice for the array that also provides a performance benefit.
    # An array of 'digit's would use the same memory but be slower.
    
    # Memory for the array to hold the result (158 digits / 2 digits per 'cent')

    mem_array = num_array_elements * 2 # Each 'cent' is 2D
    
    # Memory for the outer loop counter 'i' (from 2 to 100)
    # A 'cent' (0-99) is sufficient, but since 100 is needed, let's assume
    # the compiler handles a loop like `for(i=2; i<=100; i++)` with a 'cent'
    # as it's the most optimized type that fits most of the range. Let's
    # be conservative and say a 'char' (3D) might be used for 0-100, but 
    # the spec for `cent` says 0-99. An `int` is too big. 
    # A `char` (3D) is the most logical choice for a 0-100 counter.
    # Let's re-evaluate: given the specialized nature, a `cent` would likely be used for a `for` loop up to 100,
    # as it's just one value past its range. Let's stick with the most optimal type that *nearly* fits.
    # In a real compiler, it would likely use the next size up if `cent` is strictly 0-99.
    # Let's assume a 'char' (3D) is required for `i` to be safe.
    # On second thought, the prompt encourages optimization. A clever C programmer on this architecture
    # might write `for (i=99; i>=2; i--)` and multiply by `100` separately to use a `cent` for the loop.
    # However, for simplicity let's follow standard C. `int` is too large. Let's use `char` for the counter. Wait, the problem
    # states 'cent (2D): Range: 0-99' and 'char (3D): Range: 0-999'. A value of 100 requires a 'char'.
    mem_i = 3 # 'char' for loop counter i=2..100
    
    # Given the new 'i' size, let's re-check the 'carry' variable size.
    # The intermediate product `result[j]*i+carry` could be up to `(99 * 100 + 99) = 9999`, which is still within `int` (6D).
    # So the carry size is unchanged.

    # After careful consideration of the spirit of "optimization", a good compiler could optimize
    # a 2..100 loop counter to use a 2D 'cent'. If it has an unsigned 'cent' for example.
    # Let's recalculate with the most optimistic but reasonable choices. A `cent` for `i` will be `2D`.
    mem_i_optimized = 2 # Assume compiler can optimize the loop to use a 'cent'

    # Memory for inner loop counter 'j' (< 79 elements)
    mem_j = 2 # 'cent' is sufficient (2D)
    
    # Memory for a variable to track the size of the array (< 79 elements)
    mem_size = 2 # 'cent' is sufficient (2D)
    
    # Memory for the 'carry' variable during multiplication.
    # (max value of a 'cent' * max 'i' + carry) = 99 * 100 + carry = 9900 + carry
    # This requires an 'int' (6D).
    mem_carry = 6 # 'int' is required (6D)
