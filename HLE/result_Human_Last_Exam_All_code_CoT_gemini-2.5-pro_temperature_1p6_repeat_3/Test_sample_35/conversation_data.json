    "To determine the best hand to shove all-in (jam) with, we need to analyze the situation and evaluate which of the given hands is the most profitable.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** We have a 16 big blind (bb) stack in an early position (UTG+1) near the money bubble of a tournament.\n    *   **Stack Size (16bb):** This is a classic \"shove/fold\" stack. Calling or raising small is generally not an option. We must commit our entire stack or fold.\n    *   **Position (UTG+1):** This is an early position, meaning many players are left to act behind us. Shoving from here needs to be done with a relatively strong range of hands.\n    *   **Money Bubble:** This is the most crucial factor. Players with comfortable stacks will tighten their calling ranges significantly to avoid busting out and missing the prize money. This increases our \"fold equity,\" meaning our shoves will get through uncontested more often, allowing us to steal the blinds and antes.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hands:** We must determine the profitability of shoving each hand. Profitability (EV) comes from two sources:\n    *   The money we win when everyone folds (fold equity).\n    *   Our chance of winning the pot when we are called (showdown equity).\n\n    While all the hands listed (except possibly QJs in a very conservative view) are considered standard shoves according to modern Game Theory Optimal (GTO) charts, we can find the *best* option by comparing their performance when we get called.\n\n3.  **Compare Equities:** We will compare the equity of each hand against a plausible opponent calling range. Given the bubble dynamics, a player calling our shove will have a very strong, tight range. A reasonable assumption for this range is medium-to-high pairs and strong Aces, such as `88+, ATs+, AQo+`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Code:** The Python script below will present the equities of each hand against this calling range and determine which hand is the most profitable to shove by having the highest equity when called.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport io\n\n# Capture original stdout\noriginal_stdout = sys.stdout\n# Redirect stdout to a string buffer\nsys.stdout = captured_output = io.StringIO()\n\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker scenario to determine the best hand to shove all-in.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
