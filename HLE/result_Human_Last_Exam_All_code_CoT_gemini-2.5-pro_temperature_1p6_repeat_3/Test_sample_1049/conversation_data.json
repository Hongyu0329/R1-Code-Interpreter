    "To find a closed form for the sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{n}((2k+1)^5\\binom{2k}{k}\\binom{2n-2k}{n-k})$, we can use the method of generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Recognize the sum as a convolution of two sequences: $a_k = (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k}$ and $b_k = \\binom{2k}{k}$.\n2.  The sum $S_n$ is the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product of the generating functions $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} b_k x^k$.\n3.  The generating function for the central binomial coefficients is well-known: $B(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2k}{k} x^k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n4.  We will find the generating function $A(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^5 \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. This can be derived by repeatedly applying the operator $(2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1)$ to $B(x)$. Let's denote $A_m(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (2k+1)^m \\binom{2k}{k} x^k$. Then $A_0(x) = B(x)$ and $A_{m+1}(x) = (2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1) A_m(x)$.\n5.  After calculating $A_5(x)$, we will compute the product $S(x) = A_5(x) B(x)$.\n6.  Finally, we will extract the coefficient of $x^n$ from $S(x)$ to get the closed form for $S_n$.\n\nWe will use the symbolic mathematics library `sympy` in Python to perform these calculations, as they can be quite complex and prone to manual error. The code will derive the expression for $S_n$ and print it.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds a closed form for the sum:\n    Sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)**5 * C(2k, k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    using the generating functions method.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, n = sympy.symbols('x n')\n\n    # Define the generating function for C(2k, k)\n    B0 = (1 - 4*x)**(-sympy.Rational(1, 2))\n\n    # Define the operator (2*theta + 1), where theta = x*d/dx\n    def apply_operator(f):\n        return sympy.simplify(2 * x * sympy.diff(f, x) + f)\n\n    # Iteratively apply the operator to find A_5(x)\n    A = B0\n    print(\"Deriving generating functions A_m(x):\")\n    print(f\"A_0(x) = {A}\")\n    for m in range(5):\n        A = apply_operator(A)\n        print(f\"A_{m+1}(x) = {A}\")\n\n    A5 = A\n\n    # The generating function for the sum S_n is A_5(x) * B_0(x)\n    S_series = sympy.simplify(A5 * B0)\n    print(\"\\nGenerating function for the sum S_n:\")\n    print(f\"S(x) = A_5(x) * B_0(x) = {S_series}\")\n\n    # The resulting series is of the form P(x) / (1-4x)^6\n    # Extract the numerator polynomial P(x)\n    num, den = sympy.fraction(sympy.cancel(S_series))\n    P5x = sympy.expand(num)\n    \n    print(\"\\nNumerator polynomial P(x) in S(x) = P(x) / (1-4x)^6:\")\n    print(f\"P(x) = {P5x}\")\n\n    # Get coefficients of P(x)\n    p_coeffs = sympy.Poly(P5x, x).all_coeffs()\n    p_coeffs.reverse()  # Start with the coefficient of x^0\n    print(f\"\\nCoefficients of P(x) = c_0 + c_1*x + ...: {p_coeffs}\")\n\n    # The coefficient of x^k in (1-4x)^-m is C(k+m-1, m-1) * 4^k\n    # Here, m=6.
