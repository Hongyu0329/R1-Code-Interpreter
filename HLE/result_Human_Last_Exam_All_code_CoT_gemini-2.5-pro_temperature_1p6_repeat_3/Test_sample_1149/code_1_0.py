# The scientific paper by Sues et al. (2002) is the primary source for the anatomy of Irritator challengeri.
# In the description of the skull, the paper states that the lacrimal recess
# is "subdivided by a vertical ridge into two deep, rounded depressions."

# This variable stores the number of depressions based on the scientific description.
depressions_in_lacrimal_recess = 2

# The following lines will print the final answer and the 'equation'.
print(f"The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri is {depressions_in_lacrimal_recess}.")
print("Final Equation:")
print(f"{depressions_in_lacrimal_recess}")
