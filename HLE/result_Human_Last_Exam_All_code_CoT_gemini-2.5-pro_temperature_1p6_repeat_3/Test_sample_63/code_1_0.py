# The riddle asks for a man noted by Kurt Vonnegut,
# who looks like a porcupine and has an alliterative two-word name.

# 1. Vonnegut Connection: This character is mentioned by name in Vonnegut's
#    "Breakfast of Champions".
# 2. Porcupine-like look: His two large ears sticking straight up resemble quills.
# 3. Alliterative Name: Both words in his name start with the letter 'B'.

first_word = "Bugs"
second_word = "Bunny"

# Printing the name as a simple "equation" as requested.
print(f"{first_word} {second_word}")
