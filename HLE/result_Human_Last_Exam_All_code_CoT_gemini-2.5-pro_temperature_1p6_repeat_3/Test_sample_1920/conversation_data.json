    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Prime Factorization:** First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n2.  **Character Decomposition:** A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-principal (primitive) character modulo the prime factor $p_i$.\n3.  **Order of Characters:** The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We are given that this order must be 6.\n4.  **Counting Component Characters:** For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the group of characters modulo $p$ is cyclic of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of a specific order $m > 1$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$, provided that $m$ divides $p-1$.\n5.  **Combinatorial Counting:** We will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to count the number of ways to choose the component characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ such that their orders result in an lcm of 6.\n\nLet's execute this plan with a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    It counts the positive integers up to a given integer n\n    that are relatively prime to n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters for a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n    primes = [7, 13, 19, 31] # Prime factorization of 53599\n\n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {k}.\")\n    print(f\"The conductor d = {d} is square-free, with prime factors: {primes}.\")\n    print(\"A character chi is primitive with conductor d if and only if it is a product of non-principal characters\")\n    print(\"mod each prime factor p of d.
