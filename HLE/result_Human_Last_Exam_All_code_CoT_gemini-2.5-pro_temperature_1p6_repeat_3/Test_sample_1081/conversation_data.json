    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the group form:** First, we must determine which form of the group $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ we are dealing with. The classification of algebraic group forms is related to Galois cohomology. For the group $E_8$, its Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms, which implies it has no outer forms. All forms are inner forms. Over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the relevant Galois cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{ad})$ is trivial. This implies that there is only one isomorphism class of groups of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is the split Chevalley group.\n2.  **Use the standard formula:** The set of all maximal tori in $G$ forms a variety, denoted as $\\mathcal{T}$. The $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori are the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of this variety, $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. This variety can be identified with the homogeneous space $G/N$, where $N$ is the normalizer of a maximal torus $T$. For a split group $G$ and a split maximal torus $T_0$, the number of rational maximal tori is given by the formula:\n    $$ \\text{Number of tori} = \\frac{|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)|}{|N_G(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)|} $$\n3.  **Calculate the order of the group and the normalizer:**\n    *   The order of the group of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of a split group $G$ is given by Chevalley's formula: $|G(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = q^N \\prod_{i=1}^{r} (q^{d_i}-1)$, where $r$ is the rank, $N$ is the number of positive roots, and $d_i$ are the degrees of the fundamental invariants of the corresponding Weyl group.\n    *   For $E_8$: rank $r=8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$, and the degrees are $d_i \\in \\{2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30\\}$.\n    *   The normalizer of a split torus $T_0$ is $N_G(T_0)$. Its group of rational points has order $|N_G(T_0)(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = |T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| \\cdot |W(E_8)|$. For a split torus of rank 8, $|T_0(\\mathbb{F}_q)| = (q-1)^8$. The order of the Weyl group $|W(E_8)|$ is the product of its degrees, $|W(E_8)| = \\prod d_i$.\n4.  **Assemble the final formula:** By combining these pieces, we can construct the final formula for the number of tori.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the constant components of this formula and then prints the complete formula for the number of tori.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_e8_tori():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the components of the formula for the number of\n    Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E8.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # For a group of type E8, the rank is 8.\n    rank = 8\n    \n    # The dimension of the E8 group is 248.\n    # The number of roots is dim(G) - rank = 248 - 8 = 240.\n    # The number of positive roots N is half the number of roots.\n    num_positive_roots = 120\n    \n    # The degrees of the fundamental invariants for E8.\n    degrees = [2, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30]\n    \n    # The order of the Weyl group for E8 is the product of the degrees.\n    weyl_order = math.prod(degrees)\n    \n    print(\"The problem is to find the number of rational maximal tori of a group G of type E8 over a finite field Fq.\")\n    print(\"The group G is necessarily the split form of E8.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe key components of the formula are:\")\n    print(f\"1.
