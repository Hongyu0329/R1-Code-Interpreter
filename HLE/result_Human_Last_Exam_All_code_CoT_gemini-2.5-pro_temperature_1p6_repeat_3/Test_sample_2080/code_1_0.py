# Plan:
# 1. Define the typical partial specific volume (v_sp) for a monoclonal antibody. This is an intrinsic property of the protein.
# 2. Define the factor from the hard-sphere model that relates v_sp to the steric virial coefficient (B2,steric).
# 3. Calculate B2,steric using the formula: B2,steric = 4 * v_sp.
# 4. Print the explanation, the calculation with numerical values, and the final result.

# The partial specific volume (v_sp) for a typical monoclonal antibody (mAb) is a well-established value.
# This represents the volume occupied by the protein per unit mass.
v_sp = 0.73  # units: mL/g

# The second osmotic virial coefficient from steric-only interactions (B2,steric) is
# commonly approximated as 4 times the partial specific volume based on a hard-sphere model.
# This value is always positive, representing the repulsive nature of excluded volume.
factor = 4

# Perform the calculation. The experimental value of -7.585 mL/g is not needed for this calculation,
# as it includes strong attractive forces that we are asked to ignore.
b2_steric = factor * v_sp
