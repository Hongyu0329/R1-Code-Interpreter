# Step 1: Calculate the total number of distinct instructions.
# Stop: 1 state
# Turn Left: 2 speed levels
# Turn Right: 2 speed levels
# Move Forward: 4 speed levels
# Move Backward: 2 speed levels
num_stop_instructions = 1
num_left_instructions = 2
num_right_instructions = 2
num_forward_instructions = 4
num_backward_instructions = 2

total_unique_instructions = (
    num_stop_instructions
    + num_left_instructions
    + num_right_instructions
    + num_forward_instructions
    + num_backward_instructions
)

# Step 2: Calculate the minimum number of bits to represent one instruction.
# To represent N states, we need ceil(log2(N)) bits.
bits_per_instruction = math.ceil(math.log2(total_unique_instructions))

# Step 3: Calculate the total number of instructions for one Martian day.
# A Martian day (sol) is ~24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35 seconds.
# Let's convert this to minutes.
hours_in_sol = 24
minutes_in_sol_extra = 39.5 # A more precise value is ~39 minutes 35 seconds
earth_minutes_per_sol = (hours_in_sol * 60) + minutes_in_sol_extra

# Since an instruction is sent each minute, we need to cover all minutes in a sol.
# We take the ceiling to ensure we have enough instructions for the entire duration.
total_instructions_for_day = math.ceil(earth_minutes_per_sol)


# Step 4: Calculate the total memory in bytes.
# Total bits = total instructions * bits per instruction
# Total bytes = Total bits / 8
total_bits = total_instructions_for_day * bits_per_instruction
total_bytes = math.ceil(total_bits / 8)
