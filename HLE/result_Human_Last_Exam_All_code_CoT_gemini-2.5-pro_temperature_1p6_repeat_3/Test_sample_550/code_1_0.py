    This function calculates the dimension of the ninth cohomology group H^9(M, Q).

    The space M is the complement of a quaternionic hyperplane arrangement in H^4.
    A key theorem from algebraic topology states that the Poincaré polynomial of such a space
    is a polynomial in t^4. The Poincaré polynomial is P(t) = sum(dim(H^k(M, Q)) * t^k).
    This implies that the dimension of the k-th cohomology group can be non-zero only if k
    is a multiple of 4.

    The problem asks for the dimension when k=9. Since 9 is not a multiple of 4, the dimension must be 0.
