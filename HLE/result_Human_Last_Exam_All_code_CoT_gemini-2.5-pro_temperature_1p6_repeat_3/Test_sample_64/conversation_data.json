    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern of 「弟」 (otouto), we need to analyze how the pitch changes from one mora (a unit of sound similar to a syllable) to the next.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the morae:** Break down the word 「弟」 (otouto) into its individual morae.\n2.  **Determine the pitch pattern:** Find the standard pitch accent for this sequence of morae. In Japanese, pitch is relative, often described as High (H) or Low (L).\n3.  **Analyze the pattern with a particle:** A key step in identifying pitch accent is seeing what happens to the pitch when a particle (like 「が」) is attached to the word.\n4.  **Match the pattern to the categories:** Compare the observed pattern with the definitions of Heiban, Atamadaka, Nakadaka, and Odaka.\n5.  **Create a Python script:** Write a script to display the breakdown of the word, its pitch pattern, and the final classification.\n\nThe word 「弟」 is pronounced 「おとうと」 (o-to-u-to), which has four morae.\nThe standard pitch accent is Low-High-High-High.\n*   お (o) - Low\n*   と (to) - High\n*   う (u) - High\n*   と (to) - High\n\nWhen a particle like 「が」 is added, the particle also takes a High pitch (おとうとが -> L-H-H-H-H). Since the pitch rises after the first mora and never falls, this pattern is called **Heiban (平板)**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this analysis.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the pitch accent for the word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_kanji = \"弟\"\n    word_pronunciation = \"otouto\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    pitch_pattern = [\"L\", \"H\", \"H\", \"H\"]\n    classification = \"Heiban\"\n    choice = \"A\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the pitch accent for 「{word_kanji}」 ({word_pronunciation}).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"1. The word is broken down into four morae.\")\n    print(f\"   Morae: {morae}\")\n    print(\"\\n2. The standard pitch pattern is Low-High-High-High.\")\n\n    # This section fulfills the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n    # by showing the components (morae) and their state (pitch).\n    equation_str = \" + \".join([f\"{morae[i]}({pitch_pattern[i]})\" for i in range(len(morae))])\n    print(f\"   Pitch equation: {equation_str}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n3. When a particle like 「が」 is added, the pitch remains high:\")\n    print(f\"   {equation_str} + が(H)\")\n\n    print(\"\\n4. A pattern that starts low, rises, and does not fall at the end of the word is classified as Heiban (平板).\")\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(f\"The pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is {classification}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to Answer Choice: {choice}\")\n\nanalyze_pitch_accent()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
