    "My plan is to determine the oligomeric state of the provided coiled-coil sequence by analyzing its amino acid pattern.\n\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat**: Coiled-coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The core packing of the helices is determined by the amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions, which are typically hydrophobic. I will analyze the sequence to find the correct \"frame\" for this repeat, ensuring that hydrophobic residues consistently fall at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\n2.  **Analyze Core Residues**: Once the correct frame is established, I will identify the most common amino acids at the `a` and `d` positions. The specific combination of these core residues is a strong predictor of the number of helices in the coil (the oligomeric state).\n\n3.  **Apply Packing Rules**: I will use well-established rules from structural biology studies (e.g., Harbury et al., 1993) that correlate the identity of the `a` and `d` residues to the oligomeric state:\n    *   **Isoleucine at `a`**, **Leucine at `d`** -> Dimer (2)\n    *   **Leucine at `a`**, **Isoleucine at `d`** -> Trimer (3)\n    *   **Isoleucine at both `a` and `d`** -> Trimer (3)\n    *   **Leucine at both `a` and `d`** -> Tetramer (4)\n\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to automate this analysis. The script will find the optimal heptad frame, extract the `a` and `d` residues, and apply the rules to print the final prediction and the reasoning behind it.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on the\n    residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing sequence:\", sequence)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Simplified classification: 1 for hydrophobic, 0 for other\n    hydrophobic_residues = \"AGVILMFPW\"\n    hydrophobicity = {res: 1 if res in hydrophobic_residues else 0 for res in \"ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY\"}\n\n    best_frame = -1\n    max_score = -1\n    \n    # Step 1: Find the best heptad repeat frame by maximizing hydrophobicity at a/d positions\n    print(\"Step 1: Finding the optimal heptad repeat frame...\")\n    for frame_start in range(7):\n        current_score = 0\n        is_bad_frame = False\n        # In a valid frame, 'g' position should ideally not be strongly hydrophobic\n        # We also check that a/d are consistently hydrophobic\n        \n        a_and_d_positions = []\n        for i in range(frame_start, len(sequence), 7):\n            if i < len(sequence):\n                a_and_d_positions.append(sequence[i])\n            if i + 3 < len(sequence):\n                a_and_d_positions.append(sequence[i+3])\n\n        # A good frame has hydrophobic residues at a/d\n        score = sum(hydrophobicity.get(res, 0) for res in a_and_d_positions)\n        \n        # A bad frame has a very hydrophobic residue at 'g'\n        g_residues = [sequence[i+6] for i in range(frame_start, len(sequence) - 6, 7)]\n        if any(res in 'LIVMW' for res in g_residues):\n             score -= 5 # Penalize heavily\n\n        if score > max_score:\n            max_score = score\n            best_frame = frame_start\n    \n    print(f\"Optimal frame starts with residue {best_frame+1} ('{sequence[best_frame]}') at position 'a'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the dominant residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions for the best frame\n    print(\"Step 2: Identifying core residues from the optimal frame...\")\n    a_residues = [sequence[i] for i in range(best_frame, len(sequence), 7)]\n    d_residues = [sequence[i+3] for i in range(best_frame, len(sequence) - 3, 7)]\n\n    dominant_a = collections.Counter(a_residues).most_common(1)[0][0]\n    dominant_d = collections.Counter(d_residues).most_common(1)[0][0]\n\n    print(f\"Residues at core position 'a': {', '.join(a_residues)}\")\n    print(f\"Residues at core position 'd': {', '.join(d_residues)}\")\n    print(f\"This reveals a dominant pattern of '{dominant_a}' at the 'a' positions and '{dominant_d}' at the 'd' positions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Apply prediction rules\n    print(\"Step 3: Applying prediction rules for oligomeric state...\")\n    oligomer_state = 0\n    reason = \"No definitive rule matched.\"\n\n    if dominant_a == 'I' and dominant_d == 'L':\n        oligomer_state = 2\n        reason = f\"The Ia-Ld pattern ('{dominant_a}' at 'a', '{dominant_d}' at 'd') is characteristic of a dimer.\"\n    elif dominant_a == 'L' and dominant_d == 'I':\n        oligomer_state = 3\n        reason = f\"The La-Id pattern ('{dominant_a}' at 'a', '{dominant_d}' at 'd') strongly favors a trimer for efficient core packing.\"\n    elif dominant_a == 'I' and dominant_d == 'I':\n        oligomer_state = 3\n        reason = f\"The Ia-Id pattern ('{dominant_a}' at 'a', '{dominant_d}' at 'd') favors a trimeric state.\"\n    elif dominant_a == 'L' and dominant_d == 'L':\n        oligomer_state = 4\n        reason = f\"The La-Ld pattern ('{dominant_a}' at 'a', '{dominant_d}' at 'd') often forms a tetramer to relieve steric strain.\"\n\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(reason)\n    # The final 'equation' as requested\n    print(f\"The rule '{dominant_a} at a' + '{dominant_d} at d' predicts an oligomeric state of: {oligomer_state}\")\n\n# The sequence provided by the user\nprotein_sequence = \"GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG\"\n\n# Run the prediction\npredict_oligomeric_state(protein_sequence)\n<<<B>>>\n```"
