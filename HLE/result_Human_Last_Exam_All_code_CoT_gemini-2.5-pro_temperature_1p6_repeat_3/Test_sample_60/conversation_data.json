    "My plan is to solve this problem by creating a universal Turing Machine simulator in Python.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Parse the Input**: I will first need to parse the compact string representation for each Turing Machine. Based on the structure, it appears to be a 5-state, 2-symbol machine (States A-E, Symbols 0-1). The 10 instructions in the string likely correspond to the transitions for `(State A, read 0)`, `(State A, read 1)`, `(State B, read 0)`, `(State B, read 1)`, and so on. I will create a function to parse these strings into a more usable dictionary format, like `{(state, read_symbol): (next_state, write_symbol, direction)}`.\n2.  **Build the Simulator**: The simulator will manage the machine's state, its tape, and the head's position.\n    *   The tape will be represented by a dictionary to allow for infinite growth in both directions, with unwritten cells defaulting to 0.\n    *   The simulation will start in state 'A' at position 0 on a blank tape.\n    *   In a loop, the simulator will read the tape, find the correct rule, update the tape, move the head, change the state, and count the step.\n3.  **Run and Compare**: The simulation will run for each of the three machines until they reach the 'H' (Halt) state. I will record the number of steps each machine takes.\n4.  **Output the Result**: Finally, I will compare the step counts, identify the machine that ran for the longest, and print the results for all machines, highlighting the winner and its total step count as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_rules(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parses a compact rule string into a dictionary for the TM simulator.\n    Format is assumed to be (A,0),(A,1),(B,0),(B,1), etc.\n    \"\"\"\n    rules = {}\n    parts = rule_string.split()\n    # Determine the number of states (excluding Halt)\n    num_states = len(parts) // 2\n    state_names = [chr(ord('A') + i) for i in range(num_states)]\n\n    for i, state in enumerate(state_names):\n        # Rule for reading 0\n        rule_0_str = parts[2 * i]\n        new_state_0 = rule_0_str[0]\n        write_symbol_0 = int(rule_0_str[1])\n        direction_0 = 1 if rule_0_str[2] == 'R' else -1\n        rules[(state, 0)] = (new_state_0, write_symbol_0, direction_0)\n\n        # Rule for reading 1\n        rule_1_str = parts[2 * i + 1]\n        new_state_1 = rule_1_str[0]\n        write_symbol_1 = int(rule_1_str[1])\n        direction_1 = 1 if rule_1_str[2] == 'R' else -1\n        rules[(state, 1)] = (new_state_1, write_symbol_1, direction_1)\n\n    return rules\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rules, max_steps=50000000):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a Turing Machine based on a given set of rules.\n    \"\"\"\n    tape = {}\n    head_position = 0\n    current_state = 'A'\n    steps = 0\n\n    while current_state != 'H' and steps < max_steps:\n        # Read symbol from tape, default to 0 for blank cells\n        read_symbol = tape.get(head_position, 0)\n\n        # Look up transition rule\n        try:\n            new_state, write_symbol, direction = rules[(current_state, read_symbol)]\n        except KeyError:\n            print(f\"Error: No rule found for State {current_state} reading Symbol {read_symbol}.
