# My analysis indicates that Document 1 is the most relevant for both questions.
# For Question 1, "at a few months old" is a better match for "as a baby" than "at puberty".
# For Question 2, while the direct evidence is identical in both, Document 1 provides a better context.
# Therefore, the final answer is 1-1.
