The complete set of relations is:
1. A_i^2 = I for i = 1, 2, 3, 4.
2. Commutation relations: [A_1, A_3] = 0, [A_1, A_4] = 0, [A_2, A_3] = 0.
3. Other relations: (A_1*A_2)^3 = I, (A_2*A_4)^3 = I, (A_3*A_4)^3 = I.

A deep analysis of this system of relations reveals a strong constraint on the matrices.
- The commuting matrices A_1 and A_3 are simultaneously diagonalizable.
- Let V be the vector space C^1000. It decomposes into simultaneous eigenspaces V_{l1, l3} where A_1 acts as l1*I and A_3 as l3*I (l1, l3 in {+1, -1}).
- On each such eigenspace, the relation (A_1*A_2)^3 = I implies (l1*A_2)^3 = I. With A_2^2 = I, this forces A_2 = l1*I on V_{l1, l3}.
- Similarly, (A_3*A_4)^3 = I forces A_4 = l3*I on V_{l1, l3}.
- The final relation (A_2*A_4)^3 = I must hold, which on V_{l1, l3} means (l1*l3*I)^3 = I, implying l1*l3 = 1.
- This forces the eigenspaces where l1 != l3 to be trivial (zero-dimensional). So, on the entire space V, A_1 and A_3 must have the same eigenvalues for each common eigenvector, which implies A_1 = A_3.
- Following this logic, all four matrices must be equal: A_1 = A_2 = A_3 = A_4 = A.
- The only condition left on A is A^2 = I.

The set S is thus equivalent to { (A, A, A, A) | A is in GL(1000, C) and A^2 = I }.
The action of G on S is B * (A,A,A,A) = (B*A*B^{-1}, B*A*B^{-1}, B*A*B^{-1}, B*A*B^{-1}).
The number of orbits |S/G| is the number of distinct conjugacy classes of matrices A such that A^2 = I.

A matrix A with A^2 = I is diagonalizable with eigenvalues in {+1, -1}.
Its conjugacy class is uniquely determined by the number of +1 eigenvalues, let's call it k.
The dimension of the matrices is n = 1000.
k can be any integer from 0 (all eigenvalues are -1) to 1000 (all eigenvalues are +1).
So, we need to count the number of possible values for k.
