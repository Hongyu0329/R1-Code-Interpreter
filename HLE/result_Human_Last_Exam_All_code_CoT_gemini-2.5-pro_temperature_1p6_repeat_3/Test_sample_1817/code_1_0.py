    Based on the analysis:
    - A is inappropriate because logic should not be in the Controller.
    - B is inappropriate because it creates a God Object, violating SRP.
    - C is appropriate as it correctly distributes responsibilities.
    - D is inappropriate as it describes an Anemic Domain Model, an anti-pattern in this context.
    - E is appropriate as it correctly uses a Domain Service to orchestrate rich Domain Objects.
