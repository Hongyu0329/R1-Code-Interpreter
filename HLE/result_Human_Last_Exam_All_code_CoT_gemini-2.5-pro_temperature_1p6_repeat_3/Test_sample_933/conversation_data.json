    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the answer, followed by the Python code to present the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n1.  **Analyze the Chemical Reaction:** The synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) involves the direct reaction between Xenon (Xe) and Fluorine (F₂) gas. The specific product formed (XeF₂, XeF₄, or XeF₆) depends critically on the reaction conditions, including temperature, pressure, and the ratio of the reactants.\n\n2.  **The Synthesis Equation:** The balanced chemical equation for the formation of Xenon tetrafluoride is:\n    Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    This typically requires a Xenon to Fluorine molar ratio of about 1:5 to ensure the reaction proceeds efficiently towards XeF₄ without forming significant amounts of other xenon fluorides.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Temperature Effects:**\n    *   **Low Temperatures (e.g., below 200°C):** At lower temperatures, the activation energy for the reaction is not met, and the reaction rate is extremely slow, making the process inefficient for practical synthesis.\n    *   **Optimal Temperature for XeF₄:** The standard, well-documented temperature for producing XeF₄ efficiently is approximately **400°C**. At this temperature, the reaction rate is high, and the yield of XeF₄ is maximized when the correct reactant ratio is used.\n    *   **High Temperatures (e.g., above 500°C):** At higher temperatures, especially with an excess of fluorine, the reaction tends to produce Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) instead of XeF₄. For instance, at 600°C, XeF₆ is the favored product.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Answer Choices:**\n    *   A. 600 C: Too high, favors XeF₆.\n    *   B. 400 C: The ideal temperature for efficient XeF₄ synthesis.\n    *   C. 200 C: Too low for an \"efficient\" reaction rate.\n    *   D. 78 C: Far too low for a thermal reaction.\n    *   E. 0 C: Far too low.\n    *   F. -78 C: Far too low.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on established chemical principles, 400°C is the coldest temperature among the given options at which XeF₄ can be synthesized efficiently.\n\nHere is the Python code that automates this reasoning and provides the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chemistry_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the coldest temperature for efficient synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4)\n    by analyzing known chemical facts.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The chemical equation for the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride.\n    equation = {\n        \"reactants\": {\"Xe\": 1, \"F2\": 2},\n        \"products\": {\"XeF4\": 1}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the chemical reaction for Xenon tetrafluoride synthesis.\")\n    print(\"Xe(g) + 2F2(g) -> XeF4(s)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers (stoichiometric coefficients) in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"  - Xenon (Xe): {equation['reactants']['Xe']}\")\n    print(f\"  - Fluorine (F2): {equation['reactants']['F2']}\")\n    print(f\"  - Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4): {equation['products']['XeF4']}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the effect of temperature on the reaction.\")\n    print(\"The production of different xenon fluorides is highly temperature-dependent.\")\n    synthesis_facts = {\n        \"600 C\": \"Favors the formation of XeF6 (Xenon hexafluoride), especially with excess fluorine.\",\n        \"400 C\": \"The standard and optimal temperature for efficient synthesis of XeF4 (Xenon tetrafluoride).\",\n        \"200 C\": \"Reaction rate is too slow for the process to be considered efficient.\",\n        \"< 100 C\": \"Thermal reaction is practically nonexistent.\"\n    }\n\n    print(\" - At very high temperatures (e.g., 600 C):\", synthesis_facts[\"600 C\"])\n    print(\" - At moderate temperatures (e.g., 400 C):\", synthesis_facts[\"400 C\"])\n    print(\" - At lower temperatures (e.g., 200 C):\", synthesis_facts[\"200 C\"])\n    print(\" - At room temperature and below:\", synthesis_facts[\"< 100 C\"])\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluate the options to find the coldest temperature for EFFICIENT synthesis.\")\n    print(\"Based on the analysis, 400 C is the established temperature for an efficient reaction.
