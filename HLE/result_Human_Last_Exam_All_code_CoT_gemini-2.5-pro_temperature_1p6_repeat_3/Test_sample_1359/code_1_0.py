    Solves the matrix puzzle by calculating the missing elements and their sum.

    The strategy is to apply the horizontal transformation rules sequentially,
    as suggested by the 'left-to-right' processing order. The inconsistencies
    in the provided data for the first two rows are treated as red herrings.

    1. Calculate the middle triplet of row 3 from the left triplet of row 3.
    2. Calculate the right triplet of row 3 from the new middle triplet.
    3. Sum all the elements of the two new triplets.
