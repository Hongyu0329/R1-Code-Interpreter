def solve_for_n_resolvability():
    """
    This function solves for the integer 'n' based on the properties of a tame functor.

    The problem is set in the context of the representation theory of posets.
    The key information provided is that the functor F is "tame". In representation
    theory, algebras are classified as being of finite, tame, or wild representation
    type. This classification has profound implications for the structure and homological
    properties of their modules (or, in this case, functors to vector spaces).

    The term 'n-resolvable' refers to the homological property that a module's (or functor's)
    minimal projective resolution becomes periodic with period 'n' after a finite number
    of steps. That is, the (k+n)-th syzygy is isomorphic to the k-th syzygy for all large k.

    A fundamental result for tame algebras (including poset algebras of tame type)
    is that the indecomposable modules that are not preprojective or preinjective
    (i.e., the regular modules) have periodic projective resolutions with a period of 2.
    This stems from the Auslander-Reiten theory, specifically the relation τ ≅ Ω², where
    τ is the Auslander-Reiten translation and Ω is the syzygy operator.

    Thus, the property of being "tame" implies that n=2. The other technical details
    in the problem (discretization by a functor f, exactness of f^k) serve to
    ensure that F is part of a representation category where this theory applies.
