    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Recall the formula for the simplicial volume of a surface.** The simplicial volume of a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g$ is denoted by $\\|\\Sigma_g\\|$. The formula depends on the genus:\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 0$ if $g=0$ or $g=1$.\n    *   $\\|\\Sigma_g\\| = 4g - 4$ if $g \\ge 2$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volumes of the individual surfaces.**\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{31}$, the genus is $g_1=31$. Since $31 \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| = 4 \\times 31 - 4 = 120$.\n    *   For $\\Sigma_{17}$, the genus is $g_2=17$. Since $17 \\ge 2$, its simplicial volume is $\\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 4 \\times 17 - 4 = 64$.\n\n3.  **Recall Gromov's product formula for simplicial volume.** For two closed, oriented manifolds $M$ and $N$ of dimensions $m$ and $n$ respectively, the simplicial volume of their product $M \\times N$ is given by:\n    $\\|M \\times N\\| = C(m+n, m) \\cdot \\|M\\| \\cdot \\|N\\|$\n    where $C(k, j)$ is the binomial coefficient \"k choose j\".\n\n4.  **Apply the formula to our case.**\n    *   Both $\\Sigma_{31}$ and $\\Sigma_{17}$ are surfaces, so their dimensions are $m=2$ and $n=2$.\n    *   The required binomial coefficient is $C(2+2, 2) = C(4, 2) = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = 6$.\n    *   Plugging the values into the formula gives:\n        $\\|\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}\\| = C(4, 2) \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{31}\\| \\cdot \\|\\Sigma_{17}\\| = 6 \\cdot 120 \\cdot 64$.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this final calculation and display the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the genera of the surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# Dimensions of the surfaces (both are 2-dimensional)\nm = 2\nn = 2\n\n# Formula for the simplicial volume of a surface Sigma_g for g >= 2\ndef simplicial_volume_surface(g):\n  if g < 2:\n    return 0\n  return 4 * g - 4\n\n# Calculate the simplicial volume for each surface\nvol1 = simplicial_volume_surface(g1)\nvol2 = simplicial_volume_surface(g2)\n\n# Calculate the binomial coefficient C(m+n, m)\ntotal_dim = m + n\nbinom_coeff = math.comb(total_dim, m)\n\n# Apply Gromov's product formula\ntotal_volume = binom_coeff * vol1 * vol2\n\n# Print the final equation with all the computed values\nprint(\"The simplicial volume of Σ_{31} x Σ_{17} is calculated using Gromov's product formula:\")\nprint(\"||Σ_{31} x Σ_{17}|| = C(dim(Σ_{31}) + dim(Σ_{17}), dim(Σ_{31})) * ||Σ_{31}|| * ||Σ_{17}||\")\nprint(f\"\\nWhere:\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{31}|| = 4*{g1} - 4 = {vol1}\")\nprint(f\"||Σ_{17}|| = 4*{g2} - 4 = {vol2}\")\nprint(f\"C({total_dim}, {m}) = {binom_coeff}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\nprint(f\"{binom_coeff} * {vol1} * {vol2} = {total_volume}\")\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
