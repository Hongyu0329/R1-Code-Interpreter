The question asks for the mechanism by which magnesium supplementation helps lower blood pressure.

The correct mechanism is A: {options['A']}.

Here is the reasoning:
Magnesium acts as a natural physiological calcium channel blocker. It competes with calcium ions for entry into the smooth muscle cells that line the blood vessel walls. When magnesium is present in adequate amounts, it blocks some of the calcium from entering these cells. This action causes the smooth muscle to relax, leading to a widening of the blood vessels, a phenomenon known as vasodilation. Vasodilation reduces the overall resistance in the circulatory system, which in turn leads to a decrease in blood pressure.

The other options are incorrect:
- B: While magnesium plays a role in preventing arterial calcification, this is a long-term effect and not the primary mechanism for lowering blood pressure.
- C: Magnesium is crucial for brain function, but its effect on blood pressure is not through increasing brain matter.
- D: Magnesium has anti-inflammatory properties; stimulating inflammation would be counterproductive to lowering blood pressure.
- E: Magnesium and calcium are antagonists. Magnesium does not raise blood calcium levels.
