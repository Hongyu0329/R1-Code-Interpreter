    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set:**\n    *   For each heavy atom (like Carbon), the core orbitals (1s) are described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians). The valence orbitals (2s, 2p) are split into two: an inner part described by 1 contracted function per orbital (3 primitives each) and an outer part described by 1 contracted function per orbital (1 primitive each). This results in 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence s,p) + 4 (outer valence s,p) = 9 contracted functions per Carbon atom.\n    *   For each Hydrogen atom, there are no core orbitals. The 1s valence orbital is split into two parts: an inner part (1 contracted function from 3 primitives) and an outer part (1 contracted function from 1 primitive). This results in 1 + 1 = 2 contracted functions per Hydrogen atom.\n\n2.  **Count the Atoms in Toluene (C7H8):**\n    *   Number of Carbon (C) atoms = 7\n    *   Number of Hydrogen (H) atoms = 8\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total:**\n    *   Total from Carbon: 7 atoms * 9 functions/atom = 63 functions\n    *   Total from Hydrogen: 8 atoms * 8 functions/atom = 16 functions\n    *   Grand Total: 63 + 16 = 79 functions\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the steps.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule formula: C7H8\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for C and H in the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (a heavy atom):\n# 1s (core) -> 1 contracted function\n# 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz (inner valence) -> 4 contracted functions\n# 2s, 2px, 2py, 2pz (outer valence) -> 4 contracted functions\n# Total per C = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9\ncgf_per_C = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen:\n# 1s (inner valence) -> 1 contracted function\n# 1s (outer valence) -> 1 contracted function\n# Total per H = 1 + 1 = 2\ncgf_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted functions for each element\ntotal_C = num_C * cgf_per_C\ntotal_H = num_H * cgf_per_H\n\n# Calculate the grand total\ntotal_cgf = total_C + total_H\n\n# Print the final result and the equation\nprint(\"Calculation for Toluene (C7H8) with 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Total from Carbon: {num_C} atoms * {cgf_per_C} functions/atom = {total_C}\")\nprint(f\"Total from Hydrogen: {num_H} atoms * {cgf_per_H} functions/atom = {total_H}\")\nprint(f\"Total contracted Gaussian functions = {total_C} + {total_H} = {total_cgf}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
