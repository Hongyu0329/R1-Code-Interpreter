    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem and generate the Python code.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Initial Quantum Numbers:** A \"p-electron\" has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1`. As an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Determine Possible Total Angular Momentum (`j`):** The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, arises from the coupling of `l` and `s`. Its possible values are determined by the rule: `j` can range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n3.  **Find Possible Magnetic Quantum Numbers (`m_j`):** For each value of `j`, the associated magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take any value from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate the Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalues for the $J^2$ operator are calculated using the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalues for the $J_z$ operator are calculated using the formula $\\hbar m_j$.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that calculates these values and prints them out clearly. The output will show the quantum numbers `j` and `m_j` and the corresponding eigenvalue calculations, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # orbital angular momentum for a p-orbital\n    s = 0.5  # spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    # Use unicode characters for clarity in the output\n    hbar = \"\\u0127\"\n    hbar_sq = \"\\u0127\\u00b2\"\n\n    print(\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J\\u00b2 and Jz for a p-electron.\")\n    print(f\"The electron has orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible values for j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # Values of j go from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {list(j_values)}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, find mj values and calculate all eigenvalues\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"  The eigenvalue of J\\u00b2 is {hbar_sq} * j * (j + 1)\")\n        print(f\"  = {hbar_sq} * {j} * ({j} + 1) = {j_squared_eigenvalue} {hbar_sq}\")\n        \n        # Determine possible m_j values\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values are {list(mj_values)}.\")\n        print(f\"  The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are:\")\n        \n        # Calculate J_z eigenvalues for each m_j\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            jz_eigenvalue = mj\n            # The format specifier ensures nice alignment for positive and negative numbers\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {mj: >4.1f}, the eigenvalue is {jz_eigenvalue: >4.1f} {hbar}\")\n            \n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nsolve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<J^2 eigenvalues in units of ħ^2: 3.75, 0.75.
