    "To determine the Böttcher Molecular Complexity of the product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** First, I'll determine the chemical product of the Favorskii rearrangement reaction starting with 2-chlorocyclohexanone. This reaction involves treating the α-haloketone with a base, which typically results in a ring contraction. The 6-membered ring of 2-chlorocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂).\n\n2.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC):** I will use the following formula to calculate the BMC:\n    `BMC = (Number of Atoms * Number of Bonds * Number of Rings) / Number of Rotatable Bonds`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Parameters for the Product:** For cyclopentanecarboxylic acid, I will calculate each component of the BMC formula:\n    *   **Number of Atoms:** Sum of all atoms (C, H, O) in the molecule.\n    *   **Number of Bonds:** The total number of covalent bonds. For a molecule with one ring, this is equal to the number of atoms.\n    *   **Number of Rings:** The count of cyclic structures in the molecule.\n    *   **Number of Rotatable Bonds:** The number of single bonds that are not in a ring and do not connect to a terminal hydrogen atom.\n\n4.  **Compute the Final Value:** I will substitute these calculated values into the BMC formula to get the final answer. The code will then print out the full equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Identify the product and its properties.\n# The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone results in a ring contraction,\n# yielding the product cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n# The chemical formula is C6H10O2.\n\n# Step 2: Define a function to calculate Böttcher Molecular Complexity (BMC).\ndef calculate_bmc(name, num_atoms, num_bonds, num_rings, num_rotatable_bonds):\n    \"\"\"Calculates and prints the Böttcher Molecular Complexity.\"\"\"\n    print(f\"Calculating Böttcher Molecular Complexity for: {name}\")\n    print(f\"Molecular formula: C6H10O2\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"1.
