Yes, the ammonia molecule with exotic, spin-zero hydrogen atoms would still exhibit tunneling.

Here's the reasoning:

1.  **What is Tunneling?** Ammonia inversion tunneling is a quantum phenomenon where the nitrogen atom passes through the potential energy barrier created by the plane of the three hydrogen atoms. The existence and rate of this tunneling are determined by the height and width of this energy barrier and the masses of the atoms involved.

2.  **What Determines the Energy Barrier?** The potential energy barrier is governed by the electrostatic forces (Coulomb forces) between the atomic nuclei and the surrounding electrons. It is not significantly affected by the nuclear spin of the atoms. The magnetic interactions related to spin are many orders of magnitude weaker than the electrostatic forces that define the molecular shape and energy landscape.

3.  **The Role of Particle Statistics:**
    *   Normal hydrogen nuclei (protons) have spin-1/2 and are **fermions**. The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that the total wavefunction of the molecule must be antisymmetric when two identical protons are exchanged.
    *   The hypothetical exotic hydrogen nuclei have spin-0 and would be **bosons**. The symmetry rule for bosons requires the total wavefunction to be symmetric upon particle exchange.

4.  **Conclusion:** Changing the hydrogens from fermions to bosons changes the overall symmetry requirements for the molecule's total wavefunction. This alters which rotational states are allowed to exist, and this would lead to observable differences in the molecule's rotational and rovibrational spectrum. However, since the potential energy barrier for inversion is unchanged, the fundamental physical process of tunneling would still occur. The ground vibrational state would still be split into a symmetric and antisymmetric pair (the inversion doublet), which is the definitive signature of tunneling.
