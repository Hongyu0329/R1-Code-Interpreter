    "My plan is to determine the structure of the hydrocarbon by systematically interpreting the provided data.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE):** I will use the molecular formula C₇H₁₄ to find the DBE. This will tell us if the molecule contains any rings or double/triple bonds. The formula for DBE is `C + 1 - (H/2)`.\n2.  **Analyze the Number of NMR Signals:** The molecular formula has 7 carbons, but there are only 6 NMR signals. This indicates that the molecule possesses some symmetry, causing two of the carbon atoms to be chemically equivalent and produce a single signal.\n3.  **Interpret Each NMR Signal:** I will analyze each signal's chemical shift (in ppm) and multiplicity (s, t, d, q) to identify the structural fragments.\n    *   **Chemical Shift:** Shifts greater than 100 ppm typically indicate carbons in a C=C double bond (alkene). Shifts less than 100 ppm indicate carbons in single bonds (alkane).\n    *   **Multiplicity:** This tells us the number of hydrogen atoms attached to each carbon: `(s)` for a singlet (0 H), `(t)` for a triplet (2 H's), `(d)` for a doublet (1 H), and `(q)` for a quartet (3 H's).\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:** I will piece together the identified fragments, keeping the molecular symmetry in mind, to build the final structure.\n5.  **Verify and Name:** Finally, I will verify that the proposed structure is consistent with all the provided data and then determine its official IUPAC name.\n\nI will implement this step-by-step reasoning in a Python script.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hydrocarbon_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a hydrocarbon from its molecular formula and 13C NMR data\n    by following a systematic analysis and prints the step-by-step reasoning.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Given Data ---\n    carbons = 7\n    hydrogens = 14\n    nmr_data_str = \"145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DBE) for C7H14.\")\n    # The equation is: DBE = C + 1 - (H / 2)\n    dbe = carbons + 1 - (hydrogens / 2)\n    # Output the equation with the specific numbers\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {carbons} + 1 - ({hydrogens} / 2) = {int(dbe)}\")\n    print(\"A DBE of 1 means the molecule contains one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 2: Analyze Signal Count for Symmetry ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the number of 13C NMR signals.\")\n    num_signals = len(nmr_data_str.split(','))\n    print(f\"The molecular formula has {carbons} carbons, but the spectrum shows only {num_signals} signals.\")\n    print(\"This indicates molecular symmetry, meaning two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 3: Interpret Individual Signals ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Interpret each signal to identify structural fragments.\")\n    print(\"Multiplicity key: s=C(0H), t=CH2(2H), d=CH(1H), q=CH3(3H)\")\n    print(\"Chemical shift key: >100ppm=alkene, <100ppm=alkane\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"145(s): A quaternary (C) carbon in a double bond (>C=).\")\n    print(\"112(t): A CH2 carbon in a double bond (=CH2).\")\n    print(\" -> These two signals indicate a disubstituted terminal alkene group: >C=CH2\")\n    print(\"48(t): An alkane CH2 group.\")\n    print(\"27(d): An alkane CH group.\")\n    print(\"22(q): An alkane CH3 group.\")\n    print(\"21(q): Another alkane CH3 group.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50, \"\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Assemble Fragments ---\n    print(\"Step 4: Assemble the fragments into a complete structure.\")\n    print(\"We have the following pieces: a >C=CH2 unit, a -CH2- group, a -CH- group, and two -CH3 groups.\")\n    print(\"To account for 7 carbons with 6 signals, one signal must represent two carbons.
