    "To determine what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the current word's origin:** The modern word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers.\n2.  **Find the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word:** Before the Norse influence, the word used by the Anglo-Saxons for \"sister\" was \"sweostor.\"\n3.  **Trace the likely evolution of the Old English word:** We can predict how \"sweostor\" would have evolved by comparing it to other Old English words that survived into Modern English, like \"brōþor\" (brother) and \"mōdor\" (mother).\n    *   The vowel sound \"eo\" in \"sweostor\" would likely have simplified to an \"e\" sound.\n    *   The \"-or\" ending would likely have changed to \"-er,\" as it did in \"brother\" and \"mother.\"\n    *   The initial \"sw-\" would likely have remained.\n\nFollowing this path, the Old English \"sweostor\" would have naturally evolved into the word \"swester.\" In fact, the word \"suster\" or \"swester\" did exist in Middle English, but it was eventually replaced by the Norse-derived \"sister.\"\n\nThe following Python code explains this etymological journey and prints the final, hypothetical word.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    if the Norse had never influenced the English language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The original Old English word for \"sister\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    # The Old Norse word that gave us our modern \"sister\"\n    norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n\n    # The hypothetical Modern English word is derived by applying\n    # natural English sound changes to the Old English word.\n    # 1. The \"eo\" vowel sound simplifies to \"e\".\n    # 2. The \"-or\" ending evolves to \"-er\".\n    # 3. The \"sw-\" beginning is retained.\n    hypothetical_word = \"swester\"\n\n    print(f\"If the Norse had never invaded the Anglo-Saxons:\")\n    print(f\"- The Old Norse word '{norse_word}' would not have replaced the native word.\")\n    print(f\"- The original Old English word was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"- Following a similar evolution to words like 'brother' (from 'brōþor'),\")\n    print(f\"  '{old_english_word}' would have likely evolved into:\")\n    print(f\"\\n{hypothetical_word}\")\n\nfind_alternate_word()\n<<<swester>>>\n```"
