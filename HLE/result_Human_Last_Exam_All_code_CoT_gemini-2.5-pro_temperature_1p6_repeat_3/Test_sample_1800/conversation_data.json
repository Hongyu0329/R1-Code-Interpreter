    "Of course. Here is a plan to address your question.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Acknowledge Complexity**: The \"ideal\" Ni/Ce ratio is not a single universal value but falls within a range that depends on the synthesis method, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure), and desired outcome (e.g., maximum conversion vs. long-term stability).\n2.  **Consult Scientific Literature**: Based on experimental studies, the optimal catalytic performance is often found when Ni is highly dispersed as nanoparticles or even single atoms on the ceria support. This strong metal-support interaction is key. This typically occurs at lower Ni loadings.\n3.  **Identify a Representative Ratio**: A commonly reported optimal range for the molar ratio of Ni/(Ni+Ce) is between 0.1 and 0.3. This balances having enough active Ni sites without causing them to agglomerate into larger, less effective particles.\n4.  **Develop a Python Script**: The script will not discover this ratio but will demonstrate the relationship between the more scientifically fundamental **molar ratio** and the practical **weight percent (wt%)**. It will take a representative molar ratio from the optimal range (e.g., 0.2) and calculate the corresponding wt% of Ni.\n5.  **Output the Calculation**: The script will print out each step of the calculation to satisfy the request to show all numbers in the final equation. This will clarify how scientists move between these two important metrics.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n# This script calculates the weight percent (wt%) of Nickel in a Ni-Ceria catalyst\n# for a given optimal molar ratio, based on scientific literature.\n\ndef calculate_catalyst_composition():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the composition of a Ni-Ceria catalyst.\n\n    The ideal Ni/Ce ratio for catalytic activity (WGS, WS) is not a single number\n    but a range. Scientific literature suggests an optimal molar fraction of Ni,\n    X_Ni = Ni / (Ni + Ce), is often between 0.1 and 0.3. We will use a\n    representative value of 0.2 for this calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define constants\n    # Atomic mass in grams per mole (g/mol)\n    atomic_mass_Ni = 58.69\n    atomic_mass_Ce = 140.12\n\n    # A representative optimal molar fraction for Ni from literature\n    molar_fraction_Ni = 0.2\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the corresponding molar fraction for Ce\n    molar_fraction_Ce = 1 - molar_fraction_Ni\n\n    print(\"### Catalyst Composition Calculation ###\\n\")\n    print(f\"Based on scientific literature, a representative optimal molar fraction of Ni is {molar_fraction_Ni}.\")\n    print(\"This means in a sample, for every 1 mole of metal atoms:\")\n    print(f\"- Moles of Nickel (Ni): {molar_fraction_Ni}\")\n    print(f\"- Moles of Cerium (Ce): {molar_fraction_Ce:.1f}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the mass of each component based on their molar amounts\n    mass_Ni = molar_fraction_Ni * atomic_mass_Ni\n    mass_Ce = molar_fraction_Ce * atomic_mass_Ce\n\n    print(\"--- Calculating Mass from Moles ---\")\n    print(f\"Equation for Ni mass: {molar_fraction_Ni} mol * {atomic_mass_Ni} g/mol = {mass_Ni:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"Equation for Ce mass: {molar_fraction_Ce:.1f} mol * {atomic_mass_Ce} g/mol = {mass_Ce:.2f} g\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the total mass and the weight percent (wt%) of Ni\n    total_mass = mass_Ni + mass_Ce\n    wt_percent_Ni = (mass_Ni / total_mass) * 100\n\n    print(\"--- Calculating Final Weight Percent (wt%) of Ni ---\")\n    print(f\"Equation for total mass: {mass_Ni:.2f} g (Ni) + {mass_Ce:.2f} g (Ce) = {total_mass:.2f} g\")\n    print(f\"Equation for Ni wt%: ({mass_Ni:.2f} g / {total_mass:.2f} g) * 100 = {wt_percent_Ni:.2f} wt%\\n\")\n\n    print(\"### Conclusion ###\")\n    print(f\"A catalyst with a Ni/(Ni+Ce) molar ratio of {molar_fraction_Ni} corresponds to approximately {wt_percent_Ni:.2f} wt% Ni.\")\n    print(\"The ideal ratio is a range, but this value is a well-regarded benchmark for achieving high catalytic performance due to strong metal-support interaction.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_catalyst_composition()\n    # For the final answer, we refer to the optimal molar fraction range of Ni / (Ni + Ce).\n    # The value is a range because of varying experimental conditions and synthesis methods.\n    sys.stdout.write(\"\\n<<<0.1-0.3>>>\\n\")\n```"
