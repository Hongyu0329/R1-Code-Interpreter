    "This is a biological question, but I can provide a Python script that stores this information and presents it to you. My plan is to create a Python script that simulates a query to a neuroanatomical database. The script will contain the known relationships between brain lobes in a dwarf cuttlefish and will print the answer to your specific question.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function simulates a query to a neuroanatomical database\n    to find brain regions adjacent to a specified lobe in a dwarf cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A simplified database of cephalopod brain anatomy relationships.\n    # The key is the reference lobe, and the value is a dictionary of its neighbors.\n    cuttlefish_brain_db = {\n        'palliovisceral_lobe': {\n            'anterior_to': ['inferior_frontal_lobe_system', 'pedal_lobe'],\n            'posterior_to': ['Posterior basal lobe', 'Magnocellular lobe'],\n            'dorsal_to': ['optic_lobe'],\n            'ventral_to': ['subpedunculate_lobe']\n        }\n        # Other lobes could be added here.\n    }\n\n    # The lobe we are interested in.\n    reference_lobe = 'palliovisceral_lobe'\n    \n    # The spatial relationship we are looking for.\n    relationship = 'posterior_to'\n\n    # Retrieve the adjacent lobes from our simulated database.\n    if reference_lobe in cuttlefish_brain_db and relationship in cuttlefish_brain_db[reference_lobe]:\n        posterior_lobes = cuttlefish_brain_db[reference_lobe][relationship]\n        \n        # Print the results in a clear format.\n        print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the {reference_lobe} are:\")\n        for lobe in posterior_lobes:\n            print(f\"- {lobe}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Information about regions {relationship} the {reference_lobe} could not be found.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer.\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe are the posterior basal lobe and the magnocellular lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
