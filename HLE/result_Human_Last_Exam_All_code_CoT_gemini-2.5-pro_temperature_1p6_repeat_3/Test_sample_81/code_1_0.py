# Answering the user's request by identifying the correct clause.
# Clause E is the most likely answer because it contains a highly specific,
# unexpected, and "hidden" material term.
# The prohibition against researching individuals in Illinois is not something a
# user would reasonably expect, and it's buried in a long list of other rules.
# This aligns with the provided text's description of terms that courts might
# find egregious or in violation of the "doctrine of reasonable expectations."

# Per the instructions, I will also create an equation using the numbers
# found in clause C. Clause C mentions "one and one-half percent" (1.5%) and "10.5%".
