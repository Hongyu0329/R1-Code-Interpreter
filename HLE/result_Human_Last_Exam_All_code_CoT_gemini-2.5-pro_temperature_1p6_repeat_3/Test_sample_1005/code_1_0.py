# Based on the analytical derivation, the integral simplifies to the expression 2**(15/16).
# The final equation is: Integral = 2**(15/16).
# Here are the numbers from this final expression:
base = 2
numerator = 15
denominator = 16

# Calculate the result
value = base**(numerator/denominator)

# Output the numbers in the final expression and the calculated value.
