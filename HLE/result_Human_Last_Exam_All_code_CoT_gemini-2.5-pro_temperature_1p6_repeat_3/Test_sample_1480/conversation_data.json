    "Of course! Here is a plan to calculate the rule activation level.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to find the \"rule activation level\" for a fuzzy rule, given two values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`. The calculation should use a t-norm operation.\n2.  **Understand the Concepts:**\n    *   **Rule Activation Level:** In a fuzzy system, a rule's \"IF\" part is called the antecedent. The activation level (or firing strength) is a measure of how true the antecedent is for the given inputs.\n    *   **t-norm:** A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical \"AND\". It takes two or more membership values (between 0 and 1) and combines them into a single value. The most common t-norm is the **minimum** function (`min(a, b)`). Another common one is the **product** t-norm (`a * b`).\n    *   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Sets (IT3 FS):** While the problem mentions IT3 FS, the provided inputs (`0.7` and `0.9`) are single, crisp numbers. A full IT3 FS calculation would involve complex operations on nested intervals or fuzzy sets. Since we have simple numbers, the problem simplifies to a standard Type-1 fuzzy logic calculation. We will assume the provided values are the relevant membership degrees for the antecedent parts of the rule.\n3.  **Execution:** We will apply the most common t-norm, the minimum function, to the two given values to find the rule activation level.\n4.  **Code Generation:** A Python script will be created to define the values, calculate the minimum, and print the entire process, including the final equation and result.\n\n```python\n# The given values for the membership grades in the rule's antecedent.\n# While the problem mentions an Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set, the inputs provided are\n# crisp numbers, simplifying the calculation to a standard t-norm operation.\nvalue1 = 0.7\nvalue2 = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is a fuzzy logic operator for 'AND'. The most common t-norm is the minimum function.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm to calculate the rule activation level.\nactivation_level = min(value1, value2)\n\nprint(\"To find the rule activation level, we combine the membership values of the antecedent using a t-norm.\")\nprint(\"Using the minimum t-norm (the most common choice):\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({value1}, {value2})\")\nprint(f\"The resulting rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
