print("2. Gary provides Jack with 'written notice of default'.")
print("3. A 3-day grace period begins from the receipt of the notice for Jack to pay.")

print("Jack missed the Feb 1st payment. Gary sent a text on Feb 2nd 'letting him know that he missed a payment.'")
print("The central issue is whether this informal text constitutes a formal 'written notice of default' as required by the contract to start the 3-day clock.")
print("A legal interpretation would likely find that an informal text is not a sufficient notice of default. Therefore, the 3-day cure period was not properly initiated.")
print("As a result, Gary was not yet entitled to retake possession of the vehicle on February 6th.")
