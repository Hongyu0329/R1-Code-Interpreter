    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau link, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** The weights of the ambient space are $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Calabi-Yau Condition:** For a hypersurface defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial to be Calabi-Yau, its weighted degree, $d$, must equal the sum of the weights, $d = \\sum w_i$. Let's calculate the sum of the weights: $22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$. So, the degree $d$ must be 225.\n    (Note: The provided polynomial $f=z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3$ is not perfectly quasi-homogeneous as the term $z_1^4z_2^3z_3$ has a weighted degree of $4(22)+3(29)+1(49) = 224$, while all other terms have a degree of 225. Assuming this is a typo and the entity is indeed a Calabi-Yau link, we will use the required degree $d=225$.)\n\n3.  **Use the Crawley-Nordström Invariant Formula:** The invariant is calculated using the formula $c_N = (\\sum w_i) - 2d$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Result:** I will substitute the sum of weights and the degree into the formula to find the invariant's value. The Python script below will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\n# 1. Define the weights for the ambient space.\nweights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n# 2. Calculate the sum of the weights.\nsum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n# 3. Determine the degree 'd' based on the Calabi-Yau condition.\n# For a Calabi-Yau variety, the degree 'd' must equal the sum of the weights.\nd = sum_of_weights\n\n# 4. Define and calculate the Crawley-Nordstrom invariant.\n# The formula is: c_N = (sum of weights) - 2*d\ncn_invariant = sum_of_weights - 2 * d\n\n# 5. Print the calculation steps and the final result.\nprint(f\"The weights are: {weights}\")\nprint(\"For the link to be Calabi-Yau, the degree 'd' must equal the sum of the weights.\")\nprint(f\"Sum of weights = {' + '.join(map(str, weights))} = {sum_of_weights}\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the degree d = {d}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe Crawley-Nordström invariant (c_N) is calculated as: c_N = (sum of weights) - 2 * d\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\")\n# Final output showing the full equation as requested\nprint(f\"c_N = {sum_of_weights} - 2 * {d}\")\nprint(f\"c_N = {sum_of_weights} - {2 * d}\")\nprint(f\"c_N = {cn_invariant}\")\n```\n<<<-225>>>"
