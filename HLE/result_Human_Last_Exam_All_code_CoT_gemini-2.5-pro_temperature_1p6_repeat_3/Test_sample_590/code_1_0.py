# The problem asks for the number of positive eigenvalues of a stability operator L in L^2.
# This corresponds to finding the number of positive discrete eigenvalues.

# 1. By separating variables, the problem is reduced to analyzing a family of 1D
#    Schrodinger-type operators L_k on the real line, indexed by the spherical
#    harmonic mode k = 0, 1, 2, ...

# 2. The potential term for each operator L_k is given by:
#    V_k(rho) = (n*(n-1) / <rho>^(2n)) - (k*(k+n-2) / <rho>^2)
#    where <rho> = sqrt(rho^2 + 1).

# 3. We determine the start of the essential spectrum by finding the limit of the
#    potential as the variable rho goes to infinity.
#    Equation for the limit: lim_{rho -> infinity} V_k(rho)
#    As rho -> infinity, <rho> -> infinity, so both terms in V_k(rho) approach 0.
limit_of_potential = 0

# 4. According to spectral theory, the essential (continuous) spectrum for L_k starts
#    at the limit of the potential, which is 0. The essential spectrum is [0, infinity).

# 5. Discrete eigenvalues corresponding to L^2-integrable eigenfunctions can only exist
#    below the bottom of the essential spectrum.
#    This means any discrete eigenvalues for L must be less than 0.

# 6. Therefore, there are no positive L^2 eigenvalues.
number_of_positive_eigenvalues = 0

# Final Answer
