def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function explains and provides the solution to the topology problem.

    The problem asks for the largest number of components a set X \ C can have,
    given a specific topological setup.

    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (continuum),
    A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \ A.

    The structure of the components is given by the equation:
    Number of components of (X \ C) = Number of components of (A U (Union of other components of X \ A))

    While for "well-behaved" (e.g., locally connected) spaces the answer is 1,
    the problem allows for more general topological spaces. Using a construction
    known as the "Lakes of Wada", one can define a space X=R^2, a connected set A,
    and a component C of X\A such that X\C has c (cardinality of the continuum)
    connected components.

    Since the cardinality of X itself is c, the number of components cannot exceed c.
    Thus, the largest possible number is c.
    """
    # The cardinality of the continuum, denoted by 'c' or |R|.
    # There is no standard numerical value for it, as it is a transfinite number.
    # We represent it as a string 'c'.
    cardinality_of_the_continuum = "c"

    # There's no equation to solve, the answer is the result of the topological analysis.
    # We present the logic and the final "number".
    print("The question is to find the maximum number of connected components for the set X \\ C.")
    print("Based on topological constructions like the Lakes of Wada, this number can be made as large as the cardinality of the continuum.")
    print("The space X itself has cardinality c, so the number of components cannot exceed this.")
    print(f"Let N be the number of components. The derived equation for the maximum value is:")
    print(f"N = {cardinality_of_the_continuum}")
