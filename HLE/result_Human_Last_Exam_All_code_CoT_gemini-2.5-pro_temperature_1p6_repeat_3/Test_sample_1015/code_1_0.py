    The primary and most fundamental difference between a cambré derrière (a bend of the body backwards) in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods is the placement of the hip.

    In the Vaganova method, which is known for its precise and academic approach, there is a strict emphasis on keeping the hips square and level, facing directly forward. The bend is initiated from the upper back, and the integrity of the squared-off torso and hip alignment is paramount. This creates a pure, controlled backbend.

    In the Balanchine method, which is characterized by its speed, musicality, and neoclassical lines, the dancer is often encouraged to lift the hip of the working leg. This action allows the torso to spiral, which can facilitate a deeper, more dynamic, and visually distinct backbend. This breaking of the classical "square" alignment is a key feature of the Balanchine style.

    While other elements like arm placement, speed, and head position also differ between the styles, the hip placement is the most defining technical distinction for this particular step.
