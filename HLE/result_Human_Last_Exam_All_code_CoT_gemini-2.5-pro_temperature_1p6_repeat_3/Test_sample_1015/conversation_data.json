    "The main task is to identify the key technical difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine cambré derrière from the given options. I will write a Python script that explains the technical nuances of each method concerning this specific ballet step and then identifies the most accurate answer.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Define the question and the multiple-choice options within the script.\n2.  Provide a detailed explanation comparing the Vaganova and Balanchine approaches to cambré derrière.\n3.  The Vaganova method insists on keeping the hips square to the front during the backbend, ensuring the movement originates from the spine.\n4.  The Balanchine method allows the hip of the gesturing leg to lift and open, creating a spiral in the torso, which affects the quality and depth of the bend.\n5.  Based on this key distinction, determine that the 'Placement of hip' is the correct answer.\n6.  The script will print the explanation and then the final answer choice.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the difference between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n    and provides the correct answer from the given choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\n    The primary and most fundamental difference between a cambré derrière (a bend of the body backwards) in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods is the placement of the hip.\n\n    In the Vaganova method, which is known for its precise and academic approach, there is a strict emphasis on keeping the hips square and level, facing directly forward. The bend is initiated from the upper back, and the integrity of the squared-off torso and hip alignment is paramount. This creates a pure, controlled backbend.\n\n    In the Balanchine method, which is characterized by its speed, musicality, and neoclassical lines, the dancer is often encouraged to lift the hip of the working leg. This action allows the torso to spiral, which can facilitate a deeper, more dynamic, and visually distinct backbend. This breaking of the classical \"square\" alignment is a key feature of the Balanchine style.\n\n    While other elements like arm placement, speed, and head position also differ between the styles, the hip placement is the most defining technical distinction for this particular step.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(question)\n    print(\"\\nAnswer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Explanation ---\")\n    # Use textwrap to format the explanation nicely in the terminal\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    \n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is B: {options[correct_answer_key]}\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n\n# Final Answer\nprint(\"<<<B>>>\")\n```"
