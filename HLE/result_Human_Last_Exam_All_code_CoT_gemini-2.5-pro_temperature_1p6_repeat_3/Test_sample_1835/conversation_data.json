    "Based on Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint, the answer is **yes**. The constraint posits that thought is systematic. If you can think \"a is F\" (`Fa`), it implies you have conceptually separated the predicate `F` from the subject `a`. You can then recombine these conceptual components. Since you also understand universal quantification (`∀x`), you possess all the necessary concepts to form the new, general thought \"for all x, x is F\" (`∀x Fx`). The ability to move from applying a predicate to a specific object to applying it to a variable bound by a quantifier is a prime example of the kind of conceptual recombination the Generality Constraint describes.\n\n### Plan for the Code\n\nI will provide a Python script to model this logical transition.\n1.  First, I will define a \"domain of discourse\" (a list of numbers) and a predicate `F` (a function that checks for a property, like being an even number).\n2.  I will model \"understanding `Fa`\" by picking one specific element `a` from the domain and showing that the predicate `F(a)` holds true.\n3.  Next, I will model \"understanding `∀x Fx`\" by iterating through the entire domain and checking if the predicate `F(x)` is true for every single element.\n4.  Finally, I will present the verification of this universal proposition as an equation, as you requested. The equation will compare the count of elements for which `F(x)` is true to the total number of elements in the domain. The universal statement is true if and only if these two numbers are equal. I will print each number in this final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_generality_constraint():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script models the logical step from understanding a specific proposition 'Fa'\n    to understanding a universal proposition 'For all x, F(x)', based on the\n    Generality Constraint.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
