# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of a certain type of topological space.
# Based on the analysis, there are two such classes.

# The first class is the set of all spaces homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1] (an arc).
class_1 = 1

# The second class is the set of all spaces homeomorphic to the circle S^1 (a simple closed curve).
class_2 = 1

# The total number of distinct homeomorphism classes is the sum of these cases.
total_classes = class_1 + class_2

# The equation is 1 + 1 = 2
print("The first class is the arc. The number of classes is", class_1)
print("The second class is the simple closed curve. The number of classes is", class_2)
print("The total number of homeomorphism classes is:")
print(f"{class_1} + {class_2} = {total_classes}")
