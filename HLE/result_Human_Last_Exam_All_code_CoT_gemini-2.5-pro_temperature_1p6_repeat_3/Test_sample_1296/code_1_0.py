        "For example, for m=6, we can choose a=1, b=1. Then gcd(6, 1+1)=2. The number of faces would be |G/N|/k_2' = 6/3 = 2. So D_N is not unicellular."

        "For l > 2, the non-abelian composition factors of quotients of the relevant Delta groups are restricted. "
        "Since T can be any non-abelian simple group, we can always choose a T that is not in the allowed list of composition factors. "
