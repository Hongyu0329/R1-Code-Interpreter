# The problem involves determining the number of isomers formed in a coordination chemistry reaction.
# The analysis is based on the principles of stereoisomerism in binuclear complexes.

# Step 1: Identify the sources of isomerism.
# The product is a dinuclear complex where a symmetric bridging ligand connects two chiral Ru(bpy)2 units.
# Each chiral unit can have a Delta (Δ) or Lambda (Λ) configuration.

# Step 2: List the possible combinations.
# The combinations of chiralities at the two metal centers are (Δ,Δ), (Λ,Λ), and (Δ,Λ).

# Step 3: Count the unique isomers based on these combinations.

# The (Δ,Δ) and (Λ,Λ) forms are mirror images of each other and are chiral.
# This pair constitutes a set of enantiomers.
num_enantiomers = 2

# The (Δ,Λ) form contains opposite chiral centers connected by a symmetric bridge.
# This results in an achiral meso compound.
num_meso = 1

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of isomers.
total_isomers = num_enantiomers + num_meso

# Step 5: Print the final answer with explanation.
