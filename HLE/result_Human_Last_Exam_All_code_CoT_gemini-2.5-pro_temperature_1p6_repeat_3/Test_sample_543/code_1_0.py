# The user wants the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of 
# 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene with excess phenyl magnesium bromide.

# Based on the principles of organometallic chemistry, all three halogen atoms 
# (one iodine and two bromines) will be replaced by phenyl groups.
# The iodine is replaced first, followed by the two bromines.
# This results in a central benzene ring with three adjacent phenyl substituents.

# The numbers corresponding to the substituent positions are 1, 2, and 3.
# The substituent is a phenyl group, and there are three of them (tri-).
# The parent molecule is benzene.

product_name = "1,2,3-triphenylbenzene"

# The following line prints the final IUPAC name, which includes the numbers 1, 2, and 3 as requested.
