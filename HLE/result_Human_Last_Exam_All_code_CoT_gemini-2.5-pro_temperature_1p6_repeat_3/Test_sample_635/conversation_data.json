    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ and $D(s), N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to derive the factorization:\n\n1.  **Initial Factorization**: First, we express all elements of $H(s)$ with a common denominator. The denominators are $(s+1)$ and $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. The least common denominator is $d(s) = s^2-1$.\n    \\[\n    H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{(s-1)(s-1)}{s^2-1} & \\frac{s^2-1}{s^2-1} \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-2s+1 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    This gives a preliminary factorization $H(s) = D_1(s)^{-1}N_1(s)$ with $D_1(s) = (s^2-1)I = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $N_1(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s^2-2s+1 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n2.  **Check for Coprimeness**: A factorization is coprime if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex $s$. For our initial factorization, the determinant of $D_1(s)$ is $(s^2-1)^2$, which has degree 4. The McMillan degree of $H(s)$ can be calculated to be 2. Since $\\text{deg}(\\det(D_1(s)))$ is greater than the McMillan degree, the factorization is not coprime. There are common factors that can be cancelled.\n\n3.  **Derive Conditions for a Coprime Factorization**: We search for a matrix $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is a polynomial matrix and the degree of $\\det(D(s))$ is 2.\n    Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is:\n    \\[\n    N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    For $N(s)$ to be polynomial, the first column entries must be polynomials. This implies that the numerators must be divisible by $s^2-1$. This leads to constraints on the elements of $D(s)$ at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n4.  **Construct D(s) and N(s)**: By finding a low-degree polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that satisfies these constraints and has $\\text{deg}(\\det(D(s))) = 2$, we arrive at a candidate solution. A suitable choice is:\n    \\[\n    D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+2 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    This matrix has a determinant of $-(s+1)(s-1) = -(s^2-1)$, which has the required degree of 2. Now we calculate the corresponding $N(s)$:\n    \\[\n    N(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+2 & s-1 \\\\ s+1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    N_{11} = (s+2)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s+2)(s-1)^2 + 2(s-1)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{(s-1)(s^2+s-2+2)}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s(s-1)(s+1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = s\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    N_{12} = (s+2)(1) + (s-1)(0) = s+2\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    N_{21} = (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 = s-1\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    N_{22} = (s+1)(1) + 0 = s+1\n    \\]\n    So, the resulting numerator matrix is:\n    \\[\n    N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s & s+2 \\\\ s-1 & s+1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n\n5.  **Final Verification**: The factorization is $H(s) = D(s)^{-1}N(s)$ with the matrices found above. They are left coprime because the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all $s$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define and print the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the symbolic variable s\ns = sp.Symbol('s')\n\n# A left coprime factorization of H(s) is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n# The calculated matrices D(s) and N(s) are defined below.\n\n# Denominator matrix D(s)\nD = sp.Matrix([\n    [s + 2, s - 1],\n    [s + 1, 0]\n])\n\n# Numerator matrix N(s)\nN = sp.Matrix([\n    [s,     s + 2],\n    [s - 1, s + 1]\n])\n\n# Print the resulting matrices\nprint(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\nprint(\"\\n\")\nprint(\"D(s) =\")\nsp.pprint(D, use_unicode=True)\nprint(\"\\n\")\nprint(\"N(s) =\")\nsp.pprint(N, use_unicode=True)\n\n# Verification of the factorization (optional)\n# This part calculates D_inv * N to show it equals H(s).\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40)\nprint(\"Verification: Calculating D(s)^-1 * N(s)\")\nprint(\"=\"*40)\n\n# Calculate H(s) from D(s) and N(s)\nH_calculated = sp.simplify(D.inv() * N)\n\nprint(\"H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) =\")\nsp.pprint(H_calculated, use_unicode=True)\n\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[s + 2, s - 1], [s + 1, 0]], N(s) = [[s, s + 2], [s - 1, s + 1]]>>>"
