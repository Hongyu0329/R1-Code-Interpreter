    This function computes the value based on a plausible interpretation of the problem.
    
    The stable commutator length (scl) is formally defined for commutators. The element g_1*h_2
    is not a commutator because its projections to G_1 and G_2 (which are g_1 and h_2) are not
    in the commutator subgroup of G (as their rotation numbers are non-zero).

    The most reasonable interpretation for a non-trivial answer is to use a natural extension
    of the scl formula. In the group G (Thompson's group T), scl is related to the rotation
    number by scl(c) = |rot_0(c)|/2. We extend this to a seminorm s(x) = |rot(x)|/2 for any element x.

    For a free product G_1 * G_2, the scl of a commutator w is given by max(scl(w_G1), scl(w_G2)).
    Applying this structure to our seminorm 's' and element w = g_1*h_2, we get:
    s(w) = max(s(g_1), s(h_2)).
