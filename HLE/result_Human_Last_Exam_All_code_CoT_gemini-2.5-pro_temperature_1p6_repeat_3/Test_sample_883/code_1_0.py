    print("The fact that Rga1 does not behave this way suggests its mechanism is different and not easily reversible by substrate. In the context of multiple-choice questions, this is often classified as 'irreversible' to contrast with 'reversible' competitive inhibitors.\n")

    print("Choice B: Mentions cofactors, but not Al1 or Rga1 directly. Also incorrect about CaCl2.")
    print("Choice C: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators for Zma1. Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site on Zma1. Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.'")
    print("  - Part 1: 'Al1 and Al2 function as allosteric modulators...' - Correct. Al1 is an activator, Al2 is an inhibitor (kcat drops to 150/s).")
    print(f"  - Part 2: 'Al1 and Al2 bind to the same site...' - Let's check experiment 7. kcat with Al1+Al2 is {kcat_al1_al2}/s. This is the same as with Al2 alone ({kcat_al2}/s). This means the activator Al1 had no effect in the presence of the inhibitor Al2. This strongly suggests they compete for the same allosteric site. This statement is a correct and specific deduction from the data.")
    print("  - Part 3: 'Rga1 is an irreversible inhibitor.' - As discussed in Step 3, this is a reasonable conclusion in contrast to the clearly reversible inhibitor XAG1.")
    print("Choice D: 'XAG1 and Rga1 are irreversible inhibitors...' - Incorrect. XAG1 is reversible.")
    print("Choice H: '...Rga1 is a reversible inhibitor...' - Plausible, but this choice is less specific about the Al1/Al2 interaction than Choice C.\n")

    print("Conclusion: Choice C provides the most accurate and detailed description of the experimental results. It correctly identifies Al1 and Al2 as allosteric modulators, correctly infers from the data that they bind to the same site, and makes the most likely classification of Rga1 as an irreversible inhibitor in this context.")
