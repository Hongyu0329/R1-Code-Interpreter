    "Answering this question requires us to test finite groups to see if they possess a specific property. The property is the existence of a subset of size 2, let's call it `S = {a, b}`, which is:\n1.  **Product-Free**: The product of any two elements in `S` (including an element with itself) is not an element of `S`. So, `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b` must all be outside of `S`.\n2.  **Maximal by Inclusion**: If you add any other element `g` from the group `G` to the set `S`, the new set `S' = S ∪ {g}` is *no longer* product-free.\n\nMy plan is to implement a Python script to perform this check.\n1.  Define a set of common finite groups of small order. For each group, I'll define its elements and its multiplication (Cayley) table. The groups I will check are the cyclic groups `Z₂` through `Z₆`, the Klein four-group `Z₂×Z₂`, the dihedral group of order 8 (`D₈`), and the quaternion group (`Q₈`). This set of groups is sufficient to find the answer.\n2.  Create a function `has_maximal_pf_set_of_size_2(group)` that takes a group definition as input.\n3.  Inside this function, I will iterate through all possible subsets of size 2 from the group's elements.\n4.  For each subset, I will first test if it is product-free.\n5.  If it is product-free, I will then test if it is maximal by checking that adding any other element makes the set \"not product-free\".\n6.  If a group is found to have such a set, we count it.\n7.  The script will then print the total count of such groups found.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef define_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Defines a list of common finite groups of small order.\n    Each group is represented as a dictionary with its name, a list of its elements\n    (represented by integers 0 to n-1), and its multiplication table.\n    \"\"\"\n    groups = []\n\n    # Cyclic groups Z_n (additive group modulo n) for n from 2 to 6\n    for n in range(2, 7):\n        group = {'name': f'Z_{n}', 'elements': list(range(n))}\n        mul_table = {}\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                mul_table[(i, j)] = (i + j) % n\n        group['mul_table'] = mul_table\n        groups.append(group)\n        \n    # Z_2 x Z_2 (Klein four-group, V4)\n    v4 = {'name': 'Z_2xZ_2', 'elements': list(range(4))}\n    v4['mul_table'] = {\n        (0,0):0, (0,1):1, (0,2):2, (0,3):3,\n        (1,0):1, (1,1):0, (1,2):3, (1,3):2,\n        (2,0):2, (2,1):3, (2,2):0, (2,3):1,\n        (3,0):3, (3,1):2, (3,2):1, (3,3):0\n    }\n    groups.append(v4)\n    \n    # Dihedral group D_8 (symmetries of a square)\n    # Generated by r (rotation) and s (reflection) such that r^4=s^2=e, sr=r^3s\n    # Elements map: r^i s^j -> 4*j + i\n    # e=0, r=1, r^2=2, r^3=3, s=4, rs=5, r^2s=6, r^3s=7\n    d8 = {'name': 'D_8', 'elements': list(range(8))}\n    d8_mul_table = {}\n    for i1 in range(4):\n        for j1 in range(2):\n            for i2 in range(4):\n                for j2 in range(2):\n                    e1_idx = 4 * j1 + i1\n                    e2_idx = 4 * j2 + i2\n                    if j1 == 0:\n                        res_i = (i1 + i2) % 4\n                        res_j = (j1 + j2) % 2\n                    else: # j1 == 1\n                        res_i = (i1 - i2) % 4\n                        res_j = (j1 + j2) % 2\n                    res_idx = 4 * res_j + res_i\n                    d8_mul_table[(e1_idx, e2_idx)] = res_idx\n    d8['mul_table'] = d8_mul_table\n    groups.append(d8)\n\n    # Quaternion group Q_8\n    # Elements map: 1=0, -1=1, i=2, -i=3, j=4, -j=5, k=6, -k=7\n    q8 = {'name': 'Q_8', 'elements': list(range(8))}\n    q8_table = [\n        [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6], [2,3,1,0,6,7,5,4], [3,2,0,1,7,6,4,5],\n        [4,5,7,6,1,0,2,3], [5,4,6,7,0,1,3,2], [6,7,4,5,3,2,1,0], [7,6,5,4,2,3,0,1]\n    ]\n    q8_mul_table = {}\n    for r in range(8):\n        for c in range(8):\n            q8_mul_table[(r, c)] = q8_table[r][c]\n    q8['mul_table'] = q8_mul_table\n    groups.append(q8)\n    \n    return groups\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(group_def):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a given group has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\"\"\"\n    elements = group_def['elements']\n    mul_table = group_def['mul_table']\n    \n    # Iterate over all subsets of size 2\n    for s_tuple in itertools.combinations(elements, 2):\n        s_set = set(s_tuple)\n\n        # 1.
