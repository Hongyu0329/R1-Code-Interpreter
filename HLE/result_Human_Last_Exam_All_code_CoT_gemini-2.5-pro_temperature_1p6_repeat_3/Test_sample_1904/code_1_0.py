# The task is to find the smallest possible number of connected components of CL(X),
# where X is an infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space.

# Step 1: Relate connected components to diameters of sets.
# A key theorem in the study of ultrametric spaces states that the number of
# connected components of CL(X) under the Wijsman topology is equal to the
# cardinality of the set of all possible diameter values of non-empty closed
# subsets of X.
# Let D(X) = {diam(A) | A is a non-empty closed subset of X}.
# We want to find an X that minimizes the size of D(X), i.e., |D(X)|.

# Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the number of components.
# Let's find the minimum possible size for the set D(X).
# - Consider a singleton set A = {x}. A is always closed. The diameter is
#   diam(A) = 0. So, 0 must be in D(X).
diam_of_singleton = 0
# - Since X is an infinite space, it contains at least two distinct points, x and y.
#   The set A = {x, y} is also a closed set. Its diameter is diam(A) = d(x, y).
#   Since x is not equal to y, d(x, y) > 0.
#   So, D(X) must contain at least one positive value.
#
# Combining these, D(X) must contain at least two distinct values: 0 and some r > 0.
# Therefore, the minimum number of connected components must be at least 2.
lower_bound = 2

# Step 3: Construct a space X that achieves this minimum of 2.
# We need an infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space X where the only
# possible diameters of closed sets are 0 and one other value, say 1.
# Let's consider X to be any infinite set (e.g., the natural numbers) equipped
# with the discrete metric:
#   d(x, x) = 0
#   d(x, y) = 1, if x != y
# This space is indeed an infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space.

# Step 4: Calculate the possible diameters for this space.
# In a space with the discrete metric, every subset is a closed set.
# Let A be a non-empty closed subset of X.
# - If A has exactly one element (it's a singleton), its diameter is 0.
# - If A has more than one element, let x and y be two distinct points in A.
#   Then d(x, y) = 1. For any two points a, b in A, d(a, b) is either 0 or 1.
#   The supremum of these distances, diam(A), is 1.
#
# Thus, the set of all possible diameters D(X) for this space is {0, 1}.
possible_diameters = {0, 1}
num_possible_diameters = len(possible_diameters)

# Step 5: Conclude the result.
# The number of connected components equals the number of possible diameters.
smallest_num_components = num_possible_diameters
