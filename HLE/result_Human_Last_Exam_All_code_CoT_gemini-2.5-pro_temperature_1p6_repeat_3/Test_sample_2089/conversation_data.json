    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nThe question asks to identify a specific Oscar-nominated film based on a key scene. This is a knowledge-based task. My plan is to:\n1.  Access my knowledge base of films to identify the movie that contains the described scene.\n2.  The scene involves a character saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus, which seals their fate.\n3.  The film must be Oscar-nominated.\n4.  The film that matches these criteria is \"Babel\" (2006). In the film, a young Moroccan boy named Yussef, trying to flee after an accidental shooting, says \"Shukran\" (Thank you) to a police officer at a bus station. This polite but nervous gesture attracts the officer's suspicion, leading to the boy's capture.\n5.  I will then write a Python script that simply prints out the name of this film, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to identify a film based on a specific scene.\n# This script will print the title of that film.\n\n# The film is \"Babel\" (2006), which was nominated for seven Academy Awards.\n# In the film, a young character's fate is sealed when he nervously says\n# \"Thank you\" (\"Shukran\") to a police officer while boarding a bus,\n# which draws unwanted attention to him.\n\nfilm_title = \"Babel\"\nprint(f\"The Oscar-nominated film where a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' while boarding a bus is: {film_title}\")\n\n```\n<<<Babel>>>"
