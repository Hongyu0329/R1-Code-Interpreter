    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a specific region within a one-dimensional box. This probability is determined by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that region.\n\n**1. The Wavefunction and Probability Density**\n\nFor a particle in a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wavefunction for the n-th quantum state is:\n`ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n\nThe probability density, which describes the likelihood of finding the particle at a specific position `x`, is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n`P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`\n\n**2. Calculating the Probability**\n\nTo find the probability of the particle being in the interval from `x1` to `x2`, we integrate the probability density function over this interval:\n`Probability = ∫ [from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx`\n\n**3. Applying the Specific Values**\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n*   Quantum state: `n = 2`\n*   Interval start: `x1 = 0.495a`\n*   Interval end: `x2 = 0.505a`\n\nSubstituting these values, the integral becomes:\n`Probability = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\nWe can solve this integral numerically. It's often simpler to perform a change of variables, letting `x' = x/a`. Then `dx = a dx'`, and the integration limits become `0.495` to `0.505`. The `a` terms cancel out, simplifying the integral to:\n`Probability = ∫ [from 0.495 to 0.505] 2 * sin²(2πx') dx'`\n\nThe following Python code uses the `scipy` library to compute this definite integral.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define the constants for the problem\nn = 2\nx1_rel = 0.495  # The start of the interval relative to the box length 'a'\nx2_rel = 0.505  # The end of the interval relative to the box length 'a'\n\n# The probability is found by integrating the probability density |ψ_n(x)|²\n# from x1 to x2.\n# |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a)\n# We can set a=1 and integrate x from 0.495 to 0.505, as the 'a' cancels out.\n# So we integrate 2 * sin²(n*π*x) dx from x1_rel to x2_rel.\n\ndef probability_density_integrand(x, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This is the function to be integrated: 2 * sin²(n*π*x).\n    It represents the probability density for a box of length a=1.\n    \"\"\"\n    return 2 * (np.sin(n * np.pi * x))**2\n\n# Perform the numerical integration using scipy.integrate.quad\n# The quad function returns the result of the integral and an estimate of the error.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density_integrand, x1_rel, x2_rel, args=(n,))\n\n# --- Output ---\nprint(\"The probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a given interval is calculated by the integral:\")\nprint(\"P = ∫ [from x1 to x2] (2/a) * sin²(n*π*x/a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nBy substituting x' = x/a, the integral simplifies to:\")\nprint(\"P = ∫ [from x1/a to x2/a] 2 * sin²(n*π*x') dx'\")\nprint(\"\\nFor this problem, the final equation with the given values is:\")\nprint(f\"P = ∫ [from {x1_rel} to {x2_rel}] 2 * sin²({n}*π*x') dx'\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the value of this integral gives the probability.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe probability is: {probability}\")\n<<<6.579736852328135e-06>>>"
