    "To determine the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to find the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Analyze the constraints**: The length of the permutation, n=333, is very large, making brute-force enumeration impossible. However, the number of inversions, k=3, is very small. This suggests that any such permutation is only a slight modification of the identity permutation `(1, 2, ..., n)`.\n2.  **Classify permutations with 3 inversions**: I will classify all permutations with exactly 3 inversions based on how they differ from the identity permutation. These differences can be characterized by small \"active\" blocks of elements that are not in their natural order. There are five such disjoint classes of permutations.\n3.  **Check for 1324-avoidance**: For each of the five classes, I will analyze whether permutations of that type contain the `1324` pattern. For some classes, the pattern is almost always present, except for specific cases at the beginning or end of the permutation. For other classes, the structure guarantees that they are `1324`-avoiding. This can be shown by decomposing them as a direct sum of smaller, known `1324`-avoiding permutations.\n4.  **Count the avoiding permutations**: I will derive combinatorial formulas for the number of `1324`-avoiding permutations in each class for a general length `n`.\n5.  **Calculate the final number**: Finally, I will substitute `n = 333` into these formulas, sum up the counts from all five disjoint classes, and present the final calculation in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_av_333_3_1324():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions.\n    The method is to classify all permutations with 3 inversions, check each class\n    for the 1324-avoidance property, count the valid permutations in each class,\n    and sum the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 333\n    k = 3\n\n    print(f\"To find av_{n}^{k}(1324), we count the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length {n} with {k} inversions.\")\n    print(\"We classify permutations with 3 inversions into five disjoint types and count the number of avoiding permutations in each type.\")\n    \n    # Type 1: A single block of 3 elements permuted as 'cba'.\n    # For example, (..., 3, 2, 1, ...).\n    # These contain the 1324 pattern unless they are at the very beginning or end of the permutation.\n    # The avoiding permutations correspond to i=1 and i=n-2.\n    # e.g., for i=1: (3,2,1,4,5,...,n) is 132-avoiding and thus 1324-avoiding.\n    # e.g., for i=n-2: (1,...,n-3,n,n-1,n-2) is a skew-sum of avoider and thus 1324-avoiding.\n    count1 = 2\n    print(f\"\\nType 1 ('cba' pattern): Found {count1} avoiding permutations.\")\n\n    # Type 2: A single block of 4 elements permuted as 'dabc'.\n    # For example, (..., 4, 1, 2, 3, ...).\n    # Similar to Type 1, these generally contain 1324 except at the boundaries i=1 and i=n-3.\n    count2 = 2\n    print(f\"Type 2 ('dabc' pattern): Found {count2} avoiding permutations.\")\n\n    # Type 3: Two disjoint blocks, 'cab' (2 inversions) and 'ba' (1 inversion).\n    # For example, (..., 3, 1, 2, ..., 5, 4, ...).\n    # These permutations are decomposable as a direct sum of 1324-avoiding permutations,\n    # so they are all 1324-avoiding.\n    # We need to choose the starting position 'i' of the 3-element block and 'j' of the 2-element block.\n    # Constraints: 1 <= i and i + 2 < j and j <= n-1.\n    # The number of ways is Sum_{i=1}^{n-4} (n-1 - (i+3) + 1) = Sum_{i=1}^{n-4} (n-i-3).\n    # This sum equals (n-4)*(n-3)/2.\n    count3 = (n - 4) * (n - 3) // 2\n    print(f\"Type 3 ('cab' + 'ba'): Found (n-4)*(n-3)/2 = ({n-4})*({n-3})/2 = {count3} avoiding permutations.\")\n\n    # Type 4: Two disjoint blocks, 'bca' (2 inversions) and 'ba' (1 inversion).\n    # For example, (..., 2, 3, 1, ..., 5, 4, ...).\n    # Like Type 3, these are all 1324-avoiding.\n    # The count is the same as for Type 3.\n    count4 = (n - 4) * (n - 3) // 2\n    print(f\"Type 4 ('bca' + 'ba'): Found (n-4)*(n-3)/2 = ({n-4})*({n-3})/2 = {count4} avoiding permutations.\")\n\n    # Type 5: Three disjoint 'ba' blocks (1 inversion each).\n    # For example, (..., 2, 1, ..., 4, 3, ..., 6, 5, ...).\n    # These are also decomposable and thus all 1324-avoiding.\n    # We need to choose 3 disjoint pairs of adjacent positions to swap.\n    # This is equivalent to choosing 3 indices i,j,k from {1, ..., n-1} such that i+1<j and j+1<k.\n    # This corresponds to choosing 3 numbers from {1, ..., n-3}.\n    # The count is C(n-3, 3).\n    count5 = math.comb(n - 3, 3)\n    print(f\"Type 5 ('ba' + 'ba' + 'ba'): Found C(n-3, 3) = C({n-3}, 3) = {count5} avoiding permutations.\")\n\n    # The five types are disjoint based on the number of non-fixed points in the permutations.\n    # Total count is the sum of the counts from each type.\n    total_count = count1 + count2 + count3 + count4 + count5\n\n    print(\"\\nSince these five types are disjoint, the total number is their sum:\")\n    print(f\"{count1} + {count2} + {count3} + {count4} + {count5} = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_av_333_3_1324()\n<<<6043734>>>\n```"
