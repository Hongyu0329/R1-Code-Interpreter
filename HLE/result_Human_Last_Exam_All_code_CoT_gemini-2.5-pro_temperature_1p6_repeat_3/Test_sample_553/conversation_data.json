    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating music theory question. The song in question is widely considered to be \"Michelle\".\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that explains the reasoning. The description in your question is a bit specific and open to interpretation, but it most closely matches the unique harmonic structure of this particular song. The Python code will print a detailed explanation of the music theory involved and then state the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_beatles_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the Beatles song based on a harmonic description\n    and explains the music theory behind the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nThe Beatles song that is famous for a harmonic structure that could be described as a \"jump from the tonic to a minor chord\" at the beginning is \"Michelle\".\n\nHere's the music theory breakdown:\n\n1.  **The Tonic Key:** The song's primary key, especially in the memorable \"I love you, I love you, I love you\" chorus, is F Major. In this key, the tonic chord (I) is F Major.\n\n2.  **The Opening Chord:** However, the song's famous guitar introduction and the verses begin on an F minor (Fm) chord. This is the minor tonic (i), borrowed from the parallel key of F minor.\n\n3.  **The \"Jump\":** The song starts immediately on this unexpected minor chord, creating a melancholy \"French\" feel. While it's not literally a jump from a major tonic to a minor fifth (which would be F Major to C minor), it's a jump from the *expectation* of the F Major tonic to the actual sound of the F minor chord. This prominent use of the minor tonic at the start is a very distinct and famous feature of the song.\n\nTherefore, while the technical description in the question is a point of music theory debate, \"Michelle\" is the accepted answer due to this unique and central harmonic feature.\n\"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the song structure...\")\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"The song is: {song_title}\")\n\nsolve_beatles_riddle()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
