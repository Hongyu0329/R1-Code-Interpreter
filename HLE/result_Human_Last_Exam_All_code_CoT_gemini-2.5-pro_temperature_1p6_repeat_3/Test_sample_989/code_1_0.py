    print("Statement A: 'Mathematically, you cannot have a valid SVM solution using support vectors from only one class'")
    print("Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: In the dual formulation of SVM, a key Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is `sum(alpha_i * y_i) = 0`, where `alpha_i > 0` for support vectors and `y_i` is the class label (+1 or -1). If all support vectors were from a single class (e.g., all `y_i = +1`), the sum `sum(alpha_i * 1)` would be strictly positive, violating the condition. Thus, support vectors must come from both classes.\n")

    print("Statement B: 'With imbalanced or asymmetric data, having unequal margins can be optimal for SVM'")
    print("Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: Standard SVMs can be biased by imbalanced data. To counteract this, weighted or cost-sensitive SVMs are used. They apply different misclassification penalties (`C_positive` vs. `C_negative`) to each class. This leads to an optimal solution where the margin for one class is different from the other, improving classification on the minority class.\n")

    print("Statement C: 'Effective mapping to an infinite-dimensional space is computationally tractable for some kernels'")
    print("Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: This is the main benefit of the 'kernel trick'. For kernels like the Radial Basis Function (RBF), `K(x, z) = exp(-gamma * ||x-z||^2)`, the corresponding feature space `phi(x)` is infinite-dimensional. However, we never compute `phi(x)`; we only compute the scalar value `K(x, z)`, which is computationally efficient.\n")

    print("Statement D: 'It is possible to add or move data points and not affect the decision boundary at all, as long as they're interior points'")
    print("Analysis: This statement is TRUE.")
    print("Reasoning: The SVM decision boundary is determined exclusively by the support vectors. Interior points are those correctly classified and lying strictly outside the margin. Their corresponding Lagrange multipliers (`alpha_i`) are zero, so they do not influence the position of the hyperplane. Moving them (while keeping them as interior points) has no effect on the solution.\n")

    print("Statement E: 'Any strictly convex function has a unique global minimizer'")
    print("Analysis: This statement is FALSE.")
    print("Reasoning: This is an incorrect mathematical statement. A strictly convex function can have at most one minimizer, but its existence is not guaranteed. A famous counterexample is the exponential function.")
    print("   Counterexample Equation: f(x) = e^x")
    print("   The function's domain is all real numbers. It is strictly convex because its second derivative, `e^x`, is always positive.")
    print("   However, it never reaches a minimum value. Its value approaches 0 as x approaches negative infinity, but it never equals 0. The function's greatest lower bound (infimum) is 0, but it does not have a minimizer.")
    x_val = -1000
    y_val = np.exp(x_val)
    print(f"   For a large negative number like x = {x_val}, the function value f({x_val}) is {y_val}, which is extremely close to 0 but not 0.")
    print("   Since the function never attains a minimum, the statement is false.\n")
