# The question is about a specific and famous ballet performance.
# Kitri's Act I variation in Don Quixote contains a signature sequence of fast turns.
# This choreographic phrase can be thought of as two sets of turns.

# Number of turns in the first phrase of the sequence.
first_phrase_turns = 4

# Number of turns in the second phrase of the sequence.
second_phrase_turns = 4

# The total number of turns is the sum of these two phrases.
total_turns = first_phrase_turns + second_phrase_turns

# Display the calculation.
print(f"The number of turns in the signature sequence is calculated as:")
print(f"{first_phrase_turns} + {second_phrase_turns} = {total_turns}")
