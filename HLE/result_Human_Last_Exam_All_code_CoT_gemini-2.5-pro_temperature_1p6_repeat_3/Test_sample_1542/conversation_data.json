    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA quadratic form in two variables over $R$ is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. This change of variables is represented by a matrix $P \\in GL(2, R)$, the group of invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $R$. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n\nThe problem, therefore, is to count the number of orbits of the set of all quadratic forms under the action of the group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will write a Python script to systematically find all the equivalence classes.\n2.  The script will first generate the group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$ by finding all $2 \\times 2$ matrices with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is one of $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  Next, it will generate all $8^3 = 512$ possible quadratic forms, each represented by a tuple of its coefficients $(a, b, c)$.\n4.  It will then iterate through each form. For each form not yet classified, it will compute its entire orbit, which is the set of all forms that can be reached from it via the transformations in $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n5.  All forms in this newly found orbit will be marked as 'seen' or 'classified'.\n6.  For each orbit, a single canonical representative will be chosen. A simple choice for the canonical representative is the form corresponding to the lexicographically smallest coefficient tuple $(a, b, c)$ in the orbit.\n7.  The total number of such canonical representatives will be the number of equivalence classes. The script will print these representatives and the final count.\n\nThis brute-force computational approach is feasible and guarantees a correct classification.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring R = Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The group GL(2, Z/8Z) consists of 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z\n    # with a determinant that is a unit in Z/8Z ({1, 3, 5, 7}).\n    gl2_z8 = []\n    units = {1, 3, 5, 7}\n    for p in range(8):\n        for q in range(8):\n            for r in range(8):\n                for s in range(8):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % 8\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_z8.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Generate all 8^3 = 512 possible quadratic forms ax^2 + bxy + cy^2.\n    all_forms = []\n    for a in range(8):\n        for b in range(8):\n            for c in range(8):\n                all_forms.append((a, b, c))\n\n    # Use a set to keep track of forms whose orbit we have already computed.\n    seen_forms = set()\n    # A list to store the canonical representative of each equivalence class.\n    representatives = []\n\n    for form in all_forms:\n        if form in seen_forms:\n            continue\n\n        # This is a new equivalence class.
