    "This task requires identifying a Crayola crayon color based on a chemical ingredient. The plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the chemical**: The provided chemical name, 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride, is the scientific name for a common dye.\n2.  **Find the common name**: A lookup reveals the common name for this chemical is Rhodamine B.\n3.  **Identify its use**: Rhodamine B is a fluorescent dye with a vivid reddish-pink or magenta color.\n4.  **Connect to Crayola**: Research shows that Crayola uses Rhodamine B as a pigment in several of its fluorescent or neon crayons. A well-documented example is the color \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\".\n5.  **Create a script**: I will write a Python script that simulates this lookup process. It will use a predefined dictionary to act as a knowledge base, mapping the chemical name to the corresponding crayon color and printing the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color_by_chemical():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies a Crayola crayon color based on a chemical ingredient\n    by looking it up in a simulated knowledge base.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name from the query.
