    "In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film *Solaris*, the protagonist Kris Kelvin is the character most deeply affected by homesickness and his disconnection from Earth. He has a conversation where he laments humanity's state and expresses shame for having lost the simple, sensory connections to their home world, such as the sound of rustling leaves. This feeling is a central theme tied to his character.\n\nThe following Python code will identify and explain the correct character.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the answer to the Solaris trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    correct_option = 'A'\n    correct_character = choices[correct_option]\n\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The correct character is {correct_character}.\\n\"\n        f\"In the film, the protagonist Kris Kelvin expresses a deep sense of loss and shame for being disconnected from Earth.\\n\"\n        \"He specifically reflects on missing simple terrestrial experiences, symbolizing his profound homesickness and the psychological \"\n        \"burden of his mission in the sterile environment of the space station.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_solaris_riddle()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
