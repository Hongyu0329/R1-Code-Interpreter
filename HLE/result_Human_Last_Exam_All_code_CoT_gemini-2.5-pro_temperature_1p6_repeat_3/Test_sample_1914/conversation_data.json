    "To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the basic constraints**: A category with 2 objects, let's call them A and B, must contain two identity morphisms, `id_A` and `id_B`. Since the total number of morphisms is 4, there are 2 additional non-identity morphisms.\n\n2.  **Classify by morphism distribution**: The two non-identity morphisms can be distributed among the four possible Hom-sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`. The distribution can be represented by a tuple `(n_AA, n_AB, n_BA, n_BB)` where `n_XY` is the total number of morphisms from object X to object Y. The sum of these numbers must be 4, and `n_AA >= 1`, `n_BB >= 1`.\n\n3.  **Handle isomorphisms of distributions**: A category C is isomorphic to a category C' if there is a functor F: C -> C' that is a bijection on objects and morphisms. For the distributions, swapping the objects A and B leads to an isomorphic category. This means a distribution `(a, b, c, d)` is in the same class as `(d, c, b, a)`. I will identify the unique classes of distributions.\n\n4.  **Analyze each class**: For each unique distribution class, I will determine the number of non-isomorphic ways to define the composition operation that satisfy the category axioms (associativity and identity).\n\n5.  **Sum the results**: The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each distinct class of distributions.\n\nThe following Python code will programmatically walk through this analysis, explaining each case and calculating the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the number of non-isomorphic categories\n    with 2 objects and 4 morphisms by analyzing each possible distribution\n    of morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Analyzing non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\\n\")\n    print(\"Let the objects be A and B.
