    "To solve this problem, I will analyze each ballet step to determine if it ends with the same leg configuration (i.e., which foot is in front) as it began. I will use a Python script to formalize this analysis.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will create a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents one of the ballet steps from the answer choices.\n2.  Each dictionary will contain the step's name and a 'property' describing whether the step changes the feet, keeps them the same, or can do either.\n3.  The properties will be determined based on the definitions in classical ballet technique:\n    *   **Entrechat six**: In the classical definition, all even-numbered entrechats (like two, quatre, six) land in fifth position with the *same* foot in front as they started. Therefore, its property is 'Always Same'.\n    *   **Échappé battu changé**: The word `changé` in the name explicitly means 'changed'. The feet are swapped. Its property is 'Always Changes'.\n    *   **Assemblé**: This is a category of steps. Some common variations like *assemblé dessus* and *dessous* change the feet, while others like *assemblé devant* and *derrière* do not. Because it can be performed either way, its property is 'Variable'.\n    *   **Glissade derrière**: This step involves a glide. Depending on the school of training and the direction of travel, it can be performed either with or without changing the feet. Its property is 'Variable'.\n    *   **Gargouillade**: This is a complex, decorative jump, which is a variation of a *pas de chat* and results in the feet changing position. Its property is 'Always Changes'.\n4.  The script will then iterate through the list and identify the single step that is defined as 'Always Same'.\n\n```python\ndef find_non_changing_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find the one that starts and ends\n    with the same foot in the front position.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"A\",\n            \"name\": \"Entrechat six\",\n            \"property\": \"Always Same\",\n            \"reason\": \"By definition, even-numbered entrechats (deux, quatre, six) start and end in fifth position with the same foot in front.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"B\",\n            \"name\": \"Échappé battu changé\",\n            \"property\": \"Always Changes\",\n            \"reason\": \"The term 'changé' explicitly means 'changed', so the feet are switched at the end.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"C\",\n            \"name\": \"Assemblé\",\n            \"property\": \"Variable\",\n            \"reason\": \"This step can be performed 'changé' (e.g., assemblé dessus) or 'sans changer' (e.g., assemblé devant).
