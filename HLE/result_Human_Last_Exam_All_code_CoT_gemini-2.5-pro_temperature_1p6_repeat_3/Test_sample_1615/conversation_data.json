    "This problem asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Recall the definition of the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$:** It's the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n2.  **Recall the basic upper bound for the chromatic number:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n3.  **Identify the condition for the maximum chromatic number:** The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex. This is the definition of a complete graph, $K_n$.\n4.  **Apply the problem's constraint:** The problem explicitly states that the graph $G$ is **not** a complete graph. Therefore, we can conclude that its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices, so $\\chi(G) < n$, which means $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n5.  **Verify if this maximum is achievable:** We need to check if there exists a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices that is not complete and has a chromatic number of $n-1 = 12344$.\n    *   Consider the graph formed by taking a complete graph on $12344$ vertices ($K_{12344}$) and adding one more vertex that is completely disconnected from all other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   This graph has $12345$ vertices in total.\n    *   It is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to any other vertex.\n    *   The $K_{12344}$ subgraph requires $12344$ different colors. The isolated vertex can be given any of these colors.\n    *   Thus, the chromatic number for this graph is exactly $12344$.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since the chromatic number for a non-complete graph with $n$ vertices cannot exceed $n-1$, and we have found an example that achieves this bound, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** For $n=12345$, the result is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nNow, let's write a simple Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring of a\n    graph with n vertices, given that the graph is not complete.\n\n    The chromatic number chi(G) of a graph G with n vertices is n if and only if\n    G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be\n    less than n. The maximum possible value is n-1.\n\n    This can be achieved by a graph consisting of a complete subgraph on n-1\n    vertices (a K_{n-1} clique) and one additional isolated vertex. Such a\n    graph has n vertices, is not complete, and its chromatic number is n-1.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_vertices = 12345\n    max_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n    print(f\"Let n be the number of vertices, n = {num_vertices}.\")\n    print(\"The graph is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
