    "My thinking process to solve this riddle is as follows:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:** I'll break down the user's prompt into key pieces of information:\n    *   **Author:** The quote is from Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This immediately points to a Russian or Soviet figure.\n    *   **Description:** \"a joy-discovering sailor\". This is a very poetic phrase, suggesting an explorer or someone associated with voyages and new discoveries.\n    *   **Mystery:** \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" This indicates the person's burial site was lost or unknown for a significant period.\n    *   **Timeline:** The location of the grave was discovered in the \"late 1980s\". This is a critical and concrete fact for verification.\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Research:** I'll combine these clues to form a hypothesis. The subject is a Russian explorer whose grave was lost and then found in the late 1980s, and who was the subject of a poem by Voznesensky.\n    *   My primary candidate is Nikolai Rezanov (1764-1807). He was a key figure in the Russian-American Company and a Russian diplomat.\n    *   **Connection to Voznesensky:** Rezanov is the central character of Voznesensky's most famous work, the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\". The libretto (the text) of the opera is a collection of Voznesensky's poems.\n    *   **The Grave:** Rezanov died and was buried in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on his way back to St. Petersburg. His grave at the Voskresensky Cathedral was destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, a campaign, which Voznesensky supported, led to the rediscovery of the approximate location and the erection of a new monument. This perfectly matches the timeline.\n    *   **The Quote:** The description \"joy-discovering sailor\" and the query about his grave are from Voznesensky's poems dedicated to Rezanov.\n\n3.  **Formulate the Code:** The request requires a Python script. Since this is a knowledge-based question, the script will serve to document the logic and print the final answer clearly, as per the user's instructions. The script will define the person's name based on the reasoning and then print the required last name.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes a historical figure based on clues from a poem by Andrei Voznesensky.\n#\n# Clue 1: The poet is Andrei Voznesensky.\n# Clue 2: The person is called \"a joy-discovering sailor\".\n# Clue 3: His grave was lost and its location was rediscovered in the late 1980s.\n#\n# These clues point to Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov (1764â€“1807).\n# - Voznesensky's famous rock opera, \"Juno and Avos\", is about Rezanov.\n# - Rezanov was a Russian explorer and diplomat.\n# - His grave in Krasnoyarsk was destroyed during the Soviet era. A memorial was re-established\n#   on the site in the late 20th century after a public campaign that Voznesensky was part of.\n\n# Storing the identified person's name in variables.\nfirst_name = \"Nikolai\"\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\n# Printing the identified last name as the answer.\nprint(f\"The last name of the man described is:\")\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
