    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, understand the properties of a graph $\\gamma$ that has an automorphism group `Aut(Î³)` of size 3. The group must be the cyclic group of order 3, `Z_3`. This implies the graph must have a 3-fold rotational symmetry but must lack any reflectional (mirror) symmetry. Such a graph is called a *chiral* graph.\n2.  I will attempt to construct such a graph with a small number of edges. Simple, highly symmetric graphs like complete graphs or cycles will not work as their automorphism groups are too large. For example, the 3-cycle (`K_3`) has an automorphism group of size 6 (`D_3`).\n3.  A common technique is to build a graph from smaller components in a way that creates the desired rotational symmetry while breaking the reflectional ones. I will construct a graph made of two 3-cycles, connected in a \"twisted\" manner, which is a good candidate for having `Z_3` symmetry.\n4.  I will write a Python script using the `networkx` library to build this candidate graph and compute the actual size of its automorphism group.\n5.  The script will demonstrate that even with the \"twist,\" the constructed graph still possesses reflectional symmetry, leading to an automorphism group of size 6 (`D_3`), not 3. This highlights the difficulty of the problem.\n6.  Finally, since constructing the true minimal graph from first principles is a complex problem solved in mathematical literature, I will state the established answer. The code's purpose is to demonstrate the principles and the failure of simple attempts, justifying the need for a more complex graph with more edges.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef get_automorphism_group_size(graph):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of automorphisms for a given graph.\n    It uses the NetworkX isomorphism module, which finds all mappings\n    of the graph onto itself that preserve adjacency.\n    \"\"\"\n    # An isomorphism from a graph to itself is an automorphism.\n    matcher = nx.isomorphism.GraphMatcher(graph, graph)\n    count = 0\n    for _ in matcher.isomorphisms_iter():\n        count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Step 1: Attempt to construct a simple graph with the desired symmetry.\n# A natural approach for 3-fold symmetry is to use 3-cycles as building blocks.\n# Let's take two 3-cycles and connect them.\nconstruction_graph = nx.Graph()\n\n# Vertices for the first 3-cycle (a triangle)\nnodes_a = ['a0', 'a1', 'a2']\n# Vertices for the second 3-cycle\nnodes_b = ['b0', 'b1', 'b2']\nconstruction_graph.add_nodes_from(nodes_a)\nconstruction_graph.add_nodes_from(nodes_b)\n\n# Add the edges to form the two 3-cycles (K_3)\nconstruction_graph.add_edge('a0', 'a1'); construction_graph.add_edge('a1', 'a2'); construction_graph.add_edge('a2', 'a0')\nconstruction_graph.add_edge('b0', 'b1'); construction_graph.add_edge('b1', 'b2'); construction_graph.add_edge('b2', 'b0')\n\n# Step 2: Connect the two cycles.
