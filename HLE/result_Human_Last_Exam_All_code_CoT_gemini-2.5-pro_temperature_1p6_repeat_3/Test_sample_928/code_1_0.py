    # Step 1: Explain the context.
    # The user is asking about sentences from Noam Chomsky's 1957 book "Syntactic Structures,"
    # specifically from the section where he introduces "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."
    print("In his book 'Syntactic Structures', Noam Chomsky presents several example sentences to demonstrate that a sentence can be syntactically correct without having a clear meaning.")

    # Step 2: Identify the last pair of correct/incorrect sentences from that section.
    # While he gives a few examples, the last pair he uses to illustrate a violation
    # of grammatical rules (specifically, selectional rules for verbs) is the following:
    correct_sentence = "sincerity may frighten the boy."
    incorrect_sentence = "the boy may frighten sincerity."

    print(f"\nThe last key example of a syntactically correct sentence he gives in this argument is: '{correct_sentence}'")
    print(f"The corresponding syntactically incorrect (or 'deviant') sentence is: '{incorrect_sentence}'")

    # Step 3: Identify the two nouns used in these sentences.
    # The two nouns that are central to this pair of examples are 'sincerity' and 'boy'.
    # Their properties (one abstract, one animate) are the reason one sentence is grammatical
    # and the other is not.
    noun1 = "sincerity"
    noun2 = "boy"

    print(f"\nThe two nouns used in these last correct and incorrect sentences are '{noun1}' and '{noun2}'.")
