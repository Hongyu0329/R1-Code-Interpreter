    This function presents the solution to a classic tiling puzzle.

    The problem asks for the smallest integer k such that a square can be cut
    into k connected pieces, which can then be reassembled to form the
    original square in exactly five distinct (non-isomorphic) ways.

    This puzzle was solved by C. J. Bouwkamp using a computer search. The
    solution is not derived here but presented as a known result.
