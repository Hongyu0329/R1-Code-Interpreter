    print("\n1. Purpose of the Control:")
    print("The experiment aims to show that 500 mM GalNAc inhibits antibody binding. A critical confounding variable is whether this high concentration of GalNAc might be toxic to the cells, causing them to lose the MUC1-FLAG protein from their surface. If the MUC1 protein is lost, the antibody signal would decrease for reasons other than specific inhibition. The anti-FLAG antibody measures the total amount of MUC1 protein on the surface, regardless of its glycosylation. This allows you to verify that the protein is still present and that any signal decrease is due to competitive binding.")

    print("\n2. Timing of Addition:")
    print("The anti-FLAG antibody binds directly to the FLAG tag on the MUC1 protein expressed on the cell. It is, by definition, a primary antibody. Therefore, it must be added during the primary antibody incubation step.")
    
    print(f"\nConclusion: Choice C correctly identifies both the timing and the precise reason for including the anti-FLAG antibody.")
