    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n\n1.  First, I will create a list of the major rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid. These include rivers from Europe, Africa, and Asia that appear in various contexts, such as prophecies, descriptions on shields, or as geographical markers.\n2.  Next, I will find the approximate modern length of each of these real-world rivers.\n3.  Finally, I will create a Python script to store these rivers and their lengths, sort them from longest to shortest, and print the top three along with their lengths.\n\nHere is the Python code to accomplish this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_longest_rivers_in_aeneid():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n    \n    The function contains a predefined dictionary of rivers mentioned in the text\n    and their approximate real-world lengths in kilometers. It then sorts this\n    data to find and print the top three longest rivers.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approx. lengths (km)\n    # Sources include descriptions of places, Aeneas's shield (Book VIII),\n    # and travels.\n    rivers_in_aeneid = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Po': 652,\n        'Hebrus': 480,\n        'Tiber': 406,\n        'Xanthus': 100,\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order\n    # sorted() returns a list of tuples: [('Nile', 6650), ('Danube', 2850), ...]\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_in_aeneid.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Get the top three\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers, 1):\n        print(f\"{i}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\n# Execute the function\nfind_longest_rivers_in_aeneid()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Danube, and the Euphrates.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
