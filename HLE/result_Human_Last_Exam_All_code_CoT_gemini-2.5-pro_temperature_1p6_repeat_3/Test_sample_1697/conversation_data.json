    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) reaction followed by an electrophilic quench. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reactants:**\n    *   **Substrate:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has a benzene ring with two functional groups that can direct the reaction: an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CON(Et)₂) and a dimethylamino group (-N(Me)₂).\n    *   **Reagents (Step 1):** sec-BuLi (sec-butyllithium) and TMEDA (tetramethylethylenediamine). This combination is a very strong base used to deprotonate (remove a proton from) a carbon atom. TMEDA chelates the lithium ion, increasing the basicity of the sec-butyl anion.\n\n2.  **Determine the Site of Reaction (Step 1):**\n    *   Both the -CON(Et)₂ and -N(Me)₂ groups are \"directing groups\". They coordinate to the lithium ion and direct the deprotonation to an adjacent (*ortho*) carbon atom on the ring.\n    *   The N,N-diethylcarboxamide group is one of the most powerful known directing groups. It directs deprotonation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C6).\n    *   The dimethylamino group is also a good directing group. It directs deprotonation to its *ortho* positions (C2 and C4).\n    *   The C2 position is *ortho* to both directing groups. This cooperative effect makes the hydrogen atom at the C2 position the most acidic and the most likely to be removed by the strong base.\n    *   Therefore, the first step creates an aryllithium intermediate where the hydrogen at C2 is replaced by lithium.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Step:**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile (a carbon-based anion).\n    *   It reacts with methyl iodide (CH₃I), which is an electrophile.\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon anion at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, forming a new C-C bond and displacing the iodide ion.\n\n4.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The net result of the two steps is the replacement of the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n    *   The final compound is therefore **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\nI will now write a Python script to print this step-by-step logic and the name of the final product.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the reaction of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n    with sec-BuLi/TMEDA and then methyl iodide, and prints the final product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    reagent_1 = \"sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF\"\n    reagent_2 = \"methyl iodide (CH3I)\"\n\n    print(\"--- Chemical Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Starting Material: {starting_material}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 1: Directed Ortho-Metalation ---\")\n    print(f\"The starting material is treated with the strong base, {reagent_1}.\")\n    print(\"The molecule has two directing groups on the benzene ring:\")\n    print(\"  1.
