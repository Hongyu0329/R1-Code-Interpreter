    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Functions**: First, we will define the given supply and demand functions in our code.\n    *   Supply: `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)`\n    *   Demand: `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))`\n\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium**: Market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded (`Q_S = Q_D = Q_E`) and the price is the same for both. We will find this equilibrium quantity (`Q_E`) by setting the supply and demand equations equal to each other:\n    `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    Since this equation is complex and cannot be solved algebraically, we will use a numerical solver from Python's `scipy` library to find the value of `Q_E`. Once `Q_E` is found, we can calculate the equilibrium price (`P_E`) by substituting `Q_E` back into either the supply or demand function.\n\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare**: Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. A more direct way to calculate it is by integrating the area between the demand and supply curves up to the equilibrium quantity.\n    *   **Total Welfare = (Integral of the Demand Function) - (Integral of the Supply Function)**\n    *   The integral for the demand function will be from `0` to `Q_E`.\n    *   The supply function `P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q_S^3 - 2 > 0`, which means `Q > (2)^(1/3)`. Therefore, the integral for the supply function will be from `(2)^(1/3)` to `Q_E`.\n    *   We will use numerical integration (specifically, the `quad` function from `scipy.integrate`) to compute these definite integrals.\n\n4.  **Display the Result**: Finally, the script will print out the values used in the total welfare calculation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef supply_func(Q):\n    \"\"\"Defines the supply function P = ln(Q^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    # The function is only defined for Q^3 - 2 > 0\n    if Q**3 - 2 <= 0:\n        return np.inf  # Return a very large number for invalid inputs to guide the solver\n    return np.log(Q**3 - 2)\n\ndef demand_func(Q):\n    \"\"\"Defines the demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q))\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium\ndef find_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"Finds the equilibrium quantity (Q_E) and price (P_E)\"\"\"\n    # Define an equation representing the difference between demand and supply\n    def equilibrium_equation(Q):\n        return demand_func(Q) - supply_func(Q)\n\n    # Provide an initial guess for the solver.
