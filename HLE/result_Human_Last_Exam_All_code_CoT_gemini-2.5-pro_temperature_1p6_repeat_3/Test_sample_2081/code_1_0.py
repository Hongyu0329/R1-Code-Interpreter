# Based on the derivation, the equation for the square of the radius R is:
# R^2 = C1 * (C2 + C3)
# where C1 = 0.5, C2 = e^(2T), and C3 = e^T.

# From T = ln(10^34), we have e^T = 10^34 and e^2T = 10^68.
# We define these numbers as Decimal types for precision.
C1 = Decimal("0.5")
C2 = Decimal("1e68")
C3 = Decimal("1e34")

# Calculate the square of the radius R.
R_squared = C1 * (C2 + C3)

# Calculate the radius R by taking the square root.
R = R_squared.sqrt()

# Print the final equation with the numerical values plugged in, and the result for R.
# This satisfies the instruction to "output each number in the final equation".
