    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, we will follow a constructive approach rooted in the theory of Diophantine approximation and its connection to continued fractions.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Definition:** The \"generalized Markov number\" $m_r$ for a rational number $r$ can refer to several concepts. In this context, the most likely interpretation is that the associated continued fraction is a specific quadratic irrational number whose continued fraction expansion is constructed from that of $r$. For a rational number $r = [a_0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]$ between 0 and 1 (so $a_0 = 0$), the associated quadratic irrational is given by:\n    $\\alpha_r = [0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1}]$\n    This construction creates a palindromic repeating block from the partial quotients of $r$.\n\n2.  **Compute Continued Fraction of r:** First, we need to find the continued fraction expansion of the rational number $r = 4/7$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Associated Continued Fraction:** Using the coefficients from the expansion of $4/7$, we will build the palindromic repeating block and form the final continued fraction.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will provide a Python script that carries out these steps and prints the resulting continued fraction, showing each number in the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the computation:\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coeffs(r: Fraction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the list of coefficients for the continued fraction expansion of a rational number.\n    Example: 4/7 -> [0, 1, 1, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    num = r.numerator\n    den = r.denominator\n    \n    while den != 0:\n        quotient = num // den\n        remainder = num % den\n        coeffs.append(quotient)\n        num = den\n        den = remainder\n        \n    return coeffs\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to compute and display the continued fraction associated\n    with the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The rational number in question is 4/7.\n    r = Fraction(4, 7)\n    \n    # Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of r = 4/7.\n    # The coefficients will be of the form [a_0; a_1, a_2, ..., a_n].\n    all_coeffs = get_continued_fraction_coeffs(r)\n    \n    # Since 0 < 4/7 < 1, the first coefficient a_0 is 0.\n    # We are interested in the block of coefficients A = (a_1, ..., a_n).\n    A = all_coeffs[1:]\n    \n    # Step 2: Construct the reverse of block A.\n    A_rev = A[::-1]\n    \n    # Step 3: The repeating block of the associated continued fraction is A followed by A_rev.\n    repeating_block = A + A_rev\n    \n    # Step 4: Format and print the final result.\n    # The associated continued fraction is [0; overline{repeating_block}].\n    # We will print this in a readable format, showing all the numbers.\n    \n    print(f\"The continued fraction expansion of {r} is: [{all_coeffs[0]}; {', '.join(map(str, A))}]\")\n    \n    repeating_block_str = ', '.join(map(str, repeating_block))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number m_{4/7} is:\")\n    # We represent the repeating nature by indicating the block.\n    # The final equation form is [0; a, b, c, ...], where the block [a, b, c, ...] repeats.\n    print(f\"m_{{4/7}} = [0; {repeating_block_str}, ...]\")\n    print(f\"This is a periodic continued fraction where the block [{repeating_block_str}] repeats infinitely.\")\n    print(f\"In standard notation: m_{{4/7}} = [0; \\\\overline{{{repeating_block_str}}}]\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<m_{4/7} = [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]>>>"
