# The problem asks for the properties of X, the set of regular cardinals lambda
# for which a certain type of tower of uncountable subsets of omega_1 exists.
#
# Step 1: Characterize the length of such towers.
# Based on established theorems in set theory (ZFC):
# a) The length of any such tower, if it's a regular cardinal lambda, must be at least omega_1.
#    This is because any tower of a smaller regular cardinality (i.e., omega) would have
#    a pseudo-intersection, violating the tower's maximality condition.
#    This means for any lambda in X, lambda >= omega_1.
#
# b) The length of any such tower lambda must be at most omega_1.
#    This is because a tower of length lambda > omega_1 would imply the existence of
#    more than omega_1 "almost disjoint" uncountable subsets of omega_1, which is impossible.
#    This means for any lambda in X, lambda <= omega_1.
#
# c) A tower of length omega_1 is known to exist in ZFC. The construction is non-trivial but standard.
#    This means the set X is not empty, and omega_1 is an element of X.

# Step 2: Determine the set X.
# From (a) and (b), any element lambda in X must be omega_1.
# From (c), we know that omega_1 is in X.
# Therefore, the set X is exactly {omega_1}.
X = {Cardinal("omega_1")}

# Step 3: Define and calculate delta_1 and delta_2.
# delta_1 is the supremum (least upper bound) of X.
delta_1 = Cardinal("omega_1")  # sup({omega_1}) = omega_1
# delta_2 is the infimum (greatest lower bound) of X.
delta_2 = Cardinal("omega_1")  # inf({omega_1}) = omega_1

# Step 4: Calculate the final sum.
# The sum is calculated using cardinal arithmetic.
result = delta_1 + delta_2

# Output the reasoning and the final equation.
