The problem asks to identify the effect that is LEAST LIKELY to arise from a "coarsening gas" during sintering. Let's analyze the effects:

1.  Trapped Gas Effects: The evolution of gas within the part can lead to several common problems. As the part densifies and pores close, gas gets trapped.
    -   This trapped gas exerts pressure, hindering or stopping densification. This directly leads to lower final densities and the presence of large voids (Choice C).
    -   The amount of trapped gas depends on the heating schedule. A faster heating rate (Choice A) leaves less time for gas to escape before pores close, trapping more gas and resulting in lower density. This effect is very likely.
    -   A part with a higher initial (green) density (Choice F) has smaller pores that close earlier, trapping more gas and leading to a lower final density. This counter-intuitive effect is also a likely hallmark of gas entrapment.

2.  "Coarsening Gas" Specifics: The gas is described as promoting coarsening (grain growth).
    -   Since the gas is trapped more effectively in the interior of the part, it will cause more coarsening there, leading to larger grains in the interior than near the surface (Choice D). This is a very likely outcome.

3.  Chemical Nature: The gas comes from an impurity and its formation can be a chemical reaction.
    -   This reaction can depend on the surrounding atmosphere (e.g., presence of water vapor). Therefore, seeing de-densification under some atmospheres but not others (Choice B) is very likely.

4.  Extreme Effects (Bloating vs. Cracking): High internal gas pressure causes stress.
    -   The part can relieve this stress by de-densifying, or "bloating" (Choice B). This is a form of high-temperature plastic deformation.
    -   If the pressure becomes even higher, it can overcome the material's strength and cause cracking (Choice E).
    -   However, the pressure required to crack the part is typically much higher than the pressure needed to cause bloating. The material will generally bloat to relieve stress first. Cracking is a more severe, catastrophic failure that happens only under the most extreme conditions.

Conclusion: All the options describe plausible phenomena, but cracking (E) requires the most extreme conditions and is a less general outcome than bloating (B) or the other effects on the microstructure (A, C, D, F). Therefore, cracking is the least likely effect to arise.
