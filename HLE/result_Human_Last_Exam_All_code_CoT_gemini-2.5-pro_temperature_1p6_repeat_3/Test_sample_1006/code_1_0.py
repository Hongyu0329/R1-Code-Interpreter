def solve_homeomorphism_classes():
    """
    Solves the topology problem regarding the number of homeomorphism classes.

    The problem describes a compact topological space X with two properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.

    Step-by-step reasoning:
    1. The two properties are the defining characteristics of the Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted as beta(R).
       - Property (1) states X is a compactification of R.
       - Property (2) is the universal property for bounded real-valued continuous functions that defines beta(R).

    2. The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space (which the long ray is) is unique up to homeomorphism.
       This means that any two spaces X_1 and X_2 that satisfy the given conditions are homeomorphic to each other.

    3. Since all such spaces X are homeomorphic, they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.

    4. Therefore, the number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.
