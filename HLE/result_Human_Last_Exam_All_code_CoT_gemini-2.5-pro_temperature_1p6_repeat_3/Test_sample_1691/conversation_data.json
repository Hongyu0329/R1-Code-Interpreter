    "Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n1.  The integral is $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$.\n2.  For a small positive $\\epsilon$, the value of the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + f(x)}$ where $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ becomes very large when the denominator is close to zero. Since $x \\ge 0$, we find that $f(x)=0$ only at $x=0$. Therefore, the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n3.  We can approximate the function $f(x)$ for small $x$. The term with the lowest power of $x$ will dominate. So, $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$.\n4.  With this approximation, the integral becomes $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n5.  The value of the integrand is significant only when $9.0 x^{5.0}$ is comparable to $\\epsilon$, i.e., when $x$ is very small. For larger $x$, the integrand quickly becomes small. For example, at $x=15.00$, the denominator is already very large. Thus, extending the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to infinity will not introduce a significant error, and it makes the integral analytically solvable.\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n6.  This integral is a standard form that can be solved using the substitution $u^5 = \\frac{9.0}{\\epsilon}x^5$. The general result for this type of integral leads to a formula of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx A \\cdot \\epsilon^B$.\n7.  The exponent is $B = \\frac{1}{n}-1$ and the coefficient is $A = c^{-1/n} \\frac{\\pi/n}{\\sin(\\pi/n)}$, where $c=9.0$ and $n=5.0$ are the coefficient and exponent of the dominant term in $f(x)$.\n8.  I will write a Python script to compute the numerical values of A and B and print the resulting analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef approximate_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function develops an analytical formula that approximates the integral\n    I(epsilon) for a small epsilon.\n\n    The integral is given by:\n    I(epsilon) = integral from 0 to 15.00 of 1 / (epsilon + 9.0*x^5.0 + 5.0*x^6.0 + 9.0*x^8.0) dx\n\n    The approximation follows the plan outlined above.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Parameters from the dominant term 9.0 * x^5.0\n    c = 9.0  # Coefficient of the lowest power term\n    n = 5.0  # The lowest power of x\n\n    # Calculate the exponent B for the epsilon term\n    B = (1.0 / n) - 1.0\n\n    # Calculate the constant coefficient A\n    # The value of the related definite integral is (pi/n) / sin(pi/n)\n    integral_part = (math.pi / n) / math.sin(math.pi / n)\n    A = math.pow(c, -1.0 / n) * integral_part\n\n    # Print the resulting analytical formula with numerical values\n    print(\"The analytical approximation for I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) = A * epsilon^B\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculated values:\")\n    print(f\"A = {A:.8f}\")\n    print(f\"B = {B:.1f}\")\n\n    # Display the final formula\n    print(\"\\nThe final formula is:\")\n    # The user asked to output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) = {A:.8f} * epsilon^({B:.1f})\")\n    \n    return A\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    approximate_integral()\n```\n<<<0.68870381>>>"
