    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use a method analogous to the Euclidean algorithm for integers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Form a Block Matrix**: Stack the two matrices P1 and P2 vertically to form a single 4x2 matrix, let's call it `M`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  **Apply Elementary Row Operations**: Use elementary row operations to reduce this matrix `M`. The goal is to transform `M` into a form where the bottom 2x2 block is a zero matrix. An elementary row operation consists of replacing a row with the sum of that row and a polynomial multiple of another row (e.g., `Row_i <- Row_i + p(s) * Row_j`).\n3.  **Identify the GCRD**: The remaining non-zero rows in the upper part of the transformed matrix will form the GCRD. Since we are looking for a 2x2 GCRD, we should be left with two non-zero rows.\n4.  **Implement in Python**: Use the `sympy` library in Python to handle the symbolic variable `s` and perform the polynomial algebra and matrix operations. The script will perform a specific sequence of row operations that correctly reduces the matrix `M`.\n5.  **Print the Result**: The final GCRD matrix will be printed, showing each of its elements as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s**2 + s, -s],\n        [-s**2 - 1, s**2]\n    ])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s, 0],\n        [-s - 1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    # 1.
