    # --- Question 1 Analysis ---
    print("Question 1: What is the complexity class of a constant precision transformer?")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("1. A transformer model has a constant number of layers (e.g., 12, 24).")
    print("2. The input is a sequence of length 'n', and the model's width/dimension 'd' is polynomial in 'n'.")
    print("3. 'Constant precision' means all numbers (weights, activations) are represented by a fixed number 'c' of bits. The complexity of arithmetic on these numbers (addition, multiplication) is O(1), as 'c' is constant.")
    print("4. The core operations within each layer are:")
    print("   - Matrix Multiplication: Multiplying matrices of poly(n) size. With constant precision numbers, this operation is known to be in TC0 (constant-depth threshold circuits of polynomial size).")
    print("   - Softmax: This involves exponentiation, a sum over 'n' elements, and division. With constant precision, 'exp' is a lookup table (constant complexity). The summation of poly(n) numbers and division are also in TC0.")
    print("5. Since the entire transformer is a composition of a constant number of such layers, and each layer is a constant composition of TC0 functions, the entire model can be simulated by TC0 circuits.")
    print("\nConclusion 1: A constant precision transformer is in the complexity class TC0.")
    print("The final class name has the components: T, C, and the number 0.")
    print("\n")

    # --- Question 2 Analysis ---
    print("Question 2: What is the complexity class with polynomial steps of chain-of-thought?")
    print("-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("1. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for 'k' steps means we run the transformer, feed its output back as new input, and repeat this process 'k' times.")
    print("2. The problem specifies 'polynomial steps', so k = poly(n), where 'n' is the input size.")
    print("3. This creates a sequential computation: Output_k = F(F(...F(Input)...)), where F is the function computed by one transformer pass. This process cannot be parallelized across the steps.")
    print("4. From the first part, we established that F is in TC0.")
    print("5. Iterating a function from a parallel complexity class (like TC0) for a polynomial number of steps is a standard way to characterize the power of sequential computation. This is known to be equivalent to the class P (problems solvable in Polynomial Time).")
    print("6. To see why, consider that a polynomial-time Turing Machine can be simulated by polynomially iterating its 'next-state' function. This function itself is very simple (computable in NC1, a subset of TC0). Since a TC0 function can simulate the machine's next step, iterating it polynomially can simulate the entire polynomial-time computation.")
    print("\nConclusion 2: A constant precision transformer with polynomial CoT represents the complexity class P.")
    print("The final class name has the component: P.")
