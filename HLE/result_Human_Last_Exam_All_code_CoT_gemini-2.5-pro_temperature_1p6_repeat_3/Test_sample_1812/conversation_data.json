    "Of course. The task is to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix. While the problem mentions the \"adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\", the matrix `A` is explicitly provided. Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the determinant of `A`.\n\nI will provide a Python script that calculates the determinant step-by-step using the standard cofactor expansion formula and prints out each stage of the calculation, as requested. This will clearly show how each number in the matrix contributes to the final result.\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \na & b & c \\\\ \nd & e & f \\\\ \ng & h & i \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nis `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Define the given matrix.\n2.  Substitute the matrix elements into the determinant formula.\n3.  Calculate the result in stages, printing each step.\n4.
