    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the task:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** I will first interpret the terms in the question.\n    *   **\"Squarefree natural numbers (N)\"**: These are positive integers not divisible by any perfect square other than 1 (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10). These numbers are used to define real quadratic number fields, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$.\n    *   **\"Covolume (V)\"**: This is the volume of the fundamental domain of the lattice formed by the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of the field $K$. For real quadratic fields, the covolume is $V = \\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field.\n    *   **\"Maximum norm ($k_{k,\\infty}$)\"**: This notation, while not standard, most likely refers to a quantity derived from the Archimedean valuations (or \"infinite primes\") of the field. A plausible interpretation is $k_{k,\\infty} = \\min_{\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K \\setminus \\{0\\}} \\max_{\\sigma}|\\sigma(\\alpha)|$, which represents the minimum possible value for the largest absolute value among the conjugates of any non-zero algebraic integer $\\alpha$ in the field.\n\n2.  **State the Theoretical Bound:** I will use Minkowski's theorem on convex bodies to find the relationship between $k_{k,\\infty}$ and the covolume $V$. This theorem provides an upper bound for $k_{k,\\infty}$ in terms of $V$. For real quadratic fields ($n=2, s=0$), this bound simplifies to a clear and direct formula.\n\n3.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this relationship. The script will:\n    *   Take a list of example squarefree natural numbers $N$.\n    *   For each $N$, it will calculate the field discriminant $\\Delta_K$.\n    *   It will then compute the covolume $V = \\sqrt{\\Delta_K}$.\n    *   Finally, it will calculate the upper bound for $k_{k,\\infty}$ using the derived formula.\n    *   The script will print out each step of the calculation, showing the final inequality with all the computed numbers, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_bound_for_real_quadratic(N_values):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the upper bound for the 'maximum norm' k_{k,inf}\n    in relation to the covolume V for real quadratic fields Q(sqrt(N)).\n\n    The bound is derived from Minkowski's theorem and for a real quadratic\n    field is given by k_{k,inf} <= V^(1/2).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\n        \"This script calculates the upper bound for k_{k,inf} for real quadratic fields K = Q(sqrt(N)),\\n\"\n        \"where N is a squarefree natural number.
