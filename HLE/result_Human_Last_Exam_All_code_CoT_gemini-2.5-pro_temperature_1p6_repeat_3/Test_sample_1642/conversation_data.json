    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of non-attacking queens that can be placed on a 16x16 chessboard. This is a classic combinatorial problem known as the N-Queens problem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the board size:** The chessboard is 16x16, so N = 16.\n2.  **Relate the problem to the N-Queens problem:** The condition that no queens (white or black) attack each other means this is a standard N-Queens problem. We are trying to place a total of `2m` queens on the board.\n3.  **Determine the maximum number of queens:** For any N x N board where N > 3, the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place is N. This is due to the pigeonhole principle: if you were to place N+1 queens, at least two would have to share the same row, and would thus attack each other.\n4.  **Formulate the equation:** The total number of queens is `m` white + `m` black, which equals `2m`. We set this equal to the maximum possible number of queens on a 16x16 board, which is 16.\n5.  **Solve for m:** The equation is `2 * m = 16`. Solving for `m` gives us the answer.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this logic and print the explanation and the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 board without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Size of the chessboard\n    n = 16\n\n    # For an N x N board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is N.\n    # This is because placing N+1 queens would force at least two to be in the same row.\n    max_total_queens = n\n\n    # The total number of queens is m white queens + m black queens = 2 * m.\n    # We set the total number of queens to the maximum possible value.\n    # The equation is: 2 * m = max_total_queens\n    # We can now solve for m.\n    m = max_total_queens // 2\n    \n    # We are asked to output the numbers in the final equation.\n    # The final equation is 2 * m = 16, which means m = 8.\n    # So we print the solved equation.\n    \n    print(f\"On a {n}x{n} chessboard, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is {n}.\")\n    print(\"The total number of queens is the sum of white and black queens: m + m = 2 * m.\")\n    print(\"To find the maximum value of m, we set up the equation:\")\n    print(f\"2 * m = {max_total_queens}\")\n    print(\"\\nSolving for m:\")\n    print(f\"{2} * {m} = {max_total_queens}\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximum number m is {m}.\")\n\nsolve_queen_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
