    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum, we need to find the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule. This is done by analyzing the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule, 1,3,5-tri[...]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, has a central benzene ring with identical substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in the central core and within a single one of these arms.\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:** The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene unit. We will count the unique proton signals from its methyl groups.\n3.  **Count Signals from the Linker:** Each substituent arm is connected to the central ring by a methylene (`-CH2-`) group. We will determine the number of signals from this linker.\n4.  **Count Signals from the Indazole Substituent:** We will analyze the complex, chiral indazole moiety, `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`, and count all of its non-equivalent proton sets. This structure is rigid, and its chirality will affect the equivalence of nearby protons.\n5.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of peaks will be the sum of the signals from the core, the linker, and the indazole unit.\n\nThe following Python script systematically counts the signals based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the expected number of 1H NMR peaks for the molecule\n    1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene\n    by analyzing its symmetry and structure.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
