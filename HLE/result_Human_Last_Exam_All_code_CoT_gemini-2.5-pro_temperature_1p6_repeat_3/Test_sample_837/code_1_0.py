    # Step 1: Define Decidability
    # In computer science, a problem is decidable if there exists an algorithm
    # that is guaranteed to halt and produce the correct 'yes' or 'no' answer
    # for all possible inputs.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the "God" Problem
    # The question "does a god exist?" is not a formal problem based on
    # mathematical axioms or observable inputs that an algorithm can process.
    # It's a metaphysical question.
    
    # Step 3: Explain the Impasse
    # We could easily write two simple algorithms:
    # Algorithm A: always outputs "yes".
    # Algorithm B: always outputs "no".
    
    # One of these two algorithms would, in theory, be correct.
    # However, for a problem to be decidable, we must be able to *construct*
    # a single algorithm and *prove* that it is the correct one.
    
    # Since there is no agreed-upon set of axioms, evidence, or formal system
    # to verify the answer, we cannot computationally determine which algorithm
    # is correct. Therefore, the problem falls outside the scope of what can be
    # algorithmically decided.
