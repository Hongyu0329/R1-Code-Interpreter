    "This problem can be solved by analyzing the structure of the reflection group H3 and its elements.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group Structure:** The reflection group of type H3 is the symmetry group of the icosahedron, which is isomorphic to the direct product `A_5 × Z_2`. Here, `A_5` is the alternating group on 5 elements (representing the rotational symmetries), and `Z_2` is the group of order 2, generated by the central inversion (`-I`).\n2.  **Relate Element Properties to Group Structure:** An element `w` in H3 has an eigenvalue `λ` of a certain order. The order of `λ` must divide the order of the element `w`. Therefore, if `λ` has order 10, the order of `w` must be a multiple of 10.\n3.  **Determine Element Orders:** An element in `A_5 × Z_2` is a pair `(g, h)`, where `g ∈ A_5` and `h ∈ Z_2`. Its order is the least common multiple of the orders of `g` and `h`. The possible orders of elements in `A_5` are 1, 2, 3, and 5. The possible orders of elements in `Z_2` are 1 and 2. To get an element of order 10, we must have `lcm(order(g), order(h)) = 10`. This is only possible if `order(g) = 5` and `order(h) = 2`.\n4.  **Check the \"Regular Eigenvector\" Condition:** We need to verify that these elements of order 10 indeed have a regular eigenvector. An eigenvector is regular if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes. A sufficient condition for this is that the element itself is *regular*, which in a reflection group is equivalent to being *fixed-point-free* (i.e., not having 1 as an eigenvalue).\n    *   An element `g` of order 5 in `A_5` is a rotation, with eigenvalues `{1, e^(iθ), e^(-iθ)}`.\n    *   The element `h` of order 2 in `Z_2` is the central inversion `-I`.\n    *   The combined element `w = (g,h)` acts as `-g`. Its eigenvalues are `{-1, -e^(iθ), -e^(-iθ)}`.\n    *   Since none of these eigenvalues is 1, the element `w` is fixed-point-free and thus regular. This guarantees that its eigenvectors are regular.\n    *   Furthermore, eigenvalues like `-e^(i2π/5) = e^(i7π/5) = e^(i14π/10)` have order 10.\n5.  **Count the Elements:** The problem is now reduced to counting the number of elements of order 10 in `A_5 × Z_2`. This is the product of the number of elements of order 5 in `A_5` and the number of elements of order 2 in `Z_2`.\n6.  **Code the Calculation:** The Python script will calculate these quantities and present the final result as an equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_h3_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have\n    a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem reduces to finding the number of elements of order 10 in the group H3.\n    # The group H3 is isomorphic to A_5 x Z_2.\n    # An element has order 10 if it is formed by a direct product of an element of order 5\n    # from A_5 and an element of order 2 from Z_2.\n\n    # 1.
