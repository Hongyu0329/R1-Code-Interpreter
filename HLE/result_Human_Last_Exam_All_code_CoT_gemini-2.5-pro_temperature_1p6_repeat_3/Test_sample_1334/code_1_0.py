    # --- Part (a) ---
    # Question: True or false: If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N,
    # then N must act semi-regularly on the vertex and face sets.
    # Reasoning:
    # A smooth covering implies `ord(g) = ord(gN)` for `g` being the generators `b`, `w`, and their product `bw`.
    # This is equivalent to the condition that the intersection of the cyclic group `<g>` and the normal subgroup `N` is trivial, i.e., `<g> \cap N = {e}`.
    # The vertex and face sets of the dessin D can be represented by the sets of right cosets of `<g_v>` and `<g_f>` respectively,
    # where `g_v` can be `b` or `w`, and `g_f` is `bw`.
    # The action of N on a vertex (or face) `H<g_s>` (where `s` is `v` or `f`, and H is a generic element of G) is semi-regular if the stabilizer of any point is trivial.
    # The stabilizer of `H<g_s>` under the action of N is Stab_N(H<g_s>) = {n \in N | nH<g_s> = H<g_s>}.
    # This equality holds if and only if `H^{-1}nH \in <g_s>`.
    # Since N is a normal subgroup, `H^{-1}nH` is also an element of N.
    # Therefore, any element of the stabilizer `n` must satisfy `H^{-1}nH \in <g_s> \cap N`.
    # From the smooth covering condition, this intersection is the trivial group `{e}`.
    # So, `H^{-1}nH = e`, which implies `n = e`.
    # Thus, the stabilizer is trivial for any vertex or face, and the action of N is semi-regular.
    answer_a = "True"

    # --- Part (b) ---
    # Question: State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering
    # of D_N where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    # Reasoning:
    # The question provides a definition of a quasi-simple group in parentheses:
    # "G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G')".
    # A group G is perfect if it is equal to its commutator subgroup, G = G'.
    # The definition given for a quasi-simple group explicitly includes the condition that G must be perfect.
    # Therefore, if G is quasi-simple, it is necessary for it to be a perfect group by definition.
    # The other conditions mentioned in the question are not needed to answer this part.
    answer_b = "True"

    # --- Part (c) ---
    # Question: Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin
    # that is a smooth covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # Reasoning:
    # 1. G is face-quasiprimitive: The action of G on its set of faces, \Omega, is quasiprimitive. This means every non-trivial normal subgroup of G acts transitively on \Omega.
    # 2. Regular dessin: The faces of the dessin correspond to the cosets of the subgroup generated by c = bw, i.e., \Omega = G/<c>.
    # 3. This implies that the stabilizer of a face in G is the cyclic group <c>.
    # 4. We are given a quasiprimitive group G acting on a set \Omega where the point stabilizers are cyclic.
    # 5. A theorem by C. E. Praeger classifies such groups. A quasiprimitive permutation group with a cyclic point stabilizer must be of one of two types:
    #    a) Affine type: G has a regular, elementary abelian normal subgroup. This corresponds to the (HA) Holomorph Affine type.
    #    b) Almost Simple type: The socle of G is a non-abelian simple group. This corresponds to the (AS) Almost Simple type.
    # 6. Other types, like the diagonal types (SD, CD), are ruled out because their point stabilizers must contain a non-abelian simple group, which cannot be cyclic.
    answer_c = "HA, AS"

    # Print the final combined answer in the required format.
