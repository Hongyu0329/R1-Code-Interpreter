    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the mantissa of this number when expressed in scientific notation.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We can write $N$ in scientific notation as $N = K \\times 10^E$, where $1 \\le K < 10$ is the mantissa and $E$ is an integer exponent. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ will be the first two digits of $K$.\n\nTo find $K$ and $E$, we use the base-10 logarithm:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nWe can rewrite $\\log_{10}(e)$ as $\\frac{1}{\\ln(10)}$. So,\n$\\log_{10}(N) = - \\frac{7^{13}}{\\ln(10)}$\n\nLet $L = \\log_{10}(N)$. We can express $L$ as the sum of its integer and fractional parts: $L = \\lfloor L \\rfloor + \\{L\\}$, where $\\lfloor L \\rfloor$ is the integer part (floor of L) and $\\{L\\}$ is the fractional part ($0 \\le \\{L\\} < 1$).\n\nThen, $N = 10^L = 10^{\\lfloor L \\rfloor + \\{L\\}} = 10^{\\{L\\}} \\times 10^{\\lfloor L \\rfloor}$.\nComparing this to $N = K \\times 10^E$, we find that the exponent is $E = \\lfloor L \\rfloor$ and the mantissa is $K = 10^{\\{L\\}}$.\n\nThe calculation of $7^{13}$ and the logarithm requires high precision, for which we will use Python's `decimal` module.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan:\n1.  It sets up a high-precision decimal context.\n2.  It calculates $L = - \\frac{7^{13}}{\\ln(10)}$.\n3.  It determines the fractional part, $M = \\{L\\} = L - \\lfloor L \\rfloor$.\n4.  It calculates the mantissa, $K = 10^M$.\n5.  Finally, it extracts and prints the first two digits of $K$.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Set the precision for the calculation. 50 digits is sufficient.\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n# Let N = e^(-7^13). We want to find its first two non-zero digits.\n# We express N in scientific notation as N = K * 10^E, where 1 <= K < 10.\n# The leading digits of N are the digits of K.\n# We find K by computing the base-10 logarithm of N.\n# log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e) = -7^13 / ln(10)\nlog10_N = -(decimal.Decimal(7)**13) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\n\n# The logarithm log10(N) can be split into an integer part E and a fractional part M:\n# log10(N) = E + M, where E = floor(log10(N)) and 0 <= M < 1.\n# The mantissa of N is then K = 10^M.\nM = log10_N - log10_N.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\nK = decimal.Decimal(10)**M\n\n# The final equation to find the mantissa is K = 10^M.\n# The values of M and K are:\nprint(f\"The fractional part of the logarithm (M) is: {M}\")\nprint(f\"The mantissa (K = 10^M) is: {K}\")\n\n# The first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are the first two digits of K.\nk_str = str(K)\nfirst_two_digits = k_str[0] + k_str[2] # k_str[1] is the decimal point\n\nprint(f\"The first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are: {first_two_digits}\")\n```\n<<<36>>>"
