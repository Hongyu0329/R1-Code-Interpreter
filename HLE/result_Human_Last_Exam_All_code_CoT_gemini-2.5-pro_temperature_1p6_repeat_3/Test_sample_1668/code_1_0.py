# Step 1: Assign the value for each banknote from the 1992 series.
# The banknote with the image of a bison has a value of 100 rubles.
bison_value = 100
# The banknote with the image of an elk has a value of 25 rubles.
elk_value = 25
# The banknote with the image of a lynx has a value of 50 rubles.
lynx_value = 50
# The banknote with the image of a hare has a value of 1 ruble.
hare_value = 1

# Step 2: Calculate the total sum of the banknotes.
total_value = bison_value + elk_value + lynx_value + hare_value

# Step 3: Print the equation with each number and the final result.
print(f"The total value is calculated by the following equation:")
print(f"{bison_value} + {elk_value} + {lynx_value} + {hare_value} = {total_value}")
