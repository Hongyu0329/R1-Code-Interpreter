    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we will follow this plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System:** The system consists of two independent patches of surface code. The total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n2.  **Qubits per Patch:** For a single planar surface code patch, the number of logical qubits it can encode is determined by its number of boundaries. The formula is `k = N - 1`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits and `N` is the total number of boundaries.\n3.  **Calculate Boundaries:** A patch with holes has one outer boundary and a number of inner boundaries equal to the number of holes. So, `N = 1 (outer) + num_holes (inner)`.\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    *   For one patch with two holes, `N = 1 + 2 = 3` boundaries.\n    *   The number of logical qubits per patch is `k = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n    *   Since there are two identical patches, the total number of logical qubits is `2 * 2 = 4`.\n5.  **Code:** We will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Number of separate surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# For a single planar surface code patch, the number of logical qubits (k)\n# is given by the formula k = N - 1, where N is the total number of boundaries.\n# The total number of boundaries is the sum of the outer boundary (1) and the inner boundaries (holes).\nnum_boundaries_per_patch = 1 + num_holes_per_patch\n\n# Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch using the formula k = N - 1\nqubits_per_patch = num_boundaries_per_patch - 1\n\n# The total number of logical qubits for the entire system is the sum of the qubits\n# from each independent patch. Since the patches are identical, we multiply.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * qubits_per_patch\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final result\nprint(f\"Number of boundaries per patch (N) = 1 (outer) + {num_holes_per_patch} (holes) = {num_boundaries_per_patch}\")\nprint(f\"Logical qubits per patch = N - 1 = {num_boundaries_per_patch} - 1 = {qubits_per_patch}\")\nprint(f\"Total logical qubits = Number of patches * Logical qubits per patch\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {num_patches} * ((1 + {num_holes_per_patch}) - 1) = {total_logical_qubits}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTherefore, at most {total_logical_qubits} logical qubits can be encoded.\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
