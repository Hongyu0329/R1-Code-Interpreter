    "Based on the described scene, the movie you are looking for is \"The Goonies\" (1985).\n\nMy plan is to identify the movie and the specific scene based on your description. The key elements are a teenager, a pink bike, and a confrontation with an oncoming car. The scene in question features the character Brandon \"Brand\" Walsh (played by Josh Brolin), who takes a little girl's small pink bike and rides it directly into the path of his mother's car to make her stop. I will then create a simple Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the movie based on a specific scene.\n    \n    The scene involves a teenager riding a pink bike toward an oncoming car.\n    This occurs in the 1985 film \"The Goonies,\" produced by Amblin Entertainment \n    and distributed by Warner Bros., a major film studio.\n    \n    Character: Brandon \"Brand\" Walsh\n    Action: He rides a small pink bike into the path of his mother's car to stop it.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"The Goonies\"\n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film in which a teenager rides a pink bike directly toward an oncoming car is: {movie_title}\")\n\nfind_movie()\n```\n<<<The Goonies>>>"
