    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key topological formulas for Feynman diagrams:\n    *   `L = I - V + 1`, where `L` is the number of loops, `I` is the number of internal lines (propagators), and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   `n * V = 2 * I + E`, which relates the number of vertices (`V`), the number of lines meeting at each vertex (`n`), the number of internal lines (`I`), and the number of external lines (`E`).\n\n2.  **Apply the problem's constraints:**\n    *   We are given `L = 2` (a two-loop diagram).\n    *   The term \"interacting scalar field theory\" implies an interaction term like φⁿ, meaning `n ≥ 3`. I will analyze the most common cases, φ³ (`n=3`) and φ⁴ (`n=4`), to find the overall minimum.\n    *   To find the *minimum* number of vertices `V`, we should consider the case with the minimum possible number of external lines, which is `E = 0` (a vacuum diagram).\n\n3.  **Solve for V:** I will substitute `L=2` and `E=0` into the formulas and solve for `V` for both `n=3` and `n=4`.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:** The smaller value of `V` found will be the answer.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan, showing the derivation for each case and identifying the minimum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    for an interacting scalar field theory by analyzing the topological constraints\n    for different interaction types.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set known parameters from the problem description\n    L = 2  # Number of loops\n    E = 0  # Assume minimum external lines for minimum vertices\n\n    print(f\"To solve this, we use the topological formulas for Feynman diagrams.\")\n    print(f\"We are given L = {L} (two loops).
