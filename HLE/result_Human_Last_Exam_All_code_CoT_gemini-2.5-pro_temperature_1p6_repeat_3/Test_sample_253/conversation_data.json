    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: I will define the rules for the cellular automaton. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. This 3-cell neighborhood has 8 possible patterns (from `111` to `000`). Rule 110 maps these patterns to a new state for the center cell according to the binary representation of 110, which is `01101110`.\n\n2.  **Initialize the Grid**: I will set up a one-dimensional grid (a list in Python) to represent the cells. The grid will be initialized with all cells in state `0`, except for a single cell in the center which will be set to state `1`, as per the problem's starting condition. The grid will be made wide enough to ensure the pattern doesn't run into the boundaries during the simulation.\n\n3.  **Simulate Generations**: I will loop 20 times to simulate the 20 generations. In each loop, I will create a new grid for the next generation.\n\n4.  **Apply the Rule**: For each cell in the current grid, I will determine its 3-cell neighborhood, find the corresponding new state from Rule 110, and set the cell's state in the new grid.\n\n5.  **Output the Final Pattern**: After 20 generations, the simulation is complete. I will convert the final state of the grid into a binary string, trim any leading or trailing zeros, and print the resulting pattern.\n\n```python\ndef rule_110_simulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script simulates the cellular automaton Rule 110.\n    It starts from a single cell in state 1 and applies the rule 20 times,\n    then prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of generations to run the simulation\n    generations = 20\n\n    # Rule 110 is defined by the binary value 01101110.\n    # This list maps the integer value of a 3-cell neighborhood\n    # (e.g., (1,0,1) = 5) to the next state for the center cell.\n    # Pattern index (binary): 000  001  010  011  100  101  110  111\n    # Rule 110 (outcome):       0    1    1    1    0    1    1    0\n    rule_lookup = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n\n    # Set up the grid.
