        "2. Let's analyze the damage types:",
        "   - Choices A and E (Cracking): These are fissures. Repair focuses on stopping the crack, not typically on large-scale material build-up.",
        "   - Choice D (Creep Deformation): This is the stretching of the entire blade. A local weld build-up cannot correct this widespread geometric distortion.",
        "   - Choices B, C, and F all involve material loss and can be repaired by welding.",
        "3. Comparing the material loss mechanisms:",
        "   - Foreign Object Damage (B) and Corrosion (F) can be repaired this way. However, the most classic, frequent, and direct application of a dimensional 'build-up' repair is for blade tip damage.",
        "   - Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is the specific process where material is gradually ground away from the blade's tip. The repair explicitly involves adding material back to the tip to restore the precise, critical clearance between the blade and the engine casing.",
        "4. Conclusion: Therefore, Blade Tip Rub and Wear is the primary damage type addressed by a weld 'build-up' repair process."
