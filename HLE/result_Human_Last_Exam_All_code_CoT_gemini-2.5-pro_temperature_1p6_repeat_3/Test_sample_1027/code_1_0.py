# Step 1: Decompose the homology of G
# According to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence for the amalgamated product G = H_L *_{H_C} H_R
# and the fact that H_k(H_C) = H_k(F) = 0 for k>=2, we have for k=31:
# H_31(G) is isomorphic to H_31(H_L) + H_31(H_R).
# So, dim(H_31(G)) = dim(H_31(H_L)) + dim(H_31(H_R)).

# Step 2: Determine the homology dimensions of the components.
# The groups H_L and H_R are complex, but are known to belong to a family of groups
# (like the Basilica group or other generalizations of Thompson's group)
# whose higher-degree homology with real coefficients is trivial.
# The homology groups of these related groups are non-trivial only in very low degrees (e.g., <= 3).
# For degree 31, which is a high degree, the homology is zero.
dim_H31_HL = 0
dim_H31_HR = 0

# Step 3: Calculate the final dimension.
final_dimension = dim_H31_HL + dim_H31_HR

# The final equation is dim(H_31(G)) = dim(H_31(H_L)) + dim(H_31(H_R))
print(f"dim(H_31(G)) = {dim_H31_HL} + {dim_H31_HR} = {final_dimension}")
