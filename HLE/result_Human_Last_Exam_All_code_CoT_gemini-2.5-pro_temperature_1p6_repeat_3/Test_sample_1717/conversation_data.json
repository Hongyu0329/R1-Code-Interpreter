    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** First, we need the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode for a single player. According to the Terraria wiki and game data, this value is 3640.\n2.  **Identify the Scaling Formula:** Next, we need the formula Terraria's source code uses to scale boss health with multiple players in Expert Mode. The formula is:\n    `Total Health = Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))`\n3.  **Analyze the Formula with Infinite Players:** The term `(Number of Players - 1)` will approach infinity as the number of players approaches infinity. This means the formula itself results in an infinite amount of health.\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations from the Source Code:** The prompt specifies that the answer should be based on the game's source code. In programming, numbers are stored in data types with finite limits. Terraria stores NPC health in a 32-bit signed integer (`int`). The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is 2,147,483,647.\n5.  **Determine the True Maximum:** Although the mathematical formula goes to infinity, the game's engine cannot store a value larger than the integer limit. Therefore, the health value is effectively capped at this limit. The \"theoretical maximum\" in the context of the source code is this data type limit.\n6.  **Construct the Code:** The Python code will define these variables and print out an explanation of the logic, showing the final \"equation\" as a `min()` function comparing the result of the infinite formula and the integer cap, ultimately printing the cap itself as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\n    for an infinite number of players, based on the game's source code logic.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Base health for Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode (1 player)\n    base_health_expert = 3640\n\n    # 2. Per-player health increase factor in Expert Mode\n    per_player_increase = 0.35\n\n    # 3. Maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer, which caps the health value in the source code\n    max_health_cap = 2147483647\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The health scaling formula in Expert Mode is:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = Base Health * (1 + Multiplier * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Inserting the values for the Eye of Cthulhu:\")\n    print(f\"Total Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (N - 1)), where N is the number of players.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Analyzing for an infinite number of players (N -> infinity):\")\n    print(\"As the number of players 'N' approaches infinity, the calculated health also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"However, Terraria's source code stores health in a 32-bit signed integer, which has a hard limit.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: The final equation considers this technical limitation:\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Max Health = min( {base_health_expert} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (infinity - 1)), {max_health_cap} )\")\n\n    print(\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"The theoretical maximum health is capped by the 32-bit integer limit, which is {max_health_cap}.\")\n\nsolve_terraria_health_puzzle()\n<<<2147483647>>>\n```"
