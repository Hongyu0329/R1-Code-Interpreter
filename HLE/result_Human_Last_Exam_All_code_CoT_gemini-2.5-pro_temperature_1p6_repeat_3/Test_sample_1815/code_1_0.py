# The problem is a mathematical question about the existence of certain types of topologies on the integers.
# As explained in the reasoning above, we can demonstrate that no such topology can exist.
# The argument proceeds by cases:
#
# 1. If the topology is Hausdorff, the "totally bounded" and "no nontrivial convergent sequences" properties
#    impose contradictory requirements on the set of moduli defining the topology.
#
# 2. If the topology is not Hausdorff, it must have a smallest non-trivial open subgroup, L*Z.
#    In this case, one can always construct a nontrivial sequence (e.g., k*L) that converges to 0.
#
# Since no such topology can be constructed in either case, the number of such topologies is zero.
# Therefore, the code simply needs to output this result.
