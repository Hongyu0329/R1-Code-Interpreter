    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cyclic subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512. A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. This group is part of a family of groups $SD_{2^n}$, where the order is $2^n$. For $SD_{512}$, we have $2^n = 512$, which gives $n = 9$.\n\n2.  **Group Presentation:** The semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has the presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = 1, s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. The group consists of $2^{n-1}=256$ elements of the form $r^i$ and $2^{n-1}=256$ elements of the form $sr^i$.\n\n3.  **Count Cyclic Subgroups:** The number of distinct cyclic subgroups can be calculated by analyzing the orders of the elements and counting the unique subgroups they generate. The total number of cyclic subgroups in $SD_{2^n}$ (for $n \\ge 4$) can be found with the formula:\n    \n    Total Subgroups = $n + 2^{n-2} + 2^{n-3}$\n    \n    This formula is derived as follows:\n    *   **$n$ subgroups:** The maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ has order $2^{n-1}$. A cyclic group of order $p^k$ has $k+1$ subgroups. Here, the order is $2^{n-1}$, so it has $(n-1)+1 = n$ cyclic subgroups. These are the subgroups of orders $1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{n-1}$.\n    *   **$2^{n-2}$ subgroups:** These are additional cyclic subgroups of order 2 generated by elements of the form $sr^i$ where $i$ is even. There are $2^{n-2}$ such elements, and each generates a unique subgroup of order 2.\n    *   **$2^{n-3}$ subgroups:** These are additional cyclic subgroups of order 4. They are generated by elements of the form $sr^i$ where $i$ is odd. There are $2^{n-2}$ such elements, which pair up to generate $2^{n-2} / 2 = 2^{n-3}$ unique subgroups of order 4.\n\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to perform this calculation for $n=9$. The script will determine `n`, calculate each term in the formula, and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the\n    semidihedral group of a given size.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # Step 1: Find the parameter 'n' where the group order is 2^n.\n    # For a semidihedral group of size 512, 2^n = 512.\n    # n = log2(512)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    if n < 4:\n        print(f\"Error: The standard definition of a semidihedral group SD_2^n is for n >= 4.\")\n        print(f\"For size {group_size}, n is {n}.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 2: Use the formula for the number of cyclic subgroups in SD_{2^n}:\n    # Number = n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3)\n    \n    # Calculate each term of the formula\n    term1 = n\n    term2 = 2**(n - 2)\n    term3 = 2**(n - 3)\n\n    # Calculate the total\n    total_subgroups = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n    # Step 3: Print the results, showing the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{{2**n}}, so n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"The number of power (cyclic) subgroups is given by the formula: n + 2^(n-2) + 2^(n-3)\")\n    print(f\"Plugging in n = {n}, the equation becomes:\")\n    print(f\"Number of subgroups = {term1} + {term2} + {term3} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<201>>>"
