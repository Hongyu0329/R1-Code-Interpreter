    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction and generate the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants:** The reaction is between an aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and a phosphonium ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane).\n2.  **Understand the Reaction Mechanism:** The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for creating carbon-carbon double bonds. It involves the reaction of a carbonyl compound (like our aldehyde) with a phosphonium ylide. The oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the triphenylphosphine group from the ylide are replaced, forming a new C=C double bond and triphenylphosphine oxide as a byproduct.\n3.  **Determine the Product Structure:**\n    *   Pivalaldehyde provides the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of the new alkene.\n    *   The ylide provides the `=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)` part.\n    *   Combining these at the double bond gives the final structure: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(C₆H₄Cl)`.\n4.  **Name the Product:** The systematic IUPAC name for this alkene structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be created to programmatically solve this. It will use the `rdkit` library, a standard toolkit for cheminformatics.\n    *   The script will represent the reactants using their SMILES chemical identifiers.\n    *   It will define the general Wittig reaction transformation.\n    *   It will then apply this transformation to the specific reactants to find the product.\n    *   Finally, it will print the name of the reaction product and, as requested, extract and print all the numbers present in the IUPAC name.\n\n```python\nimport re\n# The rdkit library is a standard toolkit for cheminformatics.\n# If you don't have it, you can install it via pip: pip install rdkit\nfrom rdkit import Chem\nfrom rdkit.Chem import AllChem\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function performs a Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and a\n    specified phosphonium ylide, and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the reactants using their SMILES string representations.\n    # Pivalaldehyde: (CH3)3C-CHO\n    pivalaldehyde_smiles = \"CC(C)(C)C=O\"\n    pivalaldehyde_name = \"pivalaldehyde\"\n\n    # Ylide: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\n    # Structure: Ph3P=CH-CH2-(ortho-chlorophenyl)\n    ylide_smiles = \"c1(Cl)ccccc1CC=[P](c2ccccc2)(c3ccccc3)c4ccccc4\"\n    ylide_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    \n    reactants = (Chem.MolFromSmiles(pivalaldehyde_smiles), Chem.MolFromSmiles(ylide_smiles))\n\n    # Step 2: Define the Wittig reaction mechanism using a generic reaction pattern (SMARTS).\n    # This pattern says: find a C=O and a C=P group, and swap the O and C groups.\n    # [C:1]=[O:2] is the aldehyde.
