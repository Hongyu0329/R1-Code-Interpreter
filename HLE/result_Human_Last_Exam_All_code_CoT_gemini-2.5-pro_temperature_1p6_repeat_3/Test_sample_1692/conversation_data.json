    "This is a reverse-engineering problem for a 1D elementary cellular automaton. We are given the state at time `t` and `t+2` and need to find the state at `t+1`. Since there are only 256 possible rules for elementary cellular automata, we can find the solution by brute force.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define a function that can simulate one step of any of the 256 possible cellular automaton rules. This function will take a rule number (0-255) and the current state (a list of 0s and 1s) as input and return the next state. We will assume periodic (wraparound) boundary conditions, which is standard for this type of problem.\n2.  Iterate through every rule from 0 to 255.\n3.  For each rule, perform a two-step simulation:\n    a.  Apply the rule to the known initial state (`01101001`) to generate a candidate for the intermediate state.\n    b.  Apply the same rule again to this candidate intermediate state to generate a candidate for the final state.\n4.  Compare the result from step 3b with the known final state (`10000111`).\n5.  If they match, we have found the correct rule and the corresponding intermediate state. The problem states there is only one valid solution, so we expect to find exactly one match.\n6.  The program will then print the digits of this unique intermediate state.\n\n```python\ndef solve_automaton_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intermediate step in a 2-step elementary cellular automaton evolution\n    by testing all 256 possible rules.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def apply_rule(rule_num, state):\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies an elementary cellular automaton rule to a given state,\n        assuming periodic boundary conditions.\n        \"\"\"\n        # The rule's bits correspond to the output for neighborhoods from 111 down to 000.\n        # We create a map where the index is the integer value of the neighborhood.\n        # E.g., for neighborhood '101' (value 5), the output is the 5th bit of the rule number.\n        rule_map = [(rule_num >> i) & 1 for i in range(8)]\n        \n        n = len(state)\n        next_state = [0] * n\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            # Get neighborhood with periodic (wraparound) boundaries.\n            left = state[(i - 1) % n]\n            center = state[i]\n            right = state[(i + 1) % n]\n            \n            # Convert the 3-cell neighborhood pattern to an integer (0-7).\n            neighborhood_index = (left << 2) | (center << 1) | right\n            \n            # Determine the cell's next state from the rule map.\n            next_state[i] = rule_map[neighborhood_index]\n            \n        return next_state\n\n    # The given states in the sequence.\n    initial_state_str = \"01101001\"\n    final_state_str = \"10000111\"\n    \n    initial_state = [int(c) for c in initial_state_str]\n    final_state = [int(c) for c in final_state_str]\n\n    solutions = []\n\n    # Iterate through all 256 possible elementary rules.\n    for rule_num in range(256):\n        # Step 1: Calculate the intermediate state from the initial state.\n        intermediate_state = apply_rule(rule_num, initial_state)\n        \n        # Step 2: Calculate the final state from the intermediate state.\n        calculated_final_state = apply_rule(rule_num, intermediate_state)\n        \n        # Check if the calculated final state matches the given final state.\n        if calculated_final_state == final_state:\n            solutions.append(intermediate_state)\n\n    # The problem implies a unique solution, so we print the first one found.\n    if solutions:\n        solution_state = solutions[0]\n        # Print each number of the found intermediate state as a single string.\n        print(\"\".join(map(str, solution_state)))\n\n# Execute the solver.\nsolve_automaton_mystery()\n```\n<<<11001100>>>"
