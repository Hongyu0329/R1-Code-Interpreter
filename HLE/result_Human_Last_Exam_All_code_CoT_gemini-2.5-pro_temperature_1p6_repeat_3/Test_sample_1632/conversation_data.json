    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\nThe problem asks for `a(10)`, which is the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice (also known as a Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path on the lattice that starts at an origin and never visits the same point more than once.\n\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved by exhaustively counting all possible valid paths. For a walk length of 10, a computational approach using a recursive backtracking algorithm is efficient enough.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach for the algorithm:\n\n1.  **Define a recursive function:** We'll create a function, let's call it `count_walks`, that calculates the number of valid paths from a given state. This function will take the number of remaining steps, the current position `(x, y)`, and the set of visited points as input.\n\n2.  **Base Case:** The recursion stops when the number of remaining steps is zero. This signifies that we have successfully found one complete self-avoiding walk. In this case, the function returns 1.\n\n3.  **Recursive Step:** From the current position `(x, y)`, we consider moving to each of the four neighbors: `(x+1, y)`, `(x-1, y)`, `(x, y+1)`, and `(x, y-1)`.\n\n4.  **Avoidance Check:** For each potential neighbor, we check if it has already been visited by looking it up in the `path` set.\n\n5.  **Explore:** If the neighbor has not been visited, we \"take\" that step:\n    a. Add the new position to the `path` set.\n    b. Make a recursive call to `count_walks` with the number of steps decremented by one and the new position as the current one.\n    c. Add the result of this recursive call to a running total.\n\n6.  **Backtrack:** After the recursive call returns, we must remove the new position from the `path` set. This \"undoes\" the move, allowing us to explore other paths from the same point. This backtracking step is essential for exploring the entire search space correctly.\n\n7.  **Initial Call:** The process starts by calling the function with 10 steps, an initial position of `(0, 0)`, and a `path` set containing only the origin. The final value returned will be `a(10)`.\n\nThis method systematically explores all possible 10-step paths, pruning any branches that would revisit a point, and counts the total number of valid ones.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_a10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks\n    on a Manhattan (2D square) lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    n = 10  # The number of steps in the walk\n\n    def count_walks(steps, path, x, y):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            steps (int): The number of steps remaining.\n            path (set): A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited coordinates.\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n\n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one valid walk.\n        if steps == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Define the four possible moves: up, down, left, right.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n        # Explore each possible move.\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # Check if the next position has already been visited.\n            if (nx, ny) not in path:\n                # If not visited, take the step.\n                path.add((nx, ny))\n                \n                # Recursively call the function for the path with one less step.\n                count += count_walks(steps - 1, path, nx, ny)\n                \n                # Backtrack: remove the point from the path to explore other possibilities.\n                path.remove((nx, ny))\n        \n        return count\n\n    # The walk starts at the origin (0, 0).\n    start_x, start_y = 0, 0\n    \n    # The initial path contains only the origin.\n    # A set is used for efficient checking of visited points (O(1) average time complexity).\n    initial_path = {(start_x, start_y)}\n\n    # Calculate the total number of walks.\n    result = count_walks(n, initial_path, start_x, start_y)\n    \n    # The final equation is a(10) = result.\n    # We print each number involved in this equation.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_a10()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
