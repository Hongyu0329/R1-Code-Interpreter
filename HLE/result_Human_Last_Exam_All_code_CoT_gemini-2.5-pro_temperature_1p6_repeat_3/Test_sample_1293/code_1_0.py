By ensuring the integrity of the system's software through a secure update mechanism, it establishes a trusted foundation. A trusted system can then reliably execute other security protocols like DNSSEC or DoH to prevent AitM attacks. This approach does not alter the universal DNS protocol, thereby meeting all stated requirements.")
