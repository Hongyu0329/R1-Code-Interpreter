    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of labeled CO2 molecules produced:\n\n1.  **Identify the Labeled Carbons:** The starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means carbon atoms at position 1 (C1) and position 4 (C4) are the ¹³C isotope.\n2.  **Trace Carbons Through Glycolysis Part 1 (Cleavage):**\n    *   Glucose (a 6-carbon molecule) is converted to Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, keeping the labels on C1 and C4.\n    *   Aldolase enzyme cleaves this 6-carbon molecule into two 3-carbon molecules:\n        *   Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which is formed from glucose's C1, C2, and C3. It contains the label from **C1**.\n        *   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which is formed from glucose's C4, C5, and C6. It contains the label from **C4**.\n3.  **Trace Carbons Through Glycolysis Part 2 (Isomerization and Payoff):**\n    *   The DHAP molecule is isomerized into another molecule of G3P. During this conversion, the carbon that was C1 of glucose (and DHAP) becomes **C3** of this new G3P molecule.\n    *   At this point, we have two G3P molecules ready for the final steps:\n        *   One G3P is labeled at its C1 position (from glucose's C4).\n        *   The second G3P is labeled at its C3 position (from glucose's C1).\n    *   These two G3P molecules are then converted into two pyruvate molecules. The carbon skeleton is conserved.\n4.  **Analyze CO2 Production in Glycolysis:** The overall net reaction of glycolysis is the conversion of one glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules. **No CO2 is released during the process of glycolysis itself.** Carbon atoms are only lost in subsequent pathways like the link reaction (pyruvate decarboxylation) or the citric acid cycle.\n\nTherefore, the direct answer to the question is 0.\n\nThe following Python code simulates this process to provide a clear, step-by-step breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef trace_glycolysis_co2():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces a 1,4-13C glucose molecule through glycolysis to determine\n    how many 13C-labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In 1,4-13C glucose, carbons C1 and C4 are labeled.\n    # We represent the 6-carbon chain of glucose and its labeling.\n    # '13C' indicates a labeled carbon, '12C' is an unlabeled carbon.\n    glucose = {1: '13C', 2: '12C', 3: '12C', 4: '13C', 5: '12C', 6: '12C'}\n\n    print(\"--- Tracing 1,4-13C Glucose Through Glycolysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Initial Glucose Labeling: C1 is {glucose[1]}, C4 is {glucose[4]}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Cleavage into two 3-carbon molecules.\n    # DHAP is formed from glucose carbons 1, 2, 3.\n    # G3P (Molecule A) is formed from glucose carbons 4, 5, 6.\n    # We map the labels accordingly.
