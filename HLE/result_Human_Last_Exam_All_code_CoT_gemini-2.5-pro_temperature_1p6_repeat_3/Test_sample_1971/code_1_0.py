# R is the constant Ricci scalar curvature

R, kappa_sq = sympy.symbols('R kappa^2')

# Step 1: Determine alpha^2
# From the analysis of the AdS vacuum and the Killing spinor equation,
# we derived the relation: kappa^2 * alpha^2 = R / 3.
alpha_sq_expr = R / (3 * kappa_sq)
alpha_sq_coeff = alpha_sq_expr / (R / kappa_sq)

# Step 2: Determine beta
# From the requirement that the super-cosmological constant term is separately
# invariant under supersymmetry, focusing on terms linear in the auxiliary field S,
# we derived the equation: 1/2 - 1/4 + beta = 0.
beta = -1/4
