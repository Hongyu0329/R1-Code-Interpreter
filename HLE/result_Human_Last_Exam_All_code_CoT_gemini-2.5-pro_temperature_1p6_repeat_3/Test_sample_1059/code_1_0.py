    This function determines which of the given sets are necessarily 'closepact'.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The property 'closepact' for the given spaces (subspaces of R or C) is equivalent to the property 'compact'.
    2. We analyze each option to see if it describes a necessarily compact set.
    3. A subset of the real or complex numbers is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.

    Analysis:
    A. R: Not compact (unbounded).
    B. Z: Not compact (unbounded).
    C. Finite set: Compact (closed and bounded).
    D. {1/n}: Not compact (not closed).
    E. {Cauchy sequence in Q}: Not necessarily compact (may not be complete/closed).
    F. {Bounded monotonic sequence}: Not necessarily compact (may not contain its limit, so not closed).
    G. {Bounded monotonic sequence + limit}: Compact (closed and bounded).
    H. {Positive sequence + limit}: Compact (convergent sequence + limit is closed and bounded).
    I. Open interval: Not compact (not closed).
    J. Closed interval: Compact (closed and bounded).
    K. Bounded measurable set: Not necessarily compact (may not be closed).
    L. Bounded non-measurable set: Not necessarily compact (may not be closed).
    M. Cantor set: Compact (closed and bounded).

    The letters corresponding to the compact sets are C, G, H, J, M.
