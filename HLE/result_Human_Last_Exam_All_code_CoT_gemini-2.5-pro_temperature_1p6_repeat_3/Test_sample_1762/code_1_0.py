# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for a space X with specific properties.

# Step 1: Deduce the topological type of X.
# The space X is defined with the following properties:
# 1. It is a metric space (and therefore Hausdorff).
# 2. It is locally compact.
# 3. It is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R.
#
# A key theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection from a sigma-compact,
# locally compact, Hausdorff space to another locally compact, Hausdorff space is
# a homeomorphism. The real line R is sigma-compact (as it's a countable union of
# compact intervals, e.g., R = U [-n, n]), locally compact, and Hausdorff.
# The space X is given as locally compact and metric, hence it is also Hausdorff.
# Therefore, the one-to-one continuous map from R to X must be a homeomorphism.
# This means that any space X satisfying these conditions must be topologically
# identical (homeomorphic) to the real line R.

# Step 2: Check if R satisfies the remaining property.
# Since any such space X must be in the same homeomorphism class as R, we just need
# to check if R itself satisfies the final property. If it does, then there is
# exactly one such class. If it doesn't, there are zero.
#
# The property: For each pair of distinct points x, y in X, there exists a
# closed connected set K such that x is in the interior of K (Int(K)) and
# K is a subset of X \ {y} (i.e., y is not in K).
#
# Let's verify this for X = R. In R, the closed and connected sets are the
# closed intervals [a, b], closed rays like [a, infinity), and R itself.
#
# Consider two distinct points, x and y.
#
# Case 1: x < y
# We need to find a closed interval K = [a, b] such that:
#   a) a < x < b  (so x is in the interior of K)
#   b) y is not in [a, b]
# Let's choose b to be the midpoint between x and y. So, b = (x + y) / 2.
# For a, we can choose any value less than x, for instance, a = x - 1.
# So, we propose K = [x - 1, (x + y) / 2].
#   a) Is x in the interior (x - 1, (x + y) / 2)? Yes, because x - 1 < x and
#      x < (x + y) / 2 (which simplifies to x < y, our initial assumption).
#   b) Is y outside of K? Yes, because y > (x + y) / 2.
# So the property holds.
#
# Case 2: x > y
# Similarly, we can choose a = (y + x) / 2 and b = x + 1.
# K = [(y + x) / 2, x + 1].
#   a) x is in the interior ((y + x) / 2, x + 1).
#   b) y is outside of K.
# The property holds in this case as well.

# Step 3: Conclude the number of classes.
# We have shown that any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to R.
# We have also shown that R itself satisfies all the given properties.
# Therefore, there is exactly one such homeomorphism class.
