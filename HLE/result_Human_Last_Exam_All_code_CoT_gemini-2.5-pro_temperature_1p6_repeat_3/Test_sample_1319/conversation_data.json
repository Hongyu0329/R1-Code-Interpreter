    "Here is my plan to identify the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, other than Mount Olympus.\n\n1.  **Identify Key Mountains:** First, I will compile a list of prominent mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus as per the user's request. These include Mount Athos, Mount Ida (in the Troad, near Troy), and Mount Samothrace.\n2.  **Gather Elevation Data:** Next, I will find the official elevation (in meters) for each of these historical mountains.\n3.  **Implement a Python Script:** I will write a Python script to perform the following:\n    *   Store the mountains and their elevations in a dictionary.\n    *   Iterate through the dictionary to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n    *   Print the final result, displaying an \"equation\" that shows the comparison of the mountain heights to find the maximum.\n    *   State the name of the tallest mountain and its elevation.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    # A dictionary of historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad (excluding Olympus) and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida (Troad)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624\n    }\n\n    # Find the mountain with the maximum elevation\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    # Create the equation string\n    # The user wants to see each number in the final equation.\n    heights = [str(h) for h in mountains.values()]\n    equation = f\"max({', '.join(heights)}) = {tallest_mountain_height}\"\n    \n    print(\"Finding the tallest mountain mentioned in the Iliad (after Mount Olympus):\")\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height}m\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe comparison equation is:\")\n    print(equation)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
