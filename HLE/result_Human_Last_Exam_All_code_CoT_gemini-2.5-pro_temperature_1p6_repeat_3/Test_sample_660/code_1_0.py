    # 1. Define example parameters t, p, F that satisfy the problem's constraints.
    #    - t, p, F are decreasing functions.
    #    - Crucially, they must satisfy the sorting condition: t(0) - t(1) + p(1)*F(0) < 0.
    #    - This implies F(0) must be a negative value (a reward, not a penalty).
    # 2. Calculate the costs for each firm type (theta=0, theta=1) with each auditor type (x=0, x=1).
    # 3. Determine the preferences based on these costs.
    # 4. Identify and output the set of theta values that prefer lenient auditors.

    F = [-110, -120] # F[0] = -110, so the condition holds. F is decreasing F[0] > F[1].
