    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state solution of the given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations. At steady state, as time $t$ approaches infinity, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. When the probabilities are constant, their time derivatives are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$.\n\nThis transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations. We can solve this system to find the values of $\\pi_i$.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Set the derivatives in the system of equations to zero to get the steady-state equations.\n2.  Use the algebraic relationships and the normalization condition ($\\pi_0 + \\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$) to form a solvable system for the unknown probabilities $\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$.\n3.  Solve for the probabilities. Specifically, we will find expressions for $\\pi_0, \\pi_2, \\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_1$.\n4.  Substitute these into the normalization equation to solve for $\\pi_1$.\n5.  Calculate $\\pi_0$ using the value of $\\pi_1$.\n6.  Finally, compute the desired sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, showing the derivation with the given numerical values and printing the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_markov_chain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the steady-state probabilities for the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system\n    and calculates P0(+inf) + P1(+inf).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the given transition rates (lambda values).\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # Step 2: At steady state (t -> +inf), P_i'(t) = 0.
