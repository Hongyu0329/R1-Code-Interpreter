# The GDScript code has an error on line 4: `if "texture" in list(json_data):`
# The problem is the use of `list(json_data)`. While in Python this would convert the dictionary keys to a list,
# GDScript does not have a built-in global `list()` function.
# The Godot engine's parser will try to find a function or variable named "list" and will fail.
# This results in a specific parse error.
# The correct GDScript syntax to check for the key would be `if json_data.has("texture"):` or simply `if "texture" in json_data:`.
# The following code prints the exact error message that the Godot 4.3 IDE would display for this issue.

print("Parse Error: The identifier \"list\" isn't declared in the current scope.")
