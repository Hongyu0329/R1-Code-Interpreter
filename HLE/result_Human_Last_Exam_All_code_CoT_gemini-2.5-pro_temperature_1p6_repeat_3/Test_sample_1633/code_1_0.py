    # It starts as a k0-regular lattice, then rewires some edges.

    # --- Analysis as presented in the thinking steps ---
    
    # 1. The goal is to transform G from L(G) ~ log(n) to L(G) ~ log(log(n)).
    # This requires building a hierarchical structure.

    # 2. Building a hierarchy with constant total edges means creating high-degree
    # 'hubs' by reducing the degree of other 'leaf' nodes.
    # Initial degree is 6 for all nodes.
    # Final min_degree is 3. Max degree is ceil(log(n)).

    # 3. The cost m(n) is the number of rewiring operations. Each operation
    # allows for a total of 2 degree changes (one node loses a degree, another
    # gains one, or two nodes lose, two nodes gain, etc.).
    # Total degree change = 2 * m(n).

    # 4. The argument for option (H) is based on the required scale of this change.
    # To get the "degree budget" to create hubs up to degree log(n), a substantial
    # fraction of nodes must have their degree lowered from 6 towards 3.
    # The statement in (H) is that the number of rewiring operations that
    # remove an edge from the original lattice structure is at least n/6.
    
    # Let's say we need to convert N_l nodes into low-degree nodes (degree ~3).
    # This requires a degree reduction of about 3 * N_l.
    # This must equal the degree increase for hubs. 2 * m(n) >= 3 * N_l.
    # If the structural change requires, say, N_l >= n/9 nodes to be repurposed,
    # then m(n) >= 1.5 * (n/9) = n/6. This makes the claim in (H) plausible.
    # These removals must primarily come from the lattice to free up local nodes.
