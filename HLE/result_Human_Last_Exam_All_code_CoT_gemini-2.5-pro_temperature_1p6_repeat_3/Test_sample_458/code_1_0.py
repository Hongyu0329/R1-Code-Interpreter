# The species expected to have reduced pterostigmata are those known for
# long-distance migration and a gliding or soaring flight style.
# This morphological trait is an adaptation for flight efficiency.
#
# Based on documented ecological behaviors, the following species fit this profile:
#
# - Index 3: Macrodiplax balteata (Wandering Pennant) is a strong migrant and glider.
# - Index 4: Pantala flavescens (Globe Skimmer) is the archetypal global migrant that relies on gliding.
# - Index 10: Tholymis tillarga (Coral-tailed Cloudwing) is another well-known migrant that soars extensively.
#
# The script will now print the indices of these species.
