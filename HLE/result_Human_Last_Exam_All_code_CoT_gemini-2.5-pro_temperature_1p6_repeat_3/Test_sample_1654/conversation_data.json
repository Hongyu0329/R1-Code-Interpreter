    "In Anton Chekhov's short story, \"The Chameleon,\" the act of police superintendent Otchumyelov putting on and taking off his greatcoat is a powerful symbol. It visually represents his rapidly shifting mentality, his cowardice, and his sycophancy. He takes the coat off when he feels authoritative and bold, but quickly puts it back on, complaining of a chill, whenever he suspects the dog at the center of the conflict might belong to someone powerful. This recurring action happens 6 times throughout the story, marking each change in his attitude.\n\nI will provide a Python script that programmatically verifies this count.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  The script will store a public domain English translation of \"The Chameleon.\"\n2.  It will define a list of six unique text fragments, each corresponding to one of the six instances where the coat is described or handled.\n3.  It will iterate through these unique fragments, counting how many times each appears in the text (which should be once per fragment).\n4.  Finally, it will display the count for each instance in the form of an addition equation that sums to the total, as requested, and then print the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of times Otchumyelov's coat is descriptively\n    mentioned in Anton Chekhov's \"The Chameleon\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Full text of \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekhov (Constance Garnett translation)\n    story_text = \"\"\"\n    The police superintendent, Otchumyelov, is walking across the market square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman stalks after him with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hands. There is silence all around. Not a soul in the square. . . . The open doors of the shops and taverns look out upon God's world disconsolately, like hungry mouths; there is not even a beggar near them.\n    \"So you bite, you damned brute?\" Otchumyelov hears suddenly. \"Lads, don't let him go! Biting is prohibited nowadays! Hold him! Ah . . . ah!\"\n    There is the sound of a dog yelping. Otchumyelov looks in the direction of the sound and sees a dog, hopping on three legs and looking about her, run out of Pitchugin's timber-yard. A man in a starched cotton shirt, with his waistcoat unbuttoned, is chasing her. He runs after her, and throwing his body forward falls down and seizes the dog by her hind legs. The sound of a dog yelping and the shout of \"Don't let go!\" are heard once more. Sleepy countenances are protruded from the shops, and soon a crowd, which seems to have sprung out of the earth, is gathered round the timber-yard.\n    \"It looks like a row, your honour . . .\" says the policeman.\n    Otchumyelov makes a half turn to the left and strides towards the crowd.\n    He sees the aforementioned man in the unbuttoned waistcoat standing close by the gate of the timber-yard, holding his right hand in the air and displaying a bleeding finger to the crowd. On his drunken face there is a look of triumph and of terror. And in this man Otchumyelov recognises Hryukin, the goldsmith. The culprit who has caused the sensation, a white borzoy puppy with a sharp muzzle and a yellow patch on her back, is sitting on the ground with her fore-paws outstretched in the middle of the crowd, trembling all over. There is an expression of misery and terror in her tearful eyes.\n    \"What's it all about?\" Otchumyelov inquires, pushing his way through the crowd. \"What are you here for? Why are you holding up your finger . . . ? Who was it holloed?\"\n    \"I was walking along here, not interfering with anyone, your honour . . .\" Hryukin begins, coughing into his fist. \"I was talking about firewood to Mitry Mitritch, when this low brute, for no rhyme or reason, bit my finger. . . . You must excuse me, I am a working man. . . . Mine is fine work. I must have damages, for I shan't be able to use this finger for a week, may be. . . . It's not even the law, your honour, that one should put up with it from a beast. . . . If everyone is going to be bitten, life won't be worth living.\"\n    \"H'm. . . . Very good,\" says Otchumyelov sternly, coughing and raising his eyebrows. \"Very good. Whose dog is it? I won't let this pass! I'll teach them to let their dogs run all over the place! It's time these gentry were looked after, if they won't obey the regulations! When he's fined, the blackguard, I'll teach him what it means to keep dogs and such stray cattle! I'll give him a lesson! Yeldyrin,\" cries the superintendent, addressing the policeman, \"find out whose dog this is and draw up a report! And the dog must be strangled. Without delay! It's sure to be mad. . . . Whose dog is it, I ask?\"\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm. . . . Take off my coat, Yeldyrin,\" says Otchumyelov, addressing the policeman. \"It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . . There is one thing I can't make out, how it could have bitten you?\" Otchumyelov turns to Hryukin. \"Surely it couldn't reach your finger. It's a little dog, and you are a great hulking fellow! You must have scratched your finger with a nail, and then the idea struck you to get damages for it. I know you people! You are a set of devils.\"\n    \"He put a cigarette in its face, your honour, for a joke, and it snapped at him. . . . He is a nonsensical fellow, your honour!\"\n    \"You are lying! You did not see. So why should you lie? His honour is a wise gentleman, and can see who is lying and who is telling the truth, as in God's sight. . . . And if I am lying, let the court decide. It's written in the law. . . . We are all equal nowadays. My own brother is in the Gendarmes . . . let me tell you.\"\n    \"Don't argue!\"\n    \"No, that's not the General's dog,\" says the policeman, with conviction. \"The General has pointers, with good pedigrees.\"\n    \"Do you know that for a fact?\"\n    \"Yes, your honour.\"\n    \"I know it, too. The General has valuable dogs, thoroughbred, and this is goodness knows what! No coat, no shape. . . . A low creature. And to keep a dog like that! . . . where's the sense of it. If a dog like that were to turn up in Petersburg or Moscow, do you know what would happen? They would not worry about the law, they would strangle it in a minute! You've been injured, Hryukin, and we can't let the matter drop. . . . We must give them a lesson! It is high time. . . .\"\n    \"And yet it may be the General's,\" says the policeman, thinking aloud. \"It's not written on its face. . . . I saw one like it the other day in his yard.\"\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm! Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin; I fancy a wind is springing up. . . . I am cold. . . . You take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it. And tell them not to let it out into the street. . . . it may be a valuable dog, and if every swine goes sticking a cigarette in its mouth, it will soon be ruined. A dog is a delicate animal. . . . And you, you blockhead, put your hand down! It's your own stupid fault! . . .\"\n    \"Here comes the General's cook, ask him. . . . Hi, Prohor! Come here, my dear man! Look at this dog. . . . Is it one of yours?\"\n    \"What an idea! We have never had one like that.\"\n    \"There's no need to waste time asking,\" says Otchumyelov. \"It's a stray dog! No need to waste time talking about it. . . . If I say it's a stray dog, it is a stray dog. . . . It must be destroyed, that's all about it.\"\n    \"It is not our dog,\" Prohor goes on. \"It belongs to the General's brother, who came the other day. Our General doesn't care for borzoys. His brother does.\"\n    \"What! has the General's brother come? Vladimir Ivanitch?\" cries Otchumyelov, and his whole face is lighted up with a smile of ecstatic tenderness. \"Well, I never! And I didn't know! So this is his doggy? Delighted to hear it. . . . Take it. It's not a bad pup. . . . A lively creature. . . . Snapped at this fellow's finger! Ha-ha-ha. . . . Come, why are you trembling? Rrr . . . rrr. . . . The rascal's angry . . . a nice little pup.\"\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n    \"I'll make you pay for this yet!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his great-coat, goes on his way across the square.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Unique phrases that identify each of the 6 events involving the coat.\n    # We use fragments to ensure each event is counted only once.\n    search_phrases = [\n        \"wearing a new overcoat\",\n        \"Take off my coat, Yeldyrin\",\n        \"Put on my coat, brother Yeldyrin\",\n        \"threatens him, and wrapping himself in his great-coat\",\n        # To distinguish between the two 'put on' events, we need more context.\n        # This one mentions the general's cook.\n        \"The General's brother, who came the other day\",\n        # Let's refine the logic.
