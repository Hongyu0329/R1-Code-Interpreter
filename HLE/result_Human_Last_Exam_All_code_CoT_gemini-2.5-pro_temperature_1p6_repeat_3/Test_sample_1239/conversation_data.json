    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem.\n\nFirst, I will identify the different types of continuous symmetries that the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions possess. These symmetries form the basis of the Lie group. The dimension of a Lie group is the number of independent parameters required to specify a transformation within that group.\n\nThe symmetries are:\n1.  **Time translations:** The laws of physics do not depend on when the experiment starts. This gives 1 dimension.\n2.  **Space translations:** The laws of physics are the same everywhere in space. Since we are in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, this gives 3 dimensions.\n3.  **Rotations:** The laws of physics are isotropic (the same in all directions). The group of rotations in 3D space, SO(3), has 3 dimensions.\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** These relate the system to a frame of reference moving at a constant velocity. Since velocity is a 3D vector, this gives 3 dimensions.\n5.  **Scaling transformations:** The equations are invariant under a specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure. This is a one-parameter group of transformations, adding 1 dimension.\n6.  **Pressure shifts:** The pressure term appears as a gradient in the equation, so adding a constant value to the pressure field does not change the physics. This adds 1 dimension.\n\nThe total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry transformations. I will write a Python script to list these components and sum their dimensions to get the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries for the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by summing the dimensions\n    of its known symmetry subgroups.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Dimensions of the various symmetry subgroups\n    time_translation = 1\n    space_translations = 3\n    rotations = 3\n    galilean_boosts = 3\n    scaling_transformations = 1\n    pressure_shifts = 1\n    \n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translations\": time_translation,\n        \"Space translations\": space_translations,\n        \"Rotations\": rotations,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": galilean_boosts,\n        \"Scaling transformations\": scaling_transformations,\n        \"Pressure shifts\": pressure_shifts\n    }\n    \n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of its component symmetries:\")\n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim}\")\n        \n    total_dimension = sum(symmetries.values())\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    dimension_values = list(symmetries.values())\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, dimension_values))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
