    print("Binding Theory governs how noun phrases are interpreted. A broad interpretation includes:")
    print(" - Principle A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself') must be bound locally.")
    print(" - Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'she') must be free locally.")
    print(" - Principle C: An R-expression (e.g., 'Mary') must be free everywhere.")
    print(" - Empty Category Principle (ECP): A trace (the 'gap' left by a moved element) must be properly governed. This governs 'filler-gap' binding.")

    print("Sentence: She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.")
    print("Analysis: The R-expression 'Mary_i' is c-commanded by the co-indexed pronoun 'She_i'.")

    print("Result: Sentence B is UNGRAMMATICAL due to a principle governing trace binding.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Analyzing Sentence C")
    print("------------------------------------------")
    print("Sentence: Who does John like Mary and?")
    print("Analysis: This sentence is formed by moving 'Who' out of the coordinate structure 'Mary and who'.")
    print("This movement violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint.")
    print("From a binding perspective, the trace left by 'Who' ('t_i' in 'Mary and t_i') is not properly governed because it is inside an island, violating the ECP.")

    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("------------------------------------------")
    print("All three sentences are ungrammatical due to violations of binding principles (interpreted broadly):")
    print("  A -> Violates Principle C.")
    print("  B -> Violates the ECP.")
