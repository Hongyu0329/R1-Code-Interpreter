    Calculates how much greater the extinction rate for a morphospecies
    is compared to the extinction rate for an evolutionary species based on
    a set of simplifying assumptions derived from the problem description.

    The logic is as follows:
    1. Let mu_true be the rate of true biological extinction of a lineage.
       The extinction rate for an evolutionary species (mu_e) is exactly this.
       mu_e = mu_true

    2. The extinction rate for a morphospecies (mu_m) includes true extinction
       plus pseudo-extinction from taxonomic changes.
       The problem describes two sources of pseudo-extinction:
       a) Anagenesis (rate lambda_anagenesis): A -> B.
       b) Bifurcating speciation: A -> B + C. This happens with 50% probability
          during a branching event (which occurs at rate lambda_branch).
          So, the rate of pseudo-extinction from bifurcation is 0.5 * lambda_branch.
       Therefore, mu_m = mu_true + lambda_anagenesis + 0.5 * lambda_branch.

    3. To get a single numerical answer, we make two simplifying assumptions:
       a) The rate of anagenesis is not quantified, only mentioned as "sometimes".
          We assume it is negligible for this calculation, so lambda_anagenesis = 0.
       b) To resolve the remaining ratio of lambda_branch / mu_true, we assume
          the system is in equilibrium, where the rate of speciation equals the
          rate of extinction. So, lambda_branch = mu_true.

    4. With these assumptions, the ratio mu_m / mu_e can be calculated.

    # We can use normalized rates for the calculation.
    # Assume the system is in equilibrium (speciation rate = extinction rate).
    # Let's set the true extinction rate to a reference value of 1.
    mu_true = 1.0
    # Because of the equilibrium assumption, the branching speciation rate is also 1.
    lambda_branch = 1.0

    # The extinction rate for an evolutionary species is the true extinction rate.

    # and all sources of pseudo-extinction.
