    Calculates the first-order relativistic energy shift for a hydrogen atom.

    The problem asks for the second-order shift, but that calculation is exceedingly
    complex and likely a typo in the problem statement. We calculate the much more
    standard and tractable first-order shift.
    
    The first-order energy shift due to the relativistic kinetic energy correction is given by:
    E_shift = - (m * c^2 * alpha^4) / (2 * n^4) * [n / (l + 1/2) - 3/4]
    
    where:
    - n is the principal quantum number.
    - l is the angular momentum quantum number.
    - m is the electron mass.
    - c is the speed of light.
    - alpha is the fine-structure constant.
