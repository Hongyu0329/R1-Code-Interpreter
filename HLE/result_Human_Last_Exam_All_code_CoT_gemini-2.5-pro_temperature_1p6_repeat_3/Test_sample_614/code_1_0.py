# Based on the riddle, let's determine the sequence of the five numbers.
# There are 5 positions to fill: [_, _, _, _, _]

# Clue: "the fifth, who never had a thing and lastly follows."
# This is the most direct clue. The number 5 is in the last (5th) position.
# Sequence: [_, _, _, _, 5]

# Clue: "Number three is the strongest and it protects the last;"
# This means number 3 comes directly before the last number (5).
# Sequence: [_, _, _, 3, 5]

# Clue: "Number 4 likes two the most and it always goes behind."
# This tells us that number 4 always comes immediately after number 2.
# This gives us a block of two numbers: [2, 4]

# Now, we place the [2, 4] block into the remaining empty slots.
# The only place it fits is at the beginning.
# Sequence: [2, 4, _, 3, 5]

# The only number left to place is 1, and there is only one empty slot.
# So, number 1 goes into the middle position.
# Final Sequence: [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]

# The code will now print the final sequence.
print(2, 4, 1, 3, 5)
