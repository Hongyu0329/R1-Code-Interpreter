# The problem is to find the largest integer n such that d(C_n) <= 100,
# where d(G) is the size of a minimal generating set for a group G.

# Step 1: Deconstruct the group C_n and find d(C_n).
# C_n is the free product of 50 copies of B_n.
# By Grushko's Theorem, the minimal number of generators of a free product is the sum of the
# minimal numbers of generators of its factors.
# So, d(C_n) = d(B_n) + d(B_n) + ... (50 times) = 50 * d(B_n).

# Step 2: Use the given inequality d(C_n) <= 100.
# Substituting the expression for d(C_n), we get:
# 50 * d(B_n) <= 100
# which simplifies to:
# d(B_n) <= 2

# Step 3: Analyze the group B_n and find a lower bound for d(B_n).
# B_n is the n-th direct power of the alternating group A = A_5.
# B_n = A^n = A_5^n
# It's a known property that the alternating group A_5 can be generated by 2 elements, so d(A_5) = 2.
# Since A_5 is a homomorphic image of A_5^n (via projection onto a component),
# it must be that d(A_5^n) >= d(A_5).
# Therefore, d(B_n) >= 2.

# Step 4: Determine the exact value of d(B_n).
# From steps 2 and 3, we have d(B_n) <= 2 and d(B_n) >= 2.
# This forces the equality:
# d(B_n) = 2
# So, the problem is now to find the largest n such that d(A_5^n) = 2.

# Step 5: Find the largest n for which d(A_5^n) = 2.
# A theorem in group theory states that for a non-abelian finite simple group S, the direct power S^n
# can be generated by d(S) elements if and only if n is at most the number of orbits of the
# automorphism group Aut(S) on the set of generating d(S)-tuples of S.
# Here, S = A_5, and d(S) = 2.
# The number of orbits is given by: (Number of generating pairs of A_5) / |Aut(A_5)|.

# The number of generating pairs of A_5 is a known quantity, phi_2(A_5).
num_generating_pairs = 1920

# The automorphism group of A_5 is the symmetric group S_5. Its order is 5!.
size_aut_A5 = 120

# Calculate the largest n.
n = num_generating_pairs / size_aut_A5
