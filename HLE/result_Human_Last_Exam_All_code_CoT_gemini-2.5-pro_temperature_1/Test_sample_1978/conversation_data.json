    "To find the index of the considered boundary-value problem, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the order of the system (n):** The problem is described by the equation `x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)`. The dimensions of the matrix `A` (`202000 x 202000`) and the vector `I(t)` (`202000` components) dictate the number of differential equations in the system. For the equation to be dimensionally consistent, the vector `x(t)` must also have `202000` components. Thus, the order of the system is `n = 202000`.\n\n2.  **Count the independent boundary conditions (l):** The problem provides six boundary conditions. We need to check for linear independence.\n    *   `x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0`\n    *   `x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0`\n    *   `5x_2(T) - 5x_2(0) = 0` is `5 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, which is redundant with the second condition.\n    *   `100x_2(T) - 100x_2(0) = 0` is `100 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, also redundant.\n    *   `1000x_2(0) - 1000x_2(T) = 0` is `-1000 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0`, also redundant.\n    *   `100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0` simplifies to `x_{2024}(T) - x_{2024}(0) = 0`.\n\n    The unique, independent conditions are for `x_1`, `x_2`, and `x_{2024}`. Therefore, there are `l = 3` independent boundary conditions.\n\n3.  **Calculate the index:** The index of a boundary-value problem is defined as the number of differential equations (`n`) minus the number of independent boundary conditions (`l`).\n\n    Index = `n - l`\n\nI will now write a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the number of differential equations (n).\n    # This is given by the dimension of the matrix A.\n    n = 202000\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (l).\n    # The conditions provided are:\n    # 1. x_1(T) - x_1(0) = 0\n    # 2. x_2(T) - x_2(0) = 0\n    # 3. 5 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n    # 4. 100 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n    # 5. -1000 * (x_2(T) - x_2(0)) = 0 (redundant)\n    # 6. 100 * (x_2024(T) - x_2024(0)) = 0 (independent)\n    # The independent conditions are on x_1, x_2, and x_2024.\n    l = 3\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the index of the problem as n - l.\n    index = n - l\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(\"The index of the problem is the number of equations (n) minus the number of independent boundary conditions (l).\")\n    print(f\"Number of equations (n): {n}\")\n    print(f\"Number of independent boundary conditions (l): {l}\")\n    print(f\"Index = {n} - {l} = {index}\")\n\nsolve_problem_index()\n```\n<<<201997>>>"
