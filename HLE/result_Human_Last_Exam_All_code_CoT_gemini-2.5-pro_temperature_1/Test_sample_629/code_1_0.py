    Calculates the number of orbits (equivalence classes) for the minimal grid
    diagrams of the left-hand trefoil knot under 90-degree rotation.

    The problem reduces to counting the cycles in a permutation.
    There are 6 minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot.
    Let's label them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

    According to the literature (Dye, Kaestner, Kauffman), the action of a
    90-degree rotation on this set of 6 diagrams results in the
    following permutation:
    - Diagram 1 is swapped with Diagram 4.
    - Diagram 2 is swapped with Diagram 3.
    - Diagram 5 is swapped with Diagram 6.
