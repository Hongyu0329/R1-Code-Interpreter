    "In a dance scene, the primary driver of action, emotion, and rhythm is the music. The choreography is built upon it. Sound effects, such as footsteps or the rustle of clothing, add a layer of texture and realism but are secondary to the musical score. Speech or dialogue is typically the least important element, as the storytelling is conveyed through movement and music; dialogue can often be distracting or is completely absent during the core dance sequence.\n\n<<<Music, Sound Effects, Speech>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
