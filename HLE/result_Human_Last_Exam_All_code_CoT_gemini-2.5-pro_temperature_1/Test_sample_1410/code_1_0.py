# The puzzle is to find the number of moves for White to win.
# The winning sequence is a forced checkmate in 3 moves.

# Move 1: White plays Qxf7+, Black is forced to respond with Kh7.
print("1. Qxf7+ Kh7")

# Move 2: White plays Qxe8+, Black is forced to respond with Nxe8.
print("2. Qxe8+ Nxe8")

# Move 3: White plays Nf7, which is checkmate.
print("3. Nf7#")

# The total number of moves for White to win is 3.
# The final equation shows the sum of moves leading to the win.
