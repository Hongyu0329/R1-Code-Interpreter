    "As an AI, I cannot visually analyze a video to count dance moves. This task requires watching a specific recording of the 2015 Semperoper Ballett performance, identifying the dancer Svetlana Gileva during the \"Jete Woman\" solo, and then counting every instance of a \"pas de Balanchine,\" which is a subjective task even for a dance expert.\n\nTherefore, I will provide a script that explains this limitation. The script will set the number of identifiable steps to 0, as I cannot \"watch\" the performance. It will then use this to form the requested equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's query by explaining the technical limitations\n    and providing a logical answer based on those constraints.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the query\n    dancer = \"Svetlana Gileva\"\n    performance = \"Jete Woman solo in 'In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated' (2015)\"\n    move_to_count = \"pas de Balanchine\"\n\n    # Explain the core problem\n    print(f\"Query: Count the number of '{move_to_count}' moves performed by {dancer} in the {performance}.\")\n    print(\"\\nAnalysis:\")\n    print(\"1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
