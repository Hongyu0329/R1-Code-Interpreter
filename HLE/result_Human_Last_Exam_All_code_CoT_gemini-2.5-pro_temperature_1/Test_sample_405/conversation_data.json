    "To determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus, we will follow these steps:\n1.  Identify the main, well-characterized allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  List the distinct color associated with each allotrope. Note that some allotropes may be referred to by more than one color (e.g., white phosphorus turning yellow).\n3.  Sum the number of unique colors from the list.\n\nThe primary allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** Appears as a white waxy solid, but upon exposure to light, it converts to the more stable red form, giving it a **yellow** appearance. Thus, it is associated with both **white** and yellow.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous or crystalline polymer that is **red** in color.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):** A crystalline polymer that is **violet** or purple.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, similar in appearance and structure to graphite, and is **black**.\n\nCounting these distinct colors (white, yellow, red, violet, black) gives us the total. The following Python code will formalize this counting process.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of distinct colors observed\n    in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus is often called yellow phosphorus as it turns yellow in light.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White/Yellow Phosphorus\": [\"white\", \"yellow\"],\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": [\"red\"],\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": [\"violet\"],\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": [\"black\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"Calculating the number of observable colors in pure phosphorus allotropes.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    all_colors = []\n    equation_parts = []\n\n    # Iterate through the allotropes to gather colors and explain the count.\n    for allotrope, colors in allotropes.items():\n        count = len(colors)\n        print(f\"{allotrope}: Contributes {count} color(s) ({', '.join(colors)})\")\n        all_colors.extend(colors)\n        equation_parts.append(str(count))\n\n    # Using a set to find the number of unique colors.\n    unique_colors = set(all_colors)\n    total_unique_colors = len(unique_colors)\n\n    # Building and printing the final equation as requested.\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"The final calculation is based on the number of colors from each category:\")\n    print(f\"{final_equation} = {total_unique_colors}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"There are a total of {total_unique_colors} distinct colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
