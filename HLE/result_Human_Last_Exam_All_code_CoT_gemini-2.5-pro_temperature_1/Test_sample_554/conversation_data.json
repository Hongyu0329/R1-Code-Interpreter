    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to define the structure of a standard \"nanocar.\" The term \"nanocar\" typically refers to a class of molecules synthesized by the group of Professor James Tour, which are designed to resemble macroscopic cars.\n\nI will base this calculation on the chassis and axle structure of the original, most iconic nanocar.\n\n1.  **Identify the Parent Molecule:** The hydrocarbon-based chassis and axle assembly of the first nanocar has the chemical formula C₃₈H₁₈. It consists of a central aromatic body with four axle arms.\n2.  **Understand the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix:** In chemical nomenclature, the prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the parent molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n3.  **Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms:** Since the parent nanocar structure has 18 hydrogen atoms, a \"perfluoronanocar\" would have all 18 of these hydrogens replaced by 18 fluorine atoms. The resulting chemical formula would be C₃₈F₁₈.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this result.\n\n```python\n# Define the chemical formula of the parent hydrocarbon nanocar chassis.\n# This is a well-documented structure from chemical literature.\nnum_carbons_chassis = 38\nnum_hydrogens_chassis = 18\n\n# The prefix \"perfluoro-\" indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version\n# is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original version.\nnum_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogens_chassis\n\n# Print the explanation and the final result.\nprint(f\"The chemical formula for a representative hydrocarbon nanocar chassis is C{num_carbons_chassis}H{num_hydrogens_chassis}.\")\nprint(\"The 'perfluoro-' prefix means all hydrogen atoms are replaced with fluorine atoms.\")\nprint(f\"The number of hydrogen atoms to be replaced is {num_hydrogens_chassis}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar (C{num_carbons_chassis}F{num_fluorine_atoms}) would contain {num_fluorine_atoms} fluorine atoms.\")\n\n```\n<<<18>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
