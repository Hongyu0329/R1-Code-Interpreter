# Define the chemical formula of the parent hydrocarbon nanocar chassis.
# This is a well-documented structure from chemical literature.
num_carbons_chassis = 38
num_hydrogens_chassis = 18

# The prefix "perfluoro-" indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.
# Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version
# is equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original version.
num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogens_chassis

# Print the explanation and the final result.
