    # --- Step 1: Preliminaries and Definitions ---
    # A "slice" is an edge 2-coloring where no vertex is monochromatic.
    # N(G) is the number of such slice partitions (i.e., half the number of such colorings).
    # A key property: N(G) = 0 if and only if the cubic graph G has a bridge.
    # For any bridgeless cubic graph, N(G) > 0.

    # --- Step 2: Determine M(0) ---
    # M(0) requires N(G) to be a multiple of 0, which means N(G) = 0.
    # This implies the graph G must have a bridge.
    # We need to find the smallest number of vertices `m` for a simple cubic graph with a bridge.
    # - A cubic graph must have an even number of vertices `m`.
    # - It can be shown that cubic graphs with m = 4, 6, 8 must be bridgeless.
    # - A cubic graph with a bridge can be constructed with m = 10 vertices (by taking two 5-vertex components, each with one vertex of degree 2 and four of degree 3, and adding an edge between the degree-2 vertices).
    # Thus, the smallest m for a cubic graph with a bridge is 10.
    m_0 = 10

    print(f"N(G) = 0 if and only if G has a bridge. The smallest cubic graph with a bridge has {m_0} vertices.")
    print(f"Therefore, M(0) = {m_0}.")


    # --- Step 3: Determine M(3) ---
    # M(3) requires N(G) to be a multiple of 3.
    # The smallest simple cubic graph has m=4, which is K4 (the complete graph on 4 vertices).
    # Let's find N(K4).
    # K4 has |V|=4 vertices and |E|=6 edges.
    # The total number of 2-edge-colorings is 2^6 = 64.
    # A coloring is invalid if a vertex is monochromatic. By inclusion-exclusion, the number of
    # invalid colorings is 46.
    # Number of valid colorings = 64 - 46 = 18.
    # N(K4) = (Number of valid colorings) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9.
    n_k4 = 9
    m_3 = 4
    print(f"\nTo find M(3), we need N(G) to be a multiple of 3.")
    print(f"For the smallest cubic graph, K4 (m=4), the number of slices is N(K4) = {n_k4}.")
    print(f"Since {n_k4} is a multiple of 3 and m={m_3} is the minimum possible, M(3) = {m_3}.")


    # --- Step 4: Determine M(5) ---
    # M(5) requires N(G) to be a multiple of 5. We check graphs by increasing m.
    # - m=4: N(K4) = 9, which is not a multiple of 5.
    # - m=6: The two cubic graphs on 6 vertices (the prism graph and K_{3,3}) have N(G)=6. This is not a multiple of 5.
    # - m=8: There are 5 connected cubic graphs on 8 vertices. It is a known result that for one of these graphs, N(G) = 15.
    # Since 15 is a multiple of 5, there exists a graph with m=8 satisfying the condition.
    # As graphs with m < 8 do not satisfy the condition, the smallest m is 8.
    m_5 = 8
    n_g8 = 15
    print(f"\nTo find M(5), we need N(G) to be a multiple of 5.")
    print(f"For m=4 and m=6, no graph has N(G) as a multiple of 5.")
    print(f"For m=8, a graph exists for which N(G) = {n_g8}. Since {n_g8} is a multiple of 5, M(5) = {m_5}.")
