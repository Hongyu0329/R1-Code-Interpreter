def solve_quantum_symmetries():
    """
    Analyzes statements about quantum symmetries and identifies the true ones.

    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    A) False. The momentum operator p̂ is a generator of translations and has a continuous spectrum.
    B1) False. The premise [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 for τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ leads to the operator identity p²/m = x(dV/dx), which cannot hold for any non-trivial potential.
    B2) False. The transformation generated by τ̂ = x̂p̂ + p̂x̂ scales x̂ by e^(-2ħθ) and p̂ by e^(2ħθ), which contradicts the statement.
    C) False. [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 is a necessary AND sufficient condition for [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0, not "necessary but not sufficient".
    D) True. If [τ̂, Ĥ] = 0 and Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩, then Ĥ(τ̂|ψ⟩) = τ̂Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E(τ̂|ψ⟩).
    E) True. By standard definition (especially in units where ħ=1 or following the primer's convention), L̂_z is the generator of rotations about the z-axis.
    F) True. An observable's expectation value is conserved for all states if and only if its operator commutes with the Hamiltonian.
    G) False. [Ŝ(θ₁), Ŝ(θ₂)] always equals zero because they are exponentials of the same operator (τ̂). This universal truth cannot imply a specific property like τ̂ being Hermitian.
    H) False. The Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator is an unbounded operator with a discrete spectrum, which leads to a discrete spectrum for Ŝ.
    I) True. The Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula shows that e^A e^B ≠ e^(A+B) if [A, B] ≠ 0. Here, the commutator of the exponents is non-zero.
    J) True. If [Ŝ, Ĥ] = 0 and Ĥ|ψ⟩ = E|ψ⟩, then Ĥ(Ŝ|ψ⟩) = ŜĤ|ψ⟩ = E(Ŝ|ψ⟩).

    The true statements are D, E, F, I, J.
