def solve_critical_exponent():
    """
    This function solves for the other critical exponent in the given inequality.

    The problem concerns the reverse square function estimate (or decoupling inequality)
    for the cone in R^3. The dependence of the best exponent alpha on p is
    conjectured to be piecewise linear in 1/p. The points where the slope changes
    are called critical exponents.

    One critical exponent is given as p = 4. This is the well-known Tomas-Stein exponent.
    Beyond this value (p >= 4), the problem is simpler, and it is conjectured that alpha(p) = 0.

    The other critical exponent is a key value in the restriction theory for the cone,
    notably from the work of Wolff on bilinear estimates. The currently accepted conjecture
    for the behavior of alpha(p) places the second break point at p = 10/3.

    The conjectured form for the best alpha(p) is:
    - alpha(p) = 0                    for p >= 4
    - alpha(p) = 1/4 - 1/p            for 10/3 <= p <= 4
    - alpha(p) = 1/2 - 3/(2*p)        for 2 <= p <= 10/3

    The slope of alpha as a function of 1/p changes at p=4 and p=10/3.
    Therefore, the other critical exponent is 10/3.
