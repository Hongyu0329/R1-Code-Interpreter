    "My plan is to answer the user's question by identifying the specific Christian theologian and the key terminology they developed.\n\n1.  **Identify the core concepts:** The user is asking about a theologian who created a system to explain \"changes in the laws of nature\" that could account for both the virgin birth (a unique, positive event) and the consequences of the Fall (a negative, ongoing alteration).\n2.  **Search for the theologian:** The most prominent early theologian to address this in a systematic way is Augustine of Hippo.\n3.  **Identify the terminology:** Augustine developed the concept of \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\" (*rationes seminales* or *causales rationes*).\n4.  **Explain the application:** This doctrine states that God embedded the potential for all future developments into the initial creation. An event like the virgin birth is not a violation of nature's laws, but the activation of a potential that was always present, just outside the *usual* course of events. Similarly, the negative changes after the Fall (like death and decay becoming manifest) can be seen as the actualization of negative potentials that were unleashed by sin.\n5.  **Construct the code:** I will create a Python script that prints this explanation clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the theologian and terminology\n    related to changes in the laws of nature.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    terminology = \"rationes seminales\"\n    latin_translation = \"seminal reasons\"\n\n    print(f\"The Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to describe these kinds of changes was {theologian}.\")\n    print(\"\\nHe developed the concept of 'causal' or 'seminal reasons' (in Latin, '{}').\".format(terminology))\n    print(\"\\nAccording to Augustine's doctrine of {}, God embedded the potentialities for all things into the original creation.\".format(latin_translation))\n    print(\"From this perspective:\")\n    print(\"1. A miracle like the virgin birth is not a violation of the natural order. Instead, it is the actualization of a potential that God placed within creation from the beginning, which He chose to activate at a specific moment in history.\")\n    print(\"2. The negative changes in the world after the Fall (e.g., mortality, toil, pain in childbirth) can also be understood within this framework. They are the coming to fruition of negative potentials that were always part of creation but were unleashed as a consequence of humanity's sin.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis framework allowed Augustine to explain how God could act in extraordinary ways without being seen as arbitrarily violating the very natural laws He established.\")\n\nsolve_theology_question()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
