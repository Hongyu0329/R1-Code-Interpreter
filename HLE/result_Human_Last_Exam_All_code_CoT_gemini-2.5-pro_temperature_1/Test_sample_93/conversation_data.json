    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\nThe problem asks for the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation $x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 = 2024$. The order of the integers $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5)$ matters, so for example, $(2, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ is a different solution from $(0, 2, 0, 0, 0)$ if the question was for a different number.\n\nA direct brute-force approach iterating through all possible values for each of the five variables would be too slow. A more efficient method is to find the unique sets of five non-negative integers that satisfy the equation, and then for each set, calculate how many distinct ordered solutions (permutations) can be formed.\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Limit the Search Space**: The maximum value for any $x_i$ cannot exceed $\\sqrt{2024}$. Since $44^2 = 1936$ and $45^2 = 2025$, the values for $x_i$ are in the range $[0, 44]$.\n2.  **Find Unique Sets (Base Solutions)**: I will search for multisets of five integers $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5\\}$ whose squares sum to 2024. To do this efficiently and without counting the same set multiple times, I'll enforce an order, such as $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le x_3 \\le x_4 \\le x_5$. This is achieved using nested loops where each subsequent variable starts its search from the value of the previous one.\n3.  **Calculate Permutations**: For each unique set of numbers found (a \"base solution\"), I will calculate the number of distinct permutations. If a set contains repeating numbers, the formula for permutations of a multiset is used: $\\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\dots n_k!}$, where $n=5$ is the total number of elements, and $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$ are the counts of each unique element in the set.\n4.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of solutions is the sum of the permutations for all the unique base solutions found.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will print each base solution, show how it satisfies the equation, list the number of permutations it generates, and finally, print the total count of all solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve_diophantine_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation:\n    x₁² + x₂² + x₃² + x₄² + x₅² = 2024\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 2024\n    limit = math.isqrt(N)\n    total_solutions = 0\n    base_solutions = []\n\n    # Iterate to find unique ordered sets (multisets) of solutions {x₁, ..., x₅}\n    # where x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ x₃ ≤ x₄ ≤ x₅.
