    "To determine the oligomeric state of the coiled-coil sequence, we need to analyze its heptad repeat pattern, denoted as `(abcdefg)n`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are critical as they form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil. The size and nature of these residues dictate the packing geometry and, consequently, the number of helices (oligomeric state) that can assemble efficiently.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the protein sequence.\n2.  Systematically test all seven possible alignments (registers) of the sequence to the `abcdefg` heptad repeat.\n3.  For each register, extract and display the amino acids at the core 'a' and 'd' positions.\n4.  Identify the most chemically plausible register, which is the one that places hydrophobic residues consistently in the core `a` and `d` positions.\n5.  Based on the specific types of amino acids in the optimal register's core (`a` and `d` positions), determine the most likely oligomeric state using the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing.\n6.  Print out the entire analysis and the final conclusion.\n\nThe following Python script will execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: The protein sequence to be analyzed is:\")\n    print(f\"'{sequence}'\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Understanding the Heptad Repeat.\")\n    explanation = (\n        \"Coiled-coils are characterized by a repeating seven-amino-acid pattern \"\n        \"called a heptad repeat, labeled (abcdefg).
