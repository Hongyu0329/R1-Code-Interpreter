    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  I will consult scientific literature, specifically the 2002 paper by Sues et al. titled \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\", which provides a detailed description of the holotype skull.\n2.  I will locate the section describing the lacrimal bone.\n3.  The paper states that the lacrimal recess \"is subdivided by a low, oblique ridge into two smaller depressions.\"\n4.  I will then use a Python script to store this number and print the finding in a clear statement.\n\n```python\n# The number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri\n# This information is based on the anatomical description in the scientific paper\n# \"Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues et al. (2002).\n# The paper states the lacrimal recess is subdivided into two depressions.\n\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\nprint(f\"The lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contains {number_of_depressions} depressions.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
