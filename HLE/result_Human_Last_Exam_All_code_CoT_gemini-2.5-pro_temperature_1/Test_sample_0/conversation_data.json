    "To determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views, let's first understand the key concepts and then demonstrate the violation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Critical-Level View:** A population's value is calculated by summing up the welfare of each individual minus a fixed \"critical level\" (c). Adding a person is only good if their welfare is above c. Adding someone with welfare below c (but still positive) makes the world worse.\n2.  **Define the Non-Elitism Condition:** This condition states that for any high level of welfare (w), a population consisting of a few people at that level is not infinitely better than a population of people at a slightly lower (but still positive) level of welfare (x). More formally, for any `w > x > 0`, a population of `n` people at level `w` can be surpassed in value by a *sufficiently large* population of `m` people at level `x`.\n3.  **Demonstrate the Violation:** We will set up a scenario using a Python script to show how a critical-level view fails the Non-Elitism test. We'll choose welfare levels `w` and `x` such that the critical level `c` is between them (`w > c > x`). We will then calculate the value of the two populations and show that the population with welfare `w` is *always* considered better than the population with welfare `x`, no matter how large the second population gets. This directly contradicts the Non-Elitism condition.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this logical demonstration.\n\n```python\ndef check_non_elitism_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates how Critical-Level Views violate\n    the Non-Elitism condition from Arrhenius's impossibility theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the parameters for our thought experiment ---\n    # The critical level (c): a positive welfare level.
