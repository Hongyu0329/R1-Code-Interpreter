    Solves the geometry problem by demonstrating a valid point configuration for r=1.
    
    The problem is equivalent to finding a geometric representation of a K5 graph
    with edges 2-colored (by distance < r or >= r) that has no monochromatic K3.
    This forces the graph of distances to be a C5 vs C5 coloring.

    We demonstrate a configuration for r=1, which is known to be the maximum possible value.
