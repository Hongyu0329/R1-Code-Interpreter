    "I will find the modern Vietnamese province associated with Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the specific battle that is considered Mu Sheng's first significant defeat during the Lam Sơn Revolution.\n2.  Historical sources point to the campaign of 1427 as the most decisive and major defeat for the Ming forces, which Mu Sheng co-commanded.\n3.  The pivotal event in this campaign was the Battle of Chi Lăng, where the other prong of the Ming invasion force was annihilated. Upon hearing of this, Mu Sheng's army lost its will to fight and retreated, marking a major strategic defeat.\n4.  I will then determine the modern-day Vietnamese province where the Battle of Chi Lăng took place.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print this information, including the name of the general, the province, the battle, and the year, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_defeat_location():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's\n    first major defeat in Vietnam.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Historical details for the answer\n    general_name = \"Ming General Mu Sheng\"\n    event_name = \"Battle of Chi Lăng\"\n    modern_province = \"Lạng Sơn Province\"\n    year = 1427\n\n    # Explanation\n    # Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred as part of a larger campaign in 1427.\n    # He was co-commander of a two-pronged relief army sent to quell the Lam Sơn uprising.\n    # The other army, under Liu Sheng, was destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng.\n    # When Mu Sheng heard of this disaster, his army's morale collapsed and he was forced\n    # to retreat, turning his campaign into a major failure. The key event that sealed\n    # his defeat took place at Chi Lăng Pass.\n\n    print(f\"The current Vietnamese province where {general_name} experienced his first major defeat is: {modern_province}\")\n    print(f\"This occurred during the campaign of the year {year}, which was decided by the {event_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The number representing the year of the defeat is: {year}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer\nfind_defeat_location()\n```\n<<<Lạng Sơn Province>>>"
