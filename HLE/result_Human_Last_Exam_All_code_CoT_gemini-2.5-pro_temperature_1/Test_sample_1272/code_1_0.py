    # Explanation
    # Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred as part of a larger campaign in 1427.
    # He was co-commander of a two-pronged relief army sent to quell the Lam Sơn uprising.
    # The other army, under Liu Sheng, was destroyed at the Battle of Chi Lăng.
    # When Mu Sheng heard of this disaster, his army's morale collapsed and he was forced
    # to retreat, turning his campaign into a major failure. The key event that sealed
    # his defeat took place at Chi Lăng Pass.
