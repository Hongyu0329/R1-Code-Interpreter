    Prints the solution and reasoning for the CCCZ synthesis problem.
    
    The reasoning is based on established results from quantum circuit synthesis:
    
    1.  **Equivalence to CCNOT Synthesis**: The problem can be transformed.
        The cost in CCZ gates to make a CCCZ gate is the same as the cost in
        CCNOT (Toffoli) gates to make a C³NOT gate. This is because single-qubit
        Hadamard gates (which are allowed) can convert between these gate types.

    2.  **Known Lower Bound**: For synthesizing a C³NOT gate from CCNOT gates
        without ancillas, it has been proven that a minimum of 8 CCNOT gates
        is required.

    3.  **Known Construction**: Explicit circuit designs exist that construct
        a C³NOT gate using exactly 8 CCNOT gates.

    Since the proven lower bound matches an existing construction, the minimal
    number of gates is 8.
