No, it is not considered superfluous. While the constancy of the speed of light can be derived from the principle of relativity if one assumes Maxwell's equations are universally valid, making it a separate postulate was a crucial step to explicitly reject the luminiferous ether theory and force the development of new transformation laws (the Lorentz transformations) to resolve the conflict with classical mechanics.
