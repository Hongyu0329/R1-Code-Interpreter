# The reaction described is a Pummerer rearrangement.
# 1. Methyl phenyl sulfoxide is activated by triflic anhydride.
# 2. An intermediate thionium ion, [C6H5-S=CH2]+, is formed.
# 3. Trimethylsilyl cyanide provides a cyanide nucleophile (CN-).
# 4. The cyanide attacks the CH2 carbon of the thionium ion.
# 5. The final product is C6H5-S-CH2-CN.

# To name this compound according to IUPAC rules:
# The main functional group is the nitrile (-CN).
# The parent chain is ethanenitrile.
# The C6H5-S- group is a substituent called "phenylsulfanyl".
