    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\n2.  **Recall Graph Theory Principles:**\n    *   For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   The upper bound $\\chi(G) = n$ is achieved only by the complete graph, $K_n$, where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n    *   The problem explicitly states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Maximum Value:**\n    *   Since $G$ is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$.\n    *   This implies that the maximum possible chromatic number must be at most $n-1$. So, we have the inequality $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n4.  **Prove the Maximum is Achievable:** To show that $n-1$ is indeed the maximum possible value, we need to construct a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices that is not a complete graph but has a chromatic number of $n-1$.\n    *   Consider a graph constructed from two disconnected components:\n        1.  A complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, let's call it $K_{n-1}$.\n        2.  A single, isolated vertex, let's call it $v$.\n    *   The resulting graph $G$ has $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   This graph $G$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex $v$ is not connected to any vertices in the $K_{n-1}$ component.\n    *   The chromatic number of this graph $G$ is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components.\n    *   The chromatic number of the $K_{n-1}$ component is $n-1$.\n    *   The chromatic number of the isolated vertex is $1$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(n-1, 1) = n-1$.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** We have shown that the maximum chromatic number is $n-1$. Given $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this simple calculation and print the result as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_graph_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of\n    a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # According to Brooks' Theorem and properties of graph coloring:\n    # 1.
