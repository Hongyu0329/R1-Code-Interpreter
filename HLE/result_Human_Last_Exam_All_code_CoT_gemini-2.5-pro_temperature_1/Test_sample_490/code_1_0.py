The Oophaga pumilio morph endemic to Isla Col贸n in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago is one of the most iconic. Its phenotype is distinguished by a bright red or orange-red body, which serves as a potent aposematic (warning) signal to predators. This vibrant body coloration is sharply contrasted by its limbs. The legs and feet of this morph are a distinct blue or sometimes purplish-blue.

Comparing this information with the given options:
- A, C, D, F, G, H, I are incorrect as they describe different color patterns or other morphs entirely.
- B is close but 'splotches' is less accurate than the general coloration of the legs.
- E provides the most accurate and widely recognized description.

Therefore, the best description for the phenotype of the 'Isla Col贸n' morph is:
