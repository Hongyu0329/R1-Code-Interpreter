# Plan:
# 1. Define what a valid set of labels for K_1,100 is based on the problem description.
#    A set of labels {w_i} is valid if for any k, w_k cannot be written as a sum of a subset of {w_j | j!=k}.
# 2. We hypothesize that an optimal set can be constructed from 100 consecutive integers,
#    e.g., {M+1, M+2, ..., M+100}, for some M >= 1.
# 3. We find the smallest M for which this set of labels is valid.
# 4. The global labeling number will be the maximum label in this optimal set, which is M+100.
# 5. A set of this form is invalid if there is a "collision", i.e.,
#    M+k = sum(M+j for j in J), where J is a subset of {1..100} not containing k.
#    This simplifies to M*(m-1) = sum(j for j in J) - k, where m=|J|.
# 6. The code will loop M from 1 upwards. For each M, it checks if the collision equation has a solution.
#    The first M for which no solution exists is the one we seek.
