    Solves the problem by finding the number of natural numbers n for which
    n <= rho(n), where rho(n) is the Hurwitz-Radon number.
    
    The problem is equivalent to finding n for which there exists an n-dimensional
    subspace of n-by-n real matrices where every non-zero matrix is invertible.
    The maximum dimension of such a subspace is given by the Hurwitz-Radon
    function, rho(n).
    
    The function rho(n) is calculated as follows:
    1. Write n = u * 2^m, where u is an odd integer.
    2. Write m = 4a + b, where a is an integer and b is in {0, 1, 2, 3}.
    3. rho(n) = 2^b + 8a.
    
    This script will find all n that satisfy n <= rho(n).
