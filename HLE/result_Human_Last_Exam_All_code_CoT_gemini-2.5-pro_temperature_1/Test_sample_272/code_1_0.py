    # H has a finite-index subgroup isomorphic to Z, so it has 2 ends.

    # (6) Number of ends of G
    # G = H * H is a free product of two infinite groups, so it has infinitely many ends.
    ans6 = infinity

    # (7) Cohomological dimension of the pro-p completion P of G
    # For an odd prime p, G has no non-trivial p-group quotients.
    # So P is the trivial group, which has cd=0.
    ans7 = 0

    # (8) Virtual cohomological dimension of P
    # P is the trivial group, so its vcd is also 0.
    ans8 = 0

    # (9) Dimension of the cohomology group H^1(G, F_p)
    # H^1(G, F_p) ~= Hom(G_ab, F_p). G_ab = (C_2)^4. For odd p, Hom(C_2, F_p) is trivial.
    # Thus, the dimension is 0.
