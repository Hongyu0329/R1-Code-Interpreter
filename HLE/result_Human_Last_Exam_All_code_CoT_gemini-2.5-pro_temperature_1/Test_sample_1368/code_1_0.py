def solve_inscribed_square():
    """
    This function determines the shortest sequence of commands to construct a square
    inscribed in a circle using only a compass and straightedge.

    The geometric strategy is as follows:
    1.  An inscribed square's diagonals are two perpendicular diameters of the circle.
    2.  Start with the given center (O) and a point on the circumference (A).
    3.  'L': Draw a line through A and O to define the first diameter, finding point C.
    4.  'C': Draw a circle centered at A with radius AO.
    5.  'C': Draw a circle centered at C with radius CO.
    6.  'L': Draw a line through the two intersection points of the previous two circles.
        This line is the second diameter, perpendicular to the first, finding points B and D.
    7.  'L','L','L','L': Draw the four lines connecting the vertices (A,B,C,D) to form the square.
