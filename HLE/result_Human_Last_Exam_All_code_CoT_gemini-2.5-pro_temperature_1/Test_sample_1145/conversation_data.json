    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. According to the principles of quantum mechanics, this probability is determined by integrating the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², over the interval of interest.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box of length 'a' is given by:\n    Ψn(x) = √(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)\n2.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability density is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n    |Ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)\n3.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability (P) of finding the particle between x₁ = 0.495a and x₂ = 0.505a is the definite integral of the probability density over this range:\n    P = ∫ from 0.495a to 0.505a of (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a) dx\n4.  **Simplify and Solve:** For this problem, we are given the quantum state n = 2. We can simplify the calculation by setting the box length 'a' to 1. This is valid because the interval is given as a fraction of 'a', making the result independent of the actual length. The variable 'x' then represents the position as a fraction of 'a'. The integral becomes:\n    P = ∫ from 0.495 to 0.505 of 2 * sin²(2πx) dx\n5.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will use a Python script with the `scipy` library, which has a powerful function `quad` for numerical integration, to compute the value of this definite integral.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n    in a given interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the quantum state and interval limits.\n    # We can set the box length 'a' to 1 without loss of generality,\n    # as the interval is defined relative to 'a'.\n    n = 2\n    a = 1.0\n    x1 = 0.495 * a\n    x2 = 0.505 * a\n\n    # Define the probability density function, |Ψ(x)|², for a particle in a box.\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, L_val):\n        return (2.0 / L_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / L_val))**2\n\n    # Calculate the definite integral of the probability density function\n    # over the specified interval [x1, x2].\n    # The 'args' parameter passes the constant values of n and a to the function.\n    probability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n    # Print the problem statement, the equation being solved, and the result.\n    print(\"This script calculates the probability that a particle in a 1D box is\")\n    print(\"located in a specific interval for a given quantum state n.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The equation for the probability (P) for n = {n} in the interval [{x1:.3f}a, {x2:.3f}a] is:\")\n    # To show the equation with numbers, we treat 'a' as 1 and 'x' as x/a.\n    print(f\"P = Integral from {x1:.3f} to {x2:.3f} of (2 * sin^2({n} * pi * x)) dx\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The calculated probability is: {probability}\")\n\nsolve_probability()\n<<<6.579710895368366e-06>>>"
