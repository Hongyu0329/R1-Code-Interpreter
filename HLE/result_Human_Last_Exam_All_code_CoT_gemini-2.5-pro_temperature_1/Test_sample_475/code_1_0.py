    Calculates the total charge on a perturbed spherical droplet.
    
    The calculation is based on a simplified version of the provided formula for surface 
    charge density, assuming a typo correction for physical consistency. The original
    formula for sigma is not periodic in phi, which is non-physical. We assume the
    term exp(q_i * theta * phi) should be exp(0) = 1.
    
    The simplified analytical formula for the total charge Q is:
    Q = sigma_0 * R_0 * pi^3 * (omega / (1 + omega)^3)
    where omega = W(1), the Lambert W function evaluated at 1.
