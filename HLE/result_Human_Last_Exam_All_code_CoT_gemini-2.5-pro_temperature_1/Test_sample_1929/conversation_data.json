    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type**: The reactants are butadiene (a conjugated diene) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (a substituted alkene, the dienophile). This combination is characteristic of a Diels-Alder reaction, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition.\n2.  **Analyze the Mechanism**: In this reaction, the 4 π-electrons of butadiene and the 2 π-electrons of the dienophile rearrange to form a new six-membered ring. Two new sigma bonds and one new pi bond are formed in a concerted fashion.\n3.  **Determine the Product's Structure**: The reaction results in a cyclohexene derivative. The four carbons from butadiene and the two carbons from the dienophile form the ring. The new double bond is located between the central carbons of the original diene. The chlorine and fluorine atoms remain attached to their respective carbons from the dienophile.\n4.  **Name the Product**: The product must be named according to IUPAC rules. The parent ring is cyclohexene. The positions of the double bond and the substituents (dichloro and difluoro groups) are numbered to give the lowest possible locants, following alphabetical priority for the substituents when choices exist. This leads to the name **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene**.\n5.  **Create a Python Script**: I will write a Python script to print the explanation of the reaction, the overall chemical equation, the name of the product, and finally, I will explicitly print the numbers from the IUPAC name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef identify_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the product of the reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define reactants and product formula\n    diene = \"Butadiene (C4H6)\"\n    dienophile = \"1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (C2Cl2F2)\"\n    product_formula = \"C6H6Cl2F2\"\n    product_name = \"4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene\"\n\n    # Explain the reaction\n    print(\"1.
