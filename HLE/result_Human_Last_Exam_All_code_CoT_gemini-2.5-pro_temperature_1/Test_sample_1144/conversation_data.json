    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Identify the physical principles**: We need two key principles:\n    *   **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: This relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is `Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2`, where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant. We will use the minimum uncertainty, so `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`.\n    *   **Bohr Model of the Atom**: This model gives us the momentum (p) of an electron in a specific orbit. For the first Bohr orbit (n=1), the angular momentum is `L = p * r = nħ = ħ`, where `r` is the radius of the orbit. The radius of the first Bohr orbit is the Bohr radius, `a₀`. Therefore, the momentum is `p = ħ / a₀`.\n\n2.  **Define constants and given values**:\n    *   Uncertainty in position (Δx) = 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m.\n    *   Bohr radius (a₀) ≈ 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n    *   Reduced Planck constant (ħ) ≈ 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s.\n\n3.  **Formulate the ratio**: We need to find the ratio `Δp / p`.\n    *   `Δp / p = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)`\n    *   By simplifying this expression, we get: `Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)`\n\n4.  **Calculate the final value**: Substitute the known values into the simplified formula to find the numerical answer.\n\n5.  **Write the code**: The Python code will define the constants, perform the calculation using the derived formula, and print each step of the calculation, including the final equation with the numbers plugged in.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the given values and physical constants.\n# Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm = 10e-12 m)\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Bohr radius in meters\na0 = 5.29e-11\n\nprint(\"This script calculates the ratio of the uncertainty of momentum to the momentum of an electron in the first Bohr orbit.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\n\n# Step 2: Use the simplified formula derived from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle and the Bohr model.\n# The ratio (Δp / p) simplifies to a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n# Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)\n# p = ħ / a₀\n# Δp / p = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀) = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\n\nprint(f\"Given uncertainty in position (Δx) = {delta_x:.2e} m\")\nprint(f\"The Bohr radius (a₀) for the first orbit is {a0:.2e} m\")\nprint(\"\\nThe ratio is calculated using the formula: Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(\"-\" * 80)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the ratio.\nratio = a0 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation with the values and the result.\nprint(\"Plugging in the values into the equation:\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a0} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\n<<<2.645>>>\n```"
