    "To find an analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime, we can use an asymptotic expansion. The main contribution to the integral for small $\\epsilon$ comes from the region where the denominator is smallest, which is near $x=0$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the derivation:\n1.  **Approximation of the integrand**: For small $x$, the function in the denominator $g(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is dominated by its lowest power terms. We'll approximate it as $g(x) \\approx 9x^5 + 5x^6$. The higher-order term $9x^8$ and the finite integration limit of 15.00 will only contribute to higher-order terms in the $\\epsilon$ expansion, which we can neglect for this approximation.\n2.  **Extend integration limit**: Since the integrand is largest near $x=0$ and decays rapidly for larger $x$, we can extend the upper limit of integration from 15.00 to $\\infty$. This simplifies the calculation without significantly affecting the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion.\n3.  **Taylor expansion**: We treat the term $5x^6$ as a small perturbation to $\\epsilon + 9x^5$ and perform a Taylor expansion:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6} = \\frac{1}{(\\epsilon + 9x^5)} \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{5x^6}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} - \\frac{5x^6}{(\\epsilon + 9x^5)^2} $$\n4.  **Term-by-term integration**: We integrate both terms of the expansion from $0$ to $\\infty$. This will give us the first two terms of the asymptotic series for $I(\\epsilon)$.\n    $$ I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5} - \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{5x^6}{(\\epsilon + 9x^5)^2} dx $$\n5.  **Evaluate integrals**: These integrals can be solved using a substitution and a standard integral formula related to the Gamma or Beta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^{a-1}}{1+u^b} du = \\frac{\\pi}{b \\sin(\\pi a / b)}$. The evaluation yields an expansion of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C_1 \\epsilon^{-4/5} + C_2 \\epsilon^{-3/5}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the coefficients $C_1$ and $C_2$ and prints the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the coefficients for the asymptotic expansion of the integral I(epsilon)\n    and prints the final analytical formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the integral denominator\n    # g(x) = a*x^n1 + b*x^n2 + ...\n    a = 9.0\n    n1 = 5.0\n    b = 5.0\n    n2 = 6.0\n\n    # --- Calculation of the first term: C1 * epsilon^(-(n1-1)/n1) ---\n    # The first term comes from integrating 1 / (epsilon + a*x^n1)\n    # The exponent of epsilon is -(n1-1)/n1\n    p1_num = n1 - 1.0\n    p1_den = n1\n    p1 = p1_num / p1_den\n\n    # The coefficient C1 is given by pi / (n1 * a^(1/n1) * sin(pi/n1))\n    C1 = np.pi / (n1 * (a**(1.0/n1)) * np.sin(np.pi/n1))\n\n    # --- Calculation of the second term: C2 * epsilon^(-(2*n1-n2-1)/n1) ---\n    # The second term comes from integrating -b*x^n2 / (epsilon + a*x^n1)^2\n    # The exponent of epsilon is -(2*n1 - n2 - 1)/n1\n    p2_num = (2.0*n1 - n2 - 1.0)\n    p2_den = n1\n    p2 = p2_num / p2_den\n\n    # The coefficient C2 is derived from the integral evaluation.\n    # It evaluates to - (2*pi*b) / (n1^2 * a^((n2+1)/n1) * sin(pi*(n2-n1+1)/n1))\n    # For our specific values, this simplifies to:\n    C2 = (-2.0 * np.pi * b) / (n1**2 * a**((n2 + 1.0) / n1) * np.sin(np.pi * (n2 - n1 + 1.0) / n1))\n    \n    # Alternatively, using the simplified formula from the thought process:\n    # C2 = -2.0 * np.pi / (5.0 * (9.0**(7.0/5.0)) * np.sin(2.0*np.pi/5.0))\n\n    # --- Print the resulting formula ---\n    print(\"An analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for the small epsilon regime is an asymptotic expansion.\")\n    print(\"The first two terms of this expansion are:\")\n    print(f\"\\nI(epsilon) \\u2248 {C1:.4f} * \\u03B5^(-{p1_num}/{p1_den}) + ({C2:.4f}) * \\u03B5^(-{p2_num}/{p2_den})\\n\")\n    print(\"This can also be written with decimal exponents as:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) \\u2248 {C1:.4f} * \\u03B5^(-{p1:.2f}) {C2:+.4f} * \\u03B5^(-{p2:.2f})\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<I(epsilon) approx 0.6888 * epsilon^(-4.0/5.0) - 0.0610 * epsilon^(-3.0/5.0)>>>"
