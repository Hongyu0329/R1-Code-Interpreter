    Determines the safe goal for model M when predictive success is uncomputable.
    
    The problem states that the set of successful predictors (I) can be uncomputable.
    This means the model cannot use future predictive success as a reliable goal.
    A "safe" goal must be based on information that is computable and available to the model.

    1. The Source of Learning: The model M has access to the p.c. functions, which are
       its 'hypotheses' about how to complete sequences. This is the most fundamental,
       computable information it can learn from.

    2. The Learning Paradigm: Since external reward (predictive success) is uncomputable,
       the model must generate its own learning signals. 'Self-supervised learning' is the
       paradigm where a model learns the structure of its data without external labels.
       Here, the model M can learn about the structure of its own hypothesis space.

    Therefore, the safe goal is a form of self-supervised learning from its own hypotheses.
