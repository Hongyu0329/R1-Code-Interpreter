    This function determines the second smallest possible cardinal for the described tower.
    The reasoning is based on advanced set theory (cardinal characteristics).

    1. The problem describes an unbounded, increasing chain of length `delta` in the partial order
       of omega_2-sized subsets of omega_2, ordered by "almost inclusion".
    2. The minimal length `delta` of such a chain is the cofinality of this partial order,
       which is the dominating number `d(omega_2)`.
    3. Set theory proves that `d(omega_2)` must be a cardinal `mu` such that its
       cofinality `cf(mu)` is greater than `omega_2`.
    4. It is consistent with ZFC that `d(omega_2)` can be any cardinal `mu` satisfying `cf(mu) > omega_2`.
    5. We need to find the second smallest cardinal that satisfies this property.
       - The smallest cardinal `mu` with `cf(mu) > omega_2` is `omega_3`.
       - The second smallest cardinal `mu` with `cf(mu) > omega_2` is `omega_4`.
