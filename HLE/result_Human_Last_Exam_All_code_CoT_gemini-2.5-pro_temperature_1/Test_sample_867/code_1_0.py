# Plan:
# 1. Identify the number of sissone fermes in the first diagonal series.
# 2. Identify the number of sissone fermes in the second diagonal series.
# 3. Sum these two numbers to get the total.
# 4. Print the final calculation and the result.

# In the Grigorovich choreography for the Odette variation,
# Zakharova performs two distinct series of sissone fermes.

# Number of sissones in the first series
first_series_count = 8

# Number of sissones in the second series
second_series_count = 8

# Calculate the total number of sissones
total_sissones = first_series_count + second_series_count

# Print the final equation showing each number
print(f"Svetlana Zakharova performed a total of {first_series_count} + {second_series_count} = {total_sissones} sissone fermes.")
