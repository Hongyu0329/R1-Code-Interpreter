    # The user asks:
    # Suppose f: R -> R is a Schwartz class function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) over R is 0
    # for all non-negative integers k (k=0, 1, 2, ...). Does it follow that f = 0?

    # The answer is "Yes". Here is the step-by-step reasoning.

    # Step 1: The Fourier Transform
    # Let f be a Schwartz function. Its Fourier transform, F(f) or f_hat, is defined as:
    # f_hat(xi) = integral from -inf to +inf of f(x) * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx
    # The Fourier transform is an isomorphism from the Schwartz space to itself.
    # This means it's a bijection, and if f_hat is the zero function, then f must also be the zero function.

    # Step 2: Relating Moments of f(x) to Derivatives of f_hat(xi)
    # We can compute the k-th derivative of f_hat(xi) by differentiating under the integral sign
    # (which is permissible for Schwartz functions):
    # f_hat^(k)(xi) = d^k/d(xi)^k [f_hat(xi)] = integral of f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k * exp(-2*pi*i*x*xi) dx

    # Evaluating this derivative at xi = 0 gives:
    # f_hat^(k)(0) = integral of f(x) * (-2*pi*i*x)^k dx
    #              = (-2*pi*i)^k * [integral of x^k * f(x) dx]

    # Step 3: Applying the Given Condition
    # The problem states that the k-th moment of f is zero for all k >= 0.
    # The k-th moment is M_k = integral of x^k * f(x) dx.
    # So, M_k = 0 for all k = 0, 1, 2, ...

    # Substituting this into our result from Step 2:
    # f_hat^(k)(0) = (-2*pi*i)^k * M_k = (-2*pi*i)^k * 0
    final_equation = "f_hat^(k)(0) = 0"
    
    # This crucial result holds for all k = 0, 1, 2, ...
    
    # Step 4: Using Analyticity of the Fourier Transform
    # A key property of Schwartz functions is that their Fourier transforms can be extended
    # from the real line to the entire complex plane. This extension results in an
    # entire function (a function that is analytic, or complex differentiable, everywhere).

    # Step 5: The Identity Theorem for Analytic Functions
    # A fundamental theorem of complex analysis states that if a function is analytic on a
    # connected domain D, and if at some point z_0 in D, the function and all its derivatives
    # are zero (i.e., f^(k)(z_0) = 0 for all k >= 0), then the function must be identically
    # zero throughout D.
    # Our function f_hat is entire (D is the complex plane), and all its derivatives at z_0 = 0 are zero.
    # Therefore, f_hat must be the zero function everywhere on the complex plane.

    # Step 6: Concluding that f(x) must be Zero
    # Since f_hat is identically zero on the complex plane, it is also zero on the real line.
    # As stated in Step 1, the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space is a bijection.
    # If the transform f_hat is the zero function, the original function f must also be the zero function.
    # This follows from the Fourier Inversion Theorem:
    # f(x) = integral of f_hat(xi) * exp(2*pi*i*x*xi) d(xi)
    # If f_hat(xi) = 0 for all xi, the integral is 0, so f(x) = 0 for all x.

    print("The argument shows that the derivatives of the Fourier transform of f, denoted f_hat, are all zero at the origin.")
    print("The final equation derived from the given condition is:")
    print(f"{final_equation} for all k = 0, 1, 2, ...")

    print("\nBased on this, and the properties of analytic functions, we conclude:")
    conclusion = "Yes, if all moments of a Schwartz function f are zero, then f must be the zero function."
