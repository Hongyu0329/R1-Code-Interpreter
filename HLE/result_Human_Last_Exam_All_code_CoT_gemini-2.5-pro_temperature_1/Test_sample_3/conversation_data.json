    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that determines the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  The problem is to find the largest possible order for a group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ with $m > 1$, where this group is the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n2.  We will use the complete classification of torsion structures that can appear over quadratic number fields. This classification is a known result in the arithmetic of elliptic curves.\n3.  We will create a list of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups. This list will also contain information about the specific quadratic fields over which each structure can occur. Note that any group that can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}$ can also occur over any quadratic field.\n4.  From this master list, we will filter out the subgroups that are known to be realizable over our specific field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n5.  We will then calculate the order of each possible group for our field by computing the product $m \\times n$.\n6.  Finally, we will identify the maximum among these orders and present it as the answer, showing the components of the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_torsion_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an\n    elliptic curve over the number field K = Q(sqrt(-3)).\n\n    It uses the known classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A list of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups G = Z/mZ x Z/nZ\n    # over any quadratic field.
