The analytical solution for the density profile is an implicit equation relating the non-dimensional position (x/L) and the non-dimensional density (rho/rho_0).

For a Mach sqrt(3) shock in a monatomic gas with Pr = 3/4, the equation is:

      3           /      8 * (-1 + rho/rho_0)**2    \ 
x/L = - * log|-----------------------------|
      4           \rho/rho_0 * (2 - rho/rho_0)/
