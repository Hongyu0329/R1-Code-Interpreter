    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to derive the partition function.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will begin with the general definition of the grand canonical partition function, `Z`, which is defined as the trace of the exponential of the grand canonical Hamiltonian: `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H^ - μN^))]`. In this formula, `β` is the inverse temperature (1/kT), `H^` is the Hamiltonian operator, `μ` is the chemical potential, and `N^` is the particle number operator.\n2.  Next, I will substitute the specific Hamiltonian given in your problem, `H^ = -μN^`, into this general definition.\n3.  This substitution simplifies the operator in the exponent to `H^ - μN^ = -μN^ - μN^ = -2μN^`. The partition function then becomes `Z = Tr[exp(2βμN^)]`.\n4.  The path integral is a mathematical formalism used to calculate this trace. The result of the calculation depends on the quantum statistics of the particles in the system (i.e., whether they are bosons or fermions). Since the problem does not specify this, I will solve it for the common case of a single mode that can be occupied by any number of bosons.\n5.  For a bosonic system, the eigenvalues of the number operator `N^` are the non-negative integers (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). The trace operation becomes a sum over all these possible particle number states.\n6.  This sum takes the form of a geometric series: `Z = Σ_{n=0 to ∞} exp(2βμn)`.\n7.  Finally, I will calculate the sum of this series to obtain the final expression for the partition function `Z`. This result holds under the condition that the series converges, which is when `μ < 0`. I will then generate a Python script to display this final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef display_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the partition function Z\n    for the given Hamiltonian in the grand canonical ensemble.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols for the variables in the equation\n    Z = sympy.Symbol('Z')\n    beta = sympy.Symbol('beta')\n    mu = sympy.Symbol('mu')\n\n    # The numbers in the equation as requested\n    num_one = 1\n    num_two = 2\n\n    # The expression for the partition function Z for a single bosonic mode.\n    # The derivation is as follows:\n    # 1. Z = Tr[exp(-beta * (H - mu*N))]\n    # 2. Given H = -mu*N, the expression becomes Z = Tr[exp(-beta * (-mu*N - mu*N))]\n    # 3. This simplifies to Z = Tr[exp(2*beta*mu*N)]\n    # 4. For a single bosonic mode, the trace is a sum over particle numbers n = 0, 1, 2, ...\n    #    Z = Sum_{n=0 to inf} [exp(2*beta*mu)]^n\n    # 5. This is a geometric series which sums to 1 / (1 - x), where x = exp(2*beta*mu)\n    \n    # Constructing the final equation symbolically\n    # Note: We use sympy's exp for symbolic representation\n    expression = num_one / (num_one - sympy.exp(num_two * beta * mu))\n    \n    equation = sympy.Eq(Z, expression)\n\n    # Print the final result\n    print(\"The partition function Z for a system with the specified Hamiltonian is:\")\n    # We use pretty print for a nicer mathematical output\n    sympy.pprint(equation, use_unicode=True)\n    \n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(f\"  Z: The partition function\")\n    print(f\"  {num_one}: The number one\")\n    print(f\"  {num_two}: The number two\")\n    print(f\"  beta: Inverse temperature (1/kT)\")\n    print(f\"  mu: Chemical potential\")\n    print(f\"  exp: The exponential function\")\n    print(\"\\nThis result corresponds to a single bosonic mode and requires mu < 0 for convergence.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_partition_function()\n```\n<<<Z = 1/(1 - exp(2*beta*mu))>>>"
