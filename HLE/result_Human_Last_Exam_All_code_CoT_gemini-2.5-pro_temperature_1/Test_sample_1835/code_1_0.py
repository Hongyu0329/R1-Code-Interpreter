# This script models the composition of a logical proposition from its parts.
# The Generality Constraint suggests that if you understand a predicate 'F' in one
# context (like 'Fa'), you can reuse that understanding in another (like '∀x Fx').

# 1. Define the fundamental concepts and assign a symbolic numerical value to each.
#    These could be thought of as "concept IDs" or complexity scores.
concept_values = {
    'F': 3,  # The predicate (e.g., 'is mortal')
    'a': 1,  # A specific constant (e.g., 'Socrates')
    '∀': 5,  # The universal quantifier ('For all')
    'x': 2   # A variable
}

# 2. Assume the "mind" understands Fa and universal quantification.
#    This means the concepts 'F', 'a', and '∀' (and by extension 'x') are understood.
print("Premise: Understanding 'Fa' provides the concept 'F'.")
print("Premise: Understanding universal quantification provides '∀' and 'x'.\n")

# 3. We want to construct the proposition '∀x Fx'.
#    Let's define the structure of this proposition by its components.
proposition_components = ['∀', 'x', 'F', 'x']
print(f"Constructing the proposition '∀x Fx' from the components: {proposition_components}\n")

# 4. We will now form an equation by summing the values of the required components.
#    This demonstrates building a complex thought from simpler, known parts.

for component in proposition_components:
    value = concept_values[component]
    total_value += value
    equation_parts_str.append(str(value))
    equation_parts_num.append(value)

# 5. Display the final constructed equation and its result.
equation_string = " + ".join(equation_parts_str)
print("The compositional 'complexity' equation for '∀x Fx' is:")
print(f"{equation_string} = {total_value}\n")

# 6. As requested, output each number from the final equation.
