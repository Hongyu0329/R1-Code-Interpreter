    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the $A(\\alpha)$-stability of the BDF4 scheme, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Stability Function**: The stability of a linear multistep method for the test equation $y' = \\lambda y$ is governed by the roots of its stability polynomial, $\\pi(\\zeta, z) = \\rho(\\zeta) - z \\sigma(\\zeta) = 0$, where $z=h\\lambda$. The boundary of the stability region is traced by the function $z(\\zeta) = \\rho(\\zeta) / \\sigma(\\zeta)$ for $|\\zeta|=1$. For the BDF4 scheme, as formulated in the problem, the characteristic polynomial is $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\frac{25}{12}\\zeta^4 - 4\\zeta^3 + 3\\zeta^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^4$.\n\n2.  **A($\\alpha$)-Stability Angle**: The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the wedge-shaped region of stability $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. This means we need to find the tangents from the origin to the stability boundary. The angle is given by $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_{\\text{max}}$, where $\\phi_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum argument of any point $z(\\zeta)$ on the boundary.\n\n3.  **Finding the Extremal Angle**: The argument of $z(\\zeta)$ is maximal or minimal when its derivative with respect to the angle of $\\zeta$ is zero. Let $\\zeta = e^{i\\theta}$. The condition for an extremum is $\\frac{d}{d\\theta} \\arg(z(e^{i\\theta})) = 0$. This can be shown to be equivalent to the condition $\\text{Re}(\\zeta \\frac{\\rho'(\\zeta)}{\\rho(\\zeta)}) = \\text{Re}(\\zeta \\frac{\\sigma'(\\zeta)}{\\sigma(\\zeta)})$.\n    For BDFk, $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\beta_k\\zeta^k$, and it follows that $\\text{Re}(\\zeta \\frac{\\sigma'(\\zeta)}{\\sigma(\\zeta)}) = k$. For BDF4, $k=4$.\n    So the condition becomes $\\text{Re}\\left(\\overline{\\rho(\\zeta)} \\left(\\zeta\\rho'(\\zeta) - 4\\rho(\\zeta)\\right)\\right) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Solving for the Angle**: We can solve this equation for $\\zeta=e^{i\\theta}$. This results in a polynomial in $c=\\cos(\\theta)$. One of the exact roots of this polynomial gives the location of the extremal angle. For BDF4, it turns out that one of the roots is exactly $c = 2/3$.\n\n5.  **Calculating the Angle**: We evaluate the complex number $z = x+iy$ on the stability boundary for $\\cos(\\theta) = 2/3$. The maximum argument is then $\\phi_{\\text{max}} = \\arctan(y/x)$, and the stability angle is $\\alpha = \\pi - \\phi_{\\text{max}}$. By using the property $\\pi - \\arctan(y/x) = \\arctan(-y/x)$ for $x<0, y>0$, we can find a simple expression for $\\alpha$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic algebra and derive the exact value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport math\n\ndef solve_bdf4_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbols\n    zeta = sympy.Symbol('zeta')\n    c = sympy.Symbol('c') # c = cos(theta)\n\n    # 1.
