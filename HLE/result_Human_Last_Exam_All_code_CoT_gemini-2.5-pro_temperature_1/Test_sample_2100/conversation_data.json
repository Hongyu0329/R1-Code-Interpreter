    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the person and then generate the required code.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:**\n    *   **Poet:** The quote is attributed to the Russian poet Andrei Voznesensky. This strongly suggests the subject is a person of significance in Russian history or culture.\n    *   **Description:** \"a joy-discovering sailor\" points to an explorer or diplomat involved in maritime voyages.\n    *   **Lost Grave:** The line \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" indicates that the person's burial site was unknown for a long time.\n    *   **Discovery Date:** The grave's location was found in the \"late 1980s.\"\n\n2.  **Synthesize and Identify:**\n    *   Andrei Voznesensky is famous for writing the libretto for the Russian rock opera *Juno and Avos*.\n    *   The protagonist of *Juno and Avos* is Nikolai Rezanov, a Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer. He undertook a mission to establish relations with Spanish California and Russian America.\n    *   Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His original grave was in a cathedral that was destroyed in the 1930s, and its location was lost.\n    *   The grave was rediscovered in the late 1970s and a memorial was erected, with the rediscovery gaining significant public attention during the late Soviet era (Perestroika in the late 1980s), aligning perfectly with the clues.\n\n3.  **Code Generation:**\n    *   The last name is \"Rezanov\".\n    *   To fulfill the prompt's unique requirement of using an \"equation with numbers,\" I will construct the name \"Rezanov\" by using the ASCII character codes for each letter. I will then print the \"equation\" showing this construction, followed by the final name.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. The clues provided point to Nikolai Rezanov, the protagonist of Andrei Voznesensky's rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n# 2. The task is to provide his last name.\n# 3. To meet the special requirement of an \"equation with numbers\", I will construct the name using the ASCII values of its letters.\n\n# Define the ASCII values for each character in the last name \"Rezanov\".\nchar_codes = {\n    'R': 82,\n    'e': 101,\n    'z': 122,\n    'a': 97,\n    'n': 110,\n    'o': 111,\n    'v': 118\n}\n\n# Construct the equation string for printing.\nequation_parts = [f\"chr({code})\" for code in char_codes.values()]\nequation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\nprint(\"The 'equation' to form the name from the character codes of its letters:\")\nprint(equation_str)\n\n# Build the final name by converting each code back to a character.\nlast_name = \"\"\nfor code in char_codes.values():\n    last_name += chr(code)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe final name is:\")\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
