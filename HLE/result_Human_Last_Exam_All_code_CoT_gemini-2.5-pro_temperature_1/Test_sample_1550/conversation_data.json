    "To find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics, we need to find the number of real solutions (x, y) to the system of equations:\n1. `164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0`\n2. `864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0`\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Simplify each of the two quadratic equations by completing the square. This will transform the equations into a more manageable form, revealing that they are both ellipses.\n2.  Introduce a linear change of variables based on the simplified form of the first equation. This will simplify the system of equations further.\n3.  Solve the resulting system by substitution. This will lead to a single quartic (4th degree) polynomial equation in one variable.\n4.  The number of real roots of this quartic polynomial that fall within a specific valid range will correspond to the number of real intersection points.\n5.  I will use Python with the NumPy library to find the roots of the polynomial numerically and count how many of them are valid. Each valid root corresponds to a unique real intersection point.\n\nThe provided Python code will execute these steps and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of real intersection points between the two given quadrics\n    by following an analytical approach and solving the resulting polynomial numerically.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The initial equations are:\n    # Eq1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    # Eq2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n\n    # Step 1: By completing the square, the equations can be rewritten as:\n    # Eq1: 2*(x-4)^2 + 18*(2*y-3*x)^2 = 1\n    # Eq2: 8/9*(x-9/2)^2 + (9*y - 44/3*x + 9/2)^2 = 1\n    # This shows both curves are ellipses.\n\n    # Step 2: Let's introduce a change of variables L1 = x - 4 and M1 = 2*y - 3*x.\n    # The first equation becomes: 2*L1^2 + 18*M1^2 = 1.\n    # For M1 to be a real number, we must have 1 - 2*L1^2 >= 0, which means L1^2 <= 0.5.\n    \n    # Step 3: By substituting the new variables into the second equation and simplifying,\n    # we arrive at a system of two equations.
