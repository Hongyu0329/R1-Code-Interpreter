    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Model the Cubes in a Coordinate System**\nFirst, I'll place the two cubes in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system.\n*   **Cube 1**: A unit cube with side length 1 can be conveniently placed with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and its sides aligned with the x, y, and z axes. This cube occupies the space where `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`, `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`, and `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n*   **Cube 2**: The main diagonal of the first cube connects the origin (0,0,0) to the opposite corner (1,1,1). A shift of 1/2 along this diagonal means shifting the cube by the vector `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. Therefore, the second cube occupies the space where `0+1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1+1/2`, `0+1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1+1/2`, and `0+1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1+1/2`. This simplifies to `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`, `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`, and `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`.\n\n**2. Determine the Shape and Size of the Intersection**\nThe intersection is the volume where the two cubes overlap. A point `(x, y, z)` is in the intersection if it satisfies the conditions for both cubes.\n*   For the x-coordinate: `0 ≤ x ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2` which means `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`.\n*   For the y-coordinate: `0 ≤ y ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2` which means `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`.\n*   For the z-coordinate: `0 ≤ z ≤ 1` AND `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2` which means `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`.\n\nThe intersection is itself a cube with a side length of `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n\n**3. Calculate the Volume**\nThe volume of a cube is the side length cubed.\n*   Volume = `(1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8`.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the properties of the cubes based on the problem description.\ncube_side_length = 1.0\nshift_distance = 0.5\n\n# The first cube occupies the interval [0, 1] on each axis.\n# The second cube is shifted, occupying the interval [0.5, 1.5] on each axis.\n\n# To find the intersection, we determine the overlapping interval for any given axis.\n# The start of the overlap is the maximum of the two starting points.\noverlap_start = max(0.0, shift_distance)\n\n# The end of the overlap is the minimum of the two ending points.\noverlap_end = min(cube_side_length, cube_side_length + shift_distance)\n\n# The side length of the resulting intersection cube is the length of this overlap.\nintersection_side_length = overlap_end - overlap_start\n\n# The volume of the intersection is its side length cubed.\nvolume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n\nprint(\"Step 1: The two cubes are defined as:\")\nprint(f\"Cube 1: 0 <= x,y,z <= {cube_side_length}\")\nprint(f\"Cube 2: {shift_distance} <= x,y,z <= {cube_side_length + shift_distance}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"Step 2: The intersection is a smaller cube with side length:\")\nprint(f\"Side Length = min({cube_side_length}, {cube_side_length + shift_distance}) - max(0.0, {shift_distance}) = {intersection_side_length}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"Step 3: The volume is the side length cubed. The final equation is:\")\n# The final equation with each number printed, as requested.\nprint(f\"{intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} * {intersection_side_length} = {volume}\")\n```\n<<<0.125>>>"
