    # Question 1: How many lines of code have compiler errors?
    # Analysis:
    # 1. line 3: `unsigned long long` is not a valid type in XVM's C. The largest type is `long`.
    # 2. line 4: `scanf` uses "%d" (for `digit`) for variables that should be `unsigned long`. The format specifier is incorrect.
    # 3. line 9: `printf` uses "%d" (for `digit`) to print a result that is of type `unsigned long`. The format specifier is incorrect.
    # Total lines with errors = 3.
    compiler_errors = 3

    # Question 2: Rewrite for least memory and statements. What is the total memory (in D) used for variables?
    # Analysis:
    # The optimal rewrite uses the ceiling formula (n + a - 1) / a to avoid branching.
    # To minimize memory, we choose the smallest suitable types:
    # - n, m (up to 4*10^9) require `unsigned long` (12D).
    # - a (up to 10^6) fits in `unsigned int` (6D).
    # The minimal set of variables needed are n, m, and a.
    # Total memory = sizeof(n) + sizeof(m) + sizeof(a) = 12 + 12 + 6 = 30D.
    min_memory_in_D = 30

    # Question 3: Can this problem be solved without branching statements?
    # Analysis:
    # Yes, by using integer arithmetic to calculate the ceiling of a division:
    # ceil(n / a) is equivalent to (n + a - 1) / a. This avoids `if` statements.
    can_be_solved_without_branching = 'Y'

    # Question 4: What is the expected output for m = n = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
    # Analysis:
    # The calculation is performed on XVM, where `unsigned long` is 12D.
    # The maximum value for a 12D unsigned integer is 10^12 - 1.
    # Operations are performed modulo 10^12.
    n = 4 * 10**9
    m = 4 * 10**9
    a = 1

    # Number of stones needed for each dimension
    # Using integer division // which is equivalent to C's integer division
    na = (n + a - 1) // a
    ma = (m + a - 1) // a

    # The final equation and its numbers
    print(f"The final equation is: na * ma")
    print(f"The numbers in the equation are: na = {na}, ma = {ma}")

    # The full result before considering XVM limitations
    full_result = na * ma

    # The modulus for a 12D unsigned integer
    xvm_modulus = 10**12

    # The final result after overflow on XVM
    xvm_output = full_result % xvm_modulus

    # Print the final combined answer in the required format
    print("\nFinal Answer:")
    print(f"{compiler_errors}:{min_memory_in_D}:{can_be_solved_without_branching}:{xvm_output}")
