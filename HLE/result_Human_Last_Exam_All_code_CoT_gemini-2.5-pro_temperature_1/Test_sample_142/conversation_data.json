    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for a full CI calculation, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine System Parameters**: We first need to find the total number of electrons ($N_{elec}$) and the number of spatial orbitals ($N_{orb}$) for the molecule $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$ with the 6-31G** basis set.\n    *   The number of electrons is the sum of electrons from each atom: C(6) + H(1) * 2 + Si(14) + H(1) + F(9) = 32 electrons.\n    *   The number of orbitals corresponds to the total number of basis functions. This can be calculated accurately using a computational chemistry library like `pyscf`.\n2.  **Determine Spin State**: For a stable, even-electron molecule like this, the ground state is a singlet. Therefore, the total spin quantum number, S, is 0.\n3.  **Apply the CSF Formula**: We will use the Weyl-Paldus formula to calculate the number of CSFs for a given $N_{elec}$, $N_{orb}$, and S:\n    $N_{CSF} = \\frac{2S+1}{N_{orb}+1} \\binom{N_{orb}+1}{\\frac{N_{elec}}{2} - S} \\binom{N_{orb}+1}{\\frac{N_{elec}}{2} + S}$\n    We will implement this calculation in a Python script. The script will first determine the exact number of orbitals using `pyscf` and then compute the final count.\n\nThe following Python code carries out this plan.\n\n```python\n# This script requires the pyscf library.\n# You can install it by running: pip install pyscf\n\nimport math\ntry:\n    from pyscf import gto\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"PySCF not found.
