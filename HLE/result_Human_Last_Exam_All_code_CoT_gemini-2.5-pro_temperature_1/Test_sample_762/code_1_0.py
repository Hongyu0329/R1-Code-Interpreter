    # 2. We can process 16 iterations in parallel on the 16 units.
    # 3. We can model the problem as processing batches of iterations.
    # 4. Total iterations = 1000. Batch size = 16.

    # 6. Number of iterations in the last partial batch = 1000 % 16 = 8.

    # 7. Time for the full batches:
    #    The first 62 batches (992 iterations) can be perfectly pipelined.

    #    Time = Total Ops / Parallel Units = 3968 / 16 = 248 cycles.

    # 8. Time for the final partial batch:
    #    After 248 cycles, the work for the first 992 iterations is done.
    #    The last 8 iterations still need to be processed.
    #    Because of the dependency chain (Load -> Mul -> Add -> Store), this last batch
    #    will take 4 cycles to complete, as each stage must follow the previous one.
