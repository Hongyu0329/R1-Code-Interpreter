    # Information breakdown
    # CA biotype: Watermelon-adapted, does well on raffinose-rich diet.
    # MA biotype: Cotton-adapted, does well on sucrose-only diet.
    # Implication: Watermelon has high raffinose; Cotton has high sucrose and low raffinose.
    # Key enzyme: Galactosidase is needed to metabolize raffinose.

    # Statement A Analysis
    print("Statement A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("  - Fact: CA thrives on a raffinose-rich diet, while MA thrives on a sucrose-only diet.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This indicates CA is better adapted to metabolize raffinose (an RFO). So, A is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement B Analysis
    print("Statement B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("  - Fact: The text says each biotype 'did well on' these respective diets.")
    print("  - Conclusion: 'Doing well' is a direct reflection of adaptation and preference. So, B is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement C Analysis
    print("Statement C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Fact: CA moves from high-raffinose (watermelon) to low-raffinose (cotton). Galactosidase digests raffinose.")
    print("  - Principle: Enzyme activity often decreases when its substrate (raffinose) is less available.")
    print("  - Conclusion: This is a direct and logical biological explanation. So, C is TRUE.\n")

    # Statement D Analysis
    print("Statement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("  - Fact: This statement suggests the same outcome as C but for a different reason.")
    print("  - Principle: The most direct cause for a change in galactosidase activity is the change in its substrate, raffinose. While glucose levels can influence metabolism, it's not the primary reason for galactosidase regulation.")
    print("  - Conclusion: Since C provides the correct and most direct reason, this statement's reasoning is incorrect. So, D is NOT TRUE.\n")

    # Statement E Analysis
    print("Statement E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("  - Fact: MA moves from low-raffinose (cotton) to high-raffinose (watermelon).")
    print("  - Principle: Increased availability of a substrate (raffinose) typically induces higher activity of the corresponding enzyme (galactosidase).")
    print("  - Conclusion: This is a logical biological explanation. So, E is TRUE.\n")
