    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will create a Python script to analyze the training methods of the ballet schools listed. The script will store information about each school's approach to pointe work and then identify the one known for emphasizing barre work in pointe shoes. Finally, it will print the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_school():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the training methods of famous ballet schools to determine\n    which is known for extensive barre work in pointe shoes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    schools = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'La Scala Theatre Ballet School',\n            'method': 'Primarily Cecchetti method.
