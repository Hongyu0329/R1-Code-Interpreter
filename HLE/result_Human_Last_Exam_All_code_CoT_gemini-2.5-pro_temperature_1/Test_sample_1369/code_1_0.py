    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Laplacian Eigenvalues ---
    # In spectral graph theory, the number of connected components (k) of a graph
    # is equal to the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 in the spectrum of its Laplacian matrix.
    
    eigenvalues_start = [0.0, 0.0]
    
    # The problem provides the start of the eigenvalue sequence as [0.0, 0.0, ...].
    # This implies that the first and second eigenvalues are 0. The standard interpretation
    # is that the third eigenvalue is non-zero, otherwise, more zeros would have been provided.
    # Therefore, the multiplicity of the eigenvalue 0 is exactly 2.
    k = eigenvalues_start.count(0.0)

    # --- Step 2: Analyze the Incidence Matrix Information ---
    # The nullity of B^T*B, where B is the incidence matrix, is equal to the
    # graph's cyclomatic number (mu). The cyclomatic number represents the number
    # of independent cycles in the graph.

    mu = nullity_BtB

    # The cyclomatic number is also defined by the formula: mu = m - n + k
    # where m is the number of edges, n is the number of vertices, and k is the number of components.
    # We use this to check for consistency with our finding from Step 1.
