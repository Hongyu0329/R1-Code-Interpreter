    "Here is a step-by-step deduction to determine the structure and IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: Determine the degree of unsaturation from the formula $C_7H_{14}$.\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**: Interpret the given chemical shifts and multiplicities (s, d, t, q) to identify the types of carbon atoms and key functional groups present in the molecule.\n3.  **Construct the Structure**: Use the information from the first two steps to assemble the carbon skeleton. We have 7 carbons in total but only 6 NMR signals, which indicates that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent.\n4.  **Verify the Structure**: Propose a candidate structure and check if its predicted $^{13}C$ NMR spectrum is consistent with the experimental data.\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**: Name the confirmed structure according to IUPAC nomenclature rules.\n\n### Execution\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the chemical structure puzzle based on the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    It prints the step-by-step reasoning and the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Given Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    c13_nmr_shifts = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"--- Step-by-Step Analysis ---\")\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n    print(\"\\n1.
