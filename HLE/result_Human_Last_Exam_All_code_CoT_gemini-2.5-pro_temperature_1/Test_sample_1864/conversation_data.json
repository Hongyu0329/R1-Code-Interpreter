    "For a successful and well-controlled flow cytometry sorting experiment, it's crucial to prepare a set of controls to ensure proper instrument setup, accurate data interpretation, and valid sorting. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of essential controls for your experiment.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Core Experimental Parameters:** The experiment uses 5 distinct fluorescence channels (AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, AF750) and involves a streptavidin-based reagent, likely for detecting a biotinylated antibody. The goal is sorting, which requires very precise gating.\n\n2.  **List Essential Control Types:**\n    *   **Unstained Control:** This sample contains only the cells or beads without any fluorescent dye. It is fundamental for determining the baseline autofluorescence and setting initial detector voltages.\n    *   **Single-Stain Compensation Controls:** To correct for spectral overlap (spillover) where the signal from one fluorophore bleeds into another's detector. You need one separate control for each of the 5 fluorophores in your panel.\n    *   **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** These controls are critical for accurate gating, especially in a sorting experiment. An FMO control contains all stains *except for one*. This helps you see the fluorescence spread from other channels into your channel of interest, allowing you to set a precise gate for your positive population. You should prepare an FMO control for each of the 5 fluorophores.\n    *   **Streptavidin Reagent Control:** Since your experiment involves streptavidin, you need to check if the fluorescently-labeled streptavidin reagent binds non-specifically to your cells/beads. This control tube would contain your sample plus the streptavidin reagent, but without the biotinylated antibody it's supposed to detect.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total:** I will write a Python script that calculates the number of controls for each category and then sums them to provide the total number of essential control tubes to prepare. The script will print out the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry\n    sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define experiment parameters based on the user's question\n    fluorophores = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_channels = len(fluorophores)\n    uses_streptavidin_reagent = True  # Based on the mention of \"Streptavidin beads\"\n\n    # 2. Calculate the number of each essential control type\n    \n    # Unstained control: For setting baseline autofluorescence\n    unstained_control_count = 1\n    \n    # Single-stain controls: For compensation (one for each fluorophore)\n    compensation_control_count = num_channels\n    \n    # FMO controls: For accurate gating in sorting (one for each fluorophore)\n    fmo_control_count = num_channels\n    \n    # Streptavidin reagent control: To check for non-specific binding of the streptavidin\n    streptavidin_reagent_control_count = 1 if uses_streptavidin_reagent else 0\n    \n    # 3. Sum the counts to get the total\n    total_controls = (unstained_control_count + \n                      compensation_control_count + \n                      fmo_control_count + \n                      streptavidin_reagent_control_count)\n\n    # 4. Print the breakdown and the final equation\n    print(\"To perform a robust 5-color sorting experiment with a streptavidin system, you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Unstained Controls: {unstained_control_count}\")\n    print(f\"Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {compensation_control_count} (one for each fluorophore)\")\n    print(f\"Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_control_count} (for accurate gating)\")\n    print(f\"Streptavidin Reagent Control: {streptavidin_reagent_control_count} (for non-specific binding)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    # Final equation as requested\n    print(\"Total Essential Controls Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Unstained ({unstained_control_count}) + Compensation ({compensation_control_count}) + FMO ({fmo_control_count}) + Streptavidin ({streptavidin_reagent_control_count}) = {total_controls}\")\n\ncalculate_flow_controls()\n<<<12>>>\n```"
