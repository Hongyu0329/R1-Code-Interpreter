    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  I will break down the user's question into key clues.\n    *   It is an island town.\n    *   It is extremely remote (\"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\").\n    *   It is situated on a bay.\n    *   The bay is associated with a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town and the bay share the same name.\n2.  I will evaluate famous remote islands against these clues.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha**: The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. This name does not match the island's name or any bay, so it's not a match.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: The main town is Hanga Roa. It is extremely remote, over 2,000 km from the nearest inhabited land (Pitcairn Islands). The town sits on Hanga Roa Bay. The town and bay names match. Easter Island is a volcanic island famous for its calderas (like at Rano Kau). The bay's location is a direct result of this volcanic geography. This fits all the clues.\n3.  Based on this analysis, the answer is Hanga Roa.\n4.  I will write a simple Python script to store this answer in a variable and then print it, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes a unique geographical location.\n# Clue 1: An island town more than 500 km from another inhabited island.\n# This points to one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth.\n# Clue 2: It sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n# This indicates the island is of volcanic origin.\n# Clue 3: The bay shares the town's name.\n# This is a very specific clue that helps pinpoint the location.\n#\n# The location that fits all these descriptions is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n# - Easter Island is over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands, its nearest inhabited neighbor.\n# - The island is entirely volcanic, with a famous caldera at Rano Kau.\n# - The main town, Hanga Roa, is located on a bay also named Hanga Roa.\n\nisland_town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n\nprint(f\"The island town described is: {island_town_name}\")\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
