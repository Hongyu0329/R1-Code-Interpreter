    "Of course. Designing a secure threshold signature scheme involves advanced cryptography. The following Python code demonstrates the design of a **t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme** with a **two-round signing protocol**.\n\n### Plan Explanation\n\nThis design is conceptually based on the principles of **BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signatures** and **Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS)**. To make the concepts clear without requiring complex cryptographic libraries, we will simulate the underlying elliptic curve group using simple modular arithmetic.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the code:\n\n1.  **Setup (Trusted Dealer):** A trusted entity will set up the system.\n    *   It defines the parameters `n` (total participants) and `t` (threshold).\n    *   It creates a secret polynomial of degree `t-1`. The master secret key (`sk`) is the polynomial's value at x=0. The master public key (`PK`) is derived from `sk`.\n    *   It computes a secret share for each of the `n` participants by evaluating the polynomial at their respective index (`i`).\n\n2.  **Two-Round Signing Protocol:** When `t` or more participants want to sign a message:\n    *   **Round 1 (Commit):** Each signing participant computes their *partial signature* using their secret share and the message hash. Instead of broadcasting it directly, they broadcast a cryptographic hash (a \"commitment\") of their partial signature. This commits them to a specific value without revealing it yet.\n    *   **Round 2 (Reveal):** After receiving commitments from all other signers, each participant broadcasts their actual partial signature. The aggregator (or other participants) can verify that the revealed signature matches the commitment from Round 1. This prevents any participant from changing their value after seeing what others have produced.\n\n3.  **Signature Aggregation:** An aggregator collects at least `t` valid partial signatures. Using a mathematical technique called **Lagrange Interpolation**, it combines these partial signatures to reconstruct the final, single signature valid under the master public key.\n\n4.  **Verification:** Finally, anyone can verify the reconstructed signature against the master public key and the message. The code will demonstrate this final check.\n\nThe following script implements this entire flow, printing out each step and the numbers involved in the final signature equation.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\ndef design_threshold_signature_scheme():\n    \"\"\"\n    Designs and demonstrates a 2-round t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme.\n    \"\"\"\n    # I.
