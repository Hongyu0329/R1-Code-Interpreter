    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nMy plan is to first identify the specific scene in the \"Teen Girl Squad #15\" episode of Homestar Runner. Then, I will determine the name of the fictional musical act represented by the cardboard cutout at the prom. Finally, I will write a Python script to print this information as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_prom_singer():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the fictional singer\n  whose cardboard cutout performs at the prom in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n  \"\"\"\n  episode_number = 15\n  event = \"Junior prom\"\n  performer_type = \"cardboard cutout\"\n  \n  # The fictional hair metal band in the Homestar Runner universe\n  singer_name = \"Limozeen\"\n  \n  print(f\"In the online cartoon series \\\"Homestar Runner\\\", episode \\\"Teen Girl Squad #{episode_number}\\\",\")\n  print(f\"a {performer_type} of the fictional band {singer_name} performs at the {event}.\")\n\nfind_prom_singer()\n```\n<<<Limozeen>>>"
