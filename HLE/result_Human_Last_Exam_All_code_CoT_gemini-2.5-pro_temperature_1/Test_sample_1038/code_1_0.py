# The user wants to understand which design strategy is best.
# This does not require code to solve, but rather a logical analysis of trade-offs in analog circuit design.
# I have performed the analysis above. The final step is to formally state the conclusion.

# Plan:
# 1. Re-state the core problem: Balancing fast reset (low resistance) with stable operation (high resistance) at low voltage.
# 2. Briefly dismiss options A, B, D, and E based on the analysis.
#    - A: Fails on stability and high-resistance goal.
#    - B: Adds noise and complexity.
#    - D: Fundamentally wrong for a pseudo-resistor application.
#    - E: Does not solve the core leakage problem.
# 3. Champion option C as the correct answer.
# 4. Explain *why* C is the best choice: It uses body-biasing to dynamically change the transistor's threshold voltage (Vt), making it optimal for both the reset phase (low Vt -> high current) and the operate phase (high Vt -> very low current/leakage). This directly and effectively addresses the central conflict of the design.
# 5. Print the final answer choice.

print("     1. Subthreshold current drops exponentially, enabling extremely high, stable resistance for sub-Hz filtering.")
