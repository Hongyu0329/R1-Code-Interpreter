    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  The integral is for a piecewise function $p(x)$ over the range from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n2.  The function's definition changes at $x=3$. Therefore, I must split the integral into two parts:\n    *   The first integral from $x=0$ to $x=3$ using the function definition $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$.\n    *   The second integral from $x=3$ to $x=4$ using the function definition $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x}$.\n3.  I will write a Python script to perform these integrations numerically.\n4.  The script will use the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library, which is a standard and highly accurate method for numerical integration.\n5.  The script will calculate the value of each integral separately.\n6.  Finally, it will add the two results together to get the total integral from $x=0$ to $x=4$ and print the final equation showing the two intermediate results and their sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# This script calculates the definite integral of a piecewise function from x=0 to x=4.\n\n# Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\ndef p_part1(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the function p(x) for 0 <= x <= 3.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n# Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\ndef p_part2(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the function p(x) for 3 <= x <= 5.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Note: np.cos(x) can be -1 at x = pi, which is approx 3.14159.\n  # This value is within the integration range [3, 4], so we must handle potential division by zero.\n  # However, quad can often handle singularities at the boundaries.\n  return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# Set the integration limits for the two parts\nlower_bound1, mid_point, upper_bound2 = 0, 3, 4\n\n# Calculate the integral for the first part\n# The result of quad is a tuple (integral_value, estimated_error)\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p_part1, lower_bound1, mid_point)\n\n# Calculate the integral for the second part\nintegral2, error2 = quad(p_part2, mid_point, upper_bound2)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral1 + integral2\n\n# Print the final result as an equation\nprint(f\"The integral is split into two parts at x=3:\")\nprint(f\"Integral from {lower_bound1} to {mid_point}: {integral1}\")\nprint(f\"Integral from {mid_point} to {upper_bound2}: {integral2}\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {integral1} + ({integral2}) = {total_integral}\")\n```\n<<<-397.46934578575655>>>"
