# Step 1: Deconstruct the problem statement.
# The problem uses abstract concepts from representation theory. The key is to
# interpret the non-standard phrases "tame functor" and "n-resolvable"
# within the standard framework of the theory.

# Step 2: Interpret the conditions.
# The existence of the finite poset I and the exact functor f^k allows us to
# analyze the properties of F within the representation theory of the finite-dimensional
# algebra A = K[I] (the incidence algebra of I).
# "F is a tame functor" is interpreted as F being an indecomposable regular module,
# which is the hallmark of a tame representation type.
# "F is n-resolvable" is interpreted as the projective dimension of F being n.

# Step 3: Solve the simplified problem.
# The problem reduces to finding the projective dimension of an indecomposable
# regular module over a tame algebra.
# For the foundational class of tame hereditary algebras (like the Kronecker algebra),
# the global dimension is 1. Regular modules are, by definition, not projective.
# Therefore, their projective dimension must be exactly 1.
# This result is central to the understanding of tame representation theory.

# Step 4: Final Equation.
# Based on this reasoning, the value of n is 1.
# The final equation is n = 1.
n = 1

# Print the numbers in the final equation as requested.
print("The equation is n = 1.")
print("The value of n is:")
