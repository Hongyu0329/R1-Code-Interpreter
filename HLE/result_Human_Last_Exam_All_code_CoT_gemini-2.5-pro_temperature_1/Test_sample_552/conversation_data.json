    "To answer this question, I will research the citations and intellectual foundations of Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, \"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\". The plan is to identify the key scientific figures whose work, particularly lectures or published lecture notes, directly influenced Einstein's formulation of the theory. The final answer will be presented in a Python script using a print statement.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lectures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the scientist whose lectures\n    were foundational to Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion was largely theoretical and did not\n    # contain a formal bibliography as is common in modern papers.
