    "To find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Representations and Partitions:** The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the integer partitions of $n$. An integer partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, like $4 = 3+1$. So, our first task is to find all partitions of $n=25$.\n\n2.  **Dimension Calculation:** For each partition $\\lambda$ of $n$, the dimension of the corresponding irrep is given by the hook-length formula. This formula states that the dimension is $n!$ divided by the product of the \"hook lengths\" of all the boxes in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$. The hook length of a box is the number of boxes to its right, plus the number of boxes below it, plus the box itself.\n\n3.  **Counting:** We will iterate through all partitions of 25. For each partition, we will calculate the dimension of its irrep using the hook-length formula. We'll then check if this dimension is strictly less than 500,000. We will keep a count of how many partitions satisfy this condition.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It generates all partitions, calculates the dimension for each, and counts those that meet the criterion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef generate_partitions(n, max_val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all integer partitions of n where each part is at most max_val.\n    The partitions are generated as lists of integers in descending order.\n    This is a recursive generator function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        yield []\n        return\n\n    # The first part of the partition can be any integer from 1 to min(n, max_val).\n    # We iterate downwards to generate partitions in lexicographical order.\n    for first_part in range(min(n, max_val), 0, -1):\n        # Recursively find partitions for the remainder of n.\n        # The next part cannot be larger than the current first_part.\n        for sub_partition in generate_partitions(n - first_part, first_part):\n            yield [first_part] + sub_partition\n\ndef calculate_irrep_dimension(partition):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the irreducible representation of S_n corresponding\n    to the given partition using the hook-length formula.\n    \n    The formula is dim(V_lambda) = n! / product(hook_lengths).\n    \"\"\"\n    n = sum(partition)\n    \n    # Calculate the numerator, n!\n    try:\n        n_factorial = math.factorial(n)\n    except ValueError:\n        # n must be non-negative.\n        return 0\n\n    # Calculate the denominator, which is the product of all hook lengths.\n    hook_product = 1\n    for i, row_len in enumerate(partition):\n        for j in range(row_len):\n            # The box is at position (row i, column j) in the Young diagram.\n            \n            # Count boxes to the right of the current box in the same row.\n            hooks_right = row_len - 1 - j\n            \n            # Count boxes below the current box in the same column.\n            hooks_below = 0\n            for k in range(i + 1, len(partition)):\n                if partition[k] > j:\n                    hooks_below += 1\n            \n            # The hook length is the sum of hooks_right, hooks_below, and 1 for the box itself.\n            hook_length = hooks_right + hooks_below + 1\n            hook_product *= hook_length\n\n    # The dimension must be an integer, so we use integer division.\n    if hook_product == 0:\n        return 0 # Should not happen for a valid partition\n        \n    dimension = n_factorial // hook_product\n    return dimension\n\ndef solve_s25_irreps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of irreps of S_25 with\n    dimension less than a given limit.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 25\n    DIMENSION_LIMIT = 500000\n    \n    count = 0\n    \n    # Generate all partitions of N.\n    partition_generator = generate_partitions(N, N)\n    \n    # Iterate through each partition, calculate its dimension, and check against the limit.\n    for p in partition_generator:\n        dimension = calculate_irrep_dimension(p)\n        if dimension < DIMENSION_LIMIT:\n            count += 1\n            \n    print(f\"The number of irreducible representations of S_{N} with a dimension strictly less than {DIMENSION_LIMIT} is: {count}\")\n\n# Run the solver function.\nsolve_s25_irreps()\n```\n<<<114>>>"
