    Analyzes the provided statements about Saint Augustine's philosophy and identifies the incorrect one.

    The incorrect statement is B. Medieval historian R. A. Markus did argue that Augustine's view of freedom was "asymmetrical," but he did not ignore the concepts of predestination and grace. On the contrary, his argument about asymmetry is fundamentally dependent on the role of grace in Augustine's theology. A human is free to sin on their own, but requires grace to freely choose good, which creates the asymmetry. Therefore, claiming Markus ignored these concepts is a misrepresentation of his work.
