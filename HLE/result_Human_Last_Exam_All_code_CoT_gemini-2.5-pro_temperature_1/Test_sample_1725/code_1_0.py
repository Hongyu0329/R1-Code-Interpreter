    This function calculates the dimension of the bundle's fibers and the number of coefficients for the energy functional.
    
    Part A: Dimension of the fibers of pi
    The field C is a connection on the tangent bundle T(R^3). For a crystal with a metric,
    the structure group is reduced from GL(3,R) to SO(3). The connection C is a 1-form
    with values in the Lie algebra so(3).
    - Dimension of the space of 1-forms on R^3 is 3.
    - Dimension of the Lie algebra so(3) is 3.
    - The dimension of the fiber is the product: 3 * 3 = 9.
    
    Part B: Number of coefficients specifying E
    The energy E is a quadratic scalar in the linearized curvature R = dC, invariant under
    the cubic group on spacetime indices and isotropic in the internal so(3) algebra space.
    - The curvature R can be written with components R^a_m, where 'a' is the algebra index (1,2,3)
      and 'm' is the spacetime 2-form index (1,2,3).
    - The general quadratic energy is E = K_{ab}^{mn} * R^a_m * R^b_n.
    - Isotropy in the internal space forces K_{ab}^{mn} = delta_{ab} * K_tilde^{mn}.
    - Cubic symmetry on the spacetime indices forces the symmetric tensor K_tilde^{mn} to be
      proportional to delta_{mn}.
    - Thus, E = c * sum_{a,m} (R^a_m)^2.
    - There is only one independent coefficient, c.
