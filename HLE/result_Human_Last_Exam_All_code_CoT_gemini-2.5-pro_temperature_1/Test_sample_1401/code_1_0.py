    This function explains and provides the theoretical lower bound for the number of
    Statistical Queries (SQ) required to learn a class of neural networks.
    The problem is as follows:
    - Algorithm Type: Statistical Query (SQ)
    - Function Class: poly(d)-sized two-hidden-layer ReLU networks
    - Data Distribution: N(0, I_d), standard d-dimensional Gaussian
    - Goal: Achieve squared loss of 1/poly(d)
    - Query Tolerance (tau): Not negligible, i.e., >= 1/poly(d)

    The calculation is based on established theoretical results from computational learning theory.
