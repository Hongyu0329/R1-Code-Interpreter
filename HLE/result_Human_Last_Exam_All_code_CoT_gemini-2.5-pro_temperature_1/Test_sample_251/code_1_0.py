# A program to calculate the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks for an iterated Lagrangian lift.

# 1. Base Case: The Chekanov Torus in CP^2
# The Chekanov torus is a specific monotone Lagrangian submanifold in the complex
# projective plane (CP^2). It is a well-known result in symplectic geometry that
# the number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks with boundary on the Chekanov torus is 2.
n_initial = 2
disk_count_initial = 2

print(f"Starting object: Chekanov torus in CP^{n_initial}")
print(f"Initial number of Maslov 2 disks: {disk_count_initial}")
print("-" * 50)

# 2. Recursive Step: The Biran Lift
# The Biran lift is a construction that takes a Lagrangian L in CP^n to a new
# Lagrangian Sigma(L) in CP^{n+1}. This operation adds exactly one new class of
# Maslov 2 holomorphic disks. Thus, the number of disks increases by 1 at each step.
# We apply this rule twice.

# First Lift: from CP^2 to CP^3
n_step1_start = 2
disk_count_step1_start = disk_count_initial

n_step1_end = 3
disk_count_step1_end = disk_count_step1_start + 1

print(f"Applying the first lift (from CP^{n_step1_start} to CP^{n_step1_end})...")
print(f"The number of disks is calculated by adding 1 to the previous count.")
print(f"Calculation: {disk_count_step1_end} = {disk_count_step1_start} + 1")
print(f"Number of disks after first lift: {disk_count_step1_end}")
print("-" * 50)


# Second Lift: from CP^3 to CP^4
n_step2_start = 3
disk_count_step2_start = disk_count_step1_end

n_step2_end = 4
disk_count_step2_end = disk_count_step2_start + 1

print(f"Applying the second lift (from CP^{n_step2_start} to CP^{n_step2_end})...")
print(f"The number of disks is again calculated by adding 1.")
print(f"Final Calculation: {disk_count_step2_end} = {disk_count_step2_start} + 1")
print("-" * 50)

# 3. Final Answer
print(f"The final number of Maslov 2 holomorphic disks is: {disk_count_step2_end}")
