# The problem is to find the number of group structures of order 7.
# The formula for this is n! / |Aut(G)|, where n=7 and G is the cyclic group C_7.
# |Aut(C_7)| is given by Euler's totient function, phi(7), which is 6.

n = 7
numerator = math.factorial(n)
denominator = 6  # phi(7) = 7 - 1 = 6

result = numerator // denominator

print(f"The function foo(7) calculates the number of distinct group structures of order 7.")
print(f"The formula is n! / phi(n), where n=7.")
print(f"The calculation is: {n}! / {denominator} = {numerator} / {denominator} = {result}")
