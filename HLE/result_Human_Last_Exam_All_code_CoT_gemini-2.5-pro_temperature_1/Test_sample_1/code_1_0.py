# Step 1: Find c1
# The reciprocal/inverse concept to "logical depth" from complex systems theory,
# associated with Charles Bennett, is "crypticity".
word1 = "crypticity"
c1 = word1[2]  # The third letter is 'y'.

# Step 2: Find c2
# The missing word in Murray Gell-Mann's quote, "the two _ didn't commute,"
# referring to his choices, is "options".
word2 = "options"
c2 = word2[2]  # The third character is 't'.

# Step 3 & 4: Find c3 and c4
# The paper "Gaussian Error Linear Units (GELUs)" was authored by Dan Hendrycks and Kevin Gimpel.
# The last author's last name is "Gimpel".
last_name = "Gimpel"
c3 = last_name[-1]  # The last letter is 'l'.

# ROT13 is a cipher that replaces a letter with the one 13 places after it in the alphabet.
# ROT13 of 'l' is 'y'.
c4 = codecs.encode(c3, 'rot_13')

# Step 5: Find c5
# This step requires comparing the mass of Mars to that of Earth and the Moon.
# The "equation" is the comparison of mass differences.
mass_earth = 5.972e24  # kg
mass_mars = 0.641e24   # kg
mass_moon = 0.073e24   # kg

diff_mars_earth = abs(mass_mars - mass_earth)
diff_mars_moon = abs(mass_mars - mass_moon)

print("Comparing the mass of Mars to the Moon and Earth:")
print(f"|Mass(Mars) - Mass(Moon)| = |{mass_mars:.3e} - {mass_moon:.3e}| = {diff_mars_moon:.3e} kg")
print(f"|Mass(Earth) - Mass(Mars)| = |{mass_earth:.3e} - {mass_mars:.3e}| = {diff_mars_earth:.3e} kg")
print("Mars is closer in mass to the Moon.")

answer_word = "Moon"
c5 = answer_word[1]  # The second letter is 'o'.

# Final Result
# Concatenate c1, c2, c4, and c5, ensuring all are lowercase.
result = (c1 + c2 + c4 + c5).lower()
