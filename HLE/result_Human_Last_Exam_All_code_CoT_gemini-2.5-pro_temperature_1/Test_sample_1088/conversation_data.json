    "To determine the number of primitive Gaussians in a 6-311G** basis set, we need to select a specific atom, as the count depends on the atom's electronic structure. Let's choose Carbon (C) as a representative heavy (non-hydrogen) atom and walk through the calculation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Basis Set Name:** I will break down the `6-311G**` notation into its components (`6`, `311`, `*`, `*`) and explain what each part signifies in terms of primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n2.  **Apply to Carbon:** I will apply this notation to the electronic structure of a Carbon atom (1s core, 2s/2p valence shells).\n3.  **Calculate Primitives for Each Shell:** I will calculate the number of PGFs for the core shell, the valence s-shell, and the valence p-shells.\n4.  **Add Polarization Functions:** I will add the PGFs from the polarization functions indicated by the `**`. For Carbon, only the first `*` (d-functions) applies.\n5.  **Sum and Display:** Finally, I will sum the numbers from all components and display the final equation and the result. For context, the calculation for a Hydrogen atom will also be briefly explained.\n\nThis Python script will perform the calculation for Carbon and print a step-by-step explanation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_basis_set_primitives():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of primitive Gaussians for a Carbon atom\n    in the 6-311G** basis set.\n    \"\"\"\n    atom_name = \"Carbon (C)\"\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of primitive Gaussians for {atom_name} in a 6-311G** basis set.\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The 6-311G** basis set notation is broken down as follows:\")\n    print(\" - '6-':       Core orbitals are described by 1 function built from 6 primitives.\")\n    print(\" - '311':      Valence orbitals are split into 3 functions, built from 3, 1, and 1 primitives respectively.\")\n    print(\" - '*' (first): A set of d-type polarization functions is added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms.\")\n    print(\" - '*' (second): A set of p-type polarization functions is added to hydrogen atoms.\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nApplying this to {atom_name}, a heavy atom with a 1s core and 2s, 2p valence shells:\")\n\n    # Core shell (1s orbital)\n    core_s = 6\n    print(f\"\\n1.
