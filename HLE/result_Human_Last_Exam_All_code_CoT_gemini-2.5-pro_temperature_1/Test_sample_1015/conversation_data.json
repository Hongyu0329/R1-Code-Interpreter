    "This question asks to identify the key difference between a *cambré derrière* (a backward bend) in the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods. To solve this, I will break down the technique of this movement in each style.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Vaganova Cambré Derrière:** I will describe the technique as taught in the Vaganova method, focusing on the source of the movement and the alignment of the body, particularly the hips and spine.\n2.  **Define Balanchine Cambré Derrière:** I will describe the technique in the Balanchine style, highlighting how it differs from the Vaganova approach to create a different aesthetic line.\n3.  **Compare the Two:** I will compare the key technical elements of both styles side-by-side.\n4.  **Evaluate Answer Choices:** I will assess the given multiple-choice options (A, B, C, D, E) against my comparison to determine the most fundamental and accurate difference.\n5.  **Construct Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this explanation step-by-step and identifies the correct answer.\n\nThe core of the difference lies in how the stability of the torso is maintained and where the bend is emphasized. This will point directly to one of the answer choices as the most foundational difference.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the difference between a cambré derrière\n    in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods and determines the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the Vaganova method for cambré derrière.\")\n    print(\"In the Vaganova method, the emphasis is on stability, control, and strength. The backbend (cambré) must initiate from the upper spine (thoracic region).\")\n    print(\"A strict rule is to keep the hips stationary and squared, directly over the feet. Pushing the hips forward is considered a technical fault as it compromises the support from the core and can strain the lower back.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Analyzing the Balanchine method for cambré derrière.\")\n    print(\"The Balanchine style prioritizes long lines, speed, and a more extreme aesthetic.\")\n    print(\"In a Balanchine cambré derrière, the dancer often presses the hips forward. This action allows for a much deeper and more dramatic backbend, creating the characteristic open, elongated line favored by Balanchine.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Comparing the two methods and evaluating the options.\")\n    print(\"The primary, most fundamental difference is the treatment of the hips.\")\n    print(\" - Vaganova: Hips are held stable and square.\")\n    print(\" - Balanchine: Hips are often pushed forward to increase the bend.\")\n    print(\"While other factors like the degree of the backbend (D) and the placement of the head (E) are also different, they are direct results of the differing hip placement. Therefore, the placement of the hip (B) is the root cause of the stylistic difference.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Choice: B. Placement of hip\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n\n<<<B>>>\n```"
