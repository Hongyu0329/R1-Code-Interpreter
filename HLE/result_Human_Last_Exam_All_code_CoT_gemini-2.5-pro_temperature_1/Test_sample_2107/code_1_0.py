    This function solves the riddle by defining the variables based on the clues,
    verifying the mathematical equation, and deducing the final value of X12.

    # Step 1: Define the values for X1 through X11 based on the clues.
    X1 = 17  # From "Seventeen Moments of Spring"
    X2 = 4   # From Pastor Shlag's parish of four
    X3 = 500 # From cement grade M500
    X4 = 4   # From Tolstoy's "three or four" writers
    X5 = 15  # From Queen Charlotte's 15 children
    X6 = 5   # From the 5 letters in "FOCUS"
    X7 = 0   # From Antigone's state between life and death
    X8 = 63  # From the 63 chromosomes of a mule (hybrid)
    X9 = 1   # From the concept of a single type of social interaction
    X10 = 0  # From Kozma Prutkov's number of sons
    X11 = 8  # From the 8 letters in "EXLIBRIS"

    # Step 2: Verify the first equation with the deciphered operators.
    # The equation is: X1's X2 + (X3 X4 - X5's X6) + X7's X4 = X8's X9
    # Interpreted as: (X1-X2) + (X3/X4 - X5*X6) + (X7*X4) = (X8*X9)

    print(f"({X1} - {X2}) + ({X3} / {X4} - {X5} * {X6}) + ({X7} * {X4}) = {X8} * {X9}")

        print("There is a mismatch in the equation.")

    # Step 3: Determine X12 from the second statement.
    # The statement "X8's X9's X10 X11 X12." implies a sequence.
    # Concatenating the numbers X8, X9, X10, X11 gives 63108.
    zip_code = f"{X8}{X9}{X10}{X11}"
    
    # This ZIP code corresponds to St. Louis, a city known for the confluence of two rivers.
