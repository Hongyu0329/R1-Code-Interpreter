# The problem is to find the numerical factor in the a_1 Seeley-DeWitt coefficient
# for a massless gauged Dirac spinor.
# The integrand of a_1 is given by tr(c1*R*I - V), where c1 is the coefficient for a scalar field.
# For a scalar field, c1 = 1/6.
# The operator D^2 has the form nabla^2 + V, where V = c2*R*I + (other terms).
# For a Dirac spinor, c2 = 1/4.
# The other terms in V involve sigma_mu_nu, which are traceless and do not contribute.
# The final numerical factor is (c1 - c2) * dim(spinor representation).
# In 4D, the dimension of the Dirac spinor representation is 4.

c1_val = Fraction(1, 6)
c2_val = Fraction(1, 4)
spinor_dim = 4

# The final coefficient for the scalar curvature R in the integrand is (c1 - c2) * spinor_dim * N
# where N is the dimension of the gauge group representation.
# The problem asks for the numerical coefficient, which we take to be the factor for N=1.
final_coeff = (c1_val - c2_val) * spinor_dim

# We need to output the numbers in the final equation
