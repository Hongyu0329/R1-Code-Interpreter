    This function determines the maximal k based on the reasoning provided.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. For k=1, the walk is a standard random walk in d>=3, which is always transient.
    2. For k=2, it is possible to construct a pair of measures and a control strategy that forces the walk to be recurrent.
       An example is to use two measures whose covariance matrices are C1 = diag(M, 1, 1, ...) and C2 = diag(1, M, 1, ...), where M is large.
       A strategy that chooses the measure with small variance in the direction of the walk's largest component can make the walk recurrent.
    3. Since for k=2 there exists a choice of measures that allows for recurrence, the condition "for ANY choice of such measures, we are not able to guarantee return" fails.
    4. Thus, the maximal k for which the condition holds is 1.
