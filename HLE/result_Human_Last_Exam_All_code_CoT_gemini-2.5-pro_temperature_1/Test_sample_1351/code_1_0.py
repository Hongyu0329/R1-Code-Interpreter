    # Part (a) and (b) are based on theoretical analysis.
    # (a) No, a (3,2)-stingray duo is not always irreducible. It is reducible if
    #     it stabilizes a proper, non-trivial subspace.
    # (b) The reducibility is caused by any of the three listed conditions:
    #     (1) The intersection of fixed spaces is non-trivial (F_1 \cap F_2 != {0}).
    #     (2) The image space of g_1 is the fixed space of g_2 (U_1 = F_2).
    #     (3) The image space of g_2 is the fixed space of g_1 (U_2 = F_1).

    # Part (c) calculation
    # The proportion of irreducible pairs is dominated by the probability that the
    # fixed spaces F_1 and F_2 intersect trivially. This corresponds to the
    # probability that a random matrix in M_2(F_q) is invertible.
