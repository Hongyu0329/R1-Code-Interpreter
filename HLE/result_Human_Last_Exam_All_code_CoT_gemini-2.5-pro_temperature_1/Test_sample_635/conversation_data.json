    "To find a left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ for the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find an initial (not necessarily coprime) left factorization.** I will start by finding a simple denominator matrix $D(s)$ that can clear all the denominators in $H(s)$, which results in a polynomial matrix $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$. A straightforward choice is a diagonal matrix where each diagonal entry is the least common multiple of the denominators in the corresponding row of $H(s)$.\n\n2.  **Determine the required order.** A factorization is coprime if the order of the system, which is the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$, is minimal. This minimal order is known as the McMillan degree of the transfer function $H(s)$. I will calculate the McMillan degree by summing the ranks of the residue matrices at each pole of $H(s)$.\n\n3.  **Refine the factorization.** The initial factorization might have a determinant degree higher than the McMillan degree, indicating the presence of common factors between $D(s)$ and $N(s)$. I will use algebraic manipulation and polynomial matrix theory to find a new pair of matrices $(\\hat{D}(s), \\hat{N}(s))$ that has the correct (minimal) determinantal degree while still satisfying the factorization. This process effectively cancels out the greatest common left divisors.\n\n4.  **Verify the result.** The final matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ will be verified by:\n    a. Checking if $D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ indeed equals the original $H(s)$.\n    b. Confirming that $\\deg(\\det(D(s)))$ equals the McMillan degree of $H(s)$.\n    c. Formally checking for left coprimeness by ensuring that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. This is done by calculating all the $2 \\times 2$ minors of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ and verifying that their greatest common divisor (GCD) is a non-zero constant.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code.** I will provide a Python script using the `sympy` library to define the matrices, perform the verification steps, and print the final resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and verifies a left coprime factorization of a given transfer function matrix H(s).\n    The factorization is of the form H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the transfer function matrix H(s)\n    H = sympy.Matrix([\n        [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n        [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The given transfer function is:\")\n    print(\"H(s) =\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(H)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Propose a left coprime factorization D(s) and N(s).\n    # This result is derived analytically by ensuring the degree of det(D(s))\n    # matches the McMillan degree of H(s), which is 2.\n    # D(s) is constructed to clear denominators and N(s) = D(s)H(s).\n    # The key is to find a D(s) that is \"minimal\".\n    \n    # A minimal D(s) and the corresponding N(s) are:\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, s - 1],\n        [0, s**2 - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([\n        [1, 1],\n        [2, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    print(\"D(s) =\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(D)\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(N)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Verification\n    print(\"Verification Step 1: Check if D(s)^-1 * N(s) == H(s)\")\n    # Calculate D_inv_N = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    D_inv = D.inv()\n    D_inv_N = D_inv * N\n    \n    # Simplify the resulting matrix\n    D_inv_N_simplified = sympy.simplify(D_inv_N)\n    \n    print(\"D(s)^-1 * N(s) simplifies to:\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(D_inv_N_simplified)\n    \n    if D_inv_N_simplified == H:\n        print(\"\\nVerification successful: D(s)^-1 * N(s) equals H(s).\")\n    else:\n        print(\"\\nVerification failed: D(s)^-1 * N(s) does not equal H(s).\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*40 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Coprimeness Check\n    print(\"Verification Step 2: Check for left coprimeness.\")\n    print(\"This is done by checking if the GCD of all 2x2 minors of [D(s) N(s)] is a constant.\")\n    \n    # Form the concatenated matrix [D(s) N(s)]\n    DN_matrix = D.row_join(N)\n    print(\"\\n[D(s) N(s)] =\")\n    sympy.pretty_print(DN_matrix)\n    \n    # Calculate all 2x2 minors\n    minors = []\n    for j1 in range(DN_matrix.cols):\n        for j2 in range(j1 + 1, DN_matrix.cols):\n            sub_matrix = DN_matrix.col_slice(j1, j1+1).row_join(DN_matrix.col_slice(j2, j2+1))\n            minors.append(sub_matrix.det())\n            \n    # Calculate the GCD of all minors\n    if len(minors) > 1:\n        gcd_of_minors = sympy.gcd(minors[0], minors[1])\n        for i in range(2, len(minors)):\n            gcd_of_minors = sympy.gcd(gcd_of_minors, minors[i])\n    elif minors:\n        gcd_of_minors = minors[0]\n    else:\n        gcd_of_minors = 0\n        \n    print(f\"\\nThe GCD of the 2x2 minors is: {gcd_of_minors}\")\n\n    # A non-zero constant GCD implies coprimeness\n    if not gcd_of_minors.has(s) and gcd_of_minors != 0:\n        print(\"Since the GCD is a non-zero constant, D(s) and N(s) are left coprime.\")\n        # Final answer format requires printing the equation elements\n        print(\"\\nFinal equation elements:\")\n        print(\"D(s) = \")\n        for row in D.tolist():\n            print(row)\n        print(\"N(s) = \")\n        for row in N.tolist():\n            print(row)\n    else:\n        print(\"D(s) and N(s) are NOT left coprime.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s - 1], [0, s**2 - 1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>"
