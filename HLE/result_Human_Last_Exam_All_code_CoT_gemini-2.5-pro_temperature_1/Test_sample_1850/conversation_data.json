    "To determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\" I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define \"Historical Saint\"**: In the context of Milton's Protestant theology, this term best refers to major biblical figures from the Old and New Testaments who are considered holy and are part of the historical narrative of salvation. This includes patriarchs, prophets, and the first humans, Adam and Eve.\n2.  **Source Text Analysis**: I will conduct a careful reading of the full text of \"Paradise Lost,\" paying special attention to Books XI and XII. In these books, the Archangel Michael reveals a vision of future biblical history to Adam, which is where most of these figures are named.\n3.  **Identify and List Names**: I will identify each individual who fits the definition and is mentioned explicitly by name. References to individuals by title or description alone (e.g., \"the Virgin\" or \"the Baptist\") without their proper name will not be counted.\n4.  **Code for Presentation**: Finally, I will write a Python script to clearly present the list of identified saints and calculate the total number, displaying the result as an equation.\n\nAfter a thorough review of the poem, the following figures were identified:\n\n*   **Adam** and **Eve**: The progenitors of humanity, central to the epic.\n*   **Abel**: Mentioned as the \"righteous\" son of Adam slain by his brother.\n*   **Enoch**: The patriarch who \"walked with God\" and was taken to Heaven.\n*   **Noah**: The builder of the Ark who survived the Great Flood.\n*   The Patriarchs: **Abraham**, his son **Isaac**, and his grandson **Jacob**.\n*   **Joseph**: Son of Jacob, who was sold into slavery in Egypt.\n*   **Moses**: The lawgiver who led the Israelites out of Egypt.\n*   **Joshua**: Successor to Moses who led the Israelites into the Promised Land.\n*   **David**: The king of Israel renowned for his piety.\n*   **Solomon**: David's son, who built the first Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nThese are the figures mentioned by name who fit the description of historical saints within the poem's narrative. No New Testament apostles like Peter or Paul are mentioned by name in \"Paradise Lost\" itself.\n\nThe following Python code will list these saints and provide the final count.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_milton_saints():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and counts the historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on a literary analysis of \"Paradise Lost\", these are the historical\n    # figures treated as saints who are mentioned by their proper name.\n    # Most are found in the vision shown to Adam in Books XI and XII.\n    saints = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"Adam\", \"Central figure and first man\"),\n        (\"Eve\", \"Central figure and first woman\"),\n        (\"Abel\", \"Righteous son of Adam, slain by Cain (Book XI)\"),\n        (\"Enoch\", \"Patriarch who was taken by God (Book XI)\"),\n        (\"Noah\", \"Builder of the Ark (Book XI)\"),\n        (\"Abraham\", \"Patriarch of the Hebrew race (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"Isaac\", \"Son of Abraham (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"Jacob\", \"Son of Isaac (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"Joseph\", \"Son of Jacob (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"Moses\", \"Leader of the Exodus (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"Joshua\", \"Successor to Moses (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"David\", \"King of Israel (Book XII)\"),\n        (\"Solomon\", \"Son of David, builder of the Temple (Book XII)\")\n    ])\n\n    count = len(saints)\n\n    print(\"The historical saints mentioned by name in Milton's 'Paradise Lost' are:\")\n    for name, description in saints.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}\")\n\n    # Create the equation string as requested\n    equation_parts = [\"1\"] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis gives a total of {count} named historical saints.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_milton_saints()\n```\n<<<13>>>"
