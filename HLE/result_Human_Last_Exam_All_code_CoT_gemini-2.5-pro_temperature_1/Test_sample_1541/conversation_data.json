To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, an analysis of the memory usage for a C program, and a Python script to perform the task.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Parse the Input**: The input is a string like \"3+2+1+4+2\". The numbers we need to sort are located at the even indices of the string (0, 2, 4, ...).\n2.  **Count the Numbers**: Since the numbers are limited to 1, 2, 3, and 4, the most efficient way to sort them is using a counting sort. I will create four counters, one for each number, and iterate through the input string to count the occurrences of each number.\n3.  **Reconstruct the Sum**: After counting, I will build the new sorted sum. I'll append all the '1's, then all the '2's, and so on, joining them with '+' signs.\n4.  **Analyze C Program Memory**: As requested, I will calculate the memory usage for a memory-efficient C program that solves this problem.\n    *   An input buffer is needed to read the string. The maximum length is 1000, so a `char s[1001];` array is required, which takes `1001` bytes.\n    *   An integer array can be used to store the counts of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. For example, `int counts[4] = {0};`. Assuming an integer is 4 bytes, this array takes `4 * 4 = 16` bytes.\n    *   A few additional integer variables for loops and flags would be needed, taking approximately `2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n    *   The total memory `m` for variables would be `1001 + 16 + 8 = 1025` bytes. The output can be printed directly to the console without being stored in another large variable, making this approach very memory-efficient.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads a sum of numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), rearranges them in non-decreasing order,\n    and prints the new sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = input()\n\n    # The numbers are only 1, 2, 3, or 4. We can use counting sort.\n    count1 = 0\n    count2 = 0\n    count3 = 0\n    count4 = 0\n\n    # Iterate through the string, stepping by 2 to only get the digits.\n    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):\n        char = s[i]\n        if char == '1':\n            count1 += 1\n        elif char == '2':\n            count2 += 1\n        elif char == '3':\n            count3 += 1\n        elif char == '4':\n            count4 += 1\n\n    # Build the result list of strings in the correct order.\n    result_parts = []\n    result_parts.extend(['1'] * count1)\n    result_parts.extend(['2'] * count2)\n    result_parts.extend(['3'] * count3)\n    result_parts.extend(['4'] * count4)\n\n    # Join the parts with '+' and print the final equation.\n    # The problem requires outputting each number in the final equation.\n    # The join function handles this by placing '+' between each number.\n    print(\"+\".join(result_parts))\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1025>>>"
