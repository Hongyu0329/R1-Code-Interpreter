    # The question asks who is most likely to experience a significant long-term impact
    # on interest development from concrete feedback on immediate next steps.

    # Analysis of each phase:
    # Phase 1: Triggered Situational Interest. Student is passive. Feedback is less critical than the initial "hook".
    # Phase 2: Maintained Situational Interest. Student is engaged due to external factors. Feedback helps maintain current engagement.
    # Phase 3: Emerging Individual Interest. Student is starting to engage voluntarily. This is a critical transition.
    #            Concrete feedback provides a scaffold, building competence and self-efficacy. This support is key
    #            to turning emerging interest into a stable, long-term individual interest. The impact here is foundational.
    # Phase 4: Well-Developed Individual Interest. Student is self-directed. Interest is already stable. Feedback is useful but less developmentally critical.

    # Conclusion: The most critical point for this specific type of feedback to have a long-term impact is Phase 3.
