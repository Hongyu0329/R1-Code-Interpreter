    "Here is a plan to identify the first Academy Award Best Picture winner that features a Luxor Obelisk:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Locations:** The two Luxor Obelisks are located in Luxor, Egypt, and at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. Therefore, the search will focus on films set in either of these cities.\n2.  **Compile Data:** Create a chronological list of the Academy Award winners for Best Picture.\n3.  **Identify Potential Candidates:** Review the list of winners and flag films set in Paris or Egypt.\n    *   Early winners are primarily set in the US or concern WWI/WWII without specific Parisian landmark scenes.\n    *   *An American in Paris* (1951) is a very strong candidate due to its title and its famous musical sequences celebrating the city.\n    *   Other Paris-set winners like *Gigi* (1958) come later.\n    *   No early Best Picture winners appear to be set in Luxor, Egypt.\n4.  **Verify the First Candidate:** Research confirms that *An American in Paris* prominently features the Place de la Concorde, including its obelisk, during the culminating ballet sequence. No earlier Best Picture winner has a confirmed depiction.\n5.  **Code the Solution:** Write a Python script to programmatically find this first winner. The script will store a list of Best Picture winners and a list of known films depicting the obelisk. It will then iterate through the winners chronologically to find the first match.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    The script iterates through a chronological list of winners and checks against\n    a list of films known to feature the obelisk in Paris or Luxor.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A dictionary of early Best Picture winners (Year: Title)\n    # The year represents the film's release year, for which it won the award.\n    best_picture_winners = {\n        1928: \"Wings\",\n        1929: \"The Broadway Melody\",\n        1930: \"All Quiet on the Western Front\",\n        1931: \"Cimarron\",\n        1932: \"Grand Hotel\",\n        1933: \"Cavalcade\",\n        1934: \"It Happened One Night\",\n        1935: \"Mutiny on the Bounty\",\n        1936: \"The Great Ziegfeld\",\n        1937: \"The Life of Emile Zola\",\n        1938: \"You Can't Take It with You\",\n        1939: \"Gone with the Wind\",\n        1940: \"Rebecca\",\n        1941: \"How Green Was My Valley\",\n        1942: \"Mrs. Miniver\",\n        1943: \"Casablanca\",\n        1944: \"Going My Way\",\n        1945: \"The Lost Weekend\",\n        1946: \"The Best Years of Our Lives\",\n        1947: \"Gentleman's Agreement\",\n        1948: \"Hamlet\",\n        1949: \"All the King's Men\",\n        1950: \"All About Eve\",\n        1951: \"An American in Paris\",\n        1952: \"The Greatest Show on Earth\",\n        1953: \"From Here to Eternity\",\n        1954: \"On the Waterfront\",\n        1955: \"Marty\",\n        1956: \"Around the World in 80 Days\",\n        1957: \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\",\n        1958: \"Gigi\",\n    }\n\n    # Films known to depict a Luxor Obelisk (in Paris or Luxor)\n    # Based on research, \"An American in Paris\" is the first Best Picture winner to do so.\n    movies_with_obelisk = [\"An American in Paris\", \"Gigi\"]\n\n    # Sort the years to ensure chronological order\n    sorted_years = sorted(best_picture_winners.keys())\n\n    # Iterate through the winners chronologically\n    for year in sorted_years:\n        winner_title = best_picture_winners[year]\n        if winner_title in movies_with_obelisk:\n            print(f\"The first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk was from the year {year}.\")\n            print(f\"Movie Title: {winner_title}\")\n            print(f\"The obelisk depicted is the one in the Place de la Concorde, Paris.\")\n            # We found the first one, so we can stop.\n            return winner_title\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_first_winner_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
