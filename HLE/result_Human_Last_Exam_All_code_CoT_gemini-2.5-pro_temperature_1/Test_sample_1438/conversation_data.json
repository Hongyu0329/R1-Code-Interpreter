    "In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, the Pauli exclusion principle is encoded by using anti-commuting numbers called Grassmann variables. The integration over these variables, known as Berezin integration, is defined by a specific set of rules that are consistent with this anti-commuting nature.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Pauli Principle and Grassmann Algebra:** First, I will explain how the core property of Grassmann variables (`η² = 0`) directly enforces the Pauli exclusion principle.\n2.  **Berezin Integration Rules:** Next, I will introduce the defining rules for integrating over a single Grassmann variable `η`. The integration \"measure\" is the symbol `dη`. Its properties are not given by a single numerical value but by how it behaves under integration.\n3.  **The Normalization Convention:** I will highlight the key integration rule, `∫ dη η = 1`, which sets the normalization for the measure. This normalization is the conventional \"value\" that ensures the path integral formalism is consistent.\n\nThe following python script will print out these concepts and the defining equations.\n\n```python\ndef explain_grassmann_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the value and rules associated with the Grassmann integral measure\n    that is consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The Pauli exclusion principle is mathematically encoded by the properties of Grassmann variables and the rules of their integration.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
