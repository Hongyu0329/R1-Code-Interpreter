    The question discusses 'existentially forgeable' digital signature schemes and gives ECDSA as an example.
    This is a confusing premise. A secure digital signature scheme like ECDSA is designed to be 'existentially UNforgeable against chosen-message attacks' (EUF-CMA). A scheme that is 'existentially forgeable' is, by definition, insecure.
    We must assume the question refers to the class of insecure schemes, which might include flawed implementations of otherwise secure schemes (e.g., an ECDSA implementation where the signing nonce is reused, making it forgeable).

    'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.'
    This describes strong unforgeability. It is a statement of SECURITY. It contradicts the premise that the scheme is FORGEABLE. If a scheme is forgeable, it's because an attack has a non-negligible probability of success. So, this is likely incorrect in the context of the question.

    'For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.'
    This describes security against key recovery. Like option A, this is a statement of SECURITY that contradicts the premise that the scheme is FORGEABLE. A flawed ECDSA implementation (e.g., with nonce reuse) allows key recovery, making it forgeable. Thus, this statement is likely incorrect in this context.

    analysis_c = """
    'For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.'
    This statement describes a 'universal forgery' attack. The question asks if it's true that SOME 'existentially forgeable' schemes are also 'universally forgeable'.
    - An existential forgery is when an attacker can create one valid message-signature pair of their choosing.
    - A universal forgery is when an attacker can create a valid signature for ANY given message.
    Universal forgery is a more powerful attack than existential forgery. Therefore, any scheme that is universally forgeable is also, by definition, existentially forgeable.
    This means the set of universally forgeable schemes is a subset of the existentially forgeable schemes. The statement is therefore logically TRUE.

    This is FALSE. The primary purpose of a signature is authentication, not confidentiality. The message 'm' is required for verification and is usually public. Furthermore, if the message space is small (e.g., m is 'true' or 'false'), an attacker can easily check which message validates the signature.
