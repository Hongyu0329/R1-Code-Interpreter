# The task is to determine the order in the coupling constant 'u'
# at which the critical exponent ν for the phi^4 theory first receives a correction
# beyond its mean-field value within the epsilon-expansion framework.
# This script will explain the reasoning step-by-step.

# Step 1: Define the Mean-Field (or zeroth order) case.
# In mean-field theory, interactions are ignored (equivalent to setting the coupling u=0).
# The critical exponent ν is derived from the scaling dimension of the temperature-like
# parameter 't', which we call y_t. In this case, y_t is exactly 2.
y_t_0 = 2
nu_mean_field = 1 / y_t_0
print(f"Step 1: In mean-field theory (zeroth order in coupling u), the scaling dimension y_t = {y_t_0}.")
print(f"The critical exponent ν is calculated as 1 / y_t.")
print(f"Therefore, the mean-field value is ν = 1 / {y_t_0} = {nu_mean_field}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 2: Introduce the Renormalization Group (RG) corrections.
# Beyond mean-field, we consider the effect of the interaction coupling u.
# The RG function y_t(u) is calculated as a power series in u.
# y_t(u) = y_t_0 + c_1 * u^1 + c_2 * u^2 + ...
# The value of ν is then determined at the non-trivial fixed point u = u*.
print("Step 2: Beyond mean-field, y_t is a function of the coupling u.")
print("It can be expanded as a power series: y_t(u) = y_t_0 + c_1*u^1 + c_2*u^2 + ...")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Identify the first non-vanishing correction term.
# Perturbative calculations (specifically, the one-loop diagram contribution) show that
# the coefficient of the linear term, c_1, is non-zero.
# This is the first correction to the constant mean-field value.
first_correction_order_in_y_t = 1
print(f"Step 3: The first correction to y_t(u) comes from the one-loop calculation.")
print(f"This calculation shows that the coefficient c_1 is non-zero, so the first correction term is of order u^{first_correction_order_in_y_t}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Determine the order of the correction for ν itself.
# Since ν(u) = 1 / y_t(u), we can see how the first-order correction in y_t affects ν.
# ν(u) = 1 / (y_t_0 + c_1*u^1 + ...)
# Using Taylor expansion for (a + x)^-1 ≈ (1/a)*(1 - x/a):
# ν(u) ≈ (1/y_t_0) * (1 - (c_1*u)/y_t_0 + ...)
# ν(u) ≈ nu_mean_field - (c_1 / y_t_0^2) * u^1 + ...
# The first term that modifies the constant nu_mean_field is linear in u.
final_order = 1
print("Step 4: We now find the expansion for ν(u) = 1 / y_t(u).")
print(f"ν(u) = 1 / ({y_t_0} + c_1*u^1 + ...) ≈ {nu_mean_field} - (c_1/{y_t_0**2})*u^{final_order} + ...")
print(f"This shows that the initial non-vanishing contribution to ν (beyond its constant value) is of order {final_order} in the coupling constant u.")

# Final Answer
print(f"Conclusion: The specific order is {final_order}.")
