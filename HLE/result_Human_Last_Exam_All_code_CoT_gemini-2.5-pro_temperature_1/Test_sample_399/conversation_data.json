    "To solve the initial value problem, we will first find the general solution to the differential equation by separating variables and integrating. Then, we will use the initial condition to find the particular solution. Finally, we will evaluate this particular solution at $t=1$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n1.  **Separate the variables**: The given differential equation is $x'(t) = (t-1)x^2(t)$. We can write it as $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$. Separating the variables containing $x$ and $t$ to opposite sides of the equation gives:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = (t-1) dt\n    $$\n2.  **Integrate both sides**:\n    $$\n    \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt\n    $$\n    Performing the integration yields:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C\n    $$\n    where $C$ is the constant of integration.\n3.  **Apply the initial condition**: We are given $x(0) = -8$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation allows us to solve for $C$:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{8} = C\n    $$\n4.  **Find the particular solution**: Substitute $C = \\frac{1}{8}$ back into the general solution:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n5.  **Solve for x(t)**: To get an explicit expression for $x(t)$, we can first multiply by -1 and then take the reciprocal.\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x} = -\\frac{t^2}{2} + t - \\frac{1}{8}\n    $$\n    To simplify the right-hand side, we can find a common denominator (8):\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}{8}\n    $$\n    Now, taking the reciprocal gives the particular solution:\n    $$\n    x(t) = \\frac{8}{-4t^2 + 8t - 1}\n    $$\n6.  **Calculate x(1)**: Finally, we substitute $t=1$ into our solution for $x(t)$:\n    $$\n    x(1) = \\frac{8}{-4(1)^2 + 8(1) - 1} = \\frac{8}{-4 + 8 - 1} = \\frac{8}{3}\n    $$\nThe following Python code will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the value of t for which we want to find x(t)\nt = 1\n\n# The solution to the differential equation is x(t) = 8 / (-4*t**2 + 8*t - 1)\n# We will calculate the final value by plugging t=1 into this equation.\n\n# Numerator of the solution\nnumerator = 8\n\n# Terms in the denominator\nterm1 = -4 * (t**2)\nterm2 = 8 * t\nterm3 = -1\n\n# Calculate the denominator\ndenominator = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n# Calculate the final value of x(1)\nx_1 = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in and the result\nprint(f\"The equation for x(1) is: x(1) = {numerator} / (-4*({t})^2 + {8}*({t}) - 1)\")\nprint(f\"Calculating the denominator: (-4 * {t**2}) + ({8 * t}) + ({term3}) = {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The final result is: x(1) = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The value of x(1) is: {x_1}\")\n\n```\n<<<8/3>>>"
