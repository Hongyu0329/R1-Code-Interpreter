# Define the value of t for which we want to find x(t)
t = 1

# The solution to the differential equation is x(t) = 8 / (-4*t**2 + 8*t - 1)
# We will calculate the final value by plugging t=1 into this equation.

# Numerator of the solution
numerator = 8

# Terms in the denominator
term1 = -4 * (t**2)
term2 = 8 * t
term3 = -1

# Calculate the denominator
denominator = term1 + term2 + term3

# Calculate the final value of x(1)
x_1 = numerator / denominator

# Print the final equation with the numbers plugged in and the result
