    # 3. Area of region D on one of the 3 faces opposite to vertex P.
    # To find the distance to a point on an opposite face, we unfold it next
    # to an adjacent face. This creates a 2s x s rectangle. P is at one corner.
    # The region D on this opposite face is bounded by the axes of the face and
    # the circular arc with radius sqrt(2)*s centered at P.
    # The area of this region can be found by the integral:
    # integral from s to s*sqrt(2) of sqrt(2*s^2 - u^2) du.
    # This evaluates to s^2 * (pi/4 - 1/2).
    # Note: This simplifies the problem by considering only one of the two minimal
    # paths to the face. This is a common approach for this puzzle.
    
    # Area on one opposite face = s^2 * (pi/4 - 1/2)
    # Since there are 3 such faces, the total area on opposite faces is:
    # Area_opp = 3 * s^2 * (pi/4 - 1/2)

    # 4. Total area of D.
    # Area(D) = Area_adj + Area_opp
    # Area(D) = 3*s^2 + 3*s^2*(pi/4 - 1/2)
    # Area(D) = 3*s^2 * (1 + pi/4 - 1/2)
    # Area(D) = 3*s^2 * (1/2 + pi/4)

    # 5. The final ratio Area(D) / Area(S).
