    "Of course, I can help you with that. This is a fascinating problem in combinatory logic. Here is my step-by-step plan to solve it:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Parse the SKI Expression**: First, I will carefully parse the complex SKI expression to understand its structure. The parentheses dictate how the combinators are applied to each other.\n2.  **Identify Combinator Roles**: I will identify the functions of the key building blocks of the expression in the context of Church numerals. This involves recognizing patterns that correspond to arithmetic operations.\n    *   `I` represents the Church numeral for `1`.\n    *   `S(S(K S)K)`, which I'll call `SUCC`, is the standard successor function (`n -> n+1`).\n    *   `S(I)`, which I'll call `SUCC'`, also acts as a successor function.\n    *   The application of two Church numerals, `m n`, corresponds to multiplication, `m * n`.\n    *   `S(I) I`, which I'll call `M`, is the \"mockingbird\" combinator. When applied to a numeral `n`, `M n` results in self-application `n n`, which corresponds to multiplication `n * n = n^2`.\n3.  **Translate to Arithmetic**: I will translate the entire SKI expression into an arithmetic formula based on the roles identified in the previous step.\n4.  **Calculate the Integer `n`**: I will compute the value of the arithmetic formula to find the integer `n`.\n5.  **Calculate `log_2(n)`**: Finally, I will use Python to compute the base-2 logarithm of `n` and provide the code that shows the calculation steps.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Parsing**: The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))(S(B)(C))))`.\n    Let's break it down:\n    *   It has the outer form `S(I) (Z)`, where `Z` is the rest of the expression. Since `S(I)` is a successor function `SUCC'`, this means the final number `n` is `(value of Z) + 1`.\n    *   `Z` has the form `X Y`, which means the application of `X` to `Y`.\n    *   `X = S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))`\n    *   `Y = S(B)(C)`\n    *   `A = S(S(K S)K) I` is `SUCC 1`, which is the Church numeral `2`.\n    *   `B = S(S(K S)K)` is the `SUCC` function.\n    *   `C = S(I) I` is the `M` combinator (`n -> n^2`).\n\n2.  **Translation**:\n    *   Let's define a function `H(x)` to represent the combinator `Y`.\n        `Y = S(SUCC)(M)`. When applied to a numeral `x`, this becomes `(SUCC x) (M x)`.\n        In Church arithmetic, application is multiplication.\n        So, `Y(x) = (SUCC x) * (M x) = (x+1) * x^2`. Let's call this function `H(x)`.\n    *   Now let's analyze `X`. `X = S(I)(S(I)(K 2))`.\n        When applied to a function `f`, `X(f) = f(f(2))`. So, `X` is a function that takes another function `Y` and computes `Y(Y(2))`.\n    *   The value of `Z` is `X Y`, which means we apply `X` to `Y=H`.\n        `Z = X(H) = H(H(2))`.\n    *   The final integer `n` is `Z + 1 = H(H(2)) + 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculation**:\n    *   First, we calculate `H(2)`:\n        `H(2) = (2+1) * 2^2 = 3 * 4 = 12`.\n    *   Next, we calculate `H(H(2))`, which is `H(12)`:\n        `H(12) = (12+1) * 12^2 = 13 * 144 = 1872`.\n    *   Finally, we find `n`:\n        `n = 1872 + 1 = 1873`.\n\n4.  **Final Code**:\n    Now, I will provide the Python code to compute `log_2(1873)` and show the intermediate steps as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem asks for log_2(n), where n is a Church integer.\n# Our derivation shows that n can be calculated using an arithmetic formula.\n\n# Let's define the function H(x) derived from the SKI expression Y.\n# Y(x) corresponds to (SUCC x) * (M x), where SUCC x = x+1 and M x = x*x.\ndef H(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates (x+1) * x^2.\"\"\"\n    succ_x = x + 1\n    m_x = x * x\n    return succ_x * m_x\n\n# The core of the expression evaluates to H(H(2)).\n# Calculate H(2) first.\nval_h2 = H(2)\n\n# Now calculate H(H(2)).\nval_hh2 = H(val_h2)\n\n# The church integer n is the successor of the inner expression's value.\nn = val_hh2 + 1\n\n# Calculate the final result, log_2(n).\nresult = math.log2(n)\n\n# Output the steps of the calculation as requested.\nprint(f\"H(2) = (2 + 1) * 2^2 = 3 * 4 = {val_h2}\")\nprint(f\"H(H(2)) = H(12) = (12 + 1) * 12^2 = 13 * 144 = {val_hh2}\")\nprint(f\"The integer n = {val_hh2} + 1 = {n}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation is log_2({n})\")\nprint(f\"The result is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<10.870949437118442>>>"
