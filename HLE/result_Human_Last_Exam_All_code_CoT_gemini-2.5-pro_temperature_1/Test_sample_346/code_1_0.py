# The problem asks for log_2(n), where n is a Church integer.
# Our derivation shows that n can be calculated using an arithmetic formula.

# Let's define the function H(x) derived from the SKI expression Y.
# Y(x) corresponds to (SUCC x) * (M x), where SUCC x = x+1 and M x = x*x.
def H(x):
    """Calculates (x+1) * x^2."""
    succ_x = x + 1
    m_x = x * x
    return succ_x * m_x

# The core of the expression evaluates to H(H(2)).
# Calculate H(2) first.
val_h2 = H(2)

# Now calculate H(H(2)).
val_hh2 = H(val_h2)

# The church integer n is the successor of the inner expression's value.
n = val_hh2 + 1

# Calculate the final result, log_2(n).
result = math.log2(n)

# Output the steps of the calculation as requested.
