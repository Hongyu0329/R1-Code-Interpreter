    This function explains the solution to the continuum theory problem.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal
    points in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.

    The solution relies on two key facts from mathematical literature:
    1.  The cardinality of a standard (metrizable) continuum is at most 'c',
        the cardinality of the continuum. Therefore, any of its subsets
        has a cardinality of at most 'c'. This establishes an upper bound.
    2.  A specific construction by A. Illanes (2011) shows the existence of a
        hereditarily decomposable continuum where the set of non-coastal points
        has cardinality exactly 'c'. This shows the upper bound is achievable.

    Thus, the largest possible cardinality is 'c'.
