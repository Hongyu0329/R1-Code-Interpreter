    # The rule 'REC = REC ADJ' is a left recursion with no base case.
    # This means the non-terminal REC cannot produce any finite sequence of terminals.
    # In formal language theory, this is a "non-productive" rule.
    # Therefore, any sentence in the language L must be generated by grammar rules
    # that do not involve REC. This effectively means we can only use the
    # 'red' and 'or alike' alternatives for the ADJ rule.
