# The analysis of each statement leads to the following set of true propositions.
# A: False. Depends on n-m, not |n-m|.
# B: False. Incorrect property.
# C: True. The axis must be fixed to ensure the relative property R_{n-m}.
# D: False. Encodes 1D relative position, not 3D.
# E: True. Rotation preserves the norm, |R_m(v)| = |v|.
# F: True. Scalar multiplication is linear.
# G: True. Rotation preserves inner products and thus orthogonality.
# H: True. Composition of rotations about the same axis is additive: R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}.
# J: True. The rotations commute, so the difference is the zero quaternion, which is purely imaginary.
# K: False. The real part is not preserved.
# L: True. The trace of the left-multiplication matrix is 4 times the real part of the quaternion.
# M: False. The commutator is always zero, regardless of the axis.
# N: False. The norm is always 1 for a unit vector.

# The letters corresponding to the true statements are C, E, F, G, H, J, L.
# Sorting them alphabetically gives the final result.
