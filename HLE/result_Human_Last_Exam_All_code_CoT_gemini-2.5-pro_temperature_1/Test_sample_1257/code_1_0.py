    """
    This function solves the cube placement puzzle by logical deduction.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of colors required to tile an entire x,y plane
    under a specific set of rules for placing colored cubes.

    Let's summarize the colors and rules:
    - Colors: White (W), Blue (B), Orange (O)
    - Start: A single White cube at (0, 0, 0).
    - Rule 1 (Blue): Can attach to W or O in the same x,y plane (same z-coordinate).
    - Rule 2 (White): Can attach if adjacent to two cubes of different colors, OR adjacent to an O cube in the z-direction.
    - Rule 3 (Orange): Can attach if adjacent to a W cube in the z-direction.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze which colors can be in the target plane (let's call it the z=0 plane).
    # The plane starts with a White cube, so White is in the set.
    # To place an Orange cube at (x, y, 0), Rule 3 requires a White cube at (x, y, 1) or (x, y, -1).
    # This means Orange cubes can only be placed in layers adjacent to layers containing White cubes.
    # Therefore, Orange cubes act as "helpers" and are not part of the color set for the plane itself.
    # The colors used *for the plane* must be a subset of {White, Blue}.
    
    # Step 2: Determine the minimum number of colors from the set {White, Blue}.
    # - Can we use only 1 color? The plane must contain White. If we only use White, we start with
    #   one W cube. To add another W cube, we need to satisfy Rule 2. We can't, because we don't
    #   have two adjacent cubes of different colors, nor do we have an Orange cube in the z-direction.
    #   So, using only 1 color is impossible.
    # - This means the minimum number of colors must be at least 2.

    # Step 3: Propose and verify a construction with 2 colors: {White, Blue}.
    # A stable, infinitely repeating 3D pattern that follows all rules can be constructed:
    # - Planes with an even z-coordinate (like our target z=0 plane) are a checkerboard of White and Blue.
    # - Planes with an odd z-coordinate (like the helper z=1 plane) are a checkerboard of Orange and Blue.
    #
    # This structure is valid:
    # - A White cube (e.g., at (0,0,0)) is valid because it's adjacent to an Orange cube in the z-direction (Rule 2).
    # - A Blue cube (e.g., at (1,0,0)) is valid because it's adjacent to White cubes in the same plane (Rule 1).
    # This construction successfully fills the plane with a set of 2 colors.

    # Step 4: Conclusion.
    # The smallest number of colors that can be used to construct the x,y plane is 2.
    # The set of colors is {White, Blue}.
    color_set = {"White", "Blue"}
    cardinality = len(color_set)
    
    print("The set of colors used to construct the plane is {White, Blue}.")
    print(f"The cardinality of this set is {cardinality}.")
