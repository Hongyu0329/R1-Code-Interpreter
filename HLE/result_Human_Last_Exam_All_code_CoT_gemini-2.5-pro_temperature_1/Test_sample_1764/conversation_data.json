    "Answering this question requires careful interpretation. The number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ depends on the specific choices of $X$ and $B$. The question asks for the \"smallest possible number,\" which implies we are looking for the minimum number of embeddings across all possible choices of $X$ and $B$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to find this number:\n1.  Let $N(X, B)$ be the number of isometric embeddings of $X$ into $B$. We are looking for the value of $\\min_{X, B} N(X, B)$, where the minimum is taken over all finite ultrametric spaces $X$ and all Banach spaces $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n2.  The number of embeddings $N(X, B)$ must be a non-negative integer. So, the smallest possible value is at least 0.\n3.  We need to check if $N(X, B)$ can actually be 0. This would happen if, for some choice of $X$ and $B$, no isometric embedding exists.\n4.  Let's construct such an example.\n    *   Let $X$ be a set of three points, $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$.\n    *   Define a metric $d$ on $X$ such that the distance between any two distinct points is 1. So, $d(x_1, x_2) = d(x_2, x_3) = d(x_1, x_3) = 1$. This metric satisfies the strong triangle inequality, $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$, because for any choice of $x, y, z$ from $X$, the distances are $(1, 1, 1)$, and $1 \\le \\max(1, 1)$. Thus, $(X, d)$ is a finite ultrametric space.\n    *   Let the Banach space $B$ be the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard absolute value norm, $\\|a\\| = |a|$. This is a valid Banach space.\n5.  An isometric embedding of $X$ into $B$ would be a function $f: X \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that for any two distinct points $x_i, x_j \\in X$, the distance between their images is equal to their distance in $X$. That is, $|f(x_i) - f(x_j)| = d(x_i, x_j) = 1$.\n6.  Let's try to find such a function. Let $y_1 = f(x_1)$, $y_2 = f(x_2)$, and $y_3 = f(x_3)$. We need to find three points $y_1, y_2, y_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$ such that $|y_1 - y_2| = 1$, $|y_2 - y_3| = 1$, and $|y_1 - y_3| = 1$.\n7.  Let's fix one point, say $y_1 = 0$.\n    *   From $|y_1 - y_2| = 1$, we get $|0 - y_2| = 1$, which means $y_2 = 1$ or $y_2 = -1$.\n    *   **Case 1:** Assume $y_2 = 1$. We now need to find a $y_3$ that satisfies the remaining conditions: $|y_1 - y_3| = |0 - y_3| = 1$ and $|y_2 - y_3| = |1 - y_3| = 1$. The first condition means $y_3 = 1$ or $y_3 = -1$. The second condition means $1 - y_3 = 1$ (so $y_3=0$) or $1 - y_3 = -1$ (so $y_3=2$). There is no value for $y_3$ that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.\n    *   **Case 2:** Assume $y_2 = -1$. We need a $y_3$ that satisfies $|0 - y_3| = 1$ and $|-1 - y_3| = 1$. The first condition gives $y_3 = 1$ or $y_3 = -1$. The second condition means $-1 - y_3 = 1$ (so $y_3=-2$) or $-1 - y_3 = -1$ (so $y_3=0$). Again, there is no common solution for $y_3$.\n8.  Since it's impossible to find such points $y_1, y_2, y_3$ in $\\mathbb{R}$, no isometric embedding exists for this specific $X$ and $B$. Therefore, $N(X, B) = 0$ in this case.\n9.  Since we have found a valid case where the number of embeddings is 0, and this number cannot be negative, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 0.\n\nTo fulfill the request of providing code that outputs an equation, I will provide a Python script that prints a simple equation resulting in 0.\n\n```python\n# Based on the reasoning that the number of isometric embeddings can be 0,\n# because some ultrametric spaces cannot be embedded into some Banach spaces.\n# An example is a 3-point space with all inter-point distances equal to 1,\n# which cannot be isometrically embedded in the real line R.\n# Since the number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer, the smallest possible number is 0.\n\n# The following code presents a simple equation that results in 0.\n# The numbers that form the equation are 1 and 1.\nnum1 = 1\nnum2 = 1\nresult = num1 - num2\n\n# As requested, the code outputs the final equation.\n# The numbers in the equation (1 and 1) are explicitly part of the output string.\nprint(f\"{num1} - {num2} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
