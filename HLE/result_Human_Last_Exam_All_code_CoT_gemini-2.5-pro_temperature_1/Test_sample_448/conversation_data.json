    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify all noble gases:** The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Determine the \"rarest\":** The term \"rarest\" in the context of \"all terrestrial matter\" refers to the gas with the lowest total mass across the entire planet (crust, mantle, oceans, and atmosphere).\n3.  **Compare the gases:** While Xenon is the rarest of the *stable* noble gases, Radon (Rn) is significantly rarer overall. This is because Radon is radioactive and has a very short half-life (the most stable isotope, Rn-222, has a half-life of just 3.8 days). It is constantly being formed from the radioactive decay of radium in the Earth's crust, but it also decays very quickly, meaning it never accumulates to a large total mass.\n4.  **Calculate the percentage:** We can estimate the total mass of Radon present on Earth at any given time (which is in a steady state) to be approximately 2.2 x 10^5 kg. By dividing this by the total mass of the Earth (approximately 5.972 x 10^24 kg) and multiplying by 100, we can find its percentage of all terrestrial matter. The date \"2002\" does not affect this calculation, as these geological and physical constants are stable over human timescales.\n\nThe following Python code performs this final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The rarest noble gas is Radon (Rn) due to its radioactive nature and short half-life.\n# This script calculates its approximate percentage of all terrestrial matter.\n\n# Step 1: Define the estimated total mass of Radon on Earth in kilograms.\n# This value is derived from the steady-state equilibrium of Radon-222\n# with its parent elements in the Earth's crust and mantle.\ntotal_radon_mass_kg = 2.2e5\n\n# Step 2: Define the total mass of the Earth in kilograms.\ntotal_earth_mass_kg = 5.972e24\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the abundance as a percentage.\n# The formula is (Mass of Radon / Mass of Earth) * 100.\npercentage = (total_radon_mass_kg / total_earth_mass_kg) * 100\n\n# Step 4: Print the result and the equation used.\nprint(\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn).\")\nprint(f\"Its estimated total mass on Earth is approximately {total_radon_mass_kg:e} kg.\")\nprint(f\"The total mass of the Earth is approximately {total_earth_mass_kg:e} kg.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe calculation for its percentage of all terrestrial matter is:\")\nprint(f\"({total_radon_mass_kg} / {total_earth_mass_kg}) * 100 = {percentage:e}%\")\n\n```\n<<<3.683858e-18%>>>"
