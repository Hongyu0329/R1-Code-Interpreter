    # Principle: Molecular packing determines surface area in a monolayer.
    # Saturated chains can pack more tightly than unsaturated chains because they are
    # straight and flexible, maximizing van der Waals interactions.
    # Unsaturated chains (even trans) introduce kinks/rigidity that disrupt packing.
    
    # Conclusion: The lipid with fully saturated chains will pack more tightly.
    # Tighter packing results in a lower surface area per molecule.
