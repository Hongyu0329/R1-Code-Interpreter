    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of triangular faces on the convex hull of the great icosahedron.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the shape of the outer-hull:** The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron. Its vertices are located at the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, the convex hull (or \"outer-hull\") of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Count the faces of the resulting shape:** The question asks for the number of visible triangles from the outside, which corresponds to the number of faces of its convex hull, the regular icosahedron.\n3.  **Use Euler's Polyhedron Formula:** For any convex polyhedron, the formula V - E + F = 2 holds true, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n4.  **Find V and E for an Icosahedron:** A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices and 30 edges.\n5.  **Calculate F:** We can rearrange the formula to solve for F: F = 2 - V + E. By substituting the values for the icosahedron, we can find the number of faces.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The problem asks for the number of triangles on the outer-hull of the great icosahedron.\n# Step 1: The outer-hull (or convex hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# Step 2: The number of visible triangles is the number of faces of this regular icosahedron.\n# Step 3: We can use Euler's polyhedron formula (V - E + F = 2) to find the number of faces (F).\n\n# Step 4: A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (V) and 30 edges (E).\nV = 12\nE = 30\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the number of faces (F) using the formula F = 2 - V + E.\nF = 2 - V + E\n\nprint(\"The convex hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(\"A regular icosahedron has V = {} vertices and E = {} edges.\".format(V, E))\nprint(\"Using Euler's formula V - E + F = 2, we can find the number of faces (F).\")\nprint(\"F = 2 - V + E\")\nprint(\"F = 2 - {} + {}\".format(V, E))\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles needed is: {}\".format(F))\n```\n<<<20>>>"
