    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set using a t-norm operation, we need to apply a fuzzy intersection operator to the given values. The most common t-norm used in fuzzy logic is the **minimum operator**.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the two input values: `Phi_k(x′)` which is the firing level of the rule's antecedent, and `μG_k_j(y_j)` which is the membership degree in the rule's consequent.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm, which calculates the minimum of these two values.\n3.  The result will be the rule activation level.\n4.  Print the full calculation process and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values for the rule activation\n# Firing level of the antecedent part of the rule\nphi_k = 0.7\n# Membership value of the consequent part of the rule\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is a type of binary operation used in fuzzy logic to model a fuzzy AND.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum operator, which we will use here.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm (minimum operator) to the antecedent's firing level and the consequent's membership grade.\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j})\")\nprint(f\"The calculated rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
