    "Answering this question requires understanding the mechanics of an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine and how it relates to population-level statistics like the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Vaccine Model:** First, I'll clarify what an \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine is. In this model, a certain percentage of vaccinated individuals (`VE_S`) become completely immune to the disease. The remaining `1 - VE_S` of vaccinated individuals receive no protection and are just as susceptible as unvaccinated people.\n2.  **Define Vaccine Efficacy Measures:**\n    *   **Per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`):** The reduction in infection risk for a vaccinated individual *per single exposure* to the pathogen.\n    *   **Observed efficacy from IRR (`VE_IRR`):** This is the standard measure calculated from clinical trial data, defined as `1 - IRR`, where `IRR` is the Incidence Rate in the vaccinated group divided by the Incidence Rate in the unvaccinated group.\n3.  **Relate the Measures Mathematically:** I will show how `VE_IRR` relates to the vaccine's true parameter `VE_S`. Then, I will show how the concept of `VE_p` relates to `VE_S` in an all-or-nothing model.\n4.  **Simulate and Conclude:** I will write a Python script to simulate a vaccine trial. The script will:\n    *   Set a \"true\" efficacy (`VE_S`) for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    *   Simulate the occurrence of new cases in both vaccinated and unvaccinated groups over time.\n    *   Calculate the incidence rates, the IRR, and the final estimated efficacy (`1 - IRR`).\n    *   Demonstrate that the calculated `1 - IRR` accurately reflects the true efficacy (`VE_S`), which is conceptually identical to the per-exposure efficacy (`VE_p`) in this specific vaccine model.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n*   Let `λ` be the force of infection (the rate at which a susceptible person gets infected).\n*   **Unvaccinated Group:** All individuals are susceptible. The incidence rate is `IR_u = λ`.\n*   **Vaccinated Group:** A fraction `VE_S` are immune, and a fraction `1 - VE_S` are susceptible. New infections can only occur in this susceptible fraction. The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is the rate in the susceptible fraction (`λ`) diluted by the proportion that is susceptible (`1 - VE_S`). Therefore, `IR_v = λ * (1 - VE_S)`.\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = (λ * (1 - VE_S)) / λ = 1 - VE_S`.\n*   **Observed Efficacy:** `VE_IRR = 1 - IRR = 1 - (1 - VE_S) = VE_S`. This shows that `1 - IRR` correctly measures the proportion of people protected.\n*   **Per-Exposure Efficacy (`VE_p`):** For a randomly chosen vaccinated person, their risk of infection upon exposure is a weighted average: `(probability of being immune * risk if immune) + (probability of being susceptible * risk if susceptible)`. This equals `(VE_S * 0) + ((1 - VE_S) * risk_unvaccinated)`. The average risk reduction is therefore `VE_S`. Thus, for an all-or-nothing vaccine, `VE_p` is conceptually the same as `VE_S`.\n\nSince `1 - IRR` correctly estimates `VE_S`, and `VE_p` is equivalent to `VE_S`, `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy. The following code will demonstrate this numerically.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_aon_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a trial for an all-or-nothing vaccine to determine if\n    1 - IRR correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
