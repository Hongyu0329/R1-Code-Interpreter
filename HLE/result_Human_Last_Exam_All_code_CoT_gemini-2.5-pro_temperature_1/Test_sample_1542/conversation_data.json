    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. A quadratic form is a polynomial of the form $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are elements of $R$.\n\nTwo quadratic forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. This means there exists an invertible 2x2 matrix $T$ with entries in $R$ such that $Q_2(x, y) = Q_1(T(x,y))$. The set of all such invertible matrices forms the general linear group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nThe problem is thus equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of all quadratic forms under the action of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nMy plan is to solve this computationally:\n1.  **Represent the Forms:** A quadratic form $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ can be uniquely represented by the tuple of its coefficients `(a, b, c)`, where $a, b, c \\in \\{0, 1, ..., 7\\}$. There are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n2.  **Represent the Transformations:** The group of invertible linear transformations, $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$, consists of all 2x2 matrices with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ whose determinant is a unit in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. The units are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  **Define the Group Action:** I will implement a function that applies a transformation $T$ to a form $Q$ to get the new form $Q'$.\n4.  **Count the Orbits:** I will start with the set of all 512 forms. I will then iteratively pick a form, compute its entire orbit (all equivalent forms), count this orbit as one class, and remove all its elements from the set of forms. I will repeat this process until no forms are left. The final count of orbits is the answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms\n    in two variables over the finite ring R=Z/8Z up to invertible linear transforms.\n    The method is a direct computational approach by counting the orbits of the set of\n    quadratic forms under the action of the group GL_2(Z/8Z).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The ring is Z/8Z.\n    N = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Generate the group of invertible linear transforms GL_2(Z/8Z).\n    # A 2x2 matrix T is in GL_2(Z/N) if its determinant is a unit in Z/N.\n    units = {i for i in range(N) if i % 2 != 0}\n    gl2 = []\n    for p in range(N):\n        for q in range(N):\n            for r in range(N):\n                for s in range(N):\n                    det = (p * s - q * r) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n\n    # Step 2: Define the action of a transform T on a form (a,b,c).\n    # If q(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 and T maps (x,y) to (px+qy, rx+sy),\n    # the new form q'(x,y) = q(px+qy, rx+sy) has coefficients (a',b',c').\n    def apply_transform(form, T):\n        a, b, c = form\n        p, q = T[0]\n        r, s = T[1]\n        \n        a_new = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % N\n        b_new = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % N\n        c_new = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % N\n        \n        return (a_new, b_new, c_new)\n\n    # Step 3: Generate the set of all N^3 possible quadratic forms.\n    all_forms = set()\n    for a in range(N):\n        for b in range(N):\n            for c in range(N):\n                all_forms.add((a, b, c))\n\n    # Step 4: Count the orbits by partitioning the set of all forms.\n    num_classes = 0\n    \n    # Loop until all forms have been classified into an orbit.\n    while all_forms:\n        # Each time we enter the loop, we've found a new, unclassified form.\n        # This form will be the representative of a new equivalence class.\n        num_classes += 1\n        \n        # Pick an arbitrary form from the remaining unclassified ones.\n        q_rep = all_forms.pop()\n        \n        # Compute the orbit of this representative by applying all possible transforms.\n        orbit = set()\n        for T in gl2:\n            new_form = apply_transform(q_rep, T)\n            orbit.add(new_form)\n            \n        # Remove all forms in the computed orbit from the set of all forms.\n        # This ensures that we don't count any form in this equivalence class again.\n        all_forms.difference_update(orbit)\n\n    # The final count is the number of orbits found.\n    print(num_classes)\n\nsolve_task()\n```\n<<<28>>>"
