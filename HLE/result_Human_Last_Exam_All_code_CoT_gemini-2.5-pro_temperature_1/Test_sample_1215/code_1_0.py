    # Step 1: Define the relationship between variables and models.
    # Let n be the number of variables in the original formula φ's context (where n ≥ 2).
    # Let k be the number of essential variables. This is the minimum number of
    # variables required for the equivalent formula ψ.
    # Let m be the number of satisfying assignments (models) for the function when
    # expressed using only its k essential variables.
    #
    # When this k-variable function is considered in the context of n variables, each of its
    # m satisfying assignments corresponds to 2^(n-k) satisfying assignments for φ,
    # as the (n-k) non-essential variables can be assigned any value.
    #
    # This gives the total number of models for φ: Total Models = m * 2^(n-k).

    # Step 2: Use the given information to form an equation.
    # We are given that φ has exactly 2^(n-1) models.
    # So, we can set up the equation: m * 2^(n-k) = 2^(n-1).

    # Step 3: Solve the equation for m.
    # m = 2^(n-1) / 2^(n-k)
    # m = 2^((n-1) - (n-k))
    # m = 2^(k-1)
    # This equation tells us how many models (m) the k-variable equivalent function must have.

    # Step 4: Find the minimum possible integer value for k.
    # The problem states φ is not a tautology, and it has satisfying assignments,
    # so it's not a contradiction either. A formula that is not a tautology or a
    # contradiction must depend on at least one variable.
    # Therefore, the number of essential variables k must be at least 1.
    #
    # We need to find the smallest integer k ≥ 1 for which a k-variable function
    # can have m = 2^(k-1) models.

    # Let's test the smallest possible value for k, which is 1.
    k_test = 1
    m_test = 2**(k_test - 1)

    # A function of k variables can have any integer number of models from 0 to 2^k.
    # For k=1, the number of total possible models is 2^1 = 2.
    # Our calculated m_test is 1.
    # It is indeed possible for a formula with 1 variable to have 1 model. For example,
    # the formula p1 is true for exactly one of its two possible truth assignments.

    # Since k=1 is a possible number of essential variables, and we already established
    # that k must be at least 1, the minimum possible value for k is 1.
