    "To find the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant (`c_N`) for a hypersurface in a weighted projective space is calculated using the formula: `c_N = d - Σwᵢ`, where `d` is the degree of the defining polynomial and `Σwᵢ` is the sum of the weights of the ambient space.\n2.  **Extract the Weights:** The weights of the ambient space are given as `w = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)`.\n3.  **Determine the Degree (d):** For a variety to be Calabi-Yau, its degree `d` must be equal to the sum of the weights (`d = Σwᵢ`). I will verify this by calculating the sum of the weights and checking the degree of the terms in the provided polynomial.\n    *   Sum of weights: `Σwᵢ = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225`.\n    *   Therefore, the degree `d` must be 225. Let's check a term from the polynomial, for example, `z₅³`. Its weighted degree is `3 * w₅ = 3 * 75 = 225`. This confirms `d = 225`.\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** I will substitute the values of `d` and `Σwᵢ` into the formula to compute the invariant. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space P(w1, w2, w3, w4, w5)\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # For a Calabi-Yau hypersurface, the degree 'd' of the defining polynomial\n    # is equal to the sum of the weights.\n    # We can calculate this sum.\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n    d = sum_of_weights\n\n    # The Crawley-Nordström invariant is defined as c_N = d - sum(w_i).\n    c_N = d - sum_of_weights\n\n    # --- Output the results as requested ---\n    print(\"The Crawley-Nordström invariant (c_N) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"c_N = d - Σwᵢ\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe given weights are: {weights}\")\n    \n    # Format the sum of weights for the equation\n    weights_str = \" + \".join(map(str, weights))\n    print(f\"The sum of the weights is: Σwᵢ = {weights_str} = {sum_of_weights}\")\n\n    print(f\"For a Calabi-Yau variety, the degree 'd' equals the sum of the weights, so d = {d}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nPlugging these values into the formula:\")\n    # The final equation showing each number\n    print(f\"c_N = {d} - {sum_of_weights} = {c_N}\")\n\n    # This part is for the final answer format, but we'll print the value\n    # to be captured by the system.\n    # The final output format <<<...>>> will be added at the end of the response.\n    # To avoid printing it here, we can store it.\n    # For this exercise, let's just print the number that will go inside.\n    # print(c_N, file=sys.stderr) # Example of printing for a different stream\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_crawley_nordstrom()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
