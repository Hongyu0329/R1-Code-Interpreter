    print("(a) If the problem of deciding whether S is not free is NP-hard, does that imply the problem of deciding whether S is free is also NP-hard?")
    print("\nReasoning for (a):")
    print("The premise is that NF is NP-hard.")
    print("A theorem in complexity theory states that if a problem L is NP-hard, its complement co-L is co-NP-hard.")
    print("Applying this theorem, since NF is NP-hard, its complement F (= co-NF) must be co-NP-hard.")
    print("The question asks if F is NP-hard. This would mean that any co-NP-hard problem is also NP-hard.")
    print("This is not known to be true. If it were, it would imply that NP = co-NP, a major unresolved question in computer science.")
    print("For instance, TAUTOLOGY is a well-known co-NP-complete problem (and thus co-NP-hard). If it were also NP-hard, then NP = co-NP.")
    print("Since the implication relies on an unproven conjecture, we cannot conclude it is true.")
    answer_a = "No"
    print(f"Therefore, the answer is {answer_a}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Question (b) ---
    print("(b) If the problem of deciding whether S is not free is NP-complete, does that imply the problem of deciding whether S is free is also NP-complete?")
    print("\nReasoning for (b):")
    print("The premise is that NF is NP-complete.")
    print("A problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and is NP-hard.")
    print("The complement of an NP-complete problem is co-NP-complete.")
    print("So, if NF is NP-complete, then its complement F is co-NP-complete.")
    print("The question asks if F is also NP-complete. This would mean F is both NP-complete and co-NP-complete.")
    print("A problem can be both NP-complete and co-NP-complete if and only if NP = co-NP.")
    print("Again, since it is not known whether NP = co-NP (and it is widely believed they are not equal), we cannot conclude the implication holds.")
    answer_b = "No"
    print(f"Therefore, the answer is {answer_b}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Question (c) ---
    print("(c) If the problem of deciding whether S is free is in NP, and the problem of deciding whether S is not free is NP-hard, does that imply the problem of deciding whether S is free is NP-complete?")
    print("\nReasoning for (c):")
    print("The premises are:")
    print("1. F is in NP (F ∈ NP).")
    print("2. NF is NP-hard.")
    print("To prove F is NP-complete, we need to show (i) F ∈ NP and (ii) F is NP-hard.")
    print("Premise (1) already gives us (i). We need to derive (ii).")
    print("From premise (2), NF (= co-F) is NP-hard. As explained in (a), this implies F is co-NP-hard.")
    print("So we have a problem F that is in NP and is also co-NP-hard.")
    print("This has a strong consequence: If a problem L is in NP and is also co-NP-hard, it implies NP = co-NP.")
    print("Proof sketch: Let L_coNPc be any co-NP-complete problem. Since F is co-NP-hard, L_coNPc can be reduced to F. Since F is in NP, and NP is closed under such reductions, L_coNPc must also be in NP. If a co-NP-complete problem is in NP, then co-NP = NP.")
    print("So, the premises imply that NP = co-NP.")
    print("If NP = co-NP, the classes 'NP-hard' and 'co-NP-hard' are identical.")
    print("We already established that F is co-NP-hard. If NP = co-NP, then F must also be NP-hard. This proves (ii).")
    print("Since both conditions for NP-completeness (F ∈ NP and F is NP-hard) are met, the implication is true.")
    answer_c = "Yes"
    print(f"Therefore, the answer is {answer_c}.")
