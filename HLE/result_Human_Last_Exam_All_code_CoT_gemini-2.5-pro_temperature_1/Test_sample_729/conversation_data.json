    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Group Structure**: First, we need to represent the group $Q_{128}$ and its multiplication rule in code. The group $Q_{128}$ is given by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. Its 128 elements can be represented as two types: $\\{x^i \\mid i=0, \\dots, 63\\}$ and $\\{yx^i \\mid i=0, \\dots, 63\\}$. We can use tuples `(type, exponent)` to represent these elements, for example, `(0, i)` for $x^i$ and `(1, i)` for $yx^i$.\n\n2.  **Implement Group Operations**: We will create a function for the group's binary operation (multiplication) based on the presentation rules. We also need a function to compute the power of a group element, $g^k$, which can be done efficiently using exponentiation by squaring.\n\n3.  **Generate Power Subgroups**: A power subgroup $G^k$ is the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in the group, i.e., $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$. The exponent of $Q_{128}$ is 64, which means we only need to compute $G^k$ for $k$ from 1 to 64 to find all unique power subgroups.\n\n4.  **Count Unique Subgroups**: We will iterate through $k$ from 1 to 64, generate each set $G^k$, and store these sets. By using a set data structure to store the (frozen)sets of elements, we can automatically handle duplicates.\n\n5.  **Categorize and Explain**: We can separate the subgroups generated by odd powers of $k$ from those generated by even powers. This will help explain the final count, as requested by the prompt to \"output each number in the final equation.\" The total number of power subgroups will be the sum of the counts from the disjoint sets of subgroups.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef multiply(g1, g2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Multiplies two elements in the generalized quaternion group Q128.\n    Elements are represented as tuples (type, exponent), where:\n    - type 0: element is of the form x^exponent\n    - type 1: element is of the form y*x^exponent\n    The group relations are x^64 = 1, y^2 = x^32, y*x*y^-1 = x^-1.\n    \"\"\"\n    t1, e1 = g1\n    t2, e2 = g2\n    N = 64  # Order of the cyclic subgroup <x>\n    Z = 32  # Power of x for y^2\n\n    if t1 == 0 and t2 == 0:\n        # x^e1 * x^e2 = x^(e1+e2)\n        return (0, (e1 + e2) % N)\n    elif t1 == 0 and t2 == 1:\n        # x^e1 * (y*x^e2) = y*x^(-e1)*x^e2 = y*x^(e2-e1)\n        return (1, (e2 - e1) % N)\n    elif t1 == 1 and t2 == 0:\n        # (y*x^e1) * x^e2 = y*x^(e1+e2)\n        return (1, (e1 + e2) % N)\n    elif t1 == 1 and t2 == 1:\n        # (y*x^e1) * (y*x^e2) = y*x^e1*y*x^e2 = y*y*x^(-e1)*x^e2 = y^2*x^(e2-e1) = x^32*x^(e2-e1)\n        return (0, (Z + e2 - e1) % N)\n\ndef power(g, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes g^k for an element g in Q128 using exponentiation by squaring.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Power must be a non-negative integer.\")\n    \n    # Identity element is x^0\n    identity = (0, 0)\n    \n    if k == 0:\n        return identity\n    \n    res = identity\n    base = g\n    while k > 0:\n        if k % 2 == 1:\n            res = multiply(res, base)\n        base = multiply(base, base)\n        k //= 2\n    return res\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in Q128.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 64\n    Q128 = []\n    for i in range(N):\n        Q128.append((0, i))\n    for i in range(N):\n        Q128.append((1, i))\n\n    odd_k_subgroups = set()\n    even_k_subgroups = set()\n    \n    # The exponent of Q128 is 64.
