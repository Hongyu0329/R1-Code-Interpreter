If they did, with identical Kds and concentrations, the expected kcat would be an average: ( {kcat_al1} + {kcat_al2} ) / 2 = {(kcat_al1 + kcat_al2) / 2}/s. The observed result of {kcat_al1_al2}/s suggests a different mechanism, likely binding at different sites where Al2's effect is dominant. This statement is incorrect.")
