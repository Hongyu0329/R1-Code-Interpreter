    "To find the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  I will create a list of all the players who have won the batting Triple Crown (leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs) in the American or National League.\n2.  I will handle players who have won it multiple times, ensuring they are only counted once as a unique winner.\n3.  I will write a Python script to store this data, print the name and year for each win, and then calculate and display the total number of unique players. The final output will show the summation of each individual winner to arrive at the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    The Triple Crown is awarded to a batter who leads their league in\n    batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBI) in the same season.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of Triple Crown winners: Player -> List of years won\n    # This structure correctly handles players who won multiple times.\n    triple_crown_winners = {\n        \"Paul Hines\": [1878],\n        \"Tip O'Neill\": [1887],\n        \"Hugh Duffy\": [1894],\n        \"Nap Lajoie\": [1901],\n        \"Ty Cobb\": [1909],\n        \"Heinie Zimmerman\": [1912],\n        \"Rogers Hornsby\": [1922, 1925],\n        \"Chuck Klein\": [1933],\n        \"Jimmie Foxx\": [1933],\n        \"Lou Gehrig\": [1934],\n        \"Joe Medwick\": [1937],\n        \"Ted Williams\": [1942, 1947],\n        \"Mickey Mantle\": [1956],\n        \"Frank Robinson\": [1966],\n        \"Carl Yastrzemski\": [1967],\n        \"Miguel Cabrera\": [2012]\n    }\n\n    print(\"MLB Triple Crown Winners List:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Sort the dictionary by the first year won for chronological order\n    sorted_winners = sorted(triple_crown_winners.items(), key=lambda item: item[1][0])\n\n    for player, years in sorted_winners:\n        # Format years for display\n        years_str = \", \".join(map(str, years))\n        print(f\"- {player} ({years_str})\")\n\n    # Calculate the total number of unique winners\n    num_winners = len(triple_crown_winners)\n\n    # Create the equation string \"1 + 1 + ... + 1\"\n    equation = \" + \".join([\"1\"] * num_winners)\n\n    print(\"\\nCalculating the total number of unique winners:\")\n    print(f\"There are {equation} = {num_winners} unique Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\")\n\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<16>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
