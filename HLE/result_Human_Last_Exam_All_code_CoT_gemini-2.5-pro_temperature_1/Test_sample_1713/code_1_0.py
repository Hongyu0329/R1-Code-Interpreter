# A firm's profit or loss is defined as Total Revenue (TR) minus Total Cost (TC).
# Profit/Loss = TR - TC

# From the problem description, we can identify what S and H represent:
# 1. Total Revenue (TR) = Price * Quantity.
#    The area S is the area of the rectangle bounded by the price (P) and the quantity (q1).
#    Therefore, S represents the Total Revenue.
#
# 2. Total Cost (TC) = Average Total Cost * Quantity.
#    The area H is the area of the rectangle bounded by the Average Total Cost (ATC) and the quantity (q1).
#    Therefore, H represents the Total Cost.
#
# By substituting S and H into the profit formula, we get:
# Profit/Loss = S - H

# To demonstrate this, let's use a numerical example that fits the given condition: P < AVC < ATC.
# We will choose some arbitrary values for demonstration.
q1 = 50   # Output level
P = 20    # Market Price, which equals Marginal Cost (MC)
AVC = 25  # Average Variable Cost
ATC = 30  # Average Total Cost

# Check if the condition P < AVC < ATC holds: 20 < 25 < 30. It does.

# Now, let's calculate the values of the areas S and H.
# S = Total Revenue
S = P * q1

# H = Total Cost
H = ATC * q1

# The firm's profit or loss is the difference between S and H.
profit_or_loss = S - H

# The final output will present the equation with these calculated values.
