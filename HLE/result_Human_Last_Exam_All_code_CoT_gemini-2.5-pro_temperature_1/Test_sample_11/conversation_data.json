    "My plan is to first identify the specific Israeli statute that was the first to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" into modern Israeli law. After researching and confirming the name of this law, I will create a simple Python script. This script will store the name of the statute in a variable and then use the `print()` function to display it, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the name of the first statute in the\n# modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\".\n\n# The principle of \"good faith\" was famously and explicitly codified in\n# the Contracts (General Part) Law, particularly in sections 12 and 39.\n# This statute is widely recognized as the primary source for this legal doctrine\n# in modern Israeli law.\n\n# The name of the statute, without \"the\" or its year of enactment.\nstatute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(statute_name)\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which was the first statute in the modern State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\"?
