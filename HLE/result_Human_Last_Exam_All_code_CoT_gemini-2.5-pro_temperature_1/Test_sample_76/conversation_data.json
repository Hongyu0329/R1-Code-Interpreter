    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which the expression $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we need to find the number of integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the behavior for large |x|**: For large values of $|x|$, the behavior of the cubic polynomial $P(x)$ can be compared to the square of a simpler expression. This allows us to establish a finite range of $x$ values outside of which $P(x)$ cannot be a perfect square.\n2.  **Establish a search range**: I will show that for $x \\ge 63$ and $x \\le -39$, the expression $x \\cdot P(x)$ lies strictly between two consecutive perfect squares, which means neither $P(x)$ nor $x \\cdot P(x)$ can be a perfect square. This restricts the search for integer solutions to the range $x \\in [-38, 62]$.\n3.  **Write a script to check the range**: I will write a Python script to iterate through all integers $x$ from -38 to 62.\n4.  **Identify perfect squares**: For each $x$, the script will calculate the value of $P(x)$ and check if it's a non-negative integer and a perfect square.\n5.  **Count and display solutions**: The script will collect all such values of $x$, print the details of each solution, and finally, print the total count of these integers.\n\nThe analytical step to find the search range is based on comparing $x \\cdot P(x)$ with the square of a polynomial in $x$.\nLet's analyze $x P(x) = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x$.\nWe can approximate $\\sqrt{x P(x)}$ with a polynomial in $x$: $x^2 - 8x - 68$.\nLet's look at the difference:\n$(x^2 - 8x - 68)^2 = x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1088x + 4624$.\n$xP(x) - (x^2 - 8x - 68)^2 = (x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1056x) - (x^4 - 16x^3 - 72x^2 + 1088x + 4624) = -32x - 4624$.\nSo, $xP(x) = (x^2 - 8x - 68)^2 - (32x + 4624)$.\n\nFor large enough positive $x$ (specifically $x > -4624/32 = -144.5$), $32x+4624 > 0$, so $xP(x) < (x^2 - 8x - 68)^2$.\nWe can also show that for $x \\ge 63$, we have $(x^2 - 8x - 69)^2 < xP(x)$.\nThis means for $x \\ge 63$, $xP(x)$ is strictly between two consecutive squares, so it cannot be a square itself. This rules out any solutions for $x \\ge 63$.\n\nA similar analysis for large negative $x$ shows that there are no solutions for $x \\le -39$.\nThus, we only need to search for solutions in the integer range $[-38, 62]$. The following Python code will perform this search.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 0:\n        return True\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n\n\ndef p(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the value of the polynomial for a given x.\"\"\"\n    return x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n\ndef find_solutions():\n    \"\"\"Finds and prints all integer solutions in the determined range.\"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    # Based on analysis, we only need to check x in [-38, 62].\n    for x in range(-38, 63):\n        val = p(x)\n        if is_perfect_square(val):\n            solutions.append(x)\n\n    print(\"The integer values of x for which the expression is a perfect square are:\")\n    if not solutions:\n        print(\"None found in the search range.\")\n    else:\n        for x in solutions:\n            y_squared = p(x)\n            y = int(math.sqrt(y_squared))\n            term1 = x**3\n            term2 = -16 * x**2\n            term3 = -72 * x\n            term4 = 1056\n            # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n            print(f\"For x = {x}:\")\n            print(f\"({x})^3 - 16*({x})^2 - 72*({x}) + 1056 = {term1} + ({term2}) + ({term3}) + {term4} = {y_squared} = {y}^2\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe number of such integers is {len(solutions)}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_solutions()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
