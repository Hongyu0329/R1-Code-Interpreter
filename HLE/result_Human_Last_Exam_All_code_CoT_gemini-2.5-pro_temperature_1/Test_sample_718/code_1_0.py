    This problem is a theoretical question in abstract algebra, specifically in the representation theory of posets.
    The final answer is a single integer 'n'.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. A functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable if it has a projective dimension of at most n. A 'tame functor' is a regular indecomposable module over the incidence algebra K[J].
    2. For a tame algebra A with finite global dimension, any regular module M has a projective dimension pd(M) strictly less than the global dimension of A.
    3. The incidence algebra K[J] of a poset J which is tame is known to have a finite global dimension.
    4. For an upper semilattice J, the global dimension of its incidence algebra K[J] is equal to the height of the poset J (length of the longest chain minus 1).
    5. So, for a tame functor f on a tame upper semilattice J, pd(f) < height(J).
    6. We can construct a tame upper semilattice J with height 3. For instance, start with the tame poset W={a<c, b<c, c<e, d<e} (height 2), and add a new minimal element g such that g<a, g<b, g<d. The resulting poset J' is a tame upper semilattice of height 3.
    7. For this poset J', the global dimension of K[J'] is 3.
    8. Any tame functor f over J' must therefore have projective dimension pd(f) < 3, which means pd(f) <= 2.
    9. It is conjectured that a tame upper semilattice cannot have a height of 4 or more. If so, the global dimension is at most 3, and the projective dimension of any tame functor is at most 2.
    10. Therefore, any such functor is 2-resolvable.
