    "Here is a step-by-step plan to calculate the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n\n1.  **Define the Start Year:** The Second Great War begins in the year 2504 with the events of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*.\n2.  **Define the End Year:** The war concludes with the defeat of Amon in the *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void* epilogue, which takes place in the year 2506.\n3.  **Calculate the Duration:** Subtract the start year from the end year to find the total duration in years.\n4.  **Round Up:** Use Python's `math.ceil()` function to round the result up to the nearest whole number, as requested.\n5.  **Display the Result:** Print the full equation and the final rounded-up duration.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1 & 2: Define the start and end years of the Second Great War.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the duration.\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Step 4: Round the duration up to the nearest whole number.\nrounded_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Step 5: Display the equation and the final result.\nprint(f\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore lasted from {start_year} to {end_year}.\")\nprint(\"Calculation of the duration (in years):\")\nprint(f\"{end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"Rounded up, the war lasted for {rounded_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
