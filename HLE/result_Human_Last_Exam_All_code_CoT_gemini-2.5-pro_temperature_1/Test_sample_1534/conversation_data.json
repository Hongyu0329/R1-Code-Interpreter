    "This is a biological question rather than a coding problem. I will provide the answer based on my knowledge of cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a significant part of the subesophageal mass of the cephalopod brain. It is involved in controlling the viscera, mantle, and fins. The brain regions that lie adjacent and posterior to the palliovisceral lobe are primarily the **posterior chromatophore lobes** and the **giant fiber lobes**. These lobes are crucial for controlling the rapid color changes of the skin and the powerful jet-propulsion escape reflex, respectively.\n\n<<<The posterior chromatophore lobes and the giant fiber lobes lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
