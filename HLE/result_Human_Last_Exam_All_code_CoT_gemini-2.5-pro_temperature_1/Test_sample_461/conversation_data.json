    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1.  First, I need to identify the creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago. This timeframe points directly to dinosaurs.\n2.  Next, I'll search for a polycyclic hydrocarbon whose name is derived from \"dinosaur\".\n3.  Finally, I will create a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints the answer in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_hydrocarbon():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The creature in question went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    extinction_period_millions_of_years = 65\n    creature_name = \"dinosaur\"\n    \n    # The polycyclic hydrocarbon is named \"Dinosaurane\".\n    # It is a biomarker found in rocks from that era.\n    hydrocarbon_name = \"Dinosaurane\"\n    \n    # Print the final answer, including the number from the question.\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over {extinction_period_millions_of_years} million years is:\")\n    print(hydrocarbon_name)\n\nfind_hydrocarbon()\n```\n<<<Dinosaurane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What polycyclic hydrocarbon is named after a creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
