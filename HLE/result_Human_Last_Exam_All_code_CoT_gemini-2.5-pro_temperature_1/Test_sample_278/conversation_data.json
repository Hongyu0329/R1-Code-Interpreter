    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we first need to determine the figure's maximum extent in the x and y directions. This will give us the dimensions of the smallest rectangle that can contain the figure.\n\n1.  **Analyze the x-coordinate:** The x-coordinate is given by `x = cos(t)`. As `t` varies from `0` to `2*pi`, the cosine function `cos(t)` covers its full range of values, which is from -1 to 1. So, the minimum value of `x` is -1 and the maximum is 1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the y-coordinate:** The y-coordinate has two different definitions:\n    *   For `t` in `[0, pi]`, `y = sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from 0 to 1. Thus, the y-values are in the interval `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(pi, 2*pi)`, `y = 5 * sin(t)`. In this interval, `sin(t)` ranges from -1 to 0 (not including 0). Multiplying by 5, the y-values are in the interval `[-5, 0)`.\n\n3.  **Combine the ranges:**\n    *   The total range for `x` is `[-1, 1]`. The width of the figure is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`. The height of the figure is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Find the smallest enclosing square:** The figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. To enclose this rectangle in a square, the side length of the square must be equal to the larger of these two dimensions. Therefore, the side length of the smallest enclosing square is `max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of a square with a side length of 6 is `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Determine the range of the x-coordinate.\n# x = cos(t) for t in [0, 2*pi].\n# The range of cos(t) is [-1, 1].\nx_min = -1\nx_max = 1\nprint(f\"The minimum value of x is {x_min}.\")\nprint(f\"The maximum value of x is {x_max}.\")\n\n# Step 2: Determine the range of the y-coordinate.\n# For t in [0, pi], y = sin(t), which ranges from 0 to 1.\n# For t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t), which ranges from -5 to 0.\n# The overall range for y is the union of [0, 1] and [-5, 0), which is [-5, 1].\ny_min = -5\ny_max = 1\nprint(f\"The minimum value of y is {y_min}.\")\nprint(f\"The maximum value of y is {y_max}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\nprint(f\"The total width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}.\")\nprint(f\"The total height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Determine the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n# The side length is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}.\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\nprint(f\"The area of the smallest enclosing square is {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}.\")\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
