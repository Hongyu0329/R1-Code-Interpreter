    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$, and as it's an electron, its spin quantum number is $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum ($j$)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, is found by combining $l$ and $s$. The possible values for $j$ range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n3.  **Determine Magnetic Quantum Number ($m_j$)**: For each value of $j$, the associated magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $J^2$ operator is given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the $J_z$ operator is given by $\\hbar m_j$.\n5.  **Implementation**: I will provide a Python script to perform these calculations. The script will first determine the possible values for $j$. Then, for each $j$, it will calculate the $J^2$ eigenvalue and find all possible $m_j$ values. Finally, it will calculate the $J_z$ eigenvalue for each $(j, m_j)$ pair and print the results, showing the numbers used in the eigenvalue equations. For simplicity, the script will use $\\hbar=1$ and explicitly state the units in the output.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve for the eigenvalues:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum for p-shell\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l = {l} and s = {s}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible total angular momentum quantum numbers (j)\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are {list(j_values)}.\\n\")\n\n    # Header for the results\n    print(\"The common eigenvalues for J^2 and J_z are determined for each state |j, mj>:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Sort j values in descending order for conventional representation\n    j_values = sorted(j_values, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate and print eigenvalues for each j and corresponding m_j\n    for j in j_values:\n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n        print(f\"  The J^2 eigenvalue is j(j+1)hbar^2 = {j} * ({j} + 1) hbar^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue:.2f} hbar^2\")\n\n        # Determine possible m_j values\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"  The corresponding m_j values range from -{j} to +{j}:\")\n        \n        # Calculate J_z eigenvalue for each m_j\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            j_z_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"    For m_j = {m_j: >4.1f}, the J_z eigenvalue is {j_z_eigenvalue: >4.1f} hbar\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 70)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<J^2 eigenvalues: 3.75 hbar^2, 0.75 hbar^2.
