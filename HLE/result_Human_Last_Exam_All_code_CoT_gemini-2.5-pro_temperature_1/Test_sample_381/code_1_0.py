# Plan:
# 1. Identify the core question: Find the upper-bound for ||B * Q_{0, M}||_infinity as a factor of sqrt(N).
# 2. Recall the relevant theorem from the literature on GNN dynamics, which is hinted at by the provided text and notation. The text is a summary of the setup for a theorem about the stability of GNN layers.
# 3. The theorem states that ||B * Q_{0, M}||_infinity <= 2 * sqrt(N) * Product_{t=0 to M}(1 - c * delta_t).
# 4. Extract the factor of sqrt(N) from this inequality.
# 5. Construct a Python script to print this factor, explicitly including the numbers from the formula as requested.

# The numbers that appear in the final formula for the factor.
number_two = 2
number_one = 1
number_zero = 0

# The formula for the factor is derived from an inequality for the bound.
# Let F be the factor.
# The expression involves a product from t=0 to M.
# We will represent the expression as a formatted string.

factor_expression = f"{number_two} * Product_{{t={number_zero} to M}}({number_one} - c * delta_t)"
