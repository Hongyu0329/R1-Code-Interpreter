    """
    This function explains and provides the solution to the mathematical problem.
    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of a countable intersection
    of open dense subsets of a specific topological space P(X).

    The solution relies on the Baire Category Theorem and properties of Polish spaces.
    The analysis shows that the space P(X) is a perfect Polish space.
    Any countable intersection of open dense subsets in such a space results in a
    dense G_delta set, which is itself a perfect Polish space.

    A fundamental theorem of descriptive set theory states that any perfect Polish
    space has the cardinality of the continuum.
