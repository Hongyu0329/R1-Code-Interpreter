def solve():
    """
    This function provides the solution based on the theoretical analysis of the algorithm.

    The analysis shows that for all three classes of graphs (cycles, bounded-degree trees,
    and general bounded-degree graphs), the number of steps required by the algorithm
    is Theta(log n) with high probability.

    1. For a cycle, the maximum degree is 2. The analysis for bounded-degree graphs
       gives an O(log n) upper bound. A path-like structure provides an Omega(log n)
       lower bound. Hence, f_1(n) = Theta(log n).

    2. For a tree with max degree <= 100, it's a bounded-degree graph, so O(log n)
       is an upper bound. A path is a tree, providing an Omega(log n) lower bound.
       Hence, f_2(n) = Theta(log n).

    3. For any graph with max degree <= 100, the O(log n) upper bound and Omega(log n)
       lower bound (from the path graph case) apply. Hence, f_3(n) = Theta(log n).

    A function f(n) = Theta(log n) falls into the category 9: f(n) = Omega(log n).
    Therefore, d1=9, d2=9, and d3=9.
