    explanation_a = """
(a) Is alpha(K) context-free for every rational subset K of F?

Answer: Yes.

Reasoning: This is a standard theorem in the intersection of group theory and formal language theory. A subset K of a free group F is called rational if the language of its freely reduced words (with respect to a basis A) is a regular language. It is a well-established result that for any such rational subset K, its conjugacy closure, alpha(K), is a context-free subset. This means the language of freely reduced words for alpha(K) is a context-free language. This can be proven by constructing a pushdown automaton that recognizes alpha(K) by using the finite automaton for K as a component.

    # --- Analysis of Question (b) ---
    explanation_b = """
(b) If alpha(K) is context-free, does this imply that Geo(alpha(K)) is also context-free?

Answer: Yes.

Reasoning: This question is about understanding the definitions. In the context of a free group F with a given basis, Geo(S) denotes the set of geodesics for a subset S, which corresponds to the language of freely reduced words representing the elements of S. A subset S of F is defined as being 'context-free' if and only if its language of geodesics, Geo(S), is a context-free language. Therefore, the statement 'If the subset alpha(K) is context-free, then the language Geo(alpha(K)) is context-free' is true by definition.
"""

    # --- Analysis of Question (c) ---
    explanation_c = """
(c) If K is context-free, determine if Geo(alpha(K)) must be context-free for a different choice of generating set A'.

Answer: No.

Reasoning: The core of this question is whether the conjugacy closure of a context-free set is always context-free. The reference to a 'different choice of generating set' is secondary, because the property of a subset of a free group being context-free does not depend on the choice of the finite basis. If Geo_A(S) is a context-free language for a basis A, it will be context-free for any other basis A'.

Thus, the question simplifies to: if K is a context-free subset, is alpha(K) also a context-free subset? The answer is no. There are known counterexamples that show the class of context-free subsets of a free group is not closed under taking the conjugacy closure. For instance, if F is the free group on {a,b,c,d}, the language L = {a^n b^n | n >= 1} U {c^m d^m | m >= 1} corresponds to a context-free subset K, but its conjugacy closure alpha(K) is not a context-free subset. For such a K, Geo(alpha(K)) is not a context-free language, regardless of the generating set chosen.
