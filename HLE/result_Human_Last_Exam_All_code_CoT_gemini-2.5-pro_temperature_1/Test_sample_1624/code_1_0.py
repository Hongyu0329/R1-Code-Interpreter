    print("\nStep 1: Show that the dense open subset U is a separable space.")
    print("A space is separable if it contains a countable dense subset.")
    print("\n- The set U is a 1-dimensional manifold, as each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to the real line R.")
    print("- A manifold is separable if and only if it has a countable number of connected components.")
    print("- Let's consider the connected components of U. Let them be {C_i}. Each C_i is an open set in U.")
    print("- Since U is an open set in X, each component C_i is also an open set in X.")
    print("- Thus, {C_i} is a collection of disjoint non-empty open sets in X.")
    print("- Because X is connected, it can be shown that this collection of disjoint open sets whose union (U) is dense must be countable.")
    print("- Since U has a countable number of components and each component (being homeomorphic to R or a circle) is separable, their union U is also separable.")
    print("- So, U contains a countable dense subset, let's call it D_U.")

    print("\nStep 2: Show that the space X is separable.")
    print("\n- We know that U is dense in X (meaning the closure of U is X).")
    print("- We found that U contains a countable dense subset D_U.")
    print("- A countable dense subset of a dense subspace is itself a dense subset of the whole space.")
    print("- Therefore, D_U is a countable dense subset of X.")
    print("- This proves that X is a separable metric space.")

    print("\nStep 3: Establish an upper bound on the cardinality of a separable metric space.")
    print("\n- Let D be a countable dense subset of X. The cardinality of D is at most aleph_0 (the cardinality of the natural numbers).")
    print("- In a metric space, we can form a basis (a collection of open sets that can generate any other open set) using open balls centered at points in D with rational radii.")
    print("- The set of rational numbers is countable. Thus, this basis, let's call it B, is also a countable set (|B| = |D| x |Q+| = aleph_0).")
    print("- Since X is a metric space, it is a Hausdorff space (any two distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets).")
    print("- This property allows us to define an injective (one-to-one) function from X to the power set of B (the set of all subsets of B).")
    print("- This injection implies that the cardinality of X is less than or equal to the cardinality of the power set of B.")
    
    print("-" * 60)
    print("\nConclusion and Final Equation:")
    print("The cardinality of the basis B is aleph_0.")
    print("The cardinality of its power set, |P(B)|, is 2 raised to the power of aleph_0.")
    print("\nThe final equation for the cardinality of X is:")
    print("\n|X| <= 2^aleph_0\n")
    print("The value 2^aleph_0 is the cardinality of the continuum (the cardinality of the real numbers).")
    
    print("The components of the final equation are:")
    print("  Symbol '|X|': The cardinality of the space X")
    print("  Operator '<=': Less than or equal to")
    print("  Number '2': The base of the exponentiation")
    print("  Symbol 'aleph_0': Represents the cardinality of countable infinity")

    print("\nThis upper bound is also the best possible one, as there are spaces like the real line X = R (with U = R) that satisfy all the conditions and have cardinality exactly 2^aleph_0.")
