    # Step 2: Formulate the result based on the derivation.
    # The solvability condition for the nonlinear boundary value problem, assuming a typo correction
    # (alpha_i^2 = 1 - e^{-T} instead of alpha_i = 1 - e^{-T}), leads to the conclusion that
    # the set of valid initial conditions (x_i^0, y_i^0) for each i must lie on an ellipse defined by:
    # (x_i^0)^2 / A_i^2 + (y_i^0)^2 / B_i^2 = 1 / (n - 1)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the area of a single ellipse (S_i).
    # The area of an ellipse (x/a)^2 + (y/b)^2 = 1 is pi*a*b.
    # From our equation, the squared semi-axes are a_i^2 = A_i^2 / (n - 1) and b_i^2 = B_i^2 / (n - 1).
    # So, the area S_i = pi * (A_i / sqrt(n - 1)) * (B_i / sqrt(n - 1)) = pi * A_i * B_i / (n - 1).
    
    # Step 4: Calculate the total area S.
    # S is the sum of these areas. Since A_i and B_i are constant for all i:
    # S = n * S_i = n * pi * A * B / (n - 1).
    
    # Step 5: Calculate the required value S / (2025 * pi).
    # Since n = 2025, this is equivalent to S / (n * pi).
    # Value = (n * pi * A * B / (n - 1)) / (n * pi) = (A * B) / (n - 1).
    
    # Step 6: Perform the final calculation.
