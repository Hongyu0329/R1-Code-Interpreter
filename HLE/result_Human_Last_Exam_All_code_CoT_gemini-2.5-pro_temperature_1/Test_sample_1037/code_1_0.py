def solve_scale_cardinalities():
    """
    This function determines the cardinalities of the specified group quotients
    based on the definitions of scales, prescales, and their initial and terminal objects.

    Plan:
    1. Identify the initial object A and terminal object B in the category of maps from Z to prescales.
       - Initial Object A: (id: Z -> Z). This is a 'scale' as it's a nontrivial map. Its codomain is Z.
       - Terminal Object B: (zero: Z -> {0}). This is the terminal object in the wider category of all maps from Z. Its codomain is {0}.

    2. Determine the quotient S/A = cod(S) / im(A->S).
       - S is the inclusion Z -> *R (the hyperreals). cod(S) is *R.
       - The map A->S is the inclusion Z -> *R. Its image is Z.
       - The quotient is *R / Z. The cardinality is |*R| = c = Beth_1.

    3. Determine the quotient B/S = cod(B) / im(S->B).
       - cod(B) is the trivial group {0}.
       - The map S->B is the zero map *R -> {0}. Its image is {0}.
       - The quotient is {0} / {0}, which has cardinality 1.

    4. Determine the homology group H_1(B/A, Q).
       - The space B/A is cod(B) / im(A->B) = {0} / {0}, which is a point space.
       - The first homology group of a point space, H_1(point, Q), is the trivial group {0}.
       - The cardinality of this group is 1.
