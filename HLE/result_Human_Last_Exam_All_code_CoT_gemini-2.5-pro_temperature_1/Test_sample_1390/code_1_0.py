    Calculates the number of new intersection points in a hypothetical geometric system.

    The calculation is based on the following logic:
    1. A triangle has 3 vertices.
    2. The new parallel postulate states there are 3 parallels through a point not on a line.
    3. New lines are drawn through each vertex parallel to the opposite side.
       - 3 lines through A, parallel to BC.
       - 3 lines through B, parallel to AC.
       - 3 lines through C, parallel to AB.
    4. New intersection points are formed by the intersection of these new sets of lines.
    5. There are C(3, 2) = 3 pairs of these sets of new lines.
    6. Each pair of sets (e.g., lines through A and lines through B) creates 3 * 3 = 9 intersection points.
    7. The total number of new points is the sum of intersections from all pairs of sets.
