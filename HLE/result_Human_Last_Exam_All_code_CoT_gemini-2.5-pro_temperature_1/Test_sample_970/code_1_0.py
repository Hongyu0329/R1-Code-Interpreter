    Analyzes the necessary assumptions for the expected information gain of a Bayesian agent to converge to zero.

    The core of the proof relies on the fact that the total expected information gain
    is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution.
    Total Expected Information Gain = sum_{t=0 to inf} EIG_t <= H(Prior)

    For the sum of non-negative EIG_t terms to be finite, which is required for the
    terms to converge to zero, the upper bound H(Prior) must be finite.
    Therefore, the prior having finite entropy is a necessary assumption.

    The other options are either sufficient but not necessary (e.g., posterior entropy
    approaching zero) or irrelevant to the core information-theoretic proof.

    The selected option is (a).
    In Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) as specified, this is represented as [(a)].
