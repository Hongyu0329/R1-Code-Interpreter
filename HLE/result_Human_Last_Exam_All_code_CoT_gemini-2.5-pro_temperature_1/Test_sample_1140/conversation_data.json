    "The most helpful technique for synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid (UAA) like azido phenylalanine is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** Synthesizing a 100aa peptide is challenging for standard Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) due to decreasing yields with each step. Incorporating a UAA is straightforward in SPPS but difficult with standard recombinant methods.\n2.  **Evaluate Options:**\n    *   **Direct SPPS:** Impractical for a 100aa peptide. The final yield would be extremely low, and purification would be a major challenge.\n    *   **Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion:** A powerful technique but requires significant molecular biology to engineer an orthogonal tRNA/synthetase pair in a host organism.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is the ideal approach. The 100aa peptide is broken down into smaller, manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa peptides). These fragments are synthesized efficiently using SPPS, allowing for easy incorporation of the azido phenylalanine at the desired position. The fragments are then chemically joined (ligated) together in solution to form the full-length peptide. This method bypasses the cumulative yield problem of direct SPPS.\n3.  **Propose a Supporting Script:** To demonstrate why direct SPPS is not feasible, I will write a Python script. This script will calculate the dramatic loss in theoretical yield for a 100aa peptide, quantitatively supporting the choice of NCL. The script will calculate the final yield based on an optimistic per-step coupling efficiency.\n\nHere is the python code to illustrate the yield problem with SPPS.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spps_yield():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum yield for a peptide synthesized\n    via Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\n\n    This demonstrates why SPPS is not suitable for long peptides like the\n    100-amino-acid one in the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptide_length = 100\n    # A 99.0% yield per coupling step is optimistic; in practice, it can be lower.\n    step_yield_percent = 99.0\n\n    # The number of coupling reactions is one less than the peptide length.\n    num_coupling_steps = peptide_length - 1\n    step_yield_decimal = step_yield_percent / 100.0\n\n    # The final yield is the step yield raised to the power of the number of steps.\n    final_yield = step_yield_decimal ** num_coupling_steps\n    final_yield_percent = final_yield * 100\n\n    print(\"--- SPPS Yield Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Peptide Length: {peptide_length} amino acids\")\n    print(f\"Assumed Yield per Step: {step_yield_percent}%\")\n    print(f\"Number of Coupling Steps: {num_coupling_steps}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final theoretical yield is calculated as:\")\n    # The final print statement shows the full equation as requested.\n    print(f\"Final Yield = ({step_yield_decimal})^{num_coupling_steps}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {final_yield_percent:.2f}%\")\n    print(\"\\nThis low theoretical yield makes purification extremely difficult and\")\n    print(\"demonstrates why alternative methods like Native Chemical Ligation are preferred.\")\n\ncalculate_spps_yield()\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
