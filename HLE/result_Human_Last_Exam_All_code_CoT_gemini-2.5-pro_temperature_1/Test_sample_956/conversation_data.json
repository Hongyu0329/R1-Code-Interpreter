    "My plan is to solve this problem by first identifying the group G using established theorems from permutation group theory. Once G is identified, I will use the known result for its Schur multiplier, A. Finally, I will analyze the subgroup structure of A to count the number of its proper subgroups up to isomorphism. The Python code below will formalize this line of reasoning, show the numbers involved in each step, and print the final result.\n\nThe core steps are:\n1.  Prove that the group G is the alternating group on 12 elements, A_12. This relies on G being a transitive group of degree 12 that contains an 11-cycle and is generated by even permutations.\n2.  State the standard result that the Schur multiplier of A_12 is the cyclic group of order 2, Z_2.\n3.  Count the number of isomorphism classes of proper subgroups of Z_2. A proper subgroup is any subgroup except the group itself.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the problem by identifying the group G, its Schur multiplier A,\n    and then counting the isomorphism classes of proper subgroups of A.\n    It prints the reasoning and the final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the group G.\n    # The group G acts on a set of 12 elements.
