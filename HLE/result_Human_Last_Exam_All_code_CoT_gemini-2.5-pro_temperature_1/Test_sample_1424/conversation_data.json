    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, describes the propagation of a particle in the absence of interactions. Its functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is most clearly expressed in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ space.\n\nThe relationship is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta \\cdot \\text{sgn}(\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\nwhere:\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for a state with quantum number $k$.\n*   $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n*   $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term (with $\\eta \\to 0^+$) that ensures the correct causal structure of the propagator. The sign of this term depends on whether the state $\\epsilon_k$ is above or below the Fermi level (defined by $\\mu$).\n\nA simpler, often-used form for the retarded Green's function is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nThis equation shows that the Green's function has a pole in the complex frequency plane at the energy of the single-particle state.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of the retarded bare Green's function for a given frequency `omega` and a single-particle energy `epsilon_k`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for given parameters.\n\n    The formula for the retarded Green's function is:\n    G_0(k, omega) = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n    where:\n    - omega is the frequency.\n    - epsilon_k is the single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n    - eta is a small positive infinitesimal.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define example parameters\n    omega = 2.5  # Frequency in some energy units\n    epsilon_k = 2.0  # Single-particle energy eigenvalue\n    eta = 0.1  # A small positive value for numerical calculation\n\n    # Calculate the Green's function\n    # In Python, the imaginary unit is represented by 'j'\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    # Print the equation with the numbers plugged in\n    print(\"The formula for the bare Green's function is: G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\")\n    print(f\"Given the values: omega = {omega}, epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}, eta = {eta}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / (({omega} - {epsilon_k}) + {eta}j)\")\n    \n    # Print the final result\n    print(f\"\\nThe calculated value of the Green's function is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {G0}\")\n\ncalculate_bare_greens_function()\n```\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$, expressed as $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k}$.>>>"
