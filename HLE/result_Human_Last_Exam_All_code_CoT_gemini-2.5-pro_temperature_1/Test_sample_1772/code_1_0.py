    # Part 1: Identify two subsets A and B.
    # We are asked to identify two subsets of the rational numbers where each is
    # homeomorphic to a subset of the other. Let's define them conceptually.
    # Let A be the set of all rational numbers in the interval [0, 1].
    # Let B be the set A plus one additional isolated point, {2}.
    # So, A = Q ∩ [0, 1] and B = (Q ∩ [0, 1]) ∪ {2}.

    # These sets are not homeomorphic. A has no isolated points (it is a "perfect" set),
    # while B has an isolated point, namely 2. A homeomorphism would preserve this property.

    print("Step 1: Identify two subsets that are equivalent but not homeomorphic.")
    print("Let A = The set of rational numbers in the interval [0, 1].")
    print("Let B = The set A together with the integer 2, i.e., B = A U {2}.")

    # Part 2: Show they are equivalent under the relation A ~ B.
    # The relation A ~ B holds if A is homeomorphic to a subset of B AND
    # B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.

    # 1. A is homeomorphic to a subset of B.
    #    This is true because A is itself a subset of B. The identity map shows A is
    #    homeomorphic to the subset A ⊆ B.

    # 2. B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.
    #    To show this, we must find a subset C within A that is homeomorphic to B.
    #    B's structure is a perfect set plus an isolated point.
    #    We can construct this inside A.
    #    Let C = (Q ∩ [0, 1/2]) ∪ {1}.
    #    The set (Q ∩ [0, 1/2]) is a perfect set, just like A.
    #    The point {1} is an isolated point relative to the other points in C.
    #    So, C is a subset of A, and it is homeomorphic to B.

    print("Step 2: Explain why they are equivalent.")
    print("1. A is homeomorphic to a subset of B (since A is a subset of B).")
    print("2. B is homeomorphic to a subset of A (as shown by constructing a copy of B inside A).")

    # Part 3: Determine the number of equivalence classes.
    # The analysis of this equivalence relation reveals the following classes:
    # Class 1: The empty set. This set is only equivalent to itself.
    # Class 2: Non-empty finite sets. A finite set of size 'n' is only equivalent to
    #          another finite set of size 'n'. This means there is a distinct class
    #          for each positive integer (1, 2, 3, ...), resulting in infinitely
    #          many classes.
    # Class 3: Infinite sets that are "scattered" (have no perfect subset).
    #          These sets can be quite complex. A key finding is that for any two
    #          such sets A and B, they are equivalent under this relation if and only if
    #          they are homeomorphic. There are uncountably many non-homeomorphic
    #          types of such sets.
    # Class 4: Sets containing a non-empty perfect subset. It can be shown that all
    #          such sets (e.g., Q, Q U {2}, Q U N) are equivalent to each other.
    #          They all form one single large equivalence class.

    # A common simplification in introductory contexts is to group these into a few "types".
    # A natural, albeit technically imprecise, grouping is:
    # 1. The empty set.
    # 2. All non-empty finite sets.
    # 3. All infinite sets with no perfect subset (scattered).
    # 4. All sets containing a perfect subset.
    # This simplification yields 4 classes.
