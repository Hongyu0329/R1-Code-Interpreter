# The problem asks for the minimal possible area (2D dimension) of a compact set C
# with a specific property. The property is that for any direction, there is a line
# in that direction whose intersection with C has a length (1D dimension) of at least 1/2.

# This is equivalent to finding the minimum area of a set C whose longest chord
# in any direction is at least 1/2. This is a known isodiametric problem.
# The shape that minimizes area for a given minimum diameter (d_min) is an
# equilateral triangle with height h = d_min.

# In our case, the minimum diameter must be 1/2.
d_min = 0.5
h = d_min

# The area of such a triangle can be calculated.
# The side length (L) of an equilateral triangle is related to its height (h) by:
# L = h / sin(60 degrees) = h / (sqrt(3)/2)
# The area is (sqrt(3)/4) * L^2.
# Substituting L, Area = (sqrt(3)/4) * (h / (sqrt(3)/2))^2
# Area = (sqrt(3)/4) * h^2 / (3/4) = h^2 / sqrt(3).
# For h=1/2, Area = (1/2)^2 / sqrt(3) = (1/4) / sqrt(3) = 1 / (4*sqrt(3)).
# This simplifies to sqrt(3) / 12.

# Let's calculate this value.
# The final equation for the area is sqrt(3) / 12.
