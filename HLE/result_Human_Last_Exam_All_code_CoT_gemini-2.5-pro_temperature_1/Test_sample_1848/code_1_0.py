    # So, omega_3 is the third uncountable cardinal, and omega_4 is the fourth.

    # Problem statement summary:
    # - Base set size: omega_4
    # - Collection A contains subsets of the base set.
    # - For each set 'a' in A, its cardinality |a| is omega_4.
    # - For any two distinct sets 'a' and 'b' in A, |a intersect b| < omega_4.
    #   (This is equivalent to |a intersect b| <= omega_3).
