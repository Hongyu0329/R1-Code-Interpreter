            "explanation": "This is correct because both Eristalini (a tribe of hoverflies) and species within Melipotini (a tribe of moths) are groups known to contain Batesian mimics. Batesian mimicry is when a harmless species evolves to imitate the warning signals (like color) of a harmful species. Both groups contain well-known examples of this phenomenon."

            "description": "5) Müllerian, Heliconiini - color, Melipotini - color",
            "explanation": "This is correct because butterflies in the Heliconiini tribe and certain moths in the Melipotini tribe are classic Müllerian co-mimics. They are both unpalatable to predators and have evolved to share similar warning coloration. This mutual mimicry benefits both species by reinforcing the learning process for predators."

            "description": "8) Aposematism, Danaus plexipus - wing, Cycnia tenera - tymbal",
            "explanation": "This is correct as both species are textbook examples of aposematism (warning signaling). The Monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) advertises its toxicity with its bright wing colors (a visual signal). The Dogbane tiger moth (Cycnia tenera) warns predatory bats of its unpalatability by producing ultrasonic clicks with its tymbal organs (an acoustic signal)."
