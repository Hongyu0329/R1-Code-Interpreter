# This script calculates the final answer based on the derived formula and known combinatorial values for the Rubik's Cube.

# W(k, I) is the number of k-move sequences that return the cube to the identity state.
# For an odd number of moves, W(k, I) is 0.
# For an even number of moves, the values are known from computational searches in cube theory.

# Number of ways to return to solved state in 4 moves.
W4 = 132

# Number of ways to return to solved state in 6 moves.
W6 = 2028

# The total number of permutations is derived from the formula:
# Total = 132 * W(4, I) + W(6, I)
total_permutations = 132 * W4 + W6

# The final equation is constructed from these parts.
# We print each number involved in the calculation.
