    "This is a classic organic chemistry problem involving a directed ortho-metalation (DoM) reaction. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Identify the Starting Material and Reagents:**\n    *   **Starting Material:** N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. This molecule has a benzene ring with two functional groups: a diethylamide group (`-CONEt2`) and a dimethylamino group (`-NMe2`) at positions 1 and 3, respectively.\n    *   **Reagent 1:** `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium) and `TMEDA`. This is a very strong base combination used to deprotonate a C-H bond, typically on an aromatic ring.\n    *   **Reagent 2:** Methyl iodide (`CH3I`). This is an electrophile that will react with the intermediate formed in the first step.\n\n2.  **Analyze the First Reaction Step (Directed ortho-Metalation):**\n    *   The `sec-BuLi`/`TMEDA` system is designed for a reaction called directed ortho-metalation. In this reaction, a functional group on the benzene ring, called a Directed Metalation Group (DMG), coordinates to the lithium ion (`Li+`) and directs the base to remove a proton from the adjacent (*ortho*) position.\n    *   Our starting material has two excellent DMGs: the diethylamide (`-CONEt2`) and the dimethylamino (`-NMe2`). The amide group is generally a stronger DMG than the amino group.\n    *   The proton at position 2 is *ortho* to both the amide and the amino group. The proton at position 4 is *ortho* to the amino group, and the proton at position 6 is *ortho* to the amide group.\n    *   The proton at position 2 is the most acidic and will be removed preferentially. This is because it is activated by both directing groups (a synergistic effect), and its removal allows the formation of a very stable six-membered ring chelate intermediate with the lithium ion, the amide oxygen, and the amine nitrogen.\n    *   This step forms a new species called an aryllithium, where a lithium atom replaces the hydrogen at position 2.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Second Reaction Step (Electrophilic Quench):**\n    *   The aryllithium intermediate is a potent nucleophile (it has a carbanion character on the benzene ring).\n    *   This nucleophile is then treated with methyl iodide (`CH3I`).\n    *   The nucleophilic carbon at position 2 of the ring will attack the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide, displacing the iodide ion.\n\n4.  **Determine the Final Product:**\n    *   A new carbon-carbon bond is formed between position 2 of the benzene ring and a methyl group.\n    *   The final compound is the starting molecule with a methyl group added at the 2-position.\n\nTherefore, the product is **N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n```python\ndef get_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of the described chemical reaction.\n    \n    The reaction is a directed ortho-metalation of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide,\n    followed by quenching with methyl iodide.\n    \n    Step 1: The combination of sec-BuLi and TMEDA deprotonates the most acidic aromatic proton.\n    The proton at position 2 is ortho to both the strong N,N-diethylamide directing group\n    and the N,N-dimethylamino group, making it the most favorable site for lithiation.\n    \n    Step 2: The resulting aryllithium intermediate acts as a nucleophile and attacks\n    the electrophilic methyl iodide.\n    \n    Step 3: A methyl group is added at position 2 of the aromatic ring.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    starting_material = \"N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    substituent_added = \"methyl\"\n    position_of_substitution = 2\n    \n    # Construct the final product name\n    product_name = f\"N,N-diethyl-{position_of_substitution}-{substituent_added}-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\"\n    \n    print(f\"The final product is: {product_name}\")\n\nget_reaction_product()\n```\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
