    This function determines the product of the described chemical reaction.
    
    The reaction is a directed ortho-metalation of N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide,
    followed by quenching with methyl iodide.
    
    Step 1: The combination of sec-BuLi and TMEDA deprotonates the most acidic aromatic proton.
    The proton at position 2 is ortho to both the strong N,N-diethylamide directing group
    and the N,N-dimethylamino group, making it the most favorable site for lithiation.
    
    Step 2: The resulting aryllithium intermediate acts as a nucleophile and attacks
    the electrophilic methyl iodide.
    
    Step 3: A methyl group is added at position 2 of the aromatic ring.
