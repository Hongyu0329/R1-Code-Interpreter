    Analyzes the properties of SWAP gate variants to determine the correct matrix structure.

    1.  A SWAP gate variant must respect the fundamental separation of symmetric and
        asymmetric qubit states. It should not mix states from span{|00>, |11>}
        with states from span{|01>, |10>}. This leads to a block-diagonal structure
        in that basis, which in the standard basis {|00>,|01>,|10>,|11>} looks like:
        [[A, 0, 0, D],
         [0, F, G, 0],
         [0, J, K, 0],
         [M, 0, 0, P]]

    2.  The condition that the gate is "correctable post-swap by Alice and Bob in
        their own separate environments" imposes a crucial constraint. If the gate
        could turn |00> into |11> (i.e., if M or D were non-zero), this would
        represent a non-local transformation that cannot be corrected by Alice and Bob
        acting independently on their own qubits. Therefore, for local correctability,
        we must have M=0 and D=0.

    3.  This leaves a structure that is block-diagonal in the standard basis,
        separating the subspaces for 0 excitations (|00>), 1 excitation ({|01>, |10>}),
        and 2 excitations (|11>). The matrix must look like:
        [[A, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, F, G, 0],
         [0, J, K, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, P]]

    4.  This structure represents the most general form of a two-qubit gate that
        conserves the number of excitations. The standard SWAP, iSWAP, and fSWAP
        gates are all special cases of this structure (with F=K=0).

    5.  Comparing this required structure with the given answer choices, only
        option D matches.
