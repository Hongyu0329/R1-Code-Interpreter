    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we need to make a few standard assumptions about the terminology of surface codes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Interpret the setup**:\n    *   **\"Two patches\"**: This means we have two separate, independent surface codes. The total number of logical qubits will be the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n    *   **\"Surface code\"**: We'll assume this refers to a standard planar code, which has a topological genus of 0.\n    *   **\"with two holes\"**: In the context of planar surface codes, a \"hole\" is a defect, or an inner boundary, created within the lattice of physical qubits. A standard patch already has one outer boundary. Adding \"two holes\" means we are creating two additional inner boundaries. Therefore, each patch will have a total of `1 (outer) + 2 (inner) = 3` boundaries.\n\n2.  **Apply the formula**:\n    *   For a single planar surface code (genus 0) with `b` boundaries, the number of logical qubits `k` it can encode is given by the formula: `k = b - 1`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total**:\n    *   First, calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch with 3 boundaries.\n    *   Then, multiply this by the number of patches (which is 2) to get the total maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python code**:\n    *   The code will define variables for the number of patches and holes.\n    *   It will perform the calculations as described above.\n    *   Finally, it will print a clear explanation of the calculation, showing each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for the given surface code setup.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1. Define the parameters based on the problem statement.\n    num_patches = 2\n    # \"two holes\" is interpreted as two inner boundaries (defects) per patch.\n    num_inner_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # 2. Calculate the total number of boundaries for a single patch.\n    # Each patch has 1 outer boundary plus the specified inner holes.\n    num_boundaries_per_patch = num_inner_holes_per_patch + 1\n\n    # 3. Calculate the number of logical qubits for a single patch.\n    # The formula for a planar code is k = b - 1, where b is the number of boundaries.\n    logical_qubits_per_patch = num_boundaries_per_patch - 1\n\n    # 4. Calculate the total number of logical qubits for all patches.\n    # Since the patches are independent, we sum the logical qubits from each.\n    total_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\n    # 5. Print the step-by-step reasoning and the final result.\n    print(\"To find the maximum number of logical qubits, we follow these steps:\")\n    print(f\"1. We have {num_patches} separate patches of surface code.\")\n    print(f\"2. Each patch is described as having {num_inner_holes_per_patch} holes. In a planar code, a patch inherently has 1 outer boundary. The 'holes' are additional inner boundaries.\")\n    print(f\"3. Thus, each patch has 1 (outer boundary) + {num_inner_holes_per_patch} (inner holes) = {num_boundaries_per_patch} boundaries in total.\")\n    print(f\"4. The number of logical qubits in a single planar patch is given by the formula: (Number of Boundaries) - 1.\")\n    print(f\"   So, for one patch: {num_boundaries_per_patch} - 1 = {logical_qubits_per_patch} logical qubits.\")\n    print(f\"5. Since the two patches are independent, the total number of logical qubits is the sum from both.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = (Qubits per Patch) * (Number of Patches)\")\n    print(f\"Total Logical Qubits = {logical_qubits_per_patch} * {num_patches} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
