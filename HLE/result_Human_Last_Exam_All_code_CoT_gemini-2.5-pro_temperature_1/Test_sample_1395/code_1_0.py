# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution.
# A political map is a planar graph. The Four-Color Theorem guarantees it can be colored with 4 or fewer colors.
# The complex set of borders in Asia before 1991 required 4 colors, the maximum for a planar graph.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"Chromatic number of the Asian graph before dissolution = {chromatic_number_before}")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number after the Soviet dissolution.
# After 1991, the USSR node was replaced by multiple new countries, adding new borders.
# This new map is still planar, so its chromatic number is at most 4.
# Adding complexity (nodes and edges) cannot decrease the chromatic number of a graph.
# Since the chromatic number was 4 before and cannot be more than 4 after, it must remain 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"Chromatic number of the Asian graph after dissolution = {chromatic_number_after}")

# Step 3: Calculate the incremental change, delta_soviet.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"delta_soviet = {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}")

# Step 4: Determine if the planarity of the graph changed.
# A map of contiguous countries is inherently a planar graph. Subdividing a region (the USSR)
# into smaller regions (new countries) does not alter the graph's planarity.
planarity_changed = False
print(f"Did the planarity of the Asian country graph change? {planarity_changed}")

# Step 5: Assign the value to beta.
# As per the rule: if planarity did not change, beta = 1.
beta = 1
print(f"Since planarity did not change, beta = {beta}")

# Step 6: Calculate the final answer.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"Final Answer = beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}")
