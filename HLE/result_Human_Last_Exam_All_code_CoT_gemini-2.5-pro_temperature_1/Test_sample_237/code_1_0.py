# This script simulates the calculation of 100! on the hypothetical Wuxing computer (XVM)
# to find the most memory-optimized solution and the result.

# Plan Step 1 & 2: Choose a base for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
# As outlined in the plan, a base of 100 is the most memory-efficient.
# A number is stored as a list of 2-digit chunks (0-99).
# For example, 12345 is stored as [45, 23, 1].
BASE = 100

# Plan Step 3: Implement the factorial calculation.
# Initialize the number to 1.
result_chunks = [1]

# Loop from 2 to 100 to calculate 100!
for i in range(2, 101):
    carry = 0
    # Multiply each chunk by the current number `i` and add the carry.
    for j in range(len(result_chunks)):
        # In the XVM, this calculation would require a larger data type for the product.
        # Max value of `result_chunks[j] * i + carry` is 99 * 100 + 99 = 9999.
        # This fits within an 'unsigned int' (6D).
        product = result_chunks[j] * i + carry
        result_chunks[j] = product % BASE
        carry = product // BASE
    
    # If there's a remaining carry, append it as new chunks.
    while carry > 0:
        result_chunks.append(carry % BASE)
        carry //= BASE

# Plan Step 4: Calculate 'z', the smallest memory size in Decimal Digits (D).
# This is based on the most optimal variable choices for the Base-100 algorithm on XVM.
# 100! has 158 digits, so we need ceil(158/2) = 79 chunks. We'll size the array at 80 for safety.

mem_size_var = 2          # XVM type: cent size (to track array size, up to 79) -> 2D

most_significant_chunk = result_chunks[-1]
second_most_significant_chunk = result_chunks[-2]

# The number begins with the digits from the most significant chunk,
# followed by the digits from the next chunk.
# E.g., if chunks are ..., 32, 93], the number is 9332...
# To get the first 3 digits: (93 * 10) + (32 // 10) = 930 + 3 = 933
