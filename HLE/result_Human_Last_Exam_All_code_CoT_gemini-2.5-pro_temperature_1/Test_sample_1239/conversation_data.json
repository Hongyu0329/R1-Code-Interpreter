    "The symmetry group of a system of differential equations is the group of transformations under which the set of solutions is invariant. For the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in three spatial dimensions, we can identify several fundamental physical symmetries. The total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the dimensions of these individual symmetry transformations.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Identify each type of symmetry transformation that leaves the equations invariant. These include translations in time and space, spatial rotations, Galilean boosts, scaling transformations, and a pressure shift.\n2.  Determine the number of independent parameters (the dimension) for each symmetry type.\n3.  Sum these dimensions to find the total dimension of the Lie group.\n4.  Write a Python script to print out each component of the sum and then compute the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in R^3.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The Lie group of symmetries is composed of several subgroups.
