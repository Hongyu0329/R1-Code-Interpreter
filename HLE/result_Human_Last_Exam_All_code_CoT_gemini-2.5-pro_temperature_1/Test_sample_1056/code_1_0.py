# Final computation of the pair (r, t).
# r: rank of Ab(G)
# t: order of the torsion subgroup of Ab(G)

# Based on the mathematical derivation, the abelianization of G, denoted Ab(G),
# is isomorphic to the direct sum of two copies of the integers, Z^2.
# Ab(G) ~= Z x Z

# The rank of an abelian group is the number of independent generators of its free part.
# For Z^2, the rank is 2.
r = 2

# The torsion subgroup of an abelian group consists of all elements of finite order.
# In Z^2, the only element with finite order is the identity element (0, 0).
# The order of the trivial torsion subgroup is 1.
t = 1
