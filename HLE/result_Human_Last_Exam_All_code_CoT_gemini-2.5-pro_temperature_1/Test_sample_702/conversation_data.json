    "To determine the connectivity of the map $f: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$, we will follow these steps:\n1.  First, we determine the connectivity of the source and target spaces. The connectivity of a space $X$ is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n2.  We identify the map $f$ up to homotopy. This requires some standard but deep results from algebraic topology, specifically related to the Hilton-Milnor theorem and Whitehead products.\n3.  We compute the connectivity of the homotopy fiber of the map $f$. The connectivity of a map is defined as the connectivity of its fiber plus one.\n\nLet's break down the calculation for the connectivity of the spaces involved:\n\n*   **Connectivity of Loop Spaces:** For a sphere $S^n$ with $n \\ge 2$, it is $(n-1)$-connected. Its loop space, $\\Omega S^n$, is $(n-2)$-connected.\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   The space $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n\n*   **Connectivity of a Smash Product:** If a space $A$ is $k_A$-connected and a space $B$ is $k_B$-connected, their smash product $A \\wedge B$ is $(k_A + k_B + 1)$-connected.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2 + 4 + 1) = 7$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of a Suspension:** The suspension of a space, $\\Sigma X$, increases its connectivity by one.\n    *   The source space is $\\Sigma (\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$. Its connectivity is $7 + 1 = 8$.\n\n*   **Connectivity of the Target Space:** The target space is $\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$. Since $S^4 \\wedge S^6$ is homotopy equivalent to $S^{10}$, the target space is $\\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   The connectivity of $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(10-2) = 8$.\n\nNow, we identify the map. A key result in homotopy theory is that the source space $\\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is homotopy equivalent to the sphere $S^9$. The map in question can be shown to be null-homotopic (i.e., mapping the entire source space to a single point in the target). This is because it corresponds to the Whitehead product $[i_4, i_6]$ which is trivialized by the projection map $S^4 \\vee S^6 \\to S^4 \\wedge S^6$.\n\nFinally, we compute the connectivity of this null-homotopic map $f: X \\to Y$, where $X \\simeq S^9$ and $Y \\simeq \\Omega S^{10}$.\n*   The homotopy fiber of a null-homotopic map is homotopy equivalent to the product $X \\times \\Omega Y$.\n*   In our case, the fiber is $S^9 \\times \\Omega(\\Omega S^{10}) \\simeq S^9 \\times \\Omega^2 S^{10}$.\n*   The connectivity of $S^9$ is $8$.\n*   The connectivity of $\\Omega^2 S^{10}$ is $(10-3) = 7$.\n*   The connectivity of a product of spaces is the minimum of their individual connectivities. So, the fiber's connectivity is $\\min(8, 7) = 7$.\n*   The connectivity of the map is the fiber's connectivity plus one.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\n# Define the dimensions of the spheres\nn1 = 4\nn2 = 6\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the connectivity of the loop spaces\n# The connectivity of Omega S^n is n-2 for n >= 2\nconn_Omega_S_n1 = n1 - 2\nconn_Omega_S_n2 = n2 - 2\nprint(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{n1}: {conn_Omega_S_n1}\")\nprint(f\"Connectivity of Omega S^{n2}: {conn_Omega_S_n2}\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the connectivity of the smash product of the loop spaces\n# The connectivity of A wedge B is conn(A) + conn(B) + 1\nconn_smash = conn_Omega_S_n1 + conn_Omega_S_n2 + 1\nprint(f\"Connectivity of (Omega S^{n1} wedge Omega S^{n2}): {conn_Omega_S_n1} + {conn_Omega_S_n2} + 1 = {conn_smash}\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the connectivity of the source space (suspension of the smash product)\n# The connectivity of Sigma X is conn(X) + 1\nconn_source = conn_smash + 1\nprint(f\"Connectivity of source space Sigma(Omega S^{n1} wedge Omega S^{n2}): {conn_smash} + 1 = {conn_source}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the connectivity of the target space\n# The target is Omega(S^n1 wedge S^n2) = Omega(S^(n1+n2))\nn_target = n1 + n2\nconn_target = n_target - 2\nprint(f\"Connectivity of target space Omega(S^{n1+n2}): {n_target} - 2 = {conn_target}\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber of the null-homotopic map\n# The map is null-homotopic. Its fiber is X x Omega(Y).\n# X is the source space, which is 8-connected.\n# Y is the target space, Omega(S^10).\n# We need the connectivity of Omega(Y) = Omega(Omega(S^10)) = Omega^2(S^10).\n# Connectivity of Omega^2(S^k) is k-3.\nconn_Omega_Y = n_target - 3\nprint(f\"Connectivity of Omega(Target) = Omega^2(S^{n_target}): {n_target} - 3 = {conn_Omega_Y}\")\n\n# The connectivity of the fiber is min(conn(Source), conn(Omega(Target)))\nconn_fiber = min(conn_source, conn_Omega_Y)\nprint(f\"Connectivity of the fiber: min({conn_source}, {conn_Omega_Y}) = {conn_fiber}\")\n\n# Step 6: The connectivity of the map is conn(fiber) + 1\nconn_map = conn_fiber + 1\nprint(f\"The connectivity of the map is conn(fiber) + 1 = {conn_fiber} + 1 = {conn_map}\")\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
