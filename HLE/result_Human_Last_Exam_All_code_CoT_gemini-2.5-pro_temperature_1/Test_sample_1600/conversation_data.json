    "The problem asks for the value of a(3), where a(n) represents the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 2n for electron or photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics. This quantity is given by the double factorial of `(2n - 1)`.\n\nHere is the plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Define the value of `n`, which is 3 in this case.\n2.  Use the formula `a(n) = (2n - 1)!!`. The double factorial `k!!` is the product of all integers from `k` down to 1 with the same parity as `k`.\n3.  For `n=3`, the order is `2n=6`, and the formula becomes `a(3) = (2*3 - 1)!! = 5!!`.\n4.  Calculate `5!!`, which is `5 * 3 * 1`.\n5.  Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the full equation along with the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_feynman_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(3), the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams of order 6\n    in quantum electrodynamics.\n    The formula is a(n) = (2n-1)!!.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    \n    # The number to calculate the double factorial of\n    k = 2 * n - 1\n    \n    result = 1\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Calculate the double factorial (k!!)\n    for i in range(k, 0, -2):\n        result *= i\n        factors.append(str(i))\n        \n    # Format the equation string for printing\n    equation_str = \" * \".join(factors)\n    \n    print(f\"The number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams, a(n), of order 2n is given by the formula a(n) = (2n-1)!!.\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the order is 2n = {2*n}, and we need to calculate a({n}).\")\n    print(f\"a({n}) = (2*{n} - 1)!! = {k}!!\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: {equation_str} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_feynman_diagrams()\n```\n<<<15>>>"
