    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  I will start by listing the books of the Old Testament in their canonical (Protestant) order, as this would have been the order familiar in Shakespeare's England.\n2.  I will then programmatically search for the first book from this list that is explicitly named in Shakespeare's works. This requires a pre-compiled set of known biblical references.\n3.  The two earliest candidates for named books are the Book of Job (whose main character, Job, is mentioned by name) and the Book of Psalms (which is referenced via a specific numbered psalm).\n4.  In canonical order, Job comes before Psalms. Therefore, the mention of \"Job\" is the earliest.\n5.  I will identify the specific play in which \"Job\" is mentioned. One such mention occurs in *Henry IV, Part 2*.\n6.  The Python script will store this information and iterate through the canonical list to find the first match, then print the result.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_bible_book_mention():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order,\n    that is mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A list of Old Testament books in canonical order. We only need to go\n    # as far as the first confirmed mention.\n    bible_books_in_order = [\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\",\n        \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Ruth\", \"1 Samuel\", \"2 Samuel\", \"1 Kings\",\n        \"2 Kings\", \"1 Chronicles\", \"2 Chronicles\", \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\",\n        \"Esther\", \"Job\", \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\"\n    ]\n\n    # A dictionary of confirmed, explicit mentions of Biblical books by name\n    # in Shakespeare's plays. The name \"Job\" is used, which is the title of the\n    # book. This is the earliest book in the canon to be named.\n    # The reference to \"Psalms\" is also valid but occurs later in the canon.\n    mentions = {\n        \"Job\": {\n            \"play\": \"Henry IV, Part 2\",\n            \"quote\": \"I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient.\",\n            \"location\": \"Act I, Scene 2\"\n        },\n        \"Psalms\": {\n            \"play\": \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\",\n            \"quote\": \"they do no more adhere and keep pace together than the Hundredth Psalm to the tune of ‘Green Sleeves.’\",\n            \"location\": \"Act II, Scene 1\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the canonical list and stop at the first book found in our mentions\n    for book in bible_books_in_order:\n        if book in mentions:\n            found_book = book\n            found_play = mentions[book][\"play\"]\n            \n            print(f\"The first book of the Bible, in canonical order, mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of {found_book}.\")\n            print(f\"It is mentioned in the play '{found_play}'.\")\n            return\n\nfind_first_bible_book_mention()\n```\n<<<Job, Henry IV, Part 2>>>"
