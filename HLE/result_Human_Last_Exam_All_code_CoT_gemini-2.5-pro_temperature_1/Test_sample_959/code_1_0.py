# The problem simplifies to computing the order of the outer automorphism group
# of the cyclic group of order 31, C_31.
# This is because the group G, as defined by its presentation, is the trivial group.

# The order of the outer automorphism group of an abelian group H is equal to
# the order of its automorphism group, |Aut(H)|.

# For a cyclic group of order n, C_n, the order of its automorphism group is
# given by Euler's totient function, phi(n).

p = 31

# For a prime number p, phi(p) = p - 1.
order_of_out_E = p - 1

# The collection of central extensions E has only one element, so the sum is just this value.
total_sum = order_of_out_E

# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final calculation is phi(31).
print(f"The final sum is calculated by the equation: {p} - 1 = {total_sum}")
