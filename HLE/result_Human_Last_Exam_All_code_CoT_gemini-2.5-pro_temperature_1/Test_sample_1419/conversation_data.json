    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling $u^*$ in $\\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions, we will use the renormalization group method.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** We start with the one-loop beta function, $\\beta(u)$, for the dimensionless coupling constant $u$ in $\\phi^4$ theory. This function is calculated in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions, where $\\epsilon$ is a small parameter.\n2.  **Define the Fixed Point Condition:** A fixed point, denoted as $u^*$, is a point where the coupling constant ceases to change with the energy scale. Mathematically, this corresponds to the point where the beta function is zero: $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n3.  **Solve for the Fixed Point:** We will solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ for the non-trivial fixed point (i.e., $u^* \\neq 0$). This gives us the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\n4.  **Construct Python Code:** The Python code will calculate the numerical coefficient in the expression for $u^*$ and print the final formula, clearly showing how $u^*$ depends on $\\epsilon$.\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling $u$ of the $\\frac{u}{4!}\\phi^4$ interaction in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions is:\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}u^2 + O(u^3)$\n\nSetting $\\beta(u^*) = 0$ to find the fixed point:\n$-\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}(u^*)^2 = 0$\n\nSolving for the non-trivial fixed point ($u^* \\neq 0$):\n$\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2}u^* = \\epsilon$\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon$\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling. Now, let's use Python to present this result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the leading order expression for the fixed point\n    coupling u* in phi^4 theory near d=4 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The beta function for the coupling u in d=4-epsilon dimensions is:\n    # beta(u) = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi^2)) * u^2\n    # The non-trivial fixed point u* is found by setting beta(u*) = 0.\n    # -epsilon * u* + (3 / (16 * pi^2)) * (u*)^2 = 0\n    # This gives u* = (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon.\n\n    # We will now calculate the numerical coefficient C = 16 * pi^2 / 3.\n    \n    numerator_coeff = 16\n    denominator_coeff = 3\n    \n    # Calculate the coefficient\n    coefficient = (numerator_coeff * math.pi**2) / denominator_coeff\n    \n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* is given by:\")\n    print(\"u* = C * epsilon\")\n    print(\"\\nwhere the coefficient C is derived from the one-loop beta function.\")\n    print(f\"The symbolic form of the coefficient is: C = ({numerator_coeff} * pi^2) / {denominator_coeff}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final expression with the calculated numerical coefficient is:\")\n    # The final print statement outputs each number in the final equation as requested.\n    print(f\"u* = ({numerator_coeff} * {math.pi}**2 / {denominator_coeff}) * epsilon = {coefficient} * epsilon\")\n\ncalculate_fixed_point_coupling()\n\n```\n<<<u* = (16 * pi**2 / 3) * epsilon>>>"
