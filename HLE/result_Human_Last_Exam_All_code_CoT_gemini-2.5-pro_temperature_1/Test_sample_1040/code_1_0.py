def solve_math_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the mathematical problem.
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The assumption Psi(k;l;m) = 0 is symmetric in k, l, m.
    2. Algebraic manipulation of the definitions and the assumption leads to the powerful conclusion that x.Phi(y) = 0 for any distinct x, y from the set {k, l, m}.
    3. Additionally, some of the proposed identities are always true due to the given algebraic structure (specifically, the idempotency of the monoid M), regardless of the assumption Psi=0. An identity that is always true must necessarily follow from any assumption.
    4. Each of the 12 options is tested against these derived consequences.

    The valid options are:
    - 2, 3, 4, 6: These follow from x.Phi(y) = 0.
    - 7, 8, 11, 12: These are always true due to idempotency.
    - 10: This simplifies to k.Phi(k) = 0, which is always true due to idempotency.

    The invalid options are:
    - 1, 5, 9: These all reduce to Phi(k) = 0, which is not necessarily true in a general abelian group G that may have torsion elements (e.g., Z_2).
