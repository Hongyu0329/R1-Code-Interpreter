    "To determine the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit inside a 15x15x15 cube, we cannot simply divide the volumes. We must consider how the blocks can be physically packed.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Strategy**: A highly effective method for this type of problem is to use a \"divide and conquer\" strategy. We will partition the large 15x15x15 cube into smaller cuboids. The most logical place to make the cuts is at the 9-unit mark along each axis, corresponding to the length of the block.\n2.  **Partitioning**: By cutting the 15x15x15 cube at x=9, y=9, and z=9, we divide it into 8 smaller regions:\n    *   One 9x9x9 cuboid.\n    *   Three 9x9x6 cuboids.\n    *   Three 9x6x6 cuboids.\n    *   One 6x6x6 cuboid.\n3.  **Calculation**: For each of these smaller regions, we will calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit. The key is that for any region smaller than 9 units on all three sides (like the 6x6x6 cuboid), no blocks will fit.\n4.  **Summation**: The total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks from each of the 8 regions.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan, calculating the number of blocks for each partition and summing them to find the total.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_l, block_w, block_h = 9, 1, 1\n\n    # This function calculates the max blocks for a given region by checking 3 orientations.\n    def calculate_max_blocks_in_region(l, w, h):\n        # Orientation 1: 9x1x1\n        fit1 = math.floor(l / 9) * math.floor(w / 1) * math.floor(h / 1)\n        # Orientation 2: 1x9x1\n        fit2 = math.floor(l / 1) * math.floor(w / 9) * math.floor(h / 1)\n        # Orientation 3: 1x1x9\n        fit3 = math.floor(l / 1) * math.floor(w / 1) * math.floor(h / 9)\n        return max(fit1, fit2, fit3)\n\n    print(\"The 15x15x15 cube is partitioned into 8 smaller regions to pack the 9x1x1 blocks efficiently.\")\n    print(\"We calculate the number of blocks that fit in each type of region:\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
