    # Property 3: Zero losses
    # The dissipative loss mechanism targets and removes states with doubly-occupied sites.
    # In the long-time limit, the system is driven into a steady state that must be "dark"
    # to the dissipation, meaning it has no components with double occupancy.
    # If there are no double occupancies, the loss rate is necessarily zero.
    print("Property 3: Correct. The final state has no double occupancies, so the loss rate from this state is zero.")

    # Property 5: Anti-ferromagnetic-like spin correlations
    # The dissipation forcing the system into the doublon-free subspace is equivalent to
    # the U -> infinity limit of the standard Fermi-Hubbard model. The effective Hamiltonian
    # in this limit is the t-J model, which includes a spin-spin interaction term J_ex * (S_i . S_j).
    # For the standard Hubbard model, J_ex is positive, which energetically favors anti-parallel
    # spin alignment. This results in anti-ferromagnetic correlations.
    print("Property 5: Correct. The effective Hamiltonian promotes anti-ferromagnetic spin alignment.")
    correct_properties.append(5)

    # Property 4: Spin entanglement
    # The steady state, characterized by anti-ferromagnetic correlations, is a highly-correlated
    # many-body state. The ground states of 1D anti-ferromagnets are known to be prime examples
    # of entangled quantum states.
    print("Property 4: Correct. The correlated anti-ferromagnetic state exhibits spin entanglement.")
    correct_properties.append(4)

    # Property 1: Zero tunneling
    # This property is subtle. The tunneling term J in the Hamiltonian is not zero, and particles
    # still have kinetic energy. However, in any steady state, there can be no net flow of particles.
    # Interpreting "Zero tunneling" as "zero net particle current" makes this statement correct for any
    # final steady state.
    print("Property 1: Correct. In a steady state, the net macroscopic particle current must be zero.")
