# A script to calculate the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8.

# Step 1: Define the properties of the group G of type E_8.
rank = 8
dimension = 248

print(f"The group G is of type E_8.")
print(f"The rank of G is {rank}.")
print(f"The dimension of G is {dimension}.")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 2: Calculate the total number of roots.
# The formula is: Number of roots = Dimension - Rank.
num_roots = dimension - rank
print(f"The total number of roots is calculated as:")
print(f"   Dimension - Rank = {dimension} - {rank} = {num_roots}")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 3: Calculate the number of positive roots (N).
# The formula is: N = (Number of roots) / 2.
num_positive_roots = num_roots // 2
print(f"The number of positive roots (N) is half the total number of roots:")
print(f"   N = {num_roots} / 2 = {num_positive_roots}")
print("-" * 40)

# Step 4: State the final answer based on the theorem.
# The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is q^N.
print("The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^N.")
print("The final equation for the number of tori is:")
print(f"q^{num_positive_roots}")
