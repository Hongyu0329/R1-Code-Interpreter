    "To find the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** A key result in the theory of algebraic groups states that for a connected reductive group $G$ defined over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the total number of maximal tori that are rational over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ is given by the formula $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$. A group of type $E_8$ is always split over any field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, so this theorem applies directly.\n\n2.  **Determine the properties of $E_8$:** To find $N$, we need the rank and the dimension of the group $G$ of type $E_8$.\n    *   The **rank** of $E_8$ is 8.\n    *   The **dimension** of $E_8$ is 248.\n\n3.  **Calculate the number of roots:** The dimension of a reductive group is the sum of its rank and the total number of its roots.\n    *   Total number of roots = Dimension - Rank = $248 - 8 = 240$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the number of positive roots ($N$):** The roots come in pairs ($\\alpha$, $-\\alpha$). The set of positive roots consists of one root from each pair, so the number of positive roots is half the total number of roots.\n    *   $N$ = (Total number of roots) / 2 = $240 / 2 = 120$.\n\n5.  **State the final answer:** Plugging $N=120$ into the formula from Step 1, we find that the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is $q^{120}$.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result, showing each step.\n\n```python\n# A script to calculate the number of Fq-rational maximal tori for a group of type E8.\n\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the group G of type E_8.\nrank = 8\ndimension = 248\n\nprint(f\"The group G is of type E_8.\")\nprint(f\"The rank of G is {rank}.\")\nprint(f\"The dimension of G is {dimension}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the total number of roots.\n# The formula is: Number of roots = Dimension - Rank.\nnum_roots = dimension - rank\nprint(f\"The total number of roots is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"   Dimension - Rank = {dimension} - {rank} = {num_roots}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the number of positive roots (N).\n# The formula is: N = (Number of roots) / 2.\nnum_positive_roots = num_roots // 2\nprint(f\"The number of positive roots (N) is half the total number of roots:\")\nprint(f\"   N = {num_roots} / 2 = {num_positive_roots}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\n\n# Step 4: State the final answer based on the theorem.\n# The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is q^N.\nprint(\"The number of Fq-rational maximal tori is given by the formula q^N.\")\nprint(\"The final equation for the number of tori is:\")\nprint(f\"q^{num_positive_roots}\")\n```\n<<<q^120>>>"
