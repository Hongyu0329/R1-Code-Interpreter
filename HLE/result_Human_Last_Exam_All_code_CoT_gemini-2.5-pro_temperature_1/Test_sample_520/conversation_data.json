    "This is a historical question that requires looking up information rather than computation. My plan is to find the factual answer to the question about Andre Vernault's profession and then present this answer using a simple Python script, as requested by the prompt format. The script will store the profession in a variable and then print it in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # During World War II, British counterintelligence (MI5) suspected\n    # Andre Vernault of being a German spy. The suspicion arose because\n    # he was evasive and lied about his profession during interrogation.\n    # The truth was that he was not a spy, but was simply embarrassed\n    # by his real job and thought it sounded undignified.\n    true_profession = \"lion tamer\"\n    \n    print(f\"Andre Vernault concealed his true profession from interrogators because he was embarrassed by it.\")\n    print(f\"His true profession was: {true_profession}\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<lion tamer>>>"
