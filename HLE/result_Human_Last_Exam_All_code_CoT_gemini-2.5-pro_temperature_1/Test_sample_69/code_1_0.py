    print("2. Let's analyze the clues from the sentences provided:")
    print("   - In sentences 0 and 1, the word for 'spring' is 'көктем'. Spring is a natural phenomenon. This links 'көк' to nature.")
    print("   - In sentences 4 and 5, the word for 'sky' is 'көк'. The sky is also a natural entity.")
    print("   - From these examples, we can hypothesize that 'көк' is used for things found in nature (like grass, leaves, the sky).")
    print("   - Now let's look for clues about 'жасыл'. Sentence 3 gives us 'Жасанды интеллект' for 'Artificial intelligence'.")
    print("   - The word 'жасанды' means 'artificial' or 'man-made'. It is very similar to 'жасыл'.")
    print("   - This provides a strong hint: if 'көк' is for natural green, then 'жасыл' is likely used for artificial, man-made green objects (like a green car, a green shirt, green paint).")
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The distinction is between natural and artificial. 'Көк' is used for natural greens and blues, while 'жасыл' is used for the green of man-made objects.")
    print("The question asks when to use 'жасыл'. The correct choice is the one that states it's used for man-made things.")
