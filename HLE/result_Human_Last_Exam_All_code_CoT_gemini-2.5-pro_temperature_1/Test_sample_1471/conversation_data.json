    "To solve this equation, I will first translate the ancient Egyptian numerals into modern Arabic numerals. Then, I will perform the calculation as specified by the translated equation.\n\n1.  **Decode the Numerals:**\n    *   The symbol `🏮` represents 1,000. `🏮🏮🏮🏮` is 4 * 1,000 = 4,000.\n    *   The symbol `🍥` represents 100. `🍥🍥🍥` is 3 * 100 = 300.\n    *   The symbol `∩` represents 10.\n    *   The symbol `|` represents 1.\n    *   The number `🍥🍥🍥∩∩∩|||` is (3 * 100) + (3 * 10) + (3 * 1) = 300 + 30 + 3 = 333.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Equation:**\n    The equation in modern numbers is: `4000 / 300 - 333 = ?`\n\n3.  **Calculate the Solution:**\n    I will now use Python to calculate the result and print the full equation.\n\n```python\n# The equation is 🏮🏮🏮🏮 / 🍥🍥🍥 - 🍥🍥🍥∩∩∩||| = ?\n\n# Step 1: Convert the Egyptian numerals to modern numbers.\n# 🏮 = 1000, so 🏮🏮🏮🏮 = 4000\nnum1 = 4000\n# 🍥 = 100, so 🍥🍥🍥 = 300\nnum2 = 300\n# 🍥 = 100, ∩ = 10, | = 1, so 🍥🍥🍥∩∩∩||| = 300 + 30 + 3 = 333\nnum3 = 333\n\n# Step 2: Perform the calculation.\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Step 3: Print the equation in modern numbers along with the result.\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-319.6666666666667>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
