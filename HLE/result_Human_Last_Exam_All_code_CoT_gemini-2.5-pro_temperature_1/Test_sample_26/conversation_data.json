    "To find the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, we will analyze the topology of $X$ and its relationship with the ambient space $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Identify the properties of X**: Determine the dimension and basic topological invariants of $X$, such as its Betti numbers.\n2.  **Apply Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem**: Use this theorem to relate the homotopy groups of $X$ to those of $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n3.  **Use the Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy Groups**: Set up the long exact sequence for the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ to connect $\\pi_3(X)$ to other known homotopy groups.\n4.  **Analyze the sequence**: Use properties of the maps in the sequence to deduce the structure of $\\pi_3(X)$.\n\n### Execution of the Plan:\n\n1.  **Properties of X**:\n    *   $X$ is a hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$, so its complex dimension is $\\text{dim}_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 3 - 1 = 2$. As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n    *   $X$ is defined by a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d=5$.\n    *   By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\to \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces an isomorphism $i_*: \\pi_1(X) \\to \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, $X$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(X) = 0$).\n    *   Since $X$ is a 4-dimensional, simply connected manifold, we know $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and, by PoincarÃ© duality, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n    *   The Betti numbers of $X$ are $b_0=1, b_1=0, b_3=0, b_4=1$. We can calculate the Euler characteristic $\\chi(X)$ using the formula for a degree $d$ hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^n$ (here $n=3, d=5$):\n        $\\chi(X) = d(d^2 - 4d + 6) = 5(5^2 - 4(5) + 6) = 5(25 - 20 + 6) = 5(11) = 55$.\n    *   Since $\\chi(X) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - b_3 + b_4$, we have $55 = 1 - 0 + b_2 - 0 + 1 = 2 + b_2$, which gives $b_2(X) = 53$.\n    *   Since $X$ is simply connected, the Hurewicz Theorem gives an isomorphism $\\pi_2(X) \\cong H_2(X, \\mathbb{Z})$. As $H_2(X)$ is known to be torsion-free, $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n\n2.  **Long Exact Sequence of Homotopy Groups**:\n    We consider the long exact sequence of the pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$:\n    ... $\\to \\pi_3(X) \\stackrel{i_*}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\stackrel{j_*}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_2(X) \\stackrel{i_*}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to ...$\n\n3.  **Analyzing the sequence**:\n    *   We know $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. We found $\\pi_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   The pair $(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is 2-connected. The Relative Hurewicz Theorem implies that $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$.\n    *   From the long exact sequence of homology for the pair:\n        $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\to H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_2(X) \\to H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$\n    *   Since $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$, we have an injection $0 \\to H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_2(X)$. This means $H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is isomorphic to the kernel of the map $i_*: H_2(X) \\to H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$.\n    *   The Lefschetz theorem states this map is surjective. Since $H_2(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$ and $H_2(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, the kernel is a free abelian group of rank $53 - 1 = 52$.\n    *   So, $\\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{52}$.\n    *   Now we analyze the segment: $\\mathbb{Z} \\stackrel{j_*}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{Z}^{52} \\stackrel{\\partial}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathbb{Z}^{53}$.\n    *   The map $\\partial$ is the connecting homomorphism in the homotopy sequence. It corresponds to the connecting homomorphism $\\partial_H: H_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to H_2(X)$ under the Hurewicz isomorphisms. From the homology sequence, $\\partial_H$ is the inclusion of the kernel, so it is injective. Therefore, $\\partial$ is also injective.\n    *   By exactness of the sequence, $\\text{Im}(j_*) = \\text{Ker}(\\partial)$. Since $\\partial$ is injective, its kernel is $\\{0\\}$. Thus, the map $j_*$ must be the zero map.\n    *   The sequence then simplifies. The part $\\pi_3(X) \\stackrel{i_*}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3) \\stackrel{j_*=0}{\\longrightarrow} \\pi_3(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ implies that $i_*$ is surjective.\n    *   This yields a short exact sequence of abelian groups:\n        $0 \\to \\text{Ker}(i_*) \\to \\pi_3(X) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\n    *   This sequence splits (since $\\mathbb{Z}$ is free), so $\\pi_3(X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\text{Ker}(i_*)$.\n    *   The rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is therefore $1 + \\text{rank}(\\text{Ker}(i_*))$.\n    *   From the full long exact sequence, $\\text{Ker}(i_*) = \\text{Im}(\\partial: \\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\to \\pi_3(X))$.\n    *   We can analyze $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ via its Hurewicz map to $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$. The long exact sequence in homology gives $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\text{Coker}(i_*: H_4(X) \\to H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3))$. This map is multiplication by the degree $d=5$, so $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$.\n    *   Since $H_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is a torsion group, it is plausible that $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ has rank 0. This is a non-trivial result, but it is known to be true for the analogous case of K3 surfaces (quartics, $d=4$), for which $\\pi_3(K3)=\\mathbb{Z}$. Assuming this holds for $d=5$ as well, the rank of $\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)$ is 0.\n    *   If $\\text{rank}(\\pi_4(\\mathbb{CP}^3, X)) = 0$, then its image, $\\text{Ker}(i_*)$, also has rank 0.\n    *   Therefore, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is $1 + 0 = 1$.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the rank of the third homotopy group pi_3(X)\n# for a smooth quintic hypersurface X in CP^3.\n\n# Let X be a smooth hypersurface of degree d in CP^n.\n# Here, n = 3 and d = 5.\n\n# 1.
