# Number of individuals
num_individuals = 9

# --- Part 1: Simultaneous Guessing (Finding N) ---
# In the simultaneous scenario, the best strategy is to split the group
# into two teams with different assumptions about the overall parity of hats.
# To maximize the minimum number of correct guesses (the guarantee),
# the team sizes should be as close as possible.
team_a_size = num_individuals // 2
team_b_size = num_individuals - team_a_size

# The number of guaranteed correct guesses, N, is the size of the smaller team.
# If the actual parity matches Team A's assumption, Team A is correct.
# If it matches Team B's assumption, Team B is correct.
# The worst case is that the smaller team is correct.
N = min(team_a_size, team_b_size)

# --- Part 2: Sequential Guessing (Finding M) ---
# In the sequential scenario, the first person to guess sacrifices their
# own chance to be correct to provide information to the others.
# They announce the parity of the hats of the other (num_individuals - 1) people.
# This allows every one of those other individuals to deduce their own hat color.
M = num_individuals - 1

# --- Part 3: Calculate the difference ---
difference = M - N

# --- Output the results ---
