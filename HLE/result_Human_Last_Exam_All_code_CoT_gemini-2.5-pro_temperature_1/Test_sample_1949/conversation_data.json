    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that identifies the longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid, sorts them, and prints the top three.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will create a list of the major real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid. I will exclude mythological rivers from this list.\n2.  Next, I will pair each river with its approximate modern length in kilometers.\n3.  Then, I will use Python to sort this list of rivers from the longest to the shortest based on their length.\n4.  Finally, the script will print the top three rivers from the sorted list, displaying their names and lengths to answer the question.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of tuples containing major rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their lengths in km.\n    # Format: (River Name, Length in km)\n    rivers_in_aeneid = [\n        (\"Nile\", 6650),\n        (\"Danube\", 2850),\n        (\"Euphrates\", 2800),\n        (\"Tigris\", 1850),\n        (\"Rhine\", 1233),\n        (\"Po\", 652),\n        (\"Tiber\", 406)\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the list of rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The 'key' argument uses a lambda function to specify sorting by the second element of each tuple (the length).\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_in_aeneid, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers from the sorted list.\n    top_three = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three, 1):\n        # The final equation is the rank, river name, and its length.\n        print(f\"{i}. {river}: {length} km\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```\n<<<\nThe three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\n1.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
