# --- Given Information ---
# Basic Reproduction Number (R0)
R0 = 3.0
# The percentage of vaccinated people who still get the infection.
# This is also known as the breakthrough infection rate.
breakthrough_rate_percent = 6.0

# --- Step-by-step Calculation ---

# 1. Convert the breakthrough percentage to a decimal.
# This represents the vaccine's failure rate.
vaccine_failure_rate = breakthrough_rate_percent / 100.0

# 2. Calculate Vaccine Effectiveness (VE).
# VE is the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are protected from infection.
VE = 1 - vaccine_failure_rate

# 3. Calculate the required proportion of the population that must be immune
# to achieve herd immunity (where Re <= 1). This is often called the
# Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT).
# HIT = 1 - (1 / R0)
herd_immunity_threshold = 1 - (1 / R0)

# 4. Calculate the critical vaccination coverage (p_c).
# Since the vaccine is not 100% effective, we need to vaccinate a larger
# portion of the population to achieve the herd immunity threshold.
# p_c = HIT / VE
critical_coverage = herd_immunity_threshold / VE

# 5. Convert the final result to a percentage for the final answer.
critical_coverage_percentage = critical_coverage * 100

# --- Print the Output ---
