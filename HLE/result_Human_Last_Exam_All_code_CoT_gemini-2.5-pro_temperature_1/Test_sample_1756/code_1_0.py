# Step 1 & 2: Analyze each statement to determine its validity.
# A: True. The combination of top-k and nucleus sampling is achieved by taking the intersection of the token sets produced by each method, which is equivalent to applying the more restrictive filter.
# B: False. Beam search with a beam width of 1 is the definition of greedy decoding. This holds true even if there are ties in token probabilities; the tie-breaking mechanism would be consistent.
# C: True. A temperature > 1 makes the probability distribution flatter (increases entropy). This can cause the cumulative probability to build more slowly, requiring more tokens to reach the nucleus threshold 'p', potentially including tokens that were outside the original set.
# E: True. When sampling from a truncated distribution (like from top-k or nucleus), the probabilities of the selected tokens are renormalized to sum to 1. This is done by dividing each token's probability by the sum of all selected probabilities, which preserves their relative ratios.
# G: True. In standard implementations (like Hugging Face transformers), applying top-k and nucleus sampling is equivalent to taking the intersection of the sets of tokens allowed by each method. Set intersection is a commutative operation, so the order does not matter.
# M: True. While non-trivial, perfect determinism in MoE models is achievable. It requires not only setting seeds (`torch.manual_seed`, `torch.cuda.manual_seed_all`) but also forcing deterministic algorithms (e.g., `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`), which handles non-determinism in routing and other operations. The statement's use of "can be" makes it correct.
# O: True. Different GPU architectures (like A100 vs. V100) may have minor differences in their floating-point arithmetic units. These small variations can accumulate in an iterative process like beam search, leading to different path choices and final outputs, even with identical seeds.
# P: True. If expert pruning during inference is non-deterministic (e.g., dropping experts based on dynamic system load), the model's forward pass will differ between runs. This leads to different output logits and thus a different set of tokens selected by nucleus sampling.
# R: True. Even with fixed seeds, variable sequence lengths change the shape and size of tensors, which can alter how computations are scheduled on the GPU. This can trigger non-deterministic CUDA kernels (e.g., for `atomicAdd`), leading to slightly different numerical results and thus different outputs.
# X: True. Attention score calculation involves large matrix multiplications, which are summations of many floating-point numbers. Due to the non-associativity of floating-point math, the order of summation (which can vary with hardware scheduling) can lead to small numerical differences that alter beam search paths.
# Y: True. Activation checkpointing involves recomputing parts of the forward pass. This recomputation is subject to the same sources of numerical non-determinism (from hardware, CUDA kernels, etc.) as the original pass. These small differences can lead to a different final sampling distribution.

# Step 3: Collect the letters of the correct statements.
correct_statement_letters = ["A", "C", "E", "G", "M", "O", "P", "R", "X", "Y"]

# Step 4: Sort the letters lexicographically.
correct_statement_letters.sort()

# Step 5: Format the final answer and print it.
final_answer = "".join(correct_statement_letters)
print(final_answer)
