    print("The property is: For any distinct points x, y in X, there is a closed connected set K with x in Int(K) and y not in K.")

    print("   - We can choose K to be the closed interval [x - d/2, x + d/2].")
    print("   - In R, closed intervals are closed and connected. So K is a closed connected set.")
    print("   - The interior of K is Int(K) = (x - d/2, x + d/2), which clearly contains x.")
    print("   - The point y is at distance d from x, so y is not in K.")
    print("   - Therefore, the real line R satisfies all the given conditions.")
