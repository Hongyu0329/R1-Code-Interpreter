    "To find the total welfare, we first need to determine the market equilibrium point where the supply and demand curves intersect. Then, we calculate the consumer surplus and producer surplus at this equilibrium. The sum of these two surpluses gives us the total welfare.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Functions:** Represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` functions in Python.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe):**\n    *   Set the supply and demand equations equal to each other: `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`.\n    *   Since this equation cannot be solved algebraically, we will use a numerical solver (`scipy.optimize.fsolve`) to find the equilibrium quantity, `Qe`.\n    *   Substitute `Qe` back into either function to find the equilibrium price, `Pe`.\n3.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):**\n    *   Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price.\n    *   The formula is: `CS = ∫[0 to Qe] (Demand(Q)) dQ - (Pe * Qe)`.\n    *   We will use numerical integration (`scipy.integrate.quad`) to compute the integral.\n4.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):**\n    *   Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price.\n    *   The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`. This is the minimum quantity at which production starts.\n    *   The formula is: `PS = (Pe * Qe) - ∫[2^(1/3) to Qe] (Supply(Q)) dQ`.\n5.  **Calculate Total Welfare (TW):**\n    *   Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n    *   `TW = CS + PS`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Step 1: Define the supply and demand functions\ndef supply(Q_S):\n    \"\"\"Supply function P = ln(Q_S^3 - 2)\"\"\"\n    # The function is defined only for Q_S^3 - 2 > 0\n    with np.errstate(invalid='ignore'): # Suppress warnings for values outside domain\n        if np.any(Q_S**3 - 2 <= 0):\n            return np.inf # Return infinity if outside the domain for the solver\n        return np.log(Q_S**3 - 2)\n\ndef demand(Q_D):\n    \"\"\"Demand function P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q_D))\"\"\"\n    return 18 * np.exp(-np.arctan(Q_D))\n\n# Step 2: Find the market equilibrium\ndef equilibrium_equation(Q):\n    \"\"\"Equation to solve for equilibrium: Demand(Q) - Supply(Q) = 0\"\"\"\n    return demand(Q) - supply(Q)\n\n# Initial guess for the solver. Must be in the domain of the supply function, i.e., Q > 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.\ninitial_guess = 2.0\n# Use fsolve to find the equilibrium quantity (Q_e)\nQ_e, = fsolve(equilibrium_equation, initial_guess)\n# Calculate the equilibrium price (P_e) using the demand function\nP_e = demand(Q_e)\n\nprint(f\"--- Market Equilibrium ---\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Quantity (Qe): {Q_e:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Equilibrium Price (Pe): {P_e:.4f}\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS)\n# CS = ∫[0 to Qe] Demand(Q) dQ - (Pe * Qe)\nintegral_demand, _ = quad(demand, 0, Q_e)\nconsumer_surplus = integral_demand - (P_e * Q_e)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate Producer Surplus (PS)\n# The supply curve starts where Q^3 - 2 > 0, so Q > 2^(1/3)\nq_min_supply = (2)**(1/3)\n# PS = (Pe * Qe) - ∫[q_min_supply to Qe] Supply(Q) dQ\nintegral_supply, _ = quad(supply, q_min_supply, Q_e)\nproducer_surplus = (P_e * Q_e) - integral_supply\n\n# Step 5: Calculate Total Welfare (TW)\ntotal_welfare = consumer_surplus + producer_surplus\n\nprint(f\"--- Welfare Calculation ---\")\nprint(f\"Consumer Surplus = ∫D(Q)dQ - Pe*Qe = {integral_demand:.4f} - {P_e * Q_e:.4f} = {consumer_surplus:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Producer Surplus = Pe*Qe - ∫S(Q)dQ = {P_e * Q_e:.4f} - {integral_supply:.4f} = {producer_surplus:.4f}\\n\")\nprint(f\"--- Final Result ---\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = Consumer Surplus + Producer Surplus\")\nprint(f\"Total Welfare = {consumer_surplus:.4f} + {producer_surplus:.4f} = {total_welfare:.4f}\")\n\n<<<22.5029>>>\n```"
