    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I need to identify what a \"point group of order 2\" means in the context of wallpaper groups. The order of a group is the number of its elements. A point group of order 2 has two symmetry operations: the identity and one other operation. In 2D crystallography, there are two such point groups:\n    *   **Group 2 (or C2):** Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n    *   **Group m (or Cs):** Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n2.  Next, I will list the 17 wallpaper groups and identify the point group associated with each one.\n3.  I will then filter this list to find all wallpaper groups whose associated point group is either '2' or 'm'.\n4.  Finally, I will count these groups and present the result, showing how the total is derived from the counts for each point group type.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the wallpaper groups that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its point group name and order.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        \"p1\":   (\"1\", 1),\n        \"p2\":   (\"2\", 2),\n        \"pm\":   (\"m\", 2),\n        \"pg\":   (\"m\", 2),\n        \"cm\":   (\"m\", 2),\n        \"p2mm\": (\"2mm\", 4),\n        \"p2mg\": (\"2mm\", 4),\n        \"p2gg\": (\"2mm\", 4),\n        \"c2mm\": (\"2mm\", 4),\n        \"p4\":   (\"4\", 4),\n        \"p4mm\": (\"4mm\", 8),\n        \"p4gm\": (\"4mm\", 8),\n        \"p3\":   (\"3\", 3),\n        \"p3m1\": (\"3m\", 6),\n        \"p31m\": (\"3m\", 6),\n        \"p6\":   (\"6\", 6),\n        \"p6mm\": (\"6mm\", 12),\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Find groups with point group '2' (order 2)\n    groups_with_pg_2 = [name for name, data in wallpaper_group_data.items() if data == (\"2\", target_order)]\n    \n    # Find groups with point group 'm' (order 2)\n    groups_with_pg_m = [name for name, data in wallpaper_group_data.items() if data == (\"m\", target_order)]\n\n    count_pg_2 = len(groups_with_pg_2)\n    count_pg_m = len(groups_with_pg_m)\n    total_count = count_pg_2 + count_pg_m\n    \n    print(f\"There is {count_pg_2} wallpaper group with point group '2' (order 2): {', '.join(groups_with_pg_2)}\")\n    print(f\"There are {count_pg_m} wallpaper groups with point group 'm' (order 2): {', '.join(groups_with_pg_m)}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we sum the counts:\")\n    print(f\"{count_pg_2} + {count_pg_m} = {total_count}\")\n    \ncount_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
