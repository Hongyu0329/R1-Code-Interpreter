    Explains the choice of spectral expansion for poloidal dependence in toroidal systems.
    """
    explanation = """
In toroidal systems, like tokamaks, the geometry is described by toroidal coordinates. One of these coordinates is the poloidal angle (often denoted by Î¸), which measures the angle the 'short way' around the torus.

The key characteristic of the poloidal angle is that it is periodic; a full rotation brings you back to the starting point. The function describing any physical quantity (like magnetic field or plasma pressure) must also be periodic in this angle.

The Fourier series is the mathematical tool specifically designed to represent periodic functions. It expands a function into a sum of simple, oscillating sine and cosine functions, which are themselves periodic. Because of this perfect match between the nature of the coordinate and the basis functions, the Fourier series is the standard and most widely adapted spectral technique for handling poloidal (and toroidal) dependence in analytical and numerical models of toroidal plasmas.

Other options listed are generally used for different purposes:
- Polynomials (Legendre, Chebyshev, etc.) are suited for non-periodic, bounded intervals, like the radial coordinate.
- Spherical Harmonics are suited for spherical geometry, not toroidal geometry.

Therefore, the correct technique is the Fourier series.
