    "To solve this problem, we first need to understand the structure of the integral equation. It is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a separable (or degenerate) kernel. This allows us to convert the integral equation into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Kernel**: The kernel `K(x, y)` can be written as a finite sum:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) y^k`.\n\n2.  **Convert to Linear System**: Substitute this into the integral equation:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) x^(n-1-k) ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`.\n    Let `c_k = ∫₀¹ y^k u(y) dy`. These are unknown constants. The solution `u(x)` must have the form of a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`:\n    `u(x) = 1 + λ ∑_(k=0)^(n-1) c_k x^(n-1-k)`.\n    By substituting this form of `u(x)` back into the definitions of `c_j`, we obtain a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknowns `c_0, ..., c_(n-1)`. This system can be written in matrix form as `(I - λA)c = b`, where `I` is the identity matrix, `c` is the vector of constants `c_k`, and `A` and `b` are a matrix and a vector determined by the definite integrals.\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: According to the Fredholm alternative theorem, this system of equations fails to have a unique solution if `det(I - λA) = 0`. This occurs when `λ` is a characteristic value, specifically `λ = 1/μ`, where `μ` is an eigenvalue of the matrix `A`.\n    When `det(I - λA) = 0`, the equation has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. A solution exists only if a specific orthogonality condition is met. For this problem, it can be shown that this condition is never met. Therefore, the equation has no solution for any `λ` that is a reciprocal of an eigenvalue of matrix `A`.\n\n4.  **Find the Matrix `A`**: The elements of the matrix `A` are given by `A_jk = 1 / (j + n - k)`, where `j` and `k` are the row and column indices, from `0` to `n-1`.\n\n5.  **Find the Equation for `λ`**: The condition `det(I - λA) = 0` leads to a polynomial equation for `λ`. The eigenvalues `μ` of `A` are the roots of the characteristic polynomial `det(A - μI) = 0`. Substituting `μ = 1/λ` gives the polynomial equation for `λ`.\n\n6.  **Implementation**: We can use Python with the `sympy` library to construct the matrix `A` for a given `n`, compute its characteristic polynomial, and then derive the corresponding polynomial equation for `λ`. Since `n` is not specified, I will demonstrate the solution for `n=3`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the polynomial equation whose roots are the values of `λ` for which the integral equation has no solution.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_lambda_equation(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the polynomial equation for lambda for a given n.\n    The roots of this equation are the values of lambda for which the integral\n    equation has no solution.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The exponent in the integral equation kernel.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Define the matrix A\n    A = sympy.zeros(n, n)\n    for j in range(n):\n        for k in range(n):\n            A[j, k] = sympy.Rational(1, j + n - k)\n\n    # Define the symbol for the eigenvalues of A\n    mu = sympy.Symbol('mu')\n    \n    # Calculate the characteristic polynomial for mu: det(A - mu*I)\n    I = sympy.eye(n)\n    char_poly_mu = (A - mu * I).det()\n    \n    # The polynomial is often computed as det(mu*I - A).\n    # The roots are the same.
