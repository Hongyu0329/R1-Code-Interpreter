    "My approach to solving this puzzle is to first identify the underlying structure of the sequence. A simple inspection doesn't reveal an obvious arithmetic or geometric progression. However, the total number of elements in the sequence is 33, which is a multiple of 3. This suggests that the sequence might be composed of triplets.\n\nLet's group the sequence into 11 triplets, which we can label `(a_i, b_i, c_i)` for `i` from 1 to 11.\nThe main challenge is to find a rule that predicts the next number. The next number would be the first element of the 12th triplet, `a_12`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Group the Sequence:** I will structure the given sequence into 11 distinct triplets.\n2.  **Identify the Pattern:** I will investigate the relationship between these triplets. Specifically, I'll check if there's a connection between a triplet and the one that follows it. A promising hypothesis is that the first element of a triplet (`a_i`) is determined by the last element of the preceding triplet (`c_{i-1}`).\n3.  **Verify the Pattern:** I will write code to check if this pattern, `a_i = c_{i-1}`, holds true for the triplets in the sequence.\n4.  **Predict the Next Number:** Assuming the pattern holds, especially for the later terms in the sequence, I will use it to predict the next number, `a_12`, based on the value of `c_11`.\n5.  **Present the Final Equation:** The final step is to output the result as an equation as requested by the prompt, showing how the next number is derived.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given sequence to find the pattern and predict the next number.\n    \"\"\"\n    seq = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # The sequence has 33 elements, which suggests it is composed of 11 triplets.\n    # Let's group the sequence into triplets (a_i, b_i, c_i).\n    triplets = []\n    for i in range(0, len(seq), 3):\n        triplets.append(tuple(seq[i:i+3]))\n\n    # The pattern seems to be that the first element of the next triplet (a_i)\n    # is often equal to the last element of the previous triplet (c_{i-1}).\n    # Let's verify this pattern.\n    print(\"Analyzing the pattern a_i = c_{i-1}:\")\n    for i in range(1, len(triplets)):\n        a_i = triplets[i][0]\n        c_i_minus_1 = triplets[i-1][2]\n        is_match = \"holds\" if a_i == c_i_minus_1 else \"does not hold\"\n        print(f\"For i={i+1}: a_{i+1} = {a_i}, c_{i} = {c_i_minus_1}.
