# Step 1: Decipher the clues to find the three cities.
# Clue 1: "The Miracle" by Irving Wallace is set in Lourdes, France, where the apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes (the "lady in white") occurred.
city1 = "Lourdes"

# Clue 2: The poem by Yuri Krasnokutsky contains the line "A cold stream flows in the blood of the Neva." The Neva River ('X') flows through Saint Petersburg, Russia.
city2 = "Saint Petersburg"

# Clue 3: The Dolac market in Zagreb is nicknamed "The Belly of Zagreb" (Trbuh Zagreba). This is an allusion to "The Belly of Paris" (Le Ventre de Paris), a novel by Ã‰mile Zola about the Les Halles market. Thus, the analogue was in Paris.
city3 = "Paris"

# Step 2: Format the trilogy as requested and print the result.
print(f"{{{city1}, {city2}, {city3}}}")
