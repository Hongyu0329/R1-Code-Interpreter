    // This program calculates the gravitational time dilation factor f.
    // The formula is f = sqrt(1 - 2GM/(rc^2)).
    // For a small term x = 2GM/(rc^2), this is approximated by f ≈ 1 - x/2.
    // This approximation avoids calculating square roots, which are not supported.

    // To be memory-efficient, variables are reused.
    // Memory Usage (z): 6 'frac' variables * 3 D/frac = 18 D.

    // Step 1: Define physical constants as frac types.
    // G ≈ 6.7e-11, M_pulsar ≈ 4e30, c ≈ 3e8, r = (20km+60km) = 8e4 m.
    frac G = {67, 10, -12};
    frac M = {4, 1, 30};
    frac c = {3, 1, 8};
    frac r = {8, 1, 4};

    // Step 2: Calculate x = 2GM/(rc^2) carefully to avoid overflow.
    // The chosen order is x = ( (2/c) * (M/r) ) * (G/c).
    // The variable 'f_result' will be used to build up the result.
    frac f_result = {2, 1, 0}; // Start with the number 2.
    frac temp;                 // A temporary variable for intermediate products.

    f_result = f_result / c;   // f_result is now (2/c).

    temp = G / c;              // temp is now (G/c).
    f_result = f_result * temp;// f_result now holds the complete value of x.

    // Step 3: Calculate the final dilation factor, f ≈ 1 - x/2.
    // The compiler automatically converts integers like 1 and 2 to frac types.

    // As requested, output each number in the final equation.
    // The final equation is f = 1 - x/2.
