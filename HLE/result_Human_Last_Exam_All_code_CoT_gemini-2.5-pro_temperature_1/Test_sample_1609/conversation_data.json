    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The user is asking for the value of `a(4)`, where `a(n)` represents the maximal number of prime implicants for a Boolean function with `n` variables.\n2.  **Research the Sequence:** This is a well-known problem in computer science and digital logic design. The sequence `a(n)` is not defined by a simple formula that can be easily computed. The values for small `n` have been determined through extensive research and are considered standard results. This sequence is cataloged in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A000373.\n3.  **Formulate a Coded Solution:** Since there's no simple equation to compute `a(4)` from scratch, the most practical coding solution is to use these known values. I will write a Python script that stores the first few terms of the sequence in a dictionary and retrieves the value for `n=4`.\n4.  **Present the Result:** The code will then print the result in a clear format, stating the answer for `a(4)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_a_n():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a\n    Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n    The sequence a(n) does not have a simple closed-form formula. Its values\n    for small n are known from research in switching theory and are listed in\n    the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as A000373.\n\n    This code retrieves the known value for n=4.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Known values for a(n) for small n:\n    # a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 6, a(3) = 20, a(4) = 78, a(5) = 352\n    a_n_values = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 2,\n        2: 6,\n        3: 20,\n        4: 78,\n        5: 352\n    }\n\n    n = 4\n    \n    # Check if the value for n is in our dictionary\n    if n in a_n_values:\n        result = a_n_values[n]\n        # Since there is no simple calculation, we present the result as a statement.\n        # The numbers in the final statement are 4 and 78.\n        print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The value for a({n}) is not available in the pre-computed list.\")\n\nsolve_a_n()\n```\n<<<78>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
