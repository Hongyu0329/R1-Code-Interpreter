    Analyzes the provided statements about attack graph analysis and identifies the incorrect one.

    A. Correct. This accurately describes the structure (nodes, edges) and common analysis techniques (pathfinding, cut-sets) for attack graphs.
    B. Correct. This accurately describes the state explosion problem, a fundamental challenge in attack graph analysis where the graph size can be exponential in relation to the system size.
    C. Incorrect. This statement is a common misconception. While some optimization problems on attack graphs can be NP-hard, the generation of the graph itself for many formalisms (especially logical attack graphs) is often polynomial in the size of the input (the network model). The primary difficulty is the potential exponential *size* of the output graph (the state explosion problem from statement B), not that the generation problem is inherently NP-hard.
    D. Correct. Real-world systems are dynamic, so attack graphs must be updated. Incremental computation is a necessary technique to avoid costly full regenerations.
    E. Correct. Using model checking on an attack graph to formally verify security properties (e.g., reachability of a critical asset) is a well-established and powerful application.

    The only clearly incorrect statement is C.
