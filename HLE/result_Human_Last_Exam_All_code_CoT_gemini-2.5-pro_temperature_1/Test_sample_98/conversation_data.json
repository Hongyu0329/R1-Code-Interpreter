    "My plan to solve this problem involves analyzing the geometry and symmetry of the icosahedron.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Setup:** An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. The problem states it is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one triangular face is horizontal and acts as the base.\n2.  **Locate the Water Surface:** The tank is \"half-filled,\" meaning the volume of water is half the total volume of the icosahedron. Due to the high degree of symmetry, a horizontal plane that cuts the icosahedron at its exact mid-height will also divide its volume into two equal halves. This plane represents the surface of the water.\n3.  **Determine the Shape of the Cross-Section:** The shape of the water surface is the shape of the cross-section created by this mid-plane.\n    *   An icosahedron oriented on a face has a corresponding parallel face at the top. The cutting plane is parallel to both.\n    *   Because of the polyhedron's structure, this mid-plane intersects six of the side faces.\n    *   The intersection with these six faces forms a six-sided polygon (a hexagon).\n    *   The setup has a 3-fold rotational symmetry (if you rotate it by 120 degrees around a vertical axis, it looks the same) and inversion symmetry. For the resulting polygon to respect these symmetries, all its sides must be of equal length and all its internal angles must be equal.\n4.  **Conclusion:** A polygon with six equal sides and six equal angles is a regular hexagon.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that formalizes this explanation and prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_icosahedron_surface_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines the shape of the water surface\n    in a half-filled icosahedron tank standing on one of its faces.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the reasoning steps\n    reasoning = [\n        \"1.
