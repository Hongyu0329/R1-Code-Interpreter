    1.  The Role of the Insula: The insula is a key brain region for processing cravings, emotions, and bodily sensations. It is centrally implicated in both substance use disorders and major psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety.

    2.  Brain Connectivity in a Single Disorder: Both substance abuse and psychiatric disorders, when studied alone, are frequently associated with disrupted brain connectivity. This means the synchronized, functional communication between different brain areas is impaired.

    3.  Comorbidity Effects: When a patient has both a major psychiatric disorder and a substance abuse disorder (comorbidity), these neurological disruptions are often more severe.

    4.  Inter-hemispheric Connectivity Findings: Neuroimaging studies consistently show that chronic substance use is linked to reduced functional connectivity between the two hemispheres of the insula. This indicates impaired communication and integration of information between the left and right insula. An increase in connectivity or myelin density is contrary to the evidence of neural disruption and damage associated with these conditions.
