    This function explains the step-by-step solution to find the clique number of graph X
    and prints the final answer.

    # Step 1: Understand the graph G (the 1-skeleton of P)
    # The poset D is (R, <=). The 1-skeleton of its nerve, G, is a directed graph where:
    # - The vertices are the real numbers R.
    # - A directed edge exists from x to y if and only if x < y.

    # Step 2: Understand the graph X (the line graph of G)
    # X is the directed line graph of G.
    # - The vertices of X are the edges of G. So, a vertex of X is a pair (x, y) with x < y.
    # - A directed edge exists in X from (u, v) to (v, w), corresponding to a path u -> v -> w in G.

    # Step 3: Define the clique number of X
    # A "clique" in a directed graph is usually understood as a clique in its underlying undirected graph.
    # Two vertices v1 = (x1, y1) and v2 = (x2, y2) are adjacent if there is an edge in X
    # in either direction. This means they are adjacent if (y1 = x2) or (y2 = x1).

    # Step 4: Compute the clique number
    # We need to find the size of the largest set of vertices in X where every pair is adjacent.

    # Check for a clique of size 2.
    # Let's pick three real numbers z1, z2, z3 such that z1 < z2 < z3.
    # For example, let z1=1, z2=2, z3=3.
    v1 = (1, 2)
    v2 = (2, 3)
    # v1 and v2 are vertices in X. Are they adjacent?
    # v1 is (x1, y1) = (1, 2). v2 is (x2, y2) = (2, 3).
    # The condition is y1=x2 or y2=x1.
    # Since y1=2 and x2=2, they are adjacent.
    # So, {v1, v2} is a clique of size 2. The clique number is at least 2.

    # Check for a clique of size 3.
    # Assume a clique C = {v1, v2, v3} exists.
    # Let v1 = (x1, y1), v2 = (x2, y2), v3 = (x3, y3).
    #
    # Pairwise adjacency for v1, v2: Assume y1 = x2.
    # This implies an ordering x1 < y1 = x2 < y2.
    #
    # Now, v3 must be adjacent to both v1=(x1, y1) and v2=(y1, y2).
    # Adj(v1, v3) => (y1 = x3) or (y3 = x1)
    # Adj(v2, v3) => (y2 = x3) or (y3 = y1)
    #
    # Let's analyze the two possibilities for Adj(v1, v3):
    #
    # Case A: y1 = x3. So v3 = (y1, y3) with y1 < y3.
    # To be adjacent to v2=(y1, y2), we need (y2 = x3) or (y3 = y1).
    # y2 = x3 becomes y2 = y1, which contradicts y1 < y2.
    # y3 = y1 contradicts the requirement for v3 that x3 < y3 (i.e., y1 < y3).
    # Case A leads to a contradiction.
    #
    # Case B: y3 = x1. So v3 = (x3, x1) with x3 < x1.
    # To be adjacent to v2=(y1, y2), we need (y2 = x3) or (y3 = y1).
    # y3 = y1 becomes x1 = y1, which contradicts the requirement for v1 that x1 < y1.
    # So we must have y2 = x3. This means v3 = (y2, x1).
    # The requirement for v3 is x3 < y3, which means y2 < x1.
    # But our initial setup gave x1 < y1 < y2, which implies x1 < y2.
    # This is a contradiction (y2 < x1 and x1 < y2).
    # Case B also leads to a contradiction.
    #
    # Since all cases lead to a contradiction, a clique of size 3 cannot exist.

    # Final Conclusion
