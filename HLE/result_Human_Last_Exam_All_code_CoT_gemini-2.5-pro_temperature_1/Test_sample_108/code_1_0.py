# Define the lengths of the robot arm segments in cm
l1 = 40  # Shoulder to Elbow
l2 = 28  # Elbow to Wrist
l3 = 15  # Wrist to Hand
l4 = 10  # Hand (Finger)

# Define the minimum clearance required between non-adjacent segments in cm
clearance = 1.0

# 1. Calculate the ideal minimum distance without collision constraints.
# This configuration is L1 - L2 - L3 + L4.
ideal_dist = l1 - l2 - l3 + l4
# This ideal configuration is collinear and violates the collision constraint.

# 2. Model the deviation needed to satisfy the collision constraint.
# We assume a planar configuration. To lift L3 and L4 away from L1,
# we need to introduce a bend at the elbow joint (E).
# The simplest way to ensure a 1cm clearance is to make the wrist joint (W)
# 1 cm away (in the y-direction) from the line of the first segment (L1).
# y_W = l2 * sin(alpha_E), where alpha_E is the bend angle at the elbow.
# We set y_W = clearance.
sin_alpha_E = clearance / l2
# Ensure the argument for asin is valid
if not -1 <= sin_alpha_E <= 1:
    raise ValueError("Invalid clearance or length values")
cos_alpha_E = math.sqrt(1 - sin_alpha_E**2)

# 3. Calculate the new coordinates of the fingertip (F).
# In the ideal configuration, the segments L2 and L3 fold back, and L4 goes forward.
# We assume the wrist and hand joints don't introduce further bending in this plane
# to keep the y-clearance minimal and constant.
# x_E = l1
# x_W = l1 - l2 * cos(alpha_E)
# x_H = x_W - l3 (since there's no additional bend at the wrist)
# x_F = x_H + l4 (since the hand segment folds forward)
x_f = l1 - l2 * cos_alpha_E - l3 + l4

# The y-coordinate of the rest of the arm will be the same as the wrist's y-coordinate.
y_f = l2 * sin_alpha_E

# 4. Calculate the final distance from the shoulder (origin) to the fingertip.
final_dist = math.sqrt(x_f**2 + y_f**2)

# Print the final equation with all the numbers
print("The final distance is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: sqrt(x_f^2 + y_f^2)")
print(f"y_f = clearance = {clearance:.2f} cm")
print(f"x_f = L1 - L2*cos(alpha) - L3 + L4 = {l1} - {l2}*cos(alpha) - {l3} + {l4} = {x_f:.4f} cm")
print(f"Final Distance = sqrt({x_f:.4f}^2 + {y_f:.2f}^2) = {final_dist:.4f} cm")

# Find the closest answer choice
choices = {'A': 11.28, 'B': 21.82, 'C': 41.11, 'D': 39.85, 'E': 6.75, 'F': 55.61, 'G': 2.93, 'H': 15.68}
closest_choice = min(choices, key=lambda k: abs(choices[k] - final_dist))
print(f"\nThe calculated distance {final_dist:.2f} cm is slightly greater than the ideal distance of {ideal_dist} cm.")
print(f"This result does not exactly match any of the answer choices. The ideal distance is 7 cm, and any realistic deviation must be greater than 7 cm.")
print(f"Answer choice E ({choices['E']:.2f} cm) is less than the theoretical minimum of 7 cm, which suggests a possible flaw in the problem statement or choices.")
print(f"However, if forced to choose the 'closest' value to the physically impossible ideal, 7 cm, E would be that choice.")
print(f"Based on our physical model, the result is ~7.09 cm.")

# Despite the discrepancy, the problem asks for the solution. The ideal distance is 7cm.
# The actual distance must be slightly larger. None of the answers fit this logic perfectly.
# The answer 6.75cm is suspiciously close to the ideal 7cm. It is possible there's an alternative interpretation or a flaw in the problem's values.
# Given the ambiguity, we'll select the answer that is closest in value to the ideal, non-colliding distance.
# My detailed calculation gives ~7.09cm. The answer 6.75cm is the closest among the choices that are in the correct small-distance range.
# Let's assume there is some unstated geometry that reduces the distance slightly below 7cm, or that 6.75 is an approximation for 7.
