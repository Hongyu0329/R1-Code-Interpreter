rho = 1000  # Density of water in kg/m^3
g = 10      # Acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
H = 10      # Depth of the river in meters

# The condition for the pressure at the bottom to be zero is when the
# initial hydrostatic pressure equals the dynamic pressure component.
# P_static = P_dynamic_component
# rho * g * H = 0.5 * rho * v**2

# Solving for v:
# v**2 = 2 * g * H
# v = sqrt(2 * g * H)

# Calculate the speed v
v_squared = 2 * g * H
v = math.sqrt(v_squared)

# The final equation is P_flowing = (rho * g * H) - (0.5 * rho * v**2) = 0
# Let's verify this with our calculated value of v.
