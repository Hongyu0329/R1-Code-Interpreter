    "To determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can use its topological definition. The Hopf charge, or Hopf invariant, is an integer that quantifies the linking of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere S².\n\nOur vector field `n=(nx,ny,nz)` is a map from 3D space (R³) to the surface of a unit sphere (S²), since `nx² + ny² + nz² = 1`. We can find the Hopf charge by calculating the linking number of the preimages of two chosen points on S².\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Choose two points on S²:** Let's pick the South Pole, `S = (0, 0, -1)`, and a point on the equator, `Q = (1, 0, 0)`.\n2.  **Find the preimage of the South Pole (S):**\n    The condition `n = (0, 0, -1)` implies `nz = cos(G) = -1`. This occurs when `G = π`.\n    From the definition `G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`, `G = π` means `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`, which gives `r2 = 0`.\n    The condition `r2 = sqrt((x²+y²-0.5)² + z²) = 0` is satisfied if and only if `z=0` and `x²+y²=0.5`.\n    This preimage is a circle in the `xy`-plane with radius `sqrt(0.5)`. Let's call this curve `C_S`.\n\n3.  **Find the preimage of the equatorial point (Q):**\n    The condition `n = (1, 0, 0)` implies:\n    *   `nz = cos(G) = 0`  => `G = π/2`.\n    *   `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = 0` => `sin(f) = 0`, so `f=0` or `f=π`.\n    *   `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = 1` => `cos(f) = 1`, which means `f=0`.\n    The condition `f = atan2(y,x) = 0` means `y=0` and `x>0`.\n    The condition `G = π/2` means `π * exp(-10 * r2) = π/2`, which gives `exp(-10 * r2) = 0.5`, so `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    Substituting `y=0` and `r2 = ln(2)/10` into the definition of `r2` gives `(x²-0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`.\n    This preimage is a closed loop in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane. Let's call this curve `C_Q`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Linking Number:**\n    The Hopf charge is the linking number of these two curves, `H = Lk(C_S, C_Q)`. We can see that `C_S` is a circle around the z-axis in the `z=0` plane, and `C_Q` is a loop in the `y=0` plane that encircles the x-axis. These two curves are linked. The linking number can be calculated numerically using the Gauss Linking Integral.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It generates points for both preimage curves and then numerically calculates their linking number. The theoretical result is exactly 1.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef generate_preimage_curve_S(num_points=200):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates points for the preimage of the South Pole, n=(0,0,-1).\n    This curve is the circle x^2 + y^2 = 0.5 in the z=0 plane.\n    \"\"\"\n    t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, num_points, endpoint=False)\n    radius = np.sqrt(0.5)\n    x = radius * np.cos(t)\n    y = radius * np.sin(t)\n    z = np.zeros(num_points)\n    return np.vstack((x, y, z)).T\n\ndef generate_preimage_curve_Q(num_points=200):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates points for the preimage of the point n=(1,0,0).\n    This curve is (x^2-0.5)^2 + z^2 = (ln(2)/10)^2 in the y=0 plane.\n    \"\"\"\n    R = np.log(2) / 10.0\n    t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, num_points, endpoint=False)\n    \n    # Parametrization: x^2-0.5 = R*cos(t), z = R*sin(t)\n    x = np.sqrt(0.5 + R * np.cos(t))\n    y = np.zeros(num_points)\n    z = R * np.sin(t)\n    return np.vstack((x, y, z)).T\n\ndef calculate_linking_number(curve1, curve2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the linking number between two closed curves using a\n    numerical approximation of the Gauss Linking Integral.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    num_points1 = len(curve1)\n    num_points2 = len(curve2)\n    \n    for i in range(num_points1):\n        p1_start = curve1[i]\n        p1_end = curve1[(i + 1) % num_points1]\n        dp1 = p1_end - p1_start\n        r1 = (p1_start + p1_end) / 2.0\n        \n        for j in range(num_points2):\n            p2_start = curve2[j]\n            p2_end = curve2[(j + 1) % num_points2]\n            dp2 = p2_end - p2_start\n            r2 = (p2_start + p2_end) / 2.0\n            \n            r12 = r1 - r2\n            r12_norm = np.linalg.norm(r12)\n            \n            if r12_norm < 1e-9:  # Avoid singularity if curves intersect\n                continue\n                \n            # Triple product: (dp1 x dp2) . r12\n            triple_product = np.dot(np.cross(dp1, dp2), r12)\n            total_sum += triple_product / (r12_norm**3)\n            \n    return total_sum / (4 * np.pi)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Generate the points for the two preimage curves\n    C_S = generate_preimage_curve_S()\n    C_Q = generate_preimage_curve_Q()\n    \n    # Calculate the linking number, which is the Hopf charge\n    hopf_charge = calculate_linking_number(C_S, C_Q)\n    \n    print(\"The Hopf charge is defined as the linking number of the preimages of two points.\")\n    print(\"We calculate this by discretizing the two preimage curves and using the Gauss linking integral.\")\n    print(f\"\\nCalculated Hopf Charge: {hopf_charge:.6f}\")\n    print(\"The theoretical value is exactly 1.\")\n\n```\n<<<1>>>"
