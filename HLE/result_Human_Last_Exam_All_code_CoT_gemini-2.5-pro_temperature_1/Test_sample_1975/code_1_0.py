# Based on the set-theoretic analysis, the set X contains all infinite cardinals
# up to and including kappa. These are aleph_0, aleph_1, ..., up to aleph_7.
# The indices of these cardinals range from 0 to 7.

# To find the number of elements in this set, we count the number of indices.
# number_of_elements = (last_index - first_index) + 1

# The order type of a well-ordered set is its cardinality (for finite sets, this is just the number of elements).
order_type = number_of_elements

# The final equation is the calculation of the order type.
