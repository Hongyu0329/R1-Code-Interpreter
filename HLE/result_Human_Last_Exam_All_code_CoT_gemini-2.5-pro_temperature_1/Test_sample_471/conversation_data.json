    "To find the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus ($T^2$), we can use a powerful tool from differential topology called Morse theory.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Introduce Morse Theory:** This theory relates the number of critical points of a function on a surface (or more generally, a manifold) to the surface's topological properties.\n2.  **Define Betti Numbers:** The key topological properties we need are the Betti numbers ($b_k$) of the 2-torus.\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of \"circular holes\" or \"handles\".\n    *   $b_2$: The number of enclosed \"voids\" or \"cavities\".\n3.  **Apply Morse Inequalities:** A fundamental result from Morse theory is that for any smooth function on a compact manifold, the number of critical points is at least the sum of its Betti numbers. Let $C$ be the total number of critical points. Then $C \\ge b_0 + b_1 + b_2$.\n4.  **Calculate for the Torus:** I will state the Betti numbers for the 2-torus and sum them up to find the theoretical minimum number of critical points.\n5.  **Confirm the Minimum:** This lower bound is the true minimum because we can construct a function on the torus that has exactly this many critical points (for example, the function $f(x, y) = \\cos(x) + \\cos(y)$ on the square $[0, 2\\pi] \\times [0, 2\\pi]$ with periodic boundary conditions).\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation described in step 4.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus\n    using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\n    # b0 is the number of connected components. A torus is one connected piece.\n    b0 = 1\n    # b1 is the number of 1-dimensional \"holes\". A torus has two independent loops\n    # (one around its \"tube\" and one through its \"hole\").\n    b1 = 2\n    # b2 is the number of 2-dimensional \"voids\". A torus encloses a single void.\n    b2 = 1\n\n    print(\"The Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2) are:\")\n    print(f\"b_0 (connected components) = {b0}\")\n    print(f\"b_1 (handles/tunnels) = {b1}\")\n    print(f\"b_2 (voids) = {b2}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the Morse inequalities.\n    # The number of critical points of index k, c_k, must satisfy c_k >= b_k.\n    # This means there must be at least:\n    # - c_0 >= b_0 = 1 minimum (index 0)\n    # - c_1 >= b_1 = 2 saddle points (index 1)\n    # - c_2 >= b_2 = 1 maximum (index 2)\n    # The minimal number of critical points for a Morse function is the sum of the Betti numbers.\n    # This result holds for any smooth function in general.\n    \n    # These are the minimal number of critical points of each type (index).\n    min_c0 = b0\n    min_c1 = b1\n    min_c2 = b2\n    \n    # Step 3: Calculate the total minimal number of critical points.\n    min_total_critical_points = min_c0 + min_c1 + min_c2\n\n    print(\"According to Morse theory, a smooth function on the torus must have at least:\")\n    print(f\"- {min_c0} minimum (index 0)\")\n    print(f\"- {min_c1} saddle points (index 1)\")\n    print(f\"- {min_c2} maximum (index 2)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The minimal total number of critical points is the sum of these values:\")\n    # The final output prints the equation for the sum\n    print(f\"{min_c0} + {min_c1} + {min_c2} = {min_total_critical_points}\")\n\nsolve_minimal_critical_points()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
