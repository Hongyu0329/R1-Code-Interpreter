    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step derivation followed by the Python code to present the final result.\n\n### Theoretical Derivation\n\n1.  **Framework:** We are working within the imaginary-time (or Matsubara) formalism of finite-temperature quantum field theory. The central object is the partition function `Z`, represented as a functional integral over all possible configurations of a neutral scalar field `φ(τ, **x**)`. Here, `τ` is the imaginary time, compactified on a circle of circumference `β = 1/T` (where T is the temperature), and **x** represents the spatial coordinates.\n\n2.  **Euclidean Action (S_E):** The functional integral is weighted by `exp(-S_E)`, where `S_E` is the Euclidean action. For a free, massive, neutral scalar field, the action is:\n    `S_E[φ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ (1/2)(∂_τ φ)² + (1/2)(∇φ)² + (1/2)m²φ² ]`\n    This action is a quadratic functional of the field `φ`.\n\n3.  **Inner Product Form:** The action is analogous to a high-dimensional Gaussian integral, where the argument of the exponent is of the form `-(1/2) xᵀ A x`. We can rewrite the action in a similar \"inner product\" notation. Let's define the inner product between two functions `f` and `g` as:\n    `(f, g) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x f(τ, x) g(τ, x)`\n\n4.  **Identifying the Operator D:** We want to find an operator `D` such that the action can be written as `S_E = (1/2) (φ, Dφ)`. By performing an integration by parts on the derivative terms in `S_E` (and using the periodicity of `φ` in `τ` and assuming `φ` vanishes at spatial infinity), we can identify the operator `D`.\n    *   `∫ (∂_τ φ)² dτ = - ∫ φ (∂_τ² φ) dτ`\n    *   `∫ (∇φ)² d³x = - ∫ φ (∇² φ) d³x`\n    This shows that:\n    `S_E = (1/2) ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x φ (-∂_τ² - ∇² + m²) φ`\n    Therefore, the operator `D` is the Klein-Gordon operator in Euclidean space:\n    `D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²`\n\n5.  **Final Expression:** The user asks for the inner product `(φ, D_φ)`. Based on our definition `S_E = (1/2) (φ, Dφ)`, this quantity is simply twice the Euclidean action:\n    `(φ, D_φ) = 2 * S_E = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [ (∂_τ φ)² + (∇φ)² + m²φ² ]`\n    This expression represents the integral of the squared kinetic and mass terms of the field over Euclidean spacetime.\n\nThe following Python code will print this final expression.\n\n```python\ndef print_inner_product_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the mathematical expression for the inner product (phi, D_phi)\n    in the functional integral representation of the partition function for a neutral\n    scalar field at finite temperature.\n\n    Symbols:\n    - phi: The neutral scalar field phi(tau, x).\n    - D: The Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator.\n    - (f, g): The inner product, defined as an integral over Euclidean spacetime.\n    - tau: Imaginary time, integrated from 0 to beta (inverse temperature).\n    - d^d x: Integral over d spatial dimensions.\n    - partial_tau: The partial derivative with respect to tau.\n    - nabla: The spatial gradient operator.\n    - m: The mass of the scalar field.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the equation as strings\n    inner_product_lhs = \"(phi, D_phi)\"\n    integral_part = \"∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x\"\n    \n    # The integrand contains the kinetic and mass terms\n    kinetic_term_time = \"(∂_τ φ)²\"\n    kinetic_term_space = \"(∇φ)²\"\n    mass_term = \"m²φ²\"\n    \n    integrand = f\"[{kinetic_term_time} + {kinetic_term_space} + {mass_term}]\"\n\n    # Construct the final equation string\n    final_equation = f\"{inner_product_lhs} = {integral_part} {integrand}\"\n\n    # Print the equation\n    print(\"In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (φ, D_φ) is given by:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n    \n    # Print the definition of the operator D\n    print(\"\\nWhere the operator D is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\")\n    print(\"D = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print_inner_product_expression()\n```\n<<<In finite-temperature field theory for a neutral scalar field, the inner product (φ, D_φ) is given by:\n(phi, D_phi) = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ d^d x [(∂_τ φ)² + (∇φ)² + m²φ²]\n\nWhere the operator D is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\nD = -∂_τ² - ∇² + m²\n>>>"
