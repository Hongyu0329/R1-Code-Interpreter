# The problem asks for the value 'a' for which the only obstruction to the
# symplectic embedding of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a 4-dimensional ball
# becomes the volume constraint.
#
# This is a known result from symplectic geometry. The symplectic capacity c(a)
# of the ellipsoid E(1,a) is given by a function known as the McDuff staircase.
# The volume constraint implies that c(a) must be at least sqrt(a).
# However, for certain values of 'a', additional "capacity obstructions" exist,
# forcing c(a) > sqrt(a).
#
# These obstructions are tied to the number-theoretic properties of 'a'. The
# threshold at which these obstructions cease to be active, and for all larger
# 'a' we have c(a) = sqrt(a), is known to be a = tau^4, where tau is the
# golden ratio.
#
# This script calculates this value.
# The golden ratio, tau = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
# We need to compute a = tau^4 = ((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)^4.
# This simplifies to the exact expression a = (7 + 3*sqrt(5)) / 2.

# Define the integer constants in the final expression
val_7 = 7
val_3 = 3

val_2 = 2

# Calculate the components of the expression
sqrt_of_5 = math.sqrt(val_5)
numerator = val_7 + val_3 * sqrt_of_5
final_a = numerator / val_2
