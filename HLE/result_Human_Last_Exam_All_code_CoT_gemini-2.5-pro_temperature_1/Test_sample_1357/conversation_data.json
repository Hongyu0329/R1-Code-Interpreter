    "This is a problem in the field of arithmetic geometry. The solution involves enumerating the possible combinatorial types of a special fiber of a model of the curve.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Translate the Condition**: The crucial piece of information is that the Jacobian of the curve has **good reduction**. According to a theorem by Raynaud, this implies that the stable reduction of the curve must be an **irreducible curve** (i.e., a curve with a single component).\n2.  **Use the Genus Formula**: The stable reduction is a curve of arithmetic genus `p_a = 4`. For an irreducible curve, the arithmetic genus `p_a` is related to the geometric genus `p_g` (the genus of its normalization) and the number of nodes `δ` by the formula: `p_a = p_g + δ`.\n3.  **Formulate the Task**: We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions (`p_g`, `δ`) to the equation `4 = p_g + δ`. Each solution represents a distinct type of stable reduction.\n4.  **Enumerate Solutions**: The script will iterate through all possible values for the geometric genus `p_g` (from 0 to 4), calculate the corresponding number of nodes `δ`, and print each solution. The total count of these solutions is the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reductions of a genus 4 curve\n    whose Jacobian has good reduction.\n\n    This condition implies the stable reduction is an irreducible curve.\n    The arithmetic genus (p_a) of an irreducible curve is related to the\n    geometric genus of its normalization (p_g) and the number of nodes (δ)\n    by the formula: p_a = p_g + δ.\n\n    For a genus 4 curve, p_a = 4.
