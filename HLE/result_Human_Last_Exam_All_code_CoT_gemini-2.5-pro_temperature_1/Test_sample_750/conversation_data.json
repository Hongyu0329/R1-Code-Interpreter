    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we can analyze it by expressing the complex number $z$ as $z = x + yi$. The equation involves a complex base exponentiation, which is multi-valued. The term $i^z$ is defined as $e^{z \\ln(i)}$. The complex logarithm $\\ln(i)$ is also multi-valued: $\\ln(i) = \\ln|i| + i(\\arg(i) + 2k\\pi) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$ for any integer $k$.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **Look for real solutions:** We set $z=x$ (so $y=0$) and solve the equation. This will yield two simple, well-known solutions.\n2.  **Look for purely imaginary solutions:** We set $z=yi$ (so $x=0$) and solve the resulting equation for $y$. This leads to an infinite family of solutions which can be expressed using the Lambert W function.\n3.  **Provide a Python script:** The script will first print the two real solutions and verify them. Then, it will compute and verify the first three purely imaginary solutions (corresponding to $k=-1, -2, -3$). For each solution, we will calculate both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the original equation to show they are equal.\n\nHere is the Python code to find and verify the solutions:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_and_verify():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the equation z*i = i^z for real and purely imaginary solutions\n    and verifies them.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define i as a complex number\n    i = 1j\n\n    print(\"Solving for z in z*i = i^z\\n\")\n\n    # --- Real Solutions (z = x) ---\n    print(\"--- Real Solutions ---\")\n    \n    # Solution z = 1\n    z1 = 1\n    lhs1 = z1 * i\n    rhs1 = i**z1\n    print(f\"Solution: z = {z1}\")\n    # Final equation format as requested\n    print(f\"Verification: The equation is {z1} * i = i^{z1}\")\n    print(f\"LHS = {z1} * {i} = {lhs1}\")\n    print(f\"RHS = {i}^{z1} = {rhs1}\")\n    print(f\"Result is {'True' if np.isclose(lhs1, rhs1) else 'False'}\\n\")\n\n    # Solution z = -1\n    z2 = -1\n    lhs2 = z2 * i\n    rhs2 = i**z2\n    print(f\"Solution: z = {z2}\")\n    # Final equation format as requested\n    print(f\"Verification: The equation is {z2} * i = i^{z2}\")\n    print(f\"LHS = {z2} * {i} = {lhs2}\")\n    print(f\"RHS = {i}^{z2} = {rhs2}\")\n    print(f\"Result is {'True' if np.isclose(lhs1, rhs1) else 'False'}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Purely Imaginary Solutions (z = yi) ---\n    # The equation for y is -y = exp(-y * alpha_k) where alpha_k = pi/2 + 2k*pi\n    # This only has solutions for k <= -1.\n    # The solution for y is given by y = -W(-alpha_k) / (-alpha_k) where W is the Lambert W function.\n    # So z = yi = -i * W(-alpha_k) / (-alpha_k)\n    \n    print(\"--- Purely Imaginary Solutions ---\")\n    print(\"This family of solutions is z_k = yi, where y solves -y = exp(-y*(pi/2 + 2k*pi)) for k <= -1.\")\n    print(\"Calculating the first 3 solutions (for k = -1, -2, -3):\\n\")\n\n    for k in range(-1, -4, -1):\n        alpha_k = np.pi/2 + 2*k*np.pi\n        \n        # We solve t = exp(t*alpha_k) for t = -y.\n        # Let alpha_k = -beta. t = exp(-t*beta). t*beta*exp(t*beta) = beta.\n        # t*beta = W(beta), so t = W(beta)/beta.\n        # beta = -alpha_k\n        beta = -alpha_k\n        \n        # The argument to lambertw is positive, so the result is real.\n        t = np.real(lambertw(beta)) / beta\n        y = -t\n        z = y * i\n        \n        print(f\"Solution for k = {k}:\")\n        print(f\"z = {z:.8f}\")\n\n        # Verification\n        lhs = z * i\n        \n        # For the RHS, we must use the correct branch of the logarithm\n        # i^z = exp(z * log(i)) = exp(z * i * alpha_k)\n        rhs = np.exp(z * i * alpha_k)\n\n        # Final equation format as requested\n        print(f\"Verification: The equation is ({z:.4f}) * i = i^({z:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"LHS = z * i = {lhs:.8f}\")\n        print(f\"RHS = exp(z * i * (pi/2 + 2*({k})*pi)) = {rhs:.8f}\")\n        print(f\"Result is {'True' if np.isclose(lhs, rhs) else 'False'}\\n\")\n\nsolve_and_verify()\n```\n<<<\nThe solutions to the equation $z\\cdot i=i^z$ include two real solutions, an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, and other complex solutions.\n\nThe real solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n\nThe purely imaginary solutions $z_k = y_k i$ exist for each integer $k \\le -1$.
