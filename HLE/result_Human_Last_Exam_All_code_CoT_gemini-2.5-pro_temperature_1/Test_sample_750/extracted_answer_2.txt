The solutions to the equation $z\cdot i=i^z$ include two real solutions, an infinite series of purely imaginary solutions, and other complex solutions.

The real solutions are $z=1$ and $z=-1$.

The purely imaginary solutions $z_k = y_k i$ exist for each integer $k \le -1$. The value $y_k$ is the solution to the real-valued equation $-y = e^{-y(\frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi)}$. These can be expressed using the Lambert W function as $z_k = -i \frac{W(-\alpha_k)}{-\alpha_k}$ where $\alpha_k = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi$.

For example, for $k=-1$, the solution is approximately $z \approx -0.2748i$.
For $k=-2$, the solution is approximately $z \approx -0.1365i$.

The provided Python code calculates and verifies these solutions.
