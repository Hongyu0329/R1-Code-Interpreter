# Based on the analytical derivation, f(n), the sum of the absolute cubes of the eigenvalues, simplifies to n.
# We need to find the smallest integer n such that f(n) > 10.
# This inequality is n > 10.
# The smallest integer n satisfying this condition is 11.
n = 11

# The matrix W_n is the Weyr canonical form of S_n. As derived, S_n is similar to a single
# n x n Jordan block for the eigenvalue 1. The Weyr form W_n is thus also an n x n bidiagonal
# matrix with 1s on the main diagonal and 1s on either the first super-diagonal or sub-diagonal.
# We will calculate the infinity norm for the standard Jordan block J_n(1).
# W_n = J_n(1) = eye(n) + diag(ones(n-1), 1)

# Let's construct W_11 to be J_11(1)
W_11 = np.eye(n) + np.diag(np.ones(n - 1), 1)

# The infinity norm is the maximum absolute row sum.
# For W_11:
# The first 10 rows have a sum of |1| + |1| = 2.
# The last row has a sum of |1| = 1.
# The maximum absolute row sum is 2.
Wn_inf_norm = np.linalg.norm(W_11, np.inf)

# Final calculation: n * ||W_n||_inf
result = n * Wn_inf_norm

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# We print the components of the calculation.
