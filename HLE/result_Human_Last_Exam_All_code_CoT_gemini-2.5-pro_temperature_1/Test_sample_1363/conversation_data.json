    "This is a knowledge-based question about the technical principles of ballroom dancing. I will use a Python script to lay out the technical characteristics of each dance style and determine which one has the most rigid structure for its turns, making it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without breaking its core technique.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the dance options and their core technical characteristics related to turning, especially the presence or absence of 'sway'.\n2.  Analyze these characteristics to identify the dance where overturning is technically infeasible. In ballroom dancing, 'sway' is a key mechanism that allows for greater rotation and flexibility in turns. The absence of sway dramatically restricts this.\n3.  The script will iterate through the dances, find the one with the prohibitive technique (i.e., no sway), and print the reasoning along with the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_dance_technique_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical characteristics of ballroom dances to answer the question.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In which dance is it impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique?\"\n    \n    dances = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Viennese Waltz',\n            'technique': 'Uses continuous rotation, but sway and body turn can be adjusted.
