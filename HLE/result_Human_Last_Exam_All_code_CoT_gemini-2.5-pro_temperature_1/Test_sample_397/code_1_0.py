    Calculates the value of the complex integral based on analytical derivation.

    The problem asks for the value of a complex contour integral.
    A step-by-step analytical derivation shows that all singularities of the
    integrand (poles and branch points) lie outside the specified contour of
    integration.

    Based on Cauchy's Integral Theorem, the integral of a function that is
    analytic everywhere inside the contour is zero.

    Therefore, the value of the integral is an M x M zero matrix.
