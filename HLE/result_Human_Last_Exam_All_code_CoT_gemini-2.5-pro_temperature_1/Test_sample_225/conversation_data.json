    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the curve type:** The curve is a Lissajous curve. These curves are described by parametric equations of the form `x(t) = A sin(at + δ)` and `y(t) = B sin(bt)`. In our case, `A=1`, `B=1`, `a=9`, `b=5`, and the phase shift `δ = π/2` (since `cos(u) = sin(u + π/2)`).\n\n2.  **Use the standard formula:** There is a well-known formula for calculating the number of self-intersection points for a Lissajous curve `(cos(at), sin(bt))` when `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers. The formula is:\n    Number of self-intersections = `(a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2`\n\n3.  **Check the conditions:**\n    *   `a = 9` and `b = 5`.\n    *   Both 9 and 5 are odd integers.\n    *   The greatest common divisor of 9 and 5, `gcd(9, 5)`, is 1. So, they are coprime.\n    The conditions for the formula are met.\n\n4.  **Calculate the result:** We can now substitute the values of `a` and `b` into the formula to find the number of self-intersection points.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The given curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n# x(t) = cos(9t)\n# y(t) = sin(5t)\n# This is a Lissajous curve.\n\n# For a Lissajous curve of the form (cos(at), sin(bt)), where 'a' and 'b'\n# are coprime odd integers, the number of self-intersection points is given by\n# the formula: (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\n\n# In this problem, we have:\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# Check if a and b are coprime and odd.\n# gcd(9, 5) = 1, so they are coprime.\n# 9 and 5 are both odd.\n# The conditions are satisfied, so we can apply the formula.\n\n# Calculate the number of self-intersection points.\nnum_intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) // 2\n\n# Print the calculation steps and the final answer.\nprint(f\"The number of self-intersection points is calculated using the formula (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\")\nprint(f\"Given a = {a} and b = {b}:\")\nprint(f\"Number of points = ({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2\")\nprint(f\"                   = ({a - 1}) * ({b - 1}) / 2\")\nprint(f\"                   = { (a - 1) * (b - 1) } / 2\")\nprint(f\"                   = {num_intersections}\")\n```\n<<<16>>>"
