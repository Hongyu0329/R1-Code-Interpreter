    "An ampule is a sealed glass container that, once broken open, cannot be resealed. This makes it an open system, highly susceptible to contamination. According to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) guidelines, which set the standards for sterile compounding, the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period, regardless of the environment's sterility.\n\nTherefore, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is immediate.\n\nI will provide a simple python script to state this rule clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    based on sterile compounding guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    container_type = \"single-dose container ampule\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment\"\n    bud_duration = \"Immediate Use\"\n\n    print(f\"Container Type: {container_type}\")\n    print(f\"Environment: Opened in a {environment}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Guideline Explanation:\")\n    print(\"An ampule is a glass container that cannot be resealed after it is broken open.\")\n    print(\"According to USP (United States Pharmacopeia) sterile compounding standards, once an ampule is opened, its contents must be used immediately.\")\n    print(\"Any unused portion must be discarded.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
