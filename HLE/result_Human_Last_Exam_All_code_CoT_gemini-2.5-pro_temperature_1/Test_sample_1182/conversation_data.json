    "To determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of the curve**: Determine its genus, $g$.\n2.  **Find the branch points**: The branch points of the map from the curve to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$ are the roots of the polynomial on the right-hand side and possibly the point at infinity.\n3.  **Determine the 2-adic valuations of the branch points**: We use the Newton polygon method for this.\n4.  **Cluster the branch points**: Branch points are grouped into clusters based on their 2-adic distance. All points in a cluster reduce to the same point modulo 2. The stable reduction of the curve will have one component for each cluster of branch points.\n5.  **Calculate the genera of the components**: The geometric genus of each component of the stable reduction is determined by the number of branch points in its corresponding cluster.\n6.  **Calculate the number of double points**: Using the formula that relates the genus of the original curve to the genera of the components and the number of double points in the stable reduction, we can solve for the number of double points, $\\delta$.\n\nThis process allows us to understand the structure of the stable reduction and find the number of its double points without performing complex geometric transformations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_double_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve\n    y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5 above p=2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the properties of the curve.\n    # The curve is given by y^2 = f(x), where f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x^2 + 8*x.\n    # The degree of f(x) is 5.\n    # The genus of a hyperelliptic curve y^2=f(x) is g = floor((deg(f)-1)/2).\n    degree = 5\n    g = (degree - 1) // 2\n    print(f\"The curve has genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Find the branch points.\n    # The branch points are the roots of f(x) and, since the degree is odd, the point at infinity.\n    # f(x) = x * (8*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^2 + x + 8).\n    # One branch point is x_0 = 0.\n    # Let P(x) = 8*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^2 + x + 8.
