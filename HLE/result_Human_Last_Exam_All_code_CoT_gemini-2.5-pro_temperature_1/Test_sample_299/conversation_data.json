    "Here is a thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the function's properties**: Let $S$ be the set of continuous functions $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$. I need to determine the size (cardinality) of $S$.\n    *   **Injectivity**: If $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$, then applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is a one-to-one function, $x_1 = x_2$. Thus, $f$ must be injective.\n    *   **Monotonicity**: A continuous and injective function defined on $\\mathbb{R}$ must be strictly monotonic. This means $f$ is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.\n\n2.  **Case 1: $f$ is strictly decreasing.**\n    *   If $f$ is a strictly decreasing continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$, it must have exactly one fixed point. A fixed point is a number $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   (Proof sketch for fixed point: Let $g(x) = f(x) - x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x) \\to -\\infty$, so $g(x) \\to -\\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x) \\to \\infty$, so $g(x) \\to \\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be an $x_0$ where $g(x_0) = 0$, which means $f(x_0) = x_0$.)\n    *   If $f$ has a fixed point $x_0$, then $f(f(x_0)) = f(x_0) = x_0$.\n    *   From the given equation, $f(f(x_0)) = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   This implies $x_0 = \\exp(x_0)$.\n    *   The equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions. (The function $g(x) = e^x - x$ has a global minimum of 1 at $x=0$, so it is never zero).\n    *   This is a contradiction. Therefore, no strictly decreasing continuous function can satisfy the given equation.\n\n3.  **Case 2: $f$ is strictly increasing.**\n    *   This case is possible. Let's analyze the range of $f$. The range of $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$.\n    *   Let $R_f$ be the range of $f$. The equation implies $f(R_f) = (0, \\infty)$.\n    *   Since $f$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range $R_f$ must be an open interval of the form $(c, \\infty)$ for some $c \\in \\mathbb{R} \\cup \\{-\\infty\\}$.\n    *   If $c=-\\infty$, then $R_f = \\mathbb{R}$. This would mean $f(\\mathbb{R}) = (0, \\infty)$, which contradicts $R_f = \\mathbb{R}$. So, $c$ must be a finite real number.\n    *   As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $c$ from above. So $f(f(x))$ approaches $\\lim_{y \\to c^+} f(y)$.\n    *   We also know that as $x \\to -\\infty$, $\\exp(x) \\to 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\lim_{y \\to c^+} f(y) = 0$. Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, we can say $f(c) = 0$.\n    *   For $f(c)=0$ to be consistent with the range of $f$ being $(c, \\infty)$, we must have $0 \\in (c, \\infty)$, which means $c < 0$.\n    *   So, any solution $f$ must be strictly increasing, and there must be a unique number $c < 0$ such that $f(c)=0$.\n\n4.  **Constructing Solutions and Finding the Cardinality.**\n    *   It turns out that we can construct a solution for *any* choice of $c < 0$ and *any* choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function $h$ that maps the interval $[c, 0]$ to $[0, \\exp(c)]$ (i.e., a homeomorphism between these intervals).\n    *   Once we define $f(x) = h(x)$ on $[c, 0]$, the function $f$ is uniquely determined for all other $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ by the relation $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n    *   The number of choices for $c \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   For any fixed $c$, the number of possible functions $h$ is also the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. (This is the cardinality of the set of homeomorphisms of a closed interval that fix the endpoints).\n    *   The total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $c$ and the number of choices for $h$. This is $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n5.  **Final Conclusion**: The cardinality of the set of these functions is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning and present the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f: R -> R\n    satisfying f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The equation given is f(f(x)) = exp(x).\n    # We can represent the right hand side using sympy.\n    # The coefficient of x in exp(x) is 1.\n    coefficient_of_x = 1\n    # The base of the exponential is Euler's number, e.\n    base = sympy.E\n\n    print(\"The problem is to find the cardinality of the set of continuous functions f such that:\")\n    print(f\"f(f(x)) = exp({coefficient_of_x}*x)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze properties of f.\")\n    print(\"f must be injective, and therefore strictly monotonic.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Rule out the strictly decreasing case.\")\n    print(\"A strictly decreasing continuous f: R -> R has a unique fixed point x0.\")\n    print(\"This would require exp(x0) = x0, which has no real solutions.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: No decreasing solutions exist.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the strictly increasing case.\")\n    print(\"For any solution f, there exists a unique c < 0 such that f(c) = 0.\")\n    print(\"A solution is determined by:\")\n    print(\"  a) The choice of this number c < 0.\")\n    print(\"  b) The choice of a continuous, strictly increasing function h mapping [c, 0] to [0, exp(c)].\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the cardinality.\")\n    # The number of choices for c in the interval (-inf, 0) is the cardinality of the continuum.\n    num_choices_c = sympy.S.Continuum\n\n    # For each c, the number of choices for the function h is also the cardinality of the continuum.\n    num_choices_h = sympy.S.Continuum\n\n    # The total number of solutions is the product of these cardinalities.\n    # In cardinal arithmetic, continuum * continuum = continuum.\n    total_cardinality = num_choices_c * num_choices_h\n\n    print(f\"The number of choices for c is {num_choices_c}.\")\n    print(f\"The number of choices for h is {num_choices_h}.\")\n    print(f\"The total cardinality is the product: {num_choices_c} * {num_choices_h} = {total_cardinality}.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final Answer:\")\n    print(f\"The cardinality of the set of these functions is {total_cardinality}.\")\n\nsolve_cardinality()\n```\n<<<Continuum>>>"
