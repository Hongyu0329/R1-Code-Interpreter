    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my analysis and the Python code to demonstrate the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Health Formula:** First, I will determine the formula used by Terraria to calculate the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode. This involves finding its base health and the scaling factor applied for each additional player.\n2.  **Analyze for Infinite Players:** I will analyze this formula as the number of players approaches infinity. This is a mathematical limit problem. Since the health scales linearly with the number of players, the health will not approach a finite number.\n3.  **Create a Demonstration Script:** I will write a Python script that implements this formula. While the script cannot compute for an infinite number of players, it will demonstrate the calculation for any given large number and print the full equation as you requested, showing how the final health value is derived.\n\n### Analysis:\nAccording to Terraria's game mechanics for Expert Mode:\n*   The base health of the Eye of Cthulhu for a single player is **3640**.\n*   For each additional player in the world, the boss's health increases by **35%** of this base value.\n*   This can be expressed with the formula:\n    `Total Health = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\nThis formula is a linear function. As the `NumberOfPlayers` increases, the `Total Health` increases without any upper limit. Therefore, as the number of players approaches infinity, the theoretical health also approaches **infinity**.\n\nHere is the Python code to demonstrate this calculation with a large number of players.\n\n```python\n# Define the constants based on Terraria's game mechanics for Expert Mode.\nbase_health = 3640\nhealth_increase_per_player = 0.35\n\n# The problem asks for the health with an infinite number of players.\n# The health formula is a linear function: H(n) = base_health * (1 + 0.35 * (n - 1)),\n# where 'n' is the number of players. As 'n' approaches infinity, H(n) also approaches infinity.\n# Therefore, there is no finite maximum health.\n\nprint(\"The theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode with an infinite number of players is infinite.\")\nprint(\"This is because its health scales linearly with the number of players.\")\nprint(\"Formula: Total Health = BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\\n\")\n\n# To demonstrate the formula, we will calculate the health for a very large,\n# but finite, number of players, for example: 1,000,000.\nnumber_of_players = 1000000\n\nprint(f\"--- Example Calculation for {number_of_players:,} Players ---\")\n\n# Calculate the final health using the formula.\n# We calculate the scaling factor first for clarity.\nscaling_factor = 1 + health_increase_per_player * (number_of_players - 1)\nfinal_health = base_health * scaling_factor\n\n# Print the final equation showing how each number is used, as requested.\n# Health is an integer value in the game.\nprint(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\nprint(f\"{int(final_health)} = {base_health} * (1 + {health_increase_per_player} * ({number_of_players} - 1))\")\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
