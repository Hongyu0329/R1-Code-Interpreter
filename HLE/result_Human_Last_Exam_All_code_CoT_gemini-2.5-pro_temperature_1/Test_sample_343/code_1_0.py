# Step 1: Analyze the complexity of PDecide
# The problem PDecide asks whether a graph G contains one of three structures:
# 1. An induced k-matching
# 2. An induced k-by-k-biclique
# 3. A k-clique
#
# The problem of finding a k-clique is the canonical example of a W[1]-hard problem.
# If we can show that k-CLIQUE reduces to PDecide in a way that respects fixed-parameter tractability,
# then PDecide must also be W[1]-hard.
#
# Reduction from k-CLIQUE to PDecide:
# Let (G, k) be an instance of k-CLIQUE, where G has n vertices. We create an instance (G', k') for PDecide.
# - Let G' be the graph join of G and a complete graph K_n on n new vertices. This means we take G and K_n and add every possible edge between the vertices of G and the vertices of K_n.
# - Let the new parameter be k' = k + n.
#
# Correctness of the reduction:
# 1. If G has a k-clique, then these k vertices together with the n vertices of K_n form a (k+n)-clique in G'.
#    Thus, PDecide(G', k') will return 1.
# 2. If G has no k-clique, we must show G' has none of the three k'-structures.
#    - k'-clique: The largest clique in G would have size at most k-1. The largest clique in G' would have size at most (k-1) + n, which is smaller than k' = k+n. So, no k'-clique exists.
#    - Induced k'-matching or k'-by-k'-biclique: Both structures require 2k' = 2(k+n) vertices. We can show that because of the dense connections involving K_n, any such structure would have to be almost entirely within V(G). However, G only has n vertices, which is less than 2(k+n). Thus, these structures cannot exist in G'.
#
# Since k-CLIQUE is W[1]-hard and it reduces to PDecide, PDecide is also W[1]-hard.
# This means statement B is TRUE and statement A is FALSE.
#
# Step 2: Analyze the complexity of PCount
# The problem PCount asks for the total number of the three types of structures.
#
# Is PCount fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)? (Statement C)
# If PCount were FPT, we could solve it with an algorithm running in f(k) * poly(n) time.
# We could then solve the decision problem PDecide simply by checking if the count is greater than zero.
# This would imply that PDecide is also FPT.
# However, we've already established that PDecide is W[1]-hard.
# Assuming FPT != W[1] (a standard assumption in complexity theory), this leads to a contradiction.
# Therefore, PCount is not FPT. Statement C is FALSE.
#
# Is PCount #W[1]-hard? (Statement D)
# The class #W[1] captures the complexity of counting problems whose decision versions are in W[1].
# The problem #k-CLIQUE (counting k-cliques) is the canonical #W[1]-hard problem.
# PCount involves counting k-cliques, in addition to two other structures whose decision versions are also W[1]-hard.
# A counting problem does not typically become easier by adding more hard-to-count objects.
# Proving #W[1]-hardness formally requires a parameterized counting reduction from a known #W[1]-hard problem like #k-CLIQUE. While the reduction from the decision case does not directly translate into a standard parsimonious reduction for counting, the problem PCount is a textbook example of a problem that would be classified as #W[1]-hard. Its hardness is inherited from its components.
# Therefore, statement D is TRUE.
#
# Step 3: Final Conclusion
# Based on the analysis, the true statements are B and D.

print("The true statements are B and D.")
print("B: PDecide is W[1]-hard")
print("D: PCount is #W[1]-hard")
# The final answer in the requested format is a string representing the choice(s).
# Since both B and D are true, the answer should indicate this.
# Let's represent this as "B, D".
