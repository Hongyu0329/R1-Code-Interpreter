    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we analyze the number of elementary operations performed as a function of the input size `n`.\n\n### Step-by-step Complexity Analysis:\n\n1.  **Input Size:** The primary input that affects the number of operations is the integer `n`. The base `c` is considered a constant since it does not grow.\n\n2.  **Initialization (Step 1):**\n    `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_{0} := x — qc;`\n    This step involves a few basic arithmetic operations (division, multiplication, subtraction) and assignments. These operations take a constant amount of time, which we can denote as O(1).\n\n3.  **The `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    The core of the algorithm is the `while q > 0` loop. The total time complexity will be determined by how many times this loop executes.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Loop Variable `q`:** Let's trace the value of `q` through the iterations:\n    *   Before the loop: `q` is initialized to `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   After iteration 1: The new value of `q` becomes `⌊(old q)/c⌋`, which is `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋ = ⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   After iteration 2: `q` becomes `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   After `k` iterations: `q` becomes `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n\n5.  **Loop Termination:** The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^(k+1)` drops below 1.\n    `n / c^(k+1) < 1  =>  n < c^(k+1)`\n    To find the number of iterations `k+1`, we can take the logarithm base `c` of both sides:\n    `log_c(n) < k+1`\n    The number of iterations is the smallest integer `k+1` that satisfies this condition. This means the loop runs `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times.\n\n6.  **Cost of Loop Body (Step 2.1):**\n    `i := i + 1; x := q; q :=. ⌊x/c⌋; a_{i} := x — qc`\n    Each iteration of the loop consists of a fixed number of constant-time operations (increment, assignment, division, multiplication, subtraction). Therefore, the cost of the loop body is O(1).\n\n7.  **Total Complexity:**\n    The total time complexity is the number of loop iterations multiplied by the cost of the work inside the loop, plus the cost of initialization.\n    *   Total Time = (Initialization Cost) + (Number of Iterations) * (Loop Body Cost)\n    *   Total Time = O(1) + `⌊log_c(n)⌋` * O(1)\n    *   This simplifies to **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n8.  **Final Simplification:** In complexity analysis, the base of the logarithm is usually dropped because it only differs by a constant factor from any other base (`log_c(n) = log_b(n) / log_b(c)`). Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log_b(c)` is also a constant. Therefore, the complexity is written as **O(log n)**.\n\nThe following Python code implements the algorithm and demonstrates this logarithmic relationship by printing the number of iterations for a given `n` and `c`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_and_run_IMAG(n, c):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function implements the IMAG algorithm to convert n to its base c representation.\n    It also prints the final representation, a verification equation, and data for \n    complexity analysis.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The integer to convert (n >= 0).\n        c (int): The base to convert to (c >= 2).\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Start of the IMAG Algorithm Implementation ---\n    \n    if n < 0 or c < 2:\n        print(\"Input error: n must be >= 0 and c must be >= 2.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"Running IMAG(n={n}, c={c})\")\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(\"The base\", c, \"representation of\", n, \"is: (0)\")\n        print(\"Final Equation: 0 = 0 *\", c, \"^ 0\")\n        print(\"Number of loop iterations: 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Initialization\n    i = 0\n    x = n\n    q = x // c\n    a0 = x - q * c\n    \n    # List 'a' stores digits in reverse order: a0, a1, ...\n    a = [a0]\n    \n    loop_iterations = 0\n\n    # Step 2: Loop\n    while q > 0:\n        loop_iterations += 1\n        # Step 2.1\n        i += 1\n        x = q\n        q = x // c\n        ai = x - q * c\n        a.append(ai)\n        \n    # Step 3: Final result\n    # Reverse the list to get the correct representation (ai, ..., a1, a0)\n    representation = a[::-1]\n    \n    # --- End of Algorithm Implementation ---\n\n\n    # --- Output and Analysis ---\n    \n    # Print the representation as a tuple\n    print(\"The base\", c, \"representation of\", n, \"is:\", tuple(representation))\n\n    # Print the final equation showing how each digit contributes to the original number\n    equation_parts = []\n    check_sum = 0\n    power = len(representation) - 1\n    for digit in representation:\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{digit} * {c}^{power}\")\n        check_sum += digit * (c ** power)\n        power -= 1\n    \n    print(\"Final Equation:\", n, \"=\", \" + \".join(equation_parts))\n    print(f\"Verification: The sum evaluates to {check_sum}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    # Print the complexity analysis based on the run\n    print(\"Complexity Analysis:\")\n    print(f\"The 'while' loop ran {loop_iterations} times.\")\n    \n    # The theoretical number of iterations is floor(log_c(n))\n    theoretical_iterations = math.floor(math.log(n, c))\n    print(f\"Theoretical number of iterations (floor(log_c(n))) is: {theoretical_iterations}\")\n    print(\"This shows that the number of operations is proportional to log(n).\")\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# You can change these values to test the algorithm\ninput_n = 2024\ninput_c = 7\n\nanalyze_and_run_IMAG(input_n, input_c)\n```\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
