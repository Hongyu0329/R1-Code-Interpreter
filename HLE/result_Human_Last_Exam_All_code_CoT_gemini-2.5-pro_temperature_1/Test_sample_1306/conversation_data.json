    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the mathematical object in question:** The problem asks about the representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. Let $\\ell=3$ be the order of the root of unity.\n\n2.  **Understand the categories of representations:** For $q$ being a root of unity with order $\\ell \\ge 3$, the category of finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ is known to be of \"wild\" representation type. This means that classifying all indecomposable representations is a very difficult, unsolved problem. In particular, for any given dimension (with a few exceptions), there are infinitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable representations.\n\n3.  **Count irreducible vs. indecomposable representations:**\n    *   The number of irreducible (or simple) representations is finite. For $\\ell=3$, there are $\\ell-1=2$ such representations up to isomorphism.\n    *   The total number of indecomposable representations is infinite due to the wild representation type.\n\n4.  **Initial conclusion and re-interpretation:** A literal interpretation of \"percentage of the objects\" would be the ratio of the number of irreducible objects to the number of indecomposable objects. This would be $2 / \\infty$, which is 0%. This is a valid mathematical answer, but it's possible the question intends to ask about a more specific, canonical subset of representations, especially since a computational task is requested.\n\n5.  **Propose a tractable interpretation:** A common practice in representation theory is to study a specific family of important modules. The most natural choice in this context is the set of **Weyl modules** (or standard modules) $\\{V_k\\}_{k=0}^{\\ell-1}$. These are the quantum analogues of the first $\\ell$ irreducible representations of the classical Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$. We will assume that the question is implicitly asking about the percentage of irreducibles within this specific set of $\\ell$ modules.\n\n6.  **Perform the calculation based on the new interpretation:**\n    *   The total number of objects in our considered set $\\{V_0, V_1, V_2\\}$ is $\\ell=3$.\n    *   A Weyl module $V_k$ is irreducible if and only if its dimension, $k+1$, is strictly less than $\\ell$. For $\\ell=3$, this condition is $k+1 < 3$, which is true for $k=0$ and $k=1$.\n    *   So, within the set $\\{V_0, V_1, V_2\\}$, the modules $V_0$ and $V_1$ are irreducible. This gives us 2 irreducible modules.\n    *   The percentage is the ratio of the number of irreducible modules to the total number of modules in our set, multiplied by 100. This is $(\\ell-1)/\\ell \\times 100 = (2/3) \\times 100$.\n\n7.  **Write the code:** The Python code will implement this final calculation. It will set $\\ell=3$, calculate the number of irreducible and total modules according to our interpretation, compute the percentage, and print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the order of the root of unity q.\n# q is a primitive third root of unity, so l = 3.\nl = 3\n\n# Step 2: Define the total number of objects in our considered set.\n# Based on our interpretation, we are considering the set of Weyl modules {V_0, ..., V_{l-1}}.\n# The total number of these modules is l.\nnum_total_objects = l\n\n# Step 3: Determine the number of irreducible objects in this set.\n# A Weyl module V_k is irreducible if and only if k+1 < l, which means k < l-1.\n# The values of k that satisfy this are 0, 1, ..., l-2.\n# The count of such values is l-1.\nnum_irreducible_objects = l - 1\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the percentage.\npercentage = (num_irreducible_objects / num_total_objects) * 100\n\n# Step 5: Print the components of the final equation as requested.\nprint(f\"Based on the interpretation of considering the first l={l} Weyl modules:\")\nprint(f\"Total number of objects considered: {num_total_objects}\")\nprint(f\"Number of irreducible objects among them: {num_irreducible_objects}\")\nprint(f\"The final equation for the percentage is: {num_irreducible_objects} / {num_total_objects} * 100 = {percentage}\")\n\n```\n<<<66.66666666666667>>>"
