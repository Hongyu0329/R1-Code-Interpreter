# Step 1: Define the order of the root of unity q.
# q is a primitive third root of unity, so l = 3.
l = 3

# Step 2: Define the total number of objects in our considered set.
# Based on our interpretation, we are considering the set of Weyl modules {V_0, ..., V_{l-1}}.
# The total number of these modules is l.
num_total_objects = l

# Step 3: Determine the number of irreducible objects in this set.
# A Weyl module V_k is irreducible if and only if k+1 < l, which means k < l-1.
# The values of k that satisfy this are 0, 1, ..., l-2.
# The count of such values is l-1.
num_irreducible_objects = l - 1

# Step 4: Calculate the percentage.
percentage = (num_irreducible_objects / num_total_objects) * 100

# Step 5: Print the components of the final equation as requested.
