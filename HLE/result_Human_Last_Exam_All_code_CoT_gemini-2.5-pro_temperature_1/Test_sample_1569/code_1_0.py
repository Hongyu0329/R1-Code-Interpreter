    print("B. Plasmodium (Malaria): Unlikely. Not endemic to Oklahoma. Would require travel to a malaria-endemic region.")
    
    print("C. Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme Disease): Unlikely. The Lyme serology is negative. While late-stage Lyme can cause neurologic and cardiac issues, the lab test points away from this diagnosis.")

    print("D. Ehrlichia: Possible. This is a tick-borne illness common in Oklahoma. It causes fever, headache, myalgia, and can cause confusion (disorientation). However, a new heart murmur is not a characteristic feature.")

    print("E. Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever - RMSF): Most Likely. RMSF is prevalent in Oklahoma. It classically presents with fever, severe headache, and myalgia. Crucially, it often involves the central nervous system (causing disorientation) and can cause myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), which would explain a new heart murmur. This diagnosis fits the combination of geography, systemic symptoms, severe neurologic signs, and cardiac involvement.")
