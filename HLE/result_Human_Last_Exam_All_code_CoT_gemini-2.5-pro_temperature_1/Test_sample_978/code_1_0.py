  This script analyzes the provided legal scenario and determines the correct allocation of liability.

  Analysis Summary:
  1.  Mark's Incident (Pool Damage):
      - Mark was negligent. He is liable.
      - Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is vicariously liable for its employee's negligence.
      - Therefore, Evergreen and Mark are jointly and severally liable.
      - The neighbours' connection is too remote to attract liability.

  2.  Lincoln's Incident (Car Damage):
      - Lincoln was negligent by blowing rocks at a car. He is liable.
      - Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. is vicariously liable for this action as well.
      - Therefore, Evergreen and Lincoln are jointly and severally liable.
      - The "minimal damage" argument does not negate liability, it only affects the amount of damages.

  Conclusion:
  Based on this analysis, choice E is the only one that correctly assigns liability for both incidents.
