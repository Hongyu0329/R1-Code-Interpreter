    "To determine the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication of two matrices represented by a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree structure, we first need to understand how these matrices are stored and how the multiplication algorithm works.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Model the HSS Structure:** An HSS matrix is defined by a hierarchical partitioning of its indices, which can be represented by a full binary tree. The \"submatrices\" in this context are the generator matrices (like diagonal blocks, off-diagonal interaction blocks, and basis vectors) associated with each node of this tree.\n2.  **Count Nodes in the Tree:** A full binary tree of depth `d` (where the root is at level 0 and leaves are at level `d`) has a specific number of nodes. We will calculate this number. The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at each level: `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^d`. This is a geometric series that sums to `2^(d+1) - 1`.\n3.  **Analyze the Multiplication Algorithm:** The multiplication of two HSS matrices, `C = A * B`, involves an algorithm that computes the generator submatrices for `C` at each node of the tree. To do this, it requires access to the corresponding generator submatrices from both `A` and `B` for every node in the tree structure.\n4.  **Calculate Total Accesses:** The total number of submatrices accessed will be the sum of submatrices from matrix `A` and matrix `B`. This is twice the number of nodes in a single HSS tree.\n5.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to perform this calculation for a tree of depth 4 and print the result along with the steps of the calculation.\n\nNow, let's execute the plan with the given depth of 4.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_multiplication():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during the multiplication\n    of two HSS matrices represented by a tree of a given depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree.\n    depth = 4\n\n    # An HSS matrix representation is built upon a binary tree.
