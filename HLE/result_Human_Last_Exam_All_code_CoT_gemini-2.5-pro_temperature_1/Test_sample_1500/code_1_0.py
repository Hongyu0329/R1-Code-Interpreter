    print("Question: True or false: Every coadjoint orbit O_lambda of G admits a compatible complex structure, making it a Kähler manifold.")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("1. A coadjoint orbit O_lambda of a compact semisimple Lie group G can be identified with a homogeneous space O_lambda = G / G_lambda, where G_lambda is the stabilizer of lambda.")
    print("2. These spaces are known as generalized flag manifolds.")
    print("3. It is a fundamental theorem that generalized flag manifolds are projective algebraic varieties, which means they inherently possess a complex structure.")
    print("4. The Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau (KKS) form provides a symplectic structure that is compatible with this complex structure.")
    print("5. A manifold with a compatible symplectic and complex structure is, by definition, a Kähler manifold.")
    print("\nConclusion: The statement is True.")
    answer_a = "True"

    print("--- Analysis of Question (b) ---")
    print("Question: For G = SU(n), with lambda in the Weyl alcove, is the second Betti number b_2(O_lambda) always given by n - 1?")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("1. The second Betti number b_2(O_lambda) depends on the structure of the orbit, which is determined by the stabilizer of lambda.")
    print("2. We will test the statement with a counterexample for G = SU(3), where n = 3.")
    n = 3
    n_minus_1 = n - 1
    print(f"3. For n = {n}, the proposed formula gives b_2 = n - 1 = {n_minus_1}.")
    print("4. If lambda is a *regular* element, the orbit is the full flag manifold SU(3)/T, and its second Betti number is indeed 2.")
    print("5. However, if lambda is a *singular* element, the orbit can be a smaller space. For instance, a specific choice of singular lambda gives the orbit O_lambda = CP^2 (the complex projective plane).")
    b2_orbit = 1
    print(f"6. The second Betti number of CP^2 is well-known to be b_2(CP^2) = {b2_orbit}.")
    print("7. We compare the actual Betti number for this orbit with the proposed formula:")
    print(f"The equation we test is {b2_orbit} == {n_minus_1}, which is false.")
    print("\nConclusion: Since we found an orbit where b_2 is not n-1, the statement is not always true. The answer is No.")
    answer_b = "No"

    print("\n" + "="*40 + "\n")

    print("--- Analysis of Question (c) ---")
    print("Question: If O_lambda is endowed with a natural equivariant Kähler metric, must the corresponding equivariant cohomology ring H_G^*(O_lambda; R) be isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a GKM graph?")
    print("\nReasoning:")
    print("1. A manifold's equivariant cohomology is described by GKM theory if the manifold satisfies the 'GKM conditions'.")
    print("2. A key GKM condition is that for each fixed point of the torus action, the weights of the action on the tangent space must be pairwise linearly independent.")
    print("3. Coadjoint orbits O_lambda are flag varieties. According to established results in the field (e.g., by D. Timashev), this condition on the weights holds for flag varieties of simple Lie groups of type A_n and C_n, but it fails for other types.")
    print("4. For example, flag varieties for groups of type B_n (for n>=3), D_n (for n>=4), E_6, E_7, E_8, and F_4 do not generally satisfy the GKM conditions.")
    print("5. Since there exist coadjoint orbits which are not GKM manifolds, their equivariant cohomology ring cannot be described by a GKM graph.")
    print("\nConclusion: The statement is not true for all coadjoint orbits. The answer is No.")
    answer_c = "No"
