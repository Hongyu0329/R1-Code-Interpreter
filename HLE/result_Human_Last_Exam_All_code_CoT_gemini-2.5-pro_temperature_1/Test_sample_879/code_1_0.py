# 1. Define the known masses from the experimental data.
mass_kag1_monomer = 32350
mass_complex_in_og = 101553
# From the mass difference calculation, the mass of the detected lipid is likely around 1501 Da.
# The value 15001 Da in the prompt is assumed to be a typo.
mass_single_lipid = 1501

# 2. Calculate the theoretical mass of a Kag1 trimer (3 units).
number_of_subunits = 3
mass_kag1_trimer = number_of_subunits * mass_kag1_monomer

# 3. Calculate the mass of the molecules bound to the trimer.
mass_of_bound_lipids = mass_complex_in_og - mass_kag1_trimer

# 4. Estimate the number of lipids bound to the trimer.
number_of_lipids = round(mass_of_bound_lipids / mass_single_lipid)

# 5. Print the analysis and the final equation.
