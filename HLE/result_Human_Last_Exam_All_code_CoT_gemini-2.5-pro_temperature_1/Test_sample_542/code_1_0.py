# The problem is designed such that the probability distributions of the determinants of A and B are identical.
# Let p(y) be the PDF of det(A) and q(y) be the PDF of det(B).
# The problem setup implies p(y) = q(y).
# The function to calculate is l(a) = log( integral( p(y)^a * q(y)^(1-a) dy ) )
# If p(y) = q(y), this simplifies to:
# l(a) = log( integral( p(y)^a * p(y)^(1-a) dy ) )
# l(a) = log( integral( p(y) dy ) )
# The integral of a probability density function over its domain is 1.
# l(a) = log(1)

integral_of_pdf = 1
result = math.log(integral_of_pdf)

# The final equation is log(1) = 0
print(f"log({integral_of_pdf}) = {result}")

# The exact value of l(a) is 0.
print("\nThe exact value is:")
print(result)

# Final answer format
print("\n<<<0>>>")
