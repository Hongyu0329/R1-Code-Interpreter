def solve_cyclic_element_problem():

    Solves the topology problem about cyclic elements.

    The solution proceeds in the following steps:
    1.  The problem asks for the maximum number of points a cyclic element 'S' can share
        with other cyclic elements in a compact, connected, locally-connected metric space 'X'.

    2.  Let P be the set of these shared points. According to the structure theory of
        continua, any point p in P must be a cut point of the space X. That is, X - {p}
        is disconnected.

    3.  So, the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum number of cut points of X
        that can lie on a single cyclic element S.

    4.  While one can construct non-planar spaces where this number can be any finite integer 'n',
        a standard (often implicit) assumption for this type of problem is that the space X
        is planar (can be embedded in the plane R^2).

    5.  Under the assumption of planarity, a cyclic element S must be a simple closed curve
        (homeomorphic to a circle).

    6.  A key result in topology (related to the Theta-Curve Theorem) states that a simple
        closed curve within a planar, locally connected continuum can contain at most two
        cut points of that continuum. If it contained three or more, the space would fail
        to be locally connected, violating the problem's conditions.

    7.  This establishes an upper bound of 2 for the cardinality of the set P.

    8.  We must show this maximum is achievable. Consider a space X consisting of a central
        circle (S) with two other circles (S1, S2) attached at two distinct points,
        p1 and p2, on S. This space is planar and meets all the conditions.
        - The cyclic elements are S, S1, and S2.
        - The points of S that also belong to other cyclic elements are p1 (in S1) and p2 (in S2).
        - The set of such points is {p1, p2}.

    9.  The cardinality of this set is 2. Since we have an upper bound of 2 and an example
        that achieves it, the maximum cardinality is 2.
