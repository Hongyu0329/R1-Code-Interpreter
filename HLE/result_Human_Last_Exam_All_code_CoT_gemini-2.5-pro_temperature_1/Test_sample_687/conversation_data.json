    "To find a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles of the $9_{23}$ knot, we can use its HOMFLY polynomial, denoted as $P(a, z)$. A key property of the HOMFLY polynomial relates its span in the variable $z$ to the number of Seifert circles, $s$, of any diagram of the knot.\n\nThe relationship is given by the inequality:\n$s \\geq \\frac{\\text{span}_z(P(a, z))}{2} + 1$\n\nHere, $\\text{span}_z(P(a, z))$ is the difference between the maximum and minimum powers of the variable $z$ that appear in the polynomial. This inequality provides a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles over all possible diagrams of the knot.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Obtain the HOMFLY polynomial for the knot $9_{23}$. I will use the `spherogram` library in Python, which is a standard tool for computational knot theory.\n2.  From the polynomial, determine the minimum and maximum powers of the variable $z$.\n3.  Calculate the $z$-span.\n4.  Use the inequality above to compute the lower bound for the number of Seifert circles.\n5.  Print out each step of the calculation.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan.\n\n```python\n# The user needs to install the 'spherogram' and 'sympy' libraries.\n# They can be installed by running: pip install spherogram sympy\n\nimport spherogram\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_knot_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a lower bound for the minimum number of Seifert circles\n    for the 9_23 knot using its HOMFLY polynomial.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
