    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. In the steady state, as time $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nWhen the probabilities are constant, their derivatives with respect to time are zero, i.e., $P_i'(t) = 0$. This transforms the given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  **Set up the steady-state equations:** By setting $P_i'(t) = 0$ in the given system, we obtain a set of linear equations for $p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n2.  **Solve the system:** We will use three of the first four equations along with the normalization condition ($p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$) to solve for the unknown probabilities. The most straightforward way is to express $p_0, p_2,$ and $p_3$ as multiples of $p_1$.\n3.  **Find $p_1$:** Substitute the expressions for $p_0, p_2,$ and $p_3$ into the normalization equation. This will allow us to solve for $p_1$.\n4.  **Find $p_0$:** Once $p_1$ is known, we can easily calculate $p_0$ using the relationship found in step 2.\n5.  **Calculate the final sum:** Compute the required value $p_0 + p_1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It defines the given transition rates, solves the system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_0$ and $p_1$, and then prints the sum $p_0 + p_1$, showing the individual values as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state (t -> +inf), the derivatives P_i'(t) are zero.\n# This gives a system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities p_i.\n# 1) 0 = -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1\n# 2) 0 = lambda_01*p0 - (lambda_10 + lambda_12)*p1 + lambda_21*p2 + lambda_31*p3\n# 3) 0 = lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2\n# 4) 0 = lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3\n# 5) 1 = p0 + p1 + p2 + p3\n\n# We can solve this system by expressing p0, p2, and p3 in terms of p1.\n\n# From equation (1): p0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * p1\ncoeff_p0_p1 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n# From equation (3): p2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * p1\ncoeff_p2_p1 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n# From equation (4): p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * p2\n# Substitute the expression for p2: p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * coeff_p2_p1 * p1\ncoeff_p3_p2 = lambda_23 / lambda_31\ncoeff_p3_p1 = coeff_p3_p2 * coeff_p2_p1\n\n# Now use the normalization condition (5):\n# p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n# (coeff_p0_p1 * p1) + p1 + (coeff_p2_p1 * p1) + (coeff_p3_p1 * p1) = 1\n# p1 * (coeff_p0_p1 + 1 + coeff_p2_p1 + coeff_p3_p1) = 1\n\n# Calculate the total coefficient for p1\ntotal_coeff = coeff_p0_p1 + 1 + coeff_p2_p1 + coeff_p3_p1\n\n# Solve for p1\np1 = 1 / total_coeff\n\n# Calculate p0\np0 = coeff_p0_p1 * p1\n\n# The quantity to find is p0 + p1\nresult = p0 + p1\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(\"The final equation is P_0(+inf) + P_1(+inf) = Result\")\nprint(f\"{p0:.5f} + {p1:.5f} = {result:.5f}\")\n```\n<<<0.94625>>>"
