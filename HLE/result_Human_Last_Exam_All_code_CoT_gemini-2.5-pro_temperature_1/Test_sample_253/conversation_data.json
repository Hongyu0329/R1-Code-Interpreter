    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will explain the step-by-step process for simulating the cellular automaton according to Rule 110.\n1.  I will represent the line of cells as a list of 0s and 1s. To prevent the pattern from hitting the boundary, I will make this list sufficiently large and start with a single '1' in the middle, with all other cells as '0'.\n2.  I will define the rules for Rule 110. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. There are 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns, and Rule 110 specifies the outcome for each.\n3.  I will then iterate 20 times to simulate 20 generations. In each iteration, a new list of cells is created by applying the Rule 110 logic to each cell's neighborhood in the current list.\n4.  After 20 iterations are complete, I will have the final pattern. I will trim any leading or trailing zeros from the result to show only the significant part of the pattern.\n5.  Finally, the code will print the resulting binary pattern as a single sequence of numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the simulation:\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Rule 110 for a specified number of generations starting from a single cell.\n    \"\"\"\n    generations = 20\n    # The pattern grows by at most 1 cell on each side per generation.\n    # Width = 2 * generations + buffer.
