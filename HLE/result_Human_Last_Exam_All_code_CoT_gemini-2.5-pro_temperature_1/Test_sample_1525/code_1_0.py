# Step 1: Analyze each statement based on the provided mathematical framework.

# Statement A: Correct. The critique of the definition's reliance on an arbitrary "order of appearance" is a valid point regarding its formal clarity.
is_A_correct = True

# Statement B: Incorrect. The segregation process, due to the union operator, is order-independent. The claim that γ[γ⁻¹[P]] = P is likely to hold, contrary to the statement's suggestion.
is_B_correct = False

# Statement C: Correct. The aggregation operator γ is potentially lossy, so applying segregation after aggregation (γ⁻¹[γ[P]]) is not guaranteed to recover the original program P.
is_C_correct = True

# Statement D: Incorrect. The segregation operation γ⁻¹ is defined by a specific, deterministic formula which applies to S₀ just as it would to any Datalog program. It is not ambiguous.
is_D_correct = False

# Statement E: Correct. This is an accurate high-level interpretation of the main mathematical claim, which relates coarse-grained inference to fine-grained inference within a stable system.
is_E_correct = True

# Step 2: Tally the number of correct statements.
correct_statements = [
    is_A_correct,
    is_B_correct,
    is_C_correct,
    is_D_correct,
    is_E_correct
]

# The sum of a list of booleans counts the number of True values.
count = sum(correct_statements)

# Step 3: Print the final count.
print(count)
