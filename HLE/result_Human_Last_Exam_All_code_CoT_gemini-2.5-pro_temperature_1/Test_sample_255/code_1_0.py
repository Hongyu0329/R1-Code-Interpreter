    Calculates the dimension of the cohomology group H^2(G,M).

    The dimension is determined by a polynomial calculation derived from the
    Mayer-Vietoris sequence for group cohomology.
    
    Let G = <a, b | a^8 = b^8> and M be the specified G-module.
    The dimension of H^2(G,M) is given by the dimension of the vector space:
    M / ((T^8 - I)M + (I + T + ... + T^7)M)
    where T is the matrix representing the action of a (and b) on M.

    This dimension is equivalent to the degree of the greatest common divisor (GCD)
    of the polynomials corresponding to the module structure and the operators.
    - M corresponds to the polynomial x^128 - 1.
    - T^8 - I corresponds to the polynomial x^8 - 1.
    - I + T + ... + T^7 corresponds to the polynomial 1 + x + ... + x^7.

    We calculate deg(gcd(x^128 - 1, x^8 - 1, 1 + x + ... + x^7)).
