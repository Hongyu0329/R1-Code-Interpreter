    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The integral is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`, whose antiderivative is `ln|f(x)|`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`. I will verify that `F₃(x)` is positive over the interval `[0, 1]` so the absolute value signs can be removed.\n3.  **Calculate `F₃(0)`**:\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Calculate `F₃(1)`**:\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)`\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n5.  **Calculate the Value V**: Substitute the values of `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the expression from step 2 to find `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: Compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n7.  **Code Implementation**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print all the intermediate and final values.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to evaluate the definite integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) from 0 to 1.\n# The antiderivative of a function in the form f'(x)/f(x) is ln(f(x)).\n# Therefore, the value of the integral, V, is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n\n# Define the functions to find F₃(x)\ndef f3(x):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the value of F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\"\"\"\n    f0_x = x\n    f1_x = math.sin(f0_x)\n    f2_x = math.exp(f1_x)\n    f3_x = math.log(1 + f2_x)\n    return f3_x\n\n# Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)\nf3_at_1 = f3(1)\nf3_at_0 = f3(0)\n\n# The value of the integral V is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# The final requested value is 10000 * V, rounded to the nearest integer\nfinal_answer = round(10000 * V)\n\n# Print the step-by-step evaluation of the final equation\nprint(f\"The value of the integral is given by the equation: V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(f\"First, we evaluate the terms:\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"Now, we substitute these values back into the equation for V:\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V = {V}\")\nprint(f\"Finally, we calculate 10000 * V and round to the closest integer:\")\nprint(f\"10000 * {V} = {10000 * V}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {final_answer}\")\n<<<5488>>>\n```"
