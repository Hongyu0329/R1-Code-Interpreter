    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to consider all possible ways to construct such a group. Any finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify all irreducible finite Weyl groups and their ranks.\n2.  Find all integer partitions of the number 4. Each partition represents a way to sum the ranks of irreducible components to get a total rank of 4.\n3.  For each partition, we will count how many distinct combinations of irreducible Weyl groups match that partition of ranks.\n4.  The total number of non-isomorphic groups of rank 4 is the sum of the counts from all partitions.\n\nThis process can be systematically performed using a Python script. The script will first define the known irreducible Weyl groups for ranks 1 through 4. Then, it will iterate through the partitions of 4, calculate the number of group combinations for each, and sum them up to get the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef combinations_with_replacement(n, k):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n with replacement.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0 and k > 0:\n        return 0\n    return math.comb(n + k - 1, k)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_rank = 4\n\n    # Classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups by rank.\n    # We list the standard non-isomorphic types for each rank up to 4.\n    # Note on isomorphisms: W(B_n) is isomorphic to W(C_n).
