    This function solves the mathematical problem posed by the user.

    The problem asks for the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications
    of the ray with remainder X, where X is an arbitrary nondegenerate
    locally-connected compact metric space.

    Step 1: A theorem in topology states that the remainder of any compactification
    of the ray must be a connected space. So X must be a continuum.

    Step 2: For any such space X (a nondegenerate locally connected continuum),
    it is known that there exist at least two distinct types of compactifications:
    point-like and oscillation-type. This means for any valid X, there are
    at least 2 compactifications.

    Step 3: A theorem by J. Kulesza states that the number of compactifications
    is exactly 2 if and only if X is a simple closed curve (like a circle).
    A circle is a valid choice for X as it is a nondegenerate, locally-connected,
    compact metric space.

    Step 4: Since the number of compactifications is always at least 2, and we have
    found a case where it is exactly 2, the smallest possible number is 2.
