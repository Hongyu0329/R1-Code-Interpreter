    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) have been recorded feeding on, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Research the Diet:** I will access my knowledge base to find information on the feeding habits of adult Raphidiopterans. I will look for primary food sources as well as any supplemental food they might consume.\n2.  **Evaluate the Options:** I will compare the research findings against each of the provided answer choices (A through G).\n3.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the evaluation, I will identify which of the choices are supported by scientific records. Adult Raphidiopterans are known to be predatory, feeding on small, soft-bodied insects like aphids. They are also known to supplement this diet with pollen and nectar.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically represents this information. The script will define the known diet components and check them against the provided options to arrive at the most accurate answer, which will then be printed to the console.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans to answer a multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known dietary components for adult Raphidiopterans\n    known_foods = {\n        \"Nectar\": True,\n        \"Pollen\": True,\n        \"Aphids\": True,\n        \"Mites\": True,\n        \"Fungus\": False,\n        \"Leaf tissue\": False\n    }\n\n    # The answer choices provided\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': ['A', 'E'],\n        'G': ['D', 'E']\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Evaluate individual options\n    is_nectar_eaten = known_foods.get(\"Nectar\", False)\n    # Aphids are a specific type of prey.
