    "To determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group (Γ), we can use its structural properties. This problem can be solved by reducing it to a simpler counting problem in a finite group.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Reduce the problem using group theory:** We will leverage a key property of the Grigorchuk group: its abelianization (the group divided by its commutator subgroup, Γ/[Γ, Γ]) is isomorphic to (C₂)³, the direct product of three cyclic groups of order 2.\n2.  **Show all index 4 subgroups are normal:** We will argue that any subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group must be a normal subgroup. This is because any non-normal subgroup of index 4 would lead to a contradiction when analyzing the possible quotient groups. This implies we only need to count normal subgroups of index 4.\n3.  **Count subgroups in the abelianization:** The normal subgroups of index 4 in Γ are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of index 4 in its abelianization, (C₂)³.\n4.  **Solve the counting problem:** The group (C₂)³ has order 2³ = 8. A subgroup of index 4 must have order 8 / 4 = 2. Subgroups of order 2 are generated by elements of order 2. In (C₂)³, every one of the 7 non-identity elements has order 2 and generates a unique subgroup of order 2.\n5.  **Write the code:** The Python code will implement this final counting step by explicitly identifying the elements of (C₂)³ and counting how many of them can generate a subgroup of order 2.\n\nThe core of the argument is that the problem simplifies from the complex, infinite Grigorchuk group to the simple, finite group (C₂)³.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_subgroup_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group\n    by counting the subgroups of order 2 in its abelianization, (C_2)^3.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: The problem of finding subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group\")\n    print(\"can be reduced to finding the number of subgroups of index 4 in its\")\n    print(\"abelianization, which is the group (C_2)^3.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The group G = (C_2)^3 has order 8.
