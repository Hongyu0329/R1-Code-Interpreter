# Final Answer Calculation
# This script formats the final answer based on the analysis of significant contributors
# to the observation of dual light/alpha chains in single-cell sequencing data.

# List of significant contributors for B cells
# (1) Doublets (technical)
# (2) Ambient RNA (technical)
# (3) True dual-functional light chains (allelic inclusion)
# (4) One light chain transcript not expressed as surface protein
# (5) One light chain is autoreactive (receptor editing)
b_cell_contributors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# List of significant contributors for T cells
# (1) Doublets (technical)
# (2) Ambient RNA (technical)
# (3) True dual-functional alpha chains (no allelic exclusion)
# (4) One alpha chain transcript not expressed as surface protein
# (6) One surface alpha chain is not fully functional
t_cell_contributors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]

# Format the lists into the required string format: (1,2,3), (4,5,6)
# The problem statement requires printing each number in the "final equation"
# which means constructing the string with all the chosen numbers.
