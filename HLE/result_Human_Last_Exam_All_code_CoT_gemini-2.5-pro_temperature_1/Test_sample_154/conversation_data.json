    "To find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices, we can follow a computational approach.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the search space:** We are looking for simple graphs with 5 vertices. A simple graph is undirected with no loops or multiple edges. The number of vertices is fixed at 5. The number of edges, `k`, can vary.\n2.  **Establish constraints:** For a graph with `n` vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must be connected and every vertex must have a degree of at least 2. This implies that the minimum number of edges is `n`. For our case (`n=5`), the number of edges `k` must be at least 5. The maximum number of edges is `C(5, 2) = 10`. So, we will check for graphs with 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 edges.\n3.  **Generate candidate graphs:** We will systematically generate all possible labeled graphs for each possible number of edges (`k` from 5 to 10).\n4.  **Filter for 2-vertex-connectivity:** For each generated graph, we will first check if it's connected. If it is, we will then test if it's 2-vertex-connected. A graph is 2-vertex-connected if it remains connected after the removal of any single vertex.\n5.  **Filter for non-isomorphic graphs:** Many of the generated graphs will be structurally identical (isomorphic). We need to count each unique structure only once. For each graph that passes the connectivity test, we will check if it is isomorphic to any of the unique graphs we have already found. If it's not, we add it to our list of unique graphs.\n6.  **Sum the results:** Finally, we will sum the counts of unique non-isomorphic graphs found for each number of edges to get the total.\n\nI will use the `networkx` library in Python to perform the graph generation and analysis, as it provides robust functions for these tasks. The code below implements this plan, printing the number of unique graphs for each edge count and then the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef count_2_connected_graphs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of 2-vertex-connected simple \n    non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 5\n    nodes = range(n)\n    possible_edges = list(combinations(nodes, 2))\n    num_possible_edges = len(possible_edges)\n\n    # Store non-isomorphic graphs found for each edge count\n    # Key: number of edges, Value: list of non-isomorphic graphs\n    found_graphs_by_edges = {}\n    \n    # For a graph with n vertices to be 2-connected, it must have at least n edges.\n    min_edges = n\n    max_edges = num_possible_edges\n\n    print(f\"Finding non-isomorphic 2-vertex-connected graphs with {n} vertices...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Loop through the number of edges k\n    for k in range(min_edges, max_edges + 1):\n        found_graphs_by_edges[k] = []\n        \n        # Generate all combinations of k edges on n vertices\n        for edges in combinations(possible_edges, k):\n            G = nx.Graph()\n            G.add_nodes_from(nodes)\n            G.add_edges_from(edges)\n\n            # A graph must be connected to be checked for 2-connectivity\n            if not nx.is_connected(G):\n                continue\n\n            # Check for 2-vertex-connectivity\n            if nx.is_k_vertex_connected(G, 2):\n                is_new_graph = True\n                # Check if this graph is isomorphic to any we've already found for this k\n                for h in found_graphs_by_edges[k]:\n                    if nx.is_isomorphic(G, h):\n                        is_new_graph = False\n                        break\n                \n                if is_new_graph:\n                    found_graphs_by_edges[k].append(G)\n\n    # Print the results and the final equation (the sum)\n    total_count = 0\n    equation_parts = []\n    \n    print(\"Breakdown by number of edges:\")\n    for k in sorted(found_graphs_by_edges.keys()):\n        count_k = len(found_graphs_by_edges[k])\n        if count_k > 0:\n            print(f\"Number of graphs with {k} edges: {count_k}\")\n            total_count += count_k\n            equation_parts.append(str(count_k))\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # This loop constructs the final output string showing each number in the sum\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"The total number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with {n} vertices is {total_count}.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    count_2_connected_graphs()\n\n```\n<<<8>>>"
