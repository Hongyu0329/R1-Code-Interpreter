# Step 1 & 2: Define the problem and identify the optimal graph structure.
# The problem translates to finding the maximum number of simple cycles in a
# planar, connected graph with 9 vertices and 16 edges. The wheel graph W_9
# (a central hub connected to 8 vertices on an outer rim) fits these
# parameters and is a strong candidate for maximizing cycles due to its
# symmetric structure.

# Step 3: Count the cycles in the W_9 graph.
# The graph has a central hub vertex and 8 vertices on the rim.

# Let's count the cycles based on their length (k).

# k=3: A 3-cycle (triangle) is formed by the hub and any two adjacent rim vertices.
# Since there are 8 edges on the rim, there are 8 such triangles.
c3_cycles = 8
print(f"Number of standoffs of 3 pirates (C3 cycles) = {c3_cycles}")

# k=4: A 4-cycle is formed by the hub and a path of 2 edges along the rim.
# There are 8 such paths of length 2 on the rim.
c4_cycles = 8
print(f"Number of standoffs of 4 pirates (C4 cycles) = {c4_cycles}")

# k=5: A 5-cycle is formed by the hub and a path of 3 edges along the rim.
# There are 8 such paths.
c5_cycles = 8
print(f"Number of standoffs of 5 pirates (C5 cycles) = {c5_cycles}")

# k=6: A 6-cycle is formed by the hub and a path of 4 edges along the rim.
# There are 8 such paths.
c6_cycles = 8
print(f"Number of standoffs of 6 pirates (C6 cycles) = {c6_cycles}")

# k=7: A 7-cycle is formed by the hub and a path of 5 edges along the rim.
# There are 8 such paths.
c7_cycles = 8
print(f"Number of standoffs of 7 pirates (C7 cycles) = {c7_cycles}")

# k=8: An 8-cycle can be formed in two ways:
# 1. With the hub and a path of 6 edges along the rim (8 such cycles).
# 2. The single cycle formed by the 8 rim vertices themselves.
c8_cycles_hub = 8
c8_cycles_rim = 1
c8_cycles = c8_cycles_hub + c8_cycles_rim
print(f"Number of standoffs of 8 pirates (C8 cycles) = {c8_cycles_hub} (hub-based) + {c8_cycles_rim} (rim) = {c8_cycles}")

# k=9: A 9-cycle is formed by the hub and a path of 7 edges along the rim.
# There are 8 such paths.
c9_cycles = 8
print(f"Number of standoffs of 9 pirates (C9 cycles) = {c9_cycles}")

# Step 4: Sum the counts for the total number of standoffs.
total_cycles = c3_cycles + c4_cycles + c5_cycles + c6_cycles + c7_cycles + c8_cycles + c9_cycles

print("\nThe final equation for the total number of standoffs is the sum of cycles of all lengths:")
print(f"{c3_cycles} + {c4_cycles} + {c5_cycles} + {c6_cycles} + {c7_cycles} + {c8_cycles} + {c9_cycles} = {total_cycles}")

print("\nThus, the maximum number of Mexican standoffs is 57.")
