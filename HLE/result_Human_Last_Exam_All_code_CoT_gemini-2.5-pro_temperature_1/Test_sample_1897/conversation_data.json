    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation for the closed-form expression of the infinite product, followed by a Python script to calculate its value.\n\n### Mathematical Derivation\n\nThe problem is to find a closed-form expression for the infinite product:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$\n\n1.  **Express the product using the q-Pochhammer symbol.**\n    Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n    $P = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$\n    This product is related to the full q-Pochhammer symbol $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k)$. We can split $\\phi(q)$ into products over even and odd powers of $q$:\n    $\\phi(q) = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k})\\right) \\left(\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})\\right) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P$\n    From this, we can express our product $P$ as a ratio of $\\phi$ functions:\n    $P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} = \\frac{\\phi(e^{-\\pi})}{\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})}$\n\n2.  **Relate the $\\phi$ function to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$.**\n    The Dedekind eta function is defined for $\\tau$ in the complex upper half-plane as:\n    $\\eta(\\tau) = q^{1/24} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^k) = q^{1/24} \\phi(q)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$.\n    This means $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$.\n    -   For the term $\\phi(e^{-\\pi})$, we have $q = e^{-\\pi}$. Equating this with $e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$, we get $2\\pi i \\tau = -\\pi$, which gives $\\tau = i/2$. So, $\\phi(e^{-\\pi}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i/2) = e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)$.\n    -   For the term $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi})$, we have $q = e^{-2\\pi}$. This gives $2\\pi i \\tau = -2\\pi$, so $\\tau = i$. So, $\\phi(e^{-2\\pi}) = (e^{-2\\pi})^{-1/24}\\eta(i) = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n\n3.  **Substitute these back into the expression for P.**\n    $P = \\frac{e^{\\pi/24}\\eta(i/2)}{e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)} = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n4.  **Simplify the ratio of eta functions using modular transformations.**\n    The eta function satisfies the transformation property $\\eta(-1/\\tau) = \\sqrt{-i\\tau}\\eta(\\tau)$. Let's use this to relate $\\eta(i/2)$ to a more convenient value. Let $\\tau=2i$:\n    $\\eta(-1/(2i)) = \\eta(i/2) = \\sqrt{-i(2i)}\\eta(2i) = \\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)$\n    Substituting this into our expression for P:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}\\eta(2i)}{\\eta(i)}$\n\n5.  **Relate the eta ratio to Weber's modular functions.**\n    The ratio is related to the Weber modular function $f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\eta(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$. Our ratio corresponds to $\\tau=i$, so we have:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_2(i)$\n\n6.  **Evaluate $f_2(i)$ using Ramanujan's class invariants.**\n    Ramanujan's class invariant $g_n$ is defined as $g_n = 2^{-1/4}f_2(i\\sqrt{n})$. For our case, $n=1$, so $g_1 = 2^{-1/4}f_2(i)$.\n    The value of $g_1$ is a known mathematical constant: $g_1 = 2^{-5/24}$.\n    We can now solve for $f_2(i)$:\n    $f_2(i) = 2^{1/4} g_1 = 2^{6/24} \\cdot 2^{-5/24} = 2^{1/24}$\n\n7.  **Find the final closed-form expression for P.**\n    Substituting the value of $f_2(i)$ back into the expression for P:\n    $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{1/24} = \\frac{2^{1/24}}{(e^\\pi)^{1/24}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{e^\\pi}\\right)^{1/24}$\n\n### Python Code\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the numerical value of this expression. The code will also print out the numbers used in the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The infinite product prod_{n=0 to inf}(1 - e^(-(2n+1)pi)) has been shown to\n# have the closed-form expression (2 / e^pi)^(1/24).\n# This script calculates the numerical value of this expression.\n\n# The final equation for the product P is: P = (A / e^B)^C\nA = 2\nB = np.pi\nC = 1/24\n\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is (2 / e^pi)^(1/24).\")\nprint(\"This can be written in the form: P = (A / e^B)^C\")\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers in this final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"A = {A}\")\nprint(f\"B = pi = {B}\")\nprint(f\"C = 1/24 = {C}\")\n\n# Calculate the final value\nresult = (A / np.exp(B))**C\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe numerical value of the expression is:\")\nprint(f\"P = ({A} / e^{B})^{C} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9029910300840856>>>"
