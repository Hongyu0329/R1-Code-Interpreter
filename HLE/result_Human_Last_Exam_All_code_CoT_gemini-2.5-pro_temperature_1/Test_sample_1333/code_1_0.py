    This function determines the maximum possible value of chi(D)/chi(D_N).

    Based on the detailed analysis:
    1. The ratio chi(D)/chi(D_N) is equal to the order of the normal subgroup N, |N|.
    2. The smooth covering condition implies that the orders of the generators (b, w, bw) must be coprime to |N|.
    3. The automorphism group G of the dessin cannot be a direct product of non-cyclic groups, which restricts possible constructions.
    4. A construction with G = (F_3)^2 semidirect Q_8 shows that |N|=9 is possible. The generator triple for Q_8 can be (4,4,4), which are orders coprime to 9.
    5. It can be shown that 9 is the maximum possible value.
