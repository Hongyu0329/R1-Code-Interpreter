    print("\n1. The machine model described is a variant of a Random Access Machine (RAM). It has registers, memory, and a set of instructions to manipulate them.")
    print("2. The instruction set is Turing-complete. The combination of arithmetic ('ADD'), universal logic ('BITWISENAND' is functionally complete), conditional control flow ('BRANCHIFZERO'), and memory access ('LOAD'/'STORE') allows the machine to perform any computation that a universal Turing machine can.")
    print("3. A function is 'boopable' if it can be computed by a program on this machine. Since the machine is Turing-complete, any program it runs can be simulated by a standard Turing machine.")
    print("4. By definition, a function that can be computed by a Turing machine is a Turing-computable function.")

    print("Question: Does there exist a program L of length <= 2^32+50 such that for all x in [0, 2^32), L on (64,64,512) maps x to x and halts in <= x+50 steps?")
    print("\n1. The time constraint is `Total Steps <= x + 50`. This means the `x` boops must take `x` steps, and all other overhead (setup, loops, jumps, cleanup) must take a constant maximum of 50 steps.")
    print("2. A simple loop structure, like `BOOP; DECREMENT; BRANCH`, takes multiple instructions per boop, leading to a total time of `k*x` where `k > 1`. This is too slow for large `x`.")
    print("3. The only viable strategy is to have a large, pre-written block of `2^32` `BOOP` instructions in memory. The program must then jump to a specific calculated address within this block to execute exactly `x` `BOOP`s before hitting a `HALT`.")
    print("4. This requires an 'indirect jump' (jumping to an address held in a register), which is not a native instruction. It must be simulated with self-modifying code.")
    print("5. Simulating an indirect jump involves creating a `BRANCHIFZERO` instruction at runtime. This requires calculating the target address and then placing it into the correct bit-field of a new instruction word.")
    print("6. Given the instruction format (`A=64`), placing the 64-bit address into its field requires a bit shift. For example, if the address field starts at bit 64, the address value must be shifted left by 64 positions.")
    print("7. The machine lacks a `SHIFT` or `MULTIPLY` instruction. A left shift by N must be simulated with N additions (`reg <- reg + reg`).")
    print("8. To construct the jump instruction, a left shift of the 64-bit address is needed. The final equation for the minimum number of steps for this operation is:")
    print("   Shift_Steps = Number of bits to shift")
    print("   Shift_Steps = 64")
    print("\n9. This single operation requires a minimum of 64 steps. The allowed overhead is 50 steps. The final comparison is:")
    print("   Required_Overhead_Steps >= 64")
    print("   Allowed_Overhead_Steps <= 50")
    print("   Since 64 > 50, the time constraint cannot be met.")
    print("\n10. Because the necessary overhead for the only viable algorithm is provably larger than the allowed overhead, no such program can exist.")
