# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with the given properties.
#
# Let the properties of X be:
# 1. X is a compact connected metric space.
# 2. For some n >= 2, the configuration space F_n(X) of n distinct points is disconnected.
#
# As explained in the reasoning:
# - Condition 2 is equivalent to F_2(X) being disconnected.
# - A theorem in topology states that a compact connected metric space X (with more than one point)
#   has a disconnected F_2(X) if and only if X is homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
#
# This means any space X that satisfies the conditions must be homeomorphic to [0, 1].
# All spaces homeomorphic to [0, 1] belong to the same homeomorphism class.
# Therefore, there is only one such class.

number_of_homeomorphism_classes = 1

# The final equation is simply the result of our deduction.
