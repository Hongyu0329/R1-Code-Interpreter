    "My plan is to first identify the two Nobel laureates from the specific Enron commercial mentioned. Then, I will write a Python script that stores their names in variables and prints the answer in a clear, formatted sentence. The script will also include the year 2000, as mentioned in the prompt, to satisfy the instruction of outputting the numbers involved.\n\n```python\ndef find_enron_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n    featured in a specific 2000 Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The two Nobel laureates in the commercial.\n    laureate_one = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate_two = \"Merton Miller\"\n    \n    # The year the commercial was released.\n    year = 2000\n\n    # Print the final answer, including the number from the original question.\n    print(f\"In the year {year}, the two Nobel laureates featured in the Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate_one}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate_two}\")\n\nfind_enron_laureates()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Merton Miller>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
