    "The RGD (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid) motif is a well-known sequence that mediates the binding of many extracellular matrix proteins to integrin receptors. All the provided peptide options contain this core RGD sequence.\n\nTherefore, the specificity and likelihood of binding are determined by the amino acids flanking the RGD motif. These flanking residues contribute to the proper conformation and interaction with specific integrin subtypes.\n\nOne of the most classic and well-studied examples of an RGD-containing sequence is from fibronectin, a major ligand for integrins like α5β1. The sequence in fibronectin is RGDSP. Synthetic peptides containing this RGDSP motif are frequently used in laboratory *in vitro* assays to study, and often inhibit, integrin-mediated cell adhesion.\n\nBy examining the choices, we can identify the one that contains this well-characterized sequence.\n\n```python\ndef identify_integrin_ligand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the most likely integrin-binding peptide from a list of choices\n    based on known biological motifs.\n    \"\"\"\n    peptides = {\n        'A': 'RGDMAA',\n        'B': 'RGDSPSS',\n        'C': 'RGDLTTP',\n        'D': 'RGDQVSK',\n        'E': 'RGDARGG'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the peptide choices to find the most likely integrin ligand:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"Core Motif: All peptides contain the 'RGD' sequence, the primary recognition site for many integrins.\")\n    print(\"Flanking Residues: The residues surrounding the RGD core are crucial for binding affinity and specificity.\")\n    print(\"Known Ligand Sequence: The sequence 'RGDSP' is derived from fibronectin, a major extracellular matrix protein and a well-characterized ligand for integrins like α5β1.\")\n    print(\"\\nEvaluating each choice against the known 'RGDSP' motif:\")\n\n    best_choice = None\n    best_peptide = \"\"\n\n    for choice, peptide in peptides.items():\n        if \"RGDSP\" in peptide:\n            print(f\"  - Choice {choice} ('{peptide}') contains the 'RGDSP' motif.\")\n            best_choice = choice\n            best_peptide = peptide\n        else:\n            print(f\"  - Choice {choice} ('{peptide}') does not contain the classic 'RGDSP' motif.\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: Peptide {best_peptide} (Choice {best_choice}) contains the well-studied RGDSP sequence from fibronectin and is therefore the most likely candidate to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay.\")\n\nidentify_integrin_ligand()\n```\n<<<B>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which of the following peptides has been found to bind or is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
