# The user wants me to identify if the Rust code will compile and why.
# My analysis identified a clear borrow-checker error and unused function warnings.

# 1. Identify the core issue.
# The error is in the `FeedForward::backward` method.
# The problematic line is:
# self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...);
# This line tries to borrow `self.w2` mutably (for `set`) and immutably (for `get`)
# at the same time, which is forbidden by Rust's borrowing rules.

# 2. Identify any other issues (warnings).
# The provided code includes `exp` and `ln` functions that are never used.
# The Rust compiler will generate "unused function" warnings for these.

# 3. Select the best answer choice.
# Choice A: "will compile with warnings" - Incorrect, it won't compile.
# Choice B: "will not compile due to an error" - Correct, but incomplete.
# Choice C: "will not compile due to an error and there will be warnings" - Correct and complete. This is the best answer.
# Choice D: "edge case" - Incorrect, this is a standard borrow checker error.
# Choice E: "compiler will crash" - Incorrect.
# Choice F: "will compile and it uses unsafe" - Incorrect, it won't compile.
# Choice G: "will compile without warnings" - Incorrect.
# Choice H: "platform specific" - Incorrect, this error is platform-independent.

# The final conclusion is that the code fails to compile and also has warnings.

# The final answer is C.
# The request asks me to "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!".
# This instruction doesn't apply here as there is no equation to solve.
# I will just print the final reasoning and the answer.

print("The Rust code will not compile.")
print("Reason for Error:")
print("In the `FeedForward::backward` method, lines like `self.w2.set(j, k, self.w2.get(j, k) - ...)` attempt to borrow `self.w2` both mutably (for the `.set()` call) and immutably (for the `.get()` call) in the same statement. This violates Rust's borrowing rules, which state that you cannot have a mutable borrow while an immutable borrow is active.")
print("\nReason for Warnings:")
print("The code defines helper functions `exp` and `ln`, but they are never called. The Rust compiler will issue 'unused function' warnings for them.")
