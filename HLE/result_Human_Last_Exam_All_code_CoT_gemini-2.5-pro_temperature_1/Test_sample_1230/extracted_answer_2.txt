Charles needs to first adjust his diet.

His current plan of limiting animal protein, fat, and carbohydrates all at the same time is extremely restrictive and likely unsustainable. This approach can lead to severe energy depletion, nutritional deficiencies, and difficulty adhering to the plan, which explains why he is "struggling."

A more balanced and sustainable approach would be to focus on the quality of macronutrients rather than their near-elimination. He should consider:
1.  **Incorporating Healthy Fats:** Adding sources like avocados, nuts, and olive oil is crucial for hormone function and satiety.
2.  **Choosing Complex Carbohydrates:** Opting for high-fiber, complex carbs from vegetables and legumes will provide sustained energy for his workouts and daily life.
3.  **Ensuring Adequate Protein:** Whether from lean animal or plant-based sources, sufficient protein is vital for maintaining muscle mass during weight loss.

By making his diet more balanced and less restrictive, Charles will have more energy, find it easier to make healthy choices while traveling, and be more likely to stick with his lifestyle change long-term to achieve his health goals.
