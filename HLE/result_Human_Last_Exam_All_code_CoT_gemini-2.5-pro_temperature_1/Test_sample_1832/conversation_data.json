    "To find the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body, we need to work with the Schwarzschild metric. The Christoffel symbols, denoted as $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$, describe the gravitational field and are derived from the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem using Python:\n1.  **Define the Metric**: I will start by defining the Schwarzschild metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ in spherical coordinates $(t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$. The metric components depend on the radial coordinate $r$ and the mass $M$ of the gravitating body. For simplicity, we will use geometrized units where the gravitational constant $G$ and the speed of light $c$ are set to 1.\n2.  **Use the Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated using the formula:\n    $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} (\\partial_\\mu g_{\\nu\\sigma} + \\partial_\\nu g_{\\mu\\sigma} - \\partial_\\sigma g_{\\mu\\nu})$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse of the metric tensor and $\\partial_\\mu$ denotes the partial derivative with respect to the coordinate $x^\\mu$.\n3.  **Automate with Python**: I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic calculations. This helps avoid manual errors. The code will:\n    a. Define the coordinates and the metric tensor as a symbolic matrix.\n    b. Calculate the inverse of the metric tensor.\n    c. Calculate the partial derivatives of the metric tensor components.\n    d. Implement the formula for the Christoffel symbols by iterating through all indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$.\n4.  **Count Non-Zero Symbols**: The code will check each calculated symbol. If it's not zero, it will be counted. Due to the symmetry $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$, I will only count the components where $\\mu \\le \\nu$ to find the number of unique, non-zero symbols.\n5.  **Display the Result**: The script will print each unique non-zero Christoffel symbol and its calculated expression. Finally, it will print the total count, broken down by the upper index, and the final sum.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the non-zero Christoffel symbols for the Schwarzschild metric.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define coordinates and parameters using sympy\n    # We use th and ph for theta and phi to avoid conflicts with sympy functions\n    coords = t, r, th, ph = sympy.symbols('t r \\\\theta \\\\phi')\n    M = sympy.Symbol('M')\n\n    # Schwarzschild radius in geometrized units (G=c=1)\n    rs = 2 * M\n\n    # Define the Schwarzschild metric tensor components\n    g_tt = -(1 - rs / r)\n    g_rr = 1 / (1 - rs / r)\n    g_thth = r**2\n    g_phph = r**2 * sympy.sin(th)**2\n\n    # Create the metric tensor as a 4x4 matrix\n    g = sympy.Matrix([\n        [g_tt, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, g_rr, 0, 0],\n        [0, 0, g_thth, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, g_phph]\n    ])\n\n    # Calculate the inverse of the metric tensor\n    g_inv = g.inv()\n    g_inv.simplify()\n\n    # Pre-calculate all partial derivatives of the metric tensor components\n    # dg[i][j][k] will store the derivative of g_{ij} with respect to the k-th coordinate\n    dg = [[[sympy.diff(g[i, j], k) for k in coords] for j in range(4)] for i in range(4)]\n\n    # Dictionary to store non-zero symbols, grouped by the upper index (rho)\n    non_zero_symbols = {}\n\n    # Iterate through all indices rho, mu, nu to calculate Gamma^rho_{mu,nu}\n    for rho in range(4):\n        non_zero_symbols[rho] = []\n        for mu in range(4):\n            # Due to symmetry Gamma^rho_{mu,nu} = Gamma^rho_{nu,mu}, we only calculate for mu <= nu\n            for nu in range(mu, 4):\n                gamma_sum = 0\n                # Sum over the index sigma\n                for sigma in range(4):\n                    term1 = dg[nu][sigma][mu]  # d(g_{nu,sigma}) / dx^mu\n                    term2 = dg[mu][sigma][nu]  # d(g_{mu,sigma}) / dx^nu\n                    term3 = dg[mu][nu][sigma]  # d(g_{mu,nu}) / dx^sigma\n                    gamma_sum += g_inv[rho, sigma] * (term1 + term2 - term3)\n\n                # The formula has a factor of 1/2\n                gamma = sympy.simplify(gamma_sum / 2)\n\n                if gamma != 0:\n                    # Store the non-zero symbol\n                    non_zero_symbols[rho].append((mu, nu, gamma))\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"The non-zero Christoffel symbols are:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    coord_names = ['t', 'r', '\\\\theta', '\\\\phi']\n    total_count = 0\n\n    for rho, symbols_list in non_zero_symbols.items():\n        if not symbols_list:\n            continue\n        for mu, nu, expr in symbols_list:\n            # Format the symbol name for printing\n            upper_idx = coord_names[rho]\n            lower_idx1 = coord_names[mu]\n            lower_idx2 = coord_names[nu]\n            print(f\"Gamma^{upper_idx}_{{{lower_idx1}{lower_idx2}}} = {expr}\")\n        total_count += len(symbols_list)\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    print(\"The final equation for the total number of unique non-zero symbols is:\")\n    count_per_rho = [len(non_zero_symbols.get(i, [])) for i in range(4)]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, count_per_rho))\n    print(f\"Total Symbols = {equation_str} = {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_christoffel_symbols()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
