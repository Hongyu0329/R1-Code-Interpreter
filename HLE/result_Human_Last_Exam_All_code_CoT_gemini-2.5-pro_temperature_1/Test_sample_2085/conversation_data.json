    "This is a linguistic and historical question rather than a computational one. To answer it, one must research the etymology of the name \"Odobeccus\" and its evolution into French. The name belonged to a 4th-century Frankish general, and French historical sources provide a clear equivalent.\n\nI will write a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the French equivalent of the Gaulish name \"Odobeccus\".\n    \n    The name \"Odobeccus\" is the Latinized form of the name of a 4th-century Frankish general.\n    In French historical contexts, his name is most commonly rendered as \"Édobich\".\n    This script will print this equivalent.\n    \"\"\"\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n    french_equivalent = \"Édobich\"\n    \n    print(f\"The French equivalent of the name '{gaulish_name}' is '{french_equivalent}'.\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Édobich>>>"
