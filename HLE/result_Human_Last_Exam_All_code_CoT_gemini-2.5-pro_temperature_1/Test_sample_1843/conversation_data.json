    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Decomposition**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n2.  **Order**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters $\\chi_i$.\n3.  **Factorization**: First, I will find the prime factorization of $N = 36036$.\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = 4 \\times 9 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 7 \\times 11 \\times 13$.\n4.  **Component Analysis**: For each prime power factor $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$, I will determine the number of primitive characters whose orders are divisors of 6. The number of characters of a specific order $k$ for a cyclic group of characters is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$.\n    *   For $m=4=2^2$: Determine the orders of primitive characters and count those dividing 6.\n    *   For $m=9=3^2$: Determine the orders of primitive characters and count those dividing 6.\n    *   For $m=7, 11, 13$: For a prime modulus $p$, all non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of $\\phi(p) = p-1$, excluding 1. I will count how many of these orders divide 6.\n5.  **Combination**: The total number of characters of order 6 is the product of the number of choices for each component character. I will multiply the counts from the previous step.\n6.  **Verification**: I will verify that any character constructed this way has an order of exactly 6. This means the lcm of the component orders must be 6. This requires the lcm to be a multiple of both 2 and 3, and also a divisor of 6. My analysis will show that these conditions are always met by the selected components.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef solve_and_print():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem and prints the detailed steps and final answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    order = 6\n    \n    print(f\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of N\n    factors = [4, 9, 7, 11, 13]\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of N is 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13.\")\n    print(\"A primitive character chi of conductor N can be written as a product:\")\n    print(\"chi = chi_4 * chi_9 * chi_7 * chi_11 * chi_13, where each chi_m is a primitive character modulo m.\")\n    print(f\"The order of chi, lcm(ord(chi_4), ..., ord(chi_13)), must be {order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(f\"Step 2: For each modulus, find the number of primitive characters whose order divides {order}.\")\n\n    # Modulo 4\n    count_4 = phi(2)\n    print(\"\\nFor modulus 4 (2^2):\")\n    print(\"  - Primitive characters mod 4 must have order 2.\")\n    print(\"  - The order 2 divides the required order 6.\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of such characters = phi(2) = {count_4}\")\n    \n    # Modulo 9\n    count_9 = phi(3) + phi(6)\n    print(\"\\nFor modulus 9 (3^2):\")\n    print(\"  - Primitive characters mod 9 must have order 3 or 6.\")\n    print(\"  - Both orders 3 and 6 divide the required order 6.\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of such characters = phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {count_9}\")\n\n    # Modulo 7\n    count_7 = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\n    print(\"\\nFor modulus 7:\")\n    print(\"  - Primitive characters mod 7 have orders 2, 3, or 6.\")\n    print(\"  - All these orders divide the required order 6.\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of such characters = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {count_7}\")\n    \n    # Modulo 11\n    count_11 = phi(2)\n    print(\"\\nFor modulus 11:\")\n    print(\"  - Primitive characters mod 11 have orders 2, 5, or 10.\")\n    print(\"  - Of these, only order 2 divides the required order 6.\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of such characters = phi(2) = {phi(2)}\")\n\n    # Modulo 13\n    count_13 = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6)\n    print(\"\\nFor modulus 13:\")\n    print(\"  - Primitive characters mod 13 have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12.\")\n    print(\"  - Of these, orders 2, 3, and 6 divide the required order 6.\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of such characters = phi(2) + phi(3) + phi(6) = {phi(2)} + {phi(3)} + {phi(6)} = {count_13}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the total number and verify the order\n    total_count = count_4 * count_9 * count_7 * count_11 * count_13\n    print(\"Step 3: The total number is the product of the counts for each modulus.\")\n    print(\"We must confirm the resulting character's order is exactly 6.\")\n    print(\"  - The order is a divisor of 6 because all component orders divide 6.\")\n    print(\"  - The order is a multiple of 2 because the component from mod 4 has order 2.\")\n    print(\"  - The order is a multiple of 3 because the component from mod 9 has order 3 or 6.\")\n    print(\"An integer that is a multiple of 6 and a divisor of 6 must be exactly 6.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    \n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    print(\"The number of primitive characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is:\")\n    print(f\"{count_4} (from mod 4) * {count_9} (from mod 9) * {count_7} (from mod 7) * {count_11} (from mod 11) * {count_13} (from mod 13) = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_and_print()\n```\n<<<100>>>"
