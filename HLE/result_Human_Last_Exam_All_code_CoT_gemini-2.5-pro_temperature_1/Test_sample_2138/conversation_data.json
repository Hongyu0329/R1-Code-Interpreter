    "An analytical solution to this integral is a challenging task that typically involves advanced mathematical functions. The integral as stated involves the square root of a negative number over the integration domain, which implies the result is a complex number.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** The term $\\sqrt{x \\log(x)}$ is purely imaginary for $x \\in (0, 1)$ because $\\log(x)$ is negative in this interval. We can write $\\sqrt{\\log(x)} = i\\sqrt{-\\log(x)} = i\\sqrt{\\log(1/x)}$. This makes the entire integrand, and thus the integral, a purely imaginary number.\n2.  **Assume a typo for a real-valued integral:** It is a common occurrence in such problems that a typo exists. A plausible assumption is that the intended integrand was real. This can be achieved by replacing $\\log(x)$ with $\\log(1/x)$ inside the square root and the cosine argument. The modified integral, which we'll call $I_{mod}$, is:\n    $$I_{mod} = \\int_0^1 \\frac{4 \\sqrt{x \\log (1/x)} \\cos \\left(\\frac{2 \\log (1/x)}{3}\\right)}{1-x} \\, dx$$\n    The original integral would then be $I = i \\cdot I_{mod}$.\n3.  **Simplify the modified integral:** We use the substitution $u = \\log(1/x)$, which means $x = e^{-u}$ and $dx = -e^{-u} du$. The limits of integration change from $[0, 1]$ to $[\\infty, 0]$.\n    The integral becomes:\n    $$I_{mod} = \\int_\\infty^0 \\frac{4 \\sqrt{e^{-u} u} \\cos(2u/3)}{1-e^{-u}} (-e^{-u}) du = 4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-u/2} \\sqrt{u} \\cos(2u/3) e^{-u}}{1-e^{-u}} du$$\n    $$I_{mod} = 4 \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{u^{1/2} e^{-3u/2} \\cos(2u/3)}{1-e^{-u}} du$$\n4.  **Express using a series:** We use the geometric series expansion $\\frac{1}{1-e^{-u}} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} e^{-nu}$.\n    $$I_{mod} = 4 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\int_0^\\infty u^{1/2} e^{-(n+3/2)u} \\cos(2u/3) du$$\n5.  **Evaluate the inner integral:** The integral is of a known form, which can be evaluated using the Gamma function. The result is:\n    $$ \\int_0^\\infty t^b e^{-at} \\cos(ct) dt = \\text{Re}\\left(\\frac{\\Gamma(b+1)}{(a-ic)^{b+1}}\\right) = \\Gamma(b+1)(a^2+c^2)^{-\\frac{b+1}{2}}\\cos\\left((b+1)\\arctan\\frac{c}{a}\\right) $$\n    In our case, for each term in the series, $b=1/2$, $a=n+3/2$, and $c=2/3$.\n6.  **The Analytical Form:** The sum is difficult to evaluate in terms of elementary functions. It can be expressed using the Hurwitz Zeta function $\\zeta(s, q) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (n+q)^{-s}$ as:\n    $$I_{mod} = 2\\sqrt{\\pi} \\cdot \\text{Re}\\left[\\zeta\\left(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{2}{3}i\\right)\\right]$$\n    This expression does not simplify further to elementary constants.\n7.  **Numerical Calculation:** Since a specific value is requested, and the analytical form is complex, we will compute the value of the modified integral numerically. I will write a Python script to do this. The final equation will show the value of this definite integral.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef integrand(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    The integrand of the modified definite integral.\n    This version assumes the typo fix to make the integrand real.\n    \"\"\"\n    if x == 0 or x == 1:\n        # The limit of the integrand is 0 at both ends.\n        return 0.0\n    \n    log_one_over_x = np.log(1/x)\n    \n    numerator = 4 * np.sqrt(x * log_one_over_x) * np.cos(2/3 * log_one_over_x)\n    denominator = 1 - x\n    \n    return numerator / denominator\n\n# Calculate the definite integral from 0 to 1\nintegral_value, error = quad(integrand, 0, 1)\n\n# The problem asks for the analytical value of the original integral.\n# Based on our analysis, the original integral I is equal to i * I_mod.\n# We will present the equation for the modified, real-valued integral I_mod.\n# The value is purely numerical as the analytical form is not elementary.\n\nprint(f\"The integral is assumed to be modified for a real value:\")\nprint(f\"∫_0^1 (4 * sqrt(x*log(1/x)) * cos(2/3*log(1/x))) / (1-x) dx = {integral_value}\")\n\n# The original integral is i times this value.
