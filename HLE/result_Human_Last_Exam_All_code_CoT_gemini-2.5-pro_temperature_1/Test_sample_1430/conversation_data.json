    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Formula:** The rank of the Néron-Severi group (also known as the Picard number, denoted by $\\rho$) of the $d$-th symmetric power of a curve $C$, $X = C^{(d)}$, is related to the rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian variety, $J(C)$. For a curve of genus $g$ and $d \\ge g$, the formula is:\n    \n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n\n2.  **Analyze the Given Parameters:** We are given:\n    *   Genus of the curve, $g = 3$.\n    *   The symmetric power, $d = 15$.\n    *   Since $d=15 \\ge g=3$, the formula above is applicable.\n\n3.  **Find the Minimum Possible Rank of $\\rho(J(C))$:** The rank $\\rho(J(C))$ depends on the specific curve $C$. For a *general* (or generic) curve of genus $g$, its Jacobian has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms. In this case, the Néron-Severi group is generated solely by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), and its rank is 1.\n    *   $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum Possible Rank of $\\rho(J(C))$:** The maximum rank occurs for special curves whose Jacobians have Complex Multiplication (CM). For a curve of genus $g$, the maximum possible rank of the Néron-Severi group of its Jacobian is $g^2$. This is achieved when the Jacobian is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of a CM elliptic curve. Such curves exist for any genus.\n    *   For $g=3$, $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = g^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Smallest and Largest Ranks for X:** Using the formula from Step 1, we can now calculate the minimum and maximum possible ranks for $X = C^{(15)}$.\n    *   **Smallest Rank:** $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   **Largest Rank:** $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a script to perform these calculations and print the results clearly.\n\nHere is the Python code to carry out the calculation.\n\n```python\n# Define the genus of the Riemann surface C.\ng = 3\n\n# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power X = C^(15)\n# is given by the formula: rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1,\n# where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.\n# We need to find the smallest and largest possible values for rho(J(C)).\n\n# Smallest rank for rho(J(C)):\n# This occurs for a generic curve, where the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian\n# is of rank 1.\nrho_J_min = 1\n\n# Largest rank for rho(J(C)):\n# This occurs for a special curve with maximal complex multiplication.\n# The maximum possible rank for the Jacobian of a genus g curve is g^2.\nrho_J_max = g**2\n\n# Calculate the smallest rank for X = C^(15)\nrho_X_min = rho_J_min + 1\n\n# Calculate the largest rank for X = C^(15)\nrho_X_max = rho_J_max + 1\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"For a genus 3 Riemann surface C and X its 15th symmetric power:\")\nprint(f\"The genus g is {g}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of X is rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Smallest Possible Rank ---\")\nprint(f\"The minimum rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, rho_min(J(C)), is {rho_J_min}.\")\nprint(f\"So, the smallest possible rank for X is {rho_J_min} + 1 = {rho_X_min}.\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Largest Possible Rank ---\")\nprint(f\"The maximum rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian, rho_max(J(C)), is g^2 = {g}^2 = {rho_J_max}.\")\nprint(f\"So, the largest possible rank for X is {rho_J_max} + 1 = {rho_X_max}.\")\n\n```\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest is 10.>>>"
