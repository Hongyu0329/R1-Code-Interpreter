# The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the 15th symmetric power X = C^(15)
# is given by the formula: rho(X) = rho(J(C)) + 1,
# where J(C) is the Jacobian of C.
# We need to find the smallest and largest possible values for rho(J(C)).

# Smallest rank for rho(J(C)):
# This occurs for a generic curve, where the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian
# is of rank 1.

# Largest rank for rho(J(C)):
# This occurs for a special curve with maximal complex multiplication.
# The maximum possible rank for the Jacobian of a genus g curve is g^2.
