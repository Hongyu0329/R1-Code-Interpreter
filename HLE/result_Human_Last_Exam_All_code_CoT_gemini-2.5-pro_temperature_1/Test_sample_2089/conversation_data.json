    "My plan is to identify the specific movie scene described by the user. The key elements are: an Oscar-nominated film, a character boarding a bus, the character saying \"Thank you,\" and this act sealing the character's fate. This detailed sequence points to a pivotal scene in a specific film. I will write a Python script that prints the name of this film.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_by_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the movie based on a specific scene description.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Munich\"\n    character_name = \"Louis\"\n    action_description = \"boarding a bus and mouthing 'Thank you' to his father\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Oscar-nominated film in which a character seals his fate by saying 'Thank you' while boarding a bus is '{movie_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"The character, {character_name}, reveals his betrayal with this action, leading to his eventual demise.\")\n\nfind_movie_by_scene()\n```\n<<<Munich>>>"
