# The user wants to troubleshoot an enzyme kinetics assay.
# The problem is a non-linear Product vs. Time plot.
# Key information:
# 1. The enzyme is an obligate dimer (must be in a complex of two to be active).
# 2. The assay is chilled on ice (0-4Â°C) before measurement.
# 3. The reason for the non-linearity is "not immediately obvious".

# Analysis:
# Chilling multimeric enzymes can cause them to dissociate into inactive monomers (cold lability).
# When the assay is warmed to the reaction temperature, these monomers must re-associate.
# This re-association takes time, causing a "lag phase" where the reaction rate increases over time.
# This results in an upward-curving (concave up) plot, which is a form of non-linearity.
# This is a less common ("not immediately obvious") issue than substrate depletion (downward curve).

# How to fix a lag phase caused by slow subunit association?
# We need to speed up the reaction: Monomer + Monomer -> Dimer (Active).
# The rate of most chemical reactions, including protein association, increases with temperature.

# Let's evaluate the choices:
# A. Increase temperature: This will increase the rate of dimer formation, shortening the lag phase. This is a good solution.
# B. Decrease temperature: This will slow down dimer formation, making the lag phase worse.
# C. Increase Enzyme Concentration: This could increase the rate of dimerization due to mass action, but it's an indirect fix and risks causing substrate depletion.
# D. Decrease Enzyme Concentration: This is the fix for substrate depletion (downward curve), not a lag phase. It would slow dimerization and make the lag phase worse.

# The best choice is A.
