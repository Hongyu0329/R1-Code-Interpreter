    "To determine which animal might be able to hear human muscle twitches, we need to compare the sound produced by muscle twitches with the hearing capabilities of each animal.\n\n**My Plan:**\n1.  **Define the Sound Source:** Human muscle twitches produce very low-frequency, low-amplitude sounds, often in the infrasound range (below 20 Hz) but with components up to around 100 Hz. I will use a representative frequency of 25 Hz for this analysis.\n2.  **Gather Animal Hearing Data:** I will compile a dataset of the approximate hearing ranges for each animal listed, paying special attention to any unique sensitivities at low frequencies.\n3.  **Create a Programmatic Comparison:** I will write a Python script that iterates through this data. For each animal, the script will print its hearing range and then check if the muscle twitch frequency falls within it. This check will serve as our \"equation\".\n4.  **Draw a Conclusion:** Based on the data and the comparison, the script will highlight the animal with the most suitable hearing characteristics. The key factor is not just the frequency range but also specialized sensitivity to faint, low-frequency sounds.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_animal_hearing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which animal is most likely to hear a faint, low-frequency\n    sound like a human muscle twitch.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the sound of a human muscle twitch.\n    # It's a very low-amplitude sound, with a very low frequency.\n    # We'll use a representative frequency for our comparison equation.\n    muscle_twitch_frequency = 25  # in Hz\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the ability to hear a human muscle twitch (approx. {muscle_twitch_frequency} Hz).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define a database of animal hearing capabilities.\n    # The 'note' contains the most critical information about sensitivity.\n    animal_hearing_data = {\n        'A.
