def solve_euclidean_relativity():
    """
    Analyzes and presents the consequences of a hypothetical
    theory of relativity based on a Euclidean spacetime metric.

    The standard theory of relativity is based on a Minkowski spacetime where the
    invariant interval is s^2 = (ct)^2 - x^2. The transformations that preserve
    this are the Lorentz transformations.

    In this alternative theory, spacetime is Euclidean, and the invariant interval
    is s^2 = (ct)^2 + x^2. The transformations that preserve this are 4D rotations.
    For a relative velocity 'v' along the x-axis, these transformations are:

    t' = gamma_E * (t + v*x/c^2)
    x' = gamma_E * (x - v*t)

    where the Euclidean gamma factor is gamma_E = 1 / sqrt(1 + (v/c)^2).

    This script analyzes the consequences based on these different transformation rules.
