    "My plan is to address your question about boron nanosheets and Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) by creating a Python script. Since the question requires a scientific explanation rather than a numerical calculation, the script will not perform calculations but will instead print out a step-by-step explanation of the underlying physics. This approach allows me to provide a detailed answer while adhering to your request for a code-based solution.\n\nHere is the plan for the script:\n1.  **Define SPDC:** The script will first explain what SPDC is and its fundamental requirements.\n2.  **Key Material Property:** It will clarify that the key property for SPDC is a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which is only present in materials that lack inversion symmetry (non-centrosymmetric materials).\n3.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets:** The script will then discuss boron nanosheets, noting that they exist in various crystal structures, or polymorphs. Some of these structures have inversion symmetry, while others do not.\n4.  **Formulate the Condition:** To satisfy the instruction about outputting an equation, the script will print a symbolic conditional equation representing the requirement for SPDC in borophene.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The script will conclude that SPDC is expected only in those specific boron nanosheet structures that are non-centrosymmetric.\n\nThis script will provide a comprehensive answer to your question in an educational format, while following the specified output structure.\n\n```python\ndef explain_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program explains the conditions under which boron nanosheets\n    might exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\")\n    print(\"SPDC is a nonlinear optical process where a high-energy 'pump' photon, passing through a suitable medium, splits into two lower-energy photons called 'signal' and 'idler'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Core Requirement for SPDC\")\n    print(\"The primary requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\")\n    print(\"For χ⁽²⁾ to be non-zero, the material's crystal structure must lack a center of inversion symmetry (it must be non-centrosymmetric).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)\")\n    print(\"Boron nanosheets can exist in many different atomic arrangements, known as polymorphs.\")\n    print(\" - Centrosymmetric Polymorphs: Some borophene structures (like the common β₁₂ sheet) possess inversion symmetry.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    When excited by incident light, would free-standing boron nanosheets be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
