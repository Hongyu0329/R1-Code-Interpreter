# Step 1: Define the conclusion for each capability based on the analysis.
# I. Goal-driven locomotion is needed to choose a path (cliff) and to maintain balance (room).
capability_I = "both"

# II. An MST analogue processes optic flow, which is the core illusion of the swinging room.
capability_II = "room"

# III. Relative size of pattern elements is a key monocular depth cue for the visual cliff.
capability_III = "cliff"

# IV. Binocular disparity is a key binocular depth cue for the visual cliff.
capability_IV = "cliff"

# V. Posture control is the system affected and measured in the swinging room experiment.
capability_V = "room"

# Step 2: Combine the answers into the required hyphen-separated format.
final_answer_list = [
    capability_I,
    capability_II,
    capability_III,
    capability_IV,
    capability_V
]
final_answer_string = "-".join(final_answer_list)

# Step 3: Print the final result.
print(final_answer_string)
