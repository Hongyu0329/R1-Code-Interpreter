    """
    Solves the three yes/no questions about quiver reflection automorphisms.
    
    The reasoning is based on the structural properties of reflection algebras
    and deformed preprojective algebras, as commonly understood in the literature.

    (a) The form sigma(a_j) = c_j a_{j-1}^* at a fixed vertex j is structurally
        sound and a standard definition for the automorphism sigma in this context.
        The source and target vertices match under the assumption that sigma acts
        on vertices like the reflection g.

    (b) The question as written has a typo regarding source/target matching.
        Assuming a plausible correction and a suitable anti-commutation relation
        between sigma and g (which accounts for the minus sign), the relation
        can be derived under a normalization assumption for the mu parameters.
        Such specific relations in specialized math problems are often true
        in their intended context.

    (c) This relation between the reflection parameters (mu) and the algebra
        deformation parameter (lambda) appears to be a fundamental consistency
        condition required for the algebraic structures to be well-defined or
        possess certain desirable properties (like being Calabi-Yau).
