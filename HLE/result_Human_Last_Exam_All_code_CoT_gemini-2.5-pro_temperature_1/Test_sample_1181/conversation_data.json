    "My plan is to solve this movie trivia question. I will first identify the correct character from the 1972 film *Solaris* who expresses the specific sentiment mentioned. The question is about which character is \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\" This line of dialogue is a key moment that reveals a character's deep nostalgia and psychological state. By recalling the plot and character arcs, I can pinpoint who said this. The character is the protagonist, Kris Kelvin, who reflects on how he took the simple beauties of Earth for granted. I will then create a Python script to present this information and print the final answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the correct character for the trivia question\n    and prints the answer with an explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"In the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie Solaris which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\"\n    \n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    correct_choice_letter = 'A'\n    correct_choice_name = answer_choices[correct_choice_letter]\n\n    explanation = (\n        \"In the film, the protagonist Kris Kelvin expresses this feeling. \"\n        \"Overwhelmed by the sterile environment of the space station and the psychological phenomena \"\n        \"he is experiencing, he feels a deep, nostalgic longing for Earth. He confesses that he is \"\n        \"ashamed that he only now, when it's gone, truly misses a simple, natural sound like the rustling of leaves.\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The correct character is: {correct_choice_name}\")\n    print(f\"Explanation: {explanation}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"Final Answer Choice: {correct_choice_letter}\")\n\nsolve_solaris_trivia()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
