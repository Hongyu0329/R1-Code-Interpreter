# Analysis of Virtual Table Loads

A "perfectly optimizing" compiler will use an optimization called devirtualization whenever possible. This means if the compiler can determine the exact type of an object at compile-time, it will convert a virtual function call into a direct function call, avoiding the virtual table lookup entirely.

### Call 1: `a->foo()` after `new A()`
- The compiler sees `a` is created as a `new A()`.
- The exact type of the object is known to be `A`.
- The call is devirtualized to a direct call to `A::foo()`.
- Number of vtable loads: {call_1_loads}

### Call 2: `a->foo()` after `escape(a)`
- The function `escape(a)` is a black box. The compiler must assume the dynamic type of `*a` could have changed.
- The type is now unknown, so a true virtual dispatch is necessary.
- This requires loading the virtual table pointer from the object instance.
- Number of vtable loads: {call_2_loads}

### Call 3: `b->foo()` after `new(a) B`
- The compiler sees that a `B` object is constructed via placement new and assigned to `b`.
- The exact type of the object pointed to by `b` is known to be `B`.
- The call is devirtualized to a direct call to `B::foo()`.
- Number of vtable loads: {call_3_loads}

# Total
The total number of required virtual table loads is the sum of the loads for each call.
Equation: {call_1_loads} + {call_2_loads} + {call_3_loads} = {total_loads}
