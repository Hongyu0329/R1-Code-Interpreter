    This function demonstrates the logic for finding the largest possible value of d.

    The problem states that for any n, the points {a_1, ..., a_n} partition
    the interval [0, d] into segments of length at most 1/n.

    Let's analyze this for a given n:
    1. The points {0, d, a_1, ..., a_n} define a set of segments that cover [0, d].
    2. The number of these segments is at most n+1 (it can be less if some a_i are duplicates or endpoints).
    3. The sum of the lengths of these segments is exactly d.
    4. The length of each segment is at most 1/n.
    5. Therefore, d = (sum of segment lengths) <= (number of segments) * (max length).
    6. This gives the inequality: d <= (n+1) * (1/n) = (n+1)/n.

    This inequality must hold for ALL n = 1, 2, 3, ...
    The following code shows that as n increases, this upper bound for d gets closer and closer to 1.
