The question is whether a program P exists that can compute def_superfast(10000).
The answer is no, and this can be proven with a logical argument.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1.  **The Assumption:**
    Let's assume for a moment that such a program, `P`, does exist. This program `P` can take the integer 10000 and correctly compute `def_superfast(10000)`.

2.  **Constructing a Paradoxical Program:**
    We can then write a new Python program, let's call it `paradox_program`. This program's only job is to run `P(10000)` and return its result. We can construct this `paradox_program` so its source code is less than 10000 characters long.

3.  **Analyzing the Output:**
    By definition, `def_superfast(10000)` returns `Huge_int + 1`.
    `Huge_int` is the largest integer returned by any Python program shorter than 10000 characters.
    So, our `paradox_program` returns the integer value `Huge_int + 1`.

4.  **The Contradiction:**
    - Our `paradox_program` is itself a Python program shorter than 10000 characters.
    - It returns an integer.
    - Therefore, `paradox_program` is one of the programs that must be considered when finding `Huge_int`.
    - This means the value returned by `paradox_program` must be less than or equal to `Huge_int`.

5.  **The Impossible Final Equation:**
    This brings us to a logical contradiction. We have two conflicting facts:
    - Fact A: The value returned by `paradox_program` is `Huge_int + 1`.
    - Fact B: The value returned by `paradox_program` must be `<=` `Huge_int`.

    This requires the following equation to be true:
    Huge_int + 1 <= Huge_int

    This statement is a mathematical impossibility.

**Conclusion:**
Because our initial assumption (that program `P` exists) leads to a logical contradiction, the assumption must be false. It is impossible to write a program that computes `def_superfast(10000)`.
