    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem, followed by the Python code to execute the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **State the Goal:** The aim is to find the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible when considered modulo $p$.\n\n2.  **Introduce the Method:** According to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, this density is equal to the proportion of elements in the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over the rational numbers that act as a single 7-cycle on the polynomial's roots.\n\n3.  **Strategy to find the Galois Group G:** To find this proportion, we first need to identify the Galois group $G$. Since the polynomial has degree 7 and is irreducible (which we will verify), $G$ is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_7$. We can pinpoint the exact group by examining its properties:\n    *   **Discriminant:** We will compute the discriminant of the polynomial. A standard theorem states that the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_7$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square.\n    *   **Factorization Modulo Primes:** We will factor the polynomial modulo various primes $p$. The degrees of the irreducible factors of $f(x) \\pmod p$ correspond to the cycle structure of an element in $G$ (the Frobenius element at $p$). By finding different cycle structures, we can eliminate potential candidate groups for $G$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Once $G$ is identified (we will show it is $S_7$), we will calculate the proportion of 7-cycles within this group. This proportion will be our desired density. The number of 7-cycles in $S_7$ is $(7-1)!$, and the total size of $S_7$ is $7!$. The density is the ratio of these two numbers.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_factor_degrees(poly_expr, p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to get the degrees of irreducible factors of a polynomial modulo p.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    # Convert the expression to a Poly object to use the factor_list method\n    poly_obj = sympy.Poly(poly_expr, x)\n    # Factor the polynomial over the finite field GF(p)\n    # The result is a list of (factor_poly, exponent) tuples\n    try:\n        _, factors = poly_obj.factor_list(modulus=p)\n        degrees = []\n        for factor_poly, exp in factors:\n            # The degree of the factor is added 'exp' times to the list\n            degrees.extend([factor_poly.degree()] * exp)\n        return sorted(degrees)\n    except Exception as e:\n        return f\"Error factoring modulo {p}: {e}\"\n\ndef solve_polynomial_density():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the natural density of primes p where f(x) is irreducible mod p.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the polynomial and analyze its basic properties.\")\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f = x**7 - 14*x**5 + 56*x**3 - 56*x + 22\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = {f}\")\n\n    # Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers Q.\n    # SymPy's factor_list returns a list with one factor of exponent 1 if irreducible.\n    if len(sympy.factor_list(f)[1]) == 1 and sympy.factor_list(f)[1][0][1] == 1:\n        print(\"The polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"The polynomial is reducible.
