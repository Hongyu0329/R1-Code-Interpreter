# The problem asks for the equation in the final response.
# The growth rate is c_n = Theta(alpha^n)
# We found alpha = sqrt(2).
# The equation for the growth rate is:
# c_n = Theta((sqrt(2))^n)
# Let's output the numbers in the final equation.
# The base is sqrt(2).
base_number = math.sqrt(2)
# The exponent is n. We can't output a variable, so we'll just describe it.
