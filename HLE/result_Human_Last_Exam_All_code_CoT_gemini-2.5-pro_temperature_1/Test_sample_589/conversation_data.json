    "This is a fun movie trivia question! The scene you're describing is quite memorable. My plan is to identify the movie and the specific scene that matches your description and then provide a simple python script to print the answer.\n\nThe film you are referring to is the 2017 horror film **\"It,\"** based on the Stephen King novel.\n\n1.  **Teenager:** The scene features Beverly Marsh, one of the members of the \"Losers' Club.\"\n2.  **Pink Bike:** She rides a reddish-pink Huffy bicycle.\n3.  **Pedals toward an oncoming car:** In a memorable act of defiance, she plays a game of chicken with the bullies (Henry Bowers' gang) in their Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, pedaling directly at them until they swerve away.\n4.  **Major Film Studio:** The film was produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a major studio.\n\nHere is a Python script to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the movie based on the user's description.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"It\"\n    movie_year = 2017\n    \n    # The movie is \"It\" (2017).\n    # In the film, the character Beverly Marsh, a teenager,\n    # rides her pinkish-red bike directly toward a car\n    # driven by the film's bullies.\n    \n    print(f\"The Hollywood feature film is: {movie_title} ({movie_year})\")\n\nfind_movie()\n```\n<<<It (2017)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Hollywood feature film produced by a major film studio does a teenager ride a pink bike and pedal directly toward an oncoming car?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
