The pharmacist could recommend that Allison avoid taking Excedrin for her headaches. Combining the aspirin (an NSAID) in Excedrin with her prescription for Fluoxetine 20mg (an SSRI) increases the risk of stomach bleeding. A safer alternative for pain relief would be acetaminophen (Tylenol). Additionally, she should be counseled that headaches can be a side effect of Fluoxetine and to contact her doctor if they persist.
