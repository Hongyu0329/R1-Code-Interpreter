    Analyzes the provided options to find the best solution for mitigating
    DNS AitM attacks, considering the challenge of untrusted systems due to
    potential low-level compromises.

    The analysis shows that most options are either impractical, irrelevant, or
    fail to address the root cause. Option G, "Secure Blockchain Software
    Update Mechanism," is the only one that tackles the foundational problem of
    system integrity. By securing the software supply chain, it establishes
    a root of trust, making other cryptographic defenses reliable. This directly
    addresses the core challenge of overcoming vulnerabilities in untrusted systems.
