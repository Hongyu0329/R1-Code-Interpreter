    This script calculates the maximal probability p for Alice's success.

    The optimal strategy for Alice is to open 19 of the 20 boxes at random.
    This is equivalent to selecting one box at random to remain closed.
    Let the sorted values in the 20 boxes be y_1, y_2, ..., y_20.
    The number 'u' in the closed box is any of these 20 values with equal probability.

    Alice observes the other 19 numbers. Let the minimum and maximum of these
    observed numbers be v_min and v_max. Her guess for 'u' is the interval [v_min, v_max].

    She loses if 'u' is outside this interval. This happens in two cases:
    1. The number 'u' is the absolute minimum of all 20 numbers (y_1).
       In this case, the numbers she observes are {y_2, ..., y_20}, so v_min = y_2.
       Her guess fails because u = y_1 < v_min. The probability of this is 1/20.
    2. The number 'u' is the absolute maximum of all 20 numbers (y_20).
       In this case, the numbers she observes are {y_1, ..., y_{19}}, so v_max = y_{19}.
       Her guess fails because u = y_20 > v_max. The probability of this is 1/20.

    In all other 18 cases, she wins. The total probability of success is 1 minus the
    probability of failure.
