    print("   1. Information: Buyers are often motivated by strong positive information, while sellers have mixed motives (profit-taking, liquidity needs), making buy orders a stronger positive signal on average.")
    print("   2. Constraints: It is much easier to buy a stock than to short-sell it. These short-sale constraints mean that it's harder for negative information to be incorporated into the price via aggressive selling, leading to an upward bias in price impact.")
