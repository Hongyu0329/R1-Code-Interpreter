    "My plan is to first research the history of the \"Piazza della Rotonda\" to identify any significant architectural features that were removed around the year 1950. Once I have identified the feature, I will write a Python script that prints this information as the answer, fulfilling the user's request for a coded solution.\n\n```python\ndef find_removed_feature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about a historical architectural feature\n    in the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature_name = \"An ornate cast-iron railing\"\n    purpose = \"It enclosed the central fountain to protect it and regulate the square's market activities.\"\n    removal_year = 1950\n    reason_for_removal = \"It was removed by the city administration to provide a more open, unobstructed view of the Pantheon.\"\n\n    print(\"The architectural feature in the 'Piazza della Rotonda' that was removed around the year 1950 was:\")\n    print(f\"- {feature_name}\")\n    print(f\"\\nDetails:\")\n    print(f\"- Purpose: {purpose}\")\n    print(f\"- Year of Removal (approximate): {removal_year}\")\n    print(f\"- Reason for Removal: {reason_for_removal}\")\n\nfind_removed_feature()\n```\n<<<An ornate cast-iron railing (or fence) that enclosed the central fountain.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
