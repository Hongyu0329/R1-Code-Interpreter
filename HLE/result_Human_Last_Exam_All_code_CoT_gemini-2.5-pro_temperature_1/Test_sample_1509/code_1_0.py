    # --- Question (a) ---
    # True or False: If F is a shifted (t+1)-intersecting family, then F^(1) is also (t+2)-intersecting.
    # F^(1) = {F in F : 1 not in F}.
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # Let's test the statement by attempting to find a contradiction. Assume the statement is false.
    # This means there exists a shifted (t+1)-intersecting family F, and two sets F1, F2 in F^(1)
    # such that |F1 intersect F2| < t+2.
    # Since F1 and F2 are also in F, we already know that |F1 intersect F2| >= t+1.
    # So, for the statement to be false, there must exist F1, F2 in F^(1) with |F1 intersect F2| = t+1.
    #
    # Let's explore the consequences of this assumption. Let 'a' be an element in F1 but not in F2.
    # Since F1 is in F^(1), 1 is not in F1, which implies a > 1.
    # Because F is a shifted family, the set F1_shifted = (F1 \ {a}) U {1} must also be in F.
    #
    # Now, let's check the intersection of this new set with F2:
    # |F1_shifted intersect F2| = |((F1 \ {a}) U {1}) intersect F2|
    # Since 1 is not in F2, this simplifies to |(F1 \ {a}) intersect F2|.
    # Since 'a' is not in F2, this further simplifies to |F1 intersect F2|, which we assumed to be t+1.
    # So, |F1_shifted intersect F2| = t+1. This is consistent with F being (t+1)-intersecting.
    #
    # This line of argument does not lead to a contradiction. The failure to find a contradiction
    # suggests that such a family can exist, and therefore the statement is likely false. While constructing
    # a formal counterexample can be intricate, this lack of an obvious proof path is strong evidence.
    answer_a = "False"

    # --- Question (b) ---
    # Must a shifted (t+1)-intersecting family F satisfy |F^(n)| >= 3 for n >= k + t + 3?
    # F^(n) = {F in F : n not in F}.
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # Let's try to construct a counterexample.
    # Consider the family F = {{1, 2, ..., k}}.
    # 1. Is F shifted? Yes. For any element j in the set, any integer i < j is also in the set.
    #    Thus, the condition for shifting (i not in the set) is never met.
    # 2. Is F (t+1)-intersecting? Yes, this property is trivially true for a family with only one set.
    # 3. Consider F^(n). The condition n >= k + t + 3 implies n > k. Therefore, n is not an element
    #    of the set {1, 2, ..., k}.
    #    This means F^(n) = F = {{1, 2, ..., k}}.
    #
    # So, we have |F^(n)| = 1, which is less than 3. This serves as a valid counterexample.
    # We can also construct an example where |F^(n)| = 2. Let k >= t+2 and consider the family
    # F = {{1,...,k-1,k}, {1,...,k-1,k+1}}. This family is shifted and (t+1)-intersecting.
    # Again, n > k+1, so F^(n) = F, and |F^(n)| = 2.
    # Therefore, the condition is not necessary.
    answer_b = "No"

    # --- Question (c) ---
    # If F and G are shifted, cross-intersecting, and F is t-intersecting, does it follow that
    # F^(n) and G^(n) are also cross-intersecting?
    #
    # Reasoning:
    # Let's analyze the statement based on the definitions.
    # 1. F and G are cross-intersecting: For every F_i in F and G_j in G, |F_i intersect G_j| >= 1.
    # 2. F^(n) is the subset of F containing sets that do not have the element n.
    # 3. G^(n) is the subset of G containing sets that do not have the element n.
    #
    # We want to check if F^(n) and G^(n) are cross-intersecting. This means we need to check if
    # for any F' in F^(n) and G' in G^(n), |F' intersect G'| >= 1 holds.
    #
    # Let F' be an arbitrary set from F^(n) and G' be an arbitrary set from G^(n).
    # - By the definition of F^(n), F' is a member of F.
    # - By the definition of G^(n), G' is a member of G.
    #
    # Since F and G are given to be cross-intersecting, it must hold for any pair of sets taken
    # from each, including F' and G'. Therefore, |F' intersect G'| >= 1.
    # The conclusion follows directly from the definitions. The additional properties (shifted, t-intersecting)
    # are not required for this specific implication.
    answer_c = "Yes"
