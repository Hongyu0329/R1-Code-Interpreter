# The problem asks for the number of connected components of the space of
# non-self-intersecting 6-sided polygons in R^3.

# Step 1: Formulate the problem in terms of knot theory.
# The space of non-self-intersecting polygons is divided into connected
# components based on the knot type of the polygon. Two polygons belong
# to the same component if and only if they represent the same knot type.
# Therefore, the task is to count how many distinct knot types can be
# formed using exactly 6 segments (edges).

# Step 2: Use the concept of "stick number".
# The stick number of a knot is the minimum number of straight segments
# required to form it. We have 6 segments available. We need to find all
# knot types whose stick number is less than or equal to 6.

# Step 3: List the stick numbers for the simplest knots.

# The Unknot (symbol 0_1):
# The stick number is 3 (a triangle). Since 3 is less than or equal to 6,
# we can form unknotted polygons. The unknot is achiral (not distinct from
# its mirror image), so it corresponds to one single component.
num_unknot_components = 1

# The Trefoil knot (symbol 3_1):
# The stick number is 6. Since 6 is less than or equal to 6, we can
# form trefoil knots. The trefoil knot is chiral, meaning the left-handed
# and right-handed versions are topologically distinct. They cannot be
# deformed into one another. This gives two separate components.
num_trefoil_components = 2

# The Figure-eight knot (symbol 4_1):
# The stick number is 7. Since 7 is greater than 6, we cannot form a
# figure-eight knot with a 6-sided polygon.

# All other more complex knots have stick numbers greater than 6.

# Step 4: Calculate the total number of components.
# The total number of components is the sum of the components from each
# possible knot type.
total_components = num_unknot_components + num_trefoil_components

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final equation.
