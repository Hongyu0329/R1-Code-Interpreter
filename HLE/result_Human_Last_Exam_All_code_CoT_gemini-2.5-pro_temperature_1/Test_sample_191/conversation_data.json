    "The protein that, when broken down, facilitates the engulfment of amyloid by macrophages (and microglia in the brain) is **Complement component 3 (C3)**.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Activation**: The complement system, a key part of the innate immune system, recognizes amyloid plaques as foreign or abnormal structures.\n2.  **Breakdown (Cleavage)**: This recognition triggers a cascade that leads to the cleavage (breakdown) of the C3 protein into active fragments, most importantly **C3b**.\n3.  **Opsonization (Tagging)**: The newly formed C3b fragment binds to the surface of the amyloid plaque, effectively \"tagging\" it for destruction.\n4.  **Engulfment (Phagocytosis)**: Macrophages have receptors on their surface (like Complement Receptor 3) that recognize and bind to the C3b tag. This binding triggers the macrophage to engulf and degrade the amyloid plaque.\n\nWhile other proteins like ApoE are involved in mediating the clearance of amyloid, C3 fits the description of being \"broken down\" to directly enable engulfment.\n\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
