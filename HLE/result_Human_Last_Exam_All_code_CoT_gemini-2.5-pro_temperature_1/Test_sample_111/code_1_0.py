# Step 1: Define the known historical facts as variables.
year_of_death = 1368
person_of_interest = "Geoffrey Chaucer"
deceased = "Blanche of Lancaster"
commemorative_work = "The Book of the Duchess"
location_of_work = "England"

# Step 2: Print the reasoning based on these facts.
print(f"{deceased} died in the year {year_of_death}.")
print(f"In her memory, her husband's court poet, {person_of_interest}, wrote his first major work, '{commemorative_work}'.")
print(f"Historical evidence indicates this poem was composed in {location_of_work}, where Chaucer was part of the royal household.")
print(f"Therefore, {person_of_interest} was in {location_of_work} when {deceased} died.")

# Step 3: Identify the correct answer choice.
answer = "C"
print(f"This corresponds to answer choice: {answer}")
