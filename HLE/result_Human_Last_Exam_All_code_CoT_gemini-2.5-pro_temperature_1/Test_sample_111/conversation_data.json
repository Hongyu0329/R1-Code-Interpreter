    "Here is my plan to answer the question:\n1.  I will first establish the date of Blanche of Lancaster's death.\n2.  Then, I will identify Geoffrey Chaucer's activities around that time, specifically the writing of his first major poem, \"The Book of the Duchess,\" which was an elegy for Blanche.\n3.  Based on historical consensus about where this poem was written and Chaucer's service to John of Gaunt and the English court, I will determine his location.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that prints this information and identifies the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the known historical facts as variables.\nyear_of_death = 1368\nperson_of_interest = \"Geoffrey Chaucer\"\ndeceased = \"Blanche of Lancaster\"\ncommemorative_work = \"The Book of the Duchess\"\nlocation_of_work = \"England\"\n\n# Step 2: Print the reasoning based on these facts.\nprint(f\"{deceased} died in the year {year_of_death}.\")\nprint(f\"In her memory, her husband's court poet, {person_of_interest}, wrote his first major work, '{commemorative_work}'.\")\nprint(f\"Historical evidence indicates this poem was composed in {location_of_work}, where Chaucer was part of the royal household.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, {person_of_interest} was in {location_of_work} when {deceased} died.\")\n\n# Step 3: Identify the correct answer choice.\nanswer = \"C\"\nprint(f\"This corresponds to answer choice: {answer}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
