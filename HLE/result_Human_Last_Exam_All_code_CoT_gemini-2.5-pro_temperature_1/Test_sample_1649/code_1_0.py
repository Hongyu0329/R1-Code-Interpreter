    This script demonstrates that the smallest possible size of the limit is 1.

    Problem Setup:
    - J: A directed poset.
    - F: A functor from J^op to Set.
    - F(j) is a non-empty set for all j in J.
    - All maps F(f) are surjective.
    - Goal: Find the minimum possible size of lim F.

    Reasoning:
    1. A theorem in category theory guarantees that under these conditions, the limit
       is always non-empty. Therefore, the size of the limit is at least 1.
    2. We can construct an example where the size is exactly 1. This will prove
       that 1 is the smallest possible size.

    Construction:
    - Let J be any non-empty directed poset. For this script, we'll use a simple
      finite one: J = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} with the usual order <=.
    - Define the functor F such that for every j in J, F(j) is a singleton set,
      e.g., {'*'}. This satisfies the non-empty condition.
    - For every j <= i, the corresponding map from F(i) to F(j) is the identity
      map. The identity map on a singleton set is surjective.

    The script below implements this construction and computes the limit to verify
    its size.
