    "My plan is to solve this conceptual question by breaking down the linguistic theory behind it and applying it to the given phrase.\n\n1.  **Define the Core Concepts:** I will first explain the key types of conceptual metaphors relevant to the answer choices, primarily \"Orientational Metaphor\" and \"Structural Metaphor,\" as described by Lakoff and Johnson.\n2.  **Analyze the Phrase:** I will examine the phrase \"my love for humanity.\" I'll focus on how the abstract concept of \"love\" is being treated or framed in this expression.\n3.  **Apply the Definitions:** I will compare the analysis of the phrase against the definitions of the metaphor types. I will determine if \"love\" is being related to a spatial orientation (up/down, in/out) or if it's being structured in terms of another, more concrete concept.\n4.  **Draw a Conclusion:** Based on the comparison, I will conclude which type of metaphor is being used and select the correct option from the list. The script will print this entire reasoning process.\n\n```python\ndef solve_metaphor_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the conceptual metaphor in a given phrase and selects the correct type.\n    \"\"\"\n    phrase = \"my love for humanity\"\n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"Conceptual metaphor\",\n        \"B\": \"Physical metaphor\",\n        \"C\": \"Orientational metaphor\",\n        \"D\": \"Structural metaphor\",\n        \"E\": \"Intentional metaphor\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"Task: Identify the type of conceptual metaphor in the phrase '{}'.\".format(phrase))\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the phrase.\")\n    print(\"The phrase treats the abstract concept 'love' as something that can be possessed or held ('my love').\")\n    print(\"This frames 'love' as if it were a concrete object or substance.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluating the options based on Conceptual Metaphor Theory.\")\n    print(\"Option C, Orientational Metaphor, relates concepts to spatial orientations (e.g., UP/DOWN, IN/OUT), as in 'I'm feeling up'.\")\n    print(\"The phrase '{}' has no such spatial component.\")\n    print(\"\\nOption D, Structural Metaphor, is when one concept is metaphorically structured in terms of another.\")\n    print(\"In this case, the abstract concept of LOVE is being structured in terms of a concrete OBJECT/SUBSTANCE.\")\n    print(\"This allows us to talk about 'having' love, 'giving' love, or love 'for' someone, just as we would with an object.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Conclusion.\")\n    print(\"The phrase 'my love for humanity' uses a structural metaphor by structuring the concept of LOVE in terms of an OBJECT.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the correct answer is D.\")\n\nsolve_metaphor_question()\n<<<D>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
