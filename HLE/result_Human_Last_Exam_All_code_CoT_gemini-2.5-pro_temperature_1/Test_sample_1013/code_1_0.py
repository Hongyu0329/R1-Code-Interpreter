    """
    This function addresses a theoretical problem from set theory concerning ultrafilters.
    The problem is not solvable by direct computation, as nonprincipal ultrafilters
    are not constructible objects that can be manipulated by a typical algorithm.
    The solution relies on established theorems in advanced mathematics.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of an antichain of ultrafilters
    below a fixed nonprincipal ultrafilter V. An antichain is a set of elements
    where no two are comparable under the given relation.

    The relation is U <= V if there exists a finite-to-one, nondecreasing function
    f: N -> N such that f(V) = U.

    The established answer to this question is 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.
