    "This is a knowledge-based question about classical ballet terminology. I will use a Python script to represent the characteristics of each ballet step and programmatically determine the correct answer. The script will analyze the starting and ending leg positions for each option to find the one where they are identical.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a data structure (a list of dictionaries) in Python to store information about each ballet step listed in the answer choices.\n2.  Each dictionary will contain the step's name, its typical starting position, and its typical ending position, including which foot is in front if relevant.\n3.  The script will iterate through this data.\n4.  It will compare the `start_position` and `end_position` for each step.\n5.  The script will identify and print the step where the starting and ending positions are exactly the same.\n6.  Finally, I will provide the single-letter answer in the required format.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    steps = [\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"A\",\n            \"name\": \"Entrechat six\",\n            \"start\": \"Fifth position, one foot in front\",\n            \"end\": \"Fifth position, opposite foot in front\",\n            \"explanation\": \"An even-numbered entrechat (like six) is a jump where the legs beat and land back in the starting position type (fifth), but always with the feet changed.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"choice\": \"B\",\n            \"name\": \"Échappé battu changé\",\n            \"start\": \"Fifth position (closed)\",\n            \"end\": \"Second position (open)\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The term 'Échappé' means 'escaped' and describes a movement from a closed position to an open one.
