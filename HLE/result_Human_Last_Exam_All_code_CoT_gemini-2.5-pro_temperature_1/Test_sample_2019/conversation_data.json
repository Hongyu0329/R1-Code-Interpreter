    "To solve this problem, I will use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible placements of 4 queens on a 5x5 toroidal board and count the valid, non-attacking configurations.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Represent the Board and Queens:** The 5x5 board will be represented by coordinates from (0,0) to (4,4). I'll use a list of tuples to store the positions of the queens that have been placed.\n2.  **Define Toroidal Attacks:** A queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks another at `(r2, c2)` on an `N x N` toroidal board if:\n    *   They are in the same row (`r1 == r2`).\n    *   They are in the same column (`c1 == c2`).\n    *   They are on the same diagonal. This is true if the toroidal distance between their rows equals the toroidal distance between their columns. The toroidal distance is the shorter of the direct distance and the wrap-around distance (i.e., `min(abs(d1-d2), N - abs(d1-d2))`).\n3.  **Backtracking Algorithm:** I will implement a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time.\n    *   The function will take the number of queens left to place, a starting position for the search, and the list of currently placed queens as input.\n    *   To avoid counting the same placement multiple times (e.g., placing queens at A then B is the same as B then A), I will process the board squares in a fixed order (0 to 24). When a queen is placed at square `i`, the search for the next queen will only consider squares from `i+1` onwards.\n    *   Before placing a queen on a square, I'll check if it's attacked by any queens already on the board.\n    *   If a placement is safe, I'll add the queen and recurse. Afterwards, I'll remove the queen (backtrack) to explore other possibilities.\n4.  **Count Solutions:** The base case for the recursion is when all 4 queens have been successfully placed. When this happens, I will increment a counter.\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will run the backtracking search and print the final count, clearly stating the parameters of the problem (4 queens, 5x5 board).\n\n```python\nclass ToroidalQueensSolver:\n    \"\"\"\n    A class to solve the N-queens problem on a toroidal board.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, board_size, num_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initializes the solver.\n        \n        Args:\n            board_size (int): The size of the square board (N for an NxN board).\n            num_queens (int): The number of queens to place.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.board_size = board_size\n        self.num_queens = num_queens\n        self.solution_count = 0\n\n    def is_safe(self, r, c, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if placing a queen at (r, c) is safe from already placed queens.\n        \n        Args:\n            r (int): The row of the new queen.\n            c (int): The column of the new queen.\n            placed_queens (list): A list of (row, col) tuples for existing queens.\n            \n        Returns:\n            bool: True if the placement is safe, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in placed_queens:\n            # Check for row or column attacks\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n            \n            # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks\n            row_dist = abs(r - qr)\n            col_dist = abs(c - qc)\n            \n            # The toroidal distance is the minimum of the direct and wrap-around distances\n            toroidal_row_dist = min(row_dist, self.board_size - row_dist)\n            toroidal_col_dist = min(col_dist, self.board_size - col_dist)\n            \n            if toroidal_row_dist == toroidal_col_dist:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve(self, queens_to_place, start_index, placed_queens):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively finds valid placements using backtracking.\n        \n        Args:\n            queens_to_place (int): Number of queens remaining to be placed.\n            start_index (int): The linear index of the square to start searching from.\n                               This prevents generating permutations of the same placement.\n            placed_queens (list): List of (row, col) tuples for placed queens.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all queens are placed, we found a solution.\n        if queens_to_place == 0:\n            self.solution_count += 1\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all board squares, starting from start_index.\n        for i in range(start_index, self.board_size * self.board_size):\n            r = i // self.board_size\n            c = i % self.board_size\n            \n            # Check if it's safe to place a queen here\n            if self.is_safe(r, c, placed_queens):\n                # Place the queen\n                placed_queens.append((r, c))\n                # Recurse to place the next queen, starting from the next square\n                self.solve(queens_to_place - 1, i + 1, placed_queens)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities\n                placed_queens.pop()\n\n    def find_solutions(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Starts the backtracking search and prints the final result.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.solve(self.num_queens, 0, [])\n        # The final \"equation\" is the statement of the result.\n        # The numbers in the equation are the board size and the number of queens.\n        print(f\"The number of ways to place {self.num_queens} non-attacking queens on a {self.board_size}x{self.board_size} toroidal chessboard is: {self.solution_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # Define problem parameters\n    BOARD_SIZE = 5\n    NUM_QUEENS = 4\n    \n    # Create a solver and run it\n    solver = ToroidalQueensSolver(BOARD_SIZE, NUM_QUEENS)\n    solver.find_solutions()\n```\n<<<50>>>"
