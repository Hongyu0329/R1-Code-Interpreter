    Analyzes the relationship between three levels of explanation for a learned fear.
    1. Folk Psychology: "I became afraid."
    2. Behavioral Psychology: Classical conditioning model.
    3. Neuroscience: Neural changes in the PAG.

    The explanations are not inconsistent (A), nor are they independent (C).
    They represent a coherent, multi-level description of a single phenomenon.
    The neural level (3) is the physical basis for the behavioral level (2),
    which in turn is the scientific mechanism for the subjective experience (1).
    Therefore, they are different hypotheses (as they operate at different levels
    of abstraction with different concepts), but they are not mutually exclusive.
    Instead, they are co-dependent. If one is an accurate description of the event,
    the others, which describe the same event from different perspectives, must also be.
    This makes option D the most accurate choice.
