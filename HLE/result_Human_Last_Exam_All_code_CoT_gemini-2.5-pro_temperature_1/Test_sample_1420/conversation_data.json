    "In the context of the renormalization group, the scaling exponent α for the specific heat can be calculated using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion. This method involves performing an expansion in the small parameter `ϵ = d_c - d`, where `d_c` is the upper critical dimension and `d` is the spatial dimension of the system.\n\nHere is the plan to solve for α:\n1.  **Identify the model and its upper critical dimension (`d_c`)**: For most common phase transitions (like the liquid-gas or ferromagnetic transition), we use the O(n) model. Its upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. We will assume the simplest case, the Ising model, where the number of spin components `n = 1`.\n2.  **Calculate the expansion parameter (`ϵ`)**: Given the spatial dimension `d=3`, we calculate `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **Apply the first-order formula**: The formula for the specific heat exponent `α` to the first order in `ϵ` for the O(n) model is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Substitute and Solve**: We will plug the values of `n` and `ϵ` into the formula to find the value of `α`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Define a function to handle the calculation and printing\ndef calculate_specific_heat_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for the 3D Ising model.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define parameters\n    d = 3      # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension for the O(n) model\n    n = 1      # Number of spin components for the Ising model\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the specific heat exponent α for a system with d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"We use the epsilon expansion for the O(n) model, assuming the Ising universality class (n = {n}).\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension for this model is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate epsilon\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the expansion parameter ϵ = d_c - d.\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 3: Use the first-order formula for alpha\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the first-order expansion formula for α:\")\n    print(\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 4: Substitute values and calculate\n    print(\"Step 3: Substitute the values and compute α.\")\n    \n    # Breaking down the formula for clear output\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator_part1 = 2\n    denominator_part2 = n + 8\n    denominator = denominator_part1 * denominator_part2\n    \n    # The final calculation\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / ({denominator_part1} * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / ({denominator_part1} * {denominator_part2}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    \n    # To display the result as a fraction\n    # In Python 3, a simple way is using the fractions module\n    try:\n        from fractions import Fraction\n        alpha_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator) * epsilon\n        print(f\"α = {alpha_fraction.numerator}/{alpha_fraction.denominator}\")\n    except ImportError:\n        # Fallback for older python or minimal environments\n        pass\n        \n    print(f\"α ≈ {alpha}\")\n    \n    # Store the final numerical answer for the \"answer\" block\n    # This part will not be printed to the user console\n    sys.stdout = open(os.devnull, 'w')\n    print(f\"<<<{alpha}>>>\")\n    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__\n\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_specific_heat_exponent()\n\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
