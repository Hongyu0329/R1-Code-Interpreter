    # --- Analysis ---
    # 1. The poem uses parallel structures between speakers' stanzas.
    #    Stanzas 3 & 4 use "I, that was once...".
    #    Stanzas 7 & 8 use "Meseems I...".
    #    The "intended form" for stanzas 5 & 6 is a parallel use of "Long since...".

    # 2. Count the "Long since" lines in the provided text.
    strephon_ls_count = sum(1 for line in stanza_5_strephon.values() if line.strip().startswith("Long since"))
    klaius_ls_count = sum(1 for line in stanza_6_klaius.values() if line.strip().startswith("Long since"))

    # 3. Identify the break in form. The parallel structure is broken because it's asymmetrical.
    # Strephon has 2 "Long since" lines, while Klaius has 3.
    # A swap must have caused this asymmetry.

    # 4. Identify the candidate lines for the swap. To restore symmetry, a "Long since" line
    # from Klaius' stanza must have been swapped with a non-"Long since" line from Strephon's.
    
    # Let's test swapping line 27 and line 35.
    line_X_num = 27
    line_Y_num = 35

    line_X_text = stanza_5_strephon[line_X_num]
    line_Y_text = stanza_6_klaius[line_Y_num]
    
    # 5. Check if swapping them restores the poem's grammatical and thematic sense.
    #
    # Restored Strephon Stanza:
    # Line 26 ("Hath made itself...") now correctly refers to "music" in line 25.
    # The new line 27 ("Long since my thoughts chase me...") joins the other "Long since"
    # lines to form a coherent, parallel lament.
    #
    # Restored Klaius Stanza:
    # The new line 35 ("And hath with wailing strength...") now correctly refers to
    # "music" in line 32, creating a powerful image: his music has climbed the mountains.
    #
    # This swap fixes the broken thematic and grammatical form.

    # 6. The reason the sestina's end-word pattern still appears correct in the modified text
    # is a coincidence: the swapped lines happen to have the end-words required by their
    # new, incorrect positions.
    # - Line 27 needs to end in "mountains". The text from line 35 was put there, but we identify it as line 27 in its incorrect position. The original text of line 35 must have ended in "mountains".
    # - Line 35 needs to end in "forests". The text from line 27 was put there, but we identify it as line 35 in its incorrect position. The original text of line 27 must have ended in "forests".

    # The provided text has line 27 and 35 in the wrong places.
