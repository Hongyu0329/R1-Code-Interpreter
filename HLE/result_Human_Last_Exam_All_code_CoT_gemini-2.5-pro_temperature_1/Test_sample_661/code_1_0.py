    This function prints the rules added by the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm.
    The process involves finding critical pairs, orienting them into new rules,
    and simplifying the system until no new non-trivial rules can be generated.

    # The rules added during the completion process are determined as follows:
    # 1. A critical pair between the first and third initial rules yields g(x) = h(x).
    #    With the LPO f<g<h, this orients to: h(x) -> g(x).
    # 2. This new rule simplifies the system. A subsequent critical pair between the
    #    simplified rules yields g(g(g(x))) = g(x).
    #    This orients to: g(g(g(x))) -> g(x).
    # 3. The algorithm terminates as no more non-trivial critical pairs can be found.

    # The added rules must be ordered by their left-hand side (LHS) using the LPO.
    # We compare LHS g(g(g(x))) and h(x).
    # Since the precedence is g < h, the LPO dictates that h(x) > g(g(g(x))).
    # Therefore, the increasing order is g(g(g(x))) -> g(x) first, then h(x) -> g(x).

    # The final rules are printed as a comma-separated string.

    # as a generic instruction; since there are no numbers, we output the rules as is.
