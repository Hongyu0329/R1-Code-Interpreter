    "This is a geographical question that requires visual interpretation of satellite imagery, rather than a computational solution. My plan is to use my knowledge base, which includes information from maps, to identify the shape formed by the specified school buildings in Pisa. I will then provide a Python script that prints this finding to fulfill the request for a coded answer.\n\nThe two schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, are located in long, parallel buildings. These two main structures are connected by a perpendicular section in the middle, creating a distinct shape. When viewed from above on a map, this arrangement clearly forms the letter 'H'.\n\n```python\ndef find_building_shape():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the answer to the geographical puzzle about the\n  shape of the high school buildings in Pisa.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The two parallel school buildings are connected in the middle,\n  # forming a specific letter shape when viewed from above.\n  letter_shape = \"H\"\n\n  print(f\"The buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa, when seen from above, form the letter: {letter_shape}\")\n\nfind_building_shape()\n```\n<<<H>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In Pisa there are multiple highschools.
