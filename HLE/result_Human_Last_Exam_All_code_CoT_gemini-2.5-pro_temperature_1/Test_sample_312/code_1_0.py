    This script calculates the smallest possible value of c based on the
    theory of Fourier transforms of Frostman measures.

    The problem states: for every 8/5-Frostman measure mu on R^2,
    the L^2 norm of its Fourier transform on a circle of radius r,
    is O(r^(c+epsilon)). We want to find the smallest possible c.

    The derivation steps are as follows:
    1. The squared L^2 norm can be written as an integral:
       Integral_{S^1} |mu_hat(r*sigma)|^2 d(sigma) = Integral Integral J_0(2*pi*r*|x-y|) d(mu(x)) d(mu(y))
       where J_0 is the Bessel function of order 0.

    2. The decay of this integral for large r is governed by the decay of the
       Bessel function kernel J_0(t), which behaves like t^(-1/2) for large t.
       In d dimensions, the decay of the corresponding kernel is t^(-(d-1)/2).

    3. This implies that the integral, which is the squared L^2 norm, decays like r^(-(d-1)/2).
       This bound is valid because the 8/5-Frostman condition ensures that the
       associated energy integral I_{1/2}(mu) is finite (since 8/5 > 1/2).

    4. So, the L^2 norm itself decays like (r^(-(d-1)/2))^(1/2) = r^(-(d-1)/4).

    5. The problem is set in R^2, so the dimension d=2.

    6. The problem states the decay is O(r^(c+epsilon)). By comparing the exponents,
       we find the smallest possible value for c.
