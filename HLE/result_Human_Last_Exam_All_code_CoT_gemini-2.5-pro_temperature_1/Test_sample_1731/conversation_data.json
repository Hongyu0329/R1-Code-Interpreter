    "Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Connect Large Deviation Theory to Statistical Mechanics:** I will start by explaining that large deviation theorems, such as the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, provide a formal justification for the **Principle of Maximum Entropy** used in statistical mechanics. This principle states that the equilibrium state of a system is the one that maximizes entropy subject to macroscopic constraints.\n2.  **Apply the Principle of Maximum Entropy:** I will apply this principle to the system in question: a gas of light quanta (photons). Photons are bosons whose total number is not conserved, which means their chemical potential is zero. The macroscopic constraint is the total mean energy, `U`. Maximizing the entropy for bosons under this constraint yields the Bose-Einstein distribution for the equilibrium occupation numbers of energy levels.\n3.  **Calculate Macroscopic Quantities:** To find the total mean energy `U` and the total entropy `S`, I will integrate the energy and entropy contributions from each level over the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume.\n4.  **Derive Final Equations:** This integration results in the well-known Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy (`U` is proportional to `V * T^4`) and a corresponding formula for entropy (`S` is proportional to `V * T^3`).\n5.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that calculates the proportionality constants for these equations using fundamental physical constants. The script will then print the final, complete equations for the equilibrium mean energy `U` and entropy `S` as functions of volume `V` and temperature `T`. It will also highlight the fundamental relationship between `S` and `U`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas based on the principle of maximum entropy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define physical constants ---\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    h = 6.62607015e-34   # Planck constant in J*s\n    c = 299792458        # Speed of light in m/s\n    pi = np.pi\n\n    # --- Step 2: Explain the derivation context ---\n    print(\"Derivation based on Large Deviation Theory (via Principle of Maximum Entropy):\")\n    print(\"1.
