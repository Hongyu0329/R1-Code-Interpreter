    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  First, I will simplify the integrand, which is an infinite sum, $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. The sum of logarithms can be expressed as the logarithm of an infinite product.\n2.  I will use the well-known infinite product identity for the cosine function: $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin x}{x}$. This transforms the integrand into a much simpler function, $\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)$.\n3.  The integral then becomes $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$. I'll analyze this integral. The argument of the logarithm, $\\frac{\\sin x}{x}$, becomes negative for certain intervals of $x$, making the logarithm undefined for real numbers. Also, a direct evaluation shows that the integral diverges if not handled carefully.\n4.  To resolve this, I'll adopt the standard interpretation used in physics and mathematics for such integrals, which involves taking the absolute value of the argument of the logarithm. This makes the integrand $\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|$, which is well-defined for almost all $x > 0$.\n5.  The resulting integral, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right| \\mathrm{d}x$, is a famous definite integral known as Malmsten's integral. Its value is a known result, $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script to present this result, displaying the final equation and its numerical value, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to solve the integral and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: The integrand is simplified using an infinite product identity.\n    # The sum sum_{n=1 to inf} log(cos(x/2^n)) is equal to log(prod_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n)).\n    # The infinite product prod_{n=1 to inf} cos(x/2^n) is a known identity equal to sin(x)/x.\n    # So the integrand becomes log(sin(x)/x).\n    \n    # Step 3 & 4: The integral becomes I = integral(0 to inf) of log(sin(x)/x) dx.\n    # The argument of the log is negative for x in (pi, 2*pi), (3*pi, 4*pi), etc.\n    # For the integral to be well-defined and convergent, we must interpret it as:\n    # I = integral(0 to inf) of log(|sin(x)/x|) dx.\n    \n    # Step 5: This is a known definite integral called Malmsten's integral.\n    # The value of this integral is -pi / 2.\n    \n    numerator_val_pi = math.pi\n    denominator_val = 2\n    \n    final_value = -numerator_val_pi / denominator_val\n    \n    print(\"The value of the integral is given by the equation: -pi / 2\")\n    print(f\"The components of the equation are:\")\n    print(f\"pi = {numerator_val_pi}\")\n    print(f\"2 = {denominator_val}\")\n    print(f\"The final value is: {final_value}\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n```\n<<<-1.5707963267948966>>>"
