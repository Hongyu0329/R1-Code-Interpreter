    "This is a problem in the field of point-set topology. The solution relies on combining a few key theorems about continua.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  Define the key terms: continuum, nondegenerate, and composant.\n2.  Establish that the product of two continua is itself a continuum.\n3.  Introduce the concept of a 'decomposable' continuum.\n4.  State a fundamental theorem that connects the number of composants to whether a continuum is decomposable.\n5.  State a second fundamental theorem about the decomposability of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n6.  Combine these theorems to arrive at the conclusion. The number of composants is always a fixed number.\n7.  Since the number of composants is always the same, this number is also the maximum possible number.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this reasoning and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the reasoning to find the largest possible number\n    of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Thinking Process:\")\n    print(\"1.
