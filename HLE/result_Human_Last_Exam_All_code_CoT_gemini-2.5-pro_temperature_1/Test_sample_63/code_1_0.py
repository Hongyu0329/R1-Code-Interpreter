# The user's request is a riddle, which does not involve a mathematical equation.
# This script will therefore print the two-word name that serves as the solution.

word1 = "Protest"
word2 = "Poet"

# The solution to the riddle is a two-word name where both words start with the same letter.
# This print statement displays that name.
print(f"{word1} {word2}")
