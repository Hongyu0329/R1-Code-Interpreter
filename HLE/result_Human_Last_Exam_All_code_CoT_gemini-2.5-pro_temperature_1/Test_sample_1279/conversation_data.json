    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n*   First, I will explain the context of the problem, which involves calculating symmetry factors for Feynman diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory.\n*   I will identify the relevant diagrams. At the second order in the coupling constant $\\lambda$, there are two interaction vertices. For vacuum bubble diagrams, there are no external lines, so all propagator lines must be internal. We will focus on the **connected** diagrams, as is the standard convention in quantum field theory for calculating quantities like the vacuum energy.\n*   The two possible connected diagrams at this order are:\n    1.  A diagram where the two vertices are connected by two propagators, and each vertex also has a self-loop. Let's call this the **\"Saturn\" diagram**.\n    2.  A diagram where the two vertices are connected by four propagators. Let's call this the **\"Melon\" diagram**.\n*   Next, I will explain how the symmetry factor for a diagram is calculated. The symmetry factor, S, is the order of the group of automorphisms of the diagram, which means it's the number of ways you can permute the internal lines and vertices that leave the diagram's topology unchanged.\n*   I will then calculate the symmetry factor for each of the two diagrams.\n*   Finally, I will sum these two symmetry factors to get the total, as requested.\n*   The Python code will perform these calculations and print out each step, including the individual factors, the symmetry factor for each diagram, and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the second-order connected vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 theory and their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in φ⁴ theory.\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: The \"Saturn\" Diagram ---\n    # This diagram has two vertices, each with a self-loop, connected by two propagators.\n    print(\"1.
