    # c represents the cardinality of the continuum, which is 2^(aleph_0).
    # In Python, we can't represent transfinite numbers directly.
    # We will represent the final answer symbolically using strings.
    
    # The cardinality of the continuum, c
    c = "2^aleph_0"
    
    # The result is 2^c
    result_cardinality = f"2^({c})"
    
    # However, c > aleph_0, and for infinite cardinals a, b with a <= b, a^b = 2^b.
    # So, c^c = (2^aleph_0)^c = 2^(aleph_0 * c).
    # Since aleph_0 < c, aleph_0 * c = c.
    # So c^c = 2^c.
    # The number of complements we found is (2^c)^c = 2^(c*c) = 2^(2^c).
    # Let me recheck the calculation.
    # Number of complements = |F(B)|^|A|
    # |A| = c, |B| = aleph_0
    # |F(B)| = 2^(2^aleph_0) = 2^c
    # Number = (2^c)^c = 2^(c*c) = 2^c
    
    # The smallest possible number of complements is 2 to the power of the continuum.

    # The problem asks for the exact cardinality.
    # We will print the components of this expression.
