# Based on the mathematical derivation, the problem reduces to finding
# the lexicographically smallest tuple (a1, b1, ..., al, bl) with minimal l
# such that:
# 1. l is an odd integer, and the minimal possible value is l=3.
# 2. For l=3, the pairs (a_i, b_i) must satisfy the equation:
#    (1-a1)*(1-b1) + (1-a2)*(1-b2) + (1-a3)*(1-b3) = 1
# 3. For each pair, a_i and b_i must be non-negative integers not equal to 1.

# Through analysis, we found that the set of pairs {(0,0), (0,0), (0,2)} 
# satisfies the equation and leads to the lexicographically smallest tuple.

# To form the lexicographically minimal tuple (a1,b1,a2,b2,a3,b3),
# we order the three pairs as (0,0), (0,0), and (0,2).
p1 = (0, 0)
p2 = (0, 0)
p3 = (0, 2)

# The final tuple is the concatenation of these pairs.
final_tuple = p1 + p2 + p3

# The values for each term in the sum
x1 = (1 - p1[0]) * (1 - p1[1])
x2 = (1 - p2[0]) * (1 - p2[1])
x3 = (1 - p3[0]) * (1 - p3[1])

# Output the explanation and the final equation as requested.
