    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The goal is to find the maximum Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter cutoff value from the provided table that satisfies two conditions simultaneously:\n    *   Sensitivity must be greater than 60%.\n    *   Specificity must be greater than 80%.\n2.  **Data Extraction:** I will represent the data from the table in the image (Aortomesenteric diameter, Sensitivity, and Specificity) as a list of tuples within a Python script.\n3.  **Filtering Logic:** The script will iterate through this data. For each diameter cutoff, it will check if both the sensitivity and specificity values are greater than their respective thresholds (60% and 80%).\n4.  **Identify Maximum Value:** All diameter values that meet both conditions will be collected. The script will then find and print the maximum value from this collection.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\ndef find_max_diameter_cutoff():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter cutoff that has a sensitivity\n    greater than 60% and a specificity greater than 80%.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data extracted from the provided ROC curve analysis table.\n    # Each tuple represents: (Diameter_cutoff, Sensitivity, Specificity)\n    data_points = [\n        (15.1, 6.7, 100.0),\n        (13.9, 13.3, 100.0),\n        (12.8, 20.0, 100.0),\n        (12.0, 26.7, 100.0),\n        (11.4, 33.3, 100.0),\n        (10.9, 40.0, 100.0),\n        (10.4, 46.7, 100.0),\n        (9.8, 53.3, 95.8),\n        (9.5, 60.0, 91.7),\n        (9.2, 66.7, 87.5),\n        (8.5, 73.3, 83.3),\n        (7.9, 80.0, 75.0),\n        (7.5, 86.7, 66.7),\n        (6.9, 93.3, 54.2),\n        (6.2, 100.0, 41.7),\n        (5.5, 100.0, 29.2),\n        (4.7, 100.0, 16.7),\n        (4.2, 100.0, 4.2)\n    ]\n\n    # A list to store diameter cutoffs that meet the criteria.\n    valid_diameters = []\n\n    # Iterate through each data point to find ones that match the criteria.\n    for diameter, sensitivity, specificity in data_points:\n        # Check if sensitivity is > 60% AND specificity is > 80%.\n        if sensitivity > 60 and specificity > 80:\n            valid_diameters.append(diameter)\n\n    # Find the maximum diameter from the list of valid diameters.\n    if valid_diameters:\n        max_valid_diameter = max(valid_diameters)\n        # As per the instructions, print the final number of the result.\n        print(max_valid_diameter)\n    else:\n        print(\"No diameter found that meets the specified criteria.\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the result.\nfind_max_diameter_cutoff()\n```\n<<<9.2>>>"
