    "To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Understand the Group Structure:** The group PSU(n, q) is defined as `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`, where `SU(n, q)` is the special unitary group and `Z` is its center. For our case, `n=4` and `q=997`. The order of the center `Z` is `gcd(n, q+1) = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`. So, `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n2.  **Identify Involutions in PSU(4, q):** An element `gZ` in `PSU(4, q)` is an involution if `(gZ)^2` is the identity element, which means `g^2` must be in the center `Z`. So, we need to count the elements `g` in `SU(4, q)` such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\n3.  **Count the Pre-images:** Let `N_I` be the number of elements in `SU(4, q)` such that `g^2 = I`. Let `N_{-I}` be the number of elements such that `g^2 = -I`.\n    *   The elements with `g^2 = I` (involutions in `SU(4,q)`) that are not in the center `Z` project to involutions in `PSU(4,q)`. The number of such elements is `N_I - 2`.\n    *   The elements with `g^2 = -I` also project to involutions in `PSU(4,q)`. The number of these is `N_{-I}`.\n    *   Since the projection is 2-to-1 (both `g` and `-g` map to the same element in `PSU(4,q)`), the total number of involutions in `PSU(4,q)` is `( (N_I - 2) + N_{-I} ) / 2`.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Counts:** Using formulas from the theory of finite classical groups:\n    *   `N_I = 2 + |SU(4,q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(g_2)|`, where `g_2` is a representative involution from the class with two `-1` eigenvalues. The centralizer size leads to `N_I = 2 + q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)`.\n    *   `N_{-I} = |SU(4,q)| / |GL(2, q^2)|`, which simplifies to `N_{-I} = q^4(q^3+1)`.\n\n5.  **Derive the Final Formula:** Substituting these into the expression from step 3:\n    *   Number of involutions = `( (2 + q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)) - 2 + q^4(q^3+1) ) / 2`\n    *   `= ( q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + q^4(q+1)(q^2-q+1) ) / 2`\n    *   `= ( q^4(q^2-q+1) * ( (q^2+1) + (q+1) ) ) / 2`\n    *   `= ( q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + q + 2) ) / 2`\n\n6.  **Calculate the Value:** We can now write a Python script to compute this value for `q = 997`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_psu_involutions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, q) for a given q.\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The number of involutions in PSU(4, q) is given by the formula:\n    # (q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + q + 2)) / 2\n    # We will calculate each term of the numerator first.\n\n    # Calculate q^4\n    term1 = q**4\n\n    # Calculate q^2 - q + 1\n    term2 = q**2 - q + 1\n\n    # Calculate q^2 + q + 2\n    term3 = q**2 + q + 2\n\n    # The full numerator is term1 * term2 * term3\n    numerator = term1 * term2 * term3\n\n    # The final result is the numerator divided by 2\n    result = numerator // 2\n\n    print(\"To find the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997), we use the formula:\")\n    print(\"(q^4 * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + q + 2)) / 2\\n\")\n    print(f\"For q = {q}, the terms are:\")\n    print(f\"q^4 = {term1}\")\n    print(f\"q^2 - q + 1 = {term2}\")\n    print(f\"q^2 + q + 2 = {term3}\\n\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"({term1} * {term2} * {term3}) / 2\\n\")\n    print(f\"The number of involutions is: {result}\")\n\nsolve_psu_involutions()\n```\n<<<486071720847953503521>>>"
