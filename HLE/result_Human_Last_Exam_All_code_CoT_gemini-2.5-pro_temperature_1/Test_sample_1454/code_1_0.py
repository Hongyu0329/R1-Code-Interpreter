    Solves the problem by analyzing the properties of the set F.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of components of a closed set F
    in the unit square that satisfies the equation:
    F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4
    where D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3),(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}.
    The components must be nondegenerate and locally connected.

    # Step 1 & 2: Identify all possible solutions for F.
    # The equation F = T(F) is a fixed-point equation. For a closed set F
    # within the compact unit square, there are two solutions.

    # Solution A: The non-empty attractor of the IFS.
    # A detailed analysis shows this attractor F_attr is the product of a Cantor set
    # (on the x-axis) and the unit interval [0,1] (on the y-axis).
    # F_attr consists of uncountably many vertical line segments.
    # Each line segment is a connected component.
    # Each component (a line segment) is non-degenerate and locally connected.
    # So, for this solution, the number of such components is infinite.
    num_components_attr = float('inf')

    # Solution B: The empty set.
    # Let F = {}. The left side is {}.
    # The right side is the union of empty sets, which is the empty set.
    # So, F = {} is a valid closed set in the unit square that satisfies the equation.
    # A connected component is defined as a maximal NON-EMPTY connected subset.
    # The empty set has no non-empty subsets, so it has no components.
    # The number of components for the empty set is 0.
    num_components_empty = 0

    # Step 3: Find the smallest possible number among the solutions.
    # The set of possible numbers of components is {infinity, 0}.
    # The smallest number in this set is 0.
    final_answer = min(num_components_attr, num_components_empty)

    # Step 4: Print the reasoning and the final answer.
