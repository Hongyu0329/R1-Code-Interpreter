    Solves the mathematical problem about the minimal length of a tower of uncountable subsets of omega_1.

    The problem asks for the minimal ordinal delta for a tower 
    <x_alpha : alpha in delta> of uncountable subsets of omega_1, satisfying:
    1. alpha < beta < delta  =>  |x_beta - x_alpha| is countable.
    2. The tower is maximal (has no uncountable lower bound y such that 
       |y - x_alpha| is countable for all alpha).

    Let's denote the relation |A - B| is countable as A <=* B.
    The tower property is x_beta <=* x_alpha for alpha < beta (a descending tower).
    Maximality means there is no uncountable y such that y <=* x_alpha for all alpha.
    The minimal length of such a tower is the cardinal invariant t(omega_1).

    Step 1: Prove that delta > omega_1.
    We can show that any tower of length omega_1 (or less) is NOT maximal.
    This is done by a diagonalization argument. Given a tower <x_alpha : alpha < omega_1>,
    we can construct an uncountable set 'y' which serves as a lower bound,
    contradicting maximality. The construction of 'y' involves taking one element from the
    difference of successive sets in a strictly descending version of the tower.
    This shows that delta must be a cardinal larger than omega_1.

    Step 2: Identify the smallest cardinal greater than omega_1.
    The cardinals are ordered: 0, 1, 2, ..., omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, ...
    omega_0 is the first infinite cardinal (aleph_0).
    omega_1 is the first uncountable cardinal (aleph_1).
    The smallest cardinal strictly greater than omega_1 is omega_2 (aleph_2).

    Step 3: Conclude the minimal possible value for delta.
    From Step 1, we know delta must be at least omega_2.
    The existence of a maximal tower can be proven with Zorn's Lemma.
    The length of such a tower must be a regular cardinal.
    A regular cardinal > omega_1 must be >= omega_2.
    It is consistent with the axioms of set theory (ZFC) that such a tower of
    length omega_2 exists. Therefore, we cannot prove a stronger lower bound.

    Conclusion: The minimal possible value for delta is omega_2.
