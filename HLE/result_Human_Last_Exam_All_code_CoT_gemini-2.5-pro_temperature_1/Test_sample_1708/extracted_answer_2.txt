The order type is the unique non-empty, countable, linear order type τ which has a minimum element and is a solution to the recursive equation τ = 1 + 4⋅τ, where 1 is the order type of a single element and 4 is the order type of a four-element set. It is order-isomorphic to the set of rational numbers in [0, 1] having a finite representation in base 5 using only digits from {1, 2, 3, 4}, plus the number 0.
