    "This is a music theory question. I will identify the song that fits the described harmonic movement.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Analyze the user's request: The user is asking for a Beatles song that starts with a specific chord progression: Tonic (I) to minor fifth (v). This is a type of modal interchange, where a chord is \"borrowed\" from the parallel minor key.\n2.  Recall or research Beatles' song introductions and verse progressions.\n3.  The song \"Got to Get You into My Life\" from the album *Revolver* is a perfect example.\n4.  The song is in the key of G major. The tonic chord (I) is G major.\n5.  The fifth degree of the G major scale is D. The chord built on this is normally a D major (V). A \"minor fifth\" chord would be D minor (v).\n6.  The verse of \"Got to Get You into My Life\" begins with the line \"I was alone, I took a ride...\" and the chords are G major followed by D minor. This is a clear I -> v progression.\n7.  I will create a Python script to print this finding and the harmonic analysis.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the Beatles song\n    that matches the user's music theory query.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Got to Get You into My Life\"\n    key = \"G Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"G Major\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"D minor\"\n\n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts its verse with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Musical Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"Key: {key}\")\n    print(f\"Tonic Chord (I): {tonic_chord}\")\n    print(f\"Minor Fifth Chord (v): {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n    \n    # Representing the progression as a simple \"equation\" as requested.\n    print(\"\\nChord Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Chord 1 (Tonic) -> Chord 5 (Minor)\")\n    print(f\"The progression is {tonic_chord} -> {minor_fifth_chord}\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Got to Get You into My Life>>>"
