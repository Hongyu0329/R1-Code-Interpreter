The separating equilibrium is defined by the following pair of contracts:

Contract for Low Type (L):
$(v_L, p_L) = (2/3, 182/9)$
Approximately: $(v_L, p_L) = (0.6667, 20.2222)$

Contract for High Type (H):
$(v_H, p_H) = (\frac{3+\sqrt{377}}{6}, \frac{213+\sqrt{377}}{6})$
Approximately: $(v_H, p_H) = (3.7360, 33.7360)
