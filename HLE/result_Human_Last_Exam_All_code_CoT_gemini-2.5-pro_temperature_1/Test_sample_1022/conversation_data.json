    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we will use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Künneth Formula**: For two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology with trivial real coefficients gives us the dimension of the cohomology of their direct product:\n    $\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$.\n    In our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ (Thompson's group T) and the degree $n=4$.\n\n2.  **Bounded Cohomology of T**: We need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T, $H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$. These are known results from the work of Burger and Monod:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 4$.\n\n3.  **Calculation**: We will substitute these values into the Künneth formula for $n=4$:\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n    This involves summing the products for pairs $(p, q)$ such as $(0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0)$.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print out each step of the formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cohomology_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group\n    of T x T with trivial real coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_degree = 4\n\n    # The dimension of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T with trivial\n    # real coefficients, dim(H_b^n(T; R)), is a known result in geometric group theory.\n    # We store these dimensions for n=0, 1, 2, 3.
