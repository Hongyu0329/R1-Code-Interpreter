    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it is defined. The GSD is equal to `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits the code can store. The number of logical qubits depends on the genus of the surface and the number and type of boundaries (holes).\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to determine the formula:\n1.  **Identify the System:** The system is the `Z_2` toric code on a surface that is topologically equivalent to a sphere (genus `g=0`) with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes.\n2.  **Relate GSD to Logical Qubits:** The ground state degeneracy is given by GSD = `2^k`, where `k` is the number of independent logical qubits.\n3.  **Count Logical Qubits:** The number of logical qubits can be determined by counting the number of independent logical operators that commute with the Hamiltonian but are not stabilizers. These operators come in pairs `(X_L, Z_L)` that anti-commute with each other, forming a single qubit.\n    *   **Smooth Holes:** A set of `n` smooth holes allows for `n-1` independent logical qubits. The `X` logical operators can be formed by Z-strings connecting pairs of smooth holes, and the `Z` logical operators can be formed by X-loops encircling smooth holes.\n    *   **Rough Holes:** Similarly, a set of `m` rough holes allows for `m-1` independent logical qubits. The `Z` logical operators are X-strings between rough holes, and the `X` logical operators are Z-loops around rough holes.\n    *   **Combining Smooth and Rough Holes:** When both types of holes are present, the logical operators associated with each type are not entirely independent. Specifically, an X-loop around a smooth hole (`Z_L` for a \"smooth qubit\") and a Z-loop around a rough hole (`X_L` for a \"rough qubit\") anti-commute. This intertwining of the operator algebras means we cannot simply add the qubits from each type.\n4.  **Derive the Formula:** A detailed analysis considering the full algebra of logical operators, or by mapping the sphere with holes to a disk with an outer boundary and inner holes, shows that the total number of logical qubits `k` is `n + m - 2`. This assumes `n+m >= 2`.\n5.  **Final Formula:** With `k = n + m - 2`, the ground space degeneracy is `GSD = 2^(n + m - 2)`. This corresponds to answer choice B.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this by constructing and printing the final formula for user-provided values of `n` and `m`.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the formula for the ground space degeneracy\n    of the toric code with n smooth holes and m rough holes.\n\n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of smooth holes.\n        m (int): The number of rough holes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 0 or m < 0:\n        print(\"Number of holes cannot be negative.\")\n        return\n    \n    # The number of logical qubits k is n + m - 2.\n    # The ground space degeneracy is 2^k.\n    # This formula is generally valid for n + m >= 2.\n    \n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a sphere\")\n    print(f\"with n={n} smooth holes and m={m} rough holes is given by the formula: GSD = 2^(n + m - 2).\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the given values, the equation is:\")\n    \n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"2^({n}+{m}-2)\")\n\n# Example usage with n=5 smooth holes and m=3 rough holes.\nn_smooth_holes = 5\nm_rough_holes = 3\ncalculate_toric_code_degeneracy(n_smooth_holes, m_rough_holes)\n```\n<<<B>>>"
