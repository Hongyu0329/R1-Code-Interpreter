# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# The actual deception involved faking cow tracks. Thus, the answer is 6.
A = 6

# Part B: The theme is "education vs mis-education". The allusion to Holmes,
# the master educator, ironically highlights the commentator Kinbote's role
# as a mis-educator. Thus, the answer is 3.
B = 3

# Part C: Nabokov's most direct and pervasive experience with "intricate
# back-referencing" was his monumental translation and commentary on
# Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin". Thus, the answer is 7.
C = 7

# The final numbers add to a multiple of 8, as required.
total = A + B + C

# Printing the final equation with each number.
print(f"{A} + {B} + {C} = {total}")
