    print("In Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS), we typically use two laser beams, a pump (frequency ω_p) and a Stokes (frequency ω_s).")
    print("When their frequency difference matches a molecular vibrational frequency (Ω), a coherent vibration is excited.")
    print("This can be expressed with the equation:")
    omega_vibrational = "Ω"
    omega_pump = "ω_p"
    omega_stokes = "ω_s"
    print(f"Vibrational Resonance: {omega_vibrational} = {omega_pump} - {omega_stokes}")
    print("\nA third beam, the probe (often the same as the pump), interacts with this vibration to generate the output signal.")
    print("This output is the anti-Stokes signal (ω_as), which is at a higher frequency (bluer) than the pump.")
    print("The final equation for the anti-Stokes frequency is:")
    omega_as = "ω_as"
    two = 2
    print(f"Final Equation: {omega_as} = {two} * {omega_pump} - {omega_stokes}")

    print("\n--- Step 2: The 'Broadband' Aspect ---")
    print("The goal of 'broadband' or 'multiplex' CARS is to measure an entire vibrational spectrum at once, instead of just one frequency.")
    print("This is done by making one of the input beams broadband (i.e., containing a wide range of frequencies). The question specifies a broadband pump beam.")
    print("This allows the system to simultaneously satisfy the resonance condition (Ω = ω_p - ω_s) for many different vibrational frequencies (Ω) present in the sample.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: The Resulting Anti-Stokes Signal ---")
    print("Since many different vibrations are excited at the same time, the generated anti-Stokes signal is also broadband.")
    print("This means the anti-Stokes beam is a composite signal made up of many different frequencies.")
    print("Crucially, these frequencies can be separated using a spectrometer. Each separated frequency component in the anti-Stokes signal corresponds to a specific molecular vibration.")
    print("Therefore, the broadband anti-Stokes beam contains a rich spectrum of information where each vibrational mode is distinguishable.")

    print("\n--- Step 4: Evaluating the Answer Choices ---")
    print("A. You can only generate a Stokes beam -> Incorrect. The Stokes beam is an input; the CARS signal is the anti-Stokes beam.")
    print("B. You can generate an anti Stokes beam, but it doesn't contain separate vibrational information -> Incorrect. The entire purpose of the broadband method is to obtain a signal containing a spectrum of separable information.")
    print("C. You can generate a anti Stokes beam that contains distinguishable information -> Correct. This is the fundamental advantage of broadband CARS.")
    print("E. You cannot generate an anti Stokes beam -> Incorrect. CARS is defined by the generation of an anti-Stokes signal.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The correct statement is that a broadband CARS setup generates an anti-Stokes beam containing distinguishable vibrational information.")
