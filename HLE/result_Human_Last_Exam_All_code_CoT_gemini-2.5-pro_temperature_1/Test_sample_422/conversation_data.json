    "Of course. Here is a Python script that uses code to demonstrate two fundamental problems with the JTB (Justified True Belief) definition of knowledge, excluding Gettier problems.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will define a simple `Belief` class in Python to represent a belief with its properties: content, truth-value, and justification.\n2.  To demonstrate the **first problem**, the **Infinite Regress of Justification**, I will explain how a function designed to check for knowledge by recursively checking its justification would lead to an infinite loop, making it impossible to ever ground knowledge.\n3.  To demonstrate the **second problem**, the **Devaluation of Justified False Beliefs**, I will create two beliefs: one that is justified but false, and another that is a mere guess. I will show that the JTB model classifies both as \"not Knowledge.\" If the only other available state is \"Belief,\" this wrongly equates a carefully reasoned (but false) conclusion with a wild guess, failing to capture the value of justification.\n\nThe script will print out this step-by-step explanation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Set a lower recursion limit to prevent a long crash when demonstrating the regress problem.\n# The default is often 1000.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(15)\n\nclass Belief:\n    \"\"\"A simple class to represent a belief and its properties.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, content, is_true, justification=None):\n        self.content = content\n        self.is_true = is_true\n        # The justification for a belief is often composed of other beliefs.\n        self.justification = justification\n\ndef run_analysis():\n    \"\"\"Demonstrates and explains the two problems with the JTB definition.\"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the JTB definition: Knowledge = Justified True Belief\")\n    print(\"Constraint: The only available epistemic states are 'Knowledge' and 'Belief'.\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    # --- Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification ---\n    print(\"Problem 1: The Infinite Regress of Justification\\n\")\n    print(\"The JTB model requires justification.

The Infinite Regress of Justification: The requirement that a belief's justification must also be known leads to an infinite chain of justifications, making it impossible to ground any piece of knowledge. 2. The Devaluation of Justified False Beliefs: The JTB framework fails to distinguish between a belief that is well-reasoned but false and one that is a mere guess. Both are categorized simply as \"not knowledge\" (and therefore \"Belief\"), ignoring the epistemic value of justification when a belief is not true.>>>"
