1. The Infinite Regress of Justification: The requirement that a belief's justification must also be known leads to an infinite chain of justifications, making it impossible to ground any piece of knowledge. 2. The Devaluation of Justified False Beliefs: The JTB framework fails to distinguish between a belief that is well-reasoned but false and one that is a mere guess. Both are categorized simply as "not knowledge" (and therefore "Belief"), ignoring the epistemic value of justification when a belief is not true.
