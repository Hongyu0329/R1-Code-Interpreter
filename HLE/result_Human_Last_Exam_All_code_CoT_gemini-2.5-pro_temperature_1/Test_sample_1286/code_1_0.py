    Children learn language by grounding words in real-world, sensory experiences.
    Features that make a word easier to see, hear, or touch make it easier to learn.
    Therefore, we look for features with a POSITIVE effect on children.
    - Word Concreteness (A): Positive effect. 'Ball' is easier than 'justice'.
    - Word Imageability (E): Positive effect. 'Dragon' is easier than 'logic'.
    - Word Frequency (G): Positive effect. Common words are easier.
    - Word Length/Complexity (B, C, D): Negative effect. Longer/complex words are harder.
    
    Candidates based on positive effect on children: A, E, G.

    LLMs learn language by predicting words from statistical patterns in massive text corpora.
    A word is 'easy to acquire' if it is highly predictable from its context. A word
    is 'hard to acquire' if it is unpredictable (has high 'surprisal').
    - Word Frequency (G): Positive effect. More training examples make a word easier to predict.
    - Word Concreteness (A) / Imageability (E): This is the key insight. Concrete words
      (e.g., 'table', 'water', 'hand') can appear in a vast and diverse range of
      textual contexts, making them statistically LESS predictable from the surrounding
      text alone. Abstract words (e.g., 'amortization', 'eigenvector') often appear in
      very specific, narrow contexts, making them MORE predictable. Therefore, high
      concreteness has a NEGATIVE effect on an LLM's prediction task.
