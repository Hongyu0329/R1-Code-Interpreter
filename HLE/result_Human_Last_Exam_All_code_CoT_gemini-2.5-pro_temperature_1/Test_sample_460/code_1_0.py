# Define the parameters given in the problem
m = 4  # The total number of items
t = 20 # The threshold for the number of agents assigned to an item in O

# The problem is to find the smallest integer u such that for any number of agents and
# any set of preferences, a "suitable" subset O is guaranteed to exist.
#
# This value is determined by a known theorem in matching theory. The formula for the
# smallest such u is:
# u = (m - 1) * t

# Calculate the value of u using the formula
u = (m - 1) * t

# Print the explanation and the calculation step-by-step
print(f"The smallest integer u is determined by the formula: u = (m - 1) * t")
print(f"Given the parameters m = {m} and t = {t}, the calculation is as follows:")
print(f"u = ({m} - 1) * {t}")
print(f"u = {m-1} * {t}")
print(f"u = {u}")
