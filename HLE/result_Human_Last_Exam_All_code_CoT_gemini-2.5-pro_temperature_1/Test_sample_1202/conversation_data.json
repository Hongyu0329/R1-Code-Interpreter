    "This is a knowledge-based question about molecular evolution. I will use a Python script to systematically analyze each of the provided options. The script will store the definitions and relevance of each term in a data structure. It will then iterate through them, print an analysis of each, and determine which mechanism is the most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes, ultimately printing the final conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the mechanisms of gene duplication to find the most likely\n    cause of retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            'term': 'Gene conversion',\n            'explanation': 'This is a process of non-reciprocal DNA transfer that makes homologous sequences (like duplicate genes) more similar.
