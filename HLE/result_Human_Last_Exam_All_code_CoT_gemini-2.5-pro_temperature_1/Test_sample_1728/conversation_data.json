    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Interpret the Graph Operation**: The problem states the graph \\( G \\) is the \"sum of three cycles.\" In graph theory, this typically refers to the graph join operation, denoted by '+'. So, \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\). The graph join of several graphs combines them into a single graph, adding edges between every vertex of one graph to every vertex of the others.\n2.  **Use the Chromatic Number Property of Graph Joins**: There is a well-known formula for the chromatic number of a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This property extends to the sum of three graphs, meaning \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Analyze the Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( \\chi(C_n) \\))**: The chromatic number of a cycle graph \\( C_n \\) depends on its length \\( n \\) (assuming \\( n \\ge 3 \\), as is standard for cycles).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is even, the cycle is bipartite, and its vertices can be colored with two colors. Thus, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is odd, the cycle is not bipartite, and three colors are required. Thus, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n4.  **Find the Maximum Value**: The question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\), we must find the maximum possible value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). Comparing the two cases, the maximum value is 3.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer**: By substituting the maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into our equation, we can find the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\). The python script below will walk through this logic and print the final calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G\n    that is the sum of three cycles of length n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the graph structure and the formula for its chromatic number.\n    print(\"Let G be the graph formed by the sum of three cycles of length n, denoted as C_n.\")\n    print(\"The 'sum' of graphs corresponds to the graph join operation.\")\n    print(\"A key property of the graph join is that the chromatic number of the resulting graph is the sum of the chromatic numbers of the individual graphs.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the chromatic number of G is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) = 3 * chi(C_n)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the chromatic number of a cycle C_n.\n    print(\"To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we need to find the maximal value of chi(C_n).\")\n    print(\"The chromatic number of a cycle C_n (for n >= 3) depends on the parity of n:\")\n    print(\" - If n is even, chi(C_n) = 2 (as the graph is bipartite).\")\n    print(\" - If n is odd, chi(C_n) = 3.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Determine the maximum value for chi(C_n).\n    max_chi_cn = 3\n    print(f\"The maximum value for the chromatic number of a single cycle C_n is {max_chi_cn}, which occurs when n is an odd number.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate and display the final answer.\n    num_cycles = 3\n    max_chi_g = num_cycles * max_chi_cn\n    print(\"Substituting this maximum value into our formula for chi(G), we get the maximal chromatic number:\")\n    print(f\"Maximal chi(G) = {num_cycles} * {max_chi_cn} = {max_chi_g}\")\n\n\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
