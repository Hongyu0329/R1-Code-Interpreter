    "Answering this question requires a multi-step analysis involving polynomial factorization, Galois theory, and group theory.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Factor the Polynomial**: The given polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$ is defined over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The first step is to factor it into irreducible polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  **Determine the Galois Group**: The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields of its irreducible factors. We will determine the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ by analyzing the Galois groups of the factors and how they combine.\n3.  **Apply Galois Correspondence**: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory establishes a correspondence between subfields of $K$ and subgroups of $G$. Specifically, a subfield extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if the corresponding subgroup $\\text{Gal}(K/L)$ is a normal subgroup of $G$.\n4.  **Find Normal Subgroups and Their Indices**: We will identify all proper, non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$. The degree of a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is equal to the index of the corresponding normal subgroup in $G$.\n5.  **List the Degrees**: The set of all possible indices found in the previous step will be the answer.\n\nThe following Python code executes this plan. It uses the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics to perform tasks like factorization and discriminant calculation. The subsequent group-theoretic analysis is explained within the code's output.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, poly, factor, discriminant, real_roots\n\ndef solve_galois_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the splitting field of the polynomial x^7 - 2x^5 - 9x^3 + 3x^2 + 18x - 6\n    and finds the possible degrees of its proper normal subfields over Q.\n    \"\"\"\n    x = symbols('x')\n    f = x**7 - 2*x**5 - 9*x**3 + 3*x**2 + 18*x - 6\n\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = {f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Factor the polynomial over Q\n    print(\"Step 1: Factoring the polynomial\")\n    try:\n        factors = factor(f, x)\n        print(f\"Factoring f(x) over Q, we get: {factors}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Could not factor the polynomial.
