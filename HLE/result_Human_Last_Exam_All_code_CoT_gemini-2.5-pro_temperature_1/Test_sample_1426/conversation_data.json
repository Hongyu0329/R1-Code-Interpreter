    "To find the lowest of the last three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Consult the Score**: First, I need to examine the musical score for the symphony, specifically the first violin part (`Violino I`) at the very end of the piece (the final measures of the 4th movement).\n2.  **Identify the Notes**: The last three notes played by the first violin are F, D, and B-flat (B♭). In standard pitch notation, these are F5, D4, and B♭4.\n3.  **Compare Pitches**: To programmatically determine the lowest note, we can convert these pitches to MIDI note numbers, which provide a standard numerical representation. A higher number corresponds to a higher pitch.\n    *   D4 corresponds to MIDI note 62.\n    *   B♭4 corresponds to MIDI note 70.\n    *   F5 corresponds to MIDI note 77.\n4.  **Find the Minimum**: I will use a Python script to store these notes and their MIDI values in a dictionary, then find the note with the minimum MIDI value. The script will print each note and its value before declaring the lowest one.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef find_lowest_note():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the lowest of the last three notes for the first violin in Dvorak's Symphony No. 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the last three notes and their corresponding MIDI values.\n    # This data is obtained by reading the musical score.\n    # The notes are F5, D4, and B-flat4.\n    notes = {\n        \"D4\": 62,\n        \"B-flat4\": 70,\n        \"F5\": 77\n    }\n\n    print(\"The last three notes for the first violin are D4, B-flat4, and F5.\")\n    print(\"To find the lowest, we can compare their numerical pitch values (MIDI numbers):\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Print each note and its value.\n    for note, value in notes.items():\n        print(f\"Note: {note}, Pitch Value: {value}\")\n        \n    # Step 3: Find the note with the minimum MIDI value.\n    lowest_note_name = min(notes, key=notes.get)\n    \n    # Step 4: Print the result.\n    print(f\"\\nComparing the pitch values {list(notes.values())}, the lowest value is {notes[lowest_note_name]}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the lowest note is {lowest_note_name}.\")\n\nfind_lowest_note()\n```\n<<<D4>>>"
