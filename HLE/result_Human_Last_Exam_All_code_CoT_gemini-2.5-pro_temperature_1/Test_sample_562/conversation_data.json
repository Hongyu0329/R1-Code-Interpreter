    "My plan is to identify the radical (bushu) for the kanji 謄.\n\n1.  I will first break down the character 謄 into its constituent parts.\n2.  The character 謄 can be separated into a left part and a right part.\n3.  The left part is 月. This form can represent either the \"moon\" radical (tsuki) or the \"meat\" radical (niku). In this context, as part of a character related to the body or form (as in making a copy), it is the \"meat\" radical, 肉. When it appears as a left-side component (hen), it's called \"nikuzuki\" (肉月).\n4.  The right part is 朕.\n5.  The radical for 謄 is the left part, 肉, known as \"nikuzuki\".\n6.  I will then find the Hepburn romanization for \"にくづき\", which is \"Nikuzuki\".\n7.  Finally, I will create a Python script to print the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the radical for the kanji 謄.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji = \"謄\"\n    # The radical for 謄 is 肉 (niku), which appears on the left side (hen)\n    # in a form that looks like the moon radical (月).\n    # This specific form is called \"nikuzuki\" (肉月).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Nikuzuki\"\n    \n    print(f\"The radical for the character '{kanji}' is called '{radical_name_hepburn}'.\")\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Nikuzuki>>>"
