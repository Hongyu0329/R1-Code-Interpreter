    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs that covers all edges of the complete graph $K_n$ for $n=35$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical problem:** The question asks for the minimum value of $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$, where $\\{B_1, \\dots, B_k\\}$ is a family of bipartite graphs whose edge sets cover the edge set of $K_n$.\n2.  **Use the known result:** This is a well-known problem in combinatorial theory. The minimum value is given by the formula:\n    $$ S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil $$\n3.  **Calculate the sum:** We can compute this sum for $n=35$. A straightforward way is to iterate from $i=1$ to $35$. A more structured way is to group the integers $i$ based on the value of $\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil$.\n    -   $\\lceil \\log_2 i \\rceil = k$ for all $i$ such that $2^{k-1} < i \\le 2^k$.\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that calculates this sum by grouping the terms as described above. The script will construct and print the full equation, showing how each group contributes to the final sum, as requested.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all edges of the complete graph K_n for n=35.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all edges of K_n for n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"This value is given by the formula: S = sum_{i=1 to n} ceil(log2(i)).\")\n    print(\"\\nWe calculate this sum by grouping terms with the same value of ceil(log2(i)):\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    if n <= 0:\n        print(\"n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Using a more robust way to group terms\n    last_i = 0\n    k_max = math.ceil(math.log2(n)) if n > 0 else 0\n\n    for k in range(k_max + 1):\n        # The range of i for which ceil(log2(i)) == k is (2^(k-1), 2^k].\n        # For k=0, this is not well-defined, but we know ceil(log2(i))=0 only for i=1.\n        if k == 0:\n            if n >= 1:\n                num_terms = 1\n                contribution = num_terms * k\n                total_sum += contribution\n                equation_parts.append(f\"{num_terms} * {k}\")\n            continue\n\n        # For k >= 1\n        lower_bound = 2**(k - 1)\n        upper_bound = 2**k\n        \n        # Number of integers i in (lower_bound, upper_bound] that are also <= n\n        count = max(0, min(n, upper_bound) - lower_bound)\n\n        if count > 0:\n            contribution = count * k\n            total_sum += contribution\n            equation_parts.append(f\"{count} * {k}\")\n\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"\\nThe final calculation is: {final_equation} = {total_sum}\")\n\nsolve_graph_problem()\n```\n<<<147>>>"
