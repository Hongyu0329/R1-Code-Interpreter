print("A tower of length lambda is a sequence <x_alpha : alpha < lambda> of uncountable subsets of omega_1.")
print("The conditions for the tower are:")
print("1. For alpha < beta < lambda, |x_beta \\ x_alpha| < omega_1. This means x_beta is an 'almost subset' of x_alpha, written x_beta subseteq* x_alpha.")
print("2. There is no uncountable set y such that y subseteq* x_alpha for all alpha. This means the tower has no pseudo-intersection.")

print("Let lambda be a regular cardinal in X, the length of a tower <x_alpha>.")
print("This tower corresponds to a non-increasing sequence of elements [x_alpha] in the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1)/countable.")
print("The size of this algebra B is |P(omega_1)|, which is 2^omega_1.")

print("Let lambda be a regular cardinal in X. If lambda > omega_2, then lambda would be a sum of at most |B| = omega_2 cardinals, corresponding to the fibers of the map from lambda to B.")
print("Since lambda is regular and lambda > omega_2, this would imply that one fiber has size lambda. This would mean the tower is constant for a sequence of length lambda, which contradicts the no pseudo-intersection property.")
print("Therefore, any regular cardinal lambda in X must satisfy lambda <= omega_2.")
print("This implies that delta_1 = sup(X) <= omega_2.")
print("Since we already established that omega_2 is in X, we must have omega_2 <= sup(X) = delta_1.")
