    explanation = """
No, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides.

While both are polymers (large molecules made of repeating subunits), their fundamental structures are entirely different. Here is a breakdown:

1.  Monomers (The Building Blocks):
    - Polysaccharide Monomer: A monosaccharide (e.g., glucose). This is a simple sugar.
    - Polynucleotide Monomer: A nucleotide. This is a more complex molecule composed of three parts:
        a) A pentose sugar (either deoxyribose or ribose).
        b) A phosphate group.
        c) A nitrogenous base.

2.  Bonds (How the Blocks are Linked):
    - Polysaccharides: Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds.
    - Polynucleotides: Nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds, which form a distinct sugar-phosphate backbone.

Conclusion:
Although a polynucleotide contains a sugar component, the monomer is a complete nucleotide (sugar + phosphate + base). The presence of the phosphate group and the nitrogenous base, along with the phosphodiester linkage, makes a polynucleotide a fundamentally different class of molecule from a polysaccharide, which is purely a polymer of sugars.
