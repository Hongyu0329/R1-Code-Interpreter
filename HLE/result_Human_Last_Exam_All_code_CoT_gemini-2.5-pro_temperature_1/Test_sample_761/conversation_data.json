    "My plan is to provide a Python script that, when executed, will print a detailed explanation answering your question. The explanation will clarify the fundamental structural differences between polynucleotides and polysaccharides by comparing their respective monomers and the chemical bonds that link them.\n\nThe script will:\n1.  Start with a clear and direct \"No\".\n2.  Explain that the monomers for polysaccharides are simple sugars (monosaccharides).\n3.  Explain that the monomers for polynucleotides are nucleotides, which are more complex units composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n4.  Highlight the different types of bonds that form the polymer chain in each case: glycosidic bonds for polysaccharides and phosphodiester bonds for polynucleotides.\n5.  Conclude by summarizing that despite the presence of a sugar in the nucleotide structure, the overall composition and bonding make them a distinct class of macromolecule.\n\n```python\ndef explain_structural_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints a detailed explanation of why polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.\n    \"\"\"\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nNo, polynucleotides are not, structurally, polysaccharides.\n\nWhile both are polymers (large molecules made of repeating subunits), their fundamental structures are entirely different. Here is a breakdown:\n\n1.  Monomers (The Building Blocks):\n    - Polysaccharide Monomer: A monosaccharide (e.g., glucose). This is a simple sugar.\n    - Polynucleotide Monomer: A nucleotide. This is a more complex molecule composed of three parts:\n        a) A pentose sugar (either deoxyribose or ribose).\n        b) A phosphate group.\n        c) A nitrogenous base.\n\n2.  Bonds (How the Blocks are Linked):\n    - Polysaccharides: Monosaccharides are linked by glycosidic bonds.\n    - Polynucleotides: Nucleotides are linked by phosphodiester bonds, which form a distinct sugar-phosphate backbone.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough a polynucleotide contains a sugar component, the monomer is a complete nucleotide (sugar + phosphate + base). The presence of the phosphate group and the nitrogenous base, along with the phosphodiester linkage, makes a polynucleotide a fundamentally different class of molecule from a polysaccharide, which is purely a polymer of sugars.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(explanation.strip())\n\nexplain_structural_differences()\n```\n<<<No, polynucleotides are not structurally polysaccharides.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
