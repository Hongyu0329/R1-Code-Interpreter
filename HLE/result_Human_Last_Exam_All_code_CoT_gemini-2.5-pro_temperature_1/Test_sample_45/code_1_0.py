    # Step 1: Relate focal length (f) to angular velocity (omega).
    # The surface of a rotating liquid in a gravitational field g forms a paraboloid
    # with the equation z = (omega^2 * x^2) / (2 * g).
    # The standard equation for a parabola with focal length f is x^2 = 4 * f * z.
    # By comparing these two equations, we find:
    # 4 * f = 2 * g / omega^2
    # which simplifies to f = g / (2 * omega^2).
    # This means that f is inversely proportional to the square of omega.

    # Step 2: Relate angular velocity to time using the constant power source.
    # A constant power source P means the rate of change of kinetic energy K is constant.
    # P = dK/dt
    # The rotational kinetic energy is K = (1/2) * I * omega^2, where I is the moment of inertia.
    # Assuming I is constant, P = d/dt [ (1/2) * I * omega^2 ] = (1/2) * I * d(omega^2)/dt.
    # This gives us a differential equation for omega^2.
    print("Step 2: Using the constant power condition.")
    print("Power P = dK/dt, where K = (1/2) * I * omega^2.")
    print("Since P and I are constant, we have: d(omega^2)/dt = 2*P/I = constant.\n")

    # Step 3: Solve for the time dependence of omega^2.
    # Integrating d(omega^2)/dt with respect to time gives:
    # omega^2 = (2 * P / I) * t + C (where C is the integration constant).
    # The system starts from rest, so at t=0, omega=0. This implies C=0.
    # Therefore, omega^2 = (2 * P / I) * t.
    # This shows that omega^2 is directly proportional to time t.
    print("Step 3: Solving for the time dependence of omega^2.")
    print("Integrating d(omega^2)/dt gives: omega^2 = (2*P/I) * t + C.")
    print("With initial condition omega(0)=0, we find C=0.")
    print("So, omega^2 ∝ t.\n")

    # Step 4: Combine the results to find the relationship between f and t.
    # From Step 1: f ∝ (omega^2)^-1
    # From Step 3: omega^2 ∝ t
    # Substituting the time dependence into the focal length relation:
    # f ∝ (t)^-1
    # This means f is proportional to t to the power of -1.
    n = -1
