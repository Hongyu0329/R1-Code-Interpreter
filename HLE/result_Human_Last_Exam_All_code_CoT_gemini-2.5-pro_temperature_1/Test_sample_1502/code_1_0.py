# This script will analyze the three theoretical questions and provide a reasoned answer for each.

# --- Step 1: Analysis for Part (a) ---
# The question is: True or false: The energy J_t becomes unbounded from below
# as t -> +inf if p > 2(1 + 3s) / (1 + s).

# We consider the path J(u_t, v_t) for a fixed function (u, v) and t -> infinity.
# The transformation is w_t(x, y) = t^((1+s)/2) * w(t^s * x, t * y).
# Let's analyze the scaling of the different terms in J.
# The H^{1,s} norm involves terms like integral(|grad w|^2) and integral(|w|^2).
# The L^2 norm component, integral(|w|^2), is invariant under this scaling.
# The gradient components scale differently:
# integral(|d(w_t)/dx|^2) scales with t^(2s)
# integral(|d(w_t)/dy|^2) scales with t^2

# The L^p norm term ||w_t||_Lp^p scales with t^gamma_p. Let's derive gamma_p.
s, p, t = sp.symbols('s p t', positive=True)
power_on_t = p * (1 + s) / 2
change_of_vars = -(s + 1)
gamma_p = power_on_t + change_of_vars

# To determine if J_t can go to -infinity, we need to see if a negative term can
# grow faster than the positive H^{1,s} term. The H^{1,s} term is a sum of
# terms scaling with t^(2s) and t^2. We can choose a function u that varies
# predominantly in the x-direction, making its kinetic energy grow like t^(2s).

# For J_t(u_t, 0) to tend to -infinity, we need the exponent of the negative L^p term
# to be larger than the exponent of this dominant kinetic term, i.e., gamma_p > 2s.
inequality = gamma_p > 2 * s
# We solve this inequality for p.
p_critical_expr = sp.solve(inequality, p)[0]

# Now, we print the explanation and the result.

print("A mountain pass geometry, via the Mountain Pass Theorem, ensures the existence of a critical point, which is a solution to the system.")
print("However, the theorem does not specify the nature of this solution. Specifically:")
print("1. It is not guaranteed to be a 'ground state' (a solution with the lowest energy among all non-trivial solutions). The MPT finds a solution at a minimax level, which could be higher than the ground state energy.")
print("2. It is not guaranteed to be 'positive' (i.e., u>0 and v>0). Sign-changing solutions can exist and may be found by this method.")
print("Proving the existence of a positive ground state requires separate, more involved arguments. Thus, the statement is No.")


# --- Step 3: Analysis for Part (c) ---
print("\n--- Analysis for Part (c) ---")
print("The question asks about the uniqueness of a solution obtained by minimizing J_t over a constraint set P(a,b).")
print("A primary reason for non-uniqueness is the translation invariance of the problem in Euclidean space. If (u(x,y), v(x,y)) is a solution, then any translated version (u(x-x0, y-y0), v(x-x0, y-y0)) is also a solution.")
print("This means the solution is never strictly unique.")
print("Even if 'uniqueness' is understood up to symmetries, it is not guaranteed for systems of PDEs, which can exhibit multiple distinct families of solutions.")
print("The condition on r1+r2 is typically related to the existence of a minimizer (a subcriticality condition), not its uniqueness. Therefore, the answer is No.")
