Based on the body of evidence about its role in T cell biology, manufacturing CAR T cells with interleukin-15 (IL-15) would be predicted to **increase** the release of key effector cytokines (such as Interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha) upon antigen stimulation, compared to CAR T cells manufactured without IL-15.

Here is the reasoning for this prediction:

1.  **Enhanced T Cell Survival and Proliferation:** IL-15 is a potent cytokine that promotes the survival and homeostatic proliferation of T cells. This leads to a more robust and larger population of CAR T cells available to fight the cancer.

2.  **Promotion of a Memory Phenotype:** IL-15 preferentially supports the development of long-lived memory T cells (specifically T memory stem cells and central memory T cells). These cells are less differentiated, have a high capacity for self-renewal, and can mount a powerful and sustained response upon re-encountering their target.

3.  **Increased Functional Capacity:** Because IL-15 generates a more persistent and functionally fit CAR T cell product, these cells are more effective when activated by cancer cells. A stronger activation of a larger and more potent T cell population will naturally result in a greater overall production and release of the cytokines that mediate the anti-tumor effect.

In conclusion, the addition of IL-15 during the manufacturing process enhances the overall potency of the CAR T cell product, which directly translates to a greater capacity for cytokine release when the cells perform their function.
