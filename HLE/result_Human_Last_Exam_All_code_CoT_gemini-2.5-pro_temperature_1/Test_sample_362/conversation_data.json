    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to determine the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: I'll first break down the names of the reactants to understand their chemical structures.\n    *   **Aldehyde**: Pivalaldehyde. This is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl, so its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n    *   **Wittig Reagent**: (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane. This is a phosphorus ylide. The \"triphenyl\" part is P(C₆H₅)₃, and the \"ethylidene\" part is a two-carbon chain attached to the phosphorus. A \"2-(2-chlorophenyl)\" group is attached to the second carbon of this chain. The ylide structure is (C₆H₅)₃P=CH-CH₂-(C₆H₄Cl).\n\n2.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Logic**: The Wittig reaction is a powerful method for synthesizing alkenes. It works by replacing the oxygen atom of a carbonyl group (C=O) with the carbon group from a phosphorus ylide (P=C).\n\n3.  **Construct the Product**:\n    *   The pivalaldehyde provides the `(CH₃)₃C-CH=` part of the new alkene.\n    *   The ylide provides the `=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)` part.\n    *   Combining these two fragments across the new double bond gives the product: `(CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-chlorophenyl)`.\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: The IUPAC name for this structure is **1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene**. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide, (C₆H₅)₃P=O.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that defines the reactants and products using their names and SMILES strings (a textual representation of chemical structures). The script will programmatically show how the product is formed and print the full reaction equation, including the numbers in the product's final IUPAC name as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of a Wittig reaction and prints the\n    details of the chemical equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Reactant 1: The aldehyde\n    aldehyde_name = \"Pivalaldehyde\"\n    aldehyde_smiles = \"CC(C)(C)C=O\" # (CH3)3C-CHO\n\n    # Reactant 2: The Wittig reagent (phosphorus ylide)\n    wittig_reagent_name = \"(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane\"\n    # The reactive part of the ylide is the carbon group double-bonded to phosphorus.\n    # Structure: =CH-CH2-(C6H4Cl), where C6H4Cl is a 2-chlorophenyl group.\n    ylide_reactive_fragment_smiles = \"CCc1ccccc1Cl\"\n\n    # --- The Wittig Reaction Mechanism ---\n    # The reaction replaces the carbonyl oxygen (=O) from the aldehyde with the\n    # carbon group (=CR'R'') from the ylide to form a new alkene (C=C).\n\n    # Step 1: Get the aldehyde's carbon skeleton by conceptually removing the oxygen.\n    aldehyde_carbon_fragment = aldehyde_smiles.replace(\"=O\", \"=\")\n\n    # Step 2: The ylide's carbon fragment is what will be added.\n    ylide_carbon_fragment = ylide_reactive_fragment_smiles\n\n    # Step 3: Combine the two fragments to form the final alkene product.\n    alkene_product_smiles = aldehyde_carbon_fragment + ylide_carbon_fragment\n    alkene_product_name = \"1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene\"\n\n    # Step 4: The other reaction product is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n    oxide_product_name = \"Triphenylphosphine oxide\"\n    oxide_product_smiles = \"O=P(c1ccccc1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3\"\n\n    # --- Output the results ---\n    print(\"--- Wittig Reaction Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"\\nReactants:\")\n    print(f\"1.
