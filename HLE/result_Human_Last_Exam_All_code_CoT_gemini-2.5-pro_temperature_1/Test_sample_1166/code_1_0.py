    """
    Analyzes the list of function types to determine which are necessarily Lebesgue integrable.

    A function f is Lebesgue integrable if:
    1. It is measurable.
    2. The integral of its absolute value is finite.

    F. A continuous function on [a,b]:
       - Continuous on a compact set -> Bounded and Measurable.
       - Bounded measurable function on a finite measure set -> Integrable.
       - Result: YES

    L. A measurable function whose absolute value is integrable:
       - This is the definition of a Lebesgue integrable function.
       - Result: YES

    M. A bounded continuous function on (a,b):
       - Continuous -> Measurable.
       - Bounded on a finite measure set -> Integrable.
       - Result: YES
    
    Other options fail because they are not guaranteed to be measurable (A, G, H, I) or
    their integral is not guaranteed to be finite (B, C, D, E, J, K).
