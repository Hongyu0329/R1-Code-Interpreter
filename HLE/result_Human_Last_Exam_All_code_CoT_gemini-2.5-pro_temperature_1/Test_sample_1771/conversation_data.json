    "Of course. Here is my plan to trace the evolution of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂gieti` through the Germanic languages.\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form:** The form `*seh₂gieti` comes from the root `*seh₂g-`. For the development into Germanic, we will look at the o-grade of this root, which is `*soh₂g-`. This is common for this class of verbs.\n2.  **PIE to Proto-Germanic:** I will apply the relevant sound laws, primarily Grimm's Law, which affects consonants, and the laryngeal rules, which affect vowels.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** The voiced stop `*g` will become a voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   **Laryngeal Vocalization:** The combination `*o` + `h₂` (`*oH`) will lengthen to `*ō`.\n    *   The PIE present tense suffix `*-ieti` corresponds to the Proto-Germanic weak verb Class 1 infinitive suffix `*-janą`.\n3.  **Proto-Germanic to Daughter Languages:** I will then trace the Proto-Germanic form into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German, applying the specific sound changes for each language.\n    *   **For Old Norse:** I will apply i-umlaut, where the `*j` in the suffix affects the preceding root vowel `*ō`.\n    *   **For Old English:** I will apply both i-umlaut and the palatalization of `*k` before a front vowel/glide like `*j`.\n    *   **For Old High German:** I will apply the High German Consonant Shift to the `*k` and the characteristic diphthongization of the long vowel `*ō`.\n\nI will now generate a Python script to display these changes step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef trace_linguistic_evolution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function traces the PIE verb *seh2gieti to its descendants\n    in several old Germanic languages and prints the derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The initial PIE form provided by the user, including the number 2.\n    pie_form_original = \"*seh2gieti\"\n    \n    # We start from the o-grade of the root, *soh₂g-, which is the basis for the Germanic verb.\n    pie_root_ograde = \"*soh₂g-\"\n    \n    # The derived forms in each language stage.\n    proto_germanic = \"*sōkijaną\"\n    old_norse = \"sœkja\"\n    old_english = \"sēċan\"\n    old_high_german = \"suohhen\"\n    \n    print(f\"Tracing the evolution of PIE {pie_form_original} (root: {pie_root_ograde}):\\n\")\n    \n    # --- Step 1: Proto-Germanic ---\n    print(\"1.
