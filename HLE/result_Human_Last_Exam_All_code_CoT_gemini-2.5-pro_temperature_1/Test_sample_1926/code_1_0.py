    This function analyzes the provided problem in arithmetic geometry and prints the reasoned answer.
    The problem asks for the asymptotic ratio of a special subset of degree d points on a curve to the set of all degree d points.

    The key elements are:
    - C: A curve over a number field k.
    - G: The Galois group of a map from C to the projective line P^1.
    - H: A Weil height.

    The question concerns the density of special points. While simple arguments might suggest 0 or 1,
    the presence of the Galois group G in the problem description is a strong hint that the answer
    depends on its structure.

    In arithmetic statistics, there are principles and conjectures that relate the density of points
    with specific arithmetic properties to the size of relevant Galois groups. The heuristic is that
    the geometric symmetries (given by G) govern the arithmetic distribution. A random point is
    equally likely to be associated with any of the |G| automorphisms, and only one of these possibilities
    corresponds to the specific arithmetic structure mentioned in the problem (being in a fiber over a rational point of P^1).

    This leads to the conclusion that the ratio approaches 1 / |G|.
