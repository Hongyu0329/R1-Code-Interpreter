# Step 1: Define the values from the problem.
# The density of the sausage, based on symmetry arguments for the conditioned Brownian motion.
# The process is conditioned to avoid a unit disk, and the sausage is built from a unit disk.
# This suggests a 'hit-or-miss' probability of 1/2 for a similar disk placed far away.
delta = fractions.Fraction(1, 2)

# The threshold given in the problem.
threshold = fractions.Fraction(2, 3)

# Step 2: The limit is determined by comparing the density delta to the threshold.
# According to the Law of Large Numbers for the random set (the sausage),
# the relative area V_n converges to the constant density delta almost surely.
# So, lim P(V_n > threshold) = P(delta > threshold).
# Since delta and threshold are constants, this probability is either 0 or 1.

if delta > threshold:
    result = 1
else:
    result = 0

# Step 3: Print the final equation and the result.
# The problem asks to show each number in the final equation.
# The final "equation" is the logical comparison that determines the result.
