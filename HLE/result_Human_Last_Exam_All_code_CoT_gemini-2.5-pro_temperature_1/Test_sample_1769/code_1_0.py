    # Step 1: The current word "sister" comes from the Old Norse "systir".
    # This confirms its origin is from the Norse invaders.
    print("Analysis: The Modern English word 'sister' is a loanword from Old Norse 'systir'.")

    # Step 2: The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was "sweostor".
    # This is the word that would have evolved had it not been replaced.
    print("Fact: The native Old English word was 'sweostor'.")

    # Step 3: Trace the evolution. We can observe how other Old English words changed.
    # For example, OE mōdor -> ME moder -> ModE mother.
    # OE brōþor -> ME brother -> ModE brother.
    # Following this pattern, OE "sweostor" evolved into "suster" in Middle English.
    # This form, "suster", was in use but was eventually out-competed by "sister".
    print("Evolution: Old English 'sweostor' naturally evolved into Middle English 'suster'.")

    # Step 4: If "suster" had survived, it would be our modern word.
    # This is strongly supported by the cognate in modern Dutch, a close relative of English, which is "zuster".
    print("Evidence: The related Dutch language uses the word 'zuster', showing a similar evolutionary path.")
