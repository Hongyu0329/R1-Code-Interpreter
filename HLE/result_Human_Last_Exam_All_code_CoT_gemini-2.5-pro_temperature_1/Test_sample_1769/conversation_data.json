    "This is a fascinating question of historical linguistics. To figure out the answer, we need to trace the etymological roots of the words in question and project a linguistic path that never happened.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Identify the Current Word's Origin:** First, I'll confirm the origin of our modern word \"sister\" to establish that it is, in fact, a result of Norse interaction.\n2.  **Find the Original Anglo-Saxon Word:** I will find the native Old English word for \"sister\" that was used before the Viking Age.\n3.  **Trace its Likely Evolution:** I'll look at how other similar Old English words evolved into Modern English (e.g., `mōdor` -> `mother`). By applying these same phonetic and spelling changes to the original Old English word for \"sister,\" I can predict what its modern form would be.\n4.  **Provide Corroborating Evidence:** I will look at closely related Germanic languages, like Dutch or German, which were not as heavily influenced by Old Norse, to see what their word for \"sister\" is. This can provide strong evidence for our predicted word.\n5.  **Code the Explanation:** Finally, I will write a Python script that lays out this entire process and prints the final, predicted word.\n\n```python\ndef find_alternate_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines what the Modern English word for \"sister\" would be\n    if the Norse had not influenced the Anglo-Saxon language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: The current word \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse \"systir\".\n    # This confirms its origin is from the Norse invaders.\n    print(\"Analysis: The Modern English word 'sister' is a loanword from Old Norse 'systir'.\")\n\n    # Step 2: The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was \"sweostor\".\n    # This is the word that would have evolved had it not been replaced.\n    print(\"Fact: The native Old English word was 'sweostor'.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Trace the evolution. We can observe how other Old English words changed.\n    # For example, OE mōdor -> ME moder -> ModE mother.\n    # OE brōþor -> ME brother -> ModE brother.\n    # Following this pattern, OE \"sweostor\" evolved into \"suster\" in Middle English.\n    # This form, \"suster\", was in use but was eventually out-competed by \"sister\".\n    print(\"Evolution: Old English 'sweostor' naturally evolved into Middle English 'suster'.\")\n\n    # Step 4: If \"suster\" had survived, it would be our modern word.\n    # This is strongly supported by the cognate in modern Dutch, a close relative of English, which is \"zuster\".\n    print(\"Evidence: The related Dutch language uses the word 'zuster', showing a similar evolutionary path.\")\n    \n    hypothetical_word = \"suster\"\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion: Had the Norse never invaded, the native word would have survived, and the Modern English word for 'sister' would be:\")\n    print(f\"'{hypothetical_word}'\")\n\nfind_alternate_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
