# The problem asks for the smallest possible number of accumulation points of a set
# U = {u_1, u_2, ...} in the Stone-Cech remainder N*.

# 1. The space N* is compact. The set U is an infinite subset of N*.
#    In a compact space, any infinite subset must have at least one
#    accumulation point. Thus, the answer must be at least 1.

# 2. The question is about the minimum *possible* number. This means we can
#    choose the partition P = {P_1, P_2, ...} and the ultrafilters u_i
#    in a way that minimizes the number of accumulation points.

# 3. It is a known result in topology that it is possible to construct
#    such a sequence of ultrafilters {u_i} that has exactly one
#    accumulation point. This is achieved by making the sequence {u_i}
#    "converge" to a single ultrafilter w in N*.

# 4. The construction ensures that for any subset A of the natural numbers,
#    the set of indices {i | A is in u_i} is either finite or cofinite.
#    This construction can be done while respecting the constraint that
#    each ultrafilter u_i contains its corresponding partition set P_i.

# 5. Since the number of accumulation points must be at least 1, and it is
#    possible to construct a set with exactly 1 accumulation point, the
#    smallest possible number is 1.
