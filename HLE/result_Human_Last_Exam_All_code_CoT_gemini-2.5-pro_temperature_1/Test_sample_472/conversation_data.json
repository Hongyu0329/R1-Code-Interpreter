    "This line is from the Roman playwright Plautus and is an example of an \"iambic senarius,\" a common meter in Roman comedy. This meter consists of six iambic feet. However, Plautine meter is famously flexible, allowing for many substitutions and variations.\n\nHere is a step-by-step scansion:\n\n1.  **Original Line**: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n2.  **Elision**: The word `bene` ends with a vowel, and the next word `esse` begins with a vowel. The final `-e` of `bene` is elided (dropped), combining the words into `ben'esse`.\n3.  **Syllable Analysis**: We determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S) based on Latin pronunciation rules. A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel, a diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants. Otherwise, it is short.\n4.  **Foot Division**: The resulting sequence of long and short syllables is then divided into six metrical feet, following the patterns of an iambic senarius with common substitutions like trochees (L S) and anapests (S S L).\n\nThe scansion is as follows:\n*   **Foot 1**: `et ti` -> A trochee (L S). `et` is long by position.\n*   **Foot 2**: `bi es` -> An iamb (S L). `es-` (from `esse`) is long by position.\n*   **Foot 3**: `se so` -> A trochee (L S). `-se` (from `esse`) is long as its vowel is followed by the 's' in `esse` and the 's' in `soli`.\n*   **Foot 4**: `li quom` -> An iamb (S L). `quom` is long by position.\n*   **Foot 5**: `si bi sit` -> An anapest (S S L). `sit` is long by position.\n*   **Foot 6**: `ma le` -> A pyrrhic (S S). A common ending for a line in this meter.\n\nThis code will print the final scansion with each foot separated by a space.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the scansion of the given Latin line.\n    The line is an iambic senarius from Plautus.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    Feet are separated by a space.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The scansion is determined by analyzing elision, syllable weight, and metrical feet.\n    # The line is: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\"\n    # Elision: bene esse -> ben'esse\n    # Feet breakdown:\n    # 1. et ti | (L S) - Trochee\n    # 2. bi es | (S L) - Iamb\n    # 3. se so | (L S) - Trochee\n    # 4. li quom | (S L) - Iamb\n    # 5. si bi sit | (S S L) - Anapest\n    # 6. ma le | (S S) - Pyrrhic (brevis in longo)\n    \n    foot1 = \"L S\"\n    foot2 = \"S L\"\n    foot3 = \"L S\"\n    foot4 = \"S L\"\n    foot5 = \"S S L\"\n    foot6 = \"S S\"\n    \n    final_scansion = f\"{foot1} {foot2} {foot3} {foot4} {foot5} {foot6}\"\n    \n    print(final_scansion)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n<<<L S S L L S S L S S L S S>>>\n```"
