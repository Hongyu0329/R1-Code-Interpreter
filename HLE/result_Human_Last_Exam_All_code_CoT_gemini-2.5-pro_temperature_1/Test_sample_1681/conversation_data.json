    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will use the well-established Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This protocol introduces quantum effects, such as entanglement, into the classical game, which can lead to new and potentially better equilibrium outcomes.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Model Setup**: We'll model the game using the EWL protocol. The players' states are entangled using an entangling operator `J(γ)`, where `γ` is the measure of entanglement. We will set `γ = π/2`, which corresponds to a maximally entangled initial state. This is a standard choice in quantum game theory as it often eliminates the classical dilemma.\n\n2.  **Strategy Space**: The players' strategies are quantum operations. We'll analyze the game played between the quantum equivalents of \"Cooperate\" (C), represented by the Identity operator `I`, and \"Defect\" (D), represented by the operator `iσ_x`.\n\n3.  **Meta-Game Payoffs**: We will first calculate the payoffs for the four possible outcomes of this quantum game: (C,C), (C,D), (D,C), and (D,D). These payoffs are different from the classical game due to the quantum entanglement.\n\n4.  **Equilibrium Analysis**: With the `4x4` payoff matrix for the C/D \"meta-game\", we will find the Nash Equilibrium. For `γ = π/2`, this game has no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. Instead, it has a unique mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium, where each player chooses their strategy probabilistically.\n\n5.  **Calculate Equilibrium Point**: We will solve for the equilibrium probabilities and then calculate the expected payoff for a player at this equilibrium point. The script will show the final calculation for this payoff.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the equilibrium payoff.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_quantum_prisoners_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium payoff for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the EWL protocol with maximal entanglement.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
