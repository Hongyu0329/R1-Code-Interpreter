    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the equilibrium points:** We set the derivatives $d'(t)$ and $u'(t)$ to zero and solve for $(u, d)$.\n2.  **Analyze the stability of the equilibrium points:** We compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate its eigenvalues at each equilibrium point to classify them (e.g., as a node, source, or saddle point).\n3.  **Identify the separatrix:** A separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different long-term behavior. Separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We will look for a trajectory that corresponds to one of these manifolds.\n4.  **Find the equation of the separatrix:** We will search for an invariant curve (a trajectory) of the system that passes through the saddle point. A common technique is to look for a simple relationship between $d$ and $u$ that satisfies the system's phase plane equation $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'}{u'}$.\n\n**Step 1: Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1 - u)$\n$u'(t) = u^2(u - 1)$\n\nSet $u'(t) = 0$:\n$u^2(u - 1) = 0 \\implies u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   If $u = 0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$. So, $(0, 0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u = 1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (-3 + 5)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\implies 2d(d + 1) = 0$. This gives $d = 0$ or $d = -1$. So, $(1, 0)$ and $(1, -1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\nThe equilibrium points are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**Step 2: Stability Analysis**\n\nThe Jacobian matrix is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$.\n\n*   At $(1, 0)$: $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = 2$. Both are positive, so $(1, 0)$ is an unstable node (source).\n*   At $(1, -1)$: $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = -2$. The eigenvalues have opposite signs, so $(1, -1)$ is a **saddle point**.\n*   At $(0, 0)$: $\\lambda_1 = 0$ and $\\lambda_2 = 0$. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Find the Separatrix Equation**\n\nThe stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1, -1)$ are the separatrices. Let's find an equation for one of these manifolds by searching for an invariant curve. We can guess a relationship between $d$ and $u$. A good way to find such a relationship is to make a substitution to simplify the equation. Let's try the substitution $d(t) = v(t)u(t)^2$. Taking the derivative with respect to $t$:\n$d' = v'u^2 + v(2uu')$\n\nSubstitute $d=vu^2$, $d'$, and $u'$ into the first ODE:\n$v'u^2 + 2uvu' = 2(vu^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(vu^2) - u^3(1 - u)$\n$v'u^2 + 2uv(u^2(u-1)) = 2v^2u^4 + (5u^2 - 3u)vu^2 + u^3(u-1)$\nDividing by $u^2$ (for $u \\neq 0$):\n$v' + 2v(u(u-1)) = 2v^2u^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)v + u(u-1)$\n$v' + (2u^2-2u)v = 2v^2u^2 + (5u^2-3u)v + u^2-u$\n$v' = 2v^2u^2 + (3u^2-u)v + u^2-u$\n$v' = u^2(2v^2+3v+1) - u(v+1)$\n$v' = u^2(2v+1)(v+1) - u(v+1)$\n$v' = (v+1)[u^2(2v+1) - u]$\n\nThis differential equation for $v$ has an obvious equilibrium solution when $v+1=0$, which is $v=-1$.\nIf $v(t) = -1$ for all $t$, then $v'=0$, and the equation is satisfied.\nTranslating this back to the original variables:\n$d/u^2 = v = -1 \\implies d = -u^2$.\n\nThis equation $d = -u^2$ describes an invariant curve. Let's check if it passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\nIf $u=1$, then $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, it does.\nTherefore, the parabola $d = -u^2$ is one of the separatrices of the system (it is the unstable manifold of the saddle point). We can write its equation in the standard form $d+u^2=0$.\n\nThe following Python code prints this final equation, explicitly showing all numerical coefficients and powers.\n\n```python\ndef find_separatrix_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function describes the separatrix of the given system of ODEs.\n    The separatrix is found to be the curve d = -u**2, or d + u**2 = 0.\n    This script will print the equation in a fully explicit form.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The equation of the separatrix is d + u**2 = 0.\n    # We can write this in a general form c1*d**p1 + c2*u**p2 = c3\n    # where c are coefficients and p are powers.\n    d_coeff = 1\n    d_power = 1\n    u_coeff = 1\n    u_power = 2\n    rhs_constant = 0\n\n    # Print the equation with all numbers explicitly shown.\n    print(\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\n    print(f\"{d_coeff} * d**{d_power} + {u_coeff} * u**{u_power} = {rhs_constant}\")\n\nfind_separatrix_equation()\n```\n<<<The equation for the separatrix is:\n1 * d**1 + 1 * u**2 = 0\n>>>"
