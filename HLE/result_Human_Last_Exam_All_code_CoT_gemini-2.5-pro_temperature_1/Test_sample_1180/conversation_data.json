    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the curve and the valuation.**\n    The curve is given by the equation $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We are working over a 2-adic field, i.e., a field $K$ complete with respect to a valuation $v$ normalized such that $v(2)=1$. The genus of the curve is $g=2$, as it is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$ with $\\deg(f)=5 = 2g+1$.\n\n2.  **Determine the valuations of the roots of the polynomial $f(x) = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$.**\n    The structure of the stable reduction is determined by the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $f(x)$. We can use the Newton polygon method for this. The Newton polygon of $f(x)$ is constructed using the points $(i, v(c_i))$, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\n    The non-zero coefficients of $f(x)$ are $c_5=2$, $c_3=2$, and $c_0=1$.\n    Their 2-adic valuations are $v(c_5)=v(2)=1$, $v(c_3)=v(2)=1$, and $v(c_0)=v(1)=0$.\n    The points for the Newton polygon are $(5, 1)$, $(3, 1)$, and $(0, 0)$.\n    The lower convex hull of these points is the single line segment connecting $(0, 0)$ and $(5, 1)$. To verify this, we check that the point $(3, 1)$ lies on or above this segment. The line connecting $(0,0)$ and $(5,1)$ is $y = x/5$. At $x=3$, the height is $3/5$. Since $1 > 3/5$, the point $(3,1)$ is above the segment.\n    The Newton polygon has one segment with slope $m = (1-0)/(5-0) = 1/5$. The valuations of the roots are given by the negative of the slopes. Thus, all 5 roots $\\alpha_i$ of $f(x)$ have the same valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the clustering of the roots.**\n    Since all roots have the same valuation, they might form one or more clusters. To distinguish them, we need to check their residues in an appropriate extension field.\n    The valuation $v(\\alpha_i) = -1/5$ implies we need to work in a ramified extension $K$ of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ of degree at least 5. Let $\\pi$ be a uniformizer in $K$ such that $\\pi^5 = 2u$ for some unit $u$. We can normalize so that $\\pi^5=2$, which gives $v(\\pi)=1/5$.\n    Let $\\alpha = \\pi^{-1} y$. Since $v(\\alpha)=-1/5$ and $v(\\pi^{-1})=-1/5$, we must have $v(y)=0$, so $y$ is a unit in the ring of integers of $K$.\n    Substituting $x = \\pi^{-1} y$ into the polynomial equation $f(x)=0$:\n    $2(\\pi^{-1}y)^5 + 2(\\pi^{-1}y)^3 + 1 = 0$\n    $\\pi^5 (\\pi^{-5}y^5) + \\pi^5 (\\pi^{-3}y^3) + 1 = 0$\n    $y^5 + \\pi^2 y^3 + 1 = 0$\n    To find the clustering of the roots $y_i$, we reduce this equation modulo $\\pi$:\n    $\\bar{y}^5 + 1 = 0 \\implies (\\bar{y}+1)^5 = 0$ in the residue field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n    This means all five roots $y_i$ have the same residue $\\bar{y_i}=1$.\n    Therefore, for any two roots $\\alpha_i, \\alpha_j$, we have $v(\\alpha_i - \\alpha_j) = v(\\pi^{-1}(y_i-y_j)) = v(\\pi^{-1}) + v(y_i-y_j) = -1/5 + v(y_i-y_j)$. Since $\\bar{y_i}=\\bar{y_j}=1$, $v(y_i-y_j)>0$. So, $v(\\alpha_i-\\alpha_j) > -1/5$.\n    This shows that all roots belong to a single cluster.\n\n4.  **Use the conductor formula to find the thickness.**\n    The conductor formula relates the valuation of the discriminant of the curve to the geometry of its stable reduction. The formula is $v(\\Delta_C) = \\delta + \\epsilon$.\n    -   $\\Delta_C$ is the discriminant of the curve. For a curve $z^2=f(x)$ of genus $g$, $\\Delta_C$ is related to the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$ by $\\Delta_C = 2^{4(g-1)}\\text{disc}(f)$. Here $g=2$, so $\\Delta_C = 2^4 \\text{disc}(f)$.\n    -   The discriminant of $f(x) = 2x^5+2x^3+1$ is $\\text{disc}(f) = 58192 = 16 \\cdot 3637 = 2^4 \\cdot 3637$.\n    -   The valuation of the polynomial discriminant is $v(\\text{disc}(f)) = v(2^4 \\cdot 3637) = 4$.\n    -   The valuation of the curve's discriminant is $v(\\Delta_C) = v(2^4 \\cdot \\text{disc}(f)) = v(2^4) + v(\\text{disc}(f)) = 4 + 4 = 8$.\n    -   $\\delta$ is the number of components in the special fiber of the stable reduction, minus one. Since the roots of $f(x)$ form a single cluster, the special fiber is irreducible. Thus, the number of components is 1, and $\\delta = 1-1=0$.\n    -   $\\epsilon$ is the sum of the thicknesses of the singular points of the special fiber.\n    \n    Plugging these values into the conductor formula:\n    $8 = 0 + \\epsilon$\n    So, $\\epsilon = 8$.\n    The problem asks for the thickness of \"the\" double point, implying there is a single singular point which is a node (a double point). The thickness of this double point is therefore 8.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This program calculates the thickness of the double point of the stable reduction of the curve z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.\n    \n    Plan:\n    1.
