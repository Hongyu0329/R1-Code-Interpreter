    "To solve this problem, we need to find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring $H^*(Gr(3, 5); \\mathbb{Z})$, where $Gr(3, 5)$ is the Grassmannian of 3-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object and properties:** The space is the real Grassmannian $Gr(3, 5)$. The total dimension of this manifold is $k(n-k) = 3(5-3) = 6$. The integral cohomology of real Grassmannians is known to have only 2-torsion (every torsion element $x$ satisfies $2x=0$).\n2.  **Relate Torsion to Betti Numbers:** We can relate the rank of the torsion subgroup to the Betti numbers over different fields using the Universal Coefficient Theorem. Let $d_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}_2} H_i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z}_2)$ be the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-Betti numbers, and $\\beta_i = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}} H_i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$ be the standard Betti numbers. Let $t_i$ be the rank of the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-torsion subgroup of $H_i(Gr(3,5); \\mathbb{Z})$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem provides the relation: $d_i = \\beta_i + t_i + t_{i-1}$.\n3.  **Sum over all dimensions:** Summing this relation over all dimensions $i$ gives $\\sum d_i = \\sum \\beta_i + 2 \\sum t_i$. The total rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral *cohomology* is $\\sum_i \\text{rank}(T^i) = \\sum_i t_{i-1} = \\sum_j t_j$. Let's call this total rank $T = \\sum t_i$. Then, we have the formula:\n    $T = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\sum_i d_i - \\sum_i \\beta_i \\right)$.\n4.  **Compute Betti numbers using Schubert Calculus:** Both $\\sum d_i$ and $\\sum \\beta_i$ can be computed combinatorially using Schubert calculus. The Schubert cells provide a basis for homology.\n    *   The total number of Schubert cells is $\\sum d_i$. The cells are indexed by partitions $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that fit into a $k \\times (n-k)$ box, i.e., $n-k \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\dots \\ge \\lambda_k \\ge 0$.\n    *   The sum of the Betti numbers, $\\sum \\beta_i$, is the number of such partitions where all parts $\\lambda_j$ are even.\n5.  **Implement the calculation in Python:** Write a Python script to enumerate the partitions, count the required quantities, and compute the final rank.\n\nWe will now implement this plan. For $Gr(3, 5)$, we have $k=3$ and $n=5$, so the partitions must fit in a $3 \\times 2$ box ($2 \\ge \\lambda_1 \\ge \\lambda_2 \\ge \\lambda_3 \\ge 0$).\n\n```python\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, i.e., Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 3\n    n = 5\n    n_minus_k = n - k\n\n    partitions = []\n    # Generate all partitions lambda = (l1, l2, l3) such that\n    # n-k >= l1 >= l2 >= l3 >= 0.\n    for l1 in range(n_minus_k, -1, -1):\n        for l2 in range(l1, -1, -1):\n            for l3 in range(l2, -1, -1):\n                partitions.append((l1, l2, l3))\n\n    # Total number of Schubert cells, which is the sum of Z_2-Betti numbers.\n    sum_d_i = len(partitions)\n\n    # Count partitions where all parts are even.
