    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: I will first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. A standard method for this is Eisenstein's criterion. If the polynomial is irreducible, its Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial helps determine the nature of the Galois group. The formula for the discriminant of a depressed quartic $x^4 + qx + r$ is $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: The resolvent cubic is another polynomial derived from the original quartic. Its reducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides more information to classify the Galois group. For a quartic $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n4.  **Determine the Group and its Order**: By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, I can pinpoint the specific Galois group and thus find its order. The main rules are:\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a square and the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $S_4$ (order 24).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is not a square and the resolvent is reducible, the group is $D_4$ (order 8).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a square and the resolvent is irreducible, the group is $A_4$ (order 12).\n    *   If $\\Delta$ is a square and the resolvent is reducible, the group is $V_4$ (order 4).\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print out the steps and the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # In the form x^4 + px^2 + qx + r, we have p=0, q=8, r=14.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the polynomial f(x) = x^4 + {q}x + {r}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility using Eisenstein's Criterion\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for Irreducibility\")\n    prime = 2\n    print(f\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = {prime}:\")\n    print(f\"1.
