    Determines the most realistic upper bound for 4-agent connected epsilon-envy-free cake cutting.
    
    This problem concerns the query complexity (number of cuts or queries) of envy-free cake cutting.
    For a long time, no algorithm with a bounded number of cuts was known for the exact
    envy-free problem with connected pieces for n=4 agents.
    
    However, a major breakthrough in 2022 by Arash Hakim and Sina Seddighin in their paper
    "A Finite and Bounded Protocol for Four-Agent Envy-Free Cake Cutting" resolved this.
    They presented the first protocol that guarantees an *exact* envy-free allocation with
    connected pieces for four agents using a finite number of cuts.

    Their protocol established a new upper bound, O. An exact envy-free allocation is, by
    definition, also an epsilon-envy-free allocation for any epsilon > 0. Therefore, this
    bound is the most realistic and state-of-the-art upper bound for the problem stated.
