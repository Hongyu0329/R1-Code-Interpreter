    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Knots:** First, we list all unique knots with four or fewer crossings. These are the unknot (0_1), the trefoil knot (3_1), and the figure-eight knot (4_1). Note that we don't need to consider mirror images separately, as the elements they generate are already accounted for when considering both +1 and -1 surgeries.\n\n2.  **Analyze Surgeries:** For each knot K, we consider the homology 3-spheres obtained by integral surgery, S³_1(K) and S³_-1(K). These represent elements in the homology cobordism group Θ³_H.\n\n3.  **Use Invariants to Distinguish Elements:** We use two key properties to count the number of distinct elements:\n    *   **Trivial Element:** If a knot's Alexander polynomial is 1 (i.e., Δ_K(t) = 1), then any integral surgery on it results in the standard 3-sphere, S³, which is the identity element in the group.\n    *   **Order of Elements:** The Rokhlin invariant (μ) of the resulting manifold determines if the element is of order 2. For a surgery manifold S³_±1(K), the Rokhlin invariant is equal to the knot's Arf invariant. An element `g` in Θ³_H has order 2 (meaning `g = -g`) if and only if its Rokhlin invariant is 1. If μ=0, the element is not of order 2, and `g` and its inverse `-g` are distinct.\n\n4.  **Count the Elements:** We apply this analysis to each knot and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan, explaining the contribution of each knot to the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homology_cobordism():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of homology cobordism group elements\n    represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of elements in the homology cobordism group from knots with at most 4 crossings.\")\n    print(\"The knots to consider are the Unknot (0_1), Trefoil (3_1), and Figure-eight (4_1).\\n\")\n\n    # --- Knot 0_1 (Unknot) ---\n    print(\"Analysis for the Unknot (0_1):\")\n    print(\"  - The Unknot's Alexander polynomial is 1.\")\n    print(\"  - Integral surgery on such a knot always yields the 3-sphere, S^3.\")\n    print(\"  - S^3 represents the trivial (identity) element of the group.\")\n    count_0_1 = 1\n    print(f\"  - Contribution: {count_0_1} element.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Knot 3_1 (Trefoil) ---\n    print(\"Analysis for the Trefoil knot (3_1):\")\n    print(\"  - The Trefoil's Alexander polynomial is not 1, so surgeries yield non-trivial elements.\")\n    print(\"  - The Arf invariant of the Trefoil is 1.\")\n    print(\"  - The Rokhlin invariant of the resulting manifold is therefore 1.\")\n    print(\"  - An element with a Rokhlin invariant of 1 has order 2 in the group.\")\n    print(\"  - This means the elements from +1 and -1 surgery are the same.\")\n    count_3_1 = 1\n    print(f\"  - Contribution: {count_3_1} element.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Knot 4_1 (Figure-eight) ---\n    print(\"Analysis for the Figure-eight knot (4_1):\")\n    print(\"  - The Figure-eight's Alexander polynomial is not 1, so surgeries yield non-trivial elements.\")\n    print(\"  - The Arf invariant of the Figure-eight knot is 0.\")\n    print(\"  - The Rokhlin invariant of the resulting manifold is therefore 0.\")\n    print(\"  - An element with a Rokhlin invariant of 0 is not of order 2.\")\n    print(\"  - This means the elements from +1 surgery (h) and -1 surgery (-h) are distinct.\")\n    count_4_1 = 2\n    print(f\"  - Contribution: {count_4_1} elements.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Final Calculation ---\n    total_elements = count_0_1 + count_3_1 + count_4_1\n    print(\"The elements generated by these different knots are known to be distinct.\")\n    print(\"The total number of elements is the sum of the contributions from each knot.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {count_0_1} (from Unknot) + {count_3_1} (from Trefoil) + {count_4_1} (from Figure-eight) = {total_elements}\")\n\n\nsolve_homology_cobordism()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
