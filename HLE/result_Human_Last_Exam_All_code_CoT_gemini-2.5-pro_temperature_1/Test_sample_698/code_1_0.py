# Description:
# This script determines the correct "True Avalanche" for the given description.
# A True Avalanche is a punny sentence that establishes a pattern of syllables
# and then repeats those syllables in the same order.

# The description is: "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
# The avalanche must use the word "computer".

# The syllables of "computer" are com-pu-ter.

# The correct answer is "Computer: 'Come poo, tern!'".
# Let's break down why it's the correct choice:
# 1. Syllable Repetition: The phrase "Come poo, tern" is a phonetic repetition of "com-pu-ter".
# 2. Description Match: A "computer" tells a "tern" (a type of bird) to "poo" (relieve itself).
# This perfectly matches the scenario.

description = "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."
answer_choice = "B"
answer_text = 'Computer: "Come poo, tern!"'
