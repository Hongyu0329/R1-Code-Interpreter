        ("1. The Cause of Tunneling in Ammonia",
         "   - The tunneling effect in a standard ammonia (NH3) molecule is a quantum phenomenon.\n"
         "   - It arises because the molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape, and the nitrogen atom can be on one of two sides of the plane formed by the three hydrogen atoms.\n"
         "   - This creates a 'double-well' potential energy profile. Tunneling is the process of the nitrogen atom passing through the energy barrier separating these two wells."),

        ("2. The Role of Nuclear Spin vs. Electronic Structure",
         "   - The shape of the potential energy surface is determined by the electrostatic forces between the electrons and the atomic nuclei.\n"
         "   - The problem states that exotic hydrogen differs from ordinary hydrogen *only* in its nuclear spin (spin 0 instead of spin 1/2).\n"
         "   - Since properties like charge and mass are unchanged, the electronic structure and therefore the potential energy surface are identical for both normal and exotic ammonia."),

        ("3. The Pauli Principle and Particle Statistics",
         "   - The key difference lies in the quantum statistics of the nuclei.\n"
         "   - Ordinary hydrogen nuclei (protons) have spin 1/2 and are 'fermions'.\n"
         "   - Exotic hydrogen nuclei have spin 0 and are 'bosons'.\n"
         "   - The Pauli Exclusion Principle requires the total wavefunction to have a specific symmetry when identical particles are exchanged: 'antisymmetric' for fermions and 'symmetric' for bosons."),

        ("4. Conclusion",
         "   - The change in particle statistics from fermion to boson alters which specific rotational and vibrational energy levels are allowed by quantum mechanics. It changes the statistical weights and selection rules.\n"
         "   - However, it does NOT change the underlying potential energy surface that *causes* the tunneling.\n"
         "   - Since the double-well potential still exists, the fundamental condition for tunneling is met.")
