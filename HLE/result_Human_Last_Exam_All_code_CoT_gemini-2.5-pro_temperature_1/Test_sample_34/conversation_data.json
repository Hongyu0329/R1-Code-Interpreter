    "This is a poker theory question that can be answered by consulting a standard pre-flop opening range chart for a 100BB cash game. My plan is to determine the correct hand based on this established poker strategy and then write a Python script to present the answer.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The scenario is a 100BB rake-free cash game. The action is an open-raise from the button (BTN). The button is the most profitable position in poker, so the opening range is very wide (often 40-50% of all possible hands).\n2.  **Identify the Hand Category:** We are looking for hands of the type \"JXs\", which means a Jack paired with another card of the same suit.\n3.  **Consult a Standard Opening Range:** In a standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) or solid exploitative strategy, the button opens all suited Jacks. This includes JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. These hands are valuable due to their ability to make strong flushes and pairs.\n4.  **Determine the \"Worst\" Hand:** The \"worst\" hand within a profitable opening range is the one with the lowest expected value (EV) that is still considered a standard open. For suited hands, this is almost always the one with the lowest kicker, as it has the weakest pair potential and lowest raw equity.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Comparing all the suited Jacks (JTs down to J2s), the hand with the lowest kicker is J2s (Jack-Two suited). Therefore, J2s is the worst suited jack that is still a standard, profitable open from the button in this scenario.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The Python code will define the components of the hand (the Jack, the lowest kicker, and the suited modifier) and then combine them to print the final abbreviated hand name.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_opening_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open-raise from the button\n    in a standard 100BB cash game, based on established poker theory.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In poker hand notation, a hand is defined by its cards.\n    # We are looking for a hand containing a Jack.\n    main_card = \"J\"\n\n    # A standard button opening range includes all suited Jacks.\n    # The strength of these hands is determined by the second card, or \"kicker\".\n    # The suited Jacks in this range are JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n    # The \"worst\" of these hands is the one with the lowest kicker.\n    worst_kicker = \"2\"\n\n    # The 's' indicates that the two cards are of the same suit.\n    suit_type = \"s\"\n\n    # We combine these components to form the final hand abbreviation.\n    # The final equation is effectively: main_card + worst_kicker + suit_type\n    final_hand = main_card + worst_kicker + suit_type\n\n    print(f\"The main card is: {main_card}\")\n    print(f\"The lowest kicker in the standard opening range for this hand type is: {worst_kicker}\")\n    print(f\"The modifier for a suited hand is: {suit_type}\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(f\"The worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {final_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_opening_hand()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
