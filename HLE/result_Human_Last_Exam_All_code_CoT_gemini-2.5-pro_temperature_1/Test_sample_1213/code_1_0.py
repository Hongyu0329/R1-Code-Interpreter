The Go board contains the following stones:
Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

White's objective is to kill a black group.

1.  **Analysis of the Position:**
    The black stones are split into two groups:
    - Group 1: {C1, C2}. This group is weak and has only two liberties at B1 and B2.
    - Group 2: {A2, B3, B4}. This group is stronger.
    The two groups are not connected, but they can be connected if Black plays at the vital point B2. If they connect, they form a large group that is much harder to kill. White's strategy must focus on attacking the weak group and/or preventing the connection.

2.  **Candidate Moves and Kill Sequences:**
    The key points for White to play are A1, B1, and B2. We will analyze each:

    *   **Move 1: White at B2**
        This is a "divide and conquer" strategy.
        - White plays at B2. This prevents the two black groups from connecting.
        - The black group {C1, C2} is now in *atari*, with its last liberty at B1.
        - Black's only move to save the group is to play at B1.
        - After Black plays B1, the new group {B1, C1, C2} is immediately in *atari* again, with its last liberty at A1.
        - White plays A1, capturing the {B1, C1, C2} group. This is a successful kill sequence.

    *   **Move 2: White at B1**
        This move attacks a liberty directly, forcing a response.
        - White plays at B1. This puts the {C1, C2} group in *atari*, with its last liberty at B2.
        - Black is forced to play at B2 to connect the two groups and escape immediate capture.
        - This creates a large, connected black group {A2, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2}.
        - However, this new group has only three external liberties (A1, A3, A4) and cannot form two eyes inside its territory.
        - White, to play, can systematically fill these liberties (e.g., W at A1, then A3, then A4), and Black has no way to stop the entire group from being captured. This is a successful kill sequence.

    *   **Move 3: White at A1**
        This is a more indirect, but equally effective, approach.
        - White plays at A1.
        - Black's best response is to connect the groups by playing at B2.
        - As with the W@B1 case, this results in a large black group {A2, B2, B3, B4, C1, C2}.
        - This group is surrounded by White stones (including the new one at A1) and has only three external liberties (B1, A3, A4). It cannot make two eyes.
        - White can proceed to fill these liberties and capture the entire group. This is a successful kill sequence.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    All three moves—A1, B1, and B2—initiate a sequence of moves where Black has no effective response to prevent one or more of its groups from being captured.

The moves that initiate a kill sequence are:
