    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use an extension of the Euclidean algorithm. The method involves forming an augmented matrix by stacking P1 and P2, and then reducing this matrix using elementary row operations until it is in a block form `[G; 0]`, where G is a 2x2 matrix and 0 is the 2x2 zero matrix. The resulting matrix G will be a GCRD of P1 and P2.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Form the Augmented Matrix**: Create a 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    M = [P1; P2]\n2.  **Perform Elementary Row Operations**: Apply a sequence of elementary row operations to `M`. These operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Reduce to GCRD Form**: The goal is to transform `M` so that its bottom two rows become all zeros. The top two non-zero rows will then form the GCRD matrix, `G`.\n4.  **Extract the GCRD**: The final 2x2 matrix `G` is the greatest common right divisor. Note that the GCRD is unique only up to pre-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant).\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two\n    polynomial matrices, P1 and P2, using the Euclidean algorithm via\n    elementary row operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # Form the augmented matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n\n    # --- Perform elementary row operations to find the GCRD ---\n    # The goal is to obtain the form [G; 0] where G is the GCRD.\n    # We will use sympy.simplify to ensure expressions are tidy after each step.\n\n    # Let M have rows R1, R2, R3, R4.\n    # The row with a constant '1' (R4) is a good pivot, but let's make its\n    # first element a constant first for easier pivoting.\n    # Operation 1: R4 -> R4 + R3\n    # [-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-1, 1]\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + M[2, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # Now, use the new R4 = [-1, 1] to eliminate the first column in other rows.\n    # Operation 2: R1 -> R1 + (s**2 + s) * R4\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2 + s) * M[3, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # Operation 3: R2 -> R2 - (s**2 + 1) * R4\n    M[1, :] = M[1, :] - (s**2 + 1) * M[3, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # Operation 4: R3 -> R3 + s * R4\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + s * M[3, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # At this point, M has its first column zeroed out except for the last row.\n    # M is now: [ 0, s**2; 0, -1; 0, s; -1, 1 ]\n    # Use the new R2 = [0, -1] as the next pivot to eliminate the second column.\n\n    # Operation 5: R1 -> R1 + s**2 * R2\n    M[0, :] = M[0, :] + (s**2) * M[1, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # Operation 6: R3 -> R3 + s * R2\n    M[2, :] = M[2, :] + s * M[1, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # Operation 7: R4 -> R4 + 1 * R2\n    M[3, :] = M[3, :] + M[1, :]\n    M = sympy.simplify(M)\n\n    # The matrix M is now reduced to have two zero rows.\n    # The non-zero rows are R2 = [0, -1] and R4 = [-1, 0].\n    # We can form the GCRD by taking these two rows.\n    G = sympy.Matrix([M[3,:], M[1,:]])\n\n    # The result is a GCRD. Note that multiplying any row by -1 (a unimodular op)\n    # also gives a valid GCRD.
