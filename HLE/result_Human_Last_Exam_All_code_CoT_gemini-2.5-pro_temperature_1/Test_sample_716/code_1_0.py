# The user wants to find the Hausdorff dimension of the curve parametrized by:
# x(t) = sin(pi * t)
# y(t) = sin(t)
# z(t) = cos(2t)

# Step 1: Understand Hausdorff Dimension
# The Hausdorff dimension is a mathematical concept that generalizes the notion of dimension to any metric space.
# For simple geometric shapes, it matches our intuition: a point has dimension 0, a line has dimension 1,
# a surface has dimension 2, and so on. Fractals can have non-integer dimensions.

# Step 2: Analyze the curve's properties
# The vector function for the curve is r(t) = <sin(pi*t), sin(t), cos(2t)>.
# The component functions x(t), y(t), and z(t) are all infinitely differentiable (smooth)
# trigonometric functions. This means the curve itself is smooth.

# Step 3: Check if the curve is "regular"
# A curve is regular if its tangent vector (the derivative of the position vector) is never the zero vector.
# Let's find the derivative r'(t):
# r'(t) = <d/dt(sin(pi*t)), d/dt(sin(t)), d/dt(cos(2t))>
# r'(t) = <pi * cos(pi*t), cos(t), -2 * sin(2t)>
#
# For r'(t) to be the zero vector <0, 0, 0>, all three components must be zero simultaneously.
# 1) pi * cos(pi*t) = 0  => pi*t = pi/2 + n*pi => t = 1/2 + n for some integer n.
# 2) cos(t) = 0          => t = pi/2 + k*pi for some integer k.
#
# We would need to find a t such that 1/2 + n = pi/2 + k*pi.
# This equation cannot be solved for integers n and k because pi is an irrational number.
# Therefore, the tangent vector r'(t) is never the zero vector. The curve is regular.

# Step 4: Apply the theorem for the Hausdorff dimension of regular curves
# A fundamental theorem in geometric measure theory states that any rectifiable curve has a Hausdorff dimension of 1.
# A curve is rectifiable if it has a finite arc length over any finite interval.
# All continuously differentiable (C^1) regular curves are rectifiable.
#
# Since our curve is smooth (infinitely differentiable) and regular, it is rectifiable.

# Step 5: Conclusion
# The Hausdorff dimension of this curve is 1. The fact that the curve might self-intersect
# does not change its dimension because it is fundamentally a one-dimensional object (a manifold of dimension 1).

# Final Answer Calculation
# The problem is conceptual, and the answer is derived from mathematical theorems, not a numerical computation.
# The final equation is simply: Hausdorff Dimension = 1
hausdorff_dimension = 1
