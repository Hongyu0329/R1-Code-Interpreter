    "The fictitious molecule \"mercedesbenzene\" gets its name from a combination of \"Mercedes\" and \"benzene\". The Mercedes-Benz logo features a three-pointed star. A benzene molecule is a ring of 6 carbon atoms.\n\nTherefore, the most common chemical interpretation of \"mercedesbenzene\" is a molecule that combines these ideas: a structure with three-fold symmetry made from benzene rings. This leads us to the molecule triphenylene (C₁₈H₁₂).\n\nMy plan is to calculate the total number of carbon atoms in triphenylene by visualizing it as a central benzene ring with three additional benzene rings fused onto it.\n\n1.  Start with a central benzene ring, which has 6 carbon atoms.\n2.  Fuse the first of the three \"star point\" rings. When a benzene ring is fused, it shares two carbon atoms, so it only adds 4 new carbons to the total count.\n3.  Fuse the second and third rings similarly, each adding 4 more carbons.\n4.  Sum the carbons from the central ring and the three fused rings to get the total.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_mercedesbenzene_carbons():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of carbon atoms in the fictitious molecule\n    \"mercedesbenzene\", interpreted as the chemical compound triphenylene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A central benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms.\n    central_ring = 6\n    \n    # The three \"points\" of the Mercedes star are interpreted as three\n    # additional benzene rings fused to the central ring.\n    # When a ring is fused, it shares 2 carbons, so it adds 4 new carbons.\n    first_fused_ring_added_carbons = 4\n    second_fused_ring_added_carbons = 4\n    third_fused_ring_added_carbons = 4\n\n    # Sum the carbons to find the total.\n    total_carbons = central_ring + first_fused_ring_added_carbons + second_fused_ring_added_carbons + third_fused_ring_added_carbons\n\n    # Print the final equation showing each number.\n    print(\"The molecule is interpreted as triphenylene, which consists of a central ring and three fused rings.\")\n    print(\"The total number of carbons is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{central_ring} + {first_fused_ring_added_carbons} + {second_fused_ring_added_carbons} + {third_fused_ring_added_carbons} = {total_carbons}\")\n\ncalculate_mercedesbenzene_carbons()\n```\n<<<18>>>"
