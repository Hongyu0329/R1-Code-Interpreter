    "To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will write a Python script that performs prime factorization.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  I will implement a trial division algorithm to find all the prime factors of the number 8139881.\n2.  The algorithm will first check for divisibility by 2. Then, it will check for divisibility by odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on) up to the square root of the remaining number.\n3.  Each time a prime factor is found, it's added to a list, and the original number is divided by this factor.\n4.  If any number remains after checking all factors up to the square root, this remaining number is itself a prime factor (and the largest one).\n5.  After finding all prime factors, the script will construct an equation showing the factorization and then print the largest factor from the list.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime factors of a given integer n, prints the factorization equation,\n    and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor of 2\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors starting from 3\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        i += 2\n\n    # This condition is for the case where n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2. The remaining n is the last prime factor.\n    if n > 2:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # If the original number was 0, 1, or prime, handle the factors list\n    if not factors and original_n > 1:\n        factors.append(original_n)\n        \n    # Find the largest prime divisor from the list of factors\n    if factors:\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n    else:\n        # This handles cases like n=0, n=1\n        largest_prime = \"N/A\"\n\n    # Print the results as requested\n    print(f\"Finding the largest prime divisor of {original_n}:\")\n    \n    # Construct and print the equation\n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"The number {original_n} has no prime factors.\")\n    else:\n        equation_str = f\"{original_n} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(\"The prime factorization is:\")\n        print(equation_str)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n    return largest_prime\n\n# The number from the user\nnumber_to_factor = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_factor)\n\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
