    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of linearly independent commutators of order 10 that can be formed from two non-commuting variables, let's call them X and Y. This number corresponds to the dimension of the degree-10 homogeneous subspace of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\nThis dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 in our case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators (X and Y), so `k = 2`.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the calculation:\n1.  **Identify parameters:** `n = 10`, `k = 2`.\n2.  **Find divisors:** Find all positive divisors `d` of `n=10`. The divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  **Calculate Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor:**\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is a single prime)\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = 1` (10 is a product of two distinct primes)\n4.  **Apply Witt's formula:** Substitute the values into the formula and calculate the sum.\n    `L_2(10) = (1/10) * [μ(1)*2^(10/1) + μ(2)*2^(10/2) + μ(5)*2^(10/5) + μ(10)*2^(10/10)]`\n5.  **Compute the final result.**\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print out each step of the formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) returns {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while (temp_num % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0 # Has a squared prime factor\n            \n    # n is square-free, return (-1)^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coeffs(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in BCH expansion\n    for k generators using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero coefficients of order n={n} for k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's Formula: L_k(n) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} mu(d) * k^(n/d)\")\n    \n    # Build the formula string for display\n    formula_parts = []\n    value_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        formula_parts.append(f\"μ({d})*{k}^({n}/{d})\")\n        value_parts.append(f\"({mu_d})*({k**power})\")\n        \n    formula_str = \" + \".join(formula_parts)\n    values_str = \" + \".join(value_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"\\nL_{k}({n}) = (1/{n}) * ( {formula_str} )\")\n    print(f\"       = (1/{n}) * ( {values_str} )\")\n    print(f\"       = (1/{n}) * ( {total_sum} )\")\n    \n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    print(f\"       = {result}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n\n# Main execution\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    order_n = 10\n    generators_k = 2\n    solve_bch_coeffs(order_n, generators_k)\n```\n<<<99>>>"
