# The problem describes a translation challenge involving language-specific homophones,
# which are central to the plots of certain mystery stories.
# The goal is to identify which translation practices can successfully address this.
#
# Option I, Transcreation, involves creating a new, analogous pun in the target
# language. This is a valid and effective solution.
#
# Option VI, using footnotes, allows the translator to explicitly explain the
# original English pun to the reader. This also solves the problem of comprehension,
# making it a valid solution.
#
# The other options are not suitable: audio links (II) fail to provide a self-contained
# translation; changing the setting (III) or adding an accent (IV) doesn't solve the
# core linguistic issue; and a picture (V) cannot illustrate an auditory pun.
#
# Therefore, the capable practices are I and VI.
# The required output format is a series of Roman numerals in ascending order,
# separated by hyphens.

option_1 = "I"
option_6 = "VI"

# The final answer combines the identified options in the specified format.
# The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is interpreted as
# a requirement to show the components of the final answer string.
print(f"{option_1}-{option_6}")
