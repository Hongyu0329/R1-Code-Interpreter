The total mass density profile rho(z) is determined.
It can be accurately approximated by a linear equation of the form: rho(z) = A + B * z

The coefficients of the equation are:
A = 0.222304 kg/m^3  (Density at the bottom, z=0)
B = -1.530386e-05 kg/m^4  (Gradient of the density)

Density at specific heights:
rho(z=0.0 m)  = 0.222304 kg/m^3
rho(z=5.1 m)  = 0.222226 kg/m^3
rho(z=10.0 m) = 0.222151 kg/m^3
