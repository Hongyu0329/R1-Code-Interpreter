    # [X] >= dim(X) + 1

    # The Lebesgue covering dimension of the d-dimensional cube [0,1]^d is d.

    # for which X is n-compact for some n.
    # A standard result (related to O'Connor's lemma) shows that the cube [0,1]^d
    # is (d+1)-compact. This is established using the sub-basis of sets of the
    # form {x | x_i < a} and {x | x_i > b}.
    # This means the minimum value, [X], must be less than or equal to d+1.
