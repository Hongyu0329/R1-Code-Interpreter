    "My plan is to identify the specific couplets (bayt) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that enumerate the names of the prophets. The enumeration of the 25 prophets starts with an introductory line and is then followed by the list of names spread across several couplets. I will determine the starting and ending bayt numbers for this entire section.\n\nThen, I will write a Python script that:\n1.  Stores the starting and ending bayt numbers in variables.\n2.  Prints a clear sentence stating the range of these bayts.\n3.  To provide a more detailed answer, the script will then list the contents of each specific bayt within that range, showing which prophets are mentioned in which line. This will satisfy the condition to \"output each number\".\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_bayt():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the bayts (couplets) in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam'\n    that list the names of the Prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    start_bayt = 34\n    end_bayt = 38\n\n    print(f\"The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt {start_bayt} to bayt {end_bayt}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe breakdown is as follows:\")\n\n    prophets_list = {\n        34: \"An introduction stating that the details of 25 prophets are binding.\",\n        35: \"Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, Salih, and Ibrahim.\",\n        36: \"Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, as well as Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\",\n        37: \"Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, Al-Yasa', Dhul-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\",\n        38: \"Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (Prophet Muhammad, the seal).\"\n    }\n\n    for bayt, names in prophets_list.items():\n        print(f\"Bayt {bayt}: {names}\")\n\nfind_prophets_bayt()\n```\n<<<The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt 34 to bayt 38.>>>"
