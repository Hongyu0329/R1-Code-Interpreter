    print("If a particle is in the interval [-1, 1] (b), it is necessarily in the interval [-1, 3] (c).")

    print("  - This means the proposition (a ∧ b) implies (a ∧ c).")
    print("  - When one proposition implies another, their disjunction ('or') is equivalent to the more general proposition.")
    print("  - Therefore, (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) simplifies to (a ∧ c).")
