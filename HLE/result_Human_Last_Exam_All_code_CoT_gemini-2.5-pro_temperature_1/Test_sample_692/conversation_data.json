    "The earliest known unambiguous date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico. The artifact is inscribed with a date from the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar.\n\nThe date recorded is **7.16.3.2.13**, which corresponds to **December 7, 36 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThe Long Count calendar system counts the number of days that have passed since a mythical creation date, which correlates to August 11, 3114 BCE. The date 7.16.3.2.13 breaks down as follows:\n\n*   **7** Baktun (7 * 144,000 days)\n*   **16** Katun (16 * 7,200 days)\n*   **3** Tun (3 * 360 days)\n*   **2** Uinal (2 * 20 days)\n*   **13** Kin (13 * 1 day)\n\nThe following Python code calculates the total number of days represented by this date and states the result.\n\n```python\n# The Long Count date from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo\nbaktun = 7\nkatun = 16\ntun = 3\nuinal = 2\nkin = 13\n\n# Days per unit\ndays_per_baktun = 144000\ndays_per_katun = 7200\ndays_per_tun = 360\ndays_per_uinal = 20\ndays_per_kin = 1\n\n# Calculate the total number of days since the Long Count epoch date\ntotal_days = (baktun * days_per_baktun) + \\\n             (katun * days_per_katun) + \\\n             (tun * days_per_tun) + \\\n             (uinal * days_per_uinal) + \\\n             (kin * days_per_kin)\n\n# The corresponding date in the Gregorian calendar\ngregorian_date = \"December 7, 36 BCE\"\n\nprint(\"The earliest known recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization is from Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo.\")\nprint(f\"Long Count Date: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\\n\")\nprint(\"This represents the total number of days passed since the calendar's start date (August 11, 3114 BCE).\\n\")\nprint(\"Calculation:\")\n# The final equation with each number explicitly printed\nprint(f\"({baktun} * {days_per_baktun}) + ({katun} * {days_per_katun}) + ({tun} * {days_per_tun}) + ({uinal} * {days_per_uinal}) + ({kin} * {days_per_kin}) = {total_days}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Total days since epoch: {total_days}\")\nprint(f\"This corresponds to the Gregorian date: {gregorian_date}\")\n```\n<<<December 7, 36 BCE>>>"
