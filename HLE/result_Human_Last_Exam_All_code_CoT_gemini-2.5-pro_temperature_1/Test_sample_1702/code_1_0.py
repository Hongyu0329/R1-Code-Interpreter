/*
 This C code is designed for the specified Wuxing architecture.
 It assumes the compiler provides a 'frac' type and its related arithmetic operations.

 The definition of the frac type is assumed to be:
 struct frac {
     signed char n;     // numerator (-128 to 127)
     unsigned char d;   // denominator (0 to 255)
     signed char e;     // exponent, base 10
 };
 The value of a frac variable is calculated as (n/d) * 10^e.
*/

// The 'frac' type must be defined or built-in for this code to compile.
// For this self-contained example, we define it. In the target environment,
// this definition would likely be in a system header.
struct frac {
    signed char n;
    unsigned char d;
    signed char e;
};

// In a real Wuxing compiler, frac operations would be built-in.
// This is a placeholder for the logic.
typedef struct frac frac;

    // Let y = (2hc^2) / (Bλ^5) and x = hc / λkT.
    // The equation becomes exp(x) - 1 = y, so x = ln(1+y).
    // We use the Taylor series for ln(1+y) ≈ y - y^2/2 + y^3/3.
