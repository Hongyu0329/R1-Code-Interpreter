Statement B is incorrect. It claims that a specific quantization scheme (per-token for activations and per-channel for weights) can achieve runtime speed-up on NVIDIA's Turing architecture.

Here's the breakdown:
1.  **The Scheme:** This scheme requires applying a unique scaling factor for each element of the output matrix, calculated from the outer product of the activation and weight scale vectors ($S[t, c] = s_X[t] \cdot s_W[c]$).
2.  **Hardware/Library Limitations:** Standard high-performance GEMM (General Matrix Multiply) libraries like cuBLAS, especially during the Turing era, were primarily optimized for a single scalar `alpha` to scale the entire output matrix (`C = alpha * A * B`). They did not have native, high-performance support for applying a matrix of scaling factors.
3.  **Performance Implication:** To implement the scheme in statement B using standard libraries, one would need two separate steps: an INT8 GEMM followed by a custom kernel to apply the scaling factors. This second step involves a full read and write of the output matrix, adding significant memory bandwidth overhead.
4.  **Conclusion:** This overhead from the extra kernel launch and memory pass would likely cancel out, or even outweigh, the computational speed-up from the INT8 GEMM. This makes it unlikely to achieve a net runtime speed-up compared to a single, highly optimized FP32 GEMM call. While modern specialized kernels can fuse these operations, it was not a standard, performant feature of the Turing-era ecosystem.

Therefore, the claim that this specific scheme leads to a speed-up on Turing GPUs is incorrect.
