    Identifies non-planar graphs from the family of Platonic solids after a specific modification.

    The procedure is as follows:
    1. The five Platonic solid graphs are generated.
    2. They are ordered by their number of vertices to assign labels 1-5.
    3. For each graph, if its faces have more than 3 vertices (k > 3), one face is chosen.
       Edges are added to connect all non-adjacent vertices of that face.
    4. The planarity of the resulting graph is checked.
    5. The labels of graphs that become non-planar are collected and printed.
