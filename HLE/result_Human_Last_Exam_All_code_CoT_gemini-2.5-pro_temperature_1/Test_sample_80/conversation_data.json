    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will determine the total number of squares on the edge of a standard 8x8 chessboard. The edge consists of the first and last rows and the first and last columns.\n2.  Next, I will apply the rule for placing bishops so that they cannot attack each other. Bishops attack diagonally, which means to place the maximum number of them, they must all be on squares of the same color (either all light or all dark).\n3.  I will then count how many edge squares are light and how many are dark. The maximum number of bishops that can be placed is equal to the number of squares of the more numerous color on the edge (in this case, they are equal).\n4.  Finally, I will subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares to find out how many edge squares are left empty.\n\n```python\ndef solve_bishop_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of empty edge squares after placing the maximum\n    number of non-attacking bishops on the edge of a chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_side_length = 8\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total number of edge squares.\n    # An 8x8 board has 4 sides. If we simply multiply 8 * 4, we count\n    # the 4 corner squares twice. So, we subtract 4.\n    total_edge_squares = (board_side_length * 4) - 4\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the maximum number of non-attacking bishops.\n    # To place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops, they must all\n    # be on squares of the same color. The 28 edge squares of a chessboard\n    # are composed of 14 light and 14 dark squares.\n    # Therefore, we can place a maximum of 14 bishops on the edge.\n    max_bishops_on_edge = total_edge_squares // 2\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the number of empty edge squares.\n    empty_edge_squares = total_edge_squares - max_bishops_on_edge\n\n    # Step 4: Print the final equation with all numbers.\n    print(\"This problem can be solved with the following calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total edge squares on an 8x8 board: ({board_side_length} * 4) - 4 = {total_edge_squares}\")\n    print(f\"Maximum non-attacking bishops that can be placed on the edge: {total_edge_squares} / 2 = {max_bishops_on_edge}\")\n    print(\"The number of squares lacking bishops is the total edge squares minus the placed bishops.\")\n    print(f\"Final equation: {total_edge_squares} - {max_bishops_on_edge} = {empty_edge_squares}\")\n\nsolve_bishop_puzzle()\n<<<14>>>\n```"
