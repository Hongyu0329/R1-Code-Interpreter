# The problem is to find the maximum number of energy levels that can differ
# between two supersymmetric partner Hamiltonians, H_0 and H_1.
# H_0 = L^+L - alpha
# H_1 = LL^+ - alpha
# where L = d/dx - W(x) and L^+ = -d/dx - W(x).

# Step 1: Relationship between the spectra
# The spectra of H_0 and H_1 are almost identical. For any eigenvalue E != -alpha,
# there is a one-to-one correspondence between the eigenstates of H_0 and H_1.
# This means the energy levels are the same for all E != -alpha.

# Step 2: The possibility of a difference
# A difference in the spectra can only occur at the specific eigenvalue E = -alpha.
# An eigenstate psi of H_0 has eigenvalue -alpha if and only if L*psi = 0.
# An eigenstate phi of H_1 has eigenvalue -alpha if and only if L^+*phi = 0.
# These states are called the "zero modes" of the operators L and L^+.
# A zero mode of L gives a level in H_0 that might not have a partner in H_1's spectrum.
# A zero mode of L^+ gives a level in H_1 that might not have a partner in H_0's spectrum.

# Step 3: Counting the number of zero modes
# We need to find the number of solutions to the equations L*psi = 0 and L^+*phi = 0.
# The equation L*psi = (d/dx - W(x))*psi = 0 is a first-order scalar linear ODE.
# The space of its solutions is one-dimensional. To be a valid eigenfunction, a solution
# must also be normalizable and satisfy the boundary conditions.
# Therefore, the number of such states for H_0, let's call it n_0, can be either 0 or 1.
n0_possible_values = {0, 1}

# Similarly, L^+*phi = (-d/dx - W(x))*phi = 0 is also a first-order scalar linear ODE.
# The number of its valid solutions for H_1, let's call it n_1, can also be either 0 or 1.
n1_possible_values = {0, 1}

# Step 4: Calculating the maximum difference
# The total number of differing energy levels is the absolute difference between the
# number of these special states for each Hamiltonian.
# Number of differing levels = |n_0 - n_1|

# We want to find the maximum possible value for this difference. This occurs when
# one Hamiltonian has a special state (e.g., n_0 = 1) and the other does not (e.g., n_1 = 0).
max_n0 = 1
min_n1 = 0

# The final equation demonstrates this maximal case.
max_difference = abs(max_n0 - min_n1)
