# Step 1: Derivation of the sphere equation.
# The solvability conditions for the nonlinear boundary value problem are:
# alpha = (y0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))
# beta  = (x0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))
# gamma = (x0^2 + y0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))
#
# Summing these three equations gives:
# alpha + beta + gamma = 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2) * (1 - exp(-T))
#
# We are given the constraint:
# alpha + beta + gamma = 10^25 * (1 - exp(-T))
#
# Equating the two expressions for (alpha + beta + gamma) and assuming T is not 0,
# we can cancel the (1 - exp(-T)) term:
# 10^25 = 2 * (x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2)
#
# This simplifies to the equation of a sphere for (x0, y0, z0):
# x0^2 + y0^2 + z0^2 = 10^25 / 2
#
# This sphere is the set of initial values for which solutions exist.

# Step 2: Calculate the area of the sphere.
# The equation of the sphere is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2.
# The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula A = 4 * pi * R^2.

# The square of the radius of the sphere
radius_squared = 10**25 / 2

# The components of the area formula
four = 4
pi = math.pi

# Calculate the final area
area = four * pi * radius_squared

# Step 3: Output the result.
# The final equation for the area is A = 4 * pi * R^2.
# We print each number involved in this calculation.
print(f"The equation for the surface area is A = 4 * pi * R^2.")
print(f"Derived value for R^2 = {radius_squared}")
print(f"The calculation is: {four} * {pi} * {radius_squared} = {area}")
print(f"The final area is {area}")
