    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category from [23] to [37].

    An internal adjunction from [m] to [n] in the simplex category corresponds to
    an order-preserving map L: [m] -> [n] such that L(0) = 0.
    The problem is to find the number of such maps from [23] to [37].

    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-decreasing sequences
    L(1), L(2), ..., L(23) of length 23, with values taken from {0, 1, ..., 37}.

    This is a combinations with repetition problem. We are choosing k items from a
    set of N items with replacement. The formula is C(N + k - 1, k).
    - The number of items to choose, k, is 23 (for L(1) through L(23)).
    - The number of available options for each choice, N, is 38 (integers from 0 to 37).

    So, the total number of adjunctions is C(38 + 23 - 1, 23) = C(60, 23).
    Alternatively, using m=23 and n=37, the formula is C(n + m, m).

    n_plus_m = n + m
    k = m

    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(n_plus_m, k)
    result = math.comb(n_plus_m, k)
