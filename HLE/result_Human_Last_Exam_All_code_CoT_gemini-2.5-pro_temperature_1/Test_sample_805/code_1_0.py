# The user wants to identify the correct statement about Braveheart gene expression.
# Based on biological knowledge:
# 1. In embryonic stem cells (ESCs), lineage-specific genes like Braveheart are
#    repressed to maintain pluripotency. So, their expression is low. This can be
#    described as being "decreased" relative to a potential active state.
# 2. During the differentiation into heart cells, Braveheart is a key regulator
#    that must be turned on. Therefore, its expression "increases".
# 3. Comparing these facts with the given options, option D is the best fit.

# The correct choice is D.
# The following code will print the letter corresponding to the correct answer.

correct_answer = 'D'
print(f"The expression of Braveheart genes is repressed or 'decreased' in embryonic stem cells to maintain their undifferentiated state.")
print(f"During the process of becoming heart cells, its expression 'increases' to drive the differentiation.")
print(f"Therefore, the correct option is: {correct_answer}")
