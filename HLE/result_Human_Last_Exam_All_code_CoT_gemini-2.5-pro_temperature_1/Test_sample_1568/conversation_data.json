    "My plan to solve this problem is to express the given infinite product in a closed form using well-known mathematical functions. This is a standard approach for such products.\n\nHere are the steps of my plan:\n1.  The given product starts from `n=3`. I will first relate it to the corresponding product that starts from `n=1`. This can be done by taking the full product from `n=1` and dividing out the terms for `n=1` and `n=2`.\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n2.  Next, I will evaluate the infinite product that starts from `n=1`. This is a known result from complex analysis related to the Gamma function. The general formula for a product of this type is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^m}{n^m}\\right) = \\prod_{k=0}^{m-1} \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x \\cdot e^{2\\pi i k/m})} $$\n    For our case, `m=3`, and the formula becomes:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z \\cdot e^{2\\pi i/3}) \\cdot \\Gamma(1-z \\cdot e^{4\\pi i/3})} $$\n    where `Î“` is the Gamma function.\n3.  Finally, I will substitute this result back into the expression from step 1 to get the final answer. The terms for `n=1` and `n=2` in the denominator simplify to `(1 - z^3)` and `(1 - z^3/8)`.\n\nThe Python code below will print this final symbolic expression, clearly showing all the numbers involved in the formula as requested.\n\n```python\ndef print_infinite_product_solution():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form symbolic solution for the given infinite product.\n    The solution is expressed in terms of the Gamma function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the numbers that appear in the final equation to fulfill the user request.\n    start_index = 3\n    power = 3\n    denominator_n1_cubed = 1**3\n    denominator_n2_cubed = 2**3\n    gamma_arg_const = 1\n    exp_arg1_num = 2\n    exp_arg1_den = 3\n    exp_arg2_num = 4\n    exp_arg2_den = 3\n\n    # Construct the final expression as a string.\n    # Note: 'z' is a complex variable, 'i' is the imaginary unit, 'pi' is the constant pi,\n    # 'exp' is the exponential function, and 'Gamma' represents the Gamma function.\n    # The denominator terms for n=1 and n=2 are simplified for readability.\n    final_expression = (\n        f\"1 / ( (1 - z**{power}) * (1 - z**{power}/{denominator_n2_cubed}) * \"\n        f\"Gamma({gamma_arg_const} - z) * \"\n        f\"Gamma({gamma_arg_const} - z * exp(i*{exp_arg1_num}*pi/{exp_arg1_den})) * \"\n        f\"Gamma({gamma_arg_const} - z * exp(i*{exp_arg2_num}*pi/{exp_arg2_den})) )\"\n    )\n\n    print(f\"The expression for the infinite product is:\")\n    print(final_expression)\n\nprint_infinite_product_solution()\n```\n<<<1 / ( (1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3/8) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z * exp(i*2*pi/3)) * Gamma(1 - z * exp(i*4*pi/3)) )>>>"
