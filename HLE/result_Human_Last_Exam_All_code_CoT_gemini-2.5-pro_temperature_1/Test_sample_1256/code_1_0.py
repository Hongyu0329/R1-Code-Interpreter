    # The only possible assignment is x_i = 1 for all i.

    # This is true. So, a solution always exists for N=1.

    # S*y = y + 2S - 2  => y(S-1) = 2(S-1) => y = 2 (for S != 1).
    # The existence of the solution x_i = 2 means that for N>=2, a monochromatic
    # solution is guaranteed by the color of the number 2. Thus, Rad_2 <= 2.
    # For N=1, the only choice is x_i=1. S*1 = 1 + 2S-2 => S = 2S-1 => S=1.
    # S=1 is not possible for a 2-distributable set of positive integers.

    # This requires using the 2-distributable property and the fact that S is even
