    "This is a question from the mathematical field of topology. The answer is a known result from a classification theorem. A program can't derive this result, but it can be used to list the known classes and provide the count.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Identify the known homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua based on the classification theorem by R. H. Bing and F. Burton Jones.\n2.  The classes include one degenerate case (the point) and three non-degenerate cases (the circle, the pseudo-arc, and the circle of pseudo-arcs).\n3.  Write a Python script to list these four classes.\n4.  The script will then count the number of items in the list to find the total.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the total count as a simple equation, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function lists and counts the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua based on a known mathematical theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to a theorem by R.
