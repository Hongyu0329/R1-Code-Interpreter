    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Matrix:** The problem provides a specific 3x3 matrix A. The information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is context for where such a matrix might appear but does not change the matrix itself. The task is to calculate the determinant of the provided matrix A.\n2.  **Determinant Formula:** For a 3x3 matrix:\n    \\[\n    \\begin{bmatrix} \n    a & b & c \\\\ \n    d & e & f \\\\ \n    g & h & i \n    \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The determinant is calculated using the formula: `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will use the `numpy` library to represent the matrix. I will then use the formula above to calculate the determinant step-by-step and print out each part of the calculation for clarity, as requested. Finally, I will print the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The given matrix A is the graph Laplacian of the complete graph K3.\n# The mention of the Markov quiver and m_1/2 = 13 is context,\n# the core task is to compute the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix A.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# Extract elements for the formula\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# Calculate the terms for the determinant formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\nterm1_val = e * i - f * h\nterm1 = a * term1_val\n\nterm2_val = d * i - f * g\nterm2 = b * term2_val\n\nterm3_val = d * h - e * g\nterm3 = c * term3_val\n\n# Calculate the final determinant\ndeterminant = term1 - term2 + term3\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(\"Computing the determinant for matrix A:\")\nprint(A)\nprint(\"\\nUsing the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate the first term a(ei - fh)\")\nprint(f\"  = {a} * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h}))\")\nprint(f\"  = {a} * ({e*i} - {f*h})\")\nprint(f\"  = {a} * ({term1_val})\")\nprint(f\"  = {term1}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the second term -b(di - fg)\")\nprint(f\"  = -({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"  = -({b}) * ({d*i} - {f*g})\")\nprint(f\"  = -({b}) * ({term2_val})\")\nprint(f\"  = {-term2}\")\n\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the third term c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(f\"  = {c} * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\nprint(f\"  = {c} * ({d*h} - {e*g})\")\nprint(f\"  = {c} * ({term3_val})\")\nprint(f\"  = {term3}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nStep 4: Combine the terms to get the final determinant\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({term1}) - ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1 - term2 + term3}\")\n\n# An interesting fact is that for any connected graph, the determinant\n# of its Laplacian matrix is 0. The matrix A is the Laplacian of the\n# complete graph K3, so its determinant is expected to be 0.\nprint(f\"\\nThe determinant of the matrix is: {determinant}\")\n<<<0>>>\n```"
