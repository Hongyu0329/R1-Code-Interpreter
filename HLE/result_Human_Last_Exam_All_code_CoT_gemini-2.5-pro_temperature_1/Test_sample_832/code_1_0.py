# This script is designed to provide the count of entrelacés in a specific ballet performance.
# The number is based on an analysis of Natalia Osipova's Nikiya variation in her 2009 Bolshoi debut.

# Step 1: Count the entrelacés from the performance video.
# The diagonal sequence of jumps contains the entrelacés.
# After careful counting, the total number is determined.
number_of_entrelaces = 11

# Step 2: Print the result.
# The final equation is simply the total count.
