# Given parameters
alpha = 10**16
# R is given as ln(100/99)
R = math.log(100/99)

# The derived bifurcation equation is:
# t0**2 / 3 * (e**R - 1) = alpha
# We can solve this for t0.

# Calculate e**R - 1
e_R = math.exp(R)
e_R_minus_1 = e_R - 1

# Solve for t0**2
t0_squared = (3 * alpha) / e_R_minus_1

# Solve for the positive value of t0
t0 = math.sqrt(t0_squared)

# Print the final equation with numerical values
# The term (e^R - 1) is exactly 1/99
