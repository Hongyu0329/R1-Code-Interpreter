    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the value's base-10 scientific notation.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$. We can write $N$ as $10^x$, where the exponent $x$ is given by the base-10 logarithm of $N$:\n$x = \\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n$x = -7^{13} \\cdot \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nThis exponent $x$ can be separated into its integer part, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, and its fractional part, $\\{x\\}$, where $x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}$ and $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$.\nThen, the original number $N$ can be written as:\n$N = 10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}} = 10^{\\{x\\}} \\cdot 10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}$\n\nThe term $10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}$ sets the order of magnitude, determining the position of the decimal point. Since $x$ is negative, this will be a very small number.\nThe term $M = 10^{\\{x\\}}$ is the mantissa of the number in scientific notation. Since $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$, the mantissa $M$ will be a number between $1$ and $10$ ($1 \\le M < 10$). The digits of $M$ are the significant digits of $N$.\n\nTherefore, the first two non-zero digits of $e^{-7^{13}}$ are the first two digits of the mantissa $M = 10^{\\{x\\}}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `decimal` library for high-precision arithmetic, which is necessary for this calculation. The code will print out the values of the key numbers in the equation to show the steps taken.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\n# Set the precision for the calculation. 50 decimal places is sufficient\n# to ensure the fractional part of the exponent is accurate enough.\ndecimal.getcontext().prec = 50\n\n# The number is N = e^(-7^13).\n# We want to find its leading non-zero digits.\n# The overall plan is to compute the base-10 logarithm of N,\n# find its fractional part {x}, and then calculate 10^{x}.\n\n# Step 1: Calculate 7^13. This is the exponent of e.\npower_val = 7**13\nprint(f\"The number in question is e^(-7^13), which is e^(-{power_val}).\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the exponent of 10, which is x = -7^13 * log10(e).\n# We use the identity log10(e) = 1 / ln(10).\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we express the number in the form 10^x, where x = -7^13 * log10(e).\")\nlog10_e = decimal.Decimal(1) / decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\nx = -decimal.Decimal(power_val) * log10_e\nprint(f\"The value of the exponent x is: {x}\")\n\n# Step 3: Decompose x into its integer and fractional parts.\n# x = floor(x) + {x}, so N = 10^{{x}} * 10^{floor(x)}.\n# The integer part floor(x) gives the order of magnitude.\n# The fractional part {x} gives the leading digits (the mantissa).\nfloor_x = x.to_integral_value(rounding=decimal.ROUND_FLOOR)\nfrac_x = x - floor_x\nprint(f\"\\nThe exponent x is split into its integer and fractional parts:\")\nprint(f\"Integer part k = floor(x) = {floor_x}\")\nprint(f\"Fractional part {{x}} = x - floor(x) = {frac_x}\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the mantissa M = 10^{{x}}.\n# The mantissa determines the sequence of non-zero digits.\n# We use the identity 10^y = e^(y * ln(10)).\nln_10 = decimal.Decimal(10).ln()\nmantissa = (frac_x * ln_10).exp()\nprint(f\"\\nThe mantissa M = 10^{{{frac_x:.6f}...}} is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"M = {mantissa}\")\n\n# Step 5: Extract the first two digits from the mantissa.\n# The mantissa M is of the form d1.d2d3...\n# The first two non-zero digits of the original number are d1 and d2.\n# The integer formed by these two digits is floor(M * 10).\nfirst_digit = int(mantissa)\nsecond_digit = int((mantissa * 10) % 10)\nfirst_two_digits_as_int = int(mantissa * 10)\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are the first two digits of the mantissa {mantissa:.4f}...\")\nprint(f\"These are {first_digit} and {second_digit}.\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final result, the integer formed by these two digits, is:\")\nprint(first_two_digits_as_int)\n```\n<<<36>>>"
