    "This is a problem in abstract algebra, specifically in the study of product-free sets in finite groups. I will solve it by breaking down the definitions and applying known theorems from the mathematical literature.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Clarify Definitions:** First, I'll clarify the definitions of a \"product-free set\" and a \"filled group\". A key clarification is that the identity element `e` is never part of a product-free set, so a group `G` is considered \"filled\" if the union of its maximal product-free sets is `G \\ {e}`.\n2.  **Decompose the Problem:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. A crucial theorem states that a direct product of groups with coprime orders is filled if and only if each component group is filled. This reduces the problem of classifying finite filled nilpotent groups to classifying finite filled p-groups.\n3.  **Analyze p-Groups:** I will analyze the case for p-groups based on the prime `p`.\n    *   **Case 1: p is an odd prime.** A major theorem states that all finite groups of odd order are filled. Since p-groups for an odd prime `p` have odd order, all such groups are filled.\n    *   **Case 2: p = 2.** The classification of filled 2-groups is more complex. I will use the known theorem that a 2-group `P` is filled if and only if its exponent is at most 4 (i.e., for every element `g` in `P`, `g^4 = e`).\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** By combining these results, a finite nilpotent group `G = P_2 \\times O` (where `P_2` is the Sylow 2-subgroup and `O` is the direct product of all Sylow p-subgroups for odd primes `p`) is filled if and only if its Sylow 2-subgroup `P_2` is filled. This leads to the final characterization.\n\nI will now provide the final answer in the requested Python code block.\n\n```python\ndef solve_finite_filled_nilpotent_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the classification of finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n    A finite group G is called a filled group if the union of all its maximal\n    by inclusion product-free sets is equal to G \\ {e}.\n\n    A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its\n    Sylow p-subgroups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    answer_line_1 = \"A finite nilpotent group G is a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\"\n    answer_line_2 = \"G is filled if and only if each of its Sylow p-subgroups is filled.\"\n    answer_line_3 = \"The classification of filled p-groups is as follows:\"\n    answer_line_4 = \"1.
