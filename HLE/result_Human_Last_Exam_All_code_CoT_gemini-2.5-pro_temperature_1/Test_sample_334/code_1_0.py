    This function analyzes the provided options and identifies the best solution.
    The final answer is determined by which option addresses all four cybersecurity requirements:
    1. Prevention of spoofing and replay attacks.
    2. Protection against coercion (unwilling user cannot authenticate).
    3. Security of biometric data even if exposed or stolen.
    4. Applicability to a wide range of biometric modalities.

    Option (N) describes a comprehensive hardware security module that explicitly claims to meet all these criteria
    through a combination of advanced tamper detection, quantum-resistant cryptography, hardware enclaves,
    and real-time monitoring, making it the most robust and complete solution presented.
