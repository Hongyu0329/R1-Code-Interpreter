    "This is a problem of enumerating the combinatorial types of stable degenerations of a genus 2 curve. The classification is a known result in algebraic geometry. A stable curve of genus `g` is a connected nodal curve `C` such that every rational component (a copy of the projective line, `P^1`) meets the other components in at least two points (for `g>1`).\n\nThe combinatorial type of a stable curve is described by its dual graph `G`, where vertices represent irreducible components and edges represent nodes where components intersect. A loop on a vertex represents a self-intersection of a component. Each vertex `v` also has a geometric genus `g(v)` associated with it.\n\nThe key formula relating these properties is that for a stable curve of genus 2, the sum of the geometric genera of its components and the first Betti number of its dual graph must equal 2:\n`sum(g(v)) + b_1(G) = 2`\nwhere `b_1(G) = e - v + 1` is the first Betti number of the graph `G` (with `e` edges and `v` vertices).\n\nMy plan is to systematically count the number of possible valid configurations by considering the possible values for `sum(g(v))`.\n\n1.  **Case 1: `sum(g(v)) = 2`**\n    This implies `b_1(G) = 0`, so the dual graph `G` must be a tree (`e = v - 1`).\n    *   The integer 2 can be partitioned as `(2)`. This corresponds to one component of genus 2. The graph is a single vertex. This is the case of good reduction. (1 type)\n    *   The integer 2 can be partitioned as `(1, 1)`. This corresponds to two components, each of genus 1 (elliptic curves). A tree with two vertices has one edge connecting them. (1 type)\n\n2.  **Case 2: `sum(g(v)) = 1`**\n    This implies `b_1(G) = 1`, so the dual graph `G` must be unicyclic (`e = v`). The genus partition must have one 1, and the rest 0s.\n    *   One component of genus 1. `v=1, e=1`. The graph is a single vertex with a loop. (1 type)\n    *   One component of genus 1, one of genus 0. `v=2, e=2`. The graph has two vertices connected by two edges. (1 type)\n    *   One component of genus 1, two of genus 0. `v=3, e=3`. The graph is a triangle. (1 type)\n\n3.  **Case 3: `sum(g(v)) = 0`**\n    This implies `b_1(G) = 2` (`e = v + 1`). All components are rational (`g=0`). We need to count the number of non-isomorphic, connected graphs with `b_1(G) = 2` that satisfy the stability condition.\n    *   `v=1, e=2`: A single vertex with two loops. (1 type)\n    *   `v=2, e=3`: Two vertices connected by three edges. (1 type)\n    *   `v=3, e=4`: A triangle with one edge doubled. (1 type)\n    *   `v=4, e=5`: There are two such graphs (a square with a diagonal, and a \"theta\" graph). (2 types)\n    *   `v=5, e=6`: There are three such graphs (two triangles sharing a vertex; a pentagon with a chord; a square with a tail). (3 types)\n\nBy summing the counts from all cases, we can find the total number of types.\n\n```python\ndef count_stable_reductions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2\n    by enumerating the combinatorial possibilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\")\n    print(\"The classification is based on the combinatorial structure of the dual graph of the degenerate curve.\")\n    print(\"The governing formula is: sum(g_v) + b_1(G) = 2\")\n    print(\"where g_v is the geometric genus of a component and b_1(G) = e - v + 1 is the first Betti number of the graph.\\n\")\n\n    total_count = 0\n\n    # Case 1: sum(g_v) = 2.
