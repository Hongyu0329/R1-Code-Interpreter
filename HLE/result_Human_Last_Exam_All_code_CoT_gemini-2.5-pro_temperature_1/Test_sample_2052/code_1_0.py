    # Part (a): Analysis of superintegrability for n = 3.
    # The two-matrix model reduces to a character expansion whose coefficients
    # are determined by a one-matrix model with potential V(Phi) = Tr(Phi^n)/n.
    # In the literature, "superintegrability" refers to a property stronger
    # than integrability (satisfying W-constraints). It is generally associated
    # with models whose partition functions have a simple explicit representation,
    # a property that holds for the Gaussian model (n=2) or models with
    # logarithmic potentials. For polynomial potentials of degree n > 2,
    # the models are known to be integrable but not superintegrable.
    # Since n=3 is greater than 2, the model is not superintegrable.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): Analysis of the necessity of the W_{-4} operator for n = 4.
    # The partition function Z_{-n}(t) is constructed from terms related to the
    # n-th power-sum symmetric function p_n. The set of all power-sums
    # {p_1, p_2, p_3, ...} forms a basis of algebraically independent generators
    # for the ring of symmetric functions. This means that p_4 cannot be
    # expressed as a polynomial combination of other power sums (p_k for k != 4).
    # Therefore, to generate Z_{-4}(t), whose structure is dictated by p_4,
    # an operator that specifically introduces this p_4 dependence (denoted W_{-4})
    # is essential and cannot be constructed from other operators W_{-k}.
    answer_b = "Yes"

    # Print the final answer in the requested format.
    # The instruction "output each number in the final equation" is not applicable here,
    # as this is a Yes/No question without a numerical equation to be solved.
    # The numbers in the question are n=3 and n=4, which are part of the reasoning.
