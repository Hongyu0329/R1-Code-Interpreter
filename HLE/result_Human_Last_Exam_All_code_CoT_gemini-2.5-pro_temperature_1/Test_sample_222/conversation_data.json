    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem:** The request is to find the \"4-point DFT\" for the 8-point sequence `{x(0),h(0),x(1),h(1),x(2),h(2),x(3),h(3)}`. An N-point sequence has an N-point DFT. The request for a 4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence is likely a typo. The standard interpretation of this problem, which involves interleaving two sequences, is to calculate the **8-point DFT** of the resulting 8-point sequence. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n2.  **Choose the Method:** Instead of first calculating the original time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)` via Inverse DFT, we can directly use the given DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` to find the DFT of the interleaved sequence. This is a classic application of the Decimation-In-Time (DIT) property used in the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.\n\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** Let the new 8-point interleaved sequence be `y(m)`. Its 8-point DFT, `Y(k)`, can be calculated from the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)` using the following formulas:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    where `W_8^k = exp(-j * 2 * pi * k / 8)` is the 8-point DFT twiddle factor.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** The Python script will:\n    *   Define the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` as NumPy arrays.\n    *   Loop from `k = 0` to `3`.\n    *   In each iteration, calculate the twiddle factor `W_8^k` and the product `W_8^k * H(k)`.\n    *   Compute `Y(k)` and `Y(k+4)` using the formulas above.\n    *   Print the step-by-step calculation for each of the 8 points of `Y(k)`, showing all the numbers in the equations as requested.\n    *   Finally, print the complete 8-point DFT vector `Y(k)`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_dft():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the 8-point DFT of an interleaved sequence based on the\n    4-point DFTs of the original sequences.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given 4-point DFTs\n    X = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j], dtype=complex)\n    H = np.array([0, 1 + 1j, 1, 1 - 1j], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Initialize the 8-point DFT result vector\n    Y = np.zeros(8, dtype=complex)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the 8-point DFT, Y(k), for the interleaved sequence\")\n    print(\"y(m) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}.\")\n    print(\"\\nUsing the decimation-in-time formulas:\")\n    print(\"Y(k)   = X(k) + (W_8^k) * H(k)\")\n    print(\"Y(k+4) = X(k) - (W_8^k) * H(k)\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\\n\")\n\n    # Loop for k from 0 to 3 to calculate all 8 points of Y(k)\n    for k in range(4):\n        # Calculate the 8-point twiddle factor W_8^k\n        w_8_k = np.exp(-1j * 2 * np.pi * k / 8)\n        \n        # Calculate the term to be added/subtracted\n        term = w_8_k * H[k]\n        \n        # Calculate Y(k) and Y(k+4)\n        Y[k] = X[k] + term\n        Y[k+4] = X[k] - term\n\n        # Print the detailed calculation for Y(k)\n        print(f\"For k={k}:\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = X({k}) + (W_8^{k}) * H({k})\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = ({X[k]:.4f}) + ({w_8_k:.4f}) * ({H[k]:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = ({X[k]:.4f}) + ({term:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"Y({k}) = {Y[k]:.4f}\\n\")\n\n        # Print the detailed calculation for Y(k+4)\n        print(f\"Y({k+4}) = X({k}) - (W_8^{k}) * H({k})\")\n        print(f\"Y({k+4}) = ({X[k]:.4f}) - ({w_8_k:.4f}) * ({H[k]:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"Y({k+4}) = ({X[k]:.4f}) - ({term:.4f})\")\n        print(f\"Y({k+4}) = {Y[k+4]:.4f}\")\n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final 8-point DFT vector Y(k) is:\")\n    # Use np.round to clean up floating point inaccuracies for printing\n    Y_rounded = np.round(Y, decimals=4)\n    print(Y_rounded)\n\nsolve_dft()\n<<<[1.+0.j, 1.4142+1.j, -1.-1.j, -1.4142-1.j, 1.+0.j, -1.4142+1.j, -1.+1.j, 1.4142-1.j]>>>\n```"
