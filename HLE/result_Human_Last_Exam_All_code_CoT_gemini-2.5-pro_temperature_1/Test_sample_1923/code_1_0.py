    print("Analyzing the physics problem step-by-step:")
    print("------------------------------------------")

    print("\nStep 1: Understand the baseline premise.")
    print("The problem states that gravity propagates at speed 'c'.")
    print("This alone leads to the 'aberration of gravity'. The gravitational force on mass 1 points to the 'retarded position' of mass 2 (where mass 2 was when the gravitational signal was emitted).")
    print("This would cause the center of gravity to appear shifted *opposite* to the direction of motion.")

    print("\nStep 2: Understand the core of the question.")
    print("The question asks for an assumption that causes a shift *in the direction* of motion.")
    print("This implies an effect beyond simple aberration, pointing towards a more complex relativistic phenomenon.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluate the additional assumptions (the answer choices).")

    print("\nAnalyzing Choice A: The total energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field remains Lorentz invariant under relative motion.")
    print("  - This is a cornerstone of General Relativity. It means the source of gravity is not just mass, but the complete energy-momentum tensor (T_µν).")
    print("  - For a moving mass, this tensor includes momentum density (mass-currents).")
    print("  - These mass-currents create additional, velocity-dependent gravitational effects (often called 'gravitomagnetism').")
    print("  - These complex, non-central forces are what fundamentally alter the gravitational field beyond a simple retarded potential, and can be interpreted as a shift or distortion of the center of gravity. This is the most fundamental principle that introduces the required physics.")

    print("\nAnalyzing Choice B: The gravitational field maintains local energy conservation...")
    print("  - Local energy conservation is a *consequence* of the principles in Choice A and the field equations. It is not the most fundamental assumption itself.")

    print("\nAnalyzing Choice C: Field strength varies inversely with apparent propagation time...")
    print("  - This describes the magnitude of the force (similar to an inverse-square law), not its complex directional nature. It doesn't explain the directional shift required.")

    print("\nAnalyzing Choice D: The net product of field strength and propagation speed remains invariant...")
    print("  - This appears to be an ad-hoc and physically incorrect statement. Since 'c' is invariant, it would imply field strength is invariant, which is not true in relativity.")

    print("\nAnalyzing Choice E: The gravitational field adjusts its divergence to match the curvature...")
    print("  - This is a description of Einstein's Field Equations, which relate the field's geometry to its source. However, Choice A describes the fundamental relativistic nature of the *source* itself, which is the ultimate cause of the complex field.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion.")
    print("The simple aberration caused by finite propagation speed shifts the source backwards. A more complex effect is needed.")
    print("Choice A provides the most fundamental reason for such effects. By treating the Lorentz-invariant energy-momentum tensor as the source, it introduces momentum as a source of gravity, leading to the complex velocity-dependent forces that would alter the apparent center of gravity.")
