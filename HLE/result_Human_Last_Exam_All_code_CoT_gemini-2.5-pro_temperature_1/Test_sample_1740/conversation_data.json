    "To determine the number of let-7 family members in humans, I will reference the established data from primary miRNA databases like miRBase. The most common way to count \"members\" is to count the distinct precursor miRNA genes (paralogs). This includes the various `let-7` genes and `miR-98`, which is also considered part of the family due to its shared seed sequence.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Create a list in Python containing the names of all known human let-7 family precursor genes.\n2.  Print each member of this list to show what contributes to the total.\n3.  Use Python's `len()` function to count the items in the list.\n4.  Print the final count.\n\nThis script will provide you with the current, accepted number of human let-7 family members.\n\n```python\n# A list of the human let-7 family precursor miRNA genes (paralogs).\n# This list is based on data from miRBase, the primary miRNA sequence database.\n# The family includes let-7 paralogs and mir-98, which shares the same seed sequence family.\nhuman_let7_family_genes = [\n    \"hsa-let-7a-1\",\n    \"hsa-let-7a-2\",\n    \"hsa-let-7a-3\",\n    \"hsa-let-7b\",\n    \"hsa-let-7c\",\n    \"hsa-let-7d\",\n    \"hsa-let-7e\",\n    \"hsa-let-7f-1\",\n    \"hsa-let-7f-2\",\n    \"hsa-let-7g\",\n    \"hsa-let-7i\",\n    \"hsa-mir-98\"\n]\n\n# Calculate the total number of members by getting the length of the list.\ntotal_members = len(human_let7_family_genes)\n\nprint(\"The following are the known precursor genes for the let-7 family in humans:\")\n\n# Print each member that contributes to the final count.\n# This represents the \"equation\" of all the individual members adding up to the total.\nfor i, member in enumerate(human_let7_family_genes):\n    # This loop shows each component of our final count.\n    # The first item is 1, the second is 2, and so on, up to the total.\n    if i < len(human_let7_family_genes) - 1:\n        print(f\"1 ({member}) +\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"1 ({member})\")\n\nprint(f\"\\n= {total_members}\")\nprint(f\"\\nTo date, {total_members} members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\")\n```\n<<<12>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
