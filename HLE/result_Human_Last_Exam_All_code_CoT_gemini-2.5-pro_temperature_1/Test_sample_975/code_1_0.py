    This function evaluates the physics problem and prints the correct answer choice.
    The derivation involves setting up the magnetic scalar potential and solving for the coefficients
    using the boundary conditions at the surface of the magnetized sphere (r=R_p) and
    at the surface of the perfect conductor (r=R).

    The key boundary conditions are:
    1. At r=R (perfect conductor): The normal component of B is zero (B_r = 0), which implies H_r = 0.
    2. At r=R_p (interface):
       a. Tangential H is continuous (H_theta is continuous).
       b. Normal B is continuous (B_r is continuous).

    Solving the resulting system of equations for the potential coefficients yields expressions
    for the H field in both regions that match one of the provided options.

    # The derived expression for H in the region R_p < r < R is:
    # H_r = - (2*M_0/3) * [ (R_p/R)^3 - (R_p/r)^3 ] * cos(theta)
    # H_theta = (M_0/3) * [ 2*(R_p/R)^3 + (R_p/r)^3 ] * sin(theta)
