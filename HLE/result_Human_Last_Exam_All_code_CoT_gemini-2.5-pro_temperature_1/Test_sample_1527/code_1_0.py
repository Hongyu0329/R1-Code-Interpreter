# We will solve the equation derived from the geometric properties of the circles.
# Let r be the radius of the first circle.
# The simplified quadratic equation for r is r^2 - 4r + 4 = 0.
# We use Python to solve this equation.

r = sympy.Symbol('r')

# Define the coefficients of the quadratic equation: a*r^2 + b*r + c = 0
a = 1
b = -4
c = 4

# Define the equation
equation = sympy.Eq(a*r**2 + b*r + c, 0)

# Solve the equation for r
solutions = sympy.solve(equation, r)

# The solution for r is the first (and only) element in the solutions list
r_val = solutions[0]

# Calculate the required value, r^2
r_squared = r_val**2

# Output the final equation with each number and the result
