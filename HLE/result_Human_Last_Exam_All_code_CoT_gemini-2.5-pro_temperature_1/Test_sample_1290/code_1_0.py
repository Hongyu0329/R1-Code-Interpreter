    # Step 1: Analyze the valency of real vertices.
    # Let v be a vertex on the real axis. Its total valency, val(v), is the sum of its real degree 
    # (val_R(v), number of edges connecting v to other real vertices) and its non-real degree.
    # The function phi is real, so the dessin is symmetric with respect to the real axis. 
    # This means non-real edges from v must come in conjugate pairs.
    # So, val(v) = val_R(v) + 2*k, where k is the number of pairs of non-real edges.
    print("Step 1: The valency of a real vertex v is given by val(v) = val_R(v) + 2*k, where val_R(v) is its real degree and k is an integer.")

    # Step 2: Use the given conditions on valency.
    # The problem states that the valency of any real vertex in the relevant part of the dessin is an even number (2m).
    # From the equation in Step 1, if val(v) is even, val_R(v) must also be even.
    print("Step 2: The problem states that val(v) is an even number (2m). From the equation, this implies that val_R(v) must also be even.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the structure of the graph on the real line.
    # The part of the dessin on the real line is a graph. The degree of a vertex in this graph is its real degree, val_R(v).
    # In a graph on a line, a vertex can only have degree 1 (if it's an endpoint) or 2 (if it's an interior point).
    # Since val_R(v) must be even, it must be 2 for all real vertices of the dessin.
    print("Step 3: In a graph on a line, vertex degrees are 1 or 2. For the real degree to be even, it must be 2.")
    
    # Step 4: Consequence for the real graph.
    # A graph where every vertex has degree 2 must be a union of disjoint cycles.
    # On the real projective line (a circle), the only way to have a cycle is for it to be the entire circle.
    # This means the entire real line R P^1 must be covered by the edges of the dessin.
    print("Step 4: This means the graph on the real line consists of cycles. On R P^1, this implies the entire real line is covered by edges.")
    
    # Step 5: Consequence for the function phi.
    # By the definition of the dessin's edges, if the entire real line is covered by them, then for any real number x, phi(x) must be in the interval [0, 1].
    print("Step 5: If the entire real line consists of edges, then for all real x, phi(x) must be in the interval [0, 1].")
    
    # Step 6: Locate the r-points.
    # The r-points are the preimages of infinity, i.e., the poles of the rational function phi.
    # If phi(x) is bounded between 0 and 1 for all real x, it cannot have any poles on the real line. All its poles must be non-real.
    print("Step 6: The 'r' points are the poles of phi. If phi(x) is bounded on the real line, its poles must be non-real.")

    # Step 7: Final Conclusion.
    # Since there can be no poles on the real line, there can be no poles in the interval ]0, 1[.
    # Therefore, the maximum number of vertices labelled 'r' within ]0, 1[ is 0.
    max_r_vertices = 0
    print(f"\nFinal Conclusion: The maximum number of vertices labelled 'r' within ]0, 1[ is {max_r_vertices}.")
