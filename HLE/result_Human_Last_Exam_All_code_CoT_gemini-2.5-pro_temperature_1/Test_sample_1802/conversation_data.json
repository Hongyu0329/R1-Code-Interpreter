    "To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional qudit, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Complementary Channel Rank to Original Channel Rank:** I will start with the fundamental theorem from quantum information theory which states that for any quantum channel $\\Phi$, its rank is equal to the rank of its complementary channel, $\\tilde{\\Phi}$. This means $\\text{rank}(\\Lambda) = \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda})$. This simplifies the problem, as we now only need to find the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Pauli Channel's Rank:** A Pauli channel on a qudit is defined as $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} U_{k,l} \\rho U_{k,l}^\\dagger$. The operators $\\{U_{k,l}\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_{k,l}\\}$ is a probability distribution. The rank of a channel is equivalent to its Kraus rank, which is the number of linearly independent operators in its Kraus representation. For the Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are $\\{\\sqrt{p_{k,l}} U_{k,l}\\}$.\n\n3.  **Determine the Maximal Rank:** The set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{k,l}\\}$ forms an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices, which means they are linearly independent. Therefore, the rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ is simply the number of non-zero probability coefficients $p_{k,l}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Maximum Value:** To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero $p_{k,l}$. Since the coefficients form a probability distribution, we can choose all $d^2$ of them to be positive (for instance, $p_{k,l} = 1/d^2$ for all $k,l$). This leads to a maximal rank of $d^2$.\n\n5.  **Provide Python Code:** Based on this derivation, the maximal rank is $d^2$. I will provide a Python script that explains this logic and calculates the result for a user-specified dimension $d$.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_pauli_channel_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximal rank of the complementary channel\n    of a Pauli channel for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This program determines the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel for a d-dimensional quantum system (qudit).\")\n\n    # --- Theoretical Derivation ---\n    print(\"\\n--- Theoretical Derivation ---\")\n    print(\"Step 1: A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of a quantum channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel.\")\n    print(\"This simplifies the problem to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel itself.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: A Pauli channel \\u039B for a d-dimensional system is defined by its action on a density matrix \\u03C1:\")\n    print(\"  \\u039B(\\u03C1) = \\u2211_{k,l=0}^{d-1} p_{k,l} U_{k,l} \\u03C1 U_{k,l}^\\u2020\")\n    print(\"where {U_{k,l}} are the d\\u00b2 generalized Pauli operators, and {p_{k,l}} are probabilities.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: The rank of a channel equals the number of linearly independent operators in its Kraus representation.\")\n    print(\"For the Pauli channel, the Kraus operators are {\\u221A(p_{k,l}) U_{k,l}}.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: The d\\u00b2 generalized Pauli operators {U_{k,l}} are linearly independent.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the rank of the Pauli channel is the number of operators with a non-zero probability coefficient, p_{k,l} > 0.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: To maximize the rank, we must maximize the number of non-zero coefficients.\")\n    print(\"We can choose all d\\u00b2 probabilities to be positive (e.g., p_{k,l} = 1/d\\u00b2 for all k, l).\")\n    print(\"This results in a channel with d\\u00b2 linearly independent Kraus operators, so the maximal rank of the Pauli channel is d\\u00b2.\")\n\n    try:\n        if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n            d_str = sys.argv[1]\n            print(f\"\\nUsing dimension 'd' provided from command line: {d_str}\")\n        else:\n            d_str = input(\"\\nEnter the dimension 'd' of the qudit (e.g., 2 for a qubit): \")\n        \n        d = int(d_str)\n        if d < 2:\n            print(\"Error: Dimension 'd' must be an integer greater than or equal to 2.\")\n            return\n    except (ValueError, IndexError):\n        print(\"Error: Invalid input.
