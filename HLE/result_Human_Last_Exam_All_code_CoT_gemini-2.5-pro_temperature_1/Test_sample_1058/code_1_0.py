    print("  - Since knocking down Slc6a11 mimics the alcohol-preferring phenotype, we infer that alcohol-preferring rats have naturally lower GABA transporter function.")

    print("\n3. State the consequences:")
    print("  - Lower GABA transporter function leads to higher levels of extracellular GABA.")
    print("  - Higher extracellular GABA leads to increased activation of GABA receptors and increased tonic inhibition.")

    print("\n4. Evaluate Answer Choice C:")
    print("  - 'The GABA receptors are more active in alcohol-preferring rats.' -> Correct. This is a direct result of higher GABA levels.")
    print("  - 'GABA receptor agonist may decrease the self-administration of alcohol by alcohol-preferring rats.' -> Plausible. This is a known therapeutic strategy for addiction (substitution).")
