    This function analyzes the provided options and identifies the correct
    nonstandard analysis characterization of continuity.

    The key insight from nonstandard analysis is that a function f is continuous
    at a standard point x0 if and only if it maps every point infinitesimally
    close to x0 to a point infinitesimally close to f(x0).

    Let's check the options:
    - A: Only considers standard points, which is too weak.
    - B: States that for any standard point x0 and any point x1 infinitesimally
         close to x0, f(x1) is infinitesimally close to f(x0). This is the
         correct definition of continuity on the whole space.
    - C: This is the definition of a stronger property, S-continuity, which
         is related to uniform continuity.
    - D, E, F: These are converses of A, B, and C, and describe different
               properties (like injectivity), not continuity.

    Therefore, the correct option is B.
