    "The user is asking for a mathematical relationship between three quantities related to number theory: a squarefree natural number $(N)$, the covolume $(V)$, and an upper bound denoted as $(k_{k,\\infty})$. This is best understood in the context of quadratic number fields.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the User's Terms:** I will interpret the user's request in the context of an **imaginary quadratic number field**, $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$, where $N$ is a squarefree positive integer. This choice is guided by the typical appearance of $\\pi$ in the formulas for such fields, which is hinted at by the general theory.\n    *   **Squarefree Natural Number $(N)$**: Defines the field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$.\n    *   **Covolume $(V)$**: This refers to the volume of the fundamental domain of the lattice formed by the ring of integers of $K$. For an imaginary quadratic field, this is given by $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}}{2}$, where $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field.\n    *   **Upper Bound $(k_{k,\\infty})$**: I will interpret this as the **Minkowski Bound**. This bound is crucial in number theory because it guarantees that every ideal class in the class group of $K$ contains an integral ideal with a norm less than or equal to this bound. For an imaginary quadratic field, the Minkowski bound is $B = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$.\n\n2.  **Establish the Relationship:** By expressing both the covolume $(V)$ and the Minkowski bound $(B)$ in terms of the discriminant $(\\Delta_K)$, I can find a direct relationship between them.\n    *   From $V = \\frac{\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}}{2}$, we get $\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|} = 2V$.\n    *   Substituting this into the formula for the bound $B$, we get $B = \\frac{2}{\\pi}(2V) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}V$.\n    *   This gives us the clear and elegant relationship: **Minkowski Bound = (4/Ï€) * Covolume**.\n\n3.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Takes a sample squarefree integer, `N` (e.g., `N=5`).\n    *   Calculates the discriminant $\\Delta_K$ for the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-N})$.\n    *   Computes the numerical values for the covolume `V` and the Minkowski bound `B`.\n    *   Prints the final relationship as a formatted equation with the calculated numbers, as requested by the user.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_field_properties(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays properties for the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(-N)).\n\n    The user is asking for the relationship between the covolume (V) and an upper bound\n    for an ideal's norm (which we interpret as the Minkowski bound, B), for a field\n    defined by a squarefree natural number N.
