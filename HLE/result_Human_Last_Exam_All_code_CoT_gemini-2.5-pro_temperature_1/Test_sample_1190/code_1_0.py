    # --- Step 1: Define core principles of RAR function ---
    print("### Core Principles of Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) Function ###\n")
    print("1. Modular Structure: RAR has separate, distinct functional domains.")
    print("   - DNA-Binding Domain (DBD): Binds to specific DNA sequences (RAREs).")
    print("   - Ligand-Binding Domain (LBD): Binds retinoic acid (RA) and mediates transcriptional activation.\n")
    
    print("2. Separable Functions: DNA binding and ligand binding are distinct events.")
    print("   - The RAR/RXR heterodimer can bind to DNA even in the *absence* of the RA ligand.")
    print("   - Therefore, a mutation that abolishes RA binding does not necessarily abolish DNA binding.\n")

    print("3. Transcriptional Activation is a Multi-step Process:")
    print("   - It requires (A) binding to DNA, (B) binding the RA ligand, and (C) recruiting coactivator proteins.")
    print("   - A mutation can disrupt step (C) without affecting (A) or (B).\n")

    # --- Step 2: Evaluate each choice based on these principles ---
    print("### Evaluation of Answer Choices ###\n")

    # --- Choice A ---
    print("--- Analyzing Choice A ---")
    print("Statement: RAR mutants with insertions at sites g and h disrupt transcriptional activation but retain DNA binding.")
    print("Analysis: This is a classic 'separation-of-function' scenario. Mutations in the LBD that specifically disrupt the coactivator binding surface (the AF-2 helix) would eliminate transcriptional activation. However, such mutations would not affect the separate DBD, so the mutant receptor could still bind to DNA. This is a very plausible experimental outcome.")
    print("Verdict: Highly Plausible.\n")

    # --- Choice B ---
    print("--- Analyzing Choice B ---")
    print("Statement: Mutants c, d, and e demonstrate identical effects on RA binding, yet differ significantly in DNA binding ability.")
    print("Analysis: This is unlikely. If mutations affect RA binding, they are located in the LBD. It is not expected that mutations in the LBD would have differing effects on the function of the separate DBD.")
    print("Verdict: Unlikely.\n")

    # --- Choice C ---
    print("--- Analyzing Choice C ---")
    print("Statement: Insertions at k and l lead to loss of RA binding and DNA binding, thus affecting transcriptional activation.")
    print("Analysis: This is possible if the mutations cause a global misfolding of the protein. However, based on the modular nature of RAR, it is more likely that a mutation would affect one domain specifically (e.g., a DBD mutation affects DNA binding; an LBD mutation affects RA binding). This statement is less specific and less likely than A.")
    print("Verdict: Possible, but not the best description.\n")

    # --- Choice D ---
    print("--- Analyzing Choice D ---")
    print("Statement: All mutants that are defective in RA binding are also defective in both DNA binding and transcriptional activation, indicating a linked mechanism.")
    print("Analysis: This is factually incorrect. The receptor binds DNA without its ligand. Therefore, a defect in RA binding does not imply a defect in DNA binding. The mechanisms are separable, not intrinsically linked.")
    print("Verdict: Incorrect.\n")

    # --- Choice E ---
    print("--- Analyzing Choice E ---")
    print("Statement: Mutants f through m uniformly exhibit enhanced RA binding compared to wild-type, despite varying effects on transcriptional activation.")
    print("Analysis: This is highly improbable. Random mutations are far more likely to be disruptive or neutral than to consistently *enhance* a specific function like ligand binding across multiple sites.")
    print("Verdict: Improbable.\n")

    # --- Step 3: Final Conclusion ---
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Conclusion: Choice A describes the most accurate and scientifically sound relationship. It reflects the well-established principle that transcriptional activation can be disrupted independently of DNA binding due to the modular nature of the receptor.")
    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------")
