    # Part (a): Can F and G contain multisets with disjoint supports?
    #
    # Let F be a multiset in the family F and G be a multiset in the family G.
    # The families are cross 1-intersecting, which means |F ∩ G| ≥ 1 for any choice of F and G.
    # The support of a multiset, supp(S), is the set of its distinct elements.
    # If F and G have disjoint supports (i.e., supp(F) ∩ supp(G) = ∅), it implies that
    # they do not share any common elements.
    # If they have no elements in common, their multiset intersection F ∩ G is the empty multiset.
    # The size of the empty multiset is 0, so |F ∩ G| = 0.
    # This contradicts the cross 1-intersecting condition |F ∩ G| ≥ 1.
    # Therefore, no multiset in F can have a disjoint support with any multiset in G.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b): If k=2 and m=5, what is |F|+|G| for sum maximal cross 1-intersecting families?
    #
    # We are given parameters k=2, m=5, and t=1 (cross 1-intersecting).
    # The problem states m ≥ k+1, and here we have 5 ≥ 2+1, so the condition holds.
    # A theorem on cross-t-intersecting families of multisets states that for m ≥ k+t,
    # the maximum value of |F| + |G| is given by the formula: 2 * C(m + k - t - 1, k - t),
    # where C(n, r) is the binomial coefficient "n choose r".
    m = 5
    k = 2
    t = 1
    
    # Calculate the values for the binomial coefficient
    n_for_comb = m + k - t - 1
    k_for_comb = k - t
    
    # Calculate the binomial coefficient and the final result
    comb_val = math.comb(n_for_comb, k_for_comb)
    answer_b = 2 * comb_val
    
    # Part (c): Must F necessarily contain all k-multisets that include a fixed element to achieve maximality?
    #
    # This asks if the structure F = {A ∈ binom([m], k) : i ∈ A} for some fixed i is the only
    # one that achieves the maximal sum.
    # While this structure is indeed maximal, it is not always the only one.
    # The uniqueness holds for m > k+t, but not necessarily for the boundary case m = k+t.
    # For t=1, this boundary case is m = k+1.
    # Let's consider a counterexample with k=2, m=3 (which satisfies m = k+1 and m ≥ k+1, k ≥ 2).
    # The maximum sum is 2 * C(3+2-1-1, 2-1) = 2 * C(3,1) = 6.
    # One maximal construction is F = G = {{1,1}, {1,2}, {1,3}}, which is the set of all 2-multisets containing 1.
    # However, consider the family F' = G' = {{1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}}.
    # This is also cross-1-intersecting, and |F'|+|G'| = 3+3=6, which is maximal.
    # But F' is not the family of all 2-multisets containing a fixed element (e.g., it contains {2,3}
    # which has no 1, and it's missing {1,1}).
    # Since a valid counterexample exists, the answer is No.
    answer_c = "No"

    # Print the final combined answer in the required format.
    # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation for part (b).
