    # This implies the width is also 3 units. Let's define the corners.

    # Step 3: Define point 'p'.
    # "Draw a segment from b1 that reaches down to the next ruled line (y=-4),
    # and right about 2/3 of the horizontal distance to b2 (dist=3, so 2/3*3=2)."

    # "Draw a horizontal line segment...from the right edge...to the vertical line that p and q are on. Let a1 be the new endpoint."
