    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability of selecting the specific bottleneck edge in a single step of the randomized uniform gossiping process on a 10-node barbell graph.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is composed of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each, connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck\".\n2.  **Identify the Nodes of the Bottleneck Edge:** Let's call the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge `u` and `v`. Node `u` is in the first clique, and node `v` is in the second.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees:** We need to find the degree of nodes `u` and `v`. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n    *   For node `u`, it's connected to the other 4 nodes in its 5-node clique. It's also connected to node `v` via the bottleneck. So, its total degree is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   Similarly, the degree of node `v` is also `5`.\n4.  **Understand the Gossiping Process:** The process involves two random selections:\n    *   First, a node is selected uniformly at random from all 10 nodes. The probability of picking any specific node is `1/10`.\n    *   Second, one of the selected node's neighbors is chosen uniformly at random. If a node `x` has a degree of `d(x)`, the probability of choosing any specific neighbor is `1/d(x)`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if we first pick node `u` and then its neighbor `v`, OR if we first pick node `v` and then its neighbor `u`. We can sum these two probabilities.\n    *   `P(sampling edge) = P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)`\n    *   This translates to: `P(edge) = (1/n) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/n) * (1/degree(v))`, where `n` is the total number of nodes.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A barbell graph with n nodes consists of two cliques of size m = n / 2.\n    clique_size = total_nodes // 2\n\n    # Let the bottleneck edge connect node 'u' from the first clique\n    # and node 'v' from the second clique.\n\n    # The degree of node 'u' is its connections within its clique (clique_size - 1)\n    # plus its one connection through the bottleneck edge.\n    degree_u = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # The degree of node 'v' is calculated in the same way.\n    degree_v = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # The probability of sampling the edge (u, v) is:\n    # P(edge) = P(picking u) * P(picking v | u) + P(picking v) * P(picking u | v)\n    # P(edge) = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u) + (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)\n    prob_u_then_v = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_u)\n    prob_v_then_u = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_v)\n    total_prob = prob_u_then_v + prob_v_then_u\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"Step 1: Define graph parameters.\")\n    print(f\"Total nodes (n): {total_nodes}\")\n    print(f\"Size of each clique (m): {clique_size}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate degrees of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge (u and v).\")\n    print(f\"Degree of u, deg(u) = (m-1) + 1 = ({clique_size}-1) + 1 = {degree_u}\")\n    print(f\"Degree of v, deg(v) = (m-1) + 1 = ({clique_size}-1) + 1 = {degree_v}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the probability.\")\n    print(\"The probability is P(pick u)*P(pick v | u) + P(pick v)*P(pick u | v)\")\n    print(\"P(edge) = (1/n) * (1/deg(u)) + (1/n) * (1/deg(v))\")\n    print(f\"P(edge) = (1 / {total_nodes}) * (1 / {degree_u}) + (1 / {total_nodes}) * (1 / {degree_v})\")\n    print(f\"P(edge) = {prob_u_then_v} + {prob_v_then_u}\")\n    print(f\"P(edge) = {total_prob}\")\n    print(f\"\\nAs a fraction, the probability is 1/{int(1/total_prob)}.\")\n\ncalculate_bottleneck_probability()\n<<<0.04>>>\n```"
