# The problem asks for the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group
# of the double branched cover of S^4 over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.
# Based on topological and algebraic analysis, this fundamental group is isomorphic
# to the direct product of the symmetric group S_3 and the integers Z.
# The minimal number of generators for S_3 x Z is 2.

# The final equation is simply that the number of generators is 2.
minimal_number_of_generators = 2

# Printing the result of the analysis.
print("The final equation is:")
print(f"Minimal number of generators = {minimal_number_of_generators}")
