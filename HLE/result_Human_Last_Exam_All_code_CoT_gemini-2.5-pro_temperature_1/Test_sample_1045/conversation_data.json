    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene (C7H8) molecule with the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom type for 6-31G:**\n    *   **For each Carbon atom (a second-row element):**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is described by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitive Gaussians).\n        *   The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. The inner part (2s, 2p) is described by 4 contracted functions (1 for s, 3 for p), and the outer part (2s, 2p) is also described by 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Total for one Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted functions.\n    *   **For each Hydrogen atom (a first-row element):**\n        *   It only has a 1s valence orbital, which is split. The inner part is 1 contracted function, and the outer part is 1 contracted function.\n        *   Total for one Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2 contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\n    *   Total = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2) = 63 + 16 = 79.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation and prints the result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of contracted functions\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H) = {total_functions_carbon} + {total_functions_hydrogen} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
