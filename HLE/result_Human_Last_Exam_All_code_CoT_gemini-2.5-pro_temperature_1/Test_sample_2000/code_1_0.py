    This script calculates the maximum generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph
    with 3 hyperedges, assuming the 'edge-width' definition.

    The problem states that the rank of the hypergraph is not bounded.
    The 'generalised hypertreewidth' can refer to two measures:
    1. Vertex-width: The maximum number of vertices in any bag of the decomposition.
       Under this definition, the width is bounded by the rank. If the rank is
       unbounded, so is the width.
    2. Edge-width: The maximum number of hyperedges associated with any bag.
       This measure is bounded for a fixed number of edges.

    For the question to have a specific numerical answer, it must refer to the
    edge-width.

    The maximum edge-width for a given number of hyperedges occurs when the
    hypergraph is as cyclic as possible. With 3 hyperedges, the most complex
    structure is a 3-cycle (C_3).

    The formula for the generalised hypertreewidth (edge-width) of a cyclic
    hypergraph C_n is: floor(n/2) + 1.

    We apply this formula for n=3.
