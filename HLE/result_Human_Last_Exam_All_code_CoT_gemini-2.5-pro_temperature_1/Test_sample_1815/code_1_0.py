    This function solves the mathematical problem posed by the user.
    The problem asks for the number of totally bounded group topologies on the integers, 
    with no nontrivial convergent sequences.

    Our step-by-step derivation shows:
    1. A group topology with no nontrivial convergent sequences (property S) that is also T1 must be the discrete topology.
    2. The discrete topology on the infinite group of integers is not totally bounded.
    3. If the topology is not T1, it must have a proper open subgroup H isomorphic to the integers, on which the subspace topology must also be a solution.
    4. This recursive structure allows the construction of a nontrivial sequence converging to 0, which is a contradiction.
    5. Therefore, no such topology exists. The number is 0.
