# Based on the analysis, the original equation likely contains a typo.
# The assumed corrected equation y^2(dy/dx)^2 + 6xy(dy/dx) + 9x^2 - x^2y^2 = 0
# factors into two separable first-order ODEs.

# The solutions to these ODEs represent the general solution.
# Solution 1: y + 3*ln|y-3| = x^2/2 + C
# Solution 2: y - 3*ln|y+3| = -x^2/2 + C

# We will print these two equations as the general solution.
# Note: sympy's ln is natural log, and Abs is used for absolute value.
