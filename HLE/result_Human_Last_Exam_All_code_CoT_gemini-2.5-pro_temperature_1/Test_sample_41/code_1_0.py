def find_most_inhibiting_factor():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the numerical value from the provided meteorological data
    that has the greatest negative impact on tornadogenesis.

    In the given SHARPpy data, many parameters are extremely favorable for tornadoes
    (e.g., high SRH, low LCL, high STP). We must find the biggest inhibiting factor.

    - SFC CINH of -38: This is a moderate cap, but the very high STP of 4.7 suggests
      it is not the primary limiting factor.
    - DCAPE of 994: This indicates strong downdraft potential, which can disrupt a storm,
      but it is not always a primary inhibitor.
    - SFC LFC of 1240: The Level of Free Convection is at 1240 meters. The cloud base (LCL)
      is at 228 meters. The large gap between these two levels (1012 meters) requires
      a rising parcel to be mechanically forced upward for a long distance before it can
      accelerate on its own. This significantly weakens the low-level updraft, which is
      critical for tornado formation, making it the most significant inhibitor in this
      otherwise volatile environment.
