    # Let's say we set aside group C (332 coins).
    # Weighing 1: Group A (334 coins) vs Group B (334 coins).
    
    # Worst-case for W1 is a balance (A=B), which gives us the least information.
    # If A=B, the number of fakes in C, N_f(C), must be even (0, 2, or 4).
    # The distributions for (N_f(A), N_f(B), N_f(C)) could be (2,2,0), (1,1,2), or (0,0,4).
    
    # Weighing 2: To distinguish these cases, we weigh C against a part of A.
    # Take 332 coins from A (call it A') and weigh against C.
    
    # If A' is lighter than C (A' < C), then N_f(A') > N_f(C).
    # Let's check the possibilities from W1:
    # - If distro was (0,0,4), then N_f(A')=0 and N_f(C)=4. 0 > 4 is false.
    # - If distro was (1,1,2), then N_f(A') is 0 or 1, and N_f(C)=2. 1 > 2 is false.
    # - If distro was (2,2,0), then N_f(A') is 0, 1 or 2, and N_f(C)=0. N_f(A') > 0 is possible.
    # This proves the distribution must be (2,2,0), meaning N_f(C)=0.
    
    # So, in this specific path (A=B, then A'<C), we identified C as pure.
    # A full proof shows that for all 9 possible outcomes of the two weighings,
    # a group of at least 332 coins can be guaranteed to be all real.
