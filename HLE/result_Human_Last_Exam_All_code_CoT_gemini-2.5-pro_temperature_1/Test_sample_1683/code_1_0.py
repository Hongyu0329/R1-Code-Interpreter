    # Starting Material: (2-bromophenyl)methanol
    # It has a primary alcohol (-CH2OH) and a bromo (-Br) group on adjacent carbons of a benzene ring.
    
    # --- Step 1: Formation of Compound 1 ---
    # Reagents: 1) n-BuLi, 2) diethyl carbonate
    # The strong base n-BuLi performs two actions: first, it deprotonates the acidic alcohol proton,
    # and second, it performs a lithium-halogen exchange to replace the bromine with lithium.
    # This creates a nucleophilic aryllithium species.
    # The aryllithium attacks the electrophilic carbonyl of diethyl carbonate, forming an ethyl ester.
    # After workup, Compound 1 is ethyl 2-(hydroxymethyl)benzoate.

    }
    
    # --- Step 2: Formation of Compound 2 ---
    # Reagent: dichlorodimethylsilane (Me2SiCl2)
    # Dichlorodimethylsilane reacts with the alcohol group of Compound 1. To form a stable product,
    # it's likely that two molecules of Compound 1 react with one molecule of Me2SiCl2.
    # This forms a dimer linked by a dimethylsilyl ether bridge, protecting the alcohol groups.
    # Compound 2 is bis(2-ethoxycarbonylbenzyl)dimethylsilane.
    compound_2 = {
        "name": "bis(2-ethoxycarbonylbenzyl)dimethylsilane",
        "formula": "C22H28O6Si"
    }

    # --- Step 3: Formation of Compound 3 ---
    # Reagent: Li/naphthalene in THF
    # Lithium naphthalenide is a strong reducing agent. It reduces the two ester groups (-COOEt)
    # on Compound 2 down to primary alcohols (-CH2OH).
    # Compound 3 is bis(2-(hydroxymethyl)benzyl)dimethylsilane.
    compound_3 = {
        "name": "bis(2-(hydroxymethyl)benzyl)dimethylsilane",
        "formula": "C18H24O4Si"
    }
    
    # --- Step 4: Formation of Compound 4 ---
    # Reagent: Jones reagent (CrO3, H2SO4, acetone)
    # The harsh acidic conditions of the Jones reagent first cleave the acid-labile Si-O bonds of the silyl ether.
    # This hydrolysis breaks the dimer apart, yielding two molecules of 1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)benzene.
    # The powerful Jones reagent then oxidizes both primary alcohol groups (-CH2OH) on each molecule to carboxylic acids (-COOH).
    # The final product is a benzene ring with two adjacent carboxylic acid groups.
