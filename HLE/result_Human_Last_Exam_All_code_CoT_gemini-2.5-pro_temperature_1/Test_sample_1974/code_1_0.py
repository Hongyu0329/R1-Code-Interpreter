    print("------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The Matiyasevich (MRDP) theorem states that a statement of the form 'a Diophantine equation D has no solutions in the natural numbers' is equivalent to a Π₁ arithmetic sentence.")
    print("A Π₁ sentence is of the form '∀n₁, n₂, ... P(n₁, n₂, ...)' where P is a computable predicate.")
    print("Let U(D) be the Π₁ sentence 'D has no solutions'. The conditions on D are:")
    print("  1. U(D) is true (in the standard model of arithmetic).")
    print("  2. ZFC does not prove U(D).")
    print("  3. ZFC + ψ does prove U(D).")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 2: Constructing one element of S to show the set is non-empty.")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("The statement 'ZFC + ψ is consistent' is a Π₁ sentence. Let's call it Con(ZFC+ψ).")
    print("By Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, if ZFC + ψ is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency.")
    print("However, the problem gives us a model M[G] where ZFC + ψ holds, so it is consistent.")
    print("\nLet's analyze the provability of Con(ZFC+ψ):")
    print("  - Is Con(ZFC+ψ) provable in ZFC?")
    print("    No. If ZFC proved Con(ZFC+ψ), it would be proving that adding ¬ψ (which is consistent with ZFC) does not create a contradiction. This is related to ZFC proving its own consistency, which it cannot do.")
    print("  - Is Con(ZFC+ψ) provable in ZFC + ψ?")
    print("    Yes. This is a subtle but standard result. From within a theory T, you can prove that adding axioms that are already theorems of T does not affect consistency. ZFC + ψ proves ψ, so it can also prove Con(ZFC + ψ). A simpler way to see it is to construct a Turing machine T that halts if and only if it finds a proof of a contradiction from ZFC+ψ. The statement 'T never halts' is equivalent to Con(ZFC+ψ). ZFC+ψ can prove this statement by reasoning that the existence of such a proof would entail a contradiction, which is impossible in a consistent system.")
    print("\nBy the MRDP theorem, the true Π₁ sentence Con(ZFC+ψ) corresponds to a Diophantine equation D_cons whose unsolvability is equivalent to Con(ZFC+ψ).")
    print("Therefore, this D_cons is in S. So, S is not empty.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 3: Showing the cardinality of S is at least countably infinite (ℵ₀).")
    print("------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Let D_cons be the equation from Step 2. Let U(D_cons) be the Π₁ sentence for its unsolvability.")
    print("Now, consider the set of all Diophantine equations whose unsolvability is already provable in ZFC. This set is countably infinite.")
    print("Let D_k be any such equation (e.g., x + k = 0 for k > 0), and let U(D_k) be the corresponding true Π₁ sentence provable in ZFC.")
    print("\nFor each such D_k, we can construct a new Diophantine equation D_new_k whose unsolvability corresponds to the Π₁ sentence:")

    print("\nLet's check the properties of D_new_k:")
    print("  1. Is its unsolvability true? Yes, because both conjuncts are true.")
    print("  2. Is its unsolvability provable in ZFC? No. To prove the conjunction, ZFC would need to prove U(D_cons), which we established it cannot.")
    print("  3. Is its unsolvability provable in ZFC + ψ? Yes. ZFC proves U(D_k) and ZFC+ψ proves U(D_cons), so ZFC+ψ can prove the conjunction.")
    print("\nSince there are countably many choices for D_k, we can generate a countably infinite family of distinct equations D_new_k that are all in S.")
    print("Therefore, the cardinality of S is at least ℵ₀.")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 4: Showing the cardinality of S is at most countably infinite.")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("A Diophantine equation is a polynomial set to zero, e.g., P(x₁, ..., xₙ) = 0.")
    print("Any such polynomial is defined by a finite number of integer coefficients and variable exponents.")
    print("The set of all finite sequences of integers is countably infinite.")
    print("Therefore, the set of all possible Diophantine equations is countably infinite.")
    print("The set S is a subset of the set of all Diophantine equations. Any subset of a countable set is itself at most countable (i.e., finite or countably infinite).")
    print("\n")

    print("Step 5: Conclusion.")
    print("-------------------")
    print("From Step 3, we know |S| ≥ ℵ₀.")
    print("From Step 4, we know |S| ≤ ℵ₀.")
    print("Combining these two facts, the maximum possible cardinality of S must be exactly ℵ₀.")
