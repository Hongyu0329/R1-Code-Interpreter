    "The Chern number is a topological invariant that quantifies the topology of the electronic band structure. A key property of the Chern number is that it is additive. When two systems are brought together and their individual electronic gaps do not close, the Chern number of the combined system is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual systems.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number of 1. They are connected laterally with a negligible tunneling barrier, forming a junction. The Chern number of this composite system can be found by simply adding the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the Chern number for the first insulator, `C1 = 1`.\n2.  Define the Chern number for the second insulator, `C2 = 1`.\n3.  Calculate the total Chern number of the junction, `C_total`, by summing `C1` and `C2`.\n4.  Print the final equation and the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two individual insulators\nC1 = 1\nC2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nC_total = C1 + C2\n\n# Print the result, showing the full equation\nprint(f\"The first Chern insulator has a Chern number C1 = {C1}.\")\nprint(f\"The second Chern insulator has a Chern number C2 = {C2}.\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual numbers: C_total = {C1} + {C2} = {C_total}.\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
