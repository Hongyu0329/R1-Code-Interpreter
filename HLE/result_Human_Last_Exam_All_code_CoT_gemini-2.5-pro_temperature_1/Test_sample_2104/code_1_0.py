# Step 1: Determine n1 and n2
# Based on the properties of the order of the Picard-Fuchs equation,
# the first and second smallest positive integers n satisfying the given conditions
# are n1 = 4 and n2 = 6.
n1 = 4
n2 = 6

# Step 2: Determine the argument alpha for the function T
# alpha = (n1 - 1) / n2
alpha = (n1 - 1) / n2

# Step 3: Determine the specific Hamiltonian H(p, q)
# The Hamiltonian is given by H = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - C * q^(n1/2)),
# where C = (2/n1) * sqrt((n2 - n1) / (n1 / 2)).
# Let's calculate the constant C and the exponent.
C_numerator = n2 - n1
C_denominator = n1 / 2
C = (2 / n1) * math.sqrt(C_numerator / C_denominator)
exponent = n1 / 2

# With n1=4 and n2=6:
# C = (2/4) * sqrt((6-4)/(4/2)) = 0.5 * sqrt(2/2) = 0.5 * 1 = 0.5
# exponent = 4/2 = 2
# So, H = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - 0.5 * q^2) = 1/2 * (p^2 + 0.5 * q^2)
# H = 1/2 * p^2 + 1/4 * q^2

# Step 4: Calculate the period T
# This Hamiltonian is for a simple harmonic oscillator H = p^2/(2m) + (k/2)*q^2.
# By comparing the terms, we find m = 1 and k = 1/2.
m = 1.0
k = 0.5

# The period of this oscillator is T = 2 * pi * sqrt(m/k).
# The problem implies that T(alpha) is this period. Since the period is constant,
# T(alpha) is a constant function. We need to find T(alpha), which is just this value.
period = 2 * math.pi * math.sqrt(m / k)

# Step 5: Print the results as requested
