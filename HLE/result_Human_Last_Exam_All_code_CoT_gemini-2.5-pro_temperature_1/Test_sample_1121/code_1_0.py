# Part 1: Number of logical non-Clifford gates for a universal Toffoli gate.
# A standard and efficient decomposition of a Toffoli gate into the Clifford+T gate set
# requires 7 T-gates. This represents the logical gate count for a fundamental
# universal computing operation.
num_gates_d3 = 7

# Part 2: Approximate number of physical non-Clifford gates for one logical
# non-Clifford gate with a d=5 code and p=1% error rate.
# This requires a two-level magic state distillation factory using the 15-to-1 protocol.
# Level 1 cost: 15 physical T-gates are needed to produce 1 Level-1 state.
# Level 2 cost: 15 Level-1 states are needed to produce 1 final high-fidelity state.
# Total physical T-gates = (cost of level 2) * (cost of level 1)
num_gates_d5 = 15 * 15

# The final equation showing the sum of the two calculated numbers.
