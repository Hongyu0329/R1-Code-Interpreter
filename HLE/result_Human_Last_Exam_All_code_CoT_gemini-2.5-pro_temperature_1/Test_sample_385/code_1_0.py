def find_latin_quote():
    """
    This function stores and prints the requested five-word Latin quote.

    The quote is from Tacitus's "Agricola" (chapter 30), spoken by his
    father-in-law, Agricola, before the Battle of Mons Graupius.
    It is "omne ignotum pro magnifico est," meaning "everything unknown is
    considered magnificent." This is very similar to a phrase in
    Cornelius Nepos' "Life of Chabrias."
