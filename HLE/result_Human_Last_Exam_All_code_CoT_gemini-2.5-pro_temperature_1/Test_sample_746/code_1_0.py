    This function states the result of the mathematical problem regarding
    the maximum number of dispersion points in a compact connected metric space.

    The logical proof demonstrates two key facts:
    1. The number of dispersion points cannot exceed 1.
    2. Spaces with exactly 1 dispersion point are known to exist.

    Combining these facts, the maximum possible number is 1.
