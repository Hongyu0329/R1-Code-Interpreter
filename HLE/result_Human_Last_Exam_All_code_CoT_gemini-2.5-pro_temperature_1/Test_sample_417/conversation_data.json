    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we will analyze the molecule's structure and symmetry.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring with three identical, large, chiral substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule C3 rotational symmetry. This symmetry simplifies the problem, as we only need to count the unique proton environments for one-third of the molecule: the protons associated with the central ring and the protons of one of the three identical substituent arms.\n2.  **Count Unique Proton Signals from the Central Core:** We will determine the number of chemically distinct proton environments on the 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n3.  **Count Unique Proton Signals from One Substituent Arm:** We will meticulously identify every chemically non-equivalent proton in one of the `[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]` arms, paying close attention to stereochemistry. The chirality of the arm will make many protons non-equivalent (diastereotopic).\n4.  **Sum the Signals:** The total number of expected peaks is the sum of the unique signals from the core and from one arm. The following Python code will formalize this counting process.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule by analyzing its symmetry and counting unique proton environments.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The molecule possesses C3 rotational symmetry.
