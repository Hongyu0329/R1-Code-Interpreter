A small correction is assumed for the intersection property: `U_i \cap U_j` is non-empty iff `|i-j| <= 1`, which is standard for a chain cover. This property of admitting such chain covers for any resolution is the definition of `X` being an 'arc-like' (or 'chainable') continuum.",

Since homeomorphisms must map end points to other end points, the set of all end points `E` must be a union of orbits, and the same applies to the set of non-end points `I = X \\ E`. With only two orbits in total, they must be `E` and `I`.",
