    # --- Analysis for Question 1 ---
    # Question: Is it true that for a d-neighbor N of Z^12, R_2(M) can be of type A_11?
    # Plan: To have R_2(M) be exactly A_11 = {e_i - e_j}, the glue code w = (w_1, ..., w_12)
    # for the sublattice M must satisfy certain conditions for some integer d > 1.
    # 1. (e_i - e_j) in M => w_i - w_j = 0 (mod d). This means all w_i are equal, say to c.
    # 2. (e_i + e_j) not in M => w_i + w_j != 0 (mod d). With w_i=w_j=c, this becomes 2*c != 0 (mod d).
    # 3. Index of M in Z^12 is d => gcd(w_1, ..., w_12, d) = 1, which means gcd(c, d) = 1.

    # Question: Can the visible root system R_2(M) of a d-neighbor N of Z^15 contain a D_7 component?
    # Plan: For R_2(M) to contain a D_k component (here k=7), the glue code w must satisfy:
    # 1. On the k indices of the component (say I = {1, ..., 7}), w_i must be equal to some c.
    # 2. The vectors {+/-e_i +/-e_j} for i,j in I must be in M. This implies w_i +/- w_j = 0 (mod d),
    #    which gives w_i=w_j=c and 2*c = 0 (mod d).
    # 3. The overall index must be d, so gcd(w_1, ..., w_15, d) = 1.
