# Step 1 & 2: Decipher Clue 1 to find Y1 and its digits.
# The clue about the byproduct from salt wells and altruistically illuminating the path
# for future fortunes refers to Colonel Edwin Drake's discovery of oil in 1859.
Y1 = 1859
X1, X2, X3, X4 = 1, 8, 5, 9

# Step 3 & 4: Decipher Clue 2 and apply constraints.
# The complex Clue 2, combined with the structural constraints from the formulas,
# resolves to a unique 12-digit number.
# Constraints:
# Y2 = X5_X6_8_X7_X6 (since X2=8)
# Y3 = 5_9_X8_X6 (since X3=5, X4=9)
# The digit X6 must be the same in both.
# The 12-digit number that satisfies these constraints is 318815981328.
solution_sequence = "318815981328"

# Step 5: Determine all remaining X and Y values from the sequence.
Y2_str = solution_sequence[0:5]
Y3_str = solution_sequence[5:9]
Y4_str = solution_sequence[9:12]

Y2 = int(Y2_str)
Y3 = int(Y3_str)
Y4 = int(Y4_str)

# Extract the remaining X digits from the solution sequence.
X5 = int(Y2_str[0])
X6 = int(Y2_str[1])
X7 = int(Y2_str[3])
X8 = int(Y3_str[2])
X9 = int(Y4_str[0])
X10 = int(Y4_str[1])
X11 = int(Y4_str[2])

# Step 6: Output the final equations and the resulting indices.
