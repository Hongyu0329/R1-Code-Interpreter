    "My plan is to solve this state feedback problem using the pole placement method.\n\n1.  **Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial:** The desired eigenvalues are `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`. The characteristic polynomial for a second-order system is `(λ - p1)(λ - p2) = λ^2 - (p1 + p2)λ + p1*p2`.\n    *   `p1 + p2 = (-1 + j) + (-1 - j) = -2`\n    *   `p1 * p2 = (-1)^2 - j^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2`\n    *   So, the desired characteristic polynomial is `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n2.  **Determine the System's Characteristic Polynomial:** The closed-loop system matrix is `A_cl = A + BF`. Let the feedback matrix be `F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`. This results in a system of equations with four variables but only two constraints, meaning there are infinite solutions.\n\n3.  **Simplify and Solve:** To find a specific solution, I will simplify the problem by assuming a structure for `F` where its second row is zero: `F = [[f1, f2], [0, 0]]`. I will then calculate the characteristic polynomial of `A + BF` in terms of `f1` and `f2`.\n\n4.  **Equate and Find F:** By equating the coefficients of the system's polynomial with the desired polynomial, I will get a system of two linear equations for `f1` and `f2`. Solving this system gives the values for the non-zero elements of `F`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the system matrices\nA = np.array([\n    [-1, 1],\n    [1, 0]\n])\nB = np.array([\n    [1, 2],\n    [1, 0]\n])\n\n# From the analysis, we need to solve the following system of linear equations for f1 and f2:\n# f1 + f2 = -1\n# f1 + 2*f2 = -3\n# This can be written in matrix form as M * f = v\nM = np.array([\n    [1, 1],\n    [1, 2]\n])\nv = np.array([-1, -3])\n\n# Step 2: Solve the system of equations to find f1 and f2\ntry:\n    f1_f2 = np.linalg.solve(M, v)\n    f1 = f1_f2[0]\n    f2 = f1_f2[1]\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the full feedback gain matrix F\n    # We assumed f3=0 and f4=0 to find a specific solution\n    F = np.array([\n        [f1, f2],\n        [0, 0]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"The calculated state feedback gain matrix F is:\")\n    print(F)\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the elements of F is:\")\n    print(f\"F = [[{F[0,0]}, {F[0,1]}],\")\n    print(f\"     [{F[1,0]}, {F[1,1]}]]\")\n\n\n    # Step 4: Verification (Optional but good practice)\n    # Calculate the closed-loop matrix A_cl = A + B@F\n    A_cl = A + B @ F\n    # Calculate the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system\n    eigenvalues = np.linalg.eigvals(A_cl)\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification ---\")\n    print(\"Closed-loop matrix A + BF:\")\n    print(A_cl)\n    print(\"\\nEigenvalues of the closed-loop system A + BF:\")\n    # Sorting for consistent order\n    eigenvalues.sort()\n    print(np.round(eigenvalues, 5))\n    print(\"These match the desired eigenvalues of -1 +/- j.\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations could not be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<\n[[ 1. -2.]\n [ 0.  0.]]\n>>>"
