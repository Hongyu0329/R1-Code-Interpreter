    "To determine the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers required to identify any of the 21 PLL cases, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish a Theoretical Minimum:** First, we'll use a mathematical concept called the pigeonhole principle. We need to distinguish between 21 different states (the PLL cases). Each sticker we look at gives us informationâ€”specifically, its color. On a standard cube, there are 4 possible colors for the side stickers of the last layer (e.g., blue, red, green, orange). We need to find the smallest number of stickers, `n`, such that the number of possible color combinations (`4^n`) is at least 21.\n2.  **Test the Theoretical Minimum:** The number `n` found in step 1 is only a lower bound. We must then reason whether it's practically possible to find a set of `n` sticker positions that can uniquely distinguish all 21 cases. We'll find that for this minimum `n`, it's always possible to find at least two PLL cases that look identical, making `n` insufficient.\n3.  **Determine the Actual Minimum:** Since the theoretical minimum is not sufficient, the actual minimum number of stickers must be the next whole number, which is `n+1`. We will argue that this higher number is sufficient.\n\nThe following script will perform the calculation for step 1 and print the reasoning for all steps to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the theoretical minimum number of stickers needed.\n\nnum_pll_cases = 21\nnum_sticker_colors = 4\n\nprint(\"To solve this, we first establish a theoretical minimum number of stickers.\")\nprint(\"We need to distinguish between {} different PLL cases.\".format(num_pll_cases))\nprint(\"Each non-top-facing sticker can be one of {} possible colors.\".format(num_sticker_colors))\nprint(\"Let 'n' be the number of stickers we observe. The number of possible outcomes is 4^n.\")\nprint(\"We need to find the smallest 'n' where 4^n is greater than or equal to 21.\\n\")\n\n# Check n=2\nn2 = 2\noutcomes_n2 = num_sticker_colors**n2\nprint(\"For n = {}, the equation is {} ^ {} = {}.\".format(n2, num_sticker_colors, n2, outcomes_n2))\nprint(\"Since {} is less than {}, 2 stickers are not enough.\\n\".format(outcomes_n2, num_pll_cases))\n\n# Check n=3\nn3 = 3\noutcomes_n3 = num_sticker_colors**n3\nprint(\"For n = {}, the equation is {} ^ {} = {}.\".format(n3, num_sticker_colors, n3, outcomes_n3))\nprint(\"Since {} is greater than {}, the theoretical minimum number of stickers is 3.\\n\".format(outcomes_n3, num_pll_cases))\n\n# Step 2 & 3: Analyze the sufficiency of the theoretical minimum.\nprint(\"However, this theoretical minimum is not practically sufficient.\")\nprint(\"No matter which 3 sticker positions you choose, there will always be at least two PLL cases that look identical.\")\nprint(\"For example, if you observe 3 stickers on pieces that are not affected by a U-perm (a 3-cycle of edges), you cannot distinguish that U-perm from a solved state.\")\nprint(\"This means 3 stickers are not enough to resolve all ambiguities.\\n\")\nprint(\"Therefore, we must look at one more sticker.\")\nprint(\"The minimum number of stickers that must be seen to fully identify any PLL case is 4.\")\n\n```\n<<<4>>>"
