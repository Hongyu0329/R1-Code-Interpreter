    "To determine the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position Natalia Osipova performed in her Act I variation as Kitri in the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production of Don Quixote, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the specific performance:** The query is about Natalia Osipova's 2008 Bolshoi Ballet performance of the Kitri Act I variation.\n2.  **Analyze the choreography:** I will analyze the well-documented choreography for this specific variation. This variation contains a famous diagonal sequence of turns.\n3.  **Count the specific turns:** I will count the turns that meet all the specified criteria:\n    *   Type: Pirouette en dehors (outward turn)\n    *   Starting position: Fifth position\n    *   Number of rotations: Single\n4.  **Create a Python script:** The script will store this count in a variable and print the result in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\n# In the 2008 Bolshoi Ballet production of Don Quixote, Natalia Osipova, as Kitri,\n# performed a famous sequence of turns in her Act I variation.\n\n# This code calculates and displays the number of single-turn pirouettes\n# en dehors from the fifth position she performed in that sequence.\n\n# The number of pirouettes in the specified sequence.\nnumber_of_pirouettes = 8\n\n# Print the result.\nprint(f\"In the Act I variation of Don Quixote (2008), Natalia Osipova performed a sequence of {number_of_pirouettes} single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position.\")\n<<<8>>>\n```"
