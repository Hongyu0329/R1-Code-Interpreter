# The problem reduces to finding a constant value for X.
# Let's perform the final calculation.
# From the derivation, the ratio R = ||u'||^2 / ||u||^2 must be 5/4.
# The value of X is then calculated using this R.
# X = 8 / (5 + 4*R)
R = 5/4
X = 8 / (5 + 4 * R)

# We can also calculate it from the other expression
# X = (32*R) / (20*R + 25)
X_alt = (32 * R) / (20 * R + 25)

# The final answer is the value of X, which is a fraction.
# Let's represent it as a numerator and denominator.
numerator = 8
denominator = 10

# The simplified fraction
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

common_divisor = gcd(numerator, denominator)
final_numerator = numerator // common_divisor
final_denominator = denominator // common_divisor
