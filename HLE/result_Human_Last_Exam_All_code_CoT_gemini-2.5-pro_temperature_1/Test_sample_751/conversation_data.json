    "To reduce the given discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Principle of Duality**: The transformation that converts a system `(A, C)` to observer canonical form is related to the transformation that converts its dual system, `(Aᵀ, Cᵀ)`, to controller canonical form.\n\n2.  **Handle Multi-Output**: The given system has a multi-output matrix `C`. The standard canonical forms are defined for single-input/single-output (SISO) systems. We will select one row from `C` that makes the system observable. Let's choose the first row, `c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`, and verify that the pair `(A, c₁)` is observable. The result of the transformation will depend on this choice.\n\n3.  **Transform the Dual System**: We will form the dual SISO system `(A_d, B_d) = (Aᵀ, c₁ᵀ)`. We will then find the transformation matrix, let's call it `P`, that converts this dual system into controller canonical form.\n\n4.  **Find the Observer Transformation**: The transformation matrix `T` that converts the original system `(A, c₁)` into observer canonical form is given by the transpose of the inverse of `P`, i.e., `T = (P⁻¹)ᵀ`.\n\n5.  **Calculate New C Matrix**: Finally, we will apply this transformation `T` to the original multi-output matrix `C` to find the new matrix `C_o` in the observer canonical representation: `C_o = C * T`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `numpy` library.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef reduce_to_observer_canonical():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reduces a discrete-time system to observer canonical form using duality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the original system matrices\n    A = np.array([[1, 1, 0],\n                  [2, 1, 1],\n                  [0, 2, 0]])\n\n    C = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                  [1, 1, 0]])\n\n    n = A.shape[0]\n\n    # --- Step 2: Handle Multi-Output ---\n    # Select the first row of C to create a SISO system for the transformation\n    # We must ensure the pair (A, c1) is observable.\n    c1 = C[0, :]\n    observability_matrix_siso = np.vstack([c1 @ np.linalg.matrix_power(A, i) for i in range(n)])\n    if np.linalg.matrix_rank(observability_matrix_siso) < n:\n        print(\"The pair (A, c1) is not observable.
