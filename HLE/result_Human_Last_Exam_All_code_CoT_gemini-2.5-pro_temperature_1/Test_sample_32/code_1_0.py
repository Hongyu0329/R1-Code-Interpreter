    This function provides the value for the integral of the product of lambda classes
    lambda_3 * lambda_2 * lambda_1 on the moduli of stable curves of genus 3, M_bar_3.

    The computation of such Hodge integrals is a complex problem in algebraic geometry,
    whose solution relies on advanced mathematical theories (e.g., Faber-Zagier relations)
    that are not feasible to implement in a simple script.

    Therefore, this function returns the well-established value from mathematical literature.
    The integral evaluates to 1/8640.
