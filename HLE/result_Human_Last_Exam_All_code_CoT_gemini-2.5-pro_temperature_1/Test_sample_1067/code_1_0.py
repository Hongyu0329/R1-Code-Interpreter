# Define the propositions for clarity based on option C.
P = "The dog detects an intruder."
Q = "The dog barked."
R = "The dog was asleep."

# State the initial problem.
print("The core problem is a contradiction: We are given that the rule 'If P, then Q' exists,")
print("but we observe 'P is true' and 'Q is false'. We need a better rule.\n")

# Present the correct choice and its logic.
print("The correct answer is C, which resolves the contradiction by introducing a new condition, R.")
print("The propositions are defined as:")
print(f"P: {P}")
print(f"Q: {Q}")
print(f"R: {R}\n")

print("The logical form of argument C is: [(P ∧ ¬R)→Q] ∧ (¬Q ∧ P),∴R\n")

print("--- Logical Derivation ---")
print("1. The new rule is (P ∧ ¬R)→Q.")
print("   In English: 'If the dog detects an intruder AND is NOT asleep, THEN the dog will bark.'\n")

print("2. We are given the verifiable proof (¬Q ∧ P).")
print("   In English: 'The dog did not bark AND the dog detected an intruder.'\n")

print("3. From these premises, we deduce R:")
print("   - The main rule is an implication: (P ∧ ¬R) → Q.")
print("   - From the facts, we know the consequence of this rule, Q, is false (the dog did not bark).")
print("   - By the law of modus tollens, if the consequence is false, the antecedent must be false.")
print("   - Therefore, we can conclude that '(P ∧ ¬R)' must be false.\n")

print("4. Analyzing why '(P ∧ ¬R)' is false:")
print("   - We know from the facts that 'P' is true (the dog detected an intruder).")
print("   - For the full statement '(True ∧ ¬R)' to be false, the '¬R' part must be false.")
print("   - If '¬R' (The dog is NOT asleep) is false, then its opposite, 'R', must be true.\n")

print("5. Final Conclusion:")
print("   Therefore, R is true. The dog was asleep.")
print("   This explains the situation logically without contradicting any of the given evidence.\n")
