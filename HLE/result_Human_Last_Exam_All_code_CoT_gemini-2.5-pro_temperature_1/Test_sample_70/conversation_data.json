    "The task is to find all African national flags that have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark. The problem states we should assume the values assigned to colors are chosen to maximize the rank for each flag.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of Denmark's Flag:**\n    *   The Danish flag features a white Scandinavian cross on a red background.\n    *   When represented as a matrix, its geometric structure imposes constraints on the linear independence of its rows and columns, regardless of the specific numerical values chosen for the colors (as long as red != white).\n    *   Any row of the matrix will be one of two types: a row that is part of the horizontal white stripe (e.g., `[white, white, ..., white]`) or a row that is not (e.g., `[red, red, ..., white, ..., red, red]`).\n    *   These two types of rows are linearly independent. Since all other rows are just duplicates of one of these two types, the maximum number of linearly independent rows is 2.\n    *   Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify African Flags with a Maximal Rank of 2:**\n    *   I will look for African flags whose geometric design similarly limits the number of linearly independent rows or columns to exactly two. This includes:\n        *   **A-B-A Tribands:** Flags with three parallel stripes where the outer two are the same color (e.g., Green-White-Green). This pattern has only two distinct types of column vectors (one for color A, one for color B), resulting in a rank of 2.\n        *   **Field with a simple, single-color emblem:** A flag with a monochrome background and a simple, single-color emblem. This creates two types of row vectors: those that don't touch the emblem and those that do. This results in a rank of 2.\n        *   **Compound Bicolors:** Flags composed of a vertical band of one color and two horizontal bands of other colors (like the flags of Benin or Madagascar). This creates only two types of row vectors.\n\n3.  **Filter and Present the Results:**\n    *   I will systematically check the flags of all African nations against these rank-2 patterns.\n    *   Flags with plain horizontal/vertical tricolors (e.g., Gabon, Blue-Yellow-Green) will have a rank of 3.\n    *   Flags with complex patterns like triangles, diagonal stripes, or intricate emblems will have more than two linearly independent rows/columns and thus a rank greater than 2.\n    *   The final Python code will encapsulate this logic and print the names of the qualifying flags, along with their rank, to demonstrate the equality.\n\n```python\ndef solve_flag_rank_task():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies African national flags that have the same\n    linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, assuming maximal rank.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the rank of the flag of Denmark.\n    # The Danish flag has a Scandinavian cross structure.
