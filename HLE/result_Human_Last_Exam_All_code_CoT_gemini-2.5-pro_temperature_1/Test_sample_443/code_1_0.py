# The problem asks for the smallest possible value of k, where the number of unit balls
# needed to cover a specific subset of an algebraic surface is bounded by O(D^k),
# with D being the degree of the polynomial defining the surface.

# Let's outline the reasoning to find k.
#
# 1.  Deriving an upper bound for k:
#     The number of balls needed to cover a surface is proportional to the surface's area.
#     The surface in question, Z(P, T), is the part of the zero set of a polynomial P
#     of degree D inside a cylinder T, with an additional condition on its tangent plane.
#
#     a) Number of sheets: For any point (x, y) in the cylinder's base, the equation P(x, y, z) = 0
#        is a polynomial in z of degree at most D. This means it has at most D solutions for z.
#        Thus, the surface V(P) inside the cylinder consists of at most D "sheets".
#
#     b) Area of each sheet: The condition on the tangent plane's angle (> 1/10) ensures that
#        the surface is not too steep relative to the cylinder's axis. This mathematically
#        bounds the surface area element. The area of each sheet projected onto the cylinder's
#        base is therefore bounded by a constant multiple of the base's area. So, each sheet
#        has an area of O(1).
#
#     c) Total Area: The total area of Z(P, T) is the sum of the areas of these sheets, which is
#        at most D * O(1) = O(D).
#
#     d) Number of balls: The number of unit balls to cover a surface of area A is O(A). Thus,
#        the number of balls is O(D). Since this number is given as O(D^k), we must have k <= 1.
#
# 2.  Deriving a lower bound for k:
#     We can construct a polynomial of degree D that demonstrates the need for at least Omega(D) balls.
#     Consider a polynomial like P(x, y, z) = (product_{i=1 to D-1} (z - 3*i)) - x.
#     This surface has D-1 separate sheets inside the cylinder, located near z = 3, z = 6, z = 9, etc.
#     Since these sheets are separated by a distance of 3, which is greater than the diameter of a
#     unit ball (2), each sheet requires at least one unique ball to cover it.
#     Therefore, we need at least D-1 balls. This means the number of balls is Omega(D).
#     Since the number is O(D^k), this implies k >= 1.
#
# 3.  Conclusion:
#     The upper bound shows k <= 1 and the lower bound shows k >= 1.
#     Therefore, the smallest possible value for k is 1.

# The final equation is Number of Balls = O(D^k). Our analysis shows the tight bound is Theta(D^1).
# Thus, the smallest possible k is 1.
final_k = 1
