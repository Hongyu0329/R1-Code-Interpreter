    # Based on the geometric derivation, the problem simplifies to a constant ratio.
    # Let A_2n be the area of the original 2n-sided polygon.
    # Let A_n be the area of the new n-sided polygon.

    # The new polygon's area is the sum of the original polygon's area and the area
    # of 'n' new triangles formed at the corners (A_added).
    # A_n = A_2n + A_added

    # The key insight is that the area of the 'n' added triangles is exactly
    # half the area of the original 2n-sided polygon.
    # This is because the original polygon is composed of 2n fundamental triangles (from the center),
    # while the added area is composed of n triangles that are congruent to the fundamental ones.
    # So, A_added = (1/2) * A_2n.

    # Substitute this back into the equation for A_n:
    # A_n = A_2n + (1/2) * A_2n = (3/2) * A_2n

    # The question asks for the ratio A_n / A_2n.
    # Ratio = ((3/2) * A_2n) / A_2n = 3/2
