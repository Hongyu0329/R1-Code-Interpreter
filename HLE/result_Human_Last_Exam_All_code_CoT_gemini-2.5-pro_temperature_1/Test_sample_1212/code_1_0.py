def solve_go_puzzle():
    """
    This function analyzes the Go puzzle and identifies the killing moves for White.

    The board state is as follows:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

    The black group is connected and is the target. Its liberties are the empty
    adjacent points: A1, A3, A4, B1, and B2.

    To kill the group, White must prevent Black from forming two "eyes" (secure points of life).

    Analysis of White's potential first moves:

    1.  White at B2: This is a "throw-in" tesuji. White sacrifices a stone at the key internal
        point. Black is forced to capture it by playing at B1. After Black captures, Black
        has one solid eye at B2, but it's White's turn again. White can then proceed to
        remove all of the group's outside liberties (A1, A3, A4). The black group is
        left with only one eye and is captured. This is a killing move.

    2.  White at A1: This is a "hane" move. If White plays A1, Black's best response to
        make life is to play at B2. Then, White plays B1, putting the group in atari.
        Black must try to escape by playing at A3 or A4, but White can follow up and
        capture the entire group. This is a killing move.

    3.  White at B1: This move is symmetrical to playing at A1. The logic is identical.
        White plays B1, Black responds at B2, White follows up with A1, and the group
        is eventually captured. This is also a killing move.

    4.  White at A3 or A4: These moves are too slow. If White plays A3, Black plays the vital
        point at B2, securing one eye. Black then has enough space around A1 and B1 to
        create a second eye or enough liberties to live. These moves do not kill.

    Based on this analysis, the set of all moves that initiate a kill sequence is {A1, B1, B2}.
