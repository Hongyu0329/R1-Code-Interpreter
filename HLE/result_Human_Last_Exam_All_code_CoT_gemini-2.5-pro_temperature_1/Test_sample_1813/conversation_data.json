    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number \\(m_{4/7}\\):\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Relationship:** The continued fraction of a generalized Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is directly related to the continued fraction of the rational number \\(p/q\\) itself. There's a constructive formula to get from one to the other.\n2.  **Compute Continued Fraction of \\(p/q\\):** The first step is to find the coefficients of the continued fraction for the rational number \\(p/q = 4/7\\). This can be done using the Euclidean algorithm. Let the result be \\([a_0; a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n]\\).\n3.  **Construct the Markov Continued Fraction:** For a rational number \\(p/q = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]\\) between 0 and 1, the continued fraction for the associated Markov number \\(m_{p/q}\\) is given by the formula:\n    \\[ m_{p/q} = [0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_{n-1}, a_n-1, 1, a_{n-1}, \\dots, a_1}] \\]\n    This gives a purely periodic continued fraction with a palindromic-like structure.\n4.  **Apply to \\(4/7\\):**\n    *   Find the coefficients \\((a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n)\\) for \\(4/7\\).\n    *   Substitute these coefficients into the construction formula to get the sequence for the periodic part of \\(m_{4/7}\\).\n5.  **Code and Output:** I will write a Python script to perform these steps and print the resulting continued fraction, showing each number in the final representation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the computation:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the coefficients of the simple continued fraction of p/q.\n    Uses the Euclidean algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    if q == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero.\")\n    \n    # Ensure q is positive for consistent representation\n    if q < 0:\n        p, q = -p, -q\n        \n    coeffs = []\n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes and prints the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{4/7}.\n    \"\"\"\n    p, q = 4, 7\n\n    print(f\"Goal: Compute the continued fraction for the generalized Markov number m_{p}/{q}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Compute the continued fraction of p/q\n    cf_pq = get_continued_fraction_coeffs(p, q)\n    cf_pq_str = f\"[{cf_pq[0]}; \" + \", \".join(map(str, cf_pq[1:])) + \"]\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The continued fraction of {p}/{q} is {cf_pq_str}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Construct the periodic part for m_{p/q}\n    # The construction formula assumes 0 < p/q < 1, which means a_0 = 0.\n    # This is true for 4/7.\n    a0 = cf_pq[0]\n    a = cf_pq[1:] # This is the sequence [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\n    n = len(a)\n\n    if n == 0: # Integer case, not applicable here\n        periodic_part = []\n    elif n == 1: # e.g., for 1/3 = [0;3] -> a=[3]\n        periodic_part = [a[0] - 1, 1]\n    else: # General case for n > 1\n        first_part = a[:-1]\n        middle_part = [a[-1] - 1, 1]\n        last_part = list(reversed(first_part))\n        periodic_part = first_part + middle_part + last_part\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Construct the periodic part using the formula:\")\n    print(\"m_{p/q} = [a_0; overline(a_1, ..., a_{n-1}, a_n-1, 1, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1)]\")\n    print(f\"For {p}/{q}, the coefficients [a_1, ..., a_n] are {a}.\")\n    print(f\"The first part (a_1 to a_{n-1}) is {a[:-1]}.\")\n    print(f\"The middle part (a_n-1, 1) is [{a[-1]-1}, 1].\")\n    print(f\"The last part (reversed first part) is {list(reversed(a[:-1]))}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    # Step 3: Print the final result\n    print(\"Step 3: The resulting continued fraction is:\")\n    \n    # This loop prints each number as requested by the prompt.\n    print(f\"m_{p}/{q} = [{a0}; \", end=\"\")\n    \n    # Use \"overline\" for terminal display of periodic part\n    periodic_part_str = \", \".join(map(str, periodic_part))\n    print(f\"overline({periodic_part_str})]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<[0; 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]>>>"
