    "This is a classic riddle that relies on a phonetic pun. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Riddle:** The key elements are \"Russian translation,\" \"English poet,\" and \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" The combination of a different language (Russian) and an English phrase suggests that the solution is in the sound of the words.\n2.  **Identify the Pun:** The boulevards in Vienna are famously described as being \"wide.\" The English word \"wide\" is pronounced identically to the surname of a famous poet.\n3.  **Find the Poet:** The surname that sounds like \"wide\" is \"Wilde.\" This points to the renowned Irish poet and playwright Oscar Wilde, who is a major figure in English literature. A Russian speaker familiar with his work might easily make this pun when describing the boulevards.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that explains this logic. It will print the explanation and the final surname.\n5.  **Fulfill the \"Equation\" Requirement:** As requested, I will include a symbolic \"equation\" in the output that breaks down the surname into its constituent letters and their positions, thereby including numbers in an equation format.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying a phonetic pun.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The riddle's solution lies in the pun between the English word \"wide\"\n    # (describing Vienna's boulevards) and a poet's surname.\n    poet_surname = \"Wilde\"\n\n    print(\"The riddle is based on a phonetic pun.\")\n    print(\"The wide boulevards of Vienna are described by the English word 'wide'.\")\n    print(\"This word sounds identical to the surname of the famous poet, Oscar Wilde.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe surname is: {poet_surname}\")\n\n    # The prompt requests that the final code output each number in a final equation.\n    # We will create a symbolic equation by enumerating the letters of the surname.\n    print(\"\\n---\")\n    print(\"To fulfill the 'equation' requirement, here is a breakdown of the name:\")\n    \n    equation_parts = []\n    # Create a part of the equation for each letter, e.g., \"W(1)\", \"I(2)\", etc.\n    for i, char in enumerate(poet_surname):\n        # We use i + 1 because enumeration starts at 0.\n        num = i + 1\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{char}({num})\")\n    \n    # Join the parts with a '+' to form the equation string.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    # The result of the \"equation\" is the total number of letters.\n    result = len(poet_surname)\n    \n    # Print the final equation, which includes each number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {result} letters\")\n\n# Execute the function to solve the riddle.\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Wilde>>>"
