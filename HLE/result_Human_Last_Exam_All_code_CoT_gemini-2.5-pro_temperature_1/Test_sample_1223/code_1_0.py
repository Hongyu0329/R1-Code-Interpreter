    print("\n   Property A: Z is a compact metrizable space.")
    print("   - Since X is a metric space, the point x has a countable neighborhood basis. This implies that the space X \\ {x} has a countable base of neighborhoods for its 'point at infinity'.")
    print("   - A key theorem states the remainder of a locally compact space is metrizable if and only if the space has a countable base of neighborhoods of infinity.")
    print("   - Thus, Z is a compact metrizable space. It is also connected, making it a metric continuum.")

    print("\n   Property B: Z is an indecomposable continuum.")
    print("   - A theorem by R.F. Dickman Jr. states that Z is indecomposable if and only if x is not a cut point of any subcontinuum of X that contains it.")
    print("   - By definition, X is hereditary indecomposable, meaning every subcontinuum of X is indecomposable.")
    print("   - A fundamental property of indecomposable continua is that they have no cut points.")
    print("   - Therefore, x cannot be a cut point of any subcontinuum of X containing it.")
    print("   - This implies that the remainder Z is an indecomposable continuum.")

    print("\nStep 2: Determine the number of composants of Z.")
    print("   - We have established that Z is an indecomposable metric continuum.")
    print("   - A classical theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz states that any indecomposable metric continuum has either 1 composant (if it is a single point) or c composants (if it contains more than one point).")
    print("   - Here, 'c' stands for the cardinality of the continuum, the size of the set of real numbers.")
    print("   - So, the number of composants of Z must be either 1 or c.")

    print("\nStep 3: Find the maximum possible number.")
    print("   - The two possible values are 1 and c. The maximum would be c, provided this value is actually achievable.")
    print("   - We can show it is achievable by considering a famous example: the pseudo-arc (P).")
    print("   - The pseudo-arc is a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.")
    print("   - A non-trivial result in continuum theory shows that for any point x in the pseudo-arc P, the remainder β(P \\ {x}) \\ (P \\ {x}) is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc P itself.")
    print("   - Since the pseudo-arc is not a single point, it is a non-trivial indecomposable metric continuum. Therefore, it has c composants.")
    print("   - This demonstrates that the number of composants of the remainder can indeed be c.")
