    "This task requires stating the mathematical conditions for the existence of a tripled fixed point. This is a theoretical concept from a field of mathematics called Fixed-Point Theory, so the solution is not a script that calculates a value, but one that explains these conditions.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Acknowledge the theoretical nature:** State that the answer is a set of mathematical conditions, not a computational result.\n2.  **Clarify the setup:** Define the mathematical spaces (`complete metric spaces`) and the functions (`F`, `G`, `H`), correcting a likely typo in the prompt's function definitions to use the standard form from the relevant literature.\n3.  **State the main condition:** Explain the core requirement, which is a \"contractive mapping\" condition. This condition ensures that applying the functions brings any two points closer together, guaranteeing convergence to a single fixed point. I will present the three inequalities that define this condition.\n4.  **Define the tripled fixed point:** Show the set of equations that a point `(x, y, z)` must satisfy to be considered an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n5.  **Format the output:** The entire explanation will be printed by a single Python script, as requested. The final equations defining the fixed point will be provided in the special `<<<...>>>` format.\n\n```python\ndef explain_tripled_fixed_point_conditions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a detailed explanation of the conditions for the existence\n    of an FGH-tripled fixed point, based on generalizations of the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This task requires stating the mathematical conditions for the existence of a tripled fixed point.\")\n    print(\"This is a theoretical concept from a field of mathematics called Fixed-Point Theory.\")\n    print(\"The following presents these conditions and the resulting definition.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: Clarify the setup and definitions\n    print(\"1.
