    # Step 1: Clarify the setup and definitions
    print("1. The Mathematical Space\n")
    print("The conditions are defined on complete metric spaces. Let (X, d_X), (Y, d_Y), and (Z, d_Z) be three complete metric spaces.")
    print(" - A 'metric space' is a set where a 'distance' between any two elements is defined (e.g., the real numbers with the distance d(a,b) = |a-b|).")
    print(" - 'Complete' means that any sequence of points that get progressively closer to each other will converge to a point that is also within the space.\n")

    # Step 2: Define the functions
    print("2. The Functions (F, G, H)\n")
    print("We have three functions, F, G, and H. Based on the standard literature for tripled fixed points, we define their mappings as follows:")

    print("  H: Z * X * Y -> Z")
    print("(Note: The prompt contained a likely typo, listing the function 'G' twice. The above is the standard definition used in this context.)\n")

    # Step 3: State the core conditions
    print("3. The Contractive Conditions\n")
    print("The primary condition for a unique tripled fixed point to exist is that the functions must be contractive mappings. This means that when you apply the functions, the distance between the outputs is smaller than the distance between the inputs, scaled by some factor.")
    print("Specifically, there must exist three non-negative constants, k, l, and m, such that their sum is less than 1 (i.e., k + l + m < 1), and for any two sets of points (x, y, z) and (u, v, w) in the respective spaces, the following must hold:")
    
    print("\n  Inequality for F:")
    print("  d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) <= k * d_X(x, u) + l * d_Y(y, v) + m * d_Z(z, w)")

    print("  d_Y(G(y, z, x), G(v, w, u)) <= k * d_Y(y, v) + l * d_Z(z, w) + m * d_X(x, u)")

    print("  d_Z(H(z, x, y), H(w, u, v)) <= k * d_Z(z, w) + l * d_X(x, u) + m * d_Y(y, v)\n")

    print("Essentially, this set of inequalities ensures that if we repeatedly apply the functions F, G, and H, we will eventually converge to a single, unique triplet of points.\n")

    # Step 4: Define the result
    print("4. The FGH-Tripled Fixed Point\n")
    print("If the spaces are complete and the functions satisfy the contractive conditions above, then there exists a unique point (x, y, z) such that it is a fixed point of the system. This point is defined by satisfying the following three equations simultaneously:")
