    Explains why using highly flexible functions exacerbates model identifiability issues.
    """
    explanation = """
    The Problem: In phylogenetics, a birth-death model with time-varying speciation and extinction rates is non-identifiable from extant species data alone. This means many different rate functions can explain the data equally well.

    Why Strategy C is a Bad Idea: Fitting a model with high-degree polynomials (e.g., degree 5) introduces extreme flexibility. This does NOT help mitigate the problem; it makes it worse.

    1. Over-parameterization: A polynomial of degree 5 has 6 coefficients. Using 10 such pieces means a huge number of parameters, making the model very complex.

    2. Extreme Flexibility & Overfitting: As the plot generated by this script shows, high-degree polynomials can produce complex, 'wiggly' curves that can fit the noise in the data, not just the true signal.

    3. Exacerbating Non-Identifiability: This flexibility increases the size of the "congruence class" - the set of different speciation and extinction rate functions that produce the same likelihood. Instead of constraining the model to a plausible solution, this approach allows for an even wider range of unrealistic and unidentifiable solutions.

    Conclusion: Strategies that help with identifiability either add new information (like fossils or Bayesian priors) or simplify/regularize the model (like using piecewise-constant rates or reparameterizing to identifiable 'pulled rates'). Using highly flexible functions like high-degree polynomials is the opposite of regularization and makes the identifiability problem worse.
