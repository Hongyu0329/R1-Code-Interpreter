# This problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial objects on the standard
# triangulation of the Möbius band. This number can be determined using its
# topological properties, specifically its homology groups.

# The Möbius band is a non-orientable surface. For such spaces, homology with
# Z_2 coefficients is particularly important. A result in topological combinatorics
# relates the number of "spanning Z_2-acyclic subcomplexes" (a type of higher-
# dimensional forest) to the first homology group of the space.

# The number of such objects is given by the square of the order of the first
# homology group with Z_2 coefficients, |H_1(M, Z_2)|^2.

# For the Möbius band (M), the first homology group with Z_2 coefficients is
# the cyclic group of order 2.
# H_1(M, Z_2) is Z_2.
order_of_H1_M_Z2 = 2

# The number of forests is the square of this order.
exponent = 2
num_forests = order_of_H1_M_Z2 ** exponent

# The problem asks to output the final equation with each number.
