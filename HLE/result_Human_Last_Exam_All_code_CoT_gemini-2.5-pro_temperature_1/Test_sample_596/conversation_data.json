    "This problem asks for a number that is a topological invariant of the Möbius band, related to the combinatorial structure of its triangulation. The phrasing \"higher dimensional rooted forests\" and \"fail to simplicially collapse\" points towards concepts in algebraic and topological combinatorics.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will interpret the quantity \"higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to collapse\" as a specific class of subcomplexes whose count is given by a known formula from topological combinatorics. Given that the Möbius band is a non-orientable surface, its topological properties are often best captured using coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ (the integers modulo 2).\n2.  A theorem by Lyons provides a higher-dimensional analogue of the Matrix Tree Theorem. It states that the number of \"spanning $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-acyclic subcomplexes\" of a 2-dimensional complex $X$ is equal to $|H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}_2)|^2$. These subcomplexes are natural candidates for the \"forests\" in the problem. The failure to collapse can be interpreted as these specific objects being the obstructions, and their count being the answer.\n3.  The first homology group of the Möbius band ($M$) with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients is known to be the cyclic group of order 2, that is, $H_1(M, \\mathbb{Z}_2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n4.  Therefore, the number of these objects is $|\\mathbb{Z}_2|^2 = 2^2 = 4$.\n5.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# This problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial objects on the standard\n# triangulation of the Möbius band.
