    Analyzes a legal conflict of interest scenario and determines the correct outcome.
    """
    explanation = """
The core issue is the law firm's (NC LLP's) duty of confidentiality to its former client, Advanced Tech Inc.

1.  **Duty of Confidentiality:** A lawyer's duty to protect a client's confidential information is fundamental and continues even after the lawyer-client relationship has ended. NC LLP possesses highly sensitive information about Advanced Tech (financials, contracts, internal policies).

2.  **Conflict of Interest:** A conflict arises because NC LLP is now representing a new client (Six Wings Inc.) in a matter directly adverse to the interests of its former client (Advanced Tech Inc.). The confidential information the firm holds could be used to Advanced Tech's detriment in the acquisition negotiations, giving Six Wings an unfair advantage.

3.  **The Role of Consent:** In situations involving a conflict of interest with a former client, the firm can typically only proceed if it obtains informed consent from that former client. The scenario explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. refuses to provide this consent.

4.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   (A) is incorrect because the matters are related by the confidential information, which is the crucial test.
    *   (B) is incorrect because internal "information walls" are not sufficient to override the duty to a former client when that client explicitly refuses to consent to the representation.
    *   (C) is incorrect because the conflict applies to the entire firm, not just the partners. The reasoning is flawed.
    *   (E) is incorrect because it's too absolute; many conflicts can be resolved with consent.

5.  **Conclusion:** The correct answer is (D) because the existence of a conflict of interest, combined with the prejudiced party's refusal to consent, prohibits the law firm from continuing to act.
