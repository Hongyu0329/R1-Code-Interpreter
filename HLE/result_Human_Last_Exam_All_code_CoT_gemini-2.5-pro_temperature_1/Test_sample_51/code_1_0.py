    1.  The core of the problem is a non-standard subterm relation that allows any lambda expression to be considered a "subterm" of any other term. This breaks the well-foundedness required for structural recursion to guarantee termination.

    2.  This flaw allows the definition of non-terminating functions that are accepted as valid by the system's termination checker. For example, a function `f(x)` can recursively call `f(y)` where `y` is some lambda.

    3.  In dependent type theory, such a non-terminating function can be used to construct a proof of any proposition, including `False`, which makes the entire logical system inconsistent. The construction often looks like `omega : T -> False`, where `T` is an inhabited type.

    4.  A key step in constructing such a proof of `False` involves creating a type that refers to a large collection of other types, a feature known as impredicativity. In a standard predicative type theory, this is prevented by a strict hierarchy of universes (e.g., Type_0, Type_1, ...). A construction that might lead to a paradox is blocked because it would involve types from different, incompatible universe levels.

    5.  The axiom of Propositional Resizing directly attacks this safeguard. It allows propositions from higher universes to be treated as equivalent to propositions in lower universes. This collapses the hierarchy and introduces the strong impredicativity needed to make the paradoxical construction type-check.

    6.  By adding Propositional Resizing, one can define a non-terminating function that produces a term of type `False`, leveraging the faulty subterm rule, thus demonstrating the inconsistency of the system. The other axioms listed do not typically create this kind of foundational paradox based on non-termination and impredicativity.
