# The problem is to find the smallest integer dimension n for which a specific
# Fourier restriction inequality is known to fail.
# Based on the theory of the Fourier restriction conjecture:
# - For n = 2, the inequality is known to hold (a result by Bourgain).
# - For n >= 3, counterexamples exist, and it can be shown that these
#   counterexamples can be constructed within sets X satisfying the given
#   constraints.
# Therefore, the smallest possible dimension n is 3.

n = 3
