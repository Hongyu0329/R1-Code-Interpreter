    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem.\n\nFirst, I will address the main competitive programming task by providing a Python solution. The task is to compare two strings lexicographically while ignoring the case of the letters.\n1.  Read the two input strings provided by the user.\n2.  Since the comparison must be case-insensitive, I will convert both strings to a consistent case, for instance, lowercase, using the `.lower()` string method.\n3.  Then, I will perform a direct lexicographical comparison on the converted strings.\n4.  I will print \"-1\" if the first string is smaller, \"1\" if the second string is smaller, and \"0\" if they are identical, as per the problem's requirements.\n\nSecond, I will analyze the memory requirements for the most memory-efficient C program that solves the same problem, as requested by the task.\n1.  A C program must read the strings into memory to compare them. The most direct way is using character arrays. Given a maximum string length of 100, each array needs to be of size 101 to include the null terminator (`\\0`).\n2.  The memory for these two arrays will be `101 bytes` each, as `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte.\n3.  To perform the character-by-character comparison, a loop is needed, which requires an integer counter variable (e.g., `int i`). On most modern systems, an `int` takes up `4 bytes`.\n4.  To be most memory-efficient, no other variables are necessary. The case conversion and comparison can happen inside the loop's conditional statements without storing intermediate results.\n5.  Therefore, the total memory `m` is the sum of the sizes of the two character arrays and the integer loop counter: `m = 101 + 101 + 4 = 206` bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the string comparison problem:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Reads two strings, compares them lexicographically ignoring case,\n    and prints -1, 1, or 0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Read the first string from standard input and convert to lowercase.\n    s1 = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lower()\n\n    # Read the second string from standard input and convert to lowercase.\n    s2 = sys.stdin.readline().strip().lower()\n\n    # Perform the comparison.\n    if s1 < s2:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    elif s1 > s2:\n        print(\"1\")\n    else:\n        print(\"0\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<206>>>"
