    "The value you are referring to is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. This is the fundamental measurement used to calculate Heart Rate Variability (HRV). While it is measured from the peaks of the PPG signal, the standard term for it originates from Electrocardiography (ECG), where it is the time between two successive R-waves (the main peaks of a heartbeat). This term is the \"R-R interval\". A more general term, often used with PPG, is \"inter-beat interval\" (IBI). I will provide a python script that prints out the most common and standard term.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_interval_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the standard name for the interval between heartbeats used in HRV calculation.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis has a specific name.\n  # This value is the time duration between two consecutive heartbeats.\n  # In ECG, this is the time between two 'R' waves, the most prominent peaks.\n  # This term is widely adopted even when using other methods like PPG.\n  hrv_value_name = \"R-R interval\"\n\n  print(f\"The value computed between heartbeats to calculate HRV is called the: {hrv_value_name}\")\n\nget_hrv_interval_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
