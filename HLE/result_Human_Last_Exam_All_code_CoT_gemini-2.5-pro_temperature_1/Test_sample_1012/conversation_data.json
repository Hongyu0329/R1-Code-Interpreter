    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric encryption.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Threat**: The primary quantum attack against symmetric ciphers is Grover's algorithm.\n2.  **Understand the Impact**: Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for searching. For a key of length *N*, a classical computer needs approximately 2^N operations to brute-force it (giving it *N* bits of security). A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can do the same search in about sqrt(2^N) = 2^(N/2) operations. This effectively halves the security level of the key.\n3.  **Establish a Security Benchmark**: A security level of 128 bits is widely considered to be strong and sufficient for the foreseeable future against classical attacks. We want to maintain this same level of security against quantum attacks.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Key Length**: To achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer (which halves the effective key strength), the original key must be twice as long. Therefore, the required key length is 128 bits * 2 = 256 bits.\n5.  **Generate Code**: Create a Python script to demonstrate this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetric key length needed to resist a quantum attack.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A 128-bit security level is the standard benchmark for strong encryption.\n    # This means an attacker would need to perform 2^128 operations to break it.\n    desired_security_level = 128\n\n    # Grover's algorithm, a quantum attack, provides a quadratic speedup.\n    # This means it can break a key of length N in sqrt(2^N) or 2^(N/2) operations.\n    # To counteract this, the key length must be doubled to maintain the same security level.\n    quantum_threat_factor = 2\n\n    # Calculate the required key length.\n    required_key_length = desired_security_level * quantum_threat_factor\n\n    print(\"The standard for strong classical security is 128 bits.\")\n    print(\"A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm effectively halves the security bits of a symmetric key.\")\n    print(\"To maintain a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the key must be twice as long.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{required_key_length} (Required Key Length) = {desired_security_level} (Desired Security) * {quantum_threat_factor} (Quantum Factor)\")\n\ncalculate_post_quantum_key_length()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
