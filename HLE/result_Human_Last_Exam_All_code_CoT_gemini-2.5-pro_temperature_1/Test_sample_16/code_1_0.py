def get_minimum_prototypes():
    """
    This function explains and provides the minimum number of prototypes required.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of prototypes (M) to guarantee that a
    distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier can correctly classify each of the C
    class centroids.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The output of the kNN classifier for any point is a convex combination of the
       soft labels of its k-nearest prototypes.
    2. This means any possible output label must lie within the convex hull of the M
       prototype labels.
    3. To be able to classify a point as any of the C classes, the convex hull of
       the prototype labels must be able to "reach" the region of the label space
       corresponding to each of the C classes.
    4. If M < C, the M prototype labels span a space of dimension at most M-1. This
       (M-1)-dimensional convex hull is insufficient to cover all C possible class
       outcomes within the (C-1)-dimensional label space. For example, with C=3
       classes and M=2 prototypes, all outputs lie on a line, which cannot guarantee
       the ability to produce a result in all 3 class regions of the triangular label space.
    5. Therefore, at least C prototypes are required.
    6. To show that M=C is sufficient, one can place one prototype at each of the C
       class centroids and assign it a hard label for that class. This construction
       guarantees correct classification for all centroids.

    Thus, the minimum number of prototypes required is equal to the number of classes, C.
