    "Here is my plan to find the answer:\n\n1.  I will search for the specific quote attributed to Jorge Luis Borges: \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n2.  I will simultaneously search for which author Borges described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n3.  I will cross-reference the results to find the single novel and author that match both descriptions.\n4.  Once the novel and author are identified, I will write a Python script that stores this information in variables and prints it in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_borges_reference():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the novel and author\n    referenced by Jorge Luis Borges with the given descriptions.\n    \"\"\"\n    novel_title = \"Pedro Páramo\"\n    author_name = \"Juan Rulfo\"\n    quote = \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"\n    author_description = \"a continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner\"\n\n    print(f\"The novel Jorge Luis Borges refers to is '{novel_title}' by the author {author_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Borges praised the novel for having \\\"{quote}\\\" and described its author as {author_description}.\")\n\nfind_borges_reference()\n```\n<<<Pedro Páramo>>>"
