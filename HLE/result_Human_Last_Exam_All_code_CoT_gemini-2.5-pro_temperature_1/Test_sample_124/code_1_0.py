# This script identifies the correct statements about the junction tree algorithm.
# The analysis concluded that statements C, E, G, and I are correct.
# C: The junction tree uses the joint distributions within nodes. (True)
# E: High treewidth on a graph can cause the junction tree algorithm to become impractical. (True)
# G: A reason why the junction tree algorithm is not resilient to graphs with high treewidth is because the junction tree uses the joint distributions within nodes. (True)
# I: The computational efficiency of the junction tree algorithm will diminish exponentially as the number of discrete variables in the largest clique increases linearly. (True)
# The script will format these letters as a comma-separated list in brackets.

correct_statements = ['C', 'E', 'G', 'I']

# Create the final output string as per the specified format.
# Each letter from the list of correct statements is included.
output_string = "{" + ", ".join(correct_statements) + "}"

print(output_string)

# The final answer in the required format is derived from the output of this script.
# The script will print: {C, E, G, I}
# Adding the final answer tag as requested.
