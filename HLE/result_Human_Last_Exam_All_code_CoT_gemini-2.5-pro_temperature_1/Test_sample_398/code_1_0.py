    print("====================================================\n")

    # Step 1: Properties of the graph G
    print("Step 1: Understanding the graph G")
    print("The problem states that G is a 'maximal planar graph'. This has two important implications:")
    print("  1. Planar: G can be drawn on a plane with no edges crossing.")
    print("  2. Maximal: G is 'saturated'. If we add any new edge between two existing non-adjacent vertices, the graph will no longer be planar.")
    print("A consequence for any maximal planar graph with 3 or more vertices is that all of its faces in a planar drawing are triangles.\n")

    # Step 2: Properties of the graph G'
    print("Step 2: Understanding the graph G' = G U {e}")
    print("The graph G' is created by adding an edge 'e' that was not in G.")
    print("By the definition of G being *maximal* planar, adding this edge 'e' must make the graph non-planar.")
    print("This means G' cannot be drawn with zero crossings.")
    print("This fact immediately invalidates options A ('G' has a plane drawing') and D ('G' has a unique plane drawing').\n")

    # Step 3: The number of crossings in G'
    print("Step 3: Determining the number of crossings for G'")
    print("A fundamental theorem in topological graph theory states that if you add a single edge to a maximal planar graph, the resulting graph has a crossing number of exactly 1.")
    print("This means that G' can be drawn with a single crossing, and it's the minimum possible number of crossings.")
    print("So, the statement 'G' can be drawn with at most one crossing' is correct.")
    print("This finding invalidates option C ('G' may require more than one crossing').\n")

    # Step 4: Uniqueness of the one-crossing drawing
    print("Step 4: Analyzing the uniqueness of the drawing")
    print("We are left to choose between option B and option E.")
    print("  - B: The one-crossing drawing is not unique.")
    print("  - E: The one-crossing drawing is unique.")
    print("\nA drawing with one crossing is created by choosing an edge from G, let's call it e', to be crossed by the new edge e.")
    print("For the drawing to be 'unique', every possible choice for the crossed edge e' must result in a structurally identical drawing (i.e., the drawings are topologically equivalent or isomorphic).")
    print("While this might be true for some highly symmetric graphs (like an octahedron), it is not true for all maximal planar graphs.")
    print("In a general, less symmetric maximal planar graph, there will be multiple edges that are not structurally equivalent. For example, we can choose to cross edge e1' to get one drawing, or cross a different, non-symmetric edge e2' to get another drawing.")
    print("Since these two drawings involve different, non-equivalent pairs of crossing edges, the resulting drawings are not unique.\n")

    # Step 5: Conclusion
    print("Step 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("Based on the analysis:")
    print("  - G' can be drawn with at most one crossing (specifically, exactly one).")
    print("  - The drawing is generally not unique because there can be multiple non-equivalent choices for which edge of G is crossed.")
    print("\nTherefore, the correct statement is that G' can be drawn with at most one crossing, but this drawing is not unique.")
