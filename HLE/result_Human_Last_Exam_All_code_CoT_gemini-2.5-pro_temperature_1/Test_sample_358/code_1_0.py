# This script calculates the sum of all entries in the Cartan matrix
# for the principal block of the group algebra k[A_5 x C_2] with char(k)=2.

# --- Step 1: Cartan matrix for the principal block of k[C_2] at p=2 ---
# The group algebra k[C_2] for a field k of characteristic 2 is isomorphic to k[x]/(x^2).
# This algebra is local and indecomposable, so it has only one block (the principal one).
# There is one simple module L (the trivial module, dim=1).
# The projective cover P of L is the algebra k[C_2] itself (dim=2).
# The module P has a composition series with L appearing twice.
# Therefore, the Cartan matrix is a 1x1 matrix with the entry [2].

# --- Step 2: Cartan matrix for the principal block of k[A_5] at p=2 ---
# For the group A_5 and p=2, the structure of the principal block is a well-known
# result in modular representation theory. The block has two simple modules.
# The corresponding Cartan matrix is a 2x2 matrix.

# --- Step 3: Cartan matrix for the principal block of k[A_5 x C_2] ---
# The Cartan matrix of the principal block of the direct product G = A_5 x C_2
# is the Kronecker product of the individual Cartan matrices.

# --- Step 4: Sum of all entries ---
# We calculate the sum of all entries in the resulting Cartan matrix C_G.
