    "This is a literary history question. The story of \"Sir Launfal\" you're asking about is the 15th-century Middle English romance by Thomas Chestre, not the more modern poem by James Russell Lowell. The original romance is preserved in a single manuscript which is an anthology of different texts.\n\nMy plan is to write a Python script that will:\n1.  Identify the specific book of manners.\n2.  Print an explanation of the context.\n3.  State the name of the book.\n\n```python\ndef find_book_of_manners():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the user's literary history question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The story of 'Sir Launfal' by Thomas Chestre is found in the 15th-century\n    # manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n    # This manuscript contains several works, including a treatise on etiquette.\n    book_of_manners = \"The Boke of Curtasye\"\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"The 15th-century Middle English romance 'Sir Launfal' is preserved in a single manuscript \"\n        \"called Cotton Caligula A.ii. This manuscript is an anthology containing various texts, \"\n        \"and alongside 'Sir Launfal,' it includes a book of manners on the subject of etiquette.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    print(\"\\nThe book of manners it was preserved alongside is:\")\n    print(f\"'{book_of_manners}' (The Book of Courtesy).\")\n\nfind_book_of_manners()\n```\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
