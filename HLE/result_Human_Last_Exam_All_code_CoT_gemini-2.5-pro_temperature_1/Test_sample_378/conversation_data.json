    "Based on my research, the premise of your question appears to be incorrect. The former President of Nigeria's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. There is no public record of him ever using or identifying with the name \"Azikiwe\".\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not happen.\n\nI will provide a Python script that clarifies this information as requested.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_history():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the user's query about when Goodluck Jonathan\n    publicly identified as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    full_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n\n    # Based on extensive public records, \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name.\n    # Therefore, we print an explanatory statement.\n    \n    print(f\"The full name of the former president is {full_name}.\")\n    print(f\"There is no public record of him ever identifying with the name '{name_in_question}'.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: A year cannot be provided for an event that has not been recorded to have occurred.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the findings.\ncheck_name_history()\n```\n<<<There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself as Azikiwe.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
