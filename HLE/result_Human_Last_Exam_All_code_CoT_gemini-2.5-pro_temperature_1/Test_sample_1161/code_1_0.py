    # Our test point Q will be in the blind_spot_direction: Q = c * blind_spot_direction.
    # The condition becomes c * (blind_spot_direction . P) >= 1.
    # For Q to be unseen, we need c * (blind_spot_direction . P) < 1 for ALL guards P.

    # This means any point Q with distance c < 1 / cos(pi/n) is unseen.
    # Since n is finite, cos(pi/n) < 1, so 1/cos(pi/n) > 1.
    # This proves there is always a region of unseen points outside the circle.
