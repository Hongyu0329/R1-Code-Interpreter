The problem asks for the minimum number of operations (n) needed to transform any 100-digit binary sequence into any other. This is the maximum of the minimum costs over all possible pairs of sequences.

The key is to find the most 'different' pair of sequences. The number of blocks of consecutive digits is a measure of sequence complexity. A monolithic sequence like '00...0' (1 block) is simple, while an alternating sequence like '0101...' (100 blocks) is complex. The hardest transformation is between these two types.

Let's calculate the cost for the worst-case pair:
- Initial sequence S: '00...0' (100 zeros)
- Target sequence T: '1010...10' (100 digits, starting with 1)

The transformation from S to T can be done in three stages:

1.  S is all '0's, but T starts with a '1'. We must insert a '1' at the beginning. This takes 1 operation.
    Sequence becomes: '1' followed by 100 '0's.

2.  The sequence is now '10...' followed by 99 '0's. The target is '1010...10'. We need to insert 49 more '1's to create the alternating pattern. Each insertion splits the block of '0's and creates a new '1' block and a new '0' block. This requires 49 operations.
    After this, the sequence is '1010...10' followed by a tail of unused '0's.

3.  The final step is to remove the trailing block of '0's. This takes 1 operation.

The total number of operations is the sum from these stages.
