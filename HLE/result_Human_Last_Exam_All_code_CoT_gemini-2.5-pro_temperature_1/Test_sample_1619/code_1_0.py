    # --- Setup of the Quantum Experiment (Theoretical) ---
    # We choose specific measurement angles for two detectors, Alice (a, a') and Bob (b, b'),
    # that are known to maximally violate the classical inequality.
    # Alice's angles: a = 0°, a' = 90°
    # Bob's angles:   b = 45°, b' = 135°

    # In quantum mechanics, the expectation value (correlation) for entangled particles
    # is given by E(angle_a, angle_b) = -cos(angle_b - angle_a).
    
    # --- Calculations ---

    # The CHSH value 'S' is calculated from these correlations
