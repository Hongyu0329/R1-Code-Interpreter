    print("- The patient suffers from severe insomnia and anxiety, and feels their current complex medication regimen (polypharmacy) is not working.")
    print("- Key takeaway: The heavy cannabis use is a major confounding variable that can worsen anxiety and insomnia, and interfere with the effectiveness of his psychiatric medications.")
    print("\nStep 2: Evaluating each treatment option.")
    print("I. Counsel patient on stopping cannabis: HIGH PRIORITY. This is crucial as cannabis use is likely exacerbating his symptoms and rendering his medications ineffective.")
    print("II. Ask patient to request admission for med detox: LOW PRIORITY. This is a drastic, potentially destabilizing step. Medication changes should be made gradually on an outpatient basis first.")
    print("III. Order a urine drug test: HIGH PRIORITY. This provides essential objective data to confirm substance use, screen for other undisclosed substances (important given his history and request for stimulants), and guide a risk/benefit discussion.")
    print("IV. Prescribe melatonin for insomnia: HIGH PRIORITY. This is a safe, low-risk, non-addictive intervention that directly addresses one of the patient's main complaints (insomnia) while the more complex issues are being addressed.")
    print("V. Discontinue acamprosate and increase naltrexone: LOW PRIORITY. There is no indication to change treatment for his Alcohol Use Disorder, which is in remission. The focus should be on active problems.")
    print("VI. Start atomoxetine: INVALID. The case notes state the patient is already taking atomoxetine 80 mg qD.")

    print("\nStep 3: Selecting the top three priorities.")
