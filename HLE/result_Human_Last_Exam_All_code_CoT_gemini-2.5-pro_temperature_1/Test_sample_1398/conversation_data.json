    "I have analyzed the input and output grids and found a consistent transformation rule. The rule for determining the value of a cell in the output grid is based on its corresponding cell and its eight neighbors (the Moore neighborhood) in the input grid.\n\nThe rule is as follows:\nFor each cell, sum the values (0 or 1) of the 9 cells in its 3x3 neighborhood in the input grid (the cell itself and its eight neighbors). The value of the cell in the output grid will be 1 if this sum is odd, and 0 if this sum is even. In other words, the output value is the sum modulo 2. For cells on the edges or corners, any neighbor that falls outside the grid is treated as having a value of 0.\n\nI will now apply this rule to the test input grid.\n\n1.  Define the input grid.\n2.  Create a new empty grid for the output of the same dimensions.\n3.  Iterate through each cell `(r, c)` of the input grid.\n4.  For each cell, calculate the sum of the values in the 3x3 Moore neighborhood centered at `(r, c)`. Handle boundary conditions by treating out-of-bounds neighbors as 0.\n5.  Calculate the new value for the output cell `O[r][c]` as `sum % 2`.\n6.  Print the resulting output grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    The new value of a cell is the sum of its 3x3 Moore neighborhood modulo 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    # Pad the grid with 0s to handle boundaries easily\n    padded_grid = np.pad(grid, pad_width=1, mode='constant', constant_values=0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            # The 3x3 neighborhood in the padded grid corresponds to the\n            # original cell's neighborhood.\n            # The top-left corner of the subgrid is at (r, c) in the padded grid.\n            neighborhood_sum = np.sum(padded_grid[r:r+3, c:c+3])\n            output_grid[r, c] = neighborhood_sum % 2\n    \n    # Print the resulting grid as a flat string\n    result_string = \"\".join(map(str, output_grid.flatten()))\n    print(result_string)\n\n# Test Input Grid 6\ninput_grid_6 = np.array([\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n])\n\nsolve(input_grid_6)\n```\n<<<1101111111010100100010001>>>"
