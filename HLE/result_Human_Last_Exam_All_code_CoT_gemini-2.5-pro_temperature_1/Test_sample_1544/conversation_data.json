    "This is a complex chess puzzle that requires a deep tactical calculation. At first glance, White's position seems dire as the queen on f2 is attacked. Obvious moves, such as trading queens with `Qxc5+`, lead to a losing king and pawn endgame for White.\n\nHowever, White can force a win with a brilliant series of moves. The plan is to use the exposed position of the Black king and the power of the passed d-pawn to create unstoppable threats. The key is to find the correct initiating move that sets up a decisive tactical sequence.\n\nThe following Python script will guide you through the winning combination step-by-step. It uses the `python-chess` library to represent the board and validate the moves. You will need to install it first if you don't have it (`pip install python-chess`). The script will print the moves and an explanation for each step of the solution.\n\n```python\nimport chess\n\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the FEN \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n    and demonstrates the winning sequence for White.\n    This function prints the analysis and the step-by-step moves.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # FEN of the position\n        fen = \"8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1\"\n        board = chess.Board(fen)\n\n        print(\"--- Chess Position Analysis ---\")\n        print(f\"FEN: {fen}\")\n        print(\"Initial Board:\")\n        print(board)\n        print(\"\\nWhite is to move.
