    "This is a question from a field of mathematics called topology, specifically continuum theory. The answer is a specific number that can be deduced from the definitions and key theorems. I will provide a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the key terms: continuum, indecomposable continuum, and composant.\n2.  State the crucial properties of composants in an indecomposable continuum.\n    *   Property A: The composants of a continuum form a partition of the space (they are disjoint and their union is the whole space).\n    *   Property B: A key theorem states that in an indecomposable continuum, every composant is a *proper* subset of the continuum.\n3.  Use these properties to deduce the lower bound for the number of composants.\n    *   From Property A, there must be at least one composant.\n    *   From Property B, this single composant cannot be the entire space. Therefore, there must be at least one more composant to cover the remaining points. This establishes the minimum number as 2.\n4.  Mention the existence theorem, which confirms that for any cardinal number `c >= 2`, an indecomposable continuum with `c` composants exists. This proves that the lower bound of 2 is achievable.\n5.  The Python code will print this explanation and the resulting number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the smallest number of composants\n    an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the terms from continuum theory.\n    print(\"Step 1: Understanding the definitions.\")\n    print(\" - A 'continuum' is a compact, connected Hausdorff space.\")\n    print(\" - An 'indecomposable continuum' is a continuum that cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\")\n    print(\" - A 'composant' of a point p is the set of all points that can be connected to p by a proper subcontinuum.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: State the key theorems.\n    print(\"Step 2: Applying key theorems about indecomposable continua.\")\n    print(\" - Theorem 1: The composants of a continuum form a partition.
