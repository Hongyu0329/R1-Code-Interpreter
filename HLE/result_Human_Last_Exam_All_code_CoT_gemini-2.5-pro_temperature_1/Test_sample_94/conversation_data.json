    "Here is my plan to answer your question.\n1.  I will analyze the clues provided in your question: a physicist known for microscopy, an optical effect, and a discovery spurred by a custodian cleaning concave mirrors.\n2.  Based on these clues, I will identify the specific historical event and the physicist associated with it. The story is a well-known anecdote in the field of X-ray optics.\n3.  The physicist is Paul Kirkpatrick, who, along with Albert Baez, developed the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system for focusing X-rays. The story goes that Kirkpatrick got the idea after a janitor noted how a long, cylindrical mirror (like a funhouse mirror) focused light into a line.\n4.  I will then create a simple Python script to print the name of this physicist, as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script stores the name of the physicist in a variable and prints it.\n# The physicist is Paul Kirkpatrick, known for his work in X-ray microscopy.\n# He developed the Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror system after being inspired by\n# an observation made by a custodial worker cleaning a cylindrical concave mirror.\n\nphysicist_name = \"Paul Kirkpatrick\"\nprint(physicist_name)\n```\n<<<Paul Kirkpatrick>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which physicist better known for work in the microscopy field discovered an optical effect in real imagery after it was accidentally observed by a custodial worker cleaning concave mirrors?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
