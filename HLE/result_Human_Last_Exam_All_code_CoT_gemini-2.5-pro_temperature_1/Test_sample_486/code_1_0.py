    This function provides a step-by-step solution to the problem

    # Step 1: State the interpretation of the problem.
    # The problem is to find the maximum possible growth exponent 'p' of the energy integral
    # E(R) = integral_{B_R} |nabla u|^2, where the maximum is taken over all non-constant
    # solutions u with |u|<1. The largest possible 'a' is this maximum exponent.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the one-dimensional solution to establish a lower bound.
    # Consider the solution u(x,y,z) = tanh(x / sqrt(2)).
    # Its gradient is nabla_u = ( (1/sqrt(2)) * sech^2(x/sqrt(2)), 0, 0 ).
    # The squared magnitude of the gradient is |nabla u|^2 = (1/2) * sech^4(x/sqrt(2)).
    
    x = sp.symbols('x', real=True)
    nabla_u_sq = sp.Rational(1, 2) * (sp.sech(x / sp.sqrt(2)))**4

    # Step 3: Calculate the asymptotic growth of the energy integral E(R).
    # E(R) = integral_{B_R} |nabla u|^2 dV.
    # Using the method of disks, we integrate over y and z first, which yields a factor of pi*(R^2-x^2).
    # E(R) = integral_{-R to R} |nabla u(x)|^2 * pi * (R^2 - x^2) dx.
    # For large R, this integral behaves like C * R^2, where C is a constant.
    # C = integral_{-oo to oo} pi * |nabla u|^2 dx.
    
    C = sp.integrate(sp.pi * nabla_u_sq, (x, -sp.oo, sp.oo))

    # The growth exponent 'p' for this 1D solution is 2.
    p_1D = 2

    # Step 4: Conclude the final answer.
    # For the 1D solution, the energy grows like R^2, so a<=2. This means the
    # largest possible 'a' is at least 2.
    # For any solution, the energy is concentrated on a 2D interface. The area of this
    # interface inside a ball of radius R is expected to scale at most as R^2.
    # Therefore, the growth exponent cannot exceed 2.
    # Combining these, the maximum possible growth exponent is 2.
