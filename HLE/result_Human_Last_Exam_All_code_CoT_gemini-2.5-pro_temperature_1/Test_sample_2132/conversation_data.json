    "To solve this problem, we first need to identify the product of the specified chemical reaction. Then, we will calculate its Böttcher Molecular Complexity.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:** The reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone. This is a well-known reaction where an α-halo ketone reacts with a base, leading to a ring-contracted carboxylic acid (after an acidic workup).\n2.  **Determine the Product:** The 6-membered ring of 2-chlorocyclohexanone will contract to a 5-membered ring. The final product is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Analyze the Product Molecule (Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid):**\n    *   Chemical Formula: C₆H₁₀O₂\n    *   We need to determine the number of atoms (`N_atoms`), the number of bonds (`N_bonds`), and the number of parts (`N_parts`) for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula: `MC = (N_atoms * N_bonds) / N_parts`.\n4.  **Count the Atoms (`N_atoms`):**\n    *   Carbon (C): 6\n    *   Hydrogen (H): 10\n    *   Oxygen (O): 2\n    *   Total atoms = 6 + 10 + 2 = 18.\n5.  **Count the Bonds (`N_bonds`):**\n    *   `N_bonds` in the Böttcher formula is the sum of all bond orders (e.g., a single bond is 1, a double bond is 2).\n    *   The structure contains a C₅H₉ ring attached to a -COOH group.\n    *   Bonds include: C-C single bonds (6), C-H single bonds (9), a C=O double bond (counts as 2), a C-O single bond (1), and an O-H single bond (1).\n    *   Total `N_bonds` = 6 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 19.\n6.  **Determine the Number of Parts (`N_parts`):**\n    *   Since cyclopentanecarboxylic acid is a single, continuous molecule, `N_parts` = 1.\n7.  **Calculate the Complexity:**\n    *   `MC = (18 * 19) / 1 = 342`.\n8.  **Construct the Python Code:** The code will perform these calculations and print the final equation and result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottcher_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Böttcher Molecular Complexity for the product of the\n    Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the product of the reaction.\n    # The Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone results in the\n    # ring-contracted product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2).\n    product_name = \"cyclopentanecarboxylic acid\"\n    product_formula = \"C6H10O2\"\n\n    print(f\"The reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone.\")\n    print(f\"The product of this reaction is {product_name}, with the formula {product_formula}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the components for the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula.\n    # Formula: MC = (N_atoms * N_bonds) / N_parts\n\n    # N_atoms: Total number of atoms in the molecule.\n    # C=6, H=10, O=2\n    n_atoms = 6 + 10 + 2\n\n    # N_bonds: Sum of bond orders in the molecule.\n    # Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid has:\n    # - 6 C-C single bonds\n    # - 9 C-H single bonds\n    # - 1 C=O double bond (bond order = 2)\n    # - 1 C-O single bond\n    # - 1 O-H single bond\n    # Total = 6 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 19\n    n_bonds = 19\n\n    # N_parts: Number of disconnected parts of the molecule.
