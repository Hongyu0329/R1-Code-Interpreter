    Computes the stable commutator length based on the provided rotation numbers.

    The plan is as follows:
    1. Define the rotation numbers for the elements g and h.
    2. Calculate the ratio of these rotation numbers.
    3. The group's structure (slopes are powers of 2) suggests a base-2 logarithm is relevant.
       Calculate the base-2 logarithm of the ratio. This value represents the "scaling exponent"
       that relates the two elements in the natural context of the group.
    4. The stable commutator length is hypothesized to be half of this scaling exponent,
       following common patterns in scl formulas.
    5. Print the final equation with all the numbers.
