    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing**\nTrisyllabic laxing (or shortening) is a sound rule in English where a long vowel becomes short if it is in the antepenultimate syllable—that is, the third syllable from the end of a word. For this rule to apply, the word must have at least three syllables.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each word based on the rule.**\n\n*   **southern**: This word has two syllables (`south-ern`). The rule requires three syllables, so it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   **derivative**: This word has four syllables (`de-riv-a-tive`). It comes from the base word `derive`, which has a long 'i' sound (/aɪ/). In `derivative`, this vowel shortens to a short 'i' sound (/ɪ/). This is a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **serenity**: This word has four syllables (`se-ren-i-ty`). It comes from the base word `serene`, which has a long 'e' sound (/iː/). In `serenity`, this vowel shortens to a short 'e' sound (/ɛ/). This is also a classic example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **pleasant**: This word has two syllables (`pleas-ant`). The rule requires three syllables, so it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n*   **gratitude**: This word has three syllables (`grat-i-tude`). The first syllable is the third from the end. Its vowel sound /æ/ is the laxed (short) version of the long vowel found in its Latin root (`grātus`) and related English words like `grateful` (/eɪ/). This is another example of trisyllabic laxing.\n*   **shadow**: This word has two syllables (`shad-ow`). The rule requires three syllables, so it cannot have undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the words that did not undergo the process.**\nThe words `southern`, `pleasant`, and `shadow` all fail the first condition because they are not three syllables long. However, `southern` (from `south`) and `pleasant` (from `please`) do show a pattern of vowel shortening, even if it's not the trisyllabic rule.\n\n`shadow` is the most definitive answer. Not only is it a two-syllable word, but its first vowel was historically short (from Old English *sceadu*). Since the vowel was never long to begin with, it could not have undergone any shortening or \"laxing\" process.\n\nThe following Python code will print this analysis for each word.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n    \"\"\"\n    words_analysis = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"base_word\": \"south\",\n            \"laxing_applies\": \"No\",\n            \"reason\": \"The word has only two syllables.
