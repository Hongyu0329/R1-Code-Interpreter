    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. The general form for a semidihedral group is $SD_{2^n}$. By setting $2^n = 512$, we can find the value of $n$.\n2.  **Determine n:** We solve the equation $2^n = 512$. Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives $n = \\log_2(512) = 9$. So, we are dealing with the group $SD_{2^9}$.\n3.  **Use the Known Theorem:** For semidihedral groups $SD_{2^n}$ where $n \\ge 4$, there is a known result for the number of its distinct power subgroups. A power subgroup is a subgroup of the form $G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. The set of all distinct power subgroups for $SD_{2^n}$ consists of:\n    *   The group $G$ itself.\n    *   The $n-1$ cyclic subgroups of the form $\\langle r^{2^i} \\rangle$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1$.\n4.  **Count the Subgroups:** The total number of distinct power subgroups is the sum of the counts from the previous step: 1 (for the group $G$) + ($n-1$) (for the cyclic subgroups). This gives a total of $1 + (n-1) = n$.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Since we found that $n=9$ for the group $SD_{512}$, the number of power subgroups is 9.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # 1. Identify the parameter 'n' for the semidihedral group SD_{2^n}.\n    # The size of the group is 2^n, so n = log2(group_size).\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # The formula for the number of power subgroups of SD_{2^n} is n, for n >= 4.\n    if n < 4:\n        print(f\"The formula for the number of power subgroups applies for n >= 4, but n = {n}.\")\n        # For n=3, SD_8 is ismorphic to Q_8, which has 4 power subgroups.\n        # This case is not requested, but good to be aware of.\n        # We proceed as the problem implies a standard case.\n        return\n        \n    num_power_subgroups = n\n    \n    # 2. Explain the result.\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{{{group_size}}}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to the general form SD_{{2^n}}, where 2^n = {group_size}.\")\n    print(f\"Solving for n, we get n = log2({group_size}) = {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to group theory, the number of distinct power subgroups in SD_{2^n} (for n >= 4) is exactly n.\")\n    print(\"These subgroups are the group itself and n-1 distinct cyclic subgroups.\")\n    \n    # 3. Show the final calculation.\n    num_cyclic_subgroups = n - 1\n    num_non_cyclic_subgroups = 1\n    print(f\"\\nThe total number of power subgroups is the sum of:\")\n    print(f\"  - The group itself: {num_non_cyclic_subgroups}\")\n    print(f\"  - The number of distinct cyclic power subgroups: {num_cyclic_subgroups}\")\n    print(f\"\\nFinal calculation: {num_non_cyclic_subgroups} + {num_cyclic_subgroups} = {num_power_subgroups}\")\n    \nsolve_power_subgroups()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
