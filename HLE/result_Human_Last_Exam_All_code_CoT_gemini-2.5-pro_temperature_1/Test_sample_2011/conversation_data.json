    "Based on one interpretation of the problem, we are looking for the maximum number of maximal cliques of different sizes that can exist in a graph with 128 vertices. This can be modeled by constructing a graph as a disjoint union of cliques of different sizes. To maximize the number of such cliques, we should use the smallest possible distinct clique sizes.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Let the number of different clique sizes be `m`.\n2.  To maximize `m`, we should choose the smallest distinct positive integers for the clique sizes: `1, 2, 3, ..., m`.\n3.  The total number of vertices required to form these cliques as disjoint components is the sum `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + m`.\n4.  This sum must be less than or equal to the total number of vertices available, which is `n = 128`.\n5.  The sum of the first `m` integers is given by the formula `m * (m + 1) / 2`.\n6.  We will solve the inequality `m * (m + 1) / 2 <= 128` to find the maximum possible integer value for `m`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and shows the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_max_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can\n    simultaneously appear as disjoint induced subgraphs in a graph on n vertices.\n    This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of maximal cliques of\n    distinct sizes.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 128\n\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the maximum number of different clique sizes in a graph with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"Under the interpretation that we are creating disjoint cliques of distinct sizes, we need to find the largest 'm' such that the sum of the first 'm' integers is at most n.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe equation to solve is:\")\n    print(f\"1 + 2 + ... + m <= {n}\")\n    print(\"Using the formula for the sum of the first 'm' integers, we get:\")\n    print(f\"m * (m + 1) / 2 <= {n}\")\n    \n    # We can multiply by 2 to simplify the inequality for integer calculations.\n    rhs = 2 * n\n    print(f\"m * (m + 1) <= {rhs}\")\n    print(\"\\nWe need to find the largest integer m that satisfies this inequality.\")\n\n    # We can solve for m by finding the root of m^2 + m - rhs = 0\n    # m = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 4*rhs)) / 2\n    m_float = (-1 + math.sqrt(1 + 4 * rhs)) / 2\n    max_m = math.floor(m_float)\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet's verify the result:\")\n    m_test_ok = max_m\n    val_ok = m_test_ok * (m_test_ok + 1)\n    print(f\"For m = {m_test_ok}: {m_test_ok} * ({m_test_ok} + 1) = {val_ok}.
