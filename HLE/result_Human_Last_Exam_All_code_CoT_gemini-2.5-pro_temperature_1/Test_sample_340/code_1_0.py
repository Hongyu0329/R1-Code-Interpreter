    This function determines the minimal number of moves for White to win
    a game of Three-check chess from the given FEN.

    The analysis reveals a forced sequence of moves for White that guarantees
    delivering three checks regardless of Black's optimal responses.

    The winning sequence of White's moves is:
    1. O-O-O
    2. Bxd7+ (Check 1)
    3. Bxf6
    4. Rxd7
    5. Rd1+  (Check 2)
    6. Qd5+  (Check 3)

    This sequence consists of 6 moves by White.
