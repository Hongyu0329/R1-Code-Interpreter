    Solves the theoretical questions about hyperbolic groups.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    The key to answering all three questions is to consider that hyperbolic groups can contain torsion elements (elements of finite order). Formal language properties like 'rational' or 'context-free' are general enough to include finite sets.

    A. Must every geodesic word representing an element in alpha(K) be fully quasireduced if K is rational?
    Answer: No.
    A fully quasireduced word must be a quasigeodesic. A word representing a torsion element is not a quasigeodesic. We can choose a hyperbolic group G with a torsion element t, and let K = {t}. K is finite, hence rational. alpha(K) contains t, and any geodesic word for t is not fully quasireduced.

    B. Is there a finite bound for epsilon such that a fully (1, epsilon)-quasireduced word in alpha(K) exists for a rational K?
    Answer: No.
    A fully quasireduced word must represent an element of infinite order. Consider G = Z_2 * Z_2 and K = {a}, where a is a generator of order 2. K is rational. alpha(K) consists entirely of elements of order 2. No element in alpha(K) can be represented by a quasigeodesic word, so no such word exists for this K, which means a universal bound cannot exist.

    C. Is it true that alpha(K) contains only quasigeodesic words if K is context-free?
    Answer: No.
    This is interpreted as "does every element in alpha(K) have a quasigeodesic representative word (i.e., is of infinite order)?". The counterexample from A applies here as well. A finite set K={t} is context-free. alpha(K) contains the torsion element t, which does not have a quasigeodesic representative.
