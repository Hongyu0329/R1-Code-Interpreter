# In triangle ABC, the side lengths opposite to vertices A, B, and C
# are denoted by a, b, and c, respectively.

# The side lengths are represented symbolically.
side_a = 'a'
side_b = 'b'
side_c = 'c'

# Based on the geometric proof using the Incenter-Excenter Lemma and Ptolemy's Theorem,
# the ratio BM/MI can be expressed as the sum of sides a and c, divided by side b.
# The following print statement displays this final equation.
print(f"The ratio BM/MI is given by the expression: ({side_a} + {side_c}) / {side_b}")
