    "This is an E2 elimination reaction. Here is the step-by-step analysis to determine the final product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: We have a secondary alkyl halide, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, and a strong, sterically hindered base, potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK). These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **E2 Stereochemistry Requirement**: The E2 mechanism requires a specific spatial arrangement: the leaving group (Br) and the abstracted proton (H) must be *anti-periplanar*. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means both the leaving group and the proton must be in axial positions on adjacent carbons.\n3.  **Analyze Substrate Conformation**: The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans* isomer. It exists as an equilibrium between two chair conformations:\n    *   **Diequatorial conformation**: The Br and the methyl group are both in equatorial positions. This is the more stable and major conformation.\n    *   **Diaxial conformation**: The Br and the methyl group are both in axial positions. This is the less stable conformation.\n4.  **Determine the Reactive Conformation**: The E2 reaction can only proceed when the leaving group (Br) is axial. Therefore, the reaction must occur via the less stable diaxial conformation, even though it's present in a small concentration.\n5.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways**: Let's analyze the diaxial conformation, with an axial Br at carbon C1 and an axial methyl group at carbon C2.\n    *   **Elimination towards C2 (Zaitsev product)**: To form a double bond between C1 and C2, a proton must be removed from C2. However, since the methyl group at C2 is axial, the proton at C2 is equatorial. There is no axial proton on C2 that is anti-periplanar to the axial Br. Thus, elimination to form 1-methylcyclohexene is impossible.\n    *   **Elimination towards C6 (Hofmann product)**: Carbon C6 has an axial proton. This axial proton is anti-periplanar to the axial Br at C1. The bulky base can abstract this proton.\n6.  **Conclusion**: Since elimination can only occur by removing the axial proton from C6, the double bond forms between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains at its position (which becomes C3 relative to the double bond). The resulting product is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n```python\n# The reaction is an E2 elimination which requires an anti-periplanar\n# arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a proton.\n# This means both must be in axial positions in the chair conformation.\n# The starting material is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n# For the Br to be axial, the methyl group must also be axial.\n# In this diaxial conformation:\n# - The proton on C2 is equatorial, so elimination to form 1-methylcyclohexene (Zaitsev product) is not possible.\n# - The proton on C6 is axial, allowing for elimination.\n# The base removes the proton from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n# The name of the product has one number: 3\nnumber_in_name = 3\n# The rest of the product name\nproduct_name_parts = [\"-methylcyclohexene\"]\n\n# Printing the final product name, which includes the number 3\nprint(f\"The product is: {number_in_name}{product_name_parts[0]}\")\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
