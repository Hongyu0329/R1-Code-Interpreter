# The reaction is an E2 elimination which requires an anti-periplanar
# arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a proton.
# This means both must be in axial positions in the chair conformation.
# The starting material is a trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.
# For the Br to be axial, the methyl group must also be axial.
# In this diaxial conformation:
# - The proton on C2 is equatorial, so elimination to form 1-methylcyclohexene (Zaitsev product) is not possible.
# - The proton on C6 is axial, allowing for elimination.
# The base removes the proton from C6, forming a double bond between C1 and C6.

# The name of the product has one number: 3
number_in_name = 3
# The rest of the product name
product_name_parts = ["-methylcyclohexene"]

# Printing the final product name, which includes the number 3
