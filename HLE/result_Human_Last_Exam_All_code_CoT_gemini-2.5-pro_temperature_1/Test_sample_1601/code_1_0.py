# The analysis shows that the set Omega corresponds to initial conditions
# where a(0) is in (0, 1] and b(0) is in [10, 20].
# We calculate the measure (area) of this region.

# Define the boundaries for the initial condition a(0).
a_min = 0
a_max = 1

# Define the boundaries for the initial condition b(0).
b_min = 10
b_max = 20

# Calculate the length of the interval for a(0).
delta_a = a_max - a_min

# Calculate the length of the interval for b(0).
delta_b = b_max - b_min

# The measure of the set Omega is the product of the lengths of the intervals.
measure_omega = delta_a * delta_b

# Print the calculation steps as requested.
