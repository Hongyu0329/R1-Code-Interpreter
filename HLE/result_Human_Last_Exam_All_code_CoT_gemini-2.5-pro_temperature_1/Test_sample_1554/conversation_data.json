    "This is a factual question about philosophy. I will first identify the correct philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School. My research indicates that Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz is the philosopher who made this distinction.\n\nTo adhere to the request for a code-based solution, I will create a Python script. This script will store the philosopher's name and an explanation of his concepts in variables and then use the `print()` function to display the information.\n\n```python\ndef solve_philosophy_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    who distinguished between 'symptoms' and 'signals'.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    school = \"Lviv-Warsaw School\"\n    concept = \"hallmark (or mark)\"\n    components = {\n        \"symptom\": \"a natural sign connected by a causal link (e.g., smoke is a symptom of fire)\",\n        \"signal\": \"a conventional sign based on agreement or rule (e.g., a green light is a signal to go)\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The philosopher from the {school} who decomposes the notion of a '{concept}' is {philosopher}.\")\n    print(\"\\nHe distinguished between:\")\n    for component, description in components.items():\n        print(f\"- {component.capitalize()}: {description}\")\n\nsolve_philosophy_question()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
