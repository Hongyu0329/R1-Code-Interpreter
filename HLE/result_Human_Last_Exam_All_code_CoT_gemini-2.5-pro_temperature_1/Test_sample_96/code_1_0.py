# Step 1: Define the problem.
# We are looking for the number of elements g in the Artin group A = A(E_8) satisfying:
# (a) g can be written as a positive word in the standard generators.
# (b) The order of gZ in the quotient group A/Z is exactly 10.
# (c) The word length of g, L(g), is minimal among all elements satisfying (a) and (b).
# Z is the center of A.

# Step 2: Analyze the structure of the group A and its center Z.
# A is the Artin group of type E8. Its Garside element, Delta, is a positive word of length 8.
# The center Z is an infinite cyclic group generated by a power of Delta, Z = <Delta^k0>.
# From the literature, k0 is either 1 or 2.

# Step 3: Analyze the condition on an element g.
# The condition that gZ has order 10 implies g^10 is in Z. Since g is a positive word,
# g^10 must be a positive power of the generator of Z.
# So, g^10 = (Delta^k0)^m for some integer m > 0.

# Step 4: Use the property that g commutes with its powers.
# The element g must commute with g^10. Therefore, g must be in the centralizer of (Delta^k0)^m.
# Let C(x) denote the centralizer of x.
# g is in C((Delta^k0)^m).

# Step 5: Use known theorems about centralizers in Artin groups.
# For an Artin group of spherical type not of type B_n (like E8), the Garside element Delta is "rigid".
# A theorem by Godelle and Lee states that the centralizer of any power of a rigid Delta is the group
# generated by Delta and the center Z.
# C((Delta^k0)^m) = <Z, Delta> = <<Delta^k0>, Delta> = <Delta>.
# This implies that g must be a power of Delta. Let g = Delta^p for some integer p > 0 (since g is a positive word).

# Step 6: Determine the order of gZ = (Delta^p)Z in A/Z.
# The order of (Delta^p)Z is the smallest integer d > 0 such that (Delta^p)^d is in Z = <Delta^k0>.
# This means (Delta^p)^d = (Delta^k0)^j for some integer j.
# Since the Artin group is torsion-free, this word equation implies an exponent equation:
# p * d = k0 * j.
# We are looking for the smallest d > 0, which is given by the formula: d = k0 / gcd(p, k0).

# Step 7: Evaluate the possible orders based on k0.
# Case 1: The center is Z = <Delta> (k0 = 1).
# The order is d = 1 / gcd(p, 1) = 1.
# Case 2: The center is Z = <Delta^2> (k0 = 2).
# The order is d = 2 / gcd(p, 2).
# If p is even, gcd(p, 2) = 2, so d = 1.
# If p is odd, gcd(p, 2) = 1, so d = 2.

# Step 8: Conclude based on the derived order.
# In all possible cases, the order of gZ must be either 1 or 2. It can never be 10.
# Therefore, there are no elements satisfying the condition that their order in A/Z is 10.
# The number of such elements is zero.

# The final equation is simply the count of elements found.
