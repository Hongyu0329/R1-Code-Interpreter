    "This problem asks for the largest natural number `n` for which a specific algebraic K-group is non-zero. This requires specialized knowledge from a field of advanced mathematics called algebraic K-theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Identify the mathematical object in question: The even K-groups, denoted `K_{2n}`, of the ring `Z/27`.\n2.  Search for the relevant theorem that describes the structure of these groups. The computation of the K-groups of `Z/p^k` is a known but complex result. A key theorem by McCarthy (1991) provides the answer.\n3.  State the theorem. It gives a formula for the order of `K_{2n}(Z/p^k)` that depends on whether `n` is greater or equal to `p-1`.\n4.  Apply the theorem to the specific case of `Z/27`, where the prime `p=3` and `k=3`.\n5.  Examine the results for `n=0, 1, 2, ...` to find all values of `n` for which `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero.\n6.  Determine the largest `n` from this set of values.\n7.  Write a Python script to perform the calculations and present the step-by-step reasoning.\n\nThe term \"natural number\" is sometimes ambiguous, potentially including or excluding 0. We will consider `n=0` and check if it yields a non-zero group.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef p_adic_valuation(p, n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the p-adic valuation of n, i.e., the exponent of p in the prime factorization of n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0 or n % p != 0:\n        return 0\n    count = 0\n    # We only need to handle n > 0 as per the theorem's conditions.\n    while n > 0 and n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef solve_k_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest natural number n such that the (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is nonzero.\n    \"\"\"\n    p = 3\n    power = 3\n    ring_name = f\"Z/{p**power}\"\n\n    print(f\"We need to find the largest natural number n such that the K-group K_{{2n}}({ring_name}) is non-zero.\")\n    print(\"To solve this, we use a theorem by R.
