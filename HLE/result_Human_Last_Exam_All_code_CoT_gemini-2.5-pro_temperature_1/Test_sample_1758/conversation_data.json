    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the English phrase \"shock absorber\" would be phonetically adapted into Puerto Rican Spanish, followed by the final transcription.\n\nThe process involves several key phonological rules characteristic of this Spanish dialect:\n\n1.  **Simplification**: Long English loanwords are often shortened. The unstressed initial syllable of \"absorber\" (`/əb-/`) is likely to be dropped, resulting in a simplified form like \"shock sorber\".\n2.  **Adaptation of \"sh\" /ʃ/**: Spanish does not have the \"sh\" sound (/ʃ/). It is most commonly adapted to the \"ch\" sound, which is the palatal affricate /tʃ/. Therefore, \"shock\" becomes \"choc\".\n3.  **Vowel Adaptation**: English vowels are mapped to the nearest Spanish vowel. The /ɑ/ in \"shock\" and the /ɔ/ in \"absorber\" both become /o/. The final schwa /ə/ in \"absorber\" becomes /e/.\n4.  **Lambdacism**: This is a very prominent feature of Puerto Rican Spanish, where the liquid consonant /r/ in a syllable-final position (coda) is pronounced as an /l/. This will happen to both 'r's in \"absorber\".\n    *   The \"sor-\" part becomes \"sol-\".\n    *   The \"-ber\" part becomes \"-bel\".\n5.  **Final Transcription**: Combining these changes, \"shock absorber\" transforms into \"cho-sor-bel\". According to Spanish stress rules, a word ending in the letter 'l' is stressed on the final syllable. The 'b' sound between two vowels is softened to a fricative [β̞].\n\nThis python script will print the final result.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_to_puerto_rican_spanish():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and prints the phonetic transcription of \"shock absorber\"\n    in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n    english_phrase = \"shock absorber\"\n    english_ipa = \"/ʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/\"\n\n    print(f\"Original English Phrase: {english_phrase}\")\n    print(f\"Approximate English IPA: {english_ipa}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step Phonetic Adaptation to Puerto Rican Spanish:\\n\")\n\n    print(\"1.
