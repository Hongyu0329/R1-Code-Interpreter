  # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
  # Reasoning: The quasiprimitive action of G on the face set F implies that the socle N
  # acts transitively on F. The faces of the quotient D_N are the orbits of N on F.
  # Since N is transitive, there's only one orbit, so D_N has one face (is unicellular).
  # This is true regardless of the structure of G/N.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D
  # if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
  # Reasoning: A smooth covering imposes strong conditions on the generators of G.
  # These conditions can be met for groups of type HA (Holomorph of Abelian) and
  # AS (Almost Simple), but are known to be impossible to satisfy for groups of
  # type TW (Wreath Product T wr Z_l).
  answer_b = "HA, AS"

  # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth
  # covering of D_N.
  # Reasoning: As established for part (b), type TW is impossible for any l.
  # Therefore, it is also impossible for the specific case of l <= 5.
  answer_c = "True"

  # Print the final answer in the required format.
