    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we need to use the general topological relations for Feynman diagrams.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formulas:** There are two key formulas that relate the properties of a Feynman diagram:\n    *   A formula for the number of loops (L): `L = I - V + 1`, where `I` is the number of internal lines and `V` is the number of vertices.\n    *   A formula that relates the lines and vertices: `k * V = 2 * I + E`, where `k` is the number of lines meeting at each vertex, and `E` is the number of external lines.\n\n2.  **Establish conditions for minimality:** The question asks for the *minimum* number of vertices. To find this, we should consider the simplest possible type of diagram:\n    *   **Interaction Type (k):** The most common and simple stable interacting scalar field theory is the `phi^4` theory. In this theory, each interaction vertex has 4 lines connected to it, so we'll set `k=4`.\n    *   **External Lines (E):** The simplest diagrams are those with the fewest external lines, representing a process with no incoming or outgoing particles. These are called vacuum diagrams, where `E=0`.\n\n3.  **Solve for V:** We are given `L=2`. Using `k=4` and `E=0`, we can solve the two equations for `V`.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script that takes these parameters (`L`, `k`, `E`), solves for `V`, and prints a clear explanation of the process, including the steps of the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_min_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in an interacting scalar field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # We are given the number of loops.\n    L = 2\n\n    # To find the minimum number of vertices, we consider the simplest possible diagram.\n    # 1.
