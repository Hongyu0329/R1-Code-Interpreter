    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A primitive Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d=p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_k^{a_k}$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. In our case, $d$ is a product of distinct primes, $d=p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$. A character $\\chi$ mod $d$ is primitive if and only if it is a product $\\chi = \\chi_1\\chi_2\\chi_3\\chi_4$ where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i$. A character modulo a prime $p$ is primitive if its order is greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Character Order**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4))$. We are given that this order must be $6$.\n\n3.  **Counting Strategy**: Instead of directly counting characters of order exactly 6, it is easier to first count the number of characters with an order that *divides* a given number $k$. Let's denote this by $\\Psi(k)$. We can then use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (specifically, Mobius inversion on the lattice of divisors) to find the number of characters of order *exactly* 6, which we denote by $\\psi(6)$. The formula is:\n    $\\psi(6) = \\sum_{k|6} \\mu(6/k) \\Psi(k)$\n    where $\\mu$ is the Mobius function.\n\n4.  **Calculate $\\Psi(k)$**: The number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ and order dividing $k$, $\\Psi(k)$, is the product of the number of available primitive characters for each prime factor of $d$. For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the number of primitive characters modulo $p$ with order dividing $k$ is given by $M_p(k) = \\sum_{j|k, j>1, j|(p-1)} \\phi(j)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function. Then, $\\Psi(k) = \\prod_{p|d} M_p(k)$. We will compute this for all divisors $k$ of 6 (i.e., $k=1, 2, 3, 6$).\n\n5.  **Final Calculation**: With the values of $\\Psi(k)$ for $k|6$, we will apply the Mobius inversion formula to find $\\psi(6)$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] += 1\n    return factors\n\ndef euler_totient(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef mobius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Let d = {d} and g = {g}.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d and order g.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize d\n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    prime_factors_d = sorted(d_factors.keys())\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of d = {d} is {' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors_d))}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 2: Explain method and calculate Psi(k) for each k|g\n    print(\"Step 2: We calculate Psi(k), the number of primitive characters with conductor d\")\n    print(\"and order dividing k, for each divisor k of g.\")\n    \n    g_divisors = get_divisors(g)\n    print(f\"The divisors of g = {g} are {g_divisors}.\")\n    \n    Psi_values = {}\n    for k in g_divisors:\n        print(f\"\\n--- Calculating Psi({k}) ---\")\n        \n        prod_M_p_k = 1\n        M_p_k_expressions = []\n        \n        for p in prime_factors_d:\n            p_minus_1 = p - 1\n            k_divisors = get_divisors(k)\n            \n            sum_phi_j = 0\n            j_list = []\n            phi_j_values = []\n\n            for j in k_divisors:\n                if j > 1 and p_minus_1 % j == 0:\n                    j_list.append(j)\n                    phi_val = euler_totient(j)\n                    phi_j_values.append(phi_val)\n                    sum_phi_j += phi_val\n            \n            M_p_k = sum_phi_j\n            print(f\"For p = {p}, p-1 = {p_minus_1}.
