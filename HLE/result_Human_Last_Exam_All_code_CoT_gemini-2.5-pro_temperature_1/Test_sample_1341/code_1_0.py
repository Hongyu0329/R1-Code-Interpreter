# Step 1: Define the financial details of the agreement.
purchase_price = 3000
payment_amount = 500
payments_made = 3  # For November, December, and January.

# Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid by Jack.
total_paid = payments_made * payment_amount
amount_outstanding = purchase_price - total_paid

print(f"Total Purchase Price: ${purchase_price}")
print(f"Payment Amount per Installment: ${payment_amount}")
print(f"Number of Payments Made by Jack: {payments_made}")
print(f"Calculation of Total Paid: {payments_made} payments * ${payment_amount} = ${total_paid}")
print(f"Amount Outstanding: ${purchase_price} - ${total_paid} = ${amount_outstanding}")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 3: Analyze the contract's specific default procedure.
print("Analyzing the contract's default procedure:")
print("1. A payment must be missed.")
print("2. Gary must provide Jack with 'written notice of default'.")
print("3. Jack has three days from the receipt of the notice to pay.")
print("4. Only after the three-day period lapses can Gary retake the vehicle.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 4: Evaluate Gary's actions against the contractual requirements.
print("Evaluating Gary's actions:")
print("On February 1, Jack missed a payment.")
print("On February 2, Gary sent a text message.")
print("\nThe key question is whether a text 'letting him know that he missed a payment' constitutes a formal 'written notice of default'.")
print("A formal notice of default is a specific legal communication intended to trigger the consequences outlined in a contract. A simple text reminder is very unlikely to satisfy this requirement.")
print("\nBecause a proper written notice was not sent, the three-day period for Jack to cure the default was never officially started.")
print("-" * 30)

# Step 5: Final Conclusion.
print("Conclusion:")
print("The terms of the contract are enforceable, but Gary failed to follow the agreed-upon procedure.")
print("Gary is not yet entitled to retake possession of the vehicle because sending an informal text message does not constitute the 'written notice of default' required to start the repossession process.")
