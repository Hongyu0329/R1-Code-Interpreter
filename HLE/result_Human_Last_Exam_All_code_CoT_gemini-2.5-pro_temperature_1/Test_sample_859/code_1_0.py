    Calculates the minimal number of new edges to make G' 2-edge-connected.

    The problem specifies that v1, v2, v3 have degrees d, d+1, d+1,
    where d is an even integer. The value of d is not given, so the
    answer is a formula in terms of d. This function demonstrates the
    calculation for a sample even value of d.
