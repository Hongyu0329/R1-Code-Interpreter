    "To find the number of states in the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton (DFA) that recognizes the given language, we can use a computational approach. The process involves these steps:\n1.  Define the regular expression for the language.\n2.  Use a library to construct a Nondeterministic Finite-State Automaton (NFA) from this regular expression.\n3.  Convert the NFA into an equivalent DFA using the subset construction algorithm.\n4.  Minimize the resulting DFA using an algorithm like Hopcroft's algorithm.\n5.  Count the number of states in the final minimal DFA.\n\nI will use the `automata-lib` Python library, which automates this entire process. The following Python script implements these steps to calculate the number of states.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the necessary library installed:\n# pip install automata-lib\ntry:\n    from automata.fa.nfa import NFA\n    from automata.fa.dfa import DFA\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the 'automata-lib' library using: pip install automata-lib\")\n    exit()\n\ndef solve_dfa_states():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of states in the minimal DFA for the given regular expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The language L is defined by the regular expression:\n    # ( (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^* (b a | b b a | c a) )^* (b | c)^* a ( a | b c | c b | b b b )^*\n    # We represent this regular expression as a string.\n    # The library uses '|' for union, implicit concatenation, and '*' for Kleene star.\n    \n    s_re = \"(b|c)*\"\n    m_re = \"(a|bc|cb|bbb)*\"\n    t_re = \"(ba|bba|ca)\"\n    \n    # The full regular expression L = ( (S a M T)^* S a M )\n    # Note: an initial version of this regex might be written as (R T)* R where R = S a M.\n    # This is equivalent to R (T R)*. The library can handle either form.\n    # We will use the form: R (T R)*, which is S a M (T S a M)*\n    # Let's stick to the original expression to avoid transcription errors.\n    \n    regex_str = f\"({s_re}a{m_re}{t_re})*{s_re}a{m_re}\"\n\n    # 1. Create an NFA from the regular expression.\n    # The `from_regex` method automatically infers the alphabet.\n    nfa = NFA.from_regex(regex_str)\n\n    # 2. Convert the NFA to a DFA.\n    dfa = DFA.from_nfa(nfa)\n\n    # 3. Minimize the DFA.\n    minimal_dfa = dfa.minify()\n\n    # 4. Get the number of states.\n    num_states = len(minimal_dfa.states)\n\n    # As requested, printing the final result as an 'equation'.\n    # The calculation is complex and encapsulated by the library.\n    # The final result is the number of states.\n    print(f\"The number of states in the minimal DFA is: {num_states}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_dfa_states()\n\n```\n<<<G>>>"
