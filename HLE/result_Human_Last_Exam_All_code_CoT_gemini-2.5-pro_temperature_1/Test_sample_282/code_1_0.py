    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound for K.
    # Let X be a compact subset of G. Without loss of generality, we can assume the identity
    # element e is in X. (If not, we can translate X to X' = x_0^{-1} * X for some x_0 in X.
    # This translation does not affect the Haar measure of the set or its product set, so
    # mu(X') = mu(X) and mu((X')^3) = mu(X^3)).
    # If e is in X, then X itself is a subset of X^3, because any element x in X can be
    # written as e*e*x, which is an element of X^3.
    # Therefore, mu(X) <= mu(X^3).
    # Dividing by mu(X) (which is positive), we get mu(X^3) / mu(X) >= 1.
    # Since this holds for any compact set X, the infimum K must also be at least 1.
    lower_bound = 1

    # Step 2: Establish an upper bound for K.
    # To find an upper bound, we need to show that there are sets for which the expansion
    # ratio mu(X^3) / mu(X) can be arbitrarily close to some value.
    # Let's consider the structure of G = SL_2(R). It contains the subgroup B of
    # upper-triangular matrices with determinant 1.
    # B = { [[a, b], [0, 1/a]] | a is a non-zero real, b is a real }.
    # This subgroup B is a solvable Lie group. All solvable Lie groups are amenable.
    # A key property of amenable groups is that they admit "Følner sets". A Følner
    # sequence is a sequence of compact sets X_n for which the relative measure of the
    # boundary becomes negligible. This implies that for any k >= 2,
    # inf_{X subset of B} [ mu_B(X^k) / mu_B(X) ] = 1,
    # where mu_B is the Haar measure on B.
    # For our case with k=3, this means we can find compact sets within B for which the
    # expansion ratio is arbitrarily close to 1.
    # The Haar measure mu of G, when restricted to the subgroup B, is a Haar measure
    # on B (up to a constant, which cancels out in the ratio).
    # So, for any compact set Y contained in B, mu(Y^3)/mu(Y) = mu_B(Y^3)/mu_B(Y).
    # The infimum K is taken over ALL compact subsets of G. This includes all compact
    # subsets of B. Therefore, K must be less than or equal to the infimum over sets in B.
    # K <= inf_{Y subset of B} [ mu(Y^3) / mu(Y) ] = 1.
    upper_bound = 1

    # Step 3: Conclude the value of K.
    # From Step 1, we have K >= 1.
    # From Step 2, we have K <= 1.
    # The only value that satisfies both inequalities is 1.
    final_K = 1

    # The final equation is K = 1. As requested, we print the number in this equation.
