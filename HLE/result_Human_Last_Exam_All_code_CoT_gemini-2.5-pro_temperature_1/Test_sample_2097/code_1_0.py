# Given the ambiguity, and the hint n=4 in B^4n, we choose n=4.

# If "minimum" means minimum absolute value, the answer is M_z(1,1) ~ -3.18
# If "minimum" means most negative, the answer tends to -infinity.
# Let's provide the value for n=4 as the most likely intended answer for a puzzle-like question.
