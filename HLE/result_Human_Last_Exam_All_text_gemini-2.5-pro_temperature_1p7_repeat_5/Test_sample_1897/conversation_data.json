    "An analysis of the question step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Express the infinite product in a standard form**\n\nThe given infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$.\nLet $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product can be written as:\n$P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1}) = (1-q)(1-q^3)(1-q^5)\\cdots$\nThis is a standard form in the theory of q-series and modular forms.\n\n**Careful Point 1:** Recognize the product form.\nThis product is a part of the Euler function $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)$. The Euler function can be split into products over even and odd powers of $q$:\n$\\phi(q) = \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k}) \\prod_{k=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2k-1})$\nThe second part is our product $P$ (with index shift $n=k-1$). The first part is $\\phi(q^2)$.\nSo, $\\phi(q) = \\phi(q^2) \\cdot P$.\nThis gives an expression for $P$:\n$P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)} = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^n)}{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})}$, with $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\nThis form relates the product to the Dedekind eta function or Weber modular functions.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the product to Weber modular functions**\n\nThe Weber modular functions are a set of three functions, $f(\\tau)$, $f_1(\\tau)$, and $f_2(\\tau)$, that are closely related to the Dedekind eta function. Different authors use slightly different definitions, which can be a source of confusion. We will use the definitions as found in Berndt's work on Ramanujan's Notebooks.\n\n**Careful Point 2:** Use a consistent set of definitions for modular functions.\nLet the nome be $q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}$. The definitions are:\n$f(\\tau) = q^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1+q^{2n-1})$\n$f_1(\\tau) = q^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^{2n-1})$\n$f_2(\\tau) = \\sqrt{2} q^{1/12} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1+q^{2n})$\n\nOur product is $P = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{-\\pi})^{2n-1})$. We match the variable $e^{-\\pi}$ with the nome $q$ in the definition of $f_1(\\tau)$.\n$e^{-\\pi} = e^{i\\pi\\tau} \\implies -\\pi = i\\pi\\tau \\implies \\tau=i$.\nFrom the definition of $f_1(\\tau)$, we have:\n$f_1(i) = (e^{i\\pi(i)})^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1-(e^{i\\pi(i)})^{2n-1}) = (e^{-\\pi})^{-1/24} P = e^{\\pi/24} P$.\nThis gives a direct relation for our product $P$:\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate the Weber function $f_1(i)$**\n\nTo find the value of $P$, we need the specific value of $f_1(i)$. This is a known value in the theory of complex multiplication and can be found using Ramanujan's class invariants.\n\n**Careful Point 3:** Relate Weber functions to Ramanujan's class invariants.\nRamanujan defined the class invariants $G_n$ and $g_n$ as:\n$G_n = G(e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}})$ where $G(q) = q^{-1/24}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1+q^{2n-1})$\n$g_n = g(e^{-\\pi\\sqrt{n}})$ where $g(q) = q^{-1/24}\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})$\n\nBy comparing the q-product definitions of $f, f_1$ with those of $G, g$, with the identification $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ and $\\tau=i\\sqrt{n}$, we find:\n$G_n = f(i\\sqrt{n})$\n$g_n = f_1(i\\sqrt{n})$\n\n**Careful Point 4:** Use the tabulated value for the class invariant.\nWe need $f_1(i)$, which corresponds to $n=1$. So, $f_1(i) = g_1$.\nThe value of $g_1$ is a well-known result from Ramanujan's work. From various sources, including Berndt's tables of class invariants:\n$g_1 = 2^{-1/8}$.\nTherefore, $f_1(i) = 2^{-1/8}$.\n\n**(Self-consistency check)** The Weber functions satisfy identities like $f(\\tau)^8=f_1(\\tau)^8+f_2(\\tau)^8$ and $f_1(i\\sqrt{n})=f_2(i/ \\sqrt{n})$. For $n=1$, $f_1(i)=f_2(i)$.\nThe values $f_1(i)=2^{-1/8}$ and $f_2(i)=2^{-1/8}$ imply $f(i)^8 = (2^{-1/8})^8+(2^{-1/8})^8 = 1/2+1/2=1$, so $f(i)=1$.\nFrom class invariants, $f(i)=G_1$. The tabulated value is $G_1=1$. This confirms our values are consistent.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nNow we substitute the value of $f_1(i)$ back into our expression for $P$.\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$\n$P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{-1/8}$.\n\nThis is a closed expression for the infinite product. It can be written in a few ways, but this form is clear and common.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation**\n\n1.  Let the product be $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$.\n2.  $P = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n-1})$.\n3.  The Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$ is defined as $f_1(\\tau) = (e^{i\\pi\\tau})^{-1/24} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-(e^{i\\pi\\tau})^{2n-1})$.\n4.  By setting $\\tau=i$, the nome $e^{i\\pi\\tau}$ becomes $e^{-\\pi}=q$.\n5.  Therefore, $P = q^{1/24} f_1(i) = (e^{-\\pi})^{1/24} f_1(i) = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$.\n6.  The value of $f_1(i)$ is given by Ramanujan's class invariant $g_1$.\n7.  $f_1(i)=g_1 = 2^{-1/8}$.\n8.  Substituting this value, we get $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\cdot 2^{-1/8}$.\n\nThe final expression is $2^{-1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$."
