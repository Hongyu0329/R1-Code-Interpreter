    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the piece and the specific part.**\nThe piece is Antonín Dvořák's \"Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, Op. 4\". We need to focus on the part for the \"First Violin\" (Violino I) at the very end of the final movement (Movement IV: Finale. Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Locate the last three notes in the musical score.**\nTo find the notes, we must look at the last few measures of the First Violin part. Musical scores are read from left to right, so the \"last\" notes are those at the very end of the piece.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the notes in the final measures.**\nLooking at the score for the First Violin part in the last three measures of the symphony:\n*   **Final measure:** The first violins play a single whole note with a fermata (a hold). This note is a **B♭4** (the B-flat located on the middle line of the treble clef).\n*   **Penultimate (second-to-last) measure:** Before the final note, the first violins play a half note. This note is a **D5** (the D located on the fourth line of the treble clef).\n*   **Antepenultimate (third-to-last) measure:** Before the D5, the first violins play another half note. This note is an **A5** (the A located on the first ledger line above the treble clef).\n\n**Step 4: List the last three notes.**\nWorking backward from the end, the last three notes played by the first violin are:\n1.  B♭4\n2.  D5\n3.  A5\n\n**Step 5: Compare the pitches to find the lowest one.**\nNow, we compare the pitches of these three notes: A5, D5, and B♭4.\n*   A5 is a very high note.\n*   D5 is lower than A5.\n*   B♭4 is lower than D5.\n\nTherefore, of the last three notes played by the first violin section, B♭4 is the lowest in pitch.\n\n<<<B-flat>>>"
