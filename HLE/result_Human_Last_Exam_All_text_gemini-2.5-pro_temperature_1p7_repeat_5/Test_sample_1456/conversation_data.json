    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest possible number of composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Key Definitions**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that consists of more than one point.\n*   **Subcontinuum:** A subset of a continuum that is itself a continuum. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not the entire space.\n*   **Composant:** For a point `p` in a continuum `X`, the composant of `p`, denoted `C(p)`, is the set of all points `q` in `X` such that `p` and `q` are contained in some proper subcontinuum of `X`. Essentially, it's the union of all proper subcontinua containing `p`.\n*   **Decomposable Continuum:** A continuum that can be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum that is not decomposable.\n\n### **Step 2: Relate the Number of Composants to Decomposability**\n\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the theory of continua that classifies continua based on their number of composants:\n\n*   **Theorem:** A continuum has exactly **one** composant if and only if it is decomposable. If a continuum is decomposable, its single composant is the entire space itself.\n*   **Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** A continuum has **uncountably many** composants if and only if it is indecomposable. The cardinality of the set of composants is `c`, the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., the size of the set of real numbers).\n\nTherefore, the number of composants of any given continuum is either 1 or `c`.\n\n### **Step 3: Analyze the Product Space `K = X × Y`**\n\nLet `X` and `Y` be two nondegenerate continua. Their product `K = X × Y` (with the product topology) has the following properties:\n*   The product of two compact spaces is compact.\n*   The product of two connected spaces is connected.\n*   The product of two metric spaces is metrizable.\n*   Therefore, `K = X × Y` is also a continuum.\n\nThe question now becomes: how many composants can `K` have? Based on Step 2, the answer will be either 1 or `c`. To find the *largest possible number*, we need to determine if `K` can be indecomposable.\n\n### **Step 4: Relate the Decomposability of the Product to its Factors**\n\nAnother key theorem connects the decomposability of a product space to the decomposability of its factor spaces:\n\n*   **Theorem:** The product continuum `X × Y` is decomposable if and only if at least one of the factor spaces, `X` or `Y`, is decomposable.\n*   **Corollary:** The product continuum `X × Y` is **indecomposable** if and only if **both** `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.\n\n### **Step 5: Synthesize the Results to Find the Maximum Number**\n\nTo find the largest possible number of composants for `K = X × Y`, we need to find the scenario that yields the maximum value.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: At least one of `X` or `Y` is decomposable.**\n    *   According to the theorem in Step 4, the product `K = X × Y` is decomposable.\n    *   According to the theorem in Step 2, a decomposable continuum has exactly **1** composant.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Both `X` and `Y` are indecomposable.**\n    *   We need to ensure that such continua exist. Nondegenerate indecomposable continua are well-known in topology. Examples include the **pseudo-arc** and the **Knaster continuum** (buckethandle).\n    *   Let's choose `X` and `Y` to be two such nondegenerate indecomposable continua.\n    *   According to the corollary in Step 4, the product `K = X × Y` is indecomposable.\n    *   According to the theorem in Step 2, an indecomposable continuum has `c` (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe number of composants for the product `X × Y` can be either 1 or `c`. The largest of these two values is `c`. This maximum is achieved when we select two nondegenerate indecomposable continua for `X` and `Y`. Since such continua exist, the largest possible number of composants is indeed `c`.\n\nThe cardinality of the continuum, `c`, is an uncountable infinity (`c = 2^{\\aleph_0}`).\n\nFinal Answer: The largest possible number of composants is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n<<<c>>>"
