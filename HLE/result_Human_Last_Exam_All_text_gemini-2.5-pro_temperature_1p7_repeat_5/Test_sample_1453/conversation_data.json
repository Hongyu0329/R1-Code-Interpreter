    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the protein coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**1. Understand the Coiled-Coil Structure and the Heptad Repeat**\n\nCoiled-coils are formed by two or more alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, known as a heptad repeat, designated `abcdefg`.\n\n*   **'a' and 'd' positions:** These are the most critical positions. Their side chains are typically hydrophobic and point inward, forming the core of the coiled-coil. The identity of the amino acids at these positions largely dictates the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, etc.).\n*   **'e' and 'g' positions:** These are typically charged or polar residues located on the solvent-exposed face, but adjacent to the core. They often form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n*   **'b', 'c', and 'f' positions:** These are solvent-exposed positions and are usually occupied by hydrophilic residues.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided Sequence to Identify the Heptad Repeat**\n\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG` (30 amino acids long).\n\nTo find the correct heptad repeat \"frame\", we must locate the hydrophobic 'a' and 'd' positions. The most reliable method is to look for a highly regular pattern of hydrophobic residues. In a heptad repeat, 'a' and 'd' are spaced as `a-x-x-d`.\n\nLet's look for the most regularly spaced hydrophobic residue. The sequence contains Leucine (L) at positions 7, 14, 21, and 28.\nSequence: `GEIAQS`**L**`KEIAKS`**L**`KEIAWS`**L**`KEIAQS`**L**`KG`\nPositions: 1.......**7**........**14**........**21**.........**28**..30\n\nThe spacing between these Leucines is exactly 7 amino acids (14-7=7, 21-14=7, 28-21=7). This is a perfect heptad repeat spacing. It is extremely likely that these Leucines occupy the same position within the repeat. Given that Leucine is a large hydrophobic residue, it is a canonical choice for the 'd' position.\n\n**3. Identify the Residues at the Core 'a' and 'd' Positions**\n\nAssuming the Leucines are at the 'd' position, we can identify the residues at the 'a' position. The 'a' position is three residues before the 'd' position in the sequence (`a` -> b -> c -> `d`).\n\n*   **d-position at 7 (L)** -> **a-position at 4 (7-3)**. Residue at position 4 is **A** (Alanine).\n*   **d-position at 14 (L)** -> **a-position at 11 (14-3)**. Residue at position 11 is **A** (Alanine).\n*   **d-position at 21 (L)** -> **a-position at 18 (21-3)**. Residue at position 18 is **A** (Alanine).\n*   **d-position at 28 (L)** -> **a-position at 25 (28-3)**. Residue at position 25 is **A** (Alanine).\n\nTherefore, the core of this coiled-coil is formed by a perfectly repeating pattern:\n*   **'a' positions are all Alanine (A).**\n*   **'d' positions are all Leucine (L).**\n\n**4. Determine the Oligomeric State based on Knobs-into-Holes Packing of the A(a)-L(d) Motif**\n\nThe oligomeric state is determined by how efficiently the \"knobs\" (side chains from one helix) pack into the \"holes\" (spaces between side chains on the opposing helices). The size and shape of the 'a' and 'd' side chains are the main factors.\n\n*   **Alanine (A):** has a very small hydrophobic side chain (-CHâ‚ƒ).\n*   **Leucine (L):** has a larger isobutyl side chain.\n\nLet's consider the packing for different oligomeric states:\n*   **Dimer:** The interface involves packing of `a` knobs against `d` knobs (heterotypic packing). Packing a very small knob (Ala) with a larger one (Leu) can be inefficient, leading to poor van der Waals contacts and a less stable interface.\n*   **Trimer:** The interface consists of two distinct hydrophobic seams running along the central axis. One seam is formed by the packing of three 'a' positions (`Ala-Ala-Ala`), and the other by the packing of three 'd' positions (`Leu-Leu-Leu`). This is called homotypic packing. While the `Ala-Ala-Ala` layer is made of small residues and might seem \"under-packed\", this segregated packing allows the helices to adjust their superhelical twist and radius to better accommodate the significant size difference between the Ala and Leu side chains. The strongly favorable packing of the three Leucines in their layer can drive the formation of a trimer.\n*   **Tetramer:** Classic tetramers are often formed by patterns like `L(a)-L(d)` or `I(a)-L(d)`. The `A(a)-L(d)` pattern is not a classic tetramer-forming motif.\n\n**Careful Point/Conclusion:** Extensive experimental and computational studies by labs like Peter Kim's and Tom Alber's have shown that coiled-coils with Alanine at the 'a' position and Leucine at the 'd' position preferentially form **trimers**. The energetic penalty of the inefficient `A-L` packing in a dimer is greater than the penalty of the potentially under-packed `A-A-A` layer in a trimer.\n\nThus, based on the `A(a)-L(d)` core composition, the protein is expected to form a trimer.\n\n**Final Answer:** The oligomeric state would be 3.\n\n<<<B>>>"
