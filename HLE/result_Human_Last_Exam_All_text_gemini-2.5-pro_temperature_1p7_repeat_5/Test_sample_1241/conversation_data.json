    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System of Equations:**\n    The problem presents a system of four linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and one conservation equation, which is a Kolmogorov-Chapman system. This system models a continuous-time Markov chain with four states {0, 1, 2, 3}. $P_i(t)$ represents the probability of the system being in state $i$ at time $t$. The $\\lambda_{ij}$ are the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n    The given system is:\n    $$ P_{0}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) + \\lambda_{10}P_{1}(t) $$\n    $$ P_{1}'(t) = -\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n    $$ P_{2}'(t) = \\lambda_{12}P_{1}(t) - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})P_{2}(t) $$\n    $$ P_{3}'(t) = \\lambda_{23}P_{2}(t) - \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n    And the conservation of probability:\n    $$ P_{0}(t) + P_{1}(t) + P_{2}(t) + P_{3}(t) = 1 $$\n\n2.  **Check for Consistency and Correct a Typo:**\n    For a valid Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the sum of probabilities must be constant. Therefore, the sum of their derivatives must be zero:\n    $$ P_{0}'(t) + P_{1}'(t) + P_{2}'(t) + P_{3}'(t) = 0 $$\n    Let's sum the given equations:\n    - Coefficients of $P_0(t)$: $-\\lambda_{01} - \\lambda_{01} = -2\\lambda_{01}$\n    - Coefficients of $P_1(t)$: $\\lambda_{10} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12}) + \\lambda_{12} = 0$\n    - Coefficients of $P_2(t)$: $\\lambda_{21} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}) + \\lambda_{23} = 0$\n    - Coefficients of $P_3(t)$: $\\lambda_{31} - \\lambda_{31} = 0$\n    The sum is $-2\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$. Since $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019 \\neq 0$, this is not zero in general, which contradicts the condition that the sum of probabilities is 1.\n    In a standard Kolmogorov-Chapman system, the term representing flow from state $j$ to state $i$ is $+\\lambda_{ji}P_j(t)$. The second equation has a term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$, which likely represents flow from state 0 into state 1. This term should be positive. This indicates a typo. The correct second equation should be:\n    $$ P_{1}'(t) = +\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t) - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})P_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{21}P_{2}(t) + \\lambda_{31}P_{3}(t) $$\n    With this correction, the sum of derivatives becomes zero, and the system is consistent. We will proceed with the corrected equation.\n\n3.  **Find the Steady-State (Equilibrium) Equations:**\n    The question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty)$. This refers to the steady-state probabilities. In the steady state, the probabilities are constant, so their time derivatives are zero: $P_i'(t) = 0$. Let $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$ denote the steady-state probabilities.\n    The system of ODEs becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n    1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n4.  **Substitute the Given Values and Solve the System:**\n    The given values are:\n    $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$, $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$, $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$, $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$, $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$, $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$.\n\n    Let's use equations (1), (3), and (4) to express $p_0, p_2, p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n    - From (3): $\\lambda_{12}p_{1} = (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2} \\implies 0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008)p_2 \\implies 0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$.\n    - From (4): $\\lambda_{23}p_{2} = \\lambda_{31}p_{3} \\implies 0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$.\n    Combining these, we get a simple relationship: $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n\n    - From (1): $\\lambda_{01}p_{0} = \\lambda_{10}p_{1} \\implies 0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019}p_1$.\n\n5.  **Use the Normalization Condition to Find the Probabilities:**\n    Now substitute these relationships into the normalization equation (5):\n    $$ p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1 $$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019}\\right)p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1 $$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3\\right)p_1 = 1 $$\n    Let's use fractions to maintain precision: $\\frac{0.65}{0.019} = \\frac{650}{19}$.\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 3\\right)p_1 = 1 $$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{650 + 3 \\times 19}{19}\\right)p_1 = 1 $$\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}\\right)p_1 = 1 $$\n    $$ \\frac{707}{19}p_1 = 1 \\implies p_1 = \\frac{19}{707} $$\n\n6.  **Calculate the Required Value:**\n    The problem asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n    We know $p_0 = \\frac{650}{19}p_1$.\n    So, $p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{19}p_1 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{650}{19} + 1\\right)p_1 = \\left(\\frac{650+19}{19}\\right)p_1 = \\frac{669}{19}p_1$.\n    Now substitute the value we found for $p_1$:\n    $$ p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{669}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707} $$\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    The final answer is the value of the fraction $669/707$.\n    $$ \\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768... $$\n    Rounding to five decimal places gives 0.94625.\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
