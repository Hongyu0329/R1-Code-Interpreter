    "An analysis of the user's question is performed step by step, all the careful points are listed, and the final answer is acquired with a step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The core task is to calculate the final value of a variable `x`, which starts at 0, after executing a series of `n` statements.\n2.  **Identify the Operations:** There are two operations: `++` which increments `x` by 1, and `--` which decrements `x` by 1.\n3.  **Analyze the Statement Format:** A statement is a string containing one operation and the variable 'X'. The problem explicitly states, \"The operation and the variable can be written in any order.\" This is a critical detail. This means there are four possible valid statement strings:\n    *   `++X` (pre-increment)\n    *   `X++` (post-increment)\n    *   `--X` (pre-decrement)\n    *   `X--` (post-decrement)\n4.  **Analyze the Input/Output:**\n    *   **Input:** The first line is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 150), the number of statements. The next `n` lines each contain one of the four possible statements.\n    *   **Output:** A single integer representing the final value of `x`.\n\n### Analysis of the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Program Logic:** The program initializes a variable `tresult` (representing `x`) to 0. It then enters a loop that runs `n` times (using the variable `t` from input). In each iteration, it reads a statement as a `String` called `test`.\n2.  **Conditional Checks:** The core logic lies in these two `if` statements:\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))`\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`\n3.  **Identifying the Flaw:** The problem states the operation and variable can be in any order. The Java code, however, specifically checks for the substrings `\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X++\"`, the string `\"X++\"` does **not** contain the substring `\"++X\"`. The first `if` condition will be false. The second will also be false. `tresult` will not be changed.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X--\"`, the string `\"X--\"` does **not** contain the substring `\"--X\"`. Both `if` conditions will be false. `tresult` will not be changed.\n4.  **Conclusion on Correctness:** The program fails to handle the \"post-fix\" notations (`X++` and `X--`). Therefore, the program does **not** solve the problem correctly for all valid inputs. The answer must begin with 'N'.\n\n### Creating the Most Efficient C Program\n\nSince the program is incorrect, we need to determine the characteristics of the most efficient C program that *does* solve the problem correctly, according to the specified metrics.\n\n#### Metric 1: `x` - Smallest Number of Character Comparisons (for n=100)\n\nTo be \"fastest\", we want to minimize the work done inside the loop. The key task is to distinguish an increment operation from a decrement operation.\n*   **Observation:** In all four possible statements (`++X`, `X++`, `--X`, `X--`), the middle character (at index 1) uniquely identifies the operation.\n    *   In `++X` and `X++`, the character at index 1 is `+`.\n    *   In `--X` and `X--`, the character at index 1 is `-`.\n*   **Optimal Strategy:** We can read each statement string and check only the character at index 1.\n    ```c\n    if (statement[1] == '+') {\n        x++;\n    } else {\n        x--;\n    }\n    ```\n*   **Calculation:** This logic performs exactly **one** character comparison per statement. For an input of 100 statements, the total number of comparisons is 1 * 100 = 100. This is the theoretical minimum, as we must inspect at least one character of each statement to know what to do.\n*   **Result:** `x = 100`.\n\n#### Metric 2: `y` - Smallest Memory Size in Bytes (B)\n\nTo use the \"least memory\", we must select the smallest possible data types for the variables needed to solve the problem.\n1.  **Variable for `n` (number of statements):** The constraint is `1 <= n <= 150`. The smallest standard C data type that can hold values up to 150 is `unsigned char` (range 0-255), which uses **1 byte**.\n2.  **Variable for `x` (the result):** The initial value is 0. With `n` up to 150, the final value of `x` can range from -150 to +150.\n    *   A `signed char` (range -128 to 127) is not large enough.\n    *   The next smallest type is `short int` (typically range -32,768 to 32,767), which is sufficient and uses **2 bytes**.\n3.  **Variable for Input Processing:** We need to read part of the input statement to perform the comparison. Instead of reading the whole string into a 4-byte buffer (`char s[4]`), we can use a more memory-efficient `scanf` trick (`scanf(\" %*c%c\", &op_char);`) to read just the crucial middle character. This requires a single `char` variable to store it. This uses **1 byte**.\n4.  **Total Minimal Memory:** The sum of the sizes of the necessary variables is:\n    `sizeof(n) + sizeof(x) + sizeof(temporary_char) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4` bytes.\n*   **Result:** `y = 4`.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   The program is incorrect, so the prefix is 'N'.\n*   The value for `x` (smallest comparisons) is 100.\n*   The value for `y` (smallest memory) is 4.\n*   The final answer is in the format `Nx+y`.\n\n<<<N100+4>>>"
