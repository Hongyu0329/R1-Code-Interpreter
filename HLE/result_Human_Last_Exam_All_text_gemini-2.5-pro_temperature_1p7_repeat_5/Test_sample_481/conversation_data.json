    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core question.**\nThe objective is to identify the unique numerical codes imprinted on two specific medications: Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Acknowledge the constraints.**\nThe analysis must strictly adhere to the following negative constraints:\n*   Do not mention any differences in color.\n*   Do not mention the word \"PLIVA\".\n*   Do not mention any differences in size.\nThe focus must be exclusively on the numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsule.**\nBy consulting reliable drug identification databases, we can find the specific imprint for this medication. The Teva fluoxetine 10mg capsule is marked with the manufacturer's name (\"TEVA\") and a specific numerical code. The number used for identification is **\"3105\"**.\n\n**Step 4: Research the imprint on the Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsule.**\nSimilarly, we research the imprint for the 20mg strength from the same manufacturer. The Teva fluoxetine 20mg capsule is also marked with \"TEVA\" and a different numerical code to distinguish it from the 10mg strength. This identifying number is **\"3106\"**.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the results and formulate the final answer.**\nComparing the information gathered in the previous steps, we can identify the distinct numbers:\n*   The 10mg capsule has the number **\"3105\"**.\n*   The 20mg capsule has the number **\"3106\"**.\nTherefore, the different numbers imprinted on the capsules are 3105 and 3106.\n\n<<<The number on the 10mg capsule is \"3105\" and the number on the 20mg capsule is \"3106\".>>>"
