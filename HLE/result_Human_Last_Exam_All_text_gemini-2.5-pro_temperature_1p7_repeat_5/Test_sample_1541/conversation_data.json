    "### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Objective:** The program needs to read a string representing a sum of numbers (e.g., \"3+1+4+1+2\"), rearrange the numbers in non-decreasing order, and print the new sum (e.g., \"1+1+2+3+4\").\n2.  **Input:** The input is a single string `s`.\n    *   It contains only digits '1', '2', '3', '4' and the '+' character.\n    *   It's a valid sum, meaning digits and '+' alternate.\n    *   The maximum length of `s` is 1000 characters.\n3.  **Output:** A string representing the same sum with the numbers sorted.\n4.  **Core Constraint:** The solution must be the \"most memory-efficient C program\". This means we must minimize the total memory used by the variables in our program.\n\n---\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Algorithm Choice:** A generic sorting algorithm like quicksort would require extracting the numbers into an array first. Given the string length (max 1000), there can be up to `(1000+1)/2 = 501` numbers. Storing these in an `int` array would take `501 * 4 = 2004` bytes, which is not very memory-efficient. Since the numbers are limited to a very small range (1, 2, 3, 4), **Counting Sort** is a far superior algorithm in this case. It is efficient in both time and memory.\n\n2.  **Input Handling:** A naive approach reads the entire string into a character array buffer: `char s[1001];`. This immediately consumes over 1KB of memory. To be memory-efficient, we should avoid storing the entire string. We can process the input one character at a time using a function like `getchar()`.\n\n3.  **Memory Usage of Variables:** To achieve the most memory-efficient solution, we must:\n    *   Declare as few variables as possible.\n    *   For each variable, choose the smallest possible standard data type (e.g., `char`, `short`, `int`) that can safely hold all of its required values.\n    *   Reuse variables where their lifetimes do not overlap (e.g., a variable used for input can be reused later as a loop counter).\n\n4.  **Output Generation:** The output needs to be generated by printing the sorted numbers separated by `+`. We must handle the placement of the `+` symbols correctly (i.e., not printing a `+` before the first number or after the last number). A simple flag variable is an efficient way to manage this.\n\n---\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nLet's design the most memory-efficient C program following the principles above.\n\n**1. Algorithm: `getchar()` with Counting Sort**\n\n*   We will not use a large buffer for the input string. We'll read character by character.\n*   We'll use a small array to count the occurrences of the numbers '1', '2', '3', and '4'.\n\n**2. Variable Declaration and Memory Calculation**\n\nWe need the following variables:\n\n*   **A counter array:** To store the frequencies of the four numbers (1, 2, 3, 4).\n    *   Name: `counts`\n    *   Size: 4 elements are needed.\n    *   Data Type: The maximum number of terms is 501. A `char` (range 0-255) is too small. A `short` (range up to 32,767, typically 2 bytes) is sufficient.\n    *   Memory: `short counts[4];` -> `4 * sizeof(short)` = `4 * 2` = **8 bytes**.\n\n*   **An input character/loop variable:** To read the input with `getchar()` and later to be reused as the main loop counter for printing.\n    *   Name: `c_or_i`\n    *   Data Type: `getchar()` returns an `int` to be able to represent the special `EOF` value. Therefore, this variable must be an `int`.\n    *   Memory: `int c_or_i;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n*   **A nested loop variable:** For the inner loop that prints a number multiple times according to its count.\n    *   Name: `j`\n    *   Data Type: This loop will run up to 501 times. A `short` (2 bytes) is sufficient.\n    *   Memory: `short j;` -> `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\n*   **A printing flag:** To handle the '+' signs correctly, ensuring one isn't printed before the first number.\n    *   Name: `first`\n    *   Data Type: This is a simple flag that can be 0 or 1. A `char` (1 byte) is the smallest data type suitable for this.\n    *   Memory: `char first;` -> `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n**3. Total Memory Calculation (`m`)**\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by all declared variables.\n\n`m = sizeof(counts) + sizeof(c_or_i) + sizeof(j) + sizeof(first)`\n`m = (8 bytes) + (4 bytes) + (2 bytes) + (1 byte)`\n`m = 15` bytes\n\nThis configuration is the most memory-efficient as it avoids large buffers and uses the smallest appropriate data types for each task. The total memory used for variables is 15 bytes, assuming standard `sizeof(short)=2`, `sizeof(int)=4`, and `sizeof(char)=1`.\n\n<<<15>>>"
