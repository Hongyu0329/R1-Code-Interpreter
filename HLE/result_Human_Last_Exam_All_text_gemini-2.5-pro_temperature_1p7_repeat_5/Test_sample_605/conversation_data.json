    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the Crawley-Nordström invariant.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions and Input**\n\n*   **Crawley-Nordström (CN) Invariant:** This is a topological invariant for certain types of 7-dimensional manifolds, including the links of isolated complex surface singularities. For the link of a weighted homogeneous polynomial singularity, it's a specific rational number calculated from the weights and the degree.\n*   **Calabi-Yau Link:** This refers to the 7-manifold formed by the intersection of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface with a sphere in $\\mathbb{C}^5$. A key property of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface in a weighted projective space $\\mathbb{P}^4(w_1, ..., w_5)$ is that the degree of its defining polynomial, $d$, equals the sum of the weights: $d = \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i$.\n*   **Input Data:**\n    *   Polynomial Equation: $P = z_1^8z_3+z_1^4z_2^3z_3+z_1z_2^7+z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5+z_2z_3^4+z_4^3z_5+z_5^3 = 0$.\n    *   Weights of the ambient space: $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$.\n\n**2. Analyze the Provided Polynomial and Formulate Assumptions**\n\nA crucial part of the setup is that the polynomial defining the hypersurface must be weighted-homogeneous. Let's check the degree of each monomial term using the given weights:\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^8z_3) = 8 \\cdot 22 + 49 = 176 + 49 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1^4z_2^3z_3) = 4 \\cdot 22 + 3 \\cdot 29 + 49 = 88 + 87 + 49 = 224$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2^7) = 1 \\cdot 22 + 7 \\cdot 29 = 22 + 203 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_1z_2z_3z_4z_5) = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_2z_3^4) = 1 \\cdot 29 + 4 \\cdot 49 = 29 + 196 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_4^3z_5) = 3 \\cdot 50 + 75 = 150 + 75 = 225$.\n*   $\\text{deg}(z_5^3) = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225$.\n\n**Careful Point:** The polynomial is not weighted-homogeneous because one term has a degree of 224, while all others have a degree of 225. This is almost certainly a typo in the problem statement. The specific coefficients and monomials of the polynomial do not enter the formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant. We will proceed by assuming that the problem intends to describe a Calabi-Yau link defined by *some* generic weighted-homogeneous polynomial with the given weights, leading to an isolated singularity.\n\n**3. Determine the Degree of the Hypersurface**\n\nAs stated, for a \"Calabi-Yau Link\", the degree $d$ must equal the sum of the weights.\n$d = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 + w_5$\n$d = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\nThis confirms that the degree of the (correct) homogeneous polynomial should be 225.\n\n**4. State the Formula for the Crawley-Nordström Invariant**\n\nFor the link $L$ of an isolated singularity defined by a weighted-homogeneous polynomial in $\\mathbb{C}^n$ with weights $(w_1, ..., w_n)$ and degree $d$, where the link is Calabi-Yau ($d = \\sum w_i$), the Crawley-Nordström invariant $CN(L)$ is given by the formula:\n$$ CN(L) = -\\frac{1}{24} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(d-w_i)(d-2w_i)}{w_i} $$\nIn our case, $n=5$, $d=225$, and the weights are given.\n\n**5. Calculate the Summation Term by Term**\n\nWe compute the value of $\\frac{(d-w_i)(d-2w_i)}{w_i}$ for each $i$:\n\n*   **For $i=1$ ($w_1 = 22$):**\n    $\\frac{(225-22)(225-2 \\cdot 22)}{22} = \\frac{203 \\cdot 181}{22} = \\frac{36743}{22}$\n\n*   **For $i=2$ ($w_2 = 29$):**\n    $\\frac{(225-29)(225-2 \\cdot 29)}{29} = \\frac{196 \\cdot 167}{29} = \\frac{32732}{29}$\n\n*   **For $i=3$ ($w_3 = 49$):**\n    $\\frac{(225-49)(225-2 \\cdot 49)}{49} = \\frac{176 \\cdot 127}{49} = \\frac{22352}{49}$\n\n*   **For $i=4$ ($w_4 = 50$):**\n    $\\frac{(225-50)(225-2 \\cdot 50)}{50} = \\frac{175 \\cdot 125}{50} = \\frac{21875}{50} = \\frac{875}{2}$\n\n*   **For $i=5$ ($w_5 = 75$):**\n    $\\frac{(225-75)(225-2 \\cdot 75)}{75} = \\frac{150 \\cdot 75}{75} = 150$\n\n**6. Calculate the Total Sum**\n\nNow we sum these five terms:\nSum = $\\frac{36743}{22} + \\frac{32732}{29} + \\frac{22352}{49} + \\frac{875}{2} + 150$\n\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is LCM(22, 29, 49, 2) = LCM($2 \\cdot 11$, 29, $7^2$, 2) = $2 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 29 = 31262$.\n\n*   $\\frac{36743 \\cdot 1421}{31262} = \\frac{52211803}{31262}$\n*   $\\frac{32732 \\cdot 1078}{31262} = \\frac{35285096}{31262}$\n*   $\\frac{22352 \\cdot 638}{31262} = \\frac{14258576}{31262}$\n*   $\\frac{875 \\cdot 15631}{31262} = \\frac{13677125}{31262}$\n*   $\\frac{150 \\cdot 31262}{31262} = \\frac{4689300}{31262}$\n\nSum of numerators:\n$52211803 + 35285096 + 14258576 + 13677125 + 4689300 = 120121900$\n\nSo, the total sum is $\\frac{120121900}{31262}$. This fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2:\nSum = $\\frac{60060950}{15631}$\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Invariant**\n\nNow, we substitute this sum back into the formula for the CN invariant:\n$CN(L) = -\\frac{1}{24} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{60060950}{15631} \\right)$\n$CN(L) = -\\frac{60060950}{24 \\cdot 15631} = -\\frac{60060950}{375144}$\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 2:\n$CN(L) = -\\frac{30030475}{187572}$\n\nThis fraction is irreducible, as the sum of digits of the numerator is 22 (not divisible by 3), while the denominator is divisible by 3 ($1+8+7+5+7+2 = 30$).\n\n<<<$- \\frac{30030475}{187572}$>>>"
