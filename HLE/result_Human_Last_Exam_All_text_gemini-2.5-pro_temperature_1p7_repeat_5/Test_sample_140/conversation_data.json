    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest number of 9 by 1 by 1 blocks that will fit inside a cube of edge length 15.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem and Initial Bounds**\n*   We need to fit rectangular blocks of size 9x1x1 into a larger cube of size 15x15x15.\n*   All placements must be within the confines of the 15x15x15 cube.\n*   We assume the blocks must be placed with their sides parallel to the sides of the cube (orthogonal packing).\n\n**2. Calculate the Theoretical Maximum (Volume Analysis)**\n*   **Volume of the large cube:** 15 * 15 * 15 = 3375 cubic units.\n*   **Volume of one block:** 9 * 1 * 1 = 9 cubic units.\n*   **Theoretical maximum number of blocks:** This is found by dividing the total volume of the cube by the volume of a single block.\n    *   Maximum = 3375 / 9 = 375 blocks.\n*   **Careful Point:** This number (375) is an absolute upper bound. It assumes that the blocks can be arranged to fill the entire volume of the cube with no wasted space. However, due to the geometric shapes, some space might be left empty, so the actual number could be less than 375.\n\n**3. Develop a Practical Packing Strategy**\nWe can try to fill the cube by systematically placing blocks in layers or sections, changing their orientation to use the space efficiently. A good strategy is to fill the cube in stages, dedicating sections of the cube to blocks of a specific orientation.\n\nLet the cube occupy the space from x=0 to 15, y=0 to 15, and z=0 to 15.\n\n*   **Stage 1: Orient blocks along the X-axis.**\n    *   Place blocks with their 9-unit length parallel to the X-axis.\n    *   Along the X-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   Along the Y-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   Along the Z-axis (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   This fills a region of size 9x15x15.\n    *   Number of blocks placed in this stage: 1 * 15 * 15 = **225 blocks**.\n    *   **Remaining Space:** After this, we have a leftover region of size (15-9) x 15 x 15, which is **6 x 15 x 15**.\n\n*   **Stage 2: Orient blocks along the Y-axis in the remaining space.**\n    *   Now we work with the remaining 6x15x15 space.\n    *   We orient new blocks with their 9-unit length parallel to the Y-axis.\n    *   Along the X-dimension (length 6), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the Y-dimension (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   Along the Z-dimension (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 1) = 15` blocks.\n    *   This fills a region of size 6x9x15 within the remaining space.\n    *   Number of blocks placed in this stage: 6 * 1 * 15 = **90 blocks**.\n    *   **Remaining Space:** The space left is now 6 x (15-9) x 15, which is **6 x 6 x 15**.\n\n*   **Stage 3: Orient blocks along the Z-axis in the remaining space.**\n    *   Now we work with the remaining 6x6x15 space.\n    *   We orient new blocks with their 9-unit length parallel to the Z-axis.\n    *   Along the X-dimension (length 6), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the Y-dimension (length 6), we can fit `floor(6 / 1) = 6` blocks.\n    *   Along the Z-dimension (length 15), we can fit `floor(15 / 9) = 1` block.\n    *   This fills a region of size 6x6x9.\n    *   Number of blocks placed in this stage: 6 * 6 * 1 = **36 blocks**.\n    *   **Remaining Space:** The final remaining space is 6 x 6 x (15-9), which is **6 x 6 x 6**.\n\n*   **Stage 4: Analyze the final remaining space.**\n    *   The leftover space is a 6x6x6 cube.\n    *   A 9x1x1 block cannot fit into this space, as its longest dimension (9) is greater than any dimension of the space (6).\n    *   Therefore, no more blocks can be placed.\n\n**4. Calculate the Final Answer**\nThe total number of blocks is the sum of the blocks placed in each stage.\n*   Total Blocks = 225 (Stage 1) + 90 (Stage 2) + 36 (Stage 3) = **351**.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\nThis constructive method shows that it is possible to fit 351 blocks. While this specific greedy strategy isn't universally guaranteed to be optimal for all packing problems, in this case, it leads to a wasted volume of 6x6x6 = 216 cubic units. This wasted space is completely inaccessible to the 9x1x1 blocks. It can be shown with more advanced methods (like coloring arguments) that this is indeed the maximum possible number."
