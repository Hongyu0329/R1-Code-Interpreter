    "Answering the user's request involves a multi-step process from polynomial factorization to Galois theory and group theory. Here is a detailed step-by-step analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Factor the polynomial\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe can try to find common factors by grouping terms:\n$f(x) = (x^7 - 2x^5) - (9x^3 - 18x) + (3x^2 - 6)$\n$f(x) = x^5(x^2 - 2) - 9x(x^2 - 2) + 3(x^2 - 2)$\nThis reveals a common factor of $(x^2 - 2)$:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\nLet $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$ and $h(x) = x^2 - 2$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the factors and their splitting fields\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the smallest field containing the roots of both $g(x)$ and $h(x)$. Let's analyze each factor over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **For $h(x) = x^2 - 2$:** This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$, or noting its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not rational). Its splitting field is $L_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This is a normal extension of degree $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. Its Galois group is $Gal(L_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$.\n*   **For $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:** We check for irreducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$:\n    *   3 divides the coefficients -9 and 3.\n    *   3 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\n    *   $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n    Thus, $g(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Galois group of $g(x)$\nTo determine the Galois group of $g(x)$, which we'll call $G_g$, we investigate its roots. Since $g(x)$ is an irreducible polynomial of degree 5, its Galois group $G_g$ is a transitive subgroup of $S_5$.\nLet's analyze the number of real roots of $g(x)$ using calculus.\n$g'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$. The critical points are at $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$.\n*   $g(-\\infty) \\to -\\infty$\n*   $g(\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = (9/5)^{5/4} - 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (9/5-9)(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (-36/5)(9/5)^{1/4} + 3$. Since $(9/5)^{1/4} > 1$, this value is negative.\n*   $g(-\\sqrt[4]{9/5}) = -(9/5)^{5/4} + 9(9/5)^{1/4} + 3 = (36/5)(9/5)^{1/4} + 3$. This value is positive.\n*   $g(+\\infty) \\to +\\infty$\nThe polynomial has a local maximum that is positive, and a local minimum that is negative. This means $g(x)$ has exactly three real roots and thus two complex conjugate roots.\nA known theorem states that if an irreducible polynomial of prime degree $p$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ has exactly $p-2$ real roots, its Galois group is the full symmetric group $S_p$.\nHere, $p=5$ and there are $3 = 5-2$ real roots. So, the Galois group of $g(x)$ is $G_g = Gal(M/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, where $M$ is the splitting field of $g(x)$. The degree of this extension is $[M:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Galois group of the full polynomial $f(x)$\nThe splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $M$ and $L_h = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, i.e., $K = M(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe Galois group $G = Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $Gal(M/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(L_h/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$.\nThe degree of the extension is given by $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [M:\\mathbb{Q}] [L_h:\\mathbb{Q}] / [M \\cap L_h : \\mathbb{Q}]$.\nWe need to determine the intersection $M \\cap L_h = M \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe subfields of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ are just $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ itself. So the intersection is either $\\mathbb{Q}$ or $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe field $M$ has a unique quadratic subfield, which is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$, where $\\Delta_g$ is the discriminant of $g(x)$. For a polynomial $x^5+ax+b$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 5^5 b^4 + 4^4 a^5$.\nFor $g(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$, we have $a=-9$ and $b=3$.\n$\\Delta_g = 5^5 (3^4) + 4^4 (-9)^5 = 3125 \\cdot 81 - 256 \\cdot 59049 = 253125 - 15116544 < 0$.\nSince the discriminant is negative, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$ is an imaginary quadratic field.\nOn the other hand, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is a real quadratic field.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. This implies that $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ is not a subfield of $M$.\nSo, $M \\cap \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong Gal(M/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times Gal(L_h/\\mathbb{Q})$.\nThus, $G \\cong S_5 \\times C_2$, and the degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [M:\\mathbb{Q}] \\cdot [L_h:\\mathbb{Q}] = 120 \\cdot 2 = 240$.\n\n### Step 5: Find the possible degrees of normal intermediate fields\nWe are looking for the possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$.\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, these fields $L$ correspond to normal subgroups $H$ of $G=Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ such that $\\{e\\} \\subsetneq H \\subsetneq G$.\nThe degree of the extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of the subgroup $H$ in $G$, i.e., $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [G:H] = |G|/|H|$.\nWe need to find all normal subgroups of $G = S_5 \\times C_2$. These are:\n1.  **Products of normal subgroups:** The normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}, A_5, S_5$. The normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}, C_2$. This gives rise to the following normal subgroups of $S_5 \\times C_2$:\n    *   $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times C_2$: $|H_1|=2$. $[G:H_1] = 240/2 = 120$. This corresponds to the field $M$.\n    *   $H_2 = A_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_2|=60$. $[G:H_2] = 240/60 = 4$. This corresponds to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$.\n    *   $H_3 = S_5 \\times \\{e\\}$: $|H_3|=120$. $[G:H_3] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   $H_4 = A_5 \\times C_2$: $|H_4|=120$. $[G:H_4] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta_g})$.\n    (The trivial group $\\{e\\}\\times\\{e\\}$ and the full group $S_5 \\times C_2$ correspond to $K$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$ respectively, which are excluded.)\n\n2.  **\"Diagonal\" subgroups:** These arise from isomorphisms between quotient groups of the factors. The non-trivial quotients of $S_5$ are $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/\\{e\\}\\cong S_5$. The only non-trivial quotient of $C_2$ is $C_2/\\{e\\}\\cong C_2$.\n    The only possible isomorphism is between $S_5/A_5$ and $C_2/\\{e\\}$. This gives rise to one more normal subgroup:\n    *   $H_5 = \\{(s,c) \\in S_5 \\times C_2 \\mid \\text{sgn}(s) = c \\}$, where we identify $C_2$ with $\\{1, -1\\}$ under multiplication and sgn(s) is the sign of the permutation $s$. This subgroup consists of pairs of (even perm., identity) and (odd perm., non-identity). Its order is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60+60=120$.\n    *   $|H_5|=120$. $[G:H_5] = 240/120 = 2$. This corresponds to the quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2\\Delta_g})$.\n\n### Step 6: Collect the possible degrees\nFrom the normal subgroups listed above, we find the possible degrees $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$:\n*   From $H_1$, the degree is 120.\n*   From $H_2$, the degree is 4.\n*   From $H_3, H_4, H_5$, the degree is 2.\n\nAll these fields are proper subfields of $K$ and properly contain $\\mathbb{Q}$. Thus, the set of all possible degrees for such normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $\\{2, 4, 120\\}$."
