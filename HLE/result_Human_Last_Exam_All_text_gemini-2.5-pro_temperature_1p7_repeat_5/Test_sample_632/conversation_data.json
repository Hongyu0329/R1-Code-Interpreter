    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify Key Information:**\n    *   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n    *   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon.\n    *   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n    *   **Action:** It was \"removed.\"\n    *   **Timeframe:** This happened *around 1950*.\n    *   **Agent:** The \"city administration\" was responsible for the removal.\n\n2.  **List Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls:**\n    *   **The Date is Crucial:** The year 1950 is very specific. Many famous changes to the Piazza della Rotonda happened at other times, so these must be ruled out.\n    *   **Avoid Common Misconceptions:**\n        *   The so-called \"donkey's ears\" (two bell towers by Bernini) were a famous architectural feature added to the Pantheon, but they were removed much earlier, around 1883.\n        *   The medieval houses and structures built directly against the Pantheon were cleared away to \"liberate\" the monument, but this happened primarily in the 1920s and 1930s.\n        *   The old fish market that dominated the square was also cleared in the late 19th century.\n    *   **Define \"Architectural Feature\":** This implies a physical structure, not just a use of the square (like a market) or paving. It could be a building, a monument, a shelter, or a similar construction.\n    *   **The Agent Matters:** \"Removed by the city administration\" suggests a planned urban renewal or beautification project, not destruction from war or natural decay.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Initial Investigation & Elimination:** We start by examining the well-known changes to the piazza. As noted in the careful points, the removal of the bell towers, adjacent houses, and the market all occurred at the wrong time (late 19th or early 20th century). Therefore, these cannot be the correct answer.\n\n2.  **Focusing on the 1950 Timeline:** We must search for a specific event that occurred around 1950. This period in post-war Rome was characterized by modernization, a focus on automobile traffic, and a renewed effort to improve the \"decorum\" of historical sites. A key change during this era was the phasing out of the tramway system in the historic center.\n\n3.  **Identifying the Specific Feature:** Research into the Piazza's history during this specific period reveals that a utilitarian structure had been built in the square in the early 20th century to serve the needs of the tram line that passed through. This structure was a **combined tramway shelter and public lavatory building** (known in Italy as an *albergo diurno*).\n\n4.  **Verification:** This feature perfectly matches all the clues in the question:\n    *   It was an **architectural feature** (a building/shelter).\n    *   It was located **in the Piazza della Rotonda**.\n    *   It was removed **around 1950** as part of the post-war cleanup and the decommissioning of the tram lines in the area.\n    *   The removal was an official act by the **city administration** to improve the aesthetic appearance of the historic square.\n\n<<<A combined tramway shelter and public lavatory building.>>>"
