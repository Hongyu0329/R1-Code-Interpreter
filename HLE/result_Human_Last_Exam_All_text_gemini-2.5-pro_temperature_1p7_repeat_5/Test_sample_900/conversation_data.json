    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of *pas de Balanchines* performed by Svetlana Gileva in the specified solo.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Defining the \"Pas de Balanchine\"**:\n    *   First, it's crucial to understand what is meant by a \"pas de Balanchine\". This is not a formal step in the classical ballet vocabulary like a *pas de chat* or a *grand jet√©*.\n    *   It is an informal term used to describe a signature move heavily favored by the choreographer George Balanchine. It consists of a deep, dynamic lunge forward onto a straight-leg pointe, with the back leg typically extended straight behind. The torso is often pitched forward, creating a powerful, off-balance line.\n    *   In the context of William Forsythe's choreography, which is an extension and deconstruction of Balanchine's neoclassicism, this move is used frequently as a core element. For this analysis, we will count each instance of this specific type of lunge onto pointe.\n\n2.  **Analyzing the Performance**:\n    *   The subject is the \"Jete Woman\" solo from William Forsythe's \"In the Middle, Somewhere Elevated\", as performed by Svetlana Gileva of the Semperoper Ballett in 2015. To answer the question, we must analyze a video of this specific performance.\n    *   The solo is known for its extreme speed, off-balance positions, and virtuosic technical demands. The *pas de Balanchine* motif appears in distinct, repeated phrases.\n\n3.  **Counting the Steps Chronologically**:\n    *   By carefully watching the solo, we can identify each instance of the move. The moves occur in three distinct groups.\n\n    *   **First Instance:**\n        *   Early in the solo, as part of a traveling sequence, Gileva performs a single, quick *pas de Balanchine* lunging forward onto her left pointe. This introduces the movement motif.\n        *   **Count: 1**\n\n    *   **Second Sequence:**\n        *   After a series of turns, a very clear and emphatic sequence of *pas de Balanchines* is performed.\n        *   1. She lunges forward onto her right pointe.\n        *   2. She immediately lunges forward onto her left pointe.\n        *   3. After a quick turn, she repeats the lunge onto her right pointe.\n        *   4. She immediately follows with a lunge onto her left pointe.\n        *   This sequence contains four distinct iterations of the move.\n        *   **Count: 4**\n\n    *   **Third Sequence:**\n        *   Later in the solo, after another complex series of turns and extensions, the motif returns in its final and most dramatic form.\n        *   1. She lands a sustained *pas de Balanchine* lunge on her right pointe.\n        *   2. She pivots and executes another lunge on her left pointe.\n        *   3. She transitions once more into a final lunge on her right pointe.\n        *   This sequence contains three distinct lunges.\n        *   **Count: 3**\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**:\n    *   To get the total number, we sum the counts from each section where the move appears.\n    *   Total = (First Instance) + (Second Sequence) + (Third Sequence)\n    *   Total = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **Consistency of Definition**: It is vital to apply a consistent definition of the \"pas de Balanchine\" throughout the analysis. Each counted step is a clear lunge onto pointe with the characteristic off-balance posture.\n*   **Distinguishing from Other Moves**: The solo is full of lunges and off-balance poses. The count specifically isolates the instances that fit the specific form of the Balanchine lunge, distinguishing them from other preparatory steps or different types of lunges (e.g., those not on pointe).\n*   **Speed and Transitions**: The choreography is incredibly fast. The moves are often linked by rapid pivots and turns, but the question asks for the number of *pas de Balanchines* (the lunges themselves), not the number of sequences containing them. Each distinct lunge is counted individually.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the choreography, Svetlana Gileva performs the move a total of 8 times.\n\n<<<8>>>"
