    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step reduction of the given SKI combinator expression. The key is to understand the structure of the expression and how its components operate on Church numerals.\n\n### Step 1: Define the basic combinators and their rules.\n\nThe SKI combinator system consists of three fundamental combinators:\n*   **S** (Successor/Applicator): `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   **K** (Constant/Kestrel): `K x y = x`\n*   **I** (Identity/Idiot bird): `I x = x`\n\nAll expressions in SKI logic are left-associative, meaning `a b c` is parsed as `((a b) c)`.\n\n### Step 2: Define Church Numerals and key arithmetic operations.\n\nChurch numerals represent natural numbers as higher-order functions. The Church numeral for `n`, denoted `C_n`, is a function that takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x` `n` times.\n`C_n = λf.λx. f^n(x)`\n\nSome important combinators and their representations or actions on Church numerals are:\n*   **B combinator (Composition)**: `B = S(K S)K`. It acts as `B f g x = f (g x)`.\n*   **Multiplication**: The multiplication of two Church numerals `C_a` and `C_b` can be implemented using the B combinator: `B C_a C_b` reduces to `C_{a*b}`.\n*   **Thrush combinator (Th)**: `Th = S I`. Its reduction rule is `Th f x = (S I f) x = I x (f x) = x (f x)`.\n*   **Church Numeral C_1**: `C_1 = λf.λx. f x`. In SKI, one common representation is `B I = S(S(KS)K) I`. Let's verify: `(B I) f x = I (f x) = f x`. This is correct.\n*   **Church Numeral C_2**: `C_2 = λf.λx. f (f x)`. In SKI, a compact form is `S I I`. Let's verify: `(S I I) f x = I f (I f) x = f (f x)`. This is correct.\n*   An important property of `C_1` is that when applied to any function `g`, it effectively returns `g`. `C_1 g = (λf.λx.f x) g = λx.g x`, which is equivalent to `g` by eta-reduction. This holds if `g` is a function. Church numerals are functions, so `C_1 C_k = C_k`.\n\n### Step 3: Deconstruct and analyze the given expression.\n\nThe given expression is `E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))`.\n\nLet's substitute the known combinators and numerals into the expression:\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the `B` combinator.\n*   `S(I)(I)` is `C_2`.\n*   `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `B I`, which is `C_1`.\n*   `S(I)` is the `Th` combinator.\n\nSo the expression `E` can be written as:\n`E = Th (Th (Th (K C_1)) (B C_2))`\n\nDue to left-associativity, this is parsed as:\n`E = ((Th Th) (Th (K C_1))) (B C_2)`\n\n### Step 4: Step-by-step reduction of the expression.\n\nLet's evaluate the components inside out.\n\n1.  Let `g = Th (K C_1)`. We will determine the action of this function `g`.\n    `g x = (Th (K C_1)) x = x ((K C_1) x) = x C_1`.\n    So, `g` is an operator that takes an argument `x` and applies `C_1` to its right.\n\n2.  Let `F = Th Th`. We will determine what this operator `F` does to a function (like `g`).\n    `F g x = (Th Th) g x = Th (Th g) x = x ((Th g) x)`.\n    Substituting the rule for `Th` again: `(Th g) x = x (g x)`.\n    So, `F g x = x (x (g x))`.\n    The operator `F` transforms a function `g` into a new function `λx. x(x(g x))`.\n\n3.  The expression is now `(F g) (B C_2)`. Let `H = F g`.\n    `H = λx. x(x(g x))`.\n    The final expression is `E = H (B C_2)`.\n\n4.  We apply `H` to the argument `B C_2` by substituting `B C_2` for `x`:\n    `E = (B C_2) ((B C_2) (g (B C_2)))`\n\n5.  Now we evaluate the innermost term, `g (B C_2)`. Using the definition of `g` from step 1:\n    `g (B C_2) = (B C_2) C_1`.\n\n6.  The term `(B C_2) C_1` is an application of the `B` combinator, which signifies multiplication of Church numerals.\n    `(B C_2) C_1 = B C_2 C_1 = C_{2*1} = C_2`.\n\n7.  Substitute this result back into the expression for `E`:\n    `E = (B C_2) ((B C_2) C_2)`\n\n8.  Evaluate the inner bracket `(B C_2) C_2`. This is another multiplication:\n    `B C_2 C_2 = C_{2*2} = C_4`.\n\n9.  Substitute this back into `E`:\n    `E = (B C_2) C_4`\n\n10. This final expression is one last multiplication:\n    `B C_2 C_4 = C_{2*4} = C_8`.\n\n### Step 5: Final calculation.\n\nThe SKI expression `E` reduces to the Church numeral `C_8`. Therefore, the integer `n` is 8.\nThe question asks for `log_2(n)`.\n`log_2(n) = log_2(8) = log_2(2^3) = 3`."
