    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the total memory used for its variables.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Problem\n\n1.  **Objective:** The goal is to perform a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length.\n2.  **Input:** Two lines of text, each containing one string.\n3.  **Constraints:**\n    *   The strings have the same length.\n    *   String length is between 1 and 100 characters, inclusive.\n    *   Strings consist only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.\n4.  **Output:**\n    *   \"-1\" if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   \"1\" if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   \"0\" if the strings are equal.\n5.  **Core Logic:** The comparison must be done character by character, from left to right. At the first position where the characters differ (after converting them to a common case, like lowercase), the comparison is decided. If no differences are found after checking all characters, the strings are equal.\n\n### Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **Case-Insensitivity:** The problem explicitly states that case does not matter. This means 'a' is equivalent to 'A'. Before comparing characters at any position, they must be converted to a consistent case (either both to lowercase or both to uppercase). The standard C library function `tolower()` from `<ctype.h>` is perfect for this.\n2.  **Memory Efficiency:** The prompt specifically asks for the *most memory-efficient* C program. This is a key constraint that guides the choice of implementation strategy. A naive approach might be acceptable for correctness but would fail the memory efficiency requirement if a more optimal solution exists.\n3.  **Input Method:** The way data is read from standard input can affect both correctness and memory usage. Standard C provides functions like `scanf`, `fgets`, and `getchar`. Reading character-by-character with `getchar()` generally offers the finest control and can help in minimizing memory, but it requires careful handling of whitespaces (like newlines) and the end-of-file (EOF) marker.\n4.  **Variable Allocation:** We must account for all memory allocated for variables. This primarily includes buffers for storing strings and any auxiliary variables like loop counters. In C, local variables are typically allocated on the stack. The size of standard types (`char`, `int`) is platform-dependent, but we can use common sizes (`sizeof(char)`=1 byte, `sizeof(int)`=4 bytes) typical for competitive programming environments.\n5.  **String Buffers:** The maximum string length is 100. To store a string of length 100 in C, a character array of size 101 is needed to accommodate the null terminator (`\\0`).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n#### Analysis of a Standard (Less Memory-Efficient) Approach\n\nA straightforward solution would be to declare two character arrays, read both strings into them, and then loop through the arrays to compare characters.\n\n*   `char str1[101];` // 101 bytes\n*   `char str2[101];` // 101 bytes\n*   `scanf(\"%s %s\", str1, str2);` // Read both strings\n*   Loop with an index `int i;` (4 bytes) to compare `tolower(str1[i])` and `tolower(str2[i])`.\n\nThe memory for variables in this approach would be `sizeof(str1) + sizeof(str2) + sizeof(i)` = `101 + 101 + 4` = **206 bytes**.\n\n#### Analysis of the Most Memory-Efficient Approach\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we must avoid storing both strings in memory if possible. The input is a stream; we read the first string, then the second. This means we cannot access characters from both strings simultaneously without storing at least one of them. Therefore, the minimum possible memory usage involves storing only one string and processing the second one as a stream.\n\n**The Strategy:**\n1.  Allocate a buffer for the first string.\n2.  Read the first string into this buffer.\n3.  Read the second string one character at a time from the input stream.\n4.  As each character of the second string is read, compare it with the corresponding character from the stored first string.\n5.  Stop at the first difference or at the end of the strings.\n\n**Implementation and Memory Calculation:**\nThis strategy can be implemented by reading character-by-character using `getchar()`.\n\nThe variables required are:\n1.  **A buffer for the first string:** Since the max length is 100, we need a buffer of size 101.\n    `char str1[101];`\n    Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = **101 bytes**.\n2.  **A loop counter/index:** This will be used to access characters in `str1`.\n    `int i;`\n    Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n3.  **A variable to hold characters from the second string:** We'll read the second string using `getchar()`, which returns an `int` to handle the special `EOF` value.\n    `int ch2;`\n    Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\nNo other variables are strictly necessary in the main scope of the program. Any temporary variables within a loop are transient and might be optimized into registers by the compiler, but even if placed on the stack, the primary storage cost comes from the items listed above. Let's count only the variables declared in the function's main scope.\n\n**Total Memory Calculation (m):**\nm = (memory for first string's buffer) + (memory for index) + (memory for second string's character)\nm = `sizeof(str1)` + `sizeof(i)` + `sizeof(ch2)`\nm = 101 bytes + 4 bytes + 4 bytes\nm = **109 bytes**\n\nThis is a significant improvement over the 206 bytes required by the two-buffer approach and represents the most memory-efficient solution possible given the problem constraints and standard I/O methods.\n\n<<<109>>>"
