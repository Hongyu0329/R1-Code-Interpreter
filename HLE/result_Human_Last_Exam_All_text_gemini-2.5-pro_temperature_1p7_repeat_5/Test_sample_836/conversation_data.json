    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Function:** The question starts with the \"generalized pair correlation function\". In the context of nuclear criticality, this function, let's call it `G(r, t; r', t')`, describes the correlation in the neutron population between two distinct space-time points. Specifically, it relates the probability of finding a neutron at position **r** at time `t` to the presence of another neutron at position **r'** at an earlier time `t'`. This function is fundamental to the study of neutron population fluctuations, which is the basis of \"reactor noise analysis\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Mathematical Operation:** The question specifies a \"space-time, double Fourier transform\". This means transforming the function from its dependency on space and time coordinates to a dependency on wave vector and frequency.\n    *   **Time Transform:** The correlation is typically considered as a function of the time lag, `τ = t - t'`. A Fourier transform with respect to this time lag `τ` converts the function from the time domain to the angular frequency domain (`ω`).\n    *   **Space Transform:** The correlation depends on two spatial points, **r** and **r'**. A spatial Fourier transform converts these position variables into wave vector (or momentum) variables, **k** and **k'**. In many theoretical treatments (e.g., for an infinite homogeneous medium), the transform is performed on the separation vector **ρ** = **r** - **r'**, resulting in a single wave vector **k**.\n\n3.  **Relate the Operation to a Physical Concept (The Wiener-Khinchin Theorem):** In signal processing and statistical physics, the Wiener-Khinchin theorem establishes a crucial relationship: the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function of a wide-sense-stationary random process is its **power spectral density**. This theorem can be generalized to cross-correlation functions. The Fourier transform of a cross-correlation function between two signals yields the **cross-power spectral density (CPSD)**.\n\n4.  **Apply the Concept to the Nuclear Criticality Context:**\n    *   The \"generalized pair correlation function\" is a form of a two-point, two-time cross-correlation function for the neutron density field.\n    *   Applying a Fourier transform with respect to the time variable directly leads to a spectral density, according to the Wiener-Khinchin theorem.\n    *   Because the original function correlates *two different points* (a pair), the resulting spectral density is a **cross-power** spectral density. It describes how the power of the neutron fluctuations is distributed over frequency and how this power is correlated between two points in space.\n    *   The additional spatial Fourier transform moves this CPSD from real space (`r, r'`) to wave vector space (`k, k'`), giving a modal representation. However, the fundamental name of the quantity remains tied to its nature as a spectral density of power.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Pair vs. Single Point:** The term \"pair correlation\" is key. If it were a single-point correlation (an auto-correlation), the answer would be the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD). Because it's a pair, the more general and correct term is Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD).\n*   **Common Usage:** The question asks what the function is \"commonly called\". In the nuclear criticality and reactor physics community, the term \"Cross-Power Spectral Density\" and its acronym \"CPSD\" are universally used to describe the frequency-domain representation of the two-point neutron correlation. Experimental techniques (like two-detector noise measurements) directly measure the CPSD.\n*   **Theoretical vs. Experimental:** While theoretical physicists might work with the fully transformed quantity in wave-vector space `S(k, k', ω)`, the common name for the concept as a whole, bridging theory and experiment, is the Cross-Power Spectral Density.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function for neutrons in a multiplying medium is the physical quantity that describes the correlated power of the neutron population fluctuations as a function of frequency and spatial mode. The standard and most common name for this in the nuclear criticality community is the Cross-Power Spectral Density.\n\n<<<Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD)>>>"
