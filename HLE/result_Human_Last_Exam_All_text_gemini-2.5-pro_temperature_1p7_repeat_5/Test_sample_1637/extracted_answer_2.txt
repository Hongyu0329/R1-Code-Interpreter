Yes. The precipitation is caused by the low aqueous solubility of the probe, which possesses two large hydrophobic parts: the planar thioxanthenone core and the long chlorohexyl tail. Replacing a hydrophobic part of the molecule with a hydrophilic Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) chain is a standard and highly effective method (known as PEGylation) to increase the water solubility of organic molecules. The PEG chain's repeating ether units form hydrogen bonds with water, masking the hydrophobic regions and preventing aggregation. This modification would almost certainly increase the probe's solubility limit above 100 uM, thus solving the precipitation problem in the cell culture medium.
