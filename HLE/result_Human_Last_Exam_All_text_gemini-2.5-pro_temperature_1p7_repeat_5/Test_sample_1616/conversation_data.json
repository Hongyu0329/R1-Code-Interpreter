    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**1. Understand the Linguistic Rule: Trisyllabic Laxing**\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change in the English language. It has two main conditions:\n*   **The Vowel:** A long vowel or tense vowel (like the \"i\" in *divine* or the \"a\" in *sane*) is shortened or becomes lax.\n*   **The Position:** This shortening happens when the vowel is in the antepenultimate syllable, which means the third syllable from the end of a word. This rule, therefore, only applies to words with three or more syllables.\n\n**2. Analyze Each Word Against the Rule**\n\nWe will examine each word to see if it meets the criteria for having undergone trisyllabic laxing. This means we look for a related word with a long/tense vowel and see if it became short/lax in the antepenultimate syllable of the target word.\n\n*   **southern**\n    *   **Base Word:** *south*. The vowel sound is /aʊ/, a diphthong which acts as a long vowel.\n    *   **Target Word:** *southern* (/ˈsʌðərn/). It has two syllables (*south-ern*). The vowel has shortened from /aʊ/ to /ʌ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** Although the vowel has shortened, the word *southern* has only two syllables. Trisyllabic laxing specifically applies to words of three or more syllables. Therefore, *southern* has undergone vowel shortening, but not specifically *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n*   **derivative**\n    *   **Base Word:** *derive* (/dɪˈraɪv/). The vowel in the stressed syllable is the long diphthong /aɪ/.\n    *   **Target Word:** *derivative* (/dəˈrɪvətɪv/). It has four syllables (*de-riv-a-tive*).\n    *   **Analysis:** The original long vowel /aɪ/ from *derive* is now in the antepenultimate (third-from-end) syllable. It has shortened to the lax vowel /ɪ/. This is a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **serenity**\n    *   **Base Word:** *serene* (/səˈriːn/). The vowel in the stressed syllable is the long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Target Word:** *serenity* (/səˈrɛnəti/). It has four syllables (*se-ren-i-ty*).\n    *   **Analysis:** The original long vowel /iː/ from *serene* is now in the antepenultimate syllable. It has shortened to the lax vowel /ɛ/. This is also a textbook example of trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **pleasant**\n    *   **Base Word:** *please* (/pliːz/). The vowel is the long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Target Word:** *pleasant* (/ˈplɛzənt/). It has two syllables (*pleas-ant*). The vowel has shortened from /iː/ to /ɛ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** Like *southern*, the vowel has shortened, but the word is disyllabic (two syllables). Therefore, it has not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.\n\n*   **gratitude**\n    *   **Related Words:** *grateful* (/ˈɡreɪtfʊl/), *grate*. The vowel sound is the long diphthong /eɪ/.\n    *   **Target Word:** *gratitude* (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/). It has three syllables (*grat-i-tude*).\n    *   **Analysis:** The vowel in the first syllable, which is the antepenultimate syllable, is the short/lax vowel /æ/. This contrasts with the long /eɪ/ in related words. The word meets both conditions for trisyllabic laxing.\n\n*   **shadow**\n    *   **Etymology:** The word comes from Old English *sceadu*, where the first vowel sound 'æ' (/æ/) was already short.\n    *   **Target Word:** *shadow* (/ˈʃædoʊ/). It has two syllables (*shad-ow*).\n    *   **Analysis:** This word fails on two counts. First, it only has two syllables, so the \"trisyllabic\" rule cannot apply. Second, and more fundamentally, the vowel in its historical root was already short. There was never a long vowel to be shortened (or \"laxed\"). Therefore, it could not have undergone this sound change.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\n*   **Have undergone trisyllabic laxing:** *derivative*, *serenity*, *gratitude*.\n*   **Have undergone a different shortening (not trisyllabic):** *southern*, *pleasant*.\n*   **Has undergone no shortening and is not trisyllabic:** *shadow*.\n\nThe question asks which word has **not** undergone trisyllabic laxing. While *southern* and *pleasant* technically fit this description because they are disyllabic, *shadow* is the strongest answer. It not only fails the syllable count condition but also the primary condition of having a long vowel in its etymology that could be shortened. It has not undergone any such process at all.\n\n<<<shadow>>>"
