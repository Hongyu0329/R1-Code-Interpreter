    "This problem asks for the number of non-zero coefficients for terms of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion for $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) Formula:**\n    The BCH formula expresses $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ as an infinite series of nested commutators of $X$ and $Y$.\n    $Z = Z_1 + Z_2 + Z_3 + \\dots + Z_n + \\dots$\n    where $Z_n$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in $X$ and $Y$. The \"order\" of a term is its degree. We are interested in the terms of order 10, i.e., $Z_{10}$.\n\n2.  **Relate BCH terms to Free Lie Algebras:**\n    The terms in the BCH expansion are elements of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, $X$ and $Y$, denoted as $L(X,Y)$. The terms of order $n$ form a basis for the degree-$n$ homogeneous subspace of this Lie algebra. A crucial result in Lie theory states that the BCH expansion for $\\log(e^X e^Y)$ contains a non-zero coefficient for every basis element of the free Lie algebra $L(X,Y)$. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order $n$ is equal to the dimension of the degree-$n$ subspace of $L(X,Y)$.\n\n3.  **Use Witt's Formula to find the Dimension:**\n    The dimension of the degree-$n$ homogeneous subspace of a free Lie algebra on $k$ generators, denoted $l_k(n)$, can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n    $l_k(n) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\n    where:\n    *   $n$ is the degree (order), which is 10 in this problem.\n    *   $k$ is the number of generators, which is 2 (for $X$ and $Y$).\n    *   The sum is over all positive divisors $d$ of $n$.\n    *   $\\mu(d)$ is the Möbius function.\n\n4.  **List Careful Points for Calculation:**\n    *   **Identify parameters:** $n = 10$, $k = 2$.\n    *   **Find all divisors of n=10:** The divisors are $d = \\{1, 2, 5, 10\\}$.\n    *   **Calculate Möbius function $\\mu(d)$ for each divisor:**\n        *   $\\mu(1) = 1$ (by definition).\n        *   $\\mu(2) = -1$ (2 is a prime, so it has 1 distinct prime factor, which is an odd number).\n        *   $\\mu(5) = -1$ (5 is a prime, so it has 1 distinct prime factor, which is an odd number).\n        *   $\\mu(10) = \\mu(2 \\cdot 5) = (-1)^2 = 1$ (10 is a product of 2 distinct primes, which is an even number).\n    *   **Carefully substitute these values into Witt's formula.**\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\nNow we apply Witt's formula with the values identified above.\n\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d \\in \\{1,2,5,10\\}} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n\nLet's expand the sum term by term:\n\n*   **For d=1:** $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = (1) \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n*   **For d=2:** $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{5} = -32$\n*   **For d=5:** $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = (-1) \\cdot 2^{2} = -4$\n*   **For d=10:** $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = (1) \\cdot 2^{1} = 2$\n\nNow, sum these values and divide by $n=10$:\n\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2]$\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} [1024 - 32 - 4 + 2]$\n$l_2(10) = \\frac{1}{10} [990]$\n$l_2(10) = 99$\n\nThus, there are 99 linearly independent basis elements of order 10 in the free Lie algebra on two generators. Since each of these corresponds to a term with a non-zero coefficient in the BCH expansion, the number of non-zero coefficients of order 10 is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
