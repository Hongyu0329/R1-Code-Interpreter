    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function matrix $H(s)$. This means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n3.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular matrix (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero).\n\nThe relation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$ can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Our task is to find a suitable polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that the product $D(s)H(s)$ results in a polynomial matrix $N(s)$, while also satisfying the coprimality condition.\n\n**2. Set up the Equations**\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. The equation $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$ becomes:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, each of its entries must be a polynomial.\n\n**3. Analyze the Rows of D(s)**\n\nLet's analyze the conditions on the first row of $D(s)$, which we denote as $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)]$. Multiplying this row by the columns of $H(s)$ gives the first row of $N(s)$:\n-   $n_{11}(s) = d_{11}(s) \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s) \\frac{2}{s^2-1}$\n-   $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) \\cdot 1 + d_{12}(s) \\cdot 0 = d_{11}(s)$\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For $n_{12}(s)$ to be a polynomial, $d_{11}(s)$ must be a polynomial.\n\nNow, let's make $n_{11}(s)$ a polynomial. We combine the terms over the least common denominator, which is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$:\n\\[\nn_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{(s-1)(s+1)}\n\\]\n**Careful Point 2:** For $n_{11}(s)$ to be a polynomial, the numerator must be divisible by both $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$. This means the numerator must be zero when evaluated at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n-   **Condition at s=1:** The numerator evaluated at $s=1$ is $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 2d_{12}(1)$. For this to be zero, we must have $d_{12}(1)=0$. This implies $d_{12}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n-   **Condition at s=-1:** The numerator evaluated at $s=-1$ is $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1)$. For this to be zero, we must have $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n\nWe need to find two linearly independent polynomial row vectors $[d_{ij}(s)]$ that satisfy these two conditions.\n\n**4. Construct the D(s) Matrix**\n\nLet's find the simplest non-trivial polynomial vectors satisfying the conditions.\n\n**For the first row, $[d_{11}(s) \\quad d_{12}(s)]$:**\n-   Try with low-degree polynomials. Let $d_{11}(s)$ be a constant, say $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n-   The second condition becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1)=-2$.\n-   The first condition is $d_{12}(1)=0$.\n-   We need a simple polynomial $d_{12}(s)$ such that $d_{12}(1)=0$ and $d_{12}(-1)=-2$. Let's try a linear polynomial $d_{12}(s) = as+b$.\n    -   $a(1)+b = 0 \\implies a+b=0$\n    -   $a(-1)+b = -2 \\implies -a+b=-2$\n    -   Adding the two equations: $2b = -2 \\implies b=-1$. Then $a=1$.\n-   So, a possible choice is $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n-   Let's check our choice: $[d_{11}(s) \\ d_{12}(s)] = [1 \\quad s-1]$.\n    -   $d_{12}(1) = 1-1=0$. (Correct)\n    -   $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 2(1) + (-1-1) = 2-2=0$. (Correct)\nSo, the first row of $D(s)$ can be $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\n\n**For the second row, $[d_{21}(s) \\quad d_{22}(s)]$:**\nThe same conditions must apply to this row. We need to find another solution that is linearly independent from the first row.\n-   Let's try $d_{21}(s)=s$.\n-   The second condition is $2d_{21}(-1)+d_{22}(-1)=0 \\implies 2(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=2$.\n-   The first condition is $d_{22}(1)=0$.\n-   We need a polynomial $d_{22}(s)$ with $d_{22}(1)=0$ and $d_{22}(-1)=2$. Let $d_{22}(s) = as+b$.\n    -   $a(1)+b=0 \\implies a+b=0$\n    -   $a(-1)+b=2 \\implies -a+b=2$\n    -   Adding them: $2b=2 \\implies b=1$. Then $a=-1$.\n-   So, a possible choice is $d_{22}(s) = -s+1 = -(s-1)$.\n-   Let's check our choice: $[d_{21}(s) \\ d_{22}(s)] = [s \\quad -(s-1)]$. This vector is linearly independent of $[1 \\quad s-1]$.\nThus, we can construct our candidate $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n**Careful Point 3:** We must ensure $D(s)$ is non-singular. $\\det(D(s)) = (1)(-(s-1)) - (s-1)(s) = -(s-1) - s(s-1) = (-1-s)(s-1) = -(s+1)(s-1) = 1-s^2$. Since the determinant is not identically zero, $D(s)$ is non-singular.\n\n**5. Calculate the N(s) Matrix**\nNow we calculate $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n-   $n_{11}(s) = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right) + (s-1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1+2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$.\n-   $n_{12}(s) = 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 = 1$.\n-   $n_{21}(s) = s \\cdot \\left(\\frac{s-1}{s+1}\\right) - (s-1) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{s^2-1}\\right) = \\frac{s(s-1)}{s+1} - \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s^2-s-2}{s+1} = \\frac{(s-2)(s+1)}{s+1} = s-2$.\n-   $n_{22}(s) = s \\cdot 1 - (s-1) \\cdot 0 = s$.\n\nSo, the resulting $N(s)$ matrix is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n**6. Verify Coprimality**\n\n**Careful Point 4:** We must check that $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This is true if the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank (rank 2) for all complex numbers $s$. We only need to check this at the roots of $\\det(D(s))=1-s^2$, which are $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\nThe augmented matrix is:\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) & s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n-   **Check at s=1:**\n    \\[\n    [D(1) \\quad N(1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1-2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    The rows are $[1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 1]$ and $[1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 1]$. They are not multiples of each other, so they are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n-   **Check at s=-1:**\n    \\[\n    [D(-1) \\quad N(-1)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & -(-2) & -1-2 & -1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -2 & 1 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 2 & -3 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}\n    \\]\n    If the second row were a multiple $c$ of the first, we would have $-1 = c \\cdot 1 \\implies c=-1$. But $-1 \\times [1 \\ -2 \\ 1 \\ 1] = [-1 \\ 2 \\ -1 \\ -1]$, which is not equal to the second row (the third element differs). The rows are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\nSince the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ is 2 for all problematic values of $s$, the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & -(s-1) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ s & 1-s \\end{bmatrix}$, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ s-2 & s \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
