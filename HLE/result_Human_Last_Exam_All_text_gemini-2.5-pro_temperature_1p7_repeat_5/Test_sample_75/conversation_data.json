    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Scope of the Second Great War:** The Second Great War refers to the entire conflict depicted in the *StarCraft II* trilogy. This includes the events of *Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*, including the final epilogue campaign, *Into the Void*.\n\n2.  **Identify the Starting Point:** The war officially begins with the renewed Zerg invasion of the Koprulu Sector, specifically their attack on the Terran world of Mar Sara. This marks the opening cinematic and first mission of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*. According to the official StarCraft timeline, this event occurs in the year **2504**.\n\n3.  **Identify the Ending Point:** The war concludes with the final, permanent defeat of the dark god Amon. This happens when the combined forces of the Terran, Zerg, and Protoss venture into the Void to destroy Amon's consciousness. This is the final mission of the *Into the Void* epilogue. This event takes place in the year **2506**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Timeline of Events:**\n    *   **Year 2504:** This year contains the entirety of the *Wings of Liberty* and *Heart of the Swarm* campaigns. These campaigns, while epic, happen in relatively quick succession over a period of several months. The year ends with Sarah Kerrigan having defeated Arcturus Mengsk and resumed full control of the Zerg Swarm.\n    *   **Gap between *Heart of the Swarm* and *Legacy of the Void*:** There is a significant time jump between the end of Kerrigan's campaign and the beginning of Artanis's. Developer commentary and lore sources indicate that approximately **one year** passes during which Kerrigan is absent and Artanis prepares the Golden Armada.\n    *   **Year 2505:** *Legacy of the Void* begins. Artanis leads the invasion to reclaim the Protoss homeworld of Aiur, only for Amon to corrupt the Khala and seize control of the majority of the Protoss race. This part of the conflict begins in 2505.\n    *   **Year 2506:** The latter half of the *Legacy of the Void* campaign and the entire *Into the Void* epilogue take place. The Protoss successfully reclaim Aiur, and the allied factions launch their final assault on Amon in the Void, ending the war.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total Duration:**\n    *   The war starts in 2504.\n    *   There is a period of conflict in 2504 (WoL, HotS).\n    *   There is a gap of approximately one year.\n    *   There is another period of conflict that starts in 2505 and ends in 2506 (LotV, Epilogue).\n    *   Therefore, the total elapsed time is the sum of these periods: (Duration of WoL/HotS) + (~1 Year Gap) + (Duration of LotV/Epilogue).\n    *   Let's estimate: A few months for the 2504 campaigns + ~12 months for the gap + another several months for the 2505-2506 campaigns.\n    *   This adds up to a duration that is clearly **greater than 2 years**. A reasonable estimate is around 2.5 years.\n\n6.  **Apply the Rounding Rule:** The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   Since our calculated duration is a value greater than 2 (e.g., 2.5 years), we must round it up to the next whole number.\n    *   Ceiling(2.5) = 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Start/End Years vs. Duration:** The war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506. Simply subtracting (2506 - 2504 = 2) is inaccurate because it doesn't account for the actual time elapsed within those years or the explicit one-year gap mentioned in the lore.\n*   **The \"Rounded Up\" Clause:** This is a critical instruction. Any duration that is even slightly over a whole number must be rounded up to the next integer. A duration of 2.1 years becomes 3, for example.\n*   **Timeline Sources:** The analysis relies on the in-game calendar, official timelines provided by Blizzard, and developer interviews that clarify narrative gaps. These sources confirm the war spans three calendar years and includes a significant time jump of about a year, pushing the total duration over the 2-year mark.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\n\nThe war began in 2504 and ended in 2506. The total elapsed time, including campaigns and a narrative time jump of about a year, is approximately 2.5 years. When this duration is rounded up to the nearest whole number as requested, the answer is 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
