    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the phonological development of the Proto-Indo-European verb *seh₂g-ie/o-ti*.\n\n**1. Analyze the Starting Point: Proto-Indo-European (PIE)**\n\n*   **Verb:** *seh₂g-ie/o-ti*, meaning '(s)he’s giving a sign'.\n*   **Root:** *seh₂g-*\n*   **Key Phonemes:**\n    *   *s*: Voiceless alveolar sibilant.\n    *   *eh₂*: The vowel *e* followed by the \"a-coloring\" laryngeal *h₂*. This combination typically develops into a long low/back vowel.\n    *   *g*: Voiced velar stop.\n*   The form given is the 3rd person singular present indicative. For tracing cognates, it is more standard to use the root or the reconstructed infinitive of the verb in its descendant language, Proto-Germanic.\n\n**2. Step 1: Development into Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nThe verb becomes a Class 1 weak verb in Germanic. We reconstruct the infinitive form, **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n*   **Initial *s***: PIE *s* remains *s* in PGmc.\n    *   *s...* > *s...*\n*   **Vowel and Laryngeal *eh₂***: The sequence *eh₂* becomes a long low back vowel in late PIE, phonetically [*aː*]. In Proto-Germanic, PIE *ā* and *ō* merge into **\\*ō**.\n    *   *seh₂...* > *sō...*\n*   **Velar Stop *g***: According to **Grimm's Law**, PIE voiced stops become voiceless stops in PGmc.\n    *   *g* > **\\*k**\n*   **Combining the Root Changes**: The PIE root *seh₂g-* becomes the PGmc root **\\*sōk-**.\n*   **Suffix and Verb Class**: The verb develops as a Class 1 weak verb, which is formed with the suffix **\\*-janą** (infinitive). This suffix is derived from the PIE *-ie/o-* present suffix.\n*   **Final PGmc Form**: Combining the root *sōk-* with the suffix *-janą* gives the PGmc infinitive **\\*sōkijaną**, meaning 'to look for a sign, to seek'.\n\n**3. Step 2: Development into Old Norse (ON)**\n\nWe start from the Proto-Germanic form **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n*   **Vowel Change (i-umlaut)**: The *i*/*j* in the suffix *-ijaną* causes the preceding back vowel *ō* in the root to be fronted. This process is called i-umlaut or i-mutation. The fronted equivalent of *ō* ([oː]) in Old Norse is **\\*ø̄** ([øː]).\n    *   *sōk-* + i-umlaut > *sø̄k-*\n*   **Consonants**: The *s* and *k* remain unchanged in this position.\n*   **Ending**: The PGmc infinitive ending *-aną* is reduced. The medial *j* is retained after a consonant, and the final ending becomes **-a**.\n*   **Final ON Form**: Putting the parts together, we get **søkja** (also written *sœkja* or *sǿkja*).\n\n**4. Step 3: Development into Old English (OE)**\n\nWe start from the Proto-Germanic form **\\*sōkijaną**.\n\n*   **Vowel Change (i-umlaut)**: As in Old Norse, the *i*/*j* in the suffix causes i-umlaut of the root vowel *ō*. In Old English, *ō* fronts to **\\*ē** ([eː]).\n    *   *sōk-* + i-umlaut > *sēk-*\n*   **Consonant Change (Palatalization)**: The velar consonant *k* is followed by the front glide *j*. This environment causes the *k* to become palatalized into a voiceless postalveolar affricate, /tʃ/. This sound is written as **ċ** in Old English.\n    *   *-k-* before *j* > *-ċ-* (/tʃ/)\n*   **Ending**: The *j* from the suffix is absorbed into the palatalization of the preceding consonant and disappears as a separate sound. The infinitive ending *-aną* becomes **-an** in Old English.\n*   **Final OE Form**: The combination of these changes gives **sēċan**.\n\n**5. Step 4: Development into Old High German (OHG)**\n\nWe start from the Proto-Germanic form **\\*sōkijaną**. This development is more complex due to the High German Consonant Shift.\n\n*   **Vowel Change (Diphthongization)**: In Old High German, the long vowel PGmc *ō* diphthongizes to **uo**.\n    *   *sōk-* > *suok-*\n*   **Consonant Change (High German Consonant Shift)**: This is the most complex point. The PGmc sequence *-kj-* has a special development in OHG that depends on the length of the preceding vowel.\n    *   **Careful Point**: After a *short* vowel, PGmc *-kj-* first geminates to *-kkj-* in West Germanic, and this *-kk-* shifts to the affricate *-cch-* (or *-ck-*) in OHG (e.g., PGmc *wakjaną* > OHG *wecken* 'to waken').\n    *   However, after a *long* vowel (or the resulting diphthong), the PGmc sequence *-kj-* becomes a long voiceless fricative **-hh-** /xx/ in OHG.\n    *   Therefore, *...ōkij...* > *...uohh...*\n*   **Ending**: The *j* is lost, having been absorbed into the consonant shift. The infinitive ending *-aną* reduces to **-en**. Although the *j* caused the consonant change, it also phonetically conditioned i-umlaut on the *uo* diphthong (to [yø]), but this was not consistently represented in OHG spelling, which often retained **uo**.\n*   **Final OHG Form**: Combining the changes, *s-* + *uo* + *-hh-* + *-en* results in the attested form **suohhen**.\n\n***\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** \\*sōkijaną\n*   **Old Norse:** søkja\n*   **Old English:** sēċan\n*   **Old High German:** suohhen\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną*; Old Norse: søkja; Old English: sēċan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
