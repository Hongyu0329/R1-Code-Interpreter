    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space $X$**: A finite set $X$ with a distance function $d(x,y)$ satisfying:\n    1.  $d(x,y) \\ge 0$, and $d(x,y) = 0 \\iff x=y$.\n    2.  $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$ (symmetry).\n    3.  $d(x,z) \\le \\max(d(x,y), d(y,z))$ (the ultrametric or strong triangle inequality).\n*   **Banach Space $B$**: A complete normed vector space over a field (usually $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$). Its distance function is given by $d_B(u,v) = \\|u-v\\|$. The cardinality of $B$ is given as $K$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ that preserves distances, i.e., for all $x,y \\in X$, $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the question**\nThe question asks for the \"smallest possible number\" of such embeddings. This means we are free to choose the finite ultrametric space $X$ and the Banach space $B$ (of some cardinality $K$) in order to make the number of embeddings as small as possible. Let this number be $N(X,B)$. We want to find $\\min_{X,B} N(X,B)$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the number of embeddings in a general case**\nLet's assume that for a given pair $(X,B)$, at least one isometric embedding exists. Let this embedding be $f: X \\to B$.\n\nConsider the structure of the Banach space $B$. For any vector $b_0 \\in B$, we can define a new function $f_{b_0}: X \\to B$ by translating the image of $f$:\n$f_{b_0}(x) = f(x) + b_0$.\n\nLet's check if $f_{b_0}$ is also an isometric embedding:\n$\\|f_{b_0}(x) - f_{b_0}(y)\\| = \\|(f(x) + b_0) - (f(y) + b_0)\\| = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$.\nThe condition is satisfied. So, for every vector $b_0 \\in B$, we get a new isometric embedding $f_{b_0}$.\n\nIf $b_0 \\ne b_1$, then $f_{b_0} \\ne f_{b_1}$ (unless $|X|=0$, which is not a space, or $|X|=1$ and $f(x_1)+b_0 = f(x_1)+b_1$ implies $b_0=b_1$). This means that the number of isometric embeddings is at least the cardinality of the Banach space $B$, which is $K$.\n\n**Step 4: Consider the cardinality $K$ of the Banach space $B$**\nA Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ can be classified by its cardinality:\n1.  **The trivial Banach space**: $B = \\{0\\}$. It consists of only the zero vector. Its norm is $\\|0\\|=0$. It is complete. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n2.  **Any non-trivial Banach space**: If $B$ contains even one non-zero vector $v$, it must contain the entire line $\\{\\lambda v \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$, so its cardinality $K$ is at least $c = |\\mathbb{R}|$ (the cardinality of the continuum).\n\nThis leads to two scenarios for the number of embeddings, $N(X,B)$:\n\n*   **Scenario A: $B$ is non-trivial.**\n    In this case, $|B|=K$ is infinite. As shown in Step 3, if an embedding exists, there are at least $K$ embeddings. The number of embeddings is infinite.\n\n*   **Scenario B: $B$ is the trivial space, $B = \\{0\\}$.**\n    In this case, $K=1$. The number of embeddings might be small and finite. Let's explore this. For an embedding $f:X \\to \\{0\\}$ to exist, it must be the constant map $f(x)=0$ for all $x \\in X$. The condition for this to be an isometric embedding is:\n    $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in X$.\n    Substituting $f(x)=f(y)=0$, we get $\\|0 - 0\\| = d(x,y)$, which simplifies to $0 = d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in X$.\n    The properties of a metric space dictate that $d(x,y)=0$ if and only if $x=y$. For this to hold for all pairs in $X$, it must be that $X$ contains only one point.\n\n**Step 5: Find the minimal number by choosing specific $X$ and $B$**\nBased on the analysis, to obtain a finite number of embeddings, we must choose the trivial Banach space $B=\\{0\\}$. This choice forces the space $X$ to be a one-point space. Let's formalize this choice:\n*   Let $X = \\{x_1\\}$ be a space with a single point. This is a valid finite ultrametric space, with the only distance being $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$.\n*   Let $B = \\{0\\}$ be the trivial Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\nNow, let's count the number of isometric embeddings from this $X$ to this $B$.\nThere is only one possible function $f: \\{x_1\\} \\to \\{0\\}$, which is $f(x_1) = 0$.\nWe check if it is isometric:\n$\\|f(x_1) - f(x_1)\\| = d(x_1, x_1)$.\n$\\|0 - 0\\| = 0$.\n$0=0$.\nThe condition is satisfied. The function is an isometric embedding. Since it is the only possible function, there is exactly one embedding in this case.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the result**\nWe have found a valid pair $(X,B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 1. The number of embeddings must be a positive integer (existence of embeddings is a known result, and for our specific chosen pair, we've shown one exists). Therefore, the number of embeddings cannot be 0.\nThe smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\n*Careful Points Summary:*\n*   The literal interpretation of \"number of embeddings\" is the cardinality of the set of such functions.\n*   The freedom to choose both $X$ and $B$ is key.\n*   Translations in a non-trivial Banach space create infinitely many embeddings.\n*   To get a finite number, one must choose the trivial Banach space $B=\\{0\\}$.\n*   The choice of $B=\\{0\\}$ forces the choice of $X$ to be a one-point space for an embedding to exist.\n*   This specific case $(X=\\{x_1\\}, B=\\{0\\})$ results in exactly one isometric embedding.\n*   The minimum possible value cannot be less than 1.\n\n>>>1"
