    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Question\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Task:** The primary goal is to compute the determinant of a specific 3x3 matrix, denoted as `A`.\n2.  **Analyze the Given Information:**\n    *   The matrix is explicitly provided:\n        \\[\n        A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n        2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n        -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n        -1 & -1 & 2\n        \\end{bmatrix}\n        \\]\n    *   Contextual information is also given: \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\".\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Context:** The phrase \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" provides context from a specific area of mathematics (likely related to cluster algebras or representation theory). However, the matrix `A` is given with constant numerical entries. Its values do not depend on \\(m_{1/2}\\) or any other variable. Therefore, this contextual information is extraneous to the required calculation. The problem simplifies to finding the determinant of the matrix `A` as written.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distracting Information:** It is crucial to recognize that the information about the \"Markov quiver\" and \"\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is not needed for the calculation. The problem is a straightforward linear algebra question once the matrix is identified.\n*   **Matrix Properties:** Before jumping into a brute-force calculation, it's often helpful to inspect the matrix for special properties. In this case, matrix `A` has a very clear structure. Notice the sum of the elements in each row:\n    *   Row 1: \\( 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 2: \\( -1 + 2 + (-1) = 0 \\)\n    *   Row 3: \\( -1 + (-1) + 2 = 0 \\)\n*   **Implications of Properties:** A square matrix where the sum of the elements in each row (or each column) is zero is a **singular matrix**. This means its rows are linearly dependent, and a fundamental theorem of linear algebra states that the determinant of any singular matrix is **zero**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nWe can compute the determinant using several methods to confirm this conclusion.\n\n**Method 1: Using the Property of Linear Dependence**\n\n1.  As noted above, the sum of the elements in each row is 0. This implies that the rows are linearly dependent. Specifically, if we denote the rows as \\(R_1, R_2, R_3\\), then \\(1 \\cdot R_1 + 1 \\cdot R_2 + 1 \\cdot R_3 = [0, 0, 0]\\).\n2.  Another way to see this is that the vector \\( \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\) is a non-zero solution to the equation \\( A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0} \\), which means \\( \\lambda = 0 \\) is an eigenvalue of the matrix A.\n3.  The determinant of a matrix is equal to the product of its eigenvalues. Since one of the eigenvalues is 0, the determinant must be 0.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation using the Cofactor Expansion Formula**\n\nThe determinant of a 3x3 matrix \\( \\begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{bmatrix} \\) is given by the formula \\( a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\).\n\nFor our matrix `A`:\n*   \\(a=2, b=-1, c=-1\\)\n*   \\(d=-1, e=2, f=-1\\)\n*   \\(g=-1, h=-1, i=2\\)\n\nLet's substitute these values into the formula:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} + (-1) \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the 2x2 determinants:\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(2) - (-1)(-1) = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(2) - (-1)(-1) = -2 - 1 = -3 \\)\n*   \\( \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 2 \\\\ -1 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = (-1)(-1) - (2)(-1) = 1 - (-2) = 3 \\)\n\nSubstitute these results back into the main expression:\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 2(3) + 1(-3) - 1(3)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3\n\\]\n\\[\n\\det(A) = 0\n\\]\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix is 0.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe calculation shows that the determinant of the given matrix A is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
