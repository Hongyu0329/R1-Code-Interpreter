    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and their roles.**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (IUPAC name: 1,3-butadiene).** Its structure is CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂. This molecule is a conjugated diene, meaning it has two double bonds separated by a single bond. In cycloaddition reactions, conjugated dienes typically act as the 4π-electron component.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.** Its structure is CCl₂=CF₂. This molecule is an alkene derivative. The four halogen atoms (two chlorine and two fluorine) are highly electronegative, which withdraws electron density from the double bond. This makes it an electron-deficient alkene, and therefore a very reactive dienophile (the 2π-electron component).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the type of reaction.**\nThe reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile is a classic example of a **Diels-Alder reaction**. This is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition reaction, which proceeds via a concerted pericyclic mechanism to form a new six-membered ring.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the formation of the product's carbon skeleton.**\n*   In the Diels-Alder reaction, the 4π electrons of the diene and the 2π electrons of the dienophile rearrange to form two new sigma (σ) bonds and one new pi (π) bond.\n*   The terminal carbons of the diene (C1 and C4) will form new sigma bonds with the two carbons of the dienophile's double bond.\n*   The original C2-C3 single bond of the diene becomes a double bond in the product.\n*   The result is a six-membered ring. In this case, it will be a cyclohexene derivative.\n\n**Step 4: Place the substituents on the product skeleton.**\n*   The starting diene, 1,3-butadiene, is H₂C¹=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂.\n*   The starting dienophile is F₂C=CCl₂.\n*   Let's visualize the bond formation: The ends of the diene (C1 and C4) connect to the carbons of the dienophile. A new double bond forms between C2 and C3.\n\n    ```\n         CH₂               F₂C\n        /  \\\\             //\n      CH    +           CCl₂\n        \\\\  /\n         CH₂\n            ↓\n          [Transition State]\n            ↓\n          CH=CH\n         /     \\\n       CH₂     CH₂\n        |       |\n       CF₂ --- CCl₂\n    ```\n*   The product is a cyclohexene ring. On two adjacent carbons of the ring (the ones that came from the dienophile), there are geminal substituents: one carbon has two fluorine atoms, and the other has two chlorine atoms.\n\n**Step 5: Consider regiochemistry.**\nRegiochemistry refers to the orientation of the addition when both the diene and dienophile are unsymmetrical.\n*   The diene, 1,3-butadiene, is symmetrical. There is a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3.\n*   The dienophile, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene, is unsymmetrical. One end is -CF₂ and the other is -CCl₂.\n*   Because the diene is symmetrical, there is only **one possible regioisomeric product**. It does not matter which end of the dienophile attacks C1 of the butadiene, as C4 is equivalent. The resulting molecule will be identical, just viewed from a different perspective.\n\n**Step 6: Name the final product.**\nThe product is a cyclohexene ring substituted with two chlorine and two fluorine atoms. To name it according to IUPAC rules:\n1.  The parent ring is **cyclohexene**.\n2.  The double bond carbons are numbered C1 and C2.\n3.  We number around the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. In this case, the substituents will be on C4 and C5 regardless of the direction of numbering.\n4.  When locants are tied, we assign the lower number based on alphabetical priority of the substituent names (\"chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\").\n5.  Therefore, the -CCl₂ group is at position 4, and the -CF₂ group is at position 5.\nThe name of the product is **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene is a Diels-Alder reaction that forms a single product, a substituted cyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
