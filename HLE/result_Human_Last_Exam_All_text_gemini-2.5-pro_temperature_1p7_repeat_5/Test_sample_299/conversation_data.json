    "Answering this question involves analyzing the properties of the function `f` and then determining how many such functions can exist.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Initial Properties of `f`**\n\nLet the given functional equation be $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\n*   The function $\\exp(x) = e^x$ is defined for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and its range is $(0, \\infty)$.\n*   The function `f` must be injective (one-to-one). To see this, assume $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying `f` to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $\\exp(x_1) = \\exp(x_2)$. Since $\\exp(x)$ is an injective function, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, `f` is injective.\n*   A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that is injective must be strictly monotonic. This means `f` must be either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. We analyze these two cases separately.\n\n**2. A Crucial Identity**\n\nFor any solution `f`, we can derive a commutation property with the exponential function.\nStarting with the given equation: $f(f(x)) = \\exp(x)$.\nApply `f` to both sides: $f(f(f(x))) = f(\\exp(x))$.\nNow consider the original equation again, but substitute `f(x)` for `x`: $f(f(f(x))) = \\exp(f(x))$.\nComparing the two expressions for $f(f(f(x)))$, we get:\n$f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$.\nThis means that `f` and `exp` commute. This identity holds for any solution `f`, regardless of its monotonicity.\n\n**3. Case 1: `f` is strictly decreasing**\n\nLet's assume `f` is a strictly decreasing continuous function.\n*   Let's evaluate `f` at some key points. Let $f(0) = c$.\n*   Using the main equation at $x=0$, we get $f(f(0)) = \\exp(0)$, which means $f(c) = 1$.\n*   Since the range of $\\exp(x)$ is $(0, \\infty)$, the range of $f(f(x))$ is also $(0, \\infty)$. Let $y=f(x)$. This means $f(y)$ must be positive for any `y` in the range of `f`. If the range of `f` is $\\mathbb{R}$, then `f` must be a function from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $(0, \\infty)$. If `f: \\mathbb{R} \\to (0, \\infty)$, then its value `c = f(0)` must be positive, i.e., $c > 0$.\n*   Since `f` is strictly decreasing and $c>0$, we can compare the values of `f` at `0` and `c`. The relationship between `0` and `c` determines the relationship between `f(0)` and `f(c)`.\n    *   If $c > 0$, then because `f` is decreasing, $f(c) < f(0)$. Substituting the known values, this means $1 < c$.\n*   Now let's use the commutation identity $f(\\exp(x)) = \\exp(f(x))$ at $x=0$:\n    *   $f(\\exp(0)) = \\exp(f(0))$, which simplifies to $f(1) = \\exp(c) = e^c$.\n*   So far we have $f(0)=c$, $f(c)=1$, and $f(1)=e^c$, with the condition that $c > 1$.\n*   Let's compare the values of `f` at the points $0, 1, c$. Since $c > 1$, we have $0 < 1 < c$.\n*   Because `f` is strictly decreasing, it must reverse the order of these inequalities: $f(0) > f(1) > f(c)$.\n*   Substituting the values we found: $c > e^c > 1$.\n*   This implies the inequality $c > e^c$. However, for any real number `c`, it is a well-known fact that $e^c \\ge c+1$. For $c>1$, $e^c$ is strictly greater than `c`. Thus, the inequality $c > e^c$ has no real solution.\n*   This contradiction shows that our initial assumption must be false. Therefore, there are **no strictly decreasing** continuous functions that satisfy the given equation.\n\n**4. Case 2: `f` is strictly increasing**\n\nLet's assume `f` is a strictly increasing continuous function.\n*   First, consider the behavior of `f(x)` relative to `x`. The equation $e^x=x$ has no real solutions, and in fact $e^x > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means $f(f(x)) > x$.\n    *   If there were a fixed point $f(x_0)=x_0$, then $f(f(x_0))=x_0$, which would mean $e^{x_0}=x_0$, a contradiction. So `f` has no fixed points.\n    *   A continuous function with no fixed points must satisfy either $f(x) > x$ for all `x` or $f(x) < x$ for all `x`.\n    *   If $f(x) < x$ for all `x`, since `f` is increasing, we would have $f(f(x)) < f(x) < x$. This contradicts $f(f(x)) = e^x > x$.\n    *   Therefore, any strictly increasing solution must satisfy $f(x) > x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Constructing Solutions:** We can construct solutions by defining `f` on a specific interval and then using the functional equation to extend it to all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    1.  Pick an arbitrary starting point, say $x_0 = 0$.\n    2.  Choose a value for $f(0)$. Let $f(0) = c$. From $f(x) > x$, we must have $c = f(0) > 0$. From $f(f(0))=e^0=1$, we have $f(c)=1$. Since `f` is increasing and $f(0)=c$ and $f(c)=1$, we must have $0<c$ and $c<1$. So we can choose any $c \\in (0, 1)$.\n    3.  Let's fix a choice, say $c = 1/2$. So we need to define `f` such that $f(0)=1/2$ and $f(1/2)=1$.\n    4.  The core idea is that we have freedom in defining the function on the interval $[0, c]$. We can choose `f` on $[0, c]$ to be any continuous, strictly increasing function $h: [0, c] \\to [c, 1]$ such that $h(0)=c$ and $h(c)=1$. For our example, this is $h: [0, 1/2] \\to [1/2, 1]$.\n    5.  Once this choice is made, the function `f` is uniquely determined everywhere else. For example, for any $x \\in [c, 1]$, we can find `f(x)` because $x$ is in the range of `h`. Let $x=h(t)$ for some $t \\in [0,c]$. Then $f(x) = f(h(t)) = f(f(t)) = e^t = e^{h^{-1}(x)}$.\n    6.  This process can be continued to define `f` over all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n*   **Counting the Solutions:** The set of solutions corresponds to the set of possible initial choices. The choice of $c \\in (0,1)$ provides some freedom, but the crucial freedom comes from choosing the function `h`.\n    *   Let's fix $c=1/2$. We need to count how many continuous, strictly increasing functions `h` map $[0, 1/2]$ to $[1/2, 1]$. Such a function is a homeomorphism between the two intervals.\n    *   We can construct a distinct function `h` for every real number in a certain range. For example, pick any $y \\in (1/2, 1)$. We can define $h(1/4) = y$ and connect the points $(0, 1/2)$, $(1/4, y)$, and $(1/2, 1)$ with straight lines. This creates a valid (piecewise linear) continuous increasing function. Since we can choose `y` from the interval $(1/2, 1)$, which has cardinality `c` (the cardinality of the continuum, $|\\mathbb{R}|$), there are at least `c` such functions `h`.\n    *   Each distinct choice of `h` leads to a distinct solution `f`, since `f` and `h` are identical on the interval $[0, c]$.\n    *   Therefore, there are at least `c` solutions.\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** A continuous function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is uniquely determined by its values on a dense subset of $\\mathbb{R}$, like the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. The number of functions from $\\mathbb{Q}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $|\\mathbb{R}|^{|\\mathbb{Q}|} = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. The set of all continuous functions from $\\mathbb{R}$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is a subset of this, so its cardinality is at most `c`.\n\n*   Since the cardinality of the set of solutions is at least `c` and at most `c`, it must be exactly `c`.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe set of functions we are interested in can be partitioned into two disjoint sets: strictly increasing solutions and strictly decreasing solutions.\n*   The set of strictly decreasing solutions is empty.\n*   The set of strictly increasing solutions has cardinality `c`, the cardinality of the continuum ($2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\nTherefore, the total cardinality of the set of solutions is $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\n>>>$\\mathfrak{c}$"
