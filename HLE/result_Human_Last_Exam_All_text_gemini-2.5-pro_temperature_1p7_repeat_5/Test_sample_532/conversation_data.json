    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's carefully define all the terms in the question.\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, inverses for all elements, and a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y \\in S` (including the case where `x = y`), their product `xy` is not an element of `S`. This can be written succinctly as `S \\cdot S \\cap S = \\emptyset`.\n*   **Maximum by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** This is a product-free set `A` such that `A` is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, if you add any element `g \\in G \\setminus A` to `A`, the new set `A \\cup \\{g\\}` is no longer product-free.\n*   **Filled Group:** A finite group `G` is \"filled\" if the union of all its maximum by inclusion product-free sets is equal to the entire group `G`. Let `\\mathcal{M}` be the collection of all maximum product-free sets in `G`. The condition for `G` to be filled is `\\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}} A = G`.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group `G` is nilpotent if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Properties of Product-Free Sets\n\nThe crucial part of the analysis lies in understanding the constraints on product-free sets. Let's consider the identity element `e` of any group `G`.\n\n*   **Can the identity element `e` be in a product-free set `S`?**\n    Let's assume `e \\in S`. According to the definition of a product-free set, for any `x, y \\in S`, their product `xy` must not be in `S`. We can choose `x = e` and `y = e`, both of which are in `S` by our assumption.\n    *   The product is `xy = e \\cdot e = e`.\n    *   The product-free condition requires `xy \\notin S`, which means `e \\notin S`.\n    *   This leads to a contradiction: we assumed `e \\in S` and derived `e \\notin S`.\n*   **Conclusion about the identity element:** For any group `G`, the identity element `e` cannot be a member of any product-free set `S`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the \"Filled\" Condition\n\nNow we apply the finding from Step 2 to the definition of a filled group.\n\n*   A group `G` is filled if the union of all its maximum product-free sets equals `G`.\n*   Let `M(G) = \\bigcup_{A \\in \\mathcal{M}} A` be the union of all maximum product-free sets of `G`. The condition for `G` to be filled is `M(G) = G`.\n*   From Step 2, we know that for any product-free set `A`, `e \\notin A`. This must also be true for all *maximum* product-free sets.\n*   Since `e` is not in any of the sets being unioned, it cannot be in their union. Therefore, `e \\notin M(G)`.\n*   However, for `G` to be a group, it must contain the identity element `e`. So, `e \\in G`.\n*   We have `e \\in G` but `e \\notin M(G)`. This means that `M(G)` can never be equal to `G` for any group `G`. `M(G)` is always a proper subset of `G`.\n*   An edge case is the trivial group `G = \\{e\\}`. What are its product-free sets? The only non-empty subset is `{e}` itself. For `S=\\{e\\}` to be product-free, `e \\cdot e = e` must not be in `S`, a contradiction. So `{e\\}` is not product-free. The only product-free set is the empty set, `\\emptyset`, which is therefore the only maximum product-free set. The union of all maximum product-free sets is `\\emptyset`. Since `\\emptyset \\ne \\{e\\}`, the trivial group is not filled.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nThe definition of a \"filled group\" requires the union of all maximum product-free sets to be the group itself. However, a simple analysis of the definition of a \"product-free set\" shows that the identity element `e` can never be part of any such set. Consequently, the union of these sets can never contain `e` and thus can never be equal to the entire group `G`.\n\nTherefore, no group, whether nilpotent or not, can satisfy the condition of being a filled group. The set of all filled groups is empty.\n\nThe question asks for the finite filled nilpotent groups. Since no such groups exist, the answer is the empty set.\n\n<<<There are no finite filled nilpotent groups.>>>"
