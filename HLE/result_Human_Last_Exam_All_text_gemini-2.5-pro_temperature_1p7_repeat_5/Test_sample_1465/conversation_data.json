    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil protein sequences.\n\n**Step 1: Understand Coiled-Coil Structure and Heptad Repeats**\nCoiled-coils consist of alpha-helices wrapped around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, known as a heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`. The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) are primarily determined by the amino acids at the core positions, 'a' and 'd', and to a lesser extent by electrostatic interactions between flanking positions 'e' and 'g'.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Heptad Register**\nThere are two common ways to register a heptad repeat. We must determine which one applies to these designed sequences. Let's test the most straightforward registration, where the sequence begins at the 'a' position of the first heptad.\n\nRegistration Frame: `(abcdefg)`\n- 'a' positions: 1, 8, 15, 22\n- 'd' positions: 4, 11, 18, 25\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Each Sequence Using the Chosen Registration and Known Rules**\nWe will analyze the core 'a' and 'd' positions for each sequence. The rules for oligomerization are based on decades of protein design research.\n- **Canonical Rules (hydrophobic cores):** `(a=L, d=L)` -> Dimer; `(a=I, d=L)` -> Trimer; `(a=I, d=A)` or `(a=I, d=I)` -> Tetramer.\n- **Non-Canonical Rules (polar/charged cores):** The rules change when polar or charged residues are in the core.\n    - `a=E` (Glutamate): The repulsion between negatively charged `E` residues in the core often destabilizes dimers, favoring trimers where the side chains are further apart.\n    - `a=N, d=A` (Asparagine, Alanine): This combination is a well-established motif for forming dimers.\n    - `a=E, d=K` (Glutamate, Lysine): A buried salt bridge can form, often specifying a trimeric state.\n    - `a=E, d=Q` (Glutamate, Glutamine): This combination is known to be on the border between trimeric and tetrameric states.\n\n**Sequence Analysis:**\n\n1.  **EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK**\n    -   'a' positions: E, E, E, E\n    -   'd' positions: Q, K, W, Q\n    -   The 'a' positions are consistently Glutamate (E). Based on the rule for `a=E`, the repulsive forces in the core favor a **trimer (3)**.\n\n2.  **EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ**\n    -   This sequence is 32 amino acids, suggesting a complex or non-standard repeat structure. However, it contains the segment `KENAALK`. Let's analyze the heptad implied by this part: `(KENAALK)`.\n    -   Registration `(abcdefg)` gives `a=K, d=A`. This is not a standard motif.\n    -   Let's consider the composition and look for dominant motifs. The sequence has heptads starting with `EIA...` and one with `KEN...`. Let's assume the heptad starting at residue 15 is key: `(KENAALK)`. If we re-register this fragment, `(NAALKQE)`, the core would be `a=N, d=A`.\n    -   The `a=N, d=A` core is a strong motif for a **dimer (2)**. This specific motif likely overrides other signals in the sequence.\n\n3.  **EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ**\n    -   This sequence can be broken down into four repeats of `EIAAIKx`. The consistent part implies a heptad of `(EIAAIK...)`.\n    -   'a' positions: E, E, E, E\n    -   'd' positions: A, A, A, A\n    -   The core is composed of `a=E` and `d=A`. As with the first sequence, the `a=E` is the dominant determinant, favoring a **trimer (3)**.\n\n4.  **EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK**\n    -   The repeating unit is largely `EIQKQLK`.\n    -   'a' positions: E, E, E, E\n    -   'd' positions: K, K, W, K\n    -   The core is predominantly `a=E` and `d=K`. A buried salt bridge between Glutamate (negative) at 'a' and Lysine (positive) at 'd' of an adjacent helix is known to specifically stabilize **trimers (3)**.\n\n5.  **EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK**\n    -   The repeating unit is `EIAxTLK`. The most common implied heptad is `(EIAQTLK)`.\n    -   'a' positions: E, E, E, E\n    -   'd' positions: Q, K, W, Q\n    -   The core is mostly `a=E` and `d=Q`. This combination is known from experimental studies to be on the edge, capable of forming both trimers and tetramers. In the context of a multiple-choice question seeking a single answer, and given that the other rules have produced `(3,2,3,3,...)`, we must select the oligomeric state that fits a given option. If this combination leads to a higher-order oligomer than the baseline trimer, it would be a **tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis with the `(abcdefg)` registration and known rules for non-canonical coiled-coils, the predicted oligomeric states are:\n- Sequence 1: **3** (Trimer)\n- Sequence 2: **2** (Dimer)\n- Sequence 3: **3** (Trimer)\n- Sequence 4: **3** (Trimer)\n- Sequence 5: **4** (Tetramer)\n\nThis set of oligomeric states is (3, 2, 3, 3, 4). This matches one of the answer choices.\n\n<<<E>>>"
