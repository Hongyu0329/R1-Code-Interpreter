    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **JTB Definition of Knowledge:** For a subject (S) to know a proposition (P), three conditions must be met:\n        1.  **Truth (T):** The proposition P must be true.\n        2.  **Belief (B):** The subject S must believe the proposition P.\n        3.  **Justification (J):** The subject S must be justified in believing the proposition P.\n    *   In short: Knowledge = Justified True Belief.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Constraints:**\n    *   **Constraint 1: Ignore Gettier Problems.** Gettier problems demonstrate that it's possible to have a Justified True Belief that isn't actually knowledge (e.g., due to a kind of epistemic luck). By asking us to ignore these, the question forces us to look for other, more fundamental issues with the JTB model under the given conditions.\n    *   **Constraint 2: Only Two Available Epistemic States: Knowledge and Belief.** This is the most critical and unusual constraint. It creates a strict binary world. For any proposition, an agent is either in the state of \"Knowing it\" or the state of \"Believing it\". There are no other options.\n\n3.  **Synthesize Concepts and Constraints to find Problem 1:**\n    *   The JTB definition states that Knowledge *is a type of* belief. Specifically, it's a belief that also happens to be true and justified. This means if you have Knowledge of P, you must also, by definition, have a Belief of P. Knowledge is a *subset* of Belief.\n    *   However, the problem's constraint sets up Knowledge and Belief as the *two available epistemic states*. This language strongly implies they are separate, mutually exclusive categories. If you are in the state of \"Knowledge\", you are not in the state of \"Belief\", and vice-versa.\n    *   This leads to the first problem: **a logical contradiction or incoherence in the framework itself.**\n        *   On one hand (from JTB), Knowledge is a *subtype* of Belief.\n        *   On the other hand (from the constraint), Knowledge is a *mutually exclusive alternative* to Belief.\n        *   A state cannot be both a subset of another state and mutually exclusive with it. The framework is fundamentally incoherent.\n\n4.  **Synthesize Concepts and Constraints to find Problem 2:**\n    *   Let's explore what falls into the \"Belief\" category according to this framework. Since \"Knowledge\" is defined as a Justified True Belief (J+T+B), and \"Belief\" is the *only other option*, the state of \"Belief\" must encompass every epistemic position that is *not* a Justified True Belief.\n    *   Let's consider the possibilities that are NOT Knowledge:\n        *   **Justified False Belief (JFB):** You have good reasons for your belief, but it turns out to be false. (e.g., trusting a usually reliable clock that has stopped). According to the rules, this is not Knowledge (because it's not True), so it must be categorized as a \"Belief\".\n        *   **Unjustified True Belief (UTB):** You have a belief that happens to be true, but you have no good reason for it; it's a lucky guess. This is not Knowledge (because it's not Justified), so it must be categorized as a \"Belief\".\n        *   **Unjustified False Belief (UFB):** A belief that is both without justification and false (e.g., a baseless superstition). This is not Knowledge (not Justified, not True), so it must be categorized as a \"Belief\".\n    *   This leads to the second problem: **The category of \"Belief\" becomes an undifferentiated \"wastebasket\".**\n        *   It conflates being *rationally mistaken* (JFB) with being *lucky* (UTB) and being *irrational* (UFB).\n        *   A robust epistemic framework should be able to distinguish between someone who made a rational error based on misleading evidence and someone who believes something for no reason at all.\n        *   By forcing all non-knowledge states into a single bucket called \"Belief,\" the JTB model, under these constraints, loses all critical nuance and fails to make important distinctions about the nature and quality of our beliefs.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The problem is an artificial philosophical puzzle designed to expose flaws other than Gettier cases. The constraint of having only two epistemic states is key.\n*   Problem 1 is a logical inconsistency in how the states are defined in relation to each other.\n*   Problem 2 is about the consequences of that setupâ€”it creates a category (\"Belief\") that is too broad and undifferentiated to be epistemically useful, lumping together rational mistakes and irrationality.\n*   It's crucial to remember that we are analyzing JTB *within this artificial system*, not in the broader context of epistemology where more states (e.g., justified belief, unjustified belief, etc.) are allowed.\n\n***\n\n<<<The two problems JTB runs into under these specific constraints are:\n\n1.  **Logical Incoherence of States:** The JTB definition posits that Knowledge is a *type* of belief (specifically, one that is justified and true). This means Knowledge is a subset of Belief. However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the *only two available epistemic states* implies they are mutually exclusive categories. A state cannot be both a subset of another and mutually exclusive with it. This creates a fundamental logical contradiction in the framework.\n\n2.  **The Undifferentiated Nature of \"Belief\":** If Knowledge is a \"Justified True Belief\" and \"Belief\" is the only other possible state, then the \"Belief\" category becomes a catch-all for every other epistemic situation. It fails to distinguish between vastly different states, such as:\n    *   A **Justified False Belief** (being rationally mistaken).\n    *   An **Unjustified True Belief** (a lucky guess).\n    *   An **Unjustified False Belief** (a delusion or baseless opinion).\n    This lumping-together makes the category of \"Belief\" too crude, losing crucial distinctions about rationality and epistemic standing.>>>"
