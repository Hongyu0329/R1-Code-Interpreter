The two problems JTB runs into under these specific constraints are:

1.  **Logical Incoherence of States:** The JTB definition posits that Knowledge is a *type* of belief (specifically, one that is justified and true). This means Knowledge is a subset of Belief. However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the *only two available epistemic states* implies they are mutually exclusive categories. A state cannot be both a subset of another and mutually exclusive with it. This creates a fundamental logical contradiction in the framework.

2.  **The Undifferentiated Nature of "Belief":** If Knowledge is a "Justified True Belief" and "Belief" is the only other possible state, then the "Belief" category becomes a catch-all for every other epistemic situation. It fails to distinguish between vastly different states, such as:
    *   A **Justified False Belief** (being rationally mistaken).
    *   An **Unjustified True Belief** (a lucky guess).
    *   An **Unjustified False Belief** (a delusion or baseless opinion).
This lumping-together makes the category of "Belief" too crude, losing crucial distinctions about rationality and epistemic standing.
