    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object of study.**\nWe are considering the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This subgroup, denoted $E(K)_{tors}$, consists of all points on the curve with coordinates in $K$ that have finite order. The group structure of $E(K)_{tors}$ is that of a finite abelian group.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the structure of finite abelian groups.**\nBy the structure theorem for finite abelian groups, any such group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups. For the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over a number field, this structure is always of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ for integers $m, n \\ge 1$ where $n$ divides $m$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize non-cyclic torsion subgroups.**\nA group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ (with $n|m$) is cyclic if and only if $n=1$. Therefore, a non-cyclic torsion subgroup must have this structure with $n > 1$. The order of such a group is the product $mn$. We are looking for the maximum possible value of $mn$ under these conditions.\n\n**Step 4: Consult known classification theorems.**\nThe possible structures of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields is a well-studied area of arithmetic geometry.\n*   **Mazur's Theorem** classifies the possible torsion subgroups over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Merel's Theorem** states that for any given degree $d$ of a number field, there is a uniform bound on the possible size of the torsion subgroup.\n*   For quadratic fields (degree $d=2$), the list of all possible torsion subgroups was completely determined by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose.\n*   However, not every group that can occur over *some* quadratic field can occur over a *specific* quadratic field like $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the classification for the specific field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.**\nThe field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ is special; it is the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$. The complete classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over this specific field is known. According to a paper by Filip Najman (\"Torsion of elliptic curves over quadratic cyclotomic fields\", 2015), the possible torsion subgroups for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are precisely enumerated.\n\n**Step 6: List the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for $E(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3}))$.**\nFrom the classification provided in Najman's work, the non-cyclic torsion subgroups that can occur for an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the order of each possible non-cyclic group.**\nWe compute the order for each group in the list above:\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$) = $2 \\times 2 = 4$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$) = $2 \\times 4 = 8$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$) = $2 \\times 6 = 12$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$) = $2 \\times 8 = 16$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$) = $3 \\times 3 = 9$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$) = $4 \\times 4 = 16$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$) = $3 \\times 6 = 18$\n*   Order($\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$) = $2 \\times 12 = 24$\n\n**Step 8: Identify the maximum order.**\nComparing the orders calculated in the previous step {4, 8, 12, 16, 9, 16, 18, 24}, the largest value is 24.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   It is crucial to distinguish between the list of possible torsion subgroups over *all* quadratic fields and the more restrictive list for the *specific* field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. For example, groups like $\\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/5\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 25), $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 27), and $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$ (order 36) can occur over certain quadratic fields, but they do not occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n*   The question asks for the largest *order*, which is the size of the group, not the group structure itself.\n*   One must only consider non-cyclic groups as per the question's constraint. Cyclic groups such as $\\mathbb{Z}/18\\mathbb{Z}$ can occur, but they are not relevant to this specific question, even if their order (18) is larger than the order of some non-cyclic groups.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the largest possible order is 24, corresponding to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<24>>>"
