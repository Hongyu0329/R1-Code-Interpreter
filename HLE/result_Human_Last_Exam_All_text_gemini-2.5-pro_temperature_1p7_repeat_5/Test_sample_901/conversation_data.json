    "**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactants and Reaction Type:**\n    *   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring.\n    *   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (KOC(CH₃)₃) in tert-butyl alcohol. Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n    *   **Reaction:** The combination of a secondary alkyl halide and a strong, bulky base strongly favors an **E2 (bimolecular elimination)** reaction. Substitution reactions (SN1/SN2) are disfavored; SN2 is sterically hindered by the bulky base, and E2 is faster than SN1/E1 in the presence of a strong base.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Stereochemical Requirements of the E2 Reaction:**\n    *   The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-proton) must be **anti-periplanar**.\n    *   In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-proton must both be in **axial** positions and on adjacent carbons, with one pointing \"up\" and the other \"down\". This is referred to as a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n\n3.  **Determine the Structure and Conformation of the Substrate:**\n    *   First, we determine the relative stereochemistry from the (1S,2R) designation. For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, an (S,R) or (R,S) configuration means the substituents are **trans** to each other. So, we have *trans*-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\n    *   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist as two interconverting chair conformers: one where both substituents are axial (diaxial) and one where both are equatorial (diequatorial).\n    *   **Conformer A (diaxial):** Bromine is axial, and the methyl group is axial.\n    *   **Conformer B (diequatorial):** Bromine is equatorial, and the methyl group is equatorial.\n    *   **Stability:** The diequatorial conformer (B) is much more stable because bulky groups prefer the less sterically crowded equatorial position. The diaxial conformer (A) has significant steric strain. Therefore, at equilibrium, the molecule exists predominantly as the diequatorial conformer.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Conformer for E2 Reactivity:**\n    *   **Conformer B (Diequatorial - Major Conformer):** The bromine atom is in an equatorial position. Since an axial bromine is required for the E2 reaction's anti-periplanar geometry, **this conformer is unreactive towards E2 elimination**.\n    *   **Conformer A (Diaxial - Minor Conformer):** The bromine atom is in an axial position. This conformer *can* undergo E2 elimination. Even though it is the minor conformer, the reaction will proceed through it because it is the only one that meets the geometric requirement (Le Châtelier's principle and the Curtin-Hammett principle).\n\n5.  **Determine the Regiochemistry (Site of Elimination):**\n    *   In Conformer A, the bromine at C1 is axial. We must look for axial protons on the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6).\n    *   **Proton at C2:** In this conformer, the methyl group at C2 is axial. Therefore, the hydrogen atom at C2 must be **equatorial**. This equatorial hydrogen is *not* anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Thus, elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 **cannot occur**. The product that would have formed, 1-methylcyclohexene, is the more substituted alkene (Zaitsev product).\n    *   **Proton at C6:** Carbon C6 has both an axial and an equatorial hydrogen. The **axial hydrogen at C6** is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1. The bulky tert-butoxide base can abstract this proton.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Elimination can only occur by removing the axial proton from C6, leading to the formation of a double bond between C1 and C6.\n\n6.  **Identify the Final Product:**\n    *   The elimination reaction forms a double bond between C1 and C6. The methyl group remains on C2.\n    *   The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring where the methyl group is on a carbon adjacent to the double bond.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, we number the ring to give the double bond the lowest possible numbers (C1 and C2) and the substituent the lowest possible number thereafter. Numbering the double bond carbons as 1 and 2 places the methyl group at position 3.\n    *   Therefore, the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene (Hofmann product), and its formation is dictated by the strict stereochemical constraints of the E2 reaction.\n\n---\n**Summary of Careful Points:**\n*   The reaction is an E2 elimination, not substitution.\n*   E2 reactions on cyclohexane rings require a *trans-diaxial* arrangement of the leaving group and the β-proton.\n*   The substrate must adopt its less stable diaxial conformation to react.\n*   The stereochemistry at C2 (axial methyl group in the reactive conformer) prevents the formation of the Zaitsev product (1-methylcyclohexene).\n*   Elimination is forced to occur at C6, leading exclusively to the Hofmann product (3-methylcyclohexene).\n\n---\n\nThe name of the product of the reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
