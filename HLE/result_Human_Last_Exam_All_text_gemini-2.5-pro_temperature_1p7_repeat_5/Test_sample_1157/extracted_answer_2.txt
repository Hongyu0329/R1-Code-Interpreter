A detailed, multi-phase management plan is required, starting with an urgent medical referral to control her diabetes. Emergency dental care involves pain management, infection control (antibiotics), and wound care. Definitive treatment options include dental implants, a fixed bridge, or a removable partial denture (RPD), with the final choice depending on medical stability, patient finances, and bone condition. The critical cells determining the impossibility of replantation are the Periodontal Ligament (PDL) cells, which become non-viable after 28 hours. If a denture is chosen, the best option is a Cast Metal Framework RPD made of Cobalt-Chromium and acrylic. The abutment teeth would be the left central incisor (#21) and second premolar (#25) as primary abutments, supported by contralateral teeth like the right canine (#13) and a right molar (#16) for indirect retention and stability.
