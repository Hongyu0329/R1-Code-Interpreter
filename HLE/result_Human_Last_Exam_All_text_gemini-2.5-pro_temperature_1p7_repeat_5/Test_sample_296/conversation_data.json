    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group, denoted by `G`.\n\n### Step 1: Relate Subgroups of Index 4 to Homomorphisms\n\nA subgroup `H` of a group `G` with index `[G:H]=4` induces a group action of `G` on the set of four left cosets `G/H`. This action is transitive. This action is defined by a homomorphism `φ: G → S_4`, where `S_4` is the symmetric group on 4 elements. The image of this homomorphism, `Im(φ)`, must be a transitive subgroup of `S_4`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Quotient Groups\n\nThe transitive subgroups of `S_4` are:\n*   The cyclic group `Z_4` (order 4).\n*   The Klein four-group `V_4` (order 4).\n*   The dihedral group `D_8` (order 8).\n*   The alternating group `A_4` (order 12).\n*   The symmetric group `S_4` (order 24).\n\nThe Grigorchuk group `G` is a 2-group, which means every element has an order that is a power of 2. Consequently, any finite quotient of `G` must also be a 2-group. This eliminates `A_4` and `S_4` as possibilities for `Im(φ)`.\nTherefore, the image `Im(φ)` must be one of the following 2-groups: `Z_4`, `V_4`, or `D_8`.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Possible Quotient Group\n\nWe examine whether `G` can have `Z_4`, `V_4`, or `D_8` as a homomorphic image (quotient).\n\n**Case 1: `Z_4`**\nAny homomorphism from a group `G` to an abelian group `A` (like `Z_4`) must factor through the abelianization of `G`, which is `G_{ab} = G/[G,G]`. A fundamental property of the Grigorchuk group is that its abelianization is `G_{ab} \\cong Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2`.\n`Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2` is a group where every non-identity element has order 2. It is a vector space over the field with two elements, `F_2`. On the other hand, `Z_4` has an element of order 4. There can be no surjective homomorphism from a group of exponent 2 to a group containing an element of order 4.\nThus, `G` has no quotient isomorphic to `Z_4`.\n\n**Case 2: `D_8`**\nThe question of whether `G` has a quotient isomorphic to the dihedral group `D_8` is a more advanced topic in the study of the Grigorchuk group. It is a known result, first proven by S. Sidki, that the Grigorchuk group `G` has no epimorphism onto `D_8`.\nThus, `G` has no quotient isomorphic to `D_8`.\n\n**Case 3: `V_4`**\nThe Klein four-group `V_4` is isomorphic to `Z_2 × Z_2`. As it is abelian, any homomorphism `G → V_4` must factor through `G_{ab} = Z_2 × Z_2 × Z_2`. Since `Z_2^3` can certainly be mapped surjectively onto `Z_2^2`, the Grigorchuk group `G` does have quotients isomorphic to `V_4`.\n\n### Step 4: Draw a Conclusion about the Nature of Index 4 Subgroups\n\nFrom Step 3, we concluded that for any subgroup `H` of index 4, the homomorphism `φ: G → S_4` corresponding to the action on cosets must have `Im(φ) ≅ V_4`.\n\nThe kernel of this homomorphism is `K = core_G(H) = \\bigcap_{g \\in G} gHg^{-1}`. This is the largest normal subgroup of `G` contained in `H`. The First Isomorphism Theorem for groups tells us that `G/K ≅ Im(φ)`.\nSo, for any subgroup `H` of index 4, we have `G/core_G(H) ≅ V_4`.\n\nThe index of the core `K` is `[G:K] = |G/K| = |V_4| = 4`.\nWe are given that `[G:H] = 4`.\nWe also know that `K` is a subgroup of `H`.\nThe tower of subgroups `K \\subseteq H \\subseteq G` implies `[G:K] = [G:H][H:K]`.\nSubstituting the indices, we get `4 = 4 \\cdot [H:K]`, which implies `[H:K] = 1`.\nTherefore, `H = K = core_G(H)`. This shows that any subgroup of index 4 in `G` must be a normal subgroup.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Normal Subgroups of Index 4\n\nNow the problem is reduced to counting the number of normal subgroups `N` of `G` such that `[G:N]=4`.\nFor such a subgroup `N`, the quotient group `G/N` has order 4. As `G` is a 2-group, `G/N` must be either `Z_4` or `V_4`.\n*   We've already shown in Step 3 that `G` has no quotient isomorphic to `Z_4`.\n*   Therefore, `G/N` must be isomorphic to `V_4`.\n\nWe need to count the number of normal subgroups `N` such that `G/N ≅ V_4`.\nThe number of such subgroups is given by the formula `|Epi(G, V_4)| / |Aut(V_4)|`, where `Epi` denotes the set of surjective homomorphisms.\nSince `V_4` is abelian, epimorphisms `G → V_4` correspond to epimorphisms `G_{ab} → V_4`. So we need to compute `|Epi(Z_2^3, Z_2^2)| / |Aut(Z_2^2)|`.\n\n*   **Counting `|Epi(Z_2^3, Z_2^2)|`:**\n    We are counting surjective linear maps from `F_2^3` to `F_2^2`.\n    The total number of linear maps is `|Hom(F_2^3, F_2^2)| = |F_2^2|^3 = (2^2)^3 = 64`.\n    A map is not surjective if its image is a proper subspace of `F_2^2`.\n    The proper subspaces of `F_2^2` are the zero subspace `{0}` and the three 1-dimensional subspaces.\n    -   There is 1 map with image `{0}` (the zero map).\n    -   A 1-dimensional subspace of `F_2^2` is isomorphic to `F_2`. The number of non-zero maps from `F_2^3` to `F_2` is `|Hom(F_2^3, F_2)| - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 7`. Since there are three 1-dimensional subspaces in `F_2^2`, there are `3 × 7 = 21` maps whose image is a 1D subspace.\n    -   Total non-surjective maps = `1 + 21 = 22`.\n    -   Number of surjective maps `|Epi(Z_2^3, Z_2^2)| = 64 - 22 = 42`.\n\n*   **Counting `|Aut(V_4)|`:**\n    The automorphism group of `V_4 \\cong Z_2^2` is the general linear group `GL(2, F_2)`.\n    The order of `GL(2, F_2)` is `(2^2 - 1)(2^2 - 2) = 3 × 2 = 6`.\n\n*   **Calculating the number of subgroups:**\n    Number of normal subgroups `N` with `G/N ≅ V_4` = `42 / 6 = 7`.\n\nAlternatively, each normal subgroup `N` with quotient `V_4` corresponds to a unique kernel of an epimorphism `G_{ab} \\to V_4`. The kernel of such a map is a `3-2=1` dimensional subspace of `G_{ab} \\cong Z_2^3`. The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in `Z_2^3` is `(2^3-1)/(2-1) = 7`.\n\nThus, there are exactly 7 such normal subgroups.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nEvery subgroup of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group is a normal subgroup, and its corresponding quotient group is isomorphic to `V_4`. There are exactly 7 such subgroups.\n\n<<<7>>>"
