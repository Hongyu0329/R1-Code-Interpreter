    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Nature of a Reductive Group of Type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$**\n\n*   A **reductive group** $G$ over a field $k$ is a connected affine algebraic group whose unipotent radical is trivial. The structure of such groups is well-understood. The **type** of a reductive group refers to the type of the root system associated with its derived group over the algebraic closure of $k$.\n*   For this problem, the group $G$ is of type $E_8$, meaning its root system over $\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}$ is of type $E_8$. The field is a finite field $k = \\mathbb{F}_q$.\n*   A key point is to determine if $G$ is **split** over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. A group is split if it contains a maximal torus that is isomorphic to a product of multiplicative groups $(\\mathbb{G}_m)^r$ over the base field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The isomorphism classes of groups of a certain type over a field $k$ are called $k$-forms. These forms are classified by Galois cohomology. Specifically, the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-forms of a split group $G_0$ are classified by the cohomology set $H^1(\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{F}_q}/\\mathbb{F}_q), \\text{Aut}(G_0))$.\n*   For a simple group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This implies that the group of outer automorphisms is trivial. Hence, the full automorphism group is the group of inner automorphisms, which is isomorphic to the adjoint group $G_{ad}$.\n*   So, the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-forms of a group of type $E_8$ are classified by $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{ad})$. By the Lang-Steinberg theorem, for any connected algebraic group $H$ over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the set $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, H)$ is trivial (has only one element).\n*   Since $G_{ad}$ is a connected group, $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, G_{ad})$ is trivial. This means there is only one $\\mathbb{F}_q$-form of a group of type $E_8$ up to isomorphism, which is the split form.\n*   Therefore, the group $G$ in question must be a split reductive group of type $E_8$.\n\n**2. Reduce the Problem from a Reductive to a Semisimple Group**\n\n*   A reductive group $G$ can be decomposed as $G = G_{der} \\cdot Z(G)^0$, where $G_{der}$ is the derived group (which is semisimple) and $Z(G)^0$ is the connected component of the center of $G$ (which is a torus).\n*   There is a natural bijection between the maximal tori of $G$ and the maximal tori of its derived group $G_{der}$. If $T$ is a maximal torus of $G$, then $T' = T \\cap G_{der}$ is a maximal torus of $G_{der}$. Conversely, if $T'$ is a maximal torus of $G_{der}$, then $T = T' \\cdot Z(G)^0$ is a maximal torus of $G$.\n*   This bijection preserves the property of being defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. That is, $T$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational torus if and only if $T'$ is an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational torus.\n*   $G_{der}$ is a split semisimple group of type $E_8$. So, the problem is reduced to finding the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a split semisimple group of type $E_8$.\n\n**3. Apply Steinberg's Theorem**\n\n*   A fundamental theorem by Robert Steinberg provides the answer for this specific situation.\n*   **Steinberg's Theorem:** Let $G$ be a connected semisimple group defined and split over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in $G$ is equal to $q^N$, where $N$ is the number of positive roots in the root system of $G$.\n*   Since we have established that we can consider the split semisimple group of type $E_8$, this theorem is directly applicable.\n\n**4. Determine the Number of Positive Roots for Type $E_8$**\n\n*   The final step is to find the number of positive roots, $N$, for the root system of type $E_8$.\n*   The root system of $E_8$ has rank $r=8$. The dimension of the corresponding simple algebraic group (or Lie algebra) is 248.\n*   The dimension of the group is related to the number of roots by the formula: $\\dim(G) = \\text{rank} + |\\Phi|$, where $|\\Phi|$ is the total number of roots.\n*   So, $248 = 8 + |\\Phi|$, which gives the total number of roots as $|\\Phi| = 240$.\n*   The set of all roots $\\Phi$ is partitioned into a set of positive roots $\\Phi^+$ and a set of negative roots $\\Phi^-$, with $|\\Phi^+| = |\\Phi^-|$.\n*   Therefore, the number of positive roots is $N = |\\Phi^+| = \\frac{|\\Phi|}{2} = \\frac{240}{2} = 120$.\n*   This number can also be obtained by summing the exponents of the Weyl group of $E_8$, which are 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Their sum is $1+7+11+13+17+19+23+29 = 120$.\n\n**5. Final Conclusion**\n\n*   Combining the results from the previous steps:\n    1.  The group $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n    2.  The counting problem can be reduced to its split semisimple derived group of type $E_8$.\n    3.  Steinberg's theorem gives the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational tori as $q^N$.\n    4.  For $E_8$, the number of positive roots is $N=120$.\n*   Thus, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is $q^{120}$.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Split vs. Non-split:** The assumption that the group is split is crucial. This followed from the specific properties of the $E_8$ root system (trivial outer automorphism group) and the properties of finite fields (Lang's theorem). For other group types (like $A_n$ or $D_n$), non-split forms exist over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and the counting would be different.\n2.  **Reductive vs. Semisimple:** The problem is posed for a reductive group, while Steinberg's theorem is stated for semisimple groups. The reduction step showing the bijection between tori of $G$ and $G_{der}$ is a standard result and a necessary part of the rigorous argument.\n3.  **Correctness of Constants:** The dimension of $E_8$ (248) and the number of positive roots (120) are standard, well-known values from the theory of Lie algebras and root systems. Any error in these numbers would lead to an incorrect final answer.\n\nFinal Answer Acquirement: Based on the step-by-step analysis, the answer is determined by applying Steinberg's theorem to a split group of type $E_8$. The number of positive roots for $E_8$ is 120. Thus, the exact number is $q^{120}$.\n\n<<<q^{120}>>>"
