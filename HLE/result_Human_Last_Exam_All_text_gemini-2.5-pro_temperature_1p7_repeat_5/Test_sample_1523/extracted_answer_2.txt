The inner product $(\phi, D_\phi)$ is given by the expression:
$$ (\phi, D_\phi) = \int_0^\beta d\tau \int d^3x \, \phi(\tau, \vec{x}) \left(-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial\tau^2} - \vec{\nabla}^2 + m^2\right) \phi(\tau, \vec{x}) $$
This quantity is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_E^{(0)}[\phi]$.
