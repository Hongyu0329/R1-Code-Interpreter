    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: The Context - Partition Function in Finite-Temperature Field Theory**\n\nIn finite-temperature quantum field theory, thermodynamic quantities are calculated using the path integral formalism in Euclidean spacetime. This is known as the imaginary time formalism.\n\n*   **Imaginary Time:** We perform a Wick rotation from real time $t$ to imaginary time $\\tau$ via $t = -i\\tau$.\n*   **Periodicity:** The imaginary time coordinate is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature. For a bosonic field, like a neutral scalar field $\\phi$, this imposes periodic boundary conditions in the imaginary time direction: $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$.\n*   **Partition Function:** The partition function $Z$ is given by a functional integral over all field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ that satisfy these boundary conditions:\n    $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n*   **Euclidean Action ($S_E$):** This is the action for the field in 4-dimensional Euclidean spacetime. For a neutral scalar field with mass $m$ and potential $V(\\phi)$, the Minkowskian Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_M = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 - V(\\phi)$. After Wick rotation, the Euclidean action becomes:\n    $S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 + V(\\phi) \\right]$\n    This can be written compactly as $S_E[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\mathcal{L}_E$.\n\n**Step 2: Identifying the Quadratic Form**\n\nThe structure of the path integral is dominated by the quadratic (or free/Gaussian) part of the action, which corresponds to setting the interaction potential $V(\\phi)$ to zero. This part defines the propagator and the fundamental inner product structure. The free Euclidean action is:\n$S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\nwhere $(\\partial_E \\phi)^2 = (\\partial_\\tau\\phi)^2 + (\\vec{\\nabla}\\phi)^2$ is the squared norm of the 4D Euclidean gradient.\n\nTo reveal the operator structure, we use integration by parts on the kinetic term:\n$\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_E \\phi)^2 = \\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)$\n$= \\int d^4x_E \\, [ \\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial_\\mu \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\phi) ]$\nThe term $\\partial_\\mu(\\phi \\partial_\\mu \\phi)$ is a total derivative. When integrated, it becomes a surface term. The surface terms at spatial infinity are assumed to be zero. The surface terms in the imaginary time direction, at $\\tau=0$ and $\\tau=\\beta$, cancel out due to the periodic boundary condition on $\\phi$. Therefore, this term integrates to zero.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n$\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_E \\phi)^2 = - \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (-\\partial_E^2) \\phi$\nwhere $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2$ is the 4-dimensional Euclidean Laplacian.\n\nSubstituting this back into the free action, we get:\n$S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial_E^2) \\phi(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (m^2) \\phi(x)$\n$S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) [-\\partial_E^2 + m^2] \\phi(x)$\n\n**Step 3: Defining the Inner Product and the Operator**\n\nThe expression derived in Step 2 has the generic form of an inner product in a function space.\n\n*   **The Inner Product:** For two real scalar fields $\\psi(x)$ and $\\chi(x)$ on Euclidean spacetime, a natural inner product is defined by the integral of their product over the volume:\n    $(\\psi, \\chi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\psi(x) \\chi(x) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\psi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\chi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n*   **The Operator ($D$ or $D_\\phi$):** The notation $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ in the question refers to the inner product of the field $\\phi$ with the result of an operator acting on $\\phi$. Comparing the generic form $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ with our expression for $2S_E^{(0)}$, we can identify the operator $D$.\n    $2S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = (\\phi, [-\\partial_E^2 + m^2]\\phi)$\n    Therefore, the operator in question, which we denote as $D$, is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator:\n    $D \\equiv [-\\partial_E^2 + m^2] = [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\vec{\\nabla}^2 + m^2]$\n\n**Step 4: Assembling the Final Expression**\n\nCombining the definition of the inner product from Step 3 with the operator $D$, we can write down the explicit form of $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$:\n\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) \\equiv (\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (D \\phi(x))$\n$(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) [-\\partial_\\tau^2 - \\vec{\\nabla}^2 + m^2] \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$\n\nThis expression is precisely twice the free Euclidean action, $2S_E^{(0)}[\\phi]$. It is this quantity that appears in the exponent of the Gaussian part of the functional integral for the partition function, $Z_0 = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, \\exp[-\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)]$.\n\n### Careful Points\n\n1.  **Euclidean Space:** The entire calculation is performed in Euclidean spacetime, where the metric is positive definite. This changes the sign of the spatial part of the Klein-Gordon operator relative to its Minkowskian counterpart.\n2.  **Boundary Conditions:** The use of integration by parts is only valid because the boundary terms vanish. For a bosonic field, the periodic boundary condition $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\tau+\\beta, \\vec{x})$ is essential for the time-like boundary terms to cancel.\n3.  **Operator Notation:** The notation $D_\\phi$ is slightly ambiguous. A clearer notation would be $D\\phi$, where $D$ is the operator. However, in the context of the quadratic form of an action, $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is understood to mean $(\\phi, D\\phi)$.\n4.  **Free Theory:** The operator $D$ is defined from the quadratic (free) part of the action. The interaction terms $V(\\phi)$ are not part of this fundamental inner product structure and are treated as perturbations over this Gaussian background.\n5.  **Fourier (Matsubara) Representation:** In practical calculations, one expands the field $\\phi$ in a Fourier basis. The operator $D$ becomes diagonal in this basis, with eigenvalues $(2\\pi n T)^2 + |\\vec{k}|^2 + m^2$, where $k_n=2\\pi n T$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies. The inner product then becomes a sum over these modes.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The starting point is the Euclidean action for a free scalar field:\n    $S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_E \\phi)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n2.  Integration by parts is applied to the kinetic term, using the periodic boundary conditions for the scalar field in the compactified time dimension to eliminate boundary terms:\n    $\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_E \\phi)^2 = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(-\\partial_E^2)\\phi$\n3.  The action is rewritten in a quadratic form:\n    $S_E^{(0)}[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x)[-\\partial_E^2 + m^2]\\phi(x)$\n4.  This is recognized as $\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi, D\\phi)$, where the inner product is $(\\psi, \\chi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\psi(x)\\chi(x)$ and the operator is $D = -\\partial_E^2 + m^2$.\n5.  The quantity $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is therefore this full quadratic expression:\n    $(\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x)[-\\partial_E^2 + m^2]\\phi(x)$\n6.  Writing this out explicitly with the definitions $\\partial_E^2 = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\vec{\\nabla}^2$ and $d^4x_E = d\\tau d^3x$ gives the final answer.\n\n<<<The inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$ is given by the expression:\n$$ (\\phi, D_\\phi) = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) \\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial\\tau^2} - \\vec{\\nabla}^2 + m^2\\right) \\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x}) $$\nThis quantity is equal to twice the free part of the Euclidean action, $2S_E^{(0)}[\\phi]$.>>>"
