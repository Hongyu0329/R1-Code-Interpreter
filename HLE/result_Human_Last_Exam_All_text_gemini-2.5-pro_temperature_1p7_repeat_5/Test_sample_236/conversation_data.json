    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the fundamental concepts\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_3^H$):** This is an abelian group whose elements are equivalence classes of oriented 3-dimensional homology spheres. Two homology spheres $M_1$ and $M_2$ are equivalent (homology cobordant) if the disjoint union $M_1 \\cup -M_2$ bounds a 4-dimensional homology cylinder. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot:** Given a knot $K \\subset S^3$, an integral surgery is a procedure that creates a new 3-manifold, denoted $S_p^3(K)$ for some integer $p$. For $S_p^3(K)$ to be a homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S_p^3(K); \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, must be trivial. This requires $|p|=1$. Therefore, we only need to consider $+1$ and $-1$ surgeries on knots.\n*   **Knots with at most four crossings:** We need to consider all such knots and their distinct mirror images. The knots are:\n    *   **0 crossings:** The unknot ($0_1$). It is amphichiral (its mirror image is equivalent to itself).\n    *   **3 crossings:** The trefoil knot ($3_1$). It is chiral, so we must consider the right-handed trefoil (RHT) and the left-handed trefoil (LHT) separately.\n    *   **4 crossings:** The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). It is amphichiral.\n\n### Step 2: List the surgeries and the resulting manifolds\n\nWe perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of the distinct knots identified above.\n\n1.  **Unknot ($0_1$):**\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(0_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(0_1)$ both result in the 3-sphere, $S^3$. This represents the identity element in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n2.  **Right-Handed Trefoil (RHT, or $+3_1$):**\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(\\text{RHT})$ is the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(\\text{RHT})$ is the Poincaré homology sphere, $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n\n3.  **Left-Handed Trefoil (LHT, or $-3_1$):**\n    The LHT is the mirror image of the RHT ($LHT = m(RHT)$). There is a general formula relating surgery on a knot and its mirror: $S_p^3(m(K)) = -S_{-p}^3(K)$, where the minus sign denotes orientation reversal.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(\\text{LHT}) = -S_{-1}^3(\\text{RHT}) = -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(\\text{LHT}) = -S_{+1}^3(\\text{RHT}) = -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n\n4.  **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$):**\n    The figure-eight knot is a *slice knot*, meaning it bounds a smooth disk in the 4-ball. A key theorem states that any integer surgery on a slice knot produces a 3-manifold that is homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$ is homology cobordant to $S^3$.\n    Both represent the identity element in $\\Theta_3^H$.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the resulting manifolds into homology cobordism classes\n\nWe have produced the following manifolds: $S^3, \\Sigma(2,3,5), \\Sigma(2,3,7), -\\Sigma(2,3,5), -\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, plus two that are cobordant to $S^3$. To distinguish their homology cobordism classes, we use the d-invariants from Heegaard Floer homology. The invariant is the multiset of d-invariant values over all spin-c structures.\n\n*   **For $S^3$ and surgeries on $4_1$:** The d-invariants are all zero. The multiset of values is `{0}`. This corresponds to the **identity class**.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and its related surgeries:**\n    *   The multiset of d-invariant values for $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ is known to be `{0, 2}`.\n    *   For the oppositely oriented manifold $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$, the d-values are the negatives of the original values. So the multiset is `{0, -2}`.\n\n*   **For $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ and its related surgeries:**\n    *   The multiset of d-invariant values for $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$ is known to be `{0, -2}`.\n    *   For $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$, the multiset is `{0, -(-2)} = {0, 2}`.\n\n### Step 4: Count the distinct homology cobordism classes\n\nLet's summarize which surgery produces which class, identified by its multiset of d-invariant values:\n\n*   **Class 1 (d-values = {0}):**\n    *   $S_{\\pm 1}^3(0_1)$\n    *   $S_{\\pm 1}^3(4_1)$\n\n*   **Class 2 (d-values = {0, 2}):**\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(\\text{RHT})$ which is $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(\\text{LHT})$ which is $-\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n\n*   **Class 3 (d-values = {0, -2}):**\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(\\text{RHT})$ which is $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(\\text{LHT})$ which is $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n\nThe three multisets of d-invariant values—`{0}`, `{0, 2}`, and `{0, -2}`—are distinct. Therefore, the surgeries on knots with at most four crossings generate exactly three distinct elements in the homology cobordism group.\n\nThese elements are:\n1.  The identity element.\n2.  The class represented by the Poincaré sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$.\n3.  The class represented by the Brieskorn sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,7)$.\n\nFinal Answer: We have found 3 distinct elements.\n\n>>>3"
