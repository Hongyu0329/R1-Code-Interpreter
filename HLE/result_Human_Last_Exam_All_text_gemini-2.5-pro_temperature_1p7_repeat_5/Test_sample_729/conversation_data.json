    "An analysis of the question of finding the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128 is denoted by $Q_{128}$. In general, the group $Q_{2^n}$ of order $2^n$ (for $n \\ge 3$) has the presentation:\n    $Q_{2^n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2^{n-1}} = 1, x^{2^{n-2}} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For size 128, we have $2^n = 128$, so $n=7$. The group is:\n    $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, yxy^{-1} = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    The group has 128 elements. These can be partitioned into two sets:\n    *   The elements $\\{x^k \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$, which form a cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n    *   The elements $\\{yx^k \\mid k = 0, 1, \\dots, 63\\}$, which form the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n2.  **Understanding \"Power Subgroup\":** A power subgroup is a subgroup that can be generated by a single element. In other words, a power subgroup is a **cyclic subgroup**. The question asks for the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $Q_{128}$.\n\n3.  **Strategy:** We can find all cyclic subgroups by considering the subgroups generated by each element of $Q_{128}$. A practical approach is to partition the elements into the two sets mentioned above ($\\langle x \\rangle$ and $y\\langle x \\rangle$) and count the distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements from each set.\n\n**Careful Points and Execution:**\n\n**Part A: Cyclic subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\n*   The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64, which is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}_{64}$.\n*   **Careful Point:** A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that for any cyclic group of order $N$, there is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of $N$.\n*   We need to find the number of divisors of 64. Since $64 = 2^6$, its divisors are $2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6$.\n*   These divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.\n*   The number of divisors is $\\tau(64) = 6+1 = 7$.\n*   Thus, there are **7** distinct cyclic subgroups contained entirely within $\\langle x \\rangle$. These are $\\langle x^0 \\rangle$ (order 1), $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (order 2), $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (order 4), $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (order 8), $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (order 16), $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (order 32), and $\\langle x \\rangle$ (order 64).\n\n**Part B: Cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$**\n\n*   These subgroups must be generated by elements from the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$, i.e., elements of the form $g = yx^k$.\n*   **Careful Point:** First, we need to determine the order of these elements.\n    Let's compute the square of $g = yx^k$:\n    $(yx^k)^2 = yx^k yx^k$. Using the relation $x^ky = yx^{-k}$ (derived from $yxy^{-1}=x^{-1}$), we get:\n    $(yx^k)^2 = y(x^k y)x^k = y(yx^{-k})x^k = y^2 x^{-k}x^k = y^2$.\n    From the group definition, $y^2 = x^{32}$. So, $(yx^k)^2 = x^{32}$.\n    The element $x^{32}$ has order 2, since $(x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n    Therefore, $(yx^k)^4 = ((yx^k)^2)^2 = (x^{32})^2 = 1$.\n    This shows that every element $yx^k$ has order 4.\n*   So, all cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$ are of order 4.\n*   **Careful Point:** We need to count the number of *distinct* subgroups. Multiple elements can generate the same subgroup.\n    There are 64 elements of the form $yx^k$ (for $k=0, \\dots, 63$).\n    Let $H = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$ be a cyclic subgroup of order 4. The number of generators in a cyclic group of order $m$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$.\n    For order 4, $\\phi(4) = \\phi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2^1 = 2$.\n    The two generators of $H = \\langle yx^k \\rangle$ are $yx^k$ and $(yx^k)^3$.\n    $(yx^k)^3 = (yx^k)^2(yx^k) = x^{32}yx^k = yx^{-32}x^k = yx^{k-32}$. Since powers of x are modulo 64, this is equivalent to $yx^{k+32}$.\n    So, the subgroup $\\langle yx^k \\rangle$ is the same as the subgroup $\\langle yx^{k+32} \\rangle$.\n*   Each distinct cyclic subgroup of this type has two generators. Since there are 64 such elements in total, the number of distinct subgroups is the total number of elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup:\n    Number of subgroups = $64 / 2 = 32$.\n*   Thus, there are **32** distinct cyclic subgroups generated by elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n\n**Part C: Total Count**\n\n*   We have found two disjoint sets of cyclic subgroups:\n    1.  The 7 subgroups contained within $\\langle x \\rangle$.\n    2.  The 32 subgroups generated by elements in $y\\langle x \\rangle$.\n*   **Careful Point:** We must confirm these two sets are disjoint. A subgroup from the first set contains only powers of $x$. A subgroup from the second set, like $\\langle yx^k \\rangle = \\{1, yx^k, x^{32}, yx^{k+32}\\}$, always contains elements (like $yx^k$) that are not powers of $x$. Therefore, no subgroup can be in both sets. The sets are disjoint.\n*   The total number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) is the sum of the counts from Part A and Part B.\n    Total = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Summary:**\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups in $\\langle x \\rangle \\cong C_{64}$: $\\tau(64) = 7$.\n*   Number of cyclic subgroups not in $\\langle x \\rangle$: Generated by the 64 elements of order 4 in the coset $y\\langle x \\rangle$. Each such group has 2 generators. So, $64/2=32$ subgroups.\n*   Total number = $7 + 32 = 39$.\n\n<<<39>>>"
