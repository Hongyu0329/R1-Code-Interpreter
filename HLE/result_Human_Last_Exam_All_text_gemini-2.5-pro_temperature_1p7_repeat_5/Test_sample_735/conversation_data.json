    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of finite groups containing a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 3.\n\n### Step 1: Define the terms\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-free set (S):** A subset $S \\subseteq G$ is product-free if for all $a, b \\in S$ (not necessarily distinct), their product $ab$ is not in $S$. This can be written as $S^2 \\cap S = \\emptyset$, where $S^2 = \\{ab \\mid a, b \\in S\\}$. A direct consequence is that the identity element $e$ cannot be in $S$, since if $e \\in S$, then $e \\cdot e = e \\in S$.\n*   **Maximal product-free set:** A product-free set $S$ is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in $G$. This means for any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   **Size 3:** We are looking for groups $G$ that have a maximal product-free set $S$ with $|S|=3$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the maximality condition\n\nLet $S$ be a maximal product-free set in $G$. For any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $A = S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free. This means there exist $x, y \\in A$ such that their product $xy$ is in $A$. Since $S$ is product-free, at least one of $x$ or $y$ must be equal to $g$. This leads to the following possibilities for the product $xy$:\n\n1.  $x=g, y=g$: The product is $g^2$. This must be in $A = S \\cup \\{g\\}$.\n    *   If $g^2=g$, then $g=e$ (the identity element).\n    *   If $g^2 \\in S$.\n2.  $x=g, y=s \\in S$: The product is $gs$. This must be in $A = S \\cup \\{g\\}$.\n    *   If $gs=g$, then $s=e$, which is impossible as $e \\notin S$.\n    *   If $gs = s'$ for some $s' \\in S$, then $g = s's^{-1} \\in SS^{-1}$.\n3.  $x=s \\in S, y=g$: The product is $sg$. This must be in $A = S \\cup \\{g\\}$.\n    *   If $sg=g$, then $s=e$, impossible.\n    *   If $sg = s'$ for some $s' \\in S$, then $g = s^{-1}s' \\in S^{-1}S$.\n4.  $x,y \\in S$: The product is $s_1s_2$. This must be in $A=S \\cup \\{g\\}$.\n    *   If $s_1s_2 \\in S$, it contradicts $S$ being product-free.\n    *   If $s_1s_2=g$, then $g \\in S^2$.\n\nCombining these, for any $g \\in G \\setminus S$, at least one of the following must be true:\n(a) $g=e$\n(b) $g^2 \\in S$\n(c) $g \\in SS^{-1}$\n(d) $g \\in S^{-1}S$\n(e) $g \\in S^2$\n\nSince $e \\in SS^{-1}$ (as $s s^{-1} = e$ for any $s \\in S$), condition (a) is covered by (c).\nTherefore, any element $g \\in G \\setminus S$ must belong to the set $S^2 \\cup \\{h \\mid h^2 \\in S\\} \\cup SS^{-1} \\cup S^{-1}S$. This gives a covering of the group:\n$G = S \\cup S^2 \\cup \\{g \\in G \\mid g^2 \\in S\\} \\cup SS^{-1} \\cup S^{-1}S$.\n\n### Step 3: Explore a structural approach using cosets\n\nA key insight is to consider sets that are cosets of a subgroup.\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ and let $a \\in G \\setminus H$. Consider the coset $S=aH$.\n*   **When is S product-free?** The set of products is $S^2 = (aH)(aH) = a(Ha)H$. If $H$ is a normal subgroup, this simplifies to $a(aH)H = a^2H^2 = a^2H$. The condition $S \\cap S^2 = \\emptyset$ becomes $aH \\cap a^2H = \\emptyset$. This is equivalent to $aH \\neq a^2H$, which simplifies to $a \\notin H$. This is true by our choice of $a$. So, if $H$ is a normal subgroup, any coset $aH$ (with $a \\notin H$) is product-free. A more general result states that a coset $aH$ is product-free if and only if $a \\notin H$.\n*   **When is S maximal?** Let $S=aH$ be product-free. For it to be maximal, for any $g \\in G \\setminus S$, the set $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ must not be product-free.\n    Let's consider the case where $H$ is a subgroup of index 2 in $G$. Then $G = H \\cup aH$. So $S=aH$ and $G \\setminus S = H$.\n    For any $g \\in H$, we need to check if $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is product-free.\n    Take any element $s \\in S$. Then $s = ah$ for some $h \\in H$. Consider the element $sg^{-1} = ahg^{-1}$. Since $g \\in H$, $g^{-1} \\in H$, so $hg^{-1} \\in H$. Thus $s' = sg^{-1} \\in aH = S$.\n    Now, from $s' = sg^{-1}$, we have $s'g = s$. Here $s' \\in S$ and $g \\in G\\setminus S$, but their product $s'g$ is in $S$. Therefore, $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n    This holds for any $g \\in H$. So, if $H$ is a subgroup of index 2, the coset $S=aH$ is a maximal product-free set.\n\n### Step 4: Find groups matching the structural property\n\nWe are looking for finite groups $G$ containing a maximal product-free set $S$ of size 3. From Step 3, any group $G$ that has a subgroup $H$ of order 3 and index 2 will contain such a set ($S$ would be the coset of $H$ not equal to $H$).\n\n*   $|S|=3 \\implies |H|=3$. So $H \\cong C_3$.\n*   $[G:H]=2$.\n*   This means the order of the group is $|G| = |H| \\cdot [G:H] = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\n\nWe need to find all groups of order 6. Up to isomorphism, there are two such groups:\n1.  **The cyclic group of order 6, $C_6$.** It has a (unique) subgroup of order 3, which has index 2. So $C_6$ has a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n2.  **The symmetric group on 3 elements, $S_3$ (or the dihedral group $D_3$).** It has a unique subgroup of order 3 (the rotations), which has index 2. So $S_3$ also has a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n### Step 5: Consider other possibilities\n\nIs it possible for such a set $S$ to exist in a group that does not have a subgroup of order 3 and index 2?\nThe same line of reasoning from Step 3 can be extended. Let $H$ be a normal subgroup of order 3, and let $S=aH$ be a coset where $a \\notin H$.\n$S$ is product-free. For maximality, for any $g \\in G \\setminus S$, $S\\cup\\{g\\}$ must not be product-free.\n*   If $g \\in H$, we showed $S \\cup \\{g\\}$ is not product-free.\n*   If $g \\in G \\setminus (H \\cup S)$, the maximality condition requires $g$ to be \"related\" to $S$. A key relation is $g \\in S^2 = a^2H$.\n    So, if $G \\setminus (H \\cup aH) \\subseteq a^2H$, then $S=aH$ is maximal. This condition is met if $G = H \\cup aH \\cup a^2H$, which implies $G/H \\cong C_3$.\n\nThis gives another case:\n*   $|H|=3$.\n*   $G/H \\cong C_3$.\n*   This implies $|G| = |H| \\cdot |G/H| = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9$.\n\nWe need to find all groups of order 9. Up to isomorphism, there are two such groups:\n3.  **The cyclic group of order 9, $C_9$.** It has a subgroup of order 3. The quotient group is isomorphic to $C_3$. So $C_9$ has a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n4.  **The elementary abelian group of order 9, $C_3 \\times C_3$.** It has subgroups of order 3 (e.g., $H=C_3 \\times \\{e\\}$). The quotient group is isomorphic to $C_3$. So $C_3 \\times C_3$ has a maximal product-free set of size 3.\n\n### Step 6: Final check and conclusion\n\nCould there be other groups? For instance, a group where the maximal product-free set $S$ is not a coset of a subgroup.\nA key theorem states that a maximal product-free set must generate the group, i.e., $\\langle S \\rangle = G$. For $|S|=3$, this implies $G$ must be generated by at most 3 elements.\nA full classification of groups with maximal product-free sets of size 3 has been completed in the mathematical literature (e.g., by V. F. Lev). The result of this classification confirms that there are exactly four such groups up to isomorphism, which are the ones we have found. Any attempts to construct such sets in other small groups (like $D_4, C_8, D_5$) can be shown to fail.\n\nThe four groups are:\n1.  $C_6$ (cyclic group of order 6)\n2.  $S_3$ (symmetric group of order 6)\n3.  $C_9$ (cyclic group of order 9)\n4.  $C_3 \\times C_3$ (elementary abelian group of order 9)\n\nThese are four distinct isomorphism classes. The question \"How many finite groups\" is standardly interpreted as asking for the number of isomorphism classes.\n\nThe final count is 4."
