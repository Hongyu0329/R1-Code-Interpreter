    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Key Concepts\n\n*   **All-or-Nothing Vaccine:** This type of vaccine works by conferring complete immunity to a certain fraction of the vaccinated population, while providing no protection to the rest.\n    *   Let `p` be the proportion of vaccinated individuals who are fully protected (immune).\n    *   The remaining `(1-p)` proportion of vaccinated individuals are not protected and remain as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\n*   **Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_pe):** This measures the proportional reduction in the risk of infection from a single exposure to the pathogen, for a vaccinated person compared to an unvaccinated person.\n    *   Let `λ` be the probability of infection for a susceptible person upon a single exposure.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate (IR):** This is the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population over a specific period. It is typically calculated as `(Number of new cases) / (Total person-time at risk)`.\n\n*   **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR):** This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`).\n    *   `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`\n\n*   **The Estimator:** The question asks about the estimator `1 - IRR`. This is a common formula used to calculate vaccine efficacy from trial or observational data.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the \"True\" Per-Exposure Vaccine Efficacy (VE_pe)\n\nWe need to determine the theoretical value of VE_pe for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\n1.  **Risk for an unvaccinated person:** The probability of infection per exposure is `λ`.\n2.  **Risk for a vaccinated person:** This is an average risk across the entire vaccinated group.\n    *   A proportion `p` are immune, so their risk of infection is `0`.\n    *   A proportion `(1-p)` are susceptible, so their risk of infection is `λ`.\n    *   The average risk of infection per exposure for a randomly chosen vaccinated person is: `(p * 0) + ((1-p) * λ) = (1-p)λ`.\n3.  **Calculate VE_pe:** VE_pe is the proportional reduction in risk.\n    *   `VE_pe = (Risk_unvaccinated - Risk_vaccinated) / Risk_unvaccinated`\n    *   `VE_pe = (λ - (1-p)λ) / λ`\n    *   `VE_pe = λ(1 - (1-p)) / λ`\n    *   `VE_pe = 1 - 1 + p`\n    *   `VE_pe = p`\n\n**Careful Point 1:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the per-exposure vaccine efficacy is exactly equal to `p`, the proportion of the vaccinated population that becomes fully immune.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Estimated Efficacy using the Incidence Rate Ratio (1 - IRR)\n\nNow, let's see what value the `1 - IRR` formula would produce in a population study.\n\n1.  **Model the Incidence Rates:** Let `h` represent the force of infection, which is the instantaneous rate at which a susceptible individual becomes infected.\n    *   **Incidence Rate in Unvaccinated (IR_u):** The entire unvaccinated group is susceptible. Therefore, their incidence rate is equal to the force of infection, `h`.\n        *   `IR_u = h`\n    *   **Incidence Rate in Vaccinated (IR_v):** The vaccinated group is a mixture.\n        *   The proportion `p` that is immune contributes person-time but will never become a case (their infection rate is 0).\n        *   The proportion `(1-p)` that is susceptible is subject to the same force of infection `h` as the unvaccinated group.\n        *   The overall incidence rate for the entire vaccinated group is the average rate across all its members: `(p * 0) + ((1-p) * h) = (1-p)h`.\n        *   `IR_v = (1-p)h`\n\n**Careful Point 2:** The incidence rate in the vaccinated group is not zero. It is reduced from the baseline rate `h` by a factor of `(1-p)` because only that fraction of the group is at risk of infection.\n\n2.  **Calculate the IRR:**\n    *   `IRR = IR_v / IR_u`\n    *   `IRR = ((1-p)h) / h`\n    *   `IRR = 1-p`\n\n3.  **Calculate the estimator `1 - IRR`:**\n    *   Estimator = `1 - IRR`\n    *   Estimator = `1 - (1-p)`\n    *   Estimator = `p`\n\n### Step 4: Compare the True Value and the Estimated Value\n\n*   The true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_pe`) is `p`.\n*   The estimated efficacy from the `1 - IRR` formula is also `p`.\n\nSince the estimated value (`p`) is equal to the true value (`p`), the estimator is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:** For an all-or-nothing vaccine, the formula `1 - incidence rate ratio` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy.\n\n<<<C>>>"
