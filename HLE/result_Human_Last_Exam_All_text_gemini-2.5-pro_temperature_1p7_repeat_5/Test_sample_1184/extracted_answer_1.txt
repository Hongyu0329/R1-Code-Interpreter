**1. Hotspots for Interaction (Binding) in Beta-1 Subunit (CACNB1, UniProt P15381):**

These residues are located in the Beta Interaction Domain (BID) within the Guanylate Kinase-like (GK) domain and form the high-affinity binding pocket for the alpha-1 subunit's AID motif.

*   **Tyrosine 217 (Y217)**
*   **Leucine 221 (L221)**
*   **Tyrosine 245 (Y245)**
*   **Valine 249 (V249)**
*   **Leucine 252 (L252)**
*   **Tryptophan 256 (W256)**
*   **Valine 325 (V325)**
*   **Leucine 328 (L328)**

**2. Hotspots for Gating Modulation in Beta-1 Subunit (CACNB1, UniProt P15381):**

These residues are located outside the primary BID and fine-tune the channel's biophysical properties after the initial binding event.

*   **N-Terminal Region (Residues 1-29):** The entire region, particularly its charged residues, is crucial for modulating the voltage-dependence of activation. Key examples within this region include:
    *   **Aspartic Acid 6 (D6)**
    *   **Glutamic Acid 10 (E10)**
*   **SH3 Domain:** This domain makes secondary contacts to regulate channel function. Key residues on its interaction surface include:
    *   **Tryptophan 187 (W187)**
    *   **Tyrosine 139 (Y139)**
    *   **Tyrosine 189 (Y189)**
