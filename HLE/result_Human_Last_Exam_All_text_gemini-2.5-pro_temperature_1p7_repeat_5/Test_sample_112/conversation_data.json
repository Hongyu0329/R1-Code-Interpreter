    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question is about the poem \"Sir Launfal\" and a specific type of book it was preserved with. It's important to identify the correct \"Sir Launfal,\" as there is more than one version. The most famous is the 14th-century Middle English romance by Thomas Cheke.\n\n2.  **Locate the Primary Source:** We need to find the manuscript in which Thomas Cheke's \"Sir Launfal\" survives. Historical and literary research shows that the poem exists in only one surviving manuscript.\n\n3.  **Identify the Manuscript:** The sole manuscript containing \"Sir Launfal\" is designated as **Cotton Caligula A.ii**. It is a famous medieval miscellany (a collection of various texts bound together) from the late 13th or early 14th century, now housed in the British Library.\n\n4.  **Examine the Contents of the Manuscript:** The next step is to look at the other works contained within the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript. This manuscript includes several significant Middle English works, such as:\n    *   *Layamon's Brut* (the longer version)\n    *   *The Owl and the Nightingale*\n    *   *Sir Launfal*\n    *   Various other religious and didactic poems.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"Book of Manners\":** The question specifically asks for a \"book of manners\" or a courtesy book. We must scan the contents of the manuscript for a text that fits this description. A \"book of manners\" is a work of didactic literature that teaches social etiquette, proper conduct, and morals.\n\n6.  **Pinpoint the Specific Work:** Among the texts in Cotton Caligula A.ii, there is a poem known as **\"The Goode Wif Taught Hyr Doughter\"** (Modern English: \"The Good Wife Taught Her Daughter\"). This work is a classic example of a medieval conduct book or \"book of manners,\" providing advice to a young woman on how to manage a household, behave in society, and be a good wife.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct \"Sir Launfal\":** Ensure we are talking about the Middle English poem by Thomas Cheke, not the later version by James Russell Lowell. The context of a medieval manuscript points to the former.\n*   **Singular Manuscript:** The fact that the poem survives in a single manuscript makes the question answerable with certainty.\n*   **Definition of \"Book of Manners\":** It's crucial to understand that this refers to a specific genre of medieval literature (conduct or courtesy books), not just any didactic or moral text. \"The Goode Wif Taught Hyr Doughter\" fits this definition perfectly. Other works in the manuscript, like *The Owl and the Nightingale*, are debates or allegories, not books of manners.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy following these steps, we can conclude that the poem \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript alongside several other works, the one fitting the description of a \"book of manners\" being \"The Goode Wif Taught Hyr Doughter\".\n\n<<<The Goode Wif Taught Hyr Doughter>>>"
