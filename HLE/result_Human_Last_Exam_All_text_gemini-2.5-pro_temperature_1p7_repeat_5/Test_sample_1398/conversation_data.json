    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Transformation:** The goal is to find a single, consistent rule that transforms each input grid into its corresponding output grid. The grids are 5x5 and contain binary values (0 or 1).\n\n2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** A common type of transformation for grid problems is a cellular automaton rule. This means the value of each cell in the output grid depends on the values of the cells in a small neighborhood around the corresponding cell in the input grid. The most common neighborhood is the Moore neighborhood, which includes the 8 cells immediately surrounding a central cell (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).\n\n3.  **Test the Hypothesis:** Let's assume the output value `O(r, c)` for a cell at row `r` and column `c` is a function of the input value `I(r, c)` and the sum of its 8 neighbors in the input grid.\n    *   Let's pick a cell from Input Grid 1: `I(0,0) = 0`. Its neighbors are `I(0,1)=1`, `I(1,0)=1`, `I(1,1)=0`. The sum of neighbors is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2. The corresponding output is `O(0,0) = 1`. This gives us a potential rule: `if I=0 and neighbor_sum=2, then O=1`.\n    *   Let's pick another cell: `I(0,1) = 1`. Its neighbors are `I(0,0)=0, I(0,2)=0, I(1,0)=1, I(1,1)=0, I(1,2)=0`. The sum of neighbors is 1. The output is `O(0,1) = 0`. This gives another rule: `if I=1 and neighbor_sum=1, then O=0`.\n\n4.  **Refine the Hypothesis:** Let's test if the input cell's own value `I(r,c)` matters at all.\n    *   From Grid 1: for `I(0,0)=0` with neighbor sum 2, the output is 1. So, `G(sum=2) -> 1`.\n    *   From Grid 1: for `I(1,3)=1` with neighbor sum 2 (neighbors are I(0,4)=1, I(2,2)=1), the output is `O(1,3)=1`. So, `G(sum=2) -> 1`.\n    *   It seems that regardless of whether the cell itself is 0 or 1, if its neighbor sum is 2, the output is 1.\n    *   Let's check this refined hypothesis: the output value of a cell depends *only* on the sum of its 8 neighbors.\n\n5.  **Verify the Refined Rule:** Let's build a mapping from `neighbor_sum` to `output_value` using all examples.\n    *   **Sum = 0:** Input 5, cell (4,0). All neighbors are 0. Sum = 0. Output is O(4,0) = 0. Rule: **Sum(0) -> 0**.\n    *   **Sum = 1:** Input 3, cell (0,0). Neighbors sum is 1. Output is O(0,0) = 0. Rule: **Sum(1) -> 0**.\n    *   **Sum = 2:** Input 1, cell (0,0). Neighbors sum is 2. Output is O(0,0) = 1. Rule: **Sum(2) -> 1**.\n    *   **Sum = 3:** Input 1, cell (1,1). Neighbors sum is 3. Output is O(1,1) = 1. Rule: **Sum(3) -> 1**.\n    *   **Sum = 4:** Input 4, cell (1,1). Neighbors sum is 4. Output is O(1,1) = 0. Rule: **Sum(4) -> 0**.\n    *   **Sum = 5, 6, 7:** There are no clear examples of these sums in the provided grids.\n    *   **Sum = 8:** Input 5, cell (2,2). All 8 neighbors are 1. Sum = 8. Output is O(2,2) = 0. Rule: **Sum(8) -> 0**.\n\n6.  **Final Rule:** The pattern is clear. The output cell is `1` if the sum of its 8 neighbors in the input grid is exactly 2 or 3. For all other neighbor sums, the output cell is `0`. This rule is independent of the cell's own value in the input grid.\n\n7.  **Apply the Rule to the Test Input Grid:**\n\n    **Test Input Grid 6:**\n    ```\n    [0 1 1 0 0]\n    [1 0 0 1 0]\n    [1 0 1 0 1]\n    [0 1 0 0 1]\n    [1 0 1 1 0]\n    ```\n\n    We will calculate the sum of 8 neighbors for each cell and apply the rule `Output = 1 if sum is 2 or 3, else 0`.\n\n    *   `O(0,0)`: Neighbors sum `I(0,1)+I(1,0)+I(1,1)` = 1+1+0 = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(0,1)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(0,2)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(0,3)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(0,4)`: Neighbors sum = 1. -> **0**\n\n    *   `O(1,0)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(1,1)`: Neighbors sum = 5. -> **0**\n    *   `O(1,2)`: Neighbors sum = 4. -> **0**\n    *   `O(1,3)`: Neighbors sum = 3. -> **1**\n    *   `O(1,4)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n\n    *   `O(2,0)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(2,1)`: Neighbors sum = 4. -> **0**\n    *   `O(2,2)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(2,3)`: Neighbors sum = 4. -> **0**\n    *   `O(2,4)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n\n    *   `O(3,0)`: Neighbors sum = 3. -> **1**\n    *   `O(3,1)`: Neighbors sum = 4. -> **0**\n    *   `O(3,2)`: Neighbors sum = 4. -> **0**\n    *   `O(3,3)`: Neighbors sum = 5. -> **0**\n    *   `O(3,4)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n\n    *   `O(4,0)`: Neighbors sum = 1. -> **0**\n    *   `O(4,1)`: Neighbors sum = 3. -> **1**\n    *   `O(4,2)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(4,3)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n    *   `O(4,4)`: Neighbors sum = 2. -> **1**\n\n8.  **Construct the Final Output Grid:**\n\n    ```\n    [1 1 1 1 0]\n    [1 0 0 1 1]\n    [1 0 1 0 1]\n    [1 0 0 0 1]\n    [0 1 1 1 1]\n    ```\n\n9.  **Format the Answer:** Concatenate the rows into a single 25-digit binary string.\n    `11110` + `10011` + `10101` + `10001` + `01111` = `1111010011101011000101111`\n\n<<<1111010011101011000101111>>>"
