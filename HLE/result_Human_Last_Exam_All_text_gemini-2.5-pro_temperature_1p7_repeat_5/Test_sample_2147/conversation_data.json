    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figure:** The question centers on Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943). He was a prominent Russian historian, publicist, and liberal politician. He was the founder and leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets). Understanding his intellectual background is crucial. Milyukov was a product of 19th-century Russian intellectualism, valuing rationalism, positivism, and the idea that culture should serve a civic, progressive purpose.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Core Accusation:** Milyukov is said to have \"accused the Western culture of his time.\" This points to a specific period, namely the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time of significant cultural upheaval and the rise of modernism. His criticism was not of Western culture in general, but of its contemporary modernist trends which were being enthusiastically adopted and adapted in Russia.\n\n3.  **Deconstruct the Metaphor:** The phrase \"stagnant swamp\" is a powerful metaphor. It implies something that is decaying, foul, lifeless, and cut off from the dynamic, flowing river of healthy life and progress. This suggests Milyukov saw the target of his criticism as unproductive, self-indulgent, and disconnected from the important social and political realities of the time.\n\n4.  **Connect Milyukov's Views to the Metaphor:** Given Milyukov's belief in rational, socially-engaged culture, he was deeply hostile to the new artistic and literary movements of the Russian \"Silver Age.\" These movements, primarily Symbolism and its associated trend, Decadence, rejected the 19th-century realist tradition. Instead, they focused on mysticism, individualism, eroticism, aestheticism (\"art for art's sake\"), and morbid themes.\n\n5.  **Identify \"X-Y\":** The cultural actors Milyukov targeted are frequently referred to collectively as the **Symbolist-Decadents**. From his perspective, their focus on the inner world, the mystical, and the purely aesthetic was a retreat from the artist's civic duty. He saw their work not as a step forward, but as a form of cultural decayâ€”a \"stagnant swamp\" that offered no nourishment for social progress. His criticism was a defense of the older, enlightenment-inspired tradition against what he perceived as the irrational and antisocial chaos of modernism.\n\n**Final Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Context is Key:** Milyukov's political liberalism did not extend to his cultural tastes; he was a cultural conservative.\n*   **Specific Target:** While he disliked modernism in general, his most famous and articulate critiques were aimed at the Symbolist and Decadent movements that dominated the intellectual scene in Russia from the 1890s through the 1910s.\n*   **\"X-Y\" format:** The placeholder \"X-Y\" strongly suggests a compound noun or a two-word phrase used as a single label, which \"Symbolist-Decadents\" fits perfectly.\n\nBy putting these pieces together, we can confidently identify X-Y as the label for the group Milyukov was denouncing.\n\n<<<Symbolist-Decadents>>>"
