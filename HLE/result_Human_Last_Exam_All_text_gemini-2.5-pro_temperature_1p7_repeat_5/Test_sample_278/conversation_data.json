    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the area of the smallest square that circumscribes the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the parametric curve definition**\nThe curve is defined in a piecewise manner based on the parameter `t`:\n$x = \\cos(t)$\n$y = b \\sin(t)$\nwhere\n- for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $b = 1$.\n- for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $b = 5$.\n\n**Step 2: Characterize the curve for each interval**\n\n*   **For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$:**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = \\sin(t)$.\n    This is the standard parameterization of a unit circle. Since $t$ ranges from $0$ to $\\pi$, $\\sin(t) \\ge 0$, which means this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.\n    *   At $t=0$: $(x,y) = (\\cos(0), \\sin(0)) = (1,0)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi/2$: $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\pi/2), \\sin(\\pi/2)) = (0,1)$.\n    *   At $t=\\pi$: $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\pi), \\sin(\\pi)) = (-1,0)$.\n\n*   **For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$:**\n    The equations are $x = \\cos(t)$ and $y = 5\\sin(t)$.\n    We can write this as $x^2 = \\cos^2(t)$ and $(y/5)^2 = \\sin^2(t)$. Using the identity $\\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$, we get the equation of an ellipse: $x^2 + (y/5)^2 = 1$.\n    Since $t$ ranges from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $\\sin(t) \\le 0$, which means $y \\le 0$. This part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse.\n    *   As $t \\to \\pi^+$: $(x,y) \\to (\\cos(\\pi), 5\\sin(\\pi)) = (-1,0)$.\n    *   At $t=3\\pi/2$: $(x,y) = (\\cos(3\\pi/2), 5\\sin(3\\pi/2)) = (0, -5)$.\n    *   As $t \\to 2\\pi^-$: $(x,y) \\to (\\cos(2\\pi), 5\\sin(2\\pi)) = (1,0)$.\n\nThe complete figure is composed of an upper semi-circle and a lower semi-ellipse, joined at the points $(-1,0)$ and $(1,0)$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the bounding box of the figure**\nTo find the smallest circumscribing square (assuming its sides are parallel to the coordinate axes), we first need to find the minimum and maximum values for the x and y coordinates. This defines the smallest rectangle, or \"bounding box\", that contains the figure.\n\n*   **Range of x-coordinates:**\n    For the entire interval $t \\in [0, 2\\pi)$, the x-coordinate is given by $x = \\cos(t)$. The cosine function has a minimum value of -1 and a maximum value of 1.\n    $x_{min} = -1$\n    $x_{max} = 1$\n    The width of the bounding box is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Range of y-coordinates:**\n    We need to consider both parts of the curve.\n    - For $t \\in [0, \\pi]$, $y = \\sin(t)$. The maximum value is $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and the minimum value is $\\sin(0) = \\sin(\\pi) = 0$. The range is $[0, 1]$.\n    - For $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$, $y = 5\\sin(t)$. The minimum value is $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = 5(-1) = -5$ and the maximum value is $0$. The range is $[-5, 0]$.\n    Combining these two ranges, the overall minimum y-value is -5 and the overall maximum y-value is 1.\n    $y_{min} = -5$\n    $y_{max} = 1$\n    The height of the bounding box is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Find the smallest circumscribing square**\nThe figure is contained within a rectangle of width 2 and height 6. A square that contains this rectangle must have a side length, `s`, that is at least as large as both the width and the height of the rectangle.\n$s \\ge W \\implies s \\ge 2$\n$s \\ge H \\implies s \\ge 6$\nTo satisfy both conditions, the side length `s` must be at least 6. The smallest possible side length for the circumscribing square is therefore the maximum of the width and height.\n$s = \\max(W, H) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the square**\nThe area of a square with side length `s` is $s^2$.\nArea = $s^2 = 6^2 = 36$."
