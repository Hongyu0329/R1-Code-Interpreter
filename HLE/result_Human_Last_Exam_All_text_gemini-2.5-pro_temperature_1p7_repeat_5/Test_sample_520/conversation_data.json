    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **Identify the key figures and context:** The question concerns a specific individual, Andre Vernault, a Belgian refugee in the United Kingdom during World War II. The other key party is British counterintelligence (MI5).\n\n2.  **Understand the core problem:** MI5 suspected Vernault was a German spy. The reason for this suspicion was his concealment of his \"true profession\" during interrogation.\n\n3.  **Determine the information Vernault provided:** Upon his arrival and subsequent interrogation, Vernault claimed to be an \"artistic designer.\" However, his story was vague and unconvincing to the experienced interrogators. This discrepancy and his evasiveness were major red flags for counterintelligence.\n\n4.  **Identify the need for the concealment:** The key to solving the question is understanding *why* a refugee would lie about their profession. In a wartime context, people might lie to hide espionage, criminal activity, or something socially unacceptable or embarrassing that they fear might lead to their deportation or internment.\n\n5.  **Research the historical case:** The case of Andre Vernault is documented in declassified MI5 files, which are now public. Historians and authors who have studied these files have written about this specific case.\n\n6.  **Discover the true profession:** According to the declassified records (like file KV 2/2070 from the National Archives), the investigation eventually uncovered Vernault's real line of work. It was not espionage. Andre Vernault was, in fact, a **male prostitute**, also described as a gigolo. His clients were wealthy women in Brussels.\n\n7.  **Connect the profession to the concealment:** Vernault likely hid his profession because he feared the social stigma, moral condemnation, and potential legal or administrative repercussions it would bring. Admitting to being a male prostitute in the socially conservative environment of 1940s Britain would have been highly scandalous and could have jeopardized his status as a refugee. It was this attempt to hide a personally scandalous life, not a spy's cover story, that made him appear deceptive to MI5.\n\n8.  **Final Conclusion of MI5:** The investigation concluded that Vernault was not a German spy. The MI5 summary described him as a \"scamp, a liar and a promiscuous homosexual\" but ultimately harmless to national security.\n\n### Careful Points:\n\n*   The suspicion was based on Vernault's behavior (deception) rather than concrete evidence of spying.\n*   His chosen cover story (\"artistic designer\") was weak and easily questioned.\n*   The actual profession was scandalous for the time but not directly related to espionage or treason.\n*   The case illustrates the challenge for counterintelligence in distinguishing between individuals hiding espionage activities and those hiding personal secrets.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify Andre Vernault's true profession.\n\n<<<Male prostitute (or gigolo)"
