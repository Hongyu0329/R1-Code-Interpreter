    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the coldest temperature for efficient Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4) synthesis.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Synthesis of Xenon Tetrafluoride (XeF4)**\n\nThe most common and practical method for producing Xenon tetrafluoride is the direct chemical reaction between Xenon (Xe) gas and Fluorine (F2) gas. The balanced chemical equation for the primary reaction is:\n\nXe(g) + 2F2(g) → XeF4(s)\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Factors Affecting the Reaction**\n\nSeveral factors influence the outcome of this synthesis, but temperature is the most critical one for this question.\n\n*   **Kinetics (Reaction Rate):** This reaction, like many, has an activation energy barrier. Heat is required to provide the energy needed to break the strong F-F bonds in the fluorine molecules and allow the reaction to proceed at a practical rate. At very low temperatures, the reaction is kinetically hindered, meaning it happens too slowly to be useful.\n*   **Thermodynamics & Selectivity (Product Formed):** The reaction is exothermic (it releases heat). According to Le Chatelier's principle, lower temperatures thermodynamically favor the formation of the product. However, temperature also affects which xenon fluoride is formed:\n    *   **Low Temperature / Excess Xe:** Favors the formation of Xenon difluoride (XeF2).\n    *   **Moderate Temperature / Excess F2 (e.g., 1:5 Xe to F2 ratio):** This is the condition that selectively produces Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF4).\n    *   **High Temperature / Large Excess F2 (e.g., 1:20 ratio):** Favors the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6). Also, at very high temperatures, XeF4 can start to decompose.\n\n**Step 3: Define \"Efficiently Produced\"**\n\nIn chemistry, an \"efficient\" synthesis typically implies a process that gives a high yield of the desired, pure product in a reasonable amount of time. It represents a good balance between reaction rate, product yield, and purity.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Given Temperature Choices**\n\nWe need to find the coldest temperature from the list that still allows for an *efficient* synthesis based on the principles above.\n\n*   **F. -78°C, E. 0°C, D. 78°C:** These temperatures are too low. The thermal energy is insufficient to overcome the activation energy, so the reaction rate would be virtually zero. While some alternative methods (like electrical discharge) can work at these temperatures, they often produce mixtures of products (XeF2, XeF4) and are not considered the standard \"efficient\" synthesis route for pure XeF4.\n*   **A. 600°C:** This temperature is too high. While the reaction would be fast, it would be inefficient because it promotes the formation of the undesired by-product Xenon hexafluoride (XeF6) and can cause the XeF4 product to decompose. This leads to a lower yield and purity of XeF4.\n*   **C. 200°C:** At this temperature, the reaction to form XeF4 is known to be possible. However, the reaction rate is very slow, often requiring very long reaction times (e.g., 40+ hours) to achieve a good yield. This slow rate means the process is not considered \"efficient\" in terms of time.\n*   **B. 400°C:** This is the widely recognized optimal temperature for the synthesis of XeF4. At 400°C, with an appropriate ratio of reactants (e.g., 1 part Xenon to 5 parts Fluorine), the reaction proceeds at a good rate and gives a nearly quantitative (almost 100%) yield of XeF4 in a reasonable time frame (several hours). This represents the best balance of rate and selectivity, and is the standard for an \"efficient\" synthesis.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature at which production is *still* efficient. Comparing the options, 400°C is the established temperature for high efficiency. While the reaction occurs at 200°C, it is too slow to be considered efficient. At 600°C, the process becomes inefficient due to side reactions. Therefore, 400°C is the coldest temperature on the list that corresponds to an efficient synthesis.\n\n<<<B>>>"
