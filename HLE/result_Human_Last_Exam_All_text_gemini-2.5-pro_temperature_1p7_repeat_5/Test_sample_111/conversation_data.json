    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine Geoffrey Chaucer's location when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the date and location of Blanche of Lancaster's death.**\nBlanche of Lancaster, the first wife of John of Gaunt, died of the plague on **12 September 1368**. She passed away at Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, **England**. This establishes the specific date we need to cross-reference with Chaucer's whereabouts.\n\n**Step 2: Examine Geoffrey Chaucer's general situation and connections in 1368.**\nIn 1368, Geoffrey Chaucer was a member of the English royal court, serving as an esquire (*valettus*) to King Edward III. His primary residence and place of work was in England. Furthermore, Chaucer had very close ties to Blanche's husband, John of Gaunt, who was Chaucer's great patron. Chaucer's wife, Philippa de Roet, was also in service to the royal household, and her sister, Katherine Swynford, was the governess for Blanche's children. These deep connections to the court and to John of Gaunt's immediate family are a crucial part of the context.\n\n**Step 3: Investigate Chaucer's known travels in 1368.**\nHistorical records, specifically financial accounts and safe-conduct passes, show that Chaucer was engaged in diplomatic travel in 1368.\n*   On February 17, 1368, he was issued a pass to travel from Dover to Calais, France.\n*   He was on the king's business, which took him to France and possibly Navarre (Spain).\n*   The records do not specify the exact duration of this mission or his precise location on September 12.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze conflicting evidence and weigh probabilities.**\nThis is the most critical step. We have evidence he traveled abroad in 1368, but we need to determine if he was still abroad in September.\n*   **Evidence for being abroad:** He was sent on a mission earlier in the year. It is *possible* the mission was lengthy and he was still in France or elsewhere on the continent in September.\n*   **Evidence for being in England:**\n    1.  **Role at Court:** As an esquire in the royal household and a close associate of John of Gaunt, Chaucer's presence would have been expected following the death of such a high-ranking and beloved figure as the Duchess of Lancaster. It was a major event for the entire court.\n    2.  **Return Confirmed:** We have a definite record that Chaucer was back in England by Christmas 1368, as he received a grant of wine from the King. This proves his continental mission did not last the entire year. It is highly probable he had returned before the middle of September.\n    3.  ***The Book of the Duchess***: This is the strongest piece of circumstantial evidence. Chaucer's first major poem is an elegy written to commemorate Blanche's death and console John of Gaunt. The poem's personal tone and its likely function as a courtly piece commissioned by Gaunt strongly suggest that Chaucer was present in England to witness his patron's grief and discuss the composition, rather than writing it from afar based on second-hand news.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude based on the balance of evidence.**\n*   We can definitively rule out Italy (Chaucer's first trip there was in 1372) and Scotland (no record of him traveling there).\n*   While he was in France at some point in 1368, there is no evidence he was there specifically in September.\n*   The choice is between \"England\" and \"Unknown\". While there is no document proving his location on the exact day (\"Unknown\" is technically plausible), the overwhelming weight of circumstantial and contextual evidence points to him being in England. The scholarly consensus is that he was in England, due to his court duties and, most importantly, his subsequent writing of *The Book of the Duchess*.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   The historical record is incomplete, which is common for this period. We rarely have day-by-day itineraries for figures like Chaucer.\n*   We must rely on a \"balance of probabilities\" rather than absolute certainty.\n*   Literary evidence (*The Book of the Duchess*) is a key source for understanding Chaucer's life and relationships and must be considered alongside official records.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** Based on his role in the English court, his close relationship with John of Gaunt, and the creation of the memorial poem *The Book of the Duchess*, the most logical and widely accepted conclusion is that Geoffrey Chaucer was in England when Blanche of Lancaster died.\n\n<<<C>>>"
