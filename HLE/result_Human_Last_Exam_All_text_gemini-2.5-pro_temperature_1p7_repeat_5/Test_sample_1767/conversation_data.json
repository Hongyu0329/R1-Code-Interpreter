    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Components**\n\n*   **Chern Insulator:** This is a two-dimensional material that is an electrical insulator in its bulk but possesses conducting states along its edges. These edge states are topologically protected.\n*   **Chern Number (C):** This is a topological invariant, an integer that characterizes the electronic band structure of a 2D material. It has two main physical manifestations:\n    *   **Quantized Hall Conductivity:** The Hall conductivity ($\\sigma_{xy}$) of the material is quantized in units of $e^2/h$, according to the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs (TKNN) formula: $\\sigma_{xy} = C \\frac{e^2}{h}$. Here, *e* is the elementary charge and *h* is Planck's constant.\n    *   **Bulk-Boundary Correspondence:** The absolute value of the Chern number, |C|, dictates the number of chiral edge states at any boundary of the material. A positive sign (e.g., C=1) corresponds to a specific chirality (e.g., a \"right-mover\" along the top edge), while a negative sign corresponds to the opposite chirality.\n*   **The System:** We have two distinct Chern insulators.\n    *   System 1: Chern number C₁ = 1.\n    *   System 2: Chern number C₂ = 1.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Connection**\n\n*   **\"Connects laterally\":** This means the two 2D materials are placed side-by-side in the same plane, sharing a common 1D boundary. For example, System 1 could occupy the region x < 0 and System 2 could occupy the region x > 0.\n*   **\"Negligible tunneling barrier\":** This is a critical point. It means that electrons can move freely between the two systems at their interface. Effectively, we are not considering two isolated systems anymore, but a single, larger, composite 2D system.\n*   **The Question:** We are asked for the Chern number of this composite system, which is referred to as the \"junction\". Since the Chern number is a bulk 2D property, the question is asking for the Chern number of the new, larger 2D material formed by combining the two.\n\n**3. Determining the Chern Number of the Composite System**\n\nThe Chern number of a composite system formed by joining two subsystems side-by-side is the sum of the Chern numbers of the individual subsystems. We can understand this from the perspective of the physical property it represents: the Hall conductivity.\n\n*   **Step 3.1: Hall Conductivity of Individual Systems:**\n    *   For System 1 (C₁ = 1), the Hall conductivity is $\\sigma_{xy,1} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n    *   For System 2 (C₂ = 1), the Hall conductivity is $\\sigma_{xy,2} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n\n*   **Step 3.2: Hall Conductivity of the Composite System:**\n    When a voltage is applied across the composite sample, the total Hall current will be the sum of the Hall currents flowing through each of the two subsystems. Since conductivity is a measure of current density for a given electric field, and the two systems are arranged in parallel (laterally), their conductivities add up.\n    *   $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = \\sigma_{xy,1} + \\sigma_{xy,2}$\n    *   $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = (1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}) + (1 \\cdot \\frac{e^2}{h}) = 2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$.\n\n*   **Step 3.3: Finding the Total Chern Number:**\n    The Chern number of the composite system, $C_{\\text{total}}$, must satisfy the TKNN formula for the total Hall conductivity:\n    *   $\\sigma_{xy, \\text{total}} = C_{\\text{total}} \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n    *   Comparing this with our result from Step 3.2, we get:\n    *   $C_{\\text{total}} \\frac{e^2}{h} = 2 \\frac{e^2}{h}$\n    *   Therefore, $C_{\\text{total}} = 2$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Meaning of \"Junction\":** The question asks for the Chern number \"of this junction\". The Chern number is a property of a 2D bulk, not a 1D interface. Therefore, \"junction\" must refer to the entire composite 2D system formed by placing the two materials together.\n2.  **Additivity of Chern Numbers:** The key physical principle is that for laterally connected systems, the topological invariant (Chern number) is additive. This is a direct consequence of the additivity of the corresponding physical observable (Hall conductivity).\n3.  **Role of \"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\":** This condition is essential. If there were a large barrier, the two systems would be effectively decoupled, and it would not be meaningful to talk about a single Chern number for the composite system. The negligible barrier ensures they form a single electronic system whose overall properties can be calculated.\n4.  **Contrast with Opposing Chern Numbers:** If the second insulator had a Chern number of C₂ = -1, the total Chern number would be C = 1 + (-1) = 0. The composite system would be a trivial insulator. This is consistent with the bulk-boundary correspondence: the right-moving edge state from the C=1 system and the left-moving edge state from the C=-1 system would meet at the interface and annihilate each other, leading to a gapped interface and a trivial overall state. In our case, with C₁=1 and C₂=1, the edge states at the interface would have the same chirality and cannot annihilate.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n$C_{\\text{total}} = C_1 + C_2 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n<<<2>>>"
