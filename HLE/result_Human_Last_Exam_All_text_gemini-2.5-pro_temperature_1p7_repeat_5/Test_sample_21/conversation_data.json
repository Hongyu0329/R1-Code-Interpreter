    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the natural density of prime numbers $p$ for which the polynomial $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$ remains irreducible modulo $p$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the polynomial**\n\nThe given polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\nLet's consider a specific family of polynomials defined by the recurrence relation $z_n(x, a) = x \\cdot z_{n-1}(x, a) - a \\cdot z_{n-2}(x, a)$, with initial conditions $z_0(x, a) = 2$ and $z_1(x, a) = x$.\nThese polynomials are related to the substitution $x = u + a/u$, for which we have $z_n(x, a) = u^n + (a/u)^n$.\nLet's compute the first few polynomials for $a=2$:\n$z_0(x, 2) = 2$\n$z_1(x, 2) = x$\n$z_2(x, 2) = x \\cdot z_1 - 2 \\cdot z_0 = x^2 - 4$\n$z_3(x, 2) = x \\cdot z_2 - 2 \\cdot z_1 = x(x^2 - 4) - 2x = x^3 - 6x$\n$z_4(x, 2) = x(x^3 - 6x) - 2(x^2 - 4) = x^4 - 8x^2 + 8$\n$z_5(x, 2) = x(x^4 - 8x^2 + 8) - 2(x^3 - 6x) = x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x$\n$z_6(x, 2) = x(x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x) - 2(x^4 - 8x^2 + 8) = x^6 - 12x^4 + 36x^2 - 16$\n$z_7(x, 2) = x(x^6 - 12x^4 + 36x^2 - 16) - 2(x^5 - 10x^3 + 20x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x$\n\nWe observe that $f(x) - 22 = z_7(x, 2)$.\nSo the equation $f(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $z_7(x, 2) = 22$.\nUsing the substitution $x=u+2/u$, the equation becomes $u^7 + (2/u)^7 = 22$.\nLet $v = u^7$. The equation is $v + 128/v = 22$, which simplifies to a quadratic equation:\n$v^2 - 22v + 128 = 0$.\nThe roots for $v$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$v = \\frac{22 \\pm \\sqrt{(-22)^2 - 4(1)(128)}}{2} = \\frac{22 \\pm \\sqrt{484 - 512}}{2} = \\frac{22 \\pm \\sqrt{-28}}{2} = 11 \\pm i\\sqrt{7}$.\nSo, the roots of $f(x)$ are of the form $x = u + 2/u$ where $u^7 = 11 + i\\sqrt{7}$ or $u^7 = 11 - i\\sqrt{7}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Galois group of f(x) over Q**\n\nFirst, we must check if $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=2$. The polynomial is $f(x) = x^7 - 14x^5 + 56x^3 - 56x + 22$.\n1.  The leading coefficient, $a_7=1$, is not divisible by 2.\n2.  All other coefficients, $a_6=0, a_5=-14, a_4=0, a_3=56, a_2=0, a_1=-56, a_0=22$, are divisible by 2.\n3.  The constant term, $a_0=22$, is not divisible by $p^2=4$.\nThus, by Eisenstein's criterion, $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe structure of the polynomial $f(x) = z_7(x, 2) - 22$ is a known type that, under certain conditions, has a dihedral Galois group. The Galois group of $z_n(x, a) - b$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is typically the dihedral group $D_n$.\nThe necessary conditions include the irreducibility of the polynomial and that the discriminant of the auxiliary quadratic equation $v^2-bv+a^n=0$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nIn our case, $n=7, a=2, b=22$. The discriminant is $D = b^2-4a^n = 22^2-4(2^7) = 484-512 = -28$.\nSince $-28$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is not cyclic ($C_7$), but the dihedral group $D_7$.\nSo, the Galois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $D_7$, the group of symmetries of a regular heptagon. It has order $|D_7| = 2 \\times 7 = 14$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Chebotarev Density Theorem**\n\nThe Chebotarev Density Theorem relates the density of primes $p$ for which a polynomial has a certain factorization modulo $p$ to the structure of its Galois group.\nThe polynomial $f(x)$ is irreducible modulo $p$ if and only if the Frobenius element Frob$_p$ for the prime $p$ in the Galois group $G$ acts on the roots of $f(x)$ as a single cycle of length 7.\nOur task is to find the proportion of elements in the group $G=D_7$ that are 7-cycles.\n\nThe group $D_7$ consists of:\n1.  The identity element.\n2.  Six rotations of the heptagon. These are elements of order 7. As permutations of the 7 vertices, they are all 7-cycles.\n3.  Seven reflections of the heptagon. These are elements of order 2. Each reflection fixes one vertex and swaps the remaining six vertices in pairs, so its cycle structure is $(1)(2)(2)(2)$.\n\nAn element in $S_7$ is a 7-cycle if and only if its order is 7. In $D_7$, the elements of order 7 are the six non-identity rotations.\nThe total number of elements in $D_7$ is 14.\nThe number of elements that are 7-cycles is 6.\n\nAccording to the Chebotarev Density Theorem, the natural density of the set of primes $p$ for which Frob$_p$ corresponds to a 7-cycle is the ratio of the number of such elements to the total size of the group.\nDensity = (Number of 7-cycles in $D_7$) / (Order of $D_7$) = $6/14 = 3/7$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  Correctly identifying the special structure of the polynomial is the most critical step. Without it, the problem is much harder.\n2.  Verifying the irreducibility of the polynomial is essential to ensure the Galois group is transitive.\n3.  Knowing the general theory for the Galois groups of polynomials of the form $z_n(x,a)-b$ allows for the direct identification of the group as $D_7$.\n4.  Correctly counting the elements with the desired cycle structure (7-cycles) in the identified Galois group. In $D_7$, this corresponds to counting the elements of order 7.\n\nFinal answer is the calculated density.\n\n<<<3/7>>>"
