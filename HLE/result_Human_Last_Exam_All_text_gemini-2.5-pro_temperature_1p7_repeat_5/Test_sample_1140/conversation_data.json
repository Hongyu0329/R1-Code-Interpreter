    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Problem:** The goal is to synthesize a specific peptide. We must consider two key features of this peptide:\n    *   **Length:** It is a 100 amino acid (aa) peptide. This is a significant length that presents a challenge for purely chemical synthesis methods.\n    *   **Composition:** It contains an unnatural amino acid (UAA), 'X', which is specified as azido phenylalanine. This presents a challenge for purely biological synthesis methods.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:** Let's consider the main techniques for producing peptides and proteins and assess their suitability for this specific problem.\n\n    *   **Technique 1: Direct Recombinant Protein Expression (in vivo, e.g., in *E. coli*)**\n        *   **How it works:** A gene encoding the peptide is inserted into a plasmid, which is then put into a host organism like *E. coli*. The bacteria's natural machinery (ribosomes, tRNA) reads the gene and produces the peptide.\n        *   **Careful Point/Limitation:** The cell's translational machinery is programmed to use only the 20 canonical amino acids. It cannot recognize or incorporate azido phenylalanine. Therefore, this standard technique is **not suitable**.\n\n    *   **Technique 2: Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS)**\n        *   **How it works:** The peptide is built one amino acid at a time while attached to a solid resin support. The desired amino acids, including chemically modified ones like azido phenylalanine, are added sequentially.\n        *   **Careful Point/Limitation:** The efficiency of each amino acid coupling step is not 100% (typically 98-99.5%). For a 100aa peptide, there are 99 coupling reactions. The cumulative effect of these small inefficiencies leads to a very low overall yield of the correct full-length product. For example, even with a high 99% efficiency per step, the final yield would be (0.99)^99, which is approximately 37%. In practice, yields are often lower, and purification becomes extremely difficult due to the presence of many similar-length \"deletion sequences\" (peptides missing one or more amino acids). Therefore, direct SPPS for a 100aa peptide is generally **not feasible**.\n\n    *   **Technique 3: Recombinant Expression with Genetic Code Expansion**\n        *   **How it works:** This is an advanced biological technique. The host organism (*E. coli*) is engineered to incorporate a UAA. This requires introducing an \"orthogonal\" pair of a new tRNA and a new enzyme (aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase). This new pair is engineered to specifically recognize the UAA (azido phenylalanine) and assign it to a unique codon, typically a stop codon like UAG (amber codon).\n        *   **Careful Point/Limitation:** This is a powerful technique for producing large proteins with UAAs. However, it requires significant upfront molecular biology effort to create and optimize the engineered host strain. While possible, it can be complex and may not be the most straightforward or \"helpful\" method for a single 100aa project, especially compared to chemical methods.\n\n    *   **Technique 4: Combination of SPPS and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**\n        *   **How it works:** This is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of chemical and ligation techniques.\n            1.  **Divide and Conquer:** The target 100aa peptide is strategically broken down into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments).\n            2.  **SPPS Synthesis:** Each of these smaller fragments is synthesized independently using SPPS. This is a highly efficient process for peptides of this shorter length (~50aa). The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, is easily incorporated into its respective fragment during this SPPS step.\n            3.  **Ligation:** The synthesized fragments are then joined together in solution using a chemical reaction called Native Chemical Ligation. This reaction specifically forms a native peptide bond. The classic NCL reaction requires one peptide fragment to have a C-terminal thioester and the other to have an N-terminal cysteine at the ligation site.\n        *   **Careful Point/Conclusion:** This method directly addresses both of the initial challenges. SPPS is used to handle the unnatural amino acid incorporation with high precision. NCL is used to overcome the length limitation of SPPS by stitching the shorter, easy-to-make fragments into the final 100aa product. This is a very robust, widely-used, and effective strategy for creating semi-synthetic proteins and long peptides containing specific modifications.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nComparing the options, the most helpful and practical technique for synthesizing a 100aa peptide containing a specific unnatural amino acid is the combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL). It circumvents the limitations of both direct SPPS (length) and standard recombinant expression (UAA incorporation) in a powerful and controlled manner.\n\n<<<The combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) to create smaller fragments and Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) to join those fragments into the final 100aa peptide.>>>"
