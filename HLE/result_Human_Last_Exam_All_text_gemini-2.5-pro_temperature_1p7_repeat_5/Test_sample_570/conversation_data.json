    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Formalize the Condition\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The lines are given by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers. Let `L(p,q)` denote such a line. The condition is that `K` must intersect every such line, i.e., `K ∩ L(p,q) ≠ ∅` for all coprime integers `p` and `q`.\n\nLet `u = (p,q)` be a vector in the plane. The equation of the line can be written as a dot product: `u · x = 1`, where `x = (x,y)`.\nA convex set `K` intersects the line `u · x = 1` if and only if the set of values of `u · x` for `x ∈ K` contains 1. This means:\n`inf_{x ∈ K} (u · x) ≤ 1 ≤ sup_{x ∈ K} (u · x)`\n\nLet `h_K(u) = sup_{x ∈ K} (u · x)` be the support function of `K`. The supremum of `u · x` over `K` is `h_K(u)`. The infimum is `inf_{x ∈ K} (u · x) = -sup_{x ∈ K} (-u · x) = -h_K(-u)`.\n\nSo, the condition becomes:\n`-h_K(-u) ≤ 1` and `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for every vector `u = (p,q)` where `p` and `q` are coprime integers.\nLet `P` be the set of all such vectors, `P = {(p,q) ∈ Z² | gcd(p,q) = 1}`.\nThe condition can be rewritten as:\n`h_K(u) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-u) ≥ -1` for all `u ∈ P`.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetrization Argument\nWe can show that the minimum area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric domain (with respect to the origin).\nLet `K` be a convex set that satisfies the condition.\n1.  The condition on `K` is `h_K(u) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-u) ≥ -1` for all `u ∈ P`.\n2.  Note that if `u = (p,q) ∈ P`, then `-u = (-p,-q) ∈ P`.\n3.  Let's consider the set `-K = {-x | x ∈ K}`. It's also a convex domain with the same area as `K`. Its support function is `h_{-K}(u) = h_K(-u)`.\n4.  For `-K` to satisfy the intersection property, it must satisfy `h_{-K}(u) ≥ 1` and `h_{-K}(-u) ≥ -1` for `u ∈ P`. This translates to `h_K(-u) ≥ 1` and `h_K(u) ≥ -1`.\n5.  Therefore, if `K` is a solution, it must satisfy both sets of conditions: `h_K(u) ≥ 1` AND `h_K(u) ≥ -1` (which simplifies to `h_K(u) ≥ 1`), and `h_K(-u) ≥ 1` AND `h_K(-u) ≥ -1` (which simplifies to `h_K(-u) ≥ 1`).\n6.  So, for any solution `K`, it must satisfy `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ P` (since `u ∈ P ⇒ -u ∈ P`).\n7.  Consider the centrally symmetric set `K_s = (K - K) / 2`, which is the Minkowski symmetrization of `K`. `K_s` is convex and origin-symmetric.\n8.  Its support function is `h_{K_s}(u) = (h_K(u) + h_K(-u)) / 2`.\n9.  Since `h_K(u) ≥ 1` and `h_K(-u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ P`, we have `h_{K_s}(u) ≥ (1 + 1) / 2 = 1`.\n10. This means that `K_s` also satisfies the condition.\n11. By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(K_s) ≥ Area(K)`.\n12. This implies that the minimal area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric set. So, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric convex domains `K`.\n\n### Step 3: Duality and the Search for the Optimal Set\nFor a centrally symmetric `K`, the condition simplifies to `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ P`.\n\nLet's use the concept of the polar dual of a convex set. The polar dual of `K` is defined as:\n`K* = {y | x · y ≤ 1 for all x ∈ K}`\nThis is equivalent to `K* = {y | h_K(y) ≤ 1}`.\n\nThe condition `h_K(u) ≥ 1` for all `u ∈ P` means that no point `u` from the set of coprime integer vectors `P` can lie in the *interior* of `K*`. The interior of `K*` must be free of primitive integer points.\n\nThe problem is now transformed into two parts:\na) Find the maximum possible area of a centrally symmetric convex set `K*` whose interior contains no primitive integer points.\nb) Use this to find the minimum area of `K`.\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex body `K` in the plane, the areas of `K` and `K*` are related by the Mahler volume `Area(K) * Area(K*) ≥ 8`. The minimum value of 8 is achieved if and only if `K` (and thus `K*`) is a parallelogram.\n\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we need to maximize `Area(K*)`.\n\nA known theorem in the geometry of numbers states that the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex set in the plane whose interior contains no non-zero integer lattice points is 4 (Minkowski's Theorem). A similar result holds for primitive points: the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex set whose interior is free of primitive integer points is also 4. This maximum area is achieved by the square `S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n\nThe interior of this square `S`, `(-1, 1) × (-1, 1)`, contains only one integer point, the origin (0,0), which is not a primitive point (as gcd(0,0) is not 1). So `K* = S` is the set we are looking for.\n`Area(K*) = Area(S) = 2 × 2 = 4`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Minimal Area\nNow we can calculate the minimal area of `K`. Since the maximum area of `K*` is 4 and is achieved by a parallelogram (a square), we have:\n`Area(K) * Area(K*) = 8`\n`Area(K) * 4 = 8`\n`Area(K) = 2`\n\nThis gives a lower bound on the area. The minimal area is at least 2.\n\n### Step 5: Verifying the Solution\nWe need to find the set `K` whose polar dual is the square `K* = S = [-1, 1] × [-1, 1]`.\n`K = (K*)* = S*`\n`S* = {x | x · y ≤ 1 for all y ∈ S}`\nLet `y = (p,q)` where `-1 ≤ p ≤ 1` and `-1 ≤ q ≤ 1`. Let `x = (x_1, x_2)`.\n`x · y = x_1 p + x_2 q`.\n`sup_{y∈S} (x · y) = sup_{-1≤p≤1, -1≤q≤1} (x_1 p + x_2 q) = |x_1| + |x_2|`.\nThe condition `x · y ≤ 1` for all `y ∈ S` becomes `|x_1| + |x_2| ≤ 1`.\n\nSo the optimal convex domain `K` is the set `{(x,y) | |x| + |y| ≤ 1}`. This is a square rotated by 45 degrees, with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n\nThe area of this domain is `(√2)² = 2` (or using the formula for the area of a rhombus: `(d1 * d2) / 2 = (2 * 2) / 2 = 2`).\n\nWe have found a convex domain that satisfies the conditions and has an area of 2. Since our theoretical lower bound is 2, this must be the minimal area.\n\n**Final check of the condition for `K = {(x,y) | |x|+|y|≤1}`:**\nThe support function is `h_K(p,q) = sup_{|x|+|y|≤1} (px+qy) = max(|p|,|q|)`.\nThe condition for intersecting the line `px+qy=1` is `inf(px+qy) ≤ 1 ≤ sup(px+qy)`, which is `-max(|p|,|q|) ≤ 1 ≤ max(|p|,|q|)`. This simplifies to `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`.\nFor any pair of coprime integers `(p,q)`, at least one of `p` or `q` must be a non-zero integer. Thus, `|p|≥1` or `|q|≥1`, which implies `max(|p|,|q|) ≥ 1`. The condition holds for all such lines.\n\nFinal answer is 2."
