    "An analysis of the question is as follows:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the components of the question\n\n1.  **Schema S**: The schema $S$ consists of four unary predicates. Let's denote them as $P_1(x), P_2(x), P_3(x), P_4(x)$.\n\n2.  **Logical Fragment $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$**: This is a fragment of First-Order Logic (FO) over the schema $S$. The allowed logical symbols are:\n    *   $\\exists$: Existential quantifier.\n    *   $\\land$: Conjunction (AND).\n    *   $\\top, \\bot$: Truth (true) and Falsity (false) constants.\n    *   The predicates from $S$.\n    *   Variables and parentheses.\n    Notably, negation ($\\neg$), disjunction ($\\lor$), universal quantification ($\\forall$), and implication ($\\to$) are not allowed.\n\n3.  **VC Dimension**: The VC dimension is a measure of the complexity or expressive power of a class of classifiers or concepts. In the context of logic, we consider formulas with one free variable, say $x$. Each such formula $\\phi(x)$ defines a concept on a given structure (or model) $M$. The concept is the set of elements $a$ in the universe of $M$ for which $\\phi(a)$ is true.\n    *   Let $L$ be a logic. For a structure $M$, the class of concepts defined by $L$ on $M$ is $\\mathcal{C}_M = \\{\\{a \\in |M| \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\} \\mid \\phi(x) \\in L \\text{ has one free variable } x\\}$.\n    *   The VC dimension of the logic $L$, denoted $\\mathrm{VCdim}(L)$, is the maximum VC dimension of $\\mathcal{C}_M$ over all possible structures $M$. Formally, $\\mathrm{VCdim}(L) = \\sup_M \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M)$.\n    *   The VC dimension of a concept class is the size of the largest set of points that can be \"shattered\" by the class. A set $C$ is shattered if for every subset $T \\subseteq C$, there exists a concept in the class that selects exactly the points in $T$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the structure of the formulas\n\nWe need to understand what kind of sets can be defined by formulas $\\phi(x)$ in $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$.\n\nA formula in this fragment is a conjunction of simpler formulas. Each of these simpler formulas must be either an atomic formula, $\\top$, $\\bot$, or an existentially quantified formula.\nSince all predicates are unary, an atomic formula has the form $P_i(z)$, where $z$ is a variable.\n\nLet $\\phi(x)$ be a formula with one free variable $x$. Any such formula is logically equivalent to one of the form:\n$C(x) \\land S$\nwhere:\n*   $C(x)$ is a conjunction of atomic formulas involving the free variable $x$. For example, $P_1(x) \\land P_3(x)$. An empty conjunction is equivalent to $\\top$.\n*   $S$ is a sentence (a formula with no free variables). $S$ is a conjunction of existentially quantified formulas like $\\exists y_1 \\exists y_2... ( \\dots )$. An empty conjunction is $\\top$.\n\nLet's see why. A general formula $\\phi(x)$ is a conjunction of terms like $\\exists \\vec{y} (\\psi(x, \\vec{y}))$. Inside $\\psi$, which is a conjunction of atoms, we can separate atoms containing $x$ from those containing only quantified variables $\\vec{y}$. Due to the nature of unary predicates, the variables are not shared between different atoms, so we can distribute the quantifiers.\nFor example, $\\exists y (P_1(x) \\land P_2(y))$ is equivalent to $P_1(x) \\land (\\exists y P_2(y))$. The first part involves the free variable $x$, and the second part is a sentence. Repeating this process gives the general form $C(x) \\land S$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the concept class on a fixed structure\n\nLet's fix a structure $M$. A formula $\\phi(x) \\equiv C(x) \\land S$ defines a set $\\{a \\in |M| \\mid M \\models \\phi(a)\\}$.\nThe sentence $S$ is either true or false in $M$.\n*   If $M \\not\\models S$, then $\\phi(x)$ is false for every $a$. The defined set is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n*   If $M \\models S$, then $\\phi(x)$ is true if and only if $C(x)$ is true. The defined set is $\\{a \\in |M| \\mid M \\models C(a)\\}$.\n\nSo, for any given structure $M$, the class of all definable sets, $\\mathcal{C}_M$, is a subset of the following class:\n$\\mathcal{C}'_M = \\{\\emptyset\\} \\cup \\{ \\{a \\mid M \\models C(a)\\} \\mid C(x) \\text{ is a conjunction of atoms } P_i(x) \\}$\nA set defined by $C(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I} P_i(x)$ (for some $I \\subseteq \\{1,2,3,4\\}$) is the intersection $\\bigcap_{i \\in I} P_i^M$, where $P_i^M$ is the interpretation of $P_i$ in $M$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{H}_M$ be the class of sets formed by intersections of the four base sets $P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M$.\nThen $\\mathcal{C}_M \\subseteq \\mathcal{H}_M \\cup \\{\\emptyset\\}$.\nThe VC dimension of a class is not increased by adding the empty set. Thus, $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M) \\le \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_M)$.\nTo find the VC dimension of the logic, we must find $\\sup_M \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{C}_M)$. This is upper-bounded by $\\sup_M \\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_M)$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the upper bound for the VC dimension\n\nThe concept class $\\mathcal{H}_M$ is the set of all possible intersections of the four sets $\\{P_1^M, P_2^M, P_3^M, P_4^M\\}$. This is a well-known construction in learning theory, corresponding to concepts defined by monotone monomials (conjunctions of positive literals).\nIt is a standard result that the VC dimension of the class of intersections of $k$ sets is at most $k$. In our case, $k=4$.\nThus, for any structure $M$, $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathcal{H}_M) \\le 4$. This implies $\\mathrm{VCdim}(\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]) \\le 4$.\n\nA sketch of the proof for the upper bound: Let $C = \\{c_1, ..., c_5\\}$ be any set of 5 points in the universe of $M$. Associate with each point $c_j$ a binary vector $v_j \\in \\{0,1\\}^4$, where the $i$-th component is 1 if $c_j \\in P_i^M$ and 0 otherwise. As we have 5 vectors in a 4-dimensional vector space over the field GF(2), they must be linearly dependent. This dependency prevents shattering $C$. For instance, let $J \\subseteq C$ be a set of points whose vectors sum to the zero vector. Then no concept (intersection) can single out a subset of $J$ of odd size.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the lower bound for the VC dimension\n\nTo show the VC dimension is at least 4, we need to construct a single structure $M$ where we can shatter a set of 4 points.\n\nLet's choose a universe with 4 points: $|M| = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$.\nNow, define the interpretations of the four predicates on this universe:\n*   $P_1^M = \\{a_2, a_3, a_4\\} = |M| \\setminus \\{a_1\\}$\n*   $P_2^M = \\{a_1, a_3, a_4\\} = |M| \\setminus \\{a_2\\}$\n*   $P_3^M = \\{a_1, a_2, a_4\\} = |M| \\setminus \\{a_3\\}$\n*   $P_4^M = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\} = |M| \\setminus \\{a_4\\}$\n\nWe want to show that we can shatter the set $C = |M| = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4\\}$. To do this, for any subset $T \\subseteq C$, we must find a formula $\\phi(x)$ in our language that defines exactly $T$.\n\nLet $T$ be any subset of $C$.\nLet $I_T = \\{i \\mid a_i \\notin T\\}$. This set indexes the points we want to exclude.\nConsider the conjunction of predicates $C_T(x) = \\bigwedge_{i \\in I_T} P_i(x)$.\nThe set defined by $C_T(x)$ in $M$ is:\n$\\bigcap_{i \\in I_T} P_i^M = \\bigcap_{i \\in I_T} (|M| \\setminus \\{a_i\\}) = |M| \\setminus \\bigcup_{i \\in I_T} \\{a_i\\} = |M| \\setminus \\{a_i \\mid i \\in I_T\\} = |M| \\setminus (|M| \\setminus T) = T$.\nSo the set defined by the monomial $C_T(x)$ is exactly $T$.\n\nNow, we must ensure that we can form a full formula $\\phi(x)$ in our language for each $T$.\nLet $\\phi_T(x) = C_T(x) \\land S_T$ where $S_T$ is a sentence.\n*   If $T = \\emptyset$, then $I_T = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. $C_\\emptyset(x) = P_1(x) \\land P_2(x) \\land P_3(x) \\land P_4(x)$. This formula itself defines the set $\\bigcap_{i=1}^4 P_i^M = \\emptyset$. We can use $S_T = \\top$.\n*   If $T \\ne \\emptyset$, we need a sentence $S_T$ that is true in $M$. Let's choose $S_T = \\exists y (C_T(y))$. Since the set defined by $C_T(y)$ is $T$, and $T$ is non-empty, there exists such a $y$. Therefore, $M \\models S_T$. The formula $\\phi_T(x) = C_T(x) \\land \\exists y(C_T(y))$ is in the allowed language, and since $M \\models S_T$, this formula defines the set $T$.\n\nSince we can define every subset of $C$, we have shattered $C$. The size of $C$ is 4.\nTherefore, the VC dimension is at least 4.\n\n### Step 6: Conclusion\n\nFrom Step 4, we have VCdim $\\le 4$.\nFrom Step 5, we have VCdim $\\ge 4$.\nCombining these results, the VC dimension must be exactly 4."
