    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks for the primary technical difference in the execution of a *cambré derrière* (a bend of the upper body backwards) between two major ballet methodologies: Vaganova and Balanchine.\n\n2.  **Define Cambré Derrière:** This is a fundamental ballet movement where the dancer, standing in a specific position (like first or fifth), bends their upper torso backward from the waist, keeping the lower body stable. The goal is to create a graceful and controlled arc with the spine.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Vaganova Method's Approach:**\n    *   The Vaganova method, originating from Russia, places immense emphasis on core strength, stability, and precise placement.\n    *   In a Vaganova *cambré derrière*, the cardinal rule is to keep the hips absolutely square and facing forward.\n    *   The dancer must lift the torso up and out of the waist before beginning the bend.\n    *   The bend originates from the upper spine (thoracic region), not the lower back (lumbar region).\n    *   The pelvis remains stationary and does not tilt or release forward. This ensures that the bend is a pure stretch of the upper back and abdominal muscles, and it maintains a strong, stable base.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Balanchine Method's Approach:**\n    *   The Balanchine method, developed in America, is known for its speed, musicality, and pushing classical lines to their extremes. It often prioritizes a dynamic, larger-than-life aesthetic.\n    *   In a Balanchine *cambré derrière*, a key difference emerges. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend, the dancer is often taught to release the hip of the working leg slightly forward.\n    *   This technique is sometimes referred to as \"breaking the hip.\" This release of the pelvis allows the dancer's center of gravity to shift, facilitating a more profound arc in the spine.\n    *   While this might seem to break the \"rules\" of classical alignment, in the Balanchine aesthetic it serves the purpose of creating a more visually striking and dynamic line.\n\n5.  **Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While there are stylistic differences in arm carriage between the methods (often called \"port de bras\"), this is not the most fundamental or defining difference in the *cambré derrière* itself.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core difference. Vaganova demands square, immobile hips. Balanchine permits a release of the hip to deepen the bend. This is a direct and well-known technical distinction.\n    *   **C. Speed:** Speed is a general characteristic of the Balanchine style, but it's not the defining technical difference of this specific movement. A Vaganova dancer can perform a fast *cambré*, and a Balanchine dancer can perform a slow one. The *how* of the movement is distinct from the *when* or *how fast*.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree of the backbend is a *result* of the technique, not the technique itself. The Balanchine hip release *allows* for a deeper bend, but the cause of this difference is the hip placement. Therefore, \"Placement of hip\" is a more fundamental and precise answer.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Both methods use the head (epaulement) to follow the line of the body and arm gracefully. While there might be subtle stylistic variations, the basic principle is similar. The hip action is a much more significant point of divergence.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe most significant and technically specific difference between a Vaganova and a Balanchine *cambré derrière* lies in the treatment of the hips. The Vaganova method insists on keeping the hips square and stable, while the Balanchine method allows for a forward release of the hip to achieve a deeper and more dynamic line.\n\n<<<B>>>"
