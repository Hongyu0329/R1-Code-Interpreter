    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem\nWe are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), `X(k)` and `H(k)`, for two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n`X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n`H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\nWe need to find the 4-point DFT for a new 8-point sequence `y(n)` which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n### Step 2: Interpret \"4-point DFT of an 8-point sequence\"\nThe standard N-point DFT is defined for an N-point sequence. When we are asked to find the N-point DFT of a longer sequence (M points, where M > N), it implies a process of aliasing in the time domain.\nLet the desired 4-point DFT be `Z(k)`. It is defined for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\nThe formula is:\n`Z(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_4^{kn}` where `W_4 = e^(-j2π/4)`\n\nWe can split the summation:\n`Z(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n) * W_4^{kn} + Σ_{n=4}^{7} y(n) * W_4^{kn}`\nLet `m = n-4` in the second sum. `n = m+4`.\n`Z(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n) * W_4^{kn} + Σ_{m=0}^{3} y(m+4) * W_4^{k(m+4)}`\nSince `W_4^{k(m+4)} = W_4^{km} * W_4^{4k} = W_4^{km} * (e^{-j2π/4})^{4k} = W_4^{km} * (e^{-j2πk}) = W_4^{km} * 1`, the expression simplifies to:\n`Z(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n) * W_4^{kn} + Σ_{n=0}^{3} y(n+4) * W_4^{kn}`\n`Z(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} (y(n) + y(n+4)) * W_4^{kn}`\n\nThis means we first need to find the aliased 4-point sequence `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)` for `n=0, 1, 2, 3`, and then compute its 4-point DFT.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the aliased sequence z(n)\nFrom the definition of `y(n)`, we have:\n`y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1)}` for `n=0,1,2,3`\n`y(n+4) = {x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}` for `n=0,1,2,3`\n\nSo, the aliased sequence `z(n)` is:\n*   `z(0) = y(0) + y(4) = x(0) + x(2)`\n*   `z(1) = y(1) + y(5) = h(0) + h(2)`\n*   `z(2) = y(2) + y(6) = x(1) + x(3)`\n*   `z(3) = y(3) + y(7) = h(1) + h(3)`\n\nTo find `z(n)`, we must first find the original time-domain sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)` by computing the Inverse DFT (IDFT).\n\n### Step 4: Calculate x(n) using IDFT\nThe IDFT formula is `x(n) = (1/N) * Σ_{k=0}^{N-1} X(k) * W_N^{-kn}`. For N=4, `W_4^{-k} = [1, j, -1, -j]`.\n`x(n) = (1/4) * Σ_{k=0}^{3} X(k) * e^(j2πkn/4)`\n\n*   `x(0) = (1/4) * [X(0) + X(1) + X(2) + X(3)] = (1/4) * [1 + j - 1 - j] = 0`\n*   `x(1) = (1/4) * [X(0) + X(1)j + X(2)(-1) + X(3)(-j)] = (1/4) * [1 + j(j) - 1(-1) - j(-j)] = (1/4) * [1 - 1 + 1 - 1] = 0`\n*   `x(2) = (1/4) * [X(0) + X(1)(-1) + X(2)(1) + X(3)(-1)] = (1/4) * [1 - j - 1 + j] = 0`\n*   `x(3) = (1/4) * [X(0) + X(1)(-j) + X(2)(-1) + X(3)(j)] = (1/4) * [1 - j(j) - 1(-1) + j(j)] = (1/4) * [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = 1`\nSo, `x(n) = [0, 0, 0, 1]`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate h(n) using IDFT\n`H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n*   `h(0) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1) + H(2) + H(3)] = (1/4) * [0 + (1+j) + 1 + (1-j)] = (1/4) * [3] = 3/4`\n*   `h(1) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1)j + H(2)(-1) + H(3)(-j)] = (1/4) * [0 + (1+j)j + 1(-1) + (1-j)(-j)] = (1/4) * [j-1 - 1 + j+1] = (1/4) * [2j-1]`\n*   `h(2) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1)(-1) + H(2)(1) + H(3)(-1)] = (1/4) * [0 - (1+j) + 1 - (1-j)] = (1/4) * [-1-j+1-1+j] = (1/4) * [-1] = -1/4`\n*   `h(3) = (1/4) * [H(0) + H(1)(-j) + H(2)(-1) + H(3)(j)] = (1/4) * [0 - j(1+j) -1 + j(1-j)] = (1/4) * [-j+1-1+j+1] = (1/4) * [1] = 1/4`\n\nLet's check `h(1)` for a common calculation error. A real signal requires `H(k)=H*(N-k)`. H(1)=1+j, H(3)=1-j. H*(3)=1+j. So `H(1)=H*(3)`, not `H(1)=H(3)*`. This means `h(n)` is not real. The calculation is correct as is.\n`h(1)=(2j-1)/4` and `h(3)=1/4`. My IDFT seems inconsistent with some checks, let's recompute `h(1)` and `h(3)` very carefully using the sum `h(n) = (1/4) * Σ H(k) W_4^{-kn}`.\n`W_4^{-k*1}` = `{W_4^0, W_4^{-1}, W_4^{-2}, W_4^{-3}}` = `{1, j, -1, -j}`\n`h(1) = (1/4)[H(0)*1 + H(1)*j + H(2)*(-1) + H(3)*(-j)] = (1/4)[0*1+(1+j)j+1(-1)+(1-j)(-j)] = (1/4)[j-1-1-(-j+1)] = (1/4)[j-2+j-1] = (1/4)[2j-3]`.\nLet's retry IDFT for `h(n)` once more as `H(k)=H*(N-k)` property for real sequences might have been confused. The property is `H(k) = H*(N-k)`. `H(1)=1+j`, `H*(4-1)=H*(3)=(1-j)* = 1+j`. It matches. So `h(n)` MUST be real. The IDFT calculation must be wrong. Let's use `W_4^{kn}` terms directly: `exp(j2πkn/4)`.\n`h(1)=(1/4)[H(0)e^0 + H(1)e^(jπ/2) + H(2)e^(jπ) + H(3)e^(j3π/2)] = (1/4)[0*1 + (1+j)j + 1(-1) + (1-j)(-j)] = (1/4)[j-1-1+j+1] = (1/4)[2j-1]`.\nThere seems to be an inconsistency in the problem statement as `H(k)` satisfies the condition for a real sequence, but the IDFT yields a complex one. Let's proceed by trusting the math `h(n) = (1/4)[3, 2j-1, -1, 1]`.\n\nNo, wait, let's use the definition: `H(k) = Σ h(n) W_4^{nk}` and test `h(n)=(1/4)[3, -3, -1, 1]`.\n`H(1) = (1/4)[3W_4^0 -3W_4^1 -1W_4^2 +1W_4^3] = (1/4)[3 -3(-j) -1(-1) + 1(j)] = (1/4)[3+3j+1+j] = (1/4)[4+4j] = 1+j`. This is correct.\nSo `h(n) = [3/4, -3/4, -1/4, 1/4]`.\n\n### Step 6: Construct the final sequence z(n)\n*   `x(n) = [0, 0, 0, 1]`\n*   `h(n) = [3/4, -3/4, -1/4, 1/4]`\n*   `z(0) = x(0) + x(2) = 0 + 0 = 0`\n*   `z(1) = h(0) + h(2) = 3/4 + (-1/4) = 2/4 = 1/2`\n*   `z(2) = x(1) + x(3) = 0 + 1 = 1`\n*   `z(3) = h(1) + h(3) = -3/4 + 1/4 = -2/4 = -1/2`\nSo the sequence to transform is `z(n) = [0, 1/2, 1, -1/2]`.\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the 4-point DFT of z(n)\nLet the result be `Z(k)`. We use `Z(k) = Σ_{n=0}^{3} z(n) W_4^{kn}`. The twiddle factors `W_4^{kn}` matrix is:\n`[[ 1,  1,  1,  1],`\n `[ 1, -j, -1,  j],`\n `[ 1, -1,  1, -1],`\n `[ 1,  j, -1, -j]]`\n\n*   `Z(0) = z(0) + z(1) + z(2) + z(3) = 0 + 1/2 + 1 - 1/2 = 1`\n*   `Z(1) = z(0) - j*z(1) - z(2) + j*z(3) = 0 - j(1/2) - 1 + j(-1/2) = -1 - j`\n*   `Z(2) = z(0) - z(1) + z(2) - z(3) = 0 - (1/2) + 1 - (-1/2) = -1/2 + 1 + 1/2 = 1`\n*   `Z(3) = z(0) + j*z(1) - z(2) - j*z(3) = 0 + j(1/2) - 1 - j(-1/2) = -1 + j`\n\nThe resulting 4-point DFT is `Z(k) = [1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]`.\n\n<<<[1, -1-j, 1, -1+j]>>>"
