It is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured with interleukin-15 will exhibit enhanced or increased release of effector cytokines (such as IFN-γ and TNF-α) upon stimulation with their target antigen compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15. This is because IL-15 promotes a less differentiated, more persistent memory T cell phenotype that is more robust and less prone to exhaustion, leading to superior functional capacity upon activation.
