    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the number of distinct colors that can be observed in the **pure allotropes** of phosphorus. The key terms are:\n*   **Phosphorus:** The chemical element (P).\n*   **Allotropes:** Different structural forms of the same element.\n*   **Pure:** This is a crucial constraint. It means we should consider the color of a single allotropic form, not a mixture of allotropes or a sample that has degraded.\n*   **Colors can be observed:** This refers to the visible color of each distinct, pure allotrope.\n\n**2. Identify the Main Allotropes of Phosphorus**\nPhosphorus has several well-characterized allotropes. For a comprehensive answer, we must consider both the classical bulk allotropes and any recently discovered, well-established forms.\nThe primary allotropes are:\n*   White Phosphorus\n*   Red Phosphorus\n*   Violet Phosphorus (also called Hittorf's Phosphorus)\n*   Black Phosphorus\n*   Blue Phosphorus (a more recently synthesized 2D form)\n\n**3. Determine the Color of Each Pure Allotrope**\nWe will now analyze the color associated with each of these pure forms.\n\n*   **White Phosphorus (P₄):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** When freshly prepared and kept from light, pure white phosphorus is a colorless or **white**, waxy solid.\n    *   **Color:** White.\n\n*   **Red Phosphorus (Pₙ):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a polymeric form. Its color is intrinsic to its structure.\n    *   **Color:** **Red**. The exact shade can vary from orange-red to dark red, but the fundamental color is red.\n\n*   **Violet Phosphorus (Hittorf's Phosphorus):**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is another stable polymeric form of phosphorus, notable for its crystalline structure.\n    *   **Color:** **Violet**. It forms deep violet or purple crystals.\n\n*   **Black Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is the most thermodynamically stable allotrope under standard conditions. It has a layered, graphite-like structure.\n    *   **Color:** **Black**. It is a black solid with a metallic luster.\n\n*   **Blue Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is a 2D allotrope (a phosphorene monolayer) that has been experimentally synthesized. As a confirmed allotrope, its color should be included.\n    *   **Color:** **Blue**.\n\n**4. Address Common Points of Confusion (and Exclude Them)**\n\n*   **Yellow Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** This is perhaps the most critical point of analysis. \"Yellow phosphorus\" is the common name for white phosphorus that has been exposed to sunlight. The yellow coloration is caused by the partial conversion of white phosphorus into red phosphorus. Therefore, a yellow sample is not *pure* white phosphorus but a *mixture* of allotropes. Since the question specifies **pure allotropes**, the color yellow should not be counted as the color of a distinct, pure form. The color of the pure white allotrope is white.\n\n*   **Brown or Scarlet Phosphorus:**\n    *   **Careful Point:** These terms are sometimes used to describe other preparations. However, they are not generally recognized as distinct, well-characterized allotropes but rather as amorphous or impure variations of red phosphorus. For a definitive count, we stick to the universally recognized allotropes.\n\n**5. Final Tally of Colors**\nBased on the analysis of the distinct, pure allotropes of phosphorus, we have identified the following unique colors:\n1.  **White** (from pure White Phosphorus)\n2.  **Red** (from Red Phosphorus)\n3.  **Violet** (from Violet Phosphorus)\n4.  **Black** (from Black Phosphorus)\n5.  **Blue** (from Blue Phosphorus)\n\nCounting these distinct colors, we arrive at a total of 5.\n\n### Final Answer\nThere are 5 distinct colors that can be observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus: white, red, violet, black, and blue.\n\n<<<5>>>"
