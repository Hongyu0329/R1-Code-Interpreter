    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step-by-Step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the target word and sentence:** The sentence is \"Fat people eat accumulates.\" The question asks for the part of speech of the first word, which is \"Fat\".\n\n2.  **Analyze the context of the word:** The word \"Fat\" appears directly before the word \"people\". The word \"people\" is a noun, as it refers to a group of persons.\n\n3.  **Determine the function of the word \"Fat\":** In the phrase \"Fat people\", the word \"Fat\" is used to describe or modify the noun \"people\". It answers the question \"What kind of people?\".\n\n4.  **Define the relevant parts of speech:**\n    *   An **adjective** is a word that describes or modifies a noun or pronoun. (e.g., *tall* person, *blue* car).\n    *   A **noun** is a word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. (e.g., *person*, *car*, *fat* as in body tissue).\n    *   A **verb** is a word that expresses an action or state of being. (e.g., *run*, *is*, *eat*).\n    *   An **adverb** modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. (e.g., run *quickly*).\n    *   A **conjunction** connects words, phrases, or clauses. (e.g., *and*, *but*).\n\n5.  **Apply the definitions to the word \"Fat\" in the sentence:** Since \"Fat\" is describing the noun \"people\", its function is that of an adjective.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **The sentence is grammatically incorrect.** The sentence \"Fat people eat accumulates\" does not form a coherent grammatical thought because it seems to have a subject (\"Fat people\") followed by two consecutive verbs (\"eat accumulates\").\n*   **Analyze the word in its local context.** Despite the grammatical error in the full sentence, the relationship between \"Fat\" and \"people\" is clear. Within the noun phrase \"Fat people\", \"Fat\" functions as an adjective modifying \"people\". We analyze the part of speech based on this immediate function, not the flawed structure of the entire sentence.\n*   **Words can have multiple parts of speech.** The word \"fat\" can also be a noun (e.g., \"This cut of meat has too much fat.\"). However, in this specific sentence, its placement before \"people\" makes its role adjectival.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the word \"Fat\" is modifying the noun \"people\". Therefore, it is an adjective. This corresponds to answer choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
