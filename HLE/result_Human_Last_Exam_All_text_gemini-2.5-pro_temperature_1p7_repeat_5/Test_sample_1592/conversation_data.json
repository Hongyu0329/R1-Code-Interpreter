    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Location of Waskaganish**\nThe Waskaganish gathering place is located in the Cree community of Waskaganish. This community is situated in the Eeyou Istchee James Bay region of northern Quebec. Specifically, it lies on the south shore of the Rupert River, at its mouth on the southeastern coast of James Bay. Its approximate coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Neighboring Provinces and Territories**\nQuebec shares borders with several other Canadian provinces and territories:\n*   **Ontario:** To the west.\n*   **Newfoundland and Labrador:** To the east.\n*   **New Brunswick:** To the southeast.\n*   **Nunavut:** To the north. The maritime boundary runs through Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay. Importantly, Nunavut also includes all the islands within James Bay and Hudson Bay.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Proximity of Each Neighbor to Waskaganish**\nWe need to evaluate the distance from Waskaganish to the nearest point of each of these jurisdictions.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Rule out distant neighbors.**\n    *   New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador are located far to the southeast and east of Waskaganish, respectively. They are separated by hundreds of kilometers and are clearly not the closest. This leaves Ontario and Nunavut as the main candidates.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Compare Ontario and Nunavut.**\n    *   **Ontario:** The border between Quebec and Ontario runs north-south, eventually reaching the southern coast of James Bay. Waskaganish is located on the eastern side of James Bay, while the western side is Ontario. The land border between the two provinces is a relatively short distance to the west and southwest of Waskaganish. A visual inspection on a map shows this distance to be only a few tens of kilometers.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The part of Nunavut closest to Waskaganish consists of the islands in James Bay. The most significant and nearest of these islands is Akimiski Island. Akimiski Island is located in the middle of James Bay, far to the northwest of Waskaganish. The distance across the water from Waskaganish to the southern tip of Akimiski Island is well over 100 kilometers. Other smaller islands belonging to Nunavut are also farther away than the Ontario border.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the Analysis**\nBy comparing the geographical locations, the land border with the province of Ontario is significantly closer to Waskaganish than any of the islands belonging to the territory of Nunavut. The proximity is a matter of a few dozen kilometers to Ontario versus over a hundred kilometers to Nunavut.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec, is Ontario.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
