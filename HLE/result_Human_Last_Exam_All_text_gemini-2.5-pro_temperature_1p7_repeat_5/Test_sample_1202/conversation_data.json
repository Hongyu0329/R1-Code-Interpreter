    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks for the most probable (i.e., \"most likely\") molecular mechanism that explains how duplicate genes are both kept in the genome (\"retention\") and evolve to become different from each other (\"divergence\") in eukaryotes. The implicit assumption is that both copies remain functional.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Possible Fates of a Duplicated Gene:** When a gene is duplicated, the new copy is initially redundant. This redundancy can lead to several outcomes:\n    *   **Loss (Pseudogenization):** The most common outcome. One copy accumulates disabling mutations and becomes a non-functional pseudogene because there is no selective pressure to maintain its function.\n    *   **Retention with Divergence:** Both copies are kept but evolve differently. This is the scenario the question is about. The main theoretical models to explain this are neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where a region of DNA from one gene copy is \"copied\" onto the other homologous gene copy. This mechanism tends to make the genes *more similar* to each other, a process called concerted evolution. Therefore, it works against divergence and is not the correct answer.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a gene becomes non-functional. While it represents a form of divergence (the sequence of the pseudogene diverges from the functional gene), it is a mechanism of gene *loss*, not gene *retention* in a functional state. The question asks how functional duplicates are retained.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This model proposes that one gene copy retains the original, ancestral function, while the second copy is free from purifying selection and accumulates mutations. Occasionally, one of these mutations confers a completely new, beneficial function. Natural selection will then act to preserve this new gene. This mechanism successfully explains both the *retention* of the two copies (one for the old function, one for the new) and their *divergence*. This is a strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also known as the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation model) proposes that the ancestral gene had multiple functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times. After duplication, the two copies accumulate different degenerative mutations, such that each copy loses a different sub-function. For example, copy 1 might lose the ability to be expressed in the liver, while copy 2 loses the ability to be expressed in the kidney. Now, both copies are required to perform the full set of original ancestral functions. This process ensures the *retention* of both genes and leads to their *divergence* as they specialize. This is also a strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macroevolutionary concept describing the rapid diversification of a lineage into many new species. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is not a molecular mechanism for the retention of individual genes. This answer operates at the wrong level of biological organization.\n\n4.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates (Neofunctionalization vs. Subfunctionalization):** Both neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization are accepted mechanisms for the retention and divergence of duplicated genes. The question asks for the *most likely* mechanism.\n    *   Neofunctionalization requires a rare event: the evolution of a new, beneficial function (a gain-of-function mutation).\n    *   Subfunctionalization relies on more common events: the accumulation of degenerative mutations (loss-of-function mutations) in different parts of the duplicated genes.\n    *   Because loss-of-function mutations are far more frequent than gain-of-function mutations, the subfunctionalization model provides a more passive and statistically probable path for the initial preservation of both gene copies following a duplication event. It effectively \"rescues\" both duplicates from the more common fate of pseudogenization. Therefore, many evolutionary biologists consider subfunctionalization to be a more likely or frequent mechanism for the widespread retention of duplicate genes.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, while both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization explain the retention and divergence of duplicate genes, Subfunctionalization is considered the more likely mechanism because it relies on more frequent mutational events (loss-of-function) compared to the rare beneficial mutations required for Neofunctionalization.\n\n<<<D>>>"
