    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited Jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the core components of the question.**\n*   **Game:** 100BB deep cash game. This is the standard stack depth, so typical strategies apply.\n*   **Rake-Free:** This is a crucial detail. In a standard game, the rake makes very marginal hands unprofitable. The absence of rake means we don't have to overcome this small fee, making slightly weaker hands profitable opens. Therefore, our opening range should be slightly wider than in a raked game.\n*   **Position:** Button (BTN). This is the most profitable position in poker. We are guaranteed to act last post-flop, which is a massive advantage. This allows us to open the widest range of any position. A typical BTN opening range is 40-50% of all possible hands.\n*   **Action:** Open-raising to 2.5x. This is a standard opening size.\n*   **Question:** What is the \"worst suited Jack\" you *should* open? This asks for the hand at the absolute bottom of the opening range that is a suited Jack. In other words, we need to find the weakest suited Jack that is still a profitable (+EV) open.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the hierarchy of suited Jack hands.**\nSuited Jack hands are ranked primarily by the strength of their other card (the kicker). A higher kicker means you make a stronger top pair and have better high-card value. Secondly, connectivity (the proximity of the two card ranks) is important for making straights.\n*   **Premium Suited Jacks:** AJs, KJs, QJs are premium hands.\n*   **Strong Suited Connectors/Gappers:** JTs, J9s, J8s are very strong drawing hands.\n*   **Weaker Suited Jacks:** This leaves us with J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s.\n\nThe ranking within this weaker group is as follows: J7s > J6s > J5s > J4s > J3s > J2s. The higher the second card, the better. J2s has the worst possible kicker and the least connectivity for making straights.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the cutoff point for opening.**\nGiven our huge positional advantage on the button and the rake-free environment, our opening range is very wide. Standard GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategies show that even in raked games, the button should open a significant number of hands. The profitability of these opens comes from several factors:\n1.  **Fold Equity:** The blinds will fold to our raise a large percentage of the time, letting us win the pot uncontested.\n2.  **Positional Advantage:** When we get called, we act last on every street, which allows us to realize our equity more effectively.\n3.  **Playability:** Suited hands are particularly valuable as they can flop powerful flush draws, giving them good equity and playability post-flop.\n\nIn a standard 100BB GTO button opening range, *all* suited Jacks (from AJs down to J2s) are considered standard, profitable opens. The combination of holding a decent high card (the Jack) and the potential to make a flush makes even the weakest suited Jack, J2s, a +EV open. The fact that the game is rake-free only solidifies this conclusion, making this marginal open even more clearly profitable.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude and identify the worst hand.**\nSince all suited Jacks are profitable opens from the button in this scenario, the \"worst\" one that we *should still open* is the weakest one in the group. As established in Step 2, the weakest suited Jack hand is the one with the lowest kicker.\n\nTherefore, the worst suited jack you should open is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
