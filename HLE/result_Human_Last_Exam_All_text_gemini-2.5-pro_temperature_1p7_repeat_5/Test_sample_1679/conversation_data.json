    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe goal is to identify the *first* film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture and included an on-screen depiction of a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n### **Step 2: Identify the Luxor Obelisks**\nThis is a critical first step. The \"Luxor Obelisks\" are a pair of obelisks from the Luxor Temple in Egypt. It is crucial to know their current locations:\n1.  One obelisk remains at the entrance to the **Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt**.\n2.  The second obelisk was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the **Place de la Concorde in Paris, France**.\n\nTherefore, the film in question could be set in either Egypt or Paris.\n\n### **Step 3: Chronological Review of Best Picture Winners**\nWe must go through the list of Best Picture winners starting from the first award (1927/1928) and check the setting and key scenes of each film.\n\n*   **1920s-1930s:** Early winners like *Wings* (1927/28), *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1929/30), *Grand Hotel* (1931/32), and *It Happened One Night* (1934) are set in America, on the WWI front lines, or in other European cities like Berlin and London. None of these settings would include a Luxor Obelisk.\n*   ***The Life of Emile Zola* (1937):** This film is set in Paris and is a potential early candidate. However, its story focuses on indoor locations like courtrooms, offices, and apartments. An analysis of the film reveals it does not feature any prominent establishing shots of the Place de la Concorde.\n*   **1940s:** Winners like *Rebecca* (1940), *How Green Was My Valley* (1941), and *The Best Years of Our Lives* (1946) are set in England, Wales, and the American Midwest, respectively.\n*   ***Casablanca* (1943):** This film is another strong candidate due to its famous flashback sequence set in Paris. This montage includes iconic shots of Rick and Ilsa by the Seine and the Nazi army marching down the Champs-Élysées towards the Arc de Triomphe. However, the Place de la Concorde, which is at the opposite end of the Champs-Élysées, and its obelisk are not shown.\n*   **Late 1940s:** Films like *Gentleman's Agreement* (1947) and *All the King's Men* (1949) are set in the United States.\n\n### **Step 4: Pinpointing the Correct Film**\n*   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** The title itself suggests a high probability. This musical is a vibrant celebration of the city of Paris.\n    *   **Scene Analysis:** The film contains numerous scenes shot and set around Parisian landmarks. There is a notable scene where the main characters, Jerry (Gene Kelly) and Lise (Leslie Caron), walk by the fountains in the **Place de la Concorde**, with the Luxor Obelisk clearly visible in the background.\n    *   **Ballet Sequence:** Furthermore, the film's famous 17-minute final ballet sequence features stylized sets inspired by French painters. One of these elaborate sets is a recreation of the Place de la Concorde, with the obelisk as a central feature.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nHaving chronologically reviewed the Best Picture winners, we find no evidence of a Luxor Obelisk appearing in a winning film before 1951. *The Life of Emile Zola* and *Casablanca*, despite their Parisian settings, do not feature the landmark. *An American in Paris* is the first winner to definitively show the obelisk in the Place de la Concorde.\n\n***\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **The existence of two obelisks:** Acknowledging the obelisks in both Luxor and Paris widens the search but ultimately points to films set in Paris, as they appeared earlier among the winners.\n*   **\"First\" is key:** The analysis must be chronological.\n*   **\"Depicted on-screen\" is key:** The landmark must actually appear visually, not just be referenced in dialogue. A film being \"set in Paris\" is not sufficient proof.\n*   **Confirmation of absence:** It is as important to confirm that earlier films *do not* show the obelisk as it is to confirm that a later film *does*.\n\n***\n\n<<<An American in Paris>>>"
