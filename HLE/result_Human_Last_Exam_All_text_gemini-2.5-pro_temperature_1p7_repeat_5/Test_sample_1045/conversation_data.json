    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene (C7H8).\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem\n\n*   **Molecule:** Toluene\n*   **Molecular Formula:** C7H8\n*   **Composition:** 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G\n*   **Goal:** Find the total number of **contracted Gaussian functions** (CGFs), also known as basis functions.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\n\nThe Pople-style basis set notation \"6-31G\" provides the recipe for constructing the basis functions for each atom. We need to interpret it for both heavy atoms (Carbon) and Hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **For Heavy Atoms (like Carbon):**\n    *   **`6-`**: This part describes the **core** orbitals. The core orbitals (1s for Carbon) are described by a single contracted Gaussian function (CGF), which is formed from a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n        *   Contribution: **1 CGF** for the core.\n    *   **`-31G`**: This part describes the **valence** orbitals. The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts (a split-valence or double-zeta valence basis set).\n        *   **`3`**: The *inner* part of the valence shell is described by one CGF per atomic orbital (AO). Each CGF is contracted from **3** PGFs. For Carbon (valence shell n=2), this includes the 2s and the three 2p (2px, 2py, 2pz) orbitals.\n            *   Contribution: **1 CGF** (for 2s) + **3 CGFs** (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n        *   **`1`**: The *outer* part of the valence shell is described by one CGF per AO. Each CGF is uncontracted, consisting of only **1** PGF. This also applies to the 2s and three 2p orbitals.\n            *   Contribution: **1 CGF** (for 2s) + **3 CGFs** (for 2p) = **4 CGFs**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen Atoms:**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons, so the `6-` prefix does not apply. We only use the valence description `-31G`.\n    *   **`3`**: The *inner* part of the 1s valence orbital is described by one CGF contracted from **3** PGFs.\n        *   Contribution: **1 CGF**.\n    *   **`1`**: The *outer* part of the 1s valence orbital is described by one CGF made from **1** PGF.\n        *   Contribution: **1 CGF**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Contracted Functions per Atom\n\n*   **For one Carbon (C) atom:**\n    *   Core (1s): 1 CGF\n    *   Inner Valence (2s, 2p): 4 CGFs\n    *   Outer Valence (2s, 2p): 4 CGFs\n    *   **Total per C atom = 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 CGFs**\n\n*   **For one Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   Inner Valence (1s): 1 CGF\n    *   Outer Valence (1s): 1 CGF\n    *   **Total per H atom = 1 + 1 = 2 CGFs**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Functions for Toluene (C7H8)\n\nNow, we multiply the number of functions per atom by the number of atoms of that type in the molecule and sum them up.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon:**\n    *   7 C atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = **63 CGFs**\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen:**\n    *   8 H atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = **16 CGFs**\n\n*   **Total Contracted Gaussian Functions:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (CGFs from Carbon) + (CGFs from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = **79**\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question asks for **contracted** functions (basis functions), not primitive functions. The numbers in the basis set name (6, 3, 1) refer to the number of *primitives* used to build the contracted functions.\n2.  **Hydrogen vs. Heavy Atoms:** The interpretation of the basis set notation is different for hydrogen (no core electrons) compared to second-row elements like carbon.\n3.  **Splitting of Valence Shells:** The \"split\" applies to each atomic orbital in the valence shell. For carbon, this includes one s-type and three p-type orbitals.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nTotal functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\nTotal functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal functions = 63 + 16\nTotal functions = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
