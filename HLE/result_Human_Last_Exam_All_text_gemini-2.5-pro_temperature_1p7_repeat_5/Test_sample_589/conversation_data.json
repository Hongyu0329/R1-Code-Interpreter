    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question's Key Elements**\nThe question asks for a specific scene from a film with several distinct criteria:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio.\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Prop:** The teenager is riding a pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Filtering**\nMany films feature teenagers on bikes (*E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial*, *The Goonies*, *It*), but the specific details are crucial.\n*   In *E.T.*, Elliott's bike is a red Kuwahara BMX.\n*   In *The Goonies*, none of the main characters have a prominent pink bike, nor is there a scene of pedaling directly at a car.\n*   In the 2017 film *It*, Beverly Marsh rides a blue Huffy bike.\n*   In *Footloose* (1984), there is a famous scene of playing \"chicken\" with an oncoming vehicle, but it involves two tractors, not a bike and a car.\n\nThe most critical and unique identifiers are the **pink bike** and the action of **pedaling toward an oncoming car**. This combination points to a very specific and memorable scene.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Correct Film and Scene**\nThe film that matches all the criteria is **Now and Then** (1995).\n\n**Step 4: Careful Analysis of Each Element in \"Now and Then\"**\nLet's verify how the film and the specific scene align with each point from the question.\n\n1.  **Hollywood Feature Film:** Yes, *Now and Then* is a mainstream American coming-of-age feature film.\n2.  **Major Film Studio:** It was produced and distributed by New Line Cinema, which was operating as a major independent studio (a \"mini-major\") at the time and is now a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Pictures.\n3.  **Teenager:** The scene takes place in the summer of 1970, where the four main characters are 12 years old. While technically \"pre-teens,\" they are on the verge of being teenagers, and the actress who plays the character in question, Ashleigh Aston Moore, was 13-14 during filming. In the context of a film query, this age group is generally considered to fit the \"teenager\" description.\n4.  **Pink Bike:** The character Chrissy DeWitt is well-known for her bike: a classic pink Schwinn bicycle, complete with a white wicker basket, handlebars with streamers, and a banana seat.\n5.  **Pedals Directly Toward an Oncoming Car:** There is a pivotal scene where the four girls are riding their bikes. The local bullies, the Wormer brothers, drive their car aggressively toward the girls. Three of the girls quickly swerve to safety. However, Chrissy, who is portrayed as the most naive and sheltered of the group, panics. Instead of turning away, she freezes and continues to pedal slowly but directly into the path of the oncoming car. The driver is forced to swerve violently at the last second to avoid hitting her.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nThe scene with Chrissy DeWitt on her pink bike in *Now and Then* perfectly matches every specific detail laid out in the question. The combination of the character's age, the iconic pink bike, and the dramatic confrontation with the car makes this the definitive answer.\n\n<<<Now and Then>>>"
