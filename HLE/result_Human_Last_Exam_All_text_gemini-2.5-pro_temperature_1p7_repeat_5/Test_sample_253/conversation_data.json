    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the final binary pattern.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand Cellular Automaton Rule 110**\n\nAn elementary cellular automaton consists of a 1D grid of cells, each with a state of 0 or 1. The state of a cell in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its left and right neighbors. There are $2^3 = 8$ possible patterns for a 3-cell neighborhood. A rule is a function that maps each of these 8 patterns to a new state (0 or 1) for the central cell.\n\nThe rule number is the decimal representation of the 8-bit binary string formed by the outputs for each neighborhood, ordered from `111` down to `000`.\n\nTo find the rules for Rule 110, we convert the decimal number 110 to an 8-bit binary number:\n$110_{10} = 01101110_2$.\n\nNow, we map this binary string to the 8 neighborhoods:\n\n| Current Neighborhood | Next State of Center Cell |\n| :------------------- | :------------------------ |\n| 111                  | **0**                     |\n| 110                  | **1**                     |\n| 101                  | **1**                     |\n| 100                  | **0**                     |\n| 011                  | **1**                     |\n| 010                  | **1**                     |\n| 001                  | **1**                     |\n| 000                  | **0**                     |\n\n### **Step 2: Define Initial State and Apply the Rule Iteratively**\n\nWe start with a single cell in state 1, surrounded by an infinite number of cells in state 0. We will only write the \"interesting\" part of the pattern (the part containing 1s, with some padding of 0s). We will apply the rule set from Step 1 for 20 generations.\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n    *(Padded for calculation: `...00100...`)*\n\n*   **Gen 1:**\n    *   Neighbors `001` -> `1`\n    *   Neighbors `010` -> `1`\n    *   Neighbors `100` -> `0`\n    *   **Result:** `110`\n\n*   **Gen 2:** (from `...01100...`)\n    *   `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `110`->`1`, `100`->`0`\n    *   **Result:** `1110`\n\n*   **Gen 3:** (from `...01110...`)\n    *   `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `111`->`0`, `110`->`1`, `100`->`0`\n    *   **Result:** `11010`\n\n*   **Gen 4:** (from `...011010...`)\n    *   `001`->`1`, `011`->`1`, `110`->`1`, `101`->`1`, `010`->`1`, `100`->`0`\n    *   **Result:** `111110`\n\nThis manual process is continued for all 20 steps. Each step must be calculated perfectly, as any error will propagate. Below is the pattern for each generation:\n\n*   **Gen 0:** `1`\n*   **Gen 1:** `110`\n*   **Gen 2:** `1110`\n*   **Gen 3:** `11010`\n*   **Gen 4:** `111110`\n*   **Gen 5:** `1100010`\n*   **Gen 6:** `11100110`\n*   **Gen 7:** `110101110`\n*   **Gen 8:** `1111111010`\n*   **Gen 9:** `1100001110`\n*   **Gen 10:** `1110011010`\n*   **Gen 11:** `11010111110`\n*   **Gen 12:** `111111100010`\n*   **Gen 13:** `110000100110`\n*   **Gen 14:** `111001101110`\n*   **Gen 15:** `1101011111010`\n*   **Gen 16:** `11111110001110`\n*   **Gen 17:** `11000010011010`\n*   **Gen 18:** `11100110111110`\n*   **Gen 19:** `110101111100010`\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the 20th Generation**\n\nWe calculate the final pattern for generation 20 based on the pattern from generation 19 (`110101111100010`). We apply the rules to every 3-cell neighborhood of the padded version `...0011010111110001000...`\n\nLet's compute the new state for each potential position:\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `010` -> **1**\n*   `101` -> **1**\n*   `011` -> **1**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `111` -> **0**\n*   `110` -> **1**\n*   `100` -> **0**\n*   `000` -> **0**\n*   `001` -> **1**\n*   `010` -> **1**\n*   `100` -> **0**\n\nAssembling these new states gives the final pattern.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nAfter 20 applications of Rule 110, the resulting binary pattern is:\n`1111111000100110`\n\n<<<1111111000100110>>>"
