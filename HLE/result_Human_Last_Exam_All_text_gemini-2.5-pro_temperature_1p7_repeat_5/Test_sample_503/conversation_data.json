    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category $\\mathcal{C}$ from an object $A$ to an object $B$ consists of a pair of 1-morphisms $L: A \\to B$ (the left adjoint) and $R: B \\to A$ (the right adjoint), along with two 2-morphisms, the unit $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_A \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$ and the counit $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_B$, satisfying the triangle identities.\n\nIn this problem, the 2-category is the simplex category $\\Delta$.\n*   **Objects:** Finite ordinals $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n*   **1-morphisms:** Order-preserving maps $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\n*   **2-morphisms:** For two parallel 1-morphisms $f, g: [m] \\to [n]$, there is a unique 2-morphism $f \\Rightarrow g$ if and only if $f \\le g$ in the pointwise order, meaning $f(i) \\le g(i)$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n\nSo, an internal adjunction in $\\Delta$ from $[m]$ to $[n]$ is a pair of order-preserving maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, such that:\n1.  There exists a unit 2-morphism $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\Rightarrow R \\circ L$. This means $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$, i.e., $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  There exists a counit 2-morphism $\\epsilon: L \\circ R \\Rightarrow \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This means $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$, i.e., $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\nThe triangle identities are automatically satisfied because in a poset (the hom-sets are posets), there is at most one morphism between any two objects.\n\nThese two conditions are precisely the definition of a Galois connection (or a poset adjunction), usually written as $L \\dashv R$. This is equivalent to the condition that for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$:\n$L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$.\n\nAn adjunction is determined by either its left adjoint or its right adjoint.\n1.  **Given $L$, when does a right adjoint $R$ exist?**\n    An order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint if and only if it preserves all suprema (joins). The objects $[k]$ are finite total orders, and thus complete lattices. For an arbitrary subset $S \\subseteq [m]$, its supremum is its maximum element, $\\max(S)$. For a non-empty set $S$, any order-preserving map between chains satisfies $L(\\max S) = \\max(L(S))$. However, we must also consider the supremum of the empty set, which is the bottom element.\n    *   $\\sup(\\emptyset)$ in $[m]$ is $0$.\n    *   $\\sup(L(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(\\emptyset)$ in $[n]$ is $0$.\n    So, for $L$ to preserve the empty join, we must have $L(\\sup(\\emptyset)) = \\sup(L(\\emptyset))$, which translates to $L(0) = 0$.\n    If $L(0)=0$, then for any non-empty $S \\subseteq [m]$, $L(\\max S) = \\max(L(S))$. Thus, an order-preserving map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint if and only if $L(0)=0$.\n\n2.  **Given $R$, when does a left adjoint $L$ exist?**\n    An order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint if and only if it preserves all infima (meets). For a non-empty subset $S \\subseteq [n]$, any order-preserving map between chains satisfies $R(\\min S) = \\min(R(S))$. We must also consider the infimum of the empty set, which is the top element.\n    *   $\\inf(\\emptyset)$ in $[n]$ is $n$.\n    *   $\\inf(R(\\emptyset)) = \\inf(\\emptyset)$ in $[m]$ is $m$.\n    So, for $R$ to preserve the empty meet, we must have $R(\\inf(\\emptyset)) = \\inf(R(\\emptyset))$, which translates to $R(n) = m$.\n    Thus, an order-preserving map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint if and only if $R(n)=m$.\n\nThe number of adjunctions is the number of valid left adjoints $L$, which is also the number of valid right adjoints $R$. We can count either.\nLet's count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ such that $L(0)=0$. For this question, $m=23$ and $n=37$.\nWe need to count the number of order-preserving maps $L: [23] \\to [37]$ with $L(0)=0$.\nSuch a map is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $0 \\le L(0) \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. The problem reduces to counting sequences $L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ such that $0 \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThis is equivalent to choosing 23 numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ (which has $37+1=38$ elements) with replacement, where the order of selection does not matter (as they will be sorted into a non-decreasing sequence).\nThis is a stars-and-bars problem. The number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $p$ items with replacement is given by the multiset coefficient $\\left(\\!\\!{p \\choose k}\\!\\!\\right) = \\binom{p+k-1}{k}$.\nHere, $k=23$ (the number of values to choose) and $p=38$ (the number of available options).\nThe number of such sequences is $\\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nAlternatively, one can recognize that counting sequences $0 \\le L(1) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$ is the same as counting order-preserving maps from $[22]$ to $[37]$.\nFor a map $f: [a] \\to [b]$, the number of such maps is $\\binom{b+a+1}{a+1}$.\nHere, $a=22$ and $b=37$.\nThe number is $\\binom{37+22+1}{22+1} = \\binom{60}{23}$.\n\nLet's check this by counting the valid right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$.\nWe need to count order-preserving maps with $R(37)=23$.\nThis means counting sequences $R(0), \\dots, R(36)$ such that $0 \\le R(0) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le 23$.\nThis is equivalent to counting order-preserving maps from $[36]$ to $[23]$.\nHere, $a=36$ and $b=23$.\nThe number is $\\binom{23+36+1}{36+1} = \\binom{60}{37}$.\nSince $\\binom{60}{23} = \\binom{60}{60-23} = \\binom{60}{37}$, the two methods agree.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions in $\\Delta$ from $[23]$ to $[37]$ is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n$\\binom{60}{23} = \\frac{60!}{23! (60-23)!} = \\frac{60!}{23! 37!}$\n\nThe question asks for the final answer, which is this number."
