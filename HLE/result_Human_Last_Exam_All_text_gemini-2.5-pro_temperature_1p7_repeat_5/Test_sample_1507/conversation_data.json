    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Object - The Great Icosahedron**\nThe great icosahedron is one of the four Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra, which are non-convex regular polyhedra. It is characterized by its 20 intersecting triangular faces, 30 edges, and 12 vertices. The key feature is that its faces pass through its interior, creating a complex, self-intersecting shape.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Core of the Question - The \"Outer-Hull\"**\nThe question asks about the triangulation of the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron. The outer-hull of any set of points (in this case, the vertices of the great icosahedron) is its **convex hull**. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape that completely contains all the points. For a polyhedron, it's like shrink-wrapping a plastic film around it; the resulting shape is the convex hull.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Outer-Hull**\nThe 12 vertices of the great icosahedron are located at the exact same positions as the 12 vertices of a regular **convex icosahedron**. Therefore, the convex hull of the vertices of a great icosahedron is simply a regular convex icosahedron. The intricate, intersecting faces of the great icosahedron are all contained within this convex hull.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Surface of the Outer-Hull (the Regular Icosahedron)**\nA regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid. Its surface is composed entirely of triangles. Specifically, it has:\n*   **20 Faces:** All of which are identical equilateral triangles.\n*   **30 Edges**\n*   **12 Vertices**\n\n**Step 5: Understand \"Triangulating\" and \"Minimal Number\"**\nThe term \"triangulating\" a surface means to divide it into a set of non-overlapping triangles. The question asks for the *minimal number* of triangles required for this task.\n*   **Careful Point:** Since the surface of the regular icosahedron is already made up of 20 triangles, it is already a valid triangulation. You cannot form a closed surface like an icosahedron with fewer than its constituent 20 triangular faces. Therefore, the minimal number of triangles required for the triangulation is simply the number of faces the icosahedron has.\n\n**Step 6: Address \"Visible Triangles from the Outside\"**\nThis phrase confirms our interpretation. When viewing the great icosahedron from the outside, the only parts one can see are the faces of its convex hull. The intersecting internal faces are obscured. The \"visible triangles\" are therefore the 20 triangular faces of the regular icosahedron that forms the outer-hull.\n\n**Conclusion**\n1.  The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular convex icosahedron.\n2.  A regular icosahedron's surface is composed of 20 triangular faces.\n3.  This existing structure is the most efficient (minimal) triangulation of its surface.\n4.  Therefore, the minimal number of triangles needed is 20.\n\n<<<20>>>"
