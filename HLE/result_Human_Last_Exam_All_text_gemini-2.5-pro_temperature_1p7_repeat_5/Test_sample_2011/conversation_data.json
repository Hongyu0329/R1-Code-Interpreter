    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Question**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of *different* clique sizes that a single graph on `n=128` vertices can contain. The crucial constraint is that these cliques must be **induced subgraphs**.\n\nLet's break down the terminology:\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** A graph `G = (V, E)` where the number of vertices `|V|` is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge). A clique of size `s` is denoted `K_s`.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices `S ⊆ V`, the induced subgraph `G[S]` consists of the vertices in `S` and *all* the edges from `E` that have both endpoints in `S`.\n*   **Simultaneously Appear:** We need to find a single graph `G` that contains all these differently sized cliques as induced subgraphs.\n*   **Maximum Possible Number:** We are not asked for the sizes of the cliques, but for the maximum count of how many distinct sizes are possible.\n\n**2. The Key Insight: Induced Cliques Imply Smaller Induced Cliques**\n\nLet's consider what it means for a graph `G` to have an induced clique of a certain size.\nSuppose `G` has an induced subgraph that is a clique of size `s_max`. This means there is a set of vertices, let's call it `V_max`, with `|V_max| = s_max`, such that every pair of vertices in `V_max` is connected by an edge in `G`.\n\nNow, let's consider any smaller size `s`, where `1 ≤ s ≤ s_max`. Can we find an induced clique of size `s`?\nYes. We can simply choose any subset of `s` vertices from `V_max`. Let's call this smaller subset `S`.\n*   The vertices of `S` are a subset of the vertices of `V_max`.\n*   Since every pair of vertices in `V_max` is connected, every pair of vertices in its subset `S` must also be connected.\n*   The subgraph induced by `S`, denoted `G[S]`, will therefore be a complete graph on `s` vertices, which is a clique `K_s`.\n\nThis leads to a powerful conclusion: **If a graph contains an induced clique of size `s_max`, it must also contain induced cliques of all sizes `s` where `1 ≤ s ≤ s_max`.**\n\n**3. Reformulating the Problem**\n\nBased on the insight from Step 2, the set of all possible induced clique sizes in any given graph `G` will be `{1, 2, ..., ω(G)}`, where `ω(G)` is the size of the largest clique in `G`. The number of elements in this set is simply `ω(G)`.\n\nTherefore, the problem \"determine the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\" is equivalent to the problem \"determine the maximum possible size of a clique (`ω(G)`) in a graph `G` on 128 vertices\".\n\n**4. Solving the Simplified Problem**\n\nWe want to find the maximum possible value of `ω(G)` for any graph `G` with `n=128` vertices.\n*   A clique is a set of vertices. By definition, the size of a clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\n*   Therefore, for any graph `G` on 128 vertices, its clique number `ω(G)` must be less than or equal to 128.\n    `ω(G) ≤ 128`.\n\nThis establishes an upper bound. The maximum number of different clique sizes cannot be more than 128.\n\n**5. Proving the Maximum is Achievable**\n\nTo show that 128 is indeed the maximum, we must demonstrate that there exists at least one graph `G` on 128 vertices that achieves this.\n\nConsider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, `K_128`. In this graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n*   Let's find the size of the largest clique, `ω(K_{128})`. The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique. So, `ω(K_{128}) = 128`.\n*   Based on our logic in Step 3, this graph must contain induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to 128.\n*   Let's verify this explicitly. To find an induced clique of any size `s` (where `1 ≤ s ≤ 128`), simply select any `s` vertices from `K_{128}`. The subgraph induced by these `s` vertices is, by definition of a complete graph, a clique `K_s`.\n\nSince the `K_{128}` graph contains induced cliques of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., 128, it contains exactly 128 different clique sizes.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nWe have established two key facts:\n1.  The number of different induced clique sizes in a graph on 128 vertices cannot exceed 128.\n2.  The number 128 is achievable, as demonstrated by the complete graph `K_{128}`.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** The \"induced\" requirement is critical. Without it, the problem could be interpreted differently. However, the logic that a large clique implies the existence of all smaller cliques holds true for induced subgraphs, which simplifies the problem.\n*   **Clique vs. Clique Number:** The question asks for the number of different sizes, not the size of the largest clique. However, our analysis shows these two values are equivalent in this context.\n*   **Existence of a Single Graph:** The problem requires all clique sizes to exist in one graph. Our construction of `K_{128}` satisfies this.\n\n<<<128>>>"
