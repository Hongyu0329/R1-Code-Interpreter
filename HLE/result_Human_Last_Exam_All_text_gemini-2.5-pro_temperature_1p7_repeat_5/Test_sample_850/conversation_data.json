    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the achiral and non-polar crystal classes that have the correct symmetry for optical activity.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Symmetry Requirements for Each Property**\n\nWe need to translate the given properties (achiral, non-polar, allows optical activity) into specific symmetry rules for crystal classes (point groups).\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** A crystal can exhibit optical activity (rotate the plane of polarized light) only if its point group symmetry does not include a center of inversion (symbol ī or generated by other operations) or a mirror plane (symbol m). A crystal possessing either of these symmetry elements cannot be optically active.\n*   **Achiral:** A crystal is achiral if its structure is superimposable on its mirror image. The symmetry condition for achirality is the presence of at least one improper rotation axis. Improper rotation axes include a center of inversion (S₂ or ī), a mirror plane (S₁ or m), or a rotoinversion axis (S_n or n-bar). The 11 crystal classes that lack *any* improper rotation axes are called chiral. Therefore, an achiral class is any class that is **not** one of the 11 chiral classes.\n*   **Non-polar:** A crystal is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar direction (i.e., a direction that is not equivalent to its opposite by any symmetry operation). The 10 crystal classes that do have such a unique direction are called the polar classes (also known as pyroelectric classes). Therefore, a non-polar class is any class that is **not** one of the 10 polar classes.\n\n### **Step 2: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes based on Optical Activity**\n\nFirst, we will identify all crystal classes that allow for optical activity by eliminating those with a center of inversion or a mirror plane.\n\n*   **The 32 Crystal Classes (Point Groups) in Hermann-Mauguin notation:**\n    *   1, ī, 2, m, 2/m, 222, mm2, mmm, 4, 4, 422, 4mm, 42m, 4/m, 4/mmm, 3, 3, 32, 3m, 3m, 6, 6, 622, 6mm, 6m2, 6/m, 6/mmm, 23, 432, m3, 43m, m3m.\n\n*   **Eliminate classes with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric):**\n    *   ī, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, 3, 3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m3, m3m. (11 classes eliminated).\n\n*   **Eliminate remaining classes with a mirror plane:**\n    *   m, mm2, 4mm, 42m, 3m, 6mm, 6m2, 43m. (8 classes eliminated).\n    *   The class 6 (rotoinversion axis) must also be checked. A 6 operation generates a horizontal mirror plane (6³ = m). Therefore, class 6 is also eliminated.\n\n*   **Crystal classes that REMAIN (can be optically active):**\n    *   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432 (these are the 11 chiral classes).\n    *   4 (the class with a 4-fold rotoinversion axis).\n\nWe are now left with 12 candidate classes.\n\n### **Step 3: Apply the \"Achiral\" Condition**\n\nFrom the 12 candidates that can be optically active, we must now select only those that are achiral.\n\n*   **Candidates for optical activity:** {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432, 4}\n*   **Achiral condition:** The class must possess an improper rotation axis.\n*   The first 11 classes in the list ({1, 2, 3...432}) are, by definition, the **chiral** crystal classes. They only contain proper rotation axes. Thus, they must be eliminated.\n*   The only remaining candidate is **4**. This class is defined by a 4-fold rotoinversion axis (4), which is an improper rotation. Therefore, class 4 is achiral.\n\nAfter this step, only one candidate remains: the crystal class 4.\n\n### **Step 4: Apply the \"Non-polar\" Condition**\n\nFinally, we must check if our single remaining candidate, class 4, is non-polar.\n\n*   **The 10 Polar Crystal Classes are:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n*   The candidate class is **4**.\n*   We need to compare our candidate with the list of polar classes. The class 4 (with a 4-fold *rotoinversion* axis) is **not** in the list of the 10 polar classes. The class '4' (with a 4-fold *proper rotation* axis) is polar, but that is a different class.\n*   Since 4 is not in the list of polar classes, it is **non-polar**.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe crystal class 4 satisfies all three conditions:\n1.  **Allows optical activity:** It has no center of inversion or mirror planes.\n2.  **Is achiral:** It has a 4-fold rotoinversion axis, which is an improper rotation.\n3.  **Is non-polar:** It is not one of the 10 polar point groups.\n\nTherefore, there is only one crystal class that meets all the specified criteria.\n\n<<<4>>>"
