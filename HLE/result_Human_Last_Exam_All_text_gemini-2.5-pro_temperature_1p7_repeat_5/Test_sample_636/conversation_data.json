    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### **Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n**1. Define System Matrices and Desired Eigenvalues**\nWe are given the system matrices:\nA =  \n`[[-1, 1],\n [ 1, 0]]`\n\nB =  \n`[[1, 2],\n [1, 0]]`\n\nThe state feedback control law is of the form `u = Fx`, leading to the closed-loop system `ẋ = (A + BF)x`. The state feedback gain matrix F is a 2x2 matrix. Let's define it as:\nF =  \n`[[f1, f2],\n [f3, f4]]`\n\nThe desired eigenvalues for the closed-loop system `A + BF` are given as `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\nA system with eigenvalues `p1` and `p2` has a characteristic polynomial `P_d(s) = (s - p1)(s - p2)`.\nGiven `p1 = -1 + j` and `p2 = -1 - j`:\n`P_d(s) = (s - (-1 + j))(s - (-1 - j))`\n`P_d(s) = ((s + 1) - j)((s + 1) + j)`\nUsing the identity `(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2`, with `x = s + 1` and `y = j`:\n`P_d(s) = (s + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 1 - (-1)`\n`P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`\nThis is the target characteristic polynomial for our closed-loop system.\n\n**3. Form the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl = A + BF`**\nFirst, we calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n`BF = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]]`\n`BF = [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, we add this to `A` to get the closed-loop matrix `A_cl`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[f1 + 2*f3, f2 + 2*f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 + f1 + 2*f3, 1 + f2 + 2*f4], [1 + f1, f2]]`\n\n**4. Find the Characteristic Polynomial of the Closed-Loop System**\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `P_cl(s) = det(sI - A_cl)`. For a 2x2 matrix, this can be calculated as `s^2 - tr(A_cl)s + det(A_cl)`.\n\n*   Trace of `A_cl`:\n    `tr(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3) + f2 = -1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3`\n*   Determinant of `A_cl`:\n    `det(A_cl) = (-1 + f1 + 2*f3)(f2) - (1 + f2 + 2*f4)(1 + f1)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - (1 + f1 + f2 + f1*f2 + 2*f4 + 2*f1*f4)`\n    `det(A_cl) = -1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4`\n\nSo, the characteristic polynomial is:\n`P_cl(s) = s^2 - (-1 + f1 + f2 + 2*f3)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n`P_cl(s) = s^2 + (1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3)s + (-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4)`\n\n**5. Equate Coefficients to Find F**\nWe now equate the coefficients of `P_cl(s)` with those of the desired polynomial `P_d(s) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\n\n*   Comparing the coefficients of `s`:\n    `1 - f1 - f2 - 2*f3 = 2`\n    `=> f1 + f2 + 2*f3 = -1` (Equation 1)\n*   Comparing the constant terms:\n    `-1 - f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 2`\n    `=> -f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2*f3 - 2*f4 - 2*f1*f4 = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This indicates that the solution for `F` is not unique. We can find a solution by making a simplifying choice.\n\n**6. Solve for the Gains**\nLet's choose `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0` to simplify the equations.\n\nEquation 1 becomes:\n`f1 + f2 + 2(0) = -1  => f1 + f2 = -1`\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n`-f1 - 2*f2 + 2*f2(0) - 2(0) - 2*f1(0) = 3  => -f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations with two variables:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = -1`\n2.  `-f1 - 2*f2 = 3`\n\nAdd the two equations together:\n`(f1 + f2) + (-f1 - 2*f2) = -1 + 3`\n`-f2 = 2  => f2 = -2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = -2` into the first equation:\n`f1 + (-2) = -1  => f1 = 1`\n\nSo, we have found one possible solution: `f1 = 1`, `f2 = -2`, `f3 = 0`, `f4 = 0`.\nThe resulting gain matrix `F` is:\nF =  \n`[[1, -2],\n [0,  0]]`\n\n**7. Verification (Optional)**\nLet's check our result. With `F = [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`:\n`A_cl = A + BF = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[1, -2], [0, 0]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] + [[1, -2], [1, -2]]`\n`A_cl = [[0, -1], [2, -2]]`\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of this `A_cl` is:\n`det(sI - A_cl) = det([[s, 1], [-2, s+2]]) = s(s+2) - (1)(-2) = s^2 + 2s + 2`.\nThe roots of `s^2 + 2s + 2 = 0` are `s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = -1 ± j`.\nThis matches the desired eigenvalues, so our calculated `F` is correct.\n\n### **Careful Points**\n1.  **Closed-Loop Formula:** The problem uses `A + BF`, not the more common `A - BF` (which would correspond to a control law `u = -Fx`). It's crucial to adhere to the given formulation.\n2.  **Matrix Multiplication Order:** Remember that matrix multiplication is not commutative. The calculation must be `B` multiplied by `F` (`BF`), not the other way around.\n3.  **Non-Uniqueness of Solution:** For multi-input systems (where matrix `B` has more than one column), the solution for the state feedback gain `F` that places the closed-loop poles at desired locations is generally not unique. Making a simplifying assumption, like setting some elements of `F` to zero, is a valid method to find one possible solution.\n4.  **Controllability:** Pole placement is only possible if the system `(A, B)` is controllable. For this problem, the controllability matrix `C = [B AB]` has rank 2 (the dimension of the state), so the system is controllable and arbitrary pole placement is possible.\n5.  **Complex Eigenvalues:** Desired eigenvalues must come in complex conjugate pairs for a real-valued system to ensure the resulting feedback gain matrix `F` and the closed-loop system matrix `A+BF` have real entries. The problem statement respects this (`-1 ± j`).\n\n<<<[[1, -2], [0, 0]]>>>"
