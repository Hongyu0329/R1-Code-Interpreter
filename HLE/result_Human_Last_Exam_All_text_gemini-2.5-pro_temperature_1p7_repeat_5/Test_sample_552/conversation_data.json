    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks to identify a specific person whose lectures Albert Einstein cited in a particular scientific paper.\n2.  **Identify the Specific Paper:** The paper is Einstein's 1905 work on Brownian motion. Its formal title is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\"). This is one of his four \"Annus Mirabilis\" (miracle year) papers.\n3.  **Analyze the Action:** The question states that Einstein \"cited\" \"lectures\" in this paper.\n4.  **Initial Research and a Point of Caution:** A direct examination of the 1905 Brownian motion paper reveals a crucial fact: it contains no footnotes or bibliography. Like his famous paper on special relativity from the same year, Einstein's paper on Brownian motion is notable for its lack of formal citations to other works. This suggests the premise of the question might be slightly inaccurate, a common issue in historical questions.\n5.  **Broaden the Scope to Related Work:** Given that the Brownian motion paper itself lacks citations, we should look at closely related work by Einstein from the same period. The most relevant is his PhD dissertation, also completed in 1905, titled \"Eine neue Bestimmung der Moleküldimensionen\" (\"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\"). The thesis and the Brownian motion paper are intellectually linked; the paper builds upon some ideas explored in the thesis.\n6.  **Investigate the Citations in the Thesis:** Unlike the Brownian motion paper, Einstein's PhD thesis *does* contain citations. When examining the bibliography of his thesis, we find that he referenced several scientists.\n7.  **Identify the Specific Citation:** Among the works cited in his 1905 thesis, Einstein references the work of the Austrian physicist **Ludwig Boltzmann**. Specifically, he cited Boltzmann's highly influential book, **\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\"** which translates to **\"Lectures on Gas Theory.\"**\n8.  **Synthesize the Findings:** While Einstein did not cite anyone directly in the 1905 Brownian motion paper, he did cite Ludwig Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" in his intimately related 1905 PhD thesis. Therefore, it is widely understood that the question, though technically imprecise about the exact document, is referring to this specific citation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe question asks whose lectures were cited in Einstein's 1905 Brownian motion paper. Although that specific paper contained no citations, his closely related 1905 PhD thesis cited the published \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" by Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
