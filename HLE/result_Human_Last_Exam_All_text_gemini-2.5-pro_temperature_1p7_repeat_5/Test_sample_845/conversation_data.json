    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Technology Used:** PPG (Photoplethysmography). This technology uses light to detect blood volume changes in the capillaries, which corresponds to the pulse wave generated by each heartbeat.\n    *   **Data Captured:** \"beat-to-beat intervals\". This is the core piece of information. The system is measuring the time elapsed between each successive heartbeat.\n    *   **Computed Metric:** HRV (Heart Rate Variability). The question states that HRV is computed *from* this beat-to-beat interval value.\n    *   **The Core Question:** \"What is that value called?\" We need to identify the technical name for the time duration between consecutive heartbeats.\n\n2.  **Analyze Key Concepts:**\n    *   **Heart Rate (HR):** This is the average number of beats in a given time period, usually one minute (beats per minute or BPM). It's a rate, not an interval. For example, if the time between beats is consistently 1 second, the HR is 60 BPM.\n    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** This is the measure of the *variation* in the time between heartbeats. It is not the interval itself, but a statistical calculation based on a series of these intervals (e.g., standard deviation of intervals).\n    *   **Beat-to-Beat Interval:** This is the literal description of the value being measured. It is the raw data point. In the scientific and medical community, this has a more formal name.\n\n3.  **Identify the Technical Term:**\n    *   The time measured between consecutive heartbeats is most commonly and generally referred to as the **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)**.\n    *   Sometimes the term **Beat-to-beat Interval (BBI)** is used, which is essentially the same as IBI.\n    *   If the measurement were from an ECG (Electrocardiogram), the specific term would be **R-R Interval (RRI)**, as it measures the time between the \"R\" peaks of the QRS complex in the electrical signal.\n    *   Since the question specifies PPG, which measures the pulse, the interval can also be called the **Pulse-to-pulse Interval (PPI)**.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:**\n    *   All these terms (IBI, BBI, RRI, PPI) refer to the fundamental measurement of time between heartbeats.\n    *   **Inter-beat Interval (IBI)** is the most widely accepted and technology-agnostic term that accurately describes this value. It is the direct measurement from which various HRV parameters are calculated.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value computed between heartbeats, used as the basis for calculating HRV, is called the Inter-beat Interval.\n\n<<<Inter-beat Interval>>>"
