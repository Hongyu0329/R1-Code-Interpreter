No. Polynucleotides are structurally distinct from polysaccharides. They differ in their fundamental monomer units (nucleotides vs. monosaccharides), the type of chemical bond linking these units (phosphodiester bonds vs. glycosidic bonds), and the chemical composition of their backbones (a sugar-phosphate backbone vs. a pure sugar backbone).
