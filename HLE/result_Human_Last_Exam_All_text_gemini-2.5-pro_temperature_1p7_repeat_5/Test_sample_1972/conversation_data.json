    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel in question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question into Two Core Clues**\nThe question provides two distinct descriptions attributed to Jorge Luis Borges, which must be used together to identify a specific novel.\n*   **Clue 1:** The novel has \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\"\n*   **Clue 2:** The author of the novel is described as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\"\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Clue 1**\n*   **\"The intensity of a tiger\":** This metaphor suggests a work of immense power, passion, and visceral energy. It points to a story with high emotional stakes, conflict, and a driving force that is almost primal.\n*   **\"The variety that a chess duel can achieve\":** This comparison points to intellectual and structural complexity. A chess game involves strategy, intricate plotting, multiple possibilities, and a rigorous underlying logic. This suggests the novel is masterfully constructed, with a complex plot and a deliberate, almost mathematical, design.\n*   **Combined meaning:** The novel successfully merges raw, passionate storytelling with a highly intelligent and intricate structure.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Clue 2**\n*   **\"A continuator...of Faulkner\":** This indicates that the author was heavily influenced by the American novelist William Faulkner. Key Faulknerian characteristics include:\n    *   The creation of a mythical, self-contained fictional location (like Yoknapatawpha County).\n    *   Complex, non-linear timelines and fragmented narratives.\n    *   A focus on history, memory, and the inescapable influence of the past.\n    *   Multi-generational family sagas marked by decay and tragedy.\n*   **\"(and simplifier)\":** This is a crucial qualifier. It means that while the author uses Faulkner's complex techniques, they are presented in a way that is more streamlined or accessible to the reader than Faulkner's often difficult prose.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the Clues and Identify the Author and Novel**\n*   The \"continuator of Faulkner\" clue strongly points towards the authors of the Latin American Boom, who were famously inspired by him. The most prominent of these is **Gabriel García Márquez**. García Márquez himself stated that reading Faulkner was a revelatory experience that showed him the path to his own fiction. His mythical town of Macondo is a direct parallel to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha.\n*   The description of a \"simplifier\" also fits García Márquez perfectly. While *One Hundred Years of Solitude* is structurally complex, its narrative voice and use of magical realism created a story with a universal appeal and accessibility that Faulkner's densest work does not have.\n*   Now, let's test the novel ***One Hundred Years of Solitude*** against Clue 1:\n    *   Does it have \"the intensity of a tiger\"? Absolutely. The epic sweep of the Buendía family's passions, incestuous desires, civil wars, and tragic fates is overflowing with raw energy and intensity.\n    *   Does it have \"the variety that a chess duel can achieve\"? Yes. The novel is built on an incredibly intricate structure, with its cyclical time, recurring names, complex family tree, and the overarching theme of a pre-written destiny being fulfilled, much like the inevitable conclusion of a perfectly played chess game.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBoth clues, when analyzed together, point decisively to one masterpiece of world literature. The author is the primary Latin American \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner,\" and his most famous novel perfectly embodies the fusion of raw, tiger-like intensity and cool, chess-like structural complexity.\n\nThe novel is *One Hundred Years of Solitude* by Gabriel García Márquez.\n\n<<<One Hundred Years of Solitude>>>"
