    "To find the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) in a Full CI (FCI) calculation, we need to follow a series of steps:\n1.  Determine the total number of electrons in the molecule.\n2.  Determine the total number of basis functions (spatial orbitals) for the given basis set.\n3.  Use the appropriate formula to calculate the number of CSFs for an FCI calculation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Determine the Total Number of Electrons (N)**\n\nThe molecule is $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$. We first identify the constituent atoms and their number of electrons:\n*   Carbon (C): Atomic number 6, so 6 electrons.\n*   Hydrogen (H): Atomic number 1, so 1 electron. There are 3 H atoms in total ($\\mathrm{CH}_2...H$). So, 3 × 1 = 3 electrons.\n*   Silicon (Si): Atomic number 14, so 14 electrons.\n*   Fluorine (F): Atomic number 9, so 9 electrons.\n\nThe total number of electrons (N) is the sum:\nN = 6 (from C) + 3 (from 3H) + 14 (from Si) + 9 (from F) = 32 electrons.\n\n**2. Determine the Total Number of Basis Functions (K)**\n\nThe basis set is 6-31G**. We need to find the number of basis functions contributed by each atom. The `**` notation (also written as (d,p)) indicates that a set of d-type polarization functions is added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and a set of p-type polarization functions is added to hydrogen atoms. We assume standard Cartesian functions (6 d-functions, 3 p-functions).\n\n*   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the 1s orbital with a split-valence basis, resulting in 2 basis functions.\n    *   The second `*` adds one set of p-polarization functions (px, py, pz), which is 3 basis functions.\n    *   Total for one H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    *   Since there are 3 H atoms, they contribute 3 × 5 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **For the Carbon (C) atom (a 2nd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes the core (1s) and valence (2s, 2p) orbitals. This results in 9 basis functions. (1 for 1s core, 2 for split 2s, 2x3=6 for split 2p).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-polarization functions (6 functions).\n    *   Total for C atom = 9 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **For the Fluorine (F) atom (a 2nd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   Same as Carbon, the 6-31G** basis set provides 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **For the Silicon (Si) atom (a 3rd-row heavy atom):**\n    *   The 6-31G part describes core (1s, 2s, 2p) and valence (3s, 3p) orbitals, resulting in 13 basis functions. (5 for core, 2x4 for split valence).\n    *   The first `*` adds one set of d-polarization functions (6 functions).\n    *   Total for Si atom = 13 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\n*   **Total Number of Basis Functions (K):**\n    *   K = (functions from C) + (functions from 3H) + (functions from F) + (functions from Si)\n    *   K = 15 + 15 + 15 + 19 = 64 basis functions.\n\n**3. Calculate the Number of CSFs**\n\nThe molecule has 32 electrons, which is an even number. The FCI calculation for the ground state will correspond to a singlet state (total spin S=0). The number of singlet CSFs for N electrons in K spatial orbitals is given by the formula:\n\n$N_{CSF} (S=0) = \\binom{K}{N/2}^2 - \\binom{K}{N/2 - 1} \\binom{K}{N/2 + 1}$\n\nWe have N = 32 and K = 64.\nTherefore, N/2 = 16.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF} = \\binom{64}{16}^2 - \\binom{64}{15} \\binom{64}{17}$\n\nNow, we calculate the values of the binomial coefficients:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16} = \\frac{64!}{16!(64-16)!} = \\frac{64!}{16!48!} = 2,127,464,833,081,100$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} = \\frac{64!}{15!(64-15)!} = \\frac{64!}{15!49!} = 694,519,945,089,312$\n*   $\\binom{64}{17} = \\frac{64!}{17!(64-17)!} = \\frac{64!}{17!47!} = 6,035,133,333,902,592$\n\nNow, we perform the final calculation:\n*   $\\binom{64}{16}^2 = (2,127,464,833,081,100)^2 = 4,526,085,002,061,264,424,783,210,000$\n*   $\\binom{64}{15} \\times \\binom{64}{17} = (694,519,945,089,312) \\times (6,035,133,333,902,592) = 4,190,809,230,558,451,730,419,332,096$\n\nFinally, we find the difference:\n$N_{CSF} = 4,526,085,002,061,264,424,783,210,000 - 4,190,809,230,558,451,730,419,332,096$\n$N_{CSF} = 335,275,771,502,812,694,363,877,904$\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of CSFs in the full CI calculation is 335,275,771,502,812,694,363,877,904.\n\n<<<335275771502812694363877904>>>"
