    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Historical Context**\nThe question refers to the period of the Lam Sơn Uprising (1418–1427), led by the future Vietnamese emperor Lê Lợi against the rule of the Ming Dynasty in Vietnam (known as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination). Mu Sheng (沐晟) was the Duke of Qianguo and the supreme commander of the Ming military forces in the south, based in Yunnan. He was a key figure throughout the conflict.\n\n**Step 2: Define \"First Major Defeat Experienced by Mu Sheng\"**\nTo answer accurately, we must clarify the key terms:\n*   **\"Major Defeat\":** This implies a battle with significant strategic consequences, not a minor skirmish. It would involve the loss of a substantial number of troops or the failure of a critical military objective.\n*   **\"Experienced by Mu Sheng\":** This suggests a defeat of an army that Mu Sheng was personally commanding on the battlefield, rather than a defeat of a subordinate's army for which he held overall responsibility.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Timeline of the Lam Sơn Uprising and Mu Sheng's Involvement**\n*   **Early Phase (1418-1425):** The Lam Sơn rebels were initially active in their home base of Thanh Hóa. They later expanded south into Nghệ An. During this period, the Ming armies fighting them were typically led by other generals like Li Bin and Chen Zhi. While these forces were ultimately under Mu Sheng's regional authority, he was not their direct field commander. The defeat of Chen Zhi's relief force at Khả Lưu Pass in Nghệ An in 1425 was a major Ming defeat, but not one Mu Sheng personally commanded on the field.\n*   **Middle Phase (1426):** The Ming court sent a massive new army under General Wang Tong to crush the rebellion. Wang Tong suffered a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Tốt Động–Chúc Động (near modern Hanoi). Mu Sheng was not the commander in this battle.\n*   **Final Phase (1427):** This is the most crucial period for the question. The Ming Emperor sent a final, massive two-pronged invasion to save the besieged Ming forces.\n    1.  An army from Guangxi was led by General Liu Sheng.\n    2.  An army from Yunnan was led **personally by General Mu Sheng**.\n\nThis 1427 campaign marks Mu Sheng's most significant role as a direct field commander against Lê Lợi's forces. Therefore, his \"first major defeat\" as a personal commander would have occurred during this campaign.\n\n**Step 4: Pinpoint the Specific Battle and Location**\nWhile Liu Sheng's army advanced from the northeast, Mu Sheng's army advanced from the northwest. The Vietnamese plan was to destroy Liu Sheng's army first and then turn to face Mu Sheng.\n*   Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and annihilated at Chi Lăng Pass in modern **Lạng Sơn Province**.\n*   Meanwhile, Mu Sheng's army advanced along the Gam River. He was met by Vietnamese forces under commanders Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả. They set up defenses and ambushes at key strategic points.\n*   The Vietnamese forces engaged and defeated Mu Sheng's vanguard, halting his army's advance. The key locations of this confrontation were **Lãnh Câu Pass** (ải Lãnh Câu) and **Đan Xá**. When news of Liu Sheng's complete destruction reached Mu Sheng's camp, he was terrified. Facing a determined Vietnamese army in front of him and fearing encirclement, he ordered a hasty and disorganized retreat back to Yunnan, during which his army was attacked and suffered devastating losses.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Modern Vietnamese Province**\nThe location where Mu Sheng's army was stopped, defeated, and began its disastrous retreat—Lãnh Câu Pass and the Đan Xá area on the Gam River—is situated in the present-day **Tuyên Quang Province** in northern Vietnam.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe 1427 defeat in Tuyên Quang Province was the first major defeat suffered by an army personally commanded by Mu Sheng during the Lam Sơn War. It was a decisive event that, combined with Liu Sheng's defeat, led directly to the Ming Empire's withdrawal from Vietnam.\n\n<<<Tuyên Quang Province>>>"
