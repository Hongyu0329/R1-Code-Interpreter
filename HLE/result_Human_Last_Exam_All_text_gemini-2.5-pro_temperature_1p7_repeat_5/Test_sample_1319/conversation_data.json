    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad after Mount Olympus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the constraints and core question.**\nThe question asks for a specific piece of information: the name of the tallest *historical* mountain mentioned in Homer's *Iliad*, with the explicit exclusion of Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 2: List the historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*.**\nWe need to comb through the epic to find references to real, physical mountains. The key mountains that appear in the text are:\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is the tallest mountain in Greece (2,918 m / 9,573 ft) and is mentioned frequently, but the question requires us to exclude it.\n*   **Mount Ida:** Located near Troy (modern-day Turkey), this mountain is a primary setting in the *Iliad*. Zeus sits on its peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Athos:** In Book 14, Hera's journey takes her from Olympus over the sea to the peak of Mount Athos, and then to Lemnos.\n*   **The Mountain on Samothrace:** In Book 13, Poseidon sits on the highest peak of \"wooded Samothrace\" to view the battlefield, from which he can see both Mount Ida and Troy. This mountain is now known as Fengari.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** Located in Thessaly, Greece. It is mentioned as the source of the ash wood used for Achilles' powerful spear.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Located in Lydia (modern-day Turkey). It is mentioned in Book 2, the Catalogue of Ships, as a snowy mountain range under which the Maeonians lived.\n\n**Step 3: Gather the elevations for each identified mountain.**\nTo determine the tallest, we need their modern elevations above sea level.\n\n*   **Mount Tmolus (modern name: Bozdağ):** 2,159 meters (7,083 feet).\n*   **Mount Athos:** 2,033 meters (6,670 feet).\n*   **Mount Ida (modern name: Kaz Dağı):** 1,774 meters (5,820 feet).\n*   **Mount Pelion (highest peak: Pourianos Stavros):** 1,624 meters (5,328 feet).\n*   **The Mountain on Samothrace (modern name: Fengari):** 1,611 meters (5,285 feet).\n\n**Step 4: Compare the elevations to find the tallest.**\nNow we can rank the mountains from tallest to shortest:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **The Mountain on Samothrace (Fengari):** 1,611 m\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing between Mythology and Geography:** All the mountains listed are real, physical locations that can be visited today, satisfying the \"historical mountain\" criterion.\n*   **Prominence vs. Height:** Mount Ida is far more central to the *Iliad's* plot than Mount Tmolus. However, the question specifically asks for the \"tallest,\" not the \"most important.\"\n*   **Exact Wording:** The question excludes only \"Mount Olympus.\" We must carefully check that all other mountains mentioned in the text are included in our analysis.\n*   **Source Text Confirmation:** It is crucial to confirm that each mountain is indeed mentioned *within the Iliad* itself, and not just in broader Greek mythology.\n    *   Mount Tmolus: *Iliad*, Book 2, line 866.\n    *   Mount Athos: *Iliad*, Book 14, line 229.\n    *   Mount Ida: Mentioned over 20 times.\n    *   Samothrace: *Iliad*, Book 13, line 12.\n    *   Mount Pelion: *Iliad*, Book 16, line 143.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter excluding Mount Olympus, a comparison of the elevations of the other historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad* shows that Mount Tmolus is the tallest.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
