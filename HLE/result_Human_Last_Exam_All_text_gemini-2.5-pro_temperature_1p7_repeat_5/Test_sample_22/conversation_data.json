    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Key Concepts\n\n*   **Polygenic Score (PGS):** A polygenic score is a tool used to predict an individual's phenotype (a trait like height, or risk for a disease like diabetes) based on their genetic makeup. It is calculated by adding up the effects of many genetic variants (SNPs) across the genome. The effect of each variant (its \"weight\" in the score) is estimated from a large-scale genetic study called a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).\n*   **Predictive Ability of a PGS (Variance Explained, R²):** This measures how well the PGS can predict the actual variation of a trait in a population. It is typically quantified by R-squared (R²), which represents the proportion of the total phenotypic variance that is explained by the PGS. This is usually measured in a testing dataset that is independent of the GWAS dataset used to create the PGS.\n*   **SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):** This is a theoretical concept. It represents the proportion of phenotypic variance that is explained by the additive effects of *all* common SNPs considered together. It is the *maximum possible* predictive power you could ever achieve with a linear model using these SNPs. It assumes you know the *true* effect size of every single SNP, not the *estimated* effect size from a GWAS. Methods like GCTA or LDSC are used to estimate this value from data.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Relationship Between the Concepts\n\n1.  **h²_SNP is the Theoretical Ceiling:** Think of SNP heritability as the total amount of signal available in the SNPs for prediction. It's the absolute best-case scenario, the theoretical upper limit or ceiling. This ceiling assumes perfect information—knowing the true, precise effect of every SNP on the trait.\n\n2.  **PGS is a Practical Attempt to Reach the Ceiling:** A polygenic score is our practical attempt to capture that signal and build a predictive model. To do this, we use effect sizes *estimated* from a GWAS.\n\n3.  **Why the Practical Attempt Falls Short:** The estimation process is imperfect for several reasons:\n    *   **Finite Sample Size:** GWAS are performed on a finite number of people. This means the estimated effect sizes will have statistical \"noise\" or error. They are not the true effect sizes.\n    *   **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD):** GWAS identifies SNPs associated with a trait, but these are often not the true causal variants. Instead, they are just physically nearby on the chromosome and inherited together with the true causal variant. This imperfect \"tagging\" of the causal effect reduces accuracy.\n    *   **Methodological Limitations:** The statistical methods used to combine the estimated effects into a single score have their own assumptions and limitations.\n    *   **Population Differences:** If the PGS is built using a GWAS from one population (e.g., European ancestry) and tested in another, its accuracy will usually drop due to differences in genetic architecture.\n\nBecause the PGS is built with imperfect, estimated weights, its ability to explain variance (`R²_PGS`) will inevitably be less than the theoretical maximum variance that could be explained if we knew the true weights (`h²_SNP`).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the \"Necessarily Lower\" Clause\n\nThe term \"necessarily\" implies that this relationship must always hold.\n*   In any real-world scenario, where a PGS is built from a GWAS with a finite sample size and tested on a finite sample, the `R²_PGS` will be lower than the true `h²_SNP`.\n*   Could `R²_PGS` be equal to `h²_SNP`? Only in a hypothetical, impossible scenario where the discovery GWAS had an infinite sample size, allowing for perfect estimation of all true effect sizes without any error. Since this is not possible, for all practical purposes, the predictive ability of the PGS is lower.\n*   Could `R²_PGS` be higher than `h²_SNP`? This should not happen if the analysis is done correctly. If a PGS is evaluated on the same data it was trained on, its performance can be artificially inflated by overfitting, but this is poor scientific practice. When evaluated correctly in an independent sample, a model cannot explain more variance than is theoretically present in the predictors it uses.\n\nTherefore, the statement that the predictive ability of a PGS is *necessarily* lower than SNP heritability is fundamentally correct. The former is a practical, imperfect measure, while the latter is the theoretical, perfect ceiling.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe statement accurately describes the relationship between the practical application of a predictive model (the PGS) and its theoretical limit (SNP heritability). The imperfections inherent in estimating the model's parameters from real-world data ensure that its performance will be lower than the theoretical maximum.\n\n<<<True"
