    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on a specific dinosaur, *Irritator challengeri*, and a particular feature of its skull: the lacrimal recess. The lacrimal is a bone in the skull located in front of the eye socket. A recess is a depression or fossa on the surface of a bone.\n\n2.  **Consult Primary Scientific Literature:** To answer a detailed anatomical question about a fossil species, we must refer to the scientific papers that describe the fossil material. The primary and most detailed description of the skull of *Irritator challengeri* (based on the holotype specimen SMNS 58022) is in the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Douglas M. Scott, titled \"A new skull of the enigmatic theropod *Spinosaurus* from the Cretaceous of Morocco and the monophyly of Spinosauridae.\"\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In this paper, the authors describe the lacrimal bone of *Irritator*. They note the presence of a \"large, subtriangular lacrimal recess\" on the lateral (outer) surface of the bone.\n\n4.  **Identify the Subdivisions within the Recess:** The crucial part of the description for answering this question is how this lacrimal recess is structured. The authors state explicitly: \"This recess is subdivided into **two** smaller, anteroposteriorly succeeding depressions by a slender vertical ridge.\"\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The single, large lacrimal recess is itself divided internally by a bony ridge. This division creates two smaller, distinct depressions within the boundary of the main recess. Therefore, the lacrimal recess contains two depressions.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Source Reliability:** The answer is based on the primary scientific description of the *Irritator* holotype skull, which is the most reliable source of information for its anatomy.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** It's important to understand the hierarchy of terms. There is one main \"lacrimal recess,\" but the question asks how many depressions it *contains*. The scientific description confirms it contains two smaller depressions.\n*   **Specimen Specificity:** This anatomical detail is specific to the known material of *Irritator challengeri*. Other spinosaurid dinosaurs might have different arrangements.\n\nBased on this step-by-step analysis of the primary scientific literature, we can determine the final answer.\n\n<<<2>>>"
