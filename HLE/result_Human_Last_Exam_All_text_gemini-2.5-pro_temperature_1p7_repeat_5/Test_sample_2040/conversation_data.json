    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion (SPDC):** This is a nonlinear optical quantum process where one high-energy photon (the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (conventionally called the \"signal\" and \"idler\").\n    *   **Requirement for SPDC:** The primary requirement for SPDC to occur in the bulk of a material is that the material must have a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$ (chi-two). This property quantifies the material's ability to produce a second-order response (like frequency doubling or downconversion) to an incident electric field from light.\n    *   **Free-standing Boron Nanosheets:** These are single-atom-thick layers of boron, also known as borophene. The term \"free-standing\" implies the nanosheet is isolated and not influenced by a substrate. Borophene can exist in various structural forms called polymorphs.\n\n2.  **Relate Material Property to Crystal Symmetry:**\n    *   There is a fundamental rule in physics and materials science that connects a material's crystal symmetry to its optical properties.\n    *   For the second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) to be non-zero, the material's crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion** (it must be non-centrosymmetric).\n    *   In a material with an inversion center (a centrosymmetric material), applying an electric field `E` results in the same physical polarization as applying the inverted field `-E`. This symmetry forces all elements of the $\\chi^{(2)}$ tensor to be zero, thus forbidding second-order nonlinear processes like SPDC.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure and Symmetry of Boron Nanosheets:**\n    *   Unlike graphene, which has a single stable honeycomb structure, borophene has multiple stable or metastable polymorphs.\n    *   The most stable and commonly synthesized phases of borophene (e.g., those first grown on silver substrates) are the $\\beta_{12}$ and $\\chi_{3}$ phases.\n    *   The crystal structure of the $\\beta_{12}$ phase belongs to the space group *Pmmn*. The crystal structure of the $\\chi_{3}$ phase belongs to the space group *Cmcm*.\n    *   Both of these space groups, *Pmmn* and *Cmcm*, describe crystal lattices that **possess a center of inversion**. They are centrosymmetric.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and Draw a Conclusion:**\n    *   Since SPDC requires a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n    *   A non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$ requires a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure.\n    *   The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n    *   Therefore, the bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ of an ideal, defect-free boron nanosheet is expected to be zero.\n    *   Conclusion: An ideal, free-standing boron nanosheet is **not** expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Ideal vs. Real-World Material:** The analysis above applies to an ideal, perfect crystal structure. In reality, any factor that breaks the perfect inversion symmetry could potentially enable a weak SPDC signal.\n2.  **Symmetry-Breaking Factors:** These factors include edges of the nanosheet, grain boundaries, structural defects (e.g., vacancies), non-uniform strain, or the application of a strong external electric field. These break the *local* symmetry, but they do not represent the *intrinsic* bulk property of the material.\n3.  **Role of the \"Free-standing\" Condition:** This condition in the question is important. If the nanosheet were on a substrate, the interaction between the sheet and the substrate would break the out-of-plane inversion symmetry, potentially inducing a $\\chi^{(2)}$ and allowing for SPDC. The \"free-standing\" specification directs the analysis to the intrinsic properties of the borophene layer itself.\n4.  **Comparison to Graphene:** A similar analysis applies to graphene, which is also centrosymmetric. Ideal, free-standing graphene does not exhibit SPDC. Observed second-order effects in graphene are attributed to the symmetry-breaking factors listed above.\n5.  **\"Expected to Exhibit\":** This phrasing guides the answer towards the fundamental behavior based on the material's most stable form and intrinsic properties, rather than special cases or engineered conditions. The fundamental expectation based on symmetry is \"no\".\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the critical point is the inversion symmetry of the material. The most stable phases of borophene are centrosymmetric. This symmetry forbids second-order nonlinear optical processes by making the second-order susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$) equal to zero. As SPDC is a second-order process dependent on a non-zero $\\chi^{(2)}$, ideal free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit it.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The reason is that this process requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$), which is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and common phases of boron nanosheets possess crystal structures that are centrosymmetric, which forces their bulk $\\chi^{(2)}$ to be zero, thus forbidding this effect.>>>"
