No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. The reason is that this process requires the material to have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$), which is only possible in materials that lack a center of inversion (i.e., are non-centrosymmetric). The most stable and common phases of boron nanosheets possess crystal structures that are centrosymmetric, which forces their bulk $\chi^{(2)}$ to be zero, thus forbidding this effect.
