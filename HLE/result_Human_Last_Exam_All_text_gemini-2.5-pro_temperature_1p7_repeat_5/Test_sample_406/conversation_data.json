    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the conditions required for the existence of an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem and Definitions**\n\nFirst, we must clearly define the terms used in the question.\n\n*   **Spaces:** We are given three sets, `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. For fixed-point theorems, we typically assume these are metric spaces.\n*   **Functions:** We are given three functions with specific domains and codomains:\n    *   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n    *   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n    *   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n    *   **Careful Point:** The original question listed `G` twice. It is a standard assumption in such problems that this is a typo and the third function should be `H`, as `FGH-tripled fixed point` implies three distinct functions F, G, and H.\n*   **FGH-tripled fixed point:** This concept is a generalization of a standard fixed point. A point `(x, y, z)` is a fixed point of this system if applying the functions according to their structure returns the original components of the point. Given the function definitions, an FGH-tripled fixed point is a triplet `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that simultaneously satisfies the following system of equations:\n    1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n    2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n    3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**2. Formulating an Equivalent Problem**\n\nThe question asks for conditions that guarantee the existence of such a point `(x, y, z)`. The most powerful tool for this is the **Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**, which guarantees the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point for a contraction mapping on a complete metric space.\n\nTo use this theorem, we can reformulate the problem:\n*   Combine the three spaces `X`, `Y`, and `Z` into a single product space, `M = X × Y × Z`.\n*   Combine the three functions `F`, `G`, and `H` into a single operator `T: M → M`.\n\nThis operator `T` is defined as:\n`T(x, y, z) = ( F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x) )`\n\nA fixed point of `T` is a point `p = (x, y, z)` such that `T(p) = p`. This is exactly equivalent to the system of equations for the FGH-tripled fixed point. Therefore, finding conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point is equivalent to finding conditions for the operator `T` to have a fixed point.\n\n**3. Applying the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem**\n\nThe Banach Fixed-Point Theorem requires two main conditions:\n1.  The space `M` must be a **complete metric space**.\n2.  The operator `T: M → M` must be a **contraction mapping**.\n\nLet's translate these into conditions on `X`, `Y`, `Z`, `F`, `G`, and `H`.\n\n*   **Condition on the Spaces (Completeness):**\n    For `M = X × Y × Z` to be a complete metric space, we first need to define a metric `d` on it. A common choice is the sum metric, assuming `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are metric spaces:\n    `d((x₁, y₁, z₁), (x₂, y₂, z₂)) = d_X(x₁, x₂) + d_Y(y₁, y₂) + d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    If `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` are complete metric spaces, then the product space `(M, d)` is also a complete metric space.\n    *   **First Condition:** `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces**.\n\n*   **Condition on the Functions (Contraction):**\n    For `T` to be a contraction mapping, there must exist a constant `k ∈ [0, 1)` such that for any two points `p₁ = (x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `p₂ = (x₂, y₂, z₂)` in `M`, the following inequality holds:\n    `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * d(p₁, p₂)`\n\n    To establish this, we need to impose Lipschitz-type conditions on the individual functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. Let's assume there exist non-negative constants (Lipschitz constants) such that for all `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)`:\n    1.  `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α * d_X(x₁, x₂) + β * d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ * d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    2.  `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ ε * d_X(x₁, x₂) + δ * d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    3.  `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ι * d_X(x₁, x₂) + θ * d_Y(y₁, y₂) + η * d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n    Now, let's analyze `d(T(p₁), T(p₂))`:\n    `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) = d_X(F(p₁), F(p₂)) + d_Y(G(p₁), G(p₂)) + d_Z(H(p₁), H(p₂))`\n\n    Substituting the inequalities above:\n    `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ [α d_X + β d_Y + γ d_Z] + [ε d_X + δ d_Y] + [ι d_X + θ d_Y + η d_Z]`\n\n    Grouping the terms by metric:\n    `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ (α + ε + ι) d_X(x₁, x₂) + (β + δ + θ) d_Y(y₁, y₂) + (γ + η) d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n    To satisfy the contraction condition `d(T(p₁), T(p₂)) ≤ k * (d_X + d_Y + d_Z)` for some `k < 1`, we can set `k = max(α + ε + ι,  β + δ + θ,  γ + η)`. If this maximum value `k` is less than 1, then `T` is a contraction mapping.\n\n    *   **Second Condition:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must be contractive in a way that their combined effect on the product space is a contraction. A sufficient set of conditions on their Lipschitz constants is:\n        *   `α + ε + ι < 1`\n        *   `β + δ + θ < 1`\n        *   `γ + η < 1`\n\nIf these conditions are met, the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem guarantees that the operator `T` has a unique fixed point, which means there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`.\n\n### Summary of Conditions\n\nThe existence (and uniqueness) of an FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed under the following conditions, derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem:\n\n1.  **Space Requirement:** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be **non-empty complete metric spaces** with metrics `d_X`, `d_Y`, and `d_Z`, respectively.\n\n2.  **Mapping Requirement:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a **contraction condition**. This can be specified by assuming they obey the following Lipschitz-type inequalities with non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, ι`:\n    *   `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α d_X(x₁, x₂) + β d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    *   `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ ε d_X(x₁, x₂) + δ d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    *   `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ι d_X(x₁, x₂) + θ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + η d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n\n    And these constants must satisfy the inequalities:\n    *   `α + ε + ι < 1`\n    *   `β + δ + θ < 1`\n    *   `γ + η < 1`\n\n<<<The conditions for the functions `F: X*Y*Z→X`, `G: Y*X*Y→Y`, and `H: Z*Y*X→Z` to have an FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)` are, fundamentally, the conditions required by the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem applied to an operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))` on the product space `M = X×Y×Z`. These conditions are:\n1.  **Completeness of Spaces:** `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` must be non-empty complete metric spaces.\n2.  **Contraction Mapping:** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must satisfy a combined contraction property. A sufficient condition is that they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to their arguments, and the sum of their corresponding Lipschitz constants is less than 1. More formally, if there exist non-negative constants `α, β, γ, δ, ε, η, θ, ι` such that for any two points `(x₁, y₁, z₁)` and `(x₂, y₂, z₂)`:\n    - `d_X(F(x₁, y₁, z₁), F(x₂, y₂, z₂)) ≤ α d_X(x₁, x₂) + β d_Y(y₁, y₂) + γ d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\n    - `d_Y(G(y₁, x₁, y₁), G(y₂, x₂, y₂)) ≤ ε d_X(x₁, x₂) + δ d_Y(y₁, y₂)`\n    - `d_Z(H(z₁, y₁, x₁), H(z₂, y₂, x₂)) ≤ ι d_X(x₁, x₂) + θ d_Y(y₁, y₂) + η d_Z(z₁, z₂)`\nThen the sums of these constants, grouped by their corresponding metric component, must all be less than 1:\n    - `α + ε + ι < 1`\n    - `β + δ + θ < 1`\n    - `γ + η < 1`>>>"
