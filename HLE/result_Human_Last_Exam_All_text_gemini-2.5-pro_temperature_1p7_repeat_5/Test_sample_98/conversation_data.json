    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup and the question\nThe problem asks for the shape of the water surface in an icosahedron-shaped tank that is standing on one of its triangular faces and is filled to half of its total volume.\n\n*   **The Object:** An icosahedron is a regular polyhedron with 20 identical equilateral triangular faces, 30 identical edges, and 12 identical vertices.\n*   **The Orientation:** The tank is \"standing on one of its faces\". This means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base. Due to the symmetry of the icosahedron, there must be another face parallel to the base at the top.\n*   **The Condition:** The tank is \"half-filled with water\". This means the volume of the water is exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron.\n*   **The Goal:** Determine the geometric shape of the water's surface. Since the tank is standing on a horizontal base, the water surface will be a horizontal plane. We need to find the shape of the cross-section created by this horizontal plane.\n\n### Step 2: Relate \"Half-Full\" to the Geometry of the Icosahedron\nTo find the location of the water surface, we need to identify the horizontal plane that divides the icosahedron's volume into two equal halves. This can be done by analyzing the symmetries of the icosahedron.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Center of Symmetry.** A regular icosahedron is a highly symmetric object. Critically, it possesses a center of symmetry (or point symmetry). This means for any point within the icosahedron, there is a corresponding point on the opposite side of the center, at the same distance. A key property of any object with a center of symmetry is that **any plane passing through this center divides the object's volume into two equal halves.**\n*   **Careful Point 2: Locating the Center of Symmetry.** When the icosahedron is resting on a horizontal face (the base), it has a parallel face at the top. The center of symmetry lies exactly on the horizontal plane that is halfway between the base and the top face. This plane is also a plane of reflection symmetry for the icosahedron in this orientation.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since the tank is half-full, the water surface must be the horizontal plane that passes through the icosahedron's center of symmetry. This plane is the \"midplane\" located exactly at half the total height of the tank.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Shape of the Midplane Cross-Section\nNow we need to determine the shape of the polygon formed by the intersection of this horizontal midplane with the faces of the icosahedron. We can do this by again considering the symmetries of the setup.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Rotational Symmetry.** When resting on a face, the icosahedron has a vertical axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. This axis passes through the centers of the bottom and top triangular faces. Since the midplane (the water surface) is perpendicular to this axis of symmetry, the resulting cross-sectional shape must also have 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Central Symmetry.** As established in Step 2, the midplane passes through the center of symmetry of the icosahedron. This means the resulting 2D shape of the cross-section must also be centrally symmetric.\n\n### Step 4: Synthesize the Symmetries to Find the Final Shape\nThe shape of the water surface is a polygon that must satisfy two conditions simultaneously:\n1.  It has 3-fold rotational symmetry.\n2.  It has central (point) symmetry.\n\nLet's analyze what this means for a polygon.\n*   Let the polygon have a vertex V. Because of 3-fold rotational symmetry, rotating V by 120° and 240° around the center must also yield vertices. This gives us a set of 3 vertices forming an equilateral triangle.\n*   Because of central symmetry, for each vertex (like V), its opposite point (-V) must also be a vertex. This means the vertices come in pairs, so the polygon must have an even number of sides.\n*   Combining these facts: if we start with one vertex V, we get two more from 3-fold rotation. We then get the three opposite vertices from central symmetry. This gives a total of 6 vertices. These 6 vertices, when arranged in order around the center, are separated by angles of 60 degrees and are all at the same distance from the center.\n*   A six-sided polygon whose vertices are equally spaced on a circle is a **regular hexagon**.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe water surface corresponds to the horizontal midplane that bisects the icosahedron's volume. The symmetries of the icosahedron dictate that this cross-section must be a polygon with both 3-fold and central symmetry. The only polygon that satisfies these conditions is a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
