    "This problem asks us to solve an initial value problem and then evaluate the solution at a specific point.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Differential Equation**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = (t-1) \\cdot x^2(t) $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2 $$\nWe can see that the equation is a first-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equation. The right-hand side can be factored into a function of $t$ and a function of $x$, which means it is a separable equation.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Check for constant solutions.**\nBefore separating variables, we should check for any constant solutions $x(t) = c$. If $x(t)=c$, then $x'(t)=0$. Substituting this into the equation gives $0 = (t-1)c^2$. This must hold for all $t$ in the domain of the solution, which implies $c^2=0$, so $c=0$. Thus, $x(t)=0$ is a constant solution. However, the initial condition is $x(0)=-8 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the solution we are looking for is not the constant solution $x(t)=0$, and we can safely divide by $x^2(t)$ assuming $x(t)$ does not cross zero.\n\n**Step 2: Separate the variables**\nWe rearrange the terms to group $x$ and $dx$ on one side and $t$ and $dt$ on the other side.\n$$ \\frac{dx}{x^2} = (t-1) dt $$\n\n**Step 3: Integrate both sides**\nNow, we integrate both sides of the separated equation:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int (t-1) dt $$\nLet's compute each integral:\n-   The left side integral:\n    $$ \\int \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\int x^{-2} dx = \\frac{x^{-1}}{-1} = -\\frac{1}{x} $$\n-   The right side integral:\n    $$ \\int (t-1) dt = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t $$\nCombining the results and adding a constant of integration $C$:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C $$\n\n**Step 4: Apply the initial condition to find the constant C**\nThe initial condition is $x(0) = -8$. We substitute $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the equation from Step 3.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Be cautious with signs.**\n$$ -\\frac{1}{(-8)} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{8} = 0 - 0 + C $$\n$$ C = \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Step 5: Write down the particular solution**\nNow we substitute the value of $C$ back into our general solution to get the particular solution for this initial value problem:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate x(1)**\nThe problem asks for the value of $x(1)$. We substitute $t=1$ into the particular solution.\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n\n**Careful Point 3: Perform the fraction arithmetic correctly.**\nLet's find a common denominator (which is 8) to simplify the right-hand side:\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4}{8} - \\frac{8}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{4 - 8 + 1}{8} $$\n$$ -\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{-3}{8} $$\nMultiplying both sides by -1 gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nFinally, to solve for $x(1)$, we take the reciprocal of both sides:\n$$ x(1) = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n\n<<<8/3>>>"
