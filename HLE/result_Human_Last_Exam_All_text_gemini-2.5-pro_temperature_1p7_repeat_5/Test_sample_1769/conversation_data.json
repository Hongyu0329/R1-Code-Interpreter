    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) Word:**\n    Before the Vikings arrived, the Anglo-Saxons had their own native word for \"sister\". This word was **`sweostor`**. It derives from Proto-Germanic `*swestēr`, which is also the ancestor of the German `Schwester` and Dutch `zuster`.\n\n2.  **Identify the Old Norse Word and its Influence:**\n    The Old Norse word for sister was **`systir`**. This word is a cognate of `sweostor`, meaning they both evolved from the same ancient root word. They are relatives, not strangers. When Norse speakers settled in England, their word `systir` coexisted with the Old English `sweostor`. Due to the similarity and the phonetic simplicity of the Norse form (lacking the `w` sound and having a simpler vowel), it began to influence the English word, especially in the north of England (the Danelaw). The modern English word `sister` is a result of this blending. Its vowel sound is closer to the Norse `y` and it lacks the `w` from the original `sweo-` cluster.\n\n3.  **Project the \"Native\" Development without Norse Influence:**\n    To figure out what `sweostor` would have become on its own, we need to look at how it evolved in areas with *less* Viking influence, particularly the south of England.\n    *   In these regions, Old English `sweostor` underwent natural sound changes. The initial `sweo-` cluster simplified, and the word became **`suster`** in Middle English. This was the common southern form of the word.\n    *   This path (`sweostor` > `suster`) is a well-documented native development.\n\n4.  **Trace the \"Native\" Form to Modern English:**\n    Now we must apply the subsequent sound changes that occurred between Middle English and Modern English to the form `suster`.\n    *   The Middle English word `suster` was pronounced roughly as \"SOOS-ter\", with the \"oo\" sound being the short /ʊ/ vowel, as in the modern words \"p**u**t\" or \"f**oo**t\".\n    *   The most relevant sound change is the 16th-17th century unrounding of this /ʊ/ vowel to /ʌ/ (the \"uh\" sound in \"c**u**p\" or \"b**u**tt\"). This sound change affected a large number of words.\n    *   We can see this exact change in other words that had the same vowel in Middle English:\n        *   `sone` (pronounced /sʊnə/) became `son` (/sʌn/).\n        *   `come` (pronounced /kʊmə/) became `come` (/kʌm/).\n        *   `love` (pronounced /lʊvə/) became `love` (/lʌv/).\n    *   Following this rule, the Middle English `suster` (pronounced /ˈsʊstər/) would have evolved into a Modern English word pronounced **/ˈsʌstər/**.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Spelling:**\n    The spelling would most likely have remained **`suster`**, mirroring the development of words like `sun` or `run`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Cognates vs. Borrowing:** This is not a simple case of a foreign word replacing a native one. It's a case of two closely related words (cognates) interacting, with one influencing the other's pronunciation and form.\n*   **Dialectal Variation:** The form `sister` started as a northern dialectal variant heavily influenced by Norse. It was the southern form, `suster`, that represented the more direct continuation of Old English. Over centuries, the northern form became the standard across all of England.\n*   **Phonetic Evolution:** The projection relies on applying known, regular sound changes (like the /ʊ/ to /ʌ/ shift) to the attested Middle English form that was least affected by Norse.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf the Norse had never invaded, the southern Middle English form `suster` would likely have become the standard English word. Following its natural phonetic evolution into Modern English, the word would be spelled `suster` and pronounced with the same vowel sound as \"cup\".\n\n<<<suster>>>"
