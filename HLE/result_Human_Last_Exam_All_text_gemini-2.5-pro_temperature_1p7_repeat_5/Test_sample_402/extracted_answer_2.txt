A filtering strategy that removes genes from the differential expression list if they meet two simultaneous conditions: 1) A large negative log fold change (e.g., log2FC < -2) in the CAR-T-IL15 vs. CAR-T comparison, AND 2) A very low or near-zero absolute expression level in the cleaner CAR-T-IL15 samples (e.g., mean normalized count < 1). This dual-condition approach specifically targets genes present in the contaminating cancer cells but absent from T cells, thereby cleaning the data without removing genuine biological signals. This can be implemented on the command line using tools like `awk` to process the differential expression results file.
