    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the value of a(4), the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Boolean Function:** A function `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` that maps inputs from `{0, 1}^n` to `{0, 1}`.\n*   **Implicant:** A product term (like `x1*x2'`) that \"implies\" the function. This means that whenever the product term is 1, the function's output must also be 1.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that is \"minimal\". If you remove any variable (literal) from the product term, it is no longer an implicant of the function. For example, `x1` might be an implicant, but if `x1*x2` is also an implicant, then `x1` is not prime (because `x1*x2` is a more specific term contained within it). The goal is to find the largest possible groupings of 1s in a Karnaugh map.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We are looking for a(4).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze simple cases and candidate functions**\n\nTo find the maximum, we need to find a specific function that generates the highest number of PIs. Let's test some well-known classes of functions.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: The Checkerboard Function**\n    This function is 1 for all minterms where the number of variables set to 1 (Hamming weight) is even, and 0 otherwise (or vice-versa).\n    *   For `n` variables, a minterm is adjacent to another if they differ by one bit. This means their Hamming weights differ by 1 (one is even, one is odd).\n    *   In the checkerboard function, no two minterms that are \"on\" (value 1) are adjacent.\n    *   This means no grouping is possible. Every single minterm in the function's ON-set is a prime implicant.\n    *   The number of minterms with even weight is `2^(n-1)`.\n    *   For `n=4`, this function has `2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8` prime implicants. So, `a(4) >= 8`.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: The Middle-Level Function**\n    This function is 1 only for minterms with a specific Hamming weight `k`. To maximize the number of such minterms, `k` is chosen to be `floor(n/2)`.\n    *   The function is `S(n, k)`, where `k = floor(n/2)`.\n    *   Similar to the checkerboard case, any two minterms in this function's ON-set have the same weight `k`. They cannot be adjacent (as that requires weights to differ by 1). Thus, you cannot form a larger implicant by grouping minterms from the ON-set. Every minterm in `S(n,k)` is a prime implicant.\n    *   The number of prime implicants is `C(n, k)`.\n    *   For `n=4`, `k = floor(4/2) = 2`. The number of PIs is `C(4, 2) = (4 * 3) / 2 = 6`.\n    *   Since `8 > 6`, the checkerboard function is a better candidate so far.\n\n**Step 3: Constructing a better function**\n\nNeither of the above candidates gives the correct maximum value. We need a more complex construction. Let's consider the function `F` which is ON (evaluates to 1) for all possible inputs EXCEPT the all-0s input and the all-1s input.\n\n*   **Function Definition (for n=4):** `F(w,x,y,z) = 1` for all 16 inputs except `w'x'y'z'` (0000) and `wxyz` (1111).\n    This function is ON for all minterms of weight 1, 2, and 3.\n    In logic, `F = (w'x'y'z' + wxyz)'`.\n\n**Step 4: Find the prime implicants of this new function `F`**\n\nLet's test if a product term like `w*x'` is a prime implicant.\n\n1.  **Is `w*x'` an implicant?**\n    The term `w*x'` is 1 when `w=1` and `x=0`. The inputs look like `(1, 0, y, z)`. The number of 1s in such an input is `1 + (number of 1s in y,z)`. This can be 1, 2, or 3. The weights of the minterms covered by `w*x'` are 1, 2, and 3. Our function `F` is 1 for all these weights. Therefore, `w*x'` is an implicant of `F`.\n\n2.  **Is `w*x'` prime?**\n    To be prime, it cannot be simplified. Let's try to remove a literal.\n    *   Simplify to `w`: The term `w` is 1 for all inputs where `w=1`. This includes the input `wxyz` (1111). At this input, `F` is 0. So, `w` is NOT an implicant.\n    *   Simplify to `x'`: The term `x'` is 1 for all inputs where `x=0`. This includes the input `w'x'y'z'` (0000). At this input, `F` is 0. So, `x'` is NOT an implicant.\n    Since neither simplification results in a valid implicant, the term `w*x'` is a prime implicant.\n\n**Step 5: Count the prime implicants of this form**\n\nThe prime implicants are all product terms formed by one uncomplemented variable and one complemented variable (`x_i * x_j'`).\n\n*   First, we choose 2 distinct variables out of 4. This can be done in `C(4, 2) = 6` ways. The pairs are `{w,x}, {w,y}, {w,z}, {x,y}, {x,z}, {y,z}`.\n*   For each pair, say `{w,x}`, we can form two prime implicants: `w*x'` and `w'*x`.\n*   Total number of prime implicants = `C(4, 2) * 2 = 6 * 2 = 12`.\n\nThe 12 prime implicants are:\n`wx', w'x, wy', w'y, wz', w'z, xy', x'y, xz', x'z, yz', y'z`\n\nThis set of 12 PIs completely describes the function `F`. Since known theoretical upper bounds (e.g., from Chandra and Markowsky) state that `a(4) <= 12`, our construction achieves the maximum possible value.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4), is 12. This is achieved by the function that is true for all input combinations except all-zeros and all-ones.\n\n<<<12>>>"
