    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the connectivity of the map `φ: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Spaces Involved\n\nLet `A = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)` be the source space and `B = Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)` be the target space. We need to determine the connectivity of these spaces. The connectivity of a space `X`, denoted `conn(X)`, is the largest integer `k` such that `π_i(X) = 0` for all `i ≤ k`.\n\n**Source Space `A = Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)`:**\n\n1.  **Loop Spaces:** The connectivity of a loop space `ΩSⁿ` is related to the connectivity of the sphere `Sⁿ`. The sphere `Sⁿ` is `(n-1)`-connected. The loop space operation `Ω` reduces connectivity by 1.\n    *   `conn(S⁴) = 3`, so `conn(ΩS⁴) = 3 - 1 = 2`.\n    *   `conn(S⁶) = 5`, so `conn(ΩS⁶) = 5 - 1 = 4`.\n\n2.  **Smash Product:** For well-behaved spaces (like CW complexes, which `ΩSⁿ` are), the connectivity of a smash product `X ∧ Y` follows the formula: `conn(X ∧ Y) = conn(X) + conn(Y) + 2`.\n    *   `conn(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) = conn(ΩS⁴) + conn(ΩS⁶) + 2 = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8`.\n    So, `π_i(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n\n3.  **Suspension:** The reduced suspension operation `Σ` increases connectivity by 1: `conn(ΣX) = conn(X) + 1`.\n    *   `conn(A) = conn(Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶)) = conn(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9`.\n    *   Therefore, the source space `A` is 9-connected. `π_i(A) = 0` for `i ≤ 9`.\n\n**Target Space `B = Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`:**\n\n1.  **Smash Product of Spheres:** The smash product of two spheres is another sphere: `S^p ∧ S^q ≃ S^{p+q}`.\n    *   `S⁴ ∧ S⁶ ≃ S¹⁰`.\n    *   The target space is `B ≃ ΩS¹⁰`.\n\n2.  **Loop Space on a Sphere:** As before, the loop space operation reduces connectivity by 1.\n    *   `conn(S¹⁰) = 9`.\n    *   `conn(B) = conn(ΩS¹⁰) = conn(S¹⁰) - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8`.\n    *   Therefore, the target space `B` is 8-connected. `π_i(B) = 0` for `i ≤ 8`.\n\n3.  **First Non-Trivial Homotopy Group of B:** The first non-trivial homotopy group of `B` is `π_9(B)`.\n    *   `π_9(B) = π_9(ΩS¹⁰) ≅ π_{9+1}(S¹⁰) = π_{10}(S¹⁰)`.\n    *   We know `π_n(Sⁿ) = Z` for `n ≥ 1`, so `π_{10}(S¹⁰) = Z`.\n    *   Thus, `π_9(B) = Z`.\n\n### Step 2: Definition of Connectivity of a Map\n\nA map `φ: A → B` is defined to be **n-connected** if the induced map on homotopy groups, `φ_*: π_k(A) → π_k(B)`, is an isomorphism for `k < n` and a surjection for `k = n`.\n\nAn equivalent definition is that `φ` is n-connected if its homotopy fiber `F` is `(n-1)`-connected (i.e., `π_k(F) = 0` for `k ≤ n-1`).\n\nWe will use the second definition by analyzing the homotopy fiber.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Homotopy Fiber `F`\n\nThe map `φ: A → B` fits into a homotopy fibration sequence `F → A → B`. This gives rise to a long exact sequence (LES) of homotopy groups:\n`... → π_{k+1}(B) → π_k(F) → π_k(A) → π_k(B) → π_{k-1}(F) → ...`\n\nWe use this LES to find the connectivity of `F`.\n\n1.  **For `k ≤ 7`:** Let's find `π_k(F)`. We proceed by induction.\n    *   **Base Case `k=0`**: The spaces `A` and `B` are path-connected, so `π_0(A) = 0` and `π_0(B) = 0`. The LES segment `π_1(B) → π_0(F) → π_0(A)` shows that `π_0(F) = 0`.\n    *   **Inductive Step**: Assume `π_j(F) = 0` for `j < k ≤ 7`. The LES segment is `π_k(A) → π_k(B) → π_{k-1}(F)`. From Step 1, we know `π_k(A)=0` and `π_k(B)=0` for `k ≤ 7`. By the inductive hypothesis, `π_{k-1}(F)=0`. The sequence becomes `... → π_k(F) → 0 → 0 → 0 → ...`. Exactness implies `π_k(F) = 0`.\n    *   By induction, `π_k(F) = 0` for all `k ≤ 7`. Therefore, the fiber `F` is at least 7-connected.\n\n2.  **For `k = 8`:** Let's determine `π_8(F)`. We look at the LES segment involving `π_9(B)` and `π_8(F)`:\n    `... → π_9(A) → π_9(B) → π_8(F) → π_8(A) → ...`\n    We substitute the known homotopy groups:\n    *   `π_9(A) = 0` (since A is 9-connected).\n    *   `π_9(B) = Z` (from Step 1).\n    *   `π_8(A) = 0` (since A is 9-connected).\n    The sequence becomes: `... → 0 → Z → π_8(F) → 0 → ...`\n    For this sequence to be exact, the map `∂: Z → π_8(F)` must be an isomorphism. Therefore, `π_8(F) ≅ Z`.\n    Since `π_8(F)` is not trivial, the fiber `F` is not 8-connected. The connectivity of `F` is exactly 7.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the Connectivity of the Map\n\nThe connectivity of the map `φ` is related to the connectivity of its fiber `F` by the formula `conn(φ) = conn(F) + 1`.\n\nSince we found that `conn(F) = 7`, the connectivity of the map `φ` is:\n`conn(φ) = 7 + 1 = 8`.\n\nTo verify using the first definition:\n*   For `k < 8`, `π_k(A) = 0` and `π_k(B) = 0`. The map `φ_*: 0 → 0` is an isomorphism.\n*   For `k = 8`, `π_8(A) = 0` and `π_8(B) = 0`. The map `φ_*: 0 → 0` is a surjection.\n*   For `k = 9`, `π_9(A) = 0` and `π_9(B) = Z`. The map `φ_*: 0 → Z` is not a surjection.\nTherefore, the map is 8-connected, but not 9-connected. The connectivity is 8. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" serves to guarantee that a canonical, non-trivial map exists, but the calculation of its connectivity does not depend on the specific details of its construction.\n\n<<<8>>>"
