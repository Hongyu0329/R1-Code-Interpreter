    "An analysis of the question is as follows.\n\n**Step-by-step derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**:\n    The Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and the non-zero commutation relations:\n    $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n    $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n    $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\n    All other brackets between basis vectors are zero. Let's compute the lower central series:\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^2 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}] = \\mathrm{span}\\{e_3, e_4, e_6\\}$.\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^3 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^2] = \\mathrm{span}\\{[e_1, e_3], [e_1, e_4], [e_1, e_6]\\} = \\mathrm{span}\\{e_4\\}$.\n    $\\mathfrak{g}^4 = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathfrak{g}^3] = [\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathrm{span}\\{e_4\\}] = \\{0\\}$.\n    Since the lower central series terminates at $\\{0\\}$, the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is nilpotent.\n\n2.  **Compute the Poincaré Polynomial using properties of nilpotent Lie algebras**:\n    For a nilpotent Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ with a central ideal $I$, the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is related to that of the quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}/I$ by the formula:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = P_{I}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{g}/I}(x)$.\n    If $I$ is an abelian ideal of dimension $k$, its Poincaré polynomial is $P_I(x)=(1+x)^k$.\n    So, if $I$ is a central ideal of dimension $k$, we have $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^k P_{\\mathfrak{g}/I}(x)$.\n\n3.  **Find the center of $\\mathfrak{g}$**:\n    The center $Z(\\mathfrak{g})$ consists of elements $X = \\sum_{i=1}^6 c_i e_i$ that commute with all elements of $\\mathfrak{g}$. We check the commutation relations with the basis vectors.\n    $[X, e_1] = -[e_1, X] = -c_2[e_1, e_2] - c_3[e_1, e_3] - c_5[e_1, e_5] = -c_2e_3 - c_3e_4 - c_5e_6$.\n    For $[X, e_1] = 0$, we must have $c_2 = c_3 = c_5 = 0$. So $X$ must be of the form $c_1e_1 + c_4e_4 + c_6e_6$.\n    Now, let's check brackets with other basis vectors:\n    $[X, e_2] = c_1[e_1, e_2] = c_1e_3$. For this to be zero, $c_1=0$.\n    So any central element must be of the form $X = c_4e_4 + c_6e_6$.\n    Let's verify that $e_4$ and $e_6$ are central. The elements $e_4$ and $e_6$ do not appear on the left-hand side of any commutation relation, so $[e_4, e_i] = 0$ and $[e_6, e_i] = 0$ for all $i$.\n    Thus, the center is $Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\mathrm{span}\\{e_4, e_6\\}$, which is a central ideal of dimension 2.\n\n4.  **Analyze the quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}' = \\mathfrak{g}/Z(\\mathfrak{g})$**:\n    Using the formula from step 2, we have:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2 P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x)$.\n    The quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}'$ has dimension $6-2=4$. A basis for $\\mathfrak{g}'$ can be represented by the images of the basis vectors of $\\mathfrak{g}$ that are not in the center, i.e., $\\{f_1, f_2, f_3, f_5\\}$ where $f_i = e_i + Z(\\mathfrak{g})$.\n    The commutation relations in $\\mathfrak{g}'$ are:\n    $[f_1, f_2] = [e_1, e_2] + Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = e_3 + Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = f_3$.\n    $[f_1, f_3] = [e_1, e_3] + Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = e_4 + Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = 0$ in $\\mathfrak{g}'$ (since $e_4 \\in Z(\\mathfrak{g})$).\n    $[f_1, f_5] = [e_1, e_5] + Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = e_6 + Z(\\mathfrak{g}) = 0$ in $\\mathfrak{g}'$ (since $e_6 \\in Z(\\mathfrak{g})$).\n    All other brackets are zero. So $\\mathfrak{g}'$ is a 4-dimensional Lie algebra with the only non-zero bracket being $[f_1, f_2] = f_3$.\n\n5.  **Decompose the quotient algebra $\\mathfrak{g}'$**:\n    Let's identify the structure of $\\mathfrak{g}'$. The subalgebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3 = \\mathrm{span}\\{f_1, f_2, f_3\\}$ with $[f_1, f_2]=f_3$ is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.\n    The element $f_5$ commutes with $f_1, f_2, f_3$ (and itself), so it is in the center of $\\mathfrak{g}'$.\n    This means $\\mathfrak{g}'$ is a direct sum of the Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ and a one-dimensional abelian algebra $\\mathbb{R}f_5$.\n    $\\mathfrak{g}' = \\mathfrak{h}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n6.  **Compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}'$**:\n    The Poincaré polynomial of a direct sum of Lie algebras is the product of their individual Poincaré polynomials:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) = P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)$.\n    - The Poincaré polynomial of the 1-dimensional abelian algebra $\\mathbb{R}$ is $P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = 1+x$.\n    - For the Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_3$, with basis $\\{X, Y, Z\\}$ and relation $[X,Y]=Z$, the Poincaré polynomial is a known result: $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1+2x+2x^2+x^3$.\n\n7.  **Combine all the results**:\n    Substituting the polynomials back, we get:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) = (1+2x+2x^2+x^3)(1+x)$.\n    Now, we find the Poincaré polynomial for the original algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^2 P_{\\mathfrak{g}'}(x) = (1+x)^2 (1+2x+2x^2+x^3)(1+x)$\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+x)^3 (1+2x+2x^2+x^3)$.\n\n8.  **Expand the polynomial**:\n    First, expand $(1+x)^3 = 1+3x+3x^2+x^3$.\n    Then multiply the two polynomials:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1+3x+3x^2+x^3)(1+2x+2x^2+x^3)$\n    $= 1(1+2x+2x^2+x^3) + 3x(1+2x+2x^2+x^3) + 3x^2(1+2x+2x^2+x^3) + x^3(1+2x+2x^2+x^3)$\n    $= (1+2x+2x^2+x^3) + (3x+6x^2+6x^3+3x^4) + (3x^2+6x^3+6x^4+3x^5) + (x^3+2x^4+2x^5+x^6)$\n    Collecting terms by degree:\n    $x^0: 1$\n    $x^1: 2+3 = 5$\n    $x^2: 2+6+3 = 11$\n    $x^3: 1+6+6+1 = 14$\n    $x^4: 3+6+2 = 11$\n    $x^5: 3+2 = 5$\n    $x^6: 1$\n    So, the final Poincaré polynomial is $1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6$.\n    The coefficients are symmetric ($b_k = b_{6-k}$), which is expected for a 6-dimensional unimodular Lie algebra (nilpotent Lie algebras are always unimodular).\n\n**Final Answer Calculation Check:**\n- The decomposition of $\\mathfrak{g}$ relies on it being nilpotent, which it is.\n- The use of the formula for central extensions is correct.\n- The decomposition of the quotient algebra is correct.\n- The polynomials for the components ($\\mathfrak{h}_3, \\mathbb{R}$) are standard.\n- The final expansion is an arithmetic calculation, which has been verified.\n\nThe method is sound and the calculations are verified.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^6 b_k x^k$.\nWe found $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 5x + 11x^2 + 14x^3 + 11x^4 + 5x^5 + x^6$.\n\n<<<1 + 5*x + 11*x^2 + 14*x^3 + 11*x^4 + 5*x^5 + x^6>>>"
