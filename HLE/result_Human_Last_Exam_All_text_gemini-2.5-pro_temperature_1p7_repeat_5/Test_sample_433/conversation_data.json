    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **What:** The question asks for the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n    *   **For What:** A single-dose container that is specifically an **ampule**.\n    *   **When:** From the time it is opened (\"punctured\").\n    *   **Where:** In a **sterile environment**, which implies an ISO Class 5 environment as defined by USP standards.\n\n2.  **Identify the Governing Standard:** The standards for sterile compounding in the United States are set by the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), specifically in **Chapter <797> \"Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations.\"** This chapter provides explicit rules for handling different types of containers.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Rules for Ampules in USP <797>:**\n    *   An ampule is a sealed glass container intended for a single use. To access the medication, the glass neck must be broken.\n    *   Once an ampule is opened, it cannot be resealed. This means its contents are continuously exposed to the surrounding environment, and sterility cannot be maintained or guaranteed after the initial dose is withdrawn.\n    *   Because of this inability to be resealed, USP <797> mandates that any unused portion of medication from an opened ampule must be discarded immediately. It cannot be stored for any period of time.\n\n4.  **Distinguish from Other Container Types:** It is crucial to distinguish an ampule from a single-dose **vial**. A single-dose vial has a rubber stopper that can be punctured. According to USP <797>, if a single-dose vial is entered in an ISO Class 5 environment, it may be used for up to 12 hours after the initial puncture. This rule **does not** apply to ampules. The key difference is the ability to reseal (the vial's stopper) versus the inability to reseal (the ampule's broken neck).\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the BUD:** For an opened ampule, the concept of a Beyond-Use Date for storage is not applicable. The directive is for immediate use. Therefore, the BUD is effectively zero time after the initial withdrawal of the dose. The contents must be used immediately, and any remaining medication discarded.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Vial:** This is the most common point of confusion. The 12-hour rule applies *only* to single-dose vials entered in an ISO 5 environment, not to ampules.\n2.  **Inability to Reseal:** The fundamental reason for the immediate-use rule for ampules is that they cannot be hermetically resealed once broken open.\n3.  **Role of the Sterile Environment:** Opening the ampule in a sterile environment (like a laminar airflow hood) minimizes the risk of contamination *during the process of withdrawing the dose*. It does not make it safe to store the opened ampule for later use.\n4.  **\"Immediate Use\":** This term means the administration of the drug should begin promptly after the dose is prepared, with no storage in between.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the USP <797> guidelines, an ampule is a single-dose container that cannot be resealed after opening. This means its sterility is compromised once opened. Regardless of whether it is opened in a sterile environment or not, the contents must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. There is no allowable storage time, so a BUD for storage cannot be assigned.\n\n<<<An opened ampule must be used immediately. Any unused portion must be discarded and cannot be stored for any period of time."
