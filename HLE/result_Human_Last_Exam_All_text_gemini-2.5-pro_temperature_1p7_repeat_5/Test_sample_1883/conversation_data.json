    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the ratio of the two isomer products.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactant and the reaction type.**\nThe reactant is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene. This is a 10-carbon chain with four conjugated double bonds. The reaction is a thermal electrocyclic reaction, which involves the formation of a sigma bond to close a ring. The conjugated system involved is an octatetraene (C2 to C9), which has 8 π-electrons. The cyclization will form an eight-membered ring, specifically a dimethylcyclooctatriene.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) theory to determine the mode of ring closure.**\nAccording to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, which are derived from FMO theory, for a thermal electrocyclic reaction, the mode of rotation of the termini depends on the number of π-electrons.\n- 4n π-electrons: Conrotatory motion\n- 4n+2 π-electrons: Disrotatory motion\n\nThe reactant has 8 π-electrons, which is a 4n system (where n=2). Therefore, the thermal electrocyclic ring closure must proceed via a **conrotatory** motion, where the two termini of the conjugated system rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise).\n\n**Step 3: Determine the stereochemistry of the reactant's termini.**\nTo predict the stereochemistry of the product, we need to determine the spatial arrangement of the substituents on the terminal carbons (C2 and C9) in the reactive conformation. The substituents are a methyl group (Me) and a hydrogen atom (H) at each terminus. We can determine if these groups point \"inward\" toward the center of the coiling chain or \"outward\" by tracing the stereochemistry along the chain.\n\nLet's systematically determine the orientation of substituents, assuming the chain is coiled up for reaction. We can define the Me group at C2 as pointing **out**.\n- At C2: The Me group is **out**.\n- C2=C3 is Z: This orients the chain such that the relative orientation flips.\n- C4=C5 is Z: Another flip.\n- C6=C7 is Z: Another flip.\n- C8=C9 is E: This maintains the relative orientation.\n\nA simpler method is to draw the reactive conformation and trace the substituent positions:\n1.  Let the Me group at C2 point **UP** (outward) and H **DOWN** (inward).\n2.  C2=C3 is Z: The main chain at C3 is on the same side as the Me group.\n3.  C4=C5 is Z: Continues the all-cis like coiling.\n4.  C6=C7 is Z: Continues the all-cis like coiling.\n5.  C8=C9 is E: The Me group at C9 is on the opposite side of the chain from the part connected to C7. A careful trace reveals that this E-linkage directs the methyl group at C9 to an **inward** position.\n\nSo, for the starting reactant, \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene (let's call it S_E), the terminal substituents are arranged as:\n- C2: Me is **out**, H is **in**.\n- C9: Me is **in**, H is **out**.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the stereochemistry of the product from the given reactant.**\nWe combine the substituent arrangement from Step 3 with the conrotatory motion from Step 2.\n- Reactant S_E has one Me(out) and one Me(in).\n- Performing a conrotatory closure (e.g., both termini rotate clockwise), the `Me(out)` group at C2 moves to one face of the new ring (e.g., down), while the `Me(in)` group at C9 also moves to the same face (down).\n- A detailed analysis confirms this: A CW rotation moves the 'out' group on the left terminus down, and the 'in' group on the right terminus down. Both methyl groups end up on the same side of the ring.\nTherefore, the conrotatory cyclization of \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene yields the **cis-dimethylcyclooctatriene** product, which is isomer **A**.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the origin of the second product.**\nThe problem states that a second product, the **trans-isomer B**, is also formed. Since the allowed thermal reaction of the starting material exclusively gives the cis-isomer A, the trans-isomer B must be formed from a different stereoisomer of the reactant, which is in thermal equilibrium with the starting material. This isomer is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8Z)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene (let's call it S_Z).\n- For S_Z, a similar analysis shows both terminal methyl groups are in the **out** position.\n- Conrotatory closure of S_Z (with Me(out) and Me(out)) leads to the two methyl groups being on opposite faces of the ring, forming the **trans-isomer B**.\n\nSo, we have the following reaction scheme:\nS_E  ⇌  S_Z\n↓ k_A     ↓ k_B\nA (cis)  B (trans)\n\n**Step 6: Predict the ratio of products A and B.**\nUnder thermal conditions, the isomerization between S_E and S_Z is typically fast compared to the cyclization. This is a Curtin-Hammett situation, where the ratio of products is determined not by the populations of the starting material isomers, but by the difference in the free energies of the transition states leading to the products.\nProduct Ratio (A/B) = k_A / k_B = exp[-(G_TS_A - G_TS_B)/RT]\n\nWe need to compare the stabilities of the two transition states:\n- **TS_A**: The transition state for the S_E → A reaction. It arises from the reactant with one Me group pointing **inward**. This inward-pointing methyl group experiences significant steric repulsion from the hydrogen atoms on the backbone of the coiled polyene.\n- **TS_B**: The transition state for the S_Z → B reaction. It arises from the reactant where both Me groups point **outward**. The inward positions are occupied by less bulky hydrogen atoms.\n\nBased on this steric analysis, the transition state TS_A is higher in energy (less stable) than TS_B due to the severe steric clash involving the inward methyl group.\nE(TS_A) > E(TS_B)\n\nSince the rate of reaction is inversely related to the activation energy, the reaction S_Z → B will be faster than S_E → A (k_B > k_A). Therefore, the **trans-isomer B will be the major product**, and the **cis-isomer A will be the minor product**. The ratio A:B will be less than 1.\n\nA reasonable estimate for the energy difference due to such a steric interaction is a few kJ/mol. An energy difference (E_TS_A - E_TS_B) of about 2.7 kJ/mol would lead to a product ratio of approximately 1:3 at room temperature. This is a common pattern for selectivities governed by this type of steric control.\n\nThus, we predict the ratio of A to B to be 1:3.\n\nFinal conclusion: Product A is the cis-isomer and Product B is the trans-isomer. The ratio of A to B is predicted to be 1:3.\n\n<<<1:3>>>"
