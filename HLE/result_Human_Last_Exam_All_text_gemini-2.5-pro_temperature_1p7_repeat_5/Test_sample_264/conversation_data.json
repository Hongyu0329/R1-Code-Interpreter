    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the volume of the intersection of the two cubes.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define the Cubes and Coordinate System**\n    *   Let the first cube, C1, be aligned with the coordinate axes and placed with one corner at the origin.\n    *   The region occupied by C1 is defined by the inequalities:\n        *   `0 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n        *   `0 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n        *   `0 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n    *   The side length of this cube is 1, and its volume is `1^3 = 1`.\n\n2.  **Interpret the Shift**\n    *   The second cube, C2, is identical to C1 but shifted relative to it.\n    *   The shift is \"along the main diagonal\". For the cube C1 positioned at `[0,1]^3`, a main diagonal connects the origin `(0,0,0)` to the opposite vertex `(1,1,1)`. The vector representing this diagonal is `d = <1, 1, 1>`.\n    *   The phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is best interpreted as being shifted by a vector whose components correspond to a movement of 1/2 along each principal direction of the diagonal. This means the shift vector `v` is `v = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n    *   This interpretation is common for such geometry problems and leads to a symmetrical and clean result. It implies that the displacement of the second cube relative to the first has components of 1/2 along the x, y, and z axes.\n\n3.  **Define the Position of the Second Cube**\n    *   The second cube, C2, is the translation of C1 by the vector `v = <1/2, 1/2, 1/2>`.\n    *   To find the coordinates defining C2, we add the shift vector components to the inequalities for C1:\n        *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 3/2`\n        *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 3/2`\n        *   `0 + 1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1 + 1/2`  =>  `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 3/2`\n\n4.  **Determine the Region of Intersection**\n    *   The intersection of the two cubes is the volume where a point `(x, y, z)` satisfies the inequalities for *both* C1 and C2. We find the overlapping range for each coordinate.\n    *   **For the x-coordinate:** The point must be in the interval `[0, 1]` (from C1) AND `[1/2, 3/2]` (from C2). The intersection of these two intervals is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **For the y-coordinate:** The point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   **For the z-coordinate:** The point must be in `[0, 1]` AND `[1/2, 3/2]`. The intersection is `[1/2, 1]`.\n    *   Therefore, the region of intersection is a smaller cube defined by:\n        *   `1/2 ≤ x ≤ 1`\n        *   `1/2 ≤ y ≤ 1`\n        *   `1/2 ≤ z ≤ 1`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Volume of the Intersection**\n    *   The shape of the intersection is a cube.\n    *   The side length of this intersection cube is the length of each interval found in the previous step: `1 - 1/2 = 1/2`.\n    *   The volume of a cube is `(side length)^3`.\n    *   Volume of intersection = `(1/2)^3 = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"Shift\":** The most critical point is the interpretation of \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\". The alternative, a shift *distance* of 1/2, would result in a shift vector `v = <1/(2√3), 1/(2√3), 1/(2√3)>` and a much more complex volume of `(1 - 1/(2√3))^3`. The interpretation of the shift components being 1/2 is standard and results in a neater problem.\n*   **Choice of Main Diagonal:** A cube has four main diagonals. However, due to the symmetry of the cube, the volume of the intersection is the same regardless of which main diagonal is chosen for the shift, as long as the cubes' orientations (axes) are parallel.\n*   **No Rotation:** The problem uses the word \"shifted,\" which implies a translation (a slide without turning). If the second cube were also rotated, the problem would be significantly more difficult. We assume the cubes' edges remain parallel.\n\nThe analysis robustly leads to the conclusion that the intersection is a cube with a side length of 1/2.\n\n<<<1/8>>>"
