    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the precise range of verses (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam where the names of the prophets are mentioned.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure of the Poem:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam is a pedagogical poem that outlines the essential tenets of Islamic creed in a logical order. After discussing the attributes of Allah, it moves on to the belief in His Messengers (Prophets). This section has two main parts: a discussion of the obligatory, possible, and impossible attributes of the prophets, followed by a specific list of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Qur'an whose names are considered necessary for a Muslim to know.\n\n2.  **Locate the Introductory Verse for the List:** Before listing the names, the author, Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi, states the number of prophets that will be enumerated. This is a crucial landmark to find the start of the list. This occurs in **Bayt 36**:\n    *   **Verse (Bayt) 36:**\n        وَتَفْصِيلُهُمْ خَمْسَةٌ وَعِشْرُونَ لَازِمٌ  *** كُلُّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمِ\n        *Translation: Their detailed list is twenty-five, which is necessary *** for every legally responsible person, so ascertain and seize [this knowledge].*\n    *   **Careful Point:** This verse states that 25 names will be listed, but it does not contain any of the names itself. Therefore, it is the verse that *precedes* the list, not the start of the list itself.\n\n3.  **Identify the Starting Verse of the List:** The very next verse after the introduction begins the enumeration of the prophets' names, starting with Prophet Adam (peace be upon him). This is **Bayt 37**:\n    *   **Verse (Bayt) 37:**\n        هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعَ صَالِحْ *** وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\n        *Translation: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud with Salih, *** and Ibrahim, each is to be followed.*\n    *   **Analysis:** This is the definitive start of the list of names.\n\n4.  **Trace the List to Find the Concluding Verse:** We must follow the list through the subsequent verses to find where the 25th prophet is named.\n    *   **Verse (Bayt) 38:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub, Yusuf, and Ayyub.\n    *   **Verse (Bayt) 39:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa, al-Yasa', Dhu al-Kifl, Dawud, and Sulayman.\n    *   **Verse (Bayt) 40:** This verse concludes the list.\n        إِلْيَاسُ يُونُسُ زَكَرِيَّا يَحْيَى *** عِيسَى وَطَهَ خَاتِمٌ دَعْ غَيَّا\n        *Translation: Ilyas, Yunus, Zakariyya, Yahya, *** 'Isa and Taha, the Seal; leave deviation.*\n    *   **Careful Point:** The name \"Taha\" (طه) is one of the names/titles of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him), who is referred to here as the \"Khatim\" (the Seal of the Prophets). This is the 25th and final prophet in the list.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Range:**\n    *   The enumeration of the names begins in **Bayt 37**.\n    *   The enumeration of the names concludes in **Bayt 40**.\n    *   Therefore, the prophets' names are mentioned from Bayt 37 to Bayt 40, inclusive.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, the names of the Prophets are mentioned within a specific range of verses in the poem.\n\n<<<From Bayt 37 to Bayt 40>>>"
