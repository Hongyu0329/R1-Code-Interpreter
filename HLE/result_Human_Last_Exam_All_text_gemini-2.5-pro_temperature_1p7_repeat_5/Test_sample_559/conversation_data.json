    "An analysis of the system of differential equations is performed to find the separatrix.\n\n**1. Identify Equilibrium Points**\nThe equilibrium points of the system are found by setting both derivatives to zero:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1 - u) = 0$\n$u'(t) = (u - 1)u^2 = 0$\n\nFrom the second equation, $u' = 0$, we get $u = 0$ or $u = 1$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substituting $u=0$ into the first equation:\n    $2d^2 + (0)d - 0 = 0 \\implies 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d = 0$.\n    This gives the equilibrium point $E_1 = (0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substituting $u=1$ into the first equation:\n    $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1 - 1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d + 1) = 0 \\implies d = 0$ or $d = -1$.\n    This gives two equilibrium points: $E_2 = (1, 0)$ and $E_3 = (1, -1)$.\n\nThe equilibrium points in the specified region $u \\geq 0$ are $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(1, -1)$.\n\n**2. Classify Equilibrium Points using Linearization**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system $\\mathbf{F}(u,d) = (u', d')^T$:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial d'}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$\nSince the Jacobian is a lower triangular matrix, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries:\n$\\lambda_1 = 3u^2 - 2u$\n$\\lambda_2 = 4d - 3u + 5u^2$\n\n*   **At $E_1 = (0, 0)$:**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 0$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$. This is a non-hyperbolic point, and linearization is inconclusive.\n\n*   **At $E_2 = (1, 0)$:**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = 2$\n    Since both eigenvalues are positive, $E_2 = (1, 0)$ is an unstable node (a source).\n\n*   **At $E_3 = (1, -1)$:**\n    $\\lambda_1 = 3(1)^2 - 2(1) = 1$\n    $\\lambda_2 = 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 = -4 - 3 + 5 = -2$\n    Since the eigenvalues have opposite signs ($\\lambda_1 > 0$, $\\lambda_2 < 0$), $E_3 = (1, -1)$ is a saddle point.\n\n**3. Find the Separatrix**\nA separatrix is a trajectory that divides the phase plane into regions of different long-term behavior. The stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points are separatrices. We look for the manifolds of the saddle point $E_3 = (1, -1)$.\nThe trajectories in the phase plane are solutions to the differential equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d + u^4 - u^3}{u^3 - u^2}$\n\nThis is a complex equation, but we can search for simple polynomial solutions of the form $d(u) = au^2 + bu + c$.\nSubstituting this form into the equation leads to a system of algebraic equations for the coefficients $a, b, c$.\nBy comparing the coefficients of the powers of $u$, we find two solutions:\n1.  $a = -1, b = 0, c = 0 \\implies d = -u^2$\n2.  $a = -1, b = 1, c = 0 \\implies d = u - u^2$\n\nNow we check which of these invariant curves corresponds to a manifold of the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n*   For the curve $d = -u^2$: At $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$.\n*   For the curve $d = u - u^2$: At $u=1$, $d=1-1^2=0$. This curve passes through the equilibrium point $(1, 0)$, not the saddle point.\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ passes through the saddle point. Let's verify that it corresponds to one of its manifolds by checking the slope. The eigenvectors of the Jacobian at the saddle point determine the slopes of the manifolds.\nAt $E_3=(1,-1)$, the Jacobian is $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe unstable manifold corresponds to the positive eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The associated eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_1$ is found by solving $(J - \\lambda_1 I)\\mathbf{v}_1 = 0$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_u \\\\ v_d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies -6v_u - 3v_d = 0 \\implies v_d = -2v_u$.\nThe eigenvector is proportional to $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$, so the slope of the unstable manifold at the saddle point is $v_d/v_u = -2$.\n\nNow we find the slope of the curve $d = -u^2$ at $u=1$:\n$\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$. At $u=1$, the slope is $-2(1)=-2$.\nSince the curve $d=-u^2$ passes through the saddle point $(1, -1)$ and its tangent at that point matches the direction of the unstable manifold, this curve is the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\nThe unstable manifold of a saddle point is a separatrix of the system.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
