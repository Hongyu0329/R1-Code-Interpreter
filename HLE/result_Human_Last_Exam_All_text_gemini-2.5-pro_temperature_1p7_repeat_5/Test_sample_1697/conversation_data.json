    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\n\nThe starting material is N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide. Let's break down its structure:\n*   **Benzamide:** A benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is in turn connected to a nitrogen atom. This is the main functional group, and the carbon atom of the benzene ring attached to it is designated as C1.\n*   **N,N-diethyl:** Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide. The amide group is -C(=O)N(CH₂CH₃)₂.\n*   **3-dimethylamino:** A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached to the C3 position (meta position) of the benzene ring relative to the amide group.\n\nThe structure is a benzene ring with an N,N-diethylcarboxamide group at position C1 and a dimethylamino group at position C3.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the First Reaction (sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF)**\n\nThis step involves a reaction known as **Directed Ortho-Metalation (DoM)**.\n*   **sec-BuLi (sec-Butyllithium):** This is a very strong organometallic base. Its primary role in this context is to remove a proton (deprotonate) from the most acidic position on the molecule.\n*   **TMEDA (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine):** This is a chelating agent. It coordinates strongly with the lithium ion (Li⁺) of sec-BuLi. This has two effects:\n    1.  It breaks up the aggregates in which organolithium reagents usually exist, making the base more reactive.\n    2.  It helps direct the lithiation by coordinating to the lithium atom, which is itself coordinated to a Lewis basic group on the substrate.\n*   **THF (Tetrahydrofuran):** This is the solvent, a polar aprotic ether suitable for organolithium reactions at low temperatures.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**\n\nThe sec-BuLi will deprotonate a C-H bond on the aromatic ring. The position of deprotonation is determined by a \"directing group,\" which is a functional group that can coordinate to the lithium ion and direct the base to an adjacent (ortho) position.\n\nThe starting material has two potential directing groups:\n1.  **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂):** The carbonyl oxygen is an excellent Lewis base. This group is one of the most powerful directing groups for ortho-metalation. It will direct deprotonation to its ortho positions, C2 and C6.\n2.  **Dimethylamino group (-NMe₂):** The nitrogen atom has a lone pair and can also act as a directing group, but it is significantly weaker than the carboxamide group.\n\nSince the carboxamide group is the stronger director, the lithiation will occur at a position ortho to it (C2 or C6). Now we must decide between these two positions.\n\n*   **Acidity:** The proton at C2 is positioned between two electron-withdrawing groups (the amide at C1 and the amino group at C3). The combined inductive effect of these groups makes the C2 proton significantly more acidic than the C6 proton, which is only ortho to the amide group.\n*   **Cooperative Directing Effect (Chelation):** The deprotonation at C2 is strongly favored because the lithium ion can be simultaneously coordinated by both the carbonyl oxygen of the amide group and the nitrogen of the dimethylamino group. This forms a stable five-membered chelate ring in the transition state, lowering the activation energy for deprotonation at C2. Deprotonation at C6 does not allow for such chelation.\n\nDue to these electronic and chelating effects, the deprotonation occurs exclusively at the C2 position, forming an aryllithium intermediate: **N,N-diethyl-2-lithio-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Second Reaction (Methyl Iodide)**\n\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion at C2). The second step involves adding an electrophile.\n*   **Methyl Iodide (CH₃I):** This is a classic electrophile. The carbon atom is electron-deficient and readily attacked by nucleophiles.\n\nThe nucleophilic carbanion at C2 of the aryllithium intermediate attacks the electrophilic methyl group of methyl iodide in an S_N2 reaction. The lithium at C2 is replaced by a methyl group, and lithium iodide (LiI) is formed as a byproduct.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the Final Product**\n\nThe reaction sequence adds a methyl group to the C2 position of the starting material.\n*   Starting Material: N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n*   Final Product: N,N-diethyl-**2-methyl**-3-dimethylaminobenzamide\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide>>>"
