The product is a bicyclo[8.3.0]tridecene derivative formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The key structural features are: a ten-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring. The original C2 alcohol is oxidized to a ketone. A new double bond is formed between the original C1 and C6 positions of the norbornene core. The dimethoxy ketal at C7 and the silyl ether on the cyclopentane ring remain intact.
