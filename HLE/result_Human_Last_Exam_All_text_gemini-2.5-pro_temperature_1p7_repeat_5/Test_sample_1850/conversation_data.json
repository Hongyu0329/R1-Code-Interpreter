    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step 1: Defining the Key Terms**\n\nFirst, we must understand the precise meaning of the terms in the question: \"historical saints,\" \"mentioned by name,\" and \"in Milton's Paradise Lost.\"\n\n*   **\"Historical Saint\"**: In the context of John Milton, a devout Protestant, this term does not refer to saints canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Instead, it refers to any major holy and revered human figure from the biblical narrative, whom Milton and his contemporary readers would have considered a historical person central to the story of salvation. This includes patriarchs, prophets, and kings from the Old Testament, as well as foundational figures like Adam and Eve.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\"**: This is a strict criterion. The analysis must find the explicit use of the person's name (e.g., \"David\"), not just a description, title, or epithet (e.g., \"the shepherd king\" or \"that uxorious king\").\n*   **\"In Milton's Paradise Lost\"**: This is the most crucial point of definition. The work consists of two parts: the epic verse itself and the prose \"Arguments\" that Milton wrote to preface each of the twelve books. A thorough analysis must consider both the verse and the Arguments as integral parts of the complete work.\n\n### **Step 2: Analysis of the Poem's Verse**\n\nA careful search of the approximately 10,500 lines of verse in *Paradise Lost* reveals that Milton often prefers to use descriptive titles rather than proper names for many biblical figures, a technique which enhances the poem's epic and classical style.\n\n*   **Adam** and **Eve**: These are the protagonists of the latter half of the epic. They are mentioned by name frequently throughout the poem. (Count: 2)\n*   **Other figures (Alluded to but NOT named in the verse)**:\n    *   **Moses**: Referred to as \"That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed\" (Book I, Line 8).\n    *   **Abraham**: Referred to as the \"Father of the faithful\" (Book XII, Line 148).\n    *   **Abel** and **Cain**: Their story is visually described in detail to Adam in Book XI, but their names are not used in the verse.\n    *   **Noah**: Described as the \"one just Man\" who builds the Ark (Book XI).\n    *   **David**: Alluded to as the king from whose \"house\" the Messiah would spring.\n    *   **Solomon**: Referred to as \"that uxorious King, whose heart though large, / Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell\" (Book I, Lines 442-444).\n    *   **The Virgin Mary**: Referred to as \"a pure Virgin\" (Book XII, Line 368).\n\nBased on an analysis of the poem's verse *alone*, only **two** historical saints are mentioned by name: Adam and Eve.\n\n### **Step 3: Analysis of the Prose \"Arguments\"**\n\nThe prose Arguments that preface each book contain a much more direct, historical summary of events. Here, Milton names many more figures.\n\n*   **Argument to Book XI**: Mentions the story of **Abel**'s murder by Cain. It also mentions the \"translation of **Enoch**\" and the flood, noting the preservation of **Noah** and his family.\n*   **Argument to Book XII**: The history of Israel is summarized, explicitly naming:\n    *   **Abraham**, **Isaac**, and **Jacob**.\n    *   **Moses**, who leads the Israelites from Egypt.\n    *   **Joshua**, who leads them into Canaan.\n    *   **David**.\n    *   **Solomon**.\n\nThis adds ten new names to our list from the Arguments:\n1.  Abel\n2.  Enoch\n3.  Noah\n4.  Abraham\n5.  Isaac\n6.  Jacob\n7.  Moses\n8.  Joshua\n9.  David\n10. Solomon\n\n### **Step 4: Compiling the Final List and Count**\n\nTo answer the question fully, we must combine the names found in the verse with those found in the Arguments.\n\n1.  **Adam** (from the verse)\n2.  **Eve** (from the verse)\n3.  **Abel** (from the Argument to Book XI)\n4.  **Enoch** (from the Argument to Book XI)\n5.  **Noah** (from the Argument to Book XI)\n6.  **Abraham** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n7.  **Isaac** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n8.  **Jacob** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n9.  **Moses** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n10. **Joshua** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n11. **David** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n12. **Solomon** (from the Argument to Book XII)\n\nAll of these individuals fit the definition of a \"historical saint\" in the Miltonic/Protestant tradition as key figures in the biblical narrative. Combining the two lists gives a total of 12 unique historical saints mentioned by name.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBy carefully analyzing the full text of John Milton's *Paradise Lost*, including both the poem's verse and the official prose \"Arguments\" for each book, there are 12 historical saints mentioned by name.\n\n<<<12>>>"
