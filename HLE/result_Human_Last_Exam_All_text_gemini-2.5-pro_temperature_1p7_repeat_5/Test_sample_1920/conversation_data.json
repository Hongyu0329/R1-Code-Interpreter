    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step 1: Prime Factorization of the Conductor\n\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $d$ is not divisible by 2 or 5.\n    \\item The sum of digits is $5+3+5+9+9=31$, which is not divisible by 3.\n    \\item Let's try dividing by small prime numbers:\n    $53599 \\div 7 = 7657$\n    \\item Now we factorize $7657$:\n    $7657 \\div 13 = 589$\n    \\item Now we factorize $589$:\n    $589 \\div 19 = 31$\n    \\item $31$ is a prime number.\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the prime factorization of $d$ is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\nThis is a square-free integer.\n\n### Step 2: Dirichlet Characters and their Properties\n\nLet $\\chi$ be a Dirichlet character modulo $d$. Since $d=p_1 p_2 p_3 p_4$ is a product of distinct primes, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the group of characters modulo $d$ is a direct product of the character groups modulo each prime factor. Any character $\\chi$ mod $d$ can be uniquely written as a product:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31} $$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $p$.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n1.  **Primitivity:** For a square-free conductor $d = p_1 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k}$ is primitive if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-trivial. A character $\\chi_p$ is non-trivial if its order is greater than 1.\n2.  **Order:** The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters:\n    $$ \\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) $$\n\nWe are looking for primitive characters of order 6. This imposes the following conditions on the component characters $\\chi_p$:\n1.  For each $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$.\n2.  $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Component Characters\n\nThe order of a character $\\chi_p$ must divide the order of the group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$, which is $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is cyclic, so for any $k$ that divides $p-1$, there are exactly $\\phi(k)$ characters of order $k$.\n\nLet's check the values of $p-1$ for our primes:\n*   $p_1=7, p_1-1 = 6$.\n*   $p_2=13, p_2-1 = 12$.\n*   $p_3=19, p_3-1 = 18$.\n*   $p_4=31, p_4-1 = 30$.\n\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(\\dots)=6$ implies that for each component $\\chi_p$, its order must divide 6. Since all $p-1$ are divisible by 6, this is possible for all components.\nCombining with the primitivity condition ($\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) > 1$), the possible orders for each component character $\\chi_p$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\nLet's count the number of available characters for each of these orders:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\nFor each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$, since $p-1$ is a multiple of 6, we have the same number of choices for $\\chi_p$ for any given order $k \\in \\{2,3,6\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Characters using Inclusion-Exclusion\n\nWe need to count the number of ways to choose four characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that their orders $(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31})$ are from the set $\\{2,3,6\\}$ and their lcm is exactly 6.\n\nThis is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem.\nThe condition $\\text{lcm}(k_7, k_{13}, k_{19}, k_{31}) = 6$ is equivalent to:\n*   All orders $k_p$ must divide 6.\n*   At least one order must be divisible by 2.\n*   At least one order must be divisible by 3.\n\nLet's apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\n1.  **Total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6:**\n    For each prime $p$, the character $\\chi_p$ must be non-trivial and have an order dividing 6. The possible orders are 2, 3, or 6.\n    The number of choices for each $\\chi_p$ is $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    Since there are 4 prime factors, the total number of such combinations is $5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\n2.  **Subtract cases where the lcm is not 6:**\n    This total of 625 includes characters where the order is a proper divisor of 6 (i.e., 1, 2, or 3). The order cannot be 1 due to the primitivity condition. So we subtract the cases where the order is 2 or 3.\n    *   **Case A: Order divides 2 (i.e., order is 2)**\n        The order of $\\chi$ is 2 if and only if the order of each component $\\chi_p$ is 2 (since they must all be non-trivial).\n        For each prime $p$, there is $\\phi(2) = 1$ character of order 2.\n        The number of characters of order 2 is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1^4 = 1$.\n    *   **Case B: Order divides 3 (i.e., order is 3)**\n        The order of $\\chi$ is 3 if and only if the order of each component $\\chi_p$ is 3.\n        For each prime $p$, there are $\\phi(3) = 2$ characters of order 3.\n        The number of characters of order 3 is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$.\n\nThe sets of characters of order 2 and order 3 are disjoint. Thus, the number of primitive characters with order 6 is the total number of primitive characters with order dividing 6, minus those with order 2, minus those with order 3.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\n\nNumber of characters of order 6 = (Total primitive characters with order dividing 6) - (Number of characters of order 2) - (Number of characters of order 3)\n$$ N_6 = 625 - 1 - 16 = 608 $$\n\nFinal check of the reasoning:\n- The decomposition of characters is correct for a square-free conductor.\n- The conditions for primitivity and order are correctly stated.\n- The counting of characters of a specific order from a cyclic group $(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$ is correct ($\\phi(k)$).\n- The inclusion-exclusion logic correctly identifies the sets to be subtracted. Total with order dividing 6, less those with order dividing 2 and those with order dividing 3. The intersection (order dividing 1) is empty due to primitivity.\nThe calculation is correct.\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $53599$ and order $6$ is 608.\n\n<<<608>>>"
