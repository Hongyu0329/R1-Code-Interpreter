    "An analysis of the problem is as follows:\n\n**1. Identify the differential equation and find equilibrium points.**\nThe given ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ x'(t) = -x^{3}(t) + 2x^{2}(t) - x(t) $$\nLet $f(x) = -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x$. The equilibrium points are the values of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$, i.e., $f(x) = 0$.\n\nWe need to solve the equation:\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nFactor out $-x$ from the expression:\n$$ -x(x^{2} - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$. So the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^{2} = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are $x = 0$ and $x = 1$. These are the equilibrium points of the system.\n\n**2. Determine the stability of each equilibrium point.**\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x_0$, we can use the sign of the derivative of $f(x)$, which is $f'(x)$.\n*   If $f'(x_0) < 0$, the equilibrium is stable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) > 0$, the equilibrium is unstable.\n*   If $f'(x_0) = 0$, the test is inconclusive, and we need further analysis (e.g., using a phase line or higher-order derivatives).\n\nLet's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x $$\n$$ f'(x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    $f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1$.\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x=0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    $f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0$.\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method, such as a phase line analysis, to determine the stability of $x=1$.\n\n**3. Phase Line Analysis.**\nWe analyze the sign of $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$ in the intervals defined by the equilibrium points.\n*   For $x < 0$ (e.g., $x=-1$): $f(-1) = -(-1)(-1-1)^2 = 1(4) = 4 > 0$. So, $x(t)$ is increasing for $x<0$.\n*   For $0 < x < 1$ (e.g., $x=0.5$): $f(0.5) = -0.5(0.5-1)^2 = -0.5(-0.5)^2 = -0.125 < 0$. So, $x(t)$ is decreasing for $0<x<1$.\n*   For $x > 1$ (e.g., $x=2$): $f(2) = -2(2-1)^2 = -2(1) = -2 < 0$. So, $x(t)$ is decreasing for $x>1$.\n\nLet's visualize this on a phase line:\n    `------> (x=0) <------ (x=1) <------`\n\nFrom the phase line:\n*   At $x=0$, solutions from both the left ($x<0$) and the right ($x>0$) move towards $x=0$. This confirms that $x=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium point.\n*   At $x=1$, solutions from the left ($x<1$) move away from $x=1$ (towards $x=0$), while solutions from the right ($x>1$) move towards $x=1$. An equilibrium point with this behavior is called semi-stable. In the context of stability, a semi-stable point is considered **unstable** because not all nearby trajectories converge to it.\n\n**4. Count the number of stable equilibrium points.**\nBased on our analysis, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, the number of stable equilibrium points is $m=1$.\n\n**5. Calculate the final value.**\nThe problem asks for the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting the value of $m=1$, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1-2^4048>>>"
