    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Molecular Structure**\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure from the complex IUPAC name: 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\n*   **Central Core:** The molecule is built on a `2,4,6-trimethylbenzene` core (also known as mesitylene).\n*   **Substituents:** At the 1, 3, and 5 positions of this benzene ring, there are three large, identical substituent groups. The core is a hexasubstituted benzene ring, so it has no aromatic protons itself.\n*   **Linker:** Each large substituent is connected to the benzene ring via a methylene (`-CH2-`) group. The name fragment `...yl)methyl]` indicates this.\n*   **The Large Group:** The substituent is a camphor-derived indazole moiety: `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`.\n    *   This is a chiral, rigid bicyclic system. The `4,7-methano` part indicates a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (norbornane) skeleton.\n    *   The `indazol` part indicates a pyrazole ring is fused to this skeleton.\n    *   The `trimethyl` substituents are located at positions C7 (one methyl) and C8 (a gem-dimethyl group), based on the specified numbering system.\n    *   The attachment to the linker is at position N2 of the indazole ring (`...indazol-2-yl`).\n\n**2. Analyze the Overall Molecular Symmetry**\n\n*   The central core is 1,3,5-R-2,4,6-Me-benzene.\n*   The molecule possesses a C3 axis of rotation passing through the center of the benzene ring.\n*   This C3 symmetry means that the three large arms (each consisting of a substituent, its linker, and a core methyl group) are chemically equivalent.\n*   Due to this symmetry, we only need to count the number of magnetically non-equivalent protons in a single representative \"arm\" of the molecule. The total number of signals for the whole molecule will be the sum of unique proton signals within one such arm.\n\n**3. Count the Non-Equivalent Protons in One \"Arm\"**\n\nLet's systematically identify all unique proton environments in one repeating unit. We assume no accidental overlap of signals (isochrony).\n\n*   **Signal 1: Core Methyl Groups**\n    *   The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring (at positions 2, 4, 6) are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   This will produce **1 signal** (a singlet, integrating to 9H).\n\n*   **Signals 2 & 3: Linker Methylene Protons (`-CH2-`)**\n    *   The three `-CH2-` linker groups are equivalent by C3 symmetry.\n    *   Within a single `-CH2-` group, the two protons are adjacent to a chiral center (the entire camphor-derived group). This makes them diastereotopic.\n    *   Diastereotopic protons are chemically non-equivalent and will have different chemical shifts. They will couple with each other, typically forming an AB quartet.\n    *   This will produce **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Signals from the Camphor-Indazole Moiety:**\n    This part of the molecule is rigid and chiral, with stereocenters specified as (4S, 7R). Due to the lack of any internal symmetry planes, protons that are not interchangeable by rapid bond rotation will be chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   **Signal 4: Pyrazole Proton (C3-H)**\n        *   There is one proton on the pyrazole ring at the C3 position. Its environment is unique. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Signal 5: Bridgehead Proton (C4-H)**\n        *   There is a single proton on the bridgehead carbon C4. Its environment is unique. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Signals 6 & 7: Methylene Protons (C5-H2)**\n        *   The two protons on C5 (often termed endo and exo in bicyclic systems) are diastereotopic due to the rigid, chiral structure. **2 signals**.\n    *   **Signals 8 & 9: Methylene Protons (C6-H2)**\n        *   Similarly, the two protons on C6 are diastereotopic. They are in a different environment from the C5 protons because C6 is adjacent to C7 (which has a methyl group) while C5 is adjacent to C4 (which has a hydrogen atom). **2 signals**.\n    *   **Signal 10: Bridgehead Methyl Group (C7-CH3)**\n        *   The methyl group on the C7 bridgehead is in a unique environment. **1 signal**.\n    *   **Signals 11 & 12: Methano-Bridge Methyl Groups (C8-(CH3)2)**\n        *   The two methyl groups on the C8 bridge are gem-dimethyls. Since they are attached to a carbon in a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic. One methyl is positioned differently relative to the rest of the bicyclic framework than the other. **2 signals**.\n\n*   **Signal 13: Indazole N-H Proton**\n    *   The indazole ring is formed using hydrazine (H2N-NH2). For the final molecule to be neutral, one nitrogen must bear a proton. The linker is attached at N2.\n    *   A double bond cannot form at the bridgehead nitrogen (N1) due to extreme ring strain (Bredt's Rule violation). Therefore, N1 must be bonded to a hydrogen atom.\n    *   This N-H proton exists in a unique chemical environment. By C3 symmetry, the three N-H protons in the molecule are equivalent.\n    *   This will produce **1 signal** (often a broad singlet).\n\n**4. Final Tally**\n\nLet's sum the number of unique signals:\n*   Core Methyls: 1\n*   Linker -CH2-: 2\n*   C3-H: 1\n*   C4-H: 1\n*   C5-H2: 2\n*   C6-H2: 2\n*   C7-CH3: 1\n*   C8-(CH3)2: 2\n*   N1-H: 1\n\n**Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 13 signals**\n\nTherefore, 13 peaks (signals or resonances) are expected in the 1H NMR spectrum.\n\n<<<I>>>"
