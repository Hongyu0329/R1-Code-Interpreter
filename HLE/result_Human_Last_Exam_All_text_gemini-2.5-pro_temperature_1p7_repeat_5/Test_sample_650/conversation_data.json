    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the algorithm `IMAG(n, c)`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Input and Basic Operations:**\n    *   The inputs are integers `n` and `c`. The complexity will be measured in terms of the input `n`, as `c` is a constant base (`c ≥ 2`).\n    *   The basic operations in the algorithm are assignments (`:=`), comparisons (`>`), and arithmetic operations (division `/`, multiplication `*`, subtraction `-`). In standard complexity analysis, we assume these basic operations on integers of a standard size take constant time, denoted as `O(1)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Initialization (Step 1):**\n    *   `i := 0;` (1 assignment operation)\n    *   `x := n;` (1 assignment operation)\n    *   `q := ⌊x/c⌋;` (1 division, 1 floor, 1 assignment)\n    *   `a_{0} := x — qc;` (1 multiplication, 1 subtraction, 1 assignment)\n    *   This step consists of a fixed number of basic operations, regardless of the value of `n`. Therefore, the time complexity of the initialization step is constant, which is `O(1)`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the `while` loop (Step 2):**\n    *   This is the core of the algorithm. The total time spent in the loop is the (number of iterations) × (time complexity of one iteration).\n\n    *   **Time Complexity of one Iteration (the loop body):**\n        *   `i := i + 1;` (1 operation)\n        *   `x := q;` (1 operation)\n        *   `q :=. ⌊x/c⌋;` (a few basic operations)\n        *   `a_{i} := x — qc` (a few basic operations)\n        *   The body of the loop consists of a small, constant number of basic operations. Thus, the time complexity for a single iteration is `O(1)`.\n\n    *   **Number of Iterations:**\n        *   The loop continues as long as `q > 0`. We need to determine how many times the loop runs before `q` becomes 0.\n        *   Let's trace the value that `q` is based on. In each iteration, `x` is updated to the previous `q`, and the new `q` is `⌊x/c⌋`. This means the value `x` is roughly divided by `c` in each pass.\n        *   The process starts with `x=n`.\n        *   After 1 iteration, `x` is approx. `n/c`. The new `q` is approx. `n/c^2`.\n        *   After 2 iterations, `x` is approx. `n/c^2`. The new `q` is approx. `n/c^3`.\n        *   After `k` iterations, `x` is approx. `n/c^k`. The new `q` is approx. `n/c^(k+1)`.\n        *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `n/c^(k+1)` becomes less than 1.\n        *   `n / c^(k+1) < 1  =>  n < c^(k+1)`\n        *   Taking logarithm base `c` on both sides: `log_c(n) < k + 1` or `k > log_c(n) - 1`.\n        *   The number of iterations `k` is the smallest integer that satisfies this. So, the number of iterations is `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋`.\n        *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`.\n\n    *   **Total Time for the Loop:**\n        *   Total loop time = (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\n        *   Total loop time = `O(log_c n) × O(1) = O(log_c n)`.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Return Statement (Step 3):**\n    *   The algorithm returns a sequence of digits `(a_i, ..., a_0)`. The number of digits is `i+1`.\n    *   The variable `i` is incremented once per loop iteration. If the loop runs `k = ⌊log_c(n)⌋` times, the final value of `i` will be `k`.\n    *   The number of digits is `k+1 = ⌊log_c(n)⌋ + 1`, which is `O(log_c n)`.\n    *   The time to construct or return this sequence is proportional to its length, so it's `O(log_c n)`.\n\n5.  **Combine and Finalize the Complexity:**\n    *   The total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of all parts:\n        `T(n) = T(initialization) + T(loop) + T(return)`\n        `T(n) = O(1) + O(log_c n) + O(log_c n)`\n    *   The dominant term is `O(log_c n)`.\n    *   In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm does not matter because `log_c n = log_b n / log_b c`, and `1 / log_b c` is just a constant factor. It is conventional to use base 2 or omit the base, writing it as `O(log n)`.\n    *   Thus, the final time complexity is `O(log n)`.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n*   **Dominant Operation:** Identify that the `while` loop is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm for large `n`.\n*   **Loop Control Variable:** Carefully trace how the loop's control variable (`q`) changes. Notice that it's based on successive divisions of the initial number `n` by the base `c`.\n*   **Number of Iterations:** The key is to realize that the number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is logarithmically related to `n`.\n*   **Cost of Basic Operations:** Assume standard arithmetic operations take `O(1)` time, which is a common convention unless analyzing algorithms for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.\n*   **Logarithm Base:** Remember that in asymptotic notation, the base of a logarithm can be ignored because changing the base only introduces a constant multiplicative factor.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of iterations in the `while` loop. The value being processed is divided by `c` in each iteration. This repeated division means the loop executes a number of times proportional to the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`. Since the work inside the loop is constant (`O(1)`), the total complexity is `O(log_c n)`, which is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
