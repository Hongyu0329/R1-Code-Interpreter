    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group of X.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the geometric structure of X.**\nThe variety in question is $X = C^{(15)}$, which is the 15th symmetric power of a smooth projective curve C of genus $g=3$. The symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ can be identified with the space of effective divisors of degree d on C.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of algebraic curves relates the symmetric power of a curve to its Jacobian variety. The Abel-Jacobi map $u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$ sends an effective divisor D of degree d to the corresponding line bundle $\\mathcal{O}_C(D)$ (or its class in $Pic^d(C)$, which is a torsor for $J(C)$).\n\nFor degrees $d \\geq 2g-1$, this map has a special structure: it is a fibration whose fibers are projective spaces. The fiber over a line bundle $L \\in Pic^d(C)$ is the projective space $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$ of effective divisors linearly equivalent to D.\n\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition $d \\ge 2g-1$ becomes $15 \\ge 2(3)-1 = 5$, which is satisfied.\n\nTo determine the dimension of the fiber, we use the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n$\\dim H^0(C, L) - \\dim H^1(C, L) = \\deg(L) - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\nBy Serre duality, $H^1(C, L) \\cong H^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1})^*$, where $K_C$ is the canonical bundle. The degree of $K_C \\otimes L^{-1}$ is $\\deg(K_C) - \\deg(L) = (2g-2) - d = (2(3)-2) - 15 = 4 - 15 = -11$. Since the degree is negative, $H^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1}) = 0$, which implies $H^1(C, L) = 0$.\nThus, $\\dim H^0(C, L) = 13$. The projective space has dimension $\\dim H^0(C, L) - 1 = 12$.\n\nSo, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over the Jacobian $J(C)$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the Neron-Severi rank of X to that of J(C).**\nFor a projective space bundle $p: E \\to B$, where $E = \\mathbb{P}(\\mathcal{V})$ for some vector bundle $\\mathcal{V}$ over a variety $B$, the Picard group of E is related to the Picard group of B by the exact sequence:\n$0 \\to Pic(B) \\xrightarrow{p^*} Pic(E) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0$.\nThis sequence splits, leading to an isomorphism $Pic(E) \\cong Pic(B) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe Neron-Severi group is the Picard group modulo its identity component, $NS(V) = Pic(V)/Pic^0(V)$. Applying this to the isomorphism, we get $NS(E) \\cong NS(B) \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group, denoted $\\rho$, is additive in this direct sum:\n$\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + \\rho(\\mathbb{Z}) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\n\nApplying this to our situation, with $X=C^{(15)}$ as the total space and $B=J(C)$ as the base, we have:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the range of possible ranks for NS(J(C)).**\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the smallest and largest possible Neron-Severi rank for the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve. J(C) is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety. The rank of the Neron-Severi group $\\rho(A)$ of a g-dimensional abelian variety A is bounded by the Hodge number $h^{1,1}(A) = g^2$. For $g=3$, we have $1 \\le \\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$. We need to verify that these extreme values are achievable.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank:** The smallest rank, $\\rho(J(C))=1$, is achieved for a \"generic\" curve C. A generic curve (in the sense of moduli) has a Jacobian with the minimal possible endomorphism ring, $End(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor), so $NS(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, and its rank is 1. Such curves exist for any genus $g \\ge 2$.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank:** The largest possible rank, $\\rho(J(C)) = g^2 = 9$, is achieved when the Jacobian $J(C)$ has Complex Multiplication (CM). An abelian variety is said to be of CM-type if its endomorphism algebra contains a number field of degree $2g$. It is a known result that for any genus g, there exist curves C whose Jacobians are of CM-type. For $g=3$, explicit examples include the Fermat quartic curve ($x^4+y^4=z^4$) and the Klein quartic curve ($x^3y + y^3z + z^3x = 0$). The Jacobians of these curves have complex multiplication, and their Neron-Severi groups have the maximal rank of 9.\n\nSo, the range of possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ is the set of integers from 1 to 9, with both extremes being attainable.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final answer.**\nUsing the formula from Step 2, we can now find the smallest and largest possible ranks for $\\rho(X)$.\n\n*   **Smallest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n*   **Largest possible rank of NS(X):**\n    $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThus, the smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2 and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
