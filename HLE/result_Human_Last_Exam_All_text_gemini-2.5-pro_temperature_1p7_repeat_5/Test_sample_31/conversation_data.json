    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers a person needs to look at to uniquely identify which of the 21 Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) cases they have. At the PLL stage of a CFOP solve, the top layer orientation is complete (all yellow stickers facing up), but the last layer pieces (4 corners and 4 edges) need to be permuted into their correct positions.\n\n**2. Define the Pieces and Stickers**\n*   **Last Layer Pieces:** 4 corner pieces and 4 edge pieces.\n*   **Stickers per Piece:**\n    *   Each corner piece has two non-top-facing stickers. (Total: 4 x 2 = 8 stickers)\n    *   Each edge piece has one non-top-facing sticker. (Total: 4 x 1 = 4 stickers)\n*   **Total Information:** There are 12 non-top-facing stickers in total on the last layer. Seeing all 12 would obviously be enough, but we want the *minimum* required.\n\n**3. What Information a Sticker Provides**\nWhen we look at a single non-top-facing sticker, its color tells us which original piece is now in that specific location.\n*   **Example:** Imagine we are looking at the front face (Red). If we look at the sticker on the front face of the UFR (Up-Front-Right) corner piece and see that it's Blue (the color of the Left face), we know that the UFL or UBL corner has been moved into the UFR slot. Seeing just one sticker of a piece is enough to uniquely identify that piece among the four of its type (corner or edge).\n\n**4. The Parity Rule**\nA crucial concept in Rubik's Cube theory is \"parity\". For any legal position reachable from a solved cube, the parity of the corner permutation must match the parity of the edge permutation.\n*   `sgn(corner_permutation) = sgn(edge_permutation)`\n*   This means if you have an odd number of corner swaps (an odd permutation), you must also have an odd number of edge swaps. If you have an even number of corner swaps, you must have an even number of edge swaps.\n*   A single swap of two pieces is an odd permutation. Swapping two pairs of pieces is an even permutation. A 3-cycle is an even permutation.\n\n**5. Testing with a Small Number of Stickers (Bottom-Up Approach)**\n\n*   **Can we do it with 4 stickers?**\n    Let's choose 4 stickers that allow us to identify the pieces in 4 distinct slots. For instance, let's observe the two front corners and the two front/right edges. The stickers would be:\n    1.  The sticker on the front face of the UFL corner.\n    2.  The sticker on the front face of the UFR corner.\n    3.  The sticker on the front face of the UF edge.\n    4.  The sticker on the right face of the UR edge.\n\n    This set of 4 stickers tells us which pieces are in the UFL, UFR, UF, and UR slots.\n    Now, consider two PLL cases:\n    *   **Case 1: The Solved State.** All pieces are in their home locations. Our 4 observed stickers all show the \"correct\" colors for their positions.\n    *   **Case 2: The Y-Perm.** This case swaps the two back corners `(UBL, UBR)` and the two back edges `(UL, UB)`.\n\n    In the Y-perm, the four pieces we are observing (UFL, UFR, UF, UR) are all untouched. Therefore, the 4 stickers we look at appear identical to the solved state. Since we cannot distinguish between the Solved State and a Y-Perm with these 4 stickers, 4 is not enough.\n\n    *Careful Point:* No matter which 4 stickers you choose, you can construct a similar counterexample with a PLL that only permutes the un-observed pieces. Therefore, the minimum number must be greater than 4.\n\n**6. Testing if 5 Stickers is Sufficient (Top-Down Approach)**\n\n*   **Can we do it with 5 stickers?**\n    Let's choose a set of 5 stickers that allows us to identify 5 distinct pieces. A strategic choice is to identify 3 corners and 2 edges. For instance:\n    1.  UFL corner's sticker on the Front face.\n    2.  UFR corner's sticker on the Front face.\n    3.  UBR corner's sticker on the Right face.\n    4.  UF edge's sticker on the Front face.\n    5.  UR edge's sticker on the Right face.\n\n    This set of 5 stickers tells us which pieces are in the UFL, UFR, UBR, UF, and UR slots.\n\n*   **The Logic Proof:**\n    1.  Assume, for the sake of argument, that two different PLL cases (`P1` and `P2`) look identical when viewing these 5 stickers.\n    2.  This means that for both cases, the exact same pieces occupy these 5 slots. The only possible difference between `P1` and `P2` must lie in the permutation of the remaining, un-observed pieces.\n    3.  The un-observed pieces are 1 corner (UBL) and 2 edges (UL, UB).\n    4.  Since a corner piece cannot go into an edge slot, the remaining corner (UBL) must be in the remaining corner slot for both `P1` and `P2`. So, the corner permutations of `P1` and `P2` must be identical.\n    5.  This leaves only one way for `P1` and `P2` to be different: the two un-observed edges (UL and UB) must be swapped. This means `P2` is the same as `P1` followed by a single swap of two edges.\n    6.  Here is the crucial part: a single swap of two edges is an *odd* edge permutation. Since the corner permutations are identical for `P1` and `P2`, one case would have an *odd* edge permutation and an *even* corner permutation, which violates the parity rule of the cube.\n    7.  Therefore, it is impossible for two distinct, valid PLL cases to be indistinguishable with this set of 5 stickers. The assumption in step 1 must be false.\n\n    *Careful Point:* The same logic applies if we choose to observe 2 corners and 3 edges. The only possible ambiguity would be a single swap of the two un-observed corners, which also violates parity.\n\n**7. Conclusion**\nWe have shown that 4 stickers are insufficient and that 5 strategically chosen stickers are sufficient. Therefore, the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen to fully identify the PLL case is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
