No, it is not possible. The mathematical and conceptual frameworks of quantum mechanics and Gödel's ontological proof are fundamentally different and incommensurable. Quantum mechanics is a physical theory described by linear algebra on Hilbert spaces, while Gödel's proof is a metaphysical argument articulated in modal logic. There is no deductive path to connect the concepts of one to the other.
