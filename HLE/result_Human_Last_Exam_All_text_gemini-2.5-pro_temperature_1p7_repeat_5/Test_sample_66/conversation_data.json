    "An analysis of the problem to determine the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Structure of the Flag of Tonga\nThe flag of Tonga consists of a red field with a white canton in the upper-left corner. The canton contains a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton, similar to a plus sign '+').\n\n### Step 2: Model the Flag as a Matrix\nWe represent an image of the flag as an $m \\times n$ matrix, $M$. Each pixel is assigned a value: red pixels get value $a$, and white pixels get value $b$. For the rank to be well-defined and potentially greater than 1, we assume $a$ and $b$ are distinct real numbers. The question asks for the maximal possible rank, which implies we can choose the pixel resolution of the flag image to maximize the rank, as long as it still represents the Tongan flag.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Distinct Row Types in the Matrix\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). Let's identify all the possible unique row vectors that can appear in the matrix $M$. The structure of a row depends on which part of the flag it represents.\n\nLet the canton occupy the top-left submatrix of size $m_1 \\times n_1$.\nA row vector in the matrix $M$ is of length $n$.\n\n1.  **Row in the main red field:** Any row $i > m_1$ is entirely in the red field. All its pixels are red, so all entries are $a$. All such rows are identical, represented by the vector $v_R = (a, a, \\ldots, a)$.\n\n2.  **Rows within the canton:** Any row $i \\le m_1$ passes through the canton. The first $n_1$ entries of this row correspond to pixels within the canton, while the remaining $n - n_1$ entries correspond to the red field, so they are all $a$. The pattern of the first $n_1$ entries depends on how the row intersects the red cross on the white canton background.\n    Let the set of rows that intersect the horizontal bar of the cross be $I_H$ and the vertical bar be $I_V$. Let the set of columns for the horizontal bar be $J_H$ and for the vertical bar be $J_V$. The red cross pixels in the canton are those in the set $(I_H \\times J_H) \\cup (I_V \\times J_V)$.\n\n    Let's classify the rows $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, m_1\\}$:\n    *   **Type A (Canton-White):** A row $i$ that is within the canton's vertical extent but does not intersect the cross. Since the cross is couped, such rows exist (e.g., the white margin above or below the cross). For these rows, all pixels in the canton part are white (value $b$). The full row vector is $v_W = (b, b, \\ldots, b, a, a, \\ldots, a)$, where the transition from $b$ to $a$ happens after the first $n_1$ columns.\n    *   **Type B (Canton-Vertical Arm):** A row $i$ that intersects the vertical arm of the cross but not the horizontal one (i.e., $i \\in I_V \\setminus I_H$). In the canton part of this row, pixels corresponding to columns in $J_V$ are red ($a$), and others are white ($b$). Let's call the canton part of this row vector $c_V$. The full row is $v_V = (c_V, a, a, \\ldots, a)$. All rows of this type are identical.\n    *   **Type C (Canton-Horizontal Arm):** A row $i$ that intersects the horizontal arm but not the vertical one (i.e., $i \\in I_H \\setminus I_V$). The red pixels are at columns $J_H$. Let the canton part be $c_H$. The full row is $v_H = (c_H, a, a, \\ldots, a)$. All rows of this type are identical.\n    *   **Type D (Canton-Cross Center):** A row $i$ that intersects the center of the cross where the bars overlap (i.e., $i \\in I_H \\cap I_V$). The red pixels in the canton portion are at columns $J_H \\cup J_V$. Let the canton part be $c_{HV}$. The full row is $v_{HV} = (c_{HV}, a, a, \\ldots, a)$. All rows of this type are identical.\n\nIn total, there are at most 5 distinct types of rows in the entire matrix $M$: $\\{v_R, v_W, v_V, v_H, v_{HV}\\}$. Therefore, the rank of the matrix can be at most 5.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Linear Independence\nTo find the maximal rank, we need to determine if these 5 row vectors can be linearly independent. This can be achieved by choosing the flag's pixel dimensions and the values of $a$ and $b$ appropriately. Let's assume $a \\neq b$ and $a \\neq 0$.\n\nLet's study the linear independence of these 5 vectors. We can simplify them by subtracting $v_R$ from the other four vectors. Let $k = b - a \\neq 0$.\n*   $v'_W = v_W - v_R = (b-a, \\ldots, b-a, 0, \\ldots, 0) = k \\cdot (\\vec{1}_{n_1}, \\vec{0}_{n-n_1})$\n*   $v'_V = v_V - v_R = (c_V - a\\vec{1}, \\vec{0}_{n-n_1})$. The vector $c_V - a\\vec{1}$ has entries $a-a=0$ for columns in $J_V$ and $b-a=k$ for columns not in $J_V$.\n*   $v'_H = v_H - v_R = (c_H - a\\vec{1}, \\vec{0}_{n-n_1})$. The vector $c_H - a\\vec{1}$ has entries $0$ in $J_H$ and $k$ elsewhere.\n*   $v'_{HV} = v_{HV} - v_R = (c_{HV} - a\\vec{1}, \\vec{0}_{n-n_1})$. The vector $c_{HV} - a\\vec{1}$ has entries $0$ in $J_H \\cup J_V$ and $k$ elsewhere.\n\nThe rank of $M$ is the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{v_R, v_W, v_V, v_H, v_{HV}\\}$, which is the same as the dimension of the space spanned by $\\{v_R, v'_W, v'_V, v'_H, v'_{HV}\\}$.\n\nAssuming the flag is wider than the canton ($n > n_1$) and $a \\neq 0$, the vector $v_R$ is linearly independent of the other four vectors ($v'_W, \\dots, v'_{HV}$), because $v_R$ has non-zero entries in the last $n-n_1$ positions while the others have zeros there.\n\nSo, $\\text{rank}(M) = 1 + \\dim(\\text{span}\\{v'_W, v'_V, v'_H, v'_{HV}\\})$.\nWe only need to consider the first $n_1$ components of these vectors. Ignoring the scaling factor $k$, we need to find the rank of the set of vectors:\n1.  $\\vec{u}_1 = \\vec{1}$ (the all-ones vector)\n2.  $\\vec{u}_2 = \\vec{1} - \\chi_{J_V}$ (where $\\chi_S$ is the characteristic vector of set S)\n3.  $\\vec{u}_3 = \\vec{1} - \\chi_{J_H}$\n4.  $\\vec{u}_4 = \\vec{1} - \\chi_{J_H \\cup J_V}$\n\nThe space spanned by these four vectors is the same as the space spanned by $\\{\\vec{1}, \\chi_{J_V}, \\chi_{J_H}, \\chi_{J_H \\cup J_V}\\}$. Since $\\chi_{J_H \\cup J_V} = \\chi_{J_H} + \\chi_{J_V} - \\chi_{J_H \\cap J_V}$, this is equivalent to the space spanned by $\\{\\vec{1}, \\chi_{J_H}, \\chi_{J_V}, \\chi_{J_H \\cap J_V}\\}$.\n\nThese four vectors are linearly independent if and only if we can choose the sets of columns such that the following four regions are all non-empty:\n*   Columns outside the cross: $J_C \\setminus (J_H \\cup J_V)$\n*   Columns only in the horizontal bar's span: $J_H \\setminus J_V$\n*   Columns only in the vertical bar's span: $J_V \\setminus J_H$\n*   Columns in the intersection of both spans: $J_H \\cap J_V$\n\nWe can choose the pixel resolution of the canton high enough to define column sets that satisfy these conditions. For example, let the canton width be $n_1=4$ pixels. We could define $J_H=\\{2,3\\}$ and $J_V=\\{3,4\\}$. Then all four regions are non-empty: $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{4\\}$, and $\\{3\\}$. This shows it's possible for the four vectors to be linearly independent. This leads to a rank of 4 for this part.\n\nWe also need to ensure that rows of all four canton types exist in the matrix. This requires choosing the row sets $I_H$ and $I_V$ such that the row partitions $I_C \\setminus (I_H \\cup I_V)$, $I_H \\setminus I_V$, $I_V \\setminus I_H$, and $I_H \\cap I_V$ are all non-empty. This is consistent with the visual representation of a couped cross.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude the Maximal Rank\nWe have established:\n1.  The rank of the matrix is at most 5, as there are at most 5 distinct row types.\n2.  By choosing the pixel resolution and geometry of the cross appropriately, we can ensure the 5 distinct row types are linearly independent. This makes a rank of 5 achievable.\n\nTherefore, the maximal possible rank of the matrix is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
