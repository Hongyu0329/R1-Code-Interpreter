    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Who:** Two Nobel laureates.\n    *   **What:** They were featured in a commercial.\n    *   **Which Company:** Enron.\n    *   **When:** The year 2000.\n    *   **Key Detail:** The commercial had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n    *   **Context:** The commercial is described as \"infamous,\" alluding to the deep irony of Enron's message of transparency and inquiry just before its collapse due to massive fraud.\n\n2.  **Identify the Advertising Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a real, high-profile branding effort by Enron. It aimed to portray the company not just as an energy provider, but as a forward-thinking, innovative company of ideas.\n\n3.  **Identify the Participants:** Research into this specific campaign reveals that Enron hired several prominent thinkers and public figures to appear in a series of television spots. The goal was to associate the Enron brand with intellectual heft and integrity.\n\n4.  **Cross-reference Participants with Nobel Prize Winners:** We need to find which of the people featured in these ads were also Nobel Prize winners (either at the time or later).\n    *   **Candidate 1: Mikhail Gorbachev.** The former President of the Soviet Union was featured in one of the commercials. A quick check confirms that he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 for his leading role in the peace process which characterized important parts of the international community. Since this was before the 2000 commercial, he was a Nobel laureate at the time he was featured.\n    *   **Candidate 2: Paul Krugman.** The prominent economist and New York Times columnist was also featured in one of the \"Ask Why\" commercials. We must check his Nobel status. Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.\n\n5.  **Address Potential Ambiguities (Careful Points):**\n    *   **Timing of the Prize:** It is a crucial point that Paul Krugman was not yet a Nobel laureate when the commercial aired in 2000. He won his prize eight years later. However, the question asks \"Which two Nobel laureates *were featured*,\" not \"Which two people who were Nobel laureates at the time were featured.\" Therefore, Krugman correctly fits the criteria as he is a Nobel laureate and he was featured in the commercial.\n    *   **Confirming \"Two\":** Research confirms that Gorbachev and Krugman are the two figures from that campaign who hold Nobel Prizes. Other figures, like Enron's own executives (e.g., Jeff Skilling), were also in the campaign, but they are not Nobel laureates.\n    *   **The \"Infamous\" Nature:** The participation of respected figures like a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a future Nobel-winning economist made Enron's subsequent fall from grace even more shocking and the \"Ask Why\" slogan deeply ironic. This context helps confirm we have identified the correct campaign and individuals.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, the two individuals who were featured in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercials and are also Nobel laureates are Mikhail Gorbachev and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Mikhail Gorbachev and Paul Krugman>>>"
