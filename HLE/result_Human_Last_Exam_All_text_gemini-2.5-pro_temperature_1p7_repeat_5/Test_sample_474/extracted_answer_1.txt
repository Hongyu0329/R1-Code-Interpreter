No, this approach is not valid when considering the ecological function of mimicry syndromes. The core reason is that the method uses the wrong "signal receiver" or "observer."

The ecological function of aposematic mimicry in bumblebees is to provide a clear, memorable warning signal to their natural predators, which are primarily birds. The validity of any mimicry ring is determined by whether these predators perceive the different species as similar enough to generalize their avoidance learning.

The proposed methodology substitutes bird perception with human perception. This is invalid for a critical reason: their visual systems are fundamentally different. Humans have trichromatic vision, while birds have tetrachromatic vision, meaning they can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to humans. Many insect color patterns, including those on bumblebees, have components that are only visible in the UV spectrum.

Therefore, two bee species that appear identical to a human undergraduate may look distinct to a bird predator, meaning they would not be functional mimics in nature. Conversely, species that look different to a human might be perceived as similar by a bird. By using human observers and standard photographs (which don't capture UV information), the study is measuring human aesthetic similarity, not the predator-perceived similarity that constitutes an ecologically functional mimicry syndrome.
