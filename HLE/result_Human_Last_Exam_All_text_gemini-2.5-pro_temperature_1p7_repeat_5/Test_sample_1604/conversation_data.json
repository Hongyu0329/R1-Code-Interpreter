    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Artist and the Scope of the Question\nThe question asks about paintings by **Lady Butler** (Elizabeth Thompson, 1846-1933), a renowned British painter famous for her military scenes. We need to identify the historical battles she depicted in her paintings and then determine which of those battles occurred latest in time.\n\n### Step 2: List Notable Battle Paintings by Lady Butler\nWe need to compile a list of her famous paintings and the specific battles or military campaigns they portray.\n\n*   ***The Roll Call*** (painted 1874): Depicts the aftermath of the Battle of Inkerman.\n*   ***Quatre Bras*** (painted 1875): Depicts the 28th Regiment of Foot at the Battle of Quatre Bras.\n*   ***Balaclava*** (painted 1876): Depicts the aftermath of the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava.\n*   ***The Defence of Rorke's Drift*** (painted 1880): Depicts the battle at the Rorke's Drift mission station.\n*   ***Scotland for Ever!*** (painted 1881): Depicts the charge of the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.\n*   ***Floreat Etona!*** (painted 1898): Depicts an incident during the Battle of Laing's Nek.\n*   ***The Relief of Ladysmith*** (painted 1900): Depicts the arrival of troops under Lord Dundonald, marking the end of the Siege of Ladysmith.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Historical Date of Each Depicted Battle\nNow, we must find the date for each historical event identified in Step 2. It is crucial to use the date of the event, not the date the painting was created.\n\n*   **Battle of Quatre Bras** (*Quatre Bras*) and **Battle of Waterloo** (*Scotland for Ever!*): Both were part of the Napoleonic Wars.\n    *   Date: **June 1815** (Quatre Bras was June 16th, Waterloo was June 18th).\n*   **Battle of Inkerman** (*The Roll Call*) and **Battle of Balaclava** (*Balaclava*): Both were part of the Crimean War.\n    *   Date: **November 1854** (Inkerman) and **October 1854** (Balaclava).\n*   **Battle of Rorke's Drift** (*The Defence of Rorke's Drift*): This was part of the Anglo-Zulu War.\n    *   Date: **January 1879**.\n*   **Battle of Laing's Nek** (*Floreat Etona!*): This was part of the First Boer War.\n    *   Date: **January 1881**.\n*   **Relief of Ladysmith** (*The Relief of Ladysmith*): This was a key event in the Second Boer War.\n    *   Date: **February 1900**.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Dates and Find the Latest One\nLet's list the dates of the battles in chronological order to easily identify the latest one.\n\n1.  Battle of Waterloo/Quatre Bras: **1815**\n2.  Battle of Balaclava/Inkerman: **1854**\n3.  Battle of Rorke's Drift: **1879**\n4.  Battle of Laing's Nek: **1881**\n5.  The Relief of Ladysmith: **1900**\n\nComparing these dates, the event that occurred latest in history is the Relief of Ladysmith.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe latest historical event depicted in a major painting by Lady Butler is the Relief of Ladysmith, which occurred in 1900 during the Second Boer War. This event is the subject of her 1900 painting of the same name.\n\n<<<The Relief of Ladysmith>>>"
