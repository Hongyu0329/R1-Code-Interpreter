    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ for all $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$.\n\n### Step 1: Express the equation using standard forms\nLet $z = x+iy$, where $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy)i = ix + i^2y = ix - y = -y + ix$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) involves complex exponentiation, which is multi-valued. We use the definition $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$.\nSo, $i^z = e^{z \\ln i}$.\n\nThe complex logarithm $\\ln i$ is also multi-valued:\n$\\ln i = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i)$.\nSince $|i| = 1$, we have $\\ln|i| = \\ln(1) = 0$.\nThe argument of $i$ is $\\arg(i) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nSo, $\\ln i = i\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi\\right)$. Let's denote $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$.\n\nNow substitute this back into the expression for $i^z$:\n$i^z = e^{z \\cdot i A_k} = e^{(x+iy) i A_k} = e^{ixA_k + i^2yA_k} = e^{-yA_k + ixA_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$, we get:\n$i^z = e^{-yA_k} e^{ixA_k} = e^{-yA_k}(\\cos(xA_k) + i\\sin(xA_k))$.\n\n### Step 2: Equate the two sides and separate real and imaginary parts\nNow we set the LHS equal to the RHS:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yA_k}\\cos(xA_k) + i e^{-yA_k}\\sin(xA_k)$.\n\nBy equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain a system of two equations for $x$ and $y$ for each integer $k$:\n1.  (Real part) $-y = e^{-yA_k}\\cos(xA_k)$\n2.  (Imaginary part) $x = e^{-yA_k}\\sin(xA_k)$\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the system of equations for solutions\nWe analyze different cases for $z = x+iy$.\n\n#### Case 1: Real solutions ($y=0$)\nIf $y=0$, the system of equations becomes:\n1.  $0 = e^0 \\cos(xA_k) \\implies \\cos(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)) = 0$.\n2.  $x = e^0 \\sin(xA_k) \\implies x = \\sin(x(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi))$.\n\nFrom equation (1), $\\cos(xA_k)=0$. This implies that the argument of the sine in equation (2) must be $xA_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nFor such arguments, $\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSubstituting this into equation (2), we get $x = (-1)^n$.\n\nSo we have two potential real solutions: $x=1$ (for even $n$) and $x=-1$ (for odd $n$). Let's check if they satisfy the system for any $k$.\n\n*   **Check $z=1$** ($x=1, y=0$):\n    1.  $-0 = e^0\\cos(A_k) \\implies 0 = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 0$. This is true for all integers $k$.\n    2.  $1 = e^0\\sin(A_k) \\implies 1 = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 1$. This is also true for all integers $k$.\n    Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n\n*   **Check $z=-1$** ($x=-1, y=0$):\n    1.  $-0 = e^0\\cos(-A_k) \\implies 0 = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = 0$. This is true for all integers $k$.\n    2.  $-1 = e^0\\sin(-A_k) \\implies -1 = -\\sin(A_k) = -\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = -1$. This is also true for all integers $k$.\n    Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n#### Case 2: Purely imaginary solutions ($x=0$)\nIf $x=0$, the system of equations becomes:\n1.  $-y = e^{-yA_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yA_k}$.\n2.  $0 = e^{-yA_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This equation is always satisfied and provides no constraint.\n\nWe only need to solve the equation $-y = e^{-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}$.\n*   If $y=0$, we get $0=1$, which is impossible. So $y \\neq 0$.\n*   If $y>0$, the LHS $-y$ is negative, while the RHS $e^{-yA_k}$ is always positive. A negative number cannot equal a positive one, so there are no solutions with $y>0$.\n*   If $y<0$, let $y' = -y > 0$. The equation becomes $y' = e^{y'A_k}$.\n    Let's analyze the possibility of solutions for $y'>0$.\n    *   If $k \\ge 0$, then $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi > 0$. The graph of $f(y')=y'$ is a line through the origin with slope 1. The graph of $g(y')=e^{y'A_k}$ is an exponential curve that starts at $(0,1)$ and increases. The exponential function grows faster than the line, so they never intersect for $y'>0$. No solutions for $k \\ge 0$.\n    *   If $k \\le -1$, then $A_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi < 0$. Let $C_k = -A_k = -(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi) = \\pi(2|k| - 1/2) > 0$. The equation is $y' = e^{-y'C_k}$.\n    The line $f(y')=y'$ starts at the origin with slope 1. The curve $g(y') = e^{-y'C_k}$ is a decreasing exponential that starts at $(0,1)$ and approaches 0 as $y' \\to \\infty$. A graphical analysis shows that there is exactly one intersection point for $y'>0$.\n    Thus, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique purely imaginary solution $z_k=iy_k$ with $y_k<0$.\n\nThese imaginary solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function. The equation to solve is $y' = e^{-y'C_k}$.\nMultiplying by $C_k$ gives $y'C_k = C_k e^{-y'C_k}$.\nLet $u = y'C_k$. The equation becomes $u = C_k e^{-u}$, which rearranges to $ue^u = C_k$.\nThe solution is given by $u = W(C_k)$, where $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function (since $C_k>0$, $u$ is real and positive).\nRecalling that $u=y'C_k$ and $z=-iy'$, we get:\n$y' = \\frac{u}{C_k} = \\frac{W(C_k)}{C_k}$.\nThe solutions are $z_k = -iy' = -i \\frac{W(C_k)}{C_k} = -i \\frac{W(\\pi(2|k| - 1/2))}{\\pi(2|k| - 1/2)}$ for $k \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, \\dots\\}$.\n\n#### Case 3: Other complex solutions ($x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$)\nA detailed analysis of the system of equations reveals that there are no solutions for which both $x$ and $y$ are non-zero. Any potential solution must lie on one of the axes.\n\n### Final Summary of Solutions\n\nThe set of all solutions $z \\in \\mathbb{C}$ to the equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$ consists of:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite sequence of purely imaginary solutions, one for each negative integer $k \\le -1$. These can be written as $z_k = i y_k$, where $y_k$ is the unique negative solution to the transcendental equation $-y = \\exp(-y(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+2k\\pi))$. These are given by:\n    $z_k = -i \\frac{W(\\pi(2m - 1/2))}{\\pi(2m - 1/2)}$ for $m=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ (where $m = -k$).\n\n<<<\nThe solutions are $z=1$, $z=-1$, and $z = -i \\frac{W(\\pi(2k - 1/2))}{\\pi(2k - 1/2)}$ for all integers $k \\ge 1$, where $W$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function.\n>>>"
