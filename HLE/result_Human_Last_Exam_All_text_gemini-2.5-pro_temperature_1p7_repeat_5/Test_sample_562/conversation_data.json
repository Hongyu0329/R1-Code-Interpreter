    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Character:** The character in question is 謄.\n2.  **Deconstruct the Character:** The character 謄 can be broken down into two components arranged left and right.\n    *   The left-side component is 言.\n    *   The right-side component is 朕.\n3.  **Identify the Radical (Bushu):** In characters with a left-right structure like this, the left part is very often the radical. The left-side component, 言, serves as the radical for 謄. This radical is related to \"words,\" \"speech,\" or \"language,\" which fits the meaning of 謄 (to copy, to transcribe).\n4.  **Determine the Name of the Radical:** The radical 言 has a specific name based on its position in a character. When it appears on the left side (a position called 'hen' or 'ben' in Japanese), it is called ごんべん (gonben).\n5.  **Transcribe the Name into Hepburn:** The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Distinguishing from Similar Characters:** It is important not to confuse 謄 (transcribe) with the visually similar character 騰 (rise). 騰 has the radical 月 (tsukihen) on the left side, not 言.\n*   **Correct Radical Naming Convention:** Simply identifying the radical as 言 (gen, koto) is not enough. The question asks for the name of the radical as it functions in the character, similar to the example \"Onnahen\". The specific name for the 言 radical when it's on the left side is \"Gonben\".\n*   **Accurate Romanization:** The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n\nFollowing these steps, the radical for 謄 is 言, which is called \"Gonben\" when it is on the left side of a character.\n\n<<<Gonben>>>"
