    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rank of the third homotopy group $\\pi_3(X)$ of a smooth quintic hypersurface $X$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space X\n1.  **Definition**: $X$ is a smooth hypersurface in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ defined by a single homogeneous polynomial of degree 5.\n2.  **Dimensions**: As a complex variety, $X$ has dimension 2 (it is a complex surface). As a real manifold, its dimension is 4.\n3.  **Topological Properties**: By the Lefschetz Hyperplane Theorem, the inclusion map $i: X \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{CP}^3$ induces isomorphisms on homotopy groups $\\pi_k$ for $k < \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(X) = 2$.\n    *   $\\pi_1(X) \\cong \\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3)$. Since $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ is simply connected ($\\pi_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3) = 0$), we have $\\pi_1(X) = 0$. So, $X$ is a simply connected space.\n    *   Also by Lefschetz, the inclusion induces isomorphisms on homology groups $H_k$ for $k < 2$. Thus $H_1(X; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\mathbb{CP}^3; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n4.  **Homology Groups**: Since $X$ is a simply connected 4-manifold, its homology is determined by the Betti numbers $b_k = \\text{rank}(H_k(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    *   $b_0 = 1$ (path-connected).\n    *   $b_1 = 0$ (simply connected).\n    *   By Poincaré duality on the 4-manifold $X$, $b_3 = b_1 = 0$ and $b_4 = b_0 = 1$.\n    *   It is a known result for smooth, simply connected projective hypersurfaces that their integer homology is torsion-free. Thus, $H_3(X; \\mathbb{Z}) = 0$.\n\n### Step 2: Relate Homotopy and Homology/Hodge Theory\nFor questions about rational homotopy groups of Kähler manifolds (like $X$), there are powerful results from rational homotopy theory, specifically from the work of Deligne, Griffiths, Morgan, and Sullivan.\n\n1.  **Formality of Kähler Manifolds**: A key result is that compact Kähler manifolds are \"formal,\" which simplifies the relationship between their cohomology algebra and their rational homotopy groups.\n2.  **Minimal Models**: The rational homotopy groups can be computed from the \"minimal model\" of the space. For a simply connected Kähler manifold $M$, this leads to specific relationships between its Hodge structure and its rational homotopy groups.\n3.  **The Key Formula**: For a simply connected projective manifold $M$, there exists a natural short exact sequence of complex vector spaces:\n    $$ 0 \\to (H^{2,0}(M, \\mathbb{C}))^* \\to \\pi_3(M)\\otimes\\mathbb{C} \\to H_3(M, \\mathbb{C}) \\to 0 $$\n    where $H^{2,0}(M, \\mathbb{C})$ is the space of holomorphic 2-forms on $M$, and $(V)^*$ denotes the dual vector space of $V$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the necessary invariants for X\nTo use the formula from Step 2, we need to compute the dimensions of $H^{2,0}(X, \\mathbb{C})$ and $H_3(X, \\mathbb{C})$.\n\n1.  **H_3(X)**: As established in Step 1, $H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z})=0$, which implies that the complex homology group $H_3(X, \\mathbb{C}) = H_3(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\otimes \\mathbb{C} = 0$.\n\n2.  **h^{2,0}(X)**: The dimension of $H^{2,0}(X, \\mathbb{C})$, denoted by the Hodge number $h^{2,0}(X)$, can be calculated for a smooth hypersurface of degree $d$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^{n+1}$ by the formula:\n    $$ h^{n,0}(X) = \\binom{d-1}{n+1} $$\n    In our case, $X$ is a surface (so $n=2$) of degree $d=5$ in $\\mathbb{CP}^3$ (so $n+1=3$).\n    $$ h^{2,0}(X) = \\binom{5-1}{3} = \\binom{4}{3} = 4 $$\n    So, the complex vector space $H^{2,0}(X, \\mathbb{C})$ has dimension 4.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Rank of $\\pi_3(X)$\nNow we substitute these values into the exact sequence from Step 2:\n$$ 0 \\to (H^{2,0}(X, \\mathbb{C}))^* \\to \\pi_3(X)\\otimes\\mathbb{C} \\to H_3(X, \\mathbb{C}) \\to 0 $$\n$$ 0 \\to (\\mathbb{C}^4)^* \\to \\pi_3(X)\\otimes\\mathbb{C} \\to 0 \\to 0 $$\n\nThis exact sequence implies that the map $(\\mathbb{C}^4)^* \\to \\pi_3(X)\\otimes\\mathbb{C}$ is an isomorphism of complex vector spaces. Therefore, their dimensions are equal:\n$$ \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\pi_3(X)\\otimes\\mathbb{C}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}((\\mathbb{C}^4)^*) = 4 $$\n\nThe rank of an abelian group $A$ is defined as the dimension of the rational vector space $A \\otimes \\mathbb{Q}$. The dimension of the complexification is equal to the dimension over $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\pi_3(X)) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\pi_3(X)\\otimes\\mathbb{Q}) = \\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\pi_3(X)\\otimes\\mathbb{C}) $$\n\nThus, the rank of $\\pi_3(X)$ is 4."
