    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific character from the 1972 movie *Solaris* who expresses a particular sentiment: being ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth. This quote is a key piece of dialogue that reveals the character's inner state of mind.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Sentiment**\nThe statement \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling\" conveys several things:\n*   **Deep Nostalgia:** A powerful longing for Earth and its natural environment.\n*   **Prolonged Absence:** This is a feeling someone would develop after being away from Earth for a very long time, to the point where a simple, once-common sound becomes a precious memory.\n*   **Shame and Disconnection:** The character feels shame, not just sadness. This implies a feeling of having lost a part of their humanity or of being weakened by such \"sentimental\" feelings in a high-stakes, scientific environment. They are ashamed that their focus has strayed from their mission to such a basic, earthly longing.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Character Based on the Sentiment**\n\n*   **A. Kris Kelvin:** Kris is the protagonist who has just arrived at the Solaris station from Earth. The film's long opening sequence is dedicated to his last day on Earth, emphasizing his connection to it. While he is grappling with memory and loss, he has not been isolated in space for years like the other scientists. Therefore, this specific sentiment of long-term-induced shame is less likely to be his.\n\n*   **B. Hari:** Hari is a \"visitor\" or \"guest,\" a physical manifestation created by the Solaris ocean based on Kris's memories of his deceased wife. She has no genuine memories of Earth herself, only the ones she has inherited from Kris. Her struggle is about her own identity and existence, not about missing a world she has never experienced.\n\n*   **C. Dr. Snaut:** Snaut is one of the two scientists who have been on the station for a long time when Kris arrives. He is depicted as world-weary, cynical, and deeply philosophical. He frequently talks to Kris about their isolation, the futility of their mission (\"We want to expand Earth to the borders of the cosmos\"), and the loss of their human perspective. A confession of being ashamed to miss something as simple and elemental as rustling leaves perfectly matches his character's profound sense of despair and alienation. He is the one who articulates the psychological toll of their journey.\n\n*   **D. Dr. Sartorius:** Sartorius is the other long-term scientist. He is cold, clinical, and obsessed with studying the Solaris phenomenon from a purely scientific standpoint. He actively represses emotion and treats the \"visitors\" as objects of study. Expressing a feeling of shame over nostalgia would be completely out of character for the rigid and detached Sartorius.\n\n*   **E. Dr. Gibarian:** Gibarian is the scientist who committed suicide just before Kris's arrival. Kris watches a video message left by Gibarian, but Gibarian's role is to introduce the mystery and horror of the situation. The line in question is part of a longer, living conversation, not a final message.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude Based on the Analysis**\nThe dialogue in question is spoken by Dr. Snaut to Kris Kelvin. In a moment of vulnerability, Snaut confesses how disconnected from Earth and their own humanity the crew has become. He admits that he is ashamed to find himself missing the simple sound of leaves, highlighting the profound psychological displacement he is experiencing after years in space.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n1.  **Source Material:** The question specifically refers to the 1972 Andrei Tarkovsky movie, not Stanislaw Lem's novel or the 2002 American remake, where characterizations can differ.\n2.  **Character Psychology:** The key is to match the quote to the psychological profile of the characters. The sentiment belongs to the weary philosopher (Snaut), not the newly arrived protagonist (Kris), the cold scientist (Sartorius), or the non-human replica (Hari).\n3.  **Thematic Significance:** The line is not just a passing comment; it encapsulates one of the film's central themes: the tension between humanity's quest for cosmic knowledge and its deep-rooted connection to its terrestrial home.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe analysis strongly points to Dr. Snaut as the character who delivers this line. This corresponds to choice C.\n\n<<<C>>>"
