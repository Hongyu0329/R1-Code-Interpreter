    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which condition of Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem is violated by critical-level views.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem\n\nArrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem (also known as the Second Impossibility Theorem in his work) demonstrates that a set of plausible and desirable conditions for a population axiology (a theory about the value of populations) are mutually inconsistent. No single theory can satisfy all of them simultaneously. A common formulation of the conditions involved in this theorem includes:\n\n1.  **Egalitarian Dominance**: If two populations have the same size, and every person in population A is better off than their counterpart in population B, then A is better than B.\n2.  **Weak Non-Sadism**: Adding a person with negative welfare (a life not worth living) can never make a population better.\n3.  **Non-Elitism**: There exists some very large population of people with very low positive welfare that is better than a population of one person with very high welfare. This principle asserts that quantity of lives can eventually outweigh the quality of life.\n4.  **General Non-Extreme Priority**: This is a more general version of Non-Elitism. It states that for any high welfare level, there's a sufficient number of people at a slightly lower (but still positive) welfare level that is better.\n5.  **Weak Quality Addition (WQA)**: This principle states that adding people with positive welfare can be good. A formal statement is: \"There is at least one population A such that for any additional person with positive welfare, the new population is better than A.\" A key implication is that it should be possible to make a population better by adding happy people.\n\nAny consistent theory of population ethics must violate at least one of these conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Understand Critical-Level Views\n\nCritical-level views are a family of population axiologies designed to avoid the \"Repugnant Conclusion\" of classical utilitarianism. The value of a population, according to a critical-level view, is calculated as the sum of each individual's welfare minus a \"critical level\" (*c*).\n\n*   **Value = Σ (uᵢ - c)**\n    *   Where *uᵢ* is the welfare of individual *i*.\n    *   *c* is the critical level, a constant.\n\nFor a standard critical-level view, we assume *c* is a positive value (*c* > 0). The zero-point of welfare (u=0) is where a life is neither worth living nor not worth living.\n\n*   If a person's welfare *u* > *c*, adding them has a positive effect on the total value.\n*   If a person's welfare *u* = *c*, adding them has a neutral effect.\n*   If a person's welfare *u* is such that 0 < *u* < *c*, their life is worth living (positive welfare), but adding them has a **negative** effect on the total value. This is the crucial feature of critical-level views.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze which condition Critical-Level Views Violate\n\nLet's test a critical-level view (with *c* > 0) against each condition.\n\n*   **A. Egalitarian Dominance**: Satisfied. If everyone in A is better off than their counterpart in B (u_A > u_B), and the populations are the same size, then Σ(u_A - c) will be greater than Σ(u_B - c).\n*   **D. Weak Non-Sadism**: Satisfied. Adding a person with negative welfare (u < 0) adds (u - c) to the total value. Since u is negative and c is positive, (u - c) is always a negative number. Thus, adding such a person always makes the population's value worse.\n*   **B. General Non-Extreme Priority & C. Non-Elitism**: Both Violated. These principles state that a large enough number of people at a low positive welfare level can outweigh a smaller number of people at a high welfare level. Critical-level views reject this if the \"low positive welfare\" is below the critical level *c*. A huge population where everyone has welfare *u* such that 0 < *u* < *c* will have a large negative total value (N * (u-c)) and will be judged as worse than a small population with high welfare (above *c*). This directly avoids the Repugnant Conclusion but violates these two principles.\n*   **E. Weak Quality Addition (WQA)**: Violated. This principle, in essence, states that adding happy people is a good thing. However, the core feature of critical-level views is that adding a person with a life worth living (positive welfare *u*) can be a bad thing if that person's welfare is below the critical level (*c*). Formal Statement: \"There is at least one population A ... such that for any additional person with positive welfare, the new population is better.\" A critical-level view violates this because for *any* population A, we can choose to add a person with welfare *u* such that 0 < *u* < *c*. Adding this person makes the population's value decrease by (c-u). Therefore, the condition that the population is better for *any* added person with positive welfare can never be met.\n\n### Careful Points & Final Conclusion\n\nWe have established that critical-level views violate Weak Quality Addition, Non-Elitism, and General Non-Extreme Priority. So which is the correct answer?\n\nThe most fundamental violation, which represents the core trade-off and defining characteristic of critical-level views, is the rejection of the idea that adding *any* life worth living is necessarily a neutral or good thing. This is precisely what **Weak Quality Addition** aims to capture. The violation of Non-Elitism and General Non-Extreme Priority is a *consequence* of this primary violation. Critical-level views avoid the Repugnant Conclusion (which is an instantiation of Non-Elitism) *by means of* rejecting the principle of quality addition for lives below the critical level. Therefore, the violation of Weak Quality Addition is the most direct and central consequence of adopting a critical-level view.\n\nFinal Answer is based on identifying the most direct and philosophically central principle that these views are built to reject.\n\n<<<E>>>"
