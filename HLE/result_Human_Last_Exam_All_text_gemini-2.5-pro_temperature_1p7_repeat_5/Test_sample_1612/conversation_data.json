    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question and Define \"Triple Crown\"\nThe first crucial point is to recognize that in Major League Baseball, there are two different types of Triple Crowns: one for batters (hitters) and one for pitchers. The question \"How many triple crowns winners are there\" requires us to count the total number of unique players who have won either the batting or the pitching Triple Crown.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A player must lead their league (American League or National League) in three key statistics in the same season: **batting average**, **home runs**, and **runs batted in (RBIs)**.\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher must lead their league in three key statistics in the same season: **wins**, **strikeouts**, and **earned run average (ERA)**.\n\n### Step 2: List and Count the Batting Triple Crown Winners\nWe will list every player who has won the batting Triple Crown and then count the number of unique individuals.\n\n**National League (NL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n1.  Paul Hines (1878)\n2.  Tip O'Neill (1887)\n3.  Hugh Duffy (1894)\n4.  Rogers Hornsby (1922, 1925) - *Note: Won twice, but is one player.*\n5.  Chuck Klein (1933)\n6.  Joe Medwick (1937)\n\n**American League (AL) Batting Triple Crown Winners:**\n7.  Nap Lajoie (1901)\n8.  Ty Cobb (1909)\n9.  Jimmie Foxx (1933)\n10. Lou Gehrig (1934)\n11. Ted Williams (1942, 1947) - *Note: Won twice, but is one player.*\n12. Mickey Mantle (1956)\n13. Frank Robinson (1966)\n14. Carl Yastrzemski (1967)\n15. Miguel Cabrera (2012)\n\n**Careful Point:** Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won the award twice, but they are only counted as one winner each in our total.\n**Total Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners = 15**\n\n### Step 3: List and Count the Pitching Triple Crown Winners\nNext, we will list every player who has won the pitching Triple Crown and count the unique individuals.\n\n**National League (NL) Pitching Triple Crown Winners:**\n1.  Amos Rusie (1894)\n2.  Christy Mathewson (1905, 1908)\n3.  Grover Cleveland Alexander (1915, 1916, 1920)\n4.  Dazzy Vance (1924)\n5.  Bucky Walters (1939)\n6.  Sandy Koufax (1963, 1965, 1966)\n7.  Steve Carlton (1972)\n8.  Dwight Gooden (1985)\n9.  Randy Johnson (2002)\n10. Jake Peavy (2007)\n11. Clayton Kershaw (2011)\n\n**American League (AL) Pitching Triple Crown Winners:**\n12. Cy Young (1901)\n13. Rube Waddell (1905)\n14. Walter Johnson (1913, 1918, 1924)\n15. Lefty Grove (1930, 1931)\n16. Lefty Gomez (1934, 1937)\n17. Hal Newhouser (1945)\n18. Roger Clemens (1997, 1998)\n19. Pedro Martinez (1999)\n20. Johan Santana (2006)\n21. Justin Verlander (2011)\n22. Shane Bieber (2020)\n\n**Careful Point:** Several pitchers won multiple times (notably Walter Johnson, Grover Cleveland Alexander, and Sandy Koufax with three each), but we only count each as a single unique winner.\n**Total Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners = 22**\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Total Number of Winners\nThe final step is to combine the two lists to find the total number of unique players who have won a Triple Crown of any type.\n\n*   Unique Batting Winners: 15\n*   Unique Pitching Winners: 22\n\n**Careful Point:** We must check if any player appears on both lists. There are no players in MLB history who have won both a batting Triple Crown and a pitching Triple Crown. Therefore, the two lists of winners are mutually exclusive.\n\nTotal Unique Winners = (Number of Unique Batting Winners) + (Number of Unique Pitching Winners)\nTotal Unique Winners = 15 + 22 = 37\n\nThere have been 37 different players who have won an MLB Triple Crown.\n\n<<<37>>>"
