    "Answering this question requires classifying the combinatorial types of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. A stable curve is a connected, complete, nodal curve `C` of arithmetic genus `g >= 2` such that its automorphism group `Aut(C)` is finite.\n\nThe arithmetic genus `p_a(C)` of a nodal curve is given by the formula:\n`p_a(C) = Σ g_i - k + n + 1`\nwhere:\n*   `k` is the number of irreducible components of the curve `C`.\n*   `g_i` is the geometric genus of the i-th component `C_i`.\n*   `n` is the total number of nodes (double points) on the curve.\n\nFor a curve of genus 2, we have `p_a(C) = 2`. The formula becomes:\n`2 = Σ g_i - k + n + 1`\nor\n`k - n + 1 = Σ g_i`\n\nA crucial condition for stability is that the curve's automorphism group is finite. A simplified and commonly used criterion (which is sufficient in most cases) is that for every non-singular rational component `C_i` (a component with `g_i = 0` and no self-intersections), it must be attached to the rest of the curve at 3 or more points.\n\nWe can classify the types of stable curves by the number of irreducible components, `k`. It can be shown that for genus `g=2`, a stable curve can have at most `k = 2g-2 = 2` components, but we will demonstrate this by exhaustion.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the case `k=1` (Irreducible curves)**\nThe curve `C` has one component. The genus formula becomes `1 - n + 1 = g_1`, which simplifies to `n = 2 - g_1`.\n*   If `g_1 = 2` (geometric genus 2), then `n = 0`. This is a **smooth, non-singular curve of genus 2**. (Type 1)\n*   If `g_1 = 1` (geometric genus 1, i.e., an elliptic curve), then `n = 1`. This is an **irreducible elliptic curve with one node**. (Type 2)\n*   If `g_1 = 0` (geometric genus 0, i.e., a rational curve), then `n = 2`. This is an **irreducible rational curve with two nodes**. (Type 3)\nThese are the three types of irreducible stable curves of genus 2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the case `k=2` (Curves with two components)**\nThe genus formula is `2 - n + 1 = g_1 + g_2`, which simplifies to `n = 3 - (g_1 + g_2)`. The curve must be connected, so the components `C_1` and `C_2` must be joined by at least one node. Let `n_{ij}` be the number of nodes between components `C_i` and `C_j`, and `n_{ii}` be the number of self-nodes on component `C_i`. `n = n_{11} + n_{22} + n_{12}`.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: `g_1 = 1, g_2 = 1`**\n    *   `n = 3 - (1+1) = 1`. For the curve to be connected, this single node must connect the two components, so `n_{12} = 1`.\n    *   This is **two elliptic curves connected at a single point**. This curve is stable. (Type 4)\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: `g_1 = 1, g_2 = 0`**\n    *   `n = 3 - (1+0) = 2`. `C_2` is a rational component.\n    *   **Possibility A**: The rational component `C_2` has a self-node (`n_{22}=1`). To have `n=2` and be connected (`n_{12} \\ge 1`), we must have `n_{12}=1` and `n_{11}=0`. This gives **an elliptic curve connected at one point to a rational curve which has one node**. This type is stable. (Type 5)\n    *   **Possibility B**: The rational component `C_2` is non-singular (`n_{22}=0`). Then the two nodes must connect `C_1` and `C_2` (`n_{12}=2`, so `n_{11}=0`). The rational curve `C_2` is attached at 2 points. The standard numerical criterion for stability (`2g-2+m > 0`) would suggest this is unstable (`2*0-2+2=0`). However, a deeper analysis of the automorphism group shows that for a generic elliptic curve `C_1`, the total automorphism group of the combined curve is finite. Thus, this type is also stable. It consists of **an elliptic curve and a rational curve connected at two distinct points**. (Type 6)\n\n*   **Subcase 2.3: `g_1 = 0, g_2 = 0`**\n    *   `n = 3 - (0+0) = 3`. Both `C_1` and `C_2` are rational components.\n    *   **Possibility A**: Both components are non-singular (`n_{11}=0, n_{22}=0`). To be stable, each must attach to the other at `\\ge 3` points. Since `n=3`, this is possible if `n_{12}=3`. This gives **two non-singular rational curves connected at three distinct points**. This type is stable. (Type 7)\n    *   **Possibility B**: Both components are singular (`n_{11} \\ge 1, n_{22} \\ge 1`). Let `n_{11}=1` and `n_{22}=1`. Then to have `n=3`, we must have `n_{12}=1`. This gives **two rational curves, each with one node, connected to each other at a single point**. This type is stable. (Type 8)\n    *   (Other configurations, e.g., one component singular and the other non-singular, can be shown to be unstable).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze cases `k >= 3`**\nUsing the genus and stability formulas, one can show that no stable curves of genus 2 exist with 3 or more components. For instance, for `k=3` with all components being rational (`g_i=0`), the genus formula gives `n=4`. The stability condition requires each non-singular rational component to have at least 3 connections. A careful case-by-case analysis shows that no configuration satisfies both the genus formula and the stability conditions for all components simultaneously.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSumming up all the distinct types found:\n1.  Smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  Irreducible elliptic curve with one node.\n3.  Irreducible rational curve with two nodes.\n4.  Two elliptic curves connected at one point.\n5.  An elliptic curve connected to a rational curve with a node.\n6.  An elliptic curve connected to a non-singular rational curve at two points.\n7.  Two non-singular rational curves connected at three points.\n8.  Two rational curves, each with a node, connected at one point.\n\nThere are 8 different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n\n<<<8>>>"
