    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends with the same leg position it started with.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the ballet step where the configuration of the legs (which foot is in front/back) is identical at the beginning and the end of the movement. Most of these steps start and end in fifth position, so the question is asking which step does not change the feet (e.g., starts with the right foot in front and ends with the right foot in front).\n\n2.  **Analyze Each Option:**\n\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** This is a vertical jump where the legs beat six times. An entrechat with an even number (deux, quatre, six, huit) means the dancer lands on two feet. The six movements involve three changes of the feet in the air.\n            1.  Jump from fifth (right foot front).\n            2.  Legs open slightly and beat with the back leg coming to the front (left foot front).\n            3.  Legs open again and beat back to the original position (right foot front).\n            4.  Legs open a final time and land.\n            The sequence of crossings is: original -> changed -> original.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands back in the *exact same* fifth position they started from (right foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are the same.\n\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:**\n            *   *Échappé*: To escape. The legs jump from a closed position (fifth) to an open one (second).\n            *   *Battu*: Beaten. The legs beat together as they move.\n            *   *Changé*: Changed. This is the key term. It explicitly states that the feet will change their position by the end of the full step. The dancer jumps from fifth to second, and then jumps from second back to fifth, but with the opposite foot now in front.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position with the opposite foot in front (left foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **C. Assemblé:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Typically starts from fifth position (e.g., right foot back).\n        *   **Action:** *Assemblé* means \"to assemble.\" The dancer brushes one foot out to the side, front, or back, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings both legs together (\"assembles\" them) in the air before landing. In a standard *assemblé dessus* (over), the foot that starts in the back (right foot) brushes out and lands in the front.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but the foot that was in the back is now in the front.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** *Glissade* means \"to glide.\" It's a connecting, traveling step. The dancer pliés and glides the front foot (right foot) to the side. Weight is transferred to that foot, and the other foot (left foot) closes in fifth position. The term *derrière* (behind) specifies that the foot that initiates the movement will close *behind* the other foot.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, but the foot that started in front (right foot) is now in the back.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Begins in fifth position (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Action:** This is a complex, decorative step similar to a *pas de chat*, but with a double *rond de jambe* (circular movement of the leg) in the air. Like a *pas de chat*, it is a traveling step that moves from one place to another, and this displacement almost always involves changing which foot is in front.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position, usually with the opposite foot in front.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The starting and ending positions are different.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nAfter reviewing all the options, the only step that, by definition, requires the dancer to land in the same fifth position from which they started is the **Entrechat six**. All even-numbered entrechats (quatre, six, huit) follow this rule, while steps described with terms like *changé*, *dessus*, or *derrière* explicitly indicate a change in the foot position.\n\n<<<A>>>"
