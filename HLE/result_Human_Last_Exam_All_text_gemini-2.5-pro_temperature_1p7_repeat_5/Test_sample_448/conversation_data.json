    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring ones on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Scope of the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"rarest\" noble gas, which means the one with the lowest concentration. The scope is \"all terrestrial matter,\" which includes the Earth's atmosphere, crust, oceans, mantle, and core. The year \"2002\" is specified, but the relative abundances of these gases do not change on such short timescales, so the data from around that period or current data is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Gather Abundance Data for Each Noble Gas**\nThe primary reservoir for most noble gases on Earth is the atmosphere. Let's compare their abundances, primarily starting with the atmosphere, where they are most concentrated (except for Radon).\n\n*   **Argon (Ar):** The most abundant noble gas by far. It makes up about 0.934% (9,340 parts per million, ppm) of Earth's atmosphere.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** The second most abundant. Its atmospheric concentration is about 18.2 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** The third most abundant. Its atmospheric concentration is about 5.2 ppm. It is also produced in the Earth's crust by radioactive decay and can be found trapped in natural gas reserves.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** Much rarer than the previous three. Its atmospheric concentration is about 1.1 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** Significantly rarer than Krypton. Its atmospheric concentration is about 0.087 ppm (or 87 parts per billion, ppb). It is a stable element.\n*   **Radon (Rn):** This is the crucial candidate for the rarest gas.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Special Case of Radon (Rn)**\nRadon is fundamentally different from the other noble gases on this list because it is highly radioactive.\n*   **Radioactivity and Half-Life:** All of Radon's isotopes are unstable. The most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Source:** Radon is not a primordial element from Earth's formation. Instead, it is continuously generated through the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium, which are present in trace amounts throughout the Earth's crust.\n*   **Steady-State Concentration:** Because Radon decays so quickly, it never has a chance to accumulate in significant quantities. The amount of Radon present on Earth at any single moment is a tiny, steady-state amount determined by the balance between its rapid generation rate and its equally rapid decay rate.\n*   **Abundance:** Its average concentration in the atmosphere is infinitesimally small, often measured in atoms per liter or in units of radioactivity (Becquerels per cubic meter). Expressed as a fraction, its abundance is on the order of 1 part in 10^21 (or 10⁻¹⁵ ppm), which is millions of times rarer than Xenon.\n\n**Step 5: Compare the Rarest Candidates and Conclude**\nThe two rarest noble gases are Xenon and Radon.\n*   **Xenon (Xe)** is stable, but its primordial abundance is very low (0.087 ppm in the atmosphere).\n*   **Radon (Rn)** is continuously produced but decays extremely quickly.\n\nEven though Radon is constantly being made, its exceptionally short half-life means its total existing quantity on all of Earth at any given time is minuscule. Its steady-state abundance is many orders of magnitude lower than that of Xenon. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas on Earth. The year 2002 does not alter this fundamental fact of physics and geology.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
