    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Object of Study\nLet $C$ be the category of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity. We need to find what percentage of the objects in $C$ (i.e., isomorphism classes of indecomposable representations) are irreducible.\n\nThe choice of $q$ is crucial. When $q$ is not a root of unity (the generic case), the category of finite-dimensional representations is semisimple, meaning every indecomposable representation is irreducible. In that case, the percentage would be 100%. However, when $q$ is a root of unity, the situation is much more complex.\n\nLet $q = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$, so $l=3$. The algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ can refer to different versions of the quantum group. The full quantum group, often denoted $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, has a representation theory that is of \"wild\" type, meaning a classification of its indecomposable modules is considered an unsolvable problem. It is highly unlikely that the question refers to this algebra, as it would be impossible to calculate a percentage.\n\nA standard and well-studied object is the \"small quantum group\", also denoted $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$, which is a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra. For $l=3$, it is generated by $E, F, K$ with relations $E^3=F^3=0$, $K^3=1$, and the usual quantum Serre relations. This algebra is of \"tame\" representation type, for which a full classification of indecomposable modules is known. We will assume the question refers to this algebra, as it allows for a concrete answer.\n\n### Step 2: Classification of Indecomposable Representations\nThe representation theory of the small quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at $l=3$ is well-understood. The category of its finite-dimensional modules decomposes into a direct sum of subcategories, called blocks. For $l=3$, there are four blocks:\n1.  The principal block, $B_0$.\n2.  Two other blocks, $B_1$ and $B_2$, which are twists of the principal block and thus have the same structure.\n3.  The Steinberg block, $B_{st}$, which has a much simpler structure.\n\nLet's analyze the indecomposable objects in each block.\n\n**The Tame Blocks ($B_0, B_1, B_2$):**\nThe structure of indecomposable modules for the principal block $B_0$ (and its twists) is described by its Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver. This quiver consists of two types of components:\n*   **A non-periodic component:** This component is of type $\\mathbb{Z}A_2$. It contains a countably infinite set of isomorphism classes of indecomposable modules. Let's call them $\\{M_{n,i}\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}, i \\in \\{1,2\\}}$.\n*   **A family of stable tubes:** There is a $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{C})$-family of tubes, denoted $\\{\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda\\}_{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1}$. Each tube $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$ is of rank 1 and consists of a countably infinite set of indecomposable modules $\\{M_{k,\\lambda}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$.\n\n**The Steinberg Block ($B_{st}$):**\nThis block is of finite representation type. It is Morita equivalent to the algebra $\\mathbb{C}[x]/(x^2)$. This algebra has exactly two non-isomorphic indecomposable modules: the simple module $L_3$ (of dimension 3) and its projective cover $P_3$ (of dimension 6).\n\n### Step 3: Classification of Irreducible Representations (Simples)\nNow we identify which of the indecomposable modules are irreducible.\n\n**In the Tame Blocks ($B_0, B_1, B_2$):**\n*   **Non-periodic component:** It is known that the simple modules of dimension less than $l=3$ belong to this component. For the principal block $B_0$, these are the trivial representation $L_1$ (dimension 1) and the representation $L_2$ (dimension 2). So, there are exactly two simple modules in this infinite set of indecomposables.\n*   **Tubes:** For each $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1$, the tube $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$ contains exactly one simple module, which lies at the \"mouth\" of the tube. This is the module $M_{1,\\lambda}$. The modules $M_{k,\\lambda}$ for $k > 1$ are not simple, as they have non-trivial composition series (e.g., $M_{k,\\lambda}$ has length $k$). The simple modules in the tubes are all of dimension $l=3$.\n\nSo, for each of the three tame blocks, the set of irreducible representations consists of 2 discrete modules and a $\\mathbb{P}^1$-family of 3-dimensional modules.\n\n**In the Steinberg Block ($B_{st}$):**\nAs mentioned, this block contains two indecomposables: the simple module $L_3$ and its projective cover $P_3$. Only one of these, $L_3$, is irreducible.\n\n### Step 4: Calculating the Percentage\nThe question asks for the percentage of irreducible objects among all indecomposable objects in the category $C$. Let $\\mathcal{I}$ be the set of isomorphism classes of all indecomposable modules and $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathcal{I}$ be the subset of irreducibles. We want to calculate $|\\mathcal{S}| / |\\mathcal{I}|$.\n\nLet's summarize our findings:\n*   **Total Indecomposables:**\n    *   From the three tame blocks: 3 countable sets from the non-periodic components, and 3 distinct $\\mathbb{P}^1$-families of countable sets from the tubes.\n    *   From the Steinberg block: 2 modules.\n    The total set of indecomposables is the union of a countable set and an uncountable set parametrized by $(\\{0,1,2\\} \\times \\mathbb{P}^1) \\times \\mathbb{N}$.\n\n*   **Total Irreducibles:**\n    *   From the three tame blocks: $3 \\times 2 = 6$ modules from the non-periodic components, and 3 distinct $\\mathbb{P}^1$-families of simple modules from the tubes.\n    *   From the Steinberg block: 1 module.\n    The total set of irreducibles is the union of a finite set (7 modules) and an uncountable set parametrized by $(\\{0,1,2\\} \\times \\mathbb{P}^1) \\times \\{1\\}$.\n\nSince we are dealing with infinite sets, we cannot simply divide the cardinalities. The concept of \"percentage\" in this context is best interpreted as a density on the parameter space of the representations.\n\nThe vast majority of indecomposable modules belong to the continuous families of tubes. The discrete set of modules from the non-periodic components and the Steinberg block is countable and thus negligible compared to the uncountable families from the tubes. So we can focus our analysis on the tubes.\n\nLet's consider one of the tame blocks. The indecomposable modules in the tubes are parametrized by $(\\lambda, k) \\in \\mathbb{P}^1 \\times \\mathbb{N}$. The irreducible modules among them are parametrized by $(\\lambda, 1)$ where $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1$.\n\nTo find a percentage, let's fix a family corresponding to a parameter $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{P}^1$. The indecomposable modules in this family (the tube $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$) are $\\{M_{k,\\lambda} \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$. The only irreducible module is $M_{1,\\lambda}$.\nTo find the percentage of irreducibles within this family, we can use the concept of natural density. Let's count the number of modules up to complexity $K$ (given by the index $k$). There are $K$ such modules: $\\{M_{1,\\lambda}, ..., M_{K,\\lambda}\\}$. Among these, only one is irreducible ($M_{1,\\lambda}$).\nThe percentage is the limit:\n$$ \\lim_{K \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\text{Number of irreducibles with index } \\le K}{\\text{Number of indecomposables with index } \\le K} = \\lim_{K \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{K} = 0 $$\nThis result holds for any tube $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$ in any of the three tame blocks. Since the countable parts of the module category are negligible in comparison, the overall percentage will also be 0. The small finite contribution from the Steinberg block (1 simple out of 2 indecomposables) gets washed out when considering the totality of representations.\n\nTherefore, an overwhelming majority of indecomposable representations are not irreducible. The percentage of irreducible objects is zero."
