    "This problem asks us to transform a given discrete-time system into its observer canonical form using the principle of duality. The final goal is to determine the new output matrix, which we will call `C_o`.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Principle of Duality**\n\nThe core idea of duality in control systems is that the observability of a system `(A, C)` is equivalent to the controllability of its dual system `(A^T, C^T)`.\n\nTherefore, to transform a system `(A, C)` into its observer canonical form, we can follow these steps:\n1.  Form the dual system `(A_d, B_d) = (A^T, C^T)`.\n2.  Find the transformation that converts this dual system into controller canonical form `(A_cc, B_cc)`.\n3.  Use the dual of this transformation to find the observer canonical form `(A_o, C_o)` of the original system. Specifically, `A_o = A_cc^T` and `C_o = B_cc^T`.\n\n**Step 2: Address the Multi-Output Nature of the System**\n\nThe given system has a matrix `C` with two rows, meaning it's a multi-output system.\n`C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\nCanonical forms are strictly defined for single-input, single-output (SISO) systems. To proceed, we must select one of the output rows from `C` that makes the pair `(A, c_i)` observable. Let's choose the first row `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** We must verify that the pair `(A, c_1)` is observable. We do this by checking the rank of the observability matrix `O = [c_1^T, A^T c_1^T, (A^T)^2 c_1^T]^T`.\n    *   `c_1 = [0, 1, 0]`\n    *   `c_1 A = [0, 1, 0] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [2, 1, 1]`\n    *   `c_1 A^2 = [2, 1, 1] * [1, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 0, 2, 0] = [4, 5, 1]`\n    *   `O = [0, 1, 0; 2, 1, 1; 4, 5, 1]`. The determinant is `det(O) = -1 * (2*1 - 1*4) = 2`.\n    *   Since `det(O) != 0`, the system is observable with this output. We will proceed using `c = [0, 1, 0]`.\n\n**Step 3: Form the Dual System**\n\nThe dual system `(A_d, B_d)` is formed from `A` and our chosen `c`.\n*   `A_d = A^T = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0]`\n*   `B_d = c^T = [0; 1; 0]`\n\n**Step 4: Find the Transformation to Controller Canonical Form**\n\nWe need to find a transformation matrix `T` such that `z_c = T^{-1}z` transforms the dual system into controller canonical form. The transformation matrix `T` can be constructed using the formula `T = M * W`, where `M` is the controllability matrix of the dual system and `W` is a matrix built from the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.\n\n1.  **Characteristic Polynomial:** `p(s) = det(sI - A)`.\n    `det([s-1, -1, 0; -2, s-1, -1; 0, -2, s])`\n    `= (s-1)(s(s-1) - 2) + 1(-2s) = (s-1)(s^2-s-2) - 2s`\n    `= s^3 - s^2 - 2s - s^2 + s + 2 - 2s = s^3 - 2s^2 - 3s + 2`\n    The coefficients are `a_1 = -2`, `a_2 = -3`, `a_3 = 2`.\n\n2.  **Controllability Matrix `M`:** `M = [B_d, A_d B_d, A_d^2 B_d]`.\n    *   `A_d B_d = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [0; 1; 0] = [2; 1; 1]`\n    *   `A_d^2 B_d = A_d * [2; 1; 1] = [1, 2, 0; 1, 1, 2; 0, 1, 0] * [2; 1; 1] = [4; 5; 1]`\n    *   `M = [0, 2, 4; 1, 1, 5; 0, 1, 1]`\n\n3.  **Matrix `W`:** `W = [1, a_1, a_2; 0, 1, a_1; 0, 0, 1]`.\n    *   `W = [1, -2, -3; 0, 1, -2; 0, 0, 1]`\n\n4.  **Transformation Matrix `T`:** `T = M * W`.\n    *   `T = [0, 2, 4; 1, 1, 5; 0, 1, 1] * [1, -2, -3; 0, 1, -2; 0, 0, 1] = [0, 2, 0; 1, -1, 0; 0, 1, -1]`\n\n**Step 5: Find the Transformation Matrix for the Original System**\n\nThe state transformation for the original system is `x_o = Px`. The duality principle states that this `P` is related to the dual system's transformation `T`. The correct relationship is `P = T^T`.\nTherefore, the inverse transformation is `x = P^{-1} x_o`, where `P^{-1} = (T^T)^{-1} = (T^{-1})^T`.\n\nFirst, find `T^{-1}`:\n*   `det(T) = 0 - 2(-1-0) + 0 = 2`.\n*   `adj(T) = [1, 2, 0; 1, 0, 0; 1, 0, -2]`\n*   `T^{-1} = (1/2) * [1, 2, 0; 1, 0, 0; 1, 0, -2] = [0.5, 1, 0; 0.5, 0, 0; 0.5, 0, -1]`\n\nNow, find `P^{-1}`:\n*   `P^{-1} = (T^{-1})^T = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]`\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the New Output Matrix `C_o`**\n\nThe new output `y(k)` is related to the new state `x_o(k)` by `y(k) = C_o x_o(k)`.\nThe relationship is `y(k) = C x(k) = C (P^{-1} x_o(k))`, which means `C_o = C P^{-1}`.\nWe use the original full `C` matrix here.\n\n*   `C = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0]`\n*   `P^{-1} = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]`\n*   `C_o = [0, 1, 0; 1, 1, 0] * [0.5, 0.5, 0.5; 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, -1]`\n\nLet's compute the product:\n*   Row 1: `[0*0.5 + 1*1 + 0*0, 0*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*0, 0*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*(-1)] = [1, 0, 0]`\n*   Row 2: `[1*0.5 + 1*1 + 0*0, 1*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*0, 1*0.5 + 1*0 + 0*(-1)] = [1.5, 0.5, 0.5]`\n\nSo, the new output matrix `C_o` is:\n`C_o = [1, 0, 0; 1.5, 0.5, 0.5]`\n\n*   **Final Sanity Check:** The first row of `C_o` corresponds to the single output `c = [0, 1, 0]` that we used to build the transformation. It becomes `[1, 0, 0]`. This is one of the standard forms for an output vector in observer canonical form (the other common form is `[0, 0, 1]`). This confirms our chosen methodology is consistent.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe value of the new matrix C is:\n`C_o = [1, 0, 0; 1.5, 0.5, 0.5]`\n\n<<<[1, 0, 0; 1.5, 0.5, 0.5]>>>"
