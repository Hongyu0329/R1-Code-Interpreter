    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the source of the quotes and the context.**\nThe question attributes the quotes to Andrei Voznesensky, a famous 20th-century Russian poet. This strongly suggests the subject is a person of significance in Russian or Soviet history or culture. The quotes themselves are poetic and metaphorical.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first quote: \"a joy-discovering sailor\".**\n*   \"Sailor\" points to an explorer, traveler, or someone associated with a sea voyage.\n*   \"Joy-discovering\" is a poetic phrase. It could imply the discovery of new lands, new love, or new possibilities that bring joy, rather than a literal discovery of an emotion. This hints at a figure with a romantic or ambitious story.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second quote and the subsequent clue: \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" and \"The answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\"**\n*   This is the most critical part of the question. It tells us three key things about the person:\n    1.  He was a real person who died and was buried.\n    2.  For a long time, the location of his grave was completely unknown.\n    3.  His burial place was rediscovered or identified in the late 1980s.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues and connect them to Voznesensky's work.**\n*   We are looking for a historical Russian figure, likely an explorer, whose long-lost grave was found in the late 1980s.\n*   The quotes are from Andrei Voznesensky's most famous work, the libretto for the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\" (\"Юнона и Авось\").\n*   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the real-life historical figure, Count Nikolai Petrovich Rezanov.\n\n**Step 5: Verify if Nikolai Rezanov fits all the points.**\n*   **\"joy-discovering sailor\"**: Rezanov was a Russian nobleman and one of the founders of the Russian-American Company. He commanded a major expedition to Russian Alaska and then sailed to California on the ship *Juno* (the opera also mentions the *Avos*). His story involves a famous romance with the daughter of the Spanish commandant of San Francisco. This combination of exploration, diplomacy, and tragic romance makes the poetic description \"joy-discovering sailor\" highly appropriate.\n*   **\"Where is your grave...?\"**: Rezanov died in 1807 in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning to St. Petersburg. He was buried there, but the cathedral and cemetery where he was interred were destroyed during the Soviet era, and the precise location of his grave was lost for many decades.\n*   **\"The answer... emerged in the late 1980s\"**: Spurred by the immense popularity of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\" a public campaign began in the late 1980s (during the period of Glasnost) to locate and commemorate Rezanov's resting place in Krasnoyarsk. In 1989, a memorial service was held, and later, a monument (a cenotaph in the form of a white cross) was erected at the presumed burial site. Thus, the \"answer\" to the question of his grave's location indeed \"emerged\" at that specific time.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll clues point directly to Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
