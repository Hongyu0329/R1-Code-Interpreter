    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, has a standard presentation. For an order of 512, we have $512 = 2^9$, so we are considering $G = SD_{512}$ with $n=9$.\n\nThe presentation is given by:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{2^{n-1}} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^{-1 + 2^{n-2}} \\rangle$\n\nFor $n=9$:\n$G = \\langle a, b \\mid a^{256} = 1, b^2 = 1, bab^{-1} = a^{-1 + 128} = a^{127} \\rangle$\n\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $a^i$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$) or $a^i b$ (for $0 \\le i < 256$).\nThe subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ is a cyclic subgroup of order 256.\n\n**Step 2: Understand Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a **power subgroup** if there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is the subgroup generated by all the $k$-th powers of elements of $G$. This is denoted as:\n$H = G_k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$\n\nWe need to find how many distinct subgroups of $G$ can be formed in this way for different values of $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the $k$-th powers of elements in $G$**\n\nWe consider two types of elements in $G$:\n\n1.  Elements of the form $g = a^i$:\n    $g^k = (a^i)^k = a^{ik}$. These elements are all within the subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$.\n\n2.  Elements of the form $g = a^j b$:\n    To find $(a^j b)^k$, we first compute the square:\n    $(a^j b)^2 = a^j (b a^j b) = a^j (b a^j b^{-1}) = a^j (bab^{-1})^j = a^j (a^{127})^j = a^j a^{127j} = a^{128j}$.\n    The calculation of $(a^j b)^k$ depends on whether $k$ is even or odd.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the structure of $G_k$ based on the parity of $k$**\n\n**Case 1: $k$ is odd**\nThe order of our group is $|G| = 512 = 2^9$. If $k$ is odd, then $\\gcd(k, |G|) = 1$. For any finite group, if the exponent $k$ is coprime to the group order, the mapping $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection on the group. This means the set of $k$-th powers $\\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is identical to the set of elements of $G$.\nTherefore, $G_k = \\langle G \\rangle = G$.\nAll odd values of $k$ produce the same power subgroup, which is $G$ itself. This gives us one power subgroup.\n\n**Case 2: $k$ is even**\nLet $k = 2m$ for some integer $m$. Let's compute the $k$-th powers:\n*   For $g = a^i$: $g^k = a^{ik}$. This is in $\\langle a \\rangle$.\n*   For $g = a^j b$: $g^k = (a^j b)^{2m} = ((a^j b)^2)^m = (a^{128j})^m = a^{128jm}$. This is also in $\\langle a \\rangle$.\n\nSince the $k$-th power of every element $g \\in G$ is in the subgroup $\\langle a \\rangle$ when $k$ is even, the subgroup $G_k$ generated by these powers must also be a subgroup of $\\langle a \\rangle$.\n\nNow, we must identify exactly which subgroup of $\\langle a \\rangle$ is generated.\n$G_k = \\langle \\{a^{ik} \\mid 0 \\le i < 256\\} \\cup \\{a^{128jm} \\mid 0 \\le j < 256\\} \\rangle$.\nThis is a subgroup of the cyclic group $\\langle a \\rangle$, so it must be of the form $\\langle a^d \\rangle$ for some divisor $d$ of 256. The exponent $d$ is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the exponents generated.\n$d = \\gcd(\\gcd_{i}\\{ik\\}, \\gcd_{j}\\{128jm\\}) \\pmod{256}$\nThis simplifies to:\n$d = \\gcd(\\gcd(k, 256), \\gcd(128m, 256))$\nSince $k=2m$, we have $128m = 64k$. So:\n$d = \\gcd(\\gcd(k, 256), \\gcd(64k, 256)) = \\gcd(k, 64k, 256)$\nAs $\\gcd(k, 64k) = k$, the expression becomes:\n$d = \\gcd(k, 256)$.\n\nSo, for any even integer $k$, the power subgroup is $G_k = \\langle a^{\\gcd(k, 256)} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the distinct power subgroups**\n\nWe now need to count how many unique subgroups this formula produces.\nThe subgroup is determined by the value $d = \\gcd(k, 256)$, where $k$ must be an even integer.\n\n*   The number $d$ must be a divisor of 256.\n*   Since $k$ is even, $k=2m$. So $d = \\gcd(2m, 256)$ must be divisible by $\\gcd(2, 256) = 2$. Therefore, $d$ must be an even divisor of 256.\n\nLet's list the divisors of $256 = 2^8$:\n$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n\nThe even divisors are:\n$2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256$.\n\nThere are 8 such even divisors. Each of these values of $d$ gives rise to a distinct subgroup of $\\langle a \\rangle$:\n1.  $\\langle a^2 \\rangle$ (order 128)\n2.  $\\langle a^4 \\rangle$ (order 64)\n3.  $\\langle a^8 \\rangle$ (order 32)\n4.  $\\langle a^{16} \\rangle$ (order 16)\n5.  $\\langle a^{32} \\rangle$ (order 8)\n6.  $\\langle a^{64} \\rangle$ (order 4)\n7.  $\\langle a^{128} \\rangle$ (order 2)\n8.  $\\langle a^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (the trivial subgroup, order 1)\n\nFor each such even divisor $d$, we can find an even $k$ that produces it. For example, we can simply choose $k=d$. This confirms that all these 8 subgroups are indeed power subgroups.\n\n**Step 6: Final Count**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups of $G=SD_{512}$ consists of:\n1.  The group $G$ itself (from any odd $k$).\n2.  The 8 distinct subgroups of $\\langle a \\rangle$ listed above (from even values of $k$).\n\nThese two sets are disjoint. So, the total number of power subgroups is $1 + 8 = 9$."
