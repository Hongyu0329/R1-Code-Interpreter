    "This problem asks for the equilibrium values of entropy and mean energy for a gas of light quanta (photons) using the framework of large deviation theory (specifically, the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems).\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n#### Part 1: Conceptual Framework with Large Deviation Theory\n\n1.  **Boltzmann-Sanov Principle**: This principle provides a link between thermodynamics and large deviation theory. The fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics is that the probability of a macrostate is proportional to the number of its corresponding microstates, `Ω`. The entropy is defined as `S = k_B log(Ω)`. Large deviation theory states that the probability of a macroscopic observable deviating from its mean value decays exponentially, `P(A) ≈ exp[-N * I(A)]`, where `I(A)` is the rate function. Comparing these, we see that maximizing entropy `S` to find the equilibrium state is equivalent to finding the state that minimizes the large deviation rate function `I`. The equilibrium state is the most probable one.\n\n2.  **Cramer-Chernoff / Gärtner-Ellis Framework**: This framework provides the mathematical tools to calculate the rate function and, by extension, the thermodynamic potentials. The rate function for an observable (like energy density `u`) is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), `λ(β)`. In statistical physics, the SCGF is identified with the thermodynamic free energy per unit volume (or per particle).\n\n3.  **Thermodynamic Relations**: From this framework, we can derive the equilibrium values. The SCGF is defined as `λ_V(β) = (1/V) log Z(β)`, where `Z(β)` is the partition function and `β = 1/(k_B T)`. The equilibrium mean energy density `u` and entropy density `s` are given by:\n    *   Mean Energy Density: `u = -d(λ_V(β))/dβ`\n    *   Entropy Density: `s = k_B (λ_V(β) - β * d(λ_V(β))/dβ) = k_B(λ_V(β) + βu)`\n\n#### Part 2: Calculation for the Photon Gas\n\n1.  **System Properties**: Light quanta (photons) are bosons whose total number is not conserved. This implies that their chemical potential `μ` is zero.\n\n2.  **Partition Function**: For a Bose gas with `μ=0`, the logarithm of the partition function `Z` is a sum over all single-particle energy states `ε_i`:\n    `log Z = - Σ_i log(1 - exp(-β ε_i))`\n    We convert this sum to an integral using the density of states `g(ε)`. For photons in a 3D volume `V`, including two polarization states, the density of states is:\n    `g(ε) = (V ε^2) / (π^2 (ħc)^3)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant and `c` is the speed of light.\n    `log Z = - ∫_0^∞ g(ε) log(1 - e^(-βε)) dε = - (V / (π^2(ħc)^3)) ∫_0^∞ ε^2 log(1 - e^(-βε)) dε`\n\n3.  **Evaluating the Integral**: We solve the integral using integration by parts, which transforms it into a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function `ζ(4)` and the Gamma function `Γ(4)`.\n    `∫_0^∞ (x^3 / (e^x - 1)) dx = Γ(4)ζ(4) = 6 * (π^4 / 90) = π^4 / 15`\n    The final result for the partition function is:\n    `log Z = V * (π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3)) = V * (π^2 (k_B T)^3 / (45 (ħc)^3))`\n\n4.  **Scaled Cumulant Generating Function (SCGF)**: We find `λ_V(β)` by dividing `log Z` by the volume `V`:\n    `λ_V(β) = (1/V) log Z = π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3)`\n\n#### Part 3: Equilibrium Values\n\n1.  **Equilibrium Mean Energy**: We find the mean energy density `u` by differentiating the SCGF with respect to `β`:\n    `u = - d(λ_V)/dβ = - d/dβ [π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3)]`\n    `u = - [π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3)] * (-3 / β^4) = π^2 / (15 (ħc)^3 β^4)`\n    Substituting `β = 1/(k_B T)`, we get the Stefan-Boltzmann law for energy density:\n    `u(T) = (π^2 (k_B T)^4) / (15 (ħc)^3)`\n\n2.  **Equilibrium Entropy**: We find the entropy density `s` using its relation to `λ_V(β)` and `u`:\n    `s = k_B(λ_V(β) + βu)`\n    `s = k_B [ (π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3)) + β * (π^2 / (15 (ħc)^3 β^4)) ]`\n    `s = k_B [ (π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3)) + (3π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3)) ]`\n    `s = k_B * [ 4π^2 / (45 (ħc)^3 β^3) ]`\n    Substituting `β = 1/(k_B T)`:\n    `s(T) = (4π^2 k_B^4 T^3) / (45 (ħc)^3) = (4π^2 k_B / 45) * (k_B T / (ħc))^3`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe equilibrium values for the mean energy density (`u`) and entropy density (`s`) for a gas of light quanta (photons) at a temperature `T` are:\n\n**Equilibrium Mean Energy Density:**\n`u(T) = (π^2 (k_B T)^4) / (15 (ħc)^3)`\n\n**Equilibrium Entropy Density:**\n`s(T) = (4π^2 k_B / 45) * (k_B T / (ħc))^3`\n\nwhere:\n*   `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant\n*   `T` is the absolute temperature\n*   `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant\n*   `c` is the speed of light"
