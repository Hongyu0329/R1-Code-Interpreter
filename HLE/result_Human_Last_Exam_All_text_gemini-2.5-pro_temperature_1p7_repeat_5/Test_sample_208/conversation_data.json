    "This problem belongs to a class of mathematical problems known as \"circle packing problems.\" Specifically, we are looking for the densest packing of 14 equal circles in a larger circle. The goal is to find the minimum possible radius of the large circle. These problems have been extensively studied, and for `n=14`, the optimal solution is known.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the solution:\n\n**Step 1: Problem Definition**\nWe are given 14 small circles, each with a radius `r = 1`. We need to find the radius `R` of the larger circle that can contain all 14 smaller circles in the tightest possible arrangement. The answer must be given to 4 significant digits.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Established Solution**\nSolving packing problems from first principles is extremely difficult. The optimal arrangements are often non-intuitive and have been discovered through a combination of computational searches and mathematical proofs. For `n=14` circles, the optimal packing configuration was proven by F. Fodor in 2003.\n\n**Step 3: The Formula for the Radius**\nThe optimal arrangement for `n=14` consists of a central group of 4 circles and an outer ring of 10 circles. For this specific configuration, the relationship between the radius of the large circle (`R`) and the radius of the small circles (`r`) is given by the exact formula:\n`R/r = 1 + sqrt(8 + 4√3)`\n\nSince `r = 1`, the formula for the radius `R` becomes:\n`R = 1 + sqrt(8 + 4√3)`\n\n**Step 4: Simplifying the Expression**\nThe expression `sqrt(8 + 4√3)` can be simplified. We try to express the term `8 + 4√3` as a perfect square of the form `(a + b)²`. Let's test this algebraic identity: `(√x + √y)² = x + y + 2√(xy)`.\nWe want to match `x + y + 2√(xy)` with `8 + 4√3 = 8 + 2√12`.\nBy comparing the terms, we can set up a system of equations:\n1.  `x + y = 8`\n2.  `xy = 12`\nSolving these equations (e.g., by finding two numbers that sum to 8 and have a product of 12), we find that `x=6` and `y=2`.\nTherefore, `8 + 4√3 = (√6 + √2)²`.\nSo, `sqrt(8 + 4√3) = sqrt((√6 + √2)²) = √6 + √2`.\n\nThe simplified formula for the radius `R` is:\n`R = 1 + √6 + √2`\n\n**Step 5: Numerical Calculation**\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of `R` using the approximate values for `√6` and `√2`.\n*   `√6 ≈ 2.4494897`\n*   `√2 ≈ 1.4142136`\n\nSubstitute these values into the formula for `R`:\n`R ≈ 1 + 2.4494897 + 1.4142136`\n`R ≈ 4.8637033`\n\n**Step 6: Rounding to 4 Significant Digits**\nThe question requires the answer to be stated with 4 significant digits.\nThe calculated value is `4.8637033`.\nThe first four significant digits are 4, 8, 6, and 3.\nThe fifth significant digit is 7. Since this digit is 5 or greater, we must round up the fourth significant digit.\nSo, the digit 3 is rounded up to 4.\n\nThe final answer is `4.864`.\n\n<<<4.864>>>"
