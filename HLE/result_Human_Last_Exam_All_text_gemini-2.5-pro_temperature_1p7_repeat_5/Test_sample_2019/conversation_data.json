    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid.\n*   **Toroidal:** The board wraps around on its edges. If a queen moves off one edge, it reappears on the opposite edge. We can represent the squares by coordinates `(r, c)` where `r` and `c` are integers from 0 to 4. All arithmetic involving coordinates will be modulo 5.\n*   **Queens:** We need to place 4 queens.\n*   **Non-attacking:** No two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Attack Constraints\nLet the positions of the four queens be `(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3), (r4, c4)`. For the queens to be non-attacking, the following four conditions must be met:\n1.  **Distinct Rows:** The row coordinates `r1, r2, r3, r4` must all be distinct.\n2.  **Distinct Columns:** The column coordinates `c1, c2, c3, c4` must all be distinct.\n3.  **Distinct Main Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, main diagonals are lines where `r - c` is constant (mod 5). Thus, the values `(r1-c1)`, `(r2-c2)`, `(r3-c3)`, `(r4-c4)` must all be distinct (mod 5).\n4.  **Distinct Anti-Diagonals:** On a toroidal board, anti-diagonals are lines where `r + c` is constant (mod 5). Thus, the values `(r1+c1)`, `(r2+c2)`, `(r3+c3)`, `(r4+c4)` must all be distinct (mod 5).\n\n### Step 3: Method of Enumeration by Construction\nWe will count the number of valid configurations by placing the queens one by one and leveraging the symmetries of the toroidal board. This is a combinatorial approach. Let `N` be the final number of ways.\n\n1.  **Placing the First Queen (Q1):**\n    A toroidal board is highly symmetric. Every square is equivalent to every other square (the board is vertex-transitive). We can place the first queen on any of the 25 squares and rotate/translate the board so it's at a fixed position, say `(0,0)`, without loss of generality. We multiply by 25 at the end to account for all possible starting positions.\n    *   Number of choices for Q1's position: 25.\n    *   Let's fix Q1 at `(0,0)`.\n\n2.  **Placing the Second Queen (Q2):**\n    Q1 at `(0,0)` attacks all squares `(r,c)` where:\n    *   `r = 0` (4 other squares)\n    *   `c = 0` (4 other squares)\n    *   `r - c = 0 mod 5` (i.e., `r=c`: `(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)`) (4 other squares)\n    *   `r + c = 0 mod 5` (i.e., `r=-c`: `(1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1)`) (4 other squares)\n    The total number of squares attacked by Q1 is `1 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17`.\n    This leaves `25 - 17 = 8` squares available for Q2. These 8 squares are `(1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,4), (3,1), (3,4), (4,2), (4,3)`.\n    Crucially, due to the symmetries of the board that fix `(0,0)` (rotations and reflections), these 8 squares are all equivalent. We can place Q2 on any of them, say `(1,2)`, without loss of generality.\n    *   Number of choices for Q2 given Q1: 8.\n\n3.  **Placing the Third (Q3) and Fourth (Q4) Queens:**\n    With Q1 at `(0,0)` and Q2 at `(1,2)`, we need to find positions for Q3 and Q4. A square `(r,c)` is available if it's not attacked by Q1 or Q2.\n    *   Attacked rows by Q1, Q2: `r=0, r=1`.\n    *   Attacked columns by Q1, Q2: `c=0, c=2`.\n    *   Attacked main diagonals by Q1, Q2: `r-c = 0`, `r-c = 1-2 = -1 = 4`.\n    *   Attacked anti-diagonals by Q1, Q2: `r+c = 0`, `r+c = 1+2 = 3`.\n\n    We search for available squares `(r,c)`:\n    *   `r` cannot be 0 or 1.\n    *   `c` cannot be 0 or 2.\n    *   `r-c` cannot be 0 or 4.\n    *   `r+c` cannot be 0 or 3.\n    Checking the remaining possible squares:\n    *   `(2,1)`: `r+c=3` (attacked).\n    *   `(2,3)`: `r+c=0` (attacked).\n    *   `(2,4)`: `r+c=1`, `r-c=-2=3`. **Available.** Let's call this `A`.\n    *   `(3,1)`: `r+c=4`, `r-c=2`. **Available.** Let's call this `B`.\n    *   `(3,3)`: `r-c=0` (attacked).\n    *   `(3,4)`: `r-c=-1=4` (attacked).\n    *   `(4,1)`: `r+c=0` (attacked).\n    *   `(4,3)`: `r+c=2`, `r-c=1`. **Available.** Let's call this `C`.\n    *   `(4,4)`: `r-c=0` (attacked).\n    So, there are 3 possible locations for Q3 and Q4: `A=(2,4)`, `B=(3,1)`, and `C=(4,3)`.\n    We need to choose two of these three squares. Let's check if they attack each other.\n    *   A vs B: `(2,4)` and `(3,1)`. Rows {2,3}, cols {4,1}, `r-c` {-2,2}, `r+c` {6,4}. No conflicts.\n    *   A vs C: `(2,4)` and `(4,3)`. Rows {2,4}, cols {4,3}, `r-c` {-2,1}, `r+c` {6,7}. No conflicts.\n    *   B vs C: `(3,1)` and `(4,3)`. Rows {3,4}, cols {1,3}, `r-c` {2,1}, `r+c` {4,7}. No conflicts.\n    Any pair of these three squares is non-attacking. The number of ways to choose the set `{Q3, Q4}` is `C(3,2) = 3`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Calculation\nWe can now calculate the total number of unique sets of 4 queens.\n\nLet `N` be the number of solutions (unordered sets of 4 queens). We can count the number of ordered pairs of queens `(q1, q2)` that belong to a solution set in two ways.\n\n**Method 1: Building up from queens**\n1.  Number of ways to choose an ordered pair of non-attacking queens `(q1, q2)`:\n    *   25 choices for `q1`.\n    *   8 choices for `q2` (given `q1`).\n    *   Total ordered pairs = `25 * 8 = 200`.\n2.  For each such ordered pair, we found there are 3 ways to choose the remaining set of two queens `{q3, q4}` to complete a solution.\n3.  This gives a total count of `200 * 3 = 600` for structures of the form `(q1, q2, {q3, q4})`, where `{q1, q2, q3, q4}` is a solution.\n\n**Method 2: Deconstructing a solution**\n1.  Let `N` be the total number of solution sets.\n2.  Each solution set `S = {q1, q2, q3, q4}` contains `P(4, 2) = 12` ordered pairs of queens.\n3.  Each solution set `S` can be uniquely described by any one of its 12 ordered pairs `(qi, qj)` and the remaining pair `{qk, ql}`.\n4.  Therefore, the total count from Method 1 is equal to `12 * N`.\n\n**Equating the two methods:**\n`12 * N = 600`\n`N = 600 / 12`\n`N = 50`\n\nThus, there are 50 distinct ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n\n<<<50>>>"
