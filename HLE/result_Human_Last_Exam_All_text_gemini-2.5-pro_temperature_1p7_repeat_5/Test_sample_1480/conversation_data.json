    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the \"rule activation level\" in the context of an Interval Type-3 (IT3) fuzzy system. We are given three key pieces of information:\n    *   The firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7`.\n    *   The membership value of a point in the consequent fuzzy set: `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    *   The operation to be used: a t-norm.\n\n2.  **Understand the Components:**\n    *   **Fuzzy Rule:** A typical fuzzy rule has an \"IF\" part (antecedent) and a \"THEN\" part (consequent). For example: `IF input is A THEN output is B`.\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Strength `Phi_k(x′)`:** This value (`0.7`) represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule is satisfied by a given input `x'`. This is often referred to as the \"rule firing strength\" or \"rule activation level\".\n    *   **Consequent Membership `μG_k_j(y_j)`:** This value (`0.9`) represents the degree of membership of a specific point `y_j` in the original fuzzy set `G_k_j` used in the consequent (the \"THEN\" part) of the rule.\n    *   **T-norm Operation:** A t-norm is a function that models a fuzzy logical AND. It is used to combine fuzzy values. In the process of fuzzy inference (specifically Mamdani-style inference), a t-norm is used to apply the antecedent's firing strength to the consequent's fuzzy set. This step determines the output fuzzy set for that specific rule.\n\n3.  **Interpret the Goal:**\n    The question's phrasing \"What is the rule activation level... using a t-norm operation\" is slightly ambiguous. While \"rule activation level\" often refers solely to the antecedent firing strength (`0.7`), the instruction to \"use a t-norm operation\" with both given values implies that we need to perform a calculation. This calculation is the core of the fuzzy implication step: combining the antecedent's truth value with the consequent's membership function. The result of this operation is the membership grade in the \"fired\" or \"activated\" consequent set. This is the most logical interpretation that uses all provided information.\n\n4.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    The goal is to calculate the result of the implication operation for the specific point `y_j`.\n    *   Activated Consequent Membership = `t-norm(Antecedent Firing Strength, Original Consequent Membership)`\n    *   Activated Consequent Membership = `t-norm(Phi_k(x′), μG_k_j(y_j))`\n    *   Activated Consequent Membership = `t-norm(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Choice of T-Norm:** The question specifies a \"t-norm\" but not *which* one (e.g., minimum, product, Lukasiewicz). In the absence of specific instructions, the most standard and widely used t-norm for this step in fuzzy inference is the **minimum** operator. We will proceed with this common convention.\n    *   Minimum T-norm: `t-norm(a, b) = min(a, b)`\n    *   Product T-norm (another common choice): `t-norm(a, b) = a * b`\n*   **Complexity of Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Sets:** The mention of \"Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set\" seems to be contextual information that is not directly needed for the calculation. The problem provides crisp numerical values (`0.7` and `0.9`) rather than intervals or Type-2 fuzzy sets. This simplifies the problem significantly, suggesting that we are either dealing with a highly simplified scenario or calculating the value at a specific alpha-cut plane where the fuzzy memberships resolve to crisp numbers. The core calculation remains the application of a t-norm to the given crisp values.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n*   **Step 1:** Identify the inputs for the t-norm operation.\n    *   Input 1 (Antecedent Firing Strength): `0.7`\n    *   Input 2 (Consequent Membership): `0.9`\n*   **Step 2:** Assume the standard `minimum` t-norm for the fuzzy implication operation.\n    *   `Operation = min(Input 1, Input 2)`\n*   **Step 3:** Calculate the result.\n    *   `Result = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   `Result = 0.7`\n\nThe result of the t-norm operation, which represents the membership level in the fired consequent set, is 0.7.\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
