    "To answer the question of how many members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans to date, we need to carefully define what constitutes a \"member\" and consult the most current and authoritative scientific databases.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Question and Key Terms**\n*   **\"let-7 family\":** This is a group of small non-coding RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) that share a similar \"seed sequence,\" which determines which messenger RNAs they can target and regulate.\n*   **\"members\":** This term can be ambiguous. It could refer to:\n    1.  The unique mature miRNA sequences (e.g., let-7a, let-7b are distinct members).\n    2.  The precursor genes that encode these miRNAs. Sometimes, one mature miRNA can be produced from multiple different genes.\n    In miRNA biology, \"member of a family\" almost always refers to the distinct mature miRNA sequence. We will proceed with this definition.\n*   **\"in humans\":** The analysis is specific to *Homo sapiens*.\n*   **\"To date\":** This requires using the most recent information from established biological databases.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the \"Canonical\" let-7 Family Members**\nHistorically and in most literature, the let-7 family is described as a core group of highly conserved miRNAs. These are:\n1.  let-7a\n2.  let-7b\n3.  let-7c\n4.  let-7d\n5.  let-7e\n6.  let-7f\n7.  let-7g\n8.  let-7i\n\nThis list contains 8 members.\n\n**Step 3: Include Closely Related and Widely Accepted Members**\nScientific consensus has long included **miR-98** as a member of the let-7 family. It shares the same seed sequence and functional properties as the other let-7 miRNAs. Adding miR-98 to the list brings the total to **9 members**.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Distinguishing Members from Genes**\nIt is crucial not to confuse the number of mature members with the number of genes. Some members are encoded by multiple genes located at different places in the human genome.\n*   let-7a is encoded by 3 genes (let-7a-1, let-7a-2, let-7a-3).\n*   let-7f is encoded by 2 genes (let-7f-1, let-7f-2).\n*   The other 7 members (let-7b, c, d, e, g, i, and miR-98) are each encoded by a single gene.\nCounting the genes for these 9 members gives a total of 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **12 genes**. Many scientific articles cite this number, referring to the number of gene loci, which can cause confusion. The question asks for members, not genes.\n\n**Step 4: Consult the Authoritative Database for the Most Current Data**\nThe primary and official repository for miRNA sequences and annotation is **miRBase**. To get the most up-to-date answer, we must check its classification. miRBase groups miRNAs into families based on seed sequence similarity.\n*   The miRBase database (release 22.1) lists additional human miRNAs in the let-7 family (Family ID: MIPF0000002) beyond the 9 canonical members.\n*   These additional members are:\n    10. miR-202\n    11. miR-4458\n    12. miR-4500\n\n**Careful Point 2: The Evolving Definition of a Family**\nAs sequencing and bioinformatics analysis improve, miRNA family definitions can be expanded. While most functional studies focus on the core 9 members, the official classification \"to date\" includes these additional sequence-related miRNAs.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion and Calculation**\nBased on the most current and comprehensive classification from the authoritative database, miRBase, we sum the canonical and newly identified members:\n*   8 original let-7 members (a, b, c, d, e, f, g, i)\n*   +1 widely accepted member (miR-98)\n*   +3 additional members from database classification (miR-202, miR-4458, miR-4500)\n\nTotal = 8 + 1 + 3 = 12.\n\nTherefore, to date, 12 unique mature miRNA members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\n\n<<<12>>>"
