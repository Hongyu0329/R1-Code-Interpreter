    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The user is asking for a specific year in which an individual named \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan\" publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Individuals Involved:** The question appears to merge the names of two distinct and famous Nigerian leaders:\n    *   **Goodluck Ebele Jonathan:** The former President of Nigeria (2010-2015). His full, officially recognized name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    *   **Nnamdi Azikiwe:** A key figure in Nigeria's independence movement and the first President of Nigeria (1963-1966). His surname is Azikiwe.\n\n3.  **Verify the Name:** The name presented in the question, \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan,\" is factually incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan's middle name is \"Ebele,\" not \"Azikiwe.\" \"Azikiwe\" is the surname of Nnamdi Azikiwe. There is no public figure with the combined name \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\"\n\n4.  **Investigate the Core Premise:** The fundamental premise of the question is that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, at some point, added the name \"Azikiwe\" to his own and identified himself with it publicly.\n\n5.  **Fact-Checking and Verification:** A thorough search of public records, official government documents, news archives, and biographical information for Goodluck Jonathan is necessary.\n    *   **Official Records:** All official records, from his time as Deputy Governor, Governor, Vice President, and President, consistently use the name Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    *   **Public Statements:** There are no recorded instances, speeches, or public declarations where he referred to himself as \"Azikiwe\" or \"Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan.\"\n    *   **Biographical Data:** His official and academic biographies do not contain the name \"Azikiwe.\"\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Misinformation/Conflation:** The question is based on a common type of error where facts or identities of different public figures are mistakenly merged.\n*   **Absence of Evidence:** The challenge is not to find a date but to confirm that the event never occurred. The conclusion must be based on the complete lack of any credible evidence supporting the claim.\n*   **Clarity of Names:** It is crucial to be precise about the full names of both individuals (Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe) to highlight the error in the question's premise.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on the evidence, the event described in the question—Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe—never happened. He has never officially or unofficially used \"Azikiwe\" as part of his name. Therefore, it is impossible to provide a year for an event that did not take place.\n\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This is because \"Azikiwe\" is not part of his name; his full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The question likely conflates him with Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. Therefore, such an event has never occurred.>>>"
