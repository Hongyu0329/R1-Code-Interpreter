There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. This is because "Azikiwe" is not part of his name; his full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The question likely conflates him with Nnamdi Azikiwe, Nigeria's first president. Therefore, such an event has never occurred.
