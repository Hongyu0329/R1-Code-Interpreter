    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific Christian theologian who meets several criteria:\n1.  **Is a Christian theologian:** The figure must be a key thinker within the Christian tradition.\n2.  **Was the *first* to do this:** The question implies a historical priority. We are looking for the origin of a particular conceptual framework.\n3.  **Developed *specialized terminology*:** The theologian didn't just have a vague idea but created a specific vocabulary or set of terms to explain the concept.\n4.  **The terminology describes *changes in the laws of nature*:** The concepts must address how the regular, observable patterns of the natural world (its \"laws\") can be altered or superseded.\n5.  **This framework is applicable to two specific cases:**\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a miracle that bypasses normal biological processes).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural law at the Fall of Man (the idea that the sin of Adam and Eve had cosmic consequences, changing the functioning of the natural world itself).\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\nWe can consider several major figures in the history of Christian thought.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (13th century):** Aquinas had a highly developed system of primary and secondary causation and defined a miracle as something happening outside the order of created nature. While he could explain the virgin birth, and he addressed the consequences of the Fall, he is significantly later than other potential candidates. Therefore, he likely was not the *first*.\n*   **The Reformers (e.g., John Calvin, 16th century):** The Reformed tradition strongly emphasizes the cosmic effects of the Fall. However, the Reformers heavily relied on and built upon the work of earlier theologians, especially the one we will identify below. They refined and reapplied earlier concepts rather than being the first to invent them.\n*   **Modern Theologians (20th century onwards):** Figures like Karl Barth or Wolfhart Pannenberg have engaged with science and miracles, but they are far too recent to be the *first* to develop such a framework.\n\nThis process of elimination points towards the early church, specifically to a figure whose work was foundational for nearly all subsequent Western theology.\n\n**Step 3: Identifying the Correct Theologian and his Terminology**\nThe theologian who best fits all the criteria is **Augustine of Hippo** (354–430 AD).\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Augustine's \"Specialized Terminology\"**\n    Augustine developed a sophisticated framework to understand God's relationship with the natural world. He did not believe that miracles were \"unnatural\" or \"against nature\" in an absolute sense, because God is the author of all nature. Instead, he made a crucial distinction using specific Latin terms:\n    *   ***Cursus naturae*** (the \"course of nature\"): This refers to the regular, observable, and customary way that the world works, the chain of cause and effect we see every day.\n    *   ***Rationes seminales*** (or *rationes causales*; \"seminal reasons\" or \"causal reasons\"): Augustine proposed that at creation, God embedded hidden potentialities or latent causal principles within the fabric of the universe. These are not active in the *cursus naturae* but can be brought forth by God's will at a specific time.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Application to the Virgin Birth**\n    Using this framework, Augustine explained that the virgin birth was not *contra naturam* (against nature), but rather ***contra consuetudinem naturae*** (against the *custom* of nature). He argued that God, in creating humanity, embedded the *ratio seminalis* for a birth without a male seed. This potential was always part of God's created order but was only actualized at the specific time of Christ's incarnation. The event did not break God's law; it fulfilled a deeper, hidden aspect of it.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Application to Alterations at the Fall**\n    Augustine's system is also directly applicable to the idea that the natural world itself was altered by the Fall. Before the Fall, the *cursus naturae* for humanity and the world was different—for example, humans were not subject to death, and childbirth was not painful. After the Fall, as a result of sin and judgment, God instituted a new *cursus naturae*. The natural world became subject to \"futility\" and corruption (a concept Augustine drew from Romans 8:20-22), and humanity's physical existence was fundamentally changed. Thorns, thistles, pain, and death became part of the new \"normal\" or the new set of laws governing the fallen world. His framework allows for a constitutional shift in how nature operates as part of redemptive history.\n\n**Step 4: Final Conclusion**\nAugustine of Hippo was the first major Christian theologian to develop a specific, technical vocabulary (*rationes seminales*, *cursus naturae*) that could systematically describe apparent \"changes in the laws of nature.\" His system was robust enough to provide a coherent explanation for both unique miracles like the virgin birth and for a fundamental shift in the functioning of the natural order as a consequence of the Fall.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
