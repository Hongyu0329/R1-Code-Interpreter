    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the structure of the functions and the integral.\n\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   F₀(x) = x\n*   F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)\n*   F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))\n*   F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n\nWe need to evaluate the definite integral:\nV = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1.\n\n### Step 2: Recognize the form of the integrand.\n\nThe integrand is of the form `f'(x) / f(x)`. This is a standard integral form. Let `u = f(x)`, then `du = f'(x) dx`. The integral of `(1/u) du` is `ln|u|`.\nTherefore, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x) / F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.\n\nThe definite integral is evaluated by finding the difference of the antiderivative at the upper and lower limits of integration.\nV = ∫ [from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = [ln|F₃(x)|] from 0 to 1\nV = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate F₃(x) at the limits x=1 and x=0.\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0\n    *   F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1\n    *   F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   F₁(1) = sin(1) (Note: the argument of sine is in radians)\n    *   F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))\n    *   F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\n\n### Step 5: Check the sign of F₃(x) on the interval [0, 1].\n\nFor `x` in the interval [0, 1], `sin(x)` is non-negative (`sin(0) = 0` and `sin(1)` is positive).\n*   `e^(sin(x))` will be greater than or equal to `e⁰ = 1`.\n*   `1 + e^(sin(x))` will be greater than or equal to `2`.\n*   Therefore, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` will be greater than or equal to `ln(2)`.\nSince `ln(2)` is positive, `F₃(x)` is positive for all `x` in [0, 1]. This means we can drop the absolute value signs: `|F₃(x)| = F₃(x)`.\n\n### Step 6: Substitute the values back into the integral expression.\n\nV = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))\n\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we get:\nV = ln [ (ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) / ln(2) ]\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the numerical value of V.\n\nWe need to use a calculator for this part.\n*   sin(1) ≈ 0.84147098\n*   e^(sin(1)) ≈ e^(0.84147098) ≈ 2.319772\n*   1 + e^(sin(1)) ≈ 3.319772\n*   ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) ≈ ln(3.319772) ≈ 1.200156 (This is F₃(1))\n*   ln(2) ≈ 0.693147 (This is F₃(0))\n*   V ≈ ln(1.200156 / 0.693147)\n*   V ≈ ln(1.73145)\n*   V ≈ 0.54898\n\n### Step 8: Calculate the final requested value.\n\nThe question asks for the closest integer to 10000 * V.\n*   10000 * V ≈ 10000 * 0.54898 = 5489.8\n*   The closest integer to 5489.8 is 5490.\n\n<<<5490>>>"
