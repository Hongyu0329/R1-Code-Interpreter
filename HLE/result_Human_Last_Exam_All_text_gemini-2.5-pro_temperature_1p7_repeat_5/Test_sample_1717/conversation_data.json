    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n1.  **NPC:** Eye of Cthulhu\n2.  **Game Mode:** Expert Mode\n3.  **Condition:** An infinite number of players\n4.  **Objective:** Find the theoretical maximum health.\n\nThis requires us to find the game's formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health in Expert Mode and analyze how it behaves as the player count approaches infinity.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Base Health**\nFirst, we must establish the starting health value before any multiplayer scaling is applied. According to the Terraria source code (`Terraria.NPC.SetDefaults`), the Eye of Cthulhu's health is specifically defined for each difficulty.\n*   In Classic Mode, its base health is 2,800.\n*   In **Expert Mode**, its base health for a single player is **3,640**.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Multiplayer Health Scaling Formula**\nNext, we need the formula the game uses to increase boss health based on the number of players. In Expert Mode, boss health scales with each player after the first. The formula is:\n*   `Total Health = BaseExpertHealth * HealthMultiplier`\n*   The `HealthMultiplier` is calculated as: `1 + (0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))`\n\nThis means that for every player added to the game after the first, the boss's total health increases by 35% of its base Expert Mode health.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate the Complete Health Equation**\nLet `H` be the total health and `P` be the number of players. We can combine the values from the previous steps into a single equation:\n*   `H(P) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35 * (P - 1))`\n\nLet's simplify this algebraic expression:\n*   `H(P) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35P - 0.35)`\n*   `H(P) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35P)`\n*   `H(P) = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35P)`\n*   `H(P) = 2366 + 1274P`\n\nThis final simplified equation, `H(P) = 1274P + 2366`, shows that the Eye of Cthulhu's health is a linear function of the number of players.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the Limit for an Infinite Number of Players**\nThe question asks for the \"theoretical maximum\" given an \"infinite number of players\". This is a mathematical limit problem where we evaluate the function `H(P)` as `P` approaches infinity (`P → ∞`).\n*   `lim (P → ∞) [1274P + 2366]`\n\nAs the number of players (`P`) increases towards infinity, the term `1274P` also increases towards infinity. The constant `2366` becomes insignificant in comparison. Because the function is linear with a positive slope, it has no upper bound.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the function `H(P)` as `P` approaches infinity is infinity.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Mode-Specific Values:** It is critical to use the values for Expert Mode. Classic Mode has no health scaling, and Master Mode has different base health, though it shares the same scaling percentage as Expert.\n2.  **Theoretical vs. Implemented:** The question asks for the *theoretical* maximum. In the actual game, health is stored as a 32-bit integer, which has a maximum value of 2,147,483,647. The game would either crash or bug out long before an infinite number of players is reached. However, the theoretical value is based on the formula itself, which has no such cap.\n3.  **Scaling Per Player:** The scaling factor of 35% applies to the base health, not the cumulatively scaled health. The `(P - 1)` term is also crucial, as scaling only begins with the second player. Our derived formula correctly accounts for this.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is a linear function of the number of players (`P`), represented by the formula `H(P) = 1274P + 2366`. As `P` approaches infinity, this function grows without any bound. Thus, the theoretical maximum health is infinite.\n\n<<<Infinity>>>"
