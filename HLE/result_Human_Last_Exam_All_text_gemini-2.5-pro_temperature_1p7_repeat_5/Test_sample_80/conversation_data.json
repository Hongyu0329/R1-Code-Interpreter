    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify and count the edge squares.**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has squares arranged in 8 rows (ranks) and 8 columns (files). The edge squares are those on the first and last rank (rank 1 and rank 8) and the first and last file (file 'a' and file 'h').\n\n*   **Rank 1:** 8 squares\n*   **Rank 8:** 8 squares\n*   **File 'a':** 8 squares\n*   **File 'h':** 8 squares\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The four corner squares (a1, h1, a8, h8) are part of both a rank and a file. Adding 8+8+8+8 = 32 would double-count these corners.\n*   **Calculation:** The correct number of edge squares is (8 + 8 + 8 + 8) - 4 = **28 edge squares**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the bishop's movement and constraints.**\nA bishop moves and attacks along diagonals. The key constraint is that bishops cannot be placed on squares where they can attack each other.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2:** A bishop always stays on squares of the same color. A bishop on a light-colored square can only attack other pieces on light-colored squares. A bishop on a dark-colored square can only attack other pieces on dark-colored squares. This means we can solve the problem for the light squares and the dark squares independently.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the edge squares by color.**\nThe edge of a chessboard consists of alternating light and dark squares.\n\n*   **Calculation:** With 28 total edge squares, there must be an equal number of light and dark squares.\n    *   **14 light edge squares**\n    *   **14 dark edge squares**\n\n**Step 4: Maximize bishops on one color (e.g., dark squares).**\nWe need to place as many bishops as possible on the 14 dark edge squares without any of them attacking each other. The dark edge squares are: a1, c1, e1, g1, a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8, h8, h6, h4, h2.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3:** Bishops attack each other if they lie on the same diagonal. Let's try placing bishops to maximize their number. A simple and effective strategy is to place bishops along one edge.\n*   **Placement Strategy:** Let's place bishops on all the dark squares on the 'a' file and 'h' file.\n    *   Dark squares on file 'a': a1, a3, a5, a7\n    *   Dark squares on file 'h': h2, h4, h6, h8\n*   **Check for Attacks:** Does a bishop on `a1` attack any on the 'h' file? No. Does `a3` attack any? No. A bishop on file 'a' can only attack a bishop on file 'h' if they are on a long diagonal (e.g., a1 and h8).\n*   **Analysis:**\n    *   The squares `a1` and `h8` are on the same diagonal. We can only place one bishop between them. Let's place it on `a1`.\n    *   The squares `a3` and `h6` are not on the same diagonal.\n    *   Let's reconsider. The squares on the first rank `a1, c1, e1, g1` do not attack each other. Placing bishops here is a good start.\n    *   If we place bishops on `a1, c1, e1, g1`, they attack `h8, h6, h4, h2` respectively.\n    *   This leaves the other dark edge squares: `a3, a5, a7, b8, d8, f8`. Do these attack each other or the bishops we already placed?\n        *   `a3` attacks `c1` (already placed) and `f8`.\n        *   So, we cannot place a bishop on `a3` if `c1` is occupied.\n*   **A simpler method:** The 14 dark edge squares can be partitioned into 7 pairs, where the two squares in each pair lie on the same diagonal. For instance, `a1` and `h8` are on the same diagonal. `c1` and `a3` are on the same anti-diagonal.\n    *   From each such pair, you can only place one bishop.\n    *   Since there are 7 such pairs that cover all 14 dark edge squares, you can place a maximum of **7 bishops** on the dark squares.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize bishops on the other color (light squares).**\nThe situation for the 14 light edge squares is perfectly symmetrical to the dark ones. Therefore, you can also place a maximum of **7 bishops** on the light squares.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of bishops and empty squares.**\n*   Maximum bishops on dark squares = 7\n*   Maximum bishops on light squares = 7\n*   Since dark-square bishops and light-square bishops cannot attack each other, the total maximum number of bishops is 7 + 7 = **14 bishops**.\n\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that would *lack* bishops.\n\n*   Total edge squares = 28\n*   Total bishops placed = 14\n*   Edge squares lacking bishops = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe total number of edge squares is 28. The problem can be separated by color. There are 14 light edge squares and 14 dark edge squares. On each set of 14 squares, a maximum of 7 non-attacking bishops can be placed. Therefore, a total of 7 (light) + 7 (dark) = 14 bishops can be placed on the edge. The number of edge squares that lack bishops is the total number of edge squares minus the number of squares with bishops, which is 28 - 14 = 14.\n\n<<<14>>>"
