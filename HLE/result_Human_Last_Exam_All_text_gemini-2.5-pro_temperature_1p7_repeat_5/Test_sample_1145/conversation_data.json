    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the probability of the particle's location.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the Physical System:**\n    The problem describes a particle in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a 1D box.\" The box has a length `a` and extends from `x = 0` to `x = a`. The particle is in the `n = 2` quantum state, which is the first excited state.\n\n2.  **Recall the Wave Function and Probability Density:**\n    The normalized wave function for a particle in a 1D box for a given quantum number `n` is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`\n    The probability density, which gives the probability per unit length of finding the particle at a position `x`, is the square of the magnitude of the wave function:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_n(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(nπx/a)`\n\n3.  **Specify for the n = 2 State:**\n    For the given state `n = 2`, the probability density is:\n    `P(x) = |ψ_2(x)|^2 = (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a)`\n\n4.  **Set up the Probability Integral:**\n    The probability of finding the particle within a specific interval, from `x_1` to `x_2`, is calculated by integrating the probability density over that interval.\n    The interval is given as `x_1 = 0.495a` to `x_2 = 0.505a`.\n    So, the probability `P` is:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin^2(2πx/a) dx`\n\n5.  **Analyze the Interval and Choose an Approximation Method:**\n    The interval width is `Δx = x_2 - x_1 = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a`. This is a very small interval (1% of the box length).\n    The center of the interval is `x_c = (0.495a + 0.505a) / 2 = 0.5a`.\n    For the `n = 2` state, the point `x = 0.5a` is a node, which means the wave function and the probability density are exactly zero at this point (`sin(2π(0.5a)/a) = sin(π) = 0`).\n    Since the interval is small, we can approximate the probability by assuming the probability density function `P(x)` can be approximated by its Taylor series expansion around the center of the interval, `x = 0.5a`.\n\n6.  **Perform a Taylor Expansion and Approximation:**\n    Let's change variables to simplify the process. Let `u = x - 0.5a`, which means `x = u + 0.5a`. The new integration limits for `u` are from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n    Substitute this into the integrand:\n    `(2/a) * sin^2(2π(u + 0.5a)/a) = (2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a + π)`\n    Using the trigonometric identity `sin(θ + π) = -sin(θ)`, we get `sin^2(θ + π) = sin^2(θ)`. The integrand becomes:\n    `(2/a) * sin^2(2πu/a)`\n    For small values of `u` (which is true within our narrow interval), the argument of the sine function `z = 2πu/a` is also small. We can use the small-angle approximation `sin(z) ≈ z`.\n    The integrand is therefore approximated as:\n    `P(u) ≈ (2/a) * (2πu/a)^2 = (8π^2/a^3) * u^2`\n\n7.  **Calculate the Approximated Integral:**\n    Now we integrate this simplified function over the new limits:\n    `P ≈ ∫[from -0.005a to 0.005a] (8π^2/a^3) * u^2 du`\n    The integral of `u^2` is `u^3 / 3`:\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/a^3) * [u^3 / 3]` evaluated from `-0.005a` to `+0.005a`.\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/(3a^3)) * [(0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3]`\n    `P ≈ (8π^2/(3a^3)) * [2 * (0.005a)^3]`\n    `P ≈ (16π^2/(3a^3)) * (0.005)^3 * a^3`\n\n8.  **Compute the Final Numerical Value:**\n    The `a^3` terms cancel out, leaving a dimensionless probability:\n    `P ≈ (16π^2/3) * (0.005)^3`\n    `P ≈ (16π^2/3) * (1.25 * 10^-7)`\n    Using `π^2 ≈ 9.8696`:\n    `P ≈ (16 * 9.8696 / 3) * 1.25 * 10^-7`\n    `P ≈ (157.9136 / 3) * 1.25 * 10^-7`\n    `P ≈ 52.6379 * 1.25 * 10^-7`\n    `P ≈ 65.797 * 10^-7`\n    `P ≈ 6.58 * 10^-6`\n\nThe probability is very small, which is expected since the interval is centered on a node where the particle is never found. The non-zero result is due to the finite width of the interval.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
