    "This problem requires us to find all second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ scalar field theory, calculate their individual symmetry factors, and then sum these factors.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis:\n\n**1. Understand the building blocks of the diagrams**\n\n*   **Theory**: We are working with $\\phi^4$ theory, where the interaction term in the Lagrangian is $\\mathcal{L}_{int} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{4!}\\phi^4$. This means each interaction vertex involves four scalar field lines.\n*   **Order**: \"Second-order\" refers to diagrams that are of order $\\lambda^2$. This means they are constructed with exactly two interaction vertices.\n*   **Diagram type**: \"Vacuum bubble\" diagrams have no external lines. All field lines originating from vertices are connected to other vertices, forming internal lines (propagators). The diagrams must be connected.\n\n**2. Identify all possible diagrams**\n\nA second-order connected vacuum bubble diagram will consist of two vertices, let's call them V1 and V2. Each vertex must have four lines (propagators) connected to it (a degree of 4). The total number of line ends to be connected is $2 \\times 4 = 8$. These must be paired up to form 4 propagators.\n\nWe can systematically find all possible topologies using graph theory. Let a diagram be a multigraph with two vertices, where each vertex has a degree of 4. Let $n_{12}$ be the number of propagators connecting V1 and V2, and $n_{11}$ and $n_{22}$ be the number of propagators forming loops on V1 and V2, respectively. The degree of a vertex is the sum of lines connecting to other vertices plus twice the number of loops on itself.\n\n*   Degree of V1: $2n_{11} + n_{12} = 4$\n*   Degree of V2: $2n_{22} + n_{12} = 4$\n\nFrom these equations, we can see that $2n_{11} = 2n_{22}$, which implies $n_{11} = n_{22}$. Let's find the non-negative integer solutions for $(n_{11}, n_{22}, n_{12})$ that satisfy the equations and represent connected diagrams ($n_{12}>0$).\n\n*   **Case 1**: Let $n_{11} = 0$. This implies $n_{22} = 0$. The equation becomes $n_{12} = 4$. This is a valid connected diagram.\n    *   **Diagram A (\"Melon\" diagram)**: Two vertices connected directly by four propagators.\n\n*   **Case 2**: Let $n_{11} = 1$. This implies $n_{22} = 1$. The equation becomes $2(1) + n_{12} = 4$, which gives $n_{12} = 2$. This is also a valid connected diagram.\n    *   **Diagram B (\"Saturn\" diagram)**: Each vertex has one loop on it, and the two vertices are connected by two propagators.\n\n*   **Case 3**: Let $n_{11} = 2$. This implies $n_{22} = 2$. The equation becomes $2(2) + n_{12} = 4$, which gives $n_{12} = 0$. A diagram with $n_{12}=0$ is disconnected, so it's not a single connected vacuum bubble.\n\nThis exhaustive analysis shows there are only **two** topologically distinct connected vacuum bubble diagrams at second order in $\\phi^4$ theory.\n\n***A careful point***: Many popular QFT textbooks (like Peskin & Schroeder, Ryder, etc.) incorrectly show a third diagram. This diagrammatic error has been noted in errata and academic discussions. A careful analysis, such as the one above (and as found in Weinberg's QFT book), confirms that only two such diagrams exist. We will proceed by analyzing only these two valid diagrams.\n\n**3. Calculate the symmetry factors**\n\nThe symmetry factor, $S$, of a diagram is the order of its automorphism group. In simpler terms, it's the number of ways you can permute the lines and vertices of the diagram without changing its topology.\n\n**Diagram A (\"Melon\" diagram):**\n*   **Symmetry from permuting propagators**: The four propagators connecting V1 and V2 are identical. They can be permuted in $4! = 24$ ways.\n*   **Symmetry from permuting vertices**: The two vertices V1 and V2 are identical. Swapping them leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Total Symmetry Factor for A**: $S_A = (4!) \\times 2 = 24 \\times 2 = 48$.\n\n**Diagram B (\"Saturn\" diagram):**\n*   **Symmetry from permuting connecting propagators**: The two propagators connecting V1 and V2 are identical. They can be swapped. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Symmetry from flipping loops**: Each loop propagator connects a vertex to itself. For a scalar field, flipping the direction of the propagator is a symmetry. This gives a factor of 2 for the loop on V1 and another factor of 2 for the loop on V2. (Total factor of $2 \\times 2 = 4$).\n*   **Symmetry from permuting vertices**: The two vertices are identical in structure (each has one loop and two lines connecting to the other vertex). Swapping V1 and V2 leaves the diagram unchanged. This gives a factor of 2.\n*   **Total Symmetry Factor for B**: $S_B = (\\text{swap connecting lines}) \\times (\\text{flip loop 1}) \\times (\\text{flip loop 2}) \\times (\\text{swap vertices}) = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n**4. Sum the symmetry factors**\n\nThe final step is to sum the symmetry factors for all the identified diagrams.\n\nTotal Symmetry Factor = $S_A + S_B = 48 + 16 = 64$.\n\n<<<64>>>"
