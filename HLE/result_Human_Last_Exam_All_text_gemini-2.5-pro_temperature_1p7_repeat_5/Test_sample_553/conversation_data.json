    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Musical Question**\n\n*   **Artist:** The Beatles. We need to focus solely on their official song catalogue.\n*   **\"Starts with...\"**: This implies the progression happens at the very beginning of the song, as part of the introduction or the first musical phrase.\n*   **\"Tonic\"**: This is the \"home\" chord of the song's key. It's the first degree of the scale, denoted as 'I' in a major key or 'i' in a minor key.\n*   **\"Minor fifth chord\"**: This is the chord built on the fifth degree of the scale, but it must have a minor quality. This is denoted as 'v' (lowercase Roman numeral).\n    *   For example, in the key of A minor, the tonic (i) is an **A minor** chord. The fifth note of the scale is E. The minor fifth chord (v) would be an **E minor** chord.\n    *   For example, in the key of F minor, the tonic (i) is an **F minor** chord. The fifth note is C. The minor fifth chord (v) would be a **C minor** chord.\n*   **\"Chord Jump\"**: This suggests a direct, clear, and immediate transition between these two chords.\n\nSo, we are looking for a Beatles song that begins with a progression of **i -> v** (tonic minor to minor fifth).\n\n**Step 2: Surveying Potential Beatles Songs**\n\nWe need to recall the opening chords of Beatles songs, particularly those in a minor key, as the i -> v progression is a very natural sound in a minor key.\n\n*   **\"Things We Said Today\"**: Starts in A minor, but the progression is Am -> E7. E7 is a major-sounding (dominant) chord, not a minor fifth. So this is not a match.\n*   **\"Eleanor Rigby\"**: The song is in E minor. The opening string part goes from C major to E minor. If E minor is the tonic (i), then C major is the VI chord. This is a VI -> i progression. So this is not a match.\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: This song from *Rubber Soul* has verses in the key of F minor. The song's memorable opening phrase, \"Michelle, ma belle,\" begins with an **F minor** chord (the tonic, i). On the word \"belle,\" the chord changes to a **C minor** chord (the minor fifth, v). This perfectly fits the i -> v progression.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"**: This song from *A Hard Day's Night* is famous for its unusual structure and melancholic opening. The song is in the key of A minor. It begins with a very stark, strummed **A minor** chord (the tonic, i) followed immediately by an **E minor** chord (the minor fifth, v). This progression, Am -> Em, is the song's entire introduction.\n\n**Step 3: Comparing the Candidates and Finalizing the Answer**\n\nBoth \"Michelle\" and \"I'll Be Back\" fit the technical description of starting with a tonic to minor fifth chord progression.\n\n*   **\"Michelle\"**: Starts with Fm -> Cm. This is i -> v.\n*   **\"I'll Be Back\"**: Starts with Am -> Em. This is i -> v.\n\nHowever, the question uses the phrase \"chord jump.\" The opening of **\"I'll Be Back\"** is a very direct, unadorned, and somewhat abrupt change from Am to Em. The two chords are strummed one after the other, making it a perfect example of a \"jump\" that immediately establishes the song's somber mood. In \"Michelle,\" the change from Fm to Cm is part of a smoother, more intricate fingerpicked line with a descending bass. While correct, \"jump\" is a more apt description for the opening of \"I'll Be Back.\" Therefore, \"I'll Be Back\" is considered the best and most precise answer to the question.\n\n<<<I'll Be Back>>>"
