    "This question requires an understanding of the specific techniques of the five International Standard ballroom dances listed. Let's analyze the Reverse Turn in each dance.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Terms:**\n    *   **Reverse Turn:** A standard figure in ballroom dancing where the couple turns to the left (counter-clockwise).\n    *   **Overturn:** To rotate more than the amount prescribed by the official technique for a given figure.\n    *   **Without Disregarding the Technique:** This is the key constraint. It means we must adhere to the fundamental principles of the dance, such as footwork, rise and fall, sway, body contact, and character. We are not asking if it's physically possible to spin more, but if it's possible while still executing the figure correctly according to the dance's unique style and rules.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Each Dance:**\n\n    *   **A. Viennese Waltz:** This dance is characterized by continuous rotation. While a standard Reverse Turn completes one full rotation over 6 steps, it is common and technically acceptable to slightly underturn or overturn the figure for floorcraft (navigating around other couples). The flowing and rotational nature of the dance allows for this flexibility without breaking the fundamental technique.\n\n    *   **B. English Waltz:** The Waltz is a swing dance with rise and fall, sway, and flowing movement. The standard Reverse Turn (steps 1-3) has a prescribed amount of turn (e.g., 3/8). However, dancers frequently alter this amount of rotation for choreography or floorcraft. Turning a bit more is achievable while maintaining the correct CBM (Contra Body Movement), sway, and rise and fall. It does not violate the core principles of the dance.\n\n    *   **D. Slow Foxtrot:** Similar to the Waltz, the Foxtrot is a swing dance characterized by long, gliding movements and continuous flow. The Reverse Turn in Foxtrot also has a standard amount of rotation, but this can be adjusted. The smooth, continuous nature of the dance allows for more or less turn to be executed without violating the core \"long strides\" and \"heel turn\" techniques.\n\n    *   **E. Quickstep:** This is a dynamic and fast swing dance. Its figures, including the Reverse Turn, are often adapted for speed and floorcraft. Dancers can and do adjust the rotation. In fact, figures like the Reverse Pivot are specifically designed for sharp, fast, and significant rotation, often exceeding the turn of a basic Reverse Turn. Flexibility in rotation is part of the dance.\n\n    *   **C. European Tango:** The Tango is fundamentally different from the other four dances. It is a \"staccato\" dance, not a \"swing\" dance. Key technical points include:\n        *   **No Rise and Fall:** The dancers maintain a constant level, moving with bent knees.\n        *   **No Sway:** The body does not sway sideways like in the waltz dances.\n        *   **Staccato Action:** Movements are sharp, quick, and punctuated.\n        *   **Specific Footwork:** The feet are picked up and placed, not glided smoothly.\n\n        Now, consider the Man's steps in a basic Tango Reverse Turn:\n        1.  LF forward\n        2.  RF to side\n        3.  LF closes to RF\n\n        The action for step 2 is a distinct step to the side, and step 3 is a closing of the feet. This \"side-close\" action is fundamental to the character of the Tango. If a dancer attempts to \"overturn\" this figure (i.e., turn significantly more than the prescribed amount), they would be forced to pivot on the standing foot in a way that would introduce rotation where there should be a flat, side step. This would inevitably lead to illegal rise (coming up on the ball of the foot to pivot), sway, and would destroy the staccato character. The very structure and technique of the Tango Reverse Turn, with its precise, non-flowing foot placements, makes it impossible to overturn without breaking these fundamental rules. The technique itself acts as a hard limit on the amount of rotation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn the swing dances (Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), the continuous and flowing technique allows for flexibility in the amount of rotation. In Tango, the staccato, non-swing technique with its specific \"side-close\" action makes overturning the Reverse Turn technically impossible without violating the core principles of the dance.\n\n<<<C>>>"
