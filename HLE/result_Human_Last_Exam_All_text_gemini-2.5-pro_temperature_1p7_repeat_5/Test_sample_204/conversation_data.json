    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe given vector field is `n = (nx, ny, nz)`, where:\n*   `f = atan2(y, x)`\n*   `r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)*(x*x + y*y - 0.5) + z*z)`\n*   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2)`\n*   `nx = sin(G) * cos(f)`\n*   `ny = sin(G) * sin(f)`\n*   `nz = cos(G)`\n\nFirst, let's check that this is a unit vector field.\n`nx² + ny² + nz² = (sin(G)cos(f))² + (sin(G)sin(f))² + (cos(G))² = sin²(G)(cos²(f) + sin²(f)) + cos²(G) = sin²(G) + cos²(G) = 1`.\nSo, `n` is a unit vector field that defines a map from the 3D space R³ to the 2D sphere S².\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that characterizes such maps from a 3-sphere (S³) to a 2-sphere (S²). To apply this concept, we consider R³ to be compactified to S³ by adding a \"point at infinity\". This requires the vector field `n` to approach a constant value as `(x,y,z) -> ∞`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Boundary Conditions of the Field\n\nLet's examine the behavior of `n` at infinity and at the \"core\" of the structure.\n*   **At infinity:** As `x, y,` or `z` go to infinity, `r2` goes to infinity.\n    *   `r2 -> ∞`\n    *   `exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`\n    *   `G = PI * exp(-10 * r2) -> 0`\n    *   `nx = sin(0)cos(f) = 0`\n    *   `ny = sin(0)sin(f) = 0`\n    *   `nz = cos(0) = 1`\n    So, at infinity, `n -> (0, 0, 1)`. This means the entire boundary at infinity of R³ maps to a single point (the North Pole) on S², which makes the map from the compactified R³ (i.e., S³) to S² well-defined.\n\n*   **At the \"core\":** The structure of the field depends on `G`. `G` can range from `0` to a maximum value when `r2` is at its minimum.\n    *   `r2 = sqrt((r² - 0.5)² + z²)`, where `r = sqrt(x² + y²)`.\n    *   `r2` is minimized when `r2 = 0`. This occurs when `z = 0` and `(r² - 0.5)² = 0`, which means `r² = 0.5` or `r = 1/√2`.\n    *   This core is a circle in the `xy`-plane with radius `1/√2`: `x² + y² = 0.5, z = 0`.\n    *   At this core circle, `r2 = 0`, so `G = PI * exp(0) = PI`.\n    *   `nx = sin(PI)cos(f) = 0`\n    *   `ny = sin(PI)sin(f) = 0`\n    *   `nz = cos(PI) = -1`\n    So, all points on the circle `x² + y² = 0.5, z = 0` map to the point `(0, 0, -1)` (the South Pole) on S².\n\n### Step 3: Use the Winding Number Interpretation for the Hopf Charge\n\nFor fields of this specific toroidal structure, the Hopf charge `Q` can be calculated as the product of two integer winding numbers: `Q = m * k`.\n*   `m`: The azimuthal (or toroidal) winding number.\n*   `k`: The poloidal winding number.\n\n**Calculating the azimuthal winding number `m`:**\nThe `(nx, ny)` components are `(sin(G)cos(f), sin(G)sin(f))`. As the physical azimuthal angle `f = atan2(y,x)` goes from `0` to `2π` (circling the `z`-axis), the vector `(nx, ny)` also rotates once around the origin in the `nx-ny` plane. This corresponds to a winding number of `m=1`. If the terms were `cos(mf)` and `sin(mf)`, the winding number would be `m`.\n\n**Calculating the poloidal winding number `k`:**\nThe poloidal winding number `k` describes how the vector field wraps in any plane of constant `f` (a poloidal plane). It is determined by the total variation of the poloidal angle `G` as one moves from the core of the structure to the boundary. A standard definition for `k` in this context is:\n`k = (G_core - G_boundary) / PI`\n\n*   From Step 2, at the core of the hopfion, `G_core = PI`.\n*   From Step 2, at the boundary (infinity), `G_boundary = 0`.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula for `k`:\n`k = (PI - 0) / PI = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Hopf Charge\n\nNow we can compute the total Hopf charge `Q`.\n`Q = m * k = 1 * 1 = 1`\n\n### Step 5: Verification via the Whitehead Formula (Conceptual)\n\nThe Whitehead formula defines the Hopf charge `Q` as the linking number of the preimages of any two distinct regular values on the target sphere S².\n`Q = Lk(preimage(p₁), preimage(p₂))`\n\nLet's test this conceptually.\n*   Choose `p₁ = (0, 0, -1)` (South Pole). As we found, its preimage is the core circle: `C₁: x² + y² = 0.5, z = 0`. Although this is a critical value, its preimage is a simple circle, which is often acceptable for this calculation.\n*   Choose `p₂ = (1, 0, 0)` (a point on the equator). This is a regular value. Its preimage `C₂` is the set of points where `f=0` and `G=π/2`.\n    *   `f=0` means `y=0, x>0`. This restricts the points to the positive `x-z` half-plane.\n    *   `G = π/2` implies `π * exp(-10*r2) = π/2`, which means `exp(-10*r2) = 1/2`, or `r2 = ln(2)/10`. Let this constant be `C_val`.\n    *   The condition is `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = C_val²` in the half-plane `y=0, x>0`.\n    *   This equation describes a curve (in fact, two disjoint loops) in the `x-z` plane. One loop has `x` coordinates smaller than `1/√2` and the other has `x` coordinates larger than `1/√2`.\n*   Let's compute the linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)`. `C₁` is a circle of radius `1/√2` in the `xy`-plane. `C₂` are loops in the `xz`-plane. A curve links `C₁` if it passes through the disk bounded by `C₁`. The inner loop of `C₂` passes through the disk `x²+y² ≤ 0.5, z=0` once. The outer loop of `C₂` does not. Therefore, the linking number is `1` (or `-1` depending on orientation conventions).\n\nThis confirms the result obtained from the winding number product.\n\nFinal Answer: The Hopf charge of the field is 1.\n\n>>>1"
