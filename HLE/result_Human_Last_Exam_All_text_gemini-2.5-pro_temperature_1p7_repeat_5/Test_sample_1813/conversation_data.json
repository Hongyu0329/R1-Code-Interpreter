    "An elegant step-by-step derivation of the solution is provided below.\n***\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n**1. Understanding the Generalized Markov Number**\n\nThe generalized Markov number, denoted as $m_{p/q}$ for a rational number $p/q$, can be defined in several ways, often leading to different values. A common and significant definition, especially in the context of cluster algebras and TeichmÃ¼ller theory, relates $m_{p/q}$ to the continued fraction of the rational number.\n\nFor a rational number $x > 1$ with a simple continued fraction $x = [c_1; c_2, \\dots, c_n]$, the associated matrix $M_x$ is given by the product:\n$$ M_x = \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdots \\begin{pmatrix} c_n & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe entries of this matrix are related to the convergents of the continued fraction. Let $P_k/Q_k = [c_1; c_2, \\dots, c_k]$ be the $k$-th convergent of $x$. Then the matrix $M_x$ is:\n$$ M_x = \\begin{pmatrix} P_n & P_{n-1} \\\\ Q_n & Q_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe generalized Markov number $m_x$ is defined as the trace of this matrix divided by its bottom-left entry:\n$$ m_x = \\frac{\\text{tr}(M_x)}{Q_n} = \\frac{P_n + Q_{n-1}}{Q_n} $$\nFor a rational number $p/q$ in the interval $(0, 1)$, its Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is defined by its reciprocal, i.e., $m_{p/q} = m_{q/p}$. This definition has the advantage of often yielding integer values, which aligns with the classical Markov numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 13, ...).\n\nWe need to compute the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$. Following the definition, we have:\n$$ m_{4/7} = m_{7/4} $$\n\n**2. Computing the Continued Fraction of 7/4**\n\nWe use the Euclidean algorithm to find the continued fraction expansion of $7/4$.\n\\begin{align*} 7 &= 1 \\cdot 4 + 3 \\\\ 4 &= 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\\\ 3 &= 3 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\end{align*}\nThe quotients are $1, 1, 3$. So, the continued fraction is:\n$$ \\frac{7}{4} = [1; 1, 3] $$\nHere, we have $c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3$, so $n=3$.\n\n**3. Computing the Associated Matrix and Markov Number**\n\nNow we compute the matrix $M_{7/4}$ using the coefficients $c_1=1, c_2=1, c_3=3$.\n\\begin{align*} M_{7/4} &= \\begin{pmatrix} c_1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 1 & 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 \\\\ 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 1 & 1 \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 1 & 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 \\\\ 1 \\cdot 3 + 1 \\cdot 1 & 1 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\ &= \\begin{pmatrix} 7 & 2 \\\\ 4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align*}\nFrom this matrix, we can identify $P_3=7, Q_3=4$ and $P_2=2, Q_2=1$.\nThe denominator $Q_3=4$ matches the denominator of $7/4$, which serves as a good check.\n\nThe trace of the matrix is $\\text{tr}(M_{7/4}) = 7 + 1 = 8$.\nThe Markov number is then:\n$$ m_{7/4} = \\frac{\\text{tr}(M_{7/4})}{Q_3} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2 $$\nSo, the generalized Markov number associated with $4/7$ is $m_{4/7}=2$.\nNotably, 2 is one of the classical Markov numbers.\n\n**4. Finding the Continued Fraction of the Markov Number**\n\nThe question asks for the continued fraction associated with $m_{4/7}$. We have found that $m_{4/7}=2$.\nThe continued fraction of an integer $k$ is simply $[k]$.\nTherefore, the continued fraction of 2 is:\n$$ 2 = [2] $$\n\n***\n**Final Answer Analysis:**\nThe core of the problem is to select the appropriate definition of a \"generalized Markov number\" from several available in the literature, which may not be mutually consistent. The chosen definition, $m_{p/q} = m_{q/p} = (P_n+Q_{n-1})/Q_n$, is robust, rooted in the matrix representation of continued fractions, and produces integer results for many simple rationals, including this case.\n1.  **Rational number:** $4/7$.\n2.  **Definition of Markov number:** $m_{4/7} = m_{7/4}$.\n3.  **Continued fraction of the reciprocal:** $7/4 = [1; 1, 3]$.\n4.  **Computation of Markov number:** $m_{7/4} = 2$.\n5.  **Continued fraction of the result:** The continued fraction of $2$ is $[2]$.\n\n>>> [2]"
