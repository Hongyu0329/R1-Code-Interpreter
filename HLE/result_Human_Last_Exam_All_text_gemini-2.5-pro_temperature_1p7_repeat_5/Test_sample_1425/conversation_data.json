    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the System and the Ensemble\n\n1.  **Ensemble:** The system is in the **grand canonical ensemble**. This ensemble describes systems that can exchange both energy and particles with a large reservoir. It is characterized by temperature $T$, volume $V$, and chemical potential $\\mu$.\n2.  **Partition Function (Z):** The grand canonical partition function is defined by the trace over all many-body states:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(\\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N})} \\right]$\n    where $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $\\hat{H}_{sys}$ is the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian operator, and $\\hat{N}$ is the particle number operator.\n3.  **Hamiltonian:** The question states that the system's Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$. This is an unusual definition. The most standard interpretation in this context is that the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian (kinetic + potential energy) is zero ($\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$), and the question provides the operator that appears in the exponent of the density matrix, i.e., the grand canonical Hamiltonian itself is being specified.\n    A more careful interpretation is to assume the question specifies the system's intrinsic Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$. In this case, the grand canonical Hamiltonian operator becomes $\\hat{K} = \\hat{H}_{sys} - \\mu \\hat{N} = 0 - \\mu \\hat{N} = -\\mu\\hat{N}$.\n4.  **Target Calculation:** Therefore, the partition function to calculate is:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{-\\beta(-\\mu \\hat{N})} \\right] = \\text{Tr}\\left[ e^{\\beta\\mu \\hat{N}} \\right]$.\n\n### Step 2: Path Integral Formulation\n\nThe question requires using the path integral formalism.\n\n1.  **Path Integral for Z:** The partition function $Z$ can be expressed as a functional integral over fields. For bosonic particles, we use a complex scalar field $\\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$. The trace operation imposes periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta\\hbar]$. The general form is $Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$.\n2.  **Action (S):** The action in the path integral corresponds to the operator in the exponent. The standard imaginary-time action for a non-interacting bosonic field in the grand canonical ensemble is:\n    $S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\psi^*(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau) (\\hbar \\partial_\\tau + \\hat{h}_{sys} - \\mu) \\psi(\\mathbf{x}, \\tau)$\n    where $\\hat{h}_{sys}$ is the single-particle Hamiltonian operator corresponding to $\\hat{H}_{sys}$.\n3.  **Specific Action:** In our case, $\\hat{H}_{sys} = 0$, which means $\\hat{h}_{sys} = 0$. The action simplifies significantly. For simplicity, and because the Hamiltonian has no spatial dependence, we can consider a zero-dimensional system (a single mode), so the spatial integral disappears. Let's also set $\\hbar=1$.\n    $S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^{\\beta} d\\tau \\, \\psi^*(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi(\\tau)$\n    The fields are subject to periodic boundary conditions: $\\psi(0) = \\psi(\\beta)$.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of the Path Integral\n\nWe evaluate the Gaussian functional integral by decomposing the field into its Fourier modes.\n\n1.  **Fourier (Matsubara) Expansion:** We expand $\\psi(\\tau)$ in a Fourier series consistent with the periodic boundary conditions:\n    $\\psi(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau}$\n    where $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies for integer $n$.\n2.  **Diagonalizing the Action:** Substituting the expansion into the action, the operator $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes a sum over the modes:\n    $S = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_n^* (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\psi_n$\n3.  **Gaussian Integral:** The path integral measure becomes a product of measures for each mode, $\\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] \\propto \\prod_n d\\psi_n^* d\\psi_n$. The partition function is then a product of Gaussian integrals:\n    $Z = \\mathcal{N} \\prod_n \\left( \\int d\\psi_n^* d\\psi_n e^{-\\psi_n^*(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)\\psi_n} \\right)$\n    Using the formula $\\int du^*du \\, e^{-A u^* u} = \\pi/A$, we get:\n    $Z = \\mathcal{N}' \\prod_n \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n - \\mu}$\n    Formally, this is written as $Z \\propto [\\det(\\partial_\\tau - \\mu)]^{-1}$.\n\n### Step 4: Summing the Modes (Regularization)\n\nThe infinite product is divergent and must be regularized. This is standardly done by evaluating the logarithm of the product, which turns it into a sum.\n\n1.  **Logarithm of Z:**\n    $\\ln Z = C - \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n2.  **Matsubara Sum:** This sum can be evaluated using standard complex analysis techniques (contour integration) or by looking up the known result for this type of Matsubara sum. The result is:\n    $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln(E - i\\omega_n) = \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta E}) + \\text{constant}$\n3.  **Applying the Formula:** We set $E = -\\mu$.\n    $\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln(-\\mu - i\\omega_n) = \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta(-\\mu)}) + \\text{constant} = \\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}) + \\text{constant}$\n4.  **Final Result for Z:** Substituting this back into the expression for $\\ln Z$:\n    $\\ln Z = C - (\\ln(1-e^{\\beta\\mu}) + \\text{const}) = -\\ln(1-e^{\\beta\\mu}) + C''$\n    By normalizing (setting the overall constant to 1, which can be confirmed by other methods), we find:\n    $Z = \\frac{1}{1-e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Bosons vs. Fermions:** The use of a complex field $\\psi$ implies we are dealing with bosons. For fermions, we would use Grassmann fields, which would yield $Z = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$.\n*   **Number of Modes:** This calculation was performed for a single bosonic mode (a zero-dimensional system). If the system had $M$ independent, degenerate modes (e.g., spin states), the partition function would be $Z = (1-e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-M}$. Since the problem is generic, the single-mode result is the fundamental building block.\n*   **Condition for Convergence:** For the trace $Z = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (e^{\\beta\\mu})^n$ to converge, the chemical potential must satisfy $|e^{\\beta\\mu}|<1$. Since $\\beta=1/k_B T > 0$, this requires the chemical potential to be negative, $\\mu < 0$. This physical condition prevents the system from being filled with an infinite number of particles, which would be energetically favorable if $\\mu>0$ since the particle energy is zero.\n\nThe final answer is the partition function for a single bosonic mode with zero energy.\n\n<<<Z = 1 / (1 - exp(βμ))>>>"
