    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruction of the Definitions\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms involved in the question.\n\n*   **Group G of order 2q^m**: G is a finite group with |G| = 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m is a natural number (m ≥ 1). We are looking for nonabelian groups of this form.\n*   **Product-free set**: A subset S of G is product-free if for any two elements x, y ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), their product xy is not in S. This can be written as S⋅S ∩ S = ∅. A direct consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot be in any product-free set S, because if e ∈ S, then for any s ∈ S, e⋅s = s, which is in S, violating the condition.\n*   **Maximal product-free set**: A product-free set S is maximal by inclusion if it cannot be extended by adding any element from G \\ S. That is, for any g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is not product-free.\n*   **A set S fills a group G**: A set S fills G if G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}, where S⁻¹ = {s⁻¹ | s ∈ S}. This condition means that for every non-identity element g ∈ G, either g ∈ S or g⁻¹ ∈ S (or both).\n*   **Filled Group**: A group G is called filled if *every* maximal product-free set in G fills G.\n\n### Step 2: Structure of Nonabelian Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nLet G be a group of order |G| = 2q^m. Let P be a Sylow q-subgroup and Q be a Sylow 2-subgroup.\n*   |P| = q^m\n*   |Q| = 2, so Q ≅ C₂.\nBy Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow q-subgroups, n_q, must satisfy n_q | 2 and n_q ≡ 1 (mod q). Since q is an odd prime (q ≥ 3), n_q ≡ 1 (mod q) cannot be satisfied by n_q = 2. Thus, n_q must be 1. This means the Sylow q-subgroup P is a normal subgroup of G.\n\nSince P is normal, G is a semidirect product of P and Q: G = P ⋊ Q ≅ P ⋊_φ C₂. The group G is nonabelian if either:\n1.  P is a nonabelian group.\n2.  P is abelian, but the homomorphism φ: C₂ → Aut(P) is non-trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of the \"Filled\" Condition\n\nTo determine if a group is filled, we must show that *all* its maximal product-free sets fill the group. Conversely, a group is *not* filled if we can find even one maximal product-free set S that does not fill G. A set S does not fill G if there exists a non-identity element g ∈ G such that g ∉ S and g⁻¹ ∉ S.\n\nWe analyze the two cases for the structure of G.\n\n**Case 1: G = P ⋊_φ C₂ where φ is non-trivial.**\nLet C₂ = {e, s}. Since φ is non-trivial, φ(s) is an automorphism of P of order 2.\nConsider the set T = {p⋅s | p ∈ P}. This set consists of all elements in the coset Ps. |T| = |P| = q^m.\n\n*   **Is T product-free?**\n    Let x = p₁s and y = p₂s be any two elements in T. Their product is:\n    xy = (p₁s)(p₂s) = p₁(sp₂s⁻¹)s² = p₁(φ(s)(p₂))e = p₁φ(s)(p₂)\n    Since p₁, φ(s)(p₂) ∈ P, their product is also in P. No element of P is in T (as T = Ps and P ∩ Ps = ∅). So, xy ∉ T. Thus, T is a product-free set.\n\n*   **Is T maximal?**\n    Let's try to add an element g ∈ G \\ T. Since G = P ∪ Ps, g must be an element of P, so g=p' for some p' ∈ P, p'≠e. Let's see if T ∪ {p'} is product-free.\n    Consider the element x = φ(s)((p')⁻¹)s. Since φ(s) is an automorphism of P, (p')⁻¹∈ P implies φ(s)((p')⁻¹) ∈ P, so x ∈ T.\n    Now compute the product of x ∈ T and p' ∈ {p'}:\n    x⋅p' = (φ(s)((p')⁻¹)s) ⋅ p' = φ(s)((p')⁻¹) (sp's⁻¹) s = φ(s)((p')⁻¹) φ(s)(p') s = φ(s)((p')⁻¹p') s = φ(s)(e) s = es = s.\n    The element s is in T (take p=e in ps). So we have found a product x⋅p' that lies in T. This means T ∪ {p'} is not product-free.\n    This holds for any non-identity p' ∈ P. Therefore, T is a maximal product-free set.\n\n*   **Does T fill G?**\n    The set T contains no elements from P other than the identity (which isn't in T). Take any non-identity element g ∈ P. Then g ∉ T. Since P is a q-group with q odd, if g ≠ e, then g⁻¹ ≠ g. Both g and g⁻¹ are in P. Neither g nor g⁻¹ is in T.\n    Therefore, T does not fill G.\n\nConclusion for Case 1: Any nonabelian group of the form P ⋊_φ C₂ with a non-trivial action is not a filled group.\n\n**Case 2: G = P × C₂ where P is nonabelian.**\nThis requires q^m to be the order of a nonabelian q-group, so m ≥ 3. G is a direct product. Let C₂ = {e, s}.\nConsider the set T = P × {s}. |T| = q^m.\n\n*   **Is T product-free?**\n    Let x = (p₁, s) and y = (p₂, s) be in T. Their product is:\n    xy = (p₁, s)(p₂, s) = (p₁p₂, s²) = (p₁p₂, e).\n    This product is in P × {e}, so it is not in T. Thus, T is product-free.\n\n*   **Is T maximal?**\n    Let's add an element g ∈ G \\ T. g must be of the form (p', e) for some p' ∈ P. Let's assume p'≠e.\n    Consider the element x = ((p')⁻¹, s) ∈ T.\n    Now compute the product of x ∈ T and g ∈ {p',e}:\n    x⋅g = ((p')⁻¹, s) ⋅ (p', e) = ((p')⁻¹p', se) = (e, s).\n    The element (e,s) is in T. So T ∪ {g} is not product-free.\n    Thus, T is a maximal product-free set.\n\n*   **Does T fill G?**\n    The set T consists of all elements with a non-identity component in the C₂ factor. It contains no elements from P × {e} (except the identity, which isn't in T). Take any non-identity element g = (p, e) from P × {e}. Then g ∉ T and g⁻¹ = (p⁻¹, e) ∉ T.\n    Therefore, T does not fill G.\n\nConclusion for Case 2: Any nonabelian group of the form P × C₂ where P is nonabelian is not a filled group.\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion and Careful Points\n\nBoth cases cover all possible nonabelian groups of order 2q^m. In every case, we were able to construct a maximal product-free set that does not fill the group. This demonstrates that no such group is a filled group.\n\n**Final Answer**: The set of nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q and natural number m is the empty set. There are no such groups.\n\n**A note on the group S₃**:\nThe literature, specifically the paper \"On filled groups\" by Pálfy and Pudlák (1982), famously states that a finite group is filled if and only if it is an elementary abelian 2-group or the symmetric group S₃. This would imply that for q=3, m=1, the nonabelian group of order 6 (which is isomorphic to S₃) should be a filled group. However, the analysis above applies to S₃ = D₃ ≅ C₃ ⋊ C₂.\nThe set T = {s, rs, r²s} (the set of three reflections/transpositions) is a maximal product-free set in S₃. This set T does not contain the elements of order 3, r and r⁻¹. Therefore, T does not fill S₃. This implies S₃ is not a filled group, contradicting the result in the literature. As the step-by-step analysis based on the fundamental definitions consistently shows that none of the groups in question are filled, the correct conclusion must be that there are no such groups."
