    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of the integral.\n\n**Step 1: Simplify the integrand**\n\nThe integral is given by:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe integrand is an infinite sum, $f(x) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)$. We can simplify this sum. The sum of logarithms is the logarithm of the product of the arguments:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\n**Careful Point 1:** This identity holds provided the product converges. When dealing with logarithms of potentially negative numbers, one must consider the branches of the logarithm. For the principal branch, $\\log(z_1 z_2) = \\log(z_1) + \\log(z_2) \\pmod{2\\pi i}$. However, in this case, the identity holds exactly for the principal value of the logarithm.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the infinite product**\n\nThe infinite product $\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right)$ is a well-known identity. Let's recall its derivation.\nStart with the double-angle formula for sine: $\\sin(x) = 2\\sin(x/2)\\cos(x/2)$.\nWe can write this as $\\cos(x/2) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2\\sin(x/2)}$.\nSimilarly, $\\cos(x/4) = \\frac{\\sin(x/2)}{2\\sin(x/4)}$, and so on.\nFor a finite product, we have:\n\\begin{align*} P_N &= \\prod_{n=1}^{N} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) \\\\ &= \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) \\cdots \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2\\sin(x/2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(x/2)}{2\\sin(x/4)} \\cdots \\frac{\\sin(x/2^{N-1})}{2\\sin(x/2^N)} \\\\ &= \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)}\\end{align*}\nTo find the infinite product, we take the limit as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\nFor the denominator, we use the fundamental limit $\\lim_{t\\to 0} \\frac{\\sin(t)}{t} = 1$. Let $t = x/2^N$. As $N\\to\\infty$, $t\\to 0$.\n$$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} 2^N \\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} x \\frac{\\sin(x/2^N)}{x/2^N} = x \\cdot 1 = x $$\nTherefore, the infinite product is:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^n}\\right) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} $$\n\n**Step 3: Rewrite the integral**\n\nSubstituting the closed form of the product back into the expression for the integrand:\n$$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) $$\nThe original integral now becomes:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\n**Careful Point 2:** We have manipulated the expression inside the integral first. Interchanging the summation and integration is not straightforward, as integrating term by term leads to divergent integrals. So, simplifying the sum first is the correct procedure.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the final integral**\n\nThe integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x$ is a known result in the field of mathematical analysis. This integral is conditionally convergent, much like the famous Dirichlet integral $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\sin x}{x} dx = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Its direct evaluation is non-trivial and often involves methods from complex analysis or other advanced techniques.\n**Careful Point 3:** For the integral to be well-defined, it must be treated as an improper integral. At points $x=k\\pi$ ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$), the term $\\sin x$ is zero, making the argument of the logarithm zero, and the logarithm diverges to $-\\infty$. However, these singularities are integrable. The main issue for convergence is the behavior of the integrand as $x \\to \\infty$. A direct calculation shows that the integral of the absolute value of the integrand, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\left|\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\right| \\mathrm{d}x$, diverges. However, the integral itself converges conditionally due to the oscillating nature of the $\\sin x$ term.\n\nThe value of this integral is a standard result:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n\nTherefore, the value of the original expression is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{-\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$.\n<<<-\\frac{\\pi}{2}>>>"
