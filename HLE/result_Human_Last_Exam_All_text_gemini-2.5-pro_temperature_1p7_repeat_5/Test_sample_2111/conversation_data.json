    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Primary Figure:** Fernand Braudel, a historian known for his emphasis on a global historical perspective and the *longue durée*.\n*   **Secondary Figure:** Paul Morand, whom Braudel quotes.\n*   **The Action:** A \"conceptual entity\" should be \"inscribed within a sphere.\"\n*   **The Clue/Example:** This entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\"\n*   **The Goal:** Identify this \"conceptual entity.\"\n\n**Step 2: Locate the Source of the Quotation**\nThe quotation comes from Fernand Braudel's major work, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. Specifically, it is in the conclusion of the third and final volume, *The Perspective of the World*. This context is crucial, as the book's title itself points towards a global view.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Exact Quotation**\nBraudel writes, \"To be valid, any history of the world must be contained within a sphere, as Paul Morand has said: 'A history of the world must have the globe for its emblem, the sphere within which everything is inscribed'.\"\n\n**Step 4: Identify the \"Conceptual Entity\" from the Text**\nThe quotation explicitly states what should be inscribed within the sphere. Paul Morand is quoted as saying, \"**A history of the world** must have the globe for its emblem, the sphere within which everything is inscribed.\" Therefore, the conceptual entity is \"a history of the world.\"\n\n**Step 5: Connect the Answer to the \"Nation\" Clue**\nThe question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" How does this fit? Braudel's historical method was a direct challenge to traditional historiography, which often focused on the political history of individual nation-states in isolation. For Braudel, the history of a single nation (like France or Spain) is meaningless unless it is \"inscribed within a sphere\"—that is, placed within the larger context of the global economy, long-term environmental factors, and broad social trends that transcend national borders. Thus, the history of a nation is an example of a topic that needs to be put into this larger \"history of the world\" to be properly understood. The entity itself is the complete, global history, not just the history of one of its parts (like a nation).\n\n**Step 6: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nCombining the analysis, the conceptual entity Braudel and Morand refer to is \"a history of the world.\" This concept encapsulates the idea that all historical events and subjects, including individual nations, must be analyzed within a comprehensive global framework, symbolized by a sphere.\n\n<<<a history of the world>>>"
