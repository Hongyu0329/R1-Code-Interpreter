    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximum number of logical qubits.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of Surface Codes and Logical Qubits\n\nA surface code is a type of topological quantum error-correcting code where physical qubits are arranged on a 2D surface. Logical qubits are not stored in individual physical qubits but are encoded non-locally in the topological properties of the surface.\n\nThe number of logical qubits that can be encoded on a given surface depends on its topology, specifically its genus (number of \"handles,\" like in a donut) and the number of boundaries (outer edges or inner \"holes\").\n\n### Step 2: Define \"Patch\" and \"Hole\" in this Context\n\n*   **Patch:** In the context of surface codes, a \"patch\" typically refers to a code laid out on a planar surface. A simple planar surface is topologically equivalent to a disk. It has a genus `g=0`.\n*   **Hole:** A \"hole\" is a puncture or a region of missing qubits within the interior of the patch. Each hole creates a new, distinct boundary on the surface.\n\n### Step 3: Relate the Number of Logical Qubits to the Topology\n\nFor a single, connected surface code patch with genus `g` and `b` distinct boundaries, the number of logical qubits `k` that can be encoded is given by the formula:\n`k = 2g + b - 1`\n\nSince the problem refers to \"patches,\" we assume they are planar, which means their genus `g=0`. Substituting `g=0` into the formula, we get the number of logical qubits for a single planar patch:\n`k = 2(0) + b - 1 = b - 1`\n\nThe number of boundaries `b` on a single patch is the sum of its outer boundary (there is always one) and the number of inner holes `h`.\n`b = 1 + h`\n\nCombining these, we find the number of logical qubits `k` for a single patch with `h` holes:\n`k = (1 + h) - 1 = h`\n\nThis gives us a simple and crucial rule: **For a standard planar surface code patch, the number of logical qubits it can encode is equal to the number of holes it has.**\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the Given System\n\nThe system is described as \"two patches of surface code with two holes.\" This means:\n*   We have two separate, physically disconnected patches (Patch 1 and Patch 2).\n*   The total number of holes to be distributed across these two patches is 2.\n\nSince the patches are separate, the total number of logical qubits (`k_total`) is the sum of the logical qubits on each patch (`k_1` and `k_2`).\n`k_total = k_1 + k_2`\n\nLet `h_1` be the number of holes on Patch 1 and `h_2` be the number of holes on Patch 2. The problem states the total number of holes is 2, so:\n`h_1 + h_2 = 2`\n\nUsing our rule from Step 3 (`k = h` for each patch):\n`k_1 = h_1`\n`k_2 = h_2`\n\nTherefore, the total number of logical qubits is:\n`k_total = h_1 + h_2`\n\nSince we know `h_1 + h_2 = 2`, the total number of logical qubits is:\n`k_total = 2`\n\n### Step 5: Consider All Possible Configurations and Find the Maximum\n\nThe question asks for the *maximum* number of logical qubits. Let's check the possible ways to distribute the two holes and see if the result changes.\n\n*   **Configuration A: Both holes on one patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has `h_1 = 2` holes. Patch 2 has `h_2 = 0` holes.\n    *   Qubits on Patch 1: `k_1 = h_1 = 2`.\n    *   Qubits on Patch 2: `k_2 = h_2 = 0`.\n    *   Total Qubits: `k_total = 2 + 0 = 2`.\n\n*   **Configuration B: One hole on each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has `h_1 = 1` hole. Patch 2 has `h_2 = 1` hole.\n    *   Qubits on Patch 1: `k_1 = h_1 = 1`.\n    *   Qubits on Patch 2: `k_2 = h_2 = 1`.\n    *   Total Qubits: `k_total = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n\nBoth possible configurations for distributing the two holes result in a total of 2 logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 2.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{2}$.\n<<<2>>>"
