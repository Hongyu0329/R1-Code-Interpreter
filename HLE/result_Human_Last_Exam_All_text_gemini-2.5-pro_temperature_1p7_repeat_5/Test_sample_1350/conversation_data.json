    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question requires identifying a character in William Morris's novel *The House of the Wolfings* who meets several specific criteria:\n    *   The character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   The character describes the religious practices or foundation myth of the inhabitants of that city.\n    *   This description must contain elements that a reader would clearly recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus (founders of Rome, suckled by a she-wolf).\n\n2.  **Recall the Novel's Context:** *The House of the Wolfings* is about a tribe of Goths, the Markmen of Mirkwood, specifically the clan of the Wolfings. They are preparing to defend their lands against an invading Roman army. A key theme is the contrast between the Gothic tribal, kin-based society and the Roman city-based, imperial society.\n\n3.  **Scan for a Relevant Scene:** The most logical place for such a description to occur is when the Goths are discussing their enemy, the Romans. This happens early in the book, during a council meeting (the \"Thing\") where the elders and warriors debate how to face the invasion.\n\n4.  **Identify Potential Characters:**\n    *   **Thiodolf:** As the War-Duke and protagonist, he is a primary figure, but his knowledge is mostly focused on leadership and his connection to the magical Hall-Sun. He is not presented as a great traveler or scholar of foreign cultures.\n    *   **The Hall-Sun:** She has supernatural knowledge but her experience is rooted in the magic of the Goths and the forest, not in travels to Roman cities.\n    *   **Tribal Elders:** Characters like Otter or Fox are presented as men of wisdom and experience. One of them would be the most likely candidate to have traveled and gathered intelligence in their youth.\n\n5.  **Pinpoint the Specific Character and Dialogue:** In Chapter III, \"The Council of the Markmen,\" the elders are discussing the nature of the Romans. A character named **Fox** is described as a man who has traveled widely. He rises to speak and shares his firsthand knowledge.\n\n6.  **Analyze Fox's Speech:**\n    *   **Visited a Roman City:** Fox explicitly states that he has been to a Roman city. He describes its strong walls, its wealth, its throngs of people, and how different it is from the Gothic way of life in the wood and dale.\n    *   **Describes Religious Practices (Foundation Myth):** He contrasts the Goths, who descend from a single man (the eponymous Wolf of their clan), with the Romans. He then explains what he learned of the Romans' origins, stating, \"...they hold a She-wolf to be one of their Great Ones, and that she gave suck to the first fathers of their Folk, who were two brethren...\"\n    *   **Recognizable as Romulus and Remus:** The description of a \"She-wolf\" who nursed the \"two brethren\" who were the \"first fathers of their Folk\" is a clear and direct allusion to the Roman foundation myth of Romulus and Remus being suckled by the Capitoline Wolf.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Character Naming:** The character is simply named \"Fox.\" He is sometimes referred to as \"Fox the Wanderer\" due to his history of travel.\n*   **Thematic Irony:** Morris deliberately creates this parallel. The Goths are the \"Wolfings\" (children of the Wolf), and they are fighting the Romans, whose own foundation myth involves a she-wolf. Fox himself remarks on this strange similarity between the two peoples who are about to go to war.\n*   **Source of Information:** The information comes directly from a character who claims firsthand experience, making the intelligence seem authentic within the world of the story.\n*   **Function in the Narrative:** This scene serves to characterize the Romans from the Gothic perspective, establishing them as a powerful but alien civilization, while also hinting at a strange, shared symbolic heritage.\n\n### Conclusion of Analysis\n\nBased on the textual evidence from the council scene in Chapter III, the character who visited a Roman city and described their foundation myth in a way that refers to Romulus and Remus is **Fox**.\n\n<<<Fox>>>"
