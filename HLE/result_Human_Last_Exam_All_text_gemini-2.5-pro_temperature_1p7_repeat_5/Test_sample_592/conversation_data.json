    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the specific US city where the character Tommaso, played by Marco Cocci, moves to in the 1997 Italian film \"Ovosodo\".\n2.  **Recall the character's storyline:** Tommaso is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero. He comes from a wealthy but troubled family. His rebellious nature leads to various conflicts, and eventually, his family decides to send him away to get him out of trouble.\n3.  **Locate the specific scene:** The movie doesn't show Tommaso's life in the United States directly. Instead, his location is revealed to his friend Piero, and thus to the audience, through a piece of mail.\n4.  **Identify the evidence:** Piero receives a postcard from Tommaso after he has moved. This postcard is a key plot device, showing that their friendship continues despite the distance and their diverging paths.\n5.  **Determine the city from the evidence:** The postcard that Tommaso sends to Piero is explicitly from Philadelphia. This is shown visually in the film.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   It is important not to confuse Tommaso with the main character, Piero, who remains in Livorno, Italy for most of the film.\n*   The information is not delivered through dialogue but through a visual cue (the postcard), which can be an easy detail to miss if not paying close attention.\n*   Confirming this detail through plot summaries or film analyses ensures accuracy. Multiple sources confirm that the postcard is from Philadelphia.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nBased on the analysis of the film's plot and the specific scene involving the postcard, the city where Tommaso moves is identified.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
