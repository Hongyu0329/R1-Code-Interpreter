    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem Statement\nLet's break down the given information:\n1.  We have a triangle $A B C$.\n2.  The side length $B C$ is given by a variable $S=S N Y W R$. Let's call this side $a$, so $a = BC = S$.\n3.  The measure of angle $B$ is given as $\\mathrm{m} \\angle B=30^{\\circ}$.\n4.  We are considering different integer values for the side length $A C$. Let's call this side $b$, so $b = AC$.\n5.  We need to find the number of possible integer values for $b$ that result in there being exactly two possible values for the length of side $A B$. Let's call this side $c$, so $c = AB$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Value of S\nThe term $S = SNYWR$ seems to be a placeholder. In the context of such math problems, this often corresponds to a number derived from the letters. A common method is to assign numerical values to letters (A=1, B=2, ...). Let's use this method.\n*   S = 19\n*   N = 14\n*   Y = 25\n*   W = 23\n*   R = 18\n\nAdding these values together: $S = 19 + 14 + 25 + 23 + 18 = 99$.\nSo, we will proceed with $BC = 99$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Geometric Condition\nThe problem describes the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (SSA case), where we are given two sides and a non-included angle ($b, a, \\angle B$). The number of possible triangles depends on the relationship between side $b$ ($AC$) and the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$.\n\nLet $h$ be the altitude from vertex $C$ to the line segment $AB$. In the right triangle formed by the altitude, we have:\n$\\sin(B) = \\frac{h}{BC}$\n$h = BC \\cdot \\sin(B) = S \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ})$\nSubstituting the values $S=99$ and $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 1/2$:\n$h = 99 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 49.5$\n\nFor two possible triangles to exist (and thus two possible lengths for side $AB$), the length of side $AC$ (which is $b$) must be greater than the altitude $h$ but less than the length of the adjacent side $BC$ (which is $S$).\n*   If $b < h$, the side $AC$ is too short to reach the line $AB$, so no triangle can be formed.\n*   If $b = h$, side $AC$ is exactly the length of the altitude, forming a single right-angled triangle.\n*   If $b > S$, side $AC$ is long enough to intersect the line $AB$ at only one point on the ray starting from B, forming a single triangle.\n*   If $b = S$, one of the intersection points is B itself, resulting in a single (isosceles) triangle.\n*   The condition for **two distinct triangles** is $h < b < S$.\n\n### Step 4: Apply the Condition using the Law of Cosines (Alternative Method)\nWe can also analyze the problem using the Law of Cosines. Applying the law to $\\triangle ABC$ with respect to $\\angle B$:\n$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos(B)$\n$AC^2 = BC^2 + AB^2 - 2(BC)(AB) \\cos(30^{\\circ})$\nLet $b=AC$, $a=BC=S=99$, and $c=AB$.\n$b^2 = 99^2 + c^2 - 2(99)(c)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$\n$b^2 = 99^2 + c^2 - 99\\sqrt{3}c$\n\nRearranging this into a quadratic equation for $c$ (the length of side $AB$):\n$c^2 - (99\\sqrt{3})c + (99^2 - b^2) = 0$\n\nFor there to be two possible values for side length $AB$ (which is $c$), this quadratic equation must have two distinct positive real roots.\n1.  **Discriminant > 0**: For two distinct real roots.\n    $\\Delta = ( -99\\sqrt{3} )^2 - 4(1)(99^2 - b^2) > 0$\n    $99^2 \\cdot 3 - 4 \\cdot 99^2 + 4b^2 > 0$\n    $-99^2 + 4b^2 > 0$\n    $4b^2 > 99^2$\n    $b^2 > \\frac{99^2}{4}$\n    $b > \\frac{99}{2} \\implies b > 49.5$ (since $b$ must be positive)\n\n2.  **Product of roots > 0**: To ensure both roots have the same sign.\n    Product = $\\frac{C}{A} = 99^2 - b^2 > 0$\n    $99^2 > b^2$\n    $99 > b$ (since $b$ must be positive)\n\n3.  **Sum of roots > 0**: To ensure the roots are positive.\n    Sum = $-\\frac{B}{A} = 99\\sqrt{3} > 0$. This condition is always met.\n\nCombining the conditions from the discriminant and the product of roots, we get the range for $b$:\n$49.5 < b < 99$\nThis confirms the result from the geometric approach.\n\n### Step 5: Count the Integer Values\nThe question asks for the number of *integer* values of $AC = b$ that satisfy the condition $49.5 < b < 99$.\nThe integers in this range are:\n*   The smallest integer greater than 49.5 is 50.\n*   The largest integer less than 99 is 98.\nSo we need to count the integers from 50 to 98, inclusive.\n\nNumber of integers = (Last Value - First Value) + 1\nNumber of integers = $(98 - 50) + 1 = 48 + 1 = 49$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n*   **Decoding SNYWR:** It's crucial to correctly interpret this placeholder. Assuming it's the sum of the letter positions (A=1, Z=26) is a common convention in these types of problems.\n*   **The Ambiguous Case Condition:** Remember that for two triangles, the side opposite the given angle must be strictly between the altitude and the other given side ($h < b < S$).\n*   **Integer Counting:** Be careful with boundary conditions. The inequality is strict ($<$), not inclusive ($\\le$). When counting integers in an interval $(X, Y)$, the count is `floor(Y-1) - floor(X)` or `(Last Integer - First Integer) + 1`. An off-by-one error is easy to make. Here, the integers are from 50 to 98.\n*   **The Question's Goal:** The question asks for the number of values for $AC$, not the values of $AB$. The condition on $AB$ (having two values) sets up the constraints on $AC$.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the analysis, the condition for two possible triangles is that the length of side $AC$ must be in the interval $(49.5, 99)$. The integer values for $AC$ that satisfy this condition are $50, 51, \\dots, 98$. The number of these integer values is $98 - 50 + 1 = 49$.\n\n<<<49>>>"
