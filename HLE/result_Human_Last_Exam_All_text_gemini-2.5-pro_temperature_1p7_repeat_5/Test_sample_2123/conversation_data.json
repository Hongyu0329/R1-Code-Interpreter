    "This is a classic question based on a famous, possibly apocryphal, anecdote from the world of literary translation into Russian. Let's break down the logic step-by-step to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Clues:**\n    *   **Setting:** The \"wide boulevards of Vienna.\" These are famous for their green, park-like spaces (like the Ringstrasse).\n    *   **Source:** A \"Russian translation\" of an essay. This is the most crucial clue, as it implies the poet's name appears due to a linguistic quirk or error specific to the translation process from English to Russian.\n    *   **The Anomaly:** The \"surname of an English poet\" appears within a description of the scenery or activities. It is highly unlikely that an essay would literally state, \"These boulevards remind me of poet X.\" The name's appearance must be accidental or indirect.\n\n2.  **Considering the Context:**\n    *   What activities might take place on the grassy areas of Vienna's boulevards, especially in the late 19th or early 20th century, when many classic essays were written? A very popular upper-class pastime was the sport of **lawn tennis**.\n\n3.  **The Linguistic Bridge (The Translation Error):**\n    *   The anecdote revolves around a translator who encounters the English term \"lawn tennis\" for the first time.\n    *   In Russian, the sport is also called \"лаун-теннис\" (laun-tennis), a direct borrowing from English. However, a translator unfamiliar with the term might try to decipher its components.\n\n4.  **The Misinterpretation:**\n    *   The translator supposedly split \"lawn tennis\" into two separate words to be translated.\n    *   **\"Tennis\"**: This word closely resembles the surname of a very famous English poet, Alfred, Lord **Tennyson**.\n    *   **\"Lawn\"**: This word was supposedly misinterpreted as a mistyped or foreign version of \"Lord,\" especially when paired with a surname that sounded English. The combination \"Lord [Surname]\" is a standard form for the British aristocracy.\n\n5.  **The Resulting Phrase:**\n    *   Following this faulty logic, the phrase \"people were playing lawn tennis\" could be erroneously translated into Russian as something akin to \"люди играли в лорда Теннисона\" (\"people were playing Lord Tennyson\").\n    *   In this bizarre but logical-if-you-follow-the-mistake way, the surname of the English poet Tennyson appears in the Russian translation of a text describing the boulevards of Vienna.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Apocryphal Nature:** This story is a well-known piece of translator lore. It's often attributed to various translators (like Yuri Olesha) and various texts, but its primary function is as a cautionary tale about \"false friends\" and the importance of cultural context in translation.\n*   **The Key:** The puzzle does not require you to find the actual essay. It requires you to know this specific famous linguistic anecdote that links Vienna, boulevards, a Russian translation, and an English poet.\n*   **The Poet:** The poet whose name sounds like the sport is the key. \"Tennis\" and \"Tennyson\" are a near-perfect match.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBased on the famous translation anecdote involving the misinterpretation of \"lawn tennis,\" the surname of the English poet that appears is **Tennyson**.\n\n<<<Tennyson>>>"
