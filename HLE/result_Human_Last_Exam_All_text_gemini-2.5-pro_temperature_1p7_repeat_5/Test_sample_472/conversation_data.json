    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the scansion for the line: \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male\".\n\nThis line is an **iambic senarius**, a common meter in Roman comedy (this line is from Plautus, *Mercator* 472). It consists of six iambic feet (an iamb is S L). However, substitutions are frequent, especially in the first five feet.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elision:**\n    First, we break the line into syllables. We must also account for elision, where a final vowel (or vowel + m) is dropped before a word starting with a vowel.\n    *   Line: `et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male`\n    *   The final `-e` of `bene` elides before the initial `e-` of `esse`. The line is therefore pronounced and scanned as `et tibi ben' esse soli quom sibi sit male`.\n    *   Syllables: `et | ti | bi | be | n'es | se | so | li | quom | si | bi | sit | ma | le`\n\n2.  **Determining Syllable Quantity:**\n    We determine if each syllable is long (L) or short (S).\n    *   **Rule 1 (Long by Nature):** A syllable is long if its vowel is naturally long (e.g., macrons: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū) or a diphthong (ae, au, oe, ei, eu, ui).\n    *   **Rule 2 (Long by Position):** A syllable is long if its short vowel is followed by two or more consonants, or by a double consonant (x, z).\n\n3.  **Applying the Rules to Each Syllable:**\n\n    *   `et`: The vowel `e` is short, but the syllable is closed by the consonant `t`. Therefore, it is **long (L)** by position.\n    *   `ti-`: The vowel `i` in `tibi` is short, and it's followed by a single consonant. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `-bi`: The second `i` in `tibi` is also short. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `be-`: The first `e` in `bene` is short. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `n'es-` (from `bene esse`): After elision, this syllable becomes `nes`. The `e` is short, but it's followed by two consonants (`s` from `esse` and `s` from `soli` later, or just treated as a closed syllable ending in `s`). It is **long (L)** by position.\n    *   `-se`: The second syllable of `esse`. The `e` is short. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `so-`: The `o` in `soli` (dative of `solus`) is naturally long. **Long (L)**.\n    *   `-li`: The `i` in `soli` is also naturally long. **Long (L)**.\n    *   `quom`: This is an old spelling of `cum`. The vowel is followed by `m`, making it a closed syllable. **Long (L)** by position.\n    *   `si-`: The first `i` in `sibi` is short. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `-bi`: The second `i` in `sibi` is short. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `sit`: The `i` is short, but the syllable is closed by `t`. **Long (L)** by position.\n    *   `ma-`: The `a` in `male` is short. **Short (S)**.\n    *   `-le`: The final `e` in `male` is short. However, the final syllable of a line is considered *in anceps* (it can be scanned as long or short). In an iambic senarius, it is treated as long to complete the final iambic foot. This is called *brevis in longo*. So, it is **long (L)**.\n\n4.  **Grouping into Metrical Feet:**\n    Now we group the sequence of longs and shorts into six feet.\n\n    *   Raw Sequence: `L S S S L S L L L S S L S L`\n\n    Let's divide this into six feet, noting the allowed substitutions for an iamb (S L):\n    *   **Foot 1:** `et ti` -> **L S** (This is a Trochee, a common substitution).\n    *   **Foot 2:** `bi ben' es-` -> **S S L** (This is an Anapest, a common substitution).\n    *   **Foot 3:** `-se so-` -> **S L** (This is a perfect Iamb).\n    *   **Foot 4:** `-li quom` -> **L L** (This is a Spondee, a common substitution).\n    *   **Foot 5:** `sibi sit` -> **S S L** (This is an Anapest, a common substitution).\n    *   **Foot 6:** `male` -> **S L** (This is an Iamb, thanks to the *brevis in longo* rule on the final syllable).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe final scansion, with feet separated by spaces, is:\n\n`L S S S L S L L L S S L S L`\n\nThis represents the following feet: Trochee | Anapest | Iamb | Spondee | Anapest | Iamb.\n\n<<<L S S S L S L L L S S L S L>>>"
