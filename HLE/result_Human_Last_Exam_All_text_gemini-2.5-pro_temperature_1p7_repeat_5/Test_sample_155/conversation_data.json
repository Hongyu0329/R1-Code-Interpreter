    "This problem is a visual puzzle where the letters 't' and 'b' are used to \"draw\" the shapes of larger letters. The layout presented in the `verbatim` environment is the key to solving it.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Visual Layout**\n\nThe `verbatim` block shows text arranged in a specific layout. The horizontal spacing suggests the message is composed of three large letters. We can separate the input into three groups based on the columns they occupy.\n\nThe structure is roughly:\n```\n(Letter 1 parts)   (Letter 2 parts)   (Letter 3 parts)\n```\n\nThe components are distributed over 13 rows.\n- Horizontal bars are defined on rows 1, 7, and 13.\n- Vertical stems or components are defined on the lines with single letters. Rows 2-6 provide components for the first letter on the left. Rows 8-12 provide components for the third letter on the right.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Shape of the First Letter**\n\nLet's gather the components for the first letter, which is on the left side of the layout.\n*   **From Row 1:** `t b b` (This forms the top horizontal bar).\n*   **From Rows 2-6:** A vertical series of single letters (`b`, `b`, `b`, `t`, `b`) aligned on the far left. This forms the main vertical stem.\n*   **From Row 7:** `t b t` (This forms the middle horizontal bar).\n*   **From Row 13:** `b b` (This seems to be part of the base or foot of the letter).\n\nAssembling these parts visually:\nA vertical stem on the left.\nA horizontal bar at the top (`t b b`).\nA horizontal bar in the middle (`t b t`).\nThese components clearly form the shape of the capital letter **F**.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Shape of the Second Letter**\n\nNow, let's look at the components in the middle section.\n*   **From Row 1:** `t t t t` (Top horizontal bar).\n*   **From Row 7:** `t b b b` (Middle horizontal bar).\n*   **From Row 13:** `t t t t` (Bottom horizontal bar).\n\nThis letter is described by three horizontal bars. Assuming an implied vertical stem on the left (a common convention in such puzzles), these components form the capital letter **E**.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Shape of the Third Letter**\n\nFinally, we analyze the components on the right side.\n*   **From Row 1:** `b b b` (Top part of the letter's shape).\n*   **From Rows 8-12:** A vertical series of letters (`b`, `b`, `t`, `t`, `b`) aligned on the far right. This forms the rightmost edge of the letter's shape.\n*   **From Row 7:** `b b b` (Middle part of the letter's shape).\n*   **From Row 13:** `b t b b` (Bottom part of the letter's shape).\n\nLet's assemble this shape. Unlike the 'F', it doesn't have a clear, separate stem on the left. Instead, it has a prominent vertical element on the right.\n- The pieces `b b b` (top), `b b b` (middle), and `b t b b` (bottom) form horizontal elements.\n- The vertical line `b,b,t,t,b` forms the right side.\nIf we consider an implied vertical stem on the left, these parts combine to form a large, closed curve on the right. This structure is characteristic of the capital letter **D**. The straight part of the 'D' is the implied stem, and the parts we've identified form its bow.\n\n**Step 5: Combine the Letters**\n\nBy combining the three letters we have identified, we get the word:\nLetter 1: **F**\nLetter 2: **E**\nLetter 3: **D**\n\nThe encoded word is **FEED**.\n\n<<<FEED>>>"
