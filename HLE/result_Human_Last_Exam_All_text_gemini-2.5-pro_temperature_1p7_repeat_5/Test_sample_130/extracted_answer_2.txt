The edges of the image are smoothed, and the shapes they define evolve based on their curvature. Closed boundaries (like those of isolated shapes) shrink and eventually disappear. Open boundaries (those that connect to the image frame) are straightened. In the limit, the only edges that remain will be straight lines; all other edges will have been eliminated.
