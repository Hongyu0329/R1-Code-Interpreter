    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 1: Define the space $X$\nThe question asks for the first homology group of the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area. Let's break down this definition.\n\n1.  **Lattice:** A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup of rank 2. It can be represented as $\\Lambda = \\{ n_1 v_1 + n_2 v_2 \\mid n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$ for a basis of linearly independent vectors $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The basis can be represented by a matrix $A = [v_1 | v_2] \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. \"Nondegenerate\" means the lattice spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is part of the definition of a lattice in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\n2.  **Unit Area:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means we consider matrices $A$ such that $|\\det(A)| = 1$. This set of matrices is denoted $SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$. It has two connected components: $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ (matrices with determinant 1) and the set of matrices with determinant -1.\n\n3.  **Moduli Space:** A moduli space is a space of objects where equivalent objects are identified.\n    *   Two bases $A$ and $A'$ define the same lattice if they are related by a change of basis matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$, i.e., $A' = AM$.\n    *   The term \"moduli space of lattices\" usually implies that lattices related by rotation are considered equivalent. That is, $\\Lambda$ and $\\Lambda'$ are equivalent if $\\Lambda' = R\\Lambda$ for some rotation matrix $R \\in SO(2)$. If $\\Lambda$ is represented by the coset $A \\cdot GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$, then $R\\Lambda$ is represented by $RA \\cdot GL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\nTherefore, the space $X$ is the set of orbits of $SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$ under the action of both $SO(2)$ from the left and $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ from the right. We can write this as a double quotient:\n$X = SO(2) \\backslash SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 2: Find a more convenient model for $X$\nInstead of working with lattices directly, we can work with the associated quadratic forms.\nA lattice $\\Lambda$ generated by the columns of a matrix $A$ determines a positive-definite quadratic form on $\\mathbb{R}^2$ via the inner product: for a vector $v=A\\mathbf{x}$ with $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, its squared length is $\\|v\\|^2 = (A\\mathbf{x})^T(A\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{x}^T (A^T A) \\mathbf{x}$. The matrix $S = A^T A$ is a symmetric positive-definite matrix representing this quadratic form.\n\nLet's see how the conditions on $A$ translate to conditions on $S$:\n1.  If $A \\in SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$, then $\\det(S) = \\det(A^T A) = (\\det A)^2 = (\\pm 1)^2 = 1$. Let $\\mathcal{P}_1$ be the space of $2 \\times 2$ symmetric positive-definite real matrices with determinant 1.\n2.  The action of $SO(2)$ on $A$ from the left ($A \\mapsto RA$ for $R \\in SO(2)$) leaves $S$ invariant: $(RA)^T(RA) = A^T R^T R A = A^T I A = A^T A = S$.\n3.  The action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $A$ from the right ($A \\mapsto AM$ for $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$) transforms $S$ as follows: $(AM)^T(AM) = M^T (A^T A) M = M^T S M$.\n\nThe map $A \\mapsto S = A^TA$ gives a bijection from the space $SO(2) \\backslash SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R})$ to $\\mathcal{P}_1$. This induces a homeomorphism between the quotient spaces:\n$X = SO(2) \\backslash SL^\\pm(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathcal{P}_1 / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe action of $\\Gamma = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ on $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is given by $S \\mapsto M^T S M$ for $M \\in \\Gamma$.\n\n### Step 3: Compute the homology of $X$\nThe space $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is topologically contractible. One way to see this is to note that it's homeomorphic to the upper half-plane $\\mathcal{H} \\cong SL(2,\\mathbb{R})/SO(2)$, which is contractible.\nSince $\\mathcal{P}_1$ is contractible and $\\Gamma=GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is a discrete group acting on it, the quotient space $X = \\mathcal{P}_1/\\Gamma$ is an orbifold. The first homology group of such an orbifold is the abelianization of its orbifold fundamental group. The orbifold fundamental group of $\\mathcal{P}_1/\\Gamma$ is $\\Gamma$ itself.\nTherefore, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(\\Gamma, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\Gamma_{ab}$, the abelianization of $\\Gamma=GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n### Step 4: Compute the abelianization of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$\nThe group $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by the matrices:\n$S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$, and $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe abelianization $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})_{ab}$ is the quotient of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by its commutator subgroup. In the abelianized group, all elements commute. Let's denote the images of $S, T, J$ by $s, t, j$.\n\nThe defining relations of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ become relations in the abelian group:\n1.  The relations for $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ generated by $S, T$ are $S^4=I$ and $(ST)^3 = S^2$. In the abelianization, this becomes $4s=0$ and $3(s+t)=2s \\implies 3s+3t=2s \\implies s+3t=0 \\implies s=-3t$.\n2.  The relations involving $J$ are $J^2=I$, $JSJ^{-1}=S^{-1}$, and $JTJ^{-1}=T^{-1}$. Since the group is abelian, these simplify:\n    *   $J^2=I \\implies 2j=0$.\n    *   $S = S^{-1} \\implies S^2=I \\implies 2s=0$.\n    *   $T = T^{-1} \\implies T^2=I \\implies 2t=0$.\n\nNow we combine these relations:\n*   We have $2t=0$.\n*   We have $s=-3t$. Since $2t=0$, we have $s = -3t = -t-2t = -t$. So $s=-t$.\n*   The relation $2s=0$ becomes $2(-t)=0$, which is the same as $2t=0$.\n*   The relation $4s=0$ is also implied by $2s=0$.\n\nSo the abelian group is generated by $j$ and $t$ with relations $2j=0$ and $2t=0$. There are no further relations connecting $j$ and $t$. This means that any element can be uniquely written as $aj+bt$ where $a, b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThis group is isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2.\n$GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})_{ab} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n\nThe two generators of the homology group can be understood through two independent homomorphisms from $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$:\n1.  The determinant map: $\\det: GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n2.  A map related to the reduction modulo 2: $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to GL(2, \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\cong S_3$. Composing with the sign homomorphism $\\text{sgn}: S_3 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2$ gives another homomorphism.\n\nThese two homomorphisms are surjective and have different kernels, demonstrating that the abelianization is $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$."
