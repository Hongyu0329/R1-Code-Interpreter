    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the riddle:\n\n**Analysis of the Question Step by Step**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Prompt**: The core task is to solve a riddle presented as a haiku. We must identify the question, the clues, and the constraints on the answer.\n2.  **Identify the Question**: The prompt states, \"The title is a question\". The title is “The Bays”. This suggests the question is not literally \"The Bays\", but a pun or reinterpretation of the phrase. A plausible interpretation is that \"Bays\" refers to the sound of baying or howling, so the question is, \"What is it that bays?\".\n3.  **Analyze the Clues**: The clues are the three lines of the haiku:\n    *   Line 1: “An August tempest”\n    *   Line 2: “Twice fifteen brings winds of change”\n    *   Line 3: “A divine one yields”\n4.  **Identify the Constraint**: The prompt gives a crucial final instruction: \"in alphabetical order what is the answer?\". This means the answer is a single English word whose letters are already in alphabetical sequence.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider**\n\n*   **The Title Pun**: The title \"The Bays\" being a question is a primary clue. The pun on the \"baying\" sound is a more likely interpretation than \"The B's\" or geographical bays, as it leads to a singular entity that the haiku can describe.\n*   **The Alphabetical Order Constraint**: This is the most important filter. The correct answer must be a word like \"almost\", \"biopsy\", \"effort\", or \"ghost\", where the letters are naturally in alphabetical order. This significantly narrows down the possible solutions.\n*   **Idiomatic Language**: Riddles often use idioms and wordplay. Phrases like \"winds of change\" and \"yields\" should be considered both literally and figuratively.\n*   **The Numbers**: The haiku contains numbers (\"Twice fifteen\" = 30, and \"one\"). These are specific clues that must be accounted for in the final solution.\n\n**Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  Given the constraint that the answer's letters must be in alphabetical order, we can hypothesize potential answers and test them against the clues. A strong candidate from the list of such words is **GHOST**.\n\n2.  Let's test **GHOST** against the clues:\n    *   **Question (\"The Bays?\")**: Does a ghost \"bay\"? A ghost is often described as moaning, wailing, or howling, which is synonymous with \"baying\". This fits the question.\n    *   **Line 1 (\"An August tempest\")**: A ghostly manifestation or a poltergeist event is often described as a sudden, unexplained, and violent disturbance—a tempest. This line serves as a fitting description.\n    *   **Line 2 (\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\")**: \"Twice fifteen\" equals 30. This could reference the 30th of October, known as Mischief Night or Devil's Night, which directly precedes Halloween and is strongly associated with spirits. A ghost itself represents the ultimate \"wind of change\"—the transition from life to death.\n    *   **Line 3 (\"A divine one yields\")**: This is a powerful and direct clue. \"To yield the ghost\" is a common, historical idiom for the act of dying. The \"divine one\" (such as God or Fate) is the force that \"yields\" or brings about this end.\n\n3.  **Final Confirmation**: All parts of the haiku strongly point to the word \"GHOST\". We check it one last time against the primary constraint: Are the letters G-H-O-S-T in alphabetical order? Yes, they are.\n\nThis confirms that **GHOST** is the intended answer.\n\n<<<GHOST>>>"
