    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe primary objective is to metabolically engineer *Corynebacterium glutamicum* to produce and accumulate p-coumaric acid. A key challenge has been identified: the produced p-coumaric acid is being broken down (degraded) by the host organism's native metabolism. We need to identify a specific gene to \"knock out\" (inactivate or delete) to prevent this degradation.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Metabolic Problem**\nThe degradation of the desired product implies that *C. glutamicum* possesses a natural catabolic pathway that uses p-coumaric acid as a substrate. To prevent this, we must block this pathway. The most effective strategy in metabolic engineering is to disable the very first enzymatic step of the degradation pathway. This prevents the cell from committing the product to degradation and avoids the potential accumulation of intermediate metabolites which could be toxic.\n\n### **Step 3: Identify the Specific Degradation Pathway in *Corynebacterium glutamicum***\nWe need to determine how *C. glutamicum* specifically catabolizes p-coumaric acid. Research into the metabolism of this bacterium reveals the following:\n*   *C. glutamicum* can use various aromatic compounds, including p-coumaric acid, as a carbon and energy source.\n*   The primary and first step in the degradation of p-coumaric acid (and related phenolic acids like ferulic acid) in *C. glutamicum* is a **non-oxidative decarboxylation**.\n*   This reaction converts p-coumaric acid into **4-vinylphenol** (also called p-vinylphenol) and releases a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2).\n\n### **Step 4: Identify the Responsible Enzyme and Gene**\n*   **Enzyme:** The enzyme that catalyzes this specific decarboxylation reaction (p-coumaric acid â†’ 4-vinylphenol + CO2) is called **Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase (PAD)**.\n*   **Gene:** The gene that codes for this enzyme needs to be identified for the knockout. In bacterial genetics, this gene is commonly named **padC** (for **p**henolic **a**cid **d**e**c**arboxylase). Sometimes it is also referred to as *pcd*. Knocking out this gene will result in a non-functional or absent PAD enzyme.\n\n### **Step 5: Propose the Solution and Verify its Effect**\n*   **Solution:** The proposed solution is to knock out the **padC** gene in the *C. glutamicum* genome.\n*   **Effect:** By deleting or inactivating the *padC* gene, the cell will no longer be able to synthesize the Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase enzyme. As a result, the first step of the p-coumaric acid degradation pathway is blocked. The p-coumaric acid produced by the engineered biosynthetic pathway will no longer be converted to 4-vinylphenol and will accumulate in the cell or the culture medium, achieving the project's goal.\n\n### **Careful Points to Consider:**\n1.  **Organism Specificity:** The degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid can differ in other microorganisms. This answer is specific to *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, where the PAD-mediated pathway is the well-characterized primary route.\n2.  **Completeness of the Block:** While *padC* knockout is the primary target, one should be aware of the possibility of minor, alternative degradation pathways. However, for industrial strain development, targeting the main flux-carrying pathway is the most critical and effective first step.\n3.  **Gene Nomenclature:** While *padC* is the common name, the gene might have a different locus tag in the official genome annotation (e.g., *cg1512*). However, identifying it by its function (Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase) is universally understood.\n\nBy following these steps, we can confidently identify the target gene for knockout.\n\n***\n\n<<<The gene that should be knocked out is the **Phenolic Acid Decarboxylase gene (padC)**.>>>"
