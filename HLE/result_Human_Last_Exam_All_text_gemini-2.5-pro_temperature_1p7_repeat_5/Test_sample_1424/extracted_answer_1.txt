In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency/energy variable $\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. Specifically, in the eigenbasis of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, the expression for $G_0$ is of the form $G_0(k, \omega) \propto (\omega - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$. This means that the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\epsilon_k$ appear as the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane.
