    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Definition of the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe Green's function, in general, describes the propagation of a particle (or excitation) through a system. The \"bare\" Green's function, denoted as $G_0$, specifically describes this propagation in a **non-interacting** system. The Hamiltonian for such a system, $H_0$, contains only kinetic energy terms and single-particle potential terms, but no particle-particle interaction terms.\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, all correlation functions, including the Green's function, are calculated from a generating functional, $Z_0$. For a non-interacting fermionic system described by Grassmann fields $\\psi$ and $\\bar{\\psi}$, the generating functional is built upon the non-interacting action, $S_0$.\n\nThe two-point bare Green's function is defined as the vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered product of a creation and an annihilation operator, which in the path integral language is:\n$G_0(x, t; x', t') = \\langle \\psi(x, t) \\bar{\\psi}(x', t') \\rangle = \\frac{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, \\psi(x, t) \\bar{\\psi}(x', t') \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}{\\int \\mathcal{D}\\bar{\\psi} \\mathcal{D}\\psi \\, e^{iS_0[\\bar{\\psi}, \\psi]}}$\nwhere the time-ordering is implicit in the definition using anti-commuting Grassmann fields.\n\n**2. The Non-Interacting Action ($S_0$) and its Relation to $\\epsilon_k$**\n\nTo find the functional dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, we must express the action $S_0$ in terms of them. This is achieved by working in the basis that diagonalizes the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$.\n\nLet $|k\\rangle$ be the eigenstates of $H_0$ with corresponding energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$:\n$H_0 |k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |k\\rangle$\nIn the language of second quantization, the Hamiltonian is $H_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k c_k^\\dagger c_k$, where $c_k^\\dagger$ and $c_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in the state $|k\\rangle$.\n\nThe action $S_0$ in the path integral formalism is the classical action corresponding to this Hamiltonian. For clarity, let's work in the imaginary-time (Matsubara) formalism, which is standard in many-body theory. The action for the corresponding Grassmann variables $c_k(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{c}_k(\\tau)$ is:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{c}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_k(\\tau)$\nHere, $\\tau$ is the imaginary time, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.\n\n**3. Fourier Transformation and Solving the Path Integral**\n\nThe expression for the Green's function becomes much simpler in the frequency-momentum domain. We perform a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$ (where $i\\omega_n$ is the energy variable in this formalism).\n$c_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_{n} e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} c_{k,n}$\n\nSubstituting this into the action, the derivative term $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes diagonal in both the state label $k$ and the frequency label $n$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k, n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) c_{k,n}$\n\nThis action is quadratic in the Grassmann fields, meaning the path integral is a Gaussian integral. The general form of the action is $S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{c}_{k,n} [\\mathcal{G}_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n)] c_{k,n}$. The quantity in the middle is precisely the *inverse* of the bare Green's function in this basis.\nFrom this, we can directly identify:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0^{-1}(k, i\\omega_n) = -i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu$\n\nThe bare Green's function is the inverse of this expression:\n$G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu} = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n**4. Analyzing the Functional Dependence**\n\nThe final expression, $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$, reveals the functional dependence explicitly. To make the physical interpretation more apparent, we can perform an analytic continuation to real frequencies ($\\omega$) by letting $i\\omega_n \\to \\omega + i\\delta$, where $\\delta$ is a positive infinitesimal. This yields the retarded/advanced Green's function:\n$G_0^R(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$\n\nThe key points of the analysis are:\n*   The bare Green's function $G_0$, when expressed as a function of energy (or frequency, $\\omega$) and momentum (or state label, $k$), takes the form of a simple fraction.\n*   The single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ appears in the denominator of this fraction.\n*   Specifically, the denominator contains the term $\\omega - \\epsilon_k$ (possibly shifted by the chemical potential $\\mu$).\n*   This functional form means that $G_0(k, \\omega)$ has a **pole** in the complex energy plane. For a given state $k$, the pole is located at the energy $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$.\n*   Physically, a pole in the Green's function represents a stable excitation of the system. For the bare Green's function, these stable excitations are precisely the single particles themselves, with their corresponding energies $\\epsilon_k$. The propagator diverges when the energy of the probe matches the energy of the particle, indicating a resonance.\n\n---\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Non-Interacting System**: This entire analysis is valid only for the **bare** Green's function ($G_0$), which applies to a system without particle-particle interactions. For an interacting system, the full Green's function ($G$) has poles at the *quasiparticle* energies, which are generally different from $\\epsilon_k$ and may have a finite imaginary part (corresponding to a finite lifetime).\n2.  **Choice of Basis**: The simple form $G_0 \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$ is obtained in the basis of states $\\{|k\\rangle\\}$ that diagonalize the single-particle Hamiltonian $H_0$.\n3.  **Role of Poles**: The central concept is that the single-particle energy eigenvalues dictate the location of the poles of the bare propagator. This is a fundamental link between the Hamiltonian's spectrum and the system's response/propagation characteristics.\n4.  **Energy Variable**: The dependence is on the difference between the external energy/frequency variable ($\\omega$ or $i\\omega_n$) and the intrinsic energy eigenvalue of the particle ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\n---\n### Final Answer\n\nIn the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is derived from the non-interacting action $S_0$. When the calculation is performed in the basis of eigenstates of the single-particle Hamiltonian (labeled by a quantum number $k$), the resulting Green's function in frequency-momentum space is:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$\n\nwhere $\\omega$ is the frequency (energy) variable, $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for the state $k$, $\\mu$ is the chemical potential, and $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary part whose sign determines the specific type of Green's function (retarded, advanced, or time-ordered).\n\nThe functional dependence is therefore that **the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$ determines the location of the pole of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane.** For a given state $k$, the function $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is singular when the energy variable $\\omega$ is equal to the particle's energy $\\epsilon_k$ (shifted by the chemical potential). This is an inverse linear relationship: $G_0$ is proportional to $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n\n<<<In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the frequency/energy variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, in the eigenbasis of the non-interacting Hamiltonian, the expression for $G_0$ is of the form $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$. This means that the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ appear as the locations of the poles of the bare Green's function in the complex energy plane."
