The two languages are Turkish and Malay (also known as Bahasa Melayu or Bahasa Indonesia). Turkish is a Turkic language from West Asia, while Malay is an Austronesian language from Southeast Asia. These two languages and their cultures are geographically distant and linguistically unrelated, with no significant history of direct contact.

The similarities are as follows:
1.  **Dad:** The Turkish word is `baba`, and the Malay word is `bapa`. These are nearly identical.
2.  **Mom:** The Turkish word is `ana`, and a common Malay word is `emak`. Both words are built around a nasal consonant (`n`/`m`) and a low vowel (`a`/`e`), showing high structural similarity.
3.  **Broom:** The Turkish word is `süpürge` (from the verb *to sweep*, `süpürmek`), and the Malay word is `sapu`. The roots `süpür-` and `sapu` are remarkably similar phonetically.
