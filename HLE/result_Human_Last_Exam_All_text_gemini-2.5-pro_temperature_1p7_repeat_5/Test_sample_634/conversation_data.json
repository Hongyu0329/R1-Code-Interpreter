    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the given polynomial matrices.\n\n**1. Understand the Definitions**\n\n*   **Right Divisor**: A polynomial matrix `R(s)` is a right divisor of `P(s)` if there exists a polynomial matrix `Q(s)` such that `P(s) = Q(s)R(s)`.\n*   **Common Right Divisor (CRD)**: A matrix `C(s)` is a common right divisor of `P1(s)` and `P2(s)` if it is a right divisor of both `P1(s)` and `P2(s)`.\n*   **Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD)**: A GCRD `G(s)` is a common right divisor such that any other common right divisor `C(s)` is a right divisor of `G(s)`. That is, `G(s) = L(s)C(s)` for some polynomial matrix `L(s)`. The GCRD is not unique; if `G(s)` is a GCRD, then so is `U(s)G(s)` for any unimodular matrix `U(s)` (a square polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant).\n\n**2. State the Matrices**\n\nP1 = `[[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]`\nP2 = `[[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]`\n\n**3. Method: Euclidean Algorithm for Polynomial Matrices**\n\nThe standard method to find the GCRD is to use the Euclidean algorithm. We form a composite matrix `M` by stacking `P1` and `P2`, and then use elementary row operations to reduce it to a form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a GCRD.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1.  Swapping two rows.\n2.  Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n3.  Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n\n**4. Step-by-Step Reduction**\n\nLet's form the stacked matrix `M`:\n`M = [[s^2 + s,  -s],     (R1)`\n     `[-s^2 - 1, s^2],    (R2)`\n     `[s,        0],      (R3)`\n     `[-s - 1,   1]]      (R4)`\n\n**Step 4.1: Initial Simplification**\nA careful observation reveals a simple relationship between row `R1` and row `R4`.\n`R1 = [s^2 + s, -s]`\n`R4 = [-s - 1, 1]`\nLet's multiply `R4` by `-s`: `-s * R4 = [-s(-s-1), -s(1)] = [s^2 + s, -s]`.\nWe see that `R1 = -s * R4`. This means `R1` is linearly dependent on `R4` over the ring of polynomials. We can use this to eliminate `R1`.\n\nPerform the row operation `R1 -> R1 + s * R4`:\n`[s^2 + s, -s] + s * [-s - 1, 1] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s + s] = [0, 0]`\n\nThe matrix `M` becomes:\n`M' = [[0,        0],`\n      `[-s^2 - 1, s^2],    (R2)`\n      `[s,        0],      (R3)`\n      `[-s - 1,   1]]      (R4)`\n\n**Step 4.2: Reduce the new matrix**\nWe can ignore the zero row. The problem is now to find the GCRD of the remaining rows `R2`, `R3`, `R4`. The goal is to create more zero entries. The entry '1' in `R4` at position (2,2) is a good pivot. Let's use it to eliminate the `s^2` in `R2` at position (1,2).\n\nPerform the operation `R2 -> R2 - s^2 * R4`:\n`R2_new = [-s^2 - 1, s^2] - s^2 * [-s - 1, 1]`\n`= [-s^2 - 1 - s^2(-s-1), s^2 - s^2]`\n`= [-s^2 - 1 + s^3 + s^2, 0]`\n`= [s^3 - 1, 0]`\n\nThe matrix of non-zero rows becomes:\n`M'' = [[s^3 - 1,  0],    (R2')`\n       `[s,        0],    (R3)`\n       `[-s - 1,   1]]    (R4)`\n\n**Step 4.3: Further Reduction**\nNow, `R2'` and `R3` both have a zero in the second column. We can use the one with the lower degree polynomial in the first column (`R3`) to simplify the other (`R2'`).\n\nPolynomial division of `s^3-1` by `s` gives: `s^3 - 1 = s^2 * s - 1`.\nPerform the operation `R2' -> R2' - s^2 * R3`:\n`R2''_new = [s^3 - 1, 0] - s^2 * [s, 0] = [s^3 - 1 - s^3, 0] = [-1, 0]`\n\nThe matrix becomes:\n`M''' = [[-1,     0],    (R2'')`\n        `[s,      0],    (R3)`\n        `[-s - 1, 1]]    (R4)`\n\n**Step 4.4: Final Reduction to Echelon Form**\nThe row `R2'' = [-1, 0]` is now very simple. Let's use it to eliminate the first column entries in `R3` and `R4`.\n\nPerform the operation `R3 -> R3 + s * R2''`:\n`R3_new = [s, 0] + s * [-1, 0] = [s - s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n\nPerform the operation `R4 -> R4 - (s+1) * R2''`:\n`R4_new = [-s - 1, 1] - (s+1) * [-1, 0] = [-s - 1 - (-s-1), 1 - 0] = [0, 1]`\n\nThe final set of rows is:\n`[-1, 0]`\n`[0, 0]`\n`[0, 1]`\n\n**5. Determine the GCRD**\n\nThe non-zero rows form the GCRD matrix `G`. By reordering the rows, we get:\n`G = [[-1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nThe determinant of `G` is `(-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. Thus, `G` is a unimodular matrix.\n\n**6. Normalize the GCRD**\nAs the GCRD is unique only up to a left multiplication by a unimodular matrix, any unimodular matrix is a valid GCRD for `P1` and `P2`. A standard practice is to present the GCRD in a canonical form, such as the row-reduced echelon form.\n\nTo convert `G = [[-1, 0], [0, 1]]` to row-reduced echelon form, we multiply the first row by -1:\n`G_normalized = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\nThis is the identity matrix `I`. The fact that the GCRD is a unimodular matrix (like the identity matrix) means that the original matrices `P1` and `P2` are **right coprime**.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe greatest common right divisor of the given polynomial matrices P1 and P2 is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n`GCRD(P1, P2) = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`\n\n>>> [[1, 0], [0, 1]]"
