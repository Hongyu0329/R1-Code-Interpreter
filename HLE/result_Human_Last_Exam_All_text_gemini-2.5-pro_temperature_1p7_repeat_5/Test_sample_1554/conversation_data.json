    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question asks to identify a specific philosopher. The key constraints are:\n1.  The philosopher must belong to the **Lviv-Warsaw School**.\n2.  This philosopher must have performed a specific philosophical analysis: **decomposing the notion of \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\"**.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the \"Lviv-Warsaw School\"**\nThis was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy in Poland, primarily active between the two World Wars. Its members are known for their rigorous logical methods and clarity in philosophical analysis. Key figures include Kazimierz Twardowski (the founder), Jan Łukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski, Stanisław Leśniewski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. Our answer must be one of these individuals or another associated member.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the core concepts: \"Hallmark,\" \"Symptom,\" and \"Signal\"**\n*   **Hallmark:** In this philosophical context, a hallmark is not just a mark of quality but a more general term for any sign, indicator, or criterion that allows us to recognize or infer something else.\n*   **Decomposition into Symptoms and Signals:** The question states that this general notion of a sign (hallmark) was broken down into two distinct types. We need to understand this distinction.\n    *   **Symptom:** This is typically understood as a *natural sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on a natural or causal law. The inference is often empirical or inductive. A classic example is smoke being a symptom of fire, or a fever being a symptom of an illness.\n    *   **Signal:** This is a *conventional sign*. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is based on human agreement, rules, or convention. The inference is based on knowing the rule. For example, a red traffic light is a signal to stop, and the word \"dog\" is a linguistic signal for a canine animal.\n\n**Step 4: Connect the Concepts to a Philosopher from the School**\nWe must now search through the works and key ideas of the Lviv-Warsaw School philosophers to find who made this specific distinction.\n*   While many in the school were interested in signs and language, the philosopher most famous for this particular analysis in epistemology and the philosophy of language is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n*   In his works on logic, language, and the theory of knowledge, Ajdukiewicz precisely articulated this distinction. He analyzed the different ways we draw inferences. Inferences from **symptoms** (e.g., seeing wet streets and inferring it has rained) are based on our knowledge of natural regularities. Inferences from **signals** (e.g., hearing someone say \"it is raining\" and believing it) are based on our understanding of linguistic conventions and the rules of communication.\n*   This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of meaning, knowledge, and justification. Therefore, he is the correct philosopher.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the Analysis**\nThe philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who decomposed the notion of a sign, indicator, or \"hallmark\" into the categories of natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals) is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n***\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
