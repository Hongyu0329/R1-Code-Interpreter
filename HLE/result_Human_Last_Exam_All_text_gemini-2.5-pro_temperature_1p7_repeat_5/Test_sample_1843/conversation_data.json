    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the structure of Dirichlet Characters**\n\nA Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely decomposed into a product of characters corresponding to the prime power factors of $N$.\nLet the prime factorization of $N$ be $N = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$. Then any character $\\chi \\pmod N$ can be written as:\n$$ \\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r $$\nwhere each $\\chi_i$ is a character modulo $p_i^{k_i}$.\n\nThere are two key properties we will use:\n*   **Conductor:** The character $\\chi$ is **primitive** (i.e., its conductor is $N$) if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_i$ is primitive modulo $p_i^{k_i}$.\n*   **Order:** The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi) = \\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_1), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\n**2. Factor the Conductor N**\n\nThe given conductor is $N = 36036$. We find its prime factorization:\n$N = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 143) = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, the prime power factors are $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$.\n\nWe need to find the number of characters $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ such that:\n1.  Each $\\chi_m$ is a primitive character for its modulus $m$.\n2.  $\\operatorname{lcm}(\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_9), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_7), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n**3. Analyze Primitive Characters for Each Factor**\n\nLet's determine the number of available primitive characters for each factor, keeping in mind that their orders must be divisors of 6 for the final lcm to be 6. We denote the number of primitive characters of conductor $m$ and order $d$ as $\\mathcal{N}(m, d)$.\n\n*   **Modulo 4 ($2^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_2$. There is one trivial character (conductor 1, order 1) and one non-trivial character. This non-trivial character is primitive with conductor 4 and order 2.\n    For the final order to be 6, $\\operatorname{ord}(\\chi_4)$ must divide 6. The order is 2, which does divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_4$: $\\mathcal{N}(4,2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 9 ($3^2$):**\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/9\\mathbb{Z})^\\times \\cong C_6$. The primitive characters are those not induced from characters modulo 3. The primitive characters modulo 9 have orders 3 and 6. Both 3 and 6 are divisors of 6.\n    *   Number of choices with order 3: $\\mathcal{N}(9,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices with order 6: $\\mathcal{N}(9,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_9$: $2+2=4$.\n\n*   **Modulo 7:**\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is $C_6$. All non-trivial characters are primitive. Their orders can be 2, 3, or 6, all of which divide 6.\n    *   Number of choices with order 2: $\\mathcal{N}(7,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of choices with order 3: $\\mathcal{N}(7,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices with order 6: $\\mathcal{N}(7,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_7$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n*   **Modulo 11:**\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is $C_{10}$. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 5, and 10. For the lcm of all orders to be 6, the order of $\\chi_{11}$ must divide 6. Of the possible orders {2, 5, 10}, only 2 divides 6.\n    *   Number of choices for $\\chi_{11}$: Must have order 2. $\\mathcal{N}(11,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n\n*   **Modulo 13:**\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is $C_{12}$. The possible orders of primitive characters are 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n    *   Number of choices with order 2: $\\mathcal{N}(13,2) = \\phi(2) = 1$.\n    *   Number of choices with order 3: $\\mathcal{N}(13,3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    *   Number of choices with order 6: $\\mathcal{N}(13,6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n    *   Total choices for $\\chi_{13}$: $1+2+2=5$.\n\n**4. Combine the Choices and Verify the LCM Condition**\n\nWe need to form a tuple of characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ where each component is chosen from the possibilities found above. We must ensure the lcm of their orders is exactly 6.\n\n1.  **Divisibility of lcm:** By selecting characters whose orders all divide 6, the resulting lcm will also divide 6.\n2.  **Factor of 2:** The character $\\chi_4$ must be chosen, and its order is 2. Therefore, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 2.\n3.  **Factor of 3:** The character $\\chi_9$ must be chosen, and its order must be 3 or 6. In both cases, the order is divisible by 3. Therefore, the lcm of the orders will always be divisible by 3.\n\nSince the lcm must be divisible by both 2 and 3, it must be divisible by 6. Combined with the fact that the lcm must divide 6, we can conclude that the lcm is exactly 6 for any valid combination of component characters.\n\n**5. Calculate the Total Number**\n\nThe total number of primitive characters of conductor $N$ and order 6 is the product of the number of available choices for each component character:\nTotal Number = (choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal Number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5$\nTotal Number = $100$\n\n<<<100>>>"
