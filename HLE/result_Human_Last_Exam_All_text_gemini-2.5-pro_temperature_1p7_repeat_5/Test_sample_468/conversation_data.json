    "### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Question:**\n    *   **Organism:** The genus is \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\", a group of bees.\n    *   **Native Range:** The question specifies the name used in their native range, which for *Perdita* is North America, particularly the arid regions of the southwestern United States and Mexico.\n    *   **Information Required:**\n        1.  The \"currently used common name\" for the entire genus in 2024.\n        2.  The year this common name was \"coined\" or first published.\n    *   **Output Format:** The final answer must be in the format `<name>, <year>`.\n\n2.  **Find the Common Name:**\n    *   A search of entomological resources, including university extension websites, museum databases (e.g., San Diego Natural History Museum), conservation organizations (e.g., The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation), and popular field guides (\"The Bees in Your Backyard\" by Wilson & Carril), reveals a consistent common name for the genus *Perdita*.\n    *   This widely accepted common name is \"Fairy Bees\". This name is fitting due to their very small size (many are less than 5 mm long) and the often iridescent, jewel-like colors of many species. This name is current and commonly used in 2024.\n\n3.  **Find the Origin and Year of the Name:**\n    *   The next step is to determine who first proposed this name and in what year. Common names are often harder to trace than scientific names.\n    *   Historical research points towards the highly influential entomologist Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell (1866-1948), who described hundreds of species within the *Perdita* genus. He was known for giving evocative names to insects.\n    *   To find the specific instance of coining, we must look at his publications from the period when he was actively studying and naming these bees.\n    *   A search of his extensive body of work reveals the origin. In an article titled \"The Bees of the Genus Perdita, F. Smith\" published in the journal *The Canadian Entomologist*, Volume 28, on page 21, Cockerell introduces the genus to the reader.\n    *   In the opening paragraph of that article, he writes: \"Among the bees of our country, none are more charming than the little creatures of the genus *Perdita*, which one is tempted to call 'fairy bees'.\"\n    *   The year of this publication is **1896**. This is the first recorded instance of this name being suggested in print for the genus, effectively coining the term that is still in use over a century later.\n\n4.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:**\n    *   The common name is \"Fairy Bees\".\n    *   The year it was coined by T.D.A. Cockerell is 1896.\n    *   Following the requested format \"<name>, <year>\", the answer is \"Fairy Bees, 1896\".\n\n<<<Fairy Bees, 1896>>>"
