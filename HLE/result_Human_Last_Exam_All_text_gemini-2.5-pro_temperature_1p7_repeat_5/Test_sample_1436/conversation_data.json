    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the symmetry factor of the specified Feynman diagram.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question and Identify the Diagram's Structure\n\n*   **\"two vertices\"**: This tells us the diagram is of the second order in the perturbation expansion of the interaction Lagrangian. Let the vertices be V1 and V2.\n*   **\"four field contractions\"**: In a Feynman diagram, a field contraction is represented by a propagator, or a line. Therefore, the diagram has four lines.\n*   **Connecting the components**: We need to connect two vertices using four lines. For this to be a single, connected diagram, all four lines must connect V1 to V2. If any line connected a vertex to itself (a tadpole), it would be impossible to use the remaining lines and legs to form a single connected diagram.\n*   **Vertex type**: Each line connects two fields. Since there are four lines, there are a total of `4 * 2 = 8` field ends. These 8 ends must attach to the two vertices. Assuming the vertices are identical (coming from the same interaction term, e.g., $\\mathcal{L}_{int} \\propto \\phi^n$), each vertex must have the same number of legs. Thus, each vertex must have `8 / 2 = 4` legs. This corresponds to an interaction term like $\\lambda \\phi^4$.\n\nSo, the diagram is a second-order diagram in $\\phi^4$ theory, where two vertices are connected to each other by four propagators. This is often called a \"setting-sun\" diagram.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Concept of a Symmetry Factor\n\nThe symmetry factor, S, is a purely combinatorial number associated with a Feynman diagram. It represents the order of the automorphism group of the diagram. In simpler terms, it's the total number of ways you can permute the lines and vertices of the diagram without changing its topological structure. This factor is needed to correct for overcounting that arises from Wick's theorem when expanding the interaction term in the path integral.\n\n### Step 3: Identify and Count the Symmetries of the Diagram\n\nWe calculate the total symmetry factor by identifying all the possible permutation operations that leave the diagram unchanged and multiplying the number of ways each operation can be performed.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Permutation of Identical Vertices**\n    *   The diagram consists of two vertices, V1 and V2, which arise from the same interaction term. Therefore, they are identical.\n    *   We can swap the positions of V1 and V2, and the diagram's topology remains exactly the same.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these two identical vertices is **2! = 2**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Permutation of Identical Lines**\n    *   The diagram has four propagator lines, and they all connect the same two vertices (V1 and V2).\n    *   From a topological standpoint, these four lines are indistinguishable. We can swap them around in any order, and the diagram will be unchanged.\n    *   The number of ways to permute these four identical lines is **4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24**.\n\n*   **Careful Point 3: Other Symmetries**\n    *   We also need to check for other possible symmetries, such as symmetries of a single line. A line that connects a vertex to itself can sometimes be \"flipped\", contributing a factor of 2. In this diagram, all lines connect two *different* vertices, so this type of symmetry does not exist.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Final Symmetry Factor\n\nThe total symmetry factor S is the product of the number of ways each independent symmetry operation can be performed.\n\n*   S = (Number of vertex permutations) × (Number of line permutations)\n*   S = 2! × 4!\n*   S = 2 × 24\n*   S = 48\n\nThus, the symmetry factor associated with this Feynman diagram is 48.\n\n<<<48>>>"
