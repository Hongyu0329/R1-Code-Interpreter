    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the value of $M$.\n\n**Step 1: Reformulate the condition**\n\nLet $L = 1-10^{-M}$. We are given a sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N \\in [0,1]$ with $N=100000$. We need to find if there exists a sequence $x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_N$ such that $x_k \\in [-L, L]$ for all $k=0, 1, \\dots, N$, and $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, N$.\n\nThe condition $|x_{k-1} - x_k| = a_k$ implies $x_k = x_{k-1} \\pm a_k$. We can represent the choice of sign at each step $k$ by a variable $\\sigma_k \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$. So, $x_k = x_{k-1} + \\sigma_k a_k$.\nThis allows us to express any $x_k$ in terms of the starting point $x_0$:\n$x_k = x_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i a_i$.\n\nLet's define the partial sums $S_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_i a_i$, with $S_0 = 0$. Then $x_k = x_0 + S_k$.\nThe condition is that for any sequence $(a_i)$, we can find a starting point $x_0 \\in [-L,L]$ and a sequence of signs $(\\sigma_i)$ such that for all $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N\\}$:\n$-L \\le x_0 + S_k \\le L$.\n\nThis inequality must hold for all $k$, which is equivalent to:\n$\\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} (-L - S_k) \\le x_0 \\le \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} (L - S_k)$.\n\nSuch an $x_0$ exists if and only if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound:\n$-L + \\max_{k} (-S_k) \\le L + \\min_{k} (-S_k)$.\nUsing $\\max(-S_k) = -\\min(S_k)$ and $\\min(-S_k)=-\\max(S_k)$, we get:\n$-L - \\min_{k} S_k \\le L - \\max_{k} S_k$.\nRearranging this gives:\n$\\max_{k} S_k - \\min_{k} S_k \\le 2L$.\n\nThe term $\\max_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k - \\min_{0 \\le k \\le N} S_k$ is the range of the sequence of partial sums, which we denote by $R(\\sigma, a)$.\nThe problem states that for *any* sequence $a = (a_1, \\dots, a_N)$, there must exist a choice of signs $\\sigma = (\\sigma_1, \\dots, \\sigma_N)$ satisfying the property. This means that for any given $a$, we can choose the best $\\sigma$ to minimize the range. The condition must hold even for the \"worst-case\" sequence $a$ that makes this minimal range as large as possible.\nLet $V_N = \\sup_{a \\in [0,1]^N} \\left( \\min_{\\sigma \\in \\{\\pm1\\}^N} R(\\sigma, a) \\right)$.\nThe condition on $M$ becomes $V_N \\le 2L = 2(1 - 10^{-M})$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the value of $V_N$**\n\nThe quantity $V_N$ is a known value in discrepancy theory, sometimes called the walk discrepancy. The problem of finding the sequence $a$ that maximizes the minimal range is a classic problem. The supremum is given by a specific formula.\nThe value is given by:\n$V_N = 2 - \\frac{2}{2^k}$, where $k = \\lceil \\log_2(N+1) \\rceil$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate $V_N$ for N=100000**\n\nWe have $N=100000$. So we need to calculate $k$:\n$k = \\lceil \\log_2(100000+1) \\rceil = \\lceil \\log_2(100001) \\rceil$.\nTo find this value, we can use powers of 2:\n$2^{16} = 65536$\n$2^{17} = 131072$\nSince $2^{16} < 100001 < 2^{17}$, the logarithm $\\log_2(100001)$ is between 16 and 17. The ceiling of this value is $k=17$.\n\nNow, we can compute $V_{100000}$:\n$V_{100000} = 2 - \\frac{2}{2^{17}} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{16}}$.\n$2^{16} = (2^8)^2 = 256^2 = 65536$.\nSo, $V_{100000} = 2 - \\frac{1}{65536}$.\n\n**Step 4: Solve the inequality for M**\n\nWe must find the smallest positive integer $M$ such that $V_N \\le 2(1-10^{-M})$.\n$2 - \\frac{1}{65536} \\le 2(1 - 10^{-M})$.\nDivide by 2:\n$1 - \\frac{1}{2 \\cdot 65536} \\le 1 - 10^{-M}$.\n$1 - \\frac{1}{131072} \\le 1 - 10^{-M}$.\n$-\\frac{1}{131072} \\le -10^{-M}$.\nMultiply by -1 and reverse the inequality sign:\n$\\frac{1}{131072} \\ge 10^{-M}$.\nTake the reciprocal of both sides and reverse the inequality sign again:\n$131072 \\le 10^M$.\nNote that $131072 = 2^{17}$.\n$2^{17} \\le 10^M$.\n\nTo find the smallest integer $M$, we take the base-10 logarithm of both sides:\n$\\log_{10}(2^{17}) \\le \\log_{10}(10^M)$.\n$17 \\log_{10}(2) \\le M$.\n\nUsing the approximation $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$:\n$M \\ge 17 \\times 0.30103 = 5.11751$.\n\nSince $M$ must be a positive integer, the smallest integer value for $M$ that satisfies this condition is 6.\n\nTo check:\nFor $M=5$, $10^5 = 100000$, which is not greater than or equal to $131072$.\nFor $M=6$, $10^6 = 1000000$, which is greater than $131072$.\nThus, the smallest integer value for $M$ is 6."
