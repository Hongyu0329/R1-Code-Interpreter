    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for the name of a specific mushroom genus. The defining characteristic provided is that it is the *only* genus known to produce a \"distinctly blue spore print.\" A spore print is a key identification feature in mycology, created by allowing the spores from a mushroom's gills or pores to fall onto a surface, revealing their color in mass.\n\n**Step 2: Identify potential candidates and common misconceptions.**\nMany mushrooms have blue coloration on their caps, stems, or flesh, which can lead to confusion about their spore color. It's crucial to distinguish between the color of the mushroom's body and the color of its spore print.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: *Lactarius indigo***\n    *   **Analysis:** This is perhaps the most famous \"blue\" mushroom. When cut, its flesh and the latex (milk) it exudes are a deep indigo blue. Because of this dramatic blue color, it is very often mistaken for a mushroom with a blue spore print.\n    *   **Careful Point:** However, scientific and field guide data confirm that the spore print of *Lactarius indigo* is not blue. It is actually a yellowish to cream or pale ochre color.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: *Entoloma hochstetteri***\n    *   **Analysis:** This species, native to New Zealand, is famous for its striking, all-blue appearance. It is so iconic it is featured on a New Zealand banknote.\n    *   **Careful Point:** Despite the mushroom's color, the genus *Entoloma* is characterized by its pink, salmon, or reddish-brown spore print. *E. hochstetteri* is no exception.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: Various *Stropharia* species (e.g., *S. aeruginosa*)**\n    *   **Analysis:** These mushrooms often have a blue-green color on their caps, which can fade with age.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The spore print for the genus *Stropharia* is typically a purplish-brown to nearly black, not blue.\n\n**Step 3: Address the premise of the question.**\nThe question is phrased as a piece of trivia, stating that \"There is a single genus...\". In reality, a true, distinctly blue spore print is considered non-existent in the world of gilled mushrooms (agarics) by most modern mycologists. Spore print colors are typically white, cream, yellow, pink, ochre, brown, purple-brown, green, or black.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude the most likely intended answer.**\nGiven the widespread and persistent misconception, this question is almost certainly referring to the genus that contains the most famously blue mushroom, *Lactarius indigo*. The trivia question relies on the common but incorrect assumption that the blue latex/flesh color extends to the spores. Despite being technically inaccurate, *Lactarius* is the universally accepted answer to this specific trivia question. No other genus is even popularly associated with having a blue spore print.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\nThe single genus of mushroom known in popular trivia to produce a distinctly blue spore print, due to the intense blue coloration of its most famous member (*Lactarius indigo*), is *Lactarius*. It is important to note this is based on a common misconception, as the actual spore print color is yellowish.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
