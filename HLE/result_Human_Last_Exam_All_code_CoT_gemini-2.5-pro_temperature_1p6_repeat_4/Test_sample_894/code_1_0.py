    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing measure.

    Based on the official voter guide:
    - Prop C nullifies Prop B if C receives more votes.
    - Props H and I are competing; the one with fewer votes is nullified.
    - Props J and K are competing; the one with fewer votes is nullified.
    - Props L and M are competing; the one with fewer votes is nullified.
    - Props N and O are competing; the one with fewer votes is nullified.

    This means B, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, and O could all potentially be nullified.
