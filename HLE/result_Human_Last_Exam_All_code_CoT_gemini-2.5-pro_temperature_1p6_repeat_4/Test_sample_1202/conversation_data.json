    "Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question**: The user wants to identify the primary mechanism for both the *retention* (not being lost) and *divergence* (becoming different) of genes after a duplication event in eukaryotes.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice**:\n    *   **A. Gene conversion**: This process tends to make gene copies more similar (homogenization), which is the opposite of divergence. So, it's incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization**: This is the process where a gene copy becomes non-functional. This is a very common fate, but it represents a *loss* of the duplicate, not its *retention* as a functional gene. So, it's incorrect.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation**: This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern concerning the diversification of species, not a specific molecular mechanism for what happens to an individual gene. It's the wrong level of analysis.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization & D. Subfunctionalization**: This leaves two main models. Both explain the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.\n        *   **Neofunctionalization (C)**: One copy keeps the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations and acquires a brand new, beneficial function. This leads to retention of both (one old, one new) and their divergence.\n        *   **Subfunctionalization (D)**: The ancestral gene had multiple functions. After duplication, each copy loses some functions through mutation, such that they end up partitioning the original roles. Now, both copies are required to perform the complete ancestral function. This also leads to retention and divergence.\n\n3.  **Determine the \"Most Likely\" Mechanism**: The main challenge for a new gene duplicate is to avoid being silenced or lost (pseudogenization), as it is initially redundant.\n    *   **Neofunctionalization** requires a relatively rare event—a beneficial gain-of-function mutation—to occur before the redundant gene copy is lost.\n    *   **Subfunctionalization**, on the other hand, relies on much more common loss-of-function mutations. By 'partitioning' the original functions through this process, it creates a situation where both gene copies become necessary for survival. This provides a more passive and therefore potentially more common pathway for the initial *retention* of the duplicate gene.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Code**: I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning step-by-step and prints the final conclusion, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential fates of duplicated genes to determine the most likely\n    mechanism for their retention and divergence.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the mechanisms for duplicate gene retention and divergence:\\n\")\n\n    # Define the possible fates/mechanisms from the answer choices\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    # Explanation\n    explanation = {\n        'A': \"Incorrect. Gene conversion is a process that makes homologous DNA sequences more uniform. It promotes homogenization, not divergence.\",\n        'B': \"Incorrect. Pseudogenization is the most common fate, where one gene copy becomes non-functional. This is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention.\",\n        'E': \"Incorrect. Adaptive radiation is a macroevolutionary concept describing species diversification, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level.\",\n        'C vs D': textwrap.dedent(\"\"\"\n            This leaves two primary models for the retention and divergence of functional gene duplicates: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.\n\n            - C. Neofunctionalization: One gene copy retains the original function, while the other gains a completely new function.\n            - D. Subfunctionalization: The ancestral gene had multiple functions. The two copies specialize and partition these original functions between them. Both are now required.\n\n            The key challenge for a new duplicate is avoiding loss via pseudogenization while it's redundant. Subfunctionalization provides a powerful passive mechanism for this retention. It relies on common, degenerative mutations to make both copies necessary. Neofunctionalization relies on the rarer event of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation occurring before the gene is lost.\n\n            Therefore, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more pervasive or 'likely' mechanism for the crucial initial step of preserving both genes.\"\"\")\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Choice A ({choices['A']}): {explanation['A']}\")\n    print(f\"Choice B ({choices['B']}): {explanation['B']}\")\n    print(f\"Choice E ({choices['E']}): {explanation['E']}\\n\")\n    print(\"Evaluating the two main models (C and D):\")\n    print(explanation['C vs D'])\n\n    final_answer_letter = 'D'\n    final_answer_text = choices[final_answer_letter]\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50)\n    print(f\"Conclusion: Based on the analysis, subfunctionalization is considered a highly likely mechanism for the retention and subsequent divergence of duplicate genes.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: {final_answer_letter}. {final_answer_text}\")\n    print(\"=\"*50)\n\n# Execute the analysis\nanalyze_gene_duplication_fates()\n\n# The final answer is wrapped in <<<>>> as requested.\n# The code above provides the reasoning.\nprint(\"\\n<<<D>>>\")\n```"
