        'B': "Incorrect. Pseudogenization is the most common fate, where one gene copy becomes non-functional. This is a mechanism of gene loss, not retention.",
        'E': "Incorrect. Adaptive radiation is a macroevolutionary concept describing species diversification, not a molecular mechanism at the gene level.",

            This leaves two primary models for the retention and divergence of functional gene duplicates: Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization.

            - C. Neofunctionalization: One gene copy retains the original function, while the other gains a completely new function.
            - D. Subfunctionalization: The ancestral gene had multiple functions. The two copies specialize and partition these original functions between them. Both are now required.

            The key challenge for a new duplicate is avoiding loss via pseudogenization while it's redundant. Subfunctionalization provides a powerful passive mechanism for this retention. It relies on common, degenerative mutations to make both copies necessary. Neofunctionalization relies on the rarer event of a beneficial, gain-of-function mutation occurring before the gene is lost.

            Therefore, many evolutionary biologists argue that subfunctionalization is a more pervasive or 'likely' mechanism for the crucial initial step of preserving both genes.""")
