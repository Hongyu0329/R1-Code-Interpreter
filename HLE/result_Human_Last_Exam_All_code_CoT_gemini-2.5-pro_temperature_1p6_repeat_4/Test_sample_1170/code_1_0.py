    """
    Solves the tensor-triangulated geometry problem based on the reasoning above.

    The problem is interpreted under the assumption that the characteristic of the field k is p=2.
    This makes the number of prime tt-ideals finite, allowing for a definite answer as suggested
    by the prompt's format.

    The prime ideal generators are identified as:
    - Objects 1, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10 generate the generic prime of the representation-theoretic part of the spectrum.
    - Objects 5, 6 generate the single filiform prime (since p-1=1).
    - Object 15 generates the 'ghost' prime.

    All other objects do not generate prime ideals.
    Since all three primes for p=2 are generated by objects in the list, the number of ungenerated primes is 0.
