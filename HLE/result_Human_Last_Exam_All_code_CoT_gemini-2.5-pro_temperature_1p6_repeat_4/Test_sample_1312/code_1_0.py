    print("\n  - C (Transposable elements): These 'jumping genes' are often a source of new, and frequently harmful, mutations. They are not considered a protective mechanism.")

    print("\n  - D (Multigene families): By providing multiple copies of a gene, multigene families offer redundancy. If one copy is inactivated by a mutation, other functional copies can compensate. This is a plausible mechanism of compensation.")

    print("\n  - E (Polyploidy): This is the state of having more than two complete sets of chromosomes (e.g., 3n, 4n). This provides massive redundancy for the *entire genome*. A deleterious recessive mutation in one gene copy is likely to be masked by functional copies on the other homologous chromosomes. This is a powerful and well-documented buffer against the accumulation of harmful mutations and is strongly associated with the long-term success of many asexual plant and animal lineages.")
