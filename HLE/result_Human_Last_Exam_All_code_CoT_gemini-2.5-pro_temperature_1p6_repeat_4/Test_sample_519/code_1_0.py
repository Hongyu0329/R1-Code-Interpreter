    # stabilizers are on V(xy-zw). The quotient is therefore a scheme (S).
    # Separated (s): Yes, it's an open subscheme of a separated weighted projective space.
    # Universally Closed (uc): No, it is a non-trivial open subscheme, so not proper.
    # Irreducible (irr): Yes, it's a quotient of an irreducible variety.
    # Dimension: dim(A^4) - dim(C*) = 4 - 1 = 3.

    # Universally Closed (uc): No, it's an infinite disjoint union of components, so not quasi-compact.
