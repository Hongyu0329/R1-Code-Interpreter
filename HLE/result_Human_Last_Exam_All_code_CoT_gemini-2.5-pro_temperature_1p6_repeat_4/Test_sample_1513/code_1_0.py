    This function identifies the island town based on a set of geographical and naming constraints.

    The constraints are:
    1.  An island town.
    2.  > 500 km from another inhabited island.
    3.  Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.
    4.  The town and the bay share the same name.

    Analysis:
    - The town is Hanga Roa.
    - It is the capital of Easter Island (Rapa Nui), a territory of Chile.
    - The nearest inhabited land is Pitcairn Island, over 2,000 km away, satisfying the remoteness criteria.
    - The town sits on Hanga Roa Bay, on the protected west coast of the island.
    - Easter Island is of volcanic origin, with its shape dominated by three extinct volcanoes and their calderas.
    - Both the town and the bay it sits on are named Hanga Roa.
    
    Conclusion: Hanga Roa is the correct answer.
