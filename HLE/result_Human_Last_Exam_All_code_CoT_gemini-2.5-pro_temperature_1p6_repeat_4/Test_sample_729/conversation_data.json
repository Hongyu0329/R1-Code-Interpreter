    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  I will identify the group in question as the generalized quaternion group Q_128 and determine its standard presentation.\n2.  I will state the definition of a power subgroup.\n3.  I will analyze the types of subgroups that arise from calculating G^k = {g^k | g in G} for the group G = Q_128. This analysis will depend on the properties of the integer k.\n4.  Based on this analysis, I will systematically list all unique power subgroups.\n5.  Finally, I will sum up the number of unique subgroups found to get the final answer, and present the calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Group properties\ngroup_order = 128\n# Q_128 is the generalized quaternion group Q_{4n} with 4n = 128, so n = 32.\nn_param = 32\n# The order of the element x in the standard presentation is 2n.\norder_x = 2 * n_param\n\nprint(f\"The generalized quaternion group of size {group_order}, denoted Q_{group_order}, has the presentation:\")\nprint(f\"G = <x, y | x^{order_x} = 1, x^{n_param} = y^2, yx = x^-1 * y>\\n\")\nprint(\"A power subgroup H is a subgroup that can be written as H = G^k = {g^k | g in G} for some integer k.\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The distinct power subgroups are found by analyzing the set G^k for different types of k:\")\n\n# Case 1: k is odd\ncount_odd_k = 1\nprint(f\"1.
