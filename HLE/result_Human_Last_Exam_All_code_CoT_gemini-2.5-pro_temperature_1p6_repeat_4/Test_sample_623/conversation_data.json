    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Trace the Labeled Carbons**: I will start with a glucose molecule where the carbon atoms at positions 1 and 4 are the ¹³C isotope.\n2.  **Glycolysis Simulation**: I will follow this molecule through the steps of glycolysis. I'll pay close attention to the key cleavage step where the 6-carbon glucose is split into two 3-carbon molecules (DHAP and G3P), and the subsequent isomerization of DHAP to G3P. This will tell us where the ¹³C labels are located in the two resulting pyruvate molecules.\n3.  **CO₂ Release Step**: Glycolysis itself does not release CO₂. CO₂ is released in the next step, the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC). This reaction specifically removes the first carbon (C1, the carboxyl group) of pyruvate.\n4.  **Count the Labeled CO₂**: By checking which of the two pyruvate molecules has a ¹³C label at its C1 position, I can determine how many molecules of ¹³CO₂ are released.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps to find and display the final answer, including the equation for the total count.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trace_labeled_glucose():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces a 1,4-13C glucose molecule through glycolysis and pyruvate\n    decarboxylation to determine how many labeled CO2 molecules are released.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the initial labeled glucose molecule.\n    # The keys represent the carbon position in glucose.\n    # '13C' is the label, '12C' is the standard isotope.\n    glucose = {1: '13C', 2: '12C', 3: '12C', 4: '13C', 5: '12C', 6: '12C'}\n    print(\"Step 1: Start with 1,4-13C glucose.\")\n    print(f\"Glucose Carbon Labeling: C1={glucose[1]}, C4={glucose[4]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Glycolysis Part 1 - Cleavage\n    # The enzyme Aldolase cleaves the 6-carbon sugar into two 3-carbon sugars.\n    # DHAP (Dihydroxyacetone phosphate) gets carbons 1, 2, and 3 of glucose.\n    # G3P (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate) gets carbons 4, 5, and 6 of glucose.\n    dhap_from_glucose = {1: glucose[1], 2: glucose[2], 3: glucose[3]}\n    g3p_A_from_glucose = {1: glucose[4], 2: glucose[5], 3: glucose[6]}\n    print(\"Step 2: Glucose is cleaved into two 3-carbon molecules.\")\n    print(f\"-> Molecule 1 (DHAP) gets carbons C1,C2,C3.
