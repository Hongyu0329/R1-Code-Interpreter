    This function solves the logic puzzle by analyzing the statements

    # --- Step 1: Analyze the Statements ---
    # Statement S1: "My name is Fred; and if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday."
    # The premise "yesterday was after tomorrow" is a logical impossibility, meaning it is always False.
    # In classical logic, a conditional statement "if P, then Q" is always True if the premise P is False.
    # This is known as a "vacuous truth".
    # Therefore, the clause "if yesterday was after tomorrow, it would be Wednesday" is always True.
    # Given that "My name is Fred" is true (from the puzzle setup), the entire statement S1 is logically True.
    
    # Statement S5: "My best friend is older than me. He is 18 and I am 19."
    # This statement is self-contradictory. If Fred is 19 and his friend is 18, his friend is younger, not older.
    # Therefore, statement S5 is logically False.
    
    # --- Step 2: Apply Puzzle Conditions ---
    # The puzzle states: "Only one statement is true".
    # Since S1 is logically True and S5 is logically False, S1 must be the one true statement.
    # This implies S3 and S4 must be False.
    
    # The puzzle also states: "Fred said it [the true statement] on the day when he tells the truth."
    # This is consistent, as a truth-teller would say a true statement.

    # --- Step 3: Decode the True Statement ---
    # The statement S1 is always true, so Fred could say it on any of his truth-telling days.
    # This provides no way to distinguish the day unless there is a hidden meaning.
    # The key is to interpret the structure of the vacuous truth. It links a canonical falsehood
    # ("yesterday was after tomorrow") to a specific day ("Wednesday").
    # The most common interpretation in such puzzles is that this is a coded message, stating:
    # "The day of falsehood (my Lying Day) is Wednesday."

    # --- Step 4: Determine the Day ---
    # Since S1 is the one true statement, its decoded meaning must also be true.
    # Therefore, we can conclude that Fred's Lying Day is Wednesday.
    
    # The final question is: "Which day does Fred say the truth?"
    # This question is ambiguous. If Wednesday is the Lying Day, Fred tells the truth on the other six days.
    # However, given the multiple-choice format, the puzzle requires a single, specific day.
    # The only day uniquely identified through the logical process is Wednesday, which is named in the only true statement.
    
    final_answer_day = "Wednesday"
    
    # There is no numerical equation to solve in this puzzle. The instruction to output numbers in an equation
    # seems to be a template mismatch for this type of problem.
    # Instead, we will print the key part of the statement that reveals the answer.
    
    print("The only logically true statement is S1.")
    print("S1 contains a coded message linking a falsehood to a specific day.")
    print("The key part of the statement is: '...it would be Wednesday'")
    print(f"From this, we deduce the uniquely identified day is: {final_answer_day}")
