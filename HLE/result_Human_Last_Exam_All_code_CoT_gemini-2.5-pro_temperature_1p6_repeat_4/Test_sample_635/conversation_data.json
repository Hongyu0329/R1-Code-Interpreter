    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime, which means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. For polynomial matrices, this is equivalent to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all its $2 \\times 2$ minors being 1.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to derive the factorization:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation for the factorization.**\nWe are looking for $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$, which can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Let $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$.\nPlugging in $H(s)$, we get:\n$N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Step 2: Find conditions for N(s) to be a polynomial matrix.**\nFor $N(s)$ to be a matrix of polynomials, all its elements must be polynomials.\n- From the second column, $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n- The terms in the first column must also be polynomials. This requires the denominators to be cancelled out. Let's analyze the conditions on the entries of $D(s)$.\n  - For $N_{11}(s)$: $d_{11}(s)\\frac{(s-1)^2}{s^2-1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1}$ must be a polynomial. This implies that $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$. This gives two conditions:\n    1. At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$.\n    2. At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n  - Similarly, for $N_{21}(s)$, we get two conditions:\n    3. At $s=1$: $d_{22}(1)=0$.\n    4. At $s=-1$: $2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct a minimal polynomial matrix D(s).**\nWe seek the simplest polynomial solutions that satisfy the conditions from Step 2.\n- Let's try to set $d_{12}(s) = 0$. Condition 1 is satisfied. Condition 2 becomes $2d_{11}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{11}(s)$ must have a factor $(s+1)$. The simplest non-trivial choice is $d_{11}(s) = s+1$.\n- Let's try to set $d_{21}(s) = 1$. From condition 4, $2(1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$, so $d_{22}(-1) = -2$. Condition 3 requires $d_{22}(1) = 0$, so $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor $(s-1)$. Let's try the simplest form $d_{22}(s) = c(s-1)$. Using $d_{22}(-1)=-2$, we get $c(-1-1)=-2 \\implies -2c=-2 \\implies c=1$. So, $d_{22}(s) = s-1$.\nThis gives us a candidate for $D(s)$:\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate N(s) and verify the factorization.**\nUsing the $D(s)$ we found:\n$N(s) = D(s)H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n$N_{11}(s) = (s+1)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + 0 = s-1$\n$N_{12}(s) = (s+1) \\cdot 1 + 0 = s+1$\n$N_{21}(s) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1+2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1$\n$N_{22}(s) = 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 = 1$\nSo, $N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify coprimeness.**\nThe GCD of the $2 \\times 2$ minors of $[D(s) \\ N(s)]$ must be 1.\n$[D(s) \\ N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} s+1 & 0 & s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\nThe minors are:\n$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} s+1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & s-1 \\end{pmatrix} = s^2-1$\n$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} s-1 & s+1 \\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = (s-1) - (s+1) = -2$\nSince the set of minors includes a constant (-2), their greatest common divisor must be a constant (1 or 2). Another minor is $\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & s-1 \\\\ s-1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = -(s-1)^2$. Since the GCD must divide both -2 and $-(s-1)^2$, it must be 1.\nTherefore, the factorization is correct and coprime.\n\nThe following Python code defines the matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ and prints them.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_coprime_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function.\n    H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s)\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.symbols('s')\n\n    # The transfer function matrix H(s)\n    # H = sympy.Matrix([\n    #     [(s - 1) / (s + 1), 1],\n    #     [2 / (s**2 - 1), 0]\n    # ])\n\n    # Based on the derivation, the left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is found.\n    # We define the polynomial matrices D(s) and N(s).\n    D = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s + 1, 0],\n        [1, s - 1]\n    ])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([\n        [s - 1, s + 1],\n        [1, 1]\n    ])\n\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D)\n    \n    # We can represent the matrix as a list of lists for clear output of each element\n    # as requested.\n    d_list = D.tolist()\n    print(\"\\nEach number/expression in D(s):\")\n    for row in d_list:\n        print(row)\n\n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N)\n    \n    n_list = N.tolist()\n    print(\"\\nEach number/expression in N(s):\")\n    for row in n_list:\n        print(row)\n\n    # Verification (optional, for confidence)\n    # H_calc = D.inv() * N\n    # H_calc_simplified = sympy.simplify(H_calc)\n    # print(\"\\nVerification: D(s)^-1 * N(s) = \")\n    # sympy.pprint(H_calc_simplified)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_coprime_factorization()\n```\n<<<\nA left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\n\nD(s) =\n⎡s + 1    0  ⎤\n⎢            ⎥\n⎣  1    s - 1⎦\n\nEach number/expression in D(s):\n[s + 1, 0]\n[1, s - 1]\n\nN(s) =\n⎡s - 1  s + 1⎤\n⎢            ⎥\n⎣  1      1  ⎦\n\nEach number/expression in N(s):\n[s - 1, s + 1]\n[1, 1]\n>>>"
