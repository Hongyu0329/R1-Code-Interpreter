    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nThe function $p(x)$ is defined as:\n*   $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n*   $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x}$ for $3 \\le x \\le 5$\n\nSince the range of integration $[0, 4]$ spans across the point where the function definition changes ($x=3$), we must split the integral into two parts:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx $$\n\nThis translates to calculating the sum of two separate integrals:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1 + \\sin x)}{1 + \\cos x} dx $$\n\nI will write a Python script to compute these two integrals numerically using the `scipy.integrate.quad` function and then add them together to find the total value. The script will print the values of each integral part and the final sum.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the definite integral of a piecewise function p(x) from x=0 to x=4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the first part of the function for the interval [0, 3]\n    def p1(x):\n        return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\n    # Define the second part of the function for the interval [3, 5]\n    def p2(x):\n        # Use np functions for compatibility with scipy.integrate.quad\n        return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n    # Calculate the integral for the first part, from x = 0 to x = 3\n    integral_part1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n    # Calculate the integral for the second part, from x = 3 to x = 4\n    integral_part2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4)\n\n    # The total integral is the sum of the two parts\n    total_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n    # Print the final equation with the calculated values\n    print(\"The integral is calculated by splitting it into two parts based on the function definition:\")\n    print(f\"Total Integral = (Integral from 0 to 3) + (Integral from 3 to 4)\")\n    print(f\"Total Integral = {integral_part1:.4f} + ({integral_part2:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"Total Integral = {total_integral:.4f}\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n```\n<<<-397.5132>>>"
