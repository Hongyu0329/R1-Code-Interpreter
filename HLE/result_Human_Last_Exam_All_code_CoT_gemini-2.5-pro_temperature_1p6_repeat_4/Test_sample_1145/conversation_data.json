    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. The probability `P` is found by integrating the probability density, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that interval.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **State the Formula:** The normalized wave function `ψn(x)` for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is `sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx / a)`. The probability density is `|ψn(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)`.\n2.  **Set up the Integral:** The probability `P` of finding the particle between `x1 = 0.495a` and `x2 = 0.505a` for the quantum state `n = 2` is given by the integral:\n    `P = ∫[from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx / a) dx`\n3.  **Calculate the Integral:** We will use Python with the `scipy.integrate` library to numerically compute this definite integral. This is a robust and accurate method for such calculations.\n4.  **Present the Result:** The Python script will first print the equation being solved and then print the calculated probability. For the calculation, we can set the box length `a = 1` without loss of generality, as the probability is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy import integrate\n\ndef solve_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box in a specific interval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the quantum state and interval boundaries\n    n = 2\n    x1_factor = 0.495\n    x2_factor = 0.505\n    \n    # We can set the box length 'a' to 1 for simplicity, as it cancels out\n    # in the final dimensionless probability.\n    a = 1.0\n    x1 = x1_factor * a\n    x2 = x2_factor * a\n\n    # Define the probability density function, |ψ(x)|²\n    # |ψ(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx / a)\n    def probability_density(x, n_val, a_val):\n        return (2.0 / a_val) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / a_val))**2\n\n    # Perform the numerical integration\n    # The result is a tuple (integral_value, estimated_error)\n    prob, err = integrate.quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n    \n    # Print the equation and the final answer\n    print(\"The probability P of finding the particle in the 1D box is given by the integral of the probability density |ψn(x)|².\")\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the interval is from {x1_factor}a to {x2_factor}a.\")\n    print(f\"The equation to solve is:\")\n    print(f\"P = ∫ from {x1_factor}a to {x2_factor}a of (2/a) * sin²({n}πx/a) dx\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculated Probability:\")\n    print(prob)\n\nsolve_probability()\n<<<1.315538563388133e-05>>>\n```"
