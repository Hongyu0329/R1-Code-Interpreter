    "This is a knowledge-based question from the domain of game theory optimal (GTO) poker strategy. I will provide a brief explanation of the principles involved and then provide a Python script that states the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The situation is a 100 big blind (BB), rake-free No-Limit Hold'em cash game. You are on the button (BTN), the most powerful position, and are making a standard 2.5x open-raise.\n2.  **Button Opening Range:** The button opens the widest range of any position because you are guaranteed to be in position post-flop. In a rake-free environment, the range becomes even wider, as you don't need to overcome the house's cut to be profitable. Standard GTO strategies for this scenario advocate opening all suited Jack combinations.\n3.  **Define \"Worst\":** The \"worst\" hand to open is the one with the lowest Expected Value (EV) that is still considered a profitable (EV > 0) open-raise. We need to evaluate all suited Jack hands (JXs) from JKs down to J2s.\n4.  **Evaluate Suited Jacks:**\n    *   **Playability:** The value of these hands comes from their ability to make flushes, straights, and top pair.\n    *   **Kicker Problem:** The main weakness of low suited Jacks (like J2s, J3s, J4s, J5s) is that when you make a pair of Jacks, your kicker is very low, making you vulnerable to being out-kicked.\n    *   **Straight Potential:** As the lower card (the \"kicker\") decreases, the hand's ability to connect and form straights diminishes. J5s has more straight potential (connects with A,2,3,4) than J4s, J3s, or J2s.\n    *   **Conclusion:** J2s has the lowest kicker and the worst straight connectivity of all the suited Jacks. Therefore, it has the lowest EV and is the \"worst\" suited Jack that you should still open-raise from the button in this game.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game based on GTO principles.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # List of all suited Jack hands.\n    suited_jacks = [\"JAs\", \"JKs\", \"JQs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    \n    print(\"Poker Hand Analysis: Worst Suited Jack to Open from the Button\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n    print(\"Scenario: 100BB deep, Rake-Free, Open-raising from the Button (BTN).\")\n    print(\"\\nReasoning:\")\n    print(\"1.
