    "Of course, I can help you with this question from algebraic topology. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical objects**: The question asks for the connectivity of a map `α: Σ(ΩS⁴ ∧ ΩS⁶) → Ω(S⁴ ∧ S⁶)`. This involves concepts like spheres (`Sⁿ`), loop spaces (`ΩX`), smash products (`X ∧ Y`), and suspensions (`ΣX`).\n\n2.  **Define Connectivity**: The connectivity of a map `f: A → B` is the largest integer `k` such that the induced map on homotopy groups, `f_*: πᵢ(A) → πᵢ(B)`, is an isomorphism for all `i < k` and a surjection for `i = k`.\n\n3.  **Apply a specialized theorem**: Calculating the homotopy groups of the spaces involved and the map between them from first principles is a very advanced task. Instead, I will use a known theorem from homotopy theory. The map in question is a well-studied one, sometimes called the second evaluation map. For spaces `X` and `Y` that are suspensions (like spheres are), the connectivity of the map `Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y)` is given by the formula: `conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1`.\n\n4.  **Calculate Component Connectivities**: The connectivity of an `n`-sphere, `Sⁿ`, is `n-1`.\n    *   For `X = S⁴`, its connectivity is `4 - 1 = 3`.\n    *   For `Y = S⁶`, its connectivity is `6 - 1 = 5`.\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Result**: I will substitute these values into the formula to find the connectivity of the map.\n\n6.  **Code Implementation**: Finally, I will write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the result, including each number in the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\n# Set the dimensions of the two spheres from the problem.\nn1 = 4\nn2 = 6\n\n# The connectivity of an n-sphere S^n is (n-1).\n# This is because the first non-trivial homotopy group of S^n is π_n(S^n).\n# So π_i(S^n) is zero for i < n.\nconn_s_n1 = n1 - 1\nconn_s_n2 = n2 - 1\n\n# According to a theorem in homotopy theory, the connectivity of the map\n# Σ(ΩX ∧ ΩY) → Ω(X ∧ Y) for suspension spaces X and Y is given by\n# conn(X) + conn(Y) + 1.\n# Since S^4 and S^6 are suspensions (S^4 = ΣS^3, S^6 = ΣS^5), we can apply this formula.\nmap_connectivity = conn_s_n1 + conn_s_n2 + 1\n\n# Print the final equation with all its components.\nprint(f\"{conn_s_n1} + {conn_s_n2} + 1 = {map_connectivity}\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
