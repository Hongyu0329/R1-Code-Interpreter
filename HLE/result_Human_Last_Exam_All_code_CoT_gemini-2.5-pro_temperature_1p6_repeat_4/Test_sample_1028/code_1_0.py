    print("When fitting a birth-death model with time-varying speciation (λ(t)) and extinction (μ(t)) rates on a phylogeny containing only living (extant) species, a fundamental identifiability issue arises. This means that different combinations of λ(t) and μ(t) can lead to the exact same probability of observing the given phylogeny. We cannot distinguish these scenarios using only the data from extant species. The core issue is that only the 'net' effect of speciation and extinction on the surviving lineages is observed.")

Highly flexible functions like high-degree polynomials create a much larger set of possible rate trajectories that could fit the data. This makes the identifiability problem worse, not better, as it provides more ways for different λ(t) and μ(t) to yield the same likelihood.")
