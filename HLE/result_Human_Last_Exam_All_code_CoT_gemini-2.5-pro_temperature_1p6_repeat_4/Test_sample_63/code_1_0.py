# The riddle presents two clues: a reference by Kurt Vonnegut and a name pattern.
# 1. The Kurt Vonnegut quote from "Slaughterhouse-Five" points to composer Charles Ives.
# 2. However, "Charles Ives" does not fit the pattern of two words starting with the same letter.
# 3. This suggests looking for a similar figure who does fit the name pattern.
# 4. Béla Bartók was a 20th-century modernist composer, like Ives, often pictured with spiky hair.
# 5. His name, "Béla Bartók," fits the "two words starting with the same letter" rule.

first_word = "Béla"
second_word = "Bartók"

print(f"{first_word} {second_word}")
