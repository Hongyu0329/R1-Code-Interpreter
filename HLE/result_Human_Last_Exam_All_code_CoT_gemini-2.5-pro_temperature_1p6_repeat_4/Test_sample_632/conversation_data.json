    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe user wants me to answer a historical trivia question. Since the question is not a calculation problem, I will use the requested python code block to print the answer to the question clearly.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research the history of the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome, specifically focusing on changes made around 1950.\n2.  Identify the specific \"unique architectural feature\" that was removed by the city administration during that period.\n3.  Write a Python script that uses the `print()` function to state the answer.\n4.  Provide the final answer in the requested format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical trivia question\n    about the Piazza della Rotonda in Rome.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature = \"The tramway tracks\"\n    context = \"Until the post-WWII era, an extensive tram network ran through the center of Rome, with tracks passing directly through the Piazza della Rotonda. As part of a city-wide transportation modernization effort, these tracks were removed by the city administration.\"\n    \n    # Print the answer to the user's question\n    print(f\"The unique feature removed from the Piazza della Rotonda was: {feature}\")\n    print(f\"Historical Context: {context}\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<The tramway tracks>>>"
