    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we can use a well-established formula from the theory of topological quantum codes.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the properties of a single patch.** A \"patch of surface code with two holes\" is a planar surface. In topology, a planar surface has a genus `g=0`. It has one outer boundary and two inner boundaries created by the holes, making for a total of `b=3` boundaries.\n2.  **Use the formula for logical qubits.** The number of logical qubits `k` that can be stored on a surface with genus `g` and `b` boundaries is given by the formula: `k = 2g + b - 1`.\n3.  **Calculate `k` for a single patch.** Substitute `g=0` and `b=3` into the formula to find the number of logical qubits for one patch.\n4.  **Calculate the total `k`.** Since we have two identical and separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the qubits from each patch.\n5.  **Generate Python code.** Create a Python script that implements this calculation and prints the steps and the final result.\n\nThis approach is equivalent to a simpler rule for planar codes: the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes (`k=h`). This is because for a planar patch (`g=0`) with `h` holes, the number of boundaries `b` is `h+1`, so the formula becomes `k = 2*0 + (h+1) - 1 = h`.\n\n```python\ndef solve_logical_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters of the problem\n    num_patches = 2\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n    \n    # For a planar surface code patch (genus g=0), the number of logical qubits (k)\n    # is equal to the number of holes (h).\n    # This comes from the general formula k = 2g + b - 1,\n    # where g=0 (planar) and b = h + 1 (number of boundaries).\n    # So, k = 2*0 + (h + 1) - 1 = h.\n    k_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n    \n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all independent patches.\n    total_k = num_patches * k_per_patch\n    \n    print(f\"Configuration:\")\n    print(f\"Number of separate surface code patches: {num_patches}\")\n    print(f\"Number of holes in each patch: {num_holes_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Calculation per patch:\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits per patch = Number of holes per patch\")\n    print(f\"Logical qubits per patch = {k_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"Total Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = (Number of patches) * (Logical qubits per patch)\")\n    # Final equation as requested\n    print(f\"Total logical qubits = {num_patches} * {k_per_patch} = {total_k}\")\n\nsolve_logical_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
