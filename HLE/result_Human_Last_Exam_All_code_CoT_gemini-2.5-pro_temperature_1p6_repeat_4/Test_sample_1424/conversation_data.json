    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ within the Feynman path integral formalism, followed by the code to present the final answer.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Start with the Path Integral Formalism**: In quantum many-body theory, the properties of a system can be derived from its action, $S$. The bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of interactions and is derived from the non-interacting part of the action, $S_0$.\n\n2.  **Define the Non-Interacting Action**: For a system of non-interacting fermions, the action in imaginary time ($\\tau$) and momentum ($k$) space is given by:\n    $S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\n    Here, $\\psi_k$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_k$ are Grassmann fields representing the fermions, $\\beta$ is the inverse temperature, and $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy eigenvalue for momentum state $k$ (measured relative to the chemical potential).\n\n3.  **Transform to Frequency Space**: The dependence is most clearly expressed in frequency space. We perform a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to fermionic Matsubara frequencies $i\\omega_n = i(2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$. In this basis, the time derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes $-i\\omega_n$, and the action becomes a simple algebraic expression:\n    $S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\n4.  **Find the Green's Function**: The Green's function is defined as the expectation value $G_0(k, \\tau) = -\\langle \\mathcal{T}_\\tau \\psi_k(\\tau)\\bar{\\psi}_k(0)\\rangle$. In a path integral formalism with a quadratic action (like $S_0$), the Green's function is simply the inverse of the operator found between the fields in the action.\n    The \"operator\" or kernel for a given $(k, n)$ mode is $(-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k)$. The standard definition of the Green's function in frequency space yields:\n    $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$\n\n5.  **State the Functional Dependence**: This final expression explicitly shows the functional dependence. The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to the difference between the Matsubara frequency energy ($i\\omega_n$) and the single-particle energy eigenvalue ($\\epsilon_k$).\n\nThe following Python code will print this final equation.\n\n```python\ndef green_function_dependence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function displays the equation for the bare Green's function G_0,\n    highlighting its functional dependence on the single-particle energy ϵ_k.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the components of the equation as strings for a clear symbolic representation.\n    green_function = \"G_0(k, iω_n)\"\n    numerator = 1\n    frequency_variable = \"iω_n\"\n    energy_eigenvalue = \"ϵ_k\"\n\n    # Print the equation that shows the final result.\n    # The instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\" is satisfied\n    # by explicitly printing the number 1 in the numerator.\n    print(\"In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function's dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue is:\")\n    print(f\"{green_function} = {numerator} / ({frequency_variable} - {energy_eigenvalue})\")\n    print(\"\\nWhere:\")\n    print(f\"  {green_function}: The bare Green's function in momentum (k) and Matsubara frequency (iω_n) space.\")\n    print(f\"  {numerator}: The number one.\")\n    print(f\"  {frequency_variable}: The complex frequency variable.\")\n    print(f\"  {energy_eigenvalue}: The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis shows an inverse relationship between the bare Green's function and the single-particle energy eigenvalue.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result.\ngreen_function_dependence()\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is given by the equation $G_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - \\epsilon_k}$. This shows that the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the complex frequency variable $i\\omega_n$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
