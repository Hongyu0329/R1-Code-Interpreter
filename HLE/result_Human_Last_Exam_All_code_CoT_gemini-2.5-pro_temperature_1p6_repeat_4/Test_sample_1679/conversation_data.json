    "To answer this question, I will follow a clear plan:\n1.  First, I will identify the locations of the two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and the other in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  Next, I will compile a chronological list of the early Academy Award for Best Picture winners.\n3.  Then, I will research the setting and notable scenes of each film on this list to determine if either obelisk is depicted on-screen. Since early Hollywood films were more likely to feature Paris than Luxor, Egypt, the search will focus on films set in Paris.\n4.  I will encode this research data into a Python script. The script will iterate through the winners chronologically and identify the very first film that meets the criterion.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the title and year of this film as the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_first_winner_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n    \n    This function contains a data set based on film history research.
