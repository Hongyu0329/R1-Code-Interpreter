def solve_topology_problem():
    """
    This function solves the given topology problem by identifying the space X.

    Let X be a compact topological space and R be the long ray [0, \omega_1).

    The problem states two properties for X:
    1. X contains a dense copy of R.
       This means X is a 'compactification' of R.

    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> \mathbb{R} extends to a unique
       continuous function F: X -> \mathbb{R}.
       This is the 'universal property' that defines the Stone-Čech compactification.

    A space Y is Tychonoff if for any closed set C and a point p not in C,
    there is a continuous function from Y to [0, 1] that is 0 on p and 1 on C.
    The long ray R is a Tychonoff space.

    For any Tychonoff space Y, its Stone-Čech compactification, denoted as \beta Y,
    is a compact Hausdorff space that satisfies exactly the two properties given
    for X with respect to Y.

    The Stone-Čech compactification is unique up to a homeomorphism. This means
    that if X_1 and X_2 are two spaces satisfying the given properties for R,
    then X_1 and X_2 must be homeomorphic to each other. They both must be
    homeomorphic to \beta R.

    Therefore, all such spaces X belong to the same homeomorphism class.
    The number of distinct homeomorphism classes is 1.

    number_of_classes = 1
    
    # The final equation is simply the result of our deduction.
    # We print the number as requested.
