    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved with a recursive algorithm.\n\n### Plan\n\nLet a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan (or square) lattice, starting from the origin (0,0). A self-avoiding walk is a path on a grid that does not visit the same point more than once. We want to find a(10).\n\nTo solve this, we will count all possible valid paths of length 10. A brute-force enumeration can be implemented efficiently using a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Define a recursive function `count_walks(steps_left, position, path)`**: This function will count the number of valid walks from the current `position`, given the number of `steps_left` and the `path` taken so far (represented as a set of visited coordinates for efficient lookup).\n2.  **Base Case**: If `steps_left` is 0, it means we have successfully formed a complete self-avoiding walk of the desired length. We count this as one valid walk by returning 1.\n3.  **Recursive Step**: From the current position `(x, y)`, we try to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each potential next position, we check if it has already been visited (i.e., if it's in our `path`).\n    *   If it has not been visited, we add it to the path and recursively call our function for this new position with one fewer step remaining.\n    *   We sum the results returned from these valid recursive calls.\n    *   After a recursive call returns, we \"backtrack\" by removing the position from the path. This allows the exploration of other potential walks that don't include that specific move.\n4.  **Symmetry Optimization**: The lattice is symmetrical. The number of walks that start by moving right is identical to the number of walks starting by moving left, up, or down. Therefore, we can calculate the number of walks for just one initial direction (e.g., right, to position `(1,0)`) and multiply the result by 4 to get the total `a(10)`. This optimization significantly speeds up the computation.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Our main program will calculate the number of 9-step walks starting from `(1,0)` (with `(0,0)` already visited) and then multiply this by 4 to get `a(10)`.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D lattice.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set a higher recursion limit for deep recursive calls. n=10 is not too\n    # deep, but this is good practice for this type of problem.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n    memo = {}\n\n    def count_walks(steps_left, x, y, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n        Uses a tuple of sorted visited points as a key for memoization,\n        but symmetry breaking in the main function is the primary optimization.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        count = 0\n        # Define the four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]  # Up, Down, Right, Left\n\n        # Explore each possible move from the current position (x, y).\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n\n            # If the next position has not been visited yet...\n            if (next_x, next_y) not in visited:\n                # ...explore from there.\n                visited.add((next_x, next_y))\n                count += count_walks(steps_left - 1, next_x, next_y, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the position to allow exploration of other paths.\n                visited.remove((next_x, next_y))\n        \n        return count\n\n    # The number of steps for the walk.\n    n = 10\n\n    # Optimization: Due to grid symmetry, we calculate the walks for one\n    # initial direction and multiply by 4.\n    # We'll calculate for an initial step to the right: (0,0) -> (1,0).\n    # This means we need to find the number of 9-step walks starting from (1,0).\n    \n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    first_step_pos = (1, 0)\n    \n    # The path starts with the origin and the first step already visited.\n    initial_visited = {start_pos, first_step_pos}\n    steps_remaining = n - 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of walks for one initial direction.\n    walks_one_direction = count_walks(steps_remaining, first_step_pos[0], first_step_pos[1], initial_visited)\n    \n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this value.\n    total_walks = 4 * walks_one_direction\n    \n    print(\"Let a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\")\n    print(f\"To find a({n}), we use a recursive backtracking algorithm with a symmetry optimization.\")\n    print(\"Total walks a(n) = 4 * (number of walks starting with a step in one direction, e.g., right).\")\n    print(f\"Number of {n-1}-step walks from (1,0) with (0,0) already visited: {walks_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: a({n}) = 4 * {walks_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"Result: a({n}) = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
