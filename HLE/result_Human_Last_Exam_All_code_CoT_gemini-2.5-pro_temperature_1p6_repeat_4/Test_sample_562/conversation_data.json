    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the radical for the character 謄:\n1.  First, I will analyze the structure of the Kanji character 謄.\n2.  I will identify the radical, which is the foundational component of the character, used for indexing in dictionaries. For 謄, the radical is 言.\n3.  This radical 言 is located on the left side of the character. A radical on the left side is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n4.  The specific name for the 言 radical when it's on the left is ごんべん (gonben).\n5.  Finally, I will transcribe ごんべん into Hepburn romanization, which is \"Gonben\".\nI will now generate a Python script to present this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name(character):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the Hepburn transcription of the radical name for a given Kanji character.\n    This function uses a predefined dictionary for the lookup.\n    \"\"\"\n    kanji_radical_database = {\n        '謄': {\n            'radical_char': '言',\n            'radical_name_japanese': 'ごんべん',\n            'radical_name_hepburn': 'Gonben'\n        },\n        '媛': {\n            'radical_char': '女',\n            'radical_name_japanese': 'おんなへん',\n            'radical_name_hepburn': 'Onnahen'\n        }\n    }\n\n    if character in kanji_radical_database:\n        info = kanji_radical_database[character]\n        print(f\"The radical (bushu) in the character '{character}' is '{info['radical_char']}'.\")\n        print(f\"Its common name is {info['radical_name_japanese']}.\")\n        print(f\"The Hepburn transcription is: {info['radical_name_hepburn']}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Sorry, the radical for '{character}' is not in the database.\")\n\n# The character in question is '謄'.\nfind_radical_name('謄')\n\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
