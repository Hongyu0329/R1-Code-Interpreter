    "To compute the determinant of the given matrix, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I will represent the provided 3x3 matrix `A` using Python's `numpy` library, which is the standard tool for numerical and matrix operations.\n2.  The problem asks for the determinant of matrix `A`. The information about the \"Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\" is context for the origin of the matrix but is not required for the calculation itself, as the matrix is explicitly given.\n3.  I will calculate the determinant using the standard formula for a 3x3 matrix (also known as the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion):\n    det([[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n4.  The Python script will print the final equation showing how each number from matrix `A` is placed into this formula.\n5.  Finally, the script will compute and print the result of this equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The problem provides the adjacency matrix A.\nA = np.array([\n    [2, -1, -1],\n    [-1, 2, -1],\n    [-1, -1, 2]\n])\n\n# We need to compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.\n# Let's assign the elements to variables for clarity, following the standard formula:\n# | a b c |\n# | d e f |\n# | g h i |\na, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\nd, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\ng, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n# The determinant formula is: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\n# Let's perform the calculation.\ndeterminant = a * (e * i - f * h) - b * (d * i - f * g) + c * (d * h - e * g)\n\n# As requested, we will print the equation with all the numbers from the matrix.\nprint(f\"To compute the determinant of the matrix:\\n{A}\\n\")\nprint(\"We use the formula: det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the numbers into the equation gives:\")\n# This line prints the full equation with every number from the matrix.\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a}) * (({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b}) * (({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c}) * (({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n\n# Show the step-by-step simplification of the equation.\nterm1 = e * i - f * h\nterm2 = d * i - f * g\nterm3 = d * h - e * g\nprint(f\"det(A) = ({a})*({term1}) - ({b})*({term2}) + ({c})*({term3})\")\n\nterm1_val = a * term1\nterm2_val = b * term2\nterm3_val = c * term3\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1_val} - ({term2_val}) + ({term3_val})\")\n\nprint(f\"det(A) = {term1_val + (-1 * term2_val) + term3_val}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final determinant is: {determinant}\")\n```\n<<<0>>>"
