    "This is a fascinating question of alternative history and linguistics. To determine what the word \"sister\" would be without Norse influence, we need to trace the original Anglo-Saxon word through the natural sound changes that occurred in the English language.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Source:** The current word, \"sister,\" comes from Old Norse *systir*. This replaced the native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word.\n2.  **Find the Original:** The original Old English word was *sweostor*.\n3.  **Trace its Evolution:** I will track how *sweostor* would have likely changed into Middle English. A very common form was *suster*.\n4.  **Apply Modern English Sound Changes:** I will then apply the known sound changes (like the one that turned Middle English *sunne* into *sun*) to the Middle English form *suster* to project its modern-day equivalent.\n5.  **Final Prediction:** Based on these steps, the predicted word would be *suster* (pronounced to rhyme with \"duster\").\n\nHere is a Python script that walks through this linguistic reasoning to arrive at the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_native_english_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function traces the hypothetical evolution of the Old English word for \"sister\"\n    to determine what its Modern English form would be without Norse influence.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the current word and its non-native origin.\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n    norse_origin = \"systir\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing the word '{current_word}':\")\n    print(f\"- The current word was borrowed directly from the Old Norse '{norse_origin}' during the Viking Age.\")\n    print(\"- To find the native word, we must ignore this borrowing and look back to Old English.\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    print(f\"Finding the native root:\")\n    print(f\"- The original Old English word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"- This is a cognate of German 'Schwester' and Dutch 'zuster'.\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Trace the likely linguistic evolution to Modern English.\n    middle_english_form = \"suster\"\n    predicted_word = \"suster\"\n    print(\"Projecting the evolution without Norse influence:\")\n    print(f\"- Old English '{old_english_word}' would have naturally simplified.\")\n    print(f\"- By the Middle English period, a very common form was '{middle_english_form}'.\")\n    print(f\"- The short 'u' sound in '{middle_english_form}' would follow the same path as the 'u' in 'sunu' (son) or 'lufu' (love).\")\n    print(\"- This vowel sound would become the modern /ÊŒ/ sound (the 'uh' in 'duster').\")\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*50 + \"\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: State the final conclusion.\n    print(\"Conclusion:\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, had the Norse never invaded, the Modern English word for '{current_word}'\")\n    print(\"would most likely be:\")\n    print(f\"\\n>>> {predicted_word}\")\n\n\n# Run the analysis\nfind_native_english_word()\n```\n<<<suster>>>"
