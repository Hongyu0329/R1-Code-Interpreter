    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering rotational equivalences. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using Burnside's Lemma, which is used to count the number of orbits of a set under a group action.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Set of Diagrams:** From knot theory literature, it is known that the trefoil knot (`3_1`) has a minimal grid number of 3. There are a total of 6 such diagrams, 3 corresponding to the right-hand trefoil and 3 to the left-hand trefoil. We will focus on the 3 diagrams for the left-hand trefoil. While the specific conventions can be complex, a consistent set of permutations representing these diagrams is `{ [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [3,2,1] }`.\n2.  **Identify the Group Action:** The problem asks for equivalence \"up to rotation.\" For a square grid, the group of rotations is the cyclic group `C4`, which consists of four rotations: 0° (identity), 90°, 180°, and 270°. We need to define how these rotations transform a grid diagram (represented by a permutation).\n3.  **Apply Burnside's Lemma:** The number of distinct diagrams (orbits) is given by the formula:\n    `Number of Orbits = (1 / |G|) * Σ |X^g|` for all `g` in `G`.\n    - `G` is the rotation group `C4`, so `|G| = 4`.\n    - `X` is the set of the 3 left-hand trefoil diagrams.\n    - `|X^g|` is the number of diagrams in `X` that are left unchanged (are fixed points) by the rotation `g`.\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to:\n    - Define the set `X` of the 3 permutations.\n    - Implement the functions for 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations on a permutation.\n    - For each rotation `g`, count how many permutations `p` in `X` satisfy `g(p) = p`.\n    - Sum these counts and divide by 4 to get the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_inverse_permutation(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inverse = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inverse[val - 1] = i + 1\n    return inverse\n\ndef rotate_90(p):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 90-degree clockwise rotation to a permutation grid.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    p_inv = get_inverse_permutation(p)\n    # The new permutation p' is defined by p'(j) = n + 1 - p_inv(j)\n    new_p = [n + 1 - p_inv[j - 1] for j in range(1, n + 1)]\n    return new_p\n\ndef rotate_180(p):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 180-degree rotation to a permutation grid.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    # The new permutation p' is defined by p'(j) = n + 1 - p(n + 1 - j)\n    new_p = [n + 1 - p[n - j] for j in range(1, n + 1)]\n    return new_p\n\ndef rotate_270(p):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 270-degree clockwise rotation to a permutation grid.\"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    p_inv = get_inverse_permutation(p)\n    # The new permutation p' is defined by p'(j) = p_inv(n + 1 - j)\n    new_p = [p_inv[n - j] for j in range(1, n + 1)]\n    return new_p\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem using Burnside's Lemma.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From literature, there are 3 minimal (n=3) grid diagrams for the\n    # left-hand trefoil knot.
