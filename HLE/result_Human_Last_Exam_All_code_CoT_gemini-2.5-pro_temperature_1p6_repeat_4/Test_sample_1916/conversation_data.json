    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct structures a category can have, given that it contains exactly one object and three morphisms. Such categories are equivalent to monoids of size three. Let's break down why.\n\n**Step 1: From a 1-Object Category to a Monoid**\n\n*   A category has objects and morphisms. With only one object, let's call it `X`, all morphisms must start and end at `X`. These are called endomorphisms.\n*   Let the three morphisms be `f`, `g`, and `h`.\n*   Every category must have an identity morphism for each object. So, one of our three morphisms must be the identity, `id_X`. Let's assume `f = id_X` without loss of generality. The set of morphisms is `{id_X, g, h}`.\n*   In any category, composition of morphisms is defined and must be associative. For a single-object category, the composition of any two endomorphisms results in another endomorphism.\n*   The set of endomorphisms `{id_X, g, h}` combined with the composition operation forms a **monoid**. The identity morphism `id_X` is the identity element of the monoid.\n\n**Step 2: Counting Non-Isomorphic Monoids of Size 3**\n\nThe problem is now equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3. A monoid is defined by its multiplication table. Let the elements be `e` (identity), `a`, and `b`. The structure is determined by the four products: `a*a`, `a*b`, `b*a`, and `b*b`. Each of these can be `e`, `a`, or `b`, leading to `3^4 = 81` possible tables.\n\nWe need to filter these 81 tables to keep only those that satisfy the associative property: `(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)`.\n\nThen, we must group the valid, associative monoids by isomorphism. Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by relabeling the non-identity elements. In our case, this means we check if swapping the roles of `a` and `b` in one monoid's multiplication table can produce the table of another.\n\n**Step 3: A Programmatic Solution**\n\nWe can write a Python script to perform this search exhaustively. The script will:\n1.  Represent the monoid elements as `0` (for `e`), `1` (for `a`), and `2` (for `b`).\n2.  Iterate through all `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements.\n3.  For each table, check if the associative law holds.\n4.  For each valid monoid, determine its canonical representation. The canonical form is chosen as the lexicographically smaller of the monoid's table and the table obtained by swapping elements `1` and `2`.\n5.  Count the number of unique canonical forms. This count is our final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_monoid_isomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic monoids of size 3.\n\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of categories with one object and\n    three morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n    A monoid {e, a, b} with e as identity is defined by the 4 products:\n    a*a, a*b, b*a, b*b.\n    Each product can result in e, a, or b. We use 0, 1, 2 to represent them.\n\n    The method is as follows:\n    1. Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible multiplication tables.\n    2. Check each for associativity.\n    3. For each valid monoid, find its canonical form to handle isomorphisms.\n       An isomorphism can swap the two non-identity elements. The canonical\n       form is the lexicographically smaller of the original table and the\n       swapped one.\n    4.
