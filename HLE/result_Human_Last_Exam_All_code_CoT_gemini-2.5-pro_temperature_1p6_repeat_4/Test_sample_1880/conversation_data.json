    "To find the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a systematic procedure.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** First, we must determine if the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We will use Eisenstein's criterion for this. An irreducible quartic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$ will have a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The nature of the Galois group is closely tied to the discriminant of the polynomial. We will calculate $\\Delta$ and check if it is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$. If $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square, the Galois group is not a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n\n3.  **Find the Resolvent Cubic:** We will construct the resolvent cubic polynomial associated with our quartic. The reducibility of this cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ provides crucial information to narrow down the possible Galois groups.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** We will check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. If it has a rational root, it is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n5.  **Determine the Galois Group and its Order:** By combining the information from the irreducibility of $P(x)$, the nature of the discriminant $\\Delta$, and the reducibility of the resolvent cubic, we can uniquely identify the Galois group and thus determine its order.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the necessary calculations and print out each step of this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + px + q\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility of the polynomial.\")\n    print(\"We use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p=2:\")\n    print(\" - The prime 2 divides the coefficients 0 (for x^3), 0 (for x^2), 8 (for x), and 14 (constant term).\")\n    print(\" - The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(f\" - The square of the prime, 2^2 = 4, does not divide the constant term {q}.\")\n    print(\"Conclusion: The polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (Δ) of the polynomial.\")\n    print(\"For a depressed quartic x^4 + px + q, the discriminant formula is Δ = -27*p^4 + 256*q^3.\")\n    delta_val = -27 * (p**4) + 256 * (q**3)\n    print(f\"Δ = -27 * ({p}^4) + 256 * ({q}^3)\")\n    print(f\"Δ = -27 * {p**4} + 256 * {q**3}\")\n    print(f\"Δ = {-27 * p**4} + {256 * q**3} = {delta_val}\")\n\n    # Check if delta is a perfect square\n    sqrt_delta_float = math.sqrt(delta_val)\n    is_square = (int(sqrt_delta_float) ** 2 == delta_val)\n    \n    print(f\"The square root of Δ is approx {sqrt_delta_float:.3f}.\")\n    if is_square:\n        print(\"Conclusion: Δ is a perfect square.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Conclusion: Δ is not a perfect square.
