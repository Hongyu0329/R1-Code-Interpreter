# The problem is a non-computational one from descriptive set theory.
# The reasoning outlined above shows that the smallest possible cardinality
# of the specified set is the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as 'c' or 2^{\aleph_0}.
# We will represent this value symbolically.

# The equation for the cardinality |G| is: |G| = 2^{\aleph_0}}
base = 2
power_base = "aleph"
power_index = 0

# Print the symbolic representation of the cardinality
print(f"The smallest possible cardinality is a cardinal number represented by the expression: {base}^({power_base}_{power_index})")
print("This value is also known as the cardinality of the continuum.")

# As per the prompt's request to output numbers from the final equation.
# The numbers in the expression 2^{\aleph_0} are 2 and 0.
print("\nThe numbers appearing in the expression are:")
