# The problem is to find the asymptotic behavior of h_k as k goes to infinity.
# The quantity to calculate is lim_{k->inf} (ln(h_k) / ln(k)).

# Based on theoretical arguments from potential theory and random walks, we derived that
# h_k has the asymptotic behavior h_k ~ C / (k^4 * log(k)) for some constant C.
#
# Let's verify what the limit is under this assumption.
# ln(h_k) ~ ln(C / (k^4 * ln(k)))
# ln(h_k) ~ ln(C) - ln(k^4) - ln(ln(k))
# ln(h_k) ~ ln(C) - 4*ln(k) - ln(ln(k))
#
# Now we compute the ratio ln(h_k) / ln(k):
# (ln(h_k) / ln(k)) ~ (ln(C) - 4*ln(k) - ln(ln(k))) / ln(k)
# (ln(h_k) / ln(k)) ~ ln(C)/ln(k) - 4 - ln(ln(k))/ln(k)
#
# As k -> infinity:
# ln(C)/ln(k) -> 0
# ln(ln(k))/ln(k) -> 0
#
# So, the limit is -4.
