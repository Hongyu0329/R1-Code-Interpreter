    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, we can use a well-known formula from Gromov's work in geometric group theory and topology.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the relevant formula:** The simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces, $\\Sigma_{g_1}$ and $\\Sigma_{g_2}$, for genera $g_1, g_2 \\ge 1$, is given by:\n    $||\\Sigma_{g_1} \\times \\Sigma_{g_2}|| = 6 \\cdot |\\chi(\\Sigma_{g_1}) \\cdot \\chi(\\Sigma_{g_2})|$\n    where $\\chi(\\Sigma_g)$ is the Euler characteristic of the surface of genus $g$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Euler Characteristics:** The Euler characteristic of a closed oriented surface of genus $g$ is given by the formula $\\chi(\\Sigma_g) = 2 - 2g$. We will apply this for $g_1 = 31$ and $g_2 = 17$.\n\n3.  **Compute the Final Value:** We will substitute the calculated Euler characteristics into the simplicial volume formula to get the final result.\n\n4.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be provided to perform these calculations and print the steps, including the final equation with all the numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_simplicial_volume_product_surfaces(g1, g2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the simplicial volume of the product of two closed oriented surfaces.\n\n    Args:\n        g1 (int): The genus of the first surface.\n        g2 (int): The genus of the second surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    if g1 < 1 or g2 < 1:\n        print(\"The formula is valid for genera g1, g2 >= 1.\")\n        # For g=0, ||S^2||=0.
