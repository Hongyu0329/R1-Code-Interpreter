    Solves the Gauss class number problem for class number 48.
    
    The problem asks for the number of negative fundamental discriminants `d`
    for which the class number `h(d)` of the imaginary quadratic field Q(sqrt(d))
    is equal to a given integer `n`.
    
    This is a computationally hard problem. The results for class numbers up to
    100 are known from the extensive work of mathematician Mark Watkins. This script
