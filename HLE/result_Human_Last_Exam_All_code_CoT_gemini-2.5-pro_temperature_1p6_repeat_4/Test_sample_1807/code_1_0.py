    # Final Fst calculation
    # A standard formulation for X-chromosome Fst is Fst = 1 / (4Nm + 1) where N is effective size and m is sex-specific migration
    # which is not what we are calculating here.
    # We are treating sexes as populations. A more modern Fst estimator would be required for accuracy,
    # but the key insight is that the structural difference *creates* differentiation.
    # Let's use a simplified formulation to demonstrate the principle, acknowledging it's an approximation.
    
    # Weir and Cockerham's Fst is more appropriate but complex. Let's explain conceptually.
    # The very fact that males can't be heterozygous (Hs=0) while females can be (Hs>0)
    # creates a structural difference between the "populations" of males and females.
    # This difference in expected heterozygosity is a form of differentiation that Fst measures.
    
    # For a marker on the Y chromosome, p_male = 1, p_female = 0. Fst would be 1.
    # For a marker on the W chromosome, p_male = 0, p_female = 1. Fst would be 1.

    print("The code demonstrates that due to the difference in ploidy for the X chromosome (diploid in females, hemizygous in males),")
