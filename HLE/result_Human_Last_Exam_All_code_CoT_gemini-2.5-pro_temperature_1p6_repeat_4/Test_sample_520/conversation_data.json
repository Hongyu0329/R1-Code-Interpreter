    "My plan is to answer the historical trivia question you've asked. Since you require the answer to be delivered via a script, I will write a simple Python program. This program will store the answer—Andre Vernault's true profession—in a variable and then use the `print` function to display it in a clear, full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_profession():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical trivia question\n    about Andre Vernault's concealed profession during WWII.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault was a key figure in the Double-Cross System.\n    # His real profession, which he hid, was that of a pigeon breeder (or pigeon fancier).\n    # His pigeons were used by the Allies for communication.\n    # The secrecy around this seemingly mundane job made interrogators suspicious.\n    name = \"Andre Vernault\"\n    profession = \"pigeon breeder\"\n    \n    print(f\"The true profession that {name} concealed from interrogators was: {profession}\")\n\nfind_profession()\n```\n<<<pigeon breeder>>>"
