    "Of course. My plan is to first identify the theologian based on the specific philosophical concepts mentioned, and then I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this theologian as the answer.\n\nThe question asks for the Christian theologian who first developed specialized terminology to account for changes in the laws of nature, specifically applying this to the virgin birth and the consequences of the Fall. This points directly to **Augustine of Hippo**.\n\nAugustine developed the concept of *rationes seminales*, or \"seminal reasons.\" He proposed that God embedded latent potentialities within creation from the very beginning. From this perspective:\n1.  **A miracle**, like the virgin birth, is not a violation of nature but the divine activation of a potentiality (a seminal reason) that was always present in creation, though not part of its ordinary course.\n2.  **Changes at the Fall**, such as the earth bringing forth \"thorns and thistles,\" could be explained as the activation of negative potentialities that were held in check until humanity's disobedience.\n\nThis framework of *rationes seminales* is the specialized terminology developed by Augustine to describe these types of events.\n\nHere is the Python code to output the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_theologian():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the theologian\n    who developed the concept of 'rationes seminales' (seminal reasons)\n    to explain changes in the natural order.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian_name = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    print(theologian_name)\n\nfind_theologian()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
