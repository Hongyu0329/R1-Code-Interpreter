# The problem asks for the value of n for which the tame functor F is n-resolvable.
# Based on the reasoning derived from the representation theory of posets,
# we concluded that the projective dimension of such a functor is at most 2.
# An n-resolvable object is one that has a projective resolution of length n.
# For this property to hold universally for all possible tame functors F
# under the given conditions, n must be at least the maximum possible
# projective dimension.
# Since the global dimension of an incidence algebra of a tame poset is at most 2,
# the maximum possible finite projective dimension for any module is 2.
# Therefore, n must be 2.

n = 2
