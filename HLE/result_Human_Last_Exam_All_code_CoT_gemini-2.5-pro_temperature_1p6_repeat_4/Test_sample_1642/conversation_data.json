    "This problem can be solved by reducing it to the well-known N-Queens puzzle. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem**: The condition \"without attacking each other\" is understood to apply to all queens on the board, regardless of their color. This means that no two queens, whether they are white-white, black-black, or white-black, can be on the same row, column, or diagonal.\n2.  **Formulate as an N-Queens Problem**: We have a total of `m` white queens and `m` black queens, making `2 * m` queens in total. The problem is now equivalent to finding the maximum number of queens that can be placed on a 16x16 board so that no two queens attack each other. Let this total number of queens be `N`. So, `N = 2 * m`.\n3.  **Find the Maximum Number of Queens**: For any `n x n` chessboard, the maximum number of non-attacking queens you can place is `n`. This is because if you were to place `n + 1` queens, the Pigeonhole Principle dictates that at least two queens must occupy the same row, which would result in an attack. Therefore, for a 16x16 board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is 16.\n4.  **Solve for m**: We now have the equation `2 * m = 16`. Solving for `m` will give us the maximum number of queens of a single color. It's known that solutions for the `n`-queens problem exist for all `n >= 4`, so a placement of 16 queens is possible. We could take any such solution and simply label 8 of the queens as white and the other 8 as black to satisfy the problem's conditions.\n5.  **Code Implementation**: The Python code below will define the board size, calculate `m` based on the logic above, and print the final equation along with the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_queen_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\n    can coexist on a 16x16 chessboard without attacking each other.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The size of the chessboard.\n    n = 16\n    \n    # The problem requires placing m white and m black queens such that no queen\n    # attacks another. This is equivalent to placing a total of 2*m queens\n    # on the board under the same non-attacking condition.\n    \n    # On an n x n board, the maximum number of non-attacking queens is n.\n    # This is because placing n+1 queens would force at least two queens\n    # to be in the same row, due to the Pigeonhole Principle.\n    max_total_queens = n\n    \n    # The total number of queens is 2 * m. So, we have the equation:\n    # 2 * m = max_total_queens\n    # We solve for m. A solution with 16 queens is known to exist, so this\n    # maximum is achievable.\n    \n    m = max_total_queens // 2\n    \n    print(f\"The problem is for a {n}x{n} board.\")\n    print(\"The maximum number of total non-attacking queens is equal to the board size.\")\n    print(f\"The equation relating the total queens to m is: 2 * m = {n}\")\n    print(\"Solving for m gives the final answer.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with the solution is:\")\n    print(f\"2 * {m} = {n}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nThe maximum number m is {m}.\")\n\nsolve_queen_problem()\n```\n<<<8>>>"
