    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, we can use a method analogous to the Euclidean algorithm. This involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix formed from the two given matrices.\n\n**My plan is as follows:**\n\n1.  **Form a stacked matrix:** Create a single 4x2 matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    ```\n    M = [ P1 ]\n        [ P2 ]\n    ```\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations:** The goal of these operations is to reduce the matrix to a simpler form. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n    These operations are applied sequentially to reduce the degree of the polynomials in the matrix and introduce zero entries, aiming to obtain a matrix with two zero rows.\n3.  **Extract the GCRD:** After the reduction process, the remaining non-zero rows will form a matrix `G`. This matrix `G` is a greatest common right divisor of the original matrices `P1` and `P2`.\n4.  **Normalize the GCRD:** A GCRD is unique only up to a left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). If the resulting GCRD `G` is itself unimodular, it means the original matrices `P1` and `P2` are right-coprime. In such cases, the standard convention is to present the identity matrix `I` as the GCRD, as `I` can be obtained by left-multiplying `G` by its inverse `G_inv` (which is also unimodular).\n\nI will implement this process using Python's `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics, which handles polynomial operations effectively.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two\n    polynomial matrices P1 and P2 using elementary row operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # 1.
