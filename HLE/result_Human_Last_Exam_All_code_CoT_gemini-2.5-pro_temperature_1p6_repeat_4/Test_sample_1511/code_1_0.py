# Part (a): Logical deduction

# |F intersect G| >= 1. This implies they share at least one common element.
# Therefore, their supports cannot be disjoint.

# Part (c): Logical deduction based on theorem
# The theorem for sum maximal cross-intersecting families states that for m >= k+t,
# the maximum sum is achieved if and only if F = G = {A | S is a sub-multiset of A}
# for some fixed t-multiset S. For t=1, S is a single element {i}.
# So, F must be the family of *all* k-multisets containing a fixed element i.
# The question asks if F must *contain* this family, which is true if it must *be* this family.

# Format the final output string
# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation.
# The equation for (b) is: 2 * C(5+2-1-1, 2-1) = 2 * C(5, 1) = 10
# We will construct a string to reflect this calculation.
