    Calculates the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the interval [0,1]

    This is based on the known result for the distance between a circle and an arc:
    d_GH = max(c/4, l/2) for a circle of circumference c and an arc of length l,
    given that c >= 2l.

    For our spaces:
    - The interval [0,1] is isometric to an arc of length l=1.
    - The unit circle has a circumference c=2*pi.
    The condition 2*pi >= 2 is met.
