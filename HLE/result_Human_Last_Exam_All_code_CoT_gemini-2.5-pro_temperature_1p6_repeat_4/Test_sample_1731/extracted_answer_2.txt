For a gas of light quanta (photons), the non-conservation of particle number sets the chemical potential to zero.
The equilibrium distribution for the average occupation number n(epsilon) of a state with energy epsilon is the Planck Distribution:
Equation [1]: n(epsilon) = 1 / (exp(epsilon / (k_B * T)) - 1)

The equilibrium mean energy density (u) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
Equation [2]: u = a * T^4
The radiation constant 'a' is calculated to be 7.5657e-16 J m^-3 K^-4.
Thus, the final equation for mean energy density is:
u = 7.5657e-16 * T^4  [J/m^3]

The equilibrium entropy density (s) is derived from the energy density:
Equation [3]: s = (4/3) * a * T^3
The coefficient for entropy density (4/3)*a is calculated to be 1.0088e-15 J m^-3 K^-4.
Thus, the final equation for entropy density is:
s = 1.0088e-15 * T^3  [J/m^3 K]
