    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to calculate the final results.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the System and Core Principle:**\n    The system is a gas of light quanta (photons) in thermal equilibrium. According to the principles of statistical mechanics, which are mathematically formalized by large deviation theorems like Boltzmann-Sanov, the equilibrium state is the most probable one. This state is found by maximizing the system's entropy subject to its physical constraints.\n\n2.  **Determine the Constraints:**\n    For a photon gas, unlike a gas of massive particles, the total number of particles (photons) is not conserved because they can be created and annihilated at the walls of their container. The primary constraint is the total energy, which is determined by the system's temperature, T. The non-conservation of particle number implies that the chemical potential, `μ`, is zero.\n\n3.  **Find the Equilibrium Distribution:**\n    Maximizing the Bose-Einstein entropy with the constraint of fixed total energy (and `μ=0`) yields the equilibrium distribution for the average occupation number `n(ε)` of a state with energy `ε`. This is the renowned **Planck distribution**:\n    `n(ε) = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B * T)) - 1)`\n    where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Mean Energy:**\n    To find the total energy `E` of the system, we must sum the energy of all photons. This is done by integrating the energy of a state `ε` multiplied by the number of photons in that state `n(ε)` over all possible states. We use the density of states `g(ε)` for photons in a 3D volume `V`, which is `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³)) * ε²`.\n\n    The energy density `u = E/V` is:\n    `u = (1/V) * ∫ ε * n(ε) * g(ε) dε = (8π / (h³c³)) * ∫ [ε³ / (exp(ε / k_B*T) - 1)] dε`\n\n    Solving this integral yields the **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**:\n    `u = a * T⁴`\n    where `a = (8π⁵k_B⁴) / (15h³c³)` is the radiation constant.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Equilibrium Entropy:**\n    The entropy `S` can be derived from the thermodynamic relation `S = (E + PV) / T`. For a photon gas, the pressure `P` is related to the energy density by `P = u/3`. Therefore, `E + PV = E + (u/3)V = E + E/3 = (4/3)E`.\n\n    Substituting this into the entropy relation gives:\n    `S = (4/3) * E / T`\n\n    The entropy density `s = S/V` is then:\n    `s = (4/3) * (E/V) / T = (4/3) * u / T = (4/3) * (aT⁴) / T`\n    Which simplifies to:\n    `s = (4/3) * a * T³`\n\nThe Python code below will now calculate the numerical values for the constants in these final equations for energy and entropy.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium properties of a photon gas.\n    \n    This script details the formulas for the equilibrium distribution, mean energy density,\n    and entropy density of a photon gas, derived from the principles of statistical mechanics.\n    It then calculates the numerical constants in the energy and entropy equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Physical Constants ---\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck constant in J*s\n    c = 299792458     # Speed of light in m/s\n\n    # --- Introduction and Equilibrium Distribution ---\n    print(\"For a gas of light quanta (photons), the non-conservation of particle number sets the chemical potential to zero.\")\n    print(\"The equilibrium distribution for the average occupation number n(epsilon) of a state with energy epsilon is the Planck Distribution:\")\n    print(\"Equation [1]: n(epsilon) = 1 / (exp(epsilon / (k_B * T)) - 1)\\n\")\n\n    # --- Equilibrium Mean Energy Calculation ---\n    print(\"The equilibrium mean energy density (u) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\")\n    print(\"Equation [2]: u = a * T^4\")\n    \n    # Calculate the radiation constant 'a'\n    # a = (8 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\n    a = (8 * np.pi**5 * k_B**4) / (15 * h**3 * c**3)\n    \n    print(f\"The radiation constant 'a' is calculated to be {a:.4e} J m^-3 K^-4.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the final equation for mean energy density is:\")\n    print(f\"u = {a:.4e} * T^4  [J/m^3]\\n\")\n\n    # --- Equilibrium Entropy Calculation ---\n    print(\"The equilibrium entropy density (s) is derived from the energy density:\")\n    print(\"Equation [3]: s = (4/3) * a * T^3\")\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient for the entropy density equation\n    entropy_coeff = (4/3) * a\n\n    print(f\"The coefficient for entropy density (4/3)*a is calculated to be {entropy_coeff:.4e} J m^-3 K^-4.\")\n    print(\"Thus, the final equation for entropy density is:\")\n    print(f\"s = {entropy_coeff:.4e} * T^3  [J/m^3 K]\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_photon_gas_properties()\n```\n<<<For a gas of light quanta (photons), the non-conservation of particle number sets the chemical potential to zero.\nThe equilibrium distribution for the average occupation number n(epsilon) of a state with energy epsilon is the Planck Distribution:\nEquation [1]: n(epsilon) = 1 / (exp(epsilon / (k_B * T)) - 1)\n\nThe equilibrium mean energy density (u) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law:\nEquation [2]: u = a * T^4\nThe radiation constant 'a' is calculated to be 7.5657e-16 J m^-3 K^-4.\nThus, the final equation for mean energy density is:\nu = 7.5657e-16 * T^4  [J/m^3]\n\nThe equilibrium entropy density (s) is derived from the energy density:\nEquation [3]: s = (4/3) * a * T^3\nThe coefficient for entropy density (4/3)*a is calculated to be 1.0088e-15 J m^-3 K^-4.\nThus, the final equation for entropy density is:\ns = 1.0088e-15 * T^3  [J/m^3 K]\n>>>"
