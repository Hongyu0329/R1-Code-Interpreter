    "Of course. Here is my analysis and a Python script to solve the task.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understanding the Definitions:**\n    *   **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including when `x=y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`.\n    *   **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is maximal if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`.\n    *   **Filled Group:** A group `G` is *filled* if for *every* maximal product-free set `S`, the group `G` is covered by `S`, its inverses `S⁻¹`, and the identity element `e`. That is, `G = S ∪ S⁻¹ ∪ {e}`.\n\n2.  **The Key Condition for a Group to be Filled:**\n    A major theorem in this area of group theory provides a simple structural condition: A finite group `G` is filled if and only if it does not contain any subgroup isomorphic to `Cₚ × Cₚ` (the direct product of two cyclic groups of order `p`) for any odd prime `p`.\n\n3.  **Applying the Condition to Groups of Order `2q^m`:**\n    *   Let `G` be a group of order `2q^m`, where `q` is an odd prime.\n    *   For `G` to have a subgroup `Cₚ × Cₚ`, the order of this subgroup, `p²`, must divide the order of `G`. The only odd prime whose square could possibly divide `2q^m` is `q` itself.\n    *   Therefore, `G` is a filled group if and only if it does **not** have a subgroup isomorphic to `C_q × C_q`.\n\n4.  **Analyzing the Sylow Subgroups:**\n    *   A subgroup of order `q²` (like `C_q × C_q`) must be contained within a Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`. The Sylow `q`-subgroup of `G`, let's call it `Q`, has order `q^m`.\n    *   The condition that `G` has no `C_q × C_q` subgroup is equivalent to its Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` having no `C_q × C_q` subgroup.\n    *   A finite `q`-group (a group of order `q^k`) contains a subgroup `C_q × C_q` if and only if it cannot be generated by a single element (i.e., it's not cyclic).\n    *   Thus, for `G` to be filled, its Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` must be **cyclic**, i.e., `Q ≅ C_{q^m}`.\n\n5.  **Identifying the Nonabelian Group Structure:**\n    *   We are looking for *nonabelian* groups. A group `G` of order `2q^m` is a semidirect product of its (normal) Sylow `q`-subgroup `Q` and its Sylow 2-subgroup `P ≅ C₂`.\n    *   So, `G ≅ Q ⋊ P ≅ C_{q^m} ⋊ C₂`.\n    *   For this semidirect product to be nonabelian, the homomorphism from `C₂` to the automorphism group of `C_{q^m}` must be non-trivial.\n    *   There is only one non-trivial homomorphism, which maps the generator of `C₂` to the automorphism of `C_{q^m}` that sends each element to its inverse.\n    *   The resulting group has the presentation `<x, y | x²=1, y^{q^m}=1, xyx⁻¹=y⁻¹>`. This is the definition of the **dihedral group** of order `2q^m`, denoted `D_{2q^m}`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe only nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are the **dihedral groups `D_{2q^m}`**.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates this by taking `q=3` and `m=2` as an example, constructing the dihedral group `D₁₈`, and verifying that it has the required properties.\n\n```python\n# The 'sympy' library is required to run this code.\n# You can install it using your terminal: pip install sympy\n\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import DihedralGroup\n\ndef find_and_verify_filled_group(q, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the nonabelian filled group of order 2*q**m\n    and verifies its properties using the sympy library.\n\n    A finite group G is filled if it does not contain a subgroup isomorphic\n    to C_p x C_p for any odd prime p. For a group of order 2*q**m, this\n    means its Sylow q-subgroup must be cyclic.\n\n    The only nonabelian group structure satisfying this is the Dihedral group.\n    \"\"\"\n    order = 2 * (q**m)\n    group_name = f\"D_{order}\"\n    \n    # As requested, output the final result in an equation format\n    print(f\"The nonabelian filled group of order 2 * {q}^{m} = {order} is the Dihedral Group {group_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Verification using sympy ---\")\n\n    # In sympy, DihedralGroup(n) corresponds to the dihedral group of order 2n.\n    # Our group D_{2*q**m} is DihedralGroup(q**m) in sympy.\n    n = q**m\n    try:\n        G = DihedralGroup(n)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: Could not construct DihedralGroup({n}) in sympy. {e}\")\n        return\n\n    # Property 1: Check Order\n    print(f\"1.
