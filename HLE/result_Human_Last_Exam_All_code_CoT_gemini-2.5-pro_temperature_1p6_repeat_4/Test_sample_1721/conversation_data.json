    "The user wants to find the largest constant `c` for which there's a large subset of integers whose sumset does not contain any squares.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Rephrase the problem**: We are looking for the maximum density `c` of a set `A ⊆ {1, ..., N}` such that for any `x, y ∈ A`, the sum `x + y` is not a perfect square.\n2.  **Method of construction**: A powerful method to construct such sets is using modular arithmetic. We choose a modulus `m` and a set of residues `R ⊆ {0, 1, ..., m-1}`. We then define our set `A` as `{n ∈ {1, ..., N} | n mod m ∈ R}`.\n3.  **Condition on residues**: For `A+A` to not contain any squares, the sum of any two elements from `A`, when taken modulo `m`, must not be a quadratic residue modulo `m`. Let `S_m` be the set of quadratic residues modulo `m`. The condition on our set `R` is: for any `r1, r2 ∈ R`, `(r1 + r2) mod m` must not be in `S_m`.\n4.  **Finding the density c**: The density of our set `A` is `|A|/N ≈ |R|/m`. Our goal is to maximize this ratio `|R|/m`.\n5.  **Graph theory model**: This problem can be modeled as finding the largest possible clique in a graph.\n    *   First, we determine the set of possible vertices `V'`. A residue `r` can be in `R` only if `(r + r) mod m` is not a quadratic residue. So, `V' = {r ∈ {0, ..., m-1} | (2r) mod m ∉ S_m}`.\n    *   We construct a graph where the vertices are the elements of `V'`.\n    *   An edge exists between two vertices `r1` and `r2` if `(r1 + r2) mod m ∉ S_m`.\n    *   A valid set `R` is a clique in this graph. We want to find the maximum clique.\n6.  **Implementation**: I will provide a Python script that implements this search. It will iterate through various moduli `m`, construct the corresponding graph, find the size of the maximum clique, and calculate the ratio `c`. The script will use the `networkx` library, which provides a standard and efficient implementation for finding cliques. The script will report the best `c` found. Based on existing mathematical literature, `m=32` is expected to give the best result among small moduli.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the largest density c of a set A where A+A contains no squares,\n    by searching through different moduli m and finding the optimal residue set R.\n    \"\"\"\n    best_c = 0\n    best_m = 0\n    best_R_size = 0\n\n    # We search for the best modulus m up to a reasonable limit.\n    # The range is chosen to include 32, which is known to give a good result.\n    for m in range(3, 41):\n        # 1.
