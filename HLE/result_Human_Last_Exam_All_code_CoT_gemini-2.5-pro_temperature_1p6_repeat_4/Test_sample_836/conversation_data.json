    "The space-time, double Fourier transform of the generalized pair correlation function is a fundamental quantity used in neutron noise analysis. This transform converts the correlation function from the space-time domain, G(r, t), to the frequency-wavevector domain, S(k, ω). In the nuclear criticality community, this resulting function is known as the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)**. More specifically, if the correlation is between two different points, it is the Cross-Power Spectral Density (CPSD), and if it's for a single point, it's the Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD).\n\nTo fulfill your request for a coded task, I will solve a related problem. A common application of this technique is to determine key reactor physics parameters. For a simple reactor model, the APSD follows the form `APSD(ω) = C / (α² + ω²)`, where `α` is the prompt neutron decay constant. We can calculate `α` if we have APSD measurements at two different frequencies.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define two measurement points: `(ω₁, P₁)` and `(ω₂, P₂)` where `P` is the power spectral density at angular frequency `ω`.\n2.  Set up the system of two equations to solve for `α`.\n    *   `P₁ = C / (α² + ω₁²)`\n    *   `P₂ = C / (α² + ω₂²)`\n3.  Algebraically solve these equations for `α²`, which yields the formula:\n    `α² = (P₁*ω₁² - P₂*ω₂²) / (P₂ - P₁)`\n4.  Write a Python script to compute `α` using this formula with example values and print the steps of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_alpha_from_psd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the prompt neutron decay constant (alpha) from two\n    Auto-Power Spectral Density (APSD) measurements.\n\n    The model for the APSD is APSD(omega) = C / (alpha^2 + omega^2).\n    Given two points (omega1, P1) and (omega2, P2), we can solve for alpha.\n    The resulting formula is:\n    alpha^2 = (P1*omega1^2 - P2*omega2^2) / (P2 - P1)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Given values ---\n    # Measurement 1:\n    omega1 = 10.0  # rad/s\n    P1 = 0.8     # APSD value at omega1 (arbitrary units)\n\n    # Measurement 2:\n    omega2 = 100.0 # rad/s\n    P2 = 0.1      # APSD value at omega2 (arbitrary units)\n\n    print(\"Problem: Calculate the prompt neutron decay constant, alpha, from two PSD measurements.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"Given Measurement 1: Power (P1) = {P1}, Frequency (omega1) = {omega1} rad/s\")\n    print(f\"Given Measurement 2: Power (P2) = {P2}, Frequency (omega2) = {omega2} rad/s\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Calculate the terms for the final equation\n    numerator_term1 = P1 * omega1**2\n    numerator_term2 = P2 * omega2**2\n    denominator_term = P2 - P1\n\n    # Check for division by zero, which happens if P1 == P2\n    if denominator_term == 0:\n        if numerator_term1 == numerator_term2:\n            print(\"P1 equals P2 and the numerator is zero.
