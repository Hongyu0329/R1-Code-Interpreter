    "My plan is to answer your historical question about the artist Curt Querner. Since the prompt requests a Python script, I will create a simple script that prints the name of the object he held in his 1933 self-portrait (\"Selbstbildnis mit Pfeife\") as a symbol of his resistance and composure after his arrest.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the question about Curt Querner's 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The object he held was a pipe, symbolizing his calm defiance.\n    symbol = \"a pipe\"\n    \n    print(f\"In his 1933 self-portrait after escaping the Gestapo, Curt Querner holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the answer.\nfind_symbol()\n```\n<<<a pipe>>>"
