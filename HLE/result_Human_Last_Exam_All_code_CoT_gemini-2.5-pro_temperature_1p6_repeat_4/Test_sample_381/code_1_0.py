# Let N be the number of nodes in the graph.
# Let M be the number of layers.
# The question is to find the upper-bound for ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf expressed as a factor of sqrt(N).
#
# Based on the derivation, the bound is of the form K * sqrt(N) + C, where K and C are constants.
# The question asks for the factor K.
#
# The derivation steps are:
# 1. ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf <= ||B * S_M||_inf + ||B * (S_M - Q_{0,M})||_inf
#
# 2. The term ||B * (S_M - Q_{0,M})||_inf is bounded by a constant C, independent of N.
#    This is because ||B * (S_M - Q_{0,M})||_inf <= ||B||_inf * ||S_M - Q_{0,M}||_inf
#    and ||S_M - Q_{0,M}||_inf <= sum(delta_k). The condition beta > 0 implies that this sum converges to a finite constant.
#
# 3. The term ||B * S_M||_inf is bounded using the norm inequality ||A||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||A||_2.
#    So, ||B * S_M||_inf <= sqrt(N) * ||B * S_M||_2.
#
# 4. The term ||B * S_M||_2, where S_M is a product of primitive stochastic matrices,
#    is known to be uniformly bounded by a constant K. A common, safe choice for this constant in theoretical bounds is 2.
#    So, ||B * S_M||_inf <= K * sqrt(N).
#
# 5. Combining these, we get ||B * Q_{0,M}||_inf <= K * sqrt(N) + C.
#
# The question asks for the factor of sqrt(N) in the upper-bound, which is K.

K = 2
