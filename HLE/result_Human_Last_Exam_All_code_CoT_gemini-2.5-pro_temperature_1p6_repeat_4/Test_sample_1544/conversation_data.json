    "This is a complex endgame, but White has a clear path to victory. Here is my plan to find the best move:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** White has a very strong passed pawn on d6, which is only two squares from promotion. However, Black's queen on c5 is extremely active and poses significant threats to the White king, including potential perpetual checks or even checkmate. Black's d7-pawn is also a passed pawn, but it is less advanced.\n2.  **Identify Candidate Moves:** The most straightforward approach for White is to simplify the position and remove Black's counterplay. This points towards trading queens. The most forcing way to do this is with a capture that is also a check.\n3.  **Evaluate the Best Candidate:**\n    *   The move `Qxc5+` is a check and forces Black to recapture with the king (`...kxc5`).\n    *   This trade liquidates the position into a King and Pawn endgame.\n    *   In the resulting endgame, Black's king on c5 is tied down to prevent the White d-pawn from promoting.\n    *   This allows White's king, starting from g1, to activate and march towards the center and queenside.\n    *   White's king will eventually create a second threat or force Black into zugzwang (a situation where any move worsens their position), leading to a decisive win for White.\n4.  **Conclusion:** The move `Qxc5+` is the optimal move because it forces a simplification into a clearly winning endgame, completely neutralizing Black's threats.\n\n```python\ndef find_best_move():\n  \"\"\"\n  Analyzes the FEN string '8/3p4/1kpP4/p1q5/P7/8/5Q2/6K1 w - - 0 1' \n  and determines the best move for White.\n  \"\"\"\n  \n  # The position analysis reveals a winning simplification for White.\n  # The key is to trade queens to eliminate Black's counterplay and \n  # promote the powerful d6-pawn.\n  \n  # The move is 1.
