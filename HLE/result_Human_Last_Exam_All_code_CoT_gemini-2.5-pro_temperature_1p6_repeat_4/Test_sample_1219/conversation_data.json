    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to handle a very large number. Standard calculators or floating-point numbers in most programming languages cannot handle this directly due to precision limitations.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: The number 10^100 is a googol. We need a special library for high-precision arithmetic. The Python `mpmath` library is perfectly suited for this task.\n2.  **Periodicity of Tangent**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. The core of the problem is to compute `10^100 mod π` with very high accuracy.\n3.  **Using `mpmath`**: Fortunately, the `mpmath` library's `tan` function automatically handles this large argument reduction. We don't need to do it manually.\n4.  **Setting Precision**: When dealing with large numbers in `mpmath`, we must set the precision correctly. The number of correct digits we get in the result is approximately the working precision (`mpmath.mp.dps`) minus `log10` of the argument. Here, the argument is 10^100, and `log10(10^100) = 100`. To get the first few digits of the result correctly, we need to set the precision to a value slightly greater than 100. A value of 105 is a safe choice.\n5.  **Extracting Digits**: After calculating the result, we can convert it to a string and extract the first three digits following the decimal point.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the solution.\n\n```python\nimport mpmath\n\n# 1. Set the precision for the calculation.\n# The working precision in decimal places (dps) must be greater than log10(x).\n# For x = 10^100, log10(x) = 100. We choose 105 to get a few correct digits.\nmpmath.mp.dps = 105\n\n# 2. Define the large number. Python handles large integers automatically.\nbase = 10\nexponent = 100\nx = base**exponent\n\n# 3. Calculate tan(10^100).\n# The mpmath tan function correctly reduces the large argument modulo its internal high-precision value of pi.\nresult = mpmath.tan(x)\n\n# 4. Extract the integer part and the first 3 fractional digits for the output.\nresult_str = str(result)\ndecimal_point_index = result_str.find('.')\ninteger_part = result_str[:decimal_point_index]\nfirst_three_digits = result_str[decimal_point_index + 1 : decimal_point_index + 4]\n\n# 5. Output the numbers from the final equation as requested.\n# The equation is tan(10^100) = <result>.\nprint(f\"The final equation is: tan({base}^{exponent}) = {integer_part}.{first_three_digits}...\")\nprint(\"\\nHere are the numbers involved in this equation:\")\nprint(f\"Base: {base}\")\nprint(f\"Exponent: {exponent}\")\nprint(f\"Integer part of the result: {integer_part}\")\nprint(f\"The first 3 digits after the comma: {first_three_digits}\")\n\n```\n<<<160>>>"
