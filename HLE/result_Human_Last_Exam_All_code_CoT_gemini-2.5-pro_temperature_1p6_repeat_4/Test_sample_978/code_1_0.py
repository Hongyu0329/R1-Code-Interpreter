    # Principles:
    # 1. Negligence: An individual is liable for damages caused by their careless actions.
    # 2. Vicarious Liability: An employer is liable for the negligent acts of an employee
    #    if the acts are committed within the scope of their employment.
    # 3. Joint and Several Liability: When multiple parties are liable for the same harm,
    #    the injured party can sue any or all of them to recover the full damages.

    # Incident 1: Mark and the Pool
    # - Mark was negligent. He is personally liable.
    # - Evergreen, his employer, is vicariously liable.
    # - Conclusion for Incident 1: Mark and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable.
    incident_1_liability = "Evergreen Grass Care Ltd. and Mark are jointly and severally liable for the damage that resulted from Mark's actions."

    # Incident 2: Lincoln and the Ferrari
    # - Lincoln was negligent (the minimal nature of damage affects the amount of compensation, not liability itself). He is personally liable.
    # - Evergreen, his employer, is vicariously liable.
    # - Conclusion for Incident 2: Lincoln and Evergreen are jointly and severally liable.
