    1. Patient's initial symptoms (agitation, difficulty sleeping, hypersexuality, careless spending) combined with a family history of mood disorders are classic signs of a manic episode, a key feature of Bipolar Disorder.
    2. The standard and first-line treatment for a manic episode is a mood stabilizer, most commonly Lithium.
    3. The patient develops sexual dysfunction (decreased interest in sex) *after* starting this new medication. This timing strongly suggests a medication side effect.
    4. Lithium is well-known to have several side effects, with one of the most common endocrine-related effects being hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid).
    5. Hypothyroidism is a classic cause of sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido.
    6. Therefore, the most logical sequence of events is: Manic Episode -> Lithium Prescription -> Lithium-Induced Hypothyroidism -> Sexual Dysfunction.
    7. While the patient's occupational history exposes him to heavy metals which can cause various dysfunctions, the timing of the sexual dysfunction's onset makes a medication side effect the most direct and probable cause.
