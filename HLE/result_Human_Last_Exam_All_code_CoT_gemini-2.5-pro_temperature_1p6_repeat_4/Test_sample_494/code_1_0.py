Step 1: Understanding Ammonia Tunneling in a Normal Molecule (NH3)
- In an ammonia molecule, the three hydrogen atoms form a planar triangle.
- The nitrogen atom can be on one side of this plane or the other.
- These two positions are separated by a potential energy barrier.
- According to quantum mechanics, the nitrogen atom can "tunnel" through this barrier, leading to a splitting of energy levels. This is the phenomenon of ammonia inversion tunneling.

Step 2: Key Factors Determining Tunneling
- The probability and rate of quantum tunneling depend primarily on three factors:
  1. The mass of the tunneling particle (the nitrogen atom).
  2. The height and width of the potential energy barrier it must cross.
  3. Planck's constant.
- The potential energy barrier is determined by the electrostatic forces between the nuclei and electrons in the molecule.

Step 3: Comparing Normal and "Exotic" Hydrogen
- Normal Hydrogen: The nucleus (a proton) has a nuclear spin of 1/2. Particles with half-integer spin are called fermions.
- Exotic Hydrogen: The hypothetical nucleus has a nuclear spin of 0. Particles with integer spin are called bosons.

Step 4: The Impact of Changing Hydrogen's Spin
- Changing the nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms does NOT change their mass or their electric charge.
- Since the potential energy barrier is created by electrostatic forces, and the charges of the nuclei are unchanged, the potential barrier that the nitrogen atom experiences remains the same.
- The mass of the tunneling nitrogen atom is also obviously unchanged.
- Therefore, the fundamental physical conditions required for tunneling still exist.

Step 5: Conclusion
- The nuclear spin of the hydrogen atoms (whether they are fermions or bosons) governs the symmetry requirements of the total molecular wavefunction. This affects which rotational energy levels are allowed to exist and their populations, which would lead to a different-looking rotational-vibrational spectrum.
- However, it does not eliminate the potential energy barrier or the quantum mechanical ability of the nitrogen atom to tunnel through it.
- The ammonia molecule, with exotic hydrogens replacing the ordinary hydrogens, would therefore still exhibit tunneling.
