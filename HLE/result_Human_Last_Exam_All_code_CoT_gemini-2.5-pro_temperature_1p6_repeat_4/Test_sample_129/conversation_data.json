    "To solve this problem, I will systematically identify all unique and syntactically valid expression structures (which I'll call \"skeletons\") that can be formed using exactly 5 symbols from the given set `{T, F, !, &, |, (, )}`. For each distinct skeleton, I will calculate how many combinations of literals (`T`, `F`) and operators (`&`, `|`) result in the expression evaluating to `True`. The total count is the sum of the counts from all unique skeletons.\n\nThe key principles are:\n1.  **Expression Length:** Each valid expression must be composed of exactly 5 symbols.\n2.  **Unique Strings:** Different strings of symbols are considered different expressions, even if they are logically equivalent (e.g., `T | !!F` is different from `T | F`).\n3.  **Operator Precedence:** The standard order of operations is `!` (highest), then `&`, then `|`. Parentheses `()` are used to override this precedence.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the valid 5-symbol skeletons and the number of `True` expressions for each:\n\n*   **Skeleton 1: `L op L op L`** (e.g., `T & F | T`)\n    *   This structure has 3 literals and 2 operators, evaluated by precedence.\n    *   There are `2*2*2=8` literal combinations for each of the `2*2=4` operator combinations.\n    *   `&` and `&`: `T&T&T` is the only true case. (1)\n    *   `|` and `|`: `F|F|F` is the only false case, so 7 are true. (7)\n    *   `&` then `|`: `(L1&L2)|L3` is true if `L3` is `T` (4 cases), or if `L1` and `L2` are `T` (1 additional case). (5)\n    *   `|` then `&`: `L1|(L2&L3)` is true if `L1` is `T` (4 cases), or if `L2` and `L3` are `T` (1 additional case). (5)\n    *   Total: `1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18`\n\n*   **Skeleton 2: `!L op !L`** (e.g., `!T | !F`)\n    *   Parsed as `(!L) op (!L)`.\n    *   The 4 true cases are: `!F & !F`, `!T | !F`, `!F | !T`, `!F | !F`. (4)\n\n*   **Skeleton 3: `(L op L)`** (e.g., `(T & T)`)\n    *   True when the inner `L op L` is true.\n    *   The 4 true cases are: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (4)\n\n*   **Skeletons 4 & 5: `L op (L)` and `(L) op L`**\n    *   These are syntactically different from Skeleton 3 but logically equivalent. Each contributes 4 true expressions. (4 + 4)\n\n*   **Skeleton 6: `!!!!L`** (e.g., `!!!!T`)\n    *   `!!!!T` evaluates to `T`. (1)\n\n*   **Skeleton 7: `!(!L)`** (e.g., `!(!T)`)\n    *   `!(!T)` evaluates to `T`. (1)\n\n*   **Skeletons 8 & 9: `L op !!L` and `!!L op L`**\n    *   Logically equivalent to `L op L`, which has 4 true variations. Each skeleton contributes 4. (4 + 4)\n\n*   **Skeletons 10 & 11: `L op !(L)` and `!(L) op L`**\n    *   These evaluate expressions like `T & !(F)`. Each has 4 true variations. (4 + 4)\n\n*   **Skeleton 12: `!!!(L)`** (e.g., `!!!(F)`)\n    *   `!!!(F)` evaluates to `T`. (1)\n\nThe following Python code sums up the counts from these distinct skeletons.\n\n```python\ndef solve_boolean_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the number of true boolean expressions\n    that can be written using exactly 5 symbols from {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n    It breaks down the problem by identifying all valid 5-symbol expression\n    structures (skeletons) and summing the number of true variations for each.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_true_expressions = 0\n    contributions = {}\n\n    print(\"Calculating the number of true boolean expressions of length 5...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Skeleton 1: L op L op L (e.g., T & F | T)\n    # Total combinations = 2 (L1) * 2 (op1) * 2 (L2) * 2 (op2) * 2 (L3) = 32\n    # Case 1.1: op1='&', op2='&'.
