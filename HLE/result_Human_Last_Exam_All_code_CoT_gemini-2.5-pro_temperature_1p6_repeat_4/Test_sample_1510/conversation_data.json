    "To determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we first need to identify which point groups have an order of 2. Then, we need to count how many of the 17 wallpaper groups correspond to these specific point groups.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Define Point Groups and Orders:** I will create a data structure mapping the crystallographic point groups associated with wallpaper groups to their respective orders (the number of symmetry operations in the group).\n2.  **Define Wallpaper Groups:** I will create a second data structure mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to its corresponding point group.\n3.  **Identify and Count:** I will write a script to iterate through the wallpaper groups. For each group, it will find its point group and check if the order of that point group is 2.\n4.  **Categorize and Sum:** The script will categorize the qualifying wallpaper groups by their specific point group (e.g., C2 or D1) and sum the counts to get the total number.\n5.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the names of the wallpaper groups found, the count for each category, and the final calculation showing the total.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of wallpaper groups that have a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point groups.\n    # Note: D1 is also known as Cs or C1v.
