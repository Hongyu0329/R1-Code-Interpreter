    This function explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.
    
    Step 1: Understand the Goal
    We want to find the minimum value of N(X), where N(X) is the number of 
    topologically distinct compactifications of the ray for a given space X.
    We can choose any X that is non-degenerate, locally-connected, compact, and metric.

    Step 2: Strategy
    To find the minimum, we can test one of the simplest possible spaces for X.
    Let's choose X to be a discrete space with two points, for example, X = {p1, p2}.
    This space satisfies all the required properties:
    - Non-degenerate: It has two points.
    - Compact and Metric: A finite metric space is compact.
    - Locally-connected: Any discrete space is locally connected.

    Step 3: Analyze the Compactifications for X = {p1, p2}
    A compactification is determined by how the ray [0, 1) attaches to X.
    The set of limit points of the ray must form a non-empty, closed, connected
    subset of X. Let's call this the "end-set".

    For X = {p1, p2}, the only non-empty connected subsets are {p1} and {p2}.
    These are also closed. So, we have two possible end-sets:

    Case A: The end-set is {p1}.
    The ray converges to p1. The resulting space Y_1 consists of the one-point
    compactification of the ray (which is homeomorphic to a circle) and an
    isolated point p2. So, Y_1 is homeomorphic to (Circle U {point}).

    Case B: The end-set is {p2}.
    The ray converges to p2. The resulting space Y_2 consists of the one-point
    compactification of the ray and an isolated point p1.
    So, Y_2 is also homeomorphic to (Circle U {point}).

    Step 4: Count the Distinct Topologies
    Both cases produce spaces that are homeomorphic to each other.
    This means for X = {p1, p2}, there is only one type of compactification
    from a topological point of view.
    So, for this choice of X, N(X) = 1.

    Step 5: Conclude
    The number of compactifications must be at least 1. We have found a case
    where the number is exactly 1. Therefore, the smallest possible number is 1.
