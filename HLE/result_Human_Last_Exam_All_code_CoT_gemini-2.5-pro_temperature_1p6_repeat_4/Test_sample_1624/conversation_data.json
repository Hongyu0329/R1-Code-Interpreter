    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the subset U:** The problem states that $U$ is an open subset of $X$ where each point has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$. This means that $U$, when considered as a space on its own with the subspace topology, is a 1-dimensional topological manifold. Since $X$ is a metric space, $U$ is also a metrizable space.\n\n2.  **Establish separability of U:** A key theorem in topology asserts that any connected metrizable manifold is second-countable. A space is second-countable if it has a countable basis for its topology. A second-countable space is always separable, which means it contains a countable dense subset. Let's call this countable dense subset of $U$ by the name $D$.\n\n3.  **Establish separability of X:** We are given that $U$ is dense in $X$ (meaning the closure of $U$ is $X$). Since $D$ is dense in $U$ and $U$ is dense in $X$, it follows that $D$ must also be dense in $X$. Since $D$ is a countable set, its existence proves that $X$ is a separable space.\n\n4.  **Determine the cardinality of a separable metric space:** There is a fundamental result stating that any separable metric space can have a cardinality of at most $2^{\\aleph_0}$, which is the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$). This is proven by showing there's an injective map from the space into the power set of its countable dense subset, and the cardinality of this power set is $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\n5.  **Confirm the bound is achievable:** The upper bound of $2^{\\aleph_0}$ is tight, meaning there exists a space $X$ that satisfies the conditions and has this cardinality. A simple example is the real line itself, $X = \\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   $X = \\mathbb{R}$ is a connected metric space.\n    *   Let $U = \\mathbb{R}$. It is open and dense in $X$.\n    *   Every point in $U$ has a neighborhood (any open interval) homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n    *   The cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}$ is exactly $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n\nThus, the upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ is the cardinality of the continuum.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the upper bound on the cardinality of the space X.\n    The cardinality is expressed as an equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The upper bound is the cardinality of the continuum, which is expressed as 2 to the power of aleph_0.\n    # The base of the power.\n    base = 2\n    # The exponent is Aleph-nought (aleph_0), the cardinality of the natural numbers.\n    # We represent it symbolically as a string.\n    exponent_symbol = \"aleph_0\"\n\n    print(\"The upper bound on the cardinality of X is C, given by the equation:\")\n    print(f\"C = {base}^{exponent_symbol}\")\n    print(\"This is the cardinality of the continuum.\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<$2^{\\aleph_0}$>>>"
