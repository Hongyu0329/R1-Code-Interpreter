    Determines and prints the point group of bis(2,5-dithiahexane)copper.

    Analysis:
    1.  The molecule is [Cu(L)2] where L is the bidentate ligand 2,5-dithiahexane
        (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3). The coordination number is 4.
    2.  Possible geometries are tetrahedral (for Cu(I)) or square planar (for Cu(II)).
    3.  Tetrahedral [Cu(L)2] is chiral. It has a single C2 axis that interchanges
        the two ligands. No other symmetry elements are present besides identity E.
        Thus, the point group is C2.
    4.  Square planar [Cu(L)2] can exist as two isomers:
        - A chiral isomer with C2 symmetry.
        - A meso isomer with Ci symmetry (center of inversion).
    5.  Since the C2 point group describes the stable tetrahedral form and one of the
        square planar isomers, it is the most robust answer for the chiral molecule.
