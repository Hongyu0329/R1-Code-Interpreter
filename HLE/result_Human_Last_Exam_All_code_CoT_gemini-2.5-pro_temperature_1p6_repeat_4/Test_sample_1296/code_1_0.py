    # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # The action of G on the face set F is quasiprimitive. This means any
    # non-trivial normal subgroup, including the socle N, acts transitively on F.
    # The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F.
    # Since N is transitive, there's only one orbit, so D_N has one face.
    # Thus, D_N is unicellular. This is true regardless of G/N being cyclic.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism
    # group of D if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    # A smooth covering imposes that generator orders are preserved from G to G/N.
    # A theorem by G. Jones (2014) states this is impossible if the socle N is
    # a non-abelian minimal normal subgroup, except for some cases of type AS.
    # - Type HA: N is abelian. The theorem does not apply. Possible.
    # - Type TW: N is a non-abelian minimal normal subgroup. The theorem applies
    #            and forbids smooth coverings. Impossible.
    # - Type AS: N is a non-abelian minimal normal subgroup. The theorem applies
    #            but has an exception for this type. Possible.
