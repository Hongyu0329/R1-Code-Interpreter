    "This is a classic E2 elimination problem in organic chemistry where stereochemistry dictates the outcome. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type**: The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK), a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n\n2.  **Recall the E2 Mechanism's Stereochemical Requirement**: The E2 reaction proceeds through a concerted step that requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (Bromine) and a proton on an adjacent carbon (a β-proton) must be *anti-periplanar*. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means the leaving group and the β-proton must both be in axial positions, on opposite sides of the ring (one pointing up, one pointing down). This is often called a *trans-diaxial* arrangement.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Chair Conformations of the Substrate**:\n    *   The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane.\n    *   A *trans*-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two equilibrating chair conformations: one where both substituents are equatorial (diequatorial) and one where both are axial (diaxial).\n    *   The diequatorial conformer is much more stable and therefore predominates at equilibrium. However, E2 elimination cannot occur from this conformation because the leaving group (Br) is not axial.\n    *   The reaction must proceed through the less stable, but reactive, diaxial conformer. In this conformer, both the bromine atom and the methyl group are in axial positions.\n\n4.  **Identify Available β-Protons in the Reactive (Diaxial) Conformer**:\n    *   Let's assume the bromine on C1 is axial \"up\". Since it's a trans isomer, the methyl group on C2 must be axial \"down\".\n    *   We now look for β-protons that are axial and \"down\" (anti to the axial \"up\" Br). The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2**: The methyl group is in the axial \"down\" position. Therefore, the hydrogen on C2 is in the equatorial position. It is not anti-periplanar to the bromine, so elimination to form a double bond between C1 and C2 cannot occur.\n    *   **At C6**: This carbon has two hydrogens. One is equatorial, and one is axial \"down\". This axial hydrogen at C6 is perfectly positioned (trans-diaxial) for E2 elimination with the axial bromine at C1.\n\n5.  **Determine the Final Product**:\n    *   Since elimination can *only* occur by abstracting the proton from C6, the double bond will form between carbon C1 and carbon C6.\n    *   The methyl group on C2 is unaffected. The resulting product is a cyclohexene ring where the methyl group is on the carbon adjacent to the double bond.\n    *   According to IUPAC nomenclature, the double bond carbons are numbered 1 and 2, and the ring is numbered to give substituents the lowest possible number. In this case, the methyl group will be at position 3.\n    *   Therefore, the exclusive product of this reaction is **3-methylcyclohexene**. Interestingly, this is the less substituted (Hofmann) product, and its formation is dictated purely by the stereochemical requirements of the E2 mechanism, not by the steric bulk of the base.\n\n```python\n# The reaction is an E2 elimination.\n# The stereochemistry of the starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane,\n# forces the reaction to proceed through a specific pathway.\n# The E2 mechanism requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.\n# Analysis shows that only the proton on C6 can achieve this arrangement with the Br on C1.\n# Elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 forms a double bond between these two carbons.\n# The resulting alkene, when named according to IUPAC rules, is 3-methylcyclohexene.\n\nproduct_name = \"3-methylcyclohexene\"\nprint(f\"The name of the reaction product is: {product_name}\")\n```\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
