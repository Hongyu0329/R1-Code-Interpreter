# The reaction is an E2 elimination.
# The stereochemistry of the starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane,
# forces the reaction to proceed through a specific pathway.
# The E2 mechanism requires a trans-diaxial arrangement of the leaving group (Br) and a beta-proton.
# Analysis shows that only the proton on C6 can achieve this arrangement with the Br on C1.
# Elimination of H from C6 and Br from C1 forms a double bond between these two carbons.
# The resulting alkene, when named according to IUPAC rules, is 3-methylcyclohexene.
