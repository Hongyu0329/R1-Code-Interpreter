    This program solves the problem by following these steps:
    1. The problem is identified as counting the number of isomorphism classes of
       1000-dimensional representations of a group Gamma defined by the given relations.
    2. The group Gamma is identified as the symmetric group S_5.
    3. The dimensions of the irreducible representations (irreps) of S_5 are calculated.
       There are 7 irreps, with dimensions {1, 1, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6}.
    4. The problem is reformulated as a combinatorial counting problem: find the number
       of non-negative integer solutions to the Diophantine equation
       n_1*1 + n_2*1 + n_3*4 + n_4*4 + n_5*5 + n_6*5 + n_7*6 = 1000.
    5. This is solved using dynamic programming.
