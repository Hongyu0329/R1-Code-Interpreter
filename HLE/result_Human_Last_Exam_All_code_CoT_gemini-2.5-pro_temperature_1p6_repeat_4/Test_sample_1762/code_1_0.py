# The problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes for a space X with a given set of properties.
#
# Our analysis breaks down as follows:
# 1. X is a metric space, so it's a Hausdorff space.
# 2. X is locally compact.
# 3. X is a one-to-one continuous image of the real line R. This means there is a continuous bijection f: R -> X.
#
# A theorem in topology states that a continuous bijection from a locally compact Hausdorff space (like R)
# to a Hausdorff space (like X) is a homeomorphism if the target space is also locally compact.
# Since X is given as locally compact, f must be a homeomorphism.
#
# This means any such space X must be homeomorphic to the real line R.
#
# 4. We must also verify that R itself satisfies the first property: for any distinct x, y in R, there exists a
#    closed connected set K such that x is in the interior of K and y is not.
#    Let x, y be in R with x < y. We can choose the closed interval K = [x-1, (x+y)/2].
#    The interior of K is Int(K) = (x-1, (x+y)/2).
#    - x is in Int(K) because x-1 < x and x < y implies x < (x+y)/2.
#    - y is not in Int(K) because x < y implies y > (x+y)/2.
#    This property holds for R.
#
# Since any space X satisfying the conditions must be homeomorphic to R, all such spaces fall into a single
# homeomorphism class.

number_of_classes = 1

# Final equation is simply the number of classes.
# The prompt says: "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# We will just print the final result.
print(f"The number of homeomorphism classes is: {number_of_classes}")
