    "This sequence consists of Zumkeller numbers. A number `n` is a Zumkeller number if it satisfies two conditions:\n1. It is a perfect or abundant number, which means the sum of its divisors, `sigma(n)`, is greater than or equal to twice the number itself (`sigma(n) >= 2*n`).\n2. The sum of its divisors, `sigma(n)`, has the same parity as `n` (both are even, or both are odd).\n\nThe last number provided in the sequence is 2352. To find the next number, we will start checking integers greater than 2352 and find the first one that meets the definition of a Zumkeller number. The following Python code will perform this search and verification.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_sum_of_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the sum of all divisors of a number n (sigma(n)).\"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return 0\n    sum_div = 0\n    # Iterating up to the square root is an efficient way to find divisors\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # i is a divisor\n            sum_div += i\n            # n/i is also a divisor\n            if i * i != n:\n                sum_div += n // i\n    return sum_div\n\ndef is_zumkeller(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number n is a Zumkeller number based on its properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    sigma_n = get_sum_of_divisors(n)\n    \n    # Condition 1: The number must be perfect or abundant.\n    is_abundant_or_perfect = (sigma_n >= 2 * n)\n    \n    # Condition 2: The number and the sum of its divisors must have the same parity.\n    has_same_parity = (sigma_n % 2 == n % 2)\n    \n    return is_abundant_or_perfect and has_same_parity\n\ndef find_next_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the next Zumkeller number after the last term in the given sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_term_in_sequence = 2352\n    \n    print(f\"The sequence is composed of Zumkeller numbers.
