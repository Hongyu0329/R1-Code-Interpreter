def solve_cohomology_dimension():
    """
    This function calculates the dimension of the ninth cohomology group of the space M.

    The solution proceeds based on the following topological arguments:
    1. The space M is the complement of an arrangement of 36 quaternionic hyperplanes in the space H^4.
    2. The space H^4, the four-dimensional vector space over the quaternions H, is topologically equivalent to R^16, or C^8.
    3. A theorem in topology states that the complement of a quaternionic hyperplane arrangement in H^n is homotopy equivalent to the complement of an associated complex hyperplane arrangement in C^(2n).
       In our case, n=4, so our space M has the same cohomology as a complex hyperplane arrangement complement in C^8.
    4. Another fundamental theorem states that the complement of a hyperplane arrangement in C^n has the homotopy type of a CW-complex of (real) dimension n.
    5. Therefore, M has the homotopy type of an 8-dimensional CW-complex.
    6. For any topological space with the homotopy type of a d-dimensional CW-complex, its k-th cohomology group H^k is trivial for all k > d.
    7. We are asked for the dimension of H^9(M, Q). Here, the degree of cohomology is k=9 and the dimension of the associated complex space is n=8.
    8. Since k > n, the dimension of the cohomology group must be 0.
