# The problem involves cardinals, which are concepts from set theory.
# We will represent them using strings.

# Step 1: Determine delta_2, the infimum of X.
# Based on the analysis, under the assumption 2^omega_1 = omega_2,
# delta_2 is the tower number t(omega_1), which equals omega_2.
delta_2 = "omega_2"

# Step 2: Determine delta_1, the supremum of X.
# Our analysis shows that the set X contains only one element, omega_2.
# Therefore, its supremum is also omega_2.
delta_1 = "omega_2"

# Step 3: Calculate the sum delta_1 + delta_2.
# In cardinal arithmetic, for any infinite cardinal kappa, kappa + kappa = kappa.
# So, omega_2 + omega_2 = omega_2.
result = "omega_2"

# Print the final equation as requested.
print(f"Let delta_1 be the supremum and delta_2 be the infimum of X.")
print(f"We found that delta_1 = {delta_1} and delta_2 = {delta_2}.")
print(f"The sum is calculated using cardinal arithmetic:")
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Here 'numbers' are the string representations of the cardinals.
print(f"{delta_1} + {delta_2} = {result}")
