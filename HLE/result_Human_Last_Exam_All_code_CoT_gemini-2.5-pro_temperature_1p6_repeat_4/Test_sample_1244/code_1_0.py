    """
    This function investigates the numerical conditions for the vector norm in part (b).

    Background: An odd unimodular lattice of rank 14 must contain a "characteristic
    vector" whose norm `N` satisfies `N ≡ 14 (mod 8)`, which means `N = 8k + 6`
    for some integer `k`. It can be shown that a 3-primitive characteristic
    vector must exist.

    The question asks if this vector's norm can be divisible by 6.
    This script checks if there is an integer `k` for which `N = 8k + 6` is a
    multiple of 6.
