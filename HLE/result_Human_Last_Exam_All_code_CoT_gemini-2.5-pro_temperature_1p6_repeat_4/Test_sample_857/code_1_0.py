# Goal: Determine the largest possible cardinality of the set of points where a
# hereditarily decomposable continuum X fails to be coastal.

# Step 1: State the relevant mathematical theorem.
# A key theorem in continuum theory states that for any hereditarily decomposable
# continuum, the set of non-coastal points is at most countable.
# A "countable" set is either finite or countably infinite.
theorem_bound = "Countable (finite or countably infinite)"

# Step 2: Consider examples to find the maximum possible cardinality.

# Example 1: A simple arc (e.g., the line segment [0,1]).
# An arc is a hereditarily decomposable continuum.
# Its non-coastal points are its two endpoints.
cardinality_of_endpoints_in_arc = 2

# Example 2: An infinite dendrite (a tree-like continuum).
# Construct a continuum by joining a central point to a countably infinite set of
# other points (e.g., connecting (0,1) to (1/n, 0) for all n=1, 2, 3...).
# This is a hereditarily decomposable continuum. The set of its endpoints
# is the set of non-coastal points.
# This set has a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers.
cardinality_of_endpoints_in_infinite_dendrite = "Aleph-0 (countably infinite)"

# Step 3: Conclude the largest possible cardinality.
# The theorem establishes an upper bound of countably infinite.
# The second example demonstrates that this upper bound can be achieved.
# Therefore, the largest possible cardinality is countably infinite.
largest_cardinality = cardinality_of_endpoints_in_infinite_dendrite

# Step 4: Print the final reasoning and result.
# The "equation" here is a logical deduction comparing the possible values.
print("Let S be the set of non-coastal points in a hereditarily decomposable continuum.")
print("A key theorem states that the cardinality of S, |S|, must be countable.")
print("\nThis means |S| can be a finite number or countably infinite.")
print(f"Case 1: An arc. In this case, the number of non-coastal points is {cardinality_of_endpoints_in_arc}.")
print(f"Case 2: An infinite dendrite. The number of non-coastal points is {cardinality_of_endpoints_in_infinite_dendrite}.")
print("\nThe question asks for the largest *possible* cardinality.")
print(f"Comparing the possible values (e.g., {cardinality_of_endpoints_in_arc} and others) with the demonstrated maximum, the conclusion is clear.")
print(f"\nThe largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points is {largest_cardinality}.")
