# This script will identify the incorrect statement among the choices provided.
# The task is to evaluate several scholarly claims about Saint Augustine's philosophy of "free will".

# A brief analysis of each option:
# A. Correct. Augustine's later writings heavily emphasize predestination, leading to comparisons with Calvinism.
# B. Incorrect. R. A. Markus is a renowned scholar of Augustine. His work provides a nuanced analysis of Augustine's views on freedom, predestination, and grace. It is a mischaracterization to claim he "ignored" these central concepts.
# C. Correct. Augustine's concept of the will ("voluntas") is a central part of his psychology, and his work shows influences from classical philosophy, including Stoicism (like Seneca).
# D. Correct. A hallmark of Augustinian thought is the integration of philosophy and theology. Questions of free will cannot be separated from the theology of grace.
# E. Correct. Ã‰tienne Gilson's interpretation correctly notes the "irresistible" or "victorious" nature of grace in Augustine's view, while distinguishing it from the later, more rigid Jansenist position.
# F. Correct. In his work "On Free Choice of the Will," Augustine argues against Evodius that individuals are responsible for their own actions as they are the ones who "will" them.

# The incorrect statement is B. The following code will print the corresponding letter.

incorrect_statement_letter = "B"

print(f"The incorrect statement is option {incorrect_statement_letter}.")
print("Analysis: The claim that historian R. A. Markus 'ignored' Augustine's thoughts on predestination and grace is factually inaccurate.")
print("A prominent scholar like Markus would not ignore such central tenets; rather, he provided a detailed and contextualized analysis of them.")
