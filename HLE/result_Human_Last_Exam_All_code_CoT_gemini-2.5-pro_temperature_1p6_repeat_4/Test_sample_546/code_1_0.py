# Based on the step-by-step derivation, the complex expression simplifies to 2**81.
# The given large prime p and the associated prime conditions are used to prove
# this simplification through number theory, particularly Fermat's Little Theorem
# and the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

# The final calculation is to compute 2 to the power of 81.
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result
result = base ** exponent

# The problem asks to output the numbers in the final equation.
# The simplified final equation is f(p) = 2**81.
# We will print this equation along with its computed value.
