    # Step 1: Analyze the patient's symptoms post-childbirth.
    # The patient exhibits fatigue, increased chills (cold intolerance), and loss of pubic hair.

    # The symptoms strongly suggest postpartum hypothyroidism.
    # This could be due to Sheehan's syndrome (pituitary failure) or postpartum thyroiditis.
    diagnosis = "Hypothyroidism"
    print("Likely underlying condition:", diagnosis)

    # Step 3: Analyze the dietary clue.
    # The new diet "tastes like bean salad". This suggests a diet rich in legumes (beans),
    # soy, and possibly cruciferous vegetables.
