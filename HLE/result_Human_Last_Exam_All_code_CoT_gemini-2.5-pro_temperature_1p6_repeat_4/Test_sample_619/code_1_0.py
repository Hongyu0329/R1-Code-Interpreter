    """
    Calculates the minimum value of the sum of sizes of n sets S_i
    that satisfy |S_i triangle S_j| = |i-j|.

    The problem is a known, challenging combinatorial problem. The solution can
    be derived using a vector-based construction. The minimum value is found by
    building a set of n-1 characteristic vectors that satisfy the conditions
    while ensuring all sets S_i are non-empty.

    This analysis leads to the following formula for the minimum sum:
    - If n is even, the sum is 3*n / 2.
    - If n is odd, the sum is 3*(n-1)/2 + 1.
