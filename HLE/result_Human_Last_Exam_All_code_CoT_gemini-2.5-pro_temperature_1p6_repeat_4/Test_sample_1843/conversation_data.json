    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N = 36036$ and order $6$, we follow these steps:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Decomposition of Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely written as a product of primitive characters $\\chi_{p^a}$ for each prime power factor $p^a$ in the factorization of $N$. That is, $\\chi = \\prod_{p^a || N} \\chi_{p^a}$, where each $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a primitive character with conductor $p^a$.\n\n2.  **Order of Characters**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters, i.e., $\\text{order}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{order}(\\chi_{p^a}))$. We need this lcm to be exactly 6.\n\n3.  **Prime Factorization**: First, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7^1 \\cdot 11^1 \\cdot 13^1$.\n    The conductors of the primitive component characters must be $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$.\n\n4.  **Counting Component Characters**: For each prime power conductor $d = p^a$, we need to count the number of primitive characters modulo $d$ whose order divides 6. Let's call this count $C(d)$.\n\n    *   For $d = p^a$ where $p$ is an odd prime and $a=1$, primitive characters are all non-trivial characters. Their orders are divisors of $\\phi(p) = p-1$ greater than 1.\n    *   For $d=p^a$ with $a>1$, the primitive characters are those whose order divides $\\phi(p^a)$ but not $\\phi(p^{a-1})$.\n    *   For $d=4=2^2$, the primitive character has order 2.\n\n5.  **Condition for Order 6**: For the final character's order to be 6, the lcm of the component orders must be 6. This implies:\n    a. The order of each component character must be a divisor of 6.\n    b. The set of component orders must contain at least one order divisible by 2 and at least one order divisible by 3.\n\n6.  **Calculation**: We will show that any primitive character of conductor $N=36036$ automatically has an order divisible by both 2 and 3. This means that if we count the number of characters formed by primitive components whose orders divide 6, the resulting character's order will always be exactly 6. The total number is then the product of the counts $C(d)$ for each conductor $d$.\n\nThe Python code below will perform these calculations step-by-step.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary {p: a}.\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef euler_phi_from_factors(factors):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function from prime factors.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 1\n    for p, a in factors.items():\n        result *= (p - 1) * (p**(a - 1))\n    return result\n    \ndef euler_phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    return euler_phi_from_factors(get_prime_factorization(n))\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = {1, n}\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of counting primitive Dirichlet characters.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 36036\n    target_order = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor N = {N} and order {target_order}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 1.
