    "To determine which crystal classes are achiral, non-polar, and exhibit optical activity, we need to understand the symmetry requirements for each property.\n\n**Thinking Steps:**\n\n1.  **Optical Activity:** A crystal class can exhibit optical activity if and only if it is **non-centrosymmetric**, meaning it lacks a center of inversion (i or -1). This excludes 11 of the 32 crystal classes, leaving 21 that are potentially optically active.\n\n2.  **Chirality vs. Achirality:**\n    *   A crystal class is **chiral** (or enantiomorphic) if it lacks *any* improper rotation axes (Sn), which includes mirror planes (S1 = m) and inversion centers (S2 = i). Chiral crystals are always optically active.\n    *   A crystal class is **achiral** if it possesses at least one improper rotation axis (a mirror plane or an inversion center). The question specifically asks for **achiral** classes.\n\n3.  **Polarity vs. Non-polarity:**\n    *   A crystal class is **polar** if it has a unique directional axis where one end is not symmetrically equivalent to the other. There are 10 polar crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n    *   A class is **non-polar** if it is not one of these 10 classes. The question asks for **non-polar** classes.\n\n**Filtering the Crystal Classes:**\n\n1.  Start with all 32 crystal classes.\n2.  Filter for **optical activity**: We need non-centrosymmetric classes. This leaves 21 classes.\n3.  From these 21, filter for **achirality**: We must exclude the 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432). This leaves the non-centrosymmetric, achiral classes: m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -6, -6m2 (same as -62m), and -43m.\n4.  Finally, from this list, filter for **non-polarity**: We must exclude the polar classes. The polar classes in our current list are m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm.\n\nThe remaining classes that satisfy all three conditions (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) are: **-4, -42m, -6, -6m2 (or -62m), and -43m.**\n\nNow let's check the given answer choices against our derived list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_crystal_class_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data for the 32 crystal classes: (name, is_optically_active, is_achiral, is_non_polar)\n    # is_optically_active: True if non-centrosymmetric.\n    # is_achiral: True if it has a mirror plane or inversion center.\n    # is_non_polar: True if it's not one of the 10 polar classes.\n    crystal_classes_data = [\n        # Triclinic\n        ('1', True, False, False), ('-1', False, True, True),\n        # Monoclinic\n        ('2', True, False, False), ('m', True, True, False), ('2/m', False, True, True),\n        # Orthorhombic\n        ('222', True, False, True), ('mm2', True, True, False), ('mmm', False, True, True),\n        # Tetragonal\n        ('4', True, False, False), ('-4', True, True, True), ('4/m', False, True, True),\n        ('422', True, False, True), ('4mm', True, True, False), ('-42m', True, True, True),\n        ('4/mmm', False, True, True),\n        # Trigonal\n        ('3', True, False, False), ('-3', False, True, True), ('32', True, False, True),\n        ('3m', True, True, False), ('-3m', False, True, True),\n        # Hexagonal\n        ('6', True, False, False), ('-6', True, True, True), ('6/m', False, True, True),\n        ('622', True, False, True), ('6mm', True, True, False), ('-6m2', True, True, True), # -6m2 is same as -62m\n        ('6/mmm', False, True, True),\n        # Cubic\n        ('23', True, False, True), ('m-3', False, True, True), ('432', True, False, True),\n        ('-43m', True, True, True), ('m-3m', False, True, True)\n    ]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the criteria for the crystal classes.\")\n    print(\" - Optically Active: Must be non-centrosymmetric (no center of inversion).\")\n    print(\" - Achiral: Must possess an improper rotation axis (e.g., a mirror plane).\")\n    print(\" - Non-polar: Must not have a unique directional axis.\\n\")\n\n    qualifying_classes = []\n    for name, opt_active, achiral, non_polar in crystal_classes_data:\n        if opt_active and achiral and non_polar:\n            qualifying_classes.append(name)\n    \n    # Sort for consistent output, handle notation variants\n    qualifying_classes_set = set(qualifying_classes)\n    # Add the alternative notation for display purposes if its equivalent is present\n    if '-6m2' in qualifying_classes_set:\n        qualifying_classes_set.add('-62m')\n        \n    print(\"Step 2: Find all classes that meet these three criteria.\")\n    print(\"The crystal classes which are optically active, achiral, AND non-polar are:\")\n    print(sorted(list(qualifying_classes))) # Print original notation\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Evaluate the given answer choices.\\n\")\n    \n    choices = {\n        'A': ['m', 'mm2'],\n        'B': ['-6', '-62m', '-43m'],\n        'C': ['3m', '4mm', '6mm'], # Original question has 4m, corrected to 4mm\n        'D': ['-4', '-42m'],\n        'E': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '6']\n    }\n\n    correct_choice = ''\n    for choice_letter, classes_in_choice in choices.items():\n        is_correct = all(c in qualifying_classes_set for c in classes_in_choice)\n        # To be the \"best\" answer, it should contain a good representation of the list.\n        # B is the most complete answer among the choices that don't list classes that fail the criteria.\n        print(f\"Choice {choice_letter}: {classes_in_choice}\")\n        if is_correct:\n            # Check why other choices are wrong\n            if choice_letter == 'A' or choice_letter == 'C':\n                print(\"   Reasoning: These classes are POLAR.
