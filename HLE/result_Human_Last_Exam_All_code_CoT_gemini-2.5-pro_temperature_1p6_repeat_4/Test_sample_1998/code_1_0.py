    This problem asks for the smallest natural number N such that for every anisotropic quadratic form Q
    in N variables over a field K, the map defined by Q is surjective.

    The field K is a complete discretely valued field of characteristic 2, whose residue field k is a
    local field of characteristic 2. This means K is a 2-dimensional local field, isomorphic to
    a field of iterated Laurent series like F_q((t))((pi)).

    The solution to this problem is given by the u-invariant of the field K. The u-invariant, u(K), is
    the maximum possible dimension of an anisotropic quadratic form over K.

    The argument proceeds in three steps:
    1. For any dimension M < u(K), there exists an anisotropic quadratic form Q of dimension M. For fields of
       characteristic 2, a quadratic form is surjective if and only if it is isotropic. Since Q is
       anisotropic, it is not surjective. Thus, the desired number N must be at least u(K).

    2. For the dimension N = u(K), let Q be any anisotropic quadratic form. For any element c in K, the form
       Q - cZ^2 has dimension u(K)+1. By definition of the u-invariant, this form must be isotropic.
       A short argument shows that this implies Q represents c. Since this holds for all c, Q is surjective.

    3. For any dimension N > u(K), there are no anisotropic forms, so the condition holds vacuously.

    Combining these points, the smallest such N is u(K).

    The u-invariant of a 2-dimensional local field of characteristic 2, such as K, is known to be 8.
    This is a result from advanced quadratic form theory (Parimala-Suresh, 2010).

    Therefore, the smallest such natural number N is 8.
