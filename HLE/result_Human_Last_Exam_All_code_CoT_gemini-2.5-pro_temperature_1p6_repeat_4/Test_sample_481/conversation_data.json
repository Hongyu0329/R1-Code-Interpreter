    "Based on publicly available drug identification information, the numerical imprints on the Teva brand fluoxetine capsules differ by their strength. The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3105, while the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 3106.\n\nThe following Python code will print this information.\n\n```python\n# Define the strengths and their corresponding numerical imprints\nstrength_10mg = 10\nnumber_10mg = 3105\n\nstrength_20mg = 20\nnumber_20mg = 3106\n\n# Print the results\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine {strength_10mg}mg capsule is {number_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the Teva brand fluoxetine {strength_20mg}mg capsule is {number_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<The numbers imprinted on the capsules are 3105 for the 10mg strength and 3106 for the 20mg strength.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What are the different numbers imprinted on the capsules between Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules and Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules?
