    Calculates the number of positive integers n for which the n-cube [0,1]^n
    fails to occur as the set of non-block points of a continuum.

    The reasoning is based on the following topological analysis:
    1.  If the set of non-block points N(X) is homeomorphic to [0,1]^n,
        it can be proven that the continuum X must also be homeomorphic to [0,1]^n.
    2.  The problem thus simplifies to finding for which n is N([0,1]^n) not equal to [0,1]^n.
    3.  For n=1, removing an interior point from [0,1] disconnects the space,
        making that point a "block point". Thus, N([0,1]) is not equal to [0,1].
    4.  For n>=2, removing any point from [0,1]^n leaves the space connected
        (specifically, path-connected and thus continuum-connected).
        This implies all points are non-block points, so N([0,1]^n) = [0,1]^n.
    5.  Therefore, the only value of n for which the n-cube fails is n=1.
