    "This is a biological question that requires accessing and presenting specialized neuroanatomical information. I will formulate a plan to find the answer and then use a Python script to present the information clearly, as requested by the prompt instructions.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will access neuroanatomical knowledge about cephalopods, specifically the dwarf cuttlefish (*Sepia bandensis*) or closely related species.\n2.  I will identify the location and function of the palliovisceral lobe within the cuttlefish brain structure (specifically, the posterior subesophageal mass).\n3.  I will then identify the structures that are anatomically positioned posteriorly (towards the rear of the animal) to this lobe.\n4.  Finally, I will create a Python script to store and print this information in a clear and organized manner.\n\n```python\ndef get_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the brain regions adjacent\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    The data is based on cephalopod neuroanatomical studies.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A simplified map of brain region adjacencies in the cuttlefish posterior brain\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the posterior subesophageal mass.\n    cuttlefish_posterior_brain = {\n        \"palliovisceral_lobe\": {\n            \"description\": \"A lobe in the posterior subesophageal mass that controls the mantle, fins, and viscera.\",\n            \"posteriorly_adjacent_regions\": [\n                \"Giant Fiber Lobe (GFL)\",\n                \"Origins of the main pallial and visceral nerves\"\n            ]\n        },\n        \"giant_fiber_lobe\": {\n            \"description\": \"Closely associated with the palliovisceral lobe, it contains the giant neurons that control the fast jet-escape response.\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    target_lobe = \"palliovisceral_lobe\"\n    if target_lobe in cuttlefish_posterior_brain:\n        adjacent_regions = cuttlefish_posterior_brain[target_lobe][\"posteriorly_adjacent_regions\"]\n        \n        print(f\"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the {target_lobe.replace('_', ' ')} are:\")\n        for region in adjacent_regions:\n            print(f\"- {region}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Information for '{target_lobe}' not found.\")\n\n# Execute the function to get the answer\nget_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The primary brain region lying adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe is the Giant Fiber Lobe (GFL). Additionally, the origins of the main pallial and visceral nerves, which extend posteriorly to innervate the body, are also located at the posterior aspect of the palliovisceral lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
