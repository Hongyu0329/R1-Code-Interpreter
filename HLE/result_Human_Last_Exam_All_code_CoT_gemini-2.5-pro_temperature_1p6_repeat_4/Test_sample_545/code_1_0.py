# The reaction involves a two-step sequence:
# 1. A syn-elimination (pyrolysis) of the sulfoxide to form a vinyl ether.
# 2. An immediate [3,3]-sigmatropic Claisen rearrangement of the vinyl ether.

# The final product is an unsaturated aldehyde with the structure:
# O=CH-CH2-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2

# To generate the IUPAC name:
# - The principal functional group is the aldehyde (-al), which is C1.
# - The longest carbon chain including C1 is 6 carbons long (hexan-).
#   Path: CHO(1)-CH2(2)-CH2(3)-CH(4)=C(5)(CH3)-CH3(6)
# - The double bond starts at C4 (hex-4-enal).
# - A methyl group is a substituent on C5 (5-methyl).
