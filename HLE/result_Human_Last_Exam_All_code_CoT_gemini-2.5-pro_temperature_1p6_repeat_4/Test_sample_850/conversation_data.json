    "Based on the principles of crystallography, the conditions you've described are mutually exclusive. Here is an explanation of why, followed by a Python script that demonstrates it programmatically.\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Define the Conditions:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** This property requires a crystal structure to be *chiral*. A chiral structure is one whose mirror image is not superimposable on itself. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal class must **not** contain any inversion centers, mirror planes, or rotoinversion axes (like 4-bar or 6-bar). There are 11 such chiral (and thus optically active) crystal classes.\n    *   **Achiral:** This is the opposite of chiral. An achiral crystal class **must** contain an inversion center, a mirror plane, or another rotoinversion axis.\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction, meaning it lacks a spontaneous electric dipole moment. All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar, along with several non-centrosymmetric ones.\n\n2.  **Identify the Contradiction:**\n    The core of your question contains a contradiction. You are asking for crystal classes that are simultaneously **achiral** and **optically active**. By definition, optical activity only exists in **chiral** classes. Therefore, no crystal class can be both achiral and optically active.\n\n3.  **Execute a Script to Prove It:**\n    The following Python script will define the sets of crystal classes for each property (achiral, non-polar, and optically active) and then calculate their intersection. The result will be an empty set, confirming that no such crystal classes exist.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystallographic point groups to find those that are\n    achiral, non-polar, and optically active, and explains the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Using standard Hermann-Mauguin notation.\n    # Note: -n is used to represent n-bar (e.g., -1 is 1-bar).\n    all_32_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm',\n        '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm',\n        '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m',\n        '6', '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm',\n        '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n\n    # Condition 1: Optically Active (the 11 Chiral classes)\n    # These lack any mirror planes (m) or inversion centers (-1).\n    optically_active_classes = {\n        '1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'\n    }\n\n    # Condition 2: Achiral classes\n    # These are all classes that are NOT chiral.\n    achiral_classes = all_32_classes - optically_active_classes\n\n    # Condition 3: Non-polar classes\n    # Polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.
