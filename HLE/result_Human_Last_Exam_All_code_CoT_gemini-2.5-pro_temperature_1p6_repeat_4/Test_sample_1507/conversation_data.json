    "To solve this problem, we first need to identify the shape of the \"outer-hull\" of the great icosahedron. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, but its convex hull (the smallest convex shape that contains it) is a regular icosahedron.\n\nA regular icosahedron is a convex polyhedron made up of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces. The question asks for the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\" this shape. Since the faces of a regular icosahedron are already triangles, the surface is already triangulated in the most minimal way possible. Therefore, the problem simplifies to finding the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n\nWe can calculate this using Euler's formula for convex polyhedra, which states:\nV - E + F = 2\nwhere V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n\nFor a regular icosahedron:\n*   Number of vertices (V) = 12\n*   Number of edges (E) = 30\n\nWe can plug these values into the formula and solve for F.\n\nThe following Python code performs this calculation.\n\n```python\n# The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# We need to find the number of its faces, which are already triangles.\n# We can use Euler's formula for convex polyhedra: V - E + F = 2\n# where V = vertices, E = edges, and F = faces.\n\n# A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices.\nV = 12\n# A regular icosahedron has 30 edges.\nE = 30\n# The characteristic of any convex polyhedron is 2.\nchi = 2\n\n# Rearranging Euler's formula to solve for F: F = chi - V + E\nF = chi - V + E\n\nprint(f\"The calculation is based on Euler's formula for polyhedra: V - E + F = {chi}\")\nprint(f\"For the regular icosahedron (the outer-hull), V = {V} and E = {E}.\")\nprint(\"The final equation to find the number of faces (F) is:\")\nprint(f\"{V} - {E} + F = {chi}\")\nprint(f\"Solving for F gives F = {chi} - {V} + {E}, which results in F = {F}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the minimal number of triangles is {F}.\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"
