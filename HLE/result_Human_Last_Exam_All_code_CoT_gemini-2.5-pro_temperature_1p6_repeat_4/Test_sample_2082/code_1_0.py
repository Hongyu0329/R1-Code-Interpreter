# The user's question is about the physiological mechanism of magnesium in lowering blood pressure.
# The primary mechanism is magnesium's role as a natural calcium channel blocker.

# Option A: Through direct vasodilation
# Calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle causes vasoconstriction. Magnesium acts as a
# calcium antagonist, inhibiting this influx. This leads to vascular smooth muscle relaxation,
# resulting in vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. This is a correct and primary mechanism.

# Option B: By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition
# This is a potential long-term benefit of adequate magnesium levels in preventing arteriosclerosis,
# but it is not the direct mechanism for lowering blood pressure via supplementation.

# Option C: By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain
# This is not a mechanism for blood pressure regulation.

# Option D: By stimulating an inflammatory response
# This is incorrect. Magnesium has anti-inflammatory effects.

# Option E: It raises systemic blood calcium levels
# This is incorrect. Magnesium is a calcium antagonist.

# The most accurate answer is A.
