# The patient's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level.
hba1c = 7.5

# The standard formula for converting HbA1c to estimated Average Glucose (eAG) in mg/dL is:
# eAG = (28.7 * HbA1c) - 46.7

# Assign coefficients for clarity
coefficient_a = 28.7
coefficient_b = 46.7

# Calculate the estimated Average Glucose (eAG)
eag_result = (coefficient_a * hba1c) - coefficient_b

# Print the calculation and the final result
