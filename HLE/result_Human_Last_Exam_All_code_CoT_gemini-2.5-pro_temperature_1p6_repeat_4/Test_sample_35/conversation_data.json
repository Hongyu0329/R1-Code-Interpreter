    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct hand to shove all-in with:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Poker Scenario:**\n    *   **Position:** UTG+1 (Under The Gun + 1) is an early position. You act before most of the table, which means you should generally play a tighter range of hands.\n    *   **Stack Size:** 16 big blinds (16bb) is a short stack. This stack size is ideal for a \"push/fold\" strategy, where your only moves are to go all-in or fold.\n    *   **Situation:** \"Near the money bubble\" is a crucial factor. Most players will tighten up their calling ranges significantly to avoid busting out of the tournament just before getting paid. This increases your \"fold equity,\" meaning your all-in shoves are more likely to get through without being called.\n\n2.  **Establish a Standard Shoving Range:**\n    *   Based on Game Theory Optimal (GTO) play for this position and stack size, a standard shoving range is relatively tight. On the bubble, we can be a bit more aggressive due to the increased fold equity.\n    *   A typical UTG+1 shoving range with ~16bb is approximately: Pocket Pairs 77 or better, Ace-Jack offsuit or better, King-Queen offsuit, suited Aces like A9s or better, and suited Kings like KTs or better.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Answer Choices:**\n    *   **A. QJs (Queen-Jack suited):** This hand is generally considered too weak to shove from an early position with 16bb, even with bubble dynamics. It's often dominated if called.\n    *   **C. 99 (Pocket Nines):** This is a strong medium pair. It is well within the standard shoving range (77+). It benefits greatly from fold equity and is often in a \"coin flip\" situation (roughly 50/50) against the big card hands that might call you (like AK, AQ).\n    *   **D. AJo (Ace-Jack offsuit):** This is a standard shoving hand. However, it's vulnerable to being dominated by stronger Ace hands (like AQ, AK) that are likely to be in an opponent's calling range.\n    *   **E. AKo (Ace-King offsuit):** This is a premium hand and an easy, obvious shove in almost any situation with this stack size.\n\n4.  **Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   We have identified three technically correct hands to shove from the list: 99, AJo, and AKo.\n    *   AKo is a premium, so it's an obvious choice.\n    *   Between 99 and AJo, 99 is arguably a more robust shove from early position. It is less likely to be dominated by a calling range than AJo.\n    *   In a multiple-choice context, 99 is an excellent answer because it represents a fundamental tournament concept: shoving medium pairs to capitalize on fold equity, especially on the bubble. While AKo is also correct, 99 demonstrates a deeper strategic understanding of the situation.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through this logic to arrive at the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_poker_shove():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker hand scenario to determine the correct all-in shove.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
