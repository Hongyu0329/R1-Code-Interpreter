# Part A: The Sherlock Holmes story is "The Adventure of the Priory School".
# The trick of faked tracks was performed using custom horseshoes on a horse.
answer_A = 7

# Part B: The allusion to a solvable puzzle (Holmes sees through the trick)
# ironically highlights the opposite condition in Pale Fire, where reliable
# inference is made impossible by the narrator.
answer_B = 6

# Part C: Nabokov's novel "The Real Life of Sebastian Knight" is structured
# as a meta-fictional detective story, where the narrator experiences and
# untangles intricate back-references to uncover a life story.
answer_C = 3

# The final answer is the three numbers separated by spaces.
# The sum of these numbers is 7 + 6 + 3 = 16, which is a multiple of 8.
