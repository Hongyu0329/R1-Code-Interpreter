    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of distinct equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Represent Quadratic Forms:** A quadratic form in two variables, $x$ and $y$, is a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$, where the coefficients $a, b, c$ are in $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. We can represent each form by a tuple `(a, b, c)`. Since there are 8 choices for each coefficient, there are $8^3 = 512$ such forms in total.\n\n2.  **Define Equivalence:** Two forms, $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, are equivalent if there exists an invertible linear transformation $T$ such that $Q_2(x, y) = Q_1(T(x, y))$. Such a transformation is represented by an invertible 2x2 matrix $M$ with entries in $R$. A matrix is invertible over $R$ if its determinant is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are the odd numbers: $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The set of all such matrices forms the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n3.  **Count Equivalence Classes (Orbits):** The problem is equivalent to finding the number of orbits of the set of all quadratic forms under the action of the group $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$. We can implement a brute-force algorithm to count these orbits:\n    a. Create a set containing all 512 possible quadratic forms.\n    b. Generate all invertible matrices in $GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z})$.\n    c. Loop until the set of forms is empty:\n        i.  Increment a counter for the number of classes.\n        ii. Pick a form from the set as a representative of a new class.\n        iii. Calculate its entire orbit by applying every invertible matrix to it.\n        iv. Remove all forms in the calculated orbit from the set of all forms.\n    d. The final value of the counter is the number of equivalence classes.\n\n4.  **Discriminant as an Invariant:** The discriminant of a form, $D = b^2 - 4ac \\pmod 8$, is an invariant under these transformations. This means all forms in the same equivalence class have the same discriminant. The possible values for the discriminant in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{0, 1, 4, 5\\}$. We can use this to group the classes and provide a more detailed answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the number of classes. It will also break down the count by the value of the discriminant.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms over Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def generate_gl2_z8():\n        \"\"\"Generates the group GL_2(Z/8Z) of invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/8Z.\"\"\"\n        matrices = []\n        for p in range(8):\n            for q in range(8):\n                for r in range(8):\n                    for s in range(8):\n                        # A matrix is invertible if its determinant is a unit in Z/8Z {1,3,5,7}\n                        det = (p * s - q * r) % 8\n                        if det in {1, 3, 5, 7}:\n                            matrices.append(((p, q), (r, s)))\n        return matrices\n\n    def transform(form, matrix):\n        \"\"\"Applies a linear transform M to a quadratic form Q, returning Q composed with M.\"\"\"\n        a, b, c = form\n        (p, q), (r, s) = matrix\n        \n        # The new coefficients (a', b', c') for Q(px+qy, rx+sy) are calculated.\n        a_prime = (a * p * p + b * p * r + c * r * r) % 8\n        b_prime = (2 * a * p * q + b * (p * s + q * r) + 2 * c * r * s) % 8\n        c_prime = (a * q * q + b * q * s + c * s * s) % 8\n        \n        return (a_prime, b_prime, c_prime)\n\n    # 1.
