    print("The question's premise is 'For an existentially forgeable digital signature scheme (e.g. ECDSA belongs to this family)'.")
    print("This premise seems contradictory, as ECDSA is designed to be existentially UNforgeable (EUF-CMA).")
    print("However, ECDSA has a property called 'signature malleability'. Given a signature (r, s), the signature (r, n-s) is also valid for the same message.")
    print("This is a specific type of existential forgery (creating a new signature for an existing message). This reconciles the premise.")
    print("We will proceed assuming 'existentially forgeable' refers to schemes that are not 'Strongly Unforgeable' (SUF-CMA), like ECDSA.\n")

    print("  Reason: Due to ECDSA's malleability, given sig = (r, s), an adversary can trivially compute sig' = (r, n-s). This new signature is valid.")
    print("  The probability of creating a new signature is 1, not 'negligible'.\n")

    print("  B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.")
    print("  Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("  Reason: The malleability of ECDSA signatures does not expose the secret key 'sk'. Key recovery remains as difficult as solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), which is computationally infeasible for a bounded adversary.\n")

    # --- Option C Analysis ---
    is_C_true = True
    print("Step 4: Analyzing Option C")
    print("  C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.")
    print("  Analysis: This is TRUE.")
    print("  Reason: This describes a 'selective forgery'. The set of 'existentially forgeable' schemes includes schemes that are broken in various ways. It is certain that *some* schemes in this set are weak enough to allow selective forgery. A scheme vulnerable to selective forgery is by definition existentially forgeable.\n")

    # --- Option D Analysis ---
    is_D_true = False

    print("  D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.")

    print("  Reason: This claims message concealment for ALL such schemes. However, signatures guarantee authenticity, not confidentiality. Textbook RSA is a counter-example: it's existentially forgeable, but the message m can be recovered from the signature sig via m = sig^e mod n.\n")
