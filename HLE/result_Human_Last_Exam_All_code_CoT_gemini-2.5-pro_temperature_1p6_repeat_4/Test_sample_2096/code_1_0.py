    This function solves the lateral thinking puzzle.

    The puzzle clues are:
    1. Being 'X' was shameful for a Pope.
    2. 'X' was "written" in the 1960s.
    3. 'X' is a single word.

    The solution is the word "Unlettered".
    - It is shameful for a Pope to be unlettered (illiterate).
    - The word plays on the 1960s hit instrumental "Telstar", which has no lyrics and is therefore "un-lettered".
