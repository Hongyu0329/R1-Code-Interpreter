# Based on the derivation, the radius R is given by the formula:
# R = sqrt(0.5 * (exp(2T) + exp(T)))
# We are given T = ln(10^34).

# From T = ln(10^34), we can deduce the exact values for the exponential terms
# to avoid potential floating-point precision loss from calculating T itself.
# exp(T) = exp(ln(10^34)) = 10^34
# exp(2T) = exp(2 * ln(10^34)) = exp(ln((10^34)^2)) = 10^68
