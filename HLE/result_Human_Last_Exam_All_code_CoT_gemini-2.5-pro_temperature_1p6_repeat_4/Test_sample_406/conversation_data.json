    "Of course. Here is an explanation of the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point, along with a Python script to demonstrate these conditions with a concrete example.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Tripled Fixed Point:** First, I will explain what an FGH-tripled fixed point is based on the provided function signatures. A point `(x, y, z)` is a tripled fixed point if, when input into the functions F, G, and H according to their specific argument structures, it returns `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.\n2.  **State the Conditions:** I will state the three mathematical equations that must be satisfied for `(x, y, z)` to be a tripled fixed point. These equations form the core conditions.\n3.  **Provide a Python Demonstration:** I will create a Python script that defines example functions for F, G, and H. The script will then test a specific point `(x, y, z)` against the three conditions, printing out each equation with the numerical values to show how the conditions are checked in practice.\n\nHere is the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Suppress DeprecationWarning for plain 'float' type hints\n# This is for cleaner output in some environments and not essential for the logic\nif not sys.warnoptions:\n    import warnings\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\", DeprecationWarning)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let's define example functions F, G, and H.\n    # We have designed these functions to have a known tripled fixed point\n    # to demonstrate a successful check.\n    def F(x: float, y: float, z: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Function F: X*Y*Z -> X\"\"\"\n        return (x + y - z) / 2\n\n    def G(y: float, x: float, y_prime: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Function G: Y*X*Y -> Y\"\"\"\n        # The function signature is G(y, x, y), so the first and third\n        # arguments will be the same value in a fixed-point check.\n        return (2 * x + y_prime) / 3\n\n    def H(z: float, y: float, x: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"Function H: Z*Y*X -> Z\"\"\"\n        return z + y - x\n\n    # Let's propose a point (x, y, z) that is a tripled fixed point for the functions above.\n    x_point = 5.0\n    y_point = 5.0\n    z_point = 0.0\n\n    print(\"A point (x, y, z) is an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following three conditions:\\n\")\n    print(\"1.
