print("--- Step 1: Decode the building blocks of the expression ---")

# In SKI combinator logic representing Church numerals:
# - 'I' represents the Church numeral for 1.
# - 'S(S(K(S))(K))' is the successor function, 'succ'. It adds one to a Church numeral.
# - 'S(I)(I)' represents the Church numeral for 2, as S(I)(I)fx reduces to f(fx).

# Key rules for evaluation:
# - For Church numerals 'a' and 'b', the application b(a) means a^b.
# - The combinator S(I)(g)(m) reduces to m(g(m)). If g(m) evaluates to a number G_m,
#   then m(g(m)) evaluates to (G_m)^m.
print("Rule: A function H created by H = S(I)(g) transforms an input m into g(m)^m.")
