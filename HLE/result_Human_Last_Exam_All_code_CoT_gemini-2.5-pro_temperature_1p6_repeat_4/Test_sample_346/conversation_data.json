    "My plan is to solve this problem by first decoding the SKI combinator expression step by step. I will not execute the SKI logic directly, but rather analyze its mathematical meaning in the context of Church numerals.\n\nHere is my thinking process:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Expression**: The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`, where `A` and `B` are themselves complex expressions.\n2.  **Evaluate A and B**:\n    *   I'll identify common patterns. The subexpression `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the standard definition of the successor function (`succ`). The combinator `I` represents the Church numeral for 1, and `S(I)(I)` reduces to the Church numeral for 2.\n    *   `A = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `succ(1)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral `2`.\n    *   `B = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is `succ(2)`, which evaluates to the Church numeral `3`.\n3.  **Analyze the Main Structure**: The simplified expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2)))))(3)`. This is a function `F` applied to `3`, where `F = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))`.\n4.  **Trace the Function's Behavior**: I need to understand what `S(I)`, `K`, and function application mean for Church numerals.\n    *   `K(c)` is a function that returns the constant numeral `c`.\n    *   In this context, for Church numerals, `b(a)` represents `a` raised to the power of `b` (`a^b`).\n    *   The expression `S(I)(g)(m)` reduces to `m(g(m))`. If `g` is a function that maps a numeral `m` to a numeral `G(m)`, then `m(g(m))` evaluates to the number `G(m)^m`.\n5.  **Step-by-Step Function Evaluation**: I will trace how the function `F` is built from the inside out:\n    *   Let `F_0(m) = K(2)` -> This gives the number `2`.\n    *   Let `F_1(m) = S(I)(F_0)(m)` -> This computes `F_0(m)^m = 2^m`.\n    *   Let `F_2(m) = S(I)(F_1)(m)` -> This computes `F_1(m)^m = (2^m)^m = 2^(m^2)`.\n    *   Let `F_3(m) = S(I)(F_2)(m)` -> This computes `F_2(m)^m = (2^(m^2))^m = 2^(m^3)`.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The entire expression is `n = F_3(3)`, so `n = 2^(3^3) = 2^27`.\n7.  **Compute the Logarithm**: The problem asks for `log_2(n)`, which is `log_2(2^27)`.\n\nThe following Python code will walk through these steps and calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\n# The task is to find log_2(n) for the Church numeral n represented by:\n# S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)))\n\nprint(\"--- Step 1: Decode the building blocks of the expression ---\")\n\n# In SKI combinator logic representing Church numerals:\n# - 'I' represents the Church numeral for 1.\n# - 'S(S(K(S))(K))' is the successor function, 'succ'.
