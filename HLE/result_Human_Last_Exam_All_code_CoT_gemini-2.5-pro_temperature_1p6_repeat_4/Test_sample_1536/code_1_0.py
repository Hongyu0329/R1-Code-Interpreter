Step-by-step Analysis:
=======================
1.  The patient's left-sided facial weakness (inability to lift eyebrow) and loss of acoustic reflex are classic signs of a Facial Nerve (CN VII) lesion.

2.  The patient's hoarseness and cough are symptoms directly related to the function of the Vagus Nerve (CN X), which controls the muscles of the larynx for phonation and is involved in the cough reflex.

3.  A mass in the thoracic cavity can directly compress the Vagus Nerve (CN X) or its major branch, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, as it passes through the chest. This provides a direct anatomical link between the thoracic mass and the patient's hoarseness.

4.  Let's evaluate the options based on this link:
    - A. Tensor tympani: Innervated by CN V. Incorrect.
    - B. Lateral rectus: Innervated by CN VI. Incorrect.
    - C. Intercostal muscles: Innervated by intercostal nerves. Incorrect.
    - D. Cricothyroid: This muscle is in the larynx and is innervated by the superior laryngeal nerve, a branch of the Vagus Nerve (CN X). Paralysis of this muscle contributes to hoarseness. This choice directly connects the thoracic mass (via CN X compression) to the symptom of hoarseness.
    - E. Stylopharyngeus: Innervated by CN IX. Incorrect.

Conclusion:
===========
The cricothyroid muscle is the most important structure among the choices because its nerve supply (the vagus nerve) passes through the thoracic cavity, where the mass is located. Compression of the vagus nerve by the mass is the most direct explanation for the patient's hoarseness.
