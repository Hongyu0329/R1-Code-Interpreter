# This script identifies the correct statements regarding multichannel quantum scattering.
# The analysis hinges on the equivalence of the "trivially coupled" property across the
# potential V(r), scattering matrix S(E), and Jost matrix F(E).

# A matrix is "trivially coupled" if a single constant transformation diagonalizes it.
# A key result in scattering theory is that V, S, and F are either all trivially
# coupled or all nontrivially coupled.

# Let's list the statements and their validity:
# Statement 1: Nontrivially coupled S(E) => Nontrivially coupled V(r). Correct. (Equivalence)
# Statement 2: Diagonal S(E) => Diagonal V(r). Correct. (A standard result from inverse scattering).
# Statement 3: Nontrivially coupled V(r) => Nontrivially coupled F(E). Correct. (Equivalence)
# Statement 4: Nontrivially coupled F(E) => Nontrivially coupled S(E). Correct. (Equivalence)
# Statement 5: Exists nontrivially coupled V(r) with diagonal F(E). Incorrect. (Diagonal F means F is trivially coupled, which implies V is trivially coupled, a contradiction).
