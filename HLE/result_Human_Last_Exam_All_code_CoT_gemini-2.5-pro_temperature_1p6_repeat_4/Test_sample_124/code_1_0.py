    Analyzes statements about probabilistic graphical models and identifies the correct ones.
    
    A: False. Approximate methods can be more efficient.
    B: False. The algorithm is not resilient to high treewidth.
    C: True. Junction tree nodes (cliques) use joint distributions (potentials).
    D: False. Contradicts the known properties of the algorithm.
    E: True. High treewidth is the primary cause of computational impracticality.
    F: False. Same as D.
    G: True. Correctly identifies the reason for the lack of resilience to high treewidth.
    H: False. The relationship is exponential, not linear.
    I: True. Efficiency diminishes exponentially as the largest clique size increases.
    J: False. Efficiency is highly dependent on clique size.
    L: True. This is a correct statement of the running intersection property.
