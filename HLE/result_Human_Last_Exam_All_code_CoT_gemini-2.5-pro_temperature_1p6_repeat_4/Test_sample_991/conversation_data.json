    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. I will solve it by breaking down the description into its visual components. Each part of the riddle describes a part of the character's shape. I will then combine these parts to reveal the final character, presenting the logic as a simple visual equation.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will interpret \"a square box\" as the enclosure radical `囗`.\n2.  I will interpret \"A wooden stick\" as a vertical line `|` and \"a ladder placed in the center\" as a crossing horizontal line `一`.\n3.  These two inner parts, the stick and the ladder rung, combine to form a cross `十`.\n4.  Finally, placing the cross `十` inside the box `囗` forms the character `田`.\n5.  The Python code will print this construction in an equation-like format.\n\n```python\ndef solve_character_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into components\n    and displaying the construction as an equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # --- Component Analysis ---\n    # \"a square box\" is the enclosure radical.\n    box_component = \"囗\"\n    \n    # \"A wooden stick\" (vertical line) + \"a ladder\" (horizontal line)\n    # together form a cross shape.\n    inner_component = \"十\"\n    \n    # The final character is the inner component inside the box.\n    final_character = \"田\"\n\n    # --- Print the solution ---\n    print(\"The riddle describes the parts of a character, which can be shown as an equation.\")\n    print(\"Here are the components of the final character from the 'equation':\")\n    # Using format to make it clear we are printing each part of the \"equation\"\n    print(f\"Part 1 (box): {box_component}\")\n    print(f\"Part 2 (stick and ladder): {inner_component}\")\n    print(f\"Result (character): {final_character}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe full visual equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{box_component} + {inner_component} = {final_character}\")\n\nsolve_character_riddle()\n```\n<<<田>>>"
