    This problem asks for the smallest possible number of nondegenerate, locally connected components of a set F satisfying a self-similarity equation.

    1. The equation is F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4. The set D consists of points with x-coordinates 0 or 3.
    2. This structure splits the set F into two disjoint parts:
       - F_L, which lives in the vertical strip [0, 1/4] x [0,1].
       - F_R, which lives in the vertical strip [3/4, 1] x [0,1].
    3. Any connected component of F must therefore lie entirely in F_L or F_R.
    4. Let n_L and n_R be the number of components in F_L and F_R, respectively.
    5. The self-similarity equation leads to a system of equations for these counts:
       n_L = n_L + n_R
       n_R = n_L + n_R
    6. From n_L = n_L + n_R, we must conclude that n_R = 0.
    7. From n_R = n_L + n_R, we must conclude that n_L = 0.
    8. This implies that any set F satisfying the equation must have 0 components, meaning F must be the empty set.
    9. The empty set vacuously satisfies the condition of having 0 components that are nondegenerate and locally connected.

    # The derivation leads to the conclusion that the only possible solution that doesn't lead to a contradiction
    # is the empty set. The number of components is therefore 0.
