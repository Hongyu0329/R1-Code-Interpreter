    Prints the rules added by the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm.
    
    This solution is based on a corrected precedence (g < h < f) for the term ordering,
    as the original problem statement (f < g < h) leads to a non-terminating system where
    one rule's terms are incomparable.
    
    The new rules generated are:
    1. g(g(g(x))) -> g(x)
    2. h(x) -> g(x)
    
    They are listed in increasing order of their left-hand side based on the LPO.
