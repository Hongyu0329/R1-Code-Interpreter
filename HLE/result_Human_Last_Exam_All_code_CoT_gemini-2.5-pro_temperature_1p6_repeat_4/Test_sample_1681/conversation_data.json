    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This involves three main steps:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: An initial quantum state is prepared. The problem asks us to design an optimal initial state, which in this context means a maximally entangled state. This state is created by applying an entangling operator `J` to the initial classical state `|CC⟩` (represented as `|00⟩`).\n    `|ψ_in⟩ = J |00⟩` where `J = (1/√2)(I ⊗ I + i σ_x ⊗ σ_x)`.\n\n2.  **Strategy Application**: Each player chooses a strategy, which is a unitary operator applied to their respective qubit. The classical strategies Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), along with a new quantum strategy (Q), are represented by specific matrices:\n    *   `C = I` (Identity matrix)\n    *   `D = iσ_x` (Pauli-X matrix times `i`)\n    *   `Q = iσ_z` (Pauli-Z matrix times `i`)\n\n3.  **Measurement**: A final disentangling operator `J†` is applied, and the state is measured. The probabilities of the four classical outcomes (`CC`, `CD`, `DC`, `DD`) are determined from the final state. The expected payoff for each player is then calculated using these probabilities and the given payoff matrix.\n\nAn equilibrium (specifically, a Nash Equilibrium) is a pair of strategies where neither player can improve their own payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. We will write a Python script to calculate the payoffs for different strategy combinations and show that the strategy pair `(Q, Q)` is a Nash Equilibrium, leading to a payoff of (5, 5), which resolves the dilemma of the classical game (where the equilibrium is (1, 1)).\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef print_payoff_calculation(player_name, payoffs, probs):\n    \"\"\"Prints the detailed payoff calculation.\"\"\"\n    p_cc, p_cd, p_dc, p_dd = probs\n    r, s, t, p = payoffs\n    total_payoff = p_cc * r + p_cd * s + p_dc * t + p_dd * p\n    print(f\"  {player_name}'s payoff equation: {r:.1f}*{p_cc:.2f} + {s:.1f}*{p_cd:.2f} + {t:.1f}*{p_dc:.2f} + {p:.1f}*{p_dd:.2f} = {total_payoff:.2f}\")\n    return total_payoff\n\ndef calculate_payoffs(Ua, Ub, psi_in, J_dag, payoff_matrix):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the final state and expected payoffs for players A and B.\"\"\"\n    \n    # Combine players' strategies\n    U_combined = np.kron(Ua, Ub)\n    \n    # Calculate the final state before measurement\n    psi_f = J_dag @ U_combined @ psi_in\n    \n    # Calculate probabilities of the four outcomes |CC>, |CD>, |DC>, |DD>\n    probs = np.abs(psi_f.flatten())**2\n    p_cc, p_cd, p_dc, p_dd = probs\n    \n    # Payoffs from the matrix: R, S, T, P\n    # [[(R,R) , (S,T)],\n    #  [(T,S) , (P,P)]]\n    R = payoff_matrix[0, 0, 0] # Cooperate-Cooperate (Reward)\n    S = payoff_matrix[0, 1, 0] # Cooperate-Defect (Sucker)\n    T = payoff_matrix[1, 0, 0] # Defect-Cooperate (Temptation)\n    P = payoff_matrix[1, 1, 0] # Defect-Defect (Punishment)\n\n    payoffs_A = np.array([R, S, T, P])\n    payoffs_B = np.array([R, T, S, P])\n\n    print(f\"  Probabilities (CC, CD, DC, DD): ({p_cc:.2f}, {p_cd:.2f}, {p_dc:.2f}, {p_dd:.2f})\")\n    \n    payoff_A = print_payoff_calculation(\"Player A\", payoffs_A, probs)\n    payoff_B = print_payoff_calculation(\"Player B\", payoffs_B, probs)\n    \n    return (payoff_A, payoff_B)\n\n\ndef solve_quantum_dilemma():\n    \"\"\"\n    Sets up and solves the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma, printing the analysis.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff Matrix [[(A,B), (A,B)], [(A,B), (A,B)]]\n    # Upper-left: (Cooperate, Cooperate), Bottom-right: (Defect, Defect)\n    payoff_matrix = np.array([\n        [(5, 5), (0, 7)],\n        [(7, 0), (1, 1)]\n    ])\n\n    # Define quantum operators (Pauli matrices and Identity)\n    I = np.eye(2, dtype=complex)\n    sx = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0]], dtype=complex)\n    sz = np.array([[1, 0], [0, -1]], dtype=complex)\n\n    # Define player strategies\n    C = I              # Cooperate\n    D = 1j * sx        # Defect\n    Q = 1j * sz        # Quantum\n    \n    strategies = {'C': C, 'D': D, 'Q': Q}\n\n    # Define initial state and entangling/disentangling operators\n    J = (1 / np.sqrt(2)) * (np.kron(I, I) + 1j * np.kron(sx, sx))\n    J_dag = J.conj().T\n    psi_00 = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0], dtype=complex).reshape(4, 1)\n    psi_in = J @ psi_00\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma:\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
