    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  **Understand Rule 110**: First, I need to represent the logic of Rule 110. A 1D cellular automaton's rule is defined by the outcome for all 8 possible states of a cell and its two immediate neighbors. The number 110 in binary is `01101110`. This 8-bit string gives the output for the 8 neighbor patterns, from `111` down to `000`. I will create a mapping (like a Python dictionary) from each 3-cell pattern to its resulting state.\n    *   `111` -> `0`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `000` -> `0`\n2.  **Initialize the Automaton**: The starting condition is a single cell in state `1`. I'll create a 1D list or array representing the cells, mostly filled with `0`s, with a single `1` placed in the center. The width of this array needs to be large enough to contain the pattern's growth over 20 generations. A width of `(2 * 20) + 1 = 41` is the minimum required, but I will use a larger width for safety.\n3.  **Run the Simulation**: I will loop 20 times to simulate the 20 generations. In each iteration, I'll calculate the next state of the automaton. I'll create a new list for the next generation. For each cell in the current generation, I will look at its neighborhood (the cell itself, and its left and right neighbors), find the corresponding output from the Rule 110 map, and record it in the new list. After processing all cells, the new list becomes the current list for the next iteration.\n4.  **Output the Final Pattern**: After 20 iterations, I will have the final state in the list. To present the result clearly, I will remove the extra `0`s from the beginning and end of the list and then print the resulting binary pattern as a string of numbers.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Rule 110 for 20 generations starting from a single '1' cell\n    and prints the final binary pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    generations = 20\n    rule_number = 110\n\n    # Rule 110 as a binary string: 01101110\n    rule_bits = format(rule_number, '08b')\n\n    # Create a dictionary to map neighborhood patterns to the rule's output.\n    # Patterns are (left, center, right)\n    # The order of patterns is from '111' (7) down to '000' (0)\n    rules = {}\n    for i in range(8):\n        # Format 'i' as a 3-digit binary number (e.g., 7 -> '111', 6 -> '110')\n        pattern = tuple(map(int, list(format(7 - i, '03b'))))\n        # Map this pattern to the corresponding bit in the rule string\n        rules[pattern] = int(rule_bits[i])\n\n    # Initialize the grid.
