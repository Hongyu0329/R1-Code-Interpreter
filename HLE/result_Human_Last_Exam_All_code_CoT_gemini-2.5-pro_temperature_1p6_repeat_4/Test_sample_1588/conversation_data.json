    "To determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a known result from the theory of Lie algebras. The BCH formula expresses `log(exp(X)exp(Y))` as a series of nested commutators of `X` and `Y`. The terms of a specific order `n` form a basis for the free Lie algebra on two generators (`X` and `Y`) of degree `n`. The dimension of this space, which corresponds to the number of linearly independent commutators (and thus nonzero coefficients), is given by Witt's formula.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **State Witt's Formula**: The formula for the dimension `L_n(k)` of the homogeneous subspace of degree `n` in the free Lie algebra on `k` generators is:\n    `L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n    where the sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`, and `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n2.  **Apply to the problem**: For this problem, we need to find the number of coefficients of order `n=10` with `k=2` generators (X and Y).\n\n3.  **Implement the components in Python**:\n    *   A function to find all divisors `d` of `n=10`.\n    *   A function to compute the Möbius function `μ(d)`. The Möbius function is defined as:\n        *   `μ(d) = 1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n        *   `μ(d) = -1` if `d` is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n        *   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n        *   By convention, `μ(1) = 1`.\n    *   A main script to iterate through the divisors of 10, calculate each term of the sum in Witt's formula, sum them up, and finally divide by `n=10`.\n\n4.  **Print the calculation**: The final script will print each step of the calculation to show how the final number is derived, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while (temp_num % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    if len(factors) % 2 == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return -1\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the \n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the detailed calculation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # Order of the expansion\n    k = 2   # Number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for order n={n} and k={k} generators.\")\n    print(\"Using Witt's formula: L_n(k) = (1/n) * sum_{d|n} (mu(d) * k^(n/d))\\n\")\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The positive divisors 'd' of n={n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n    \n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_terms = []\n    \n    print(\"Calculating each term of the summation mu(d) * k^(n/d):\")\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term = mu_d * (k ** power)\n        total_sum += term\n        \n        # Storing for the final equation printout\n        sum_terms.append(str(term))\n        \n        print(f\"For d={d}: mu({d}) * {k}^({n}/{d}) = {mu_d} * {k}^{power} = {term}\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    print(\"\\nPutting it all together:\")\n    equation_sum = \" + \".join(sum_terms).replace(\"+ -\", \"- \")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ({equation_sum})\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * ({total_sum})\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {result}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} is {result}.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_bch_coefficients()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
