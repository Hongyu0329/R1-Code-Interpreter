    "My plan is to identify the specific protein related to your biological question. Then, I will create a Python script to present this information. The protein in question is a key part of the immune system's response in the brain. The breakdown of this protein into active components acts as a signal, or \"opsonin,\" which marks the amyloid for engulfment by immune cells like macrophages and microglia.\n\nThe script will define the protein and related components as variables and then print a step-by-step explanation of the process, satisfying the requirement to display all parts of a conceptual \"equation\".\n\n```python\ndef explain_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the protein whose breakdown facilitates macrophage\n    engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the key components of the biological process\n    protein_full_name = \"Complement component 3\"\n    protein_short_name = \"C3\"\n    active_fragment = \"C3b\"\n    cell_type = \"Macrophage / Microglia\"\n    target = \"Amyloid\"\n\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down, allows for the engulfment of {target} by a {cell_type} is {protein_full_name} ({protein_short_name}).\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a conceptual equation of the process:\")\n    \n    # Print out each part of the \"equation\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The protein '{protein_short_name}' is cleaved.\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: This breakdown produces an active fragment, '{active_fragment}'.\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: The '{active_fragment}' fragment coats the {target}, flagging it for removal.\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: A '{cell_type}' recognizes '{active_fragment}' and engulfs the {target}.\")\n\nexplain_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
