    This script solves a problem in set theory concerning infinite sets.
    The problem statement is as follows:

    Let S be a collection of infinite subsets of omega (the natural numbers),
    with |S| < 2^omega. If the Continuum Hypothesis (CH) is true, does
    there always exist an infinite subset x of omega such that for every s in S,
    the intersection of x and s is finite?
    (In symbols: |x intersect s| < omega)

    This script provides a step-by-step proof to answer this question.

    print("We are asked to assume the Continuum Hypothesis (CH).")
    print("CH states that 2^omega = aleph_1, the first uncountable cardinal.")
    print("The condition |S| < 2^omega, under CH, means |S| < aleph_1.")
    print("This implies that S must be a countable (or finite) collection of sets.")
    print("So, we can list the members of S as S = {s_0, s_1, s_2, ...}.\n")

    print("Step 2: Stating the question more concretely.")

    print("This is simply the set x with the element n removed from it (if n was in x).")
    print(f"So, x intersect s_n = x \\ {{n}}.")
    print("\nNow, we ask: what is the size of this intersection, |x \\ {n}|?")
    print("Since x is an infinite set, if we remove at most one element from it, the resulting set is still infinite.")
