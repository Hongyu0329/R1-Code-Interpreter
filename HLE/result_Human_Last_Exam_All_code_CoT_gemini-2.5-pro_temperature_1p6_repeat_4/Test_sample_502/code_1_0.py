# The dimension of the quotient ring R/I, known as the coinvariant algebra,
# is equal to the order of the group G' that acts on the vector space.
# Let the abstract group be G, with |G| = 10000.
# The action is given by a representation rho: G -> GL(C^10).
# The acting group is G' = rho(G).
# The dimension of R/I is |G'|.

# By the first isomorphism theorem, |G'| = |G| / |ker(rho)|.
# To maximize this dimension, we need to minimize the order of the kernel, |ker(rho)|.

# The minimum possible order for a subgroup (the kernel) is 1.
# This corresponds to the case where rho is a faithful representation.

# Define the order of the abstract group G.
G_order = 10000

# Define the minimum possible order for the kernel of the representation.
min_ker_order = 1

# Calculate the maximum possible dimension.
# This requires showing that a group of order 10000 can have a faithful
# 10-dimensional representation. As shown in the reasoning, such groups exist
# (e.g., (Z/10Z)^4 or Z/10000Z).
max_dimension = G_order / min_ker_order

# Print the final calculation as an equation.
