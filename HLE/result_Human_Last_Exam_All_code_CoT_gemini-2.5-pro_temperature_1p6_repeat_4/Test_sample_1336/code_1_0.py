def solve_group_theory_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the question about the number of smooth coverings.
    The solution is based on an interpretation of the problem within the representation theory of finite groups,
    specifically concerning Schur indices over the rational field Q.

    The problem asks for the total number of "smooth coverings" D(SL(2,p), b, w) of D(PSL(2,p), b, w).
    This is interpreted as counting the simple components of the rational group algebra Q[SL(2,p)]
    that are "non-split" (i.e., matrix algebras over a non-commutative division algebra), which correspond
    to irreducible characters with a Schur index greater than 1 over Q.

    A theorem by W. Feit states that for p > 3, SL(2,p) has exactly four irreducible characters with a
    Schur index of 2 over Q. These are the four cuspidal characters. They consist of two pairs.
    """

    # According to Feit's theorem, the number of irreducible characters of SL(2,p) with Schur index 2 is 4.
    # These can be grouped into two pairs based on their character degrees.
    
    # Number of characters in the first pair (degree (p-1)/2)
    num_pair1 = 2
    
    # Number of characters in the second pair (degree (p+1)/2)
    num_pair2 = 2

    # The total number is the sum of the counts of these characters.
    total = num_pair1 + num_pair2
