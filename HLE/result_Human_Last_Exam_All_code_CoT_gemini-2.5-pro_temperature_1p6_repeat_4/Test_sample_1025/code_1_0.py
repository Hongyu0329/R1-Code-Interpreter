# This script formalizes the reasoning for the document ranking task.

# Ranking for Question 1: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Document 1 mentions the change happened "at a few months old".
# This is more relevant to the term "baby" than Document 2's "as they reached puberty".
q1_rank = 1

# Ranking for Question 2: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both documents contain the identical, relevant sentence: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# They are equally relevant. We apply a tie-breaking rule to favor the document
# already selected for the previous question.
# Since Doc 1 was chosen for Q1, we choose it again.
q2_rank = 1

# The final "equation" is the pair of ranks.
print(f"The rank chosen for Question 1 is: {q1_rank}")
print(f"The rank chosen for Question 2 is: {q2_rank}")

# The combined result corresponds to answer choice A.
final_answer_code = "A"
print(f"This corresponds to answer choice: {final_answer_code}")

print("<<<A>>>")
