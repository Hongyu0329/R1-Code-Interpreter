    "Based on scientific descriptions of the skull of *Irritator challengeri*, the lacrimal recess is a specific feature within the larger antorbital fossa. My plan is to consult the relevant paleontological literature to find the description of this anatomical feature and then use a Python script to present the number of depressions found within it.\n\nThe scientific paper \"Irritator challengeri, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\" by Sues, Frey, Martill, and Scott (2002) provides a detailed description of the skull. This paper states that the lacrimal recess is subdivided by a strut of bone into two smaller depressions.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to state this finding clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_lacrimal_recess_depressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of Irritator challengeri.\n\n    According to Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri\n    is subdivided by a vertical strut of bone.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # There is one lacrimal recess.\n    number_of_lacrimal_recesses = 1\n    \n    # This single recess is divided into two smaller depressions.\n    number_of_depressions_in_recess = 2\n    \n    # The final count of depressions within the recess is 2.\n    final_count = number_of_lacrimal_recesses * number_of_depressions_in_recess\n    \n    print(f\"The single ({number_of_lacrimal_recesses}) lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri is subdivided, containing a total of {final_count} depressions.\")\n\nget_lacrimal_recess_depressions()\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
