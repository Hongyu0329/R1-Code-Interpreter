    "To solve this problem, we need to enumerate all possible structures of a finite Weyl group of rank 4. A finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a unique direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product group is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible components. Therefore, the task is equivalent to finding all the ways to partition the integer 4 into the ranks of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **List Irreducible Groups by Rank:** Identify the number of non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank from 1 to 4.\n    *   **Rank 1:** $A_1$ (1 group)\n    *   **Rank 2:** $A_2$, $B_2$ (or $C_2$), $G_2$ (3 groups)\n    *   **Rank 3:** $A_3$ (or $D_3$), $B_3$ (or $C_3$) (2 groups)\n    *   **Rank 4:** $A_4$, $B_4$ (or $C_4$), $D_4$, $F_4$ (4 groups)\n\n2.  **Consider Partitions of 4:** We will go through each integer partition of 4 and count how many distinct Weyl groups correspond to it.\n    *   **Partition 4:** Corresponds to a single irreducible group of rank 4.\n    *   **Partition 3+1:** Corresponds to a direct product of a rank-3 and a rank-1 group.\n    *   **Partition 2+2:** Corresponds to a direct product of two rank-2 groups.\n    *   **Partition 2+1+1:** Corresponds to a product of one rank-2 and two rank-1 groups.\n    *   **Partition 1+1+1+1:** Corresponds to a product of four rank-1 groups.\n\n3.  **Calculate and Sum:** For each partition, we will calculate the number of possible combinations of irreducible groups. The sum of these counts will give the final answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the total number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n    This is done by considering the partitions of the integer 4, where each part\n    corresponds to the rank of an irreducible Weyl group.
