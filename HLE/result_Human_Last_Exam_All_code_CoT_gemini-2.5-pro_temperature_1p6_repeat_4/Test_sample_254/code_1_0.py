Conclusion:
A valid NMA requires that multiple assumptions hold simultaneously. Most importantly, both transitivity (the network structure makes sense) and homogeneity (the studies within a comparison are similar enough to be pooled) are required. Since multiple conditions must be met, no single assumption listed is sufficient on its own to ensure the overall validity of the analysis. Therefore, the correct answer is that no single option is sufficient.
