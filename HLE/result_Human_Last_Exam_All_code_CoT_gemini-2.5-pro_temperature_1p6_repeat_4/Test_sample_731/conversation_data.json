    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Group:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. A semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ has an order of $2^n$. For our group, the order is 512, which means $2^n = 512$. We can find $n$ by calculating the base-2 logarithm of 512.\n2.  **Understand Power Subgroups:** A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. Our goal is to find how many distinct subgroups can be formed this way.\n3.  **Analyze the Power Subgroups of $SD_{2^n}$:**\n    *   For any odd integer $k$, the mapping $g \\mapsto g^k$ is a bijection for any finite 2-group (a group where every element's order is a power of 2), so $G^k=G$. This gives us our first power subgroup: the group $G$ itself.\n    *   For even integers $k$, we only need to consider powers of 2. Any even $k$ can be written as $k=2^j \\cdot m$ with $m$ odd. Then $G^k = (G^{2^j})^m = G^{2^j}$. So, we only need to find the distinct subgroups of the form $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 1$.\n    *   The presentation of the semidihedral group is $SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   Through analysis of the powers of the elements in $SD_{2^n}$, it can be shown that the power subgroups $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\geq 1$ are all cyclic subgroups of the form $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:** The complete set of distinct power subgroups for $SD_{2^n}$ is:\n    *   $G$ (the group itself)\n    *   $\\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{2^{n-1}} \\rangle$\n    \n    The group $G=SD_{2^n}$ is non-abelian, while the other subgroups $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ are all cyclic and thus abelian. This means $G$ is distinct from all the others. The cyclic subgroups are also all distinct from each other as they have different orders (specifically, $|\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle| = 2^{n-1-j}$).\n    \n    So, we have 1 subgroup from $G$ itself, and $n-1$ distinct cyclic subgroups (from $j=1$ to $n-1$).\n    \n    The total number of power subgroups is $1 + (n-1) = n$.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** For $SD_{512}$, we found $n=9$. Therefore, the total number of power subgroups is 9.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_power_subgroups_semidihedral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # A semidihedral group SD_{2^n} has a size of 2^n. We first find n.\n    # n = log2(size)\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group is of size {group_size}, which can be written as 2^n.\")\n    print(f\"First, we find the value of n for the group SD_{{{group_size}}}:\")\n    print(f\"n = log2({group_size}) = {n}\")\n\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n}, the number of power subgroups is n.\n    # This count is composed of:\n    # 1. The group G itself.\n    # 2. n-1 distinct cyclic subgroups.\n    num_non_trivial_subgroups = 1\n    num_cyclic_subgroups = n - 1\n    total_subgroups = num_non_trivial_subgroups + num_cyclic_subgroups\n\n    print(\"\\nThe number of power subgroups for SD_{2^n} is exactly n.\")\n    print(\"This total is the sum of:\")\n    print(f\"  {num_non_trivial_subgroups} (for the group itself)\")\n    print(f\"  {num_cyclic_subgroups} (for the distinct cyclic power subgroups)\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{num_non_trivial_subgroups} + {num_cyclic_subgroups} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\ncount_power_subgroups_semidihedral()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
