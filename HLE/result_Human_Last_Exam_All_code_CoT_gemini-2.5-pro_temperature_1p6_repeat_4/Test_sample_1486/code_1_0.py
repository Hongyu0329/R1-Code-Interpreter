# In Maria Khoreva's Act I variation from the 2017 Paquita,
# she performs two main diagonal phrases containing cabrioles devants.

# Number of cabrioles in the first diagonal sequence
cabrioles_first_sequence = 2

# Number of cabrioles in the second diagonal sequence
cabrioles_second_sequence = 2

# Calculate the total number of cabrioles
total_cabrioles = cabrioles_first_sequence + cabrioles_second_sequence

# Print the final equation and the total count
print(f"The total number of cabrioles devants is calculated as follows:")
print(f"{cabrioles_first_sequence} + {cabrioles_second_sequence} = {total_cabrioles}")
