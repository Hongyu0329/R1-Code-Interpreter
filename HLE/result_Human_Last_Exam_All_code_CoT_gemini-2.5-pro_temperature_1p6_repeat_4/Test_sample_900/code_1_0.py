    Analyzes the query about Svetlana Gileva's performance in a Forsythe piece.

    This function addresses a question that cannot be solved by direct computation
    or data lookup via a simple script. It requires knowledge of dance history
    and choreographic style.

    - Choreographer: William Forsythe is known for deconstructing classical ballet.
    - Step: "Pas de Balanchine" is a specific step from George Balanchine's
      neo-classical technique.
    - Analysis: It is characteristic of Forsythe's style to avoid using
      classical steps in their formal, named form. He abstracts and re-imagines
      them. Therefore, the number of recognizable, formal "pas de Balanchines"
      is expected to be 0.
    
    A definitive answer would require frame-by-frame analysis of the performance
    video by a ballet expert, which is beyond the scope of this program.
