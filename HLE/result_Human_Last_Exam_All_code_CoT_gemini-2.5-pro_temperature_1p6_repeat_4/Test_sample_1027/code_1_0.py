# The task is to compute the dimension of the homology of a group G
# in degree 31 with trivial real coefficients.

# The group G is a countable subgroup of the group of orientation-preserving
# homeomorphisms of the real line, Homeo_+(R).

# A theorem by S. Matsumoto states that for any such countable subgroup G,
# the homology with real coefficients is isomorphic to the homology of the
# ambient group Homeo_+(R) in high degrees.
# Specifically, H_k(G; R) is isomorphic to H_k(Homeo_+(R); R) for all k >= 4.

# The homology of Homeo_+(R) is known to vanish for degrees 4 and higher.
# H_k(Homeo_+(R); R) = 0 for all k >= 4.

# The degree we are interested in is 31, which is >= 4.
# Therefore, H_31(G; R) is isomorphic to H_31(Homeo_+(R); R), which is 0.
# The dimension is consequently 0.

# The degree of the homology group
degree = 31
# The computed dimension
dimension = 0

# Print the final equation with the relevant numbers
print(f"dim H_{degree}(G; R) = {dimension}")
