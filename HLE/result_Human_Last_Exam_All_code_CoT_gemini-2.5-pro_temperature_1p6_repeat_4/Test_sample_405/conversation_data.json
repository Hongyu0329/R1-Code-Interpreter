    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this task:\n1.  First, I will identify the main, well-established pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will list the distinct color associated with each of these allotropes.\n3.  I will then count the number of unique colors found.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this information, calculates the total number of colors, and prints the result in the requested equation format. The script will count 1 for each distinct color and sum them up to get the total.\n\nThe main allotropes and their colors are:\n*   **White Phosphorus:** Has a characteristic waxy appearance and is white or yellowish.\n*   **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous or polymeric form that is red.\n*   **Violet Phosphorus:** A crystalline form that is violet, also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus.\n*   **Black Phosphorus:** The most stable form, which is black and flaky, similar to graphite.\n\nThis gives us four distinct colors: white, red, violet, and black.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the colors of pure phosphorus allotropes,\n    counts the number of distinct colors, and prints the result as an equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping major phosphorus allotropes to their colors.\n    allotropes = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": \"white\",\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": \"red\",\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": \"violet\",\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": \"black\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"The primary allotropes of phosphorus and their colors are:\")\n    for allotrope, color in allotropes.items():\n        print(f\"- {allotrope}: {color}\")\n\n    # Extract the unique colors from the dictionary values.\n    # Using a set automatically handles uniqueness.\n    unique_colors = set(allotropes.values())\n    \n    # Get the count of unique colors.\n    num_colors = len(unique_colors)\n\n    # Create the parts of the equation. Each unique color contributes '1' to the sum.\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * num_colors\n    \n    # Join the parts with ' + ' to form the equation string.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we sum the count for each distinct color.\")\n    # The final print statement shows the equation with each number, as requested.\n    print(f\"The calculation is: {equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, there are {num_colors} distinct colors that can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous.\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
