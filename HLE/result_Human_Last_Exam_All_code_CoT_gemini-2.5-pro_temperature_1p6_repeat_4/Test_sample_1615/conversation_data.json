    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, we need to understand the properties of the graph $G$ from the question. The graph has $n = 12345$ vertices and it is not a complete graph ($K_{12345}$).\n2.  The question asks for the \"maximum number of colours that we need to colour the vertices of G properly\". This refers to the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for any graph $G$ that satisfies these conditions.\n3.  The chromatic number of any graph with $n$ vertices is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$. The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph is a complete graph, $G = K_n$. This is because if $\\chi(G)=n$, every vertex must receive a unique color, which implies that every pair of vertices must be connected by an edge.\n4.  The problem states that $G$ is *not* a complete graph. Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices. This gives us the upper bound $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n5.  To determine if $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to check if a graph $G$ exists that is not complete and has $\\chi(G) = n-1$.\n6.  We can construct such a graph. Consider a graph formed by a clique of $n-1$ vertices ($K_{n-1}$) and one additional vertex that is not connected to any other vertex (an isolated vertex). This graph has $n$ vertices. It is not complete because the isolated vertex is not connected to the clique.\n7.  The chromatic number of this graph is determined by its largest clique, the $K_{n-1}$ component, which requires $n-1$ colors. The isolated vertex can be colored with one of these colors. Thus, the chromatic number of this graph is exactly $n-1$.\n8.  This confirms that the maximum chromatic number for a non-complete graph on $n$ vertices is $n-1$.\n9.  For this problem, $n = 12345$. The maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n```python\n# The number of vertices in the graph G\nnum_vertices = 12345\n\n# For any graph G with n vertices, the chromatic number chi(G) is at most n.\n# The chromatic number is n if and only if the graph is a complete graph (K_n).\n# Since the graph G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n# So, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n# We can construct a graph with n-1 vertices forming a clique (K_{n-1}) and one isolated vertex.\n# This graph has n vertices, is not complete, and has a chromatic number of n - 1.\nmax_colors = num_vertices - 1\n\n# Print the final calculation as an equation.\nprint(f\"{num_vertices} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
