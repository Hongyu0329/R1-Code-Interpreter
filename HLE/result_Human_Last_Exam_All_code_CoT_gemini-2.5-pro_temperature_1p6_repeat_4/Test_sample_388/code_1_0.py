        f"First, it is important to investigate the cause of the headache. New or worsening headaches in a patient taking a combined oral contraceptive like Junel Fe {junel_fe_dose}mg can be a sign of a serious side effect. Allison should be advised to monitor her headaches and contact her doctor if they are severe or persistent to rule out any serious cardiovascular risks.\n\n"
        f"Second, there is a significant drug interaction. The Excedrin Allison took contains aspirin. Taking aspirin with her antidepressant, Fluoxetine {fluoxetine_dose}mg, increases the risk of stomach bleeding. The pharmacist should warn her about this and suggest she discuss safer alternatives for headache relief with her doctor.\n\n"
        f"Her other medication, Atorvastatin {atorvastatin_dose}mg, is less likely to be related to the acute headache."
