    print("No, structurally, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not polysaccharides.")
    print("Although both are polymers and both contain sugar components, their fundamental structures are very different.\n")
    print("Here are the key structural differences:\n")

    # 1. Monomers (The basic building blocks)
    print("1. Monomers:")
    print("   - Polysaccharide: The monomer is a monosaccharide (a simple sugar, like glucose). It is a single molecule.")
    print("   - Polynucleotide: The monomer is a nucleotide. A nucleotide is a more complex molecule made of three distinct parts: a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n")

    # 2. Backbone Structure
    print("2. Backbone Structure:")
    print("   - Polysaccharide: The backbone is composed of sugar units linked directly to each other (sugar-sugar-sugar...).")
    print("   - Polynucleotide: The backbone is a repeating sugar-phosphate chain (sugar-phosphate-sugar-phosphate...). The nitrogenous bases are attached to the sugars but are not part of the backbone itself.\n")

    # 3. Chemical Bonds
    print("3. Linking Bonds:")
    print("   - Polysaccharide: Monomers are joined by glycosidic bonds.")
    print("   - Polynucleotide: Monomers are joined by phosphodiester bonds.\n")

    # 4. Elemental Composition
    print("4. Elemental Composition:")
    print("   - Polysaccharide: Typically composed of only Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Oxygen (O).")
    print("   - Polynucleotide: Always contain Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N) (in the bases), and Phosphorus (P) (in the phosphate groups).\n")

    print("Conclusion: Due to these major differences in monomers, backbone structure, bonding, and elemental composition, polynucleotides and polysaccharides are classified as distinct categories of biological macromolecules.")
