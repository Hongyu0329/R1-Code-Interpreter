    "To solve this, we need to calculate the result of applying a t-norm operation to the given values. In fuzzy logic, the activation or firing strength of a rule's consequent is determined by combining the activation level of the antecedent with the membership function of the consequent. This combination is typically done using a t-norm, which is a generalization of the logical AND operator.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the inputs:** We are given the antecedent activation level `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and the consequent membership degree `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  **Choose the operation:** The problem specifies using a t-norm. The most widely used t-norm is the **minimum operator** (`min(a, b)`). We will use this for the calculation.\n3.  **Perform the calculation:** We will find the minimum of the two input values.\n4.  **Present the result:** The Python code will define the variables, perform the calculation, and print the full equation with the result.\n\nThe calculation will be: `Result = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given values for the fuzzy rule\n# Antecedent activation level\nantecedent_activation = 0.7\n\n# Consequent membership degree\nconsequent_membership = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is used to combine these values. The most common t-norm in fuzzy\n# logic is the minimum operator. We will use it to calculate the rule\n# activation level.\n# Rule Activation Level = T(antecedent_activation, consequent_membership)\n# Using minimum t-norm: min(antecedent_activation, consequent_membership)\nrule_activation_level = np.minimum(antecedent_activation, consequent_membership)\n\n# Print the final equation with the values plugged in\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm (minimum operator) to the antecedent activation and the consequent membership.\")\nprint(f\"Result = min({antecedent_activation}, {consequent_membership})\")\nprint(f\"The final calculated rule activation level is: {rule_activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
