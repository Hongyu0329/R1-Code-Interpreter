    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, I will determine the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n\nSecond, I will find the health scaling formula for multiplayer in Expert Mode. This involves a percentage increase for each player in the game.\n\nThird, while the user asks for an \"infinite\" number of players, the game's source code has a hard-coded limit on the maximum number of players it can support (256). For a theoretical maximum *within the game's engine*, this is the number we must use. I will use this maximum player count in the calculation.\n\nFinally, I will combine these values in a Python script to calculate the theoretical maximum health, ensuring the output clearly shows the formula and its components as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_boss_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n\n    According to the Terraria source code, boss health scales with the number of players.\n    While the question asks for infinite players, the game's architecture imposes a hard\n    limit of 256 players in the Main.player array. This script calculates the health\n    based on this technical limitation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Base health for Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode\n    base_health = 3640\n\n    # The game's engine has a maximum player limit of 256.\n    num_players = 256\n\n    # In Expert Mode, boss health increases by 35% for each player after the first.\n    health_increase_per_player = 0.35\n\n    # The formula is: BaseHealth * (1 + (NumberOfPlayers - 1) * HealthIncrease)\n    multiplier = 1 + (num_players - 1) * health_increase_per_player\n\n    # Final health is always an integer in the game.\n    final_health = int(base_health * multiplier)\n\n    print(\"Terraria Boss Health Calculation (Expert Mode)\")\n    print(\"Boss: Eye of Cthulhu\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(f\"Base Health: {base_health}\")\n    print(f\"Player Count (Theoretical Max): {num_players}\")\n    print(f\"Health Increase Per Additional Player: {health_increase_per_player:.2f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Final Equation:\")\n    print(f\"{base_health} * (1 + ({num_players} - 1) * {health_increase_per_player}) = {final_health}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_terraria_boss_health()\n```\n<<<328490>>>"
