    "To determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate tori to the Weyl group:** For a split reductive group $G$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equivalent to the number of conjugacy classes in its corresponding Weyl group, $W$. This is a fundamental result in the theory of reductive algebraic groups over finite fields.\n2.  **Identify the Weyl group:** For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is the Weyl group of the root system of type $E_8$, denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n3.  **Find the number of conjugacy classes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the finite group $W(E_8)$. This is a known result from the study of finite Coxeter groups.\n4.  **State the result:** I will look up this value from established mathematical literature. The number of conjugacy classes for $W(E_8)$ has been calculated to be 112.\n5.  **Generate Python code:** I will write a Python script that explains this reasoning through comments and prints the final result, satisfying the user's request for a coding solution. The script will explicitly state the \"equation\" that connects the number of tori to the number of conjugacy classes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E8.\n    \n    The problem is solved based on a key theorem in the theory of reductive groups.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Theoretical connection\n    # The number of Fq-rational maximal tori of a split reductive group G over a finite field Fq\n    # is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group W.\n    # For a group G of type E8, the Weyl group is W(E8).\n    \n    # Let N be the number of Fq-rational maximal tori.\n    # The \"equation\" is: N = Number of conjugacy classes of W(E8)\n    \n    # Step 2: Look up the known mathematical value\n    # The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group W(E8) is a well-established result\n    # in mathematics, found in sources like R.W.
