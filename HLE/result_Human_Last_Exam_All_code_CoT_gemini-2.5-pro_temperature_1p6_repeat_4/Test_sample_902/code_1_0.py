The question asks if a program P can exist that computes the result of def_superfast(10000).
The answer is no. This is a well-known type of problem in computability theory.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. What does `def_superfast(10000)` do?
   The function's definition for n=10000 is:
   - "Consider all (python) programs with source code less than 10000 symbols that return an integer."
   - Let `Huge_int` be the largest of these integers.
   - The function should return `Huge_int + 1`.

2. How would a program P compute this?
   To find `Huge_int`, a program `P` would need to be able to:
   a) Generate or list every possible program shorter than 10000 symbols.
   b) For each of those programs, figure out if it ever stops running (halts) or gets stuck in an infinite loop.
   c) If a program does halt, check if it returns an integer.
   d) Keep track of the largest integer found among all halting programs.

3. The Impossible Step: The Halting Problem
   Step 2(b) is impossible. This is the famous "Halting Problem," first proven by Alan Turing. It's impossible to create a single program that can look at any other arbitrary program and decide correctly in all cases whether that second program will halt or run forever.

4. Conclusion
   Since any program `P` designed to compute `def_superfast(10000)` must be able to solve the Halting Problem for programs up to 10000 symbols, and the Halting Problem is unsolvable, no such program `P` can exist. The value `Huge_int` is a mathematically well-defined number, but it is not a *computable* number. Therefore, `def_superfast(10000)` is also uncomputable.
