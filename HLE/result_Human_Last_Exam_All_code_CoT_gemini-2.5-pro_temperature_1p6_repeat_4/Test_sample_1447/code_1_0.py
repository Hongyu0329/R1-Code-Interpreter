# The central problem is translating a plot-critical pun or homophone,
# which is specific to the source language (English). The goal is to find
# a translation practice that preserves the mystery for a new audience.

# Option I (Transcreation) solves this by creating a new, analogous pun
# in the target language. This preserves the puzzle's mechanics.
option_1 = "I"

# Option IV (Making a character a foreigner) solves this by providing
# an in-story reason to keep the original English pun, allowing the
# translated narrative to incorporate it directly.
option_4 = "IV"

# Other options either fail to solve the linguistic problem (III, V) or
# explain/spoil the puzzle via external annotation rather than integrating it
# into the narrative (II, VI).

# The final answer combines the valid options in ascending order,
# separated by a hyphen.
# As per the instruction to output each number in the "equation",
# I will print the individual components first.
print("The selected Roman numerals are:")
print(option_1)
print(option_4)

# Now, print the final answer in the required format.
final_answer = f"{option_1}-{option_4}"
