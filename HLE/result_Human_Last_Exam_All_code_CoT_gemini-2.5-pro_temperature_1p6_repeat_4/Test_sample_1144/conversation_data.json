    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Given Information and Constants:**\n    *   The uncertainty in the electron's position is given as $\\Delta x = 10 \\text{ pm} = 10 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ m}$.\n    *   We will use the following fundamental physical constants:\n        *   Reduced Planck's constant, $\\hbar \\approx 1.054 \\times 10^{-34} \\text{ J}\\cdot\\text{s}$.\n        *   Bohr radius (the radius of the first orbit of a hydrogen atom), $a_0 \\approx 5.29 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Uncertainty in Momentum ($\\Delta p$):**\n    *   According to Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum has a lower bound: $\\Delta x \\cdot \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$.\n    *   We can calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum using this relationship: $\\Delta p = \\frac{\\hbar}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Momentum of the Electron ($p_1$):**\n    *   In the Bohr model, the momentum of an electron in the first orbit (n=1) is given by the formula $p_1 = \\frac{\\hbar}{a_0}$.\n\n4.  **Determine the Ratio:**\n    *   The final step is to compute the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum itself: $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1}$.\n    *   By substituting the expressions from the previous steps, the ratio simplifies to:\n        Ratio = $\\frac{\\Delta p}{p_1} = \\frac{\\hbar / (2 \\Delta x)}{\\hbar / a_0} = \\frac{a_0}{2 \\Delta x}$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   The following Python code will define the constants and given values, calculate the intermediate values for momentum uncertainty ($\\Delta p$) and momentum ($p_1$), and then compute and print their final ratio.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define physical constants and given values\nhbar = 1.054e-34  # Reduced Planck's constant in J*s\nbohr_radius = 5.29e-11  # Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit) in meters\ndelta_x = 10e-12  # Uncertainty in position in meters (10 pm)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the uncertainty in momentum (delta_p)\n# Using Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: delta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\ndelta_p = hbar / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the momentum of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (p1)\n# Using the Bohr model: p1 = hbar / bohr_radius\np1 = hbar / bohr_radius\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum to the momentum\nratio = delta_p / p1\n\n# Print the values used in the final ratio calculation and the result\nprint(f\"The uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is: {delta_p:.4g} kg*m/s\")\nprint(f\"The momentum in the first Bohr orbit (p1) is: {p1:.4g} kg*m/s\")\nprint(f\"The final ratio (Δp / p1) is calculated as: {delta_p:.4g} / {p1:.4g}\")\nprint(f\"Resulting Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645>>>"
