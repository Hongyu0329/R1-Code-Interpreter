    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. This is a variation of the classic N-Queens problem, but on a \"wrap-around\" board.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Model the Toroidal Board:** The key is to correctly define the attack rules on a 5x5 toroidal board. A queen at `(r, c)` attacks any square `(r', c')` if any of the following conditions are met:\n    *   **Row attack:** `r' = r`\n    *   **Column attack:** `c' = c`\n    *   **Diagonal attacks:** The diagonals also wrap around. This can be checked using modular arithmetic:\n        *   ` (r' - c') % 5 == (r - c) % 5 ` (for one set of diagonals)\n        *   ` (r' + c') % 5 == (r + c) % 5 ` (for the other set of diagonals)\n\n2.  **Use a Backtracking Algorithm:** The problem involves finding all valid combinations of queen placements. A backtracking search is an efficient way to explore the possibilities. The total number of squares is 25, and we need to choose 4. The search space is small enough for this approach.\n\n3.  **Implement the Search:**\n    *   I'll create a recursive function that tries to place one queen at a time.\n    *   To avoid counting permutations of the same set of 4 squares as different solutions (e.g., placing queens at A then B is the same as B then A), the search will be structured to only consider combinations. I will do this by processing the 25 board squares in a fixed order (0 to 24). If a queen is placed on square `i`, the search for the next queen will only start from square `i + 1`.\n    *   The recursive function, let's call it `solve(k, start_square, placements)`, will take the number of queens left to place (`k`), a starting square index to search from, and a list of the current queen placements.\n    *   The base case for the recursion is when `k` becomes 0, which means 4 queens have been successfully placed. At this point, we've found one valid arrangement and will increment a counter.\n    *   In the recursive step, the function iterates through the board's squares, checks if placing a queen is safe, and if so, proceeds with a recursive call to place the next queen.\n\nThe Python code below implements this backtracking strategy to find the total count.\n\n```python\n# Define the size of the board and the number of queens.\nBOARD_SIZE = 5\nNUM_QUEENS = 4\n\n# This variable will store the total count of valid solutions.\nsolution_count = 0\n\ndef is_safe(row, col, placements):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if it's safe to place a queen at (row, col) given the existing\n    placements on the toroidal board.\n\n    Args:\n        row: The row of the potential new queen.\n        col: The column of the potential new queen.\n        placements: A list of (r, c) tuples for already placed queens.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the placement is safe, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    for placed_row, placed_col in placements:\n        # Check for same row or same column attacks\n        if row == placed_row or col == placed_col:\n            return False\n            \n        # Check for toroidal diagonal attacks using modular arithmetic\n        if (row - col) % BOARD_SIZE == (placed_row - placed_col) % BOARD_SIZE:\n            return False\n        if (row + col) % BOARD_SIZE == (placed_row + placed_col) % BOARD_SIZE:\n            return False\n            \n    return True\n\ndef solve_queens_placements(queens_to_place, start_index, placements):\n    \"\"\"\n    A recursive function to find all valid placements for the queens.\n\n    Args:\n        queens_to_place: The number of queens still needing to be placed.\n        start_index: The board square index (0 to 24) to start searching from.\n                     This ensures each combination is found only once.\n        placements: A list of (r, c) coordinates of queens placed so far.\n    \"\"\"\n    global solution_count\n    \n    # Base case: If no more queens are left to place, we've found a valid solution.\n    if queens_to_place == 0:\n        solution_count += 1\n        return\n\n    # Iterate through all possible squares starting from start_index\n    for i in range(start_index, BOARD_SIZE * BOARD_SIZE):\n        row = i // BOARD_SIZE\n        col = i % BOARD_SIZE\n        \n        # If placing a queen at (row, col) is safe\n        if is_safe(row, col, placements):\n            # Recurse to place the next queen.\n            # We add the current placement and search from the next square (i + 1).\n            new_placements = placements + [(row, col)]\n            solve_queens_placements(queens_to_place - 1, i + 1, new_placements)\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Main function to initiate the search and print the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Start the backtracking search from the first square (index 0) with no queens placed.\n    solve_queens_placements(NUM_QUEENS, 0, [])\n    \n    print(f\"Number of ways to place {NUM_QUEENS} non-attacking queens on a {BOARD_SIZE}x{BOARD_SIZE} toroidal chessboard: {solution_count}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<200>>>"
