    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The core of the problem is to evaluate the definite integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1. This integral is in the form `∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx`.\n2.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The antiderivative of `f'(x)/f(x)` is `ln(|f(x)|)`. Therefore, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln(|F₃(x)|)`.\n3.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln(F₃(x))]` evaluated from 0 to 1, which equals `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n4.  **Calculate F₃(x) at x=1 and x=0**:\n    *   First, we'll find the expression for `F₃(x)`:\n        *   `F₀(x) = x`\n        *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n        *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n        *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n    *   Next, we'll calculate `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`:\n        *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n        *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e⁰) = ln(2)`\n    *   Note: For `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `F₃(x)` is always positive, so the absolute value `|F₃(x)|` is not needed.\n5.  **Calculate the Value V**: We will substitute the values from the previous step into the expression `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The final step is to compute `10000 * V` and round it to the nearest integer.\n7.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script using the `math` library to perform these calculations and print the required values.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the function F3(x) for clarity, though we only need its values at 0 and 1.\n# F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\ndef f3(x):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the value of F3(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\"\"\"\n  return math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(x)))\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F3(1) and F3(0). These are the numbers in our final equation for V.\nf3_at_1 = f3(1)\nf3_at_0 = f3(0)\n\n# Step 3: Evaluate the definite integral V = ln(F3(1)) - ln(F3(0)).\n# The integral is ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx, which evaluates to [ln(F₃(x))].\n# From 0 to 1, this is ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\nv = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the final value requested by the user.\nresult_multiplied = 10000 * v\nfinal_answer = round(result_multiplied)\n\n# Step 5: Print the breakdown of the calculation as requested.\nprint(\"The definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1 evaluates to V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\nprint(\"\\nFirst, we calculate the numbers for the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(2) = {f3_at_0}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nNow, we plug these numbers into the expression for V:\")\nprint(f\"V = ln({f3_at_1}) - ln({f3_at_0})\")\nprint(f\"V = {v}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nFinally, we scale V by 10000 and find the closest integer:\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V = {result_multiplied}\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer is: {final_answer}\")\n<<<5490>>>\n```"
