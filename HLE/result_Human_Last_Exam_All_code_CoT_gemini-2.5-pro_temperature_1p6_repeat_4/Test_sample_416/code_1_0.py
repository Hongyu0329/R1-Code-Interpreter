    print("B. Charcot Arthropathy fits the clinical picture best. It classically presents as an acutely red, hot, swollen joint after minor trauma. Early X-rays are often normal, and synovial fluid is typically non-inflammatory. Crucially, the condition does not respond to anti-inflammatory drugs like NSAIDs or steroids.")
