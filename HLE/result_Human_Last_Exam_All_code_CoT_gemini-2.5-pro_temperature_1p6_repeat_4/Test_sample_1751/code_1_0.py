    # Step 2: Relate structure to packing ability.
    # Saturated chains are straight and flexible, allowing them to pack together very tightly.
    # The trans double bond in the ceramide creates a rigid 'kink' that disrupts this tight packing.
    print("Step 2: Effect on Molecular Packing")
    print("- The straight, saturated chains of C16-dihydroceramide allow for very tight, efficient, and ordered packing.")

    # Step 3: Connect packing to surface area.
    # Tighter packing means each molecule occupies less space.
    # Therefore, the lipid with better packing will have a lower area per molecule when compressed.
