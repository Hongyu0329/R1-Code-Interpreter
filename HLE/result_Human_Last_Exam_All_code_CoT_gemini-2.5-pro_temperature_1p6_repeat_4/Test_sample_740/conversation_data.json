    "To find the values of `λ` for which the given integral equation has no solution, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Re-framing the Integral Equation**: The integral equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind. The kernel of the integral, `K(x, y) = (xⁿ - yⁿ) / (x - y)`, is a degenerate (or separable) kernel. We can rewrite it as a sum:\n    `K(x, y) = xⁿ⁻¹ + xⁿ⁻²y + ... + xyⁿ⁻² + yⁿ⁻¹ = Σ_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k`.\n    This implies that the solution `u(x)` must be a polynomial of degree at most `n-1`. Let `u(x) = a₀ + a₁x + ... + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}`.\n\n2.  **Deriving a System of Linear Equations**: By substituting the polynomial form of `u(x)` back into the integral equation and comparing the coefficients of the powers of `x`, we can transform the integral equation into a system of `n` linear equations for the `n` unknown coefficients `a₀, a₁, ..., a_{n-1}`. This system can be written in the matrix form `(I - λH)A = B`, where `A` is the vector of coefficients `[a₀, ..., a_{n-1}]ᵀ`, `B = [1, 0, ..., 0]ᵀ`, `I` is the identity matrix, and `H` is an `n x n` matrix with entries `H_{ij} = 1/(n+j-i)` (for `i, j` from `0` to `n-1`).\n\n3.  **Condition for No Solution**: A unique solution for the coefficients `A` exists if the matrix `(I - λH)` is invertible, i.e., `det(I - λH) ≠ 0`. If `det(I - λH) = 0`, the system has either no solution or infinitely many solutions. According to the Fredholm alternative, when `det(I - λH) = 0`, a solution exists only if the vector `B` is orthogonal to the null space of the transpose matrix `(I - λH)ᵀ`. For the given `B`, this orthogonality condition is generally not met. Therefore, the values of `λ` for which the equation has no solution are the roots of the characteristic equation `det(I - λH) = 0`.\n\n4.  **Solving for λ**: The equation `det(I - λH) = 0` is a polynomial equation of degree `n` in `λ`. We can use a symbolic math library like `sympy` in Python to construct this polynomial for a given `n` and find its roots. These roots are the values of `λ` for which no solution exists.\n\nThe problem does not specify the integer `n`. The following Python code is generalized for any integer `n` and demonstrates the solution for `n=3`. It first finds the polynomial equation for `λ` and then solves it.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the values of lambda for which the given integral equation has no solution\n    for a specified integer n.\n\n    The method involves:\n    1.
