    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Graph Structure:** A barbell graph with 10 nodes is typically constructed by taking two complete graphs of 5 nodes each (K5) and connecting them with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Determine Node Degrees:** I will find the degrees of the two nodes that are connected by the bottleneck edge. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. For a node `u` in one of the K5 clusters connected to the bottleneck edge, its degree is the sum of its connections to the other 4 nodes within its cluster and the single connection across the bottleneck.\n3.  **Use the Gossiping Probability Formula:** In a randomized uniform gossiping step, a node `i` is selected uniformly at random (with probability `1/N`, where `N` is the total number of nodes), and then one of its neighbors `j` is selected uniformly at random (with probability `1/degree(i)`). The probability of sampling a specific edge `(u, v)` is the sum of the probabilities of picking `u` then `v`, and picking `v` then `u`. The formula is:\n    `P(edge(u,v)) = (1/N) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/N) * (1/degree(v))`\n4.  **Calculate and Print:** I will write a Python script to substitute the values for the 10-node barbell graph into this formula to find the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge. The script will print a step-by-step explanation of how the values are derived and show the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph\n    during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.

Apply the probability formula for uniform gossiping.\n    # The probability of sampling an edge (u, v) is:\n    # P = P(pick u, then v) + P(pick v, then u)\n    # P = [P(pick u) * P(pick v | u)] + [P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)]\n    # P = (1/N) * (1/degree(u)) + (1/N) * (1/degree(v))\n    probability = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node + 1 / degree_bottleneck_node)\n\n    # 4.
