    Symbolically represents the relationship between Gödel's ontological proof
    and the framework of quantum mechanics.

    The two domains are conceptually distinct:
    1. Gödel's Proof: A formal argument in modal logic and metaphysics.
    2. Quantum Mechanics: A physical theory describing the universe.

    In quantum mechanics, unrelated or independent states are "orthogonal".
    The inner product of two orthogonal states is 0. This is represented
    using bra-ket notation: <State A | State B> = 0.

    This script uses this notation to symbolically show that there is no
    projection of Gödel's logical proof onto the mathematical framework of
    quantum physics.
