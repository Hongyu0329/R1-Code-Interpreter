    # --- Analysis ---
    # The optimal strategy for both regimes turns out to be a simple hash-then-sort approach.
    # 1. Hashing: Use operation H on all N full-length strings to group identical ones.
    #    This costs N queries.
    # 2. Sorting: Sort the N_unique representatives using operation C.
    #    This costs Theta(N_unique * log(N_unique)) queries.
    # Total cost Q = N + N_unique * log(N_unique).

    # In both specified regimes, L is large enough such that 2^L > N.
    # This means it's possible that all N strings are unique (N_unique = N).
    # Therefore, the worst-case query complexity is Q = Theta(N * log N).

    # We need to express Q in the format sqrt(N^a * (log N)^b * (log log N)^c).
    # Q = N * log(N)
    # Q^2 = (N * log(N))^2 = N^2 * (log N)^2 * (log log N)^0
    
    # By comparing the powers, we find the parameters a, b, and c.
    # N^a = N^2           => a = 2
    # (log N)^b = (log N)^2 => b = 2
    # (log log N)^c = 1   => c = 0

    a = 2
    b = 2
    c = 0
