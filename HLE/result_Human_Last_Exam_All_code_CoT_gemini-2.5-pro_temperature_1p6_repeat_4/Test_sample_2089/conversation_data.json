    "This is a film trivia question. The scene described occurs in the 1993 Oscar-nominated thriller, *The Fugitive*. The character is the one-armed man, Fredrick Sykes. He is attempting to escape on Chicago's 'L' train (a form of public transit, often recalled as a bus). A transit cop lets him through the turnstile, and Sykes says \"Thank you\" before shooting him. This act is witnessed by Dr. Richard Kimble, confirming Sykes' guilt and sealing his fate.\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to print the name of the film.\n\n```python\n# The following script prints the name of the film in question.\nfilm_title = \"The Fugitive\"\ncharacter = \"Fredrick Sykes (the one-armed man)\"\nfateful_line = \"Thank you\"\n\nprint(f\"The Oscar-nominated film is '{film_title}'.\")\nprint(f\"The character, {character}, seals his fate after saying, \\\"{fateful_line}\\\".\")\n```\n<<<The Fugitive>>>"
