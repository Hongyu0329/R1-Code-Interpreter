# A vertex-transitive graph on n vertices must be regular (all vertices have the same degree j).
# The complement of a j-regular vertex-transitive graph on n vertices is a
# (n-1-j)-regular vertex-transitive graph. For n=8, this means n_j = n_{7-j}.
# We will determine the counts n_j for j = 0, 1, 2, 3 and then use the complement property.

# Initialize a list to store the counts for degrees 0 through 7.

# The graph is the empty graph with 8 vertices (8K_1). It is unique and vertex-transitive.

# For degree j=1:
# The graph is a perfect matching on 8 vertices (4K_2). It is unique and vertex-transitive.

# For degree j=2:
# A 2-regular graph on 8 vertices is a disjoint union of cycles.
# For vertex-transitivity, all components must be isomorphic.
# The options are a single C_8 or two C_4's. Other partitions like C_5+C_3 are not VT.
# So, there are 2 such graphs.

# The number of cubic (3-regular) vertex-transitive graphs on 8 vertices
# is a known result from graph theory databases and literature. There are 5 such graphs.

# For instance, the first number is n_0, the second is n_1, and so on.
