    Calculates the first-order relativistic kinetic energy correction
    for a hydrogen atom in a given state (n, l).

    The problem asks for the second-order correction, which is an extremely
    complex calculation typically reserved for advanced QED. It is very likely
    that the intended problem was to calculate the first-order correction,
    which is a standard textbook calculation for the fine structure.
    This code calculates the first-order correction.

    The formula for the first-order shift is:
    E_shift = - (m * c^2 * alpha^4 / 2) * [ 1/(n^3 * (l + 1/2)) - 3/(4 * n^4) ]
