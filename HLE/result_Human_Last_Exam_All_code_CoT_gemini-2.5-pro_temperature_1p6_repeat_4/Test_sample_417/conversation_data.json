    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent sets of protons in the molecule.\n\n### My thinking process:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule's name indicates a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring with three identical, large substituents attached at positions 1, 3, and 5. This arrangement gives the molecule a C3 axis of symmetry. Due to this symmetry, the three methyl groups on the benzene ring are chemically equivalent, and the three large substituent \"arms\" are also chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique signals from the central core and one of the arms.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core and Linkers:**\n    *   **2,4,6-Methyl Groups:** The three methyl groups (`-CH3`) are related by the C3 axis, so they are equivalent. They will produce **1 peak**.\n    *   **1,3,5-Methylene Linkers:** The three methylene groups (`-CH2-`) are also equivalent by C3 symmetry. However, each `-CH2-` group is attached to a chiral substituent (the arm). This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent. Thus, these linkers will produce **2 peaks**.\n\n3.  **Count Signals from a Single Substituent Arm:**\n    The arm is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a rigid and chiral structure with no internal symmetry. We must count each set of non-equivalent protons within it.\n    *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton (C3-H):** There is one proton on the pyrazole ring. This will be **1 peak**.\n    *   **Bridgehead Proton (C4-H):** The bicyclic system has a proton at the C4 bridgehead. This gives **1 peak**.\n    *   **Bicyclic Methylene Protons (C5-H2 and C6-H2):** The two methylene groups in the bicyclic system are part of a rigid, asymmetric environment. The two protons on C5 are diastereotopic (2 peaks), and the two protons on C6 are also diastereotopic (2 peaks). C5 and C6 are not equivalent. This results in a total of **4 peaks** from these two groups.\n    *   **Methyl Group Protons (7,8,8-trimethyl):**\n        *   The methyl group at position C7 gives **1 peak**.\n        *   The two methyl groups at position C8 are `geminal` (on the same carbon). Since they are part of a chiral molecule, they are diastereotopic and thus non-equivalent. This gives **2 peaks**.\n    *   **Total for one arm:** Summing the peaks from the arm: 1 (pyrazole CH) + 1 (bridgehead CH) + 4 (bicyclic CH2s) + 1 (C7-Me) + 2 (C8-Me2) = **9 peaks**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Peaks:**\n    Total peaks = (peaks from core methyls) + (peaks from linker methylenes) + (peaks from one arm).\n    Total peaks = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the step-by-step breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef count_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its structure and symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Part 1: Protons on the central core and linkers\n    # The three methyl groups at positions 2,4,6 are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\n    core_methyl_peaks = 1\n    \n    # The three methylene linkers at 1,3,5 are equivalent by C3 symmetry.\n    # However, the two protons on each CH2 group are diastereotopic because they are attached to a chiral group.\n    linker_methylene_peaks = 2\n\n    # Part 2: Protons on one substituent arm\n    # The arm is chiral and rigid, so we count non-equivalent protons.\n    # (4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl\n    \n    # C3-H on pyrazole ring\n    pyrazole_ch_peaks = 1\n    \n    # C4-H at a bridgehead\n    bridgehead_ch_peaks = 1\n    \n    # C5-H2 and C6-H2 are two diastereotopic CH2 groups.
