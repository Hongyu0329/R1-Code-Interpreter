    # --- Introduction ---

    # --- Step 1: The Core Hardness of the Problem ---
    print("Step 1: The problem of learning a two-hidden-layer network contains a known hard sub-problem.")
    print("The primary difficulty stems from a well-studied result that establishes a strong lower bound for the simpler problem of learning a single ReLU neuron, f(x) = max(0, w.x).")
    print("This is because a hard-to-learn single neuron can be embedded in a larger two-layer network, making the entire network hard to learn.")
    print("This foundational result is detailed in the paper 'Statistical Barriers to Learning Neural Nets' by Feldman, Shamir, and Shalev-Shwartz (2017).")

    print("Step 2: State the general SQ lower bound for learning a single ReLU.")

    # --- Step 3: Substitute the Problem's Parameters ---
    print("Step 3: Substitute the parameters from your specific problem into this formula.")
    print("\nParameter 1: The target squared loss 'ε' is 1/poly(d).")
    print("This means ε can be written as d^(-c1) for some constant c1 > 0.")
    print("Therefore, the term 1/ε becomes poly(d), or d^c1.")
    print("\nParameter 2: The query tolerance 'τ' is not negligible in d.")
    print("This means τ is also of the form 1/poly(d), which can be written as d^(-c2) for some constant c2 > 0.")

    print("The term d^Ω(d^c1) is already superpolynomial. In complexity notation, an expression of the form d^(poly(d)) is equivalent to exp(poly(d) * log(d)).")
    print("The d^(-2*c2) term in the denominator becomes d^(2*c2) in the numerator, which is a polynomial term and does not change the dominant superpolynomial nature of the bound.")
