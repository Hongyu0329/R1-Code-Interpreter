def solve_pascal_pyramid():
    """
    This function calculates the number of unique values in a 3D Square Pascal Pyramid
    with 100 layers, based on the generation rule derived from the user's examples.

    The generation rule is as follows:
    1. The pyramid starts with Layer 1, which is a 1x1 matrix containing `[[1]]`.
    2. Each subsequent Layer `n` (for n > 1) is an `n x n` matrix.
    3. The values on the border of any layer are always 1.
    4. The values in the interior of Layer `n` are calculated from Layer `n-1`.
       The value at `Layer_n[i][j]` is the sum of the four cells in a 2x2 block
       from the previous layer: `Layer_{n-1}[i-1][j-1]`, `Layer_{n-1}[i-1][j]`,
       `Layer_{n-1}[i][j-1]`, and `Layer_{n-1}[i][j]`.

    The function iteratively builds each layer from 1 to 100, collecting all
    generated numbers into a set to count the unique values.
