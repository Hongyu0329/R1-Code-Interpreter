    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **State the Theoretical Framework**: I will use the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology, which provides a way to compute the cohomology of a product of groups.\n2.  **Gather Known Results**: The formula requires the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group $T$, i.e., $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R})$ for various degrees $n$. These are known results from the mathematical literature.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $n \\geq 3$.\n3.  **Apply the Formula**: I will apply the Künneth formula for the group $G = T \\times T$ and degree $n=4$:\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T; \\mathbb{R})$\n4.  **Execute the Calculation**: I will expand the sum, substitute the known dimensions, and compute the final result.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: The entire process, including the formula, the known values, the step-by-step calculation, and the final answer, will be encapsulated in a single Python script for the user to execute.\n\nHere is the Python code that performs the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.\n    \"\"\"\n    degree = 4\n\n    print(\"This script computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group\")\n    print(\"of the group G = T x T, where T is Thompson's group T, with trivial real coefficients.\")\n    print(\"The quantity to compute is dim H_b^4(T x T; R).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"For two groups G1 and G2, the Künneth formula provides an isomorphism:\")\n    print(\"H_b^n(G1 x G2; R) ~= SUM_{p+q=n} (H_b^p(G1; R) (x) H_b^q(G2; R))\")\n    print(\"Taking dimensions, we get:\")\n    print(\"dim H_b^n(G1 x G2; R) = SUM_{p+q=n} dim H_b^p(G1; R) * dim H_b^q(G2; R)\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Bounded Cohomology of Thompson's Group T\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of T with real coefficients are known:\")\n    \n    # This function provides the known dimensions of H_b^n(T; R)\n    def get_dim_Hb_T(n):\n        if n == 0:\n            return 1\n        if n == 2:\n            return 1\n        # For n=1 and n>=3, the dimension is 0\n        return 0\n\n    print(f\"dim H_b^0(T; R) = {get_dim_Hb_T(0)}\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^1(T; R) = {get_dim_Hb_T(1)}\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^2(T; R) = {get_dim_Hb_T(2)}\")\n    print(\"dim H_b^n(T; R) = 0 for n >= 3\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Step 3: Applying the Künneth Formula for n = {degree}\")\n    print(\"-------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"We want to compute dim H_b^4(T x T; R).
