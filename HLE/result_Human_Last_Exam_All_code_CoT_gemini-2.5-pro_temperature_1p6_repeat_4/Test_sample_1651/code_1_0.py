# The task is to find the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points for the

# Mathematical analysis of the extension F of f(x) = x^2 + 1:
#
# 1. At the "positive infinity" point (p_+) in the remainder:
#    lim f(x) as x -> +inf is +inf. This implies that F(p_+) = p_+.
#    So, there is at least one fixed point.
#
# 2. At the "negative infinity" point (p_-) in the remainder:
#    lim f(x) as x -> -inf is +inf. This implies that F(p_-) = p_+.
#    Since p_ != p_+, p_- is not a fixed point.
#
# 3. For any other point 'p' in the remainder:
#    It can be shown that for a function like f(x) which satisfies f(x) > x for large x,
#    the only fixed point in the corresponding part of the remainder is p_+.
#    This line of reasoning suggests F has only one fixed point in the remainder.
#
# Conclusion:
# Since we have constructed a function whose extension has exactly one fixed point,
# and the question asks for the smallest non-zero number of such points,
# the minimum is 1.
