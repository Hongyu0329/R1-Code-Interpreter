    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will establish the correspondence between the colors of the spectrum as defined by Isaac Newton and the notes of the musical diatonic scale.\n2.  Next, I will determine the color that results from combining yellow and blue. In the context of light and color spectra, the color located between yellow and blue is green.\n3.  The question asks for the note corresponding to the range starting from this new color (green) up to blue.\n4.  Using the established mapping, I will find the musical note that corresponds to the color green.\n5.  Finally, I will write a Python script that codifies this logic, prints the explanation, and outputs the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef solve_newton_color_music_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the puzzle by mapping Newton's color circle to the musical scale.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping from Newton's colors to musical notes.\n    # We use an ordered dictionary to maintain the sequence of the scale.\n    color_to_note = collections.OrderedDict([\n        (\"Red\", \"C\"),\n        (\"Orange\", \"D\"),\n        (\"Yellow\", \"E\"),\n        (\"Green\", \"F\"),\n        (\"Blue\", \"G\"),\n        (\"Indigo\", \"A\"),\n        (\"Violet\", \"B\")\n    ])\n\n    # Step 2: Identify the colors from the user's question.\n    # The color produced by combining or being spectrally between yellow and blue is green.\n    start_color_in_range = \"Green\"\n    end_color_in_range = \"Blue\"\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Find the musical note corresponding to the start of the specified range.\n    # The range is defined as starting from Green.
