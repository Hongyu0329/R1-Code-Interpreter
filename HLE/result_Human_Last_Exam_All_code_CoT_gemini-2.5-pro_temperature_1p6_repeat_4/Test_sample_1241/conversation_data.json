    "To solve this problem, we need to find the steady-state probabilities of the system. The steady state is reached as time $t \\to +\\infty$. In this state, the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which means their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ become zero. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nBy setting all derivatives to zero in the given Kolmogorov-Chapman system of equations, we transform the system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations:\n\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n4.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$ (The normalization condition)\n\nNote that the second original equation is a linear combination of the others at steady state, so we can discard it and use the four equations listed above.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Solve the first three equations to express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n2.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation (4) to find the value of $p_1$.\n3.  Calculate the desired quantity, $p_0 + p_1$, using the relations found in step 1 and the value of $p_1$ from step 2.\n4.  Write a Python script to perform the numerical calculations and print the result along with the final equation showing the numbers used.\n\nHere is the derivation:\nFrom equation (1): $p_0 = \\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} p_1$\nFrom equation (2): $p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} p_1$\nFrom equation (3): $p_3 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} p_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_{23}}{\\lambda_{31}} \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{12}}{\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23}} \\right) p_1$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23} = 0.392 + 0.008 = 0.4$\n- $p_2 = \\frac{0.4}{0.4} p_1 = p_1$\n- $p_3 = \\frac{0.008}{0.008} p_2 = p_2 = p_1$\n\nSo, we have $p_2 = p_1$ and $p_3 = p_1$. Now, we use the normalization equation:\n$p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n$\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\right)p_1 + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} + 3\\right) = 1 \\implies p_1 = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} + 3}$\n\nFinally, we calculate $p_0 + p_1$:\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}}\\right)p_1 + p_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} + 1\\right) p_1$\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} + 1}{\\frac{\\lambda_{10}}{\\lambda_{01}} + 3}$\n\nThe following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\n# Define the given transition rates\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# At steady state, the derivatives are zero, leading to a system of linear equations.\n# As derived in the explanation, the solution for P0(+inf) + P1(+inf),\n# which we denote as p0 + p1, is given by the formula:\n# p0 + p1 = ((lambda_10 / lambda_01) + 1) / ((lambda_10 / lambda_01) + 3)\n\n# Perform the calculation\nratio_10_01 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\nnumerator = ratio_10_01 + 1\ndenominator = ratio_10_01 + 3\nresult = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with the numerical values\nprint(\"The final equation for P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) is:\")\nprint(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = (({lambda_10} / {lambda_01}) + 1) / (({lambda_10} / {lambda_01}) + 3)\")\nprint(\"\\nSubstituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = ({ratio_10_01:.5f} + 1) / ({ratio_10_01:.5f} + 3)\")\nprint(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {numerator:.5f} / {denominator:.5f}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThe final result is: {result:.7f}\")\n```\n<<<0.9462512>>>"
