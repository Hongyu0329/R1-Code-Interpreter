    "To solve this problem, we need to find the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$. The standard procedure for this is as follows:\n\n1.  **Compute the continued fraction of the rational number `p/q`**. For 4/7, the continued fraction is $[0; 1, 1, 3]$. We are interested in the sequence of coefficients after the integer part, which we can call the \"word\" $W$. Here, $W = (1, 1, 3)$.\n\n2.  **Construct a periodic continued fraction**. The continued fraction associated with $m_{p/q}$ is purely periodic. Its period is formed by concatenating the word $W$ with its reversal, $W^R$. For $W=(1, 1, 3)$, the reverse is $W^R = (3, 1, 1)$. The resulting period is $(1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Identify the quadratic irrational number**. This periodic continued fraction, $x = [\\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]$, corresponds to a specific quadratic irrational number. This number is a solution to a quadratic equation $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$.\n\n4.  **Find the quadratic equation**. We can find the coefficients A, B, and C of this equation by calculating the matrix corresponding to the periodic block of coefficients. This matrix is the product of individual matrices for each coefficient in the period. For a coefficient `c`, the matrix is `[[c, 1], [1, 0]]`. By finding the product for the entire period, we get a matrix `[[p_n, p_{n-1}], [q_n, q_{n-1}]]`. The quadratic equation for `x` is then given by $q_n x^2 + (q_{n-1} - p_n)x - p_{n-1} = 0$.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to find the quadratic equation whose root is the value of the continued fraction associated with $m_{4/7}$. The code will output the simplified coefficients A, B, and C of this equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_rational_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction coefficients for a rational number p/q.\n    Example: get_rational_cf(4, 7) -> [0, 1, 1, 3]\n    \"\"\"\n    coeffs = []\n    if q == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Denominator cannot be zero\")\n    while q != 0:\n        a = p // q\n        coeffs.append(a)\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return coeffs\n\ndef get_cf_matrix(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the convergents matrix for a sequence of CF coefficients.\n    For a list of coefficients [c0, c1, ..., cn], this computes the matrix product\n    M(c0) * M(c1) * ... * M(cn).
