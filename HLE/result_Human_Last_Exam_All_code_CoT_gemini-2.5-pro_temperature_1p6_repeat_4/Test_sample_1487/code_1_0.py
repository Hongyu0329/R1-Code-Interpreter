    This function calculates the final value of the expression based on the analytical derivation.
    
    The derivation shows that the expression simplifies to 1 + 10^15.
    Original Expression: (2 * ||alpha||^2) / ((pi^2/6) - 1) + 10^15
    Derived value for ||alpha||^2: (1/2) * ((pi^2/6) - 1)
    
    Substituting gives: (2 * (1/2) * ((pi^2/6) - 1)) / ((pi^2/6) - 1) + 10^15
    This simplifies to: 1 + 10^15
