    "To find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to count the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids the pattern 1324 if there are no indices \\(i < j < k < l\\) such that \\(\\pi_i < \\pi_k < \\pi_j < \\pi_l\\).\n\nWe can construct permutations by their inversion vectors or by their decomposition into indecomposable components. A permutation \\(\\pi\\) is decomposable if it can be written as \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus \\tau\\) for some non-empty permutations \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\), where \\((\\sigma \\oplus \\tau)(i) = \\sigma(i)\\) if \\(1 \\le i \\le |\\sigma|\\) and \\((\\sigma \\oplus \\tau)(i) = \\tau(i-|\\sigma|) + |\\sigma|\\) if \\(|\\sigma| < i \\le |\\sigma|+|\\tau|\\). Otherwise, \\(\\pi\\) is indecomposable.\n\nThe number of inversions is additive over this decomposition: \\(inv(\\sigma \\oplus \\tau) = inv(\\sigma) + inv(\\tau)\\).\n\nA key result states that \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus \\tau\\) avoids 1324 if and only if:\n1. Both \\(\\sigma\\) and \\(\\tau\\) are 1324-avoiding.\n2. Either \\(\\sigma\\) is 132-avoiding or \\(\\tau\\) is 213-avoiding.\n\nWe need to find all 1324-avoiding permutations of length 333 with 3 inversions. We can classify them by their decomposition structure. The total number of inversions must sum to 3.\n\nLet \\(I_k^{av}\\) be the set of indecomposable 1324-avoiding permutations with \\(k\\) inversions.\n- \\(I_0^{av} = \\emptyset\\) (the identity permutation \\((1)\\) is decomposable as \\(id_0 \\oplus id_1\\))\n- \\(I_1^{av} = \\{(2,1)\\}\\)\n- \\(I_2^{av} = \\{(2,3,1), (3,1,2)\\}\\)\n- For \\(k=3\\), we find three fundamental structures for indecomposable 1324-avoiding permutations:\n  - Structure 1: \\((4,1,2,3)\\) gives permutation type \\((4,1,2,3,5,...,n)\\).\n  - Structure 2: \\((3,2,1)\\) gives permutation type \\((3,2,1,4,5,...,n)\\).\n  - Structure 3: \\((2,3,4,1)\\) gives permutation type \\((2,3,4,1,5,...,n)\\).\n  These are the 3 indecomposable permutations with 3 inversions for any length \\(n \\ge 4\\).\n\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a 1324-avoiding permutation with 3 inversions.\nCase 1: \\(\\pi\\) is indecomposable.\nThere are 3 such permutations as listed above.\n\nCase 2: \\(\\pi\\) is a direct sum of two indecomposable components, \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus \\tau\\).\nThe sum of inversions is \\(inv(\\sigma)+inv(\\tau)=3\\).\n  - Subcase 2.1: \\((inv(\\sigma),inv(\\tau)) = (1,2)\\). We take \\(\\sigma \\in I_1^{av}\\) and \\(\\tau \\in I_2^{av}\\).\n    - \\(\\sigma=(2,1)\\). This avoids 132. So \\(\\tau\\) can be any member of \\(I_2^{av}\\).\n    - For \\(\\tau=(2,3,1)\\), we get \\(\\pi = (2,1)\\oplus(2,3,1) = (2,1,5,6,4,...)\\).\n    - For \\(\\tau=(3,1,2)\\), we get \\(\\pi = (2,1)\\oplus(3,1,2) = (2,1,6,4,5,...)\\).\n    This gives 2 distinct permutations.\n  - Subcase 2.2: \\((inv(\\sigma),inv(\\tau)) = (2,1)\\). We take \\(\\sigma \\in I_2^{av}\\) and \\(\\tau \\in I_1^{av}\\).\n    - \\(\\tau=(2,1)\\). This contains a 21 pattern, but does not contain a 213 pattern. \\(\\sigma\\) must avoid 132.\n    - \\(\\sigma=(3,1,2)\\) avoids 132. This gives \\(\\pi=(3,1,2)\\oplus(2,1)=(3,1,2,5,4,...)\\).\n    - \\(\\sigma=(2,3,1)\\) contains a 132 pattern, so this composition is excluded.\n    This gives 1 distinct permutation.\n\nCase 3: \\(\\pi\\) is a direct sum of three indecomposable components, \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus \\tau \\oplus \\rho\\).\nEach component must have 1 inversion, so \\(\\sigma=\\tau=\\rho=(2,1)\\).\nLet's check the condition. \\((2,1)\\oplus(2,1) = (2,1,4,3)\\). This avoids 213. And \\((2,1)\\) avoids 132. The full permutation \\((2,1)\\oplus(2,1)\\oplus(2,1) = (2,1,4,3,6,5,...)\\) is a 1324-avoider. This is 1 distinct permutation.\n\nCase 4: \\(\\pi\\) contains identity components. \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus id_j\\) or \\(\\pi = id_j \\oplus \\sigma\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is indecomposable. \\(j>0\\).\nLet's analyze \\(\\pi = id_j \\oplus \\sigma\\) for \\(n=333\\). \\(inv(\\pi) = inv(\\sigma) = 3\\). So \\(\\sigma\\) is from \\(I_3^{av}\\), and of length \\(333-j\\).\n\\(\\sigma\\) must be 213-avoiding because \\(id_j\\) does not avoid 132 (if \\(j\\ge 3\\)). Let's check our 3 basic types for the 213-pattern:\n  - \\((4,1,2,3)\\) contains 213 patterns (e.g. 4,1,2). Excluded.\n  - \\((3,2,1)\\) is 213-avoiding. Allowed. For any \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(333-3=330\\), \\(\\pi=id_j \\oplus (3,2,1)\\) is a valid permutation. This gives 330 permutations.\n  - \\((2,3,4,1)\\) is 213-avoiding. Allowed. For any \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(333-4=329\\), \\(\\pi=id_j \\oplus (2,3,4,1)\\) is a valid permutation. This gives 329 permutations.\n\nNow let's analyze \\(\\pi = \\sigma \\oplus id_j\\). \\(id_j\\) avoids 213. So \\(\\sigma\\) must be 132-avoiding.\n  - \\((4,1,2,3)\\) is 132-avoiding. Allowed. \\(j \\in [1, 329]\\). This gives 329 permutations.\n  - \\((3,2,1)\\) is 132-avoiding. Allowed. \\(j \\in [1, 330]\\). This gives 330 permutations.\n  - \\((2,3,4,1)\\) contains a 132 pattern. Excluded.\n\nWe also have cases like \\(\\pi=id_j\\oplus \\sigma \\oplus id_k\\), which are covered if \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_k\\) is indecomposable (which it's not). The decomposition into indecomposable blocks is unique. Any permutation can be written as \\(\\pi = id_{j_0} \\oplus \\sigma_1 \\oplus id_{j_1} \\oplus \\dots \\oplus \\sigma_m \\oplus id_{j_m}\\). We have covered all cases by considering direct sums of indecomposable permutations and identity permutations.\n\nTotal Count:\n1.  Indecomposable permutations: 3\n2.  \\(\\sigma \\in I_1^{av}, \\tau \\in I_2^{av}\\): 2\n3.  \\(\\sigma \\in I_2^{av}, \\tau \\in I_1^{av}\\): 1\n4.  Three components from \\(I_1^{av}\\): 1\n5.  Decompositions with \\(id_j\\):\n    -   \\(id_j \\oplus (3,2,1)\\): 330\n    -   \\(id_j \\oplus (2,3,4,1)\\): 329\n    -   \\((4,1,2,3) \\oplus id_j\\): 329\n    -   \\((3,2,1) \\oplus id_j\\): 330\n\nLet's sum these up.\nTotal = \\(3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 330 + 329 + 329 + 330 = 1325\\).\nThere is one overlap: \\((3,2,1)\\) composed with \\(id_j\\) on both sides is counted in both groups. For \\(\\pi=id_k \\oplus(3,2,1)\\oplus id_l\\), with \\(k,l>0\\), we have counted it twice. This form corresponds to taking \\(id_{k+l}\\) and inserting \\((3,2,1)\\) in the middle. We counted this in the set `id_j_left` (\\(\\pi=id_k\\oplus \\sigma\\) with \\(\\sigma=(3,2,1)\\oplus id_l\\)) and `id_j_right`. Let's use inclusion-exclusion or a more careful counting.\n\nLet's count based on the number of non-identity indecomposable blocks.\n- One block \\(\\sigma \\in I_3^{av}\\):\n  - \\(\\sigma=(4,1,2,3)\\): can be \\(id_j \\oplus \\sigma \\oplus id_k\\) where \\(j,k \\ge 0, j+k=329\\). Must be 132-avoiding on left part and 213-avoiding on right. \\(id_j\\) is not 132-avoiding for \\(j \\ge 3\\), so \\(\\sigma \\oplus id_k\\) must be 213-avoiding. It's not. This forces \\(j=0\\) or \\(k=0\\).\n    - \\(j=0, k=329\\): \\((4,1,2,3)\\oplus id_{329}\\).\n    - \\(k=0, j=329\\): \\(id_{329} \\oplus (4,1,2,3)\\). Not allowed, \\((4,1,2,3)\\) is not 213-avoiding.\n    This gives 1 permutation.\n  - \\(\\sigma=(3,2,1)\\): 132-avoiding and 213-avoiding. \\(j+k=330\\). This gives \\(331\\) choices for \\((j,k)\\). 331 permutations.\n  - \\(\\sigma=(2,3,4,1)\\): 132-containing and 213-avoiding. Forces left part to be 132-avoiding. Can only have \\(id_0,id_1,id_2\\) on left. Let's simplify and assume \\(j=0\\) or \\(k=0\\).\n    - \\(j=0, k=329\\): \\((2,3,4,1)\\oplus id_{329}\\).\n    - \\(k=0, j=329\\): \\(id_{329} \\oplus (2,3,4,1)\\).\n    This gives 2 permutations.\n- Two blocks \\(\\sigma_1\\oplus\\sigma_2\\). \\(inv=1+2\\) or \\(2+1\\). 3 structures. This gives \\(3 \\times (333-5+1) = 3 \\times 329\\) perms?\nThis gets too complex. Let's re-verify the simple sum. A permutation is uniquely of the form \\(id_j \\oplus \\sigma\\), where \\(\\sigma\\) is indecomposable, or it is \\(id_n\\). The number of permutations is \\(\\sum_j |I_{n-j}^k|\\). This was the recurrence method.\n\nRecalculating with the recurrence: \\(a_n^k = a_{n-1}^k + |I_n^k|\\).\n\\(a_{333}^3 = a_2^3 + \\sum_{j=3}^{333} |I_j^3|\\). And \\(a_2^3=0\\).\n$|I_n^k|$ = number of indecomposable 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions.\n- \\(|I_3^3|=1\\): \\((3,2,1)\\).\n- \\(|I_4^3|=4\\): \\((4,1,2,3), (2,3,4,1), (2,4,1,3), (3,1,4,2)\\).\n- \\(|I_5^3|=5\\): from structural types \\((4,1,2,3)\\), \\((3,2,1)\\), \\((2,3,4,1)\\), and \\((2,1)\\oplus(3,1,2)\\), \\((3,1,2)\\oplus(2,1)\\).\n- \\(|I_n^3|=6\\) for \\(n\\ge 6\\), from the 6 structural types.\nSumming up:\n\\(a_{333}^3 = |I_3^3| + |I_4^3| + |I_5^3| + \\sum_{j=6}^{333} |I_j^3|\\).\n\\(a_{333}^3 = 1 + 4 + 5 + (333-6+1) \\times 6 = 10 + 328 \\times 6 = 10 + 1968 = 1978\\).\n\nLet's do the initial sum again carefully.\nThe set of all permutations is the disjoint union of indecomposable permutations and decomposable ones. A decomposable perm is \\(id_j \\oplus \\sigma\\) for some \\(j>0\\).\nSo \\(a_n^k = |I_n^k| + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} |\\{\\pi=id_j\\oplus \\tau\\}|\\). \\(\\tau\\) is a permutation of length \\(n-j\\). \\(inv(\\tau)=k\\). And \\(id_j\\oplus \\tau\\) must be a 1324 avoider. This happens iff \\(\\tau\\) is a 1324 avoider (since \\(id_j\\) is 132-avoiding).\nSo \\(a_n^k = |I_n^k| + \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} a_{n-j}^k = |I_n^k| + \\sum_{m=1}^{n-1} a_m^k\\).\nThis gives \\(a_n^k - a_{n-1}^k = |I_n^k|\\). This recurrence is correct. The calculation of 1978 seems robust.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Let av_n^k(1324) denote the number of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with k inversions.\n    # We want to determine av_333^3(1324).\n    #\n    # Let a(n,k) be av_n^k(1324).\n    # Any permutation is either indecomposable or decomposable.\n    # A permutation pi is decomposable if pi = sigma (+) tau for non-empty sigma, tau.\n    # Otherwise, pi is indecomposable.\n    #\n    # This leads to a recurrence relation for a(n,k).
