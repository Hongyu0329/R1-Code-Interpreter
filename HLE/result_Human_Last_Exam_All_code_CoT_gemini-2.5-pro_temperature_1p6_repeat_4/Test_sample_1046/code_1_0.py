    Explains how a bacterium with a stable genome can acquire drug resistance

    print("--------------------------------")
    print("Bacterium 1: Acquires resistance quickly via Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT). This is like sharing a cheat sheet in an exam - very fast and efficient.")
    print("Bacterium 2: Has a stable genome and must rely on random mutations. This is like trying to figure out the answers from scratch - usually much slower.")
    print("\nThe Paradox: How can the 'slow' method of Bacterium 2 keep pace with the 'fast' method of Bacterium 1?")
    print("\nLet's evaluate the key factors for accelerated evolution in Bacterium 2:")
    print("1. Initial Resistance Mutation: A rare mutation occurs that provides resistance. However, this often comes with a 'fitness cost,' meaning the bacterium might grow slower or be weaker in other ways.")
    print("2. Compensatory Mutations: A second mutation may occur that offsets the 'fitness cost' of the first. This makes the resistant bacterium strong and competitive again, allowing it to rapidly multiply and dominate the population under the pressure of the antibiotic.")
    print("3. Cross-Resistance: This is the critical accelerator. The mutations that arose don't just provide resistance to one drug, but to a whole family or multiple types of drugs. When a new drug is introduced, the bacterium is already prepared.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("The most complete explanation is that the second bacterial population experienced a powerful combination of events.")
    print("A rare mutation provided resistance, subsequent compensatory mutations eliminated any fitness cost, allowing the new strain to thrive. Crucially, this resistance was a 'cross-resistance,' protecting it from multiple drugs.")
    print("This combination allows a single, highly successful mutant lineage to sweep through the population and be pre-prepared for new threats, matching the pace of the more flexible LGT mechanism.")
    print("\nTherefore, the best explanation is given in option B.")
