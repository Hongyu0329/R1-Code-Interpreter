    "To find the first two non-zero digits of the decimal representation of $e^{-7^{13}}$, we need to determine the mantissa of this number when expressed in scientific notation.\n\nLet $N = e^{-7^{13}}$.\nWe can write $N$ in the form $M \\times 10^E$, where $M$ is the mantissa ($1 \\le M < 10$) and $E$ is an integer exponent. The non-zero digits of $N$ are given by the digits of the mantissa $M$.\n\nTo find $M$ and $E$, we use the base-10 logarithm:\n$\\log_{10}(N) = \\log_{10}(e^{-7^{13}})$\n$\\log_{10}(N) = -7^{13} \\times \\log_{10}(e)$\n\nLet $x = \\log_{10}(N)$. Then $N = 10^x$.\nWe can decompose $x$ into its integer and fractional parts: $x = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}$, where $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, and $\\{x\\}$ is the fractional part, with $0 \\le \\{x\\} < 1$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $N$:\n$N = 10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\{x\\}} = 10^{\\{x\\}} \\times 10^{\\lfloor x \\rfloor}$\n\nFrom this, we can see that the mantissa is $M = 10^{\\{x\\}}$ and the exponent is $E = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$. The first two non-zero digits of $N$ are simply the first two digits of $M$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this logic to calculate the mantissa and extract its first two digits.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The goal is to find the first two non-zero digits of N = e^(-7^13).\n# We compute log10(N) to find the mantissa of N in scientific notation.\n# log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e)\n\n# Step 1: Calculate the value of log10(N).\n# Python's standard float precision is sufficient for this calculation.\npower_of_7 = 7**13\nlog10_of_e = math.log10(math.e)\nlog_N = -power_of_7 * log10_of_e\n\n# Step 2: Separate log_N into its integer and positive fractional parts.\n# Let log_N = E + f, where E is the integer part (exponent) and f is the fractional part.\n# N = 10^(E+f) = 10^f * 10^E. The mantissa is M = 10^f.\n# E = floor(log_N)\n# f = log_N - E\ninteger_part = math.floor(log_N)\nfractional_part = log_N - integer_part\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the mantissa M.\nmantissa = 10**fractional_part\n\n# The final equation is e^(-7^13) = mantissa * 10^integer_part.\n# Here are the numbers in that equation:\nprint(f\"The number e^(-7^13) can be written in scientific notation as M * 10^E.\")\nprint(f\"The calculated mantissa M is: {mantissa}\")\nprint(f\"The calculated exponent E is: {integer_part}\")\n\n# Step 4: Extract the first two digits from the mantissa.\nmantissa_str = str(mantissa)\ndigits_str = mantissa_str.replace('.', '')\nfirst_digit = digits_str[0]\nsecond_digit = digits_str[1]\n\nprint(f\"\\nThe first two non-zero digits of e^(-7^13) are {first_digit} and {second_digit}.\")\n```\n<<<15>>>"
