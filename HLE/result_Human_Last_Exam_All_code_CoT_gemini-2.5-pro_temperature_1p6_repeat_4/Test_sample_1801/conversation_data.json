    "This is a factual question that can be answered by recalling historical information. My plan is to identify the two individuals and then, as requested, present this information using a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the individuals:** The question asks for the two Nobel laureates in a specific Enron commercial. I will recall or look up this information.\n2.  **Formulate the Python code:** I will create a simple Python script. The script will define two variables containing the names of the laureates and then use the `print()` function to display the answer clearly.\n3.  **Provide the final answer:** After the code block, I will provide the names in the specified `<<<answer>>>` format.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the names of the two Nobel laureates\n# who were featured in an Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial in 2000.\n\ndef find_laureates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the names of the two Nobel laureates from the Enron commercial.\n    \"\"\"\n    laureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\n    laureate_2 = \"Kenneth Arrow\"\n    \n    print(\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron commercial were:\")\n    print(f\"1. {laureate_1}\")\n    print(f\"2. {laureate_2}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_laureates()\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Kenneth Arrow>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
