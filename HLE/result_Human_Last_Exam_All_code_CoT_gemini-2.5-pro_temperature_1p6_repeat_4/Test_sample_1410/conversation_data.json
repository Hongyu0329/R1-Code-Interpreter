    "This is a complex chess puzzle that requires finding a forced checkmate for White. Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Initial Position:**\n    The FEN `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` describes the board.\n    - White pieces of note: King on g1, Queen on d5, Knight on e5, Rook on f1, Bishop on h5.\n    - Black pieces of note: King on g8, Queen on g5, Rook on e8, Rook on e1.\n    - It's White's turn to move (`w`).\n    - The White King on g1 is in check by the Black Rook on e1.\n\n2.  **Evaluate White's Legal Moves:**\n    White must get out of check. The possible moves are:\n    *   `1. Rxe1`: White Rook captures Black Rook. This fails, as Black replies `1...Rxe1+`, and whether White plays `2. Kh2` or `2. Kf2`, Black delivers checkmate with `2...Qxg2#` or `2...Qxf2#` respectively.\n    *   `1. Kh2`: White King moves to h2. This looks promising, but Black has a devastating response: `1...Qxd5`. White must recapture with `2. Bxd5`. Now, White is down significant material (a Rook for a Bishop) against two active Black Rooks and has a losing position.\n    *   `1. Qxe1`: White Queen captures Black Rook. This fails because of `1...Rxe1+` (check!). White must move the king, e.g., `2. Kh2`. Now Black's Queen on g5 is attacked by White's Knight on e5, but Black can play `2...Rxe5`, winning the knight. Black emerges with a material advantage.\n    *   `1. Kf2`: This is the only move that leads to a win for White. The King escapes check, and simultaneously, White puts pressure on Black's Queen (on g5) and Knight (on c6).\n\n3.  **Determine the Optimal Line of Play:**\n    Since `1. Kf2` is the only winning move, we analyze Black's best response. Black must defend against the threats while trying to survive as long as possible.\n    *   **A shorter mate line:** If Black makes a simple queen move like `1... Qh4`, White can force a mate in 3 moves: `2. Nxf7+ Kh7 3. Qg8#`.\n    *   **Black's best defense:** Black's best move is `1... Qe3+`. This move checks the White King and forces a more complex sequence. This line demonstrates optimal defense, prolonging the game. White must continue precisely with a \"king walk\".\n\n4.  **The Main Mating Sequence:**\n    Assuming optimal play from both sides, the sequence unfolds as follows:\n    1.  `Kf2 Qe3+` : White moves the king, Black checks.\n    2.  `Kg3 Qxg2+`: White's king continues its walk. Black captures a pawn to continue the attack.\n    3.  `Kh4 Ne7`: The White king bravely advances. Black's `3...Ne7` is the best try, preparing to defend the f7 square. If Black instead plays `3...g5+`, it leads to mate after `4. Kh5`.\n    4.  `Qxf7#`: White delivers the final blow. The queen is protected by the knight on e5, and the black king has no escape squares.\n\nThis sequence shows that even with Black's best defense, White can force a checkmate in 4 of its moves.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the chess puzzle and prints the result.\n    The puzzle asks for the number of moves in which White can force a win.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The final answer for the number of moves.\n    num_moves_to_win = 4\n\n    # The detailed explanation of the logic.\n    explanation = [\n        \"The problem asks for the number of moves White needs to win from the given FEN.\",\n        \"The analysis reveals a forced checkmate sequence for White.\",\n        \"White's only winning move is 1. Kf2. All other ways to get out of check lead to a loss or a draw.\",\n        \"Against White's best move, Black's optimal defense is 1... Qe3+, which forces a longer, more complex sequence.\",\n        \"This line leads to a checkmate in 4 moves for White.\"\n    ]\n\n    # The full move sequence for the forced checkmate.\n    mating_sequence = [\n        \"1.
