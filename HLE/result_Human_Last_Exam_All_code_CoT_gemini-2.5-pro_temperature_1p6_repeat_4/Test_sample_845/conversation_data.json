    "The value you are looking for is the time interval between consecutive heartbeats. In the context of electrocardiography (ECG), this is most precisely called the R-R interval, which is the time elapsed between two successive R-waves of the QRS complex. Even when using PPG, the term R-R interval is commonly used, although inter-beat interval (IBI) is also a correct term.\n\nI will provide a simple python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and returns the name of the value computed between heartbeats for HRV.\n    \"\"\"\n    # HRV is the measure of the variation in time between consecutive heartbeats.\n    # This time duration is known as the R-R interval (the interval between two consecutive R-waves of an ECG)\n    # or more generally as the inter-beat interval (IBI).\n    value_name = \"R-R interval\"\n    print(f\"The value computed as a time duration between heartbeats to calculate HRV is called the: {value_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<R-R interval>>>"
