    This function derives and explains the formula for the sum of sharps.

    The 12 musical notes are represented by pitch classes 0 through 11.
    The number of sharps for a major key with tonic pitch class `p` is (7 * p) % 12.

    When each of the 12 initial notes is sharped 'n' times, their pitch class `p`
    becomes `(p + n) % 12`. The set of 12 resulting pitch classes is still
    {0, 1, 2, ..., 11}, just in a different order.

    Therefore, the sum of sharps is constant regardless of 'n'. We can calculate
    this constant sum.
