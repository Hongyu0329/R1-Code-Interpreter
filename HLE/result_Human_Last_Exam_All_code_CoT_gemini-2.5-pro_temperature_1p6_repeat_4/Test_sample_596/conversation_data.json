    "This problem asks for the number of certain combinatorial objects (non-collapsing rooted forests) on a topological space (the Möbius band). The solution lies in applying a powerful theorem from algebraic topology that connects this combinatorial quantity to a topological invariant of the space.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **State the relevant theorem:** The core of the solution is a result from combinatorial topology. The number of higher-dimensional rooted forests on a $d$-dimensional simplicial complex $K$ that fail to simplicially collapse onto their roots is given by the square of the order of the torsion subgroup of its $(d-1)$-th homology group, i.e., $|\\text{Tors}(H_{d-1}(K; \\mathbb{Z}))|^2$.\n2.  **Identify the properties of the space:** The space is the Möbius band. We need to determine its dimension $d$ and its $(d-1)$-th homology group.\n3.  **Determine the dimension:** The Möbius band is a 2-dimensional surface, so any triangulation of it is a 2-dimensional simplicial complex. Thus, $d=2$.\n4.  **Calculate the required homology group:** We need to find the $(2-1)=1$st homology group of the Möbius band with integer coefficients, denoted $H_1(\\text{Möbius}; \\mathbb{Z})$. The Möbius band is homotopy equivalent to its central core, which is a circle ($S^1$). Since homotopy equivalent spaces have identical homology groups, we have $H_1(\\text{Möbius}; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_1(S^1; \\mathbb{Z})$. The first homology group of a circle is the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n5.  **Find the torsion subgroup:** We need to find the torsion subgroup of $H_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$. The torsion subgroup consists of all elements of finite order. In the group of integers $\\mathbb{Z}$, the only element of finite order is 0. Therefore, the torsion subgroup is the trivial group, $\\{0\\}$.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:** The order (or size) of the torsion subgroup $\\{0\\}$ is 1. Plugging this into the theorem's formula, we get the final answer: $1^2 = 1$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, explaining each step of the reasoning and printing the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_forest_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the number of non-collapsing higher dimensional rooted forests\n    on a standard triangulation of the Möbius band.\n\n    The solution is based on a theorem from algebraic topology.
