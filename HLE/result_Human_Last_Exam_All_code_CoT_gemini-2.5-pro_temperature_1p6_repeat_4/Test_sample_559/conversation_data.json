    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System and its Equilibria**: I'll write down the equations for the phase plane dynamics, find the equilibrium points where both derivatives are zero, and classify them.\n2.  **Identify the Saddle Point**: A separatrix is a curve that separates regions of different dynamic behaviors. Such curves are typically the stable and unstable manifolds of a saddle point. I will identify the saddle point from the equilibrium points.\n3.  **Find the Equation of the Separatrix**: I will look for an invariant curve (a solution trajectory) that passes through the saddle point. This can be done by solving the phase plane differential equation $\\frac{dd}{du}$. The equation is a Riccati equation, which can be hard to solve in general. However, simple polynomial solutions are often candidates for separatrices. I'll test a simple form, $d=au^n$, to see if it satisfies the differential equation.\n4.  **Construct the Python Code**: The final python code will print the equation of the found separatrix, clearly stating the coefficients and powers involved as requested.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\nThe system of differential equations is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2(t) + (5u^2(t) - 3u(t))d(t) - u^3(t)(1 - u(t))$\n$u'(t) = u^2(t)(u(t) - 1)$\n\nThe trajectories in the $(u, d)$ phase plane are described by the equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n\n**1. Equilibrium Points**\nWe set $u'(t)=0$ and $d'(t)=0$.\n$u'(t) = u^2(u-1) = 0 \\implies u=0$ or $u=1$.\n*   If $u=0$, then $d' = 2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$. So, $(0,0)$ is an equilibrium point.\n*   If $u=1$, then $d' = 2d^2 + (5-3)d = 2d^2 + 2d = 2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$. So, $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ are equilibrium points.\n\n**2. Stability Analysis and Saddle Point Identification**\nWe compute the Jacobian matrix of the system to classify these points:\n$J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d + 5u^2 - 3u \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n*   At $(1,0)$: $J(1,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=2$. Both are positive, so $(1,0)$ is an unstable node.\n*   At $(1,-1)$: $J(1,-1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}$. Eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1=1, \\lambda_2=-2$. They have opposite signs, so $(1,-1)$ is a saddle point.\n\nThe separatrix is related to the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\n**3. Finding the Equation for the Separatrix**\nThe phase plane equation is a Riccati equation for $d(u)$. Let's search for a simple particular solution, for instance, a curve of the form $d = a u^k$. Trying $d = -u^2$:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = -2u$.\nSubstitute $d = -u^2$ into the ODE:\n$-2u \\stackrel{?}{=} \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)(-u^2) - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u - 1)}$\nMultiply by the denominator $u^3 - u^2$:\n$-2u(u^3 - u^2) \\stackrel{?}{=} 2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4$\n$-2u^4 + 2u^3 \\stackrel{?}{=} -2u^4 + 2u^3$\nThis is an identity, so $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution trajectory of the system.\n\nLet's check if this trajectory passes through any of the equilibrium points.\n*   For $u=0$, $d = -0^2 = 0$. It passes through $(0,0)$.\n*   For $u=1$, $d = -1^2 = -1$. It passes through the saddle point $(1,-1)$.\n\nA trajectory that passes through a saddle point is a separatrix (specifically, part of its stable or unstable manifold). Therefore, the curve $d = -u^2$ is a separatrix for the system.\n\nThe code below prints this equation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the equation of the separatrix for the given system of ODEs.\n    The derivation is explained in the text above. The separatrix is found to be\n    a simple parabolic curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The equation of the separatrix is d = -u^2.\n    # We can write this in the form A*d^B + C*u^D = E\n    \n    coeff_d = 1\n    power_d = 1\n    \n    coeff_u = 1\n    power_u = 2\n    \n    constant = 0\n    \n    # Rearranging d = -u^2 to d + u^2 = 0\n    # which is 1*d^1 + 1*u^2 = 0\n    \n    print(\"The equation of the separatrix is d = -u**2.\")\n    print(\"This can be written in a standard form as: d + u**2 = 0.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe numbers in this equation are:\")\n    print(f\"Term d: coefficient = {coeff_d}, power = {power_d}\")\n    print(f\"Term u: coefficient = {coeff_u}, power = {power_u}\")\n    print(f\"Constant on the right side: {constant}\")\n    \n    # Final representation of the equation showing each number\n    print(f\"\\nThe equation with all numbers explicitly shown is: ({coeff_d})*d**{power_d} + ({coeff_u})*u**{power_u} = {constant}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<The separatrix is given by the equation d = -u^2.>>>"
