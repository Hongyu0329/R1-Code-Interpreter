    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of times Chekov described Otchumyelov's coat changes.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Objective:** Count the symbolic descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat in Anton Chekov's \"The Chameleon.\" These descriptions are not just mentions of the coat, but the specific actions of putting it on or taking it off, which symbolize his shifting allegiance and fear.\n2.  **Method:** I will write a Python script to perform the analysis.\n3.  **Execution:**\n    *   The script will first download the public domain text of the story.\n    *   It will then use regular expressions (`re` module) to search for key phrases indicating the coat is being removed (e.g., \"off with my coat\"). These moments correspond to Otchumyelov feeling \"hot\" out of fear or deference.\n    *   It will also search for phrases indicating the coat is being put on (e.g., \"Put on my coat,\" \"wraps himself in his greatcoat\"). These moments correspond to him reasserting his authority.\n    *   The script will count the total number of these distinct actions found in the text.\n    *   Finally, it will print the individual counts and the total sum, presenting it as an equation.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the analysis.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef count_coat_changes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Downloads and analyzes \"The Chameleon\" by Anton Chekov to count\n    the symbolic descriptions of Otchumyelov's coat changing.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Step 1: Download the story from a public domain source (Project Gutenberg).\n        # This plain text file contains the standard Constance Garnett translation.\n        url = \"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/13415/13415-0.txt\"\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for bad status codes\n        text = response.text\n\n        # Step 2: Define regular expression patterns for taking the coat ON and OFF.\n        # These phrases are key indicators of Otchumyelov's changing state of mind.\n        \n        # Pattern for taking the coat OFF (he feels \"hot\"). The phrase \"off with my coat\" appears twice.\n        off_pattern = r\"off with my coat\"\n        \n        # Pattern for putting the coat ON (he feels \"chilly\" or reasserts authority).\n        # We combine two distinct phrases into one pattern using '|' (OR).\n        on_pattern = r\"(Put on my coat|wraps himself in his greatcoat)\"\n\n        # Step 3: Find all occurrences of these patterns in the text.\n        off_matches = re.findall(off_pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)\n        on_matches = re.findall(on_pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)\n\n        num_off = len(off_matches)\n        num_on = len(on_matches)\n        total_changes = num_off + num_on\n\n        # Step 4: Print the results and the final equation.\n        print(f\"Analysis of Otchumyelov's coat in 'The Chameleon':\\n\")\n        print(f\"Found {num_off} instance(s) of the coat being taken OFF.\")\n        print(f\"Found {num_on} instance(s) of the coat being put ON.\")\n        print(\"-\" * 40)\n        print(\"The total number of symbolic descriptions is calculated as follows:\")\n        print(f\"{num_off} + {num_on} = {total_changes}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to download the story.
