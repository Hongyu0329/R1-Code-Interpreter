The user's premise that the local magnetic field should be used for helicity calculations of AIC waves is correct. The common practice of using components perpendicular to the radial direction at L1 is a simplification that introduces projection errors because the magnetic field there typically follows the Parker Spiral and is not purely radial. The most accurate analyses require transforming the data into a Field-Aligned Coordinate system.
