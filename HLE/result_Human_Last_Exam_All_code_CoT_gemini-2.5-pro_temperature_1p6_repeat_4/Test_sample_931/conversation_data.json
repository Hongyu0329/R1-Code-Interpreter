    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the correct answer. I will create a Python script that encodes the known dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies). The script will then evaluate each of the given answer choices against these facts. It will print its analysis, explaining why certain food sources are correct and others are not, ultimately identifying the most comprehensive correct answer from the list.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to find the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known facts about adult Raphidiopteran diet.\n    # They are primarily predatory but also supplement with other sources.\n    diet_facts = {\n        \"predatory\": \"Yes, on small, soft-bodied arthropods like aphids.\",\n        \"pollen_nectar\": \"Yes, some species feed on pollen and nectar for energy.\",\n        \"fungus\": \"No, they are not known to be fungivores.\",\n        \"herbivorous\": \"No, they do not eat leaf tissue.\",\n        \"native_to_new_zealand\": \"No, they are found in the Northern Hemisphere.\"\n    }\n\n    # The provided answer choices.\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': 'A and E',\n        'G': 'D and E'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans:\")\n    \n    # Evaluate Choice A: Nectar\n    is_a_correct = \"nectar\" in diet_facts[\"pollen_nectar\"].lower()\n    print(f\"\\nAnalysis of A (Nectar):\")\n    print(f\"Fact: Adult Raphidiopterans are known to consume nectar.\")\n    print(f\"Conclusion: Choice A is correct.
