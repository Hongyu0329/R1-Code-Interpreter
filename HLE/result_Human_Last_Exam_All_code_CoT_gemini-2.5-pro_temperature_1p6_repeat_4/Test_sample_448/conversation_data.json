    "The rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon (Rn). Unlike other noble gases, Radon is radioactive, with its most stable isotope having a half-life of only 3.8 days. It is constantly formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust and quickly decays itself. This transient nature means it only ever exists in extremely minute quantities, making it far rarer than the rarest stable noble gas, Xenon. The abundance values for these gases have not changed significantly in recent history, so the data from 2002 is functionally identical to current estimates.\n\nThe following Python script calculates the percentage of Radon in all terrestrial matter. It does so by first calculating the total mass of Radon in the atmosphere (where it is most concentrated) and then finding what percentage that mass is of the total mass of the Earth.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rarest_noble_gas_percentage():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the percentage of the rarest noble gas (Radon)\n    in all terrestrial matter.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Scientific data for the calculation. These values are stable and\n    # representative for the year 2002.\n    gas_name = \"Radon (Rn)\"\n    \n    # Mass of the Earth in kilograms\n    mass_earth_kg = 5.972e24\n    \n    # Mass of the Earth's atmosphere in kilograms\n    mass_atmosphere_kg = 5.15e18\n    \n    # Mass fraction of Radon in the atmosphere. This is an extremely small number.\n    radon_mass_fraction_in_atmosphere = 6e-17\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {gas_name}.\")\n    print(\"This script calculates its approximate percentage of all terrestrial matter.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the total mass of Radon in the atmosphere\n    total_mass_radon_kg = radon_mass_fraction_in_atmosphere * mass_atmosphere_kg\n    \n    # Step 2: Calculate the final percentage relative to Earth's total mass\n    percentage_of_earth = (total_mass_radon_kg / mass_earth_kg) * 100\n\n    # Print the equation and the final result\n    print(\"Equation: ((Radon Mass Fraction in Atmosphere * Mass of Atmosphere) / Mass of Earth) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Percentage = (({radon_mass_fraction_in_atmosphere} * {mass_atmosphere_kg}) / {mass_earth_kg}) * 100\")\n    print(f\"Final Percentage: {percentage_of_earth:.4e} %\")\n\ncalculate_rarest_noble_gas_percentage()\n\n<<<Radon (Rn)>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What was the rarest noble gas on Earth as as a percentage of all terrestrial matter in 2002?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
