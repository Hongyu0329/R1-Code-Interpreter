    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with the 6-31G basis set, we first need to determine the number of functions for each atom and then sum them up.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the atoms:** Toluene has the chemical formula C7H8, which means it consists of 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Understand the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   This is a split-valence basis set. The name describes how primitive Gaussian functions are combined to form contracted functions (which represent atomic orbitals).\n    *   **For a Carbon atom (C)**, a second-row element:\n        *   The core (1s) orbital is described by 1 contracted function (made from 6 primitives).\n        *   The inner valence (2s, 2p) orbitals are described by 1 s-type and 3 p-type functions, for a total of 4 contracted functions (each made from 3 primitives).\n        *   The outer valence (2s, 2p) orbitals are described by another 1 s-type and 3 p-type functions, for a total of 4 contracted functions (each made from 1 primitive).\n        *   Total functions per Carbon atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9.\n    *   **For a Hydrogen atom (H)**, a first-row element:\n        *   It has no core electrons. Its valence (1s) orbital is split.\n        *   The inner part is 1 contracted function (from 3 primitives).\n        *   The outer part is 1 contracted function (from 1 primitive).\n        *   Total functions per Hydrogen atom = 1 (inner) + 1 (outer) = 2.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of each atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and add them together.\n    *   Total = (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/Carbon) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/Hydrogen)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final result.\n\n```python\n# Number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Number of contracted Gaussian functions for each atom in the 6-31G basis set\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9  # 1 (1s) + 4 (2s, 2p) + 4 (2s', 2p')\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2 # 1 (1s) + 1 (1s')\n\n# Calculate the contribution from each type of atom\ntotal_for_carbon = num_carbon * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_for_hydrogen = num_hydrogen * functions_per_hydrogen\n\n# Calculate the total number of basis functions\ntotal_functions = total_for_carbon + total_for_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result\nprint(f\"Molecule: Toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen})\")\nprint(f\"Basis Set: 6-31G\\n\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Carbon atom = {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Functions per Hydrogen atom = {functions_per_hydrogen}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Contribution from {num_carbon} Carbon atoms: {num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon} = {total_for_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Contribution from {num_hydrogen} Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen} = {total_for_hydrogen}\\n\")\nprint(f\"Total number of contracted Gaussian functions = ({num_carbon} * {functions_per_carbon}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {functions_per_hydrogen}) = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
