    Analyzes the assumptions required to prove that the expected information gain
    for a Bayesian agent approaches zero and provides the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form.

    The key insight is that the total expected information gain over all time is
    bounded by the initial uncertainty of the agent, which is captured by the
    entropy of its prior distribution.

    Let EIG_t be the expected information gain at time t.
    There is a theorem in Bayesian statistics stating that:
    Sum_{t=0 to infinity} EIG_t <= H(P_0)
    where H(P_0) is the entropy of the prior distribution.

    For the sum of a series of non-negative terms (EIG is always non-negative) to be finite,
    the terms themselves must approach zero. Therefore, if the right-hand side, H(P_0), is finite,
    it forces the limit of EIG_t as t goes to infinity to be zero.

    This makes 'a. The prior has finite entropy' a crucial assumption for the proof.
    The other options are either consequences of learning (e) or conditions for specific
    models (b, c, d) that are not universally necessary for the principle to hold.

    The answer 'a' in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) with the specified formatting rules is '[(a)]'.
