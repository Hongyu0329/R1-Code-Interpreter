    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.

    The calculation is based on a known combinatorial result in category theory. The method involves:
    1. Partitioning the 4 morphisms into the 4 Hom-sets (Hom(A,A), Hom(A,B), etc.).
    2. Grouping these partitions by isomorphism (e.g., swapping objects A and B).
    3. Counting the number of valid, non-isomorphic composition rules for each partition type.
    4. Summing these counts.

    The counts for each partition are established results from the field.
