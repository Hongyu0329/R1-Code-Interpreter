    This function determines the greatest possible rank of the matrix E.

    The problem asks for the greatest possible rank of a matrix E with the minimum
    Frobenius norm, such that a given non-zero vector x is a least-squares solution
    for the system defined by (A+E) and b.

    1. The least-squares condition is (A+E)^T((A+E)x - b) = 0.
    2. Let r = (A+E)x - b be the residual. The condition is (A+E)^T r = 0.
    3. The minimum norm E that satisfies this constraint is sought.
    4. The problem can be reformulated as finding E with minimum norm satisfying
       two linear constraints for a certain optimal residual r:
       a) Ex = r - (Ax - b)
       b) E^T r = -A^T r
    5. The solution to this subproblem has the general form E = a @ x.T + r @ b.T,
       where a and b are some vectors.
    6. A matrix formed by the sum of two rank-1 matrices has a rank of at most 2.
       The column space of E is a subspace of span({a, r}), so its dimension
       is at most 2.
    7. For a general choice of A, b, and x, a rank of 2 is achievable.
