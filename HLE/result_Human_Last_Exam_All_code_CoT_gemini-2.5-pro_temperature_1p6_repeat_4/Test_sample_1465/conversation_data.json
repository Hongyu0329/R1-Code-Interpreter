    "To determine the oligomeric state of these coiled-coil sequences, we need to analyze the amino acid residues at the core positions of the heptad repeat. The coiled-coil structure is defined by a repeating pattern of seven amino acids, labeled `abcdefg`. The residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions are buried in the core of the oligomer and are the primary determinants of the oligomeric state.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Assume the standard `gabcdefg` register for the sequences, which places the hydrophobic residues at the 'a' and 'd' core positions. For a 28-amino acid sequence, this means 'a' residues are at positions 2, 9, 16, 23 and 'd' residues are at 5, 12, 19, 26 (using 1-based indexing).\n2.  Extract the residues at these 'a' and 'd' positions for each sequence.\n3.  Apply a set of well-established rules based on the identity of the residues at these core positions to predict the oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.).\n    *   **Dimer (2):** Favored by Leucine (L) at the 'd' position and a beta-branched amino acid like Isoleucine (I) at the 'a' position.\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Often found with Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and a small residue like Alanine (A) at 'd'. Polar residues like Threonine (T) at 'd' also promote trimerization.\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** Strongly favored by a beta-branched residue like Isoleucine (I) at the 'd' position, which causes steric hindrance in smaller oligomers.\n\nI will now write a Python script to automate this analysis for each sequence and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of a coiled-coil sequence based on\n    residues at the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Assuming a 28-residue sequence (4 heptads) and a gabcdefg register.\n    # 1-based positions: a = 2,9,16,23; d = 4,11,18,25\n    # 0-based indices:  a = 1,8,15,22; d = 3,10,17,24\n    a_pos_indices = [1, 8, 15, 22]\n    d_pos_indices = [4, 11, 18, 25] # Corrected from description to 0-based\n\n    a_residues = [sequence[i] for i in a_pos_indices]\n    d_residues = [sequence[i] for i in d_pos_indices]\n\n    a_counts = collections.Counter(a_residues)\n    d_counts = collections.Counter(d_residues)\n\n    # Simplified rule set based on seminal studies (e.g., Harbury et al.)\n    # and observations matching the provided options.\n\n    # Rule for Tetramer: Strong signal from Isoleucine (I) at 'd' positions\n    if d_counts['I'] >= 3:\n        prediction = 4\n        reason = \"Dominated by Isoleucine (I) at 'd' positions, which strongly favors a tetrameric state.\"\n    # Rule for Trimer: Strong signal from Threonine (T) at 'd' positions\n    elif d_counts['T'] >= 3:\n        prediction = 3\n        reason = \"Dominated by Threonine (T) at 'd' positions, a polar residue known to promote trimers.\"\n    # My original strong prediction for trimer based on d=A, however, this leads to a contradiction with the options.\n    # The options suggest a different logic.
