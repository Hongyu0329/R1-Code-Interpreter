    Analyzes the conceptual problem about beam transformation and prints the answer.

    The problem asks if an optical system consisting of free-space propagation and
    isotropic phase-shaping media can convert a uniformly linearly polarized beam
    into a vector beam.

    Reasoning:
    1.  Input Beam: Has a uniform linear polarization. The electric field vector points
        in the same direction at all points in the beam's cross-section.
    2.  System Components: Free space and phase-shaping media are isotropic. Their
        optical properties do not depend on the polarization of light.
    3.  Effect on Polarization: Isotropic elements cannot change the state of
        polarization. A horizontally polarized beam remains horizontally polarized after
        passing through them. They can alter the beam's spatial profile (amplitude
        and phase), but not its polarization vector distribution.
    4.  Output Beam (Vector Beam): A vector beam, by definition, has a spatially
        non-uniform polarization state. This requires converting an initial single
        polarization component into at least two components with a spatially
        varying relationship.
    5.  Conclusion: Since no element in the system can perform the necessary
        polarization transformation, it is impossible to generate a vector beam.
        An anisotropic element (like a q-plate) would be required.
