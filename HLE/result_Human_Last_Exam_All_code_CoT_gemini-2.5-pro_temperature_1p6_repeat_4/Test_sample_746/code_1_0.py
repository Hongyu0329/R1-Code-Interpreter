    print("--- The Problem ---")
    print("For a connected topological space X, a point x is a dispersion point if X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
    print("Given that X is a compact connected metric space, what is the maximum cardinality of its set of dispersion points D?")
    print("")

    print("--- The Proof by Contradiction ---")
    print("Let's prove that the number of dispersion points, |D|, cannot be greater than 1.")
    print("\nStep 1: Assume for the sake of contradiction that X has at least two dispersion points.")
    print("Let's call two of these distinct points 'x' and 'y'.")

    print("\nStep 2: By definition, since 'x' is a dispersion point, the space Y = X \\ {x} is totally disconnected.")
    print("A space is totally disconnected if its only connected subsets are single points.")

    print("\nStep 3: The point 'y' is an element of the totally disconnected space Y.")
    print("In a T1 totally disconnected space (a metric space is T1), every singleton set is a connected component.")
    print("Furthermore, in such a space, these components ({p} for any p in Y) are open sets in the subspace topology of Y.")
    print("Therefore, the set {y} is an open set within the space Y = X \\ {x}.")

    print("\nStep 4: Let's analyze what it means for {y} to be open in the subspace X \\ {x}.")
    print("By the definition of subspace topology, it means there exists an open set U in the original space X such that U \u2229 (X \\ {x}) = {y}.")
    print("This condition implies that U must contain 'y' but no other points from X except possibly 'x'.")
    print("So, U must be a subset of {x, y}.")

    print("\nStep 5: We know X is a connected space with at least two points (x and y). A connected space with more than one point cannot have any isolated points.")
    print("If U = {y}, then 'y' would be an isolated point, which is not possible. So, {y} cannot be open in X.")
    print("Therefore, the only possibility for U is the set {x, y}. The set {x, y} must be an open set in X.")

    print("\nStep 6: Now let's consider the properties of X as a metric space.")
    print("Every metric space is a Hausdorff (T2) space. In a Hausdorff space, any finite set of points is a closed set.")
    print("Therefore, the set {x, y} is also a closed set in X.")

    print("\nStep 7: We have concluded that the set {x, y} is both open and closed in X.")
    print("A set that is both open and closed is called 'clopen'.")
    print("The space X is connected, so it cannot be partitioned into two disjoint non-empty open sets. This means a connected space cannot have a proper, non-empty clopen subset.")
    print("The set {x, y} is non-empty. It is also a proper subset (since a two-point metric space is not connected).")
    print("This creates a contradiction with the given fact that X is connected.")

    print("\nStep 8: The contradiction arose from our initial assumption that X has at least two dispersion points.")
    print("Therefore, the assumption must be false. The number of dispersion points is less than 2. |D| <= 1.")
    print("")

    print("--- Confirming the Maximum Value ---")
    print("We have shown |D| <= 1. To show that the maximum is 1, we must confirm that a space with |D|=1 can exist.")
    print("Such spaces do exist. A famous example is the Knaster-Kuratowski fan (or Cantor's leaky tent).")
    print("This space is compact, connected, and has exactly one dispersion point.")
    print("")

    print("--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The maximum cardinality of the set of dispersion points is 1.")
