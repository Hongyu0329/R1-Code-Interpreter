    This function demonstrates the value of the measure for a Grassmann variable integral.

    In the path integral formalism for fermionic systems, fields are represented by
    anticommuting numbers known as Grassmann variables (e.g., η).
    Their defining algebraic property is η_i η_j = -η_j η_i, which implies η² = 0.
    This property η² = 0 is the direct mathematical embodiment of the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

    Integration over a Grassmann variable, called the Berezin integral, is defined by
    a set of simple linear rules, not by finding an area under a curve. For a single
    variable η, the two defining rules for the measure 'dη' are:
    
    1. ∫ dη = 0
    2. ∫ dη η = 1

    The question asks for the "value of the measure". A fundamental way to characterize
    a measure is to find the result of integrating the constant function '1' over the
    space. This represents the total 'volume' or 'size' of the space defined by the measure.
    
    Using the first rule, we can evaluate the integral of the constant '1'.
