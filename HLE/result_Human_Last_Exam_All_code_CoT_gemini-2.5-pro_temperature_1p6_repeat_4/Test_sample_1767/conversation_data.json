    "The Chern number is a topological invariant, and a key property is its additivity. When two topological systems are combined, the Chern number of the composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\nIn this case, we have two Chern insulators, each with a Chern number (C) of 1.\n\n*   Chern Insulator 1: C₁ = 1\n*   Chern Insulator 2: C₂ = 1\n\nThe Chern number of the junction, which represents the combined system, is calculated as follows:\n\nC_total = C₁ + C₂\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the Chern numbers of the two insulators\nc1 = 1\nc2 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of a combined system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the first insulator is: {c1}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the second insulator is: {c2}\")\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction (the combined system) is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {c1} + {c2} = {c_total}\")\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is: {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
