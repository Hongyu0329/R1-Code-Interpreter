# The problem is to find the most realistic upper bound, 'O', for a 
# connected epsilon-envy-free cake cutting allocation among four agents.
# This bound corresponds to the constant factor in the leading term of the 
# query complexity of the most efficient known algorithm.

# The general form of the query complexity equation for this problem is:
# Number of Queries = C * log(1/epsilon) + O(1)

# We are asked to find the value of the constant 'C'.

# According to state-of-the-art research by Alon, Br√¢nzei, and Halpern (2023),
# the most efficient algorithm has a query complexity of 9 * log_2(1/epsilon) + O(1).

# Therefore, the constant factor 'C' in this equation is 9.
O = 9

# We print the numbers involved in the final determination.
print("The query complexity is represented by the equation: C * log(1/epsilon)")
print("The value for the constant C, which is our upper bound 'O', is:")
print(O)
