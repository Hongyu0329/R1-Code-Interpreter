    "For a successful multi-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, preparing a comprehensive set of controls is crucial for accurate data acquisition and analysis. Here is a breakdown of the essential controls you should prepare and the calculation of the total number.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Unstained Control:** Account for the sample of beads alone to measure autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** Account for one control for each of the five fluorophores to set up compensation correctly.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** Account for one control for each channel to help set accurate gates for analysis and sorting.\n4.  **Summation:** Add the numbers of all control types to get the total number of control tubes to prepare.\n5.  **Final Output:** Display the breakdown and the final sum in a clear, readable format.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of essential controls for a\n    flow cytometry experiment with a given number of channels.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_channels = 5\n    fluorophores = \"AF350, GFP, PE, AF647, and AF750\"\n\n    # 1.
