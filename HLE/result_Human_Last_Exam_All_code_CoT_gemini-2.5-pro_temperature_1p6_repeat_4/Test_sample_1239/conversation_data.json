    "To find the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we need to identify all the independent continuous transformations of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the form of the equations invariant. The dimension of the group is the total number of parameters that define these transformations.\n\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$\n2.  $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$\n\nThe dimension is calculated by finding the dimension of the Lie algebra of the symmetry group. This is a well-established result in the mathematical physics literature. The total dimension is the sum of the dimensions of the following independent symmetry groups:\n\n1.  **Time translation:** Shifting the time coordinate ($t \\to t + a$). This is a 1-parameter group.\n2.  **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}$). Since space is 3-dimensional, this gives 3 independent translations.\n3.  **Spatial rotations:** Rotating the spatial coordinates ($\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}$), which also rotates the velocity vector ($\\mathbf{v} \\to R\\mathbf{v}$). The group of rotations in 3D, SO(3), has 3 dimensions.\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** Transforming to a coordinate system moving at a constant velocity ($\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}t, \\mathbf{v} \\to \\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{c}$). This involves a corresponding change in pressure. There are 3 independent boost directions.\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** A uniform scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure. This is a single 1-parameter transformation.\n6.  **Pressure shift:** Shifting the pressure by a constant value ($p \\to p + d$). This does not affect the pressure gradient term $\\nabla p$. This is a 1-parameter symmetry.\n\nThe following Python code will sum up the dimensions of these individual symmetries to compute the total dimension.\n\n```python\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries\n    of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n    symmetries = {\n        \"Time translation\": 1,\n        \"Space translations\": 3,\n        \"Spatial rotations\": 3,\n        \"Galilean boosts\": 3,\n        \"Scaling (Dilation)\": 1,\n        \"Constant pressure shift\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is determined by summing the dimensions of its independent continuous symmetry transformations.\")\n    print(\"\\nThese transformations and their respective dimensions are:\")\n\n    total_dimension = 0\n    dimension_parts = []\n    \n    for name, dim in symmetries.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {dim} dimension(s)\")\n        total_dimension += dim\n        dimension_parts.append(str(dim))\n\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(dimension_parts)\n    print(\"\\nThe total dimension is the sum of these individual dimensions:\")\n    print(f\"Total Dimension = {equation_str} = {total_dimension}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension()\n\n```\n<<<12>>>"
