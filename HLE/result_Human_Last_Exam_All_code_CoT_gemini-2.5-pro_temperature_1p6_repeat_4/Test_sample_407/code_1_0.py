# This script simulates the calculation of the cost of gene flow in yeast,
# following the comprehensive method described in the correct answer.

# Plan:
# 1. Define hypothetical relative fitness values (e.g., from competitive growth assays).
#    - The parental line (no gene flow) is the reference, with fitness = 1.0.
#    - The F1 hybrid line represents the immediate effect of gene flow.
#    - The F2 line (from 'within mating' of hybrids) shows the effects of meiosis.
# 2. Calculate the selection coefficient (s) for the F1 and F2 generations.
#    - The formula is s = 1 - w, where w is the relative fitness of the genotype.
# 3. Print the results clearly, showing each step of the calculation.
