# The problem is to find the integer n for which any tame functor
# f from an upper semilattice J to the category of vector spaces is n-resolvable.

# This integer n corresponds to the maximum possible global dimension of the
# incidence algebra KJ, where J is a finite upper semilattice of tame
# representation type.

# Based on results from the representation theory of algebras:
# 1. The global dimension of an incidence algebra of a general tame poset is at most 4.
# 2. However, the known examples of tame posets with global dimension 3 or 4
#    are not upper semilattices as they have multiple maximal elements.
# 3. A finite upper semilattice has a unique maximal element. This condition
#    constrains the structure of the poset.
# 4. Tame posets that are also upper semilattices have a global dimension of at most 2.
#    A global dimension of 2 is achievable, for example, by the incidence algebra of the
#    poset formed by adding a single maximal element to the "four-subspace" poset (D_4).

# Thus, the maximum projective dimension for any module (functor) is 2.
# This means any such functor is 2-resolvable.

n = 2

# Final equation: n = 2
