    "My plan is to solve this problem by first finding the market equilibrium, which is the point where the supply and demand curves intersect. After finding the equilibrium quantity (Q*) and price (P*), I will calculate the total economic welfare.\n\nHere are the detailed steps:\n1.  **Define Supply and Demand Functions:** I will represent the given supply `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` and demand `P = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))` equations as Python functions.\n2.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Q*, P*):**\n    *   Market equilibrium occurs when quantity supplied equals quantity demanded (Q_S = Q_D = Q*) and the prices are equal. Therefore, I will set the two functions equal to each other: `ln(Q*^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q*))`.\n    *   This equation is transcendental, meaning it cannot be solved algebraically. I will use a numerical method, specifically `scipy.optimize.fsolve`, to find the root of the equation `demand(Q) - supply(Q) = 0`, which gives us the equilibrium quantity `Q*`.\n    *   Once `Q*` is found, I'll calculate the equilibrium price `P*` by plugging `Q*` back into either the supply or demand function.\n3.  **Calculate Total Welfare:**\n    *   Total welfare is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus.\n    *   **Consumer Surplus (CS)** is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price `P*`, from Q=0 to Q*. It's calculated by the integral: `CS = ∫[0 to Q*] (Demand(Q)) dQ - P* * Q*`.\n    *   **Producer Surplus (PS)** is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price `P*`. The supply function `ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > 2^(1/3)`, so this is the starting point for the supply curve on the Q-axis. The formula is: `PS = P* * Q* - ∫[2^(1/3) to Q*] (Supply(Q)) dQ`.\n    *   The integrals will be computed numerically using `scipy.integrate.quad`.\n4.  **Output the Final Result:** Finally, I will sum the consumer and producer surpluses to get the total welfare and print all the components of the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import fsolve\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script calculates the total welfare based on given supply and demand functions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
