    "Of course. The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles for catalytic reactions is a complex topic investigated in materials science. It is not a single, universally fixed value but rather depends on numerous factors, including the catalyst's specific synthesis method and the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature and pressure).\n\nHowever, based on a review of scientific literature, an optimal range is frequently reported that balances high catalytic activity with good thermal stability. The goal is to achieve high dispersion of Ni atoms and maximize the crucial interface between Ni and the Ceria support, while preventing the Ni particles from clumping together (sintering) at high temperatures.\n\nI have created a Python script that calculates and explains a commonly cited optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio based on a catalyst composition of 10 atomic percent Nickel, which is often found to be highly effective for the Water Gas Shift and water splitting reactions.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_optimal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a commonly cited optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio for catalysts.\n\n    The ideal ratio for Ni-Ceria catalysts depends on many factors, but a\n    composition of 10 atomic percent Ni is frequently reported in scientific\n    literature as a sweet spot for maximizing performance in reactions like\n    Water Gas Shift and water splitting.\n\n    This function calculates the corresponding Ni-to-Ce atomic ratio.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the composition in atomic percent (at%)\n    ni_atomic_percent = 10\n    ce_atomic_percent = 100 - ni_atomic_percent\n\n    # Calculate the atomic ratio of Ni to Ce\n    # Ratio = (atoms of Ni) / (atoms of Ce)\n    ni_ce_atomic_ratio = ni_atomic_percent / ce_atomic_percent\n\n    # --- Output ---\n    print(\"Determining a commonly cited optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio for catalytic performance.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"A highly effective catalyst composition is often reported to contain 10 atomic percent Ni and 90 atomic percent Ce.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe calculation for the Ni/Ce atomic ratio is as follows:\")\n    print(\"\\nEquation: Ratio = (Atomic Percent of Ni) / (Atomic Percent of Ce)\")\n    print(f\"Numbers:  Ratio = {ni_atomic_percent} / {ce_atomic_percent}\")\n\n    # Print the final calculated ratio, rounded to three decimal places for clarity\n    print(f\"\\nThe resulting optimal Ni/Ce atomic ratio is approximately: {ni_ce_atomic_ratio:.3f}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(\"This ratio promotes a high dispersion of active Ni sites on the Ceria support while minimizing particle sintering.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_optimal_ni_ce_ratio()\n```\n<<<0.111>>>"
