    # The two place names mentioned by Father Brown are "Gretna Green" and "Sodom".
    # "Gretna Green" begins with the paired consonants "Gr".
    # "Sodom" begins with "So" (consonant-vowel), meaning there is a slight
    # inaccuracy in the riddle's clue, but these are the correct names from the story.
