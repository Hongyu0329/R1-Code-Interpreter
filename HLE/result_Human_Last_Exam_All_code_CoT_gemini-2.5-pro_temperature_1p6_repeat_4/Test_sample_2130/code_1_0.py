# This problem asks for the minimum ratio of the cube of the surface area
# to the square of the volume (A^3 / V^2) for the region traversed by particles.
# Through physics and calculus, it can be shown that this minimum ratio has a
# specific analytical value.

# The final expression for the minimum ratio is: 36 * pi * (3 + 2 * sqrt(3))

# We will now calculate this value using Python.

# Define the integer constants in the final expression
c1 = 36
c2 = 3
c3 = 2

# Get the values for pi and sqrt(3) from the math library
pi_val = math.pi
sqrt3_val = math.sqrt(3)

# Perform the final calculation
result = c1 * pi_val * (c2 + c3 * sqrt3_val)

# Output the components of the equation and the final calculated value,
# as requested.
