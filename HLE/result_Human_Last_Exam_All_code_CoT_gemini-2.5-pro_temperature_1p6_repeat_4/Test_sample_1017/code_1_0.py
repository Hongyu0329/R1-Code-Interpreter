    Computes the stable commutator length based on the problem description.

    The problem suggests a hidden relationship between the properties of the
    elements g and h and the structure of the group G. The group G is based
    on powers of 2, and the ratio of the "translation" values for h and g
    is 16/2, which is 8, a power of 2.

    This structure points to a formula for scl involving a base-2 logarithm
    of the ratio of these values. The standard scl formula for commutators
    often includes a 1/2 factor, which is adopted here.
    
    The formula is: scl = (1/2) * |log2(val_h) - log2(val_g)|
                      = (1/2) * |log2(val_h / val_g)|
