    "This is a knowledge-based question about ballet technique. I will formulate a plan to determine the most accurate answer by comparing the characteristics of the Vaganova and Balanchine methods for a cambré derrière.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Access knowledge about the Vaganova method's principles for a cambré derrière (back bend). This method emphasizes precision, strength, and harmonious, uninterrupted lines.\n2.  Access knowledge about the Balanchine method's principles for the same step. This method is known for speed, athleticism, and a more \"off-balance\" or extreme aesthetic.\n3.  Compare the key characteristics of each style, focusing on the options provided (arm, hip, speed, backbend degree, head).\n4.  Evaluate each option to determine the most defining and distinct difference.\n5.  The Python code below will simulate this analysis by defining the characteristics of each style and printing a logical conclusion to identify the correct answer choice.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the differences between Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière\n    to determine the most accurate answer from a list of choices.\n    \"\"\"\n    vaganova_style = {\n        'name': 'Vaganova',\n        'head': 'Head follows the arm, maintaining a continuous line.
