# Based on the geometric analysis, the locus C is composed of 6 identical arcs.
# Let's formalize the calculation.

# Number of identical arcs forming the locus C.
num_arcs = 6

# The angle (in radians) subtended by each arc on a circle of radius r.
# This value is derived from the geometry of the unfolded cube.
angle_per_arc_rad = math.pi / 3

# The problem states the side length and distance are 'r'.
# For calculation, 'r' cancels out, but we include it symbolically.

# Step 1: Calculate the total length of the locus C.
# Total Length = num_arcs * (radius * angle_per_arc_rad)
# Total Length = 6 * (r * pi/3) = 2 * pi * r
print("Step 1: Calculate the total length of the locus C.")
print(f"The locus is made of {num_arcs} arcs.")
# The numbers in the equation are 6 (for arcs) and 3 (in pi/3 for angle)
print("The length of each arc is r * (pi / 3).")
print(f"Total length of C = {num_arcs} * (r * pi / 3) = 2*pi*r.")

# Step 2: Divide the length of C by 2*pi*r as requested.
# Ratio = (Total Length of C) / (2 * pi * r)
print("\nStep 2: Normalize the length.")
print("We divide the total length by 2*pi*r.")
print("Ratio = (2*pi*r) / (2*pi*r)")

# The 'r' and 'pi' terms cancel out.
ratio = (2 * math.pi) / (2 * math.pi)
print(f"The calculated ratio is {ratio}.")

# Step 3: Convert the ratio to a whole number percentage.
percentage = int(ratio * 100)
print("\nStep 3: Convert to a whole number percentage.")
print(f"Percentage = {ratio} * 100% = {percentage}%")
