    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Quantum Numbers:** A \"p-electron\" has two key properties. Being a \"p\" particle defines its orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$. Being an \"electron\" defines its spin angular momentum quantum number, $s$.\n    *   For a p-orbital, $l=1$.\n    *   For an electron, $s=1/2$.\n\n2.  **Couple the Angular Momenta:** The total angular momentum, $J$, is the sum of the orbital and spin angular momenta, $J = L + S$. The quantum number for the total angular momentum, $j$, is found by the coupling rule: the possible values for $j$ range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n\n3.  **Determine Eigenvalues of JÂ²:** The eigenvalues of the squared total angular momentum operator, $J^2$, are given by the formula $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$. I will calculate this value for each possible $j$.\n\n4.  **Determine Eigenvalues of Jz:** For each value of $j$, the associated z-component magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take on values from $-j$ to $+j$ in integer steps. The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are then given by $\\hbar m_j$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script to perform these steps. The script will calculate the possible $j$ values based on $l=1$ and $s=1/2$. Then, for each $j$, it will compute and print the corresponding $J^2$ eigenvalue and the set of all possible $J_z$ eigenvalues. To ensure precision and clarity with half-integer values, I will use Python's `fractions` module. The output will explicitly show the formulas and the numbers used in the calculation, as you requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    J is the total angular momentum, where J = L + S.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum quantum number for a 'p' orbital.\n    s = 0.5  # Spin angular momentum quantum number for an electron.\n\n    print(f\"Solving for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\")\n    print(f\"A p-electron has orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {Fraction(s)}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # The rule is |l-s| <= j <= l+s, in integer steps.\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    j_values = np.arange(j_min, j_max + 1, 1.0) # Step is always 1\n    \n    j_frac_values = [Fraction(j).limit_denominator() for j in j_values]\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {', '.join(map(str, j_frac_values))}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, calculate the eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z.\n    for j in j_values:\n        j_frac = Fraction(j).limit_denominator()\n        \n        print(f\"--- For the state with j = {j_frac} ---\")\n        \n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue: hbar^2 * j * (j+1)\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        j_squared_eigenvalue_frac = Fraction(j_squared_eigenvalue).limit_denominator()\n        \n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is calculated as j(j+1)hbar^2.\")\n        print(f\"Result: {j_frac}({j_frac} + 1)hbar^2 = {j_frac}({j_frac + 1})hbar^2 = {j_squared_eigenvalue_frac} hbar^2\")\n        \n        # Calculate J_z eigenvalues: hbar * m_j\n        # where m_j ranges from -j to +j in integer steps.\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1.0)\n        mj_frac_list = [Fraction(mj).limit_denominator() for mj in mj_values]\n        \n        print(f\"The eigenvalues of J_z are calculated as m_j*hbar, where m_j can be {', '.join(map(str, mj_frac_list))}.\")\n        \n        # Create the string for the list of Jz eigenvalues\n        jz_eigenvalues_str = \", \".join([f\"{mj_f} hbar\" for mj_f in mj_frac_list])\n        print(f\"Result: The set of J_z eigenvalues is {{{jz_eigenvalues_str}}}\\n\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<\nFor j = 3/2, the eigenvalue of J^2 is 15/4 hbar^2 and the eigenvalues of J_z are -3/2 hbar, -1/2 hbar, 1/2 hbar, 3/2 hbar.\nFor j = 1/2, the eigenvalue of J^2 is 3/4 hbar^2 and the eigenvalues of J_z are -1/2 hbar, 1/2 hbar.\n>>>"
