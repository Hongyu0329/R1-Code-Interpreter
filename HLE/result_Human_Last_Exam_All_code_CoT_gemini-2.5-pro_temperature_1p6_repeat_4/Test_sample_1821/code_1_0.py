def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function determines the number of cardinalities in the specified interval.

    The problem asks for the number of cardinalities in the interval [|T1|, |T2|],
    where |T1| and |T2| are the minimum and maximum possible number of branches
    for a pruned tree of height omega_2 with all levels having cardinality aleph_0.

    1. The minimal number of branches |T1| is aleph_0. This is because level 0 has
       aleph_0 nodes, and since the tree is pruned, each node must have at least one
       branch passing through it. This minimum is achievable.

    2. The maximal number of branches |T2| is aleph_2. A combinatorial argument
       using the Erdos-Rado theorem shows that if there were more than aleph_2 branches,
       it would imply a level has more than aleph_0 nodes, which is a contradiction.
       This maximum is also known to be achievable.

    3. The interval of cardinalities is therefore [aleph_0, aleph_2]. The distinct
       cardinal numbers in this interval are aleph_0, aleph_1, and aleph_2.

    4. Counting these gives a total of 3 cardinalities.
