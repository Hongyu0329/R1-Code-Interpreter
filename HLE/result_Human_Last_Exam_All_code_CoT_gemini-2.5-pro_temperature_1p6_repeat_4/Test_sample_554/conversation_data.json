    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar, we first need to define a standard structure for a \"nanocar\". Since \"nanocar\" is a general term for a class of molecular machines, I will use a common and representative structure. This structure consists of a chassis made from an oligo(phenylene ethynylene) (OPE) framework and four buckyball (C60 fullerene) wheels.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Define the Nanocar Structure:** I will assume a nanocar with a specific, symmetrical chassis: `2,5-Diethynyl-1,4-bis(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene`. This chassis has four \"axles\" to which wheels can be attached. The wheels will be C60 fullerenes.\n2.  **Count the Hydrogen Atoms:** \"Perfluoro\" means every hydrogen atom (H) is replaced by a fluorine atom (F). Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar will be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar. I will count the hydrogens on each component of the nanocar.\n    *   The central benzene ring of the chassis.\n    *   The ethynyl groups attached directly to the central ring.\n    *   The `para-ethynylphenyl` arms.\n    *   The C60 fullerene wheels.\n3.  **Sum the Hydrogens:** I will sum the hydrogen counts from all components to find the total. This total is the answer.\n4.  **Write a Python Script:** The script will perform this calculation, clearly printing out the number of hydrogens from each part and showing the final sum, which represents the number of fluorine atoms.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_atoms():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n    This calculation is based on a representative nanocar structure consisting of:\n    1.
