    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.

    This calculation is based on a representative nanocar structure consisting of:
    1. A chassis made of 2,5-Diethynyl-1,4-bis(4-ethynylphenyl)benzene.

    "Perfluoro" means all hydrogen (H) atoms are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.
