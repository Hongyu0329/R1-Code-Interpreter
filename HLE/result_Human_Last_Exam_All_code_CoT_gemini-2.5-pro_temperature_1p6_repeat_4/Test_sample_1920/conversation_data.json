    "Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor `d`**: First, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. The properties of the Dirichlet character are closely tied to the prime factors of its conductor.\n2.  **Understand Primitive Characters**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ is called *primitive* if it is not induced by a character of a smaller modulus $d'$ that divides $d$. When the conductor $d$ is a product of distinct primes, $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi \\pmod{d}$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a *non-trivial* character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n3.  **Analyze the Order**: The order of the product character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of the individual characters, i.e., $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given that the order must be 6.\n4.  **Count Component Characters**: For each prime factor $p_i$ of $d$, we need to count the number of available characters $\\chi_i$ whose orders are divisors of 6 (i.e., orders 2, 3, 6), as these are the only orders that can combine to have an lcm of 6. The number of characters modulo a prime $p$ with a specific order $k > 1$ is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $\\phi(p) = p-1$.\n5.  **Combine the Counts**: We will use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. We will first count all possible combinations of non-trivial characters where each component character has an order that divides 6. Then, we will subtract the combinations where the lcm is not 6 (i.e., where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6, such as 2 or 3).\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, explaining each step and performing the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    # Count the number of 2s that divide n\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors[2] = factors.get(2, 0) + 1\n        n = n // 2\n    # n must be odd at this point\n    # so a skip of 2 (i.e. i = 3, 5, 7, ...) is fine\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        while n % i == 0:\n            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1\n            n = n // i\n    # This condition is to handle the case when n is a prime number\n    # greater than 2\n    if n > 2:\n        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    # For a prime number p, phi(p) = p - 1.\n    # For this problem, we only need phi for small numbers,\n    # so a full factorization is not strictly necessary but makes the function general.\n    if n==2: return 1\n    if n==3: return 2\n    if n==6: return 2\n    \n    factors_of_n = prime_factorization(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors_of_n:\n        result = result // p * (p - 1)\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order = 6\n\n    print(f\"Let d = {d}.
