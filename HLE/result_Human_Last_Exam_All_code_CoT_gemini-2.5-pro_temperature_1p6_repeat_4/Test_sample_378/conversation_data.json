    "This question is based on a false premise. The former President of Nigeria is named Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has never publicly identified himself as \"Azikiwe\". That name belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\n\nSince the event never happened, there is no year to return. I will provide a Python script that clarifies this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_record():\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks for the year Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified as Azikiwe.\n  \"\"\"\n  person_in_question = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n  other_figure = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n  \n  print(f\"The public and official name of the former Nigerian President is {person_in_question}.\")\n  print(f\"The surname 'Azikiwe' is associated with {other_figure}, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n  print(\"\\nThere are no public records of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself with the name 'Azikiwe'.\")\n  print(\"Therefore, this event never occurred and there is no year to provide.\")\n\ncheck_name_record()\n```\n<<<There is no record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever publicly identifying himself as Azikiwe. The premise of the question is incorrect.>>>"
