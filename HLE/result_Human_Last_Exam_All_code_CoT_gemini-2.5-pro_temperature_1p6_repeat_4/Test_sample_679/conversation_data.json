    "Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: I will first look at the molecular formula, C7H14. This general formula (CnH2n) indicates one degree of unsaturation, which means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the ¹³C NMR Spectrum**:\n    *   **Chemical Shifts**: I will examine the chemical shifts to identify the types of carbons present. Shifts around 100-150 ppm indicate carbons in a C=C double bond, confirming the presence of an alkene.\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 7 carbons in the formula but only 6 signals in the spectrum. This implies that two carbons in the molecule are chemically equivalent, producing a single overlapping signal.\n    *   **Multiplicities (s, t, d, q)**: The letters indicate the number of attached hydrogens, as would be determined by a DEPT experiment:\n        *   (s) = singlet = quaternary carbon (C, 0 hydrogens)\n        *   (t) = triplet = CH₂ group (2 hydrogens)\n        *   (d) = doublet = CH group (1 hydrogen)\n        *   (q) = quartet = CH₃ group (3 hydrogens)\n    I will use this information to count the number of C, CH, CH₂, and CH₃ groups.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structure**: Based on the fragments identified from the NMR data, I will piece together a molecular structure that is consistent with all the evidence. The presence of a quaternary alkene carbon (s) and a terminal alkene carbon (t) points to a `R₂C=CH₂` structure.\n\n4.  **Verify the Structure and Determine IUPAC Name**: I will verify that the proposed structure matches all the data (molecular formula, chemical shifts, and multiplicities). Specifically, I'll check for the two equivalent carbons suggested by the signal count. Finally, I will determine the correct IUPAC name for the verified structure.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves for the IUPAC name of a hydrocarbon based on its\n    molecular formula and 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given Data\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_shifts = {\n        145: 's', # singlet\n        112: 't', # triplet\n        48: 't',  # triplet\n        27: 'd',  # doublet\n        22: 'q',  # quartet\n        21: 'q'   # quartet\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The formula is {molecular_formula}.
