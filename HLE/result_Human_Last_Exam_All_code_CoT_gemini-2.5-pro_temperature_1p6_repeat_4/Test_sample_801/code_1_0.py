# The question asks to identify the category of Kalabari men associated with the 'etibo' shirt.
# Let's analyze the options based on cultural knowledge of the Kalabari people of Nigeria.

# The 'etibo' is a long, flowing, formal shirt derived from European designs.
# It is a significant part of the male traditional attire in Kalabari culture and the wider Niger Delta region.
# This garment is not for everyday wear but is typically worn on formal occasions, signifying status, maturity, and prestige.

# Let's review the provided choices:
# A. No special category: This is incorrect, as formal attire in this culture is often linked to status.
# B. Amanyanabo (sovereign): While the king would wear it, it is not exclusively for him.
# C. Alabo (chiefs): The 'Alabo' or chieftaincy class are frequently and iconically seen in full 'etibo' regalia (often with a wrapper, a bowler hat, and a walking stick). It is strongly representative of their rank.
# D. Asawo (young men): This attire is generally associated with elders and men of standing, not young men in general.
# E. Opu asawo (gentlemen): This term refers to respected men or elders, who also wear the 'etibo'. However, the 'Alabo' (chiefs) are the most distinct and recognizable group defined by this attire as part of their formal regalia.

# The strongest and most specific association for the 'etibo' as a status symbol is with the chiefs.
