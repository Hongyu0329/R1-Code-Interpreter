Step-by-step derivation:

1.  We analyze the properties required for the topology on the integers, Z.
    *   Totally bounded: This implies that Z is a subgroup of a compact group K.
    *   No nontrivial convergent sequences: Any convergent sequence must be eventually constant.

2.  We consider two cases for any group topology on Z: being Hausdorff or not.

3.  Case 1: The topology is not Hausdorff.
    *   This implies that the closure of {0} is a nontrivial subgroup nZ for some integer n > 0.
    *   The topology is the 'coset topology' based on nZ.
    *   Consider the sequence x_k = k * n. This sequence converges to 0 because every term x_k lies in the basic open neighborhood of 0, which is nZ.
    *   The sequence (x_k) is not eventually constant, so it is a nontrivial convergent sequence.
    *   Thus, no such non-Hausdorff topology satisfies the conditions.

4.  Case 2: The topology is Hausdorff.
    *   In this case, Z is an infinite subgroup of its compact completion K.
    *   As an infinite subset of a compact space, Z must have a limit point p in K.
    *   This means there is a sequence of distinct integers n_k converging to p.
    *   By continuity of subtraction, the sequence of differences m_k = n_{k+1} - n_k must converge to p - p = 0.
    *   The sequence (m_k) is a sequence of non-zero integers, so it is not eventually constant.
    *   Since it converges to 0, it is a nontrivial convergent sequence.
    *   Thus, no such Hausdorff topology satisfies the conditions.

5.  Conclusion:
    In all possible cases, a totally bounded group topology on the integers must contain a nontrivial convergent sequence.
    Therefore, the number of topologies satisfying the given conditions is 0.
