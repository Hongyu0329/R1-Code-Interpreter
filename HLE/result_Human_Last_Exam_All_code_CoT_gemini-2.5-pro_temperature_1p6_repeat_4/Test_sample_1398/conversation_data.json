    "I will determine the transformation rule by observing the example grids. I will then apply this rule to the test grid to generate the final output.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the relationship between the input and output grids. Let's denote the input grid as `I` and the output grid as `O`. I'll examine how the value of a cell `O[r][c]` is determined by the values in the input grid `I`.\n\nAfter trying several simple hypotheses like inverting the values, or rules based on orthogonal neighbors, I've found that they don't hold true for all examples. The transformation seems to depend on a larger context.\n\nLet's test a hypothesis based on the **diagonal neighbors**.\nFor each cell `I[r][c]`, let's find its four diagonal neighbors: `I[r-1][c-1]` (North-West), `I[r-1][c+1]` (North-East), `I[r+1][c-1]` (South-West), and `I[r+1][c+1]` (South-East). For cells on the edge of the grid, any neighbor falling outside the grid boundaries is considered to have a value of 0.\n\nLet `S_diag` be the sum of these four diagonal neighbors.\nI've discovered a two-part rule that appears to hold for the provided examples:\n\n1.  If the value of the input cell `I[r][c]` is `0`, the output cell `O[r][c]` becomes `1`.\n2.  If the value of the input cell `I[r][c]` is `1`, the output `O[r][c]` depends on the parity of `S_diag`. If `S_diag` is even, `O[r][c]` is `1`. If `S_diag` is odd, `O[r][c]` is `0`.\n\nI will now write a Python script to apply this transformation to the test input grid.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the transformation rule to the input grid.\n    The rule is as follows:\n    1. For each cell, find its 4 diagonal neighbors (padding with 0 outside the grid).\n    2. Sum the values of these neighbors to get S_diag.\n    3. If the input cell value is 0, the output cell is 1.\n    4. If the input cell value is 1, the output is 1 if S_diag is even, and 0 if S_diag is odd.\n    \"\"\"\n    grid = [\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    ]\n\n    R, C = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    out_grid = [[0 for _ in range(C)] for _ in range(R)]\n\n    for r in range(R):\n        for c in range(C):\n            s_diag = 0\n            # NW\n            if r > 0 and c > 0: s_diag += grid[r-1][c-1]\n            # NE\n            if r > 0 and c < C - 1: s_diag += grid[r-1][c+1]\n            # SW\n            if r < R - 1 and c > 0: s_diag += grid[r+1][c-1]\n            # SE\n            if r < R - 1 and c < C - 1: s_diag += grid[r+1][c+1]\n\n            if grid[r][c] == 0:\n                out_grid[r][c] = 1\n            else:  # grid[r][c] == 1\n                if s_diag % 2 == 0:\n                    out_grid[r][c] = 1\n                else:\n                    out_grid[r][c] = 0\n\n    # Print the resulting grid as a flat binary string\n    output_string = \"\".join(str(cell) for row in out_grid for cell in row)\n    print(output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<1001101101011101111001001>>>"
