    Analyzes the provided biological text to determine which statement is not true.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Establish facts from the text:
        -   CA (watermelon-adapted) biotype thrives on a high-raffinose diet (sucrose:raffinose 3:8).
        -   MA (cotton-adapted) biotype thrives on a sucrose-only diet.
        -   Raffinose is a Raffinose Family Oligosaccharide (RFO).
        -   Galactosidase is the enzyme that metabolizes raffinose. Its activity is typically induced by the presence of its substrate, raffinose.
    2.  Infer host plant characteristics:
        -   Watermelon is likely rich in raffinose.
        -   Cotton is likely poor in raffinose and rich in sucrose.
    3.  Evaluate each statement:
    """

    # Statement A: CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.
    # Reasoning: CA thrives on a raffinose-rich diet while MA thrives on a sucrose-only diet.
    # This strongly implies CA is better adapted to metabolize RFOs like raffinose.
    statement_A_is_true = True

    # Statement B: CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.
    # Reasoning: This is directly stated in the text. CA "did well on the artificial diet with sucrose: raffinose (3:8)"
    # and MA "did well on the artificial diet with only sucrose."
    statement_B_is_true = True

    # Statement C: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.
    # Reasoning: CA is transferred from watermelon (high raffinose) to cotton (inferred low raffinose).
    # With less raffinose substrate, the aphid would produce less galactosidase enzyme. The reason given (lower raffinose) is the direct cause.
    statement_C_is_true = True

    # Statement D: Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.
    # Reasoning: CA is transferred to cotton, and its galactosidase activity would decrease (consistent with C).
    # However, the reason given is "higher glucose levels in cotton". The direct cause for a change in GALACTOSIDASE activity is the level of its substrate, RAFFINOSE.
    # The text provides no information about glucose levels, making this an unsupported and less direct causal explanation. This statement is therefore suspect.
    statement_D_is_true = False

    # Statement E: Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.
    # Reasoning: MA is transferred from cotton (low raffinose) to watermelon (inferred high raffinose).
    # Exposure to a new, abundant substrate (raffinose) would induce increased production of the necessary enzyme (galactosidase).
    statement_E_is_true = True

    # Find the statement that is not true.
