    # Explain the core CARS process
    print("\nStep 1: Understand the basic CARS process.")
    print("Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) is a nonlinear optical technique.")
    print("It uses pump (ω_p) and Stokes (ω_s) beams to coherently excite molecular vibrations.")
    print("A probe beam (ω_pr) then scatters off these vibrations to generate a signal at the blue-shifted anti-Stokes frequency (ω_as).")
    print("The key for signal generation is that the frequency difference ω_p - ω_s matches a molecular vibrational frequency Ω.")
    print("The output signal is an anti-Stokes beam: ω_as = ω_p - ω_s + ω_pr.")

    # Explain the effect of a broadband beam
    print("\nStep 2: Consider the effect of a broadband pump beam.")
    print("In broadband CARS, one of the excitation beams is spectrally broad to cover many frequencies at once.")
    print("If the pump beam (ω_p) is broadband, a single narrowband Stokes beam (ω_s) can simultaneously excite a wide range of vibrational frequencies (Ω = ω_p - ω_s).")

    # Explain the nature of the output signal
    print("\nStep 3: Analyze the resulting anti-Stokes signal.")
    print("Since a wide range of vibrations are excited, the resulting anti-Stokes signal (ω_as) is also broadband.")
    print("This broadband signal is not just a blur; it's a multiplexed signal containing information from all the excited vibrations.")
    print("By using a spectrometer to disperse this broadband anti-Stokes beam, we can measure the intensity at each frequency.")
    print("Each frequency in the anti-Stokes signal corresponds to a specific vibrational mode that was excited in the sample.")

    # Evaluate the choices
    print("\nStep 4: Evaluate the options.")
    print("A: Incorrect. CARS fundamentally generates an anti-Stokes beam.")
    print("B: Incorrect. The broadband anti-Stokes beam explicitly contains separate vibrational information that can be read out with a spectrometer.")
    print("C: Correct. A broadband anti-Stokes beam is generated, and it contains distinguishable vibrational information corresponding to a Raman spectrum.")
    print("E: Incorrect. An anti-Stokes beam is always generated in a CARS process.")

    correct_choice = "C"
