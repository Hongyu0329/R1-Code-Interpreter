    "Of course. Here is a Python script that determines the product of the specified Wittig reaction.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: The reactants are pivalaldehyde ((CH₃)₃C-CHO) and the phosphonium ylide, (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane ( (2-Cl-C₆H₄)-CH₂-CH=P(C₆H₅)₃ ).\n2.  **Recall the Wittig Reaction**: This reaction combines an aldehyde/ketone with a ylide to form an alkene and triphenylphosphine oxide. The carbonyl oxygen is swapped with the ylide's carbon group.\n3.  **Form the Product Backbone**: The new double bond will form between the carbonyl carbon of pivalaldehyde and the ylide carbon. This results in the structure (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂(2-Cl-C₆H₄).\n4.  **Determine Stereochemistry**: The ylide has an alkyl substituent, which makes it an \"unstabilized\" ylide. Wittig reactions involving unstabilized ylides typically yield the (Z)-alkene (cis) as the major product.\n5.  **Name the Product**: Following IUPAC nomenclature, the main chain is a pentene. The full name, including stereochemistry and positions of all substituents, is (Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: The Python script will print the reactants, the reaction type, and derive the final product, presenting the result as a chemical equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the product of a Wittig reaction between\n    pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
