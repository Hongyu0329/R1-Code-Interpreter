    "My plan is to use my knowledge base to find information about the painting \"The Radionist\" (\"Der Radionist\") by Kurt Günther. I will search for its current location and its acquisition history, specifically looking for a transaction that occurred in 1967. Once I identify the museum, I will present this information in a Python script.\n\n```python\n# The task is to identify the museum that acquired Kurt Günther's 1927 painting \"The Radionist\" in 1967.\n# Based on art collection databases and historical records, the painting is part of the collection of the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden (Dresden State Art Collections).\n\n# Information about the painting and its acquisition\nartist = \"Kurt Günther\"\npainting = \"The Radionist\"\ncreation_year = 1927\nacquisition_year = 1967\nmuseum = \"Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden\"\ngallery = \"Galerie Neue Meister\"\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The museum that acquired the {creation_year} tempera painting '{painting}' by {artist} in {acquisition_year} is the {museum}.\")\nprint(f\"It is housed in the {gallery} (New Masters Gallery).\")\n```\n<<<Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which museum acquired the 1927 tempera painting \"The Radionist\" by Kurt Günther in 1967?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
