    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the largest prime divisor of 8139881:\n\n1.  **Define a Function:** I'll create a Python function to find all prime factors of a given number.\n2.  **Trial Division:** The function will use trial division to find the factors.\n3.  **Handle Factor 2:** First, I'll check for divisibility by 2 and divide the number by 2 until it's odd.\n4.  **Iterate Odd Numbers:** Next, I'll iterate through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, ...) up to the square root of the remaining number. For each odd number that is a divisor, I'll add it to a list of factors and update the number.\n5.  **Final Prime Factor:** After the loop, if the number is still greater than 2, it means the remaining number is itself a prime factor (this handles cases where the number is prime or has a large prime factor).\n6.  **Format Output:** As requested, I'll print the factorization equation showing all the prime factors. Then, I'll find the maximum value from the list of factors and print it as the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime factors of a number, prints the factorization,\n    and returns the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_num = num\n    factors = []\n    \n    # Handle the factor 2\n    while num % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        num = num // 2\n        \n    # Handle odd factors\n    # Iterate from 3 up to the square root of the remaining number\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):\n        while num % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            num = num // i\n            \n    # If the remaining number is a prime greater than 2\n    if num > 2:\n        factors.append(num)\n        \n    # Print the result based on the factors found\n    if not factors:\n        print(f\"1 has no prime factors.\")\n        return\n        \n    if len(factors) == 1:\n        # This means the original number is prime\n        print(f\"{original_num} is a prime number.\")\n        largest_prime = factors[0]\n    else:\n        # This means the original number is composite\n        # Format the equation string: 8139881 = p1 * p2 * ...\n        equation = f\"{original_num} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}\"\n        print(equation)\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"The largest prime divisor is: {largest_prime}\")\n\n# The number provided by the user\nnumber_to_analyze = 8139881\nfind_largest_prime_divisor(number_to_analyze)\n```\n<<<8139881>>>"
