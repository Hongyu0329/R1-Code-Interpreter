    "To answer your question, I will identify the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the June 1940 armistice and present the details using a Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Research historical records of French maritime losses during the early phase of World War II (before the armistice on June 22, 1940).\n2.  Filter this list to include only ships sunk by German U-boats (including mines laid by them).\n3.  For each of these ships, find its displacement, typically measured in Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) for civilian vessels.\n4.  Compare the displacements to identify the largest ship.\n5.  Based on my research, the passenger liner **Champlain** was the largest such vessel, with a displacement of **28,124 GRT**. It was sunk on June 17, 1940, after hitting a mine laid by the U-boat U-65.\n6.  The following Python code will print out the details of this finding.\n\n```python\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the largest French ship\n    sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    ship_name = \"Champlain\"\n    # Gross Register Tonnage (GRT) is a measure of a ship's internal volume.\n    # Standard displacement for warships is measured differently (in tons of water displaced).\n    # For a passenger liner like the Champlain, GRT is the standard measure of size.\n    displacement = 28124\n    unit = \"GRT (Gross Register Tonnage)\"\n    cause = \"a mine laid by the German submarine U-65\"\n    date_sunk = \"June 17, 1940\"\n\n    print(\"Identifying the largest French ship by displacement sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(f\"The ship was the passenger liner '{ship_name}'.\")\n    print(f\"Its displacement was {displacement} {unit}.\")\n    print(f\"It was sunk on {date_sunk} after striking {cause}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n    print(\"Final answer:\")\n    print(f\"Ship Name: {ship_name}\")\n    print(f\"Displacement: {displacement} {unit}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<Champlain>>>"
