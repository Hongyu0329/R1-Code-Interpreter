The question asks for an inherent limitation of studying nucleic acid thermodynamics using bulk melting experiments, a limitation that exists even under ideal conditions.

1.  **Analyze the method:** A "bulk" experiment measures the average properties of a massive population of molecules in a solution. It yields a single melting curve representing the ensemble average of all molecules.

2.  **Evaluate the options:**
    *   **A & B (Model assumptions):** The assumptions that heat capacity change is zero (Î”Cp=0) or that enthalpy/entropy parameters are temperature-independent are features of the *mathematical model* used to interpret the data, not limitations of the *experimental technique* itself. More complex models can be applied to the same bulk data.
    *   **D & E (Instrumental limitations):** Poor temperature control or large oscillations are issues with the experimental setup (instrumentation), not the fundamental principle. The prompt asks us to consider "ideal experimental conditions," which would eliminate these problems.
    *   **C (Heterogeneity):** In a real sample, not all molecules behave identically at a given temperature. Some might be fully double-stranded, some might have partially melted regions (bubbles), and others might have frayed ends. A bulk experiment averages over all these different states, showing a smooth transition. It is fundamentally impossible for such an experiment to distinguish between these individual states or "capture the heterogeneity" of the population. This is an intrinsic limitation of measuring an ensemble average. Single-molecule techniques were developed precisely to overcome this problem by observing one molecule at a time.

Therefore, the inability to capture molecular heterogeneity is the correct inherent limitation.
