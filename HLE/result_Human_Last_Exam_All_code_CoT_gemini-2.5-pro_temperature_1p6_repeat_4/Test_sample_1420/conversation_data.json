    "Of course. The scaling exponent α for specific heat can be calculated using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a cornerstone of the renormalization group approach to critical phenomena.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Concepts:** The problem involves the specific heat exponent `α`, the spatial dimension `d=3`, and the `ϵ` expansion. The `ϵ` expansion is a perturbative method performed around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`.\n2.  **Establish Model Parameters:** For many common systems like the Ising model, the upper critical dimension is `d_c = 4`. The `ϵ` parameter is defined as `ϵ = d_c - d`. The theory also depends on the number of spin components, `n`. We will assume the most common case, the Ising model universality class, where `n=1`.\n3.  **State the Formula:** The first-order `ϵ` expansion for the exponent `α` in the O(n) model is given by the formula:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Execute the Calculation:** I will write a Python script to substitute the values (`d=3`, `d_c=4`, `n=1`) into the formulas and calculate the final result for `α`, printing out each step of the calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the epsilon expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the parameters based on the problem\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension for the O(n) model\n    n = 1  # Number of spin components (Ising model universality class)\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the specific heat exponent alpha (α).\")\n    print(\"Method: First-order epsilon (ϵ) expansion for the O(n) model.\\n\")\n    print(f\"Given parameters:\")\n    print(f\"  - Spatial dimension, d = {d}\")\n    print(f\"  - Upper critical dimension, d_c = {d_c}\")\n    print(f\"  - Number of spin components, n = {n} (assuming Ising model)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate epsilon (ϵ)\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the expansion parameter ϵ.\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = d_c - d\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Apply the formula for α\n    # The formula is α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n    # Using SymPy for a precise fractional representation\n    n_sym = sympy.S(n)\n    epsilon_sym = sympy.S(epsilon)\n    \n    numerator_expr = 4 - n_sym\n    denominator_expr = 2 * (n_sym + 8)\n    \n    alpha_expr = (numerator_expr / denominator_expr) * epsilon_sym\n\n    numerator_val = 4 - n\n    denominator_val = 2 * (n + 8)\n    \n    print(\"Step 2: Use the formula α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ.\")\n    print(\"Substituting the values:\\n\")\n    print(f\"α = (4 - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + 8)) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator_val} / (2 * {n + 8}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator_val} / {denominator_val} * {epsilon}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Compute the final result\n    alpha_fraction = sympy.simplify(alpha_expr)\n    alpha_decimal = float(alpha_fraction)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the final value.\")\n    print(f\"The result for α as a fraction is: {alpha_fraction}\")\n    print(f\"The result for α as a decimal is approximately: {alpha_decimal:.4f}\\n\")\n    print(\"This value is the first-order approximation in the epsilon expansion.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
