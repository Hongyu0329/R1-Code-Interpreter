    "To find the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling `u*` in the `ϕ⁴` theory near four dimensions, we will follow these steps based on the Renormalization Group (RG) analysis:\n\n1.  **Start with the RG beta function:** For the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ε` dimensions, the one-loop beta function for the dimensionless coupling `u` describes how the coupling evolves with the energy scale. This function is `β(u) = -εu + (3u²) / (16π²)`.\n2.  **Apply the fixed point condition:** A fixed point, `u*`, is a value of the coupling that does not change under the RG flow. This means the beta function must be zero at this point: `β(u*) = 0`.\n3.  **Solve for the fixed point:** We will solve the equation `β(u*) = 0` for `u*`. This equation has a trivial solution (`u* = 0`, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial one (`u* ≠ 0`), which is known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point. We are interested in this non-trivial solution.\n4.  **Present the result:** The solution for `u*` will be the leading order expression in terms of `ε`. The following Python script will print out the step-by-step derivation and the final expression, highlighting each numerical component as requested.\n\n```python\ndef display_fixed_point_derivation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Displays the derivation of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling\n    and prints its leading order expression.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define constants and symbols for the equations\n    numerator_coeff = 16\n    denominator_coeff = 3\n    pi_symbol = \"π\"\n    coupling_symbol = \"u\"\n    fixed_point_coupling_symbol = \"u*\"\n    epsilon_symbol = \"ε\"\n\n    print(\"Derivation of the Wilson-Fisher Fixed Point in ϕ⁴ Theory:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Step 1: State the beta function\n    print(f\"1.
