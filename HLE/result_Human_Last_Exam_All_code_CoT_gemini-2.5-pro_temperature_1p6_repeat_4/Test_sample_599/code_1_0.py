# The problem is to find the 50th segmented number.
# As derived in the thinking process, the segmented numbers are the powers of 2,
# starting with 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, and so on.
# The n-th segmented number is given by the formula 2^(n-1).
# For the 50th element, we need to calculate 2^(50-1), which is 2^49.

# Define the base and the exponent for the calculation.
base = 2
exponent = 49

# Calculate the result. Python handles large integers automatically.
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final equation and its result.
print(f"The 50th segmented number is calculated as {base}^{exponent}.")
print(f"Result: {result}")
