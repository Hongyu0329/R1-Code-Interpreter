# Step 1: Calculate the number of arrangements for the large package (N_large).
# There are 9 distinct red candles for 9 horizontal positions (9! arrangements).
# There are 9 distinct green candles for 9 vertical positions (9! arrangements).
# The total number of arrangements is the product of these two independent permutations.
num_candles_per_color_large = 9
n_large = math.factorial(num_candles_per_color_large) * math.factorial(num_candles_per_color_large)

# Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements for the small package (N_small).
# There are 8 red + 8 green = 16 distinct candles in total.
# All 16 candles are placed in 16 available horizontal positions.
# The total number of arrangements is the permutation of 16 distinct items (16!).
num_candles_total_small = 16
n_small = math.factorial(num_candles_total_small)

# Step 3: Define the target ratio from the user's question.
target_ratio = 1260

# Step 4: Formulate the equation and check if the statement is true.
# The statement is "N_small = 1260 * N_large", which is equivalent to "N_small / N_large = 1260".
actual_ratio = n_small / n_large
is_statement_true = (actual_ratio == target_ratio)
