def solve_max_n(k):
    """
    This function calculates the maximum value of n in terms of k based on the analysis.
    The formula is n = k^2 - k + 1.

    The problem asks for the maximum value of n such that there exists a k-uniform intersecting family F
    with full differences of size k-1.

    Let's analyze the conditions:
    1. F is a k-uniform intersecting family. For any F1, F2 in F, F1 intersect F2 is not empty.
    2. "Full differences of size k-1" means for any subset D of [n] with size k-1,
       there exist F1, F2 in F such that D = F1 \\ F2.
    3. The size of the difference |F1 \\ F2| = |F1| - |F1 intersect F2| = k - |F1 intersect F2|.
    4. For the difference to have size k-1, the intersection |F1 intersect F2| must be 1.
    5. Let F1 intersect F2 = {x}. Then F1 must be D union {x}. So x cannot be in D.
    
    This problem is related to the existence of certain combinatorial designs.
    A projective plane of order q=k-1 has n = q^2 + q + 1 points and a family of k-subsets (lines)
    where any two subsets intersect in exactly one point.
    If we set q = k-1, we get n = (k-1)^2 + (k-1) + 1 = k^2 - 2k + 1 + k - 1 + 1 = k^2 - k + 1.
    This structure provides a family where any two sets intersect in exactly one point.
    This works for k=3 (the Fano plane), leading to n=7.

    It can be shown that if n > k^2 - k + 1, no such family exists. This provides the upper bound.
    We will assume this value is the maximum for all k.
