    """
    This function identifies the correct statements about the Duke of Wellington's career.

    The problem requires identifying all accurate statements from a list of ten regarding the impact
    of Wellington's military innovations in India on later British practices.

    Analysis of each option:
    1. Correct. Wellington's Indian logistical experience was crucial for his successful commissariat system in the Peninsular War.
    2. Incorrect. His intelligence systems were famously and successfully adapted for the Peninsular War in Europe.
    3. Incorrect. The British Army did not undergo such immediate, sweeping standardization in 1815. Major reforms came much later.
    4. Incorrect. Sandhurst was founded in 1802, not 1829. The premise is factually wrong.
    5. Incorrect. This contradicts statement 1 and historical consensus; the logistical lessons were highly relevant.
    6. Correct. Integrating local forces was a key method honed in India that became standard British colonial practice.
    7. Incorrect. This is the opposite of reality; his Indian experience was a primary influence on his Peninsular logistics.
    8. Correct. The concept of fast-moving, independent "flying columns" from India was adapted for use in the Peninsula and later conflicts like the First Anglo-Burmese War.
    9. Incorrect. The 1813 Charter Act was driven by economic and political factors, not Wellington's military organization principles.
    10. Incorrect. His methods of civilian administration in wartime were developed in India and applied directly in the Peninsula.

    The correct options are 1, 6, and 8.
