    "My plan is to determine the oligomeric state by first identifying the heptad repeat pattern (`abcdefg`) in the given protein sequence. The most stable arrangement will be the one that places the most hydrophobic amino acids at the core positions, `a` and `d`. Once the pattern is established, I will analyze the specific amino acids at each position. The final oligomeric state will be predicted based on the principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing, paying special attention to the size of the core residues and any unusual residues that might favor a specific oligomeric state over others.\n\nSpecifically, I will look for:\n1.  **Core Residues (`a`, `d`):** The identity of these residues is the primary determinant. Patterns like `a=I, d=I` favor trimers, while `a=L, d=I` favor tetramers. A mix of standard hydrophobics like Ala and Leu without a specific pattern often suggests a dimer.\n2.  **Bulky/Unusual Residues:** A very large residue like Tryptophan (`W`) in the core can force a higher-order state (trimer or tetramer) to create space. If `W` is located at a non-core position, it might signal a specific interaction that stabilizes a particular oligomer.\n3.  **Inter-helical Interactions (`e`, `g`):** Charged residues at these positions can form salt bridges. We will check for patterns that might stabilize a specific geometry, like the `W-K` cation-pi interaction which is known to stabilize tetramers.\n\nI will write a Python script to perform this analysis on the sequence and print the reasoning.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef analyze_coiled_coil(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The most likely heptad repeat frame is the one that maximizes hydrophobicity\n    # in the 'a' and 'd' core positions.
