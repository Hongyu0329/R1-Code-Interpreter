    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to handle a very large number. Standard calculators or floating-point data types in most programming languages cannot handle this calculation directly due to a loss of precision.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Leverage Periodicity**: The tangent function is periodic with a period of π. This means that `tan(x) = tan(x + k*π)` for any integer `k`. Therefore, `tan(10^100)` is equal to `tan(10^100 mod π)`. The problem is reduced to finding the remainder of `10^100` when divided by `π`.\n2.  **High-Precision Arithmetic**: To calculate `10^100 mod π` accurately, we need to use a high-precision arithmetic library. The number `10^100` has 101 digits. To get an accurate remainder, our value of `π` must have a precision of at least 101 decimal places plus the desired precision for the final result. Python's built-in `decimal` module is perfect for this.\n3.  **Calculation Steps**:\n    *   I will set the precision of the `decimal` module to a value high enough (e.g., 120 digits) to ensure accuracy.\n    *   I will calculate a high-precision value of `π` using the `decimal` module itself (via `4 * atan(1)`).\n    *   I will then compute the remainder `10^100 % π`. The `%` operator in the `decimal` module correctly computes `x - floor(x/y) * y`, which is the mathematical remainder we need.\n    *   Finally, I will calculate the tangent of this remainder. The `decimal` module has its own `tan()` function for this.\n4.  **Extracting the Digits**: Once I have the final value, I will convert it to a string and extract the first three digits immediately following the decimal point.\n\nThis approach bypasses the precision issues of standard floating-point numbers and allows for an accurate calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom decimal import Decimal, getcontext\n\ndef solve_tan_large_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100)\n    using high-precision arithmetic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The argument 10^100 has 101 digits.
