    "My plan is to simulate each of the three Turing Machines starting from an empty tape (all '0's) and count the number of steps each one takes until it reaches the 'H' (Halt) state.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Represent the Turing Machines**: I will represent the rules of each Turing Machine in a data structure that is easy to access. A dictionary is ideal, where keys are the current state and the symbol read from the tape (e.g., `rules[state][symbol]`).\n2.  **Represent the Tape**: The tape is infinite in both directions. A Python `collections.defaultdict` with a default value of '0' is a perfect way to model this. It will automatically provide a '0' for any cell that has not been written to.\n3.  **Simulation Loop**: For each machine, I will start in state 'A' at position 0 on the tape. I'll run a loop that continues as long as the current state is not 'H'. In each step of the loop, I will:\n    a.  Read the symbol at the current head position.\n    b.  Look up the corresponding rule to get the new state, the symbol to write, and the direction to move.\n    c.  Update the tape with the new symbol.\n    d.  Update the state.\n    e.  Move the tape head left or right.\n    f.  Increment a step counter.\n4.  **Halt Condition**: The simulation for a machine stops when it enters the 'H' state. I will also include a maximum step limit to prevent the simulation from running forever if a machine does not halt.\n5.  **Compare Results**: After running the simulation for all three machines, I will compare their final step counts.\n6.  **Final Output**: I will print the number of the machine that took the most steps and the total count of those steps.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef solve_turing_machine_race():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates three 5-state, 2-symbol Turing Machines to find which one\n    halts after the most steps when starting on an empty tape.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The rule strings for the three Turing Machines provided by the user.\n    # The states are A, B, C, D, E.
