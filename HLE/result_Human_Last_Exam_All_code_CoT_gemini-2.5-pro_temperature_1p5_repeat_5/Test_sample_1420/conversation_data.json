    "To determine the scaling exponent α for the specific heat in a d=3 system, we will use the epsilon (ϵ) expansion, a standard technique in renormalization group theory. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the theoretical framework**: We will use the result from the O(n) vector model, which is a general model for continuous phase transitions.\n2.  **Determine the upper critical dimension (d_c)**: For the O(n) model, the upper critical dimension, above which mean-field theory is exact, is `d_c = 4`.\n3.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ)**: Epsilon is defined as the deviation from the upper critical dimension, `ϵ = d_c - d`. Given the spatial dimension `d = 3`, we get `ϵ = 4 - 3 = 1`.\n4.  **Use the ϵ-expansion formula for α**: To first order in ϵ, the specific heat exponent α is given by the formula: `α = (4 - n) * ϵ / (2 * (n + 8))`.\n5.  **Specify the number of spin components (n)**: Since the problem does not specify the universality class (e.g., Ising, XY, Heisenberg), we will assume the simplest and most common case: the Ising model. In the Ising model, the order parameter has a single component, so `n = 1`.\n6.  **Calculate the final value**: We will substitute `n = 1` and `ϵ = 1` into the formula to find the value of α.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the steps.\n\n```python\n# Parameters for the calculation\nn = 1      # Number of spin components for the Ising model\nd = 3      # Spatial dimension\nd_c = 4    # Upper critical dimension\n\n# Calculate epsilon\nepsilon = d_c - d\n\n# The formula for the specific heat exponent alpha to first order in epsilon is:\n# alpha = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * epsilon\n\n# Perform the calculation\nnumerator = 4 - n\ndenominator_factor_1 = 2\ndenominator_factor_2 = n + 8\nalpha = (numerator / (denominator_factor_1 * denominator_factor_2)) * epsilon\n\nprint(\"Calculation of the specific heat exponent α:\")\nprint(f\"Using n={n} (Ising model), d={d}, d_c={d_c}, which gives epsilon = {epsilon}\")\nprint(\"\\nFormula: α = (4 - n) * ε / (2 * (n + 8))\")\nprint(\"Substituting the values:\")\nprint(f\"α = (4 - {n}) * {epsilon} / (2 * ({n} + 8))\")\nprint(f\"α = ({numerator}) * {epsilon} / (2 * ({denominator_factor_2}))\")\nprint(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator_factor_1 * denominator_factor_2}\")\nprint(f\"α ≈ {alpha:.4f}\")\n\n```\n<<<0.1667>>>"
