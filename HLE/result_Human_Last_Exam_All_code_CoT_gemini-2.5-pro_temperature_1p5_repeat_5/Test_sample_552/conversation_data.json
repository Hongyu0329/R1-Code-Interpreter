    "To answer the user's question, I will perform the following steps:\n1.  First, I need to identify the specific 1905 paper being referenced. This is \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n2.  Next, I will find the citations or references within that paper or in historical analyses of it.\n3.  Historical sources confirm that Albert Einstein's work on statistical mechanics, which formed the basis of this paper, was deeply influenced by Ludwig Boltzmann.\n4.  Specifically, Einstein studied and cited Boltzmann's published work, \"Lectures on Gas Theory\" (*Vorlesungen über Gastheorie*).\n5.  I will then write a Python script that stores this information and prints it in a clear, readable sentence to answer the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_cited_lectures():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the scientist whose lectures\n    Albert Einstein cited in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Based on historical analysis of Einstein's 1905 Annalen der Physik paper\n    # on Brownian motion, the work he cited was foundational to statistical mechanics.\n    scientist_name = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n    \n    # The specific work was Boltzmann's \"Lectures on Gas Theory\".\n    # The code will print this information in a full sentence.\n    \n    print(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of {scientist_name}.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer.\nfind_cited_lectures()\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
