    "To find the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(4, 997), we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Involutions in PSU(n, q) to Elements in SU(n, q):**\n    The group PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient group SU(n, q) / Z, where Z is the center of the Special Unitary group SU(n, q). An element `x` in PSU(n, q) is an involution if `x` is not the identity and `x^2 = 1`. If we represent `x` by a coset `gZ` (where `g` is in SU(n, q)), the condition `x^2 = 1` translates to `(gZ)^2 = Z`, which means `g^2` must be an element of the center, `Z`. The condition that `x` is not the identity means `g` is not in `Z`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Center of SU(4, 997):**\n    The center `Z` of SU(n, q) consists of scalar matrices `cI` such that `c` is in the field `GF(q^2)`, `c^n = 1`, and `c^(q+1) = 1`. The order of the center is `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\n    For our case, n = 4 and q = 997.\n    *   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n    *   `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n    So, the center `Z` has 2 elements. Since we are in a field of characteristic not equal to 2, these elements are `I` (the identity matrix) and `-I`.\n\n3.  **Count Elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2` is in Z:**\n    We need to find the number of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\n    *   **Case 1: `g^2 = -I`**\n        An element `g` in the general unitary group U(n, q) must have eigenvalues `λ` that satisfy the condition `λ^(q+1) = 1`. If `g^2 = -I`, its eigenvalues must satisfy `λ^2 = -1`.\n        For q = 997, `q+1 = 998`. The condition becomes `λ^998 = 1`.\n        However, if `λ^2 = -1`, then `λ^998 = (λ^2)^499 = (-1)^499 = -1`.\n        This leads to the contradiction `-1 = 1`. Therefore, there are no elements in U(4, 997), and thus no elements in SU(4, 997), such that `g^2 = -I`.\n\n    *   **Case 2: `g^2 = I`**\n        These elements are the identity `I` and the involutions within SU(4, 997). Involutions in SU(4, 997) must have eigenvalues from `{+1, -1}`. Since the determinant must be 1, the number of `-1` eigenvalues (`r`) must be even. The possible values for `r` are 2 and 4.\n        *   `r=4`: The element is `-I`. This is the central involution. There is only 1 such element.\n        *   `r=2`: These elements form a single conjugacy class. The number of such elements is given by the formula `q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`.\n\n    So, the total count of elements `g` in SU(4, 997) with `g^2 \\in Z` is the sum from these cases:\n    *   Number of elements = `1` (for `I`) `+ 1` (for `-I`) `+ q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1)` (for `r=2` involutions).\n    Let `K` be this set of elements. `|K| = q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 2`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Involutions in PSU(4, 997):**\n    The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the number of non-identity cosets `gZ` such that `g^2 \\in Z`. This count is `(|K| - |Z|) / |Z|`.\n    *   Number of involutions = `( (q^4(q^2+1)(q^2-q+1) + 2) - 2 ) / 2`\n    *   Number of involutions = `(q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2`.\n\nThe following Python code will compute this value.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n    \"\"\"\n    q = 997\n\n    # The formula for the number of involutions is (q**4 * (q**2 + 1) * (q**2 - q + 1)) / 2\n    term1 = q**4\n    term2 = q**2 + 1\n    term3 = q**2 - q + 1\n    \n    result = (term1 * term2 * term3) // 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"The number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is given by the formula:\")\n    print(\"(q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)) / 2, where q = 997.\\n\")\n    print(\"Step-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(f\"q = {q}\")\n    print(f\"q^2 = {q**2}\")\n    print(f\"q^4 = {term1}\")\n    print(f\"q^2 + 1 = {term2}\")\n    print(f\"q^2 - q + 1 = {term3}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The full equation is:\")\n    print(f\"({term1} * {term2} * {term3}) / 2\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Final result:\")\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<487103289050893345470>>>"
