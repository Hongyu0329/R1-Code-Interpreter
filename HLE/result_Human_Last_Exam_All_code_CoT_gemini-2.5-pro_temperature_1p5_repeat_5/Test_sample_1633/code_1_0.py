    This function explains the reasoning behind choosing option H.

    # 1. Strategy: Create hubs for short paths
    # To get L ~ log(log(n)), we need an efficient routing backbone. This can be
    # achieved by creating hub nodes with degrees close to the maximum allowed.
    # The total degree of the graph must remain constant (sum of degrees = 6n).
    # So, for some nodes to become hubs (degree > 6), other nodes must
    # decrease their degree (degree < 6).

    # 2. Degree Balancing Calculation
    # Let's estimate the number of hubs needed. To be easily reachable from anywhere,
    # a reasonable number of hubs is N_h = n / log(n).
    # These N_h hubs will have their degree increase from 6 to log(n).
    # Total degree increase = N_h * (log(n) - 6) ~= (n/log(n)) * log(n) = n.
    
    # This 'n' amount of degree must be "donated" by other nodes.
    # The most efficient way for nodes to donate degree is to drop from 6 to the
    # minimum allowed degree, which is 3. The drop is 3 per node.
    # Number of donor nodes (N_l) needed: N_l * 3 = n => N_l = n/3.
    
    # 3. Required Edge Removals
    # To reduce the degree of n/3 nodes by 3 each, a total of (n/3) * 3 = n
    # connections (edge ends) must be removed from them.
    # Since each edge has two ends, this corresponds to the removal of n/2 edges.
    
    # 4. Impact on the Lattice Structure
    # These n/2 edges are removed from the n/3 donor nodes.
    # The initial graph is a Watts-Strogatz model with rewiring beta=0.2. This means
    # 80% of the edges are part of the original "lattice structure".
    # Therefore, the donor nodes primarily have lattice edges. Removing n/2 edges
    # from them means the vast majority of these removals will be lattice edges.
    # Estimated lattice edge removals ~= 0.80 * (n/2) = 0.4n = 2n/5.
    
    # 5. Conclusion
    # The number of required lattice edge removals is ~2n/5.
    # Option H states that AT LEAST n/6 edge removals from the lattice are required.
    # Our derived value of 2n/5 is greater than n/6.
    # 2/5 is 0.4, while 1/6 is ~0.167. The condition holds.
