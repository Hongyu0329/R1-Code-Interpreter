This is the fundamental measurement from which all Heart Rate Variability (HRV) metrics are calculated.\n\nThis value is most commonly called the **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** or, more specifically in clinical contexts using an ECG, the **R-R interval**.\n\nHere is a simple python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef get_hrv_value_name():\n  \"\"\"\n  Explains and prints the name of the value used to compute HRV.\n  \"\"\"\n  # The value computed between heartbeats for HRV analysis has a specific name.\n  # This value represents the time interval between successive heartbeats.\n  answer = \"The value computed between heartbeats to determine HRV is called the Inter-Beat Interval (IBI) or R-R interval.\"\n  print(answer)\n\nget_hrv_value_name()\n```\n<<<Inter-Beat Interval>>>"
