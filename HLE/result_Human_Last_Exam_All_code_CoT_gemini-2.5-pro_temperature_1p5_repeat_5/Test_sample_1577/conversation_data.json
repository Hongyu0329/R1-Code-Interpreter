    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The user wants to know the ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code on a surface with `n` smooth holes and `m` rough holes. The answer should be a formula selected from the given choices, and I need to provide a Python or shell script that represents this solution.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Physics Problem:**\n    *   The Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of logical qubits.\n    *   The number of logical qubits depends on the topology of the surface where the code is defined. This includes its genus (`g`) and the number and type of its boundaries (holes).\n    *   When the genus is not specified, it's standard to assume the simplest case: a sphere, which has genus `g=0`. The \"holes\" are then treated as punctures on this sphere.\n\n3.  **Understand the Boundary/Hole Types:**\n    *   **Smooth hole:** This is a boundary where electric charges (`e`-particles) are condensed. This means magnetic flux (`m`-particles) can terminate or be created there. Therefore, a smooth hole acts as a \"magnetic\" defect.\n    *   **Rough hole:** This is a boundary where magnetic fluxes (`m`-particles) are condensed. This means electric charges (`e`-particles) can terminate or be created there. A rough hole acts as an \"electric\" defect.\n    *   So, the problem is equivalent to finding the GSD of a toric code on a sphere with `n` magnetic defects and `m` electric defects.\n\n4.  **Determine the Number of Logical Qubits (`k`):**\n    *   For a surface with boundaries, different formulas exist. A common one for a surface with `b` boundaries is `k = 2g + b - 1`. If we don't distinguish boundary types, `b = n+m`, which for `g=0` gives `k = n+m-1`. This is not among the answer choices, suggesting this formula is not applicable here, likely because it doesn't account for the different boundary types or the specific context of a sphere with punctures (a closed manifold).\n    *   Let's consider the specific case of a sphere (`g=0`) with `N_e` electric defects (our `m` rough holes) and `N_m` magnetic defects (our `n` smooth holes).\n    *   Several sources in theoretical physics literature (for example, Hamma et. al., Phys. Rev. A 71, 022315) show that for this specific configuration (defects on a sphere), the number of logical qubits `k` is given by the formula: `k = N_e + N_m - 2`.\n    *   Substituting our terms: `N_e = m` and `N_m = n`.\n    *   This gives `k = m + n - 2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Ground Space Degeneracy (GSD):**\n    *   GSD = 2^k\n    *   Substituting the expression for `k`, we get: GSD = `2^(m+n-2)`.\n\n6.  **Match with Answer Choices:**\n    *   The derived formula `2^(m+n-2)` corresponds exactly to answer choice B.\n\n7.  **Formulate the Code:**\n    *   The request requires a Python script to solve the task. Since `m` and `n` are variables, the script can't compute a numerical result.\n    *   The best approach is to create a script that programmatically constructs and prints the final formula. This fulfills the requirement of using coding skills and printing the output.\n    *   The script will define a function that takes symbolic inputs `m` and `n` and prints the formula `2^(m + n - 2)`. This explicitly shows each number (`2` as the base and `2` in the exponent) as requested.\n\nThis structured process ensures all aspects of the user's request are addressed, leading from the physics question to a correct formula and finally to a Python script that presents it.\n\n```python\ndef print_toric_code_degeneracy_formula():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function calculates and prints the symbolic formula for the \n  ground space degeneracy of the toric code on a sphere with n smooth\n  and m rough holes.\n\n  The number of logical qubits (k) is m + n - 2.\n  The ground space degeneracy (GSD) is 2^k.\n  \"\"\"\n  # Define the symbolic variables for the number of holes\n  m = 'm'  # Number of rough holes\n  n = 'n'  # Number of smooth holes\n  \n  # The numbers in the final equation\n  base = 2\n  subtrahend = 2\n  \n  # Print the final equation using an f-string\n  print(\"The ground space degeneracy is given by the formula:\")\n  print(f\"{base}^({m} + {n} - {subtrahend})\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the result\nprint_toric_code_degeneracy_formula()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
