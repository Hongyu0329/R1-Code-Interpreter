# The problem is to find the limit of f(n)/(n*log2(n)) as n approaches infinity.
# Based on advanced results in combinatorial number theory, the asymptotic behavior of f(n) is known to be:
# f(n) ~ (n * log2(n)) / log2(4/3)
# The limit is therefore 1 / log2(4/3).

# We can express log2(4/3) as log2(4) - log2(3), which is 2 - log2(3).
# Let's define the numbers in the final expression.
numerator_of_fraction = 4
denominator_of_fraction = 3
base_of_log = 2

# The expression for the limit is 1 / (log2(4) - log2(3))
val_log_4 = math.log2(numerator_of_fraction)
val_log_3 = math.log2(denominator_of_fraction)

# We want to be explicit about the numbers in the final equation.
# Final expression is: 1 / (2 - log2(3))
number_two = 2
number_three = 3

result = 1 / (number_two - math.log2(number_three))

print(f"This simplifies to: 1 / ({int(val_log_4)} - log2({denominator_of_fraction}))")
