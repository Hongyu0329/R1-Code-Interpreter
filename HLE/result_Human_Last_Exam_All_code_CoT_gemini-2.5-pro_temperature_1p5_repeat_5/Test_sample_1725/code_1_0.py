    This function provides the solution to the crystal model problem.
    
    Part A asks for the dimension of the fiber of the bundle π.
    The connection C represents the local crystal distortion, which is a 3x3 tensor at each point.
    The space of 3x3 matrices has dimension 3 * 3 = 9.
    So, the dimension of the fiber is 9.
    
    Part B asks for the number of coefficients specifying the energy E.
    E is a cubic-symmetric quadratic form on the dislocation density tensor α (which is also a 3x3 matrix).
    The number of independent coefficients for such a form is equal to the number of irreducible representations
    into which the space of 3x3 tensors decomposes under the cubic symmetry group.
    This number is 4.
    
    The final answer is presented as 'A B'.
