# The poem is a double sestina, which follows a strict end-word pattern.
# Analysis reveals the end-word pattern is preserved, which means the two swapped lines must have the same end-word to avoid detection by a simple pattern check.
# The error, therefore, must be thematic. We need to find two lines with the same end-word that have been swapped between stanzas, breaking the theme and tone of their respective sections.

# Stanza 9 (lines 49-54) is by Strephon and is a list of active curses and hates ("I wish", "I curse", "I hate").
# Stanza 10 (lines 55-60) is by Klaius and describes a more passive, internal despair ("My prayer is...", "My state...").

# Line 50, in Strephon's stanza, is "I give the sun a last farewell each evening;". Its melancholic tone is a bit out of place.
# Line 58, in Klaius's stanza, is "I wish no evenings more to see, each evening;". This active "wish" fits the pattern of Strephon's curses.

# Both lines end with "evening".
# Swapping them would make both stanzas more thematically consistent.
# Line 58 would fit into Strephon's list of angry wishes in Stanza 9.
# Line 50 would fit into Klaius's description of passive despair in Stanza 10.
# Therefore, the swapped lines are 50 and 58.
