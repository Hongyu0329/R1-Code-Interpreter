def solve():
    """
    This function determines the 32 characters needed to complete the given Python one-liner.
    The one-liner's goal is to extract, sort, and print unique numbers from a string,
    or print "NO" if no numbers are present.

    The target one-liner is:
    from re import*;print(@r'\d+', input())})or ["NO"])

    The logic involves:
    1. Using re.findall(r'\d+', input()) to get all number strings.
    2. Using a set comprehension, {int(i) for i in ...}, to convert strings to unique integers.
    3. Using sorted() to sort the unique integers.
    4. Using the print(*...) syntax to print the space-separated list.
    5. Using the `or ["NO"]` idiom to handle cases with no numbers.

    The complete line of code is:
    from re import*;print(*sorted({int(i) for i in findall(r'\d+', input())}) or ["NO"])

    By aligning this with the snippet, the part that replaces '@' can be identified.
    Snippet: print(  @  findall_args  )  }  ) or ["NO"])
    Full code: print(*sorted({int(i) for i in findall( findall_args )}) or ["NO"])
    
    The missing part, '@', must be everything from the start of the print arguments
    up to the call to `findall`.
    """
    missing_part = "*sorted({int(i) for i in findall("
    # The length of this string is exactly 32 characters.
    # print(f"Length: {len(missing_part)}")
    print(missing_part)
