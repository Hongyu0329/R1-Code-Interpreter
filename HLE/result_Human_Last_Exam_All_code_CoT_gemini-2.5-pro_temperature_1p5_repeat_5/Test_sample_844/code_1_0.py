    print("Evaluating the answer choices:")

    print("A. CA biotypes have an enhanced ability to metabolize RFOs than MA biotypes.")
    print("   - This is likely TRUE. CA's preferred diet is rich in raffinose (an RFO), while MA's is not.\n")

    print("B. CA preferred raffinose-rich diet, whereas MA preferred sucrose-rich diet.")
    print("   - This is stated in the problem description. It is TRUE.\n")

    print("C. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to lower raffinose levels in cotton.")
    print("   - This is likely TRUE. CA moves from a high-raffinose environment (watermelon) to a low-raffinose one (cotton). Less substrate (raffinose) means less need for the enzyme (galactosidase).\n")

    print("D. Upon the host transfer, the CA biotypes showed decreased galactosidase activity, owing to higher glucose levels in cotton.")
    print("   - This is likely FALSE. While the activity does decrease, the most direct cause is the lack of raffinose, the enzyme's specific substrate (as stated in C). Attributing it to higher glucose is less direct and not supported by the text.\n")
    
    print("E. Upon the host transfer, the MA biotypes showed increased galactosidase activity, owing to higher raffinose levels in the watermelon.")
    print("   - This is likely TRUE. MA moves to a high-raffinose environment. To survive, it must adapt by increasing the activity of the enzyme needed to process this new food source.\n")

    print("Conclusion: Statement D presents an incorrect cause for the biological effect. The most direct cause for decreased galactosidase activity is a decrease in its substrate, raffinose.")
