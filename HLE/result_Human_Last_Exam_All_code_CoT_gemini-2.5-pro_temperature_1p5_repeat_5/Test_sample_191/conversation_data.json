    "My plan is to first identify the key protein involved in the process described. The process involves a protein being broken down, which then leads to macrophages engulfing amyloid plaques. This points to an opsonization process, where a molecule tags a target for destruction by immune cells. I will identify the specific protein and its active fragment from the complement cascade, a well-known part of the immune system involved in such processes. Then, I will write a Python script to print the name of this protein and a brief explanation of its mechanism, as requested by the instructions.\n\n```python\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the protein that, when broken down,\n    facilitates macrophage engulfment of amyloid.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The protein is Complement component 3 (C3). When C3 is broken down (cleaved), \"\n        \"its resulting fragment, C3b, acts as a molecular tag (an opsonin) that coats \"\n        \"the surface of amyloid deposits. This C3b tag is then recognized by complement \"\n        \"receptors on immune cells like macrophages and microglia, signaling them to engulf \"\n        \"and clear the amyloid plaques.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_biology_question()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
