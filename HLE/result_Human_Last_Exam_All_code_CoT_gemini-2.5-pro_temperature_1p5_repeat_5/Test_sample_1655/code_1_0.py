    print("To define it, we must specify BOTH the x and y polarization components at every point.")

    # Step 5: Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Because the two polarization components of the output beam cannot be controlled independently with a single, linearly polarized, controllable input beam, it is not possible to generate an ARBITRARY vector beam.")
