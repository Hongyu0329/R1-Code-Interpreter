    Calculates the probability that a 2D simple random walk conditioned to avoid the origin,
    starting from (0,1), hits the set of neighbors of (3600,0).
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The conditioned random walk is approximated by a continuous process where the angle
       undergoes a Brownian motion on a circle, and the radius drifts to infinity.
    2. Starting from (0,1), the initial angle is pi/2. The target is around (3600,0), at an angle of 0.
    3. By the time the walk reaches a large radius R=3600, the angular distribution is effectively uniform.
    4. The probability of hitting the target is therefore the ratio of its angular size to 2*pi.
    5. The target set is the neighbors of (3600,0). Its angular width is determined by the points (3600,1) and (3600,-1),
       spanning an angle of approximately 2 * arctan(1/3600), which is close to 2/3600 radians.
    6. The probability is P = (2/R) / (2*pi) = 1 / (R*pi), where R=3600.
