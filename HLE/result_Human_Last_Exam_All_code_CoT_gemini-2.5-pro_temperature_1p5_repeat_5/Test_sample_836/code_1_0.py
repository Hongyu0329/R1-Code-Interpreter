The starting point is the generalized pair correlation function, often denoted as g(r₁, t₁; r₂, t₂).
This function represents the conditional probability density of observing a particle (e.g., a neutron)
at position r₁ at time t₁, given that a particle was observed at r₂ at t₂.

In many physical systems, including nuclear reactors under steady-state conditions, we can assume
the process is statistically homogeneous in space and stationary in time. This simplifies the function
so that it only depends on the relative displacement vector r = r₁ - r₂ and the time lag τ = t₁ - t₂.
We can thus write the function as g(r, τ).

The space-time, double Fourier transform of this function g(r, τ) is defined as:

S(k, ω) = ∫ dτ ∫ d³r  g(r, τ) * e**(-i * (k·r - ωτ))

where the variables in the final equation are:
-   S(k, ω): The transformed function.
-   k: The wavevector, which is the Fourier variable conjugate to the space variable r.
-   ω: The angular frequency, which is the Fourier variable conjugate to the time variable τ.
-   r: The relative position vector.
-   τ: The relative time lag.
-   i: The imaginary unit.
-   e: The base of the natural logarithm, approximately 2.718.
-   ∫ dτ ∫ d³r: Integration over all time and three-dimensional space.

This transformed function, S(k, ω), is known in physics and engineering as the:
