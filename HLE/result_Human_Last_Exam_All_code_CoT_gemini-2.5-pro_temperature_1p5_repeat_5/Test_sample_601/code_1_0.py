    This problem explores the operational capabilities of a Fibonacci heap.
    To transform a chain of k items into a chain of k+1 items, we need to add one node and restructure the tree.
    The fundamental steps required are:
    1. Adding the new node to the heap. This requires an `Insert` operation.
    2. Modifying the existing tree structure to allow the new node to be linked correctly. Breaking old links is done via the `Decrease-key` operation.
    3. Forming new links to create the final single-tree structure. This is achieved via the consolidation mechanism, which is triggered by a `Delete-min` operation.

    Therefore, at least one of each of these three distinct types of operations is necessary.
    A possible sequence, despite its side effects not creating a perfect chain under standard consolidation, would be:
    1. Insert(new_node): Introduces the (k+1)-th node.
    2. Decrease-key(existing_node): Manipulates the structure of the existing k-chain to prepare it for linking.
    3. Delete-min(dummy_node): Triggers consolidation to form a new single tree.
    This suggests that 3 fundamental operations are at the core of the solution.
