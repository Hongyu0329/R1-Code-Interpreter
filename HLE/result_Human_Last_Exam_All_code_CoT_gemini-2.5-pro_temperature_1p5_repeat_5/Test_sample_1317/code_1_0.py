    # Step 1: Explain the principle of Hfr interrupted mating
    print("Step 1: Understanding Hfr Gene Transfer")
    print("In Hfr interrupted mating, the donor cell's chromosome is transferred linearly to the recipient cell.")
    print("This transfer starts at a specific point (Origin of Transfer) and proceeds in one direction.")
    print("The connection between cells is fragile and often breaks before the entire chromosome is transferred.")
    print("As a result, genes closer to the start of transfer enter the recipient cell more frequently than genes that are further away.")

    # Step 2: Analyze the specific experiment's details
    print("Step 2: Analyzing the Given Gene Order")
    print("The problem provides the gene order on the chromosome: thr-azi-gal.")

    # Step 3: Relate transfer time to recombinant frequency
    print("Step 3: Determining the Frequency of Recombinants")
    print("The frequency of observing recombinants for a gene is directly proportional to how often that gene is successfully transferred.")
    print("Since 'thr' is the first gene in the sequence to be transferred, it will be present in the highest number of recipient cells.")
    print("Therefore, the frequency of transfer and recombination for the genes will follow this order:")
    # Final "equation" output

    print("Step 4: Identifying the Correct Location")
    print("The question asks for the location with the highest frequency of recombinants.")
    print("Based on our analysis, this is the locus of the 'thr' gene.")
    print("Choice 'D. Immediately before thr+' best describes this location in the context of the transfer process, as it's the first gene encountered 'before' the others.")
