    # Step 1: Define the Generality Constraint
    step_1 = (
        "1. Gareth Evans's Generality Constraint states that thought is systematic and structured. "
        "If a person can think a certain thought (e.g., 'Socrates is wise'), "
        "they must possess the conceptual constituents of that thought (the concept of 'Socrates' and the concept of 'being wise'). "
        "The core idea is that anyone possessing these concepts should also be able to understand other thoughts that "
        "recombine those same constituents (e.g., 'Plato is wise', if they have the concept of 'Plato')."
    )
    print(step_1)
    print()

    # Step 2: Analyze the user's known propositions
    step_2 = (
        "2. Your first premise is that you understand the proposition 'Fa'. "
        "From this, we conclude that you possess the concept of the predicate 'F'."
    )
    print(step_2)
    print()

    # Step 3: Analyze the second premise
    step_3 = (
        "3. Your second premise is that you understand universal quantification (∀). "
        "This is a higher-order concept about the scope of a predicate, allowing one to form general thoughts."
    )
    print(step_3)
    print()

    # Step 4: Synthesize and form the conclusion
    step_4 = (
        "4. The proposition '∀x Fx' (read as 'For all x, Fx is true') is constructed from two main concepts: "
        "the predicate 'F' and the logical operator of universal quantification '∀'. "
        "Since you possess both of these conceptual building blocks, the Generality Constraint implies you should "
        "be able to combine them to form and understand the resulting proposition."
    )
    print(step_4)
    print()
    
    # Step 5: Fulfill the 'equation' requirement
    step_5 = (
        "5. We can express this conclusion in a symbolic equation. Let's assign numbers to the components:\n"
        "   Component (1): Understanding the predicate 'F' (from 'Fa')\n"
        "   Component (2): Understanding universal quantification '∀'\n"
        "This leads to the conceptual result (3):\n"
        "   1 + 2 => 3 (Ability to understand '∀x Fx')\n"
        "The numbers in this conceptual equation are 1, 2, and 3."
    )
    print(step_5)
    print("-" * 60)
    
    print("\nFinal Answer: Yes. The Generality Constraint is fundamentally about the ability to form new thoughts from existing conceptual parts. Since you have the parts for '∀x Fx', you should be able to understand it.")
