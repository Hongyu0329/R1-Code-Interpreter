    "To determine the VC dimension of the logic $\\mathrm{FO}_{\\exists, \\land, \\top, \\bot}[S]$, where $S$ contains 4 unary predicates, we need to find the size of the largest set of points that can be shattered by the formulas of this logic.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the logical formulas:** First, we'll examine the structure of any formula $\\phi(x)$ with one free variable $x$ in the given logic. The logic allows existential quantifiers ($\\exists$), conjunction ($\\land$), and constants True ($\\top$) and False ($\\bot$), applied to the 4 unary predicates from the schema $S$, let's call them $P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the formula structure:** We will show that because the predicates are unary (i.e., they apply to a single variable), any formula in this logic is equivalent to either a simple conjunction of predicates (a \"monomial\" like $P_i(x) \\land P_j(x)$) or the formula $\\bot$ (False).\n    - A formula $\\phi(x)$ has the form $\\exists y_1 \\dots \\exists y_m . \\psi(x, y_1, \\dots, y_m)$, where $\\psi$ is a conjunction of atoms like $P_i(v)$.\n    - Since each atom involves only one variable, $\\psi$ can be grouped by variable: $\\psi_x(x) \\land \\psi_{y_1}(y_1) \\land \\dots \\land \\psi_{y_m}(y_m)$.\n    - The formula becomes $\\psi_x(x) \\land (\\exists y_1.\\psi_{y_1}(y_1)) \\land \\dots$. Each parenthesized part is a sentence (it's either true or false for a given model).\n    - If any sentence is false, the whole formula is equivalent to $\\bot$. If all are true, it's equivalent to $\\psi_x(x)$, which is a monomial in the predicates applied to $x$.\n\n3.  **Determine the VC dimension:** The problem is now reduced to finding the VC dimension of the concept class formed by monomials over 4 features (the 4 predicates).\n    *   **Lower Bound (VC-dim $\\ge 4$):** We will show that a set of 4 points can be shattered. This requires constructing a specific model (an assignment of truth values to the predicates for each point) and demonstrating that for every one of the $2^4=16$ possible subsets of the 4 points, we can find a monomial formula that defines it.\n    *   **Upper Bound (VC-dim $< 5$):** We will show that no set of 5 points can be shattered. The number of distinct concepts we can create is limited by the number of possible monomial formulas. With 4 predicates, we can form $2^4=16$ monomials. Including the $\\bot$ formula, we have at most 17 distinct concepts. To shatter 5 points, we would need to create $2^5=32$ distinct subsets, which is more than 17. Therefore, a set of 5 points cannot be shattered.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Combining the lower and upper bounds, we conclude the VC dimension is 4.\n\nThe following Python code will implement this plan, demonstrating the shattering of 4 points and explaining the argument for the upper bound.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_vc_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the VC dimension for the given first-order logic fragment.\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 4  # Number of unary predicates in schema S\n    predicates = list(range(k))\n    points = list(range(k))\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analysis of the Logic\")\n    print(\"The logic is FO_exists,and,T,F[S] with S having 4 unary predicates (P0, P1, P2, P3).\")\n    print(\"Any formula phi(x) in this logic simplifies to either F (False) or a monomial of the form: P_i(x) AND P_j(x) ...\")\n    print(\"This is because any existential quantifiers on other variables (e.g., exists y.
