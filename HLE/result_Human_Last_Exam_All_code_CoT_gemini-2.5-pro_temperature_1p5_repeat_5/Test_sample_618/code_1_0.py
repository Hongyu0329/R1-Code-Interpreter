    # --- Step 1: Define Symbols ---
    # We define the independent variables (t, x), the dependent variable (u),
    # and the parameters of the PDE (k1, k2).
    # We also define the arbitrary constants that will appear in the solution.
    t, x, u, k1, k2 = sp.symbols('t x u k1 k2', real=True)
    c_2, c_3 = sp.symbols('c_2 c_3', real=True)

    # --- Step 2: Set up the System of Determining Equations ---
    # Applying the Lie invariance algorithm to the PDE: u_t = u_xx + (k1*ln(u) + k2)*u
    # and making standard simplifying assumptions (e.g., xi depends only on t),
    # we arrive at a system of ordinary and partial differential equations
    # for the infinitesimals. We are interested in the function xi(t).

    xi = sp.Function('xi')(t)

    # The analysis of the determining equations reveals that `xi(t)` must satisfy
    # a specific second-order linear ordinary differential equation.
    # This comes from substituting the solutions for other infinitesimals (A(t,x))
    # back into the system, and requiring the resulting equation to hold for all x.
    # The ODE for xi(t) is:
    ode_for_xi = xi.diff(t, 2) - k1 * xi.diff(t)

    # --- Step 3: Solve the ODE for xi(t) ---
    # We use SymPy's dsolve function to find the general solution for xi(t).
    xi_solution = sp.dsolve(ode_for_xi, xi).rhs

    # We replace the default constants 'C1' and 'C2' with our chosen symbols
    # for better readability. The order may vary, so we map them carefully.
    # dsolve returns C1 + C2*exp(k1*t). We map C1 to c_3 (for translation)
    # and C2 to c_2.
