# The analysis of the stability operator L involves decomposing it using separation of variables.
# This results in a series of one-dimensional eigenvalue problems, indexed by the spherical harmonic mode k.
# For each mode k, we analyze the potential term V_k(rho).
# For k > 0, the potential is negative for large rho, which does not support L^2 eigenfunctions with positive eigenvalues.
# For k = 0, the potential is a positive, decaying function.
# An operator of this form, when transformed into a standard Schr√∂dinger operator, has a potential that vanishes at infinity.
# A fundamental result in mathematical physics is that such operators do not have L^2-eigenfunctions with positive energy (eigenvalues).
# Therefore, none of the operators L_k have positive eigenvalues.
# Summing over all modes k, the total number of positive eigenvalues for the operator L is 0.
