    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2 = 8x + x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^4 + 8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Model Transformation**: The initial equation, when reduced modulo 2, gives $y^2=x^2$, which is a highly singular line. To find the stable reduction, we must find a \"better\" equation for the same curve. This is achieved by a change of variables of the form $x = p^k x'$ and $y = p^m y'$, where $p=2$. The goal is to find integer exponents $k$ and $m$ that yield a new equation with integer coefficients that is \"minimal\" in a specific sense (related to the valuation of its discriminant). This process is part of Tate's algorithm.\n\n2.  **Find Optimal Transformation**: The optimal choice for $k$ is the one that maximizes the value $V = \\min_{i} (v_2(a_i) + i \\cdot k)$, where $a_i$ are the coefficients of the polynomial and $v_2$ is the 2-adic valuation (the number of times 2 divides the coefficient). For our polynomial $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$, the optimal value is found to be $k=3$. This gives $V=6$.\n\n3.  **New Equation**: For the transformation to be valid for an equation of the form $y^2 = f(x)$, $V$ must be even, which it is ($V=6$). We then set $m=V/2=3$. Substituting $x=2^3x' = 8x'$ and $y=2^3y' = 8y'$ into the original equation and simplifying gives a new equation for the curve.\n\n4.  **Reduce and Analyze**: We take this new equation and reduce its coefficients modulo 2. The resulting curve over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is the reduction of our new model.\n\n5.  **Check for Smoothness**: We check if this reduced curve is smooth (has no singular points). If it is, the curve is said to have \"good reduction\". A model with good reduction is the stable model, and its reduction is the stable reduction. A smooth curve, by definition, has no singular points, and thus zero double points.\n\nThe following Python script implements this procedure to find the new equation, analyze it, and determine the number of double points.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuation(n, p):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the p-adic valuation of an integer n.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return float('inf')  # Valuation of 0 is infinite\n    count = 0\n    n = abs(n)\n    while n > 0 and n % p == 0:\n        count += 1\n        n //= p\n    return count\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The prime to reduce over\n    p = 2\n    \n    # Coefficients of the polynomial f(x) from the curve y^2 = f(x)\n    # The curve is y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\n    # Let's write it in descending order of power for easier processing.\n    # f(x) = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x\n    coeffs = {5: 8, 4: 4, 3: 4, 2: 1, 1: 8}\n\n    print(\"The original curve equation is: y^2 = 8*x + 1*x^2 + 4*x^3 + 4*x^4 + 8*x^5\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Find the optimal transformation using Tate's algorithm principles.\n    # We need to find k that maximizes V = min_i(v_p(a_i) + i*k).\n    # For this specific polynomial, the optimal k is 3.\n    k_optimal = 3\n    \n    # 2-adic valuations of the original coefficients\n    vals = {i: get_valuation(c, p) for i, c in coeffs.items()}\n    \n    # Calculate V for the optimal k\n    v_values = [vals[i] + i * k_optimal for i in coeffs]\n    V = min(v_values)\n    \n    # Check if V is even.
