A GTO opponent will have a balanced range of hands for every action (folding, calling, raising), so you cannot use their response to gain an exploitable edge. Betting for information is an exploitative tactic that doesn't work against a perfect GTO player. This reason disappears.\n")

A GTO player is not trying to exploit your personal tendencies; they are playing a mathematically balanced strategy against your entire range of possible hands.
