# A script to determine the critical exponent ν for a hypothetical G₄-theoretical framework.

# Step 1: Interpretation of the framework.
# The term "G₄-theoretical framework" is not standard in physics literature.
# A reasonable interpretation is to associate "G₄" with Ginzburg-Landau-type theories,
# for which the upper critical dimension is d_c = 4.

# Step 2: Application of the relevant physical model.
# For any system with spatial dimension d >= d_c, critical phenomena are correctly
# described by Mean-Field Theory (MFT). We proceed under this assumption.

# Step 3: Calculation of the exponent ν.
# In Mean-Field Theory, the critical exponent ν, which governs the scaling
# of the correlation length, has a universal value.
numerator = 1
denominator = 2
nu = numerator / denominator

# Step 4: Output the result and the equation.
# The following code prints the reasoning and the final calculation for ν.
