# The question asks for the value 'a' at which the only obstruction
# to the symplectic embedding of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a 4D ball
# is the volume constraint.
#
# From the theory of symplectic geometry, this occurs when the embedding
# capacity c(a) is equal to 'a'. This condition, c(a) = a, holds true
# for the range of values 1 <= a <= tau^2, where tau is the golden ratio.
# The specific value where this behavior transitions is a = tau^2.
#
# The golden ratio tau = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
# Therefore, tau^2 = ((1 + sqrt(5)) / 2)^2 = (1 + 5 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4
# which simplifies to tau^2 = (6 + 2*sqrt(5)) / 4 = (3 + sqrt(5)) / 2.
#
# This script calculates the value of a = (3 + sqrt(5)) / 2.

# Let's define the numbers for the equation a = (3 + sqrt(5)) / 2
num_three = 3
num_five = 5
num_two = 2

# Calculate the square root component
sqrt_of_five = math.sqrt(num_five)

# Calculate the numerator of the fraction
numerator = num_three + sqrt_of_five

# Calculate the final value of 'a'
a = numerator / num_two

# As requested, we will output each number in the final equation
# and show the steps of the calculation.
