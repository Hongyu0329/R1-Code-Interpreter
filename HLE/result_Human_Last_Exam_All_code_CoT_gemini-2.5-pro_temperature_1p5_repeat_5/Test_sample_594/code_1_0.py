    print("Core Concept: Gas evolved from impurities gets trapped in pores during sintering.")
    print("This trapped gas creates internal pressure, which opposes densification and can pin grain boundaries, inhibiting grain growth.\n")

    print("Evaluating the Answer Choices:")
    print("----------------------------")

    print("A. Higher heating rates ... resulting in lower sintered densities.")
    print("   Analysis: Plausible. Faster heating can close pores at the surface before gas escapes from the interior, trapping it. This trapped gas then hinders final densification. This is a likely effect.\n")

    print("B. De-densification when sintering under some atmospheres...")
    print("   Analysis: Plausible. If the internal gas pressure becomes greater than the sintering pressure, the pores will expand, causing the part to swell (de-densify). This is a likely effect.\n")

    print("C. Large, randomly distributed voids in the sintered part.")
    print("   Analysis: Plausible. Trapped gas prevents pores from shrinking and can cause them to coarsen, resulting in large, stable voids. This is a very common and likely effect.\n")

    print("D. Larger grain sizes in the interior of the part than near the part's surface.")
    print("   Analysis: UNLIKELY. Gas is more easily trapped in the interior. These gas-filled pores pin grain boundaries, *inhibiting* grain growth. Gas near the surface can escape, allowing for easier pore elimination and uninhibited grain growth. Therefore, we expect smaller grains in the interior and larger grains near the surface. This statement describes the opposite scenario.\n")

    print("E. Cracking.")
    print("   Analysis: Plausible. High internal pressure from the trapped gas can exceed the strength of the still-porous ceramic, causing it to crack. This is a likely effect.\n")

    print("F. Higher green densities resulting in lower sintered densities...")
    print("   Analysis: Plausible. A higher green density part has smaller pores that can close off earlier in the sintering cycle. This can trap gas more efficiently than in a lower-density part with larger, more open pores, leading to a lower final density. This is a known, likely effect.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("-----------")
    print("The effect that is unlikely to arise is the one that contradicts the fundamental principles of sintering with trapped gas. Option D is the only one that does so.")
