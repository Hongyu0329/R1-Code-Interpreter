    "This is a historical question that requires looking up information in historical records. I will find the name of the judge and then present it using a Python script as requested.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Research the historical records for the town of Bártfa (the Hungarian name for Bardejov) to find the name of the judge ('richtár' in Slovak/German) for the year 1461.\n2.  Store the year, the town's names, and the judge's name in variables within a Python script.\n3.  Use the `print()` function to display the information in a clear, readable sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_judge_of_bartfa_1461():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and prints the name of the judge of Bártfa (Bardejov) in 1461.\n    The information is based on historical records of the town.\n    \"\"\"\n    year = 1461\n    town_hungarian = \"Bártfa\"\n    town_modern = \"Bardejov\"\n    judge_name = \"Mikuláš Lökös\"\n\n    # The only number in the user's request is the year 1461.\n    # The final output will include this number.\n    print(f\"The judge of {town_hungarian} (now {town_modern}) in {year} was {judge_name}.\")\n\nfind_judge_of_bartfa_1461()\n```\n<<<Mikuláš Lökös>>>"
