    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  Identify the specific type of container mentioned in the question: a \"single-dose container ampule\".\n2.  Recall the relevant guidelines, primarily from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797>, which sets standards for sterile compounding.\n3.  Distinguish between an **ampule** (a glass container that is broken open) and a **vial** (which has a rubber stopper that is punctured). This distinction is critical for determining the correct BUD.\n4.  According to USP <797>, once an ampule is opened, it is an open system that cannot be resealed. Therefore, it is highly susceptible to contamination.\n5.  Based on this, state the rule: the contents of an opened ampule must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored.\n6.  To provide a complete answer and avoid confusion, I will also include the rule for a single-dose *vial* when punctured in a similar sterile environment, which is different.\n7.  The final Python code will use `print()` statements to clearly output this information.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_information():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) information for a single-dose ampule\n    and compares it with a single-dose vial, based on USP <797> guidelines for sterile environments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Information for a single-dose ampule\n    container_ampule = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    bud_ampule_hours = 0\n    bud_ampule_rule = \"Immediate use only\"\n\n    # Information for a single-dose vial (for comparison)\n    container_vial = \"single-dose vial\"\n    bud_vial_hours = 12\n    bud_vial_rule = f\"Up to {bud_vial_hours} hours after initial puncture\"\n\n    # --- Main Answer ---\n    print(f\"Analysis for: A {container_ampule} punctured in a sterile environment.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"An ampule is a sealed glass container that is broken open and cannot be resealed.\")\n    print(\"Once opened, it is an open system exposed to the environment.\")\n    print(\"\\nAccording to sterile compounding standards (USP <797>):\")\n    print(f\"*   The BUD is: '{bud_ampule_rule}'.\")\n    print(f\"*   Storage time allowed: {bud_ampule_hours} hours.\")\n    print(\"*   Any unused portion must be discarded immediately and cannot be stored for future use.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # --- Contextual Comparison ---\n    print(\"\\nFor comparison, the rule for a single-dose VIAL is different:\")\n    print(f\"A {container_vial}, which has a rubber stopper, may be used for up to {bud_vial_hours} hours after the first puncture when maintained in a sterile environment.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    get_bud_information()\n```\n<<<Immediate use only>>>"
