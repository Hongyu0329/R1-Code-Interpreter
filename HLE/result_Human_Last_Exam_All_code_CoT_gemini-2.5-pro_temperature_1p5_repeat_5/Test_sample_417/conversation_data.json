    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze its molecular structure and identify the number of chemically non-equivalent proton environments.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Analyze Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule consists of a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) core. At positions 1, 3, and 5, three identical, bulky, chiral substituents are attached. The symmetrical 1,3,5-substitution pattern on the mesitylene ring means the molecule possesses a C3 rotational axis of symmetry. This symmetry simplifies the problem significantly, as it makes the three large substituent arms chemically equivalent. Therefore, we only need to count the unique proton environments on the central core and on a single one of the arms.\n\n2.  **Count Signals from the Central Core:**\n    *   The central core is a 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene moiety. The three methyl groups at positions 2, 4, and 6 are chemically equivalent due to the C3 symmetry.\n    *   **Core signals = 1** (representing all three methyl groups, with an integral of 9H).\n\n3.  **Count Signals from One Substituent Arm:**\n    The arm has the structure: `-CH2-[chiral camphor-indazole group]`. We need to count the unique protons in this entire arm.\n    *   **Methylene (-CH2-) Linker:** This CH2 group is bonded to the chiral camphor-indazole system. Protons in a methylene group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent.\n        *   **Linker signals = 2**.\n    *   **Chiral Camphor-Indazole Group:** This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system. In such a system, protons are generally non-equivalent unless a local plane of symmetry exists, which is not the case here.\n        *   **Indazole Ring Proton (H3):** There is one proton on the pyrazole part of the indazole ring system. This is a unique environment. -> **1 signal**.\n        *   **Trimethyl Groups:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton.\n            *   C7-methyl: This single methyl group at a bridgehead is unique. -> **1 signal**.\n            *   C8-gem-dimethyl: The two methyl groups on the C8 bridge are diastereotopic due to the overall chirality of the molecule. -> **2 signals**.\n        *   **Bicyclic Ring Protons:**\n            *   C4-H (bridgehead): This single proton (methine) is in a unique environment. -> **1 signal**.\n            *   C5-H2 (methylene): The two protons on this carbon are diastereotopic. -> **2 signals**.\n            *   C6-H2 (methylene): The two protons on this carbon are also diastereotopic and are in a different environment from the C5 protons. -> **2 signals**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Number of Signals:**\n    *   Signals from one arm = 2 (linker) + 1 (indazole H) + 1 (C7-Me) + 2 (C8-Me2) + 1 (C4-H) + 2 (C5-H2) + 2 (C6-H2) = **11 signals**.\n    *   Total Signals = Signals from Core + Signals from one Arm\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 11 = 12.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum.\n\n```python\n# Plan:\n# 1. Determine the number of unique proton signals from the central mesitylene core.\n# 2. Determine the number of unique proton signals from one of the three identical substituent arms.\n# 3.
