    "The user is asking for the connectivity of a specific map from algebraic topology. This is a problem that can be solved by applying a known result from homotopy theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the spaces and the map:** The map is of the form `f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^m \\wedge \\Omega S^n) \\to \\Omega(S^m \\wedge S^n)`. By inspecting the user's query, we can identify `m=4` and `n=6`. The target space can be simplified, since the smash product of spheres `S^m \\wedge S^n` is homotopy equivalent to `S^{m+n}`. So, the map is `f: \\Sigma(\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega S^{10}`.\n\n2.  **Recall the relevant theorem:** The connectivity of this specific map, often related to the James-Hopf invariant, is given by a standard formula in the field of homotopy theory. For spaces of the form `S^m` and `S^n`, the connectivity is `k = m + n - 1`. This result stems from detailed analyses of the homotopy fibers of the maps involved, often using tools like the EHP sequence or spectral sequences.\n\n3.  **Apply the formula:** We will substitute the values `m=4` and `n=6` into the formula to compute the connectivity `k`.\n\n4.  **Generate Python code:** The python script will perform this calculation and print the steps clearly, showing how the final number is derived from the inputs, as requested.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the connectivity of the map:\n# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)\n\n# This map is of a general form f_mn: Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n)\n# In our case, m=4 and n=6.\nm = 4\nn = 6\n\n# A known result in algebraic topology gives the connectivity of this map.\n# The connectivity 'k' is given by the formula: k = m + n - 1.\n# A map is k-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups pi_i is an\n# isomorphism for i < k and a surjection for i = k.\n\n# We apply this formula to find the answer.\nconnectivity = m + n - 1\n\n# Print the reasoning and the final calculation, showing each number.\nprint(\"The problem asks for the connectivity of a map involving spheres S^m and S^n.\")\nprint(f\"From the input, we have m = {m} and n = {n}.\")\nprint(\"According to a known result in homotopy theory, the connectivity is given by the formula m + n - 1.\")\nprint(f\"Plugging in the values, we get the equation for the connectivity:\")\nprint(f\"{m} + {n} - 1 = {connectivity}\")\nprint(f\"The connectivity of the map is {connectivity}.\")\n\n```\n<<<9>>>"
