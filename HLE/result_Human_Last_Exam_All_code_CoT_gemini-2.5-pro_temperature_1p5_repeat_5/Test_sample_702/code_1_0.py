# The problem is to find the connectivity of the map:
# f: Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)

# This map is of a general form f_mn: Sigma(Omega S^m wedge Omega S^n) -> Omega(S^m wedge S^n)
# In our case, m=4 and n=6.
m = 4
n = 6

# A known result in algebraic topology gives the connectivity of this map.
# The connectivity 'k' is given by the formula: k = m + n - 1.
# A map is k-connected if the induced map on homotopy groups pi_i is an
# isomorphism for i < k and a surjection for i = k.

# We apply this formula to find the answer.
connectivity = m + n - 1

# Print the reasoning and the final calculation, showing each number.
