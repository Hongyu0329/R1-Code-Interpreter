    This problem asks for the number of higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R)
    of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to have the forest F
    simplicially collapse onto the root R. This quantity, N_-(K), can be calculated
    using a formula from combinatorial topology:

    N_-(K) = I(K) = sum_{sigma in K, sigma != empty} tilde_chi(lk_K(sigma))

    where K is the simplicial complex, sigma are its non-empty simplices,
    lk_K(sigma) is the link of sigma in K, and tilde_chi is the reduced Euler
    characteristic.

    The plan is to:
    1. Use a standard triangulation of the Möbius band.
    2. Calculate the contribution of each type of simplex (triangles, edges, vertices)
       to the sum.
    3. Sum these contributions to get the final answer.
