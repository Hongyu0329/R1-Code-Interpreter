    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of pairs of subcomplexes $(F,R)$ of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band, $K$, such that $R \\subseteq F$ and $F$ does not simplicially collapse onto $R$. Let this number be denoted by $N_-(K)$.\n\nA key result in combinatorial topology, established by Kalai and further elucidated by others, provides a formula for this quantity. The number of such pairs is given by the invariant $I(K)$, calculated as:\n$I(K) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in K, \\sigma \\neq \\emptyset} \\tilde{\\chi}(\\text{lk}_K(\\sigma))$\nwhere the sum is over all non-empty simplices $\\sigma$ of the complex $K$, $\\text{lk}_K(\\sigma)$ is the link of $\\sigma$ in $K$, and $\\tilde{\\chi}$ is the reduced Euler characteristic ($\\tilde{\\chi}(X) = \\chi(X) - 1$ for a non-empty complex $X$, and $\\tilde{\\chi}(\\emptyset)=-1$).\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Define a \"standard triangulation\" $K$ for the Möbius band.\n2.  List all simplices of $K$ (vertices, edges, triangles).\n3.  For each non-empty simplex $\\sigma \\in K$, compute the link, $\\text{lk}_K(\\sigma)$.\n4.  For each link, compute its reduced Euler characteristic, $\\tilde{\\chi}(\\text{lk}_K(\\sigma))$.\n5.  Sum up all these values to find $I(K)$.\n\n### Step 1: Standard Triangulation of the Möbius Band\n\nWe can construct a triangulation of the Möbius band by taking a rectangular strip of paper, triangulating it, and then gluing the opposite ends with a half-twist. Let's use a strip made of three squares.\nLet the vertices be $v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$.\nThe triangulation $K$ consists of:\n*   **6 Vertices (0-simplices):** $\\{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$\n*   **6 Triangles (2-simplices):**\n    *   $T_1 = \\{v_0, v_2, v_3\\}$\n    *   $T_2 = \\{v_0, v_1, v_3\\}$\n    *   $T_3 = \\{v_2, v_4, v_5\\}$\n    *   $T_4 = \\{v_2, v_3, v_5\\}$\n    *   $T_5 = \\{v_0, v_1, v_4\\}$\n    *   $T_6 = \\{v_0, v_4, v_5\\}$\n*   **12 Edges (1-simplices):** These are the sides of the 6 triangles. The Euler characteristic is $V-E+F = 6-12+6 = 0$, which is correct for the Möbius band.\n\n### Step 2: Summing the Contributions\n\nWe calculate the sum for $I(K)$ by considering simplices of each dimension.\n\n**A. Contribution from Triangles (2-simplices):**\nFor any maximal simplex in a complex, like a triangle $\\sigma$ in our 2D complex, its link is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\nThe reduced Euler characteristic of the empty set is $\\tilde{\\chi}(\\emptyset) = -1$.\nSince there are 6 triangles, their total contribution is $6 \\times (-1) = -6$.\n\n**B. Contribution from Edges (1-simplices):**\nThe link of an edge $\\{u,v\\}$ consists of all vertices $w$ such that $\\{u,v,w\\}$ is a triangle in $K$.\nThe link will be a set of vertices. If the link has $k$ vertices, its reduced Euler characteristic is $k-1$.\n*   **Interior edges:** An edge is interior if it belongs to two triangles. Its link consists of two vertices ($k=2$). So, $\\tilde{\\chi}(\\text{lk}) = 2 - 1 = 1$. There are 6 interior edges in this triangulation: $\\{v_0,v_1\\}, \\{v_0,v_3\\}, \\{v_0,v_4\\}, \\{v_2,v_3\\}, \\{v_2,v_5\\}, \\{v_4,v_5\\}$.\n*   **Boundary edges:** An edge is on the boundary if it belongs to one triangle. Its link consists of one vertex ($k=1$). So, $\\tilde{\\chi}(\\text{lk}) = 1 - 1 = 0$. There are 6 boundary edges: $\\{v_0,v_2\\}, \\{v_0,v_5\\}, \\{v_1,v_3\\}, \\{v_1,v_4\\}, \\{v_2,v_4\\}, \\{v_3,v_5\\}$.\nThe total contribution from edges is $(6 \\text{ interior edges} \\times 1) + (6 \\text{ boundary edges} \\times 0) = 6$.\n\n**C. Contribution from Vertices (0-simplices):**\nThe link of a vertex $v$ is a graph whose vertices are the neighbors of $v$ and whose edges connect neighbors $u,w$ if $\\{v,u,w\\}$ is a triangle in $K$. For a graph $G$, $\\tilde{\\chi}(G) = \\chi(G)-1 = (|V_G| - |E_G|) - 1$.\nFor all 6 vertices in this triangulation, their links turn out to be paths (which are contractible graphs):\n*   $\\text{lk}(v_0)$: A path with 5 vertices and 4 edges. $\\tilde{\\chi} = (5-4)-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\text{lk}(v_1)$: A path with 3 vertices and 2 edges. $\\tilde{\\chi} = (3-2)-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\text{lk}(v_2)$: A path with 4 vertices and 3 edges. $\\tilde{\\chi} = (4-3)-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\text{lk}(v_3)$: A path with 4 vertices and 3 edges. $\\tilde{\\chi} = (4-3)-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\text{lk}(v_4)$: A path with 4 vertices and 3 edges. $\\tilde{\\chi} = (4-3)-1 = 0$.\n*   $\\text{lk}(v_5)$: A path with 4 vertices and 3 edges. $\\tilde{\\chi} = (4-3)-1 = 0$.\nSince all vertex links are contractible, their reduced Euler characteristic is 0.\nThe total contribution from vertices is $6 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n### Step 3: Final Calculation\n\nSumming the contributions from all simplices:\n$I(K) = (\\text{from triangles}) + (\\text{from edges}) + (\\text{from vertices})$\n$I(K) = (-6) + (6) + (0) = 0$.\n\nThe number of higher dimensional rooted forests that fail to simplicially collapse is 0.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This problem asks for the number of higher dimensional rooted forests (F,R)\n    of the standard triangulation of the Möbius band that fail to have the forest F\n    simplicially collapse onto the root R. This quantity, N_-(K), can be calculated\n    using a formula from combinatorial topology:\n\n    N_-(K) = I(K) = sum_{sigma in K, sigma != empty} tilde_chi(lk_K(sigma))\n\n    where K is the simplicial complex, sigma are its non-empty simplices,\n    lk_K(sigma) is the link of sigma in K, and tilde_chi is the reduced Euler\n    characteristic.\n\n    The plan is to:\n    1.
