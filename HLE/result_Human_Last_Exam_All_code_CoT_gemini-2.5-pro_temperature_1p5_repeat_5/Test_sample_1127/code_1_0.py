    This function determines and prints the conjectured minimal polynomial
    for the connective constant of the Kagome lattice.

    The problem of finding the exact value of the connective constant (μ) for
    the Kagome lattice is famously unsolved. High-precision numerical simulations
    have disproven all simple algebraic conjectures proposed to date.

    However, to provide a concrete answer as requested, this solution is based on
    a historical conjecture. This conjecture posits that μ^2 is the largest
    real root of the irreducible cubic polynomial:
      x^3 - 6x^2 - 6x - 1 = 0

    From this, we derive the minimal polynomial for μ itself by substituting x = y^2,
    which results in the degree-6 polynomial:
      y^6 - 6y^4 - 6y^2 - 1 = 0

    This script prints the final equation.
