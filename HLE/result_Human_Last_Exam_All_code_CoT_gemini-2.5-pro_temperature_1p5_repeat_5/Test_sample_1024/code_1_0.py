# The chosen numbers for parts (A), (B), and (C) are 6, 3, and 7 respectively.
# The analysis for these choices is provided above.
# The sum of these numbers is 6 + 3 + 7 = 16, which satisfies the condition of being a multiple of 8.
# The code will print these three numbers separated by spaces as per the requested format.
