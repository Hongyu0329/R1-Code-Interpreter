    # St. Bonaventure's known positions:

    # C: He believed Christian doctrine entailed a beginning of time.
    # E: He made strong philosophical arguments for a beginning of time.
    # G: He argued against an eternal past because it would imply an actual infinite, which he deemed impossible.
    # H: He argued it's impossible to traverse an infinite number of past days to reach the present.
    # J: His arguments presuppose a sequential view of time.
    # K: He used paradoxes of unequal infinities (e.g., lunar vs. solar cycles) to argue against an eternal past.
