    This function provides the answer to the number of totally bounded group topologies

    The problem is a known result in topological algebra. A totally bounded group has
    no nontrivial convergent sequences if and only if it is "totally complete".
    It was proven by W. T. Nienhuys in 1971 that there are exactly two such distinct
    topologies on the group of integers (Z, +).
