    This function demonstrates that the limit of a diagram of sets under the given
    conditions can have a size of 1.

    We model a simple directed poset J = {0, 1, 2} with the usual ordering.
    J_op has morphisms 2->1, 1->0, and (by composition) 2->0.

    We define a functor F: J_op -> Set where each set is a singleton.
    F(0) = {0}
    F(1) = {1}
    F(2) = {2}
    This satisfies the "nonempty set" condition.

    The maps must be surjective, which is true for maps between singletons.
    f_10: F(1) -> F(0) is defined as f_10(1) = 0
    f_21: F(2) -> F(1) is defined as f_21(2) = 1
    The composed map (f_10 o f_21) sends 2 -> 1 -> 0.
    Functoriality requires f_20 = f_10 o f_21, so f_20(2) must be 0.
