# The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings for G = SL(2, p)
# covering S = PSL(2, p), where p > 5 is a prime.
# This number corresponds to the order of the center of G, which is also the
# order of the Schur multiplier of S.

# The order of the center of SL(n, q) is given by the formula gcd(n, q-1).
# For SL(2, p), n=2 and q=p.
n = 2

# We can use any prime p > 5 to demonstrate the calculation. Let's use p = 7.
p = 7

# Since p > 5 is prime, it must be an odd number, so p-1 is always even.
# The calculation is gcd(2, p-1).
p_minus_1 = p - 1
result = math.gcd(n, p_minus_1)

# The result is always 2 for any odd prime p.
