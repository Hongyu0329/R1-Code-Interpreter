    This function solves the given topology problem.

    The problem describes the properties of a topological space X in relation to
    the long ray R. These properties are the defining universal properties of the
    Stone-Čech compactification, beta(R).

    1. X is a compactification of R (R is dense in the compact space X).
    2. Every bounded continuous function from R to the real numbers extends
       uniquely to a continuous function on X.

    A key theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of
    a Tychonoff space (like the long ray R) is unique up to a homeomorphism
    that fixes the original space.

    Therefore, any two spaces X1 and X2 satisfying the given conditions must be
    homeomorphic. This means they belong to the same homeomorphism class.

    As a result, there is only one such distinct homeomorphism class.
