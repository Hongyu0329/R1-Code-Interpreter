    "To develop an analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime, we can use methods from asymptotic analysis.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Dominant Behavior**: For small $\\epsilon$, the value of the integral is dominated by the region where the denominator is smallest. The denominator, $D(x, \\epsilon) = \\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$, is smallest when $x$ is close to 0.\n\n2.  **Approximate the Integrand**: Near $x=0$, the term $9.0x^{5.0}$ is the dominant part of the function added to $\\epsilon$ because it has the lowest power of $x$. The other terms, $5.0x^{6.0}$ and $9.0x^{8.0}$, are much smaller in this region. The region where the integrand becomes large is where $\\epsilon$ is comparable to $9.0x^{5.0}$. This is the \"inner region\" of the problem. Therefore, we can approximate the denominator as $D(x, \\epsilon) \\approx \\epsilon + 9.0x^{5.0}$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the Integral**: We can approximate the original integral by replacing the denominator with its simplified form. Also, since the main contribution comes from the region near $x=0$, we can extend the upper limit of integration from $15.00$ to $\\infty$. The error introduced by this extension is negligible for small $\\epsilon$.\n    The approximation becomes:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Approximate Integral**: This is a standard integral that can be solved analytically. Let's call the leading term of the function $ax^p$, where $a=9.0$ and $p=5.0$. The general solution for $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + ax^p} dx$ is given by:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{p \\cdot a^{1/p} \\sin(\\pi/p)} \\epsilon^{(1/p) - 1}$\n\n5.  **Compute the Final Formula**: We will substitute the values of $a=9.0$ and $p=5.0$ into this general formula. The exponent will be $(1/5.0) - 1 = -4.0/5.0 = -0.8$. The coefficient will be calculated using Python's `math` library. The Python code below will perform this calculation and print the resulting analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the coefficients for the analytical approximation of the integral.\n    The integral is of the form I(e) = integral[0 to 15] (1 / (e + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8)) dx.\n    For small epsilon, this is approximated by integral[0 to inf] (1 / (e + a*x^p)) dx,\n    where a*x^p is the dominant term for small x.\n    In this case, a = 9.0 and p = 5.0.\n\n    The analytical formula for the approximation is A * epsilon^B, where:\n    B = (1/p) - 1\n    A = (pi / p) / (a^(1/p) * sin(pi/p))\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Parameters from the dominant term (9.0 * x^5.0)\n    a = 9.0\n    p = 5.0\n    \n    # Calculate the exponent B\n    B = (1/p) - 1\n    \n    # Calculate the coefficient A\n    A = (math.pi / p) / (a**(1/p) * math.sin(math.pi / p))\n    \n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\")\n    # The prompt requests that we output each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx = {A} * epsilon^({B})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n\n# The question asks for the answer in a specific format at the end.\n# Based on examples, it seems to request a single numerical value.\n# Let's provide the calculated coefficient A.\na = 9.0\np = 5.0\nA = (math.pi / p) / (a**(1/p) * math.sin(math.pi / p))\n# print(f\"<<<{A}>>>\")\n```\nThe analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is:\nI(epsilon) approx = 0.6890530386884883 * epsilon^(-0.8)\n<<<0.6890530386884883>>>"
