    "My plan is to solve this problem by first implementing the SKI combinator logic in Python. Then, I will construct the given complex expression using these Python functions. The expression represents a Church numeral, which is a higher-order function. To find the integer value `n` that this numeral represents, I will apply the resulting combinator to the Church combinators for the successor function (`SUCC`) and zero (`ZERO`). The result of this application will be the Church numeral for `n`. Finally, I can find the integer value of `n` by applying this `n` combinator to a simple incrementing function and the integer 0. Once `n` is found, I will calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\nHere is the step-by-step breakdown:\n1.  Define the `S`, `K`, and `I` combinators as Python functions.\n2.  Build the given expression `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(S(S(K(S))(K))(I)))))(S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))))` from these primitive combinators.\n3.  Define the combinators for `ZERO` (`K(I)`) and `SUCC` (`S(B)` where `B` is the composition combinator). It can be shown that `S(K(S))(K)` in the expression is equivalent to the `B` combinator.\n4.  Apply the full expression to `SUCC` and `ZERO`. This evaluates the expression in the context of Church arithmetic and yields the specific Church numeral `C_n`.\n5.  To convert the resulting Church numeral combinator `C_n` to a standard integer, apply it to `lambda i: i + 1` and `0`.\n6.  With the integer `n` found, calculate its base-2 logarithm.\n7.  Finally, print the steps of the calculation including the final equation `log_2(n)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\n# The calculation involves deep recursion as it simulates Church numerals.\n# A high recursion limit is necessary for a potentially large number n.\nsys.setrecursionlimit(3000)\n\n# 1. Define the primitive S, K, and I combinators.\ndef S(x):\n    \"\"\"The S combinator: S x y z = x z (y z)\"\"\"\n    return lambda y: lambda z: x(z)(y(z))\n\ndef K(x):\n    \"\"\"The K combinator: K x y = x\"\"\"\n    return lambda y: x\n\ndef I(x):\n    \"\"\"The I combinator: I x = x\"\"\"\n    return x\n\n# 2. Construct the full expression.\n# The combinator for composition B = S(KS)K. It can be shown that the\n# expression S(K(S))(K) used in the problem is also a valid B combinator.\nB_combinator = S(K(S))(K)\n\n# The combinator for the successor function is SUCC = S(B).\nSUCC = S(B_combinator)\n\n# The Church numeral for ZERO is K(I).\nZERO = K(I)\n\n# The expression contains two main sub-expressions, let's call them A and B.\n# A = SUCC(I), where I is the Church numeral for 1. So, A is the numeral for 2.\nA = SUCC(I)\n\n# The other sub-expression involves S(I)(I).\nSII = S(I)(I)\n\n# B = SUCC(S(I)(I))\nB = SUCC(SII)\n\n# Now, we build the full combinator for the target Church numeral n.\nchurch_n_combinator = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))(B))\n\n# 3. Evaluate the combinator expression to get the specific Church numeral for n.\n# We do this by applying it to the SUCC and ZERO combinators.\nn_combinator = church_n_combinator(SUCC)(ZERO)\n\n# 4. Convert the resulting combinator n_combinator into a regular integer.\n# We apply it to a simple increment function and the integer 0.\nn = n_combinator(lambda i: i + 1)(0)\n\n# 5. Calculate log_2 of the resulting integer n.\nlog_n = math.log2(n)\n\n# 6. Print the results in the requested format.\nprint(\"The expression represents a Church integer n, which we can calculate.\")\nprint(f\"The integer value n is: {n}\")\nprint(\"The problem asks for log_2(n).\")\nprint(f\"The equation is: log_2({n}) = {log_n}\")\n\n```\n<<<8.0>>>"
