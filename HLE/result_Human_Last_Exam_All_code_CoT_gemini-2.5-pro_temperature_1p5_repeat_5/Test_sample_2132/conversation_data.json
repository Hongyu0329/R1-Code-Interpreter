    "To solve this, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Reactant and Reaction:** The reactant is 2-chlorocyclohexanone, and the reaction is the Favorskii rearrangement.\n2.  **Determine the Product:** This reaction involves a base-induced ring contraction of the cyclic α-haloketone. The six-membered 2-chlorocyclohexanone rearranges to form cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n3.  **Define Böttcher Molecular Complexity:** This complexity index is calculated using the formula M = N * (E / (N - 1)), where 'N' is the count of non-hydrogen atoms and 'E' is the count of bonds between them.\n4.  **Calculate N and E for the Product:**\n    *   The product, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C₆H₁₀O₂), has 6 carbon atoms and 2 oxygen atoms. Thus, **N = 8**.\n    *   The bonds between these non-hydrogen atoms are: 5 bonds in the cyclopentane ring, 1 bond connecting the ring to the carboxyl group, and 2 bonds within the carboxyl group (one C-O and one C=O). Thus, **E = 8**.\n5.  **Calculate the Complexity:** We will now use a Python script to substitute these values into the formula and compute the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the properties of the product molecule, cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\n\n# N is the number of non-hydrogen atoms.\n# Cyclopentanecarboxylic acid (C6H10O2) has 6 Carbon atoms and 2 Oxygen atoms.\nN = 6 + 2\n\n# E is the number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms.\n# - 5 C-C bonds in the cyclopentane ring.\n# - 1 C-C bond from the ring to the carboxyl group.\n# - 1 C-O single bond in the carboxyl group.\n# - 1 C=O double bond in the carboxyl group (counted as one connection).\nE = 5 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n# Step 2: Apply the Böttcher Molecular Complexity formula.\n# M = N * (E / (N - 1))\nif N > 1:\n    bottcher_complexity = N * (E / (N - 1))\nelse:\n    # The formula is undefined for N <= 1.\n    bottcher_complexity = 0\n\n# Step 3: Print the explanation and the final result.\nprint(\"The product of the Favorskii rearrangement of 2-chlorocyclohexanone is cyclopentanecarboxylic acid.\")\nprint(\"The Böttcher Molecular Complexity (M) is calculated using the formula: M = N * (E / (N - 1))\")\nprint(f\"Number of non-hydrogen atoms (N) = {N}\")\nprint(f\"Number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms (E) = {E}\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the complexity:\")\n# The problem asks to output the final equation with the numbers.\nprint(f\"M = {N} * ({E} / ({N} - 1))\")\nprint(f\"M = {N} * ({E} / {N-1})\")\nprint(f\"M = {N*E} / {N-1}\")\nprint(f\"M = {bottcher_complexity}\")\n\n```\n<<<9.142857142857142>>>"
