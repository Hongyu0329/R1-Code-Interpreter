    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic result in analysis, often related to the moment problem. The statement is true. Here is a step-by-step proof.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will establish that the condition implies that the integral of the product of $f(x)$ with any polynomial $P(x)$ is zero.\n2.  Next, I will use the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem to extend this result from polynomials to all continuous functions with compact support.\n3.  Finally, I will argue that if the integral of $f(x)$ against any continuous function with compact support is zero, then the function $f(x)$ itself must be identically zero.\n4.  I will present this proof in a Python script that prints the argument step-by-step, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prove_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a proof for the following problem:\n\n    Suppose f: R -> R is a Schwartz class function such that the integral of x^k * f(x) over R is 0 for all non-negative integers k.\n    Does it follow that f = 0?\n\n    The function will print the logical steps to conclude that the answer is yes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"The statement is: If f is a Schwartz function such that ∫x^k * f(x) dx = 0 for all k ∈ {0, 1, 2, ...}, then f(x) = 0 for all x.\")\n    print(\"The answer is YES.
