    "Answering this question requires understanding the concept of generalised hypertreewidth and how it behaves with a fixed number of hyperedges.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Define Generalised Hypertreewidth (ghw):** The generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph `H` is the minimum width over all its possible tree decompositions. The width of a decomposition is defined as `max(|B_t|) - 1`, where `B_t` are the vertex sets (bags) associated with the nodes of the tree.\n2.  **Address the \"Unbounded Rank\" Proviso:** The problem states the rank (maximum size of a hyperedge) is not bounded. If we consider a single hyperedge with `N` vertices, any decomposition bag containing it must have at least `N` vertices. This would imply the hypertreewidth could be arbitrarily large.\n3.  **Identify the Core Structural Constraint:** The key insight is that the structural complexity of a hypergraph with a fixed number of edges (`m`) is not determined by the raw number of vertices, but by how vertices are shared across these `m` hyperedges. There are `2^m - 1` possible non-empty patterns of membership for a vertex across the `m` hyperedges.\n4.  **Construct the \"Worst-Case\" Hypergraph:** To find the *maximum* hypertreewidth, we construct a hypergraph that realizes the most complex intersection pattern possible. For `m=3` hyperedges, we can define a \"universal\" hypergraph, `H_3`, that has a unique vertex for each of the `2^3 - 1 = 7` possible membership patterns.\n5.  **Analyze the Hypertreewidth of H_3:**\n    *   First, we'll show that `ghw(H_3)` must be at least a certain value. This can be done by showing that any valid decomposition must contain a bag of a certain minimum size (the \"median bag argument\").\n    *   Second, we'll construct a specific decomposition for `H_3` and calculate its width. A \"star-shaped\" decomposition is a good candidate.\n6.  **Formulate the Final Answer:** By showing that the lower bound from the median bag argument matches the width of our constructed decomposition, we can determine the exact `ghw` for `H_3`. Since any hypergraph with 3 edges is structurally a sub-hypergraph of `H_3`, its `ghw` cannot be larger. This `ghw(H_3)` is our maximum value.\n\nThe Python code below will implement Step 4 and 5 to calculate the size of the bags in the constructed decomposition and present the final equation for the hypertreewidth.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum generalised hypertreewidth for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the vertex types for the 'worst-case' hypergraph.\n    # Each vertex is uniquely identified by the subset of hyperedges it belongs to.\n    # For m=3 edges, there are 2^3 - 1 = 7 types of vertices.\n    vertex_types = [\n        \"v_{1}\", \"v_{2}\", \"v_{3}\",\n        \"v_{12}\", \"v_{13}\", \"v_{23}\",\n        \"v_{123}\"\n    ]\n\n    # Step 2: Define the three hyperedges based on these vertex types.\n    # e_i contains all vertices v_{...} where i is in the subscript.\n    e_1 = {v for v in vertex_types if '1' in v}\n    e_2 = {v for v in vertex_types if '2' in v}\n    e_3 = {v for v in vertex_types if '3' in v}\n\n    # Step 3: Construct a star-shaped decomposition to calculate an upper bound for the ghw.\n    # The decomposition has leaf bags B_1, B_2, B_3 and a central bag B_m.\n    # The leaf bags are set to be the hyperedges themselves.\n    B_1 = e_1\n    B_2 = e_2\n    B_3 = e_3\n\n    # The central bag must contain the union of pairwise intersections to ensure\n    # the subtree property for vertices shared between hyperedges.\n    intersection_12 = e_1.intersection(e_2)\n    intersection_13 = e_1.intersection(e_3)\n    intersection_23 = e_2.intersection(e_3)\n    B_m = intersection_12.union(intersection_13).union(intersection_23)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the sizes of all bags in this decomposition.\n    size_B_1 = len(B_1)\n    size_B_2 = len(B_2)\n    size_B_3 = len(B_3)\n    size_B_m = len(B_m)\n\n    # Step 5: The maximum bag size determines the width of this decomposition.\n    max_bag_size = max(size_B_1, size_B_2, size_B_3, size_B_m)\n\n    # The generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) is defined as max_bag_size - 1.\n    # It can be shown that this is also a lower bound, making it the exact value.\n    hypertreewidth = max_bag_size - 1\n\n    # Step 6: Print the explanation and the final calculated value.\n    print(\"To find the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges,\")\n    print(\"we construct and analyze a 'worst-case' hypergraph, H_3.\")\n    print(\"\\nA valid star-shaped decomposition is created.
