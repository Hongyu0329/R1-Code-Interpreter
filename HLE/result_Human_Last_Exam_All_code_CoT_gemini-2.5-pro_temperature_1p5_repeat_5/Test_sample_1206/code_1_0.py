# Step 1: Define the numbers for the most appropriate counseling options based on clinical evidence.
# Option II is appropriate (recommending NRT).
# Option III is appropriate (stating that vaping risks are unknown in youth and they should not do it).
option_II = 2
option_III = 3

# Step 2: The best answer choice combines these two key counseling points.
# By reviewing the answer choices, the one that pairs II and III is J.

# Step 3: Display the final logic, showing each number used to form the answer, as requested.
# This is a logical equation demonstrating the selected components.
