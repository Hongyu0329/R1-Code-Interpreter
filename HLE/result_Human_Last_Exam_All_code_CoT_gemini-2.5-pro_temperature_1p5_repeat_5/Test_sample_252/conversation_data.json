    "To solve this problem, we need to understand the principles of computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS).\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The goal is to reconstruct a \"full spectral volume\" from a single 2D image. A spectral volume is a 3D data cube, with two spatial dimensions (x, y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength, λ). We can denote this as `I(x, y, λ)`.\n2.  **Understand the Measurement:** We are limited to a single 2D image captured on a standard camera sensor. This sensor measures intensity at different spatial positions `(u, v)`.\n3.  **Analyze the Role of a Diffraction Grating:** A diffraction grating is an optical element that disperses light according to its wavelength. When an image passes through a single 1D grating, each point source is spread into a line of different colors. This process effectively encodes the spectral information (λ) into spatial information along one axis.\n4.  **Apply Tomography Principles:** Computed tomography works by reconstructing a volume from a series of 2D projections taken at different angles. In our case, the \"volume\" is the 3D data cube `I(x, y, λ)`. A single 1D grating provides only one set of projections (e.g., encoding λ along the x-axis). This is analogous to trying to reconstruct a 3D object from a single X-ray image – it's not possible because you have no depth information.\n5.  **Determine the Minimum Requirement:** To reconstruct the 3D data cube, we need projections from multiple \"angles\". This means we need to disperse the light along more than one axis. Dispersing along a second, independent axis (e.g., the y-axis) provides the second set of projections needed for a tomographic reconstruction. Each dispersion axis requires the action of one grating.\n6.  **Formulate the Calculation:** Therefore, we need at least two independent gratings (or one 2D grating, which functions as two 1D gratings oriented perpendicularly) to generate the minimum data required for reconstruction.\n\nThe script below will formalize this logic.\n\n```python\n# The task is to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings for\n# single-snapshot computed tomography of a spectral volume.\n\n# 1. Define the dimensionality of the object we want to reconstruct.\n# A \"spectral volume\" or \"data cube\" has 2 spatial dimensions (x, y) and 1 spectral dimension (λ).\n# So, the dimensionality of the reconstruction space is 3.\ndimensions_to_reconstruct = 3\nprint(f\"Goal: Reconstruct a data volume with {dimensions_to_reconstruct} dimensions (x, y, λ).\")\n\n# 2. Define the information provided by a single 1D diffraction grating.\n# A single 1D grating provides one axis of spectral dispersion. This creates one set of projections\n# of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor. This is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.\n# It is analogous to having only one projection angle in medical CT.\nprojections_from_one_grating = 1\nprint(f\"A single grating provides only {projections_from_one_grating} set of tomographic projections.\")\n\n# 3. Determine the minimum number of independent projection sets needed.\n# To tomographically reconstruct a volume, we need projections from at least two different angles.\n# To resolve the 3D (x, y, λ) ambiguity, we need to disperse light along two independent axes\n# (e.g., a horizontal axis and a vertical axis).\nrequired_projection_axes = 2\nprint(f\"For tomographic reconstruction, a minimum of {required_projection_axes} independent projection axes are needed.\")\n\n# 4. Calculate the minimum number of gratings.\n# Since each grating provides one fundamental dispersion axis, the minimum number of gratings\n# is the number of required axes.\n# Final Equation: Minimum Gratings = Required Axes\nminimum_gratings = required_projection_axes\nprint(\"\\nFinal equation for the minimum number of gratings:\")\nprint(f\"Minimum Gratings = {minimum_gratings}\")\n\n# Although these gratings can be combined into a single 2D physical component,\n# they are functionally two independent gratings.\n```\n<<<B>>>"
