# The task is to determine the minimum number of diffraction gratings for
# single-snapshot computed tomography of a spectral volume.

# 1. Define the dimensionality of the object we want to reconstruct.
# A "spectral volume" or "data cube" has 2 spatial dimensions (x, y) and 1 spectral dimension (λ).
# So, the dimensionality of the reconstruction space is 3.
dimensions_to_reconstruct = 3
print(f"Goal: Reconstruct a data volume with {dimensions_to_reconstruct} dimensions (x, y, λ).")

# 2. Define the information provided by a single 1D diffraction grating.
# A single 1D grating provides one axis of spectral dispersion. This creates one set of projections
# of the 3D data cube onto the 2D sensor. This is insufficient for tomographic reconstruction.
# It is analogous to having only one projection angle in medical CT.
projections_from_one_grating = 1
print(f"A single grating provides only {projections_from_one_grating} set of tomographic projections.")

# 3. Determine the minimum number of independent projection sets needed.
# To tomographically reconstruct a volume, we need projections from at least two different angles.
# To resolve the 3D (x, y, λ) ambiguity, we need to disperse light along two independent axes
# (e.g., a horizontal axis and a vertical axis).
required_projection_axes = 2
print(f"For tomographic reconstruction, a minimum of {required_projection_axes} independent projection axes are needed.")

# 4. Calculate the minimum number of gratings.
# Since each grating provides one fundamental dispersion axis, the minimum number of gratings
# is the number of required axes.
# Final Equation: Minimum Gratings = Required Axes
minimum_gratings = required_projection_axes
print("\nFinal equation for the minimum number of gratings:")
print(f"Minimum Gratings = {minimum_gratings}")

# Although these gratings can be combined into a single 2D physical component,
# they are functionally two independent gratings.
