    # 1. Define problem parameters.

    # 2. Calculate N (Guaranteed correct guesses in the simultaneous scenario).
    # The optimal strategy assigns each person 'i' to assume the sum of all hat colors
    # (mod num_colors) will be 'i % num_colors'.
    # A person is correct if the actual sum matches their assumed sum.
    # We find the number of people who are correct for each possible actual sum.

    # over all possible hat distributions (and thus all possible sums).

    # 3. Calculate M (Guaranteed correct guesses in the sequential scenario).
    # The first person to speak sees the other (num_people - 1) hats. They calculate
    # the sum of these hats (mod num_colors) and announce it via their own guess.
    # This gives the other (num_people - 1) individuals enough information to deduce
    # their own hat color with certainty.
    M = num_people - 1
