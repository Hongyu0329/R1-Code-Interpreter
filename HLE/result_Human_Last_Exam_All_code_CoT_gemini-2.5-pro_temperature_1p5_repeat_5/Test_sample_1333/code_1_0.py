# Plan:
# 1. Define the Euler characteristic for the base dessin D_N.
#    A genus-2 surface has a specific Euler characteristic.
# 2. Define the Euler characteristic for the covering dessin D.
#    Its genus is related to the base genus and the number of sheets in the cover, |N|.
# 3. Calculate the ratio. We'll demonstrate with |N|=4.

# Let the base dessin D_N be on a surface of genus g_N = 2.
g_N = 2
chi_D_N = 2 - 2 * g_N

# Let's assume a 4-sheeted smooth covering. So, |N| = 4.
N = 4

# The Riemann-Hurwitz formula for an unbranched covering relates the genera:
# g_D - 1 = |N| * (g_N - 1)
g_D = N * (g_N - 1) + 1

# Calculate the Euler characteristic of the covering dessin D.
chi_D = 2 - 2 * g_D

# Calculate the ratio chi(D) / chi(D_N)
ratio = chi_D / chi_D_N

# Output the equation and the result
