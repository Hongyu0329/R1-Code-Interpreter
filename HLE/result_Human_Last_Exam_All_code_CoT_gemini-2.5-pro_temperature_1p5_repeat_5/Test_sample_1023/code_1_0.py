def solve_extinction_rate_factor():
    """
    Calculates how much greater the extinction rate for a morphospecies is
    compared to the extinction rate for an evolutionary species.

    Let's denote the rates as follows:
    - μe: The true extinction rate of an evolutionary species.
    - λe: The true speciation (branching) rate of an evolutionary species.
    - ν: The rate of anagenesis, where one morphospecies is replaced by a new one in the same lineage.
    - μm: The total extinction rate for a morphospecies.

    A morphospecies goes extinct due to:
    1. True extinction (rate: μe).
    2. Bifurcating speciation, where the parent is replaced (rate: 0.5 * λe).
    3. Anagenesis (rate: ν).
    So, μm = μe + 0.5 * λe + ν.

    The key assumption is "all the processes that affect them occur at the same rates".
    This is interpreted to mean the fundamental rates are equal: μe = λe = ν.
    We can set a symbolic base rate to 1 to perform the calculation.
