    "This task is a linguistic question, not a coding one, so a direct answer is the most appropriate. I will provide a text-based answer.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the linguistic origin of the name \"Odobeccus\". The user mentions it is Gaulish. I will verify this.\n2.  Research the historical context of the name to find how it has been transcribed or translated into French over time.\n3.  Provide the most commonly accepted French equivalent.\n\nThe name \"Odobeccus\" is the Latinized version of a name that is actually Frankish (a Germanic language), not Gaulish (a Celtic language). This name belonged to a general in the early 5th century. In French historical contexts, the name is rendered as **Édobich**.\n\n<<<Édobich>>>"
