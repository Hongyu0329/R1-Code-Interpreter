# Given parameters for the S-curve
r = 3
b = 9

# The target false positive rate (probability threshold)
p_threshold = 0.05

# We need to find the similarity threshold 's' by solving the equation:
# 1 - (1 - s^r)^b = p_threshold
#
# Solving for s:
# (1 - s^r)^b = 1 - p_threshold
# 1 - s^r = (1 - p_threshold)^(1/b)
# s^r = 1 - (1 - p_threshold)^(1/b)
# s = (1 - (1 - p_threshold)^(1/b))^(1/r)

s_calculated = (1 - (1 - p_threshold)**(1/b))**(1/r)

# Round the result to three decimal points for the final answer
s_rounded = round(s_calculated, 3)

# Verify the result using the rounded value of s
# This shows the probability for the calculated threshold 's'
p_actual = 1 - (1 - s_rounded**r)**b

# Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers
