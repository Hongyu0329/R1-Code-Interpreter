def solve_dual_topology_problem():

    This function models the iteration of the dual topology operator
    to find the maximum possible number of distinct topologies.

    The problem is a known result in general topology. The sequence of
    topologies T_0, T_1, T_2, ... is generated by T_{n+1} = D(T_n), where
    D is the dual operator.

    The maximal number of distinct topologies is achieved when the sequence
    satisfies the relation T_7 = T_5. This function simulates this
    sequence and counts the number of unique topologies.
