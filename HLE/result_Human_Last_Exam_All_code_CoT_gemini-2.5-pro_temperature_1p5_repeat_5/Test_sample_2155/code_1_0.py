# The riddle combines themes from "The Secret of Flambeau" with a specific quote from "The Queer Feet".
# In "The Queer Feet", Father Brown mentions two seaside resorts while commenting on the trivial conversations of the wealthy.
# These two place names both begin with paired consonants.

place1 = "Broadstairs"
place2 = "Cromer"

print(f"The two place names are {place1} and {place2}.")
