    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering rotational and translational equivalences.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the minimal grid number:** The minimal grid number for a trefoil knot (both left-hand and right-hand) is a known result in knot theory, which is 3. So we are looking for diagrams on a 3x3 grid.\n2.  **Establish a canonical representation:** A grid diagram can be represented by two permutations, `p_x` and `p_o`, which specify the column for the 'X' and 'O' marker in each row, respectively. Any grid diagram can be translated (by relabeling rows and columns) into a canonical form where the X-permutation `p_x` is the identity permutation `(0, 1, 2)`. The knot type is then determined by the O-permutation `p_o`. For the left-hand trefoil (LHT), the canonical O-permutation is `(2, 0, 1)`.\n3.  **Simulate Rotations:** We'll start with the canonical LHT diagram. We will then apply 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations to it.\n4.  **Check for Equivalence:** For each rotated diagram, we will convert it back to its own canonical form. If the canonical form of a rotated diagram is the same as the original canonical form, it means the rotated diagram is equivalent to the original one under translation.\n5.  **Count Distinct Diagrams:** The number of unique canonical forms we find after checking all rotations will be the answer. If all rotations lead back to the same canonical form, the answer is 1.\n\n### Python Implementation:\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It defines functions to handle permutations (inversion, composition) and to simulate the rotation of a grid diagram. It then starts with the canonical left-hand trefoil diagram, rotates it, and counts how many unique (up to translation) diagrams are generated.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef invert_permutation(p):\n    \"\"\"Inverts a permutation given as a list/tuple.\"\"\"\n    inverse = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inverse[val] = i\n    return tuple(inverse)\n\ndef compose_permutations(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations p1 o p2.\"\"\"\n    result = [0] * len(p1)\n    for i in range(len(p1)):\n        result[i] = p1[p2[i]]\n    return tuple(result)\n\ndef rotate_grid_diagram(p_x, p_o, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotates a grid diagram (p_x, p_o) on an n x n grid by 90 degrees clockwise.\n    A point (r, c) moves to (c, n-1-r).\n    This gives the transformation formulas for the permutations:\n    p_x_new = rho * p_o^{-1}\n    p_o_new = rho * p_x\n    Where rho(i) = n-1-i.
