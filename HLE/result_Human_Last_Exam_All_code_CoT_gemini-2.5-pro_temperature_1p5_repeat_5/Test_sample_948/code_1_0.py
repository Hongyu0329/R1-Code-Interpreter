        3: "Correct. The loss process removes doubly-occupied sites. The system evolves to a 'dark state' where no sites are doubly occupied, hence the loss rate becomes zero.",
        4: "Correct. The final state is the many-body ground state of the remaining fermions under an effective Hamiltonian. Such a ground state is generally quantum mechanically entangled.",
        5: "Incorrect. Anti-ferromagnetic alignment ('up, down, up, down...') maximizes the chances for particles on adjacent sites to hop onto each other, which would create a double occupancy and lead to loss. Such states are unstable.",
        6: "Correct. Ferromagnetic alignment (forming domains of 'up, up, up...' and 'down, down, down...') minimizes the chances of creating double occupancies. This 'kinetic ferromagnetism' makes such states long-lived, so they characterize the final quasi-steady state."
