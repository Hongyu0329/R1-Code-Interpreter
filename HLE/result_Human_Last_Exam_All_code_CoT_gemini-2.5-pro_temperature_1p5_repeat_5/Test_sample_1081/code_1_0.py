    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E_8.
    The method involves relating the tori to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding Weyl group.

    # Step 1: State the connection between tori and the Weyl group.
    # The number of F_q-rational maximal tori (up to G(F_q)-conjugacy) in a reductive group G
    # is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.
    # F is the Frobenius endomorphism.
    
    # Step 2: Analyze the Frobenius action on the Weyl group for type E_8.
    # The action of F on W is determined by the symmetries of the Dynkin diagram.
    # The Dynkin diagram of E_8 has no non-trivial automorphisms.
    # This implies that the Frobenius map F acts trivially on the Weyl group W(E_8).

    # Step 3: Simplify the problem due to the trivial Frobenius action.
    # When F acts trivially, an F-conjugacy class is the same as a standard conjugacy class.
    # So, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8).
    
    # Step 4: Use the known mathematical result for the number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8).
    # The number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8) is a known constant in mathematics.
    num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112
    
    # Step 5: Output the result and the final equation.
