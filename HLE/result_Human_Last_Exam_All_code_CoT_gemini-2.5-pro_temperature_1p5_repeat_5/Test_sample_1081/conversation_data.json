    "Here is my plan to determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$.\n\n1.  **Interpret the Question:** The phrase \"number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" is standard terminology in the field of algebraic groups. It refers to the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of maximal tori that are defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The alternative, counting the absolute number of such subgroups, would result in a complex polynomial in $q$, which is not typically what is meant by such a question unless specified.\n\n2.  **Connect to Weyl Groups:** There is a fundamental result in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields that establishes a bijection between the $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori and the $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$, where $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Frobenius Action:** The action of the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ corresponds to the symmetries of the group's Dynkin diagram. For a group of type $E_8$, the Dynkin diagram has no non-trivial automorphisms. This means the Frobenius map acts trivially on the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **Simplify the Problem:** When the Frobenius map acts trivially, the concept of an $F$-conjugacy class simplifies to a standard conjugacy class. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group of type $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$.\n\n5.  **Find the Known Value:** The number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group $W(E_8)$ is a well-established result in mathematics. It has been calculated to be 112. This value is a constant and does not depend on the size $q$ of the finite field.\n\n6.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that codifies this reasoning. The script will not perform a complex calculation but will present the logic and print the final, known answer as requested.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group G of type E_8.\n# The calculation is based on established theorems in the theory of algebraic groups.\n\ndef solve_tori_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori for a group of type E_8.\n    The method involves relating the tori to the conjugacy classes of the corresponding Weyl group.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: State the connection between tori and the Weyl group.\n    # The number of F_q-rational maximal tori (up to G(F_q)-conjugacy) in a reductive group G\n    # is equal to the number of F-conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W.\n    # F is the Frobenius endomorphism.\n    \n    # Step 2: Analyze the Frobenius action on the Weyl group for type E_8.\n    # The action of F on W is determined by the symmetries of the Dynkin diagram.\n    # The Dynkin diagram of E_8 has no non-trivial automorphisms.\n    # This implies that the Frobenius map F acts trivially on the Weyl group W(E_8).\n\n    # Step 3: Simplify the problem due to the trivial Frobenius action.\n    # When F acts trivially, an F-conjugacy class is the same as a standard conjugacy class.\n    # So, the problem reduces to finding the number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8).\n    \n    # Step 4: Use the known mathematical result for the number of conjugacy classes in W(E_8).\n    # The number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group W(E_8) is a known constant in mathematics.\n    num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n    \n    # Step 5: Output the result and the final equation.\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a reductive group of type E_8\")\n    print(\"is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group, W(E_8).\")\n    print(\"\\nThis number is a known mathematical constant, independent of q.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    # The equation simply states the result. We print the number 112 involved.\n    print(f\"Number of F_q-rational maximal tori = {num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8}\")\n\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nsolve_tori_number()\n\n```\n<<<112>>>"
