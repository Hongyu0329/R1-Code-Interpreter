    "To solve the Prisoner's Dilemma in a quantum space, we use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol. This framework introduces quantum phenomena, like entanglement and superposition, into the classical game.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Game Setup**: We start with a 2-qubit system, where each player controls one qubit. The crucial step is to \"design the initial state\" by preparing the qubits in a maximally entangled state. This shared entanglement is what allows for outcomes not possible in the classical game.\n2.  **Quantum Strategies**: Instead of classical choices (Cooperate or Defect), players apply a quantum operation (a unitary transformation) to their qubit. The set of available strategies is much larger, including the classical choices as special cases.\n3.  **Equilibrium**: We will find a pair of quantum strategies that form a Nash Equilibrium. A Nash Equilibrium is a state where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n4.  **Payoff Calculation**: After players apply their strategies, a measurement is performed on the quantum state. The outcome of the measurement collapses the state into one of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD), and payoffs are assigned according to the given matrix.\n\n### Solution\nFor the given payoff matrix `[[(5,5), (0,7)], [(7,0), (1,1)]]`, there exists a quantum strategy, let's call it **Q**, that leads to a new, optimal equilibrium. This strategy corresponds to the quantum gate `U(0, Ï€/2)`, which is equivalent to `i` times the Pauli-Z gate.\n\nWhen both players adopt the strategy **Q** in a maximally entangled game:\n*   The final state of the game deterministically becomes `|Cooperate, Cooperate>`.\n*   This means the probability of mutual cooperation `P(CC)` is 1, and the probabilities of all other outcomes are 0.\n*   This new strategy profile `(Q, Q)` forms a stable Nash Equilibrium because any player who unilaterally deviates from **Q** will not get a better payoff. The dilemma of the classical game is resolved.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the payoffs at this quantum equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_quantum_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the payoffs for the Prisoner's Dilemma at the quantum Nash Equilibrium.\n\n    In the quantum version of the game using the EWL protocol with maximal entanglement,\n    a new equilibrium strategy Q emerges.
