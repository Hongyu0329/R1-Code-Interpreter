The laboratory's mistake was believing the result of a flawed Quality Control (QC) test. Their QC organism (*Bacillus subtilis*) was likely too weak from extensive subculturing to grow on the Potato Dextrose Agar. This caused a "no growth" result on Batch 3's plate, which the lab misinterpreted as successful bacterial inhibition. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 was inactive because it had been destroyed by autoclaving, and the QC test failed to reveal this defect.
