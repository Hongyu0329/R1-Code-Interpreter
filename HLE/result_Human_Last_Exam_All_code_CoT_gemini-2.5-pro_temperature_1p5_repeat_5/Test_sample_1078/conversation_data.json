    "This is a combinatorial problem based on the classification of finite Weyl groups. A finite Weyl group is a direct product of irreducible Weyl groups. The rank of the product is the sum of the ranks of its irreducible factors. Therefore, we need to find all the ways to partition the number 4 into a sum of ranks of irreducible Weyl groups.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  List the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  Consider all possible partitions of the number 4:\n    *   4\n    *   3 + 1\n    *   2 + 2\n    *   2 + 1 + 1\n    *   1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n3.  For each partition, count the number of ways to form a Weyl group by selecting irreducible components with the corresponding ranks.\n4.  Sum the counts for all partitions to get the total number of non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out this plan, enumerating the possibilities for each case.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_weyl_groups_rank_4():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we must consider all partitions of the number 4.\")\n    print(\"Each part in the partition corresponds to the rank of an irreducible Weyl group.\\n\")\n\n    # Non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups for each rank\n    # Note: B_n is isomorphic to C_n.
