    "To find the largest natural number `n` such that the `(2n)`-th K-group of `Z/27` is non-zero, we must first understand the structure of these algebraic K-groups.\n\n**Step-by-step Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical formula:** The calculation of the algebraic K-groups of rings like `Z/m` is a deep result in algebraic K-theory. For the ring `Z/p^k` where `p` is an odd prime, the `p`-primary components of its K-groups were computed by Hesselholt and Madsen. Their result states that for `n >= 1`:\n    `K_{2n}(Z/p^k) \\cong Z/p^{v_p(n)}`\n    Here, `v_p(n)` is the `p`-adic valuation of `n`, which is the exponent of the highest power of `p` that divides `n`.\n\n2.  **Apply the formula to our specific case:** We are interested in `Z/27`, so `p=3` and `k=3`. The formula becomes:\n    `K_{2n}(Z/27) \\cong Z/3^{v_3(n)}`\n\n3.  **Analyze the condition for the K-group to be non-zero:** A group `Z/m` is non-zero if and only if `m > 1`. In our case, `Z/3^{v_3(n)}` is non-zero if and only if the exponent `v_3(n)` is greater than 0. This is true if and only if `n` is a multiple of 3.\n\n4.  **Address the \"largest n\" part of the question:** The formula implies that `K_{2n}(Z/27)` is non-zero for any `n` that is a multiple of 3 (e.g., n=3, 6, 9, 12, ...). Since there is no largest multiple of 3, there is no largest `n` for which the group is non-zero under the standard interpretation of the formula. This suggests the question, as stated, might be ill-posed or is assuming an implicit context.\n\n5.  **Propose a reasonable assumption to solve the problem:** In mathematical problems, especially from contests or textbooks, an implicit bound related to the numbers in the problem is often assumed. The most natural assumption here is that `n` is bounded by the modulus, 27. We will therefore search for the largest natural number `n < 27` that satisfies the condition.\n\n6.  **Find the solution under the assumption:** We need to find the largest natural number `n < 27` such that `n` is a multiple of 3. This number is clearly 24. For `n=24`, `v_3(24) = v_3(3 * 8) = 1`, so `K_{48}(Z/27) \\cong Z/3^1 = Z/3`, which is non-zero. For any larger `n < 27` (i.e., 25, 26), `n` is not a multiple of 3, so the corresponding K-group is zero.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find `n`.\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest natural number n under an assumed bound such that the\n    (2n)th K-group of Z/27 is non-zero.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to modern results in algebraic K-theory, the group K_{2n}(Z/27) is\n    # isomorphic to Z/(3^v_3(n)), where v_3(n) is the 3-adic valuation of n.\n    # This group is non-zero if and only if n is a multiple of 3.\n    # The question for the \"largest\" n suggests an implicit upper bound, which we\n    # assume to be related to the modulus, 27.
