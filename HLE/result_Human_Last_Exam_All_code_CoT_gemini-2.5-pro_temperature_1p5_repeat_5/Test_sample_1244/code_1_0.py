    # Part (a)
    # An even unimodular lattice must have a rank that is a multiple of 8.
    # 12 is not a multiple of 8, so no such lattice exists.
    answer_a = "No"

    # Part (b)
    # The existence of a vector x with x.x=6 would satisfy the conditions.
    # A vector x with norm 6 is 3-primitive because (x/3).(x/3) = 6/9 = 2/3, which is not an integer.
    # Its norm is a multiple of 6. The condition that far(L)=3 requires a norm 9 vector but
    # does not preclude a norm 6 vector. Thus, it is possible.
    answer_b = "yes"

    # Part (c)
    # The lattice L is the Niemeier lattice with root system D_24. L = D_24 U (h + D_24).
    # The intersection K = L intersect Z^24 is D_24.
    # The index [L : K] = 2.
    # The index [Z^24 : K] = 2.
    # Since the indices match and are equal to 2, L is a 2-neighbor of Z^24.
    # d cannot be 1 as L is even and Z^24 is odd.
    # So the smallest d is 2.
