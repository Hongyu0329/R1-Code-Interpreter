    "This line of Latin poetry comes from the Roman playwright Plautus. It does not follow the common dactylic hexameter but rather a meter called Iambic Octonarius, which is a line of eight iambic feet. In this meter, other types of feet can be substituted for the iamb (short-long), and elision (the dropping of a vowel at the end of a word before another vowel) is not always observed.\n\nHere is the step-by-step scansion:\n1.  **Syllabification and Foot Division**: The line is divided into 15 syllables, which form 8 metrical feet. A notable feature here is **hiatus** (a pause between two adjacent vowels across words, without elision) between `bene` and `esse`.\n    *   `et ti` | `bi be` | `ne es` | `se so` | `li quom` | `si bi` | `sit ma` | `le`\n2.  **Determining Syllable Length (Quantity)**:\n    *   `et`: Long by position (it's a \"closed\" syllable, as the vowel `e` is followed by a consonant `t` at the end of the syllabic unit).\n    *   `ti-bi`: Both syllables are naturally short.\n    *   `be-ne`: Both syllables are naturally short.\n    *   `es-se`: The first syllable, `es`, is long by position (the vowel `e` is followed by two consonants `ss`). The second syllable, `se`, is short.\n    *   `so-li`: In the context of \"you alone\" (`solus`), both syllables (`sō-lī`) are long by nature.\n    *   `quom`: Long by position (the vowel `o` is followed by `m` before a consonant).\n    *   `si-bi`: Both syllables are naturally short.\n    *   `sit`: Long by position (the vowel `i` is followed by `t` before a consonant).\n    *   `ma-le`: Both syllables are naturally short.\n\nThis analysis produces the following metrical pattern of Long (L) and Short (S) syllables for each foot:\n\n*   **Foot 1 (`et ti`)**: L S (Trochee)\n*   **Foot 2 (`bi be`)**: S S (Pyrrhic)\n*   **Foot 3 (`ne es`)**: S L (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 4 (`se so`)**: S L (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 5 (`li quom`)**: L L (Spondee)\n*   **Foot 6 (`si bi`)**: S S (Pyrrhic)\n*   **Foot 7 (`sit ma`)**: L S (Iamb)\n*   **Foot 8 (`le`)**: S (Incomplete final foot)\n\nThe following Python code will print the line divided into its metrical feet, with the scansion pattern below it.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the scansion of a line from Plautus.\n    L = Long syllable\n    S = Short syllable\n    \"\"\"\n    line_by_feet = \"et ti | bi be | ne es | se so | li quom | si bi | sit ma | le\"\n    scansion = \"L S  | S S  | S L  | S L  | L L   | S S   | L S   | S\"\n    \n    print(\"Scansion of the line: 'et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male'\")\n    print(\"-\" * 65)\n    print(\"Syllables grouped by feet:\")\n    print(line_by_feet)\n    print(\"\\nMetrical pattern (L = Long, S = Short):\")\n    print(scansion)\n\nscan_latin_line()\n<<<L S | S S | S L | S L | L L | S S | L S | S>>>\n```"
