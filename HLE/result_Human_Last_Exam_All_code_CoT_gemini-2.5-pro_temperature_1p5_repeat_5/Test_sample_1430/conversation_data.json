    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that walks through the derivation and calculates the smallest and largest possible ranks for the Néron-Severi group of X.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Relate X to the Jacobian of C**: The key insight is that for a large degree $d$, the symmetric power $X=C^{(d)}$ is a projective bundle over the Jacobian of the curve, $J(C)$. This simplifies the problem of finding the rank of the Néron-Severi group, $\\rho(X)$. The formula is $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n2.  **Verify the condition**: Check if the degree $d=15$ is large enough for the formula to apply to a genus $g=3$ curve. The condition is $d > 2g - 2$.\n3.  **Find the smallest rank**: Determine the minimum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$. This occurs for a \"generic\" curve $C$, where its Jacobian has the minimal possible number of endomorphisms.\n4.  **Find the largest rank**: Determine the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$. This occurs for highly specialized curves $C$ whose Jacobians have complex multiplication (CM). We'll consider the cases where $J(C)$ is simple and where it splits into a product of elliptic curves.\n5.  **Calculate the final ranks for X**: Use the results from steps 3 and 4 along with the formula from step 1 to find the smallest and largest ranks for $X$.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_riemann_surface_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X\n\n    print(f\"We are considering a curve C of genus g = {g}, and its {d}th symmetric power X = C^({d}).\")\n    print(\"Our goal is to find the smallest and largest possible ranks of the Néron-Severi group of X, denoted ρ(X).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the formula relating ρ(X) to ρ(J(C))\n    print(\"--- Step 1: The key formula ---\")\n    print(\"For a symmetric power C^(d), when the degree d is sufficiently large (d > 2g - 2),\")\n    print(\"the variety C^(d) is a projective bundle over the Jacobian of the curve, J(C).\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Néron-Severi group is then given by: ρ(C^(d)) = ρ(J(C)) + 1.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Verify the condition\n    print(\"--- Step 2: Verifying the condition ---\")\n    condition_rhs = 2 * g - 2\n    print(f\"For our case, g = {g} and d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The condition is d > 2*g - 2, which is {d} > 2*{g} - 2, or {d} > {condition_rhs}.\")\n    if d > condition_rhs:\n        print(\"This condition is true, so the formula is applicable.\\n\")\n    else:\n        print(\"This condition is false.
