    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Understand the Group Structure:** The generalized quaternion group $Q_{4n}$ is defined by the presentation $\\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n}=1, x^n=y^2, y^{-1}xy=x^{-1} \\rangle$. For $|Q_{128}|=128$, we have $4n=128$, so $n=32$. The group is $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64}=1, x^{32}=y^2, y^{-1}xy=x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    *   The elements of $Q_{128}$ can be uniquely written as $x^i y^j$ where $0 \\leq i < 64$ and $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup is a subgroup $H$ for which there exists an integer $k$ such that $H$ is equal to the set of all $k$-th powers of elements in the group, i.e., $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$.\n\n3.  **Identify Which Powers to Check:** The exponent of a group $G$, $\\exp(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $g^m=1$ for all $g \\in G$. For any integer $k$, the power set $G^k$ is identical to $G^{\\gcd(k, \\exp(G))}$. The exponent of $Q_{128}$ is 64. Thus, we only need to compute $G^k$ for each $k$ that is a divisor of 64. The divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.\n\n4.  **Implement the Calculation:** We will write a Python script to:\n    a. Represent the elements of $Q_{128}$ and define the group multiplication and exponentiation operations.\n    b. Generate all 128 elements of the group.\n    c. For each divisor `k` of 64, compute the set $G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in Q_{128}\\}$.\n    d. Collect all unique sets $G^k$ found. Since these sets must be subgroups as per the problem's definition, we just count the number of unique sets.\n\n5.  **Count and Output the Result:** The script will print the size of the power subgroup found for each divisor `k` and then output the total count of unique power subgroups.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nclass Q128Element:\n    \"\"\"\n    Represents an element of the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    An element is of the form x^i * y^j, where n=32 for Q_128.\n    x^(2n)=1, y^2=x^n, y*x*y^(-1) = x^(-1)\n    Here, 2n = 64, n = 32.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, i, j):\n        # x^i y^j\n        self.i = i % 64\n        self.j = j % 2\n        self.n = 32\n\n    def __mul__(self, other):\n        # (x^i1 y^j1) * (x^i2 y^j2)\n        if self.j == 0:\n            # x^i1 * x^i2 * y^j2 = x^(i1+i2) * y^j2\n            return Q128Element(self.i + other.i, other.j)\n        else: # self.j == 1\n            # x^i1 * y * x^i2 * y^j2\n            # using y * x^k = x^(-k) * y\n            # x^i1 * x^(-i2) * y * y^j2 = x^(i1-i2) * y^(1+j2)\n            new_i = self.i - other.i\n            new_j = 1 + other.j\n            if new_j == 2:\n                # y^2 = x^n\n                new_i += self.n\n                new_j = 0\n            return Q128Element(new_i, new_j)\n\n    def __pow__(self, k):\n        # Fast exponentiation\n        if k == 0:\n            return Q128Element(0, 0) # Identity element\n        if k < 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Negative power not implemented for this group.\")\n            \n        res = Q128Element(0, 0) # Start with identity\n        base = self\n        while k > 0:\n            if k % 2 == 1:\n                res = res * base\n            base = base * base\n            k //= 2\n        return res\n        \n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        return self.i == other.i and self.j == other.j\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.i, self.j))\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        if self.j == 0:\n            return f\"x^{self.i}\"\n        else:\n            if self.i == 0:\n                return \"y\"\n            return f\"x^{self.i}y\"\n\ndef get_power_subgroups_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups for Q128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Generate all elements of Q128\n    G = []\n    for i in range(64):\n        for j in range(2):\n            G.append(Q128Element(i, j))\n\n    # The exponent of Q128 is 64.
