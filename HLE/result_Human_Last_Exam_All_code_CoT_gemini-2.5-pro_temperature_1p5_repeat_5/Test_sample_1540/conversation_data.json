    "Of course, I can help you with this problem. Here is my plan to arrive at the most memory-efficient C program and calculate its variable memory usage.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Task:** The core of the problem is a case-insensitive lexicographical comparison of two strings of the same length.\n2.  **Memory Optimization Strategy:** A standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays. However, to be memory-efficient, we can avoid storing the second string completely. The optimal strategy is to:\n    *   Read the first string into a character array (a buffer). This is necessary because we need to access its characters to compare against the second string.\n    *   Read the second string one character at a time.\n    *   As each character of the second string is read, immediately compare it with the corresponding character from the buffered first string.\n3.  **Data Type Selection:** To further minimize memory, we must choose the smallest possible data types for our variables.\n    *   The buffer for the first string needs to hold up to 100 characters plus a null terminator, so `char s1[101]` is the minimum required size. This uses **101 bytes**.\n    *   The loop index `i` only needs to count up to 100. A `char` type variable can hold values up to 127, making it sufficient for this purpose instead of a 4-byte `int`. This uses **1 byte**.\n    *   The variable to hold a single character from the second string only needs to hold one character at a time, so a `char` is perfect. This uses **1 byte**.\n4.  **Calculate Total Memory (m):** The total memory `m` used by the program's variables will be the sum of the sizes of these variables.\n\n    `m = sizeof(s1) + sizeof(i) + sizeof(c2)`\n    `m = 101 bytes + 1 byte + 1 byte = 103 bytes`\n\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write the C code implementing this memory-efficient strategy. The code will read the first string, then loop through it while reading the second string character-by-character for comparison.\n\nHere is the most memory-efficient C program to solve the problem.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This C program solves the problem with maximum memory efficiency.\n * It reads the first string into a buffer, and then reads the\n * second string one character at a time to avoid storing both strings\n * in memory.\n *\n * Memory usage for variables is calculated as follows:\n * - char s1[101]: A buffer for the first string (max 100 chars + '\\0'). Size = 101 bytes.\n * - char i: A loop index. A char is sufficient as the length <= 100. Size = 1 byte.\n * - char c2: A variable to hold one character from the second string. Size = 1 byte.\n * Total memory (m) = 101 + 1 + 1 = 103 bytes.\n */\nint main() {\n    // A buffer to store the first string. 101 bytes.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // Read the first string from input.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // Loop index. Using 'char' instead of 'int' to save memory. 1 byte.\n    char i = 0;\n    // Variable for the current character of the second string. 1 byte.\n    char c2;\n\n    // Loop until we reach the end of the first string.\n    while (s1[i] != '\\0') {\n        // Read a single character for the second string,\n        // the leading space in \" %c\" skips any whitespace (like the newline\n        // after the first string was entered).\n        scanf(\" %c\", &c2);\n\n        // Convert both characters to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.\n        char lower_s1 = tolower(s1[i]);\n        char lower_c2 = tolower(c2);\n\n        // Perform the comparison.\n        if (lower_s1 < lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is smaller, exit.\n        }\n        if (lower_s1 > lower_c2) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // First string is larger, exit.\n        }\n        \n        // Characters are equal, move to the next one.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop completes, the strings are equal.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n<<<103>>>"
