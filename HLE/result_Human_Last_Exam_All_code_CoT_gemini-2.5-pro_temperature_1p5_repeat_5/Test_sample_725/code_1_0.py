    """
    Analyzes and compares the covalency of CeF6(2-) and CeCl6(2-)
    based on the principle of orbital overlap.
    """

    # --- Principle ---
    print("Principle: The strength of covalency in a chemical bond is directly proportional to the extent of orbital overlap between the atoms. Greater orbital overlap allows for more effective electron sharing, which by definition means stronger covalency.")

    # --- Illustrative Model ---
    # The problem states CeF6(2-) has greater orbital overlap than CeCl6(2-).
    # We will assign illustrative numerical values to model this.
    overlap_CeF6 = 0.8  # A higher value to represent greater overlap
    overlap_CeCl6 = 0.5  # A lower value to represent lesser overlap
    
    # We can model the relationship with a simple pseudo-equation:
    # Covalency Score = k * Orbital Overlap
    # For simplicity, we'll set the proportionality constant k to 1.0.
    k = 1.0

    # Calculate the illustrative covalency scores
    covalency_score_CeF6 = k * overlap_CeF6
    covalency_score_CeCl6 = k * overlap_CeCl6

    print("\nIllustrative Calculation:")
    print("Let's use the equation: Covalency Score = k * Orbital Overlap, with k = 1.0")

    # --- Outputting the final equations with numbers ---
    print(f"\nFor CeF6(2-), with a relative overlap of {overlap_CeF6}:")
    print(f"Covalency Score = {k} * {overlap_CeF6} = {covalency_score_CeF6}")

    print(f"\nFor CeCl6(2-), with a relative overlap of {overlap_CeCl6}:")
    print(f"Covalency Score = {k} * {overlap_CeCl6} = {covalency_score_CeCl6}")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("\nConclusion:")
    print(f"Since the calculated covalency score for CeF6(2-) ({covalency_score_CeF6}) is greater than for CeCl6(2-) ({covalency_score_CeCl6}), it demonstrates that CeF6(2-) would display stronger covalency.")
