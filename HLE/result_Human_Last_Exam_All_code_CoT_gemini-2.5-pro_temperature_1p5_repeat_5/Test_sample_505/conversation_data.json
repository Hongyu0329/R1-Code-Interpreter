    "To solve this, we first need to understand how logical qubits are encoded in a surface code. For a single, planar patch of surface code (a 2D grid of physical qubits), the number of logical qubits it can encode is determined by its topology, specifically the number of \"holes\" or \"defects\" created in it.\n\nThe formula is straightforward:\n*   A single planar surface code patch with `h` holes can encode `k = h` logical qubits.\n\nThe problem states we have two separate, identical patches. To find the total number of logical qubits, we can calculate the number for one patch and then multiply by the number of patches.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Determine the number of logical qubits for a single patch with two holes using the formula `k = h`.\n2.  Multiply this number by the total number of patches (which is two).\n3.  Print the final calculation and result.\n\n```python\n# Number of independent surface code patches\nnum_patches = 2\n\n# Number of holes in each patch\nnum_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n# The number of logical qubits (k) that can be encoded in a single\n# planar surface code patch is equal to the number of holes (h).\n# Formula: k = h\nlogical_qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n# For multiple independent patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum\n# of the qubits from each patch. Since they are identical, we multiply.\ntotal_logical_qubits = num_patches * logical_qubits_per_patch\n\nprint(f\"Number of logical qubits per patch with {num_holes_per_patch} holes: {logical_qubits_per_patch}\")\nprint(\"Total number of logical qubits for two such patches is the sum of the qubits from each.\")\nprint(\"The final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{logical_qubits_per_patch} + {logical_qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"
