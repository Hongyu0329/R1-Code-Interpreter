    "To find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the System's Equilibria**: First, I'll find the equilibrium points of the system by setting both differential equations to zero. These are the points in the phase plane where the system is at rest.\n2.  **Classify the Equilibria**: I'll compute the Jacobian matrix of the system and evaluate it at each equilibrium point. The eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix will allow me to classify each point (e.g., as a source, a sink, or a saddle).\n3.  **Identify the Separatrix**: Separatrices are special trajectories that separate regions of different long-term behavior. They are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points. After identifying a saddle point, I'll look for the equation of its manifolds.\n4.  **Find the Equation**: Finding an explicit formula for a manifold can be complex. It requires solving the differential equation that governs the trajectories in the phase plane, which is $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$. This results in a Riccati equation. Instead of solving it in general, I will search for a simple polynomial solution of the form $d=f(u)$.\n5.  **Verify the Solution**: Once a candidate equation for the separatrix is found, I'll confirm that it passes through the saddle point.\n6.  **Provide a Verification Script**: Finally, I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to programmatically verify that the found equation is indeed a valid trajectory of the system. This script will substitute the solution back into the trajectory's differential equation and show that it holds true. It will also print the final equation of the separatrix and its constituent numbers as requested.\n\nHere is the step-by-step mathematical derivation:\n\nThe system is:\n$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)$\n$u'(t) = u^2(u - 1)$\n\n**Step 1 & 2: Find and Classify Equilibria**\nSetting $u' = 0$ gives $u^2(u-1)=0$, so $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n*   If $u=0$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n*   If $u=1$, the first equation becomes $2d^2 + (5-3)d = 0 \\implies 2d(d+1)=0$, so $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives the equilibrium points **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\nBy analyzing the Jacobian matrix at these points, we find that (0, 1) is an unstable node (a source) and **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**. The point (0, 0) is non-hyperbolic, meaning its stability cannot be determined by linearization alone.\n\n**Step 3 & 4: Find the Separatrix Equation**\nThe separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of the saddle point (-1, 1). To find their equation, we look for an invariant curve $d=f(u)$ that satisfies the trajectory equation:\n$\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2 - 3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u - 1)}$\n\nBy testing for a polynomial solution of the form $d = au^2 + bu + c$, and substituting it into the equation, we can solve for the coefficients $a, b, c$. This analysis yields two possible invariant curves: $d = u-u^2$ and $d = -u^2$.\n\n**Step 5: Verify the Solution**\nWe must check which of these curves passes through the saddle point (-1, 1).\n*   For $d = u-u^2$: at $u=1$, $d=1-1^2=0$. This curve passes through (0, 1), the source.\n*   For $d = -u^2$: at $u=1$, $d=-(1)^2=-1$. This curve passes through **(-1, 1)**, the saddle point.\n\nThus, the separatrix associated with the saddle point is given by the equation $d = -u^2$. This curve represents the unstable manifold of the saddle point.\n\n**Step 6: Python Verification Script**\nThe following Python code verifies this result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_separatrix():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function verifies the analytical solution for the separatrix of the given system of ODEs.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define symbolic variables\n    d_var, u_var = sympy.symbols('d u')\n\n    # Define the functions F and G from the system d'=F(d,u), u'=G(d,u)\n    F = 2*d_var**2 + (-3*u_var + 5*u_var**2)*d_var - u_var**3*(1-u_var)\n    G = (u_var-1)*u_var**2\n\n    print(\"The system of differential equations is:\")\n    print(\"d'(t) = 2*d^2 + (-3*u + 5*u^2)*d - u^3*(1 - u)\")\n    print(\"u'(t) = (u - 1)*u^2\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"We are looking for a separatrix, which is a special trajectory of the system.\")\n    print(\"From analytical calculations, the saddle point is at (d, u) = (-1, 1).\")\n    print(\"The separatrix is an invariant curve passing through the saddle point.\")\n    print(\"Our candidate solution is d = -u^2.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Proposed separatrix equation\n    separatrix_candidate = -u_var**2\n    \n    print(f\"To verify the candidate d = {sympy.pretty(separatrix_candidate)}, we check if it satisfies the trajectory equation dd/du = F/G.\")\n\n    # 1.
