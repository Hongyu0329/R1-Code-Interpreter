    "To find `a(10)`, the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice, I will write a Python script to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Recursive Backtracking:** I will implement a recursive function to explore all possible walk paths. The function will navigate the 2D grid, extending the current path one step at a time.\n2.  **Self-Avoiding Constraint:** To ensure the walks are \"self-avoiding,\" the function will keep track of all points visited in the current path using a `set` for efficient lookups. Any move to an already visited point will be invalid.\n3.  **Symmetry Optimization:** A square lattice is symmetric. The number of walks starting with a step in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) is identical. Therefore, I can calculate the number of walks for just one starting direction (e.g., right, from (0,0) to (1,0)) and multiply that result by 4 to get the total count. This significantly reduces the computation time.\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The script will be set to find the number of walks of length n=10 and will print the final calculation showing how the symmetry principle is applied.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a \n    Manhattan (2D square) lattice.\n\n    The method uses a recursive backtracking algorithm. A walk starts at (0,0) \n    and explores all possible paths of a given length, ensuring no point is \n    visited more than once.\n\n    To optimize the calculation, we use the symmetry of the square lattice. The \n    total number of walks is 4 times the number of walks that start with a \n    step in a specific direction (e.g., from (0,0) to (1,0)). The recursion \n    then calculates the number of remaining 9-step walks starting from (1,0).\n    \"\"\"\n    # The desired number of steps for the walk.\n    n = 10\n    \n    # We increase the recursion limit as a safeguard for deep recursive calls,\n    # though Python's default limit is usually sufficient for n=10.\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(2000)\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(pos, visited, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n\n        Args:\n            pos (tuple): The current (x, y) position.\n            visited (set): A set of visited (x, y) position tuples.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining to take.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: if no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        x, y = pos\n        count = 0\n        \n        # Explore the 4 possible neighbor positions.\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n            \n            # If the neighbor has not been visited, explore from there.\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                count += count_walks_recursive(next_pos, visited, steps_left - 1)\n                visited.remove(next_pos)  # Backtrack to explore other paths.\n        \n        return count\n\n    # Using the symmetry optimization:\n    # We calculate the number of walks for one initial direction and multiply by 4.\n    # Initial state for recursion:\n    # - Start at (0,0), take the first step to (1,0).\n    # - The path now contains (0,0) and (1,0).\n    # - There are n-1 = 9 steps left to take.\n    \n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    first_step_pos = (1, 0)\n    initial_visited = {start_pos, first_step_pos}\n    steps_remaining = n - 1\n    \n    # Calculate the number of walks for one initial direction.\n    walks_one_direction = count_walks_recursive(\n        first_step_pos, initial_visited, steps_remaining\n    )\n\n    # The total number of walks is 4 times this amount.\n    total_walks = 4 * walks_one_direction\n    \n    # Print the final result in an equation format.\n    print(f\"To find a(10), we count the walks starting in one direction and multiply by 4.\")\n    print(f\"Number of 10-step walks starting with a step to the right: {walks_one_direction}\")\n    print(f\"a(10) = 4 * {walks_one_direction} = {total_walks}\")\n\nsolve_saw_count()\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
