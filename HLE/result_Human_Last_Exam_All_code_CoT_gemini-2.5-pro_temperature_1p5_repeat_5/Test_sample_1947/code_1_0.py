    This function provides the coefficients for the number of closed tree-like walks of length 6.
    
    The number of closed tree-like walks of length 6 in a simple graph X is given by:
    c_1 * e + c_2 * k + c_3 * p + c_4 * sum(deg(v) choose 2) + c_5 * sum(deg(v) choose 3)
    
    where:
    - e is the number of edges
    - k is the number of K_3 subgraphs (triangles)
    - p is the number of P_4 subgraphs (paths of length 3)
    - deg(v) is the degree of vertex v

    The coefficients are derived by classifying all such walks by the structure of the tree
    formed by their unique edges. The number of unique edges can be 1, 2, or 3.
