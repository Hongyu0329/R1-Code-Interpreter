    Given the strong suspicion for Neurosarcoidosis, we must identify its characteristic imaging finding:

    - Choice A (Periarticular bone demineralization) is typical for rheumatoid arthritis.
    - Choice B (Leptomeningeal enhancement with 'snowball' hyperintensities visualized by MRI) is a classic finding of neurosarcoidosis, where granulomatous inflammation affects the lining of the brain.
    - Choice C (Pleural effusion) is an uncommon finding in pulmonary sarcoidosis.
    - Choice D (Vascular hemorrhage) is not a typical feature of sarcoidosis.
    - Choice E (Intrasellar mass) would not explain the patient's multi-system disease.

    Conclusion: The most expected finding is on an MRI of the brain, consistent with neurosarcoidosis.
