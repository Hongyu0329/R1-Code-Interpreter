    "Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician, was a critic of modernist art movements which he saw as decadent and detached from social purpose. The \"stagnant swamp\" he referred to was the influential Russian art movement and magazine known as **\"Mir iskusstva\"** or **\"World of Art\"**.\n\nTo provide a computational task related to this, I will write a Python script to calculate Pavel Milyukov's age when the \"World of Art\" movement held its first exhibition.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define a variable for Pavel Milyukov's birth year (1859).\n2.  Define a variable for the year of the first \"World of Art\" exhibition (1898).\n3.  Calculate the difference between the two years to determine his age at the time.\n4.  Print the full equation, including all the numbers, to show the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_age_at_event():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints Pavel Milyukov's age\n    at the start of the \"World of Art\" movement.\n    \"\"\"\n    milyukov_birth_year = 1859\n    world_of_art_start_year = 1898\n\n    # Calculate Milyukov's age at the time of the first exhibition\n    age_at_event = world_of_art_start_year - milyukov_birth_year\n\n    print(\"Calculating Pavel Milyukov's age when the 'World of Art' movement began in 1898.\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Equation: {world_of_art_start_year} - {milyukov_birth_year} = {age_at_event}\")\n    print(f\"Pavel Milyukov was {age_at_event} years old.\")\n\ncalculate_age_at_event()\n```\n<<<World of Art>>>"
