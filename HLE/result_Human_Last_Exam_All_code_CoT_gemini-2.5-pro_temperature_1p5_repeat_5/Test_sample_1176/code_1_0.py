    Evaluates a series of geological statements about the North American Cordillera
    and returns a string representing whether each is consensus (C) or debated (D).
    
    The analysis for each statement is as follows:
    (1) Consensus: Morrison formation as a foredeep deposit is a standard interpretation.
    (2) Debated: Cause of metamorphic core complexes (slab window is one of several competing hypotheses).
    (3) Debated: Existence and scale of the "Nevadaplano" are not settled.
    (4) Debated: "Arizonaplano" via magmatic thickening is a debated model.
    (5) Consensus: The spatial distribution of Sevier (outboard) vs. Laramide (inboard) structures is a fundamental observation.
    (6) Consensus: The origin of the major batholiths from the ancestral Cordilleran arc is a cornerstone concept.
    (7) Consensus: The southwestward propagation of Eocene-present volcanism (Yellowstone hotspot track) is well-established.
    (8) Debated: The uplift timing and mechanism of the Colorado Plateau is a classic, unresolved debate.
    (9) Debated: The modern High Cascades are much younger than the Oligocene, making the statement's timing contentious.
    (10) Debated: Attributing the Laramide orogeny to the Shatsky conjugate specifically is a debated hypothesis, not a consensus.
