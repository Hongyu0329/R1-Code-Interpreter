# This is a multiple-choice question.
# The user wants me to identify the best description of the local population's views
# during the 1907 Kingston earthquake incident.

# As determined by the step-by-step analysis:
# A is a plausible secondary concern, but not the primary driver of their actions.
# B and D introduce irrelevant points about Canada.
# E is too extreme; a desire for aid is not a desire for annexation.
# C accurately reflects their actions: they appealed to the British government to fix the problem,
# acting as loyal subjects who preferred their own (improved) colonial system to American intervention.

# Therefore, C is the best answer.

final_answer = "C"
