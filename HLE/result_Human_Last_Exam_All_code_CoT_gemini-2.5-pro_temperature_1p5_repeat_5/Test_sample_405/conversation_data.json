    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I will identify the main, visually distinct allotropes of pure phosphorus based on established chemical knowledge.\n2.  The primary allotropes are White phosphorus (which is white or yellowish), Red phosphorus, Violet phosphorus, and Black phosphorus.\n3.  I will write a Python script that lists these allotropes and their corresponding colors.\n4.  The script will then count these distinct color variations.\n5.  To meet the requirement of showing the \"equation,\" the script will print a representation of the sum, showing that each color contributes one to the total count, before printing the final result.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of distinct colors\n    observed in the common pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The primary, distinctively colored allotropes of phosphorus are:\n    # 1. White Phosphorus (can also be yellowish)\n    # 2. Red Phosphorus\n    # 3. Violet Phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus)\n    # 4. Black Phosphorus (the most thermodynamically stable form)\n    \n    allotropes = {\n        \"White/Yellow\": 1,\n        \"Red\": 1,\n        \"Violet\": 1,\n        \"Black\": 1\n    }\n\n    print(\"The common allotropes of phosphorus and their colors are:\")\n    for color in allotropes:\n        print(f\"- {color} phosphorus\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTo count the total number of colors, we can form an equation:\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string from the numbers\n    numbers = list(allotropes.values())\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    \n    equation_string = \" + \".join(map(str, numbers))\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total}\")\n\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
