    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) and the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the GCRD**: The greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s), is a common right divisor that is divisible from the left by any other common right divisor. It's analogous to the greatest common divisor for integers or polynomials.\n\n2.  **Use the Euclidean Algorithm**: The GCRD can be found by applying the Euclidean algorithm to the polynomial matrices. This involves performing elementary row operations on a stacked matrix.\n\n3.  **Form the Stacked Matrix**: We'll start by creating a single matrix `M` by stacking P1 on top of P2:\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n\n4.  **Apply Elementary Row Operations**: The goal is to reduce the stacked matrix `M` to a form where the lower block is a zero matrix, like `[G; 0]`, using the following operations:\n    *   Swapping any two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n\n5.  **Extract the GCRD**: The resulting upper block matrix `G` will be a GCRD of P1 and P2. The GCRD is unique up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We will simplify the final matrix `G` to its simplest form, which is often the identity matrix if the original matrices are right-coprime.\n\nThe Python code below uses the `sympy` library to handle the symbolic polynomial manipulations required for these steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD)\n    of two given polynomial matrices P1 and P2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]\n    M = sympy.Matrix.vstack(P1, P2)\n    \n    # R is a mutable copy of M for row operations\n    R = M.copy()\n\n    # Step 1: Use rows from P2 to simplify rows from P1\n    # R[0] = R[0] - (s + 1) * R[2]\n    # This makes R[0,0] zero\n    R[0, :] = R[0, :] - (s + 1) * R[2, :]\n    \n    # R[1] = R[1] + s * R[2]\n    # This simplifies R[1,0] to a constant\n    R[1, :] = R[1, :] + s * R[2, :]\n    \n    # Step 2: Use the new row R[1] (which is [-1, s**2]) as a pivot\n    # to eliminate the first column in other rows.\n    # Swap R[1] to the top for convenience\n    R.row_swap(0, 1)\n    \n    # R[1] = R[1] + s * R[0]\n    R[1, :] = R[1, :] + s * R[0, :]\n    \n    # R[3] = R[3] - (s + 1) * R[0]\n    R[3, :] = R[3, :] - (s + 1) * R[0, :]\n\n    # After these operations, the first column below the first row is zero.\n    # The matrix is now:\n    # [-1,            s**2]\n    # [ 0,            -s**3]  (Original R[0] after ops)\n    # [ s,                0]\n    # [ 0, 1 - s**3 - s**2]\n    # We made a mistake in tracking the rows.
