    "This is a question that requires knowledge of crystallography and the relationship between a crystal's symmetry (its point group) and its physical properties.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Define the Properties:**\n    *   **Optical Activity:** This is the ability of a material to rotate the plane of polarized light. A crystal class can be optically active only if it is **non-centrosymmetric** (lacks a center of inversion). However, there are two special non-centrosymmetric classes, `-6` and `-6m2`, that are also forbidden from showing optical activity due to other symmetry elements.\n    *   **Achiral:** A crystal class is achiral if it possesses any symmetry element that can transform a \"left-handed\" object into a \"right-handed\" one. These are called improper rotation operations and include a center of inversion, a mirror plane, or a rotoinversion axis. Chiral classes are those that lack all of these. The question asks for **achiral** classes.\n    *   **Non-polar:** A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique direction along which physical properties are different. All centrosymmetric classes are non-polar, as are several non-centrosymmetric classes that have multiple intersecting rotation axes or rotation axes perpendicular to mirror planes. The question asks for **non-polar** classes.\n\n2.  **Filter the 32 Crystal Classes:**\n    My approach will be to programmatically check each of the 32 crystal point groups against these three conditions.\n    *   First, I will create a dataset containing the properties (chiral, polar, centrosymmetric) of all 32 classes.\n    *   Then, the code will iterate through this dataset and select only the classes that are simultaneously:\n        1.  Achiral (not chiral).\n        2.  Non-polar.\n        3.  Optically active (non-centrosymmetric and not in the set of special exceptions {-6, -6m2}).\n    *   Finally, the code will print the names of the crystal classes that satisfy all conditions.\n\n```python\ndef find_special_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and can exhibit optical activity.\n\n    This is a fascinating case in crystallography where the common rule of thumb\n    \"optical activity requires chirality\" is shown to have exceptions.\n\n    The logic is as follows:\n    1. A crystal class can exhibit optical activity if and only if it is non-centrosymmetric,\n       with the special exception of classes -6 and -6m2, which are non-centrosymmetric but\n       are still optically inactive due to other symmetry constraints.\n    2. A crystal class is achiral if it is NOT chiral. A class is chiral if it lacks all\n       improper rotation axes (inversion, mirror planes, rotoinversion).\n    3. A crystal class is non-polar if it does not have a unique polar axis.\n\n    This script defines the properties of all 32 point groups and filters them based on these\n    three conditions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Data for all 32 point groups.\n    # Format: Hermann-Mauguin Symbol: [is_centrosymmetric, is_chiral, is_polar]\n    point_groups_data = {\n        # Triclinic\n        \"1\":     [False, True,  True],\n        \"-1\":    [True,  False, False],\n        # Monoclinic\n        \"2\":     [False, True,  True],\n        \"m\":     [False, False, True],\n        \"2/m\":   [True,  False, False],\n        # Orthorhombic\n        \"222\":   [False, True,  False],\n        \"mm2\":   [False, False, True],\n        \"mmm\":   [True,  False, False],\n        # Tetragonal\n        \"4\":     [False, True,  True],\n        \"-4\":    [False, False, False],\n        \"4/m\":   [True,  False, False],\n        \"422\":   [False, True,  False],\n        \"4mm\":   [False, False, True],\n        \"-42m\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"4/mmm\": [True,  False, False],\n        # Trigonal\n        \"3\":     [False, True,  True],\n        \"-3\":    [True,  False, False],\n        \"32\":    [False, True,  False],\n        \"3m\":    [False, False, True],\n        \"-3m\":   [True,  False, False],\n        # Hexagonal\n        \"6\":     [False, True,  True],\n        \"-6\":    [False, False, False],\n        \"6/m\":   [True,  False, False],\n        \"622\":   [False, True,  False],\n        \"6mm\":   [False, False, True],\n        \"-6m2\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"6/mmm\": [True,  False, False],\n        # Cubic\n        \"23\":    [False, True,  False],\n        \"m-3\":   [True,  False, False],\n        \"432\":   [False, True,  False],\n        \"-43m\":  [False, False, False],\n        \"m-3m\":  [True,  False, False],\n    }\n\n    # These two non-centrosymmetric classes are known to be optically inactive.\n    optically_inactive_exceptions = {\"-6\", \"-6m2\"}\n\n    result_classes = []\n\n    for name, properties in point_groups_data.items():\n        is_centrosymmetric, is_chiral, is_polar = properties\n\n        # Condition 1: Must be ACHIRAL (i.e., not chiral)\n        if is_chiral:\n            continue\n\n        # Condition 2: Must be NON-POLAR\n        if is_polar:\n            continue\n\n        # Condition 3: Must be OPTICALLY ACTIVE\n        # This means it must be non-centrosymmetric AND not one of the special exceptions.\n        is_optically_active = (not is_centrosymmetric) and (name not in optically_inactive_exceptions)\n\n        if is_optically_active:\n            result_classes.append(name)\n\n    print(\"The achiral, non-polar crystal classes that can exhibit optical activity are:\")\n    # We join with a comma and space for readability, as requested\n    print(\", \".join(result_classes))\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_special_crystal_classes()\n```\n<<<-4, -42m, -43m>>>"
