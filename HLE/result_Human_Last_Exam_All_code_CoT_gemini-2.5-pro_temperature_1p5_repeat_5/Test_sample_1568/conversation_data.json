    "To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the infinite product:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nThis expression can be evaluated using the properties of the Gamma function and its infinite product representation.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to derive the solution:\n\n1.  **Factor the term inside the product:** The term $(1 - a^3)$ can be factored using the cube roots of unity. Let $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ be the principal cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are $1, \\omega, \\omega^2$. We know that $x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x-\\omega)(x-\\omega^2)$. Letting $x = n/z$, we get:\n    $$ 1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Rewrite the infinite product:** Substitute the factored form back into the product:\n    $$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) \\right] $$\n\n3.  **Relate to the Gamma function product formula:** The infinite product for the Gamma function is given by the Weierstrass product:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{n}\\right)e^{x/n} $$\n    The product $\\prod(1-z^3/n^3)$ converges. We can see this by considering the product of the regularized terms. The regulating exponential factors are $e^{z/n}, e^{z\\omega/n}, e^{z\\omega^2/n}$. When multiplied, their exponents sum to $z/n(1+\\omega+\\omega^2)$. Since $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$, the exponential factors cancel out.\n    This allows us to write the product over all $n \\ge 1$ as:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\n4.  **Adjust the starting index:** The product in the question starts from $n=3$. We can express it by taking the product from $n=1$ and dividing out the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n5.  **Combine the results:** Substituting the expression for the product from $n=1$, we get the final result:\n    $$ P = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right) \\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\n\nThe following Python code prints this final expression.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The expression for the product from n=1 to infinity involves Gamma functions.\n    gamma_product_part = \"Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w**2)\"\n\n    # The original product starts from n=3, so we divide by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    n1_term_num = 1\n    n1_term_power = 3\n    n1_term = f\"(1 - z**{n1_term_power}/{n1_term_num}**{n1_term_power})\"\n\n    n2_term_num = 2\n    n2_term_power = 3\n    n2_term = f\"(1 - z**{n2_term_power}/{n2_term_num}**{n2_term_power})\"\n\n    # Construct the final expression string.\n    # The numerator is 1.\n    numerator = \"1\"\n    \n    # The denominator is the product of the terms for n=1, n=2, and the Gamma product.\n    denominator = f\"{n1_term} * {n2_term} * {gamma_product_part}\"\n\n    # The final expression.\n    final_expression = f\"1 / ({denominator})\"\n\n    print(f\"The value of the infinite product is:\")\n    print(final_expression)\n    print(\"\\nwhere 'Gamma' is the Gamma function and 'w' is the principal cube root of unity, w = exp(2*pi*i/3).\")\n    # For clarity, also show the expression with simplified constants.\n    simplified_denominator = f\"(1 - z**3) * (1 - z**3/8) * {gamma_product_part}\"\n    simplified_expression = f\"1 / ({simplified_denominator})\"\n    print(\"\\nWith simplified constants, the expression is:\")\n    print(simplified_expression)\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<1 / ((1 - z**3/1**3) * (1 - z**3/2**3) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*w) * Gamma(1 - z*w**2))>>>"
