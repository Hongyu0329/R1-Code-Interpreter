    "To determine which ballet step starts and ends in the same leg position, I will model the characteristics of each step within a Python script. I will use a dictionary to store the answer choices and a corresponding boolean value that indicates whether the step typically ends in the same position from which it started. The script will then iterate through this data, identify the correct step based on this property, and print the name of that step.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ballet_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same starting and ending leg position.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The definitions of the ballet steps and their properties are encoded here.\n    # True: Ending position is the same as the starting position.\n    # False: Ending position is different from the starting position.\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {'name': 'Entrechat six', 'returns_to_start': True},\n        'B': {'name': 'Échappé battu changé', 'returns_to_start': False},\n        'C': {'name': 'Assemblé', 'returns_to_start': False},\n        'D': {'name': 'Glissade derrière', 'returns_to_start': False},\n        'E': {'name': 'Gargouillade', 'returns_to_start': False}\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing ballet steps based on their starting and ending positions...\")\n    \n    found_step = None\n    for key, properties in ballet_steps.items():\n        if properties['returns_to_start']:\n            found_step = properties['name']\n            break\n            \n    if found_step:\n        print(f\"\\nThe step that ends in the same leg position as it started is: {found_step}\")\n        print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n        print(\"An Entrechat six is a vertical jump where the legs cross three times (making six movements).
