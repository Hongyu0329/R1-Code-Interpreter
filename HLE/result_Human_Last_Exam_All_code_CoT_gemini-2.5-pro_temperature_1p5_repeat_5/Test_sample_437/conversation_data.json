    "My plan is to solve this problem by first setting up the integral in its mathematical form and then using Python's symbolic mathematics library, SymPy, to perform the integration. This approach avoids numerical errors and provides an exact analytical expression for the result, which is common for this type of integral.\n\nThe steps are as follows:\n1.  Define the normalized 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO), $\\phi_{1s}$.\n2.  Set up the integral $\\langle \\phi_{1s} | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_{1s} \\rangle$ in spherical coordinates. The integral expression is $\\int \\phi_{1s}^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\frac{1}{r} \\phi_{1s}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$.\n3.  Separate the integral into its angular and radial parts.\n4.  Use SymPy to define the necessary symbols (like the orbital exponent $\\zeta$ and the radial coordinate $r$) and evaluate each part of the integral.\n5.  Combine the results of the sub-integrals to find the final expression, showing each term in the final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef evaluate_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Symbolically evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the necessary mathematical symbols with their properties\n    # zeta is the orbital exponent, a positive real number.\n    # r is the radial distance from the nucleus, a positive real number.\n    zeta = sympy.Symbol('zeta', positive=True, real=True)\n    r = sympy.Symbol('r', positive=True, real=True)\n    pi = sympy.pi\n\n    print(\"This script evaluates the expectation value of the 1/r operator for a 1s Slater-Type Orbital (STO).\")\n    print(\"The integral to be solved is: <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s>\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the components of the integral ---\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the components of the integral\")\n    # The square of the normalization constant for a 1s STO\n    N_squared = zeta**3 / pi\n    print(f\"The square of the normalization constant, N^2, is: {N_squared}\")\n\n    # The angular part of the integral in spherical coordinates.\n    # This comes from integrating sin(theta) over theta [0, pi] and dphi over phi [0, 2pi].\n    # Integral[sin(theta)dtheta] from 0 to pi = 2\n    # Integral[dphi] from 0 to 2*pi = 2*pi\n    angular_part = 4 * pi\n    print(f\"The integral over the angular coordinates (theta, phi) evaluates to: {angular_part}\")\n\n    # The radial part of the integrand, after including r^2 from the volume element\n    # and simplifying with the 1/r operator.\n    # The expression inside the radial integral is: [exp(-zeta*r)]^2 * (1/r) * r^2 = r * exp(-2*zeta*r)\n    radial_integrand = r * sympy.exp(-2 * zeta * r)\n    print(f\"The radial part of the integrand is: {radial_integrand}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Step 2: Evaluate the radial integral ---\n    print(\"Step 2: Evaluate the radial integral\")\n    # Integrate the radial part from r = 0 to infinity\n    radial_integral_result = sympy.integrate(radial_integrand, (r, 0, sympy.oo))\n    print(f\"The value of the radial integral 'Integral({radial_integrand}) dr' from 0 to oo is: {radial_integral_result}\\n\")\n\n\n    # --- Step 3: Combine all parts for the final result ---\n    print(\"Step 3: Combine the components to get the final result\")\n    print(\"The total expectation value is the product of the three components: N^2 * (Angular Part) * (Radial Integral)\")\n    \n    # Calculate the final result by multiplying the components\n    final_result = N_squared * angular_part * radial_integral_result\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each component clearly shown\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"   <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> = ({N_squared}) * ({angular_part}) * ({radial_integral_result})\")\n    \n    # Show simplification step\n    simplified_term = N_squared * angular_part\n    print(f\"   Simplifying N^2 and the angular part: ({N_squared}) * ({angular_part}) = {simplified_term}\")\n    print(f\"   So, the equation becomes: ({simplified_term}) * ({radial_integral_result})\")\n    \n    # Print the final symbolic answer\n    print(f\"\\n   The final result is: {final_result}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the value of the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> is simply the orbital exponent, zeta.\")\n    print(\"For a hydrogen atom in its ground state, zeta = 1, so the expectation value is 1.\")\n    print(\"------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    evaluate_slater_integral()\n\n```\n<<<zeta>>>"
