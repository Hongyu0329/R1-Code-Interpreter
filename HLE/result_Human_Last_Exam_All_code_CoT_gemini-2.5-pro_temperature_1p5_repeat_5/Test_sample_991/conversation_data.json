    "This is a classic riddle that describes the visual components of a Chinese character. The character is formed by putting a smaller character inside a larger one that acts as a frame.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will first identify the \"square box\" part of the riddle, which refers to a common Chinese radical known as the \"enclosure\".\n2.  Then, I will interpret the \"wooden stick\" and \"ladder\" parts. Together, these describe a character that looks like a person and is placed inside the enclosure.\n3.  Finally, I will combine these components to form the final character and write a Python script to print out this step-by-step construction. The script will show each component and then the final answer, fulfilling the \"equation\" requirement of the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its components.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The riddle describes the visual construction of the character 因 (yīn).\n    \n    # 1.
