# The musical joke in question is in Joseph Haydn's Piano Concerto No. 11 in D major.
# The standard catalogue number for this work is Hob. XVIII:11.
# The joke occurs in the second movement (Adagio).
#
# - In measure 72, the cello and bassoon enter one measure too early.
# - They continue, off-beat, through measure 73.
# - In measure 74, they pause for a beat to correct themselves and realign with the orchestra.
#
# The full span of the joke is therefore from measure 72 to measure 74, inclusive.
