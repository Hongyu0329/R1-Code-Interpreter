    This function identifies the correct statements from the provided list based on principles of quantum mechanics.

    The correct statements are:
    B1: Scale invariance generated by τ̂ = xp + px requires V(r) ∝ 1/r².
    D: If [τ̂, Ĥ]=0, τ̂|ψ⟩ is an energy eigenstate with the same energy as |ψ⟩.
    E: L̂_z generates rotations about the z-axis.
    F: Conservation of ⟨τ̂⟩ is equivalent to [τ̂, Ĥ]=0.
    G: A trivial premise leading to a true conclusion (τ̂ is Hermitian for unitary S) is a true statement.
    I: Non-commuting generators lead to non-additive exponents via the BCH formula.
    J: A symmetry operation S maps an energy eigenstate to another with the same energy.
    
    The sorted list of true statement indices is B1, D, E, F, G, I, J.
