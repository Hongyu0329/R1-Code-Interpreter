# The user wants to understand the evolutionary mechanism that maintains a constant genomic mutation rate.
# I will analyze the provided options based on principles of evolutionary genetics.

# A. Natural selection for fitness optimality: This is a plausible but incomplete explanation. Selection acts against high mutation rates but is not the sole factor.
# B. Genetic drift in small populations: Drift leads to random fluctuations, not stability.
# C. Equilibrium between beneficial and deleterious mutations: This captures the essence of the modern view. The mutation rate is at a balance point. The cost of deleterious mutations pushes the rate down, while mutational pressure on repair genes and the limits of selection (drift barrier) prevent it from reaching zero. This creates a stable equilibrium.
# D. Homogeneous mutation distribution across genomic sites: This describes the pattern, not the mechanism for the rate itself.
# E. The stochastic nature of mutational events: This describes the randomness of individual mutations, not the stability of the overall rate.

# Conclusion: Option C provides the best and most complete explanation. It describes a dynamic balance of opposing evolutionary forces that leads to a stable, non-zero mutation rate.

# Final Answer Selection

#print(f"The correct option is {final_answer}.")
# The prompt asks not to use f-strings or additional text, just to return the answer in the specified format.
# Let's double check the prompt requirements: "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response".
# Okay, so I should not use a python block for this type of question. I will just provide the reasoning and then the final answer in the requested format.
