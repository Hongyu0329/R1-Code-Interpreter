    """
    Calculates the maximum possible number of children based on the geometric constraints.

    The problem can be solved by considering the conditions for a child's view to be blocked.
    A child's position is determined by the intersection of two lines:
    1. A line passing through tree E and one of the blocking trees {A, B, C, D}.
    2. A line passing through tree F and one of the blocking trees {A, B, C, D}.

    Let n be the number of available blocking trees, n = 4.
    Let k be the number of trees to be blocked, k = 2 (E and F).

    The tree blocking E must be different from the tree blocking F, otherwise the
    child's position would coincide with the blocking tree, which is not allowed.

    So, we need to choose an ordered pair of 2 distinct trees from the 4 available ones.
    This is a permutation problem.
