    "This sequence is comprised of Harshad numbers (also known as Niven numbers). A Harshad number is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits.\n\nFor example, let's take the last number in the sequence, 2352:\n- The sum of its digits is 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12.\n- The number 2352 is divisible by 12 (2352 / 12 = 196).\n- Therefore, 2352 is a Harshad number.\n\nMy plan to find the next number is as follows:\n1.  Start checking integers greater than the last number in the sequence, 2352.\n2.  For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits.\n3.  Check if the integer is divisible by this sum.\n4.  The first integer that satisfies this condition is the next number in the sequence.\n5.  Finally, I will print the result as an equation showing the last number, the difference, and the next number.\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.\"\"\"\n    s = 0\n    for digit in str(n):\n        s += int(digit)\n    return s\n\ndef find_next_harshad_number(n):\n    \"\"\"Finds the next Harshad number after n.\"\"\"\n    num_to_check = n + 1\n    while True:\n        sod = sum_digits(num_to_check)\n        if num_to_check % sod == 0:\n            return num_to_check\n        num_to_check += 1\n\n# The last number in the provided sequence\nlast_number = 2352\n\n# Find the next number in the sequence\nnext_number = find_next_harshad_number(last_number)\n\n# Calculate the difference\ndifference = next_number - last_number\n\n# Print the equation showing the result\nprint(f\"The next number in the sequence is found by solving for x in: {last_number} + (x - {last_number}) = x\")\nprint(f\"The equation is: {last_number} + {difference} = {next_number}\")\nprint(f\"So the next number is {next_number}\")\n<<<2353>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
