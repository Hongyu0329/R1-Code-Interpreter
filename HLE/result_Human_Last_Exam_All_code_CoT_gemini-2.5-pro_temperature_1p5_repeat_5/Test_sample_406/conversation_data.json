    "The problem is to find the conditions for the existence of a **tripled fixed point** for a system of three functions `F`, `G`, and `H`. Let's clarify the definitions and then state the conditions based on the Banach fixed-point theorem extended to this system.\n\n### **1. Problem Setup**\n\nLet `(X, d_X)`, `(Y, d_Y)`, and `(Z, d_Z)` be three complete metric spaces. We are given three functions with the following signatures (assuming a typo correction from the prompt, where `G` was defined twice):\n*   `F: X × Y × Z → X`\n*   `G: Y × X × Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z × Y × X → Z`\n\nAn **FGH-tripled fixed point** is a tuple `(x, y, z) ∈ X × Y × Z` that satisfies the following system of equations:\n1.  `F(x, y, z) = x`\n2.  `G(y, x, y) = y`\n3.  `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n### **2. Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nA unique FGH-tripled fixed point is guaranteed to exist if the functions `F`, `G`, and `H` satisfy certain contractive conditions. These conditions ensure that an iterative sequence, defined below, is a Cauchy sequence and converges to the unique fixed point.\n\nThe iterative sequence starts from an arbitrary point `(x₀, y₀, z₀) ∈ X × Y × Z` and is defined as:\n*   `x_{n+1} = F(xₙ, yₙ, zₙ)`\n*   `y_{n+1} = G(yₙ, xₙ, yₙ)`\n*   `z_{n+1} = H(zₙ, yₙ, xₙ)`\n\nThe conditions are as follows:\n\n**Condition 1: Contractive Mappings**\nThere must exist nine non-negative constants `a₁, a₂, a₃, b₁, b₂, c₁, c₂, c₃` such that for any two points `(x, y, z)` and `(u, v, w)` in their respective domains, the following inequalities hold:\n*   `d_X(F(x, y, z), F(u, v, w)) ≤ a₁·d_X(x, u) + a₂·d_Y(y, v) + a₃·d_Z(z, w)`\n*   `d_Y(G(y, x, y), G(v, u, v)) ≤ b₁·d_Y(y, v) + b₂·d_X(x, u)`\n*   `d_Z(H(z, y, x), H(w, v, u)) ≤ c₁·d_Z(z, w) + c₂·d_Y(y, v) + c₃·d_X(x, u)`\n\n**Condition 2: Contraction Factor**\nThe constants must satisfy the condition that the overall mapping on the product space `X × Y × Z` is a contraction. This is satisfied if the maximum of the summed coefficients for each component is less than 1:\n`max(a₁ + b₂ + c₃, a₂ + b₁ + c₂, a₃ + c₁) < 1`\n\nIf these two conditions are met, there exists a unique FGH-tripled fixed point `(x, y, z)`, and it can be found as the limit of the iterative sequence described above.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates these conditions by defining a system of linear functions that satisfy them, and then calculates the unique tripled fixed point.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates the conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point.\n    \n    It defines a specific system of functions F, G, H over the real numbers \n    (which is a complete metric space) that satisfy the contractivity conditions.\n    Then, it calculates the unique tripled fixed point for this system.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
