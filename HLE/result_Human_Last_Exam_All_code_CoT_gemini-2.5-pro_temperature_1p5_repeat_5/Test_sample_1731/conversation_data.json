    "The problem of finding the equilibrium values for entropy and mean energy of a photon gas can be solved using the principles of statistical mechanics, which are rigorously grounded in large deviation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Connect Statistical Mechanics to Large Deviation Theory:** The fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics is that a system in equilibrium will be found in the macrostate that corresponds to the largest number of microstates. In the language of large deviation theory (like Sanov's theorem), this most probable macrostate is the one that minimizes the rate function. This principle of maximum entropy (or minimum rate function) allows us to derive the equilibrium distribution.\n\n2.  **Derive the Distribution:** For a gas of non-interacting bosons like photons (where the particle number is not conserved, so chemical potential is zero), maximizing the entropy subject to a fixed average energy leads to the **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the mean number of photons `<n_ε>` in an energy state `ε`:\n    `<n_ε> = 1 / (exp(ε / (k_B T)) - 1)`, where `k_B` is the Boltzmann constant and `T` is the temperature.\n\n3.  **Calculate Mean Energy `<E>`:** To find the total mean energy, we must sum `ε * <n_ε>` over all possible states. For photons in a 3D box of volume `V`, the states form a continuum. We integrate over energy using the photon **density of states**, `g(ε) = (8πV / (h³c³)) * ε²`.\n    The mean energy is `<E> = ∫₀^∞ ε * <n_ε> * g(ε) dε`. This integral can be solved exactly and results in the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of a black body.\n\n4.  **Calculate Entropy `S`:** Once `<E>` is known as a function of temperature, the entropy `S` can be determined. For a photon gas, a fundamental thermodynamic relation derived from the partition function is `S = 4<E> / (3T)`. We will use this to find the final expression for entropy.\n\n5.  **Python Code:** A Python script will be provided to present these final equations clearly, calculating the numerical constants involved and printing the final symbolic formulas for `<E>` and `S`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the equilibrium formulas for mean energy and entropy\n    of a photon gas based on statistical mechanics.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # We use symbolic placeholders for physical constants and variables,\n    # as no numerical values for Volume (V) or Temperature (T) are given.\n    k_B = \"k_B\"  # Boltzmann constant\n    h = \"h\"      # Planck's constant\n    c = \"c\"      # Speed of light\n    V = \"V\"      # Volume\n    T = \"T\"      # Temperature\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Properties of a Photon Gas (Bose Case) ---\")\n    \n    # --- Mean Energy <E> ---\n    print(\"\\n1.
