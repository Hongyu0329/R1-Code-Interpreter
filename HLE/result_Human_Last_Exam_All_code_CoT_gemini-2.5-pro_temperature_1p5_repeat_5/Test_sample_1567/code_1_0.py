Step-by-step explanation:

1.  Let X_n be the position of the controlled random walk in Z^d at step n. The walk starts at X_0 = 0. At each step, a probability measure nu_i is chosen from a set {nu_1, ..., nu_k} based on the history of the walk. The next step Y_{n+1} is drawn from nu_i, so that X_{n+1} = X_n + Y_{n+1}.

2.  A key property of each measure nu_i is that it has a mean of 0. This has a profound implication for the process X_n. Let F_n be the information containing the history of the walk up to step n. The expected position at the next step, conditioned on the history, is:
    E[X_{n+1} | F_n] = E[X_n + Y_{n+1} | F_n] = X_n + E[Y_{n+1} | F_n].
    Since the choice of measure nu_{i_n} depends on the history F_n, the expectation of the next step is E_{nu_{i_n}}[Y] = 0.
    Therefore, E[X_{n+1} | F_n] = X_n. This is the definition of a martingale. The controlled random walk X_n is a martingale, regardless of the value of k or the specific control strategy employed.

3.  The problem is set in dimension d >= 3. There is a fundamental result in probability theory about the long-term behavior of martingales on integer lattices. For d >= 3, a martingale on Z^d is transient, provided its increments satisfy two conditions:
    a) They are bounded.
    b) They are not confined to a lower-dimensional subspace (a condition called ellipticity).

4.  Let's check if these conditions hold.
    a) The problem states that the measures have "uniformly bounded support". This means the length of any possible step Y is bounded by some constant R, so the increments are bounded.
    b) The problem states that the measures are "genuinely d-dimensional". This means that the support of any nu_i spans the entire d-dimensional space. This ensures the ellipticity condition is met. The covariance matrix of any nu_i is strictly positive definite, meaning the walk is never restricted to a lower-dimensional subspace, no matter which measure is chosen.

5.  Because the process X_n is a martingale in Z^d (d >= 3) with bounded and elliptic increments, it must be transient. This means the probability of returning to the origin is strictly less than 1.

6.  This conclusion holds for ANY set of k measures {nu_1, ..., nu_k} and for ANY control strategy. It is therefore impossible to "guarantee (with probability 1) that the controlled random walk will return to the origin".

7.  The question asks for the maximal k for which this statement is true. Since we have shown that it is true for any finite number of measures k >= 1, there is no *maximal* finite k. The property holds for all k.

    # The final equation is a bit abstract in this case.
    # The reasoning is that for any strategy, P(return to origin) < 1.
    # This holds for k=1, 2, 3, ...
    # So the set of k for which the condition holds is {1, 2, 3, ...}.
    # The maximal value in this set is infinity.
