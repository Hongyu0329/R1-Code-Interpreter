    # 2. Evaluate Potential Diagnoses (Answer Choices)
    # This logic models a differential diagnosis process.

    # A. Acute blood transfusion reaction: Typically occurs within hours (<6) of transfusion.
    # The patient is 29 days post-op, making this highly unlikely.
    
    # D. Sepsis: Major surgery like the Whipple procedure is a risk factor for post-operative
    # infection. Sepsis can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is
    # characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates (causing crackles).
    # The timeline of 29 days is plausible for a post-op infection to develop and cause sepsis.
    # This is a very strong possibility.
    
    # F. Respiratory deconditioning: Causes shortness of breath on exertion but does not
    # typically cause acute, severe hypoxemia with bilateral crackles at rest.
    
    # Other choices are less likely: Iodine reaction is usually immediate, 'sensitivity reaction'
    # and 'lung exhaustion' are non-specific, and air pollution is not the most direct cause in
    # a post-surgical inpatient.

    # 3. Formulate and Print the Conclusion
    # The clinical picture is most consistent with ARDS, with sepsis being the most likely underlying cause.
