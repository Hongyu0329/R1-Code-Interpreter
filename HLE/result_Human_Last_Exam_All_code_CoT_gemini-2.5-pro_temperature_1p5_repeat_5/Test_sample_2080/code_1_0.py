# 1. Define the experimental second osmotic virial coefficient from the problem statement.
b_exp = -7.585  # in mL/g

# 2. State the relationship between the experimental (B_exp), steric (B_steric),
#    and attractive (B_attractive) components.
#    Equation: B_exp = B_steric + B_attractive

# 3. Apply a model for systems with strong attractive forces where B_attractive â‰ˆ -2 * B_steric.
#    This simplifies the equation to B_exp = -B_steric.

# 4. Solve for the steric component.
b_steric = -b_exp

# 5. Calculate the corresponding attractive component for completeness.
b_attractive = b_exp - b_steric

# 6. Output the final equation with each number included.
print("The relationship is: B_experimental = B_steric + B_attractive")
print("The calculated values for each component in the equation are:")
print(f"{b_exp} = {b_steric} + ({b_attractive})")

# The final answer is the value for the steric-only component.
print(f"\nThe second osmotic virial coefficient from Steric-only behavior is {b_steric} mL/g.")
