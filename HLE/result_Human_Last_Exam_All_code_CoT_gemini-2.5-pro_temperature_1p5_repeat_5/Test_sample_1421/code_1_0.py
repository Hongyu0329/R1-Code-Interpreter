    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z

    formula = """
The formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields:

Z = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] * exp(-S[ψ̄, ψ])

Where:

1.  Z: The Grand Canonical Partition Function.

2.  ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ]: This is the functional integral (or path integral) over all possible configurations of the independent Grassmann fields ψ(x,τ) and ψ̄(x,τ).

3.  S[ψ̄, ψ]: This is the Euclidean action for the fermions in imaginary time. A common form is:

    S[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫₀ᵝ dτ ∫ dᵈx  ψ̄(x, τ) * [ħ∂/∂τ + H₀(-iħ∇) - μ] * ψ(x, τ)

    - τ: Imaginary time, integrated from 0 to β.
    - x: Spatial coordinate, integrated over d-dimensional space.
    - β: Inverse temperature, β = 1 / (k_B * T).
    - ħ: Reduced Planck constant.
    - H₀: The single-particle Hamiltonian operator (e.g., kinetic energy term -ħ²∇²/2m).
    - μ: The chemical potential.
    - ψ(x, τ), ψ̄(x, τ): The fermionic Grassmann fields.

4.  Boundary Conditions: The integral is performed subject to Anti-Periodic Boundary Conditions (A.P.B.C.) in the imaginary time direction, which is a defining feature for fermions:

    ψ(x, τ=β) = -ψ(x, τ=0)
    ψ̄(x, τ=β) = -ψ̄(x, τ=0)
