    "Of course. Here is the formula for the fermionic partition function Z in the imaginary time path integral formalism, presented as a Python script that prints the formula and its components.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Partition Function (Z):** The goal is to express the statistical mechanical partition function, `Z = Tr(e^(-βH))`, as a path integral.\n2.  **Introduce Fermionic Fields:** For fermions, we use anticommuting numbers called Grassmann variables. The path integral will be over all possible configurations of these fermionic fields, denoted as `ψ(x,τ)` and `ψ̄(x,τ)`.\n3.  **Incorporate Imaginary Time:** The formalism uses imaginary time `τ`, which is related to the inverse temperature `β = 1/(k_B T)`. The integration over `τ` runs from `0` to `β`.\n4.  **Define the Action (S):** The \"weight\" of each field configuration in the integral is given by `e^(-S)`, where `S` is the Euclidean action of the system. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over spacetime.\n5.  **Specify Boundary Conditions:** A key feature for fermions is that the trace operation imposes **anti-periodic boundary conditions (A.P.B.C.)** on the fields in the imaginary time direction. This means a field at time `τ=β` is the negative of the field at `τ=0`.\n6.  **Assemble the Formula:** Combine these elements into the final integral expression for `Z`.\n7.  **Format the Output:** Present the final formula within a Python `print` statement to adhere to the output requirements.\n\n```python\ndef fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function Z\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    formula = \"\"\"\nThe formula for the fermionic partition function Z is given by a functional integral over anticommuting Grassmann fields:\n\nZ = ∫ D[ψ̄] D[ψ] * exp(-S[ψ̄, ψ])\n\nWhere:\n\n1.
