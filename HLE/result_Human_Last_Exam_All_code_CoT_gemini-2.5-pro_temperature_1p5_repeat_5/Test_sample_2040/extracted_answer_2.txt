No, because the common stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric. This crystal symmetry results in a vanishing second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\chi^{(2)}$), which is a necessary material property for spontaneous parametric down-conversion to occur. The process might become possible if symmetry is broken by defects, strain, or interaction with a substrate, but it is not expected for ideal, free-standing sheets.
