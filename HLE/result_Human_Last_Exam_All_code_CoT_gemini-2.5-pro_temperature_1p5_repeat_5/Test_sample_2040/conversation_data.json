    "Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a phenomenon from the field of nonlinear optics. To determine if a material can exhibit SPDC, we must analyze its fundamental physical properties, specifically its crystal symmetry.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  First, I will explain the physical requirements for a material to exhibit SPDC. The key requirement is a non-zero second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility, denoted as $\\chi^{(2)}$.\n2.  I will discuss the link between $\\chi^{(2)}$ and crystal symmetry. Materials that possess a center of inversion symmetry (i.e., they are centrosymmetric) must have $\\chi^{(2)}=0$.\n3.  I will then analyze the crystal structure of free-standing boron nanosheets (borophene). The common, stable phases of borophene are known to be centrosymmetric.\n4.  Based on this, I will conclude that ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit SPDC.\n5.  To fulfill the request for a code sample, I will provide a Python script that does not simulate the material itself, but rather illustrates the core principle of energy conservation in an SPDC process, which is central to the phenomenon. The script will calculate the wavelengths of the down-converted photons (signal and idler) for a given pump photon.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_spdc_energy_conservation(pump_wavelength_nm, signal_wavelength_nm=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Demonstrates energy conservation in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\n\n    The energy conservation law is E_pump = E_signal + E_idler.\n    Since E = hc/λ, this is equivalent to: 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler.\n\n    This function showcases two cases:\n    1. Degenerate SPDC: The signal and idler photons have the same wavelength.\n    2. Non-degenerate SPDC: The signal and idler photons have different wavelengths.\n\n    Args:\n        pump_wavelength_nm (float): Wavelength of the pump photon in nanometers.\n        signal_wavelength_nm (float, optional): Wavelength of the signal photon in nm for the non-degenerate case.\n                                                 If not provided, only the degenerate case is shown.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Analyzing SPDC for a pump laser with wavelength: {pump_wavelength_nm} nm\\n\")\n\n    # --- Case 1: Degenerate SPDC ---\n    # The pump photon splits into two identical daughter photons.\n    degenerate_photon_wavelength = 2 * pump_wavelength_nm\n    print(\"--- 1.

This crystal symmetry results in a vanishing second-order nonlinear susceptibility ($\\chi^{(2)}$), which is a necessary material property for spontaneous parametric down-conversion to occur. The process might become possible if symmetry is broken by defects, strain, or interaction with a substrate, but it is not expected for ideal, free-standing sheets.>>>"
