--- Final Conclusion ---
The code above illustrates that the space P(X) contains a continuum of points,
so its cardinality is at least c (the cardinality of the continuum).

The solution to the problem relies on advanced results from topology:

1.  The space P(X) is a topologically complete metric space (specifically, a Polish space) because it is a G-delta subset of the compact space 2^X.

2.  The Baire Category Theorem states that for any countable collection of open dense subsets {G_n} of P(X), their intersection G is dense in P(X).

3.  Since P(X) is a perfect space (it has no isolated points), its dense subset G must be uncountable.

4.  The Perfect Set Theorem states that any uncountable Borel subset of a Polish space must have cardinality c. The intersection G is such a set.

5.  Therefore, for ANY countable collection of open dense subsets, the cardinality of their intersection is exactly c.

The smallest possible cardinality is therefore c.
