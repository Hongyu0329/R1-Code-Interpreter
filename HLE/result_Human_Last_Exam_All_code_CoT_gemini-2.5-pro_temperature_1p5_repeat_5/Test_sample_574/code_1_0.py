# Step 1: Define the words derived from the clues.
# The first word is formed from the letters of "CAPES" (sleeveless garments).
word_1 = "SCAPE"

# The second word is "GOAT". When combined with the first word,
# it forms a known ship name from the Culture series.
word_2 = "GOAT"

# Step 2: Combine the two words to form the final ship name.
ship_name = word_1 + word_2

# Step 3: Print the final equation, showing each component.
