    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation followed by a Python script to present the result.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **State the Beta Function:** I will begin with the one-loop beta function, $\\beta(u)$, for the coupling constant `u` in the single-component $\\phi^4$ theory. This equation describes how the coupling strength changes with the energy scale. The calculation is performed near four dimensions, specifically in $d = 4 - \\epsilon$ dimensions.\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, denoted as $u^*$, is a special value of the coupling where it stops changing with the energy scale. This occurs when the beta function is zero, i.e., $\\beta(u^*) = 0$.\n3.  **Solve the Equation:** I will solve the equation $\\beta(u^*) = 0$. This equation has a trivial solution ($u^*=0$, the Gaussian fixed point) and a non-trivial solution, known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which is what we are interested in.\n4.  **Identify Leading Order Term:** The expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point will be proportional to $\\epsilon$. Since we are using the one-loop beta function, this solution for $u^*$ represents the leading order expression in an expansion in $\\epsilon$.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** Finally, I will provide a Python script that prints this derived mathematical expression in a clear format.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe one-loop beta function for the coupling `u` in a single-component $\\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\\epsilon$ dimensions is:\n$\\beta(u) = -\\epsilon u + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^2 + O(u^3)$\n\nTo find the fixed points, we set the beta function to zero, ignoring higher-order terms:\n$\\beta(u^*) = -\\epsilon u^* + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} (u^*)^2 = 0$\n\nThis can be factored as:\n$u^* \\left(-\\epsilon + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^*\\right) = 0$\n\nThis gives two solutions:\n1.  $u^* = 0$ (The trivial Gaussian fixed point)\n2.  $-\\epsilon + \\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^* = 0$ (The non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point)\n\nSolving the second equation for $u^*$:\n$\\frac{3}{16\\pi^2} u^* = \\epsilon$\n$u^* = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} \\epsilon$\n\nThis is the leading order expression for the Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in terms of $\\epsilon$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_fixed_point_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the leading order expression for the fixed point\n    coupling u* in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The expression for the fixed point coupling u* is (16 * pi^2 / 3) * epsilon.\n    # We define the numerical coefficients here as requested.\n    numerator_coefficient = 16\n    denominator_coefficient = 3\n    pi_symbol = \"pi\"\n    epsilon_symbol = \"epsilon\"\n\n    print(\"The leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory is given by the Wilson-Fisher fixed point.\")\n    print(\"The equation is:\")\n    # Using 'pi^2' for clarity, as math.pi**2 would be a numerical evaluation.\n    print(f\"u* = ({numerator_coefficient} * {pi_symbol}^2 / {denominator_coefficient}) * {epsilon_symbol}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    display_fixed_point_expression()\n```\n<<<$ \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3}\\epsilon $>>>"
