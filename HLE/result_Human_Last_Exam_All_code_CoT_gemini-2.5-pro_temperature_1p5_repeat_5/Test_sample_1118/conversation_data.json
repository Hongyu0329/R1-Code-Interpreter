    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\nFirst, I will research the self-portrait painted by Curt Querner in 1933 after his escape from the Gestapo.\nThen, I will identify the object he holds in his hand in that specific painting, which is widely interpreted as a symbol of resistance or steadfastness.\nFinally, I will write a Python script that stores this information in a variable and prints it in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_of_resistance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the object Curt Querner holds in his 1933 self-portrait.\n    \"\"\"\n    year_of_painting = 1933\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    symbol = \"a pipe\"\n    \n    print(f\"In his {year_of_painting} self-portrait, painted after escaping the Gestapo, {artist} holds {symbol} in his hand as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_of_resistance()\n```\n<<<a pipe>>>"
