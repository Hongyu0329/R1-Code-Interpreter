# Set the precision for the calculations. 50 digits is sufficient.
mpmath.mp.dps = 50

# Step 1: Calculate the value of the exponent in log10(N) = -7^13 * log10(e)
# First, calculate 7^13
power_val = mpmath.power(7, 13)

# Then, calculate log10(e)
log10_e = mpmath.log10(mpmath.e)

# Now, calculate the full value of log10(N)
log_N = -power_val * log10_e

# Step 2: Decompose log_N into its integer and fractional parts.
# Let log_N = I + f, where I is the integer part and f is the fractional part (0 <= f < 1).
I = mpmath.floor(log_N)
f = log_N - I

# Step 3: The non-zero digits are determined by 10^f. Let's calculate this.
# This value is also known as the significand or mantissa of the number N.
significand = mpmath.power(10, f)

# Step 4: Extract the first two digits from the significand.
# The significand is of the form d1.d2d3...
# d1 is the integer part.
# d2 is the first decimal digit.
first_digit = int(significand)
second_digit = int((significand * 10) % 10)

# The question asks to find the first two non-zero digits.
# We present the result in the format of an equation.
