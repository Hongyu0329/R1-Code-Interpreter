    # Part (a) Analysis
    # A smooth covering implies ord(g) = ord(gN) for g in {b, w, bw}.
    # This is equivalent to N having trivial intersection with <g>.
    # A vertex stabilizer is conjugate to a subgroup of <b> (or <w>),
    # e.g., G_v = h K h^-1 where K <= <b>.
    # The stabilizer of v in N is N_v = N intersect G_v.
    # N_v = N intersect (h K h^-1) = h (h^-1 N h intersect K) h^-1.
    # Since N is normal, h^-1 N h = N.
    # So N_v = h (N intersect K) h^-1.
    # Since K <= <b> and N intersect <b> = {1}, then N intersect K = {1}.
    # Thus N_v = {1}. The same logic applies to faces (stabilizers are subgroups of <bw>).
    # An action where all point stabilizers are trivial is semi-regular.
    # Therefore, the statement is True.
    answer_a = "True"
    
    # Part (b) Analysis
    # The question provides the definition of a quasi-simple group as one where
    # G/Z(G) is simple AND G = G', where G' is the commutator subgroup.
    # A group G is called perfect if G = G'.
    # The definition of quasi-simple given in the problem explicitly includes the condition
    # that G is perfect. Therefore, it is necessary for a quasi-simple group to be perfect.
    # The statement is True.
    answer_b = "True"
    
    # Part (c) Analysis
    # 1. D is a regular dessin, so faces are the cosets of <bw>.
    # 2. D_N is unicellular and regular, which means G/N is generated by the image of bw.
    #    Thus, G/N is a cyclic group.
    # 3. G is face-quasiprimitive, meaning it acts quasiprimitively on the set of faces.
    #    The stabilizer of a face is the cyclic group <bw>.
    # 4. A cyclic group is a soluble group. A theorem by Praeger states that a quasiprimitive
    #    permutation group with a soluble point stabilizer must be of either affine type
    #    or almost simple type.
    # 5. Affine type corresponds to the given type (HA), where the socle (the minimal normal
    #    subgroup N in this case) is abelian.
    # 6. Almost simple type corresponds to the given type (AS), where the socle (N) is a
    #    non-abelian simple group.
    # The other types are ruled out by this theorem.
