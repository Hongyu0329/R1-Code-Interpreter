    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal way to pack 9x1x1 blocks into a 15x15x15 cube. A simple volume division (`15*15*15 / 9`) gives an upper limit but doesn't account for the physical constraints of fitting the shapes.\n\nA better method is a greedy approach where we pack the cube in stages, always trying to fill the available space as efficiently as possible.\n\n1.  **Stage 1:** Start with the 15x15x15 cube. We can slice off a 9-unit thick section, creating a volume of 9x15x15. We can perfectly pack this with blocks aligned with the 9-unit side. This gives us `(15/1) * (15/1) * (9/9) = 15 * 15 * 1 = 225` blocks. The remaining volume is `(15-9)x15x15`, which is 6x15x15.\n\n2.  **Stage 2:** Now we pack the remaining 6x15x15 space. The 9-unit length of the blocks must be aligned with one of the 15-unit sides. We can fill a `6x15x9` section of this space, which fits `(6/1) * (15/1) * (9/9) = 6 * 15 * 1 = 90` blocks. The new remaining volume is `6x15x(15-9)`, which is 6x6x15.\n\n3.  **Stage 3:** We now pack the 6x6x15 space. Again, the 9-unit length of the blocks must go along the 15-unit side. We can fill a `6x6x9` section, which fits `(6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9) = 6 * 6 * 1 = 36` blocks. The final remaining volume is `6x6x(15-9)`, which is 6x6x6.\n\n4.  **Final Check:** In a 6x6x6 volume, no dimension is large enough to fit a 9-unit block, so we can't add any more.\n\nThe total number of blocks is the sum from all stages: 225 + 90 + 36 = 351.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this result and prints the step-by-step breakdown of the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the largest number of 9x1x1 blocks that fit inside a 15x15x15 cube\n    by breaking the problem down into packing stages.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Stage 1: Pack a 9x15x15 volume from the initial 15x15x15 cube.\n    # The number of blocks is (15/1) * (15/1) * (9/9).\n    term1 = 15 * 15\n\n    # Stage 2: Pack the remaining 6x15x15 volume.\n    # We pack a 6x15x9 section. The number of blocks is (6/1) * (15/1) * (9/9).\n    term2 = 6 * 15\n\n    # Stage 3: Pack the remaining 6x6x15 volume.\n    # We pack a 6x6x9 section. The number of blocks is (6/1) * (6/1) * (9/9).\n    term3 = 6 * 6\n    \n    # The final remaining 6x6x6 volume cannot be packed.\n    \n    total_blocks = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n    print(\"The maximum number of blocks is found by summing the blocks from each packing stage.\")\n    print(\"The equation for the total is:\")\n    \n    # Print the final equation with each number and the result.\n    print(f\"{term1} + {term2} + {term3} = {total_blocks}\")\n\nsolve_packing_problem()\n```\n<<<351>>>"
