    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Core Concept:** The problem asks for the probability of finding a particle in a specific region of a 1D box. In quantum mechanics, this is calculated by integrating the probability density function, `|ψ(x)|²`, over that specific interval.\n2.  **State the Wavefunction:** The normalized wavefunction `ψ_n(x)` for a particle in a 1D box of length `a` is:\n    `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(n * π * x / a)`\n3.  **Determine the Probability Density:** The probability density is the square of the wavefunction's magnitude:\n    `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a)`\n4.  **Set Up the Integral:** To find the probability `P`, we need to integrate this function from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a` for the quantum state `n = 2`.\n    `P = ∫ [from 0.495a to 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2 * π * x / a) dx`\n5.  **Use Numerical Integration:** This integral can be solved analytically, but it's more straightforward and less error-prone to compute it numerically using Python. We will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function, a high-precision numerical integration tool.\n6.  **Write the Code:** The Python script will define the parameters (`n`, integration limits) and the probability density function. It will then call `scipy.integrate.quad` to perform the calculation and print the result in a clear, formatted output.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# This script calculates the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box\n# within a given interval. If you don't have scipy installed, please run:\n# pip install scipy\n\n# 1. Define the parameters for the problem\nn = 2           # The principal quantum number\na = 1.0         # We can set the box length 'a' to 1.0, as it cancels out\nx1 = 0.495 * a  # The lower bound of the interval\nx2 = 0.505 * a  # The upper bound of the interval\n\n# 2. Define the probability density function, |ψ(x)|²\ndef probability_density(x, n, a):\n  \"\"\"\n  Calculates the probability density |ψ(x)|² for a particle in a 1D box.\n  \"\"\"\n  return (2/a) * (np.sin(n * np.pi * x / a))**2\n\n# 3. Perform the numerical integration\n#    quad returns a tuple: (result, estimated_error)\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# 4. Print the final result and the equation used\nprint(\"The probability P is found by integrating the probability density |ψ_n(x)|² over the interval [x1, x2]:\")\nprint(\"P = Integral from x1 to x2 of (2/a) * sin²(n * π * x / a) dx\")\nprint(\"\\nFor this problem, the values are:\")\nprint(f\"n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"a = {a}\")\nprint(f\"x1 = {x1}\")\nprint(f\"x2 = {x2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculated probability is:\")\nprint(f\"P = {probability:.4e}\")\n\n# The problem is centered around a node (at x=a/2 for n=2), so the probability is very small.\n\nprint(f\"<<<{probability}>>>\")\n```"
