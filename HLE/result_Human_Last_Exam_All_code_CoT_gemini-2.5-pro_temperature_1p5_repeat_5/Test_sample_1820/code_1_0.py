def calculate_completeness_bound(b, d):
    """
    Calculates the theoretical completeness bound for the ontology mapping.

    The problem describes a mapping from an ontology O1 (with mergeable siblings)
    to an ontology O2 (with a strict categorical structure). The key challenge is
    that the "mergeable" nature of siblings in O1 conflicts with the strict,
    disjoint nature of categories in O2. This creates logical inconsistencies
    that limit the completeness of the mapping.

    Option D provides the most plausible model for this limit. It states that
    completeness is bounded by an information-theoretic measure, ln(b)/d.
    - ln(b) represents the information content or structural complexity at each
      branching point in the source ontology's hierarchy.
    - d (depth) represents the number of hierarchical levels over which consistency
      must be maintained. The bound decreases as depth increases because the
      potential for conflict accumulates.

    This function calculates and prints the result based on this model.
