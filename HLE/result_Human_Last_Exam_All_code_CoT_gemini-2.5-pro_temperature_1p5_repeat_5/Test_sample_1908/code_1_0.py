    This function solves for the smallest possible number of complements a topology can have.

    Let X be a set of cardinality c, and T be a topology on X that is neither trivial nor discrete.
    A topology S is a complement to T if:
    1. T intersect S is the trivial topology ({emptyset, X}).
    2. The union T union S generates the discrete topology on X.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of complements a topology T can have.

    Step 1: Lower bound.
    It is a known theorem in topology that for any non-trivial, non-discrete topology, at least one complement always exists. This means the number of complements must be at least 1.

    Step 2: Existence of a topology with a single complement.
    It is also a known result that topologies that possess exactly one complement do exist. Such constructions are complex, often involving concepts like maximal almost disjoint families of sets.

    Step 3: Conclusion.
    Since the number of complements is always at least 1, and there exists a topology with exactly 1 complement, the smallest possible number of complements is 1.
