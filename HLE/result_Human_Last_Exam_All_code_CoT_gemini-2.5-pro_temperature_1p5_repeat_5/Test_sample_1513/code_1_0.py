def solve_riddle():
    """
    Solves the riddle by identifying the island town that meets the specified criteria.

    Clues:
    1. More than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.
    2. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.
    3. The bay/caldera shares the town's name.

    The town is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).
    - It is extremely remote (>2,000 km to the nearest inhabited land).
    - The town of Hanga Roa is on Hanga Roa Bay (shared name).
    - The entire island is volcanic, and while the bay itself is not a caldera,
      this is a common simplification in riddles.
