# The problem is solved by topological arguments rather than direct computation
# based on the vectors. The following steps outline the reasoning that leads
# to the answer.

# Step 1: Define the space M.
# M is a subset of H^4, which is equivalent to R^16.
# M is the complement of the union of 36 subspaces, i.e.,
# M = R^16 \ (H_1 U H_2 U ... U H_36)
# Each H_v is a vector subspace of R^16 of dimension 12.
# Let X = U H_v. X is a closed set in R^16.

# Step 2: Apply Alexander Duality.
# Alexander Duality states that for a closed proper subset X of R^n,
# H_tilde^q(R^n \ X) is isomorphic to H_tilde_{n-q-1}(X).
# Here n=16, q=9.
# We are interested in the dimension of H^9(M, Q), which is H_tilde^9(M, Q) for q=9>0.
# So, dim(H^9(M, Q)) = dim(H_tilde_{16-9-1}(X, Q)) = dim(H_tilde_6(X, Q)).

# Step 3: Use the Nerve Lemma to find the homotopy type of X.
# The Nerve Lemma states that if a space is covered by a collection of sets
# where all finite intersections are contractible (a "good cover"), then the space
# is homotopy equivalent to the nerve of the cover.
# Our space is X = U H_v, covered by the subspaces {H_v}.
# - Each H_v is a vector subspace of R^16, so it is contractible.
# - Any intersection of these subspaces (e.g., H_u intersect H_v) is also a
#   vector subspace, and thus also contractible.
# So the cover is good, and X is homotopy equivalent to the Nerve of the cover.

# Step 4: Describe the Nerve.
# The Nerve is a simplicial complex. Its vertices correspond to the 36 subspaces H_v.
# A set of vertices forms a simplex if their corresponding subspaces have a
# non-empty intersection.
# Since each H_v is a subspace containing the origin, ANY intersection of these
# subspaces contains the origin and is thus non-empty.
# This means any subset of vertices forms a simplex.
# The Nerve is the complete simplex on 36 vertices, which is Delta^35.

# Step 5: Compute the homology of the Nerve.
# Delta^35 is contractible. A contractible space has trivial reduced homology.
# H_tilde_k(Delta^35, Q) = 0 for all k >= 0.

# Step 6: Conclude the calculation.
# Since X is homotopy equivalent to Delta^35, X is also contractible.
# Therefore, H_tilde_6(X, Q) = 0.
# From Step 2, dim(H^9(M, Q)) = dim(H_tilde_6(X, Q)).
# Thus, the dimension is 0.
