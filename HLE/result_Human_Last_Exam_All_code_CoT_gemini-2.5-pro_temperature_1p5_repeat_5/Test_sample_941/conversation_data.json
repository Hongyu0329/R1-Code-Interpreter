    "My plan is to analyze the training methodologies of the five ballet schools provided in the answer choices, specifically focusing on their approach to pointe work during barre exercises. I will create a Python script that encodes this information and identifies the school most known for this practice.\n\nHere is the breakdown of the plan:\n1.  **Research:** I will gather information on the training styles of La Scala, Vaganova, The Royal Ballet, the School of American Ballet (SAB), and Bolshoi. The key point of research will be whether their curriculum emphasizes doing barre exercises on pointe.\n2.  **Data Representation:** I will store this information in a Python dictionary. Each school will be a key, and its value will be another dictionary containing its primary training method and a numerical score representing the emphasis on pointe work at the barre (e.g., 0 for low, 2 for high).\n3.  **Analysis in Code:** The script will iterate through this data structure to find the school with the highest score, programmatically determining the correct answer.\n4.  **Output:** The code will print the \"analysis\" for each school, showing its score, and then declare the final conclusion based on the analysis. This method fulfills the request to use code to solve the task and to output numbers in the process.\n\nThe research indicates that the School of American Ballet, founded by George Balanchine, is distinct in its emphasis on training on pointe from the barre onward to build speed, strength, and integrate the pointe shoe as a natural extension of the foot. Other methods typically build foundational strength in soft shoes at the barre before moving to extensive pointe work.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_ballet_school_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes ballet schools to identify which is known for extensive\n    pointe work at the barre.\n    \n    The scoring system is as follows:\n    0: Barre work is primarily done in soft shoes.\n    1: Some pointe work is incorporated into barre, but it is not the primary mode.\n    2: A significant portion of barre work is done on pointe as a core part of the methodology.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    schools_data = {\n        'A.
