    """
    Analyzes the optimal rate of convergence for the given stochastic logistic regression problem.

    The standard optimal rate for a Lipschitz-continuous stochastic convex optimization
    problem is Theta(D / sqrt(T)), where D is the diameter of the feasible set and T
    is the number of samples.

    In this problem, the feasible set is a ball of radius D, so its diameter is 2D.
    The rate is therefore Theta(D / sqrt(T)).

    The problem specifies the regime T = O(exp(D)). For asymptotic analysis, we consider
    the boundary T = Theta(exp(D)), which implies D = Theta(log(T)).

    Substituting D = Theta(log(T)) into the rate formula gives:
    Rate = Theta(log(T) / sqrt(T)).

    We now compare this derived rate with the given options.

    # As T -> infinity, log(T) also -> infinity.
    # Therefore, log(T)/sqrt(T) converges to 0 slower than 1/sqrt(T).
    # Let's check the ordering of the rates of convergence (faster is better).
    # A > B > C > Derived Rate
    # Rate A: 1/T
    # Rate B: 1/T^(2/3) = (1/T) * T^(1/3) -> Slower than A
    # Rate C: 1/T^(1/2) = (1/T^(2/3)) * T^(1/6) -> Slower than B
    # Derived Rate: log(T)/T^(1/2) = (1/T^(1/2)) * log(T) -> Slower than C
