# Define the diameter of the quarter-sphere package
package_diameter = 250.0

# Calculate the radius of the package
package_radius = package_diameter / 2.0

# Calculate the theoretical maximum diameter of the inscribed sphere using the derived formula.
# The formula is d = package_diameter / (sqrt(3) + 1)
sqrt_3 = math.sqrt(3)
denominator = sqrt_3 + 1
theoretical_max_diameter = package_diameter / denominator

# Since available spheres have diameters in 0.01 cm increments, we must find the
# largest multiple of 0.01 that is less than or equal to the theoretical maximum.
# This is done by flooring the value to two decimal places.
final_diameter = math.floor(theoretical_max_diameter * 100) / 100

# --- Output the reasoning and the final equation with its numbers ---
