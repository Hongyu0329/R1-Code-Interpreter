    We have two types of bacteria:
    1. Bacterium 1: Evolves quickly via frequent lateral gene transfer (LGT).
    2. Bacterium 2: Evolves slowly via rare mutations in a stable genome.
    
    The paradox is that both acquire drug resistance at an equal pace.
    The question is: How is this possible for Bacterium 2?

Cross-resistance (one mutation providing resistance to multiple drugs) allows for a massive evolutionary leap. Compensatory mutations would offset any fitness cost from the resistance mutation, allowing the new strain to thrive and spread rapidly. This combination could plausibly match the pace of LGT.",

        'D': "'...mutations that did not have compensatory mutations...led to cross-resistance.' - While cross-resistance is powerful, the lack of compensatory mutations would likely mean the resistant strain has a fitness cost, making it less competitive and slowing its spread. This makes it less likely to keep pace.",
        
        'E': "'...acquired compensatory mutations that followed the rare resistance mutations.' - This explains how a resistant strain can persist and spread by overcoming fitness costs, but it's missing the key component of cross-resistance to explain the rapid acquisition of resistance to multiple challenges, which is needed to match the pace of Bacterium 1."
