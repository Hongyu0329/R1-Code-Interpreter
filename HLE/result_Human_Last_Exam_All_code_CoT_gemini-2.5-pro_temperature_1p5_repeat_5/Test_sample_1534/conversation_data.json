    "My plan is to answer this biological question by referencing established neuroanatomical knowledge about cephalopods, specifically the cuttlefish.\n\n1.  First, I will identify the major brain structures in a cuttlefish, focusing on the sub-esophageal mass, which controls many motor and visceral functions.\n2.  Next, I will locate the palliovisceral lobe within this mass. It is a large, posterior lobe.\n3.  Finally, I will identify the specific lobes that are anatomically situated directly posterior to the palliovisceral lobe.\n4.  As per the instructions, I will present this information using a Python script that prints the answer in a clear sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_adjacent_brain_regions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the brain regions located\n    posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in a cuttlefish.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The palliovisceral lobe is a major component of the sub-esophageal mass.\n    # Based on cephalopod neuroanatomy, the lobes posterior to it are primarily for fin and vasomotor control.\n    posterior_lobes = [\"posterior fin lobes\", \"vasomotor lobes\"]\n\n    # Construct the descriptive sentence for the output\n    answer = (\n        \"The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe \"\n        \"in the dwarf cuttlefish are the {0} and the {1}.\"\n        .format(posterior_lobes[0], posterior_lobes[1])\n    )\n\n    print(answer)\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_adjacent_brain_regions()\n```\n<<<The brain regions that lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish are the posterior fin lobes and the vasomotor lobes.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
