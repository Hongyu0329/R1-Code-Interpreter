    "Of course. To find the largest prime divisor of 8139881, I will use a method called trial division. Here is my step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Start with the number:** I will begin with the number `n = 8139881`.\n2.  **Collect factors:** I will create an empty list to store all the prime factors I find.\n3.  **Handle the factor '2':** First, I'll check if the number is divisible by 2. If it is, I'll add 2 to my list of factors and divide the number by 2, repeating this until it is no longer even.\n4.  **Handle odd factors:** Since any remaining factors must be odd, I will then loop through odd numbers (3, 5, 7, and so on), checking for divisibility. For each odd number that is a factor, I will add it to my list and divide `n` by it. I will repeat this for the same factor until it no longer divides `n` evenly.\n5.  **Optimization:** This check for odd factors only needs to go up to the square root of the current value of `n`. This is because if `n` has a prime factor larger than its square root, it must also have one that is smaller, which would have already been found.\n6.  **The final factor:** After the loop finishes, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this value is itself a prime factor and will be added to the list.\n7.  **Identify the largest and display:** Finally, the script will find the maximum value in the list of factors. It will print the complete prime factorization in an equation format, and then state the largest prime factor found.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_prime_divisor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all prime factors of 8139881, prints the factorization,\n    and identifies the largest prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 8139881\n    original_n = n\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle the factor 2, if any\n    while n % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        n //= 2\n\n    # Handle odd factors starting from 3\n    # We only need to check up to the square root of the current n\n    i = 3\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            n //= i\n        else:\n            i += 2\n\n    # If n is still greater than 1 at the end, it is a prime factor itself.\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.append(n)\n\n    # Determine the result and print the output\n    if not factors:\n        # This case would only occur for n=1\n        largest_prime = 1\n        print(f\"The number {original_n} has no prime factors.\")\n    elif len(factors) == 1:\n        # This is the case for a prime number\n        largest_prime = original_n\n        print(f\"{original_n} is a prime number.\")\n    else:\n        # Print the full prime factorization equation\n        equation = f\"{original_n} = \" + \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(equation)\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {original_n} is {largest_prime}.\")\n\n\n# Run the function to solve the problem\nfind_largest_prime_divisor()\n\n<<<8139881>>>\n```"
