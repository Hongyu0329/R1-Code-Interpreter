    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of a given conductor $d$ and order $k$, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Prime Factorization of the Conductor**: First, we find the prime factorization of the conductor $d$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with conductor $d = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ can be uniquely expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive Dirichlet character with conductor $p_i^{a_i}$.\n\n2.  **Order of the Character**: The order of the product character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n\n3.  **Counting Component Characters**: For each prime power factor $p_i^{a_i}$ of the conductor, we need to count the number of available primitive characters of different orders. The number of primitive characters of conductor $p^a$ and order $k$ is related to Euler's totient function, $\\phi(k)$. For a simple prime conductor $p$ (i.e., $a=1$), a character is primitive if and only if it's not the principal character (which has order 1). The number of characters of order $k>1$ modulo $p$ is $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\n\n4.  **Combinatorial Calculation**: We combine the counts from each factor to find the total number of characters that satisfy the overall order requirement. This is typically done using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet's apply this to your specific problem:\n*   Conductor $d = 53599$\n*   Order $k = 6$\n\n**Step-by-step execution:**\n\n1.  **Factorize d**: $d = 53599 = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$. The conductor is a product of four distinct odd primes. This means we are looking for a character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\chi_3 \\chi_4$, where $\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4$ are primitive characters with conductors 7, 13, 19, and 31 respectively. A character mod a prime $p$ is primitive if its order is greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Order Condition**: We need $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\text{ord}(\\chi_3), \\text{ord}(\\chi_4)) = 6$. This implies that for each component character $\\chi_i$, its order must be a divisor of 6 and greater than 1, so $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i) \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n3.  **Count Characters per Prime Factor**:\n    *   For $p=7$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(7)=6$.\n    *   For $p=13$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(13)=12$.\n    *   For $p=19$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(19)=18$.\n    *   For $p=31$, the group of characters has order $\\phi(31)=30$.\n\n    For each prime factor $p_i$, its corresponding $p_i-1$ is a multiple of 6. Therefore, for each of these prime conductors, there exist primitive characters of orders 2, 3, and 6. The number of such characters of order $k$ is given by $\\phi(k)$:\n    *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$\n    *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$\n    *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Number**: We use the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. A character has order 6 if and only if the lcm of the orders of its components has a factor of 2 and a factor of 3.\n    *   First, let's count all tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_1, \\chi_2, \\chi_3, \\chi_4)$ where each order divides 6 (i.e., order is 2, 3, or 6). For each of the 4 prime factors, we have $\\phi(2)+\\phi(3)+\\phi(6) = 1+2+2 = 5$ choices. Total combinations: $5^4 = 625$.\n    *   From this, we subtract the combinations where the lcm order is not 6. This happens if all component orders divide 3, or if all component orders divide 2.\n    *   Case 1: All orders divide 3. This means each character must have order 3. For each of the 4 factors, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ choices. Total combinations: $2^4 = 16$.\n    *   Case 2: All orders divide 2. This means each character must have order 2. For each of the 4 factors, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ choice. Total combinations: $1^4 = 1$.\n    *   The intersection of these two cases is empty (an order cannot divide both 2 and 3 without being 1, which is not allowed for primitive characters).\n    *   The final count is the total minus the exceptions: $625 - 16 - 1 = 608$.\n\nThe following Python code automates this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = n\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    result = n\n    for p in factors:\n        result -= result // p\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem of finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters\n    of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    order = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {order}.\")\n    \n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The prime factorization of the conductor is d = {' * '.join(map(str, sorted(d_factors.keys())))}.\")\n    \n    is_square_free = all(v == 1 for v in d_factors.values())\n    if not is_square_free:\n        print(\"The conductor is not square-free.
