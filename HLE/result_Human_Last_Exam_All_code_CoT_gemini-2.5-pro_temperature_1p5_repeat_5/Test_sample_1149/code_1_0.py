# The species in question
species = "Irritator challengeri"

# The specific anatomical feature
feature = "lacrimal recess"

# According to paleontological analysis of the Irritator challengeri skull,
# the lacrimal recess contains a specific number of depressions.
# We will assign this number, based on the scientific literature, to a variable.
number_of_depressions = 2

# We will now print the answer clearly.
# The final equation is simply stating the value found.
