    "Based on scientific descriptions of the *Irritator challengeri* skull, specifically the holotype SMNS 58022, we can determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess. The plan is to consult the paleontological data and then represent this finding using a Python script.\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The subject is the dinosaur *Irritator challengeri*.\n2.  **Identify the Feature:** We are looking for the number of depressions within the lacrimal recess, which is part of the antorbital fossa on the skull.\n3.  **Consult Scientific Literature:** The key paper redescribing the skull (Sues et al., 2002) notes that the lacrimal recess contains two subsidiary openings.\n4.  **Code the Finding:** Assign this number to a variable and print the result in a descriptive sentence, as requested.\n\n```python\n# The species in question\nspecies = \"Irritator challengeri\"\n\n# The specific anatomical feature\nfeature = \"lacrimal recess\"\n\n# According to paleontological analysis of the Irritator challengeri skull,\n# the lacrimal recess contains a specific number of depressions.\n# We will assign this number, based on the scientific literature, to a variable.\nnumber_of_depressions = 2\n\n# We will now print the answer clearly.\n# The final equation is simply stating the value found.\nprint(f\"Based on the analysis, the number of depressions the {feature} in {species} contains is {number_of_depressions}.\")\nprint(f\"Final count: Number of depressions = {number_of_depressions}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many depressions does the lacrimal recess in Irritator challengeri contain?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
