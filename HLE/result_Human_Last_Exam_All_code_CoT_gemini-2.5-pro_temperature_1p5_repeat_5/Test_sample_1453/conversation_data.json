    "To determine the oligomeric state of the protein sequence, we first need to identify its heptad repeat (`abcdefg`). The residues at the `a` and `d` positions are critical as they form the hydrophobic core, and their specific identities and packing arrangement dictate the number of helices in the coiled-coil.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Heptad Repeat Frame:** I will write a Python script to test all 7 possible frames for the heptad repeat.\n2.  **Score Each Frame:** For each frame, I will calculate a hydrophobicity score based on the Kyte-Doolittle scale for the residues at the core `a` and `d` positions. A higher score indicates a more stable hydrophobic core.\n3.  **Analyze the Best Frame:** The frame with the highest hydrophobicity score is the most likely correct register. I will analyze the specific amino acids found at the `a` and `d` positions in this frame.\n4.  **Predict Oligomeric State:** Based on established principles of \"knobs-into-holes\" packing:\n    *   A repeating pattern of small residues (like Alanine) at `a` and large residues (like Leucine) at `d` often indicates a **dimer**.\n    *   A core composed entirely of bulky hydrophobic residues, especially beta-branched ones like Isoleucine or Valine at the `d` position, strongly suggests a **trimer** due to efficient packing.\n    *   Alternating polar and non-polar residues in the core are often found in higher-order oligomers.\n\nThe script will identify the best frame and print the resulting core residues and the calculation for its hydrophobicity score, which will allow us to make a final prediction.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_oligomeric_state(sequence):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a coiled-coil sequence to predict its heptad register and oligomeric state.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale\n    kd_scale = {'I': 4.5, 'V': 4.2, 'L': 3.8, 'F': 2.8, 'C': 2.5, 'M': 1.9, 'A': 1.8,\n                'G': -0.4, 'T': -0.7, 'S': -0.8, 'W': -0.9, 'Y': -1.3, 'P': -1.6,\n                'H': -3.2, 'E': -3.5, 'Q': -3.5, 'D': -3.5, 'N': -3.5, 'K': -3.9, 'R': -4.5}\n\n    best_frame = -1\n    max_score = -float('inf')\n    best_residues = {}\n\n    # Iterate through all 7 possible frames (0-6)\n    for frame_offset in range(7):\n        a_residues = []\n        d_residues = []\n        current_score = 0\n\n        # Assign residues to a,b,c,d,e,f,g positions\n        # pos_in_heptad = (sequence_index - frame_offset) % 7\n        # 'a' is position 0, 'd' is position 3\n        for i, res in enumerate(sequence):\n            pos = (i - frame_offset) % 7\n            if pos == 0:  # 'a' position\n                a_residues.append(res)\n                current_score += kd_scale.get(res, 0)\n            elif pos == 3:  # 'd' position\n                d_residues.append(res)\n                current_score += kd_scale.get(res, 0)\n        \n        if current_score > max_score:\n            max_score = current_score\n            best_frame = frame_offset\n            best_residues = {'a': a_residues, 'd': d_residues}\n\n    # Analyze the best frame\n    print(\"Analysis of the protein sequence:\")\n    print(f\"Sequence: {sequence}\\n\")\n    print(f\"The most likely heptad frame starts with residue at index {best_frame} as part of the 'g' position \"\n          f\"(or more precisely, the residue at index {best_frame} is assigned position 'a').\")\n    \n    a_res_str = \"\".join(best_residues['a'])\n    d_res_str = \"\".join(best_residues['d'])\n    \n    print(f\"Core 'a' position residues: {a_res_str}\")\n    print(f\"Core 'd' position residues: {d_res_str}\\n\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string\n    a_terms = [f\"{res}({kd_scale.get(res, 0)})\" for res in best_residues['a']]\n    d_terms = [f\"{res}({kd_scale.get(res, 0)})\" for res in best_residues['d']]\n    \n    print(\"Hydrophobicity Score Calculation (Kyte-Doolittle):\")\n    print(f\"Score = ({' + '.join(a_terms)}) + ({' + '.join(d_terms)})\")\n    print(f\"Final Score = {max_score:.2f}\\n\")\n    \n    # Interpretation based on common coiled-coil motifs\n    a_counts = collections.Counter(best_residues['a'])\n    d_counts = collections.Counter(best_residues['d'])\n\n    interpretation = \"\"\n    # Classic trimer signal: high prevalence of I, L, V in core, esp.
