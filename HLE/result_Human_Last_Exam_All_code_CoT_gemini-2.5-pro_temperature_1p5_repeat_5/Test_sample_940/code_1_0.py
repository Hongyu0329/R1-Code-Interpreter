    # Choice A: Apis mellifera (European Honey Bee)
    # Impact: Introduced and widespread. It can outcompete native pollinators,
    # but its role in agriculture is vital. The impact is complex, not purely negative.
    print("A. Apis mellifera: Has a complex impact, both negative (competition with native bees) and positive (pollination for agriculture).")

    # Choice B: Aedes aegypti (Yellow Fever Mosquito)
    # Impact: Introduced and established in southern New Mexico. It is a vector for
    # dangerous diseases like Zika, dengue, and chikungunya. This poses a severe
    # public health threat, which is a major negative impact.
    print("B. Aedes aegypti: An introduced disease vector established in NM, posing a significant threat to public health.")

    # Choice C: Lycorma delicatula (Spotted Lanternfly)
    # Impact: A highly destructive pest in the eastern US, but it is not
    # currently established in New Mexico. Its impact there is negligible.
    print("C. Lycorma delicatula: Not established in New Mexico, so its current impact is minimal.")

    # Choice D: Bombus pascuorum (Common Carder Bee)
    # Impact: A European bumblebee that is not present in North America.
    # It cannot be an invasive species in New Mexico.
    print("D. Bombus pascuorum: Not found in North America.")
    
    # Choice E: Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Colorado Potato Beetle)
    # Impact: This beetle is native to the Colorado/New Mexico region. While it's
    # a major agricultural pest, it is not an *introduced* invasive species here.
    print("E. Leptinotarsa decemlineata: A pest, but it is native to the region, not an introduced species.")

    # Choice F: Maruca vitrata (Bean Pod Borer)
    # Impact: An agricultural pest, but its impact in New Mexico is less
    # significant than that of major disease vectors.
    print("F. Maruca vitrata: A pest with a lesser overall impact compared to others.")

    print("\nConclusion: Based on the analysis, Aedes aegypti has the largest negative impact as an introduced species in New Mexico due to its role as a vector for serious human diseases.")
