    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this poker theory question using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish the Poker Context:** The question is about an open-raising range from the button in a 100BB No-Limit Hold'em cash game. According to Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles, the button has the widest opening range of any position (excluding the blinds).\n2.  **Define the Range:** For this specific scenario, a standard GTO opening range from the button includes all suited Jack combinations (from J2s up to JAs). They are all considered profitable hands to open-raise.\n3.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** The \"worst\" hand among a group of profitable hands is the one with the lowest expected value. For suited hands like Jxs, this value is primarily determined by the rank of the kicker (the 'x' card). Therefore, the worst hand to open is the one with the lowest-ranked kicker.\n4.  **Automate with Python:** I will write a script to formalize this logic.\n    *   I'll create a dictionary to map card characters ('A', 'K', 'Q', etc.) to their numerical ranks.\n    *   The script will iterate through all the suited Jack hands that are considered standard opens.\n    *   To fulfill the request to \"output each number in the final equation\", the script will print each hand and its corresponding kicker's numerical rank, demonstrating the comparison.\n    *   Finally, the script will identify and print the hand with the lowest kicker rank.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute this plan:\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack_to_open():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the worst suited Jack to open-raise from the button\n    in a 100BB cash game based on standard Game Theory Optimal (GTO) strategy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In GTO poker theory, the button's opening range is wide and includes\n    # all suited Jack combinations because they are all profitable raises.\n    gto_opening_range_suited_jacks = [\n        \"JAs\", \"JKs\", \"JQs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\",\n        \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"\n    ]\n\n    # To find the \"worst\" hand, we find the one with the lowest-ranked kicker.\n    # We assign numerical values to each card to perform this comparison.\n    card_ranks = {\n        'A': 14, 'K': 13, 'Q': 12, 'T': 10, '9': 9,\n        '8': 8, '7': 7, '6': 6, '5': 5, '4': 4, '3': 3, '2': 2\n    }\n\n    worst_hand_found = \"\"\n    # We start with a very high number to ensure the first hand's rank is lower.\n    lowest_kicker_rank = float('inf')\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the kicker strength of all suited Jacks in the button's opening range:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Iterate through the list of hands to find the one with the weakest kicker.\n    for hand in gto_opening_range_suited_jacks:\n        # The kicker is the second character in the hand's name (e.g., 'A' in \"JAs\").\n        kicker_character = hand[1]\n        kicker_rank_value = card_ranks[kicker_character]\n\n        # Output the hand and its kicker's numerical rank for comparison.\n        print(f\"Hand: {hand}, Kicker: '{kicker_character}', Kicker Rank: {kicker_rank_value}\")\n\n        # Check if this kicker's rank is the lowest we have seen so far.\n        if kicker_rank_value < lowest_kicker_rank:\n            lowest_kicker_rank = kicker_rank_value\n            worst_hand_found = hand\n\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"The hand with the minimum kicker rank ({lowest_kicker_rank}) is the 'worst' suited Jack to open.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_hand_found}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_worst_suited_jack_to_open()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
