    This script calculates the values for the parameters beta and alpha^2
    based on the principles of N=1, d=3+1 Supergravity.

    Calculation for beta:
    The variation of the cosmological constant term L_cos is given by:
    δL_cos = α(δe)[S + κβ(ψ-bilinear)] + αe[δS + κβδ(ψ-bilinear)]

    We demand that the terms linear in S cancel. Let's analyze the contributions:
    1. From α(δe)S: Contributes (1/2) * (ε̄γψ).
    2. From the S-dependent part of δS: The R_cov term has an S-dependent part, R_cov = R - (κ/2)S(γψ).
       δS = (1/4)ε̄γ(R_cov). The S-part is δS_S = -(κ/8)S(ε̄γ(γψ)). Using γ_μγ^{μν}ψ_ν = 3γ^νψ_ν, this becomes
       -(3κ/8)S(ε̄γψ). This term comes from - (2/3)eS(δS) in the original Lagrangian variation which gets cancelled, but for L_cos, the term is αeδS. Let's assume the question meant to follow the standard model where R_cov^μ = R^μ - (κ/2)S γ^{μν}ψ_ν.
       The S-linear part of αeδS is αe * (1/4) * ε̄γ_μ * (-(κ/2)Sγ^{μν}ψ_ν) = -(3/8)αeκS(ε̄γψ).
    3. From the S-dependent part of δ(ψ-bilinear): δψ_ν contains (1/6)γ_νSε.
       δ(ψ̄γψ) = ψ̄γ(δψ) + (δψ̄)γψ = (1/6)S(ψ̄γγε + ε̄γγψ).
       Using γ_μγ^{μν}=3γ^ν and γ^{μν}γ_ν=3γ^μ, this is (1/2)S(ψ̄γε + ε̄γψ).
       The contribution is αeκβ * (1/2)S * (ψ̄γε + ε̄γψ).

    For Majorana spinors, we have the identity: ψ̄γε = ε̄γψ.
    Summing the coefficients of αeκS(ε̄γψ):
    1/2 - 3/8 + β = 0  =>  1/8 + β = 0  => β = -1/8.

    Calculation for alpha^2:
    The bosonic part of the Lagrangian is L_bos = -(e/2κ^2)R - (e/3)S^2 + αeS.
    The equation of motion for S is dL/dS = 0:
    - (2e/3)S + αe = 0  => S_0 = 3α/2.
    Substituting this VEV S_0 back into the Lagrangian:
    L_bosonic_vev = -(e/2κ^2)R - (e/3)(3α/2)^2 + αe(3α/2)
                  = -(e/2κ^2)R - (e/3)(9α^2/4) + 3eα^2/2
                  = -(e/2κ^2)R - 3eα^2/4 + 6eα^2/4
                  = -(e/2κ^2)R + (3/4)eα^2
    This is the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant term. We can write it as:
    L = (e/2κ^2) * [-R + (3/2)κ^2α^2]
    So the cosmological constant is Λ = (3/2)κ^2α^2.
    For a spacetime of constant curvature, the Ricci scalar R and Λ are related by R = -4Λ (in d=4).
    R = -4 * (3/2)κ^2α^2 = -6κ^2α^2.
    Therefore, α^2 = -R / (6κ^2).
    The question asks for the number of α^2 in terms of R, which is the coefficient -1/(6κ^2). Assuming κ=1 for simplicity.
