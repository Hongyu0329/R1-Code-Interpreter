    "Here is a step-by-step plan to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$.\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, we must confirm that the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial of degree 4 has a Galois group that is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion on a shifted version of the polynomial, $P(x+a)$, to prove this.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial provides key information. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is $\\Delta = 256q^3 - 27p^4$. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square of a rational number, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$.\n3.  **Form and Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: The resolvent cubic for $x^4 + px + q = 0$ is $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = 0$. Whether this cubic is reducible or irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ further constrains the possible Galois groups. If it is reducible (has a rational root), the Galois group is a subgroup of the dihedral group $D_4$.\n4.  **Synthesize Results and Distinguish Cases**: By combining the information from the discriminant and the resolvent cubic, we can narrow down the possible Galois groups. In this case, we will find that the group is either $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4).\n5.  **Apply Final Criterion**: A final test is needed to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. We will use a standard criterion based on the coefficients of the polynomial and the rational root of the resolvent cubic.\n6.  **Determine the Order**: Once the group is identified, its order is known. The python code below will perform the necessary calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a number is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False, -1\n    if n == 0:\n        return True, 0\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    return x * x == n, x\n\ndef solve_cubic_rational_roots(a3, a2, a1, a0):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds integer rational roots of a cubic equation a3*x^3 + a2*x^2 + a1*x + a0 = 0\n    using the rational root theorem for integer coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    if a0 == 0:\n        return [0] \n\n    # Find divisors of the constant term a0\n    divisors_a0 = []\n    for i in range(1, int(abs(a0)**0.5) + 1):\n        if a0 % i == 0:\n            divisors_a0.extend([i, -i])\n            if i*i != abs(a0):\n                divisors_a0.extend([a0 // i, -(a0 // i)])\n    \n    rational_roots = []\n    for root in sorted(list(set(divisors_a0))):\n        if a3 * root**3 + a2 * root**2 + a1 * root + a0 == 0:\n            rational_roots.append(root)\n            \n    return rational_roots\n\n# --- Main computation ---\nprint(\"Computing the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14\\n\")\n\n# The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + px + q\np = 8\nq = 14\nprint(f\"The polynomial is P(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}.\")\n\n# Step 1: Irreducibility\nprint(\"\\nStep 1: Checking irreducibility of P(x) over Q.\")\nprint(\"Consider the shifted polynomial P(x-2) = (x-2)^4 + 8(x-2) + 14\")\nprint(\"P(x-2) = x^4 - 8x^3 + 24x^2 - 24x + 14\")\nprint(\"By Eisenstein's criterion with prime p=2:\")\nprint(\"- 2 divides all coefficients (-8, 24, -24, 14) except the leading one.\")\nprint(\"- 2^2=4 does not divide the constant term 14.\")\nprint(\"Thus, P(x-2) is irreducible, which implies P(x) is irreducible over Q.\")\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\nprint(\"\\nStep 2: Calculating the discriminant Delta.\")\ndelta = 256 * (q**3) - 27 * (p**4)\nprint(f\"Delta = 256 * q^3 - 27 * p^4\")\nprint(f\"Delta = 256 * {q}^3 - 27 * {p}^4\")\nprint(f\"Delta = {256 * q**3} - {27 * p**4} = {delta}\")\n\n# Step 3: Check if discriminant is a perfect square\nis_sq, _ = is_perfect_square(delta)\nprint(\"\\nStep 3: Checking if Delta is a perfect square.\")\nif is_sq:\n    print(f\"Delta = {delta} is a perfect square.
