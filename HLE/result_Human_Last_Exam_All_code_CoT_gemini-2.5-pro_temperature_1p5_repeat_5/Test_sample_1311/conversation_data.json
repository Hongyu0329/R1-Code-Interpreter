    "To determine the binding affinity, I will perform a search in a public bioactivity database, ChEMBL. The provided chemical name is very complex, which can make direct searches difficult. I will use its common name, **samuraciclib** (also known as SY-1365), which is more suitable for database queries.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Install the necessary Python library, `chembl_webresource_client`, to interact with the ChEMBL database.\n2.  Use the library to find the unique ChEMBL ID for the compound \"samuraciclib\".\n3.  Find the unique ChEMBL ID for the human protein target \"Cyclin-dependent kinase 7\" (CDK7).\n4.  Query the database for bioactivity data, specifically the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration), which is a common measure of a drug's potency and serves as a proxy for binding affinity.\n5.  Extract and print the IC50 value.\n6.  Compare the retrieved value to the given answer choices to determine the correct range.\n\n```python\ndef find_binding_affinity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the binding affinity of a compound to a target protein\n    by querying the ChEMBL database.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        from chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n    except ImportError:\n        print(\"Required library not found.\")\n        print(\"Please install it by running: pip install chembl_webresource_client\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 1: Define compound and target\n    # The common name for the provided molecule is samuraciclib.\n    compound_name = 'SAMURACICLIB'\n    target_name = 'Cyclin-dependent kinase 7'\n    target_organism = 'Homo sapiens'\n\n    print(f\"--- Task: Find binding affinity of {compound_name} to {target_name} ---\")\n\n    try:\n        # Step 2: Find the molecule's ChEMBL ID\n        print(f\"\\n1.
