def solve_translation_puzzle():
    """
    This function identifies the correct translation practices and formats the output.
    The challenge in the stories is a plot-critical phonetic pun in English.
    We need to select practices that can convey this type of clue in another language.
    
    I. Transcreation: Creates an analogous pun in the target language. (Capable)
    II. Embedded audio: Lets the user hear the original English pun. (Capable)
    III. Changing setting: Doesn't solve the linguistic problem on its own. (Not capable)
    IV. Foreigner with accent: Provides an in-story reason for a new pun. (Capable)
    V. Illustration: Cannot represent a phonetic clue. (Not capable)
    VI. Footnotes: Explains the original pun to the reader. (Capable)
    
    The selected options are I, II, IV, and VI.
