    "My plan is to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth by comparing their abundances. The vast majority of these gases are found in the atmosphere, so atmospheric concentration is an excellent proxy for their overall abundance in terrestrial matter. The abundance of these gases has not changed significantly, so data from around 2002 is consistent with current standard values.\n\n1.  I will list the noble gases: Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  I will gather their standard atmospheric abundance, represented as a percentage.\n3.  Radon (Rn) is radioactive with a very short half-life, and its steady-state concentration is exceedingly low, making it much rarer than the stable noble gases. Xenon (Xe) is the rarest of the stable noble gases. The question asks for the rarest overall, which would be Radon.\n4.  I will write a Python script that stores these percentage abundances in a dictionary.\n5.  The script will then programmatically find the gas with the minimum abundance value.\n6.  Finally, the script will print the name of the rarest gas and its approximate percentage, formatted to resemble a final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth by comparing their\n    atmospheric abundances, which serve as a reliable proxy for their\n    concentration in all terrestrial matter.
