    "In this problem, we need to calculate the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a 10-node barbell graph during a single step of randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### My Plan:\n1.  **Deconstruct the Barbell Graph:** A barbell graph with `N=10` nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of size `m=N/2=5`, connected by a single edge, which is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Understand Randomized Uniform Gossiping:** This process involves two steps:\n    a. A node `u` is selected uniformly at random from all `N` nodes in the graph. The probability of picking any specific node is `1/N`.\n    b. The selected node `u` then chooses one of its neighbors `v` uniformly at random to contact. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor `v` is `1/degree(u)`.\n    The edge `(u, v)` is then considered \"sampled\".\n3.  **Identify the Bottleneck Edge:** Let the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge be `u` and `v`.\n4.  **Calculate Node Degrees:**\n    *   Any node that is *not* part of the bottleneck connection is connected only to other nodes within its own `K_5` clique. Its degree is `m-1 = 5-1 = 4`.\n    *   The two nodes `u` and `v` that form the bottleneck edge are each connected to `m-1=4` nodes in their own clique, plus the single node from the other clique. Therefore, their degree is `(m-1) + 1 = m = 5`.\n5.  **Calculate the Probability:** The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if either of these two mutually exclusive events happens:\n    a. Node `u` is selected and it chooses to gossip to node `v`.\n    b. Node `v` is selected and it chooses to gossip to node `u`.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these two events.\n6.  **Develop the Python Code:** The code will perform the calculation based on the formula derived and print a clear explanation of how the result was obtained, including the final equation with all numbers.\n\nThis will give us the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A barbell graph with N nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of size m=N/2,\n    # connected by a single edge (the bottleneck).\n    m = total_nodes / 2\n\n    # The two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge have a degree of (m-1) from connections\n    # within their own clique, plus 1 for the bottleneck edge itself.\n    degree_bridge_node = (m - 1) + 1\n\n    # In randomized uniform gossiping, a node is picked uniformly at random from all nodes,\n    # and then it picks a neighbor uniformly at random.\n\n    # The bottleneck edge (u, v) is sampled if:\n    # 1.
