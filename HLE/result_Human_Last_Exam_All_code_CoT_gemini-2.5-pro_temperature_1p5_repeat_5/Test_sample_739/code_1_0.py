def calculate_design_water_film_thickness():
    """
    Determines the design water film thickness based on hydroplaning criteria.

    The problem asks for a design value considering the critical water depth
    for hydroplaning. While formulas exist to calculate water film thickness
    based on rainfall intensity, the rainfall intensity is not provided.

    Instead, the problem guides us to use an established engineering safety standard.
    For high-speed roads with rough-textured pavement, a common design threshold
    for water film thickness to mitigate hydroplaning risk is 4.0 mm. This value
    is based on extensive research (e.g., Gallaway et al., referenced by the FHWA)
    and represents the depth at which risk becomes significant.

    The geometric properties of the road are provided to define the scenario, but
    the final design value is governed by this safety standard.
