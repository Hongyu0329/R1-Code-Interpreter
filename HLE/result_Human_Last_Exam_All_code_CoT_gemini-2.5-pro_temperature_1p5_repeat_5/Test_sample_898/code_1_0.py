# 1. Define the propositions from the problem statement.
#    a: relates to momentum
#    b, c: relate to position

prop_b_str = "b"
prop_c_str = "c"

print("Step 1: Understanding the Propositions")
print(f"Let 'a' be the proposition about momentum.")
print(f"Let 'b' be the proposition 'the particle is in the interval [-1, 1]'.")
print(f"Let 'c' be the proposition 'the particle is in the interval [-1, 3]'.\n")


# 2. Identify the key relationship between the propositions.

print(f"The position interval for '{prop_b_str}' ([-1, 1]) is a subset of the interval for '{prop_c_str}' ([-1, 3]).")
print(f"This means that if proposition '{prop_b_str}' is true, '{prop_c_str}' must also be true.")
print(f"In logic, this is written as: {prop_b_str} ⇒ {prop_c_str} ({prop_b_str} implies {prop_c_str}).\n")


# 3. Analyze the statement in Option C.
#    Option C: (¬(a ∧ b) → (a ∧ c)) ↔ (a ∧ (b ∨ c))
#    Using the classical definition of material implication (p → q ↔ ¬p ∨ q), the left side becomes:
#    ¬(¬(a ∧ b)) ∨ (a ∧ c)  which simplifies to (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c).
#    So, the entire statement is equivalent to the distributive law:
#    (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c) ↔ a ∧ (b ∨ c)
print("Step 3: Analyzing the Logical Equivalence in Option C")
print("The statement in Option C is equivalent to the distributive law for these propositions:")
print(f"({prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_b_str}) ∨ ({prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_c_str})  ↔  {prop_a_str} ∧ ({prop_b_str} ∨ {prop_c_str})\n")


# 4. Analyze the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of the equivalence.
print("Step 4: Simplifying the Right-Hand Side (RHS)")
rhs_original = f"{prop_a_str} ∧ ({prop_b_str} ∨ {prop_c_str})"
print(f"The RHS is: {rhs_original}")
print(f"Because '{prop_b_str} ⇒ {prop_c_str}', the disjunction '{prop_b_str} ∨ {prop_c_str}' is logically equivalent to the more general proposition, which is '{prop_c_str}'.")
rhs_simplified = f"{prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_c_str}"
print(f"Therefore, the RHS simplifies to: {rhs_simplified}\n")


# 5. Analyze the Left-Hand Side (LHS) of the equivalence.
print("Step 5: Simplifying the Left-Hand Side (LHS)")
lhs_original = f"({prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_b_str}) ∨ ({prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_c_str})"
print(f"The LHS is: {lhs_original}")
print(f"Since '{prop_b_str} ⇒ {prop_c_str}', it follows that the proposition '({prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_b_str})' implies the proposition '({prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_c_str})'.")
print("The disjunction of a more specific proposition and a more general one is simply the general proposition.")
lhs_simplified = f"{prop_a_str} ∧ {prop_c_str}"
print(f"Therefore, the LHS also simplifies to: {lhs_simplified}\n")


# 6. Final conclusion
print("Step 6: Conclusion")
print("We have demonstrated that for the given physical setup:")
print(f"LHS({lhs_original}) simplifies to '{lhs_simplified}'.")
print(f"RHS({rhs_original}) simplifies to '{rhs_simplified}'.")
print("\nSince both sides are equal, the equivalence holds. While the distributive law fails in general quantum logic, it is true in this special case due to the specific relationship between propositions b and c. This makes it the correct 'observable' logical feature of this system.")
