    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for toluene (C7H8) with a 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number of atoms:** Toluene has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set:**\n    *   **For each Hydrogen (H) atom:** The 1s orbital is represented by two contracted basis functions (a split-valence `3-1` representation). So, each H has 2 functions.\n    *   **For each Carbon (C) atom:**\n        *   The core 1s orbital is represented by one contracted basis function (from the `6`).\n        *   The valence 2s orbital is represented by two contracted basis functions (from the `3-1`).\n        *   The three valence 2p orbitals (px, py, pz) are each represented by two contracted basis functions (from the `3-1`).\n        *   Total for Carbon = 1 (for 1s) + 2 (for 2s) + 3 * 2 (for 2p) = 9 functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions for the molecule:** Multiply the number of each type of atom by its corresponding number of basis functions and sum the results.\n\nThe following Python script will perform this calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\n# Toluene molecule: C7H8\n# Basis set: 6-31G\n\n# 1. Define the number of atoms for each element\nnum_carbon_atoms = 7\nnum_hydrogen_atoms = 8\n\n# 2. Define the number of contracted basis functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1s (core) + 2s (valence) + 2p (valence)\n# 1s is represented by 1 function.\n# 2s is represented by 2 functions (split-valence).\n# Each of the three 2p orbitals is represented by 2 functions (split-valence).\n# Total for C = 1 (1s) + 2 (2s) + 3 * 2 (2p) = 9 functions.\nfunctions_per_carbon = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1s (valence)\n# 1s is represented by 2 functions (split-valence).\n# Total for H = 2 functions.\nfunctions_per_hydrogen = 2\n\n# 3. Calculate the total number of contracted functions for the molecule\ntotal_functions_carbon = num_carbon_atoms * functions_per_carbon\ntotal_functions_hydrogen = num_hydrogen_atoms * functions_per_hydrogen\ntotal_functions = total_functions_carbon + total_functions_hydrogen\n\n# 4. Print the calculation steps and the final result\nprint(\"Calculation for Toluene (C7H8) with 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"Number of Carbon atoms: {num_carbon_atoms}\")\nprint(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms: {num_hydrogen_atoms}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Carbon atom: {functions_per_carbon}\")\nprint(f\"Basis functions per Hydrogen atom: {functions_per_hydrogen}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"Total functions calculation:\")\nprint(f\"({num_carbon_atoms} C atoms * {functions_per_carbon} functions/C) + ({num_hydrogen_atoms} H atoms * {functions_per_hydrogen} functions/H)\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions_carbon} + {total_functions_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"= {total_functions}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(f\"Total contracted Gaussian functions = {total_functions}\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
