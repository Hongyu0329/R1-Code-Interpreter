    print("The core challenge with birth-death models on phylogenies of only living (extant) species is 'non-identifiability'.")

    print(" - Strategies involving fossils (D, F), Bayesian priors (B), or reparametrization (E, G) are all valid methods to mitigate the problem.")
    print("   They work by adding new data (fossils), adding external constraints (priors), or focusing on parameters that are identifiable (reparametrization).")

    print(" - A 'piecewise constant' model (A) is a simplification, but it doesn't solve the underlying identifiability issue.")
