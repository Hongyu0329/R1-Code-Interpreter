# The user wants to identify the specific chromosomal event based on experimental results.
# The thinking process is outlined above. This code block will simply format and print the final conclusion.

# Step 1: Analyze the resulting offspring.
# Offspring is a male with phenotype "red eyes, miniature wings". This means its single X chromosome carries these traits (X^Rm).
# Offspring karyotype is X0.
# So, the full genotype is X^Rm 0.

# Step 2: Determine the origin of the gametes.
# The fly is a result of fertilization between a gamete with X^Rm and a gamete with no sex chromosome (0).
# The key insight from Bridges' experiments is that non-disjunction in the female produces XX and 0 eggs.
# This means the 0 gamete was an egg from the female.
# The X^Rm gamete was a sperm from the father.

# Step 3: Identify the process causing the abnormal female gamete.
# The production of a 0 (nullo) egg is caused by non-disjunction of the X chromosomes in the female during meiosis.
# This event can happen in Meiosis I (homologous chromosomes fail to separate) or Meiosis II (sister chromatids fail to separate).

# Step 4: Evaluate the options.
# Both non-disjunction in female Meiosis I and Meiosis II can produce nullo-eggs.
# However, the failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in Meiosis I is the primary non-disjunction event. This single event in Meiosis I produces both types of abnormal gametes seen in Bridges' experiments: the XX egg (which can lead to an XXY female) and the 0 egg (which leads to the X0 male).
# Therefore, it is the most complete explanation for all of Bridges' exceptional offspring.

final_answer = "A"
# No calculation is needed, the answer is derived from biological principles.
# The following print statement is for demonstration purposes as requested by the prompt format,
# but the core task is a multiple-choice question.
