    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the system's quantum numbers:** A p-electron is defined by an orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$ and a spin quantum number $s=1/2$.\n2.  **Determine the total angular momentum:** The total angular momentum quantum number, $j$, results from the coupling of $l$ and $s$. Its possible values range from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$ in integer steps.\n3.  **Find the z-component of total angular momentum:** For each possible value of $j$, the magnetic quantum number, $m_j$, can take integer-stepped values from $-j$ to $+j$.\n4.  **Calculate the eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues for the operators are given by the standard formulas:\n    *   $J^2$ eigenvalue: $\\hbar^2 j(j+1)$\n    *   $J_z$ eigenvalue: $\\hbar m_j$\n5.  **Generate a Python script:** The script will perform these steps, calculating the possible values for $j$ and $m_j$, and then print out the corresponding eigenvalues for $J^2$ and $J_z$ for each state, showing the explicit calculation.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    The eigenvalues are the physical observables for a system in a state defined\n    by the quantum numbers j and m_j.\n    \"\"\"\n    # For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is 1.\n    l = 1\n    # For an electron, the spin quantum number is 1/2.\n    s = 0.5\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with l = {l} and s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"The total angular momentum is J = L + S.\")\n    print(\"We need to find the common eigenvalues of the operators J^2 and J_z.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # The rules of angular momentum addition (Clebsch-Gordan series) state that\n    # the total angular momentum quantum number j can take values from |l-s| to l+s.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {list(j_values)}\\n\")\n\n    # Iterate through each possible value of j to find the corresponding eigenvalues.\n    for j in j_values:\n        # The eigenvalue of the J^2 operator is j(j+1)hbar^2.\n        j_squared_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        \n        print(f\"--- For the state with j = {j} ---\")\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is given by j(j+1)ħ².\")\n        # We explicitly show the calculation for clarity.\n        print(f\"  Eigenvalue of J^2 = {j} * ({j} + 1) * ħ² = {j_squared_eigenvalue:.2f} * ħ²\")\n\n        # For a given j, the magnetic quantum number m_j can take values from -j to +j.\n        mj_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n        \n        print(f\"The possible values for the magnetic quantum number m_j are: {list(mj_values)}\")\n        print(\"The corresponding J_z eigenvalues (m_j * ħ) for each common eigenstate |j, m_j> are:\")\n\n        # For each state |j, m_j>, there is a specific eigenvalue for J_z.\n        for mj in mj_values:\n            # The eigenvalue of the J_z operator is m_j * hbar.\n            print(f\"  For state |j={j}, m_j={mj:+.1f}>, the eigenvalue of J_z is {mj:+.1f} * ħ\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * 60)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```"
