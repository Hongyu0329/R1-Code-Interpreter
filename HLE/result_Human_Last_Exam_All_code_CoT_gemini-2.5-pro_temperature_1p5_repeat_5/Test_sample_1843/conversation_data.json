    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order 6, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Factorize the conductor N**: The structure of the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $N$ depends on the prime factorization of $N$.\n2.  **Use the character decomposition theorem**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{a_1} \\cdots p_r^{a_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{a_i}$. The conductor of $\\chi$ is $N$, and its order is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$.\n3.  **Find properties of component characters**: We need to find tuples of primitive characters $(\\chi_4, \\chi_9, \\chi_7, \\chi_{11}, \\chi_{13})$ such that the lcm of their orders is 6. This implies two conditions:\n    a) The order of each component character must divide 6.\n    b) The lcm of their orders must be exactly 6.\n4.  **Count the number of choices for each component**: For each factor $p^k$ of $N$, we will count how many primitive characters modulo $p^k$ have an order that divides 6.\n5.  **Calculate the total and verify the final order**: We multiply the counts from the previous step to get the total number of character tuples where each component's order divides 6. Then, we verify that for any such tuple, the resulting character's order is guaranteed to be exactly 6.\n\n### Step-by-step Execution:\n\n1.  **Factorize N**:\n    $N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (4 \\times 9) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13) = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n    The component moduli are $4, 9, 7, 11, 13$.\n\n2.  **Analyze component characters' orders**:\n    For a character $\\chi = \\chi_4 \\chi_9 \\chi_7 \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$ to be primitive with conductor $N$, each component $\\chi_{p^k}$ must be primitive for its respective modulus. We need to find the number of such characters where $\\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$. This means the order of each component must divide 6.\n\n3.  **Count choices for each modulus**:\n    We need Euler's totient function, $\\phi(n)$, to count characters of a specific order.\n    *   **Modulo 4**: There is only one primitive character modulo 4. Its order is 2. Since 2 divides 6, this is a valid choice.\n        *   Number of choices: 1.\n    *   **Modulo 9**: The primitive characters modulo 9 have orders 3 and 6. Both orders divide 6. The number of primitive characters of order $k$ is $\\phi(k)$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        *   Total choices: $2 + 2 = 4$.\n    *   **Modulo 7**: The primitive characters modulo 7 (all non-principal characters) can have orders 2, 3, or 6. All these orders divide 6.\n        *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        *   Total choices: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    *   **Modulo 11**: The primitive characters modulo 11 can have orders 2, 5, or 10. Only order 2 divides 6.\n        *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   Total choices: 1.\n    *   **Modulo 13**: The primitive characters modulo 13 can have orders 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12. The orders that divide 6 are 2, 3, and 6.\n        *   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n        *   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = 2$.\n        *   Total choices: $1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Total and Verify Order**:\n    The total number of ways to choose a tuple of such characters is the product of the number of choices for each component:\n    Total combinations = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n    Now, we must confirm that the order of the resulting character is exactly 6. Let the order be $k = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_4), \\text{ord}(\\chi_9), \\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}))$.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_4$ must be 2. Thus, $k$ is a multiple of 2.\n    *   The order of $\\chi_9$ must be 3 or 6, so it's a multiple of 3. Thus, $k$ is a multiple of 3.\n    *   Therefore, $k$ must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2, 3) = 6$.\n    *   Since we've already restricted the component orders to be divisors of 6, their lcm cannot exceed 6.\n    *   So, $k$ must be exactly 6.\n\nThis means the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor 36036 and order 6 is exactly the total number of combinations we calculated.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef count_primitive_chars_by_order(modulus, required_order_lcm):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of primitive characters for a given modulus whose orders\n    divide required_order_lcm.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Orders of primitive characters for the given moduli\n    # whose orders divide 6\n    \n    count = 0\n    if modulus == 4:\n        # One primitive char of order 2. 2 divides 6.\n        count = 1\n    elif modulus == 9:\n        # Primitive chars have orders 3 and 6.
