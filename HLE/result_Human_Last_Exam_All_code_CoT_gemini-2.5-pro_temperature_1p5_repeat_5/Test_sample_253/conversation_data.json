    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand Rule 110:** Rule 110 is a one-dimensional cellular automaton where the state of a cell (either 0 or 1) in the next generation is determined by its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule is defined by the following mapping for each 3-cell neighborhood pattern:\n    *   `111` -> `0`\n    *   `110` -> `1`\n    *   `101` -> `1`\n    *   `100` -> `0`\n    *   `011` -> `1`\n    *   `010` -> `1`\n    *   `001` -> `1`\n    *   `000` -> `0`\n\n2.  **Set Up the Simulation:**\n    *   We will start with an initial state of a single cell in state 1, surrounded by cells in state 0.\n    *   To accommodate the pattern's growth, we'll use a one-dimensional grid (a list in Python) that is wide enough.\n    *   We will simulate the automaton for 20 steps (generations).\n\n3.  **Execute the Simulation:**\n    *   Initialize a list of cells with all `0`s and a single `1` in the center.\n    *   Loop 20 times. In each iteration:\n        *   Create a new, empty list for the next generation.\n        *   Iterate through each cell of the current grid. For each cell, examine its 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right).\n        *   Apply Rule 110 to this neighborhood to determine the cell's state in the next generation.\n        *   Store this new state in the new list.\n        *   After calculating all the new states, replace the old grid with the new one.\n\n4.  **Final Output:**\n    *   After 20 generations, the simulation is complete. The resulting list of `0`s and `1`s is the final pattern.\n    *   The script will print this final binary pattern, trimming any excess leading or trailing zeros.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the simulation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates the cellular automaton Rule 110 for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' cell and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the simulation\n    generations = 20\n    # Use a width that is large enough to contain the pattern's growth\n    # A safe width is 2 * generations + some padding\n    width = 2 * generations + 21\n\n    # Define Rule 110. The key is the 3-cell neighborhood (left, center, right)\n    # and the value is the next state of the center cell.\n    # The rule is derived from the binary representation of 110, which is 01101110.\n    rules = {\n        '111': '0', '110': '1', '101': '1', '100': '0',\n        '011': '1', '010': '1', '001': '1', '000': '0'\n    }\n\n    # Initialize the grid: a list of '0's with a single '1' in the center.\n    # We use strings for easier concatenation later.\n    cells = ['0'] * width\n    cells[width // 2] = '1'\n\n    # Run the simulation for the specified number of generations\n    for _ in range(generations):\n        # Create a new list to store the next generation's states\n        next_gen = ['0'] * width\n        \n        # Iterate through the interior cells to calculate their next state\n        # The boundary cells are assumed to be surrounded by '0's, so their\n        # next state will correctly remain '0' as long as the pattern doesn't\n        # reach the edge of our wide grid.\n        for i in range(1, width - 1):\n            # Get the neighborhood as a string key\n            neighborhood = \"\".join(cells[i-1:i+2])\n            # Apply the rule to determine the next state\n            next_gen[i] = rules[neighborhood]\n        \n        # Update the current generation to the newly computed one\n        cells = next_gen\n\n    # Convert the final list of cells to a single string\n    final_state_str = \"\".join(cells)\n\n    # Trim leading and trailing zeros to get the core pattern\n    first_one = final_state_str.find('1')\n    last_one = final_state_str.rfind('1')\n    \n    if first_one != -1:\n        final_pattern = final_state_str[first_one:last_one+1]\n    else:\n        # Handle the case where the pattern is all zeros\n        final_pattern = \"0\"\n        \n    # Print the final resulting pattern.
