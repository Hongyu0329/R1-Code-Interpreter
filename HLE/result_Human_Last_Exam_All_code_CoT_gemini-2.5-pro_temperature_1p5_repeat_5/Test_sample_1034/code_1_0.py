# Step 1: Interpret the value of S from the string "SNYWR".
# We assume S is the length of the string.
s_string = "SNYWR"
S = len(s_string)

# Step 2: Define the geometric conditions.
# In triangle ABC, side BC = S and angle B = 30 degrees.
# The condition for two possible triangles (and thus two values for side AB)
# is when the length of side AC is strictly between BC*sin(B) and BC.
# So, BC * sin(B) < AC < BC

# Step 3: Substitute the known values into the inequality.
# S = 5
# B = 30 degrees, so sin(B) = 0.5
lower_bound = S * 0.5
upper_bound = S

# Step 4: Find the integer values for AC that satisfy the inequality.
# We are looking for integers between lower_bound and upper_bound.
# The first integer greater than the lower bound is math.floor(lower_bound) + 1.
start_integer = math.floor(lower_bound) + 1

# The last integer less than the upper bound is upper_bound - 1 (since S is an integer).
end_integer = upper_bound - 1

# Generate the list of possible integer values for AC
possible_ac_values = list(range(start_integer, end_integer + 1))
count = len(possible_ac_values)

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the final answer.
# The prompt requests that we output each number in the final equation.
