    Analyzes the assumptions and determines the necessary ones.

    The question asks for the necessary assumptions to prove that the expected
    information gain for a Bayesian agent approaches zero with probability 1.

    The expected information gain at time t+1 is given by:
    I_t = E[KL(p_{t+1} || p_t)]

    A key result in Bayesian learning theory is that the sum of all expected
    information gains is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution, H(p_0).
    Sum_{t=0 to infinity} E[I_t] <= H(p_0)

    For this infinite sum of non-negative terms (KL divergence is non-negative)
    to be finite, the right-hand side, H(p_0), must be finite. This is exactly
    assumption (a).

    If the sum of expectations is finite, it implies that the random variable
    (the sum itself) is finite with probability 1. For an infinite sum of
    non-negative random variables to be finite, the terms must approach zero.
    Therefore, I_t -> 0 with probability 1.

    This entire argument hinges on the prior having finite entropy.

    Let's check the other options:
    - (b), (c): These are strong assumptions about the environment or agent policy.
      The information-theoretic result is more general. Beliefs can stop updating
      (information gain becomes zero) even if the policy is not stable or the
      environment is not an MDP.
    - (d): i.i.d. is not required. The proof holds for dependent observations,
      as is typical in agent-environment interaction.
    - (e): Posterior entropy approaching zero is a stronger conclusion than the
      information gain approaching zero. It is a result to be proven, not an assumption.

    Thus, the only necessary assumption from the list is (a).
