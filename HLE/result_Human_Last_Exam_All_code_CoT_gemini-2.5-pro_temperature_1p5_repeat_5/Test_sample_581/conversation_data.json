    "The problem of determining the maximum size of a cap set is a major open problem in combinatorial geometry and additive combinatorics. A cap set in the affine space $AG(n, 3)$ is a collection of points where no three points lie on a line. The size of the largest possible cap set is denoted by $r_3(n)$.\n\nFinding the exact value of $r_3(n)$ is computationally very difficult for larger $n$. Therefore, mathematicians work on finding upper and lower bounds. The best-known lower bounds are typically established by discovering specific constructions of large cap sets.\n\nFor dimension $n=8$, the best-known lower bound comes from a construction published by Olof Heden in 2003. This result is a specific, published value rather than one derived from a simple, general formula.\n\nThe following Python code stores the best-known lower bounds for small dimensions and retrieves the value for dimension 8.\n\n```python\ndef get_cap_set_lower_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function stores and retrieves the best-known lower bounds for the\n    size of cap sets in AG(n, 3) for small dimensions. These values are\n    based on published mathematical research.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Source for these values is primarily the survey by Yves Edel (2004)\n    # and subsequent results like the one by Olof Heden (2003) for n=8.\n    known_lower_bounds = {\n        1: 2,\n        2: 4,\n        3: 9,\n        4: 20,\n        5: 45,\n        6: 112,\n        7: 314, # This bound comes from a recursive construction\n        8: 496  # This bound comes from a specific construction by O. Heden\n    }\n\n    dimension = 8\n    if dimension in known_lower_bounds:\n        lower_bound = known_lower_bounds[dimension]\n        print(f\"The best known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension n={dimension} is a specific research result.\")\n        print(f\"Dimension (n): {dimension}\")\n        print(f\"Best Known Lower Bound: {lower_bound}\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"The best known lower bound for dimension {dimension} is not in our data.\")\n\nget_cap_set_lower_bound()\n```\n<<<F>>>"
