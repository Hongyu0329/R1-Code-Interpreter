The key to this question is understanding the repair method: "manual TIG welding (GTAW) build-up of layers of filler material." This is a process designed to add material back to a part where it has been lost, in order to restore its original shape and dimensions ("geometrical integrity").

Let's evaluate the options based on this method:
- Cracking (A, E) and Creep Deformation (D) are not primarily addressed by building up layers. They are issues of material fracture and bulk deformation, respectively.
- Foreign Object Damage (B), Tip Rub (C), and Corrosion (F) all involve material loss and can be repaired by welding.
- However, 'Blade Tip Rub and Wear' (C) is the most specific and common cause for a 'build-up' repair. The tips of turbine blades wear down from rubbing against the engine casing. This material loss must be built back up layer by layer to restore the precise tip clearance, which is critical for engine efficiency. This process perfectly matches the description in the question, making it the main type of damage addressed by this repair technique.
