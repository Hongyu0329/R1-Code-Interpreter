    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Shape:** The \"outer-hull of the great icosahedron\" refers to its convex hull. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, but its vertices are arranged in the same way as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. Therefore, its convex hull is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze Triangulation:** The task asks for the number of triangles needed to triangulate this outer-hull. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed of 20 equilateral triangles.\n3.  **Count the Triangles:** Since the surface is already perfectly tiled with triangles, no further subdivision (triangulation) is needed. The minimal number of triangles is simply the number of faces on a regular icosahedron.\n4.  **Provide the Code:** I will write a simple Python script that stores the number of faces of an icosahedron in a variable and then prints this number.\n\n```python\n# A regular icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 faces.\n# The faces are equilateral triangles.\n# The convex hull (outer-hull) of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n# The task asks for the minimal number of triangles to triangulate this surface.\n# Since the surface is already made of triangles, the number is simply the number of faces.\n\nnumber_of_faces_on_icosahedron = 20\n\nprint(f\"The outer-hull of the great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\")\nprint(f\"A regular icosahedron's surface is already composed of triangles.\")\nprint(f\"The number of triangular faces on a regular icosahedron is: {number_of_faces_on_icosahedron}\")\n```\n<<<20>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
