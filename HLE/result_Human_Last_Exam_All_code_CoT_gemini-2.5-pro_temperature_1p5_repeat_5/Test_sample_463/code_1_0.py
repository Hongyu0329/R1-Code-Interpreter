def find_photochemical_synthesis_taxa():
    """
    This function identifies and prints the indices of taxa that undergo photochemical synthesis.
    The analysis is as follows:
    - 2 (Gloeochaete wittrockiana): Algae, performs photosynthesis.
    - 5 (Halapricum salinum): Archaea, performs phototrophy using bacteriorhodopsin.
    - 6 (Aphanothece castagnei): Cyanobacteria, performs oxygenic photosynthesis.
    - 7 (Baileya pleniradiata): Plant, performs photosynthesis.
    - 9 (Ectothiorhodosinus mongolicus): Purple sulfur bacteria, performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    - 10 (Chlorobaculum tepidum): Green sulfur bacteria, performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    - 12 (Gemmatimonas phototrophica): Bacterium, performs anoxygenic photosynthesis.
    Other taxa are animals or non-phototrophic microbes.
