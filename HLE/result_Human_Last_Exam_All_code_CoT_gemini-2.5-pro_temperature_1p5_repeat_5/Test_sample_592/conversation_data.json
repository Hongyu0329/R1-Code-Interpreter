    "Here is a plan to answer your question.\n1.  First, I will research the plot of the 1997 movie \"Ovosodo\".\n2.  Next, I will specifically look for details about the character Tommaso and his travels.\n3.  Finally, I will write a simple Python script to store the name of the US city he moves to in a variable and then print it as the answer.\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know which US city the character Tommaso moves to in the movie \"Ovosodo\".\n# Based on a plot summary of the film, Tommaso, the main character's best friend,\n# leaves Italy to study music in the United States.\n\n# The specific city he moves to is Philadelphia.\ncity = \"Philadelphia\"\n\n# The following code will print the answer.\nprint(f\"In the movie 'Ovosodo', the character Tommaso moves to {city}.\")\n```\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
