  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+4.\n\nYou've got the sum that was written on the board.

    "My plan to solve this is as follows:\n\nFirst, I will address the main task of rearranging the sum. I will write a Python script for this.\n1.  The input is a string representing a mathematical sum, like \"3+2+1\".\n2.  The numbers in the sum are always 1, 2, 3, or 4. They are separated by '+' signs.\n3.  I will first extract the numbers from the input string. This can be easily done by splitting the string by the '+' delimiter.\n4.  This will give me a list of number strings (e.g., `['3', '2', '1']`).\n5.  The problem requires the numbers to be sorted in non-decreasing order. I will sort this list.\n6.  Finally, I will join the sorted numbers back together with '+' signs in between to form the new sum string (e.g., \"1+2+3\") and print it.\n\nSecond, I will address the side-quest about the memory-efficient C program.\n1.  To create the most memory-efficient C program, the key is to avoid storing the entire input string in memory, as it can be up to 1000 characters long. The program can read and process the input character by character.\n2.  Since we only have numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, we can use an array to count the occurrences of each number. This is essentially a counting sort.\n3.  I will calculate the minimum memory required for the variables. I'll choose the smallest possible standard data types for each variable.\n    *   **Counters**: The input string has a max length of 1000. This means there can be at most `(1000+1)/2 = 501` numbers. The count for any single digit cannot exceed this. A `short int` (typically 2 bytes, max value 32,767) is sufficient to store these counts. We need 4 such counters. Total: `4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n    *   **Character Input**: Reading character by character with `getchar()` requires an `int` variable to be able to store the special `EOF` value. An `int` is typically 4 bytes. Total: `4` bytes.\n    *   **Other Variables**: For printing the output, we need a loop counter to go through our 4 counters (a `char` is enough, 1 byte), a flag to correctly place the '+' signs (a `char` is enough, 1 byte), and another counter for the inner loop that prints a number `count` times (a `short` is needed as the count can be up to 501, 2 bytes). Total: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` bytes.\n4.  Summing these up gives the total memory used by variables: `8 (counters) + 4 (input char) + 4 (other vars) = 16` bytes.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to solve the primary task.\n\n```python\n# Read the input sum from the user\ninput_sum = input()\n\n# The numbers are separated by '+', so we split the string by '+' to get a list of numbers\nsummands = input_sum.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers in non-decreasing order\nsummands.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted numbers back into a string with '+' as the separator\nsorted_sum = '+'.join(summands)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum\nprint(sorted_sum)\n```\n<<<16>>>"
