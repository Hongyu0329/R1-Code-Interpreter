    "Of course. Scanning Latin hexameter involves breaking the line into syllables, determining whether each syllable is long or short, and then grouping them into metrical feet. Here is my step-by-step analysis followed by the Python code to present the result.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Elision**: I will first break the line into syllables, accounting for elisions. An elision occurs when a word ending in a vowel (or '-m') is followed by a word beginning with a vowel (or 'h').\n    *   `verum ubi` -> `ver' ubi`\n    *   `equi atque` -> `equ' atque`\n    *   `atque hominis` -> `atqu' hominis`\n\n2.  **Syllable Quantity**: I will determine if each syllable is long or short based on these rules:\n    *   A syllable is **long by nature** if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong.\n    *   A syllable is **long by position** if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (or 'x' or 'z').\n    *   Otherwise, a syllable is **short**.\n\n3.  **Poetic License**: Virgil sometimes uses poetic license. For this line, two are relevant:\n    *   **Ictus Lengthening**: The short 'e' in `equi` is lengthened by the metrical stress (ictus).\n    *   **Synaloepha**: A rare elision occurs between `convenit` and `imago`, where the final `-it` merges with the initial `i-`.\n\n4.  **Grouping into Feet**: I will group the long (—) and short (U) syllables into six feet.\n    *   **Dactyl (D)**: One long followed by two short syllables (— U U).\n    *   **Spondee (S)**: Two long syllables (— —).\n\n### Analysis Breakdown\n\n*   **Foot 1: `verum ubi`**: Becomes `vēr' ubi`. `vē-` is long by nature, `u` is short, `bi` is short. This forms a **Dactyl (— U U)**.\n*   **Foot 2: `equi atque`**: The 'e' in `equi` is treated as long due to ictus. The 'i' elides. The `at-` in `atque` is long by position (followed by 'tq'). This forms a **Spondee (— —)**.\n*   **Foot 3: `hominis`**: The `-que` from `atque` elides. The word `hominis` is syllabified as `hom-nis` because the consonants carry over to the next syllable for scansion. `hom-` is long by position (followed by 'mn'), and `-in-` (from `-inis`) is long by position (followed by 'sc' from `casu`). This forms a **Spondee (— —)**.\n*   **Foot 4: `casu`**: The syllables `hominis` are used up. The next two syllables are `cā` and `sū`. In the ablative `cāsū`, both vowels are long by nature. This forms a **Spondee (— —)**.\n*   **Foot 5: `convenit i...`**: Due to synaloepha, this is scanned as `convenit'imago`. The foot is `cōn-ve-nit`. `cōn-` is long by position ('nv'), `ve` is short, and `nit` is short. This forms a **Dactyl (— U U)**.\n*   **Foot 6: `...mago`**: The remaining part is `-māgō`. Both `ā` and `ō` are long by nature. This forms a **Spondee (— —)**.\n\nThis detailed analysis yields the pattern D S S S D S.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and displays the scansion of a given Latin hexameter line.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n\n    # The line is segmented into feet based on a detailed metrical analysis.\n    # This analysis accounts for elisions, poetic licenses like ictus lengthening,\n    # and vowel quantities (by nature or position).\n    feet_words = {\n        1: \"verum ubi\",\n        2: \"equi atque\",\n        3: \"hominis\",\n        4: \"casu\",\n        5: \"convenit i-\",\n        6: \"-mago\"\n    }\n\n    # The scansion pattern determined from the analysis.\n    # D = Dactyl (— U U), S = Spondee (— —)\n    feet_scansion = {\n        1: \"D\",\n        2: \"S\",\n        3: \"S\",\n        4: \"S\",\n        5: \"D\",\n        6: \"S\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Original Line: \\\"{line}\\\"\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Metrical Scansion:\")\n\n    final_pattern = []\n    for i in range(1, 7):\n        word_part = feet_words[i]\n        scan_part = feet_scansion[i]\n        foot_type = \"Dactyl\" if scan_part == \"D\" else \"Spondee\"\n        print(f\"Foot {i}: {word_part:<14} -> {scan_part} ({foot_type})\")\n        final_pattern.append(scan_part)\n\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(\"Final Pattern: \" + \" \".join(final_pattern))\n\n# Execute the function to print the analysis.\nscan_hexameter_line()\n```\n<<<D S S S D S>>>"
