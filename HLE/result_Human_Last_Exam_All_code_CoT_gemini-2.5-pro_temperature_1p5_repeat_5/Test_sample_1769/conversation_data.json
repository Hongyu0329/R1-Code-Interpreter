    "This is a fascinating question of alternate linguistic history. To determine the Modern English word for \"sister\" without Norse influence, we must find the original Old English word and trace its hypothetical evolution through documented sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English.\n\n**My Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Source Word:** The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir\". I will first identify the native Old English word it replaced.\n2.  **Analyze Sound Changes:** I will look at how similar Old English words evolved into Modern English. Specifically, I'll examine how vowel sounds shifted and how unstressed syllables were altered, using words like \"brōþor\" (brother) and \"mōdor\" (mother) as models.\n3.  **Construct the Hypothetical Word:** I will apply these established sound change rules step-by-step to the Old English word to project what its modern form would be.\n4.  **Generate a Python Script:** The script will print this step-by-step explanation, showing the transformation from the Old English word to the final hypothetical Modern English word, and present the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains the hypothetical evolution of the English word for \"sister\"\n    without the influence of Old Norse.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The original Old English word for \"sister\"\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    \n    # The intermediate form after the first major sound change\n    intermediate_word = \"swestor\"\n\n    # The final hypothetical Modern English word\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n\n    print(\"The modern word 'sister' is an import from the Old Norse word 'systir'.\")\n    print(\"This Norse word replaced the original native Old English term.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(f\"The native Old English word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\")\n    print(\"If it had evolved naturally into Modern English, it would have followed sound changes similar to other native words.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    print(\"Here is the likely evolutionary path:\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the smoothing of the 'eo' diphthong\n    print(f\"1. The Old English 'eo' sound in '{old_english_word}' would have simplified to 'e', creating '{intermediate_word}'.\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Explain the change in the unstressed final syllable\n    print(f\"2. The unstressed '-or' ending would have changed to '-er', much like 'mōdor' became 'mother' and 'brōþor' became 'brother'.\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    # Final \"equation\" showing the transformation\n    print(\"This gives us the final equation of its evolution:\")\n    print(f\"'{old_english_word}' -> '{intermediate_word}' -> '{hypothetical_modern_word}'\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    print(f\"Thus, without the Norse influence, the Modern English word for 'sister' would most likely be '{hypothetical_modern_word}'.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<swester>>>\n```"
