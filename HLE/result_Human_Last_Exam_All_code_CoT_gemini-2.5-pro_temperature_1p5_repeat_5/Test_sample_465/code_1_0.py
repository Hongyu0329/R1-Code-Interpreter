def solve_chromatic_roots_quiz():
    """
    This function solves the multiple-choice question about chromatic and orbital chromatic roots.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A. True. A known theorem states that the largest real orbital chromatic root is bounded by the largest real chromatic root.
    B. True. The chromatic polynomial of a 4-cycle (C4) has complex roots.
    C. True. Counterexamples exist, proving that real chromatic roots can be negative.
    D. True. Many graphs are known to have non-integer real chromatic roots.
    E. False. A well-known theorem states that chromatic polynomials have no roots in the interval (0, 1).

    The set of true statements is {A, B, C, D}.
    The final answer is the sorted string of these letters.
