    "This problem asks for the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables over the finite ring R = Z/8Z. I will solve this computationally.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  A quadratic form in two variables over Z/8Z is a polynomial `Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2`, where the coefficients `a, b, c` are elements of Z/8Z = {0, 1, ..., 7}. Each form can be uniquely represented by a tuple `(a, b, c)`. The total number of such forms is 8x8x8 = 512.\n2.  Two quadratic forms, `Q1` and `Q2`, are defined as equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by an invertible linear change of variables. This transformation is represented by a 2x2 matrix `P` with entries in Z/8Z whose determinant is a unit (i.e., one of {1, 3, 5, 7}). The set of all such matrices forms the general linear group GL(2, Z/8Z). If `Q2(v) = Q1(P(v))` for some invertible `P`, they are in the same equivalence class.\n3.  My approach is to implement a program that partitions the entire set of 512 forms into these equivalence classes (orbits) and then counts the number of classes.\n    *   First, I will generate the group of all invertible matrices, GL(2, Z/8Z).\n    *   Then, I will iterate through all 512 possible forms.\n    *   For each form, I'll check if it belongs to a class that has already been found. If not, I'll count it as a new class and then compute its full orbit by applying every transformation matrix in GL(2, Z/8Z). All forms in this orbit will then be marked as \"found\".\n    *   The total number of new classes found will be the answer.\n\nTo fulfill the request of showing the final \"equation,\" I will also calculate the size of each equivalence class (orbit). The sum of the sizes of all orbits must equal the total number of forms (512). I will print this sum.\n\n```python\nimport math\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_quadratic_forms_classification():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two variables\n    over the ring R=Z/8Z and displays the method and results.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 8\n\n    # Generate the group of invertible 2x2 matrices over Z/N\n    units = {x for x in range(N) if math.gcd(x, N) == 1}\n    gl2_zn = []\n    for p11 in range(N):\n        for p12 in range(N):\n            for p21 in range(N):\n                for p22 in range(N):\n                    det = (p11 * p22 - p12 * p21) % N\n                    if det in units:\n                        gl2_zn.append([[p11, p12], [p21, p22]])\n\n    # Generate all possible quadratic forms (a,b,c)\n    all_forms = set(itertools.product(range(N), repeat=3))\n    remaining_forms = set(all_forms)\n\n    def transform_form(q, P):\n        \"\"\"Applies a linear transform P to a quadratic form q.\"\"\"\n        a, b, c = q\n        p11, p12 = P[0]\n        p21, p22 = P[1]\n        \n        # The new form Q'(x,y) = Q(p11*x + p12*y, p21*x + p22*y).\n        # Expanding this expression gives the new coefficients a', b', c'.\n        a_prime = (a * p11**2 + b * p11 * p21 + c * p21**2) % N\n        b_prime = (2 * a * p11 * p12 + b * (p11 * p22 + p12 * p21) + 2 * c * p21 * p22) % N\n        c_prime = (a * p12**2 + b * p12 * p22 + c * p22**2) % N\n        \n        return (a_prime, b_prime, c_prime)\n\n    # Partition the set of forms into orbits and find the size of each orbit\n    orbit_sizes = []\n    while remaining_forms:\n        # Pick a canonical representative from the remaining forms\n        q_rep = min(remaining_forms)\n        \n        # Compute the orbit of this representative\n        orbit = {transform_form(q_rep, p_matrix) for p_matrix in gl2_zn}\n        \n        orbit_sizes.append(len(orbit))\n        \n        # Remove the entire orbit from the set of remaining forms\n        remaining_forms -= orbit\n\n    # Sort sizes for a clean presentation\n    orbit_sizes.sort()\n    \n    print(f\"Total number of quadratic forms ax^2+bxy+cy^2 over Z/8Z is 8*8*8 = {len(all_forms)}.\")\n    print(f\"The group of invertible linear transforms GL(2, Z/8Z) has {len(gl2_zn)} elements.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe 512 forms are partitioned into disjoint equivalence classes (orbits).\")\n    print(\"The sum of the sizes of these orbits is:\")\n    \n    # We will print the equation with a limit on line width for readability\n    line = \"\"\n    for size in orbit_sizes:\n        if len(line) + len(str(size)) + 3 > 80:\n            print(line + \" +\")\n            line = \"\"\n        if line:\n            line += \" + \"\n        line += str(size)\n    print(line + f\" = {sum(orbit_sizes)}\")\n    \n    num_classes = len(orbit_sizes)\n    print(f\"\\nThe number of terms in the sum corresponds to the number of equivalence classes.\")\n    print(f\"Number of equivalence classes = {num_classes}\")\n\nsolve_quadratic_forms_classification()\n<<<26>>>"
