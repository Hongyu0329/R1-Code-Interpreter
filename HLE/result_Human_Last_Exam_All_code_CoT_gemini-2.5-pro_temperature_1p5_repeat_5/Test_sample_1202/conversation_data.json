    "This is a multiple-choice question from biology. My plan is to first understand the biological concepts behind the question and then write a Python script that explains the reasoning for the correct answer and prints the final choice.\n\n**Step-by-step thinking:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks for the mechanism that best explains how duplicate genes are both **retained** (not lost) and **diverge** (become different) in a genome.\n2.  **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process makes homologous sequences more similar to each other. It works *against* divergence. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where a duplicate gene becomes non-functional due to mutation. This is a common fate, but it represents the *loss* of a functional gene, not its retention. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one copy of the gene retains its original function, while the other copy accumulates mutations and evolves a completely new function. This explains both retention (the new function is beneficial) and divergence. This is a plausible answer.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions or expression patterns. After duplication, each copy loses some of these functions through mutation, but in a complementary way. For example, copy 1 loses function B, and copy 2 loses function A. Now, both copies are needed to perform the original set of functions. This explains retention (both are required) and divergence (they specialize). This is also a plausible answer.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a macro-evolutionary process where a species rapidly diversifies into many new ones. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material for this to happen, it is not the *molecular mechanism* of gene retention itself. It's a different level of explanation. So, this is incorrect.\n3.  **Compare plausible options (C and D):** Both Neofunctionalization and Subfunctionalization are accepted models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes. However, subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely or more common initial outcome. It relies on the accumulation of more common degenerative mutations that partition the original function, providing a passive route for preserving both copies. Neofunctionalization requires a rarer event: a mutation that confers a new, beneficial function. Therefore, Subfunctionalization is arguably the \"most likely\" mechanism for the initial retention phase.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python code:** I will write a script that defines the options, provides a detailed explanation for why 'D' is the best answer, and then prints the final result in the specified format.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_biology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes a multiple-choice question about gene duplication\n    and explains the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes in eukaryotic genomes?\"\n\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    correct_answer_key = 'D'\n    correct_answer_text = options[correct_answer_key]\n\n    explanation = f\"\"\"\n    1.  **Understanding the Problem:** After a gene is duplicated, the new copy is redundant. Without selective pressure, this new copy is likely to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional 'pseudogene' (Option B). The question asks for a mechanism that prevents this loss (retention) and allows the two copies to become different (divergence).\n\n    2.  **Analyzing the Options:**\n        *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process homogenizes genes, making them more similar. This is the opposite of divergence.\n        *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the *loss* of a functional gene, not its retention.\n        *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern, not a specific molecular mechanism for gene retention.\n        *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This is a valid model where one copy gains a new function. It explains retention and divergence.\n        *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This is also a valid model where the original gene's functions are partitioned between the two new copies. If the ancestral gene had two functions, (f1, f2), one duplicate might specialize in f1 and the other in f2. Both are now required, ensuring retention and allowing divergence.\n\n    3.  **Conclusion:** Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are major mechanisms for the retention of duplicate genes. However, Subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely and common initial fate. This is because it can result from more common, partially disabling mutations, whereas neofunctionalization requires a rarer mutation that creates a new, advantageous function. By partitioning the ancestral functions, subfunctionalization provides a 'safe harbor' from pseudogenization, preserving both copies and allowing them to diverge. Therefore, it is arguably the 'most likely' mechanism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(f\"Question: {question}\\n\")\n    print(\"Answer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Explanation ---\")\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\n    print(f\"The most likely mechanism is {correct_answer_key}: {correct_answer_text}\")\n\nsolve_biology_question()\n\nprint(\"<<<D>>>\")\n```"
