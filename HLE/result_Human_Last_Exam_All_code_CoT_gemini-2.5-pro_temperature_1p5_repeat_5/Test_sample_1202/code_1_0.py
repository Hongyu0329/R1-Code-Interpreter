    1.  **Understanding the Problem:** After a gene is duplicated, the new copy is redundant. Without selective pressure, this new copy is likely to accumulate disabling mutations and become a non-functional 'pseudogene' (Option B). The question asks for a mechanism that prevents this loss (retention) and allows the two copies to become different (divergence).

    2.  **Analyzing the Options:**
        *   **A. Gene conversion:** This process homogenizes genes, making them more similar. This is the opposite of divergence.
        *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the *loss* of a functional gene, not its retention.
        *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern, not a specific molecular mechanism for gene retention.
        *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** This is a valid model where one copy gains a new function. It explains retention and divergence.
        *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This is also a valid model where the original gene's functions are partitioned between the two new copies. If the ancestral gene had two functions, (f1, f2), one duplicate might specialize in f1 and the other in f2. Both are now required, ensuring retention and allowing divergence.

    3.  **Conclusion:** Both Neofunctionalization (C) and Subfunctionalization (D) are major mechanisms for the retention of duplicate genes. However, Subfunctionalization is often considered a more likely and common initial fate. This is because it can result from more common, partially disabling mutations, whereas neofunctionalization requires a rarer mutation that creates a new, advantageous function. By partitioning the ancestral functions, subfunctionalization provides a 'safe harbor' from pseudogenization, preserving both copies and allowing them to diverge. Therefore, it is arguably the 'most likely' mechanism.
