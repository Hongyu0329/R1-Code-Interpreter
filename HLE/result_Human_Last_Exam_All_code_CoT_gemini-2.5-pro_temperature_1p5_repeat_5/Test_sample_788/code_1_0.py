def calculate_equivalence_classes():
    """
    Calculates the number of equivalence classes for the peg game.

    The method uses linear algebra over F_2. The state of the game is described
    by the parity of the number of pegs on each of 9 color classes. The grid
    is colored by (x mod 3, y mod 3).

    A move (forward or backward) changes the parity vector by adding one of a
    set of generator vectors. The number of equivalence classes is the size of
    the quotient space of the state space (F_2)^9 by the subspace W spanned
    by these generators. The size is 2^(dim(V) - dim(W)).
    """

    # The state space V is (F_2)^9, one dimension for each color (i, j) where
    # i, j are in {0, 1, 2}.
    # We map color (i, j) to index 3*i + j.
    dim_V = 9

    # The generators of the subspace W correspond to moves.
    # A horizontal move changes pegs in a single row of the 3x3 color grid.
    # The sum of parities for that row changes.
    # r_i corresponds to a horizontal move in rows with y mod 3 = i.
    # k_j corresponds to a vertical move in columns with x mod 3 = j.
    # All such move vectors in F_2 are sums of the parities of the 3 colors involved.
    
    # Example: A horizontal move from (x,y), (x+1,y) to (x+2,y) where
    # x mod 3 = 0. The colors are (0, y mod 3), (1, y mod 3), (2, y mod 3).
    # The change in the parity vector is e_0 + e_1 + e_2 for that color row.
