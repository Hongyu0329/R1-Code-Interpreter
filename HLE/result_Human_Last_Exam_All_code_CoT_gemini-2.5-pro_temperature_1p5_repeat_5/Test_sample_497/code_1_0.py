    This function solves for the capacitor value x in terms of c for the given ladder circuit problem.

    The problem requires the equivalent capacitance to be independent of the number of cells, N.
    This is achieved when the terminating capacitance, x, is equal to the characteristic
    capacitance of the infinite ladder network.

    This condition leads to the quadratic equation for x in terms of c:
    2*x**2 + 2*c*x - c**2 = 0

    To find a general solution independent of the specific value of c, we can solve for the ratio r = x/c.
    Dividing the equation by c**2 gives:
    2*(x/c)**2 + 2*(x/c) - 1 = 0
    Let r = x/c, then the equation for the ratio becomes:
    2*r**2 + 2*r - 1 = 0

    This script solves this equation for the ratio r and then gives x in terms of c.
