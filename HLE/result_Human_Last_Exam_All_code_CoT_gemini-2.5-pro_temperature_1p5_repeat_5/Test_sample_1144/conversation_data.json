    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Knowns:** We are given the uncertainty in the electron's position, `Δx = 10 pm`.\n2.  **Identify Unknowns:** We need to find the ratio of the uncertainty in momentum (`Δp`) to the momentum (`p`) of the electron in the first Bohr orbit (`n=1`).\n3.  **Apply Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This principle relates the uncertainty in position (`Δx`) and momentum (`Δp`). Using the minimum uncertainty limit:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n    where `ħ` is the reduced Planck constant.\n4.  **Apply Bohr's Model for Momentum:** The momentum (`p`) of an electron in the first Bohr orbit (`n=1`) is related to the radius of that orbit (`r₁`, also known as the Bohr radius `a₀`) by the quantization of angular momentum:\n    `p * a₀ = 1 * ħ`\n    Therefore, `p = ħ / a₀`.\n5.  **Formulate the Ratio:** We can now express the desired ratio `Δp / p`:\n    `Ratio = Δp / p = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀)`\n6.  **Simplify the Expression:** The reduced Planck constant (`ħ`) cancels out, leaving a simple expression involving only the known lengths:\n    `Ratio = a₀ / (2 * Δx)`\n7.  **Code the Calculation:** We will use Python to define the constants for the Bohr radius (`a₀`) and the given uncertainty in position (`Δx`), then compute the ratio using the simplified formula.\n\n```python\nimport scipy.constants\n\n# 1. Define the given values and constants.\n# Uncertainty in position (Δx) in meters. Given as 10 pm.\ndelta_x_pm = 10\ndelta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12\n\n# Bohr radius (a₀), the radius of the first Bohr orbit, from scipy constants.\na_0 = scipy.constants.physical_constants[\"Bohr radius\"][0]\n\n# 2. The ratio Δp/p simplifies to a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n# Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx) from Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.\n# p = ħ / a₀ for the first Bohr orbit.\n# Ratio = Δp / p = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / a₀) = a₀ / (2 * Δx).\n\n# 3. Calculate the ratio.\nratio = a_0 / (2 * delta_x_m)\n\n# 4. Print the final equation and the result.\nprint(f\"The ratio is calculated as: Bohr radius / (2 * uncertainty in position)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {a_0} m / (2 * {delta_x_m} m)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.6458860545150003>>>"
