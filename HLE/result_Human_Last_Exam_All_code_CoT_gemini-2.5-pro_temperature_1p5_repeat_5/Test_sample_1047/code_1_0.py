# The scenario describes a conflict of interest.
# A law firm, NC LLP, previously represented Advanced Tech Inc. (ATI) and obtained significant confidential information.
# Now, NC LLP is representing Six Wings Inc. (SWI) in an acquisition of ATI.
# This creates a conflict because the firm's confidential information about ATI is directly relevant to the new matter and could be used against ATI's interests.

# Let's analyze the provided options:
# A is incorrect. The matters are "related" in a legal ethics sense because the confidential information from the first matter is relevant to the second.
# B is incorrect. While "ethical screens" are a tool, they cannot cure a direct conflict where highly relevant information is held, especially without the consent of the former client. They do not address the duty of loyalty.
# C focuses on the partners' access, which is a factor but not the core reason for disqualification. The conflict would exist regardless of their partner status due to imputed knowledge.
# E is incorrect. It misstates the rule; this is a former-client conflict, not a concurrent-representation conflict, and consent is often a valid remedy.
# D is correct. A clear conflict exists. In such cases, the law firm can only proceed if it gets informed consent from the party that could be harmed (the former client, ATI). The facts explicitly state that ATI will not consent. Therefore, NC LLP is prohibited from continuing the representation.

# Define the correct option
correct_answer = "D"
