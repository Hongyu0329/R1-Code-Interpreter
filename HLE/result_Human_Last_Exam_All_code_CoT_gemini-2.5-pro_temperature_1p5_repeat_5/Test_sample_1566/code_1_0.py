    print("The problem states that for an end point 'a', for any r > 0, there is an open cover U_1, ..., U_N of the entire space X such that a is in U_1 and U_i intersects U_j if and only if |i-j| <= 1.")
    print("This property of admitting a 'chain' cover for any level of fineness means that X is a 'chainable continuum'.")
    print("A fundamental property of chainable continua is that they cannot contain any subspace homeomorphic to a circle (i.e., no simple closed curves).")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyze Property (1) - 'finitely many end points > 1'.")
    print("A chainable continuum that contains no simple closed curves is known as a dendrite (or tree-like space).")
    print("A dendrite with a finite number of end points is topologically equivalent to a finite, connected, acyclic graph, which is simply a 'tree' in graph theory.")
    print("The 'end points' of the continuum correspond to the leaves of the tree (vertices of degree 1). Let n be the number of end points, with n > 1.")

    print("\nStep 3: Analyze Property (2) - 'exactly two orbits'.")
    print("The space X is partitioned into exactly two orbits under the action of its auto-homeomorphism group.")
    print("An auto-homeomorphism must map an end point to another end point, because the 'end point' property is topological.")
    print("This means the set of all end points, E, is an invariant set under these homeomorphisms. Therefore, E must be one of the two orbits.")
    print("The other orbit must be the set of all other points: X \\ E (the non-end-points).")
    print("So, the two orbits are:")
    print("  Orbit 1 = E (the set of n end points)")
    print("  Orbit 2 = X \\ E (the set of all non-end-points)")

    print("\nStep 4: Combine the analyses to find the structure of X.")
    print("We know X is a finite tree and its set of non-end-points (X \\ E) is a single orbit.")
    print("For a set of points in a topological space to be one orbit, all points in the set must be topologically indistinguishable.")
    print("In a tree, the non-end-points can be of two types:")
    print("  a) 'Edge points': Interior points of edges, which have topological order/degree 2.")
    print("  b) 'Branch points': Vertices with degree 3 or more.")
    print("A homeomorphism can't map an edge point to a branch point, as their local neighborhoods are not homeomorphic.")
    print("Since all points in the orbit X \\ E must be alike, we cannot have both types of points. The set X \\ E must be homogeneous.")
    print("This implies that either there are no edge points, or there are no branch points.")
    print("  - If there are no edge points, the tree consists only of vertices and has no edges. For a connected space, this means X is a single point, which contradicts having n > 1 end points.")
    print("  - Therefore, there must be no branch points. The tree has no vertices of degree 3 or higher.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final conclusion on the structure.")
    print("A finite, connected tree with no vertices of degree > 2 must be a simple path graph.")
    print("Any path graph is topologically homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].")
    print("Let's verify this single candidate, X = [0, 1]:")
    print("  - Is it a continuum? Yes, it's compact and connected.")
    print("  - Property (1): It has 2 end points ({0, 1}). 2 is finite and greater than 1. This holds.")
    print("  - Property (2): The group of auto-homeomorphisms includes the reflection h(x) = 1-x. The orbits are indeed the set of endpoints {0, 1} and the set of interior points (0, 1). This is exactly two orbits. This holds.")
    print("  - End point definition: [0,1] is a classic example of a chainable continuum. This holds.")

    print("\nStep 6: The Final Answer.")
    print("The logical deduction shows that any continuum satisfying the given conditions must be topologically equivalent (homeomorphic) to the closed interval [0, 1].")
    print("Since all such continua belong to the same topological type, there is only one.")
