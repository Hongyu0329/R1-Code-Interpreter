    "My plan is to deduce the identity of the person described using the provided clues.\n\n1.  **Analyze the poet:** The reference to Andrei Voznesensky, a famous Russian poet, strongly suggests the subject is a figure from Russian history.\n2.  **Analyze the description:** \"A joy-discovering sailor\" points to an explorer or navigator.\n3.  **Analyze the mystery:** The lines \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\" and the fact that the answer \"emerged in the late 1980s\" are the most crucial clues. This indicates a historical figure whose burial site was lost and then rediscovered or identified around that time.\n4.  **Synthesize the clues:** Voznesensky's most famous work involving a historical sailor whose grave was lost is the rock opera \"Juno and Avos.\" The main character is the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolay Rezanov. He died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807, and his original grave was destroyed. Fueled by the popularity of the opera, renewed interest in the late 20th century led to the re-identification and memorialization of his burial site.\n\nTherefore, the man is Nikolay Rezanov. The task asks for his last name. I will write a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\n# The individual described in the riddle is Nikolay Rezanov (1764-1807).\n# He was a Russian nobleman and explorer.\n# The poet Andrei Voznesensky immortalized him in the rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n# The libretto contains lines questioning the location of his grave, which was lost for many years\n# before its location was re-established in Krasnoyarsk, with significant developments occurring in the late 1980s.\n\n# The last name of this man is:\nlast_name = \"Rezanov\"\n\nprint(last_name)\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
