    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.

    Trisyllabic Laxing is a historical sound change where a long vowel becomes short
    when it is in the antepenultimate (third from last) syllable.
    Example: sane /seɪn/ (long vowel) -> san-i-ty /ˈsæn.ɪ.ti/ (short vowel).
