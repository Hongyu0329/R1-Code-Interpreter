The appropriate management involves immediate medical stabilization of her diabetes (HbA1c of 7.5%) and dental wound care, followed by a definitive prosthetic solution after healing. The key cells for healing are neutrophils, macrophages, fibroblasts, and osteoblasts. Given the skeletal profile (SNB angle of 88Â°) and the loss of the left lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar, a cast partial denture made of a Cobalt-Chromium framework would be a suitable choice. The abutment teeth would be the left central incisor and the left second premolar, as they are adjacent to the gap and can provide support and retention for the prosthesis.
