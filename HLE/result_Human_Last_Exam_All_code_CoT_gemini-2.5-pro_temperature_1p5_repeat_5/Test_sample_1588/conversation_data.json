    "To determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The BCH formula, which expresses `Z` in `e^Z = e^X e^Y`, is constructed from basis elements of a free Lie algebra on two generators (`X` and `Y`). It's a known theorem that all such basis elements have nonzero coefficients in the expansion.\n\nTherefore, the problem is equivalent to finding the dimension of the subspace of elements of degree 10 in the free Lie algebra on two generators. This dimension is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`N(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(n/d) * k^d`\n\nwhere:\n-   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 in our case.\n-   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for X and Y).\n-   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n-   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\nMy plan is to implement this formula in Python:\n1.  Set `n = 10` and `k = 2`.\n2.  Write a helper function to find all divisors of `n`.\n3.  Write a helper function to compute the Möbius function, `μ(m)`. This will involve finding the prime factorization of `m`.\n4.  Iterate through the divisors `d` of `n`, calculate `μ(n/d) * k^d` for each, and sum the results.\n5.  Finally, divide the sum by `n` to get the answer.\n6.  The code will print out each step of the calculation to show how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n       factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef moebius(m):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Moebius function mu(m).\"\"\"\n    if m == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(m)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0  # mu(m) = 0 if m has a squared prime factor\n    return (-1) ** len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(m):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all divisors of m.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(m)) + 1):\n        if m % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(m // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero BCH coefficients for a given order\n    using Witt's formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2 # Number of generators (X, Y)\n\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients of order {n} in the BCH expansion is given by Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"N(n) = (1/n) * sum_{{d|n}} mu(n/d) * k^d\")\n    print(f\"Here, n = {n} and k = {k}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    divs = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors 'd' of {n} are: {divs}\")\n\n    total_sum = 0\n    sum_expr_parts = []\n    \n    # Building the expression string for the numerator sum\n    numerator_expr_str = \"Sum = \" + \" + \".join([f\"mu({n}/{d}) * {k}^{d}\" for d in divs])\n    print(f\"\\nCalculating the sum part of the formula:\")\n    print(numerator_expr_str)\n\n    # Calculate values and build the detailed expression\n    mu_values = [moebius(n // d) for d in divs]\n    k_pow_d_values = [k**d for d in divs]\n    term_values = [mu * kd for mu, kd in zip(mu_values, k_pow_d_values)]\n\n    values_str = \"    = \" + \" + \".join([f\"({mu}) * {kd}\" for mu, kd in zip(mu_values, k_pow_d_values)])\n    print(values_str)\n    \n    calculation_str = \"    = \" + \" + \".join([str(val) for val in term_values]).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    total_sum = sum(term_values)\n    print(f\"{calculation_str}\")\n    print(f\"    = {total_sum}\")\n\n    # Final calculation\n    result = total_sum // n\n    print(\"\\nFinally, divide the sum by n:\")\n    print(f\"Result = (1/{n}) * {total_sum}\")\n    print(f\"Result = {result}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThus, the number of nonzero coefficients is:\")\n    print(result)\n\nsolve_bch_count()\n<<<99>>>\n```"
