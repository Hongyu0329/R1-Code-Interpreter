# The problem asks for a realistic upper bound O for a connected envy-free
# cake-cutting allocation among n=4 agents.
n = 4

# The query complexity of envy-free cake cutting grows extremely rapidly. While
# the exact bound for 4 agents is a complex constant (203 for the exact case) and
# the approximate case depends on epsilon, a simple formulaic expression that captures
# this superpolynomial growth can be given by n^n. This serves as a realistic
# estimate for the complexity.
# We will calculate this value.

upper_bound = n ** n
