            'reasoning': "Plausibility: High. Self-censorship by an author for political or social reasons is historically common. Aligning the text with the patriarchal values of the Shogunate or removing potentially controversial content is a logical and pragmatic motivation."

        'B': {
            'summary': "Transcribers' Censorship: Scribes considered the techniques morally inappropriate and chose not to copy them.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: High. Scribal censorship is a well-documented phenomenon across cultures. If the kunoichi techniques involved methods (e.g., seduction, assassination) that contradicted the era's rigid social or moral codes, official transcribers may have omitted them."
        },
        'C': {
            'summary': "Redaction to Protect Lady Saig≈ç: The techniques were removed to hide their use by a key political figure in the Tokugawa Shogunate.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: Medium to High. Protecting the reputation of a powerful family or leader by redacting compromising information is a classic form of political censorship. It provides a strong and specific motive tied to the stability of the ruling Shogunate."
        },
        'D': {
            'summary': "Oniwaban State Secret Redaction: The Shogunate's intelligence service removed active techniques to maintain secrecy.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: High. This is a matter of standard operational security. An intelligence service would logically redact its own active tradecraft from any manual that could be copied or distributed, thus protecting state secrets. This is one of the most widely accepted theories."
        },
        'E': {
            'summary': "Invisible Ink (Aburidashi): The original text was written in invisible ink, which uninitiated scribes could not see.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: Medium. Invisible ink was a known ninja technique. It's conceivable that a secret text would employ it. Scribes, unable to reveal the text, would have noted the blank space with circles, indicating something was there but unreadable."
        },
        'F': {
            'summary': "Mnemonic Device for Oral Tradition: The circles were not placeholders for text but memory aids for techniques taught orally.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: Medium to High. Many martial arts and esoteric traditions rely on oral transmission, with written texts acting only as encoded reminders for initiates. Outsiders would not understand their meaning and would simply copy the abstract symbols."
        },
        'G': {
            'summary': "Physical Deterioration: The section was heavily used and the ink faded, making it illegible to later transcribers.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: High. Manuscript degradation is a very common reason for lost text. A frequently referenced section would wear out. Honest scribes, unable to decipher the faded content, would use placeholders to indicate where the text was, preserving the integrity of the transcription."
        },
        'H': {
            'summary': "Misinterpretation of Kujiho/Taoist Rituals: The circles represent a flawed transcription of symbols for 'nine body holes' and Taoist erotic energy rituals.",
            'reasoning': "Plausibility: Low. This explanation is the least plausible because it mixes multiple disparate and anachronistic concepts. The Kujiho are Buddhist hand-seals, not Taoist symbols for body holes. The mention of 'chakras' and 'erotic energy rituals' sounds more like modern New Age interpretations than historical 17th-century ninjutsu. This theory requires a convoluted chain of misinterpretations rather than a single, direct cause like censorship or damage."
