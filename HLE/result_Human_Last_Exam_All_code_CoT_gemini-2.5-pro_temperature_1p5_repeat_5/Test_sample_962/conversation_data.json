    "This is a fascinating and advanced question in cryptography. Designing a secure cryptographic scheme from scratch is a highly complex process that requires rigorous peer-reviewed security proofs. I will not invent a new scheme, but instead, I will explain and implement a simplified version of a well-known scheme that fits your criteria: **FROST (Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold Signatures)**.\n\nFROST is a state-of-the-art threshold signature scheme. In its most common configuration, its signing protocol consists of two rounds. It is based on the widely used Schnorr signature algorithm and is designed for high security.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Key Generation:** I will simulate a \"trusted dealer\" that generates a master key pair and then uses Shamir's Secret Sharing to split the private key into `n` shares. In a real-world scenario, this would be done using a secure Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol to avoid a single point of trust.\n2.  **Signing Round 1 (Commitment):** A threshold `t` of the participants decide to sign a message. Each of these `t` participants will generate a secret random number (a \"nonce\") and compute a public value from it (a \"commitment\"). They then share these commitments with each other.\n3.  **Signing Round 2 (Signature Share):** After receiving all commitments, each participant computes a group commitment. Then, they each generate a partial signature share using their private key share, their secret nonce, and the group commitment.\n4.  **Aggregation:** A coordinator (who can be one of the signers) collects the `t` partial signatures and combines them into a single, final signature.\n5.  **Verification:** Finally, I will show how anyone can verify this final signature using only the master public key, without needing to know anything about the individual signers or their key shares. I will print the values on both sides of the final verification equation to show that they match, as you requested.\n\nFor the implementation, I will use the `fastecdsa` library for the underlying elliptic curve mathematics, which is the foundation for modern signature schemes like this.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport hashlib\nfrom fastecdsa.curve import secp256k1\nfrom fastecdsa.point import Point\n\n# Use the secp256k1 curve, common in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum\nC = secp256k1\n# G is the generator point of the curve\nG = C.G\n# q is the order of the curve's base field\nq = C.q\n\ndef int_to_hex(i):\n    \"\"\"Helper to convert an integer to a hex string for hashing.\"\"\"\n    return hex(i)[2:]\n\ndef point_to_hex(p):\n    \"\"\"Helper to convert an elliptic curve point to a hex string for hashing.\"\"\"\n    return int_to_hex(p.x) + int_to_hex(p.y)\n\ndef challenge_hash(public_key, group_commitment, message):\n    \"\"\"Computes the challenge `c` by hashing the public key, commitment, and message.\"\"\"\n    h = hashlib.sha25le()\n    h.update(point_to_hex(public_key).encode('utf-8'))\n    h.update(point_to_hex(group_commitment).encode('utf-8'))\n    h.update(message.encode('utf-8'))\n    return int(h.hexdigest(), 16) % q\n\ndef shamir_share(secret, threshold, num_parties):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates Shamir's secret shares for a given secret.\n    Returns a list of (x, y) pairs where y = f(x) for a random polynomial f.\n    \"\"\"\n    if threshold > num_parties:\n        raise ValueError(\"Threshold cannot be greater than the number of parties.\")\n    \n    # Generate a random polynomial of degree (threshold - 1)\n    # The constant term is the secret\n    coeffs = [secret] + [int.from_bytes(os.urandom(32), 'big') % q for _ in range(threshold - 1)]\n\n    def poly(x):\n        val = 0\n        # Evaluate polynomial using Horner's method for efficiency\n        for coeff in reversed(coeffs):\n            val = (val * x + coeff) % q\n        return val\n\n    # Generate points on the polynomial for each party\n    shares = []\n    for i in range(1, num_parties + 1):\n        shares.append((i, poly(i)))\n        \n    return shares\n\ndef get_lagrange_coeffs(participant_indices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Lagrange coefficients for a given set of participants.\n    These are used to combine the signature shares correctly.\n    \"\"\"\n    coeffs = {}\n    for i in participant_indices:\n        numerator = 1\n        denominator = 1\n        for j in participant_indices:\n            if i != j:\n                numerator = (numerator * j) % q\n                # We need modular inverse for division\n                denominator = (denominator * (j - i)) % q\n        coeffs[i] = (numerator * pow(denominator, -1, q)) % q\n    return coeffs\n\n# --- Main Protocol ---\nprint(\"--- Setup ---\")\nt = 3  # Threshold\nn = 5  # Total number of parties\nmessage = \"This is a test of a two-round threshold signature scheme\"\n\nprint(f\"Configuration: t={t}, n={n}\\n\")\n\n# 1.
