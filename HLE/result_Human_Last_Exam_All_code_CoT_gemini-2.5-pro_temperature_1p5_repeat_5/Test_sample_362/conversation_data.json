    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this organic chemistry problem:\n\nFirst, I will identify the structures of the two reactants provided: the aldehyde (pivalaldehyde) and the phosphorus ylide ((2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane).\n\nSecond, I will apply the rules of the Wittig reaction. This reaction forms a carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the carbonyl oxygen of the aldehyde with the carbon group from the ylide. The other product of the reaction is triphenylphosphine oxide.\n\nThird, based on the combined fragments, I will determine the precise structure and the correct IUPAC name for the resulting alkene product. This includes determining the stereochemistry (Z vs E isomer) of the double bond, as non-stabilized ylides like the one in this problem predominantly form the Z-isomer.\n\nFinally, I will generate a Python script to present the answer. The script will display the overall chemical equation and print the full IUPAC name of the product. As requested, the script will also explicitly output the numbers used in the product's IUPAC name, which specify the locations of the functional groups and substituents.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of a specific Wittig reaction,\n    prints the reaction equation, and highlights the numbering in the product's IUPAC name.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # 1.
