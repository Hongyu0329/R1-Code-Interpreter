    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group Parameters:** The semidihedral group, denoted as $SD_{2^n}$, has an order of $2^n$. The given group has a size of 512. We will first determine the value of 'n'.\n2.  **Recall the Properties of Power Subgroups:** A subgroup H is a power subgroup of G if $H = G^k = \\{g^k | g \\in G\\}$ for some integer k. The number of distinct power subgroups for $SD_{2^n}$ follows a known formula.\n3.  **Apply the Formula:** For a semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ (where $n \\ge 3$), the number of power subgroups is simply 'n'.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** We will write a Python script that calculates 'n' from the group size and then prints the result. The script will also display the equation used to find 'n' as requested.\n\nHere is the plan applied in the Python code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Identify the group parameters.\n    # The group is the semidihedral group of size 512.\n    # A semidihedral group SD_{2^n} has an order of 2^n.\n    group_size = 512\n\n    # We need to find the value of n by solving the equation 2^n = group_size.\n    # n = log2(group_size)\n    if group_size <= 0 or (group_size & (group_size - 1)) != 0:\n        print(f\"Error: The group size {group_size} is not a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: Apply the known result for the number of power subgroups.\n    # For a semidihedral group SD_{2^n} (with n >= 3), the number of power subgroups is equal to n.\n    # Our n=9, so the formula is applicable.\n    num_power_subgroups = n\n\n    # Step 4: Print the explanation and the result, including the equation.\n    print(f\"The semidihedral group of size {group_size} is denoted as SD_{{2**n}}.\")\n    print(\"To find the parameter 'n', we solve the equation for the group's order:\")\n    print(f\"  2^n = {group_size}\")\n    print(\"Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides gives:\")\n    print(f\"  n = log2({group_size})\")\n    print(f\"The calculated value of n is {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nFor any semidihedral group SD_{2^n} (with n >= 3), the number of distinct power subgroups is n.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the number of power subgroups is {num_power_subgroups}.\")\n\nsolve()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
