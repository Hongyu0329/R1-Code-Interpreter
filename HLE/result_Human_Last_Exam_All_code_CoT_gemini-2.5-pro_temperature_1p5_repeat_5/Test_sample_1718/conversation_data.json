    "To determine the number of independent entries of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold, we need to consider the specific symmetries imposed by the Kähler conditions on top of the usual Riemannian symmetries. The answer depends on the dimension of the manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **State the relationship between real and complex dimensions:** A Kähler manifold is a complex manifold, so its real dimension `n` is always even. We denote the complex dimension by `m`, where `n = 2m`.\n2.  **Introduce the formula:** The presence of a compatible complex structure `J` adds symmetries to the Riemann tensor. These symmetries reduce the number of independent components significantly compared to a general Riemannian manifold. The number of independent real components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` is given by the formula:\n    `N = (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2`\n3.  **Calculate for an example:** Since the question does not specify a dimension, I will calculate the number for a non-trivial and important case: a 4-dimensional Kähler manifold. This corresponds to a complex dimension of `m = 2`. This is the dimension of, for example, a K3 surface.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will provide a Python script that calculates this number for `m=2`, showing each step of the calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation for a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m=2`.\n\n```python\n# The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold\n# depends on its complex dimension, denoted by 'm'.
