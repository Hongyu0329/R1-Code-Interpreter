# The number of independent components of the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold
# depends on its complex dimension, denoted by 'm'. The real dimension is n = 2m.

# The formula for the number of independent components is N = (m * (m + 1) / 2)^2.

# We will calculate this for a common non-trivial example: a 4-dimensional
# Kähler manifold, which has a complex dimension m = 2.

# Complex dimension
m = 2

# Step 1: Calculate the term inside the parenthesis: m * (m + 1) / 2
# This represents the dimension of the space of symmetric tensors of rank 2
# on a complex vector space of dimension m.
m_plus_1 = m + 1
numerator = m * m_plus_1
denominator = 2
value_inside = numerator / denominator

# Step 2: Square the result
final_result = value_inside ** 2

# Print the calculation step-by-step
