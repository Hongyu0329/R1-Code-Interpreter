    "My plan is to compute the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix `A`. The context about the 'Markov quiver for m_{1/2} = 13' does not alter the calculation, as the matrix `A` is explicitly provided.\n\nI will use the standard formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix:\nFor a matrix `A = [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]]`, the determinant is `det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)`.\n\nThe Python code will perform the following steps:\n1.  Define the matrix `A`.\n2.  Extract the elements of the matrix into individual variables `a, b, c, ... i`.\n3.  Calculate the determinant step-by-step based on the formula.\n4.  Print each stage of the calculation, clearly showing how the numbers from the matrix are substituted into the formula and simplified to reach the final result. This will satisfy the requirement to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n5.  Print the final computed determinant.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and shows the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given adjacency matrix\n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # Extract elements for clarity in the formula display\n    a, b, c = A[0, :]\n    d, e, f = A[1, :]\n    g, h, i = A[2, :]\n\n    # Calculate intermediate values for the cofactors\n    cofactor_a = e * i - f * h\n    cofactor_b = d * i - f * g\n    cofactor_c = d * h - e * g\n\n    # Calculate the full determinant\n    determinant = a * cofactor_a - b * cofactor_b + c * cofactor_c\n\n    print(\"The given adjacency matrix is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\\n\")\n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute the values from matrix A into the formula.\")\n    # Helper to format negative numbers with parentheses\n    def s(val):\n        return f\"({val})\" if val < 0 else str(val)\n\n    print(f\"det(A) = {s(a)}*({s(e)}*{s(i)} - {s(f)}*{s(h)}) - {s(b)}*({s(d)}*{s(i)} - {s(f)}*{s(g)}) + {s(c)}*({s(d)}*{s(h)} - {s(e)}*{s(g)})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the products inside the parentheses.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {s(a)}*({e*i} - {f*h}) - {s(b)}*({d*i} - {f*g}) + {s(c)}*({d*h} - {e*g})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the value of each sub-determinant (cofactor term).\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {s(a)}*({cofactor_a}) - {s(b)}*({cofactor_b}) + {s(c)}*({cofactor_c})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Perform the multiplications.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a * cofactor_a} - ({b * cofactor_b}) + ({c * cofactor_c})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Perform the final addition and subtraction to get the result.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the determinant of the matrix A is {int(round(determinant))}.\")\n\nsolve_determinant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
