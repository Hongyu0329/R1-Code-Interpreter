    # Part A Analysis
    # A Turing machine can simulate the given architecture. The machine's operations
    # (arithmetic, logic, memory access, conditional branching) are all effectively computable.
    # The definition of a "boopable function" provides for arbitrarily large machine
    # resources (R, A, W), which is equivalent to a Turing machine's infinite tape.
    # Any function computable on this machine is therefore also Turing-computable.
    # So the answer to A is Yes.

    # Part B Analysis
    # We need to determine if a program L exists to compute f(x)=x for x in [0, 2^32)
    # with a runtime of at most x + 50 steps on the specified machine.
    # This means the number of non-BOOP instructions executed for any input x must be at most 50.

    # The machine's instruction set lacks indirect addressing. The address for a BRANCH
    # or a LOAD/STORE operation must be a constant embedded in the instruction. It cannot
    # be a value from a register.
    
    # This means to have different behavior for different inputs x, the program must
    # explicitly check for x's value using a series of conditional branches.
    # The most efficient way to implement `if x == C:` is with a subtraction and a branch-if-zero.
    # This requires at least two instructions.
    
    # To handle all possible inputs in the range [0, 2^32), the program must be able
    # to distinguish all these values. A program would have to contain a cascade of
    # checks for each possible value, from 2^32-1 down to 0.
    
    # Let's analyze the worst-case scenario for such a program: the input x=0.
    # The program would have to check for x == 2^32-1, x == 2^32-2, ..., x == 1,
    # and fail each check before concluding that x must be 0.
    
    N = 2**32  # The number of possible values for x
    x = 0      # The worst-case input value for a high-to-low check
    
    # Number of checks to be performed for x=0.
    # It must test against every non-zero value from N-1 down to 1.
    num_checks = N - 1
    
    # Cost per check in instructions (a very conservative estimate).
    # Needs at least one arithmetic op and one branch op.
    cost_per_check = 2
    
    # The equation for the number of non-BOOP steps for x=0 is:
    # non_boop_steps = num_checks * cost_per_check
    # And this must be less than or equal to 50.
