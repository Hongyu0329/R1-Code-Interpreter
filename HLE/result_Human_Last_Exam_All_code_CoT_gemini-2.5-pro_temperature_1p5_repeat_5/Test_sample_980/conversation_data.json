    "This sequence is a puzzle that does not follow a simple mathematical formula. To find the next number, we need to identify the underlying pattern within the sequence itself.\n\n### My plan:\n1.  I will analyze the sequence to find recurring patterns or structures.\n2.  I have observed that a pattern of the form `x, y, x` (a number, a different number, then the first number again) appears in the sequence. For example, `111, 142, 111` near the beginning, and `49, 155, 49` in the middle.\n3.  The very end of the sequence is `..., 124, 36, 124`. This fits the `x, y, x` pattern with `x=124` and `y=36`.\n4.  When such a pattern `x, y, x` occurs, it often establishes an alternation. It's plausible that the sequence will continue this alternation, making the next number `y`.\n5.  Therefore, I hypothesize that the number following `124, 36, 124` will be `36`.\n6.  I will write a Python script that checks for this pattern at the end of the sequence and prints the discovered relationship and the predicted next number.\n\n```python\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the given sequence to find the next number.\n    It looks for an alternating pattern of the form 'x, y, x' at the end of the sequence\n    and predicts 'y' as the next number.\n    \"\"\"\n    sequence = [111, 142, 111, 41, 67, 67, 67, 93, 111, 111, 62, 62, 111, 111, 36, 36, 49, 155, 49, 62, 49, 49, 62, 62, 10, 36, 36, 36, 124, 124, 124, 36, 124]\n\n    # Check if the sequence has at least 3 elements\n    if len(sequence) >= 3:\n        # Get the last three numbers\n        last_three = sequence[-3:]\n        x = last_three[0]\n        y = last_three[1]\n        \n        # Check if the pattern is x, y, x\n        if last_three[2] == x and x != y:\n            next_number = y\n            print(\"The pattern at the end of the sequence is an alternation.\")\n            # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\"\n            # We interpret this as showing the logic of the pattern.\n            print(f\"The detected pattern is: {x}, {y}, {x}, ...\")\n            print(f\"Based on this alternating pattern, the next number should be {next_number}.\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Could not determine a clear alternating pattern at the end.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sequence is too short to find a pattern.\")\n\nfind_next_number_in_sequence()\n\n```\n<<<36>>>"
