Based on your prescriptions, the main counseling recommendation involves the Excedrin you took for your headache.
1. There is an interaction between your Fluoxetine 20mg and the Excedrin (which contains Aspirin). When taken together, they can create an increased risk of stomach bleeding. For future headaches, it would be safer to use a product containing just acetaminophen (the active ingredient in Tylenol).
2. Also, because you are taking Junel Fe 1.5/30mg, it's important to know that new or worsening headaches can be a serious side effect of oral contraceptives. If your headaches continue, get worse, or feel different from normal, please make sure to contact your doctor.
Your Atorvastatin 20mg does not have a significant interaction here.
