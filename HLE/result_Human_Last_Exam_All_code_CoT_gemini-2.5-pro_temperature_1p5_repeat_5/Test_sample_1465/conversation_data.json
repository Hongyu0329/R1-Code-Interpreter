    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the oligomeric state of the provided protein sequences.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Sequences**: The oligomeric state of a coiled-coil protein is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of its heptad (`abcdefg`) repeat, specifically the 'a' and 'd' positions. I will analyze the pattern of hydrophobic residues in each sequence to deduce the most likely 'a' and 'd' occupants.\n2.  **Apply Packing Rules**: I will apply well-established rules based on the identity of the amino acids at the 'a' and 'd' positions:\n    *   **Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Leucine (L) at 'd'**: This pairing is sterically favorable for a **dimer (2)**.\n    *   **Isoleucine (I) at both 'a' and 'd'**: The steric clash of the bulky, β-branched Isoleucine side chains is best accommodated in a **tetramer (4)**.\n    *   **Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Threonine (T) at 'd'**: Threonine is also a β-branched residue. This pairing creates steric hindrance that favors a **trimer (3)** over a dimer.\n    *   Slight variations, like Alanine (A) at 'd', generally behave like Leucine and favor **dimers (2)**.\n3.  **Generate Predictions**: Based on these rules, I will predict the oligomeric state for each of the five sequences.\n4.  **Construct Python Code**: I will write a Python script that formalizes this logic. The script will take the sequences as input, apply the prediction rules, and print the reasoning and the final sequence of predicted oligomeric states.\n\nHere is the Python script to execute the plan:\n\n```python\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on\n    core residue packing rules ('a' and 'd' positions).\n\n    Args:\n        sequences (list): A list of protein sequences.\n\n    Returns:\n        list: A list of integers representing the predicted oligomeric states.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing coiled-coil sequences based on core packing rules...\\n\")\n    \n    predictions = []\n    \n    # Sequence 1: Contains motifs like EIAQALK and EIAKALK.\n    # This pattern strongly suggests Isoleucine (I) at 'a' and Leucine (L) or Alanine (A) at 'd'.\n    # Rule: I/L or I/A pairing favors a Dimer.\n    state_1 = 2\n    predictions.append(state_1)\n    print(f\"Sequence 1: The core resembles an I/L or I/A pattern.
