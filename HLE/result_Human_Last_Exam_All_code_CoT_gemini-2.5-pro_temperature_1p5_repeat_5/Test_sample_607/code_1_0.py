    Analyzes the convergence properties of three optimization algorithms.

    (1) Gradient Descent: Converges only to stationary points.
        The fixed point x* of the iteration x_k+1 = x_k - gamma * grad(f(x_k))
        must satisfy x* = x* - gamma * grad(f(x*)), which implies grad(f(x*)) = 0.

    (2) Doubly-Projected Gradient Descent: Converges only to stationary points.
        A fixed point x* of this iteration satisfies a condition implying that the
        projected gradient is zero, which is the definition of stationarity on
        a constraint set.

    (3) Heavy-ball Method: Can converge to a non-stationary point.
        While a simple analysis suggests it should converge to a stationary point,
        counter-examples exist in the literature. These are typically for
        specifically constructed smooth functions where the momentum term prevents
        convergence to the actual minimum, even while the iterate sequence itself converges.
