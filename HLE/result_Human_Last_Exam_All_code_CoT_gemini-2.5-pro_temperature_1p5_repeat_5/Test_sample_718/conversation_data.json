    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the solution.\n\nFirst, let's understand the key terms:\n1.  **Upper Semilattice ($J$):** This is a partially ordered set where any two elements $x, y \\in J$ have a least upper bound, also called a supremum or join, denoted $x \\vee y$. When viewed as a category, this means for any two objects $x,y$, the sub-poset of their common upper bounds $\\{z \\in J \\mid z \\ge x, z \\ge y\\}$ has a minimal element.\n2.  **Functor ($f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$):** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(j_1 \\to j_2): f(j_1) \\to f(j_2)$ for each relation $j_1 \\le j_2$ in $J$, in a way that respects composition.\n3.  **$n$-resolvable:** A functor $f$ is called $n$-resolvable if it has a projective resolution of length at most $n$. That is, there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n    $0 \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. The minimal such $n$ is the projective dimension of $f$. The question asks for the number $n$ such that *any* tame functor on $J$ is $n$-resolvable. This amounts to finding the maximum possible projective dimension for these functors.\n\nThe solution relies on a fundamental result in the representation theory of posets concerning the global dimension of the functor category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$.\n\n**Key Theorem:** The global dimension of the category $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$ is less than or equal to 1 if and only if the poset $J$ is an upper semilattice.\n\nA category with global dimension $\\le 1$ is called a hereditary category. The problem states that $J$ is an upper semilattice. By this theorem, the category of its representations, $\\text{Fun}(J, \\text{Vect}_K)$, is hereditary.\n\nThe global dimension of a category is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects within it. So, if the global dimension is at most 1, it means that for *any* functor $f: J \\to \\text{Vect}_K$, its projective dimension, $\\text{pd}(f)$, must be less than or equal to 1.\n\nThis holds for all functors, so it must also hold for the subset of functors that are \"tame\". The fact that the functor is tame is extraneous information; the result is more general.\n\nIf $\\text{pd}(f) \\le 1$, then by definition, $f$ admits a projective resolution of length at most 1. This means there is an exact sequence $0 \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$, which makes $f$ a 1-resolvable functor. Since this applies to any functor, the answer is $n=1$.\n\nThe following Python code will print this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homological_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and solves the user's question about tame functors on an upper semilattice.\n\n    The question is: Let J be an upper semilattice. Then a tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable for what n?\n\n    1.  An object (in this case, a functor f) is n-resolvable if it has a projective\n        dimension of at most n. The question asks for the smallest n that works for all\n        such functors.\n\n    2.  There is a key theorem in the representation theory of posets which states:\n        The category of functors Fun(J, Vect_K) has a global dimension of at most 1\n        if and only if J is an upper semilattice.\n\n    3.  The problem states that J is an upper semilattice. Therefore, the global dimension\n        of the category Fun(J, Vect_K) is at most 1.\n\n    4.  The global dimension is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all objects\n        (functors) in the category. This implies that for ANY functor f in this category,\n        its projective dimension pd(f) is less than or equal to 1.\n\n    5.  This result applies to all functors, including those that are 'tame'. The 'tame'\n        property is therefore not essential for the conclusion.\n\n    6.  Since pd(f) <= 1, any such functor f has a projective resolution of length at most 1.\n        By definition, this means f is 1-resolvable.\n\n    The value of n is therefore 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 1\n    # The question is for what n the functor is n-resolvable.\n    # The reasoning above leads to n=1.\n    # A functor is n-resolvable if its projective dimension is <= n.\n    # Since the global dimension of the category is 1, the projective dimension of any functor is <= 1.\n    # Thus, any functor is 1-resolvable.\n    print(f\"A tame functor f: J -> Vect_K is n-resolvable for n = {n}.\")\n\nsolve_homological_question()\n<<<1>>>"
