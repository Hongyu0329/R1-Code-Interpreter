    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the song you're looking for.\n\nFirst, I need to interpret the musical theory in your question.\n1.  The \"tonic\" is the main or \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's represented by the Roman numeral I.\n2.  The \"fifth chord\" in a major key is typically a major chord (the V chord). For example, in the key of G Major, the tonic (I) is G Major and the fifth chord (V) is D Major.\n3.  A \"minor fifth chord\" (v) is when that fifth chord is played as a minor instead of a major. In our G Major example, this would be a D minor (Dm) chord. This is a \"borrowed chord\" from the parallel minor key (G minor), and it creates a distinct, somewhat melancholic sound.\n4.  So, the task is to find a Beatles song in a major key that starts with its tonic chord (I) and immediately moves to the minor version of its fifth chord (v).\n\nThe song that fits this description is \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\" from the album *Help!*. The song is in the key of G major. It starts with the line \"You're goin' to lose that girl,\" and the first two chords are G major (the tonic, I) followed immediately by D minor (the minor fifth, v).\n\nI will now provide the Python code to output this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the Beatles song based on a specific opening chord progression.\n    The progression is a jump from the tonic (I) chord to the minor fifth (v) chord.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"You're Going to Lose That Girl\"\n    key = \"G Major\"\n    tonic_chord = \"G Major (I)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"D minor (v)\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Beatles song that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is: {song_title}\")\n    print(f\"The song is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"The progression is from the tonic chord, {tonic_chord}, to the minor fifth chord, {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<You're Going to Lose That Girl>>>"
