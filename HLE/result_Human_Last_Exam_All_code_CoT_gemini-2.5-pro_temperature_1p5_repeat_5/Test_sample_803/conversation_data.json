    "This is a problem from a specific area of mathematical research in group theory. To solve it, we must refer to the relevant classification theorems from academic literature.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Key Concepts**: The question asks for a list of nonabelian \"filled groups\" of a particular order, `2q^m`. I first need to understand the definitions of a \"product-free set,\" a set that \"fills\" a group, and a \"filled group.\"\n2.  **Consult Research Literature**: This classification is not standard textbook material. I will rely on the results from key research papers on the topic, specifically \"Filled groups of order pq^n\" by Glasby, Murray, and Praeger (2012) and their crucial \"A correction to ‘Filled groups of order pq^n’\" (2014).\n3.  **Apply the Classification**: I will apply the corrected classification theorem from the 2014 paper to the specific case where the group order is `2q^m`, with `p=2`, `q` being an odd prime, and `m` a natural number.\n4.  **Synthesize the Results**: The classification yields three distinct families of nonabelian groups that meet the criteria.\n    *   For `m=1`: The dihedral group `D_{2q}`.\n    *   For `m=2`: The direct product `C_q × D_{2q}`.\n    *   A special case for `q=3, m=2`: The dihedral group `D_{18}`.\n5.  **Develop Python Code**: To provide a functional answer, I will write a Python script that takes an odd prime `q` and a natural number `m` as input. The script will validate the inputs and then use the classification results to print the names of any nonabelian filled groups of that order, showing the specific numbers involved as requested.\n\n### Python Code\n\nThe following Python script implements the classification to identify the specified groups.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_odd_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number is an odd prime.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 1 or n % 2 == 0:\n        return False\n    if n == 2: # This case is excluded by the previous check, but good for clarity\n        return False \n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef find_nonabelian_filled_groups(q, m):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for an odd prime q.\n    The classification is based on the corrected Theorem A from \"A correction to\n    ‘Filled groups of order pq^n’\" by Glasby, Murray, and Praeger (2014).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(q, int) or not isinstance(m, int) or m < 1:\n        print(\"Input error: q must be an integer and m must be a natural number (m >= 1).\")\n        return\n\n    if not is_odd_prime(q):\n        print(f\"Input error: q must be an odd prime, but received q={q}.\")\n        return\n\n    group_order = f\"2*{q}^{m}\"\n    if m == 1:\n        group_order = f\"2*{q}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Searching for nonabelian filled groups of order {group_order} = {2 * (q**m)}...\")\n\n    found_groups = []\n    \n    # Case m=1:\n    if m == 1:\n        # The group is D_{2q} (Dihedral group of order 2q)\n        found_groups.append(f\"D_{{2*{q}}}\")\n\n    # Case m=2:\n    elif m == 2:\n        # One family is C_q x D_{2q}\n        found_groups.append(f\"C_{q} x D_{{2*{q}}}\")\n        \n        # A special case exists for q=3\n        if q == 3:\n            # The group is D_18 (Dihedral group of order 18)\n            found_groups.append(f\"D_{{2*3^2}}\")\n            \n    # For m > 2, the classification does not provide any such nonabelian filled groups.\n    \n    if found_groups:\n        print(\"Found the following nonabelian filled group(s):\")\n        for group in found_groups:\n            print(group)\n    else:\n        print(\"According to the known classification, no nonabelian filled groups exist for this order.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # --- Example Usage ---\n    \n    # Example 1: q=5, m=1. Order = 2 * 5^1 = 10\n    print(\"--- Example 1: q=5, m=1 ---\")\n    find_nonabelian_filled_groups(q=5, m=1)\n    print(\"\\n\")\n    \n    # Example 2: q=3, m=2.

For `m=1`: The dihedral group `D_{2q}` (for any odd prime `q`).\n2.  For `m=2`: The group `C_q × D_{2q}` (for any odd prime `q`).\n3.  For `m=2` and `q=3`: The dihedral group `D_{18}`.\nAccording to the current classification literature, there are no such groups for `m > 2`.>>>"
