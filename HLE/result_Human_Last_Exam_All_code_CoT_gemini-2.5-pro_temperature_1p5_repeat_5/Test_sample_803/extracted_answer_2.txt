The nonabelian filled groups of order `2q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m` are classified as follows:
1.  For `m=1`: The dihedral group `D_{2q}` (for any odd prime `q`).
2.  For `m=2`: The group `C_q Ã— D_{2q}` (for any odd prime `q`).
3.  For `m=2` and `q=3`: The dihedral group `D_{18}`.
According to the current classification literature, there are no such groups for `m > 2`.
