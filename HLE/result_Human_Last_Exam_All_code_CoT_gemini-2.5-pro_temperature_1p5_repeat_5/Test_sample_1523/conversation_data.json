    "Of course. This is a question from quantum field theory that involves symbolic expressions. I will use a Python script to programmatically construct and display the components of the relevant equations, which will clarify the structure of the inner product you're asking about.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I'll explain the context. The inner product `(ϕ, D_ϕ)` is directly related to the action `S[ϕ]` for a free, neutral scalar field, which appears in the exponent of the functional integral for the partition function `Z`. Specifically, `S[ϕ] = (1/2) * (ϕ, D_ϕ)`.\n2.  I will then provide the expression for this inner product in its two common representations: position space and momentum space.\n3.  The Python code will print these mathematical expressions in a structured way. To satisfy the requirement of outputting \"each number in the final equation,\" the script will explicitly print the numerical coefficients and powers found in these physics formulas.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef display_scalar_inner_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and displays the inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ)\n    for a neutral scalar field in finite-temperature field theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The inner product (ϕ, D_ϕ) is a key component of the action S[ϕ] for a free scalar field.\")\n    print(\"The action is S[ϕ] = (1/2) * (ϕ, D_ϕ), and it appears in the partition function Z = ∫ Dϕ exp(-S[ϕ]).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    print(\"1.
