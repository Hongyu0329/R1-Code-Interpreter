    "This is a historical question rather than a computational one. I will find the answer from my knowledge base and present it to you using a Python script as requested. My plan is to store the answer in a variable and then use a print statement to display it.\n\n```python\n# This script will reveal the true profession of Andre Vernault.\n# The information is based on historical records from World War II counterintelligence.\n\n# Define the profession in a variable.\ntrue_profession = \"a pimp\"\n\n# Print the answer in a full sentence.\nprint(f\"Andre Vernault's true profession, which he concealed out of shame, was that of {true_profession}.\")\n```\n<<<a pimp>>>"
