    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the physical principle:** The number of gapless, chiral edge states at an interface between two different topological phases (in this case, Chern insulators) is determined by the difference in their topological invariants (their Chern numbers).\n2.  **Define the variables:** We have two Chern insulators. Let's call their Chern numbers C1 and C2.\n    *   C1 = 1\n    *   C2 = 1\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** The number of edge states at the junction, which we can call C_junction, is given by the formula: C_junction = C1 - C2.\n4.  **Calculate the result:** Substitute the values into the formula to find the Chern number of the junction.\n5.  **Write the Python code:** Create a script that defines the variables, performs the calculation, and prints the full equation and the final answer in a clear format.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# Step 1: Define the Chern numbers for the two insulators.\n# According to the problem description, both have a Chern number of 1.\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the number of chiral edge states at the junction.\n# The number of protected chiral edge states at the interface between two\n# Chern insulators is given by the difference of their individual Chern numbers.\n# This value can be thought of as the effective Chern number of the junction.\njunction_chern_number = chern_number_1 - chern_number_2\n\n# Step 3: Print the result in the form of an equation.\n# The output will show the calculation step-by-step with the final answer.\nprint(\"The effective Chern number of the junction is calculated as the difference between the Chern numbers of the two insulators.\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = C1 - C2\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = {chern_number_1} - {chern_number_2}\")\nprint(f\"C_junction = {junction_chern_number}\")\n\n# A result of 0 means the interface is trivial (gapped) and supports no protected chiral edge modes.\n```\n<<<0>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
