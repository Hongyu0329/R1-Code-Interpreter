    "This is a knowledge-based question. My plan is to first identify the specific verses (bayts) in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets. Then, I will write a Python script that presents this information clearly.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Establish the starting and ending verse numbers for the list of prophets in the poem.\n2.  Create a Python script to display this range.\n3.  The script will store the text of the relevant verses.\n4.  It will then print an introductory sentence stating the range.\n5.  Following the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will explicitly print the range in an equation-like format.\n6.  Finally, the script will loop through the identified range and print each verse number along with its text (in Arabic and with transliteration) for completeness.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses_in_aqeedah():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the verses in Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The names of the prophets are mentioned in a specific range of verses (bayts).\n    # Numbering can vary slightly by publication, but this is the most common arrangement.\n    start_bayt = 46\n    end_bayt = 49\n\n    verses = {\n        46: \"هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودٌ مَعْ ... صَالِحْ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ\\n(Translation/Transliteration: They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with...
