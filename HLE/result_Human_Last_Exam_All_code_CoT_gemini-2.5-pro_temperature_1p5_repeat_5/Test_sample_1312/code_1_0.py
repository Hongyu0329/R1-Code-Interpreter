        'C': "Transposable elements are often mutagenic and are not a reliable compensatory mechanism; they are more often a source of genetic damage.",
        'D': "Multigene families, created by gene duplication, provide redundancy. If one gene copy accumulates a deleterious mutation, other functional copies can compensate. This directly counteracts Muller's Ratchet, the primary cause of genetic deterioration in the absence of recombination. Gene conversion within these families also acts as a repair/homogenization mechanism. This is a well-supported hypothesis.",
