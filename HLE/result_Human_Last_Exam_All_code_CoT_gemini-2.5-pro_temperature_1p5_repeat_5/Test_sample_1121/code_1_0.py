# Part 1: Simulation of a distance-3 universal quantum computer
# A classical simulation of a quantum computer is a classical algorithm.
# The simulation software itself does not use quantum gates (Clifford or non-Clifford).
# The non-Clifford gates are part of the quantum algorithm being simulated, but the
# classical machine running the simulation requires 0 of them to perform its task.
gates_d3_simulation = 0

# Part 2: Implementation of a distance-5 universal quantum computer
# This requires creating high-fidelity logical non-Clifford gates through magic state distillation.
# We calculate the number of raw, noisy T-gates needed to produce one logical T-gate
# with a very low error rate.

# --- Parameters ---
# Physical gate error rate
p_phys = 0.01
# Surface code distance
d = 5
# Target error rate for a single logical T-gate in a universal quantum computer
target_logical_error = 1e-15
# The distillation protocol consumes 15 input states to produce 1 output state.
distillation_ratio = 15
# The error rate of the 15-to-1 distillation protocol is p_out ~ 35 * (p_in)^3
error_formula_coeff = 35

# --- Calculation ---
# The initial error of a T-state produced using physical gates on a distance-d patch
# is approximately d * p_phys.
initial_error = d * p_phys

# We will perform rounds of distillation until the error is below the target.
