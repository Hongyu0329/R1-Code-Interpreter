    "My plan is to use a Python script to solve this biological knowledge question.\nFirst, I will create a data structure (a dictionary) to store my knowledge about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies). For each answer choice, this structure will hold the food item, a true/false value indicating if it's a known food source, and a brief explanation for that conclusion. I will pay special attention to details like the geographical distribution of the insects and plants mentioned.\n\nNext, the script will iterate through this data, printing the analysis for each choice (A, B, C, D, E) to determine which are correct.\n\nFinally, based on the analysis of the individual options, the script will evaluate the combined options (F and G) and print the final, most accurate answer. To satisfy the prompt's instruction to \"output each number in the final equation,\" I will explicitly show that the correct choices are A and E, which combine to make F the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the diet of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the known diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    \n    # A dictionary to store the analysis of each food source.\n    # Key: The letter choice.\n    # Value: A tuple containing (Food Item, Is Correct, Reason).\n    diet_analysis = {\n        'A': (\"Nectar\", True, \"Adult Raphidiopterans are known to feed on nectar as a source of carbohydrates.\"),\n        'B': (\"Māhoe pollen\", False, \"Raphidiopterans do not live in New Zealand, where the Māhoe tree is native.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
