    Solves the term-rewriting system completion task.
    
    The user provided a term-rewriting system and a term ordering (LPO with f<g<h)
    that are inconsistent. The completion algorithm cannot start with the given inputs.

    This solution proceeds under the assumption of a corrected signature ordering 'f > h > g',
    which makes the initial system valid and is a common setup for this problem.
    The steps of the Knuth-Bendix completion algorithm are then carried out.
