    The question refers to an "existentially forgeable digital signature scheme" and names ECDSA as an example. This phrasing is tricky because ECDSA is designed to be "existentially UNforgeable" under chosen message attacks (EUF-CMA). This security property means an attacker cannot forge a signature for a NEW message.

    However, standard ECDSA is "malleable." Given a valid signature (r, s) for a message m, anyone can compute a second, different, valid signature (r, -s mod n) for the very same message m. This means ECDSA is not "Strongly Unforgeable" (SUF-CMA), as a strong forgery attack is successful if the adversary produces any new message-signature pair, even for a message that has been signed before.

    Therefore, the most logical interpretation of "existentially forgeable" in this context is that the scheme is not strongly unforgeable, like ECDSA. We will assume the scheme is secure against forgeries on new messages but not on already-signed messages.

    A. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can create a new, different signature sig' that is verifiable given pk with no more than negligible probability.
    
    This is FALSE. Due to ECDSA's malleability, an adversary can create a new signature for the same message with a probability of 1 (certainty), which is not a negligible probability.

    B. For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.
    
    This is TRUE. The fundamental security of any public-key scheme like ECDSA relies on the computational difficulty of recovering the secret key (sk) from public information. This is based on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). If the secret key could be easily found, the entire system would be broken. This statement correctly describes this core security assumption.

    C. For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.
    
    This is FALSE. This describes a "universal forgery," where an attacker can sign a specific message of their choice. A scheme that is secure against existential forgery (for new messages) must also be secure against this stronger type of attack. ECDSA is designed to prevent universal forgeries.

    D. For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.

    This is FALSE. The statement claims this property for "all" schemes. However, some signature schemes, particularly some based on RSA, are designed with "message recovery," where part or all of the message can be recovered from the signature itself. Therefore, this is not a universal property of all signature schemes.
