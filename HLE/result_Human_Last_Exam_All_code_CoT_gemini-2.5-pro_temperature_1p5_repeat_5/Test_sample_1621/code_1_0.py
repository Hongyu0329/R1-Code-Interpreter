# The problem asks for the number of natural numbers n for which
# there exist n real n-by-n matrices with a specific property.
# Based on deep results in mathematics (the Adams-Atiyah theorem on vector fields on spheres,
# which is related to the existence of real division algebras), the possible dimensions n
# for which this property holds are 1, 2, 4, and 8.

# The set of values for n that satisfy the condition.
n_values = [1, 2, 4, 8]

# The question is "For how many natural numbers n...".
# This is the count of the elements in the set above.
count = len(n_values)

print("The natural numbers n for which such matrices exist are:")
# Output each number in the set of solutions
print(n_values[0])
print(n_values[1])
print(n_values[2])
print(n_values[3])

print("\nThe total count of such natural numbers is:")
print(count)
