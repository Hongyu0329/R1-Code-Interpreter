    "To find the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Wallpaper Groups and Their Point Groups:** There are 17 wallpaper groups, each associated with one of the 10 possible 2D crystallographic point groups.\n2.  **Determine Point Group Order:** The \"order\" of a group is the number of symmetry operations it contains. We are interested in point groups with exactly two operations: the identity operation and one other (either a 180Â° rotation or a reflection).\n3.  **Filter and Count:** We will list all 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their corresponding point group. Then, we'll filter this list to find only those where the point group order is 2 and count them.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this task by:\n*   Using a dictionary to store the 17 wallpaper groups and the order of their point groups.\n*   Iterating through the dictionary to find the groups that match our criteria.\n*   Printing the names of the matching groups and the final count.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and displays the number of wallpaper groups\n    that have a point group of a specific order.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping each of the 17 wallpaper groups to the order\n    # of its corresponding crystallographic point group.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1': 1,\n        'p2': 2,\n        'pm': 2,\n        'pg': 2,\n        'cm': 2,\n        'p2mm': 4,\n        'p2mg': 4,\n        'p2gg': 4,\n        'c2mm': 4,\n        'p4': 4,\n        'p4mm': 8,\n        'p4gm': 8,\n        'p3': 3,\n        'p3m1': 6,\n        'p31m': 6,\n        'p6': 6,\n        'p6mm': 12\n    }\n\n    target_order = 2\n    found_groups = []\n\n    # Iterate through the dictionary to find groups with the target point group order\n    for group, order in wallpaper_group_data.items():\n        if order == target_order:\n            found_groups.append(group)\n\n    print(f\"The wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order} are:\")\n    for group in found_groups:\n        print(f\"- {group}\")\n\n    count = len(found_groups)\n    \n    # Create an equation string showing each group counted as '1'\n    equation_parts = ['1'] * count\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(f\"\\nFinal count calculation: {equation_str} = {count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
