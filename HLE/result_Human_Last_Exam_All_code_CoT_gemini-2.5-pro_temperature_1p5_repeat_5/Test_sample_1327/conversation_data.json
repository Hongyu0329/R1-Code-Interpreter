    "To solve this number sequence problem, I will first identify the underlying pattern connecting the numbers.\n\n**Step-by-step Derivation:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive terms.** Let's assume a pattern of the form `next_number = k * current_number +/- constant`.\n2.  Let's try `k=3`.\n    *   For the second and third terms (11 and 23): `3 * 11 = 33`. To get 23, we must subtract 10. So, `23 = 3 * 11 - 10`.\n    *   For the third and fourth terms (23 and 51): `3 * 23 = 69`. To get 51, we must subtract 18. So, `51 = 3 * 23 - 18`.\n    *   For the fourth and fifth terms (51 and 119): `3 * 51 = 153`. To get 119, we must subtract 34. So, `119 = 3 * 51 - 34`.\n3.  **Identify the pattern in the subtracted numbers.** The sequence of numbers we subtract is `10, 18, 34`.\n4.  **Find the pattern within this new sequence.**\n    *   The difference between 18 and 10 is `8`.\n    *   The difference between 34 and 18 is `16`.\n    *   The differences themselves (`8, 16`) are in a geometric progression, doubling each time (`8 * 2 = 16`).\n5.  **Predict the next term in the pattern.**\n    *   The next difference should be `16 * 2 = 32`.\n    *   Therefore, the next number to be subtracted is `34 + 32 = 66`.\n6.  **Calculate the final number in the original sequence.**\n    *   The next term is `3 * 119 - 66`.\n    *   `3 * 119 = 357`.\n    *   `357 - 66 = 291`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the next number in the sequence.\n\n```python\n# The given sequence\nsequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n# The first term used in the pattern calculation\na2 = sequence[1] \n# The second term\na3 = sequence[2] \n# The third term\na4 = sequence[3] \n# The last known term\na5 = sequence[4] \n\n# Calculate the sequence of subtracted numbers (c_n)\nc3 = 3 * a2 - a3\nc4 = 3 * a3 - a4\nc5 = 3 * a4 - a5\n\n# Calculate the differences in the c_n sequence\ndiff1 = c4 - c3\ndiff2 = c5 - c4\n\n# Predict the next difference (doubles each time)\nnext_diff = diff2 * 2\n\n# Predict the next subtracted number\nnext_c = c5 + next_diff\n\n# Calculate the next term in the main sequence\nnext_term = 3 * a5 - next_c\n\n# Output the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"The pattern is a(n) = 3 * a(n-1) - c(n), where c(n) follows its own pattern.\")\nprint(f\"The sequence of subtracted numbers starts with: {c3}, {c4}, {c5}, ...\")\nprint(f\"The differences in this sequence are {diff1}, {diff2}, ... which double each time.\")\nprint(f\"The next difference is {diff2} * 2 = {next_diff}.\")\nprint(f\"So the next number to subtract is {c5} + {next_diff} = {next_c}.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"{3} * {a5} - {next_c} = {next_term}\")\n```\n<<<A>>>"
