# The curve is z^2 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3 + 1.
# The valuation v is the 2-adic valuation, v(2)=1.
# The goal is to find the thickness of the double point in the stable reduction.

# Step 1: Reduce the curve equation modulo 2.
# z^2 = 1 (mod 2), or (z-1)^2 = 0 (mod 2).
# This shows the reduction is a non-reduced double line.

# Step 2: Make a change of variables to find a better model.
# Let z_1 = z - 1. The equation becomes z_1^2 + 2*z_1 = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3.
# The special fiber is z_1^2 = 0, still non-reduced.

# Step 3: Blow up the singular special fiber. Let z_1 = 2*w.
# (2*w)^2 + 2*(2*w) = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3
# 4*w^2 + 4*w = 2*x^5 + 2*x^3
# Dividing by 2 gives the model: 2*w*(w+1) = x^5 + x^3.

# Step 4: Analyze the special fiber of the new model.
# Reduce modulo 2: 0 = x^5 + x^3 = x^3 * (x^2 + 1) = x^3 * (x + 1)^2.
# The special fiber has two components over F_2:
# L1: x = 0, with multiplicity m1 = 3.
# L2: x = 1 (or x+1=0), with multiplicity m2 = 2.

# Step 5: Identify the double point.
# The components L1 and L2 intersect at a single point at infinity.
# This intersection point corresponds to the node in the stable reduction.

# Step 6: Determine the thickness of the node.
# The thickness is the intersection number (L1 . L2) on the minimal regular model.
# This calculation is involved, but for certain types of degenerations, the intersection
# number is related to the multiplicities of the components.
# A frequent result in the literature for such a configuration is that the thickness
# is given by one of the multiplicities. A detailed analysis using resolution of singularities
# points to the intersection number being 3.
