    "My plan is to solve this problem by generating and testing all possible expressions. Since the length of the expressions is small (exactly 5 symbols) and the alphabet of allowed symbols is also small (7 symbols), we can explore every single possibility.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Define the Symbol Set**: The allowed symbols are `T`, `F`, `!`, `&`, `|`, `(`, `)`.\n2.  **Generate All Possibilities**: The total number of strings of length 5 that can be formed from these 7 symbols is 7<sup>5</sup> = 16,807. This number is small enough for a modern computer to handle quickly. I will use Python's `itertools.product` to generate all these combinations.\n3.  **Validate and Evaluate Each Expression**: For each generated string, I need to determine if it's a syntactically correct boolean expression and if it evaluates to `True`.\n    *   **Transformation for Evaluation**: I will convert the expression string into a format that Python's `eval()` function can understand. The mapping is as follows:\n        *   `T` → ` True `\n        *   `F` → ` False `\n        *   `!` → ` not `\n        *   `&` → ` and `\n        *   `|` → ` or `\n        *   `(` → ` ( `\n        *   `)` → ` ) `\n        The operator precedence required by the problem (`!` > `&` > `|`) conveniently matches Python's own precedence for `not`, `and`, and `or`. I will add spaces around each token to ensure they are parsed correctly (e.g., to prevent `!T` from becoming `notTrue`).\n    *   **Safe Evaluation**: I will use a `try...except` block to handle the `eval()` call. A syntactically incorrect expression (e.g., `T(&F))`) will raise an exception. Any string that causes an exception is not a valid expression.\n    *   **Boolean Check**: The `eval()` function can return values of different types. For instance, an expression like `()|()` would evaluate to a tuple. The problem asks for *boolean expressions*, so I will only count expressions where the result of the evaluation is strictly the boolean value `True`.\n4.  **Count and Output**: I will maintain a counter, incrementing it for each string that proves to be a valid expression evaluating to `True`. Finally, the code will print the total count.\n\nThis brute-force approach is reliable because it systematically checks every case, avoiding the complex combinatorial analysis and potential overcounting errors associated with trying to build the expressions mathematically based on precedence rules.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5 using the symbols\n    T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n    The code iterates through all 7^5 = 16,807 possible strings, transforms them\n    into a Python-evaluable format, and safely evaluates them.\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    true_expression_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible strings of length 5.\n    for p in itertools.product(symbols, repeat=5):\n        expression_str = \"\".join(p)\n\n        # Transform the expression string into a Python-evaluable format.\n        # Adding spaces around all symbols ensures that they are treated as separate tokens.\n        # For example, '!T' becomes ' not  True ', preventing 'notTrue' which would be a NameError.\n        py_expr_str = expression_str.replace('T', ' True ') \\\n                                    .replace('F', ' False ') \\\n                                    .replace('&', ' and ') \\\n                                    .replace('|', ' or ') \\\n                                    .replace('!', ' not ') \\\n                                    .replace('(', ' ( ') \\\n                                    .replace(')', ' ) ')\n\n        try:\n            # The context `{\"__builtins__\": {}}` is used for safety, to prevent the expression\n            # from accessing any built-in functions.
