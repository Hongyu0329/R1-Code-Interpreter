    "To find the total welfare, we must first determine the market equilibrium, then calculate the consumer and producer surplus at that equilibrium point. The sum of these two surpluses gives us the total welfare.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find Market Equilibrium (Qe, Pe):** The market is in equilibrium when the supply price equals the demand price. We will solve the equation `Supply(Q) = Demand(Q)` to find the equilibrium quantity, `Qe`.\n    *   `ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18 * e^(-arctan(Q))`\n    Since this equation is complex and cannot be solved algebraically, we will use a numerical solver in Python to find the value of `Qe`.\n    Once `Qe` is found, we can substitute it back into either the supply or demand function to find the equilibrium price, `Pe`.\n\n2.  **Calculate Consumer Surplus (CS):** Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve above the equilibrium price. It is calculated by the integral:\n    *   `CS = ∫[from 0 to Qe] (Demand(Q) dQ) - (Pe * Qe)`\n\n3.  **Calculate Producer Surplus (PS):** Producer surplus is the area above the supply curve below the equilibrium price. The supply function `P = ln(Q^3 - 2)` is only defined for `Q > ∛2`. Thus, the integral for producer surplus will have a lower bound of `∛2`.\n    *   `PS = (Pe * Qe) - ∫[from ∛2 to Qe] (Supply(Q) dQ)`\n\n4.  **Calculate Total Welfare (TW):** Total welfare is the sum of consumer and producer surplus.\n    *   `TW = CS + PS`\n\nWe will implement this plan using Python's `scipy` library for numerical solving and integration.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import root_scalar\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total welfare by finding market equilibrium,\n    consumer surplus, and producer surplus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
