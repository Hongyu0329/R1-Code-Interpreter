# The problem is analytical and asks for a limit, which can be determined through reasoning rather than simulation.
# Based on the step-by-step reasoning, the conditions required for infinitely many visits 
# occur only in very specific random environments. 
# The probability of realizing such an environment vanishes as the parameter h approaches 0.
# Therefore, the limit of the probability is 0.

# Let's formalize the final result as a simple program printing the numerical answer.

# Problem parameters are not used in the final code as the result is derived from mathematical reasoning.
# h: probability of a site being red / probability of branching
# p_red = [4/5, 1/5] # [P(left), P(right)]
# p_blue = [1/5, 4/5]
# start_pos = 3
# target_site = 0

# The reasoning leads to the conclusion that for almost any environment configuration, 
# the process is "subcritical" at site 0, meaning visits to site 0 will eventually die out.
# The set of environment configurations that are "supercritical" has a probability measure that
# tends to 0 as h -> 0.
# Therefore, the limit of the probability is 0.

final_answer = 0

# The question asks to output the final equation. 
# Since the result is a limit, we can represent this as:
# lim_{h->0} P(E) = 0
# where E is the event "site 0 is visited by infinitely many different particles".
# To follow the instruction "output each number in the final equation", 
# we print the resulting number.
print("The equation is: lim_{h->0} P(E) = 0")
print("The final numerical answer is:")
