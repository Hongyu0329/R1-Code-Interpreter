def solve_inscribed_square_construction():
    """
    This function prints the shortest command sequence to construct a square inscribed in a circle.

    The sequence is derived from the following geometric steps:
    1. L: Draw a line through the center and the given point to create the first diameter.
    2. C: Draw a circle from one end of the diameter to the other.
    3. C: Draw a second circle from the other end of the diameter back to the first.
       (These two circles create the points for the perpendicular bisector).
    4. L: Draw the perpendicular bisector, which forms the second diameter.
    5. LLLL: Connect the four vertices on the circle to form the square.
