    "This is a knowledge-based question about the 1972 film *Solaris*. My plan is to identify the character based on a key scene and character arc from the movie. I will then create a simple Python script to present this information and determine the correct answer from the provided choices.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The question asks to identify a specific character from Andrei Tarkovsky's *Solaris* based on an emotional detail: being ashamed for not missing the sound of rustling leaves.\n2.  **Recall movie plot and themes:** The film's protagonist is the psychologist Kris Kelvin. His journey to the space station is one of deep introspection about his humanity, his past, and his connection to Earth. The other characters are either scientists focused on the Solaris phenomenon (Snaut, Sartorius), deceased (Gibarian), or a non-human \"guest\" (Hari).\n3.  **Identify the character:** The sentiment of feeling shame for becoming detached from earthly sensations is central to Kris Kelvin's character arc. It is he who expresses this specific form of homesickness and self-reproach.\n4.  **Match with choices:** Kris corresponds to option A.\n5.  **Construct the script:** The Python code will define the choices, identify \"Kris\" as the correct character, and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves a trivia question about the 1972 movie \"Solaris\".\n    It identifies the character who expressed shame for not missing the sound of leaves.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The list of characters provided as choices.\n    answer_choices = {\n        'A': 'Kris',\n        'B': 'Hari',\n        'C': 'Snaut',\n        'D': 'Sartorius',\n        'E': 'Gibarian'\n    }\n\n    # Based on analysis of the film's plot and characters, the protagonist,\n    # Kris Kelvin, is the one who has a moment of profound existential reflection.\n    # He realizes with shame that he has become so detached from his life on Earth\n    # that he no longer misses simple, natural things like the rustling of leaves.\n    correct_character = 'Kris'\n\n    # Find the corresponding letter for the final answer.\n    final_answer_letter = None\n    for letter, character_name in answer_choices.items():\n        if character_name == correct_character:\n            final_answer_letter = letter\n            break\n\n    print(f\"The character in 'Solaris' (1972) who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling is {correct_character}.\")\n    print(f\"This corresponds to answer choice {final_answer_letter}.\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
