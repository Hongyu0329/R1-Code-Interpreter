6.  **Final Review:** The explanation is logical, the code is simple and directly supports the argument, and it follows all the user's instructions. The final answer, "D. The measured activity of the source (1 kBq)," is well-supported. I will now generate the final response.

To determine the dominant factor for the required time resolution, we need to identify the process that sets the timescale for separating one measurement from the next.

**Plan:**
1.  Analyze the meaning of "individually measure the electrons." This refers to distinguishing electrons originating from different decay events.
2.  The frequency of these decay events is given by the source's activity. We will calculate the average time between two consecutive decay events based on the given activity of 1 kBq.
3.  Compare this average time to other timescales in the experiment, such as the time it takes for an electron to travel from the source to the detector (time-of-flight).
4.  Conclude which factor is "dominant" by seeing which one sets the largest time constraint that must be overcome. The Python script below will calculate this key timescale.
