    print("\n1. Analyzing the Reactants:")
    print("  - Ligand (L): 2,5-di(2-pyridyl)thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole is a symmetric, rigid, tetradentate ligand, meaning it binds to a metal at four sites (the four nitrogen atoms).")
    print("  - Metal Complex: cis-dichlorobis(bipyridine)ruthenium(II), or cis-[Ru(bpy)2Cl2], is an octahedral Ru(II) complex with a coordination number of 6.")

    # Step 2: Determine the reaction product
    print("\n2. Determining the Reaction Product:")
    print("  - The reaction is a ligand substitution where the tetradentate ligand (L) replaces other ligands on the Ruthenium center.")
    print("  - To maintain a stable octahedral geometry (coordination number 6), the tetradentate ligand (L) must replace ligands that occupy four coordination sites.")
    print("  - The most plausible product is formed when L replaces one bidentate bipyridine (bpy) ligand and the two monodentate chloride (Cl) ligands.")
    print("  - The resulting product is [Ru(L)(bpy)]^2+.")

    # Step 3: Analyze the isomerism of the product
    print("\n3. Analyzing the Isomerism of the Product [Ru(L)(bpy)]^2+:")
    print("  - This product is an octahedral complex of the type [M(tetradentate)(bidentate)].")
    print("  - For a linear, symmetric tetradentate ligand like L, there are two main potential geometric isomers, known as cis-α and cis-β, based on how the ligand wraps around the metal.")
    print("  - For this specific rigid ligand system, the cis-α isomer is sterically favored and is the one observed to form.")
    print("  - The cis-α geometric isomer is chiral (it is not superimposable on its mirror image).")
    print("  - Chiral molecules exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images called enantiomers.")

    # Step 4: Count the isomers formed
    print("\n4. Conclusion on the Number of Isomers:")
    print("  - Since the cis-α product is chiral, it exists as two distinct enantiomers.")
    print("  - The reaction starts with achiral or racemic reactants, so it produces a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of both enantiomers.")
    print("  - Therefore, two different isomers (the pair of enantiomers) are formed in the reaction.")

    # Final answer
    number_of_isomers = 2
    
    print("\n-------------------------------------------")
    print("Final Answer:")
    print("The reaction forms one geometric isomer (cis-α), which exists as a pair of enantiomers.")
    print(f"The total number of isomers formed is: {number_of_isomers}")
