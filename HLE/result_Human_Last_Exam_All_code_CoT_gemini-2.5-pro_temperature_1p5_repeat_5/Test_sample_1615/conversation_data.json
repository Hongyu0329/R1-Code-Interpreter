    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The task is to find the maximum possible value for the chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, of a graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring.\n\n2.  **Find an Upper Bound:** We will use a fundamental theorem from graph theory. For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is at most $n$. The equality, $\\chi(G)=n$, holds true only when the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. The problem explicitly states that our graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph. This means its chromatic number must be strictly less than $n$. Therefore, we can conclude that $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$. For our specific case, this means the maximum number of colors is at most $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n3.  **Show the Upper Bound is Achievable:** To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, we need to show that there exists at least one graph with $n$ vertices (which is not complete) that requires exactly $n-1$ colors.\n\n4.  **Construct an Example Graph:** Let's construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G$ created by taking a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, denoted as $K_{n-1}$, and adding one extra vertex that is completely isolated (not connected to any other vertices).\n    *   **Number of vertices:** This graph has $(n-1) + 1 = n = 12345$ vertices.\n    *   **Is it complete?** No, because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other $n-1$ vertices.\n    *   **What is its chromatic number?** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components. Our graph has two components: the $K_{n-1}$ and the isolated vertex. A complete graph $K_{n-1}$ requires $n-1$ colors. An isolated vertex requires 1 color. The chromatic number of our constructed graph $G$ is therefore $\\max(\\chi(K_{n-1}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(n-1, 1) = n-1$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that any such graph needs at most $n-1$ colors, and we have constructed a specific graph that needs exactly $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices, given it is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n    \n    # According to graph theory, the chromatic number chi(G) of any graph with n\n    # vertices is at most n.
