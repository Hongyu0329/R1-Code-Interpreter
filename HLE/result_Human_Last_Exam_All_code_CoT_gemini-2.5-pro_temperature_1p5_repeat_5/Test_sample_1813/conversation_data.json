    "To solve this problem, we need to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)**: The theory of the Markov spectrum associates a value \\( m_{p/q} \\) with each rational number \\( p/q \\). A symmetry property states that \\( m_{p/q} = m_{(q-p)/q} \\). Therefore, \\( m_{4/7} = m_{(7-4)/7} = m_{3/7} \\). We will work with \\( 3/7 \\) as it fits the standard convention \\( 0 < p/q < 1/2 \\).\n\n2.  **Find the continued fraction of the rational number**: The continued fraction of \\( 3/7 \\) is:\n    \\( \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{1}{7/3} = \\frac{1}{2 + 1/3} = [0; 2, 3] \\).\n    So we have \\( n=2, a_1=2, a_2=3 \\).\n\n3.  **Relate \\( m_{p/q} \\) to a simpler algebraic number**: The theory, for instance as detailed in Aigner's book \"Markov's Theorem and 100 Years of the Uniqueness Conjecture\", relates \\( m_{p/q} \\) to a quadratic integer \\(\\lambda_{p/q}\\) via the equation \\( m_{p/q}^2 = 2\\lambda_{p/q} + 5 \\). This \\(\\lambda_{p/q}\\) is the largest root of a specific quadratic equation whose coefficients depend on the continued fraction of \\(p/q\\).\n\n4.  **Determine the quadratic equation for \\(\\lambda_{3/7}\\)**: The polynomial for \\(\\lambda\\) is \\(x^2 - Tx + D = 0\\), where:\n    *   \\( T = k_{n-1}k'_{n-1} + k_{n-1}^2 - 2 \\)\n    *   \\( D = (k'_{n-1})^2 - 1 \\)\n    Here, \\(k_j\\) is the denominator of the \\(j\\)-th convergent of \\(p/q=[0;a_1, \\dots, a_n]\\), and \\(k'_j\\) is the denominator of the \\(j\\)-th convergent of the \"reversed\" continued fraction \\([0; a_n, \\dots, a_1]\\).\n\n    For \\( p/q = 3/7 = [0; 2, 3] \\), \\(n=2\\). We need \\( k_1 \\) and \\( k'_1 \\).\n    *   The first convergent of \\([0; 2, 3]\\) is \\([0;2]=1/2\\). So, \\( k_1 = 2 \\).\n    *   The reversed continued fraction is \\([0; 3, 2]\\). Its first convergent is \\([0;3]=1/3\\). So, \\( k'_1 = 3 \\).\n\n    Now we compute \\(T\\) and \\(D\\):\n    *   \\( T = (2)(3) + 2^2 - 2 = 6 + 4 - 2 = 8 \\)\n    *   \\( D = 3^2 - 1 = 8 \\)\n\n    So, \\(\\lambda\\) is the largest root of \\(x^2 - 8x + 8 = 0\\).\n\n5.  **Solve for \\(\\lambda_{3/7}\\)**: Using the quadratic formula, the roots are \\( x = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{8 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{2} = 4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2} \\). The largest root is \\(\\lambda_{3/7} = 4 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n6.  **Determine the \"associated continued fraction\"**: The number \\(m_{4/7}\\) itself, \\(\\sqrt{13+4\\sqrt{2}}\\), is a higher-degree algebraic number whose continued fraction is not periodic. The phrase \"continued fraction associated with\" most likely refers to the continued fraction of a related, simpler number. The quadratic irrational \\(\\lambda_{4/7}\\) is the most natural candidate, as its continued fraction is periodic and elegant. We will compute the continued fraction of \\(\\lambda_{4/7} = 4 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\).\n\n7.  **Implement the computation**: A Python script will be provided to compute the coefficients of the continued fraction for \\(4 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\) and detect its period. The final instruction \"output each number in the final equation\" is interpreted as printing the coefficients of the continued fraction representation, i.e., \\(a_0, a_1, \\dots\\).\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_cf_quadratic(p0, q0, d):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational of the form (p0 + sqrt(d)) / q0.\n    \n    Args:\n        p0 (int): Initial numerator part.\n        q0 (int): Initial denominator.\n        d (int): The number under the square root.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of coefficients for the continued fraction.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check that d is not a perfect square\n    sqrt_d = math.sqrt(d)\n    if sqrt_d == int(sqrt_d):\n        raise ValueError(\"d must not be a perfect square.\")\n\n    coefficients = []\n    seen_states = {}\n    \n    p = p0\n    q = q0\n    \n    # Limit to prevent infinite loops in case of error, though it should terminate for quadratic irrationals.\n    for _ in range(100):\n        state = (p, q)\n        if state in seen_states:\n            # Period detected\n            start_index = seen_states[state]\n            non_periodic_part = coefficients[:start_index]\n            periodic_part = coefficients[start_index:]\n            \n            print(f\"The continued fraction is periodic.\")\n            # Format the output for the final equation form [a0; a1, ..., (a_k, ...)]\n            if non_periodic_part:\n                print(f\"Non-periodic part: {non_periodic_part}\")\n            print(f\"Periodic part: {periodic_part}\")\n            \n            # Per instruction: \"output each number in the final equation!\"\n            print(\"\\nThe numbers in the final continued fraction equation are:\")\n            all_coeffs = non_periodic_part + periodic_part\n            for coeff in all_coeffs:\n                print(coeff)\n            return\n\n        seen_states[state] = len(coefficients)\n        \n        # Calculate the next coefficient\n        # a_i = floor( (p_i + sqrt(d)) / q_i )\n        a = int((p + sqrt_d) / q)\n        coefficients.append(a)\n        \n        # Update p and q for the next iteration\n        # p_{i+1} = a_i * q_i - p_i\n        p_next = a * q - p\n        # q_{i+1} = (d - p_{i+1}^2) / q_i\n        q_next = (d - p_next**2) // q\n        \n        p = p_next\n        q = q_next\n\n    print(\"Could not find period within 100 iterations.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # The number is lambda = 4 + 2*sqrt(2) = 4 + sqrt(8)\n    # We represent it as (p0 + sqrt(d)) / q0\n    p0 = 4\n    d = 8  # 2*sqrt(2) = sqrt(8)\n    q0 = 1\n    \n    print(f\"Computing the continued fraction associated with m_4/7.\")\n    print(f\"This is the continued fraction for lambda_4/7 = 4 + 2*sqrt(2) = (4 + sqrt(8))/1.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    \n    get_cf_quadratic(p0, q0, d)\n\n```\n<<<[6; (1, 4)]>>>"
