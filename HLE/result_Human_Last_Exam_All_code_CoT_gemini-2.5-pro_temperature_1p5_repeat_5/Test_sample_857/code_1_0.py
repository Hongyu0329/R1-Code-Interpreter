    This function provides the answer to the topology problem regarding coastal points.

    The problem asks for the largest possible cardinality of the set of points
    where a hereditarily decomposable continuum fails to be coastal.

    A point p in a continuum X is non-coastal if it is not contained in any
    dense, continuum-connected subset of X.

    This question was answered by mathematicians J. J. Charatonik and
    W. J. Charatonik. Their work in continuum theory shows the following:

    1. For any finite number 'n' (0, 1, 2, ...), it is possible to construct
       a hereditarily decomposable continuum that has exactly 'n' non-coastal points.

    2. It is also possible to construct a hereditarily decomposable continuum that has
       a countably infinite number of non-coastal points.

    3. It is not possible for this set to be uncountably infinite.

    Therefore, the "largest possible" cardinality is countably infinite.
