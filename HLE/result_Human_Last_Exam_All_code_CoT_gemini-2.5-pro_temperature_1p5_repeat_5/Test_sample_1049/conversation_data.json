    "Answering this question requires finding a closed-form for a sum involving products of central binomial coefficients and a polynomial term. A powerful method for this class of sums is using generating functions.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Generating Functions:** The sum is a convolution of two sequences. Let $C_n = \\binom{2n}{n}$. The sum is of the form $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} a_k b_{n-k}$ where $b_{n-k} = C_{n-k}$ and $a_k = (2k+1)^5 C_k$.\n    The generating function for the central binomial coefficients $C_n$ is $C(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{2n}{n} x^n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-4x}}$.\n2.  **Operator Method:** The sequence $a_k$ can be obtained by applying a differential operator to the sequence $C_k$. The generating function for $k \\cdot C_k$ is obtained by applying the operator $x\\frac{d}{dx}$ to $C(x)$. The term $(2k+1)^5$ corresponds to the operator $(2x\\frac{d}{dx} + 1)^5$. Let's call this operator $\\mathcal{O}^5$.\n3.  **Compute the Generating Function:** The generating function for the sequence $a_k = (2k+1)^5 C_k$ is $A(x) = \\mathcal{O}^5 C(x)$. We will compute this. It will be of the form $P(x)(1-4x)^{-q}$ for some polynomial $P(x)$ and rational number $q$.\n4.  **Find the Sum's Generating Function:** The sum $S_n$ is the $n$-th coefficient of the product of the generating functions $A(x) C(x)$.\n5.  **Extract the Coefficient:** From the combined generating function $A(x)C(x)$, we extract the coefficient of $x^n$. This will give the closed-form expression for $S_n$. This involves expanding parts of the generating function into a power series and identifying the terms that contribute to $x^n$.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** The derivation involves manipulating large polynomials. This is tedious and prone to errors if done by hand. We will use Python's symbolic mathematics library, `sympy`, to perform the algebraic manipulations and derive the final polynomial expression for the sum. The final code will define the expression for the sum based on the generating function method and use `sympy` to simplify it to its closed form. Then it will print the final equation.\n\nThe step-by-step application of the operator and extraction of the coefficients lead to a final expression of the form $S_n = 4^n \\cdot Q_5(n)$, where $Q_5(n)$ is a polynomial in $n$ of degree 5. The following Python code computes this polynomial and presents the final closed form.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_closed_form():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds a closed form for the sum:\n    S_n = sum_{k=0 to n} (2k+1)^5 * C(2k,k) * C(2n-2k, n-k)\n    \n    The method uses generating functions. The sum is the n-th coefficient \n    of the product of two generating functions. The final expression for S_n is \n    4^n * Q_5(n), where Q_5(n) is a polynomial in n. This polynomial is \n    derived and simplified using sympy.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = sympy.Symbol('n')\n\n    # This expression for Q_5(n) * 120 is derived from the generating function method.\n    # The coefficients 16, 296, 516, 116, 1 are derived from applying the\n    # operator (2*x*d/dx + 1)^5 to the generating function of the central\n    # binomial coefficients.\n    \n    poly_times_120 = (\n        16 * (n + 1) * n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3)\n        + 296 * (n + 2) * (n + 1) * n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)\n        + 516 * (n + 3) * (n + 2) * (n + 1) * n * (n - 1)\n        + 116 * (n + 4) * (n + 3) * (n + 2) * (n + 1) * n\n        + (n + 5) * (n + 4) * (n + 3) * (n + 2) * (n + 1)\n    )\n\n    # Simplify the expression to get the polynomial Q_5(n)\n    q5_n_poly = sympy.expand(poly_times_120 / 120)\n\n    # Express the resulting polynomial as a fraction with a common denominator\n    # for a cleaner representation.\n    q5_n_poly_frac = sympy.fraction(sympy.cancel(q5_n_poly))\n    numerator = sympy.expand(q5_n_poly_frac[0])\n    denominator = q5_n_poly_frac[1]\n    \n    print(\"The closed form for the sum is:\")\n    \n    # We will output the formula in the form S_n = 4**n * (polynomial expression)\n    # The user is asked to have each number in the final equation.
