    "To determine which curve has good ordinary reduction above 2, we need to analyze the properties of each curve, specifically its model and discriminant. A curve `z^2 = f(x)` has good reduction at a prime `p` (where `p` is not 2) if `p` does not divide the discriminant of the minimal integral model of the polynomial `f(x)`. For a curve to have good reduction for all primes `p > 2`, the discriminant must only have prime factors of 2 (i.e., it's a power of 2).\n\nA special case arises if the polynomial `f(x)` has squared factors. If `f(x) = g(x) * h(x)^2`, the curve `z^2 = f(x)` is singular. However, it is birationally equivalent to the non-singular curve `w^2 = g(x)`, where `w = z / h(x)`. We must analyze this simplified, non-singular model. If this model has genus 0, it is known to have good reduction at all primes.\n\nMy plan is to execute a Python script that performs the following steps for each option:\n1.  Check if the polynomial on the right-hand side has squared factors to find the correct non-singular model.\n2.  Determine the genus of this non-singular model.\n3.  If the genus is 0, the curve has good reduction everywhere.\n4.  If the genus is greater than 0, calculate the discriminant of the polynomial of the non-singular model.\n5.  Factor the discriminant to see if it has any prime factors other than 2. If it does, the curve has bad reduction at those primes and does not meet the condition.\n\nThe script will print the analysis for each option, leading to the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_curve(option_letter, poly, x_symbol):\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a hyperelliptic curve z^2 = poly to determine if it has good\n    reduction for all primes p > 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Option {option_letter}: z^2 = {poly} ---\")\n\n    # 1.
