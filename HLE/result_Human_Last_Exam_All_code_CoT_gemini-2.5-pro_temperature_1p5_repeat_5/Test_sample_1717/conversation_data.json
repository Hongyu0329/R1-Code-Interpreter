    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I will identify the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu boss in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n2.  Next, I will find the health scaling formula used in Expert Mode for multiplayer, according to the game's source code.\n3.  The phrase \"infinite number of players\" is a theoretical concept. However, a game's source code often has practical limits. I will determine the maximum number of players the game's code can actually handle in its calculations.\n4.  Finally, I will use this maximum player count in the health scaling formula to calculate the theoretical maximum health possible within the game's engine.\n5.  I will write a Python script to perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_terraria_boss_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode.\n\n    According to the Terraria source code, boss health in Expert Mode scales with the number of active players.\n    While the user asks for an \"infinite\" number of players, the game's code has a practical limit based on\n    its player array size, which is 255. This script calculates the health based on that limit.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Base health of Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    base_health = 3640\n\n    # 2. The maximum number of players the game's player array can hold.\n    max_players = 255\n\n    # 3. The health scaling formula is: BaseHealth * (1 + 0.35 * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    # We calculate each part of the equation step-by-step.\n\n    players_minus_one = max_players - 1\n    scaling_per_player = 0.35\n    total_scaling_factor = scaling_per_player * players_minus_one\n    final_multiplier = 1 + total_scaling_factor\n    \n    # The game calculates health using floating-point numbers and then casts to an integer.\n    max_health = int(base_health * final_multiplier)\n\n    # 4. Print the full equation and the final answer.\n    print(\"Health Scaling Formula: Base Health * (1 + 0.35 * (Number of Players - 1))\")\n    print(f\"Based on the game's code, the maximum number of players is {max_players}.\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation:\")\n    print(f\"{base_health} * (1 + {scaling_per_player} * ({max_players} - 1))\")\n    print(f\"= {base_health} * (1 + {scaling_per_player} * {players_minus_one})\")\n    print(f\"= {base_health} * (1 + {total_scaling_factor})\")\n    print(f\"= {base_health} * {final_multiplier}\")\n    print(f\"= {max_health}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_terraria_boss_health()\n```\n<<<327236>>>"
