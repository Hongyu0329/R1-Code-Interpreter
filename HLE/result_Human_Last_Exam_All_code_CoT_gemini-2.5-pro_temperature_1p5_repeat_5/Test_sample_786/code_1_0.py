    # This result, by Garg, Vazirani, and Yannakakis, yields an approximation
    # guarantee of O(log k), where k is the number of terminal pairs.

    # It is also known (under the Unique Games Conjecture) that it is NP-hard to
    # approximate Multicut better than a factor of Î©(log k). This means the O(log k)
    # bound is essentially tight. This rules out constant-factor approximations (like in choice A)
    # and stronger-than-logarithmic approximations (like in choice B).

    # calculation implies the use of the natural logarithm (ln).
