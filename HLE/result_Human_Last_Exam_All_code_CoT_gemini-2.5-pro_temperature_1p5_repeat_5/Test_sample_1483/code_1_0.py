# The problem is a theoretical question in point-set topology.
# The reasoning outlined above establishes that for any nondegenerate decomposable continuum,
# the collection of its regular proper subcontinua has a cardinality of at least 2.
# Furthermore, an example exists (the union of two closures of Wada-type domains)
# that demonstrates a cardinality of exactly 2 is achievable.
# Therefore, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.

# There is no equation, so we print the final resulting number.
final_answer = 2
