    Analyzes statements about the junction tree algorithm and identifies the correct ones.
    
    A: False. Approximate inference methods are more efficient for graphs with high treewidth.
    B: False. High treewidth is the primary weakness of the junction tree algorithm.
    C: True. The algorithm manipulates potentials (unnormalized joint distributions) over the cliques (nodes).
    D: False. The premise (resilience to high treewidth) is incorrect.
    E: True. This is the main practical limitation of the algorithm.
    F: False. Identical to D.
    G: True. The reason for the lack of resilience is the need to compute with joint distributions over large cliques, which is exponentially costly.
    H: False. The efficiency diminishes exponentially, not linearly.
    I: True. The computational cost is exponential in the size of the largest clique.
    J: False. Efficiency is highly dependent on the clique size.
    L: True. This is a correct description of the running intersection property.
