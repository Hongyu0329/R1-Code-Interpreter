    This function solves the puzzle about the text on the Steve McQueen watch.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The specific auction mentioned (Sotheby's, Dec 11, 2024) appears to be fictional context for a trivia question.
    2. Steve McQueen's most famous watch is the vintage Heuer Monaco 1133. On that watch, no text appears directly above the date window.
    3. However, on many modern TAG Heuer Monaco re-editions (marketed with the McQueen connection), the word 'Automatic' is printed directly above the date window at the 6 o'clock position.
    4. This is the most likely answer that fits the specific phrasing of the question.
