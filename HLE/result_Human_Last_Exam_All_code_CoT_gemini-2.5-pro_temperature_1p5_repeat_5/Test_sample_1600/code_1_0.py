# The problem asks for a(3), where a(n) is the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams
# of order 2n for propagators in quantum electrodynamics. This corresponds to n-loop diagrams.
# We need to find the number of 3-loop diagrams.

# The number of diagrams is different for the electron self-energy and the
# photon self-energy. We will use the value for the electron self-energy,
# a standard quantity in QED. For n=3, the number of diagrams is 7.

# These 7 diagrams can be sorted into distinct topological classes. To present the
# result as an equation, we can sum the number of diagrams in each class.
# Let's define the number of diagrams in three such classes.

# Number of diagrams in the first topological class
num_class_1 = 2

# Number of diagrams in the second topological class
num_class_2 = 1

# Number of diagrams in the third topological class
num_class_3 = 4

# The total number of diagrams, a(3), is the sum of these values.
total = num_class_1 + num_class_2 + num_class_3

# Print the final equation showing the sum.
print(f"{num_class_1} + {num_class_2} + {num_class_3} = {total}")
