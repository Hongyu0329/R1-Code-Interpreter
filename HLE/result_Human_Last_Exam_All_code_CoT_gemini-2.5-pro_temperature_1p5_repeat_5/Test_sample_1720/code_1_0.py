# The user wants me to solve a medical reasoning question.
# I need to analyze the patient's condition and select the best treatment combination.

# Patient analysis:
# - Signs of shock: BP 90/60, HR 100.
# - Signs of severe systemic illness/sepsis: Necrotic tissue, failure of PO meds, high respiratory rate (40).
# - Root cause: Widespread necrotic tissue due to compromised venous return. This dead tissue is a source of infection and toxins.

# Treatment evaluation:
# - Intravenous (IV) Medication (B) is essential because oral medications have failed and the condition is systemic. This will likely include broad-spectrum antibiotics.
# - Surgical debridement (C) is essential for "source control." The necrotic tissue is the engine driving the patient's decline. It must be physically removed to stop the progression of the illness.
# - Intravenous (IV) fluid (A) is also essential for resuscitating the patient from shock.
# - High-flow O2 (E) is not a priority as SpO2 is 98%.
# - Chemical debridement (D) is too slow for this life-threatening emergency.

# Evaluating the combinations:
# - The patient requires resuscitation, systemic medication, and source control.
# - Option F (A & B) provides resuscitation and medication but lacks source control. The patient will not improve without removing the necrotic tissue.
# - Option G (B & C) provides systemic medication and definitive source control. This combination addresses the root cause of the disease. While fluid resuscitation (A) must happen concurrently, B & C represent the core therapeutic plan to reverse the illness.
# - Option H (C & E) misses the critical elements of fluid resuscitation and systemic antibiotics.

# Conclusion: The most critical and definitive treatment combination offered is treating the systemic infection with IV medication (B) and removing the source of the infection with surgery (C).

print("Based on the patient's presentation of shock and widespread necrosis, the definitive treatment requires addressing the systemic infection and removing the source.")
print("B. Intravenous medication is required to treat the systemic effects, as oral medications have failed.")
print("C. Surgical debridement of necrotic sites is required for source control, as the dead tissue is the engine of the septic process.")
print("Therefore, the combination of intravenous medication and surgical debridement is the most critical treatment plan.")
print("The answer is G.")
