    "To calculate the rule activation level of a fuzzy rule, we need to combine the membership degrees of the antecedent parts using a t-norm operation. A t-norm acts as a fuzzy logic 'AND' operator. While there are several types of t-norms (like product, Łukasiewicz, etc.), the most common and standard one is the minimum t-norm.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1.  Define the two given membership values, `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm, which means finding the minimum of these two values.\n3.  Print the full equation showing the inputs and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Define the given membership values\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm is a fuzzy 'AND' operation. The most common t-norm is the minimum function.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm to calculate the rule activation level.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G)\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using a t-norm (minimum) operation.\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
