    print("Step 2: Understanding the stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction")
    print("For an E2 reaction to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H on an adjacent carbon) must be anti-periplanar.")

    print("However, for the E2 reaction to happen, the molecule must adopt its less stable conformation where both groups are axial, so that the Br is axial.\n")

    print("Since elimination only occurs between C1 and C6, a single product is formed.")
