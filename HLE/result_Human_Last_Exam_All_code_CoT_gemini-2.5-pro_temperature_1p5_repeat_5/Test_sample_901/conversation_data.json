    "To determine the product of the reaction between (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide, we need to analyze the reaction mechanism, which is an E2 elimination. The outcome is dictated by the specific stereochemistry of the starting material.\n\nHere is my plan for solving this:\n1.  **Identify the reaction type:** A secondary alkyl halide treated with a strong, bulky base (potassium tert-butoxide) will undergo an E2 elimination reaction.\n2.  **Analyze the stereochemical requirements:** The E2 mechanism on a cyclohexane ring requires the leaving group (bromine) and a beta-hydrogen (a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon) to be in an anti-periplanar (diaxial) arrangement.\n3.  **Analyze the substrate's conformations:** The substrate, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, is a `trans` isomer. It can exist as two chair conformers: one with both groups equatorial (more stable) and one with both groups axial (less stable).\n4.  **Determine the reactive conformer:** The E2 reaction cannot happen from the more stable diequatorial conformer because the leaving group is not axial. The reaction must proceed through the less stable, but reactive, diaxial conformer.\n5.  **Identify possible elimination pathways:** In the diaxial conformer, we will look for beta-hydrogens that are axial.\n    *   The hydrogen on C2 is equatorial, so elimination toward C2 is not possible.\n    *   The hydrogen on C6 is axial, so elimination toward C6 is possible.\n6.  **Name the product:** Based on the only possible elimination pathway, we will determine the structure of the resulting alkene and name it according to IUPAC rules.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that carries out this logical deduction and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef identify_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the product of the reaction between\n    (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane and potassium tert-butoxide\n    by applying the principles of organic chemistry.\n    \"\"\"\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    base = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n\n    print(f\"Reaction analysis for: {substrate} + {base}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identifying the reaction mechanism\")\n    print(\"The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide, and the reagent is a strong, bulky base.\")\n    print(\"These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Understanding the stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction\")\n    print(\"For an E2 reaction to occur on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen (H on an adjacent carbon) must be anti-periplanar.\")\n    print(\"This means they must both be in axial positions, with one pointing up and the other down.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyzing the substrate's conformation\")\n    print(f\"The substrate, {substrate}, has a 'trans' relationship between the bromo and methyl groups.\")\n    print(\"It primarily exists in a stable conformation where both bulky groups are equatorial.\")\n    print(\"However, for the E2 reaction to happen, the molecule must adopt its less stable conformation where both groups are axial, so that the Br is axial.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Evaluating the possible elimination pathways from the reactive (diaxial) conformer\")\n    print(\"In the reactive conformer, the Bromine is axial at C1 and the methyl group is axial at C2.\")\n    print(\"We check the two adjacent carbons (beta-carbons) for an axial hydrogen:\")\n    print(\"  - Elimination towards C2: At C2, the methyl group is axial, so the hydrogen on C2 is equatorial.
