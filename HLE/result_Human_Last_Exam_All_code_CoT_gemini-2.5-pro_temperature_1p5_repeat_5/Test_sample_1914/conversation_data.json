    "To solve this problem, we need to systematically enumerate all possible category structures with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, and then count how many of them are non-isomorphic.\n\n### My thinking process\n1.  **Deconstruct the Category**: A category is defined by its objects, morphisms, identity morphisms, and a valid composition rule (associative and respects identities).\n    *   **Objects**: We are given 2 objects, let's call them `A` and `B`.\n    *   **Morphisms**: We have a total of 4 morphisms.\n    *   **Identity Morphisms**: For a category to be valid, every object must have an identity morphism. So, we must have `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. These are two of our four morphisms.\n    *   **Non-Identity Morphisms**: This leaves us with `4 - 2 = 2` non-identity morphisms to place. Let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n2.  **Distribute Morphisms**: The morphisms of a category are partitioned into sets `Hom(X, Y)`, which denotes the set of morphisms from object `X` to object `Y`. In our case, we have four such sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n    *   We know `id_A` is in `Hom(A, A)` and `id_B` is in `Hom(B, B)`.\n    *   We need to distribute the remaining 2 morphisms, `f` and `g`, among these four `Hom` sets.\n\n3.  **Enumerate Distributions**: Let `n'_AA`, `n_AB`, `n_BA`, `n'_BB` be the number of non-identity morphisms in `Hom(A,A)`, `Hom(A,B)`, `Hom(B,A)`, and `Hom(B,B)` respectively. We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to `n'_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n'_BB = 2`. This is a classic combinatorics problem that yields 10 possible distributions.\n\n4.  **Account for Isomorphism**: Two categories are isomorphic if they are structurally identical. An isomorphism can, for example, swap the roles of objects A and B. This means we only need to consider distributions that are unique up to swapping A and B. This reduces the 10 distributions to 6 representative cases.\n\n5.  **Analyze Each Case**: For each of the 6 unique distributions, we determine how many valid, non-isomorphic composition structures can be defined. This involves defining the composition of morphisms and ensuring the rules of associativity (`h o (g o f) = (h o g) o f`) and identity (`f o id_A = f`, `id_B o f = f`, etc.) are satisfied.\n\n    *   **Case 1**: Both `f` and `g` are in `Hom(A, A)`. The problem reduces to finding the number of non-isomorphic 3-element monoids. There are 7 such monoids.\n    *   **Case 2**: Both `f` and `g` are in `Hom(A, B)`. There are no non-trivial compositions possible. This gives 1 category.\n    *   **Case 3**: `f` is in `Hom(A, A)` and `g` is in `Hom(A, B)`. We must define `f o f` and `g o f`. This leads to 2 distinct categories.\n    *   **Case 4**: `f` is in `Hom(A, A)` and `g` is in `Hom(B, A)`. This case is not isomorphic to the previous one and also yields 2 distinct categories.\n    *   **Case 5**: `f` is in `Hom(A, A)` and `g` is in `Hom(B, B)`. This structure is a disjoint union of two 2-element monoids. There are 3 ways to combine these structures up to isomorphism.\n    *   **Case 6**: `f` is in `Hom(A, B)` and `g` is in `Hom(B, A)`. The composition rules are completely forced by the category axioms, leading to a single, unique category where A and B are isomorphic objects.\n\n6.  **Sum the Results**: The total number of categories is the sum of the counts from each distinct case.\n\nThe following Python code implements this step-by-step analysis to calculate the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    This is a theoretical enumeration problem.
