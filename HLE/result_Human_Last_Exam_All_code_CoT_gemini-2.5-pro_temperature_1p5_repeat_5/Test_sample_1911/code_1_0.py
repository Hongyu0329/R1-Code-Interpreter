    Analyzes the five statements about the set L = {(x,y) in R^2 : y = |x|}.

    Statement A is considered true under a common definition of immersed submanifold that
    doesn't require injectivity. L is the image of a non-injective immersion from a
    manifold with boundary ([0,inf) U [0,inf)).

    Statement B is true because a smooth curve covering L can be constructed using
    a smooth surjective function x(t) that is "flat" at its zero, making y(t)=|x(t)| smooth.

    Statement C is false. L is homeomorphic to R. R is not homeomorphic to S^n for any n
    because S^n is compact (n>=1) or disconnected (n=0) while R is not. A diffeomorphism
    implies a homeomorphism.

    Statement D is true. L is homeomorphic to R, and R is a Lie group. The structure can be
    transferred to L.

    Statement E is true. L is not a manifold only at the origin (0,0). Removing this unique
    point makes the remainder a smooth submanifold of R^2. Removing any other point leaves
    the problematic origin.

    Therefore, the only false statement is C.
