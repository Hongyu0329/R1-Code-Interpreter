    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the number of MLB Triple Crown winners.\n\nFirst, I will identify the two types of Triple Crowns in Major League Baseball: the batting Triple Crown and the pitching Triple Crown.\nNext, I will count the number of unique players who have achieved the batting Triple Crown.\nThen, I will count the number of unique players who have achieved the pitching Triple Crown.\nFinally, I will add these two numbers together to find the total number of unique players who have won a Triple Crown and present this calculation in the code's output.\n\n```python\ndef count_triple_crown_winners():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the total number of unique MLB Triple Crown winners.\n    The Triple Crown can be won by either a batter or a pitcher. This function\n    sums the unique winners from both categories.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown\n    # (leading their league in batting average, home runs, and RBIs).\n    # Some players, like Rogers Hornsby, won it multiple times but are counted once.\n    unique_batting_winners = 15\n\n    # Number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown\n    # (leading their league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA).\n    # Players like Walter Johnson and Sandy Koufax won multiple times but are counted once.\n    unique_pitching_winners = 23\n\n    # Total number of unique players who have won a Triple Crown.\n    # Since no player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown,\n    # we can simply add the two numbers together.\n    total_unique_winners = unique_batting_winners + unique_pitching_winners\n\n    print(\"To find the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners, we add the unique batting winners and unique pitching winners.\")\n    print(f\"Unique Batting Triple Crown Winners: {unique_batting_winners}\")\n    print(f\"Unique Pitching Triple Crown Winners: {unique_pitching_winners}\")\n    print(\"The total number of unique Triple Crown winners is the sum of these two groups:\")\n    print(f\"{unique_batting_winners} + {unique_pitching_winners} = {total_unique_winners}\")\n\ncount_triple_crown_winners()\n```\n<<<38>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
