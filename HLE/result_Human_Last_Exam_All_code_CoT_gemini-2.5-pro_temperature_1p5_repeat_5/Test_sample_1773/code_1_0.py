# This plan is to simulate the physiological effect of acetazolamide on intraocular pressure (IOP).
#
# 1.  Establish a baseline normal intraocular pressure (IOP). The typical normal range is 10-21 mmHg. We'll use a value within this range.
# 2.  Model the effect of acetazolamide. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. It reduces the production of aqueous humor in the eye, which directly leads to a decrease in IOP. We will represent this as a negative pressure value.
# 3.  Simulate the scenario: The patient's initial condition (high intracranial pressure) has resolved, but they continue to take the medication. The drug's effect on the eye is independent of the intracranial pressure status.
# 4.  Calculate the new IOP by applying the drug's effect to the baseline IOP.
# 5.  Print the logic, the final equation with each number, and the conclusion. The result will demonstrate that the IOP is now below the normal range.

# Step 1: Define a normal baseline IOP in mmHg.
normal_iop = 16

# Step 2: Define the pressure-lowering effect of acetazolamide in mmHg.
# This drug is prescribed specifically to lower pressure.
drug_pressure_reduction = 6

# Step 3 & 4: Calculate the resulting IOP.
# Even with the remission of intracranial hypertension, the drug continues to act on the eye.
final_iop = normal_iop - drug_pressure_reduction

# Step 5: Print the explanation and the result.
