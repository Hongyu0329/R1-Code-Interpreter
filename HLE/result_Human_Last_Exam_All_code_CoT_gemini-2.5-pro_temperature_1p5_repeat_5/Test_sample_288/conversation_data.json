    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will execute a Python script to analyze the publicly available connectome data.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will fetch the connectome dataset from its source at `wormwiring.org`. This dataset contains a comprehensive list of all synaptic connections in the C. elegans nervous system.\n2.  I will then load this data into a pandas DataFrame, a powerful tool for data analysis in Python.\n3.  Next, I will filter the dataset to isolate only the connections that originate from the ASJ neuron pair (ASJL and ASJR).\n4.  Since many C. elegans neurons exist as left/right pairs (e.g., AIYL/AIYR) that are often considered a single functional class (e.g., AIY), I will group the target neurons by their class. I'll do this by removing the 'L' or 'R' suffix from their names.\n5.  I will then sum the number of synapses for each target neuron class to find the total synaptic input each class receives from the ASJ neurons.\n6.  The neuron class with the highest total number of synapses will be identified as the main projection target.\n7.  To provide a clear and complete answer, the script will print a breakdown of all the individual synapses from ASJL and ASJR to the members of the identified target class, including the final equation summing them up.\n8.  Finally, I will output the name of the main target cell class in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport requests\nimport io\n\ndef find_asj_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the main projection target of the ASJ neurons in the\n    adult C. elegans hermaphrodite connectome by analyzing public data.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # The URL points to the supplementary data from Cook et al., Nature, 2019\n        url = \"http://wormwiring.org/si/SI-1-Connectome.xlsx\"\n        print(f\"Fetching C. elegans connectome data from {url}...\")\n        # Use a timeout for the request to prevent indefinite hanging\n        response = requests.get(url, timeout=30)\n        # Raise an HTTPError for bad responses (4xx or 5xx)\n        response.raise_for_status()\n        print(\"Data downloaded successfully.\\n\")\n\n        # Read the Excel file content from memory\n        excel_file = io.BytesIO(response.content)\n        df = pd.read_excel(excel_file, sheet_name='Connectome')\n\n    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:\n        print(f\"Error fetching data: {e}\")\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve connectome data.
