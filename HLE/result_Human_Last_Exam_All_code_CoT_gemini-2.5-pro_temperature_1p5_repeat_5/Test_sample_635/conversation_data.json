    "To find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function $H(s)$, we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, that satisfy the following conditions:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular matrix (i.e., its determinant is not the zero polynomial).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. This means the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. A practical way to ensure this for a minimal system is to find a factorization where the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ is equal to the McMillan degree of $H(s)$.\n\nThe given transfer function is:\n\\[\nH(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to derive the factorization:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the equation**\n\nThe equation $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. Let's write this out with generic polynomial matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nPerforming the multiplication on the left side gives:\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} n_{11}(s) & n_{12}(s) \\\\ n_{21}(s) & n_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, every entry on the left must be a polynomial.\n\n**Step 2: Derive constraints on the elements**\n\nFrom the right column of the resulting matrix, we immediately get:\n- $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$\n- $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$\nThis implies that $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials.\n\nFrom the left column, we need the expressions to simplify to polynomials. Let's use the common denominator $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$:\n- $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n- $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n\nThis means the numerators must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the matrices**\n\nWe will build the simplest possible polynomial matrices that satisfy these conditions.\n\n*   **For the first row of D(s) and N(s):**\n    We need $d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ to be divisible by $s^2-1$. Let's try the simplest choice for $d_{11}(s)$: a constant. Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$.\n    Then the numerator becomes $(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$. For this to be divisible by $s^2-1$, let's set it equal to the simplest possible multiple, which is $1 \\cdot (s^2-1)$.\n    $(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s) = s^2-1$\n    $s^2 - 2s + 1 + 2d_{12}(s) = s^2-1$\n    $2d_{12}(s) = 2s - 2$\n    $d_{12}(s) = s-1$\n    This is a polynomial, so this choice works.\n    Now we can find the first row of $N(s)$:\n    $n_{11}(s) = \\frac{s^2-1}{s^2-1} = 1$\n    $n_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s) = 1$\n    So, the first row of $D(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the first row of $N(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n*   **For the second row of D(s) and N(s):**\n    We need $d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ to be divisible by $s^2-1$. Let's make the simplest choice for $d_{21}(s)$: let $d_{21}(s)=0$.\n    The condition becomes that $2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$. The simplest polynomial choice for $d_{22}(s)$ is $d_{22}(s) = s^2-1$.\n    Now we can find the second row of $N(s)$:\n    $n_{21}(s) = \\frac{0 \\cdot (s-1)^2 + 2(s^2-1)}{s^2-1} = 2$\n    $n_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s) = 0$\n    So, the second row of $D(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}$ and the second row of $N(s)$ is $\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\n**Step 4: Final factorization and verification**\n\nCombining the rows, we get our candidate factorization:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad , \\quad N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nTo verify coprimeness, we can check the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$.\n$\\det(D(s)) = 1 \\cdot (s^2-1) - (s-1) \\cdot 0 = s^2-1$.\nThe degree of the determinant is 2. The McMillan degree of $H(s)$ is also 2 (as can be found from the denominator of $\\det H(s)$). Since these degrees match, our factorization is minimal, which implies it is coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define and display these matrices.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the symbolic variable 's'\ns = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n# Define the matrices D(s) and N(s) based on our derivation\nD = sympy.Matrix([\n    [1, s - 1],\n    [0, s**2 - 1]\n])\n\nN = sympy.Matrix([\n    [1, 1],\n    [2, 0]\n])\n\n# Print the results in a clear format\nprint(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\nprint(\"\\nD(s) =\")\nsympy.pretty_print(D)\n\nprint(\"\\nN(s) =\")\nsympy.pretty_print(N)\n\n# The final answer in the required format\n# Let's represent the matrices D and N row by row\n# D = [[d11, d12], [d21, d22]]\n# N = [[n11, n12], [n21, n22]]\nd11, d12 = D.row(0)\nd21, d22 = D.row(1)\nn11, n12 = N.row(0)\nn21, n22 = N.row(1)\n\nprint(f\"\"\"\nFinal Answer:\nD(s) = \n| {d11}    {d12} |\n| {d21}    {d22} |\n\nN(s) = \n| {n11}    {n12} |\n| {n21}     {n22} |\n\"\"\")\n\n# The final output is requested in a specific format \" <<<answer content>>> \".\n# I will output the matrices in a list-of-lists format.\n# D(s) = [[1, s-1], [0, s**2-1]]\n# N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]\nanswer_D = [[str(d11), str(d12)], [str(d21), str(d22)]]\nanswer_N = [[str(n11), str(n12)], [str(n21), str(n22)]]\nanswer_string = f\"D(s) = {answer_D}, N(s) = {answer_N}\"\n\n# It's difficult to represent this structure directly in the required format.\n# I will print the components of the D and N matrices.\nfinal_answer_str = f\"D(s) = [[{d11}, {d12}], [{d21}, {d22}]], N(s) = [[{n11}, {n12}], [{n21}, {n22}]]\"\n\n# Since a single simple answer is preferred, let's format it nicely.\n# Let's provide the final result D(s) and N(s) in a structured way.\nprint(\"Final Answer in <<<...>>> format:\")\nprint(\"D(s) matrix, row 1: [1, s - 1]\")\nprint(\"D(s) matrix, row 2: [0, s**2 - 1]\")\nprint(\"N(s) matrix, row 1: [1, 1]\")\nprint(\"N(s) matrix, row 2: [2, 0]\")\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s-1], [0, s**2-1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>\n```"
