    This function determines the greatest possible rank of the matrix E.

    The problem is to find the matrix E with the minimum Frobenius norm such that a given
    nonzero vector x exactly solves the least-squares problem min_z ||(A+E)z - b||_2.
    Then, we need to find the greatest possible rank of this E.

    Let E* be the matrix that minimizes ||E||_F subject to the constraint
    (A+E)^T((A+E)x - b) = 0.

    The analysis shows that the optimal matrix E* must have the structure of an outer
    product of two vectors. Specifically, E* can be written as:
    E* = y*x^T / ||x||_2^2
    where y* is a vector that minimizes ||y||_2 while satisfying a complex constraint.

    The rank of an outer product of two vectors is at most 1. It is 1 if both
    vectors are non-zero and 0 otherwise. Since x is given to be non-zero, the
    rank of E* is 1 if y* is non-zero, and 0 if y* is zero.

    The solution y* turns out to be zero only in the special case where x is already
    a least-squares solution for the original system with matrix A and vector b.

    By choosing A, b, and x such that x is not a least-squares solution for Ax=b,
    we can ensure that y* is non-zero, making the rank of E* equal to 1.
    For example, A=I, b=0, and x being any non-zero vector. The least squares
    solution is z=0, so x is not the solution unless x=0, which is disallowed.

    Since the rank of E* can be 1, and it cannot exceed 1, the greatest possible rank is 1.
