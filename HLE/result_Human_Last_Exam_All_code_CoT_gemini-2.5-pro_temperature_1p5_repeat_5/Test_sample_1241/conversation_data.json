    "To find the steady-state probabilities for the given boundary-value problem, we need to analyze the system as time $t$ approaches infinity. In this limit, the system reaches a steady state, meaning the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant. Let's denote these steady-state probabilities as $\\pi_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nAt steady state, the rate of change of each probability is zero, so $P_i'(t) = 0$ for all $i$. This transforms the given system of differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations. I will correct a likely typo in the second equation from $-\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$ to $+\\lambda_{01}P_{0}(t)$, as is standard for such systems and ensures that the total probability is conserved.\n\nThe resulting system of linear equations is:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} + \\lambda_{10}\\pi_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}\\pi_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})\\pi_{1} + \\lambda_{21}\\pi_{2} + \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}\\pi_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})\\pi_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}\\pi_{2} - \\lambda_{31}\\pi_{3}$\nAlong with the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n5.  $\\pi_{0} + \\pi_{1} + \\pi_{2} + \\pi_{3} = 1$\n\nThe first four equations are linearly dependent. To obtain a unique solution for the probabilities $\\pi_i$, we can replace one of them with the normalization equation. I will use equations 1, 3, 4, and 5 to form a solvable system.\n\nThis system can be expressed in the matrix form $A\\mathbf{\\pi} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{\\pi} = [\\pi_0, \\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3]^T$. The Python script below will construct the matrix $A$ and vector $\\mathbf{b}$ from the given $\\lambda$ values and the equations, solve for the vector of probabilities $\\mathbf{\\pi}$ using `numpy.linalg.solve`, and then compute and display the required sum $\\pi_0 + \\pi_1$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given lambda values\nlambda_01 = 0.019\nlambda_10 = 0.65\nlambda_12 = 0.4\nlambda_21 = 0.392\nlambda_23 = 0.008\nlambda_31 = 0.008\n\n# We set up the system of linear equations A * p = b for the steady-state probabilities p = [p0, p1, p2, p3].\n# We use the first, third, and fourth steady-state equations, plus the normalization equation.\n# Equation 1: -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1 = 0\n# Equation 3: lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2 = 0\n# Equation 4: lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3 = 0\n# Normalization: p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n\nA = np.array([\n    [-lambda_01, lambda_10, 0, 0],\n    [0, lambda_12, -(lambda_21 + lambda_23), 0],\n    [0, 0, lambda_23, -lambda_31],\n    [1, 1, 1, 1]\n])\n\nb = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations\ntry:\n    p = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n    p0 = p[0]\n    p1 = p[1]\n    \n    # Calculate the required sum\n    result = p0 + p1\n    \n    # Print the equation with the found values\n    print(f\"P0(+inf) + P1(+inf) = {p0} + {p1} = {result}\")\n\nexcept np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n    print(\"The system of equations is singular and cannot be solved.\")\n\n```\n<<<0.9462517680339462>>>"
