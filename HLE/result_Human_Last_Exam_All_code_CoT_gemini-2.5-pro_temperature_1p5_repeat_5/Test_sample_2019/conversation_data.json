    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to place 4 queens on a 5x5 chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. The board is toroidal, which means it wraps around on all sides (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the \"Non-Attacking\" Rule:** On a 5x5 toroidal board, a queen at `(r, c)` attacks another queen at `(r', c')` if any of the following conditions are met (all calculations are modulo 5):\n    *   They are in the same row: `r = r'`\n    *   They are in the same column: `c = c'`\n    *   They are on the same main diagonal: `r - c = r' - c'`\n    *   They are on the same anti-diagonal: `r + c = r' + c'`\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm:** The problem is a combinatorial counting problem. A direct formula is complex. Therefore, a backtracking search algorithm is a straightforward and reliable approach. This algorithm will explore all possible placements of 4 queens on the 25 available squares.\n\n3.  **Implement the Backtracking Search:**\n    *   We will write a recursive function that attempts to place queens one by one.\n    *   To ensure that we count each unique set of 4 queens only once, we will number the board's cells from 0 to 24 (e.g., `cell_index = row * 5 + col`). When placing the next queen, we will only consider cells with a higher index than the previously placed queen. This prevents us from generating permutations of the same set of queens.\n    *   The recursive function `backtrack(k, start_index, positions)` will keep track of:\n        *   `k`: The number of queens already placed.\n        *   `start_index`: The cell index from which to start searching for the next placement.\n        *   `positions`: A list of the coordinates of queens placed so far.\n    *   The recursion stops when `k` reaches 4, at which point we've found a valid arrangement, and we increment a counter.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The Python script will execute the backtracking algorithm and print the total number of valid configurations. The code will explicitly mention the board size (5) and the number of queens (4) as the parameters for the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_4_queens_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n    board_size = 5\n    num_queens = 4\n    count = 0\n\n    def backtrack(k, start_index, positions):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively places queens on the board.\n\n        :param k: The number of queens placed so far.\n        :param start_index: The starting cell index for placing the next queen.\n        :param positions: A list of (row, col) tuples for the queens already placed.\n        \"\"\"\n        nonlocal count\n        # Base case: if all queens are placed, we found a valid solution.\n        if k == num_queens:\n            count += 1\n            return\n\n        # Pruning: if remaining cells are not enough to place remaining queens, stop.\n        if board_size * board_size - start_index < num_queens - k:\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through the cells to place the next queen.\n        for i in range(start_index, board_size * board_size):\n            r = i // board_size\n            c = i % board_size\n\n            # Check if the current cell (r, c) is safe from attacks.\n            is_safe = True\n            for pr, pc in positions:\n                # Check for row, column, and diagonal attacks (toroidal).\n                if (r == pr or\n                        c == pc or\n                        (r - c) % board_size == (pr - pc) % board_size or\n                        (r + c) % board_size == (pr + pc) % board_size):\n                    is_safe = False\n                    break\n            \n            if is_safe:\n                # Place the queen and recurse.\n                positions.append((r, c))\n                backtrack(k + 1, i + 1, positions)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities.\n                positions.pop()\n\n    # Start the search from the first queen (k=0) at the first cell (start_index=0).\n    backtrack(0, 0, [])\n\n    print(f\"Problem parameters:\")\n    print(f\"Board size: {board_size}x{board_size} (toroidal)\")\n    print(f\"Number of queens: {num_queens}\")\n    print(f\"Final calculation: The number of ways is the result of the search.\")\n    print(f\"Result: {count}\")\n\n\nsolve_4_queens_toroidal()\n```\n<<<250>>>"
