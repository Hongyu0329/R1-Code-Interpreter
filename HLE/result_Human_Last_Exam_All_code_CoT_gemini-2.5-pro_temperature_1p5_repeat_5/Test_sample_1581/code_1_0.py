# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes of certain topological spaces.
# Based on established theorems in algebraic topology, we have identified two such classes.

# Class 1: The arc, homeomorphic to the interval [0, 1].
# For an arc X, the configuration space F(X, n) is disconnected for all n >= 2.
class_1 = "The Arc ([0, 1])"

# Class 2: The real projective plane, RP^2.
# For X = RP^2, F(X, 2) is connected, but F(X, n) is disconnected for all n >= 3.
class_2 = "The Real Projective Plane (RP^2)"

# The set of homeomorphism classes satisfying the condition.
solution_classes = {class_1, class_2}

# The number of such classes is the size of this set.
number_of_classes = len(solution_classes)
