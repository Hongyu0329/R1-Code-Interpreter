1) Interaction Hotspots: The exact residues on the beta-1 subunit for interaction are primarily Y211, K247, E251, L255, I259, and L260. 2) Gating Modulation Hotspots: The key region for modulating inactivation is the N-terminal domain (approximately residues 1-30). The core binding interaction itself (involving the residues from part 1) is the primary modulator of channel activation.
