    "The problem is to find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ for a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit).\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Rank of a Quantum Channel:** The rank of a quantum channel $\\Lambda$ is defined as the rank of its Choi matrix, $J(\\Lambda)$. This is also the minimum number of Kraus operators required to describe the channel.\n2.  **Relate the Channel to its Complementary:** There's a fundamental theorem in quantum information theory that states the rank of a channel $\\Lambda$ is equal to the rank of its complementary channel $\\Lambda^c$. This is because their Choi matrices, $J(\\Lambda)$ and $J(\\Lambda^c)$, are derived from the same pure quantum state (the Stinespring dilation purified with a reference system) by tracing out different subsystems. Therefore, they have the same set of non-zero eigenvalues, and thus the same rank.\n3.  **Analyze the Pauli Channel's Rank:** With the above insight, the problem simplifies to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ itself. A Pauli channel on a $d$-dimensional system is defined by the action:\n    $$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} \\rho U_{j,k}^\\dagger $$\n    where $\\{U_{j,k}\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $\\{p_{j,k}\\}$ is a probability distribution ($p_{j,k} \\ge 0$, $\\sum p_{j,k} = 1$).\n4.  **Determine the Maximal Rank:** The Kraus operators for this channel can be chosen as $A_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}$. The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_{j,k}\\}$ form an orthogonal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices. Consequently, the rank of the channel is simply the number of operators with a non-zero probability coefficient, i.e., the number of $p_{j,k} > 0$.\n5.  **Find the Maximum:** To maximize the rank, we need to maximize the number of non-zero probabilities. We can set all $d^2$ probabilities to be non-zero. For example, the depolarizing channel sets $p_{j,k} = 1/d^2$ for all $j,k$. This is a valid channel, and its rank is $d^2$.\n6.  **Conclusion:** The maximal rank of a Pauli channel is $d^2$. Since the rank of the complementary channel is the same, its maximal rank is also $d^2$.\n\nThe Python code below will formalize this reasoning and print the final formula.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_rank_of_complementary_pauli_channel():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the maximal rank of the complementary channel\n    of a Pauli channel for a d-dimensional qudit system.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of the qudit system is a variable, represented symbolically by 'd'.\n    d_symbol = 'd'\n    exponent = 2\n\n    # Explanation of the steps\n    print(\"To find the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel, we follow these steps:\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Relate the ranks of a channel and its complementary.\")\n    print(\"A fundamental result in quantum information theory states that the rank of a channel is equal to the rank of its complementary channel.\")\n    print(\"Rank(Channel) = Rank(Complementary Channel)\")\n    print(\"So, the problem reduces to finding the maximal rank of the Pauli channel itself.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Define the rank of a Pauli channel.\")\n    print(f\"A Pauli channel for a {d_symbol}-dimensional system (qudit) is constructed from a set of {d_symbol}*{d_symbol} = {d_symbol}^{exponent} generalized Pauli operators.\")\n    print(\"The rank of the channel is the number of these Pauli operators that are included in its definition with a non-zero probability.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Find the maximum possible rank.\")\n    print(f\"To maximize the rank, we need to use the maximum number of Pauli operators with non-zero probabilities.\")\n    print(f\"It is possible to construct a valid channel using all {d_symbol}^{exponent} operators (e.g., the depolarizing channel).\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the maximal rank of a Pauli channel is {d_symbol}^{exponent}.\")\n\n    # Final result\n    maximal_rank_formula = f\"{d_symbol}^{exponent}\"\n\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is equal to the maximal rank of the Pauli channel itself.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation for the maximal rank is:\")\n    print(f\"Maximal Rank = {d_symbol} to the power of {exponent}\")\n    print(f\"Result: {maximal_rank_formula}\")\n\n# Execute the function to print the explanation and result.\nsolve_maximal_rank_of_complementary_pauli_channel()\n```\n<<<d^2>>>"
