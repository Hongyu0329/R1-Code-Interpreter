    steps = [
        "1. Deconstructing 'rusybavlamdei': This word is a 'lujvo' (compound word), which can be broken down into smaller parts called 'rafsi'.",
        "   - rusy\n   - bav\n   - lam\n   - dei",

        "2. Identifying the Root Words ('gismu'): Each 'rafsi' corresponds to a root word with a specific meaning and place structure (arguments denoted by x1, x2, etc.).",
        "   - 'rusy' comes from 'rusko': x1 is gray.",
        "   - 'bav' comes from 'balvi': x1 is in the future of x2.",
        "   - 'lam' comes from 'lamji': x1 is adjacent to x2.",
        "   - 'dei' comes from 'djedi': x1 is a duration of x2 full days by standard x3.",

        "3. Analyzing the Lujvo Structure: In a 'lujvo', the final component is the 'head', and its meaning forms the core of the new word. The preceding parts modify the head, usually by describing its first argument (x1).",
        "   - The head of 'rusybavlamdei' is 'dei' (from 'djedi').",
        "   - Therefore, 'rusybavlamdei' fundamentally describes a type of 'djedi' (day/duration of days).",
        "   - The modifiers 'rusy', 'bav', and 'lam' specify the *kind* of day/duration (x1): it is a gray, future, adjacent day/duration.",

        "4. Determining the Final Place Structure: Because 'rusybavlamdei' is a type of 'djedi', it inherits the place structure of 'djedi'. The modifiers describe x1 but do not change the subsequent places (x2, x3).",
        "   - The place structure for 'djedi' is: x1 is the duration of x2 full days according to day standard x3.",
        "   - Therefore, the place structure for 'rusybavlamdei' is also: x1 (the gray, future, adjacent day-duration) is a duration of x2 full days according to day standard x3.",

        "5. Interpreting x2 and x3: Based on this inherited structure:",
        "   - x2 is the number of full days.",
        "   - x3 is the 'day standard' (e.g., a 24-hour solar day).",

        "6. Conclusion: Comparing this with the options, we find a direct match. Option E states: 'x2 is the number of full days corresponding to x1; x3 is the 'day standard''."
