    # 1. Let G be a finite group of order |G|.
    order_G = 10000

    # 2. The group G acts on the vector space V = C^10 via a representation
    # rho: G -> GL(10, C). The group that effectively acts on V is H = rho(G).
    
    # 3. A key theorem in invariant theory states that the dimension of the quotient
    # ring R/I (the coinvariant algebra) is equal to the order of the acting group H.
    # dim(R/I) = |H|

    # 4. We want to maximize this dimension, which means we need to maximize |H|.
    # By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, H is isomorphic to G/ker(rho).
    # This gives us the equation for the order of H:
    # |H| = |G| / |ker(rho)|

    # To maximize |H|, we need to minimize |ker(rho)|. The smallest possible
    # size for a subgroup is 1 (the trivial subgroup {e}).
    min_ker_rho_order = 1

    # If we can find a group G and a representation rho such that |ker(rho)| = 1,
    # then rho is a "faithful" representation. In this case, the order of H would be:
    max_order_H = order_G / min_ker_rho_order

    # 5. The problem now reduces to showing that there exists a group G of order 10000
    # that has a faithful 10-dimensional representation.

    # Consider the cyclic group G = C_10000. Let g be its generator.
    # Let omega be a primitive 10000-th root of unity.
    # omega = exp(2 * pi * i / 10000)
    
    # We can define a 10-dimensional representation rho by mapping the generator g to
    # a diagonal matrix:
    # rho(g) = diag(omega, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
    
    # This representation is faithful because rho(g^k) is the identity matrix
    # if and only if omega^k = 1, which implies k is a multiple of 10000.
    # So, the kernel is trivial, |ker(rho)| = 1.
    
    # The image group H = rho(G) is therefore a subgroup of GL(10, C) of order 10000.
    
    # The information that G is a subgroup of GL_100(C) is consistent. Any such group H
    # can be embedded into GL_100(C) trivially (e.g., as block-diagonal matrices).
    
    # Conclusion: The largest possible order for H is 10000.
    # Therefore, the largest possible dimension for R/I is 10000.
