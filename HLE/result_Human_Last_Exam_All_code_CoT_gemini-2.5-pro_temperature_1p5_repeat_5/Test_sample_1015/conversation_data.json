    "My plan is to first understand the technical differences between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods regarding the `cambré derrière` (a backward bend). I will then create a Python script that will explain these differences and identify the correct answer from the provided choices. The script will print the question, the options, a detailed explanation of the core difference, and finally, the correct answer choice.\n\nThe key distinction lies in the foundational principles of each method:\n1.  **Vaganova (Russian):** Emphasizes stability, strength, and precise alignment. In a `cambré derrière`, the primary goal is to maintain the hips squarely over the supporting leg(s). The bend originates from the upper and middle back, creating an arc in the thoracic spine while the pelvis remains stable. This is considered a purer, more controlled backbend.\n2.  **Balanchine (American Neoclassical):** Focuses on speed, dynamics, and creating long, extended lines. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic curve in a `cambré derrière`, the Balanchine method allows and often encourages the hips to press forward, moving off the vertical axis of the supporting leg(s). This creates a larger, more visually striking arc involving the entire body.\n\nBased on this, the most fundamental difference is the **placement of the hip**. Vaganova keeps it stable and aligned; Balanchine pushes it forward. This corresponds to option B.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes and answers a multiple-choice question about ballet technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    question = \"What is the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods?\"\n    \n    options = {\n        \"A\": \"Arm placement during allongé\",\n        \"B\": \"Placement of hip\",\n        \"C\": \"Speed\",\n        \"D\": \"Degree of backbend\",\n        \"E\": \"Placement of head\"\n    }\n\n    explanation = \"\"\"\nExplanation:\nThe primary technical difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the treatment of the hips.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method prioritizes core stability and alignment. The hips must remain square and stacked directly over the supporting foot/feet. The bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine), focusing on spinal articulation without displacing the pelvis.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method:** This method emphasizes creating dynamic and visually expansive lines. To achieve a deeper backbend, the dancer is encouraged to press the hips forward, away from the vertical alignment over their support. This use of the hips allows for what appears to be a more extreme backbend.\n\nWhile other elements like speed (C) or the degree of the backbend (D) can also differ, the hip placement (B) is the root technical cause of these other differences. Therefore, the placement of the hip is the most fundamental distinction.\n\"\"\"\n\n    correct_answer_key = \"B\"\n\n    print(question)\n    print(\"\\nAnswer Choices:\")\n    for key, value in options.items():\n        print(f\"{key}. {value}\")\n    \n    print(explanation)\n    \n    print(f\"The correct answer is B: {options[correct_answer_key]}\")\n\nsolve_ballet_question()\n<<<B>>>\n```"
