Explanation:
The primary technical difference between a Vaganova and Balanchine cambré derrière lies in the treatment of the hips.

1.  **Vaganova Method:** This method prioritizes core stability and alignment. The hips must remain square and stacked directly over the supporting foot/feet. The bend initiates from the upper back (thoracic spine), focusing on spinal articulation without displacing the pelvis.

2.  **Balanchine Method:** This method emphasizes creating dynamic and visually expansive lines. To achieve a deeper backbend, the dancer is encouraged to press the hips forward, away from the vertical alignment over their support. This use of the hips allows for what appears to be a more extreme backbend.

While other elements like speed (C) or the degree of the backbend (D) can also differ, the hip placement (B) is the root technical cause of these other differences. Therefore, the placement of the hip is the most fundamental distinction.
