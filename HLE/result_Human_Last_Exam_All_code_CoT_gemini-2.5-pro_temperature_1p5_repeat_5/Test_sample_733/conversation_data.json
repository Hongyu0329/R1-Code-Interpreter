    "This problem requires identifying all non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal product-free set of size 2. This is a known classification problem in abstract algebra.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will clarify the definitions of a \"product-free set\" and a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set\".\n2.  A set `S` within a group `G` is **product-free** if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (where `x` and `y` can be the same element), their product `x*y` is not an element of `S`.\n3.  A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it cannot be extended. This means for any element `g` that is in `G` but not in `S`, the new set `S âˆª {g}` is no longer product-free.\n4.  The problem specifies that the size of the set `S` is 2.\n5.  I will then list the finite groups that are known to have this property, based on the established mathematical literature (specifically, a result by G.L. Walls).\n6.  Finally, I will write a Python script that enumerates these groups, demonstrates the \"calculation\" by adding 1 for each group found, and prints the total count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_group_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script provides the solution to the question about finite groups\n    with maximal product-free sets of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The problem is to find the number of non-isomorphic finite groups that have a maximal product-free set of size 2.\")\n    print(\"This is a known classification problem in group theory.
