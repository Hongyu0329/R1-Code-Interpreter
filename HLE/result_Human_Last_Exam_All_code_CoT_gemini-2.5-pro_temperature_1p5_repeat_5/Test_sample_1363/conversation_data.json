    "My plan is to first understand the technical requirements of each dance listed in the answer choices. I will then analyze the mechanics of a 'reverse turn' within the context of each dance style. The key is to identify which dance has such a rigid and specific technique that adding extra rotation (overturning) to a reverse turn would fundamentally violate its core principles, rather than just being a variation or a matter of skill. Based on this technical analysis, I will write a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the correct choice.\n\nThe core of the reasoning will focus on the difference between the \"swing\" dances (Waltz, Foxtrot, Quickstep), which are characterized by continuous, flowing movement, and the \"staccato\" nature of the Tango, which involves sharp, deliberate actions and specific foot closures.\n\n```python\ndef find_dance():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the technique of standard ballroom dances to answer the question.\n\n    The question asks in which dance it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without\n    disregarding the technique.\n\n    Analysis of Dance Techniques:\n    - Dances A, B, D, and E (Viennese Waltz, English Waltz, Slow Foxtrot, Quickstep) are known as \"swing dances\". Their technique is based on continuous, flowing movement, momentum, rise and fall (except for foxtrot's specific interpretation), and sway. In these dances, a reverse turn can be modified to have more rotation (overturned). While this may be difficult or require high skill, it does not fundamentally violate the core principle of continuous swinging action.\n\n    - Dance C (European Tango) is unique. Its technique is not based on swing. It is characterized by sharp, staccato movements, no rise and fall, no sway, and a \"walking\" action where feet are picked up and placed. A typical Tango Reverse Turn (e.g., the Rock Turn) involves a specific \"rock\" action and concludes with the feet closing together decisively (the \"Tango Close\"). The rotation is contained and sharp. Attempting to overturn this figure would necessitate a continuous, swinging rotation, which would destroy the staccato character and eliminate the technically required \"close.\" Therefore, overturning it is considered impossible without abandoning the fundamental Tango technique.\n    \"\"\"\n    answer_key = 'C'\n    answer_text = 'European Tango'\n\n    explanation = (\n        f\"The dance where it is impossible to overturn a reverse turn without disregarding the technique is the {answer_text}.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Reasoning:\\n\"\n        \"In swing dances like the Waltz, Foxtrot, and Quickstep, movement is continuous and flowing. Overturning a turn is possible, even if it's an advanced variation.\\n\"\n        \"The European Tango, however, is a staccato dance. A Reverse Turn in Tango has a specific, sharp character and often concludes with the feet closing together. Adding more rotation would introduce a continuous 'swing' action, which fundamentally violates the non-swing, staccato technique of the dance. It breaks the rule of the figure's construction.\\n\"\n    )\n\n    print(explanation)\n    print(f\"The final answer is option {answer_key}.\")\n\nfind_dance()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
