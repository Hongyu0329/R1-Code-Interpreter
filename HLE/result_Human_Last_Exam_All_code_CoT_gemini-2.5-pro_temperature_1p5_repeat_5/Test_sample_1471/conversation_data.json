    "<ctrl42> <ctrl42> <ctrl42> <ctrl42> <ctrl42> <ctrl42> <ctrl42> Of course, I can help you solve this.\n\nThe equation you provided uses ancient Cuneiform numerals. Here is the breakdown into modern numbers:\n*   The first numeral ` <ctrl42> ` is the Cuneiform sign for the number 9.\n*   The second numeral `𒌋𒌋𒌋` represents three tens, so its value is 30.\n*   The third numeral `𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹` represents two tens and three ones, so its value is 23.\n\nTherefore, the equation in modern numbers is `9 / 30 - 23`.\n\nHere is a Python script to calculate the solution and print the full equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the numbers from the Cuneiform equation\nnum1 = 9\nnum2 = 30\nnum3 = 23\n\n# Perform the calculation\nresult = num1 / num2 - num3\n\n# Print the full equation with the solution\nprint(f\"{num1} / {num2} - {num3} = {result}\")\n```\n<<<-22.7>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is a solution to this equation:\n𒄶/𒌋𒌋𒌋-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹=?\n\nAnswer using modern numbers\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
