    Plan: To determine the dominant mechanism, we must evaluate how each potential force would influence the flow on the weld pool surface.

    1.  **Analyze the Observation:** The key observation is an inward surface flow, from the cooler edge to the hot center under the arc.

    2.  **Evaluate the Forces:**
        *   **A. Marangoni Force:** This force is driven by a gradient in surface tension. In materials like 304 stainless steel, trace amounts of surface-active elements (like sulfur) cause surface tension to be highest at the hottest point (the center). This high surface tension pulls the surrounding liquid metal from the cooler edges inward. This perfectly matches the observation.
        *   **B. Arc Drag Force:** The plasma jet flows radially outward from the center, which would drag the surface liquid outward, contradicting the observation.
        *   **C. Arc Pressure Force:** This is mainly a downward force and not the primary driver of radial surface flow.
        *   **D. Lorentz Force:** This force tends to constrict or "pinch" the pool, causing inward and downward flow. While important, the Marangoni force is generally considered the dominant driver for this specific *surface* flow phenomenon.
        *   **E. Buoyancy Force:** This force drives vertical convection due to density differences and is typically weaker than the Marangoni force for surface flow.

    3.  **Conclusion:** The inward flow is a direct result of the Marangoni force acting on a material with a positive temperature coefficient of surface tension.
