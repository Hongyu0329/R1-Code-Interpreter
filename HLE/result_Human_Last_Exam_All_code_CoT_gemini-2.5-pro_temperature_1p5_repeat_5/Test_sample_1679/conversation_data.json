    "Here is a plan to determine the first Academy Award Best Picture winner to feature a Luxor Obelisk:\n\n1.  **Identify Luxor Obelisks:** There are two: one at the Luxor Temple in Egypt and its twin at the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  **List Early Best Picture Winners:** I will start from the beginning and analyze early Best Picture winners, especially those set in Paris or Egypt.\n3.  **Analyze Key Candidates:**\n    *   ***The Life of Emile Zola*** **(1937 Winner):** Set in France, but my research indicates it focuses on interiors and doesn't feature the Place de la Concorde.\n    *   ***An American in Paris*** **(1951 Winner):** A musical famous for its Parisian scenery. It prominently features the Place de la Concorde and its obelisk during the ballet sequence.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days*** **(1956 Winner):** Also features Paris, but won later than *An American in Paris*.\n    *   ***Gigi*** **(1958 Winner):** Another musical set in Paris, also a later winner.\n    *   ***Cleopatra*** **(1963):** While featuring ancient Egypt, it did not win Best Picture.\n    *   ***Death on the Nile*** **(1978):** Features the Luxor Temple obelisk, but it did not win Best Picture.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:** Based on the chronological analysis, *An American in Paris* is the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.\n\nI will now create a Python script that programmatically finds this answer from a pre-compiled list of candidates.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function searches through a list of Academy Award Best Picture winners\n    to find the first one that depicts a Luxor Obelisk.\n\n    The two Luxor Obelisks are located in:\n    1.
