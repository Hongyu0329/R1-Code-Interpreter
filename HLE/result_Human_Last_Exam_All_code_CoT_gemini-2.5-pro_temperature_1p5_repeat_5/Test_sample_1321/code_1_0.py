    # Q5: Is a(n) < K*n? No, because there are known super-linear lower bounds,
    # for instance, a(n) is at least quadratic in n for d=1.

    ans9 = "Yes"
    
    # Q6 & Q7 are specific instances of the general lower bound in Q9.
    # For d=3: (2^3+1)(n-1)+1 = 9n-8.

    # Q8: Is a(n) < 33n-32 in 5d? The lower bound from Q9 is 33n-32.
    # However, stronger lower bounds exist, e.g., a(n) >= (2^(5+1)-3)(n-1)+1 = 61n-60.
    # Since a(n) grows at least as fast as 61n-60, it cannot be less than 33n-32 for large n.
    ans8 = "No"

    # Part 2: Numerical questions for the 1D case.
    # Based on the conjecture that a(n) = n^2 for n > 1 in 1D.
