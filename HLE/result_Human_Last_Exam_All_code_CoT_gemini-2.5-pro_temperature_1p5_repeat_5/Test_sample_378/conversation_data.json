    "Based on my research, the user's question contains a factual inaccuracy. Former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. He has never publicly identified himself as or added \"Azikiwe\" to his name. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different, prominent Nigerian statesman and the country's first president.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Which year...\" is that this event never occurred. I will write a Python script to print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef explain_name_clarification():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function clarifies a factual inaccuracy in the user's question.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The user's question is based on a misunderstanding of the former president's name.\n    # His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\n    # Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different Nigerian president.\n    # There is no record of Goodluck Jonathan ever identifying as \"Azikiwe\".\n    \n    explanation = (\n        \"Based on all available public records, former Nigerian President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan \"\n        \"has never publicly identified himself as 'Azikiwe'.\\n\\n\"\n        \"His official full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.\\n\\n\"\n        \"The name 'Azikiwe' belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria (1963-1966). \"\n        \"There may be a confusion between these two distinct figures.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Therefore, there is no year in which this event occurred.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(explanation)\n\nexplain_name_clarification()\n```\n<<<This event never occurred.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
