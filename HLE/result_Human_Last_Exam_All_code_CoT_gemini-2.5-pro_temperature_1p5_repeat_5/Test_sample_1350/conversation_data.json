    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the character:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user is asking to identify a specific character from William Morris's novel, *The House of the Wolfings*. This character must have visited a Roman area and described a local myth that strongly resembles the story of Romulus and Remus.\n2.  **Recall/Research the Novel's Plot:** The novel centers on the Gothic tribe of the Wolfings as they prepare to defend their homes in Mirkwood against a Roman legion. A key theme is the parallel between the Wolfings' own origin myth (being descended from a divine wolf) and the founding myth of their Roman enemies.\n3.  **Identify the Character:** A significant event in the book involves sending a scout to the Roman encampment to gather intelligence. This scout is a thrall (a person in bondage) named **Otter**.\n4.  **Locate the Scene:** Upon his return in Chapter X, \"Otter and the Wolfings Come to Tidings,\" Otter describes what he saw and heard among the Roman soldiers. He recounts their own origin story, telling the assembled Wolfings that the Romans worship a She-wolf and claim descent from two twin brethren whom she suckled. This, of course, is the story of Romulus and Remus, and the Wolfings are astonished to hear that their enemies have a founding myth so similar to their own.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a simple Python script to store the character's name in a variable and then print the answer in a clear, descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the name of the character from William Morris's \n    'The House of the Wolfings' who describes the Roman founding myth.\n    \"\"\"\n    book_title = \"The House of the Wolfings\"\n    character_name = \"Otter\"\n    description = (\n        \"He was a thrall sent to spy on the Roman camp. \"\n        \"Upon his return, he describes the Roman soldiers' belief \"\n        \"in their city's twin founders who were suckled by a She-wolf.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"In William Morris's '{book_title}', the character who describes a Roman myth reminiscent of Romulus and Remus is {character_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nCharacter Description:\")\n    print(description)\n\nfind_character()\n```\n<<<Otter>>>"
