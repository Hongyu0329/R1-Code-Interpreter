Therefore, from the perspective of someone who injects the drug, it 'could be seen as less safe.' This is a valid, nuanced viewpoint.",
        "II": "Supported. This is clinically accurate. For specific populations, such as pregnant women or individuals with a known hypersensitivity to naloxone, the buprenorphine-only formulation (Subutex) is considered the safer and preferred option.",
        "III": "Supported. This is a key principle for their intended use. When taken as prescribed (sublingually), the naloxone in Suboxone has minimal absorption and effect. Thus, the therapeutic effects and safety profile of both medications are dominated by buprenorphine and are considered very similar.",
        "IV": "Not Supported. This statement is incorrect. The relative safety, mechanisms, and clinical applications of Subutex and Suboxone are well-established and are not 'largely unknown.'",
        "V": "Not Supported. This statement contains a factual error. It incorrectly claims that Suboxone's feature for deterring misuse is 'due to the lack of naloxone.' The opposite is true; it is due to the presence of naloxone."
