    """
    Analyzes the provided statements about Saint Augustine to find the incorrect one.

    The logic is as follows:
    - Statements A, C, D, E, and F represent well-established scholarly interpretations of Augustine's philosophy on free will, grace, and predestination.
        - A: Correctly identifies the link made by later thinkers (like Calvinists) to Augustine's ideas of predestination.
        - C: Correctly describes Augustine's concept of 'voluntas' (will) and its classical influences.
        - D: Correctly states the inseparability of philosophy and theology in Augustine's thought.
        - E: Accurately summarizes a nuanced scholarly position by Ã‰tienne Gilson on Augustine's view of grace.
        - F: Correctly paraphrases Augustine's argument against Evodius regarding human responsibility.
    - Statement B, however, makes a dubious claim. R. A. Markus is a major scholar of Augustine. It is a misrepresentation to suggest he would discuss Augustine's concept of freedom while "ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace." His work is known for integrating these complex ideas, not ignoring them. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
