    "My plan is to identify the specific Christian theologian or philosopher who addressed the topic of natural law changes with specialized terminology. I will search my knowledge base for figures who have written on the philosophy of science, miracles, and theology, specifically connecting the Fall of Man with alterations to physical laws and explaining miracles like the virgin birth within that framework.\n\nThe theologian who first developed this specific line of argument and terminology is the contemporary American analytic philosopher **Peter van Inwagen**.\n\nIn his work, particularly in his writings on the problem of evil, van Inwagen introduces a distinction to explain how the world can contain suffering and natural disasters while originating from a good creator. He posits a difference between:\n\n1.  **The original laws of nature:** These were the perfect laws God established at creation. Van Inwagen speculates these laws would have governed a world without death, decay, or natural evil.\n2.  **The current laws of nature:** These are the laws we observe today, which he suggests are a corrupted or damaged version of the original laws. This corruption is a consequence of the Fall.\n\nThis framework allows him to address both points in your question:\n*   **The Fall:** The alteration in natural laws at the Fall is the very basis of his distinction. The world now operates under a \"fallen\" set of physical laws.\n*   **The Virgin Birth (and other miracles):** A miracle, in this view, is not a \"violation\" of the current laws of nature. Instead, it is an instance of God locally and temporarily setting aside the corrupted current laws and reasserting the original, perfect laws of His creation.\n\nThis specific terminology provides a philosophical model for understanding how the fundamental behavior of the universe could be altered and how divine intervention can occur within that context.\n\n```python\n# This script prints the name of the theologian who developed the specified terminology.\ntheologian = \"Peter van Inwagen\"\nprint(theologian)\n```\n<<<Peter van Inwagen>>>"
