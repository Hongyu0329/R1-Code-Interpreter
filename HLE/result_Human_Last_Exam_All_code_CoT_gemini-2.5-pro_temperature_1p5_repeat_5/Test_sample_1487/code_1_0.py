# Based on the derivation, the squared norm of alpha is ||α||^2 = (1/2) * ( (π^2 / 6) - 1 ).
# Let's define the components of this expression.
pi_squared_over_6 = math.pi**2 / 6
term_in_parenthesis = pi_squared_over_6 - 1

# Calculate the squared norm of alpha.
norm_alpha_squared = 0.5 * term_in_parenthesis

# Now, we compute the final expression given in the problem:
# Expression = (2 * ||α||^2) / ( (π^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10^15
numerator = 2 * norm_alpha_squared
denominator = term_in_parenthesis
second_term = 10**15

# By substitution, the expression simplifies:
# Expression = (2 * 0.5 * ( (π^2 / 6) - 1 )) / ( (π^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10^15
# Expression = ( (π^2 / 6) - 1 ) / ( (π^2 / 6) - 1 ) + 10^15
# Expression = 1 + 10^15
first_term_result = 1

# The final equation consists of the two simplified numbers.
print(f"The calculation simplifies to the final equation:")
print(f"{first_term_result} + {second_term}")

# Calculate the final result.
final_answer = first_term_result + second_term
print("\nThe final result is:")
print(final_answer)
