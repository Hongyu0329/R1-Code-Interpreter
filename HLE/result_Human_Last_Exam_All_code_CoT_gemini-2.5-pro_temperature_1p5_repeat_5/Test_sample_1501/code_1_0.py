    This function provides the solution to the user's question about the nested Steiner Quadruple System doubling construction.

    The reasoning is as follows:

    Part (a): True or False: In the doubling construction, each element of Q x {0, 1} is contained in exactly v - 1 ND-pairs.

    Let's check this statement. Let S' be a nested SQS(2v) on a point set Q'.
    - The number of points in S' is u = 2v.
    - The number of blocks in S' is |B'| = u(u-1)(u-2)/24 = 2v(2v-1)(2v-2)/24 = v(2v-1)(v-1)/6.
    - In a nested SQS, each block corresponds to a partition into two pairs. These are the ND-pairs. The total size of the multiset of ND-pairs is 2 * |B'| = v(2v-1)(v-1)/3.
    - Let r_N(p) be the number of ND-pairs containing a point p. The sum of r_N(p) over all points p in Q' is twice the total number of ND-pairs: sum(r_N(p)) = 2 * (v(2v-1)(v-1)/3).
    - If, as the statement claims, r_N(p) = v - 1 for all 2v points p, then the sum would be 2v * (v - 1).
    - Let's equate the two expressions for the sum:
      2v * (v - 1) = 2 * v(2v-1)(v-1)/3
    - For v >= 4, we can divide both sides by 2v(v-1):
      1 = (2v - 1) / 3
      3 = 2v - 1
      4 = 2v
      v = 2
    - This contradicts the given condition that v >= 4. Thus, the statement is False.

    Part (b): What is the multiplicity of an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} in the resulting nested SQS(2v) if the pair {x, y} had multiplicity mu in the original SQS(v)?

    We refer to the standard doubling construction for nested SQS(v). The ND-pairs in the new SQS(2v) arise from two sources:
    1.  From the original nesting: For each ND-pair {a, b} in the original SQS(v), the construction adds the ND-pairs {(a, 0), (b, 0)} and {(a, 1), (b, 1)} to the new system. This contributes mu to the multiplicity of {(x, 0), (y, 0)}.
    2.  From the 1-factorization of K_v: The construction requires a 1-factorization of K_v. A pair {x, y} appears in exactly one 1-factor. This 1-factor contains v/2 - 1 other pairs. For each of these other pairs, an ND-pair {(x, 0), (y, 0)} is created. This contributes v/2 - 1 to the multiplicity.
    - Summing these contributions, the new multiplicity is mu + v/2 - 1.

    Part (c): Must there exist ND-pairs with multiplicity exactly v in the constructed nested SQS(2v)?

    Using the result from (b), this question is equivalent to asking if there must exist a pair {x, y} in the original SQS(v) such that its multiplicity mu satisfies:
    mu + v/2 - 1 = v
    mu = v - (v/2 - 1)
    mu = v/2 + 1

    So, must a nested SQS(v) always contain a pair {x, y} with ND-pair multiplicity mu = v/2 + 1?
    - Consider v=8. A nested SQS(8) exists. For v=8, the required multiplicity would be mu = 8/2 + 1 = 5.
    - However, there exist "uniform" nested SQS(8) where the multiplicity is the same for all pairs. This uniform multiplicity is mu_avg = (v-2)/6 = (8-2)/6 = 1.
    - In such a system, every pair has multiplicity mu=1. No pair has multiplicity 5.
    - Since we have found a counterexample, the answer is No.
