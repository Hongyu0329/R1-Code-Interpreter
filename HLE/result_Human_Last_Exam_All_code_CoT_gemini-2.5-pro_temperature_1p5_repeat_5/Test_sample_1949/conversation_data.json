    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a Python script that identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's *Aeneid*.\n\nFirst, I will create a list of the major rivers mentioned in the epic poem and their approximate modern lengths. Then, the script will sort these rivers by length in descending order and print the top three.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_aeneid_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n\n    The script contains a dictionary of major rivers mentioned in the poem and their lengths.\n    It sorts them to find the top three and prints the result.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # Sources include mentions on Aeneas's shield (Book VIII), prophecies (Book VI), and other passages.\n    rivers = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Indus (via its tributary Hydaspes)': 3180,\n        'Danube (Ister)': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Ganges': 2525,\n        'Tigris': 1900,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Po (Eridanus)': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406,\n        'Xanthus': 110,\n    }\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order\n    # The key for sorting is the second element (length) of each item (river, length)\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for i, (river, length) in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        print(f\"{i+1}. {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_aeneid_rivers()\n```\n<<<\nThe three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\n1.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
