    "To solve this problem, I will calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval from $x=0$ to $x=4$.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Since the function definition changes at $x=3$, I will split the total integral into two parts:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} p(x) dx + \\int_{3}^{4} p(x) dx $$\n2.  The first part of the integral is for the function $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ over the range $[0, 3]$.\n3.  The second part is for the function $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$ over the range $[3, 4]$.\n4.  I will use Python's `scipy.integrate.quad` function to numerically calculate the value of both definite integrals.\n5.  It is important to note that the second function has a singularity at $x = \\pi$ (approximately 3.14159), because the denominator $1+\\cos(x)$ becomes zero. Since this singularity lies within the integration interval $[3, 4]$, the integral is mathematically divergent. The `scipy.integrate.quad` function will compute a principal value for this integral and will likely raise a warning about the divergence.\n6.  Finally, I will sum the results from both parts to get the final answer and print the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\nimport warnings\n\ndef p1(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    The first piece of the function, defined for 0 <= x <= 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n\ndef p2(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    The second piece of the function, defined for 3 <= x <= 5.\n    \"\"\"\n    return np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x)) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n\n# The integration range is [0, 4]. We split it at x=3.\n\n# 1. Integrate the first part from 0 to 3\nintegral1, error1 = quad(p1, 0, 3)\n\n# 2. Integrate the second part from 3 to 4.\n# This part has a singularity at x=pi, which is in the interval [3, 4].\n# We inform quad about this singularity using the 'points' argument.\n# This will calculate the Cauchy Principal Value.\n# We also catch and print any warnings from the integration routine.\nprint(\"Calculating the integral for the second part of the function from x=3 to x=4.\")\nprint(\"Note: The integrand has a singularity at x=pi (approx 3.14159) within this interval.\")\n\nwith warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"always\")\n    \n    integral2, error2 = quad(p2, 3, 4, points=[np.pi])\n    \n    if w:\n        print(\"\\n--- Warnings from SciPy ---\")\n        for warning_message in w:\n            print(f\"Warning: {warning_message.message}\")\n        print(\"---------------------------\\n\")\n\n# 3.
