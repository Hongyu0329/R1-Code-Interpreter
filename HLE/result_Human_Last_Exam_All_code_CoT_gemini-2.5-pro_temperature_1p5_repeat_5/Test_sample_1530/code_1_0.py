    The poem uses personification to describe a natural phenomenon.
    Key clues include:
    - 'cold': Sets the temperature.
    - 'knits a veil', 'lace', 'feather stitch': Metaphors for creating a delicate, intricate pattern.
    - 'glass': Describes a crystalline, fragile, and transparent substance.
    - This 'veil' forms on plants ('starwort, grass') and is destroyed by the advance of a harsher Autumn ('to fray each feather stitch').

    This collection of imagery perfectly describes the formation of frost on a cold autumn morning.
