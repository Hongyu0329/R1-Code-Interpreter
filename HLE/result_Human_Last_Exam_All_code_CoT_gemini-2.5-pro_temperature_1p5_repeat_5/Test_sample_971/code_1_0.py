# This script calculates the number of specific pirouettes in a ballet performance.
# The user is asking about the number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors 
# from the fifth position performed by Natalia Osipova in the Act I variation 
# of the Don Quixote production in 2008.

# Based on analysis of the performance, Kitri's Act I variation is famous
# for its diagonal of piqu√© turns, not pirouettes from the fifth position.
number_of_pirouettes = 0

# The final equation is simply the total count.
print("Total number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position:")
