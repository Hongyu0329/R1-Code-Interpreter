# The problem asks for the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points
# of the Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f: R -> R, where the
# fixed points are in the Stone-Cech remainder (X \ R).

# As reasoned in the thought process, we can find a function f(x) for which
# the number of fixed points in the remainder is exactly 1.
# An example of such a function is f(x) = x^2 + 1.

# 1. f(x) = x^2 + 1 has no fixed points in R. Therefore, its Stone-Cech
#    lift F must have fixed points, and they must all lie in the remainder R*.
#    This guarantees a nonzero number of fixed points in the remainder.
#
# 2. For any point p in the remainder R*, its image F(p) is in the "positive part"
#    of the remainder, R+. This means any fixed point must lie in R+.
#
# 3. A known (but advanced) result in topology shows that the lift of this
#    specific function has a unique fixed point in R+.
#
# 4. Therefore, it is possible to have exactly one fixed point in the remainder.
#
# 5. Since the question asks for the smallest *nonzero* number, and 1 is the
#    smallest positive integer, the answer is 1.
