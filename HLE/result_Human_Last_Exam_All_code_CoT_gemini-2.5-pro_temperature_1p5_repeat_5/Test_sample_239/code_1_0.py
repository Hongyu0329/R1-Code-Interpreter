# --- Analysis and Calculation for the Four Questions ---

# 1. How many lines of code have compiler errors?
# Analysis:
# - Line 3: `unsigned long long` is not a defined type in XVM's C compiler. (Error 1)
# - Line 4: `scanf` uses `%d` (for a 'digit' type) for variables that should be `unsigned long`. The correct specifier is `%n`. (Error 2)
# - Line 9: `printf` uses `%d` for a result that is `unsigned long`. The correct specifier is `%n`. (Error 3)
# There are errors on 3 distinct lines.
q1_answer = 3

# 2. What is the total memory (in D) used for variables in an optimized version?
# An optimized version avoids branching and uses the minimum necessary variables.
# - n (up to 4*10^9) requires 'unsigned long' (12D).
# - m (up to 4*10^9) requires 'unsigned long' (12D).
# - a (up to 10^6) requires 'unsigned int' (6D).
mem_n = 12
mem_m = 12
mem_a = 6
q2_answer = mem_n + mem_m + mem_a

# 3. Can this problem be solved without branching statements?
# Yes, by using the ceiling division formula: (n + a - 1) // a
q3_answer = 'Y'

# 4. What is the expected output for m = n = 4*10^9 and a = 1?
n_val = 4000000000
m_val = 4000000000
a_val = 1
# Number of flagstones for n-side = ceil(n/a)
na_val = math.ceil(n_val / a_val)
# Number of flagstones for m-side = ceil(m/a)
ma_val = math.ceil(m_val / a_val)
q4_answer = na_val * ma_val
