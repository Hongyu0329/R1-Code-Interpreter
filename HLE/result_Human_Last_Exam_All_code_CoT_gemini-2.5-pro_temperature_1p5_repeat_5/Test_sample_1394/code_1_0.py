# The general solution to the differential equation is y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9.
# We will present this equation to the user.
# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
# Let's consider the form: 1*y^2 - C*x^2 - 1*C^2 - 1*C - 9 = 0
# The numbers are the coefficients and powers that are explicit integers.
# Powers of y, x, C are 2. Coefficients are 1. The constant is 9.
