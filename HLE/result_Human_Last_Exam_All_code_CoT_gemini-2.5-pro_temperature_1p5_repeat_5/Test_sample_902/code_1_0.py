    print("-" * 30)

    print("\nStep 1: Analyzing the Function")
    print(f"The pseudo-code defines a function, let's call it `f(n)`, where `f({n})` would compute a value we'll call `V`.")
    print("This value `V` is `Huge_int + 1`, where `Huge_int` is the largest integer returned by any Python program whose source code is less than n symbols long.")
    print(f"So, for your question, we are considering all Python programs shorter than {n} symbols.")
    print("This task is a classic example of an uncomputable problem, related to the Halting Problem.")

    print("\nStep 2: The Proof by Contradiction")
    print("Let's assume, for the sake of argument, that a program `P` to compute `def_superfast(10000)` *could* exist.")
    print("This program `P` would, by definition, run, halt, and return the integer value `V = def_superfast(10000)`.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Paradox")
    print("Now, let's think about the source code of our hypothetical program `P`.")
    print("A program to implement this logic would be complex, but it's conceivable it could be written with a source code length `L` less than 10000 symbols.")
    
    print(f"\nIf the length of program `P` is less than {n} symbols:")
    print(f"1. `P` is a Python program with source code less than {n} symbols.")
    print("2. `P` halts and returns an integer (`V`).")
    print("3. Therefore, `P` is one of the very programs that the `def_superfast` function must consider when finding `Huge_int`!")

    print("\nThis leads to a direct contradiction:")
    print("The value `V` that `P` returns must be less than or equal to the maximum of all considered programs. The maximum value is `Huge_int`.")
    print("This gives us the inequality: `V <= Huge_int`.")
    
    print("\nBut, by the function's own definition, `V = Huge_int + 1`.")
    
    print("\nIf we substitute the definition into the inequality, we get the following equation:")
    print(f"{equation_var_1} <= {equation_var_2}")
    
    print("\nThis simplifies to `1 <= 0`, which is a logical impossibility.")

    print("\nStep 4: Conclusion")
    print("The contradiction (`1 <= 0`) proves our initial assumption must be false.")
    print("Our assumption was that a program `P` (with length < 10000) could compute `def_superfast(10000)`.")
    print("Therefore, no such program can exist.")
    print("\n(Note: Even if `P` were longer than 10000 symbols, the function is fundamentally uncomputable. There is no algorithm that can examine arbitrary code and determine if it halts and what it returns, so `Huge_int` can never be calculated.)")
