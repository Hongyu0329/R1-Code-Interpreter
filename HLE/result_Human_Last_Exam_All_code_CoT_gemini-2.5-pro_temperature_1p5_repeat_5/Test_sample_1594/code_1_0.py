# This script determines the letter formed by the buildings of
# Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini in Pisa.

# By analyzing the satellite view of the two adjacent schools on a map,
# one can see their main buildings are arranged perpendicularly.
# The long building of Liceo Dini forms the vertical part,
# and the long building of Galilei-Pacinotti forms the horizontal part.

# The resulting shape is the letter 'L'.

formed_letter = "L"
