    "A category with a single object is known as a monoid. The object's endomorphisms (morphisms from the object to itself) are the elements of the monoid, and the monoid's binary operation is the composition of these morphisms.\n\nThe problem asks for the number of categories with 3 morphisms and one object, up to isomorphism. This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n\nA monoid must have an identity element. In a category, each object must have an identity morphism. Therefore, one of the three morphisms must be the identity, let's call it `id`. The other two morphisms can be named `f` and `g`. Our set of elements is `{id, f, g}`.\n\nThe structure of the monoid is determined by its multiplication table (the composition of morphisms). The row and column for `id` are fixed by the identity property (`id o x = x o id = x`). This leaves the compositions of `f` and `g` with each other to be determined: `f o f`, `f o g`, `g o f`, and `g o g`. Each of these four compositions can result in `id`, `f`, or `g`.\n\nMy plan to solve this is as follows:\n1.  Represent the morphisms as integers `{0, 1, 2}`, with `0` as the identity `id`.\n2.  Iterate through all `3^4 = 81` possible multiplication tables for the non-identity elements.\n3.  For each of the 81 potential tables, check if it satisfies the associativity law: `(a o b) o c = a o (b o c)`.\n4.  The valid, associative tables represent all possible monoids of order 3.\n5.  To handle isomorphisms, we find a \"canonical\" representation for each monoid. Two monoids are isomorphic if the multiplication table of one can be transformed into the other by swapping the labels of the non-identity elements (`f` and `g`). We will generate both versions for each valid monoid and choose the lexicographically smaller one as its canonical form.\n6.  By storing these canonical forms in a set, we can count the number of unique (non-isomorphic) ones.\n7.  Finally, I will count how many of these unique monoids are commutative and how many are non-commutative to present a more detailed result.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_monoids():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    This corresponds to the number of categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]  # 0: identity, 1: f, 2: g\n    canonical_monoids = set()\n\n    # Iterate through all 3^4 = 81 possible ways to define the\n    # multiplication table for the non-identity elements.\n    for p in itertools.product(elements, repeat=4):\n        # Build the full 3x3 multiplication table\n        # 0 is the identity, so table[0][j]=j and table[i][0]=i\n        table = [\n            [0, 1, 2],\n            [1, p[0], p[1]], # f o f = p[0], f o g = p[1]\n            [2, p[2], p[3]]  # g o f = p[2], g o g = p[3]\n        ]\n\n        # Check for associativity: (a*b)*c == a*(b*c)\n        is_associative = True\n        for a in elements:\n            for b in elements:\n                for c in elements:\n                    if not is_associative: break\n                    lhs = table[table[a][b]][c] # (a o b) o c\n                    rhs = table[a][table[b][c]] # a o (b o c)\n                    if lhs != rhs:\n                        is_associative = False\n            if not is_associative: break\n        \n        if is_associative:\n            # This is a valid monoid.
