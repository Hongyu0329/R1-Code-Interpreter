    "The total number of primitive Gaussians in the 6-311G** basis set depends on the specific atoms in a molecule. The notation breaks down as follows:\n\n*   **For Hydrogen atoms:** The `311G` part describes the 1s orbital with a total of 3+1+1 = 5 primitive s-type Gaussians. The second `*` adds a set of 3 uncontracted p-type polarization functions. This gives a total of `5 + 3 = 8` primitive Gaussians for each Hydrogen atom.\n*   **For \"heavy\" atoms (non-Hydrogen) in the 2nd period (Li-Ne):** The `6` means the 1s core orbital is described by 6 primitives. The `311` describes the valence 2s and 2p orbitals, contributing 20 primitives (5 for the 2s orbital and 5 for each of the three 2p orbitals). The first `*` adds a set of 6 uncontracted d-type polarization functions. This gives a total of `6 + 20 + 6 = 32` primitive Gaussians for each 2nd-period heavy atom.\n*   **For \"heavy\" atoms in the 3rd period (Na-Ar):** The composition is more complex. Based on the standard definitions in the Basis Set Exchange library, the 6-311G part corresponds to 42 primitive Gaussians. The `*` adds 6 d-type functions. This gives a total of `42 + 6 = 48` primitive Gaussians for each 3rd-period heavy atom.\n\nSince you have not provided a molecule, I will provide a Python script that calculates the total number of primitive Gaussians for a given molecular formula. I have used acetic acid (C₂H₄O₂) as an example. You can modify the `molecular_formula` variable in the script to perform the calculation for any other molecule.\n\n```python\nimport re\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef calculate_primitive_gaussians(molecular_formula):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the total number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G**\n    basis set for a given molecular formula.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of primitive Gaussians per atom for the 6-311G** basis set.\n    # H: (3+1+1)s + 1p(3) = 8\n    # Period 2 (Li-Ne): 6(core) + (3+1+1)s + 3*(3+1+1)p + 1d(6) = 6 + 5 + 15 + 6 = 32\n    # Period 3 (Na-Ar): 42 (from BSE) + 1d(6) = 48\n    primitives_per_atom = {\n        # Period 1\n        'H': 8, 'He': 8,\n        # Period 2\n        'Li': 32, 'Be': 32, 'B': 32, 'C': 32, 'N': 32, 'O': 32, 'F': 32, 'Ne': 32,\n        # Period 3\n        'Na': 48, 'Mg': 48, 'Al': 48, 'Si': 48, 'P': 48, 'S': 48, 'Cl': 48, 'Ar': 48\n    }\n\n    # --- Parse the molecular formula ---\n    # This regex finds atom symbols (e.g., H, C, Cl) followed by an optional number.\n    parts = re.findall(r'([A-Z][a-z]?)(\\d*)', molecular_formula)\n    \n    # Create a Counter dictionary to store the count of each atom.\n    # e.g., 'C2H4O2' -> {'C': 2, 'H': 4, 'O': 2}\n    atom_counts = Counter()\n    for symbol, count in parts:\n        count = int(count) if count else 1\n        atom_counts[symbol] += count\n\n    # --- Calculate and Print the Result ---\n    total_primitives = 0\n    calculation_steps = []\n    \n    print(f\"Molecule: {molecular_formula}\")\n    print(\"Basis Set: 6-311G**\")\n    print(\"---\")\n    print(\"Calculation:\")\n    \n    # Sort atoms for consistent output order (e.g., C, H, O)\n    sorted_atoms = sorted(atom_counts.keys())\n\n    for atom_symbol in sorted_atoms:\n        if atom_symbol not in primitives_per_atom:\n            print(f\"Warning: Atom '{atom_symbol}' is not supported by this script.
