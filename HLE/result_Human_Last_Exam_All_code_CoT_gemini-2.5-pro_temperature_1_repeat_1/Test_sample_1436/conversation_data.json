    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the symmetry factor for the specified Feynman diagram, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Diagram's Topology:** The problem describes a Feynman diagram with two vertices and four field contractions (propagators). In a typical theory like $\\phi^4$, where each vertex has four legs, a connected diagram with two vertices and four propagators must have all four propagators connecting the first vertex to the second one.\n\n2.  **Understand the Symmetry Factor:** The symmetry factor, denoted by 'S', is a combinatorial number that corrects for overcounting when calculating the value of a Feynman diagram. It is equal to the number of permutations of the vertices and internal lines that leave the diagram's structure (topology) unchanged.\n\n3.  **Calculate Symmetries:** I will calculate the total symmetry factor by multiplying the contributions from two distinct types of symmetries in this diagram:\n    *   **Vertex Permutations:** The two vertices are identical (as they represent the same interaction term in the Lagrangian). Therefore, swapping them results in the same diagram. This contributes a factor of $2!$.\n    *   **Propagator Permutations:** The four propagators connecting the two vertices are also identical. They can be interchanged with each other without altering the diagram. This contributes a factor of $4!$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation:** The total symmetry factor 'S' is the product of the vertex symmetry and the propagator symmetry.\n\n5.  **Python Implementation:** I will write a Python script that calculates these factorial values, multiplies them, and prints a clear explanation of each step along with the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factor():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factor for a Feynman diagram with two vertices\n    connected by four propagators.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Number of identical vertices that can be permuted\n    num_vertices = 2\n    # Number of identical propagators connecting the vertices\n    num_propagators = 4\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting vertices\n    vertex_symmetry = math.factorial(num_vertices)\n\n    # Calculate the symmetry factor from permuting propagators\n    propagator_symmetry = math.factorial(num_propagators)\n\n    # The total symmetry factor is the product of these individual symmetries\n    total_symmetry_factor = vertex_symmetry * propagator_symmetry\n\n    print(\"This script calculates the symmetry factor (S) for a Feynman diagram with 2 vertices connected by 4 propagators.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Explain vertex symmetry\n    print(\"Step 1: Calculate the symmetry from permuting identical vertices.\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_vertices} identical vertices that can be swapped, leading to a factor of {num_vertices}!.\")\n    print(f\"Vertex Symmetry Factor = {vertex_symmetry}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Explain propagator symmetry\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the symmetry from permuting identical propagators.\")\n    print(f\"There are {num_propagators} identical propagators connecting the vertices, which can be interchanged.\")\n    print(f\"This leads to a factor of {num_propagators}!.\")\n    print(f\"Propagator Symmetry Factor = {propagator_symmetry}\")\n    print(\"\")\n\n    # Explain and show the final calculation\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the total symmetry factor.\")\n    print(\"The total symmetry factor S is the product of the vertex and propagator symmetries.\")\n    print(\"S = (Vertex Symmetry) * (Propagator Symmetry)\")\n    print(f\"S = {vertex_symmetry} * {propagator_symmetry}\")\n    print(f\"S = {total_symmetry_factor}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"The final symmetry factor for the diagram is {total_symmetry_factor}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_symmetry_factor()\n```\n<<<48>>>"
