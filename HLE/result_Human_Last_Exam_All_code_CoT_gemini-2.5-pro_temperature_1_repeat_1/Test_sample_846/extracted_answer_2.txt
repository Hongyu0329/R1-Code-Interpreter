To be functionally accurate, the picnic table should be in a flat, extended shape during the night (its stable *trans* form). When the sun rises and exposes it to UV light, the table should physically bend or fold into a V-shape (*cis* form). When the sun sets and the UV light is gone, it should slowly relax and flatten back out into its original extended shape for the night.
