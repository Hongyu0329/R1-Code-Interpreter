    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ whose dimension is strictly less than 500,000.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Partitions and Irreps**: The irreducible representations of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers. For our case, $n=25$.\n2.  **Dimension Calculation**: The dimension of an irrep corresponding to a partition $\\lambda$ can be calculated using the Hook-Length Formula. The formula is $d_\\lambda = n! / H_\\lambda$, where $H_\\lambda$ is the product of the hook lengths of all cells in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$.\n3.  **Algorithm**:\n    *   Generate all possible partitions of the number 25.\n    *   For each partition, construct its Young diagram and calculate the product of all its hook lengths.\n    *   Use the hook-length formula to compute the dimension of the corresponding irrep.\n    *   Check if the calculated dimension is less than 500,000.\n    *   Count the number of partitions that satisfy this condition.\n4.  **Implementation**: I will use a Python script to perform these steps. Python's ability to handle arbitrarily large integers is crucial here, as $25!$ is a very large number. The script will:\n    *   Have a function to generate all partitions of 25.\n    *   Have a function to calculate the dimension for each partition.\n    *   Iterate through all partitions, calculate their dimensions, and count how many are below the threshold of 500,000.\n    *   Print the partitions and their dimensions that meet the criteria.\n    *   Finally, print the total count.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_s25_irreps():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and counts the irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group S_25\n    that have a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def _generate_partitions_recursive(target, max_val, current_partition, results_list):\n        \"\"\"Helper function to generate partitions recursively.\"\"\"\n        if target == 0:\n            results_list.append(list(current_partition))\n            return\n\n        if target < 0 or max_val == 0:\n            return\n\n        # Explore partitions by choosing the next part, ensuring non-increasing order.\n        for part in range(min(target, max_val), 0, -1):\n            current_partition.append(part)\n            _generate_partitions_recursive(target - part, part, current_partition, results_list)\n            current_partition.pop()\n\n    def get_all_partitions(n):\n        \"\"\"Returns a list of all partitions of n.\"\"\"\n        results = []\n        _generate_partitions_recursive(n, n, [], results)\n        return results\n\n    def calculate_dimension(partition, n_factorial):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the dimension of the irrep for a given partition using the hook-length formula.\n        \"\"\"\n        product_of_hooks = 1\n        # The partition is a list of integers, e.g., [5, 4, 1]\n        for i, part_i in enumerate(partition):  # row index i\n            for j in range(part_i):  # col index j\n                # Calculate hook length for cell (i, j)\n                # 1.
