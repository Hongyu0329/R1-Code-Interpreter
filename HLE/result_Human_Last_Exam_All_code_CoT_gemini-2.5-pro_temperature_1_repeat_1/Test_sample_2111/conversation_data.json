    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe conceptual entity you're asking about is the \"world-economy\" (*Ã©conomie-monde*). Fernand Braudel developed this concept to describe a large, self-contained geographic area with a high degree of internal economic integration and a single dominant center (a \"core\" city). This structure, with its core, semi-periphery, and periphery, can be metaphorically inscribed within a sphere, representing a self-sufficient economic world.\n\nHere is a Python script that performs a simple analysis of the letters in this term. The plan is to count the total letters, vowels, and consonants in the phrase \"worldeconomy\" and then display the result as an addition equation.\n\n```python\n# The term to be analyzed, based on the answer to the user's question.\n# The hyphen is removed for a simpler character analysis.\nterm = \"worldeconomy\"\n\n# Define the set of vowels for easy checking.\nvowels = \"aeiou\"\n\n# 1. Calculate the total number of letters.\ntotal_letters = len(term)\n\n# 2. Count the number of vowels in the term.\nvowel_count = 0\nfor char in term:\n    if char in vowels:\n        vowel_count += 1\n\n# 3. Calculate the number of consonants.\nconsonant_count = total_letters - vowel_count\n\n# 4. Print the final equation showing the relationship between the counts.\n# The output will display each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"Analysis of the term '{term}':\")\nprint(f\"Total Letters = Vowels + Consonants\")\nprint(f\"{total_letters} = {vowel_count} + {consonant_count}\")\n\n```\n<<<world-economy>>>"
