        "`jna`        -> Possessed noun: `j-` (my) + `na` (house) = 'my house'.",
        "`junabi`     -> Time reference: `jun` (one) + `abil` (year) = 'last year'.",

        "--------------------------------",
        "The sentence combines these elements to mean: 'There was talk/discussion in the native language at my house last year'.",
        "The phrase `'ox k'op` (literally 'three talks') is likely an idiom for 'a discussion' or 'some talk' in this context.",

        "------------------------------------",
        "A. Incorrect location ('our village' instead of 'my house').",
        "B. Incorrect location ('my village') and time ('yesterday').",
        "C. Unrelated content.",
        "D. Close, but option H is slightly more precise.",
        "E. Unrelated content.",
        "F. Incorrect location ('house of God').",
        "G. Incomplete; it's missing the location ('at my house').",
        "H. Correct. It accurately translates all components: `Oy` (There was), `k'op` (talk), `batz'i k'op` (my native language), `ta jna` (at my house), and `junabi` (last year).",
