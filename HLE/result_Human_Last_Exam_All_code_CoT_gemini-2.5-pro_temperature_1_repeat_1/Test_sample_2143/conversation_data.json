    "Here is my thinking process to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Riddle:** I'll break down the user's request into key clues:\n    *   **\"HE\"**: A specific, well-known male figure.\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: The activity described happened near the end of his life or career, likely in a final, major piece of work.\n    *   **\"addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: This strongly alludes to the Tenth Commandment (\"Thou shalt not covet...\"), which deals with desiring things belonging to others.\n    *   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the most complex clue. \"Prohibition against representation\" points to the Second Commandment (\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image\"). \"Ignoring\" it could be literal, but it's more likely metaphorical. It suggests a method or worldview that, by its nature, delves into things that are considered un-representable or forbidden to be depicted.\n    *   **\"According to Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This suggests the answer is an academic or intellectual figure, whose work is subject to scholarly interpretation. The name itself may be a clue or a red herring.\n\n2.  **Initial Hypothesis (Moses):** The clues about the commandments immediately bring Moses to mind. He delivered the commandments. However, the clue about \"ignoring the prohibition against representation\" doesn't fit well. Moses *delivered* this prohibition; he didn't ignore it. The \"end of his work\" also fits, as the law was given after the Exodus. But the \"interpretation\" clue makes it feel less like a direct historical/religious figure and more like an analyst of that figure.\n\n3.  **Second Hypothesis (Sigmund Freud):** This seems much more promising. Let's test the clues against him:\n    *   **\"HE\"**: Sigmund Freud.\n    *   **\"at the end of HIS work\"**: Freud's last major book was *Moses and Monotheism*, published in 1939, the year he died. This fits perfectly.\n    *   **\"addressed the issue of another's material possessions\"**: In *Moses and Monotheism*, Freud analyzes the origins and psychological meaning of the Ten Commandments, including the one against coveting.\n    *   **\"naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation\"**: This is the masterstroke of the riddle. Psychoanalysis, Freud's life's work, is precisely the practice of representing the unrepresentableâ€”the unconscious, repressed thoughts, dreams, and desires. His entire method \"naturally ignores\" the mind's own \"prohibition\" (repression) against representing these hidden elements. Therefore, the author of a work about Moses is himself famous for a method that metaphorically aligns with breaking the Second Commandment.\n    *   **\"Veronika Campan's interpretation\"**: This frames the riddle as a scholarly puzzle, which is appropriate for a figure like Freud. The name itself isn't prominent, suggesting it's part of the riddle's flavor rather than a required search term.\n\n4.  **The \"Equation\" Constraint:** The prompt includes a strange, likely misplaced, instruction: \"Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\". To satisfy this odd requirement, I'll create a simple equation relevant to the answer. Since Freud's work *Moses and Monotheism* is composed of three distinct essays, a simple and relevant equation is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`. This connects the constraint to the evidence for the solution.\n\n5.  **Final Plan:** The code will first print the full name \"Sigmund Freud\". Then, on a new line, it will print the equation \"1 + 1 + 1 = 3\" to satisfy the final constraint of the prompt.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle by identifying the historical figure and\n    printing his name, along with an equation related to his work as\n    requested by the prompt.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The riddle points to Sigmund Freud. His final work, \"Moses and Monotheism\",\n    # deals with the Ten Commandments. Psychoanalysis, his life's work,\n    # metaphorically \"ignores the prohibition against representation\" by\n    # bringing the unconscious to light.\n    full_name = \"Sigmund Freud\"\n    print(full_name)\n\n    # The prompt requires outputting numbers in an equation.\n    # Freud's book \"Moses and Monotheism\" is composed of three essays.\n    # The equation 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 represents this structure.\n    # This line outputs the numbers 1, 1, 1, and 3, which are all part of the final equation.\n    print(\"1 + 1 + 1 = 3\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Sigmund Freud>>>"
