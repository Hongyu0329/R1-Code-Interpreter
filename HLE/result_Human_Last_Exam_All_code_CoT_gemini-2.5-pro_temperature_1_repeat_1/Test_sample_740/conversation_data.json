    "An elegant explanation of your method is a good practice.\nThe user wants to find the values of λ for which the given integral equation has no solutions.\n\n### Method Explanation\n\nThe given equation is a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:\n$u(x) = f(x) + λ \\int_a^b K(x,y) u(y) dy$\nwhere $f(x) = 1$ and the kernel is $K(x,y) = \\frac{x^n - y^n}{x - y}$.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Kernel**: The kernel can be simplified to a sum:\n    $K(x,y) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + \\dots + y^{n-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} y^k$.\n    This is a symmetric kernel, meaning $K(x,y) = K(y,x)$, which implies the integral operator $L[u] = \\int_0^1 K(x,y)u(y)dy$ is self-adjoint.\n\n2.  **Form of the Solution**: The integral equation can be written as $u(x) = 1 + λ \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k x^{n-1-k}$, where $c_k = \\int_0^1 y^k u(y)dy$ are constants. This shows that any solution $u(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$.\n\n3.  **Fredholm Alternative**: For a self-adjoint operator, the equation $u - λLu = f$ has a solution if and only if the function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to all eigenfunctions of $L$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\mu = 1/λ$. If the condition is not met, there is no solution.\n    In our case, $f(x)=1$. A solution does not exist if $\\lambda$ is a characteristic value (i.e., $\\lambda=1/\\mu$ for some eigenvalue $\\mu$ of $L$) AND the corresponding eigenfunction $u(x)$ is not orthogonal to $f(x)=1$. That is, $\\int_0^1 1 \\cdot u(x) dx \\neq 0$.\n\n4.  **Eigenfunctions and Their Integrals**: Let's analyze the properties of an eigenfunction $u(x)$ of the operator $L$.\n    The eigenvalue equation is $L[u] = \\mu u$.\n    Since $u(x)$ is a polynomial, let's say of degree $m \\le n-1$, its leading coefficient is $a_m$.\n    The operator $L$ applied to $u$ gives $L[u](x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^{n-1-k} \\int_0^1 y^k u(y)dy$. The leading term (the one with $x^{n-1}$) has the coefficient $\\int_0^1 y^0 u(y)dy = \\int_0^1 u(y)dy$.\n    -   If $\\int_0^1 u(y)dy \\neq 0$, then $L[u](x)$ is a polynomial of degree exactly $n-1$.\n    -   If $u(x)$ is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue $\\mu \\ne 0$, then $L[u]=\\mu u$ implies that $u(x)$ and $L[u](x)$ must have the same degree. This forces the degree of $u(x)$ to be $n-1$.\n    -   Equating the leading coefficients of $L[u]=\\mu u$, we get: $\\int_0^1 u(y)dy = \\mu \\cdot a_{n-1}$, where $a_{n-1}$ is the leading coefficient of $u(x)$.\n    -   Since $u(x)$ is a non-zero eigenfunction of degree $n-1$, $a_{n-1} \\neq 0$. The operator $L$ is invertible (maps the basis of polynomials $\\{1, x, \\dots, x^{n-1}\\}$ to a set of linearly independent polynomials), so its eigenvalues $\\mu$ are non-zero.\n    -   Therefore, $\\int_0^1 u(y)dy = \\mu a_{n-1} \\neq 0$.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: For any eigenvalue $\\mu$ of the operator $L$, the corresponding eigenfunction $u(x)$ has a non-zero integral. According to the Fredholm alternative, this means that for any characteristic value $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$, the equation has **no solution**.\n\n6.  **Finding the Eigenvalues**: The problem reduces to finding the eigenvalues of the operator $L$. By substituting $u(x) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_j x^j$ into the eigenvalue equation, we can convert it into an $n \\times n$ matrix eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalues of this matrix are the eigenvalues of the operator $L$.\n    Let's define the moments of $u(x)$ as $c_j = \\int_0^1 y^j u(y) dy$. The problem can be formulated as a matrix eigenvalue problem $A\\vec{c} = \\mu \\vec{c}$, where the matrix $A$ has elements $A_{jk} = \\frac{1}{j+n-k}$ for $j, k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\n\nSince the problem is stated with a general integer `n`, a numerical solution for a specific `n` is appropriate. I will provide a Python script that calculates these values of $\\lambda$ for a chosen value of $n$, for instance, $n=4$.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_for_lambda(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the values of lambda for which the integral equation has no solution\n    for a given integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        print(\"Error: n must be a positive integer.\")\n        return\n\n    # Create the n x n matrix A\n    A = np.zeros((n, n))\n    for j in range(n):\n        for k in range(n):\n            A[j, k] = 1 / (j + n - k)\n\n    # Find the eigenvalues of A\n    # These are the eigenvalues mu of the integral operator\n    try:\n        mu_values = np.linalg.eigvals(A)\n    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:\n        print(\"Error: Eigenvalue computation failed.\")\n        return\n\n    # The values of lambda for which no solution exists are 1/mu\n    lambda_values = 1 / mu_values\n\n    print(f\"For n = {n}, the integral equation has no solutions for the following values of lambda:\")\n    # Sort the values for consistent output\n    for val in sorted(lambda_values.real):\n         print(val)\n\n# The problem is stated for a general n.
