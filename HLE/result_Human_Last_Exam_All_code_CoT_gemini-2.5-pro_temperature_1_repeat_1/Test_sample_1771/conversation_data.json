    "Here is my step-by-step plan to trace the etymology of the provided Proto-Indo-European verb through the specified Germanic languages.\n\n1.  **Analyze the PIE form:** I will start with the PIE verb `*seh₂gieti`. I'll identify the root as `*seh₂g-` and determine its meaning, 'to track' or 'to give a sign', with the help of the provided cognates.\n\n2.  **Trace to Proto-Germanic:** I will apply the known sound changes from PIE to Proto-Germanic.\n    *   **Grimm's Law:** The voiced stop `*g` will become a voiceless stop `*k`.\n    *   **Vocalism:** The root will be reflected in its o-grade (`*soh₂g-`), where the combination of `*o` and the laryngeal `*h₂` yields a long `*ō`.\n    *   This results in the Proto-Germanic root `*sōk-`. I will reconstruct the full verb form, which is `*sōkijaną`, meaning 'to seek'.\n\n3.  **Trace to Daughter Languages:** From the Proto-Germanic form `*sōkijaną`, I will derive the forms in the daughter languages by applying the specific sound laws for each one.\n    *   **Old Norse:** The primary change is **i-umlaut**, where the `*j` in the suffix fronts the root vowel `*ō` to `*ǿ`. This gives `sǿkja`.\n    *   **Old English:** Two changes occur: **i-umlaut** (fronting `*ō` to `*ē`) and **palatalization** (shifting `*k` to `ċ` /tʃ/ before the new front vowel). This gives `sēċan`.\n    *   **Old High German:** Two different changes apply: **diphthongization** of the long vowel `*ō` to `uo` and **West Germanic gemination** of `*kj` to `hh` /xx/. This gives `suohhan`.\n\n4.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will write a Python script that programmatically prints this entire derivation step-by-step, explaining each sound law and showing the resulting form for each language. The script will conclude with a clear summary of all the derived words.\n\n```python\ndef trace_etymology():\n    \"\"\"\n    Traces the development of a PIE root through Germanic languages\n    and prints the step-by-step derivation.\n    \"\"\"\n    pie_verb = \"*seh₂gieti\"\n    pgmc_verb = \"*sōkijaną\"\n    on_verb = \"sǿkja\"\n    oe_verb = \"sēċan\"\n    ohg_verb = \"suohhan\"\n\n    print(f\"This analysis traces the PIE verb {pie_verb} to its descendants in several old Germanic languages.\")\n    print(\"The meaning evolved from 'giving a sign/tracking' to 'to seek'.\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 1: From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic ---\n    print(\"1.
