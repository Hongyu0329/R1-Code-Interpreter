    print("Step 1: Understanding the core question.")
    print("The question asks for the dominant factor that maintains a relatively constant genomic mutation rate (U) per generation.")
    print("This rate is a trait that has evolved and is subject to evolutionary pressures.")

    print("\nStep 2: Analyzing the options based on evolutionary theory.")
    print("Choice A is 'Natural selection for fitness optimality'.")
    print("  - A high mutation rate leads to a high 'mutational load' of harmful mutations, which reduces the average fitness of a population.")
    print("  - A very low mutation rate is metabolically expensive to maintain, as it requires high-fidelity DNA replication and repair systems. This cost also reduces fitness.")
    print("  - Therefore, natural selection is thought to favor a mutation rate that represents an optimal trade-off between these two opposing costs. This provides a strong stabilizing force.")

    print("\nChoices B, C, D, and E are less suitable explanations for stability:")
    print("  - B (Genetic Drift): Causes random allele frequency changes; it does not maintain constancy.")
    print("  - C (Beneficial/Deleterious Equilibrium): The key balance is between the cost of deleterious mutations and the cost of preventing them, not between beneficial and deleterious mutations themselves.")
    print("  - D (Homogeneous Distribution): Describes the spatial pattern of mutations, not the overall rate.")
    print("  - E (Stochastic Nature): Describes the random occurrence of single mutations, not the evolutionary force stabilizing the average rate.")

    print("\nStep 3: Illustrating the 'optimality' trade-off with a simple equation.")
    print("We can represent this concept as selection maximizing a net fitness value:")
    print("Net Fitness = (Benefit from reduced mutation load) - (Metabolic Cost of fidelity)")

    # Assigning arbitrary numbers to illustrate the concept as requested by the prompt.
    benefit_from_fidelity = 100.0
    metabolic_cost = 15.0
    print(f"For a given mutation rate, let's imagine the 'benefit' from avoiding harmful mutations is {benefit_from_fidelity}.")
    print(f"Let's imagine the associated 'cost' of the repair machinery is {metabolic_cost}.")
    net_fitness_value = benefit_from_fidelity - metabolic_cost
    print(f"The illustrative 'Net Fitness' equation is: {benefit_from_fidelity} - {metabolic_cost} = {net_fitness_value}")
    print("Natural selection acts to find a mutation rate where a similar net value is maximized.")

    print("\nConclusion: The most encompassing explanation is that natural selection maintains the mutation rate at a fitness optimum, balancing competing costs.")
