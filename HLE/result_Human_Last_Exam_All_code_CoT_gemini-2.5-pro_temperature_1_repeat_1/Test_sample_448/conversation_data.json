    "To determine the rarest noble gas on Earth as a percentage of all terrestrial matter, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Noble Gases:** The noble gases are Helium (He), Neon (Ne), Argon (Ar), Krypton (Kr), Xenon (Xe), and Radon (Rn).\n2.  **Gather Abundance Data:** I will find the typical abundance for each noble gas. While the question asks for the percentage in \"all terrestrial matter,\" the most standardized and comparable values are for atmospheric concentration by volume. This relative rarity holds true even when considering the Earth's crust, as Radon is not a primordial gas and only exists in tiny, transient amounts from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium.\n3.  **Compare Abundances:** I will compare the percentage values to identify the smallest one. Radon's short half-life ensures its concentration is many orders of magnitude lower than any other noble gas. A common estimate for its atmospheric abundance is about 1 part in 10^21.\n4.  **Calculate the Percentage:** I will convert the abundance of the rarest gas into a percentage. An abundance of 1 part in 10^21 is equivalent to (1 / 10^21) * 100, which is 1e-19 %.\n5.  **Construct Python Code:** I will write a Python script that stores these abundance percentages in a dictionary, programmatically finds the minimum value, and prints a clear statement identifying the rarest gas and its percentage, including the numbers used in the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_rarest_noble_gas():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the rarest noble gas on Earth based on its\n    atmospheric abundance and calculates its percentage.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Noble gas abundances in Earth's atmosphere as a percentage by volume.\n    # The data for 2002 is virtually identical to current standard values for this purpose.\n    # Radon's abundance is an estimate (approx. 1 part in 10^21), as it varies and is extremely low.\n    noble_gas_abundance_percent = {\n        'Helium': 5.24e-4,\n        'Neon': 1.818e-3,\n        'Argon': 0.934,\n        'Krypton': 1.14e-4,\n        'Xenon': 8.7e-6,\n        'Radon': 1e-19\n    }\n\n    # Find the gas with the minimum abundance.\n    rarest_gas_name = min(noble_gas_abundance_percent, key=noble_gas_abundance_percent.get)\n    rarest_gas_percentage = noble_gas_abundance_percent[rarest_gas_name]\n\n    # The abundance of Radon is estimated at 1 part per 10^21.\n    # The calculation for its percentage is (1 / 10^21) * 100.\n    part = 1\n    total_parts = \"10^21\" # Represented as a string for clear printing\n    percentage_multiplier = 100\n\n    print(f\"The rarest noble gas on Earth is {rarest_gas_name}.\")\n    print(f\"Its approximate atmospheric abundance is {rarest_gas_percentage}%.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThis percentage is calculated from its estimated abundance of 1 part per 10^21:\")\n    # Using scientific notation for the result for readability\n    print(f\"Equation: ({part} / {total_parts}) * {percentage_multiplier} = {rarest_gas_percentage:.1e}%\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    find_rarest_noble_gas()\n```\n<<<1e-19>>>"
