    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic problem in the study of differential equations and fluid dynamics.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Symmetries:** The first step is to identify the continuous transformations (symmetries) of time, space, velocity, and pressure that leave the form of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ unchanged.\n2.  **Count the Parameters:** For each type of symmetry, we will count the number of independent parameters it requires. For example, a translation in 3D space requires 3 parameters (one for each coordinate axis). This number corresponds to the dimension of that particular subgroup of symmetries.\n3.  **Sum the Dimensions:** The dimension of the full Lie group is the total number of these independent parameters, which we find by summing the dimensions of all the identified symmetry subgroups. This problem refers to the maximal *finite-dimensional* symmetry group, excluding an infinite-dimensional symmetry related to pressure shifts.\n\nThe identified symmetries and their dimensions are:\n*   **Time Translation:** The laws of physics don't change over time. (1 dimension)\n*   **Spatial Translations:** The equations are the same everywhere in space. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic; they don't have a preferred direction. The rotation group in 3D, SO(3), has 3 dimensions. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a switch to a uniformly moving reference frame. (3 dimensions)\n*   **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations have a specific scaling property that relates changes in time, space, and velocity scales. (1 dimension)\n\nThe Python code below will sum these dimensions to give the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the\n    3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The dimension of a Lie group of symmetries is the number of independent\n    # parameters needed to describe the transformations.
