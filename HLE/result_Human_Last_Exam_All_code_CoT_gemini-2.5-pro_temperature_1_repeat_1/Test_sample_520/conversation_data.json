    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nThe user is asking a historical trivia question. Since the answer is a fact and not the result of a calculation, I will create a simple Python script. The script will store the answer in a variable and then print it in a complete sentence to provide the context and the solution clearly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the historical question about Andre Vernault.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Andre Vernault was an expert in a field crucial for communication and espionage during WWII.\n    # His secrecy about this skill led the British to suspect him.\n    true_profession = \"pigeon fancier\"\n    \n    # We will now print the answer in a descriptive sentence.\n    print(f\"The true profession Andre Vernault concealed from British counterintelligence was: {true_profession}.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<pigeon fancier>>>"
