    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the index of the considered boundary-value problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Determine the dimension of the system (n):** The index of a boundary-value problem is defined as `k - n`, where `k` is the number of independent boundary conditions and `n` is the dimension of the system. I will first determine `n`. The problem defines the matrix `A` as being $202000 \\times 202000$ and the vector `I(t)` as having 202000 components. For the differential equation `x'(t) = Ax(t) + I(t)` to be mathematically consistent, the vector `x(t)` must also have 202000 components. Therefore, the dimension of the system is `n = 202000`.\n\n2.  **Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k):** The problem lists six boundary conditions. I will analyze them to find out how many are linearly independent.\n    *   $x_{1}(T) - x_{1}(0) = 0$\n    *   $x_{2}(T) - x_{2}(0) = 0$\n    *   $5x_{2}(T) - 5x_{2}(0) = 0$ (which is 5 times the second condition)\n    *   $100x_{2}(T) - 100x_{2}(0) = 0$ (which is 100 times the second condition)\n    *   $1000 x_{2}(0) - 1000 x_{2}(T) = 0$ (which is -1000 times the second condition)\n    *   $100x_{2024}(T) - 100x_{2024}(0) = 0$ (which is an independent condition on $x_{2024}$)\n\n    It's clear that the conditions on $x_2$ are all multiples of each other. This means we have only three independent boundary conditions: one for $x_1$, one for $x_2$, and one for $x_{2024}$. To confirm this programmatically, I will construct a coefficient matrix for these six conditions and calculate its rank. The rank will give us `k`.\n\n3.  **Calculate the index:** Finally, I will compute the index using the formula `index = k - n` and print the result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_problem_index():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the index of the given boundary-value problem.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the dimension of the system (n).\n    # Based on the size of matrix A (202000x202000), the system dimension n must be 202000.\n    n = 202000\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the number of linearly independent boundary conditions (k).\n    # We represent the six boundary conditions in a matrix form.
