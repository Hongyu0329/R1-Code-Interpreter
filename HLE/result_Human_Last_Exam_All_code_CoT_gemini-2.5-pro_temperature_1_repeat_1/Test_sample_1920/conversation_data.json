    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $d$ and order $g$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the conductor $d$**: First, we find the prime factorization of $d$. For a character $\\chi \\pmod{d}$ to be primitive, its structure depends on the prime factorization of $d$. For a square-free conductor $d=p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi$ is primitive if and only if it can be written as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_k$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the prime $p_i$.\n\n2.  **Analyze the order $g$**: The order of the product character $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_k$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\ldots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_k))$. We are given that this order must be $g=6$.\n\n3.  **Count the characters**: We need to count the number of tuples of non-trivial characters $(\\chi_1, \\ldots, \\chi_k)$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. This can be done using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which is elegantly captured by the Mobius inversion formula on the divisors of the order $g$.\n\n    The number of primitive characters of order exactly $g$, denoted $N(g)$, is given by:\n    $N(g) = \\sum_{k|g} \\mu(g/k) C(k)$\n    where:\n    *   $k$ is a divisor of $g$.\n    *   $\\mu$ is the Mobius function.\n    *   $C(k)$ is the number of primitive characters with conductor $d$ whose order divides $k$.\n\n4.  **Calculate $C(k)$**: For a given divisor $k$ of $g$, $C(k)$ is the product of the number of choices for each component character $\\chi_i$. For each prime factor $p$ of $d$, the number of non-trivial characters modulo $p$ whose order divides $k$ is given by $\\sum_{j|\\gcd(k, p-1), j>1} \\phi(j)$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\nBy calculating $C(k)$ for all divisors $k$ of $g=6$ and substituting them into the formula for $N(6)$, we can find the final answer.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns the prime factorization of n as a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        while (temp_n % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n       factors[temp_n] = factors.get(temp_n, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Computes the greatest common divisor of a and b.\"\"\"\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef euler_phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function phi(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while p * p <= temp_n:\n        if temp_n % p == 0:\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        result -= result // temp_n\n    return result\n\ndef mobius_mu(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes the Mobius function mu(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    g = 6\n\n    print(f\"Find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order g = {g}.\")\n    \n    d_factors = get_prime_factorization(d)\n    primes = list(d_factors.keys())\n    print(f\"The conductor d = {d} is square-free, with prime factors: {primes}.\")\n    print(\"A character chi modulo d is primitive iff its p-components are non-trivial for all p|d.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe number of primitive characters of order exactly g, N(g), is found using Mobius inversion:\")\n    print(\"N(g) = sum_{k|g} mu(g/k) * C(k)\")\n    print(\"where C(k) is the number of primitive characters with order dividing k.\")\n    print(f\"For g=6, the formula is: N(6) = C(6) - C(3) - C(2) + C(1).\\n\")\n    \n    c_vals = {}\n    g_divisors = get_divisors(g)\n\n    for k in sorted(g_divisors, reverse=True):\n        print(f\"Calculating C({k}):\")\n        \n        num_chars_per_prime = []\n        for p in primes:\n            p_minus_1 = p - 1\n            limit = gcd(k, p_minus_1)\n            limit_divisors = get_divisors(limit)\n            \n            num_chars_p = sum(euler_phi(j) for j in limit_divisors if j > 1)\n            num_chars_per_prime.append(num_chars_p)\n\n        c_k = math.prod(num_chars_per_prime)\n        c_vals[k] = c_k\n\n        print(f\"  For each prime factor p of d, the number of non-trivial characters mod p with order dividing {k} is sum(phi(j)) for j|gcd({k}, p-1) and j>1.\")\n        # Show calculation for the first prime as an example\n        p, p_minus_1 = primes[0], primes[0]-1\n        limit = gcd(k, p_minus_1)\n        limit_divisors_gt1 = [j for j in get_divisors(limit) if j > 1]\n        if limit_divisors_gt1:\n             phi_calcs = ' + '.join([f\"phi({j})\" for j in limit_divisors_gt1])\n             phi_vals = ' + '.join([str(euler_phi(j)) for j in limit_divisors_gt1])\n             print(f\"  For p={p}, this is {phi_calcs} = {phi_vals} = {num_chars_per_prime[0]}.\")\n        else:\n            print(f\"  For p={p}, there are no non-trivial characters with order dividing {k}, so the count is 0.\")\n\n        print(f\"  The counts for all primes {primes} are {num_chars_per_prime}.\")\n        print(f\"  Therefore, C({k}) = {' * '.join(map(str, num_chars_per_prime))} = {c_k}\")\n\n    c1, c2, c3, c6 = c_vals.get(1, 0), c_vals.get(2, 0), c_vals.get(3, 0), c_vals.get(6, 0)\n    total_count = c6 - c3 - c2 + c1\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinally, we plug these values into the formula:\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters = C(6) - C(3) - C(2) + C(1)\")\n    print(f\"                     = {c6} - {c3} - {c2} + {c1}\")\n    print(f\"                     = {total_count}\")\n    \n    print(f\"<<<{total_count}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```"
