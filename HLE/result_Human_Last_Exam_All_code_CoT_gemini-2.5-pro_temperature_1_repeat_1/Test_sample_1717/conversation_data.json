    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my step-by-step plan to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Find the Health Formula:** First, I need to determine the formula used to calculate the health of a boss in Terraria's Expert Mode based on the number of players. This information is available from the game's source code and community wikis.\n2.  **Identify Base Health:** I will find the specific base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n3.  **Analyze for Infinite Players:** The health scaling formula is a linear function of the number of players. This means that as the number of players approaches infinity, the calculated health will also approach infinity.\n4.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** The crucial part of the request is \"according to the source code\". In computer programming, numbers are stored in specific data types with fixed size limits. Terraria stores NPC health in a 32-bit signed integer. This means there is a hard cap on how high the health value can be before it overflows.\n5.  **Determine the Cap:** The theoretical maximum health is therefore not infinity, but the maximum value a 32-bit signed integer can hold.\n6.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to calculate and display this maximum value, showing the simple equation that represents it, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Explain the health scaling formula for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n# The formula is: Health = BaseHealth * (1 + ScalingFactor * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\nbase_health_expert = 3640\nscaling_factor_per_player = 0.35\n\nprint(\"The health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode is calculated based on its base health and the number of players.\")\nprint(f\"Base Expert Health: {base_health_expert}\")\nprint(f\"Health increase per additional player: {scaling_factor_per_player * 100}% of base expert health\")\nprint(f\"Formula: Health = {base_health_expert} * (1 + {scaling_factor_per_player} * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\\n\")\n\n# Step 2: Explain the implication of infinite players.\nprint(\"As the 'NumberOfPlayers' approaches infinity, the calculated health also approaches infinity because the formula is linear.\")\nprint(\"However, the game's source code stores NPC health in a 32-bit signed integer.\\n\")\n\n# Step 3: Explain and calculate the technical limit.\nprint(\"This data type has a maximum possible value, which acts as the theoretical health cap for any NPC in the game.\")\nprint(\"The calculation for this maximum value is 2 to the power of 31, minus 1.\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.\nmax_health = 2**31 - 1\npower = 31\nbase = 2\n\nprint(\"Final Equation and Theoretical Maximum Health:\")\n# The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\nprint(f\"{base} ** {power} - 1 = {max_health}\")\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.

You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    According to the source code of the video game Terraria, in Expert Mode what is the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu given an infinite number of players?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
