# The fictitious molecule "mercedesbenzene" is interpreted as 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene.
# This structure consists of a central benzene ring with three phenyl groups attached.

# Number of carbon atoms in the central benzene ring
central_ring_carbons = 6

# Number of attached phenyl groups (representing the three points of the star)
num_phenyl_groups = 3

# Number of carbon atoms in a single phenyl group (which is a benzene ring)
phenyl_group_carbons = 6

# Calculate the total number of carbons
total_carbons = central_ring_carbons + (num_phenyl_groups * phenyl_group_carbons)

# Print the equation and the result
