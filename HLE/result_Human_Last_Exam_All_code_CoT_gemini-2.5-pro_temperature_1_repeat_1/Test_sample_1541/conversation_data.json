  "question": "This is a problem in a competitive programming contest.\n\nXenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school.

To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order.

    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step plan and a Python script to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Read the Input**: The first step is to read the input string, which represents the sum (e.g., \"3+2+1+1\").\n2.  **Extract the Numbers**: The numbers are separated by the `+` character. We can split the string by `+` to get a list of the numbers as strings (e.g., `['3', '2', '1', '1']`).\n3.  **Sort the Numbers**: Since Xenia can only calculate sums where the numbers are in non-decreasing order, we need to sort this list. The default sort will work correctly on these single-digit strings (e.g., `['1', '1', '2', '3']`).\n4.  **Reconstruct the Sum**: Finally, we join the sorted numbers back together with `+` in between to form the new sum string that Xenia can solve (e.g., \"1+1+2+3\").\n5.  **Print the Result**: The final string is printed to the console.\n\nRegarding your question about the most memory-efficient C program and its memory usage `m`:\n\nAn optimal C program would not need to store the entire input string. It could read the input one character at a time, ignoring the `+` signs and counting the occurrences of '1', '2', '3', and '4'. This is a form of counting sort.\n\nThe variables required for such a program would be:\n*   An array to hold the four counts (for numbers 1, 2, 3, 4). `unsigned short counts[4]` is sufficient, as the maximum count for any number is 500. This uses `4 * sizeof(short) = 4 * 2 = 8` bytes.\n*   A variable to read characters using `getchar()`, which returns an `int`. This uses `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes.\n*   A flag to correctly handle printing the `+` signs between numbers. A `char` is sufficient for this. This uses `sizeof(char) = 1` byte.\n*   Loop variables for printing the final sum. Two nested loops with integer counters would be needed. This uses `2 * sizeof(int) = 2 * 4 = 8` bytes.\n\nThus, the total memory `m` for variables would be the sum of their sizes: `m = 8 + 4 + 1 + 8 = 21` bytes.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem as described in the plan.\n\n```python\n# Read the input string from the user\ns = input()\n\n# Split the string by the '+' character to get a list of number strings\nnumbers = s.split('+')\n\n# Sort the list of numbers. Lexicographical sorting works correctly for single digits.\nnumbers.sort()\n\n# Join the sorted list of numbers back into a single string with '+' as a separator\nnew_sum = '+'.join(numbers)\n\n# Print the final rearranged sum\nprint(new_sum)\n```\n<<<21>>>"
