# This script calculates the two-digit number based on the theoretical analysis.

# For c=1, the arboricity f_1(n) is Theta(log n).
# This corresponds to category 5 in the problem description.
digit_for_f1 = 5

# For c=2, the arboricity f_2(n) is O(1).
# This corresponds to category 1 in the problem description.
digit_for_f2 = 1

# The final answer is a two-digit number formed by these two digits.
# The "final equation" can be seen as: Answer = digit_for_f1 * 10 + digit_for_f2
# The numbers in this equation are 5 and 1.
final_answer = digit_for_f1 * 10 + digit_for_f2
