    This problem is a variation of the liar's paradox or Gödel's incompleteness theorems, applied to computation. We analyze the two possibilities for the hypercomputer:

    1.  Assume the hypercomputer CAN compute Ω.
        If it computes Ω, it has successfully performed an action that the very definition of Ω says is impossible. This is a logical contradiction. Therefore, this assumption must be false.

    2.  Assume the hypercomputer CANNOT compute Ω.
        If it cannot compute Ω, then the statement defining Ω is true. The paradox is that the hypercomputer's failure is the proof of the statement's truth. However, the machine cannot step outside of its own operational limits to observe this failure and report it as a successful conclusion. It is logically trapped, hence it halts without an answer.

    From our external analysis, we know the hypercomputer cannot compute Ω. Since the hypercomputer is more powerful than a Turing machine, it follows that a Turing machine also cannot compute Ω.
