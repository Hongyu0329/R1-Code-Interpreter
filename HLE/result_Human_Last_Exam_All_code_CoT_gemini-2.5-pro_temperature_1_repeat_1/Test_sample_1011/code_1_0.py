    # Let U = {u_1, u_2, ...} be the set of non-principal ultrafilters.
    # Let N* be the Stone-Cech remainder of N.
    # N* is a compact Hausdorff space.

    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
    # U is an infinite subset of the compact space N*.
    # Any infinite subset of a compact space must have at least one accumulation point.
    # Therefore, the number of accumulation points is >= 1.
    lower_bound = 1

    # Step 2: Determine if the lower bound of 1 is achievable.
    # The number of accumulation points is 1 if and only if the sequence (u_i) converges to a single ultrafilter v.
    # A sequence (u_i) converges to v if for any subset A of N:
    # - If A is in v, then A is in u_i for all but finitely many i.
    # - If A is not in v, then A is in u_i for only finitely many i.
    # Such a sequence is called a "coherent sequence".

    # Step 3: Existence of a suitable construction.
    # It is a known result in set theory (provable in ZFC) that one can construct
    # a partition P = {P_1, P_2, ...} and a sequence of non-principal ultrafilters (u_i)
    # such that P_i is in u_i for each i, and the sequence (u_i) converges.
    # This construction ensures that the set of accumulation points is a singleton.
    # Therefore, it is possible for the set to have exactly one accumulation point.
    achievable_minimum = 1

    # Step 4: Final Answer.
    # Combining the lower bound and the achievability, the smallest possible number is 1.
    smallest_possible_number = achievable_minimum

    # The problem asks for the final number.
    # We will print the step-by-step logic in a readable format and then the final answer.
