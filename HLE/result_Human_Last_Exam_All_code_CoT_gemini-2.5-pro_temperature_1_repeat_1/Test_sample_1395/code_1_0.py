# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian subgraph after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
# The creation of the new Central Asian states resulted in a subgraph that requires 4 colors.
# This can be proven by attempting to 3-color the region:
# 1. China: C1
# 2. Kazakhstan (borders China): C2
# 3. Kyrgyzstan (borders China, Kazakhstan): C3
# 4. Uzbekistan (borders Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan): C1
# 5. Tajikistan (borders China, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan): C2
# 6. Afghanistan (borders Tajikistan, Uzbekistan): C3
# 7. Turkmenistan (borders Kazakhstan(C2), Uzbekistan(C1), and Afghanistan(C3)) is adjacent to three different colors,
#    thus requiring a fourth color.
# Since the graph is planar, its chromatic number is exactly 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph after the Soviet dissolution is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number before the dissolution.
# Before the dissolution, the USSR was a single entity. The region was less complex and could be 3-colored.
# The phrase "incrementally from before" implies we should focus on the change introduced by the event.
# The dissolution event itself created the structure that required 4 colors.
# Therefore, we infer the chromatic number before this specific change was 3.
chromatic_number_before = 3
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian country graph before the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change in the chromatic number is delta_soviet = {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine beta, the factor for planarity change.
# A map of contiguous countries on a globe is inherently a planar graph.
# The dissolution of one nation into several new ones is a subdivision of a node, which preserves planarity.
# Since the planarity of the graph did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The planarity of the graph did not change, so beta = {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final answer is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")
