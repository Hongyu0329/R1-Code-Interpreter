    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the connectivity of the map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Identify the spaces** and their general properties. The spaces are built from spheres ($S^n$), loop spaces ($\\Omega$), suspensions ($\\Sigma$), and smash products ($\\wedge$).\n2.  **Calculate the connectivity of the source and target spaces.** The connectivity of a space $X$, denoted `conn(X)`, is the largest integer $k$ such that all homotopy groups $\\pi_i(X)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$. We will use the following standard rules:\n    *   `conn(S^n) = n-1`\n    *   `conn(A \\wedge B) = conn(A) + conn(B) + 1`\n    *   `conn(\\Sigma A) = conn(A) + 1`\n    *   `conn(\\Omega A) = conn(A) - 1`\n3.  **Determine the connectivity of the map.** The connectivity of a map $f: X \\to Y$ is the largest integer $c$ such that the induced map on homotopy groups, $\\pi_i(f)$, is an isomorphism for all $i < c$ and an epimorphism for $i=c$. An equivalent definition is that the homotopy fiber of the map is $(c-1)$-connected.\n4.  **Analyze the map on the first non-trivial homotopy group.** We will see that both the source and target spaces have the same connectivity. The connectivity of the map is therefore determined by whether the map is an epimorphism on the first non-trivial homotopy group.\n5.  **Provide the Python code** to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation\nLet $k=4$ and $m=6$.\n\n**1. Connectivity of the Source Space:** $S = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^k \\wedge \\Omega S^m )$\n*   The connectivity of the spheres are `conn(S^k) = k-1` and `conn(S^m) = m-1`.\n*   The connectivity of their loop spaces are `conn(\\Omega S^k) = conn(S^k) - 1 = k-2` and `conn(\\Omega S^m) = conn(S^m) - 1 = m-2`.\n*   The connectivity of their smash product is `conn(\\Omega S^k \\wedge \\Omega S^m) = conn(\\Omega S^k) + conn(\\Omega S^m) + 1 = (k-2) + (m-2) + 1 = k+m-3`.\n*   Finally, the connectivity of the source space (the suspension of the smash product) is `conn(S) = conn(\\Omega S^k \\wedge \\Omega S^m) + 1 = (k+m-3) + 1 = k+m-2`.\n\nFor $k=4, m=6$, the connectivity of the source is $4+6-2 = 8$.\n\n**2. Connectivity of the Target Space:** $T = \\Omega(S^k \\wedge S^m)$\n*   The connectivity of the smash product of the spheres is `conn(S^k \\wedge S^m) = conn(S^k) + conn(S^m) + 1 = (k-1) + (m-1) + 1 = k+m-1`.\n*   The connectivity of the target space (the loop space of the smash product) is `conn(T) = conn(S^k \\wedge S^m) - 1 = (k+m-1) - 1 = k+m-2`.\n\nFor $k=4, m=6$, the connectivity of the target is $4+6-2 = 8$.\n\n**3. Connectivity of the Map:**\nBoth the source and target spaces are $(k+m-2)$-connected (i.e., 8-connected). This means that for $i \\le 8$, the homotopy groups of both spaces are trivial, and the map $\\pi_i(\\phi)$ is an isomorphism (from the trivial group to itself). Therefore, the connectivity of the map is at least $k+m-2 = 8$.\n\nThe first non-trivial homotopy groups appear at dimension $k+m-1=9$.\n*   $\\pi_9(S) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n*   $\\pi_9(T) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$\n\nThe map on this first non-trivial group, $\\pi_9(\\phi): \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$, is known to be multiplication by an integer whose absolute value is greater than 1. (This is a non-trivial result from algebraic topology related to the Hopf invariant of a Whitehead product). A map $\\mathbb{Z} \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ that is not multiplication by $\\pm 1$ is not an epimorphism.\n\nAccording to the definition, for the map to be 9-connected, $\\pi_9(\\phi)$ must be an epimorphism. Since it is not, the connectivity is not 9. The highest integer $c$ for which the condition holds is $c=8$.\n\nTherefore, the connectivity of the map is $k+m-2$.\n\n```python\ndef solve_connectivity():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the connectivity of the map\n    Sigma(Omega S^k wedge Omega S^m) -> Omega(S^k wedge S^m)\n    for k=4 and m=6.\n    \"\"\"\n    k = 4\n    m = 6\n\n    # The connectivity of the map is given by the formula k + m - 2.\n    # We will show the steps to derive this.\n\n    # Step 1: Connectivity of the source space\n    # conn(S^n) = n-1\n    # conn(Omega X) = conn(X) - 1\n    # conn(A wedge B) = conn(A) + conn(B) + 1\n    # conn(Sigma X) = conn(X) + 1\n    conn_Omega_Sk = k - 2\n    conn_Omega_Sm = m - 2\n    conn_smash_Omega = conn_Omega_Sk + conn_Omega_Sm + 1\n    conn_source = conn_smash_Omega + 1\n    \n    # Step 2: Connectivity of the target space\n    conn_Sk = k - 1\n    conn_Sm = m - 1\n    conn_smash_S = conn_Sk + conn_Sm + 1\n    conn_target = conn_smash_S - 1\n\n    # The connectivity of the map is the same as the connectivity of the source\n    # and target spaces in this case, because the map on the first\n    # non-trivial homotopy group is not an epimorphism.\n    result = k + m - 2\n    \n    print(\"Problem: What is the connectivity of the map\")\n    print(\"Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)?\")\n    print(\"\\nLet k=4 and m=6.\")\n    print(\"\\n### Calculation Steps ###\")\n    print(\"\\n1.
