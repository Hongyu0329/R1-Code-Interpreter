    "To determine the largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Timeframe**: The period is from the start of World War II in September 1939 until the French armistice on June 22, 1940.\n2.  **Identify Potential Candidates**: I will research major French maritime losses during this period that were caused by German U-boats. \"Largest\" will be determined by Gross Register Tonnage (GRT), a common measure of a ship's size.\n3.  **Filter and Compare**: I will filter the list to include only ships sunk by U-boats (either directly by torpedo or indirectly by mines laid by U-boats). Then, I will compare their tonnage to find the largest.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to represent the data for the candidate ships and programmatically find the largest one based on the criteria.\n5.  **Final Output**: The script will print the name and tonnage of the identified ship.\n\n```python\nimport datetime\n\ndef find_largest_sunk_ship():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the largest French ship by tonnage sunk by a U-boat\n    before the Franco-German armistice of June 22, 1940.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data of notable French ships sunk by U-boats before the armistice.\n    # GRT (Gross Register Tonnage) is used as the measure for size.\n    # The armistice was signed on June 22, 1940.\n    armistice_date = datetime.date(1940, 6, 22)\n    \n    ships = [\n        {'name': 'Flandre', 'tonnage': 8023, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 10, 13), 'cause': 'U-47 (torpedo)'},\n        {'name': 'Emile Miguet', 'tonnage': 14115, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1939, 10, 12), 'cause': 'U-48 (torpedo)'},\n        {'name': 'Charles Plumier', 'tonnage': 4783, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 5, 19), 'cause': 'U-37 (torpedo)'},\n        {'name': 'Sheherazade', 'tonnage': 13467, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 6, 12), 'cause': 'U-48 (torpedo)'},\n        {'name': 'Champlain', 'tonnage': 28124, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 6, 17), 'cause': 'U-65 (mine)'},\n        {'name': 'Bretagne (Battleship)', 'tonnage': 22189, 'sunk_date': datetime.date(1940, 7, 3), 'cause': 'British Royal Navy'}\n    ]\n    \n    largest_ship = None\n    max_tonnage = 0\n    \n    print(\"Analyzing French ships sunk before the armistice of June 22, 1940...\")\n    \n    for ship in ships:\n        # Check if the ship was sunk before the armistice and by a U-boat\n        if ship['sunk_date'] < armistice_date and 'U-' in ship['cause']:\n            print(f\"- Candidate: {ship['name']}, Tonnage: {ship['tonnage']} GRT, Sunk on: {ship['sunk_date']}\")\n            if ship['tonnage'] > max_tonnage:\n                max_tonnage = ship['tonnage']\n                largest_ship = ship\n\n    if largest_ship:\n        print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n        print(f\"The largest French ship sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the SS {largest_ship['name']}.\")\n        print(f\"It had a displacement of {largest_ship['tonnage']} GRT.\")\n        print(f\"It was sunk on {largest_ship['sunk_date']} after hitting a mine laid by {largest_ship['cause'].split(' ')[0]}.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No matching ship found in the dataset.\")\n\nfind_largest_sunk_ship()\n```\n<<<The largest French ship by displacement to be sunk by a U-boat before the 1940 armistice was the passenger liner SS Champlain, with a Gross Register Tonnage of 28,124.
