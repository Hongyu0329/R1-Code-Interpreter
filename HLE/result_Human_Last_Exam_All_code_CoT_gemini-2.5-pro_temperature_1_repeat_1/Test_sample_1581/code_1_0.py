    This script solves the given topology problem by applying established theorems.
    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact
    connected metric space X, given that for some n >= 2, the configuration space
    of n distinct points in X is disconnected.
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the problem statement.
    # X is a compact connected metric space.
    # C_n(X) = {(x_1, ..., x_n) in X^n | all x_i are distinct} is disconnected for some n >= 2.
    # A metric space is a Hausdorff space.
    # Since C_n(X) is disconnected, it must be non-empty, which implies X has at least n >= 2 points.
    # So X is a non-degenerate space.

    # Step 2: Apply Borges's Theorem.
    # A theorem by C.L. Borges (1998, Topology and its Applications) states that for a
    # non-degenerate Hausdorff space X, the following are equivalent:
    # (a) X is a connected and orderable space.
    # (b) The configuration space C_2(X) is not connected.
    # (c) For each integer n >= 2, the configuration space C_n(X) is not connected.
    # From the problem statement, we know C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2.
    # Therefore, X must be a connected and orderable space.

    # Step 3: Apply the characterization theorem for the interval.
    # We have established that X is a compact, connected, and orderable metric space.
    # A classical theorem in topology states that any space with these properties is
    # homeomorphic to a closed interval [a, b].
    # The proof outline is that any compact connected ordered space is densely ordered,
    # Dedekind complete, and has a minimum and maximum element. Any such space is
    # order-isomorphic and homeomorphic to [0, 1].

    # Step 4: Conclude the number of homeomorphism classes.
    # Any space X satisfying the given conditions must be homeomorphic to the closed interval [0, 1].
    # All closed intervals are homeomorphic to each other.
    # Therefore, all such spaces X belong to a single homeomorphism class.
