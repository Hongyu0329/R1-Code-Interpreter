    "To calculate the Hopf charge of the given vector field, we can use the geometric interpretation of the Hopf charge. The Hopf charge `H` corresponds to the linking number of the preimages of any two regular points on the target sphere S².\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the vector field `n=(nx, ny, nz)` which maps from 3D space (R³) to the unit sphere (S²). The map is defined using the functions `G(x,y,z)` for the polar angle and `f(x,y)` for the azimuthal angle.\n2.  Choose two regular points on the sphere S². A convenient choice is the South Pole `v_S = (0, 0, -1)` and an equatorial point `v_E = (1, 0, 0)`.\n3.  Determine the preimages of these two points in R³. The preimage of a point is the set of all points `(x,y,z)` that map to it. These preimages will be curves in our 3D space.\n4.  The preimage of the South Pole (`C_S`) will be shown to be a circle in the `xy`-plane.\n5.  The preimage of the equatorial point (`C_E`) will be shown to be a closed loop in the `xz`-plane.\n6.  The Hopf charge `H` is the linking number of these two curves, `Lk(C_S, C_E)`.\n7.  We can calculate the linking number by considering the disk `D_S` bounded by the circle `C_S` and counting how many times the loop `C_E` pierces this disk.\n8.  The python code will perform these calculations step-by-step and print the results, ultimately concluding the value of the Hopf charge.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_hopf_charge():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hopf charge of the given vector field by determining the\n    linking number of the preimages of two points on the target sphere.\n    \"\"\"\n    PI = math.pi\n\n    # Step 1: Define the mapping functions.\n    # The vector field n is defined by a map to spherical coordinates (G, f)\n    # on the S^2 sphere.\n    # f = atan2(y,x)\n    # r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)**2 + z*z)\n    # G = PI * exp(-10*r2)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyzing the vector field definition.\")\n    print(\"The vector field (nx,ny,nz) is a map from R^3 to S^2.\")\n    print(\"The mapping is defined by:\")\n    print(\"f = atan2(y,x)\")\n    print(\"r2 = sqrt((x*x+y*y-0.5)**2 + z*z)\")\n    print(\"G = PI * exp(-10*r2)\")\n    print(\"nx = sin(G)*cos(f), ny = sin(G)*sin(f), nz = cos(G)\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Choose two points on the target sphere S^2.\n    # We choose the South Pole (v_S) and an equatorial point (v_E).\n    v_S = (0, 0, -1)\n    v_E = (1, 0, 0)\n    print(\"Step 2: Choose two regular points on the target sphere S^2.\")\n    print(f\"Point 1 (South Pole): v_S = {v_S}\")\n    print(f\"Point 2 (Equatorial): v_E = {v_E}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the preimage of the South Pole (C_S).\n    # For n = v_S, we need nz = cos(G) = -1.
