    explanation = """
The core issue with time-varying birth-death models on phylogenies of living species is 'non-identifiability'. This means different speciation and extinction rate histories can produce the same tree, making it impossible to know the true rates.

Effective strategies to lessen this problem either:
1.  Add new data (e.g., fossils).
2.  Add external information (e.g., Bayesian priors).
3.  Reduce model complexity (regularization).
4.  Re-formulate the model to estimate identifiable parameters.

Options A, B, D, E, F, and G all achieve one of these goals.

The strategy that does NOT help is C: Fitting a model with pieces defined by high-degree polynomials.

Reasoning: This approach dramatically increases the model's complexity and flexibility. A model that is already unidentifiable becomes even more so when given more parameters and freedom. Instead of constraining the model to find a stable solution, this method makes it easier for countless parameter combinations to fit the data equally well, thus worsening the identifiability problem.
