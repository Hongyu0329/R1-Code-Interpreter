    This function identifies and prints the indices of species from the 1872 list

    The research has been conducted beforehand, and the results are stored in this script.
    A species is considered a synonym if its original name is no longer the accepted
    scientific name, either due to being reclassified into a new genus or being
    synonymized with another species.
