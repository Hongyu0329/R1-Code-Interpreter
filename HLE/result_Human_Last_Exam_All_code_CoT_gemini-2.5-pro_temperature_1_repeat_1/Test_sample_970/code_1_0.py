    Determines the necessary assumption for a Bayesian agent's expected information gain to approach zero and formats the answer in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF).

    The analysis shows that the total expected information gain is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution over models.
    Total Information Gain = sum(Expected_Information_Gain_t) <= H(prior)

    For a sum of non-negative terms to be finite (converge), the terms must approach zero.
    Therefore, if the prior has finite entropy (H(prior) < infinity), the expected information gain at each step must approach zero.
    This makes option 'a' the essential assumption.

    The CNF representation for a single required condition 'a' is [(a)].
