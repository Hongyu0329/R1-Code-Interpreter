    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a state-feedback pole placement problem. The goal is to design a feedback gain matrix `F` such that the closed-loop system `A + BF` has its eigenvalues at the desired locations, in this case, at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define System and Goal**: We are given matrices `A` and `B` and desired eigenvalues (poles). The eigenvalues determine the desired characteristic polynomial of the closed-loop system `A + BF`.\n2.  **Handle Multi-Input System**: Since the system has multiple inputs (matrix `B` has more than one column), there are infinite possible solutions for the feedback matrix `F`. A standard method to find one such solution is to convert the multi-input problem into a single-input problem.\n3.  **SISO Conversion**: We'll select an input direction vector `g` to create an effective single-input system with an input matrix `b_eff = B @ g`. We'll choose a simple `g` (e.g., `[1, 0]^T`) and confirm that the resulting system `(A, b_eff)` is controllable.\n4.  **Pole Placement**: For this new single-input system, we can use a standard pole placement algorithm, like Ackermann's formula, to find a gain vector `K`.\n5.  **Construct Final Gain F**: The gain `K` is for the single-input system. We'll use it along with our chosen vector `g` to construct the final gain matrix `F` for the original multi-input system.\n6.  **Verification**: Finally, we'll compute the resulting closed-loop matrix `A + BF` and verify that its eigenvalues match the desired ones.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `numpy` library.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_pole_placement():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the state feedback gain F for a MIMO system\n    such that A + BF has specified eigenvalues.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set print options for better readability of matrices\n    np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n    # 1.
