    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the chemical structure of a \"nanocar.\"** The term \"nanocar\" typically refers to a single-molecule vehicle synthesized by the research group of Professor James Tour. It's composed of a chassis and four wheels.\n2.  **Determine the chemical formula of the components.** The chassis, which is the main body, has a chemical formula of `C46H24`. The \"wheels\" are typically buckminsterfullerene molecules (`C60`), which contain no hydrogen.\n3.  **Understand the term \"perfluoro-\".** In chemistry, this prefix means that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the original molecule have been replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the number of fluorine atoms.** Since only the chassis contains hydrogen atoms, the fluorination process will only affect the chassis. By replacing all 24 hydrogen atoms in the `C46H24` chassis with fluorine atoms, we get a perfluorinated chassis with the formula `C46F24`. The fullerene wheels remain unchanged. Therefore, the total number of fluorine atoms in the perfluoronanocar is 24.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and explains this.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n    The calculation is based on the structure of the most common nanocar,\n    which has a chassis with the chemical formula C46H24. The prefix\n    \"perfluoro-\" means all hydrogen (H) atoms are replaced with fluorine (F) atoms.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The chemical formula for the nanocar's chassis is C46H24.\n    num_carbon_atoms_chassis = 46\n    num_hydrogen_atoms_chassis = 24\n\n    # In a \"perfluoro\" compound, all hydrogen atoms are replaced by fluorine atoms.\n    num_fluorine_atoms = num_hydrogen_atoms_chassis\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the number of hydrogen atoms in a standard nanocar chassis (C46H24).\")\n    print(f\"Number of Hydrogen atoms = {num_hydrogen_atoms_chassis}\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The prefix 'perfluoro-' means every hydrogen atom is replaced by a fluorine atom.\")\n    print(\"The final equation is: Number of Fluorine atoms = Number of Hydrogen atoms\")\n    print(f\"Number of Fluorine atoms = {num_fluorine_atoms}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 24 fluorine atoms.\")\n\ncalculate_fluorine_atoms_in_perfluoronanocar()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
