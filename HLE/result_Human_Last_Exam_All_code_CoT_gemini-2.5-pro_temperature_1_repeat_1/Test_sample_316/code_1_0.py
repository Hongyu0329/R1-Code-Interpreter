    This function determines the other critical exponent for the given inequality.

    The problem asks for a critical exponent of the reverse square function estimate for the cone in R^3:
    ||f||_L^p <= C * R^alpha * || (sum_theta |f_theta|^2)^(1/2) ||_L^p

    It is stated that alpha(p), the best possible exponent, is a piecewise linear function of 1/p,
    and that its slope changes at exactly two values of p (for p > 2). One of these is p=4.

    1.  The exponent p=4 is the classical Tomas-Stein restriction exponent for the cone in R^3. For p >= 4,
        a specific type of function (a coherent sum of parallel wave packets) is the extremal example,
        leading to a certain behavior for alpha(p).

    2.  For p < 4, other more complex geometric configurations of wave packets (related to the Kakeya
        problem) become the extremal examples. The theory that describes these configurations and
        proves estimates for them has identified another critical value of p.

    3.  The theory of bilinear and multilinear restriction estimates, developed by Tao, Vargas, Vega,
        Bennett, Carbery, and Tao, and the final resolution of the restriction conjecture for the
        cone in R^3 by Guth, shows that the problem changes nature at p=3. The bilinear restriction
        estimate, a cornerstone of the modern proof, holds for p > 3.

    Therefore, the two critical exponents where the behavior of alpha(p) changes are p=4 and p=3.
