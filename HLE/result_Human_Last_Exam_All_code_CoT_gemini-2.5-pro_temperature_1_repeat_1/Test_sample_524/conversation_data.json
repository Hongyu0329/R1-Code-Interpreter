    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a classic question from the field of topology. Here is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n\n**Thinking Process:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the question:** The user wants to know the number of \"homeomorphism classes\" of \"homogeneous planar continua.\"\n    *   A **continuum** is a connected, compact set. Informally, think of it as a single, bounded shape with no holes or gaps that would split it apart.\n    *   **Planar** means the shape can be embedded in a 2D plane (like a piece of paper) without any part of it crossing over another.\n    *   **Homogeneous** is the key property. It means the shape \"looks the same\" from every single point. If you were an infinitely small ant standing on any point, your surroundings on the shape would be structurally identical to what an ant would see standing on any other point.\n    *   A **homeomorphism class** is a category of shapes that are topologically equivalent. You can stretch, bend, or deform one into the other without tearing or gluing parts. The question asks how many fundamentally different types of these shapes exist.\n\n2.  **Recall the mathematical theorem:** The classification of homogeneous planar continua is a famous result in mathematics, established through the work of several topologists like R. H. Bing, F. B. Jones, and J. T. Rogers, Jr. over many decades.\n\n3.  **List the possibilities:** According to the complete classification theorem, every homogeneous planar continuum is homeomorphic to one of just four distinct types:\n    *   **The point:** The simplest continuum. It is trivially homogeneous.\n    *   **The circle (or simple closed curve):** Any point on a circle is topologically equivalent to any other.\n    *   **The pseudo-arc:** A very complex, snake-like continuum. It's connected but contains no standard arcs (or \"nice\" paths). It is famously homogeneous.\n    *   **The circle of pseudo-arcs:** This is constructed from a continuous collection of pseudo-arcs arranged in a circle.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total:** The total number of classes is simply the sum of these distinct types: 1 (point) + 1 (circle) + 1 (pseudo-arc) + 1 (circle of pseudo-arcs).\n\n5.  **Generate the code:** I will write a simple Python script to represent this summation and print the result clearly, showing each component of the sum as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_homeomorphism_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of homeomorphism classes\n    of homogeneous planar continua based on the complete classification theorem.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # According to the classification theorem, there are four distinct types of\n    # homogeneous planar continua. We assign a count of 1 to each class.\n    \n    # Class 1: The point\n    the_point = 1\n    \n    # Class 2: The circle (simple closed curve)\n    the_circle = 1\n    \n    # Class 3: The pseudo-arc\n    the_pseudo_arc = 1\n    \n    # Class 4: The circle of pseudo-arcs\n    the_circle_of_pseudo_arcs = 1\n    \n    # The total number of classes is the sum of these individual classes.\n    total_classes = the_point + the_circle + the_pseudo_arc + the_circle_of_pseudo_arcs\n    \n    print(\"The total number of homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua is determined by the sum of the known distinct types.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{the_point} (point) + {the_circle} (circle) + {the_pseudo_arc} (pseudo-arc) + {the_circle_of_pseudo_arcs} (circle of pseudo-arcs) = {total_classes}\")\n\nsolve_homeomorphism_classes()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
