    "This is a classic mathematical problem known as \"circle packing in a circle\". We need to find the smallest possible radius for a large circle that can contain 14 smaller circles of radius 1. The optimal arrangement and the corresponding radius for packing 'n' circles are known for many values of 'n', but they often lack a simple formula and are the result of complex geometric proofs or computational searches.\n\nFor n=14, the optimal arrangement has been found, and the ratio of the large circle's radius (R) to the small circles' radius (r) is a known value. We will use this established value in our Python script.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the radius of the small circles, `r = 1`.\n2.  Use the known radius ratio for packing 14 circles, which is approximately 3.42803. This value is a result of mathematical research into this specific packing problem.\n3.  Formulate the equation to calculate the radius of the large circle: `R = r * 3.42803`.\n4.  Write a Python script to perform this calculation and print the components of the equation.\n5.  Finally, print the result formatted to 4 significant digits as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_circle_packing_radius():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the radius of a circle that tightly packs 14 unit circles.\n\n    This problem is a known \"circle packing in a circle\" problem.
