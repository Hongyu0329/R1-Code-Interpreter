    # 1. The condition for a proposition P to be a QTFP is that P ⊙ P
    #    yields the same result in forward and backward time-flows.
    #    Forward:  sqrt((P ∧ P) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬P))
    #    Backward: sqrt((P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P))
    #    Equating them and squaring gives the propositional equation:
    #    (P ∧ P) ∨ (¬P ∧ ¬P) = (P ∧ ¬P) ∨ (¬P ∧ P)

    # 2. This equality is guaranteed to hold if the proposition P is
    #    indistinguishable from its negation ¬P. In quantum mechanics, this means
    #    the state vector |P> is proportional to its negation |¬P> = X|P>.
    #    So, |P> = c * |¬P> for some phase factor c.

    # 3. Substituting |¬P> = X|P> gives |P> = c * X|P>.
    #    Let |P> = a|T> + b|F>. Then X|P> = b|T> + a|F>.
    #    The equation becomes: a|T> + b|F> = c * (b|T> + a|F>).
    #    This implies a = c*b and b = c*a.
    #    Substituting b into the first equation yields a = c*(c*a), which simplifies to a = c^2 * a.
