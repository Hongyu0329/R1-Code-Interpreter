The user wants the equation for the absorption cross-section for a chain of molecules absorbing a Gaussian laser pulse, derived using first-order perturbation theory. The final answer should be the Python code that prints the derived equations for two cases: (a) non-interacting molecules and (b) molecules with near-neighbor interaction. The provided Python code `solve_absorption_cross_section()` fulfills this by first explaining the general physical model and then printing the specific, formatted equations for each case, along with a detailed explanation of every variable involved. For case (a), it shows the cross-section depending on single-molecule properties. For case (b), it incorporates the Frenkel exciton model, showing the energy shift due to coupling (J) and the collective enhancement of the transition dipole moment by the number of molecules (N). The code is self-contained and directly generates the requested textual output.
