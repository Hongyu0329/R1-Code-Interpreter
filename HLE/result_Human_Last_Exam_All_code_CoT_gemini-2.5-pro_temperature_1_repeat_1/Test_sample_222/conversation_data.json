    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem**: The user wants to find the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an 8-point sequence, which is formed by interleaving two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. Let's call the 8-point sequence `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`. Computing an N-point DFT of a sequence longer than N implies time-domain aliasing. Therefore, we first create a 4-point sequence, `z(n)`, by aliasing `y(n)`: `z(n) = y(n) + y(n+4)`. We then find the 4-point DFT of `z(n)`.\n\n2.  **Use DFT Properties**: There's a more direct way using DFT properties. The 4-point DFT of the aliased sequence, `Z(k)`, is equivalent to taking the even-indexed samples of the 8-point DFT of the original sequence, `Y(k)`. That is, `Z(k) = Y(2k)`.\n\n3.  **Apply Decimation-in-Time Formula**: The interleaved structure of `y(n)` is the basis of the decimation-in-time FFT algorithm. The 8-point DFT `Y(k)` can be computed directly from the 4-point DFTs `X(k)` and `H(k)`:\n    *   `Y(k) = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for k = 0, 1, 2, 3\n    (where `W_N^k = exp(-j*2*pi*k/N)`)\n\n4.  **Calculate the Result**: We can now find `Z(k)` by computing `Y(0)`, `Y(2)`, `Y(4)`, and `Y(6)` using the formulas above and the given `X(k)` and `H(k)` values.\n    *   `Z(0) = Y(0) = X(0) + H(0)`\n    *   `Z(1) = Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2)`\n    *   `Z(2) = Y(4) = X(0) - H(0)`\n    *   `Z(3) = Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2)`\n\n5.  **Code the Solution**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations and print each step as requested.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Given 4-point DFTs\nX = np.array([1, 1j, -1, -1j])\nH = np.array([0, 1+1j, 1, 1-1j])\n\n# The problem asks for the 4-point DFT of an 8-point interleaved sequence.\n# This implies time-aliasing.
