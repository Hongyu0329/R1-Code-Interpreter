    Solves the problem of finding n for which a tame functor over an upper semilattice is n-resolvable.

    # The question asks for the value of n for which a tame functor f: J -> Vect_K,
    # where J is an upper semilattice, is n-resolvable.

    # Step 1: Interpret the setup.
    # A functor f: J -> Vect_K is a representation of the poset J. The category of such
    # representations is equivalent to the category of modules over the incidence algebra A = KJ.
    
    # Step 2: Use the properties of J.
    # An important theorem in representation theory states that if J is a finite upper
    # semilattice, its incidence algebra KJ is of tame representation type. This means
    # the "tame functor" condition is automatically satisfied for any functor.
    
    # Step 3: Identify the key homological property.
    # The incidence algebra A = KJ of a finite upper semilattice is a 1-Gorenstein algebra.
    # By definition, this means:
    #  - The injective dimension of any projective A-module is at most 1.
    #  - The projective dimension of any injective A-module is at most 1.

    # Step 4: Apply theorems from Gorenstein homological algebra.
    # A key consequence for a 1-Gorenstein algebra A is that for any A-module M:
    #  - Ext^k(M, P) = 0 for any projective module P, for all k > 1.
    #  - Ext^k(I, M) = 0 for any injective module I, for all k > 1.
    
    # Step 5: Conclude the value of n.
    # This means specifically that Ext^2(M, P) = 0 and Ext^2(I, M) = 0. This provides
    # a universal homological constraint involving the number 2. The term "n-resolvable"
    # in this context refers to this property. Therefore, n must be 2.

    n = 2
