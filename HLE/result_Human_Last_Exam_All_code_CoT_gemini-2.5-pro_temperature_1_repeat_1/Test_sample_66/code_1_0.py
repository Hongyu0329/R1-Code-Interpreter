    Calculates the maximal possible rank of a matrix representing the Tonga flag.

    The flag is modeled as a matrix where red pixels have value 'a' and
    white pixels have value 'b'. For maximal rank, we assume a != b.
    Let's choose a=1 (red) and b=0 (white) for simplicity, as the rank
    is independent of the specific values, only that they are distinct.

    # These dimensions are chosen to be large enough to represent the flag's features.

    # 4. Theoretical Analysis
    # The rank of the flag matrix M can be simplified. The entire area outside the
    # canton is red, meaning all rows from canton_height downwards are identical vectors
    # of the form (a, a, ..., a).
    # By subtracting this vector from the rows that pass through the canton,
    # we can show that: rank(M) = rank(C') + 1
    # where C' is the pattern of the canton. The +1 comes from the single
    # independent row representing the red field.

    # The rank of the canton's pattern (C') is the number of linearly independent
    # rows it has. For a couped cross, there are 3 such row types:
    # - A row from the white border.
    # - A row cutting through the vertical part of the cross.
    # - A row cutting through the horizontal part of thecross.
    # These three types are linearly independent. So, rank(C') = 3.
