# Step 1: Define the given output probability for the state |0>.
# This is the value |α'|², where |ψ'⟩ = α'|0⟩ + β'|1⟩ is the output state.
p_out_0 = 0.36

# Step 2: Calculate the output probability for the state |1>.
# Since probabilities must sum to 1, |β'|² = 1 - |α'|².
p_out_1 = 1 - p_out_0

# Step 3: Apply the interpreted property 1 from the problem description.
# The most consistent interpretation is that the probability of measuring |1> at the output
# is the square of the probability of measuring |0> at the input.
# Mathematically: |β'|² = (|α|²)²
# We are looking for the value of |α|².

# Step 4: Solve the equation for |α|².
# |α|² = sqrt(|β'|²)
result_alpha_squared = math.sqrt(p_out_1)

# Step 5: Print the derivation and the final answer.
