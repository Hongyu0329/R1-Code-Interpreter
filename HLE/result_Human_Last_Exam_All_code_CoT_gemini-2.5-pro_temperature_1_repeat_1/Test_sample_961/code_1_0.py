# It is a known result from geometric group theory that the stable commutator
# length of a single commutator [a, b] in a free group F(a,b) is 1/2.
scl_of_single_commutator = 0.5

# Step 1: Calculate the scl of a single powered commutator c_i^30 within its factor group F_i.
# Using the homogeneity property: scl(g^n) = n * scl(g).
scl_of_powered_commutator_in_factor = power * scl_of_single_commutator

# Step 2: Calculate the total scl.
# By the additivity property of scl over free products, the total scl is the sum of the
# scl's of each component. Since all components are identical, this is a simple multiplication.
total_scl = num_groups * scl_of_powered_commutator_in_factor

# Print the final equation with all the numbers.
# The calculation proceeds as: scl(c) = 19 * scl(c_i^30) = 19 * (30 * scl(c_i))
