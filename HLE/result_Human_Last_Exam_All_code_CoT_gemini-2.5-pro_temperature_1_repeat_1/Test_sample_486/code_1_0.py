# The problem is to find the largest 'a' for which the liminf of R^{-a} * I(R) is positive,
# where I(R) is the integral of |nabla u|^2 over a ball of radius R.
# This requires finding the minimal growth rate of I(R) over all possible solutions u.
# Theory suggests the minimal growth rate is quadratic (a=2), related to the area
# of a planar nodal set. We verify this with the 1D solution u = tanh(z/sqrt(2)).

# For this solution, |nabla u|^2 = (1/2) * sech^4(z/sqrt(2)).
# The integral I(R) is given by:
# I(R) = Integral[-R to R] of pi*(R^2 - z^2) * (1/2) * sech^4(z/sqrt(2)) dz

# For large R, the sech^4 term localizes the integral around z=0,
# so (R^2 - z^2) can be approximated by R^2.
# I(R) approx R^2 * Integral[-inf to inf] of (pi/2) * sech^4(z/sqrt(2)) dz
# Let C be the value of this integral.
# C = (pi/2) * Integral[-inf to inf] sech^4(z/sqrt(2)) dz
# We perform a change of variables: s = z/sqrt(2), so dz = sqrt(2) ds.
# C = (pi/2) * sqrt(2) * Integral[-inf to inf] sech^4(s) ds

# We can calculate the definite integral of sech^4(s) using sympy.
s = sympy.Symbol('s')
integral_val = sympy.integrate(sympy.sech(s)**4, (s, -sympy.oo, sympy.oo))

# The result of the integral is a rational number.
# From the formula, the coefficient C is (pi * sqrt(2) / 2) * integral_val.

C = (pi_val * sqrt2_val / 2) * integral_val
