# Based on the physical analysis of violin acoustics:
# 1. 'sul ponticello' changes the harmonic content (brightness), which is controlled by ν. This is Group ii.
# 2. A bridge mute adds mass and dampens the main body resonance, lowering its frequency f₁. This is Group iii, and f₁ goes down.
# 3. Helium changes the speed of sound, shifting all air-cavity resonances (fₘ). By elimination and considering the effect on the overall resonance structure, this corresponds to Group iv.
# 4. Changing from the A-string to the E-string changes the fundamental frequency F. This is Group i.

# The resulting sequence of groups for variations (1), (2), (3), and (4) is: ii, iii, iv, i.
# The direction of change for the last parameter in group (2), f₁, is 'down'.

# The final answer is constructed by combining these findings into a single comma-separated string.
final_answer = "ii,iii,iv,i,down"
