    "Trisyllabic laxing is a sound change rule in English where a tense (or long) vowel becomes lax (or short) when it is in the antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable of a word. For this rule to apply, a word must have at least three syllables.\n\nHere is my step-by-step plan to identify the correct word:\n1.  First, I will analyze each word to count its syllables. Any word with fewer than three syllables cannot have undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n2.  For words with three or more syllables, I will check if they show the characteristic vowel shortening compared to a related base word.\n3.  The words that do not have at least three syllables are the candidates for the final answer.\n4.  I will then provide a Python script that automates this analysis, prints the breakdown for each word, and identifies the final answer. The numbers involved in this \"equation\" are the syllable counts for each word.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_trisyllabic_laxing():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n    Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule that shortens a tense vowel\n    when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable.\n    Therefore, words with fewer than three syllables are automatically disqualified.\n    \"\"\"\n    word_analysis = {\n        \"southern\": {\n            \"syllables\": 2,\n            \"underwent_tsl\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"No. The word is disyllabic.
