    Analyzes a list of words to determine which has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.

    Trisyllabic laxing is a phonological rule that shortens a tense vowel
    when it is in the antepenultimate (third from the end) syllable.
    Therefore, words with fewer than three syllables are automatically disqualified.
