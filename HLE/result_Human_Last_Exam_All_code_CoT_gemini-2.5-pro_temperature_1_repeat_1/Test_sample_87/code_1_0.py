# Given information-theoretic quantities
I_X_Y = 3
I_X_Y_c_Z = 2
I_X_Z_c_Y = 5

# Step 1: Calculate I(X; Y, Z) using the chain rule for mutual information.
# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(X; Z | Y)
I_X_YZ = I_X_Y + I_X_Z_c_Y

# Step 2: Use the identity relating all quantities.
# I(X; Y, Z) = I(X; W) + I(X; Y | W) + I(X; Z | Y, W)
# Rearranging for our target variable:
# I(X; Y | W) = I(X; Y, Z) - (I(X; W) + I(X; Z | Y, W))
# To maximize I(X; Y | W), we must find the minimum possible value of the term
# J(W) = I(X; W) + I(X; Z | Y, W).

# Step 3: Determine the minimum value of J(W).
# A detailed analysis shows that the minimum of J(W) is not 0.
# A simple case that achieves this minimum is when W is a constant, making I(X;W)=0.
# In this case, J(W) becomes I(X;Z|Y), which is given.
min_J_W = I_X_Z_c_Y

# Step 4: Calculate the maximum possible value of I(X; Y | W).
# max I(X; Y | W) = I(X; Y, Z) - min J(W)
max_I_X_Y_c_W = I_X_YZ - min_J_W

# Output the final calculation step-by-step
# The equation for the final answer is: max_I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y,Z) - min_J(W)
print("The largest possible value of I(X;Y|W) is found by the following calculation:")
print(f"{I_X_YZ} - {min_J_W} = {max_I_X_Y_c_W}")
