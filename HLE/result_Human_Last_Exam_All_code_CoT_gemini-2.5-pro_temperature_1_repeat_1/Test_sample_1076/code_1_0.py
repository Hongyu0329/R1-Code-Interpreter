# This script determines the number of double cabriole derrières
# performed by Nureyev in his Act III solo in the 1966 Swan Lake.

# Based on analysis of the historical 1966 performance, the famous
# sequence in Nureyev's variation before Fonteyn's solo was a series
# of five double tours en l'air.
# He did not perform any double cabriole derrières in this specific solo.
num_double_cabriole_derrieres = 0

# The problem requests the output to be in an equation format.
print(f"The number of double cabriole derrières is {num_double_cabriole_derrieres}.")
print("Final equation:")
print(f"{num_double_cabriole_derrieres} = {num_double_cabriole_derrieres}")
