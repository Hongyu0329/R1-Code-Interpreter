    # (a) True or false: If P(u, v) = 0, then (u, v) is necessarily a critical point of J.
    # Answer: False. The Pohozaev identity is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function to be a critical point.
    answer_a = "False"
    
    # (b) Is it true that for any (u, v), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) is in P?
    # Answer: No. This property does not hold for all functions in the space. For instance,
    # it fails for the zero function and for functions where the relevant terms do not have the required signs.
    answer_b = "No"
    
    # (c) Must the minimiser of J on P(a,b) satisfy phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?
    # Answer: Yes. A minimizer of J on the Pohozaev manifold is a solution. For solutions,
    # and under standard assumptions on the nonlinearity (p > 2), this condition holds and is related
    # to the stability of the solution on the Nehari manifold.
