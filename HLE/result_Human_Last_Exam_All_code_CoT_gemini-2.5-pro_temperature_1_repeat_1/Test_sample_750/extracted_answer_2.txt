The solutions are of three types: 1. Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$. 2. An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions: $z_m = -i \frac{W_0((4m-1)\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\pi/2}$ for $m \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$, where $W_0$ is the principal branch of the Lambert W function. 3. An infinite set of other complex solutions for each integer $k$.
