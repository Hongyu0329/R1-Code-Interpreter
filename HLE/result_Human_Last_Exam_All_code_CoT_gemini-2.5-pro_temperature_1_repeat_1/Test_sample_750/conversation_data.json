    "To solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$, we need to consider the multi-valued nature of the complex exponentiation $i^z$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan to find all solutions:\n1.  First, we express the term $i^z$ using the complex logarithm. The complex logarithm of $i$ is given by $\\log i = \\ln|i| + i \\arg(i) = \\ln(1) + i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = i(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ for any integer $k$. Thus, $i^z = e^{z \\log i} = e^{z \\cdot i(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$.\n\n2.  Let $z = x+iy$. We substitute this into the original equation:\n    $(x+iy) \\cdot i = e^{(x+iy) \\cdot i(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$\n    $-y + ix = e^{-y(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cdot e^{ix(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$\n\n3.  By equating the real and imaginary parts, we get a system of two transcendental equations for $x$ and $y$, parameterized by the integer $k$:\n    - Real part: $-y = e^{-y(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos(x(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n    - Imaginary part: $x = e^{-y(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\sin(x(4k+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2})$\n\n4.  We find the solutions by analyzing different cases for $z$:\n    a. **Real solutions** ($y=0$): We can show that $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions for any integer $k$.\n    b. **Purely imaginary solutions** ($x=0$): An infinite number of solutions exist, but only when the integer parameter $k$ is negative. Letting $k = -m$ for $m \\ge 1$, these solutions can be expressed using the Lambert W function, $W(x)$, as $z_m = -i \\frac{W((4m-1)\\pi/2)}{(4m-1)\\pi/2}$.\n    c. **Other complex solutions** ($x\\neq 0, y\\neq 0$): There is another infinite set of solutions for which both real and imaginary parts are non-zero. These are the roots of the transcendental system for each $k$.\n\nThe following Python code will print the two real solutions and compute the first 5 purely imaginary solutions.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import lambertw\n\ndef solve_z_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints solutions to the equation z*i = i^z.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.

This is a solution.\n    z2 = -1\n    print(f\"z = {z2}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # 2. Purely imaginary solutions\n    # These solutions are of the form z = iy, where x=0.\n    # They exist for k = -m, where m is a positive integer (m >= 1).\n    # The solutions for y can be expressed with the Lambert W function:\n    # y_m = -W_0((4m-1)pi/2) / ((4m-1)pi/2)\n    print(\"Purely imaginary solutions (first 5):\")\n    \n    num_solutions_to_find = 5\n    for m in range(1, num_solutions_to_find + 1):\n        # Argument for the Lambert W function\n        arg = (4 * m - 1) * np.pi / 2\n        \n        # The Lambert W function W_0(x) is real for x >= 0.\n        # lambertw returns a complex number, so we take the real part.\n        w_val = lambertw(arg, k=0).real\n        \n        y_m = -w_val / arg\n        \n        # The solution is z_m = i * y_m\n        z_m = 1j * y_m\n        \n        # We need to output each number in the final equation,\n        # which we interpret as printing the solution z.\n        print(f\"z = {z_m:.10f} (for k = {-m})\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(\"Note: An infinite number of other complex solutions (where x!=0 and y!=0) also exist.\")\n\nsolve_z_equation()\n```\n<<<The solutions are of three types: 1.
