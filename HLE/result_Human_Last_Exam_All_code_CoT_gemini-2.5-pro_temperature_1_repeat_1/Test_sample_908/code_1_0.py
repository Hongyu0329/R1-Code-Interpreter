# Based on the derivation, the surface and volume charges are calculated.
# We found that the results for the surface charges q_s(a) and q_s(b) match option D.
# The volume charge q_v in option D is inconsistent with the surface charges,
# but since D is the best fit among the choices, we select it as the intended answer.

# To present the final answer in a formatted way as requested,
