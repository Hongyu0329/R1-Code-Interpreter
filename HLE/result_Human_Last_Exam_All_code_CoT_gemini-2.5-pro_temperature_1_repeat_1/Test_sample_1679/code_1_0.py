    Finds the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk.

    1. There are two Luxor Obelisks: one in Luxor, Egypt, and one in Paris, France.
    2. We will examine the Best Picture winners chronologically.
    3. The first winner set in either Paris or Luxor is our primary candidate.
    4. Film history confirms the first such winner is set in Paris.
