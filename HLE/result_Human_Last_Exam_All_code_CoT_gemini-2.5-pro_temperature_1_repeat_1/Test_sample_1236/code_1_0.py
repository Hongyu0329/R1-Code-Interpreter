# The number of equations corresponding to the positive eigenvalue th(t)
num_equations_case1 = 2024

# The number of solvability conditions for each of these equations
conditions_per_equation = 2

# The remaining infinite equations have 0 conditions each.

# Calculate the total number of solvability conditions
total_conditions = num_equations_case1 * conditions_per_equation

# The final equation to get the answer is num_equations_case1 * conditions_per_equation.
# We print all the numbers involved in this final calculation.
