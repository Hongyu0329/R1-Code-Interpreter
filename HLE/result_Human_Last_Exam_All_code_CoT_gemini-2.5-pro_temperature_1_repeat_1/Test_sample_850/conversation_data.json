    "The premise of your question contains a contradiction, which is important to understand. Here is a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1.  **Optical Activity and Symmetry:** A crystal can only be optically active (i.e., rotate the plane of polarized light) if its crystal structure is **chiral**.\n2.  **Chirality:** A structure is chiral if it is not superimposable on its mirror image. In terms of symmetry, this means the crystal class must **not** contain any rotoinversion axes, which include a center of symmetry (inversion, `overline{1}`) or mirror planes (`m`, which is equivalent to `overline{2}`).\n3.  **Achiral Crystal Classes:** An achiral crystal class is, by definition, one that is **not** chiral. This means it *does* possess at least one center of symmetry or a mirror plane.\n4.  **The Contradiction:** You are asking for crystal classes that are **achiral** but also have the symmetry for **optical activity** (which requires chirality). A crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. Therefore, the number of achiral crystal classes that are optically active is zero.\n\nIt is likely that you intended to ask for the **chiral** and **non-polar** crystal classes, as these are the optically active classes that are not also pyroelectric. The following Python script first confirms that there are no achiral optically active classes and then calculates the list for the re-interpreted question (chiral and non-polar).\n\n```python\ndef find_optically_active_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the 32 crystal classes to determine which ones fit certain criteria\n    related to optical activity, chirality, and polarity.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The 11 chiral (and therefore optically active) crystal classes.\n    # They lack mirror planes and an inversion center.\n    chiral_classes = {'1', '2', '222', '3', '32', '4', '422', '6', '622', '23', '432'}\n\n    # The 21 achiral crystal classes (all other classes).\n    all_32_classes = {\n        '1', '-1', '2', 'm', '2/m', '222', 'mm2', 'mmm', '3', '-3', '32',\n        '3m', '-3m', '4', '-4', '4/m', '422', '4mm', '-42m', '4/mmm', '6',\n        '-6', '6/m', '622', '6mm', '-6m2', '6/mmm', '23', 'm-3', '432', '-43m', 'm-3m'\n    }\n    achiral_classes = all_32_classes - chiral_classes\n\n    # The 10 polar (pyroelectric) crystal classes.\n    # They possess a unique polar direction.\n    polar_classes = {'1', '2', '3', '4', '6', 'm', 'mm2', '3m', '4mm', '6mm'}\n\n    print(\"--- Analyzing the User's Original Question ---\")\n    print(\"Question: Which 'achiral' crystal classes are optically active?\")\n    print(\"Principle: Optical activity requires a crystal class to be 'chiral'.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, we are looking for classes that are in both the 'achiral' set and the 'chiral' set.\")\n\n    # Find the intersection of achiral and chiral sets.
