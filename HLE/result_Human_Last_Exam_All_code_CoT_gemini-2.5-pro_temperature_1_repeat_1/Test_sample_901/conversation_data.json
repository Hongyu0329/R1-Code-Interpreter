    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to determine the product of the reaction:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Reagents:** The substrate is (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, a secondary alkyl halide. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base. This combination of reagents strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction mechanism.\n2.  **Determine Substrate Stereochemistry:** We need to figure out if the relationship between the bromine and methyl group is cis or trans. For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, an (S,R) or (R,S) configuration means the substituents are on the same side of the ring, which is a *cis* relationship.\n3.  **Identify the Reactive Conformation:** The E2 mechanism requires a specific geometry: the leaving group (bromine) and the hydrogen being removed must be in an anti-periplanar (diaxial) arrangement. For a *cis* isomer, this is only possible in the conformation where the leaving group (bromine) is axial and the methyl group is equatorial.\n4.  **Identify Possible Elimination Pathways:** In the reactive conformation (Br-axial, Me-equatorial), we look for axial hydrogens on the adjacent carbons (beta-hydrogens).\n    *   The hydrogen on C2 is axial and thus available for elimination. This would form **1-methylcyclohexene** (the more substituted, Zaitsev product).\n    *   The hydrogen on C6 is also axial and available for elimination. This would form **3-methylcyclohexene** (the less substituted, Hofmann product).\n5.  **Apply Selectivity Rules:** Since two pathways are possible, we must consider the nature of the base. Potassium tert-butoxide is very large and sterically hindered. Bulky bases preferentially remove the more sterically accessible proton, which leads to the formation of the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product).\n6.  **Conclusion:** The major product will be the Hofmann product, **3-methylcyclohexene**.\n\nHere is the Python code that walks through this logic to identify the product.\n\n```python\ndef identify_elimination_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide\n    and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the reaction components\n    substrate = \"(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\"\n    reagent = \"potassium tert-butoxide\"\n    \n    # Print the analysis steps\n    print(\"### Reaction Analysis ###\\n\")\n    print(f\"Substrate: {substrate}\")\n    print(f\"Reagent: {reagent}\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 1: Determine the reaction mechanism ---\")\n    print(\"The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide and the reagent is a strong, bulky base.\")\n    print(\"This combination strongly favors an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 2: Analyze the stereochemistry of the substrate ---\")\n    print(f\"The stereochemistry of the substrate is (1S,2R).\")\n    print(\"For a 1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane, an (S,R) or (R,S) configuration indicates a 'cis' isomer.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the starting material is cis-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"--- Step 3: Identify the reactive chair conformation ---\")\n    print(\"The E2 reaction requires the leaving group (Br) and a beta-hydrogen to be anti-periplanar (i.e., both axial).\")\n    print(\"For a cis-1,2 isomer, this is only possible in the conformation where Br is axial and the methyl group is equatorial.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Step 4: Identify possible elimination pathways ---\")\n    print(\"In the reactive conformation (Br-axial, Me-equatorial), we check the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) for axial hydrogens:\")\n    print(\"  - At C2: The hydrogen is axial.
