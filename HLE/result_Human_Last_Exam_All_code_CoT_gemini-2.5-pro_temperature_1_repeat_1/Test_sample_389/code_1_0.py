    print(" - Options A, B, C, D, E, F, G introduce tonal centers and notes that are distant and highly unusual for a standard Bayati taqsim.")
    print(" - Option I (Jins Saba on D) would mean changing the maqam entirely to Saba, rather than a temporary modulation within a Bayati taqsim.")
    
    print("\nNow, let's look at the correct choice:")
    print(" - Option H: Move to Jins Saba on E.")
    print("   - The 'E' in this context refers to the second degree of Bayati on D, which is E-half-flat.")
    print("   - Shifting the tonal focus to the second degree (E-half-flat) and improvising with Jins Saba is a classic, very common, and emotionally powerful modulation in a Bayati taqsim.")
    print("   - This specific modulation is the defining characteristic of Maqam Bayati Shuri, a famous variant of Bayati.")
    print("   - Any performer of Arabic music would immediately recognize this as a standard and idiomatic progression.")
