    explanation = """
The problem described is a well-known puzzle in mathematics called the 'Three Utilities Problem'. To solve it, we must analyze its structure using graph theory.

1.  **Graph Representation:**
    *   We have two distinct sets of vertices: 3 houses and 3 utilities.
    *   This structure forms a 'complete bipartite graph' known as K_3,3.
    *   Number of Vertices (V) = 3 (houses) + 3 (utilities) = 6.
    *   Number of Edges (E): Each of the 3 houses must connect to all 3 utilities, so E = 3 * 3 = 9.

2.  **The Core Question: Is K_3,3 Planar?**
    The problem's constraint that no lines can cross is equivalent to asking if the graph K_3,3 is 'planar'. We can prove that it is not, using Euler's formula for planar graphs.

3.  **Proof by Contradiction using Euler's Formula:**
    *   Euler's formula for any connected planar graph is: V - E + F = 2, where F is the number of faces (regions bounded by edges).
    *   Let's assume K_3,3 *is* planar and plug in our values:
        *   6 - 9 + F = 2
        *   -3 + F = 2
        *   This implies that if the graph were planar, it must have F = 5 faces.

    *   Now, let's consider the properties of the K_3,3 graph. Since no house is connected to another house and no utility is connected to another utility, there are no 3-edge cycles (triangles). The shortest possible cycle is of length 4 (e.g., House1 -> Water -> House2 -> Gas -> House1).
    *   Therefore, every face in a planar drawing must be bounded by at least 4 edges.
    *   If we sum the edge counts for all faces, we get a value of at least 4 * F.
    *   Since each edge is a boundary for exactly two faces, the sum of edge counts is also equal to 2 * E.
    *   This gives us the inequality: 4 * F <= 2 * E.
    *   Let's plug in our known values for E and the required value for F:
        *   E = 9
        *   F = 5 (from Euler's formula)
        *   4 * 5 <= 2 * 9
        *   20 <= 18

    *   This statement, 20 <= 18, is a clear mathematical contradiction.

4.  **Conclusion:**
    The contradiction proves that our initial assumption—that K_3,3 can be drawn on a plane without crossing lines—is false. It is mathematically impossible to fulfill the conditions of the puzzle. Kuratowski's theorem in graph theory also formally states that K_3,3 is a non-planar graph.

    The prompt's claim that "there is a solution" is a classic misdirection in this puzzle. Given the strict constraints forbidding any tricks, loopholes, or non-planar surfaces, the problem has no solution. Choice E is the only one that correctly reflects this mathematical fact.
