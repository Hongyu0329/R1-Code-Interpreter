    "To determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory, we need to analyze the relationship between the topological properties of the diagram.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant formula:** The number of loops (L) in a connected Feynman diagram is related to the number of internal lines (I) and vertices (V) by the formula:\n    `L = I - V + 1`\n\n2.  **Relate lines to vertices:** For a theory with an n-point interaction (like $\\phi^n$), each vertex connects `n` lines. These lines are either internal (propagators) or external (incoming/outgoing particles). This gives the relation:\n    `n * V = 2 * I + E`\n    where E is the number of external lines.\n\n3.  **Combine the formulas:** We can express `V` in terms of `L`, `E`, and `n`. By solving the second equation for `I` and substituting into the first, we can find the number of vertices required for a given number of loops, external lines, and interaction type.\n\n4.  **Find the minimum:** To find the *minimum* number of vertices, we will write a Python script to check the most common and simplest interaction types (`\\phi^3` and `\\phi^4`) and the simplest diagram configuration (a vacuum diagram, which has `E=0` external lines). The script will calculate the required number of vertices for a two-loop diagram (`L=2`) and find the minimum possible integer value.\n\nThe script will iterate through these possibilities, check if the resulting number of vertices and internal lines are valid integers, and report the minimum configuration.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_minimum_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices for a two-loop Feynman diagram\n    in a scalar field theory by checking common interaction types.\n    \"\"\"\n    loops = 2\n    min_vertices = float('inf')\n    best_config = {}\n\n    # Check for common interaction types (n-point vertices)\n    # n=3 for phi^3 theory, n=4 for phi^4 theory\n    for n in [3, 4]:\n        # To find the minimum V, we should start with the minimum E.\n        # The simplest diagrams are vacuum diagrams (E=0).\n        # We check a few small even values for E.\n        for E in [0, 2, 4]:\n            # From L = I - V + 1 and n*V = 2*I + E, we derive:\n            # I = (n*V - E)/2\n            # L = (n*V - E)/2 - V + 1\n            # L - 1 + E/2 = V * (n/2 - 1)\n            # V = (L - 1 + E/2) / (n/2 - 1)\n            \n            # Avoid division by zero for n<=2\n            if (n / 2 - 1) == 0:\n                continue\n\n            # Calculate the required number of vertices\n            V = (loops - 1 + E / 2) / (n / 2 - 1)\n\n            # A valid diagram must have a positive integer number of vertices.\n            # We check if V is a positive integer (within a small tolerance for float issues).\n            if V > 0 and abs(V - round(V)) < 1e-9:\n                V = int(round(V))\n                \n                # Check if the corresponding number of internal lines is a non-negative integer.\n                # I = (n*V - E) / 2\n                I_numerator = n * V - E\n                if I_numerator >= 0 and I_numerator % 2 == 0:\n                    I = I_numerator // 2\n                    \n                    # We have found a valid configuration.
