    "To compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, we will follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Decomposition of the Lie algebra**: We identify the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$. It can be seen as a fiber product of two smaller, more manageable Lie algebras, $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$, over a common subalgebra $\\mathfrak{g}_C$.\n    *   Let $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ be the 4-dimensional subalgebra with basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ and relations $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4$. This is a well-known filiform nilpotent Lie algebra.\n    *   Let $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ be the 3-dimensional subalgebra with basis $\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$ and relation $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This is the famous Heisenberg Lie algebra.\n    *   The common subalgebra is $\\mathfrak{g}_C = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$, which is the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra.\n    *   The original algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the pullback or fiber product of $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ over $\\mathfrak{g}_C$.\n\n2.  **Poincaré Polynomial Formula**: For such a fiber product structure, the Poincaré polynomial of the total algebra can be computed from the polynomials of its components. The formula is:\n    $P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_A}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{g}_B}(x)}{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_C}(x)}$\n    This formula arises from the structure of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex, which is a minimal Sullivan algebra for nilpotent Lie algebras.\n\n3.  **Compute Component Polynomials**: We'll compute the Poincaré polynomial for each component algebra by determining their Betti numbers.\n    *   For $\\mathfrak{g}_A$, the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4) = (1, 2, 2, 2, 1)$. Thus, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_A}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n    *   For $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ (the Heisenberg algebra), the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3) = (1, 2, 2, 1)$. Thus, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_B}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3$.\n    *   For $\\mathfrak{g}_C$ (the abelian algebra), the Betti numbers are $(b_0, b_1) = (1, 1)$. Thus, $P_{\\mathfrak{g}_C}(x) = 1 + x$.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: We substitute these polynomials into the formula and expand the result to get the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan. It defines the component polynomials and uses a function for polynomial multiplication to compute the final result.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef poly_to_string(p, var='x'):\n    \"\"\"Converts a list of polynomial coefficients into a string representation.\"\"\"\n    res = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(p):\n        if coeff == 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Coefficient part\n        if i > 0:\n            sign = \" + \" if coeff > 0 else \" - \"\n            coeff_val = abs(coeff)\n        else: # i == 0\n            sign = \"\" if coeff > 0 else \"-\"\n            coeff_val = abs(coeff)\n\n        if coeff_val == 1 and i != 0:\n            coeff_str = \"\"\n        else:\n            coeff_str = str(coeff_val)\n\n        # Variable part\n        if i == 0:\n            var_str = \"\"\n        elif i == 1:\n            var_str = f\"{var}\"\n        else:\n            var_str = f\"{var}^{i}\"\n            \n        # Asterisk for multiplication\n        if coeff_str and var_str:\n            asterisk = \"*\"\n        else:\n            asterisk = \"\"\n\n        term = f\"{sign}{coeff_str}{asterisk}{var_str}\"\n        res.append(term)\n        \n    # Join terms, handling the leading '+' for positive polynomials\n    if res[0].startswith(\" + \"):\n        res[0] = res[0][3:]\n    return \"\".join(res)\n\ndef print_poly_equation(p, var='x'):\n    \"\"\"Prints the polynomial in a format showing each number.\"\"\"\n    terms = []\n    for i, coeff in enumerate(p):\n        if coeff == 0 and len(p) > 1:\n            continue\n        \n        # variable part\n        if i == 0:\n            var_part = \"\"\n        elif i == 1:\n            var_part = f\" * {var}\"\n        else:\n            var_part = f\" * {var}^{i}\"\n\n        terms.append(f\"{coeff}{var_part}\")\n    \n    print(\" + \".join(terms))\n\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Poincaré polynomial for the given Lie algebra.\n    \"\"\"\n    # P_A(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4\n    p_A = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]\n    \n    # P_B(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3\n    p_B = [1, 2, 2, 1]\n    \n    # P_C(x) = 1 + x\n    p_C = [1, 1]\n\n    # Calculate P_g(x) = P_A(x) * P_B(x) / P_C(x)\n    # This is equivalent to (P_A(x) / P_C(x)) * P_B(x)\n    # P_A(x) / P_C(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) / (1 + x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3\n    p_A_div_C = np.polydiv(p_A[::-1], p_C[::-1])[0][::-1]\n    \n    # Now multiply (P_A(x)/P_C(x)) with P_B(x)\n    p_g = np.convolve(p_A_div_C, p_B).astype(int).tolist()\n\n    print(\"The Poincaré polynomial is P(x) = \", end=\"\")\n    print_poly_equation(p_g, var='x')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n```\n<<<1 + 3 * x + 5 * x^2 + 6 * x^3 + 5 * x^4 + 3 * x^5 + 1 * x^6>>>"
