# The number of terminal pairs in the Multicut problem.
k = 10**6

# According to the Garg-Vazirani-Yannakakis (GVY) algorithm, the Multicut
# problem has a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with an approximation
# factor of O(log k). We calculate the value of log(k) to verify the
# value in the correct answer choice. The value provided in the options (≈13.8)
# indicates the use of the natural logarithm (base e).

approximation_factor = math.log(k)

# The final answer format requires printing each number in the final equation.
# Here, the equation is alpha <= log(k).
