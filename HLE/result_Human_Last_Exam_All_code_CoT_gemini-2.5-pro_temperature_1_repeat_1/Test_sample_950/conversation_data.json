    "To find the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology ring of the space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, we follow a well-established procedure from algebraic topology.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Space**: The space of $3$-subspaces of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is the real Grassmannian manifold $Gr_3(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. There is a diffeomorphism $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n) \\cong Gr_{n-k}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, so we can analyze the simpler but equivalent space $Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$. Let's call this space $X$. The dimension of $X$ is $k(n-k) = 2(5-2) = 6$.\n\n2.  **Understand the Cohomology Structure**: The integral cohomology groups $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ of a real Grassmannian are known to have only 2-torsion. This means each $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})$ is a direct sum of some number of copies of $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. The \"rank of the torsion subgroup\" is the total count of these $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$ summands across all degrees $i$.\n\n3.  **Use the Universal Coefficient Theorem**: The ranks of the free and torsion parts are related to the dimensions of cohomology groups with other coefficients. Let:\n    *   $r_i = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}))$, the rank of the free part (the rational Betti number).\n    *   $t_i = \\text{rank}_{\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}}(\\text{Tors}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z})))$, the rank of the torsion part.\n    *   $b_i = \\dim_{\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}}(H^i(X; \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}))$, the mod 2 Betti number.\n\n    These quantities are linked by the formula: $b_i = r_i + t_i + t_{i+1}$.\n\n4.  **Calculate Betti Numbers**:\n    *   The mod 2 Betti numbers, $b_i$, for $Gr_k(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ are given by the number of Schubert cells of dimension $i$. For $Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, these are known to be $b = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1)$ for $i=0, \\dots, 6$.\n    *   The rational Betti numbers, $r_i$, are the dimensions of the rational cohomology groups $H^i(X; \\mathbb{Q})$. For $Gr_2(\\mathbb{R}^5)$, the rational cohomology is generated by the first Pontryagin class $p_1$ in degree 4. Thus, $r_0=1$, $r_4=1$, and all other $r_i$ are zero.\n\n5.  **Solve for Torsion Ranks**: With the values for $b_i$ and $r_i$, and knowing that $t_0=0$ (since $H^0(X;\\mathbb{Z})=\\mathbb{Z}$), we can use the formula iteratively to find $t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_6$. The total rank of the torsion subgroup is the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^6 t_i$.\n\nThe following Python script implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_grassmannian_torsion_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rank of the torsion subgroup of the integral cohomology\n    ring of the space of 3-subspaces of R^5, which is the real Grassmannian Gr(3, 5).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The space of 3-subspaces of R^5 is the Grassmannian Gr(3, R^5).\n    # By a standard diffeomorphism, Gr(k, R^n) is equivalent to Gr(n-k, R^n).\n    # So, Gr(3, R^5) is diffeomorphic to Gr(2, R^5).
