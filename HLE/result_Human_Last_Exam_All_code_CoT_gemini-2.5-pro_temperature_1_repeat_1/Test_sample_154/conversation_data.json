    "To solve this problem, I will write a Python script that systematically counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple non-isomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Generate Graphs**: I will use a pre-computed list of all 34 simple non-isomorphic graphs on 5 vertices. These graphs are represented in the compact `graph6` format. Using a pre-computed list makes the code self-contained and avoids reliance on external tools.\n2.  **Check Connectivity**: For each of the 34 graphs, the script will:\n    a. Parse the `graph6` string into a `networkx` graph object.\n    b. Determine if the graph is 2-vertex-connected. A graph is k-vertex-connected if it remains connected after removing any k-1 vertices. In `networkx`, this can be determined by checking if the `node_connectivity` of the graph is 2 or greater.\n3.  **Count and Categorize**: The script will keep a running count of the graphs that meet the 2-vertex-connected criterion. It will also categorize these graphs by their number of edges.\n4.  **Display Results**: Finally, the script will print the number of 2-vertex-connected graphs found for each edge count, followed by the total sum, presenting it as an equation as requested.\n\nThis method is exhaustive and guarantees a correct count by checking every possible case.\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_biconnected_graphs_on_5_vertices():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic\n    graphs with 5 vertices.
