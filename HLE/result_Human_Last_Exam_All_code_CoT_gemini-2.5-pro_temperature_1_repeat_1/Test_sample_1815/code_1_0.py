    This function explains the reasoning behind the answer.
    
    Let G be the group of integers. We are looking for the number of group topologies on G that are:
    1. Totally bounded
    2. Have no nontrivial convergent sequences (SNC property)

    A group topology on G is totally bounded if its completion is a compact group.
    Any such topology on the integers can be analyzed through its group of continuous characters, which is an infinite subgroup of the circle group S^1.

    A sequence (x_n) converges to 0 if and only if for every continuous character chi, chi(x_n) -> 1.
    The SNC property means that if a sequence converges, it must be eventually constant.

    Case 1: The topology is not Hausdorff.
    The closure of {0} is a non-trivial subgroup, say k*Z for k > 1. The open sets are unions of cosets of k*Z.
    The sequence x_n = n*k is a non-trivial sequence (it's not eventually 0).
    For any open neighborhood U of 0, k*Z is a subset of U. Since x_n is always in k*Z, x_n is in U for all n.
    So, x_n converges to 0. This violates the SNC property. Thus, no non-Hausdorff topology works.

    Case 2: The topology is Hausdorff.
    Any Hausdorff totally bounded topology on the integers has an infinite character group C, a subgroup of S^1.
    It can be shown that for any such infinite group C, one can always construct a sequence of distinct, non-zero integers (x_n) that converges to 0.
    For example, for the p-adic topology, the sequence x_n = p^n converges to 0.
    For the Bohr topology (where C = S^1), the sequence x_n = n! converges to 0.
    This principle holds more generally. For any such topology, a non-trivial sequence converging to 0 can be found.

    Conclusion: No totally bounded group topology on the integers has the SNC property.
    Therefore, the number of such topologies is 0.
