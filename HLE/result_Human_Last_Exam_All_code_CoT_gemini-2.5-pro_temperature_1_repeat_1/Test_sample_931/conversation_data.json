    "To determine what adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) feed on, I will follow these steps:\n1.  Establish a knowledge base about the diet of adult snakeflies based on entomological facts. They are known to be predators of small, soft-bodied insects but also supplement their diet.\n2.  Evaluate each of the single-item answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) against this knowledge base.\n3.  Evaluate the combined answer choices (F, G) based on the validity of their individual components.\n4.  The script will print the step-by-step evaluation and then conclude with the most accurate and comprehensive answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_diet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates diet choices for adult Raphidiopterans based on known facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish a knowledge base.\n    # Facts about adult Raphidopteran (snakefly) diet.\n    # They are primarily predatory but also feed on pollen/nectar.\n    knowledge_base = {\n        'primary_food': ['aphids', 'mites', 'insect eggs', 'other small soft-bodied arthropods'],\n        'supplementary_food': ['nectar', 'pollen'],\n        'is_herbivore': False, # They don't eat leaf tissue\n        'is_fungivore': False   # They don't eat fungus\n    }\n\n    # Answer choices from the user\n    choices = {\n        'A': 'Nectar',\n        'B': 'Māhoe pollen',\n        'C': 'Fungus',\n        'D': 'Karamū leaf tissue',\n        'E': 'Totara Aphids',\n        'F': ['A', 'E'],\n        'G': ['D', 'E']\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    # Step 2: Evaluate individual choices\n    a_is_correct = 'nectar' in knowledge_base['supplementary_food']\n    print(f\"A.
