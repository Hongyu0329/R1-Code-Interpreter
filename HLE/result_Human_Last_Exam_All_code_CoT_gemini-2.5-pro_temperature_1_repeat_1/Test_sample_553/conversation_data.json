    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to identify the song:\n\n1.  First, I need to understand the music theory terms in the request. The \"tonic\" is the home chord of a key (the I chord). The \"fifth\" is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. A \"minor fifth\" means this fifth chord is a minor chord (a v chord), which is common in a minor key or can be \"borrowed\" in a major key.\n2.  Next, I will analyze the opening chord progressions of well-known Beatles songs to find one that matches this specific \"tonic to minor fifth\" movement.\n3.  The song \"Michelle\" from the album *Rubber Soul* is a strong candidate. The verse is in the key of F minor. The tonic chord is F minor.\n4.  The opening phrase \"Michelle, ma belle\" starts on the tonic chord (F minor) and moves directly to a C minor chord.\n5.  In the key of F minor, the fifth note of the scale is C. The chord built from the natural minor scale on that note is C minor. Therefore, the progression from F minor to C minor is a clear jump from the tonic to the minor fifth.\n6.  I will write a Python script to print this finding.\n\n```python\ndef find_beatles_song():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and explains the Beatles song\n    that begins with a chord progression from the tonic to the minor fifth.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Michelle\"\n    album = \"Rubber Soul\"\n    key = \"F minor\"\n    tonic_chord = \"F minor (i)\"\n    minor_fifth_chord = \"C minor (v)\"\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth chord is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is a brief analysis:\")\n    print(f\"1. The song's verse is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(f\"2. The progression occurs on the opening line 'Michelle, ma belle...'.\")\n    print(f\"3. The song moves from the tonic chord, {tonic_chord}, to the minor fifth chord, {minor_fifth_chord}.\")\n    print(f\"4. This harmonic move is a defining feature of the song's sophisticated sound.\")\n\nfind_beatles_song()\n```\n<<<Michelle>>>"
