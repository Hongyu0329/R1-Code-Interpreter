    # Step 1: The problem asks for the number of values of n where [0,1]^n
    # cannot be the set of non-block points, N(X), for any continuum X.

    # Step 2: A key theorem by R. W. FitzGerald (1969) states that for a continuum X,
    # the set of its non-block points, N(X), is identical to the set of points
    # where X is locally connected, LC(X).
    # So, we are looking for the number of n where [0,1]^n cannot be LC(X).

    # Step 3: A theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz provides a way to construct a continuum
    # with a specific set of locally connected points. It states that for any
    # Peano continuum P and any G_delta subset M of P, there exists a continuum X
    # such that LC(X) = M.

    # Step 4: We apply this theorem for each n.
    # We want to check if M = [0,1]^n can be the set LC(X).
    # For any n >= 1, the n-cube P = [0,1]^n is a Peano continuum (it is compact,
    # connected, and locally connected).
    # The set M = [0,1]^n is a closed subset of the metric space P = [0,1]^n.
    # In any metric space, every closed set is a G_delta set (a countable
    # intersection of open sets).
    # So, M = [0,1]^n is a G_delta subset of P = [0,1]^n.

    # Step 5: Since the conditions of Mazurkiewicz's theorem are met for every n >= 1,
    # we can conclude that for every n=1, 2, 3, ..., there exists a continuum X
    # such that LC(X) = [0,1]^n.
    # By FitzGerald's theorem, this means for every n, there exists a continuum X
    # such that N(X) = [0,1]^n.

    # Step 6: The question asks for the number of n for which the n-cube FAILS to occur.
    # Our conclusion is that it never fails.
