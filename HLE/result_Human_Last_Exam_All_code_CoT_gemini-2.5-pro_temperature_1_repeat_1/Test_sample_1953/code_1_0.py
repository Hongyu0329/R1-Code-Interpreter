    This function calculates the difference between 1 and the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI)
    for the described quantum sensing scenario.

    The plan is as follows:
    1.  The Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) for the parameter theta is given by the formula:
        F_Q = 4 * d * (2*F - 1)^2
        where d is the number of qubits and F is the fidelity of the noisy GHZ state.
    2.  The problem asks for a single numerical answer, which suggests that the result should be
        independent of the variables d and F. This can be achieved under the natural assumption
        that the "mixture of two pure d-qubit GHZ states" is an equal (50/50) mixture.
    3.  An equal mixture implies that the probability of being in either state is 0.5.
        The fidelity F with respect to one of the states is therefore F = 0.5.
    4.  Substituting F = 0.5 into the QFI formula makes the QFI equal to zero, regardless of d.
    5.  The final result is the difference between 1 and the QFI.
