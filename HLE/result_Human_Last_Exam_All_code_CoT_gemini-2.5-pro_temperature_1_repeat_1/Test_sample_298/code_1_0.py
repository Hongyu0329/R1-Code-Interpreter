def solve_cohomology_m7():
    """
    This function prints the list of cohomology groups for the moduli space M(7).
    
    The moduli space M(k) of k disjoint line segments in R^2 is homotopy equivalent
    to the configuration space of k points in R^2, B_k(R^2). The cohomology of this space
    is the group cohomology of the k-strand braid group, B_k.

    While H^*(B_k) is infinite-dimensional, the problem asks for a list up to a maximal
    degree, suggesting a natural truncation. We provide the cohomology groups up to
    degree k-1 = 6, which is a standard range to consider.

    The integral cohomology groups of B_7 are taken from the work of V.V. Goryunov.
