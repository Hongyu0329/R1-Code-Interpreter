    "Based on publicly available drug identification data, I will identify the numerical imprints on Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for the 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Find the specific numerical code imprinted on the 10mg Teva fluoxetine capsule.\n2.  Find the specific numerical code imprinted on the 20mg Teva fluoxetine capsule.\n3.  Create a Python script that stores these two different numbers.\n4.  The script will then print a sentence clearly stating which number corresponds to which dosage, thereby highlighting the difference.\n\n```python\ndef find_imprint_differences():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the different numerical imprints on\n    Teva brand fluoxetine capsules for 10mg and 20mg dosages.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The numerical imprint for Teva brand 10mg fluoxetine capsules is \"3105\"\n    imprint_10mg = \"3105\"\n    \n    # The numerical imprint for Teva brand 20mg fluoxetine capsules is \"3109\"\n    imprint_20mg = \"3109\"\n    \n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is {imprint_10mg}.\")\n    print(f\"The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is {imprint_20mg}.\")\n\nfind_imprint_differences()\n```\n<<<3105 and 3109>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
