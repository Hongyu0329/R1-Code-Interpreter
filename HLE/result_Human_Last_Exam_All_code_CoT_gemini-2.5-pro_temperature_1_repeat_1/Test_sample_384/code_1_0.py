Step-by-step Analysis:
1.  Options B, C, D, and G represent common and logical reasons for alterations or gaps in historical documents: censorship (B), political redaction (C), state-level secrecy (D), and physical decay (G). These are all highly plausible.

2.  Options E and F are plausible within the specific context of ninjutsu. Secret arts often rely on hidden information (E, invisible ink) or a combination of written mnemonics and oral teachings (F) to protect their secrets.

3.  Option A, where the author himself erases his own work to discredit it, is psychologically convoluted. It's more likely he would have simply omitted the section. While not impossible, it's less straightforward than other theories.

4.  Option H presents the least plausible scenario. It combines multiple, culturally distinct, and anachronistic esoteric concepts. The Kujiho are Japanese esoteric Buddhist hand seals. Chakras are a concept from Hindu and Tantric traditions not native to Japanese Shinto or Taoism in this form. While Taoist concepts existed in Japan, linking them to Kujiho, chakras, and 'erotic energy rituals' as a single explanation is a complex and unsupported synthesis that smells of modern New Age invention rather than 17th-century Japanese thought. The likelihood of multiple, independent transcribers misinterpreting this supposed complex system in the exact same way is virtually zero.

Conclusion:
The theory in option H is the most convoluted and least supported by historical and cultural evidence, making it the least plausible.
