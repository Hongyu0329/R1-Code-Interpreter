    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-zero components of the Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ for the Schwarzschild metric, which describes the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric body of mass $M$.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Metric**: The spacetime is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal. Using units where the speed of light $c=1$ and the gravitational constant $G=1$, its components are:\n    *   $g_{tt} = -(1 - 2M/r)$\n    *   $g_{rr} = (1 - 2M/r)^{-1}$\n    *   $g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2$\n    *   $g_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n    These components only depend on the coordinates $r$ and $\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Recall the Formula**: The Christoffel symbols are calculated from the metric and its derivatives using the formula:\n    $$ \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right) $$\n    where $g^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is the inverse metric tensor.\n\n3.  **Symbolic Calculation**: Manually calculating all $4 \\times 10 = 40$ unique components is tedious. I will write a Python script using the `sympy` library to perform this calculation symbolically.\n\n4.  **Code Logic**:\n    *   I will define the coordinates and the Schwarzschild metric tensor symbolically in `sympy`.\n    *   The script will then compute the inverse metric and the necessary partial derivatives of the metric components.\n    *   It will loop through all indices $(\\rho, \\mu, \\nu)$ with $\\mu \\le \\nu$ (to handle the symmetry $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Gamma^\\rho_{\\nu\\mu}$ and count only unique symbols).\n    *   For each combination, it will calculate $\\Gamma^\\rho_{\\mu\\nu}$ using the formula and check if the result is non-zero after simplification.\n    *   The script will print each unique non-zero symbol and its derived formula.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: To provide a clear answer, the script will tally the number of non-zero symbols for each value of the upper index $\\rho$. The final output will be an equation summing these counts to give the total number of unique non-zero Christoffel symbols.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef calculate_christoffel_symbols():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function symbolically calculates the non-zero Christoffel symbols\n    for the Schwarzschild metric and prints the results.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
