# The number of stable equilibrium points, m, was found to be 1.
m = 1

# The second term in the expression is 2^4048.
# Python can handle very large integers, so we can calculate this directly.

# Now, we calculate the final result of m - 2^4048.
result = m - power_of_two

# Print the final equation with each number explicitly shown, as requested.
# The format will be: m - (2^4048) = result
