    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded, we can use a formula from topological quantum error correction. The number of logical qubits, `k`, that can be encoded on a surface is given by the formula `k = 2g + b - 1`, where:\n\n*   `g` is the genus of the surface, which corresponds to the number of \"handles\" or holes in the surface.\n*   `b` is the number of boundaries, which corresponds to the number of separate, disconnected patches of the code.\n\nIn your specific case:\n*   You have **two holes**, so `g = 2`.\n*   You have **two patches** of surface code, so `b = 2`.\n\nThe following Python script will apply this formula to calculate the number of logical qubits.\n\n```python\n# Number of holes, which corresponds to the genus (g) of the surface.\ng = 2\n\n# Number of separate patches, which corresponds to the number of boundaries (b).\nb = 2\n\n# The formula for the number of logical qubits (k) is k = 2g + b - 1.\nk = 2 * g + b - 1\n\n# Print the final equation with the values plugged in.\nprint(f\"The number of logical qubits is calculated as: 2 * {g} + {b} - 1 = {k}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
