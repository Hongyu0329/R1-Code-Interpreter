    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will access my knowledge base regarding the legal history of the modern State of Israel.\nSecond, I will search for the first statute that explicitly codified the principle of \"good faith\" (תום לב) as a general duty in civil law.\nFinally, I will use a Python script to print the name of this statute as the answer, adhering to your formatting requirements.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_statute_with_good_faith():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function identifies and prints the name of the first statute in the modern\n  State of Israel to explicitly introduce the concept of \"good faith\" as a\n  foundational principle in civil law.\n  \"\"\"\n  statute_name = \"Contracts (General Part) Law\"\n  print(statute_name)\n\nfind_first_statute_with_good_faith()\n```\n<<<Contracts (General Part) Law>>>"
