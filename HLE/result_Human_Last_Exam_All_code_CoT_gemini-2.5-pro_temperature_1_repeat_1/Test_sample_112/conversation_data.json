    "My plan is to first identify the manuscript in which the Middle English romance \"Sir Launfal\" is preserved. Then, I will research the other contents of that same manuscript to find a text that can be described as a \"book of manners.\" Finally, I will write a Python script to print this information as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_accompanying_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the name of the book of manners\n    preserved alongside the poem \"Sir Launfal\".\n    \"\"\"\n    # The poem \"Sir Launfal\" is found in the manuscript Cotton Caligula A.ii.\n    # This manuscript contains a collection of Middle English texts.\n    manuscript = \"Cotton Caligula A.ii\"\n    \n    # Among the other works in this manuscript is a courtesy book, or a \"book of manners\".\n    book_of_manners = \"The Book of Curtesye\"\n    alternate_title = \"Lytylle Childrenes Lytil Boke\"\n\n    print(f\"The poem 'Sir Launfal' is preserved in the manuscript {manuscript}.\")\n    print(f\"Alongside it is a book of manners known as '{book_of_manners}' (also called '{alternate_title}').\")\n\nfind_accompanying_book()\n```\n<<<The Book of Curtesye>>>"
