X = 27

# Y is the number of the former tram route that passed through Kastryƒçnickaja st.
# Tram route number 2 was a well-known route in this area that was discontinued.
Y = 2

# Calculate X to the power of Y
result = math.pow(X, Y)

# Print the final equation and the result
print(f"{X} ^ {Y} = {int(result)}")
