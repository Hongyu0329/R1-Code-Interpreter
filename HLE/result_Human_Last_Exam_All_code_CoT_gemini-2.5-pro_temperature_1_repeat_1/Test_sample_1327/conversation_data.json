    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to find the pattern in the sequence:\n\n1.  **Analyze the initial sequence:** The given sequence is 2, 11, 23, 51, 119.\n\n2.  **Look for a simple relationship:** Let's see if there's a pattern involving multiplication and addition/subtraction between consecutive terms. A common pattern is `next_term = (constant * current_term) + another_constant`. Let's try multiplying by 2, as the numbers are roughly doubling.\n    *   `2 * 2 = 4`. To get to 11, we need to add 7. So, `11 = 2 * 2 + 7`.\n    *   `2 * 11 = 22`. To get to 23, we need to add 1. So, `23 = 2 * 11 + 1`.\n    *   `2 * 23 = 46`. To get to 51, we need to add 5. So, `51 = 2 * 23 + 5`.\n    *   `2 * 51 = 102`. To get to 119, we need to add 17. So, `119 = 2 * 51 + 17`.\n\n3.  **Analyze the added numbers:** The pattern for the main sequence is `x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k`, where `k` is a sequence of numbers. The first term doesn't seem to fit the same subsequent pattern, which is common in such puzzles. Let's analyze the sequence of `k` starting from the second operation: `1, 5, 17`.\n\n4.  **Find the pattern for the 'k' sequence:** Let's examine the relationship between the terms in the sequence `1, 5, 17`.\n    *   How do we get from 1 to 5? `5 = 3 * 1 + 2`.\n    *   Let's test if this pattern (`new_k = 3 * old_k + 2`) holds for the next term.\n    *   `3 * 5 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17`. Yes, it holds.\n\n5.  **Apply the pattern to find the next terms:**\n    *   First, find the next `k` value: `next_k = 3 * 17 + 2 = 51 + 2 = 53`.\n    *   Now, use this `next_k` to find the next term in the main sequence: `next_term = 2 * 119 + next_k`.\n    *   `next_term = 2 * 119 + 53 = 238 + 53 = 291`.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The next number in the sequence is 291.\n\n```python\ndef solve_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the number sequence puzzle by identifying a two-level pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The given sequence\n    sequence = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n    print(f\"The initial sequence is: {', '.join(map(str, sequence))}, ...\")\n\n    # The pattern is x_n = 2 * x_{n-1} + k, where k itself follows a pattern.\n    # We establish this pattern starting from the third term.\n    # For the term 23:\n    k1 = sequence[2] - 2 * sequence[1]\n    # For the term 51:\n    k2 = sequence[3] - 2 * sequence[2]\n    # For the term 119:\n    k3 = sequence[4] - 2 * sequence[3]\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Find the relationship between terms.\")\n    print(f\"{sequence[2]} = 2 * {sequence[1]} + {k1}\")\n    print(f\"{sequence[3]} = 2 * {sequence[2]} + {k2}\")\n    print(f\"{sequence[4]} = 2 * {sequence[3]} + {k3}\")\n    \n    k_sequence = [k1, k2, k3]\n    print(f\"\\nStep 2: Find the pattern in the remainders {k_sequence}.\")\n    # The pattern for the k_sequence is k_new = 3 * k_old + 2\n    print(f\"We observe that {k_sequence[1]} = 3 * {k_sequence[0]} + 2\")\n    print(f\"And {k_sequence[2]} = 3 * {k_sequence[1]} + 2\")\n\n    # Step 3: Calculate the next remainder.\n    next_k = 3 * k_sequence[-1] + 2\n    print(f\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the next remainder in the series.\")\n    print(f\"The next remainder is 3 * {k_sequence[-1]} + 2 = {next_k}\")\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the next term in the main sequence.\n    last_term = sequence[-1]\n    next_term_in_sequence = 2 * last_term + next_k\n    print(f\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the final number in the sequence.\")\n    print(f\"The final equation is: 2 * {last_term} + {next_k} = {next_term_in_sequence}\")\n\nsolve_sequence()\n<<<A>>>\n```"
