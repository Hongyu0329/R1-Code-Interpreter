    "This task requires a step-by-step analysis of the Latin hexameter line, applying rules of vowel quantity, elision, and poetic license to determine the metrical pattern of dactyls and spondees.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Break the line into its six feet.** I will analyze the line from left to right, identifying each foot.\n2.  **Syllabify and determine vowel length:** I will apply standard rules:\n    *   A vowel is long by nature (e.g., in a diphthong like 'ae' or as indicated in a dictionary).\n    *   A vowel is long by position if followed by two or more consonants (including 'x' and 'z').\n    *   Otherwise, a vowel is typically short.\n3.  **Apply Elision:** A word ending in a vowel or '-m' will elide (be omitted in pronunciation) if the following word begins with a vowel or 'h'.\n4.  **Identify Poetic Licenses:** Virgil, like other poets, sometimes deviates from strict rules for metrical effect. I will identify and explain these cases, such as syncope (omitting a syllable) or irregular lengthening.\n5.  **Construct the final D/S pattern:** Based on the analysis, I will label each foot as a Dactyl (Long-Short-Short) or a Spondee (Long-Long). The fifth foot is expected to be a dactyl, and the sixth is a spondee.\n\nI will use a Python script to present this analysis clearly, explaining the scansion of each foot and then printing the final result.\n\n```python\ndef scan_hexameter_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and scans the Latin hexameter line:\n    \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"verum ubi equi atque hominis casu convenit imago.\"\n    print(f\"Scanning Latin Hexameter Line: \\\"{line}\\\"\\n\")\n\n    feet = {\n        1: {\n            \"text\": \"verum ubi\",\n            \"scan\": \"D\",\n            \"explanation\": [\n                \"The '-um' of 'verum' elides with the starting 'u' of 'ubi'.\",\n                \"The first syllable 'vē-' is long by nature.\",\n                \"The second syllable, 'u' from 'ubi', is short.\",\n                \"The third syllable, '-bi', is short because its vowel 'i' comes before the vowel 'e' of the next word, 'equi'.\",\n                \"Result: Long-Short-Short -> Dactyl (D).\"\n            ]\n        },\n        2: {\n            \"text\": \"equi atque\",\n            \"scan\": \"S\",\n            \"explanation\": [\n                \"The '-i' of 'equi' elides with the 'a' of 'atque'.\",\n                \"The first syllable 'e-' of 'equi', though naturally short, is treated as long by poetic license to fit the meter.\",\n                \"The second syllable 'at-' (from 'atque') is long by position, as the 'a' is followed by two consonants ('t' and 'qu').\",\n                \"Result: Long-Long -> Spondee (S).\"\n            ]\n        },\n        3: {\n            \"text\": \"hominis\",\n            \"scan\": \"S\",\n            \"explanation\": [\n                \"This foot involves two poetic licenses after the '-que' of 'atque' elides with the 'h' of 'hominis'.\",\n                \"First, the word 'hominis' undergoes syncope, scanning as two syllables ('hom-nis') instead of three.\",\n                \"The first syllable 'hom-' becomes long by position (short 'o' followed by 'm' and 'n').\",\n                \"The second syllable '-nis' is long by position, as the 'i' is followed by 's' and the 'c' of the next word, 'casu'.\",\n                \"Result: Long-Long -> Spondee (S).\"\n            ]\n        },\n        4: {\n            \"text\": \"casu\",\n            \"scan\": \"S\",\n            \"explanation\": [\n                \"The first syllable 'cā-' is long by nature.\",\n                \"The second syllable '-sū' is also long by nature.\",\n                \"Result: Long-Long -> Spondee (S).\"\n            ]\n        },\n        5: {\n            \"text\": \"convenit\",\n            \"scan\": \"D\",\n            \"explanation\": [\n                \"The first syllable 'con-' is long by position ('o' followed by 'n' and 'v').\",\n                \"The second syllable '-ve-' is short.\",\n                \"The third syllable '-nit' is short.\",\n                \"Result: Long-Short-Short -> Dactyl (D).\"\n            ]\n        },\n        6: {\n            \"text\": \"imago\",\n            \"scan\": \"S\",\n            \"explanation\": [\n                \"The first syllable 'i-' is short.\",\n                \"The second syllable '-mā-' is long by nature.\",\n                \"The final syllable '-gō' is anceps (can be long or short), and always counts as long to complete the hexameter.\",\n                \"The foot scans as a spondee for metrical purposes.\",\n                \"Result: (Short)-Long-Long -> Spondee (S).\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n\n    final_scansion = []\n    for i in range(1, 7):\n        foot_data = feet[i]\n        final_scansion.append(foot_data[\"scan\"])\n        print(f\"Foot {i} (\\\"{foot_data['text']}\\\"): {foot_data['scan']}\")\n        for line in foot_data['explanation']:\n            print(f\"  - {line}\")\n        print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # The final \"equation\" is the sequence of D and S\n    final_output = \" \".join(final_scansion)\n    print(\"\\nFinal Scansion Pattern:\")\n    print(final_output)\n\nscan_hexameter_line()\n<<<D S S S D S>>>\n```"
