    "My plan is to determine which word from the provided list is not used in a rhyming position in Chaucer's \"Book of the Duchess\". A word must be at the end of a line to be part of a rhyme. Therefore, the most straightforward approach is to find the word from the list that never appears at the end of a line in the poem.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  Download the complete text of \"The Book of the Duchess\" from the Project Gutenberg public library.\n2.  Isolate the poem's content, removing the header and footer information added by Project Gutenberg.\n3.  Process the poem line by line. For each line, I will extract the last word.\n4.  Each extracted last word will be \"cleaned\" by converting it to lowercase and removing any trailing punctuation. This creates a comprehensive set of all words used in rhyming positions.\n5.  I will then check each word from the answer choices (`Wente`, `Here`, `Fool`, `Hool`, `Countour`) against this set of end-words.\n6.  The word that is not found in the set of end-words is the one that Chaucer did not use to make a rhyme, and that will be the answer.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport re\n\ndef find_unrhymed_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds which word from a list Chaucer does not rhyme in \"Book of the Duchess\"\n    by checking which words appear at the end of a line.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
