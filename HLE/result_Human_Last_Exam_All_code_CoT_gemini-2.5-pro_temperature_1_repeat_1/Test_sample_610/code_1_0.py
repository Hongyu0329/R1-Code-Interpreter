    Calculates the value of the function l(n, b) based on its definition.

    The problem asks for the exact value of l(n,b). A detailed analytical
    derivation shows that the value of l(n,b) is not a constant but depends on
    the parameters n and b. The final derived formula is:
    l(n, b) = 2 * (3 - 5*b - n*b + 2*b^2) / (1 - b^2)

    This code implements the derived formula for user-specified values of n and b
    that satisfy the given constraints (n >= 10, b in (0,1)).
