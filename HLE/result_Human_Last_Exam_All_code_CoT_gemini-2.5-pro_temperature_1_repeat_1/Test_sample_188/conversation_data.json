  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The main goal is to find the maximum possible length of a secret message.\n2.  **Analyze the Source of Encryption:** The problem states that the \"Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols.\" The Ching contains 9999 symbols. This is the medium carrying the message.\n3.  **Analyze the Message Alphabet:** The message is \"written using the letters in the Shu,\" and the Shu uses a set of 120 unique characters. This set of 120 characters is the alphabet for the secret message.\n4.  **Determine the Encoding Method for Maximum Length:** To achieve the maximum possible message length, we should use the most efficient encoding scheme. The most direct and length-maximizing method is a simple substitution where each symbol from the Ching represents exactly one character of the secret message.\n5.  **Filter Irrelevant Information:** The problem includes several numbers that are not relevant to the calculation of the message length. These include:\n    *   The total number of characters in the Shu (around 3000).\n    *   The time to recognize a character (12 ms).\n    *   The computation time for operations (10 ns and 30 ns).\n    These details relate to the processing and discovery of the message, not its intrinsic maximum length.\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Since there are 9999 symbols in the Ching and each symbol can encode one character, the maximum length of the message is 9999 characters.\n\nI will now write a Python script to formalize this calculation.\n\n```python\n# This script calculates the maximum length of a secret message based on the problem description.\n\n# Number of symbols available in the Ching book for encoding.\nnum_ching_symbols = 9999\n\n# Number of unique characters in the Shu book, which form the alphabet for the message.\n# This information confirms we have a set of characters to encode, but it doesn't limit the message length.\nnum_shu_alphabet = 120\n\n# To find the maximum possible length of the message, we assume the most efficient encoding:\n# one symbol from the Ching encodes one character of the message.\n# Therefore, the maximum length of the message is limited by the total number of symbols available.\nmax_message_length = num_ching_symbols\n\nprint(\"The problem is about encoding capacity. The maximum length of a message is limited by the number of symbols available to encode it.\")\nprint(f\"The Ching book contains {num_ching_symbols} symbols.\")\nprint(\"Assuming each symbol encodes one character, the maximum length of the message is equal to the number of symbols.\")\nprint(\"\\nThe final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"Maximum Message Length = {max_message_length}\")\n\n```\n<<<9999>>>"
