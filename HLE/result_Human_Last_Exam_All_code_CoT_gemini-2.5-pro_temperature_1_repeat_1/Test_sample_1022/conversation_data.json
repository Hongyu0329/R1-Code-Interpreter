    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the groups and their properties:** The group is $G = T \\times T$, a direct product of Thompson's group $T$ with itself. A crucial property of Thompson's group $T$ is that it is a non-amenable group.\n\n2.  **Apply the Künneth Formula for Bounded Cohomology:** For direct products of non-amenable groups, a version of the Künneth formula holds for bounded cohomology. For two such groups, $G_1$ and $G_2$, the following isomorphism holds for $n \\ge 2$:\n    $H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) \\cong \\bigoplus_{p+q=n} H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\otimes H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})$\n    This allows us to compute the dimension of the cohomology group of the product by summing the products of the dimensions of the cohomology groups of the factors:\n    $\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})$\n    In our case, $G_1 = G_2 = T$ and we are interested in degree $n=4$.\n\n3.  **Use the known dimensions of the bounded cohomology of T:** The dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group $T$ with trivial real coefficients are well-established results in the field:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ (since $T$ is an infinite group).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ (this holds for any group).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$.\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 4$.\n\n4.  **Perform the calculation:** We need to compute the sum for $n=4$:\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R})$\n    The pairs $(p, q)$ that sum to 4 are (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0). We will calculate the product of dimensions for each pair and sum them up.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation step-by-step.\n\n```python\ndef compute_bounded_cohomology_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of T x T.\n    \n    This function uses the Künneth formula for bounded cohomology and known results\n    for the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Known dimensions of the bounded cohomology of Thompson's group T: dim H_b^n(T, R)\n    # Stored in a dictionary where the key is the degree n.\n    dim_Hb_T = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 0,\n        2: 1,\n        3: 1,\n        4: 0,\n    }\n\n    # The degree of the cohomology group to compute.\n    n = 4\n\n    print(f\"We compute dim H_b^{n}(T x T, R) using the Künneth formula:\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^{n}(T x T) = Σ_{{p+q={n}}} (dim H_b^p(T) * dim H_b^q(T))\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    total_dimension = 0\n    numeric_terms = []\n\n    # Iterate through all partitions of n into two non-negative integers p and q.\n    for p in range(n + 1):\n        q = n - p\n        \n        # Get dimensions for H_b^p(T) and H_b^q(T).\n        # Degrees higher than 4 have dimension 0.\n        dim_p = dim_Hb_T.get(p, 0)\n        dim_q = dim_Hb_T.get(q, 0)\n        \n        term = dim_p * dim_q\n        total_dimension += term\n        \n        # Store the numeric term for the final equation.\n        numeric_terms.append(f\"{dim_p}*{dim_q}\")\n\n    # Print the breakdown of the sum\n    print(\"The terms of the sum correspond to (p, q) pairs summing to 4:\")\n    print(f\"p=0, q=4: term = dim H_b^0(T) * dim H_b^4(T) = {dim_Hb_T.get(0,0)} * {dim_Hb_T.get(4,0)} = {dim_Hb_T.get(0,0) * dim_Hb_T.get(4,0)}\")\n    print(f\"p=1, q=3: term = dim H_b^1(T) * dim H_b^3(T) = {dim_Hb_T.get(1,0)} * {dim_Hb_T.get(3,0)} = {dim_Hb_T.get(1,0) * dim_Hb_T.get(3,0)}\")\n    print(f\"p=2, q=2: term = dim H_b^2(T) * dim H_b^2(T) = {dim_Hb_T.get(2,0)} * {dim_Hb_T.get(2,0)} = {dim_Hb_T.get(2,0) * dim_Hb_T.get(2,0)}\")\n    print(f\"p=3, q=1: term = dim H_b^3(T) * dim H_b^1(T) = {dim_Hb_T.get(3,0)} * {dim_Hb_T.get(1,0)} = {dim_Hb_T.get(3,0) * dim_Hb_T.get(1,0)}\")\n    print(f\"p=4, q=0: term = dim H_b^4(T) * dim H_b^0(T) = {dim_Hb_T.get(4,0)} * {dim_Hb_T.get(0,0)} = {dim_Hb_T.get(4,0) * dim_Hb_T.get(0,0)}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Print the full equation with all the numbers.\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(numeric_terms)\n    print(\"The full calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^{n}(T x T) = {equation_str}\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^{n}(T x T) = {total_dimension}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    \n    print(f\"The dimension of the degree {n} bounded cohomology group of T x T is {total_dimension}.\")\n\ncompute_bounded_cohomology_dimension()\n```\n<<<1>>>"
