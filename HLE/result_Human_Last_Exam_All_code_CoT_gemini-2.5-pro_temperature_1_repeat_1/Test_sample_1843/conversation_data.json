    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan and find the answer.\n\n### Plan to Solve the Problem\n\n1.  **Decomposition**: The number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor $N$ can be determined by analyzing the prime factorization of $N$. We will start by factoring $N = 36036$.\n2.  **Character Structure**: A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N = p_1^{k_1} \\cdots p_r^{k_r}$ is primitive if and only if it can be uniquely decomposed into a product of primitive characters $\\chi_i$ modulo each prime power factor $p_i^{k_i}$. That is, $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where $\\chi_i$ is a primitive character modulo $p_i^{k_i}$.\n3.  **Order Condition**: The order of the character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We require this lcm to be 6.\n4.  **Counting Component Characters**: For the lcm to be 6, the order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6. For each prime power factor $p_i^{k_i}$ of $N$, we will:\n    a. Determine the group structure of $(\\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\\mathbb{Z})^\\times$.\n    b. Identify the possible orders for its primitive characters.\n    c. Count how many of these primitive characters have an order that divides 6. Let this count be $c_i$.\n5.  **Verification and Final Calculation**: We will verify that any combination of such characters results in a character of order exactly 6. The total number of characters is the product of the counts from each prime power factor: $C = c_1 \\times c_2 \\times \\cdots \\times c_r$. The final calculation will be presented, showing each number in the product.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return int(result)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a sorted list of divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef get_prime_power(n):\n    \"\"\"Finds p, k for n=p^k.\"\"\"\n    if n == 4: return 2, 2\n    temp_n = n\n    p = 2\n    if temp_n % p == 0:\n        k = 0\n        while temp_n % p == 0:\n            temp_n //= p\n            k += 1\n        if temp_n == 1: return p, k\n    p = 3\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            k = 0\n            temp_n = n\n            while temp_n % p == 0:\n                temp_n //= p\n                k += 1\n            if temp_n == 1: return p, k\n        p += 2\n    return n, 1 # n is prime\n\ndef get_primitive_character_orders(modulus):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary mapping order to the count of primitive characters\n    for a given prime power modulus.\n    \"\"\"\n    if modulus == 1:\n        return {}\n    if modulus == 4:\n        # The character group mod 4 is Z_2.
