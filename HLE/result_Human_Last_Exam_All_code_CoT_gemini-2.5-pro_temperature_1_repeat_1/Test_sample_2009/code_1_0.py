# Given lengths on the transversal line DGHI
DG = 3
GH = 5
HI = 1

# There's a theorem for this specific geometric configuration which states:
# AE^2 = GH^2 + DG * HI
# Let's calculate AE^2 using this theorem.
AE_squared = GH**2 + DG * HI

# Calculate AE
AE = math.sqrt(AE_squared)

# The length of AE is sqrt(28), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(7).
# We need to express this in the form a*sqrt(b)/c.
# We can write 2*sqrt(7) as 2*sqrt(7)/1.
a = 2
b = 7
c = 1

# The problem asks for the value of a + b + c.
result = a + b + c

# The final output should contain the equation to show the calculation
