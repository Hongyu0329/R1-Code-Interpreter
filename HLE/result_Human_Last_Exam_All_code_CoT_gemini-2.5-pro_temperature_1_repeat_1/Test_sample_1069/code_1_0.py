# This script calculates the value of x(t) for t = ln(10^20)
# based on the derived particular solution x(t) = (2 - exp(-t)) / cosh(t).

# Define the value of t
t = math.log(10**20)

# Calculate the components of the solution formula
# Note: For large t, exp(-t) is very small and cosh(t) is very large.
# Standard floating-point arithmetic will have limitations.
# exp(-t) = exp(-ln(10^20)) = 10^-20
exp_neg_t = math.exp(-t)
# cosh(t) = cosh(ln(10^20)) = (10^20 + 10^-20) / 2
cosh_t = math.cosh(t)

# Calculate the numerator of the solution.
# In standard float precision, 2.0 - 1e-20 is just 2.0
numerator = 2.0 - exp_neg_t

# Calculate the final result
result = numerator / cosh_t

# Print the final equation with the numbers substituted, as requested.
# The equation is x(ln(10^20)) = (2 - exp(-ln(10^20))) / cosh(ln(10^20))
print("The final equation with the calculated numerical values is:")
