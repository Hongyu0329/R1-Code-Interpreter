    print("   The anti-Stokes signal frequency (ω_as) is generated based on the pump (ω_p), Stokes (ω_s), and probe (ω_pr) frequencies.")

    print("\n3. Applying the Scenario (Broadband Pump):")
    print("   - The pump beam (ω_p) is broadband, meaning it contains a wide range of frequencies.")
    print("   - The Stokes beam (ω_s) is narrowband (a single frequency).")
    print("   - For simplicity, we assume the probe beam is the same as the pump beam (ω_pr = ω_p).")

    simplified_omega_as1 = "2*Ω_1 + ω_s"
    print(f"     This generates a unique anti-Stokes signal at frequency ω_as1 = 2*ω_p1 - ω_s = {omega_as1}, which simplifies to {simplified_omega_as1}.")
    
    # Analysis for the second vibrational mode
    print("\n   - For Mode 2 (Ω_2):")
    omega_p2 = "ω_s + Ω_2"
    print(f"     A different frequency component, ω_p2, where ω_p2 = {omega_p2}, will excite this mode.")
    omega_as2 = "2 * (ω_s + Ω_2) - ω_s"
    simplified_omega_as2 = "2*Ω_2 + ω_s"
    print(f"     This generates another unique anti-Stokes signal at ω_as2 = 2*ω_p2 - ω_s = {omega_as2}, which simplifies to {simplified_omega_as2}.")
    
    print("\n5. Conclusion:")
    print("   Since each molecular vibration (Ω_1, Ω_2, ...) is encoded into a separate, distinct frequency (ω_as1, ω_as2, ...) in the anti-Stokes signal, the resulting broadband signal contains a full spectrum of distinguishable information.")
    print("   This directly corresponds to answer choice C.")
