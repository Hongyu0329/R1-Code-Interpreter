    "This is a question from the field of arithmetic geometry, a branch of mathematics. The number of stable reduction types for curves of genus 2 is a known result from the research literature, not a number that can be computed from scratch with a simple script. The answer is nuanced and depends on the precise definition of \"type\" and the characteristic of the underlying field.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will explain the distinction between **semistable reduction** and the more general **stable reduction**.\n2.  I will provide the number of types for the simpler semistable case, which is a classic result.\n3.  Then, I will provide the more complex answer for stable reduction, which depends on the characteristic `p` of the residue field, based on the definitive classification by the mathematician Takeshi Saito.\n4.  The Python code will then print these numbers in a clear format, addressing the different cases.\n5.  Finally, I will give the number for the \"generic\" case (`p > 5`) as the final answer, as it is the most comprehensive.\n\n```python\ndef get_stable_reduction_types():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the number of different types of stable reduction for curves of genus 2.\n    This is a known result from algebraic geometry and depends on the field's characteristic.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of combinatorial types for the simpler case of *semistable* reduction is a constant.\n    semistable_types = 13\n\n    # For the more general *stable* reduction, the number of types depends on the\n    # characteristic 'p' of the residue field, based on a classification by T.
