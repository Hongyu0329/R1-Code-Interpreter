    # Step 1: Identify the cost function for transformation.
    # The cost to transform S1 to S2 is min(n1(S1) + n1(S2), n0(S1) + n0(S2)),
    # where n1(S) is the number of '1'-blocks and n0(S) is the number of '0'-blocks in sequence S.

    # Step 2: To find the worst-case 'n', we must maximize this cost function.
    # This requires maximizing the number of blocks in the source (S1) and target (S2) sequences.

    # Step 3: Determine the maximum number of blocks in a 100-digit sequence.
    # A 100-digit sequence has the maximum number of blocks when the digits alternate,
    # e.g., "0101...01". This sequence has 50 blocks of '0's and 50 blocks of '1's.
    # Therefore, the maximum possible value for n0(S) or n1(S) is 50.

    # Cost via an all-'1's intermediate sequence

    # The actual number of operations n is the minimum of these two path costs.
    n = min(cost_via_zeros, cost_via_ones)
