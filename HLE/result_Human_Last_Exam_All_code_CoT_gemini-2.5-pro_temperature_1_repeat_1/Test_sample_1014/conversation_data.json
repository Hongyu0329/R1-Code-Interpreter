    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal**: The objective is to find the largest prime number that divides 8139881.\n2.  **Strategy: Trial Division**: I will use the trial division method, a common algorithm for integer factorization.\n3.  **Algorithm Steps**:\n    *   I'll start with the number `n = 8139881`.\n    *   First, I will handle the smallest prime, 2. I'll repeatedly divide `n` by 2 until it's odd and record 2 as a factor each time.\n    *   Next, I'll iterate through the odd numbers (`i = 3, 5, 7, ...`) up to the square root of the current `n`.\n    *   If `i` divides `n`, it's a prime factor. I will add `i` to my list of factors and update `n` by dividing it by `i`. I'll repeat this division until `n` is no longer divisible by `i`.\n    *   After the loop, if the remaining value of `n` is greater than 1, this remaining number must also be a prime factor.\n    *   Finally, from the list of all prime factors found, I will identify and print the largest one. The code will also display the full prime factorization equation.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the prime factors of a given number and prints the factorization\n    and the largest prime divisor.\n    \"\"\"\n    original_num = num\n    factors = []\n\n    # Handle division by 2\n    while num % 2 == 0:\n        factors.append(2)\n        num = num // 2\n\n    # Handle division by odd numbers from 3 upwards\n    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):\n        while num % i == 0:\n            factors.append(i)\n            num = num // i\n\n    # If the remaining number is a prime greater than 2\n    if num > 2:\n        factors.append(num)\n\n    if not factors:\n        # This case handles if the original number is prime\n        print(f\"{original_num} is a prime number.\")\n        largest_prime = original_num\n    else:\n        # Print the prime factorization equation\n        equation = f\"{original_num} = \" + \" * \".join(map(str, factors))\n        print(\"The prime factorization is:\")\n        print(equation)\n        largest_prime = max(factors)\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe largest prime divisor of {original_num} is: {largest_prime}\")\n    return largest_prime\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    number_to_factor = 8139881\n    largest_divisor = find_prime_factorization(number_to_factor)\n    # The final answer is wrapped separately as requested.\n    # The print statements above provide the detailed solution.\n```\n<<<6257>>>"
