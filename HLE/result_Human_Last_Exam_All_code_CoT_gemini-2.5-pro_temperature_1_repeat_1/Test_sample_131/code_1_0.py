    choices = {
        "A": "The more knowledge you have, the more knowledge gaps occur, and the stronger is the self-stabilizing effect.",
        "B": "In the early learning phase, many knowledge gaps occur because students knowledge is fragmented and lot is unknown. Thus, the self-stabilizing effect is strongest.",
        "C": "The self-stabilizing effect peaks in the late learning phase, where a learnerâ€™s foundational understanding allows them to discover more knowledge gaps.",
        "D": "none",
        "E": "The self-stabilizing effect remains constant throughout all learning phases, as the number of knowledge gaps is constant for every gained knowledge."

    print("Step 2: Evaluating Choice E.")
