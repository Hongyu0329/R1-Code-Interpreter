    "To determine the number of let-7 family members identified in humans, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the core members:** Based on established biological databases like miRBase, I will identify the commonly recognized members of the human let-7 microRNA family.\n2.  **Store the members:** I will create a Python list to store the names of these identified members. The members are let-7a, let-7b, let-7c, let-7d, let-7e, let-7f, let-7g, let-7i, and miR-98.\n3.  **Count and display:** The Python script will then calculate the total number of items in the list (which is the count of the family members).\n4.  **Format the output:** The script will print an explanatory text, the total count, and a simple equation to show how the final count was reached, as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_human_let7_members():\n  \"\"\"\n  This function provides the count of human let-7 family members.\n  The let-7 family is a group of microRNAs that are highly conserved across species.\n  The members are identified based on sequence homology, particularly in the seed region.\n  The list below is based on data from primary microRNA databases like miRBase.\n  \"\"\"\n  # List of recognized members of the human let-7 family\n  let7_family_members = [\n      \"let-7a\",\n      \"let-7b\",\n      \"let-7c\",\n      \"let-7d\",\n      \"let-7e\",\n      \"let-7f\",\n      \"let-7g\",\n      \"let-7i\",\n      \"miR-98\" # miR-98 is considered a member of the let-7 family\n  ]\n\n  # Calculate the total number of members\n  num_members = len(let7_family_members)\n\n  # Print the detailed information\n  print(f\"To date, {num_members} members of the let-7 family have been identified in humans.\")\n  print(\"They are:\")\n  for member in let7_family_members:\n      print(f\"- {member}\")\n\n  # Create and print the equation as requested\n  # Each '1' represents one identified member of the family.\n  equation_parts = [\"1\"] * num_members\n  equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n  print(\"\\nThe final count is derived from summing each member:\")\n  print(f\"{equation_str} = {num_members}\")\n\n# Execute the function\nget_human_let7_members()\n```\n<<<9>>>"
