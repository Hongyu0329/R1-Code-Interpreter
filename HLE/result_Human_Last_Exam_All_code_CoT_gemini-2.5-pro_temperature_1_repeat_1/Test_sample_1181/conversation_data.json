    "My plan is to determine the correct character from the 1972 film *Solaris* who expresses shame for missing the sound of rustling leaves. This sentiment is central to the theme of homesickness and the protagonist's connection to Earth. I will identify this character from my knowledge of the film's plot and themes. After identifying the correct character, I will write a Python script that defines the answer choices, selects the correct one, and prints the character's name along with the corresponding answer letter.\n\n```python\ndef solve_solaris_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the correct answer to the question\n    about Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 film, Solaris.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The question is: Which character is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth?\n    \n    # Answer Choices provided:\n    # A.
