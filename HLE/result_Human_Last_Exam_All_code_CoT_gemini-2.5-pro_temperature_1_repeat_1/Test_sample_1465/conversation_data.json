    "Here is my plan to solve this bioinformatics problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Sequences**: Each of the five provided sequences is 28 amino acids long, corresponding to exactly four heptad repeats (`abcdefg`), which is the characteristic pattern of a coiled-coil protein.\n2.  **Identify the Core Positions**: The oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the identity of the amino acids at the hydrophobic core positions, which are the 'a' and 'd' positions of the heptad repeat.\n3.  **Determine the Heptad Register**: I will assume the most common `gabcdef` register, where the first residue ('E' in all cases) is at the solvent-exposed 'g' position. This places the second residue at position 'a' and the fifth residue at position 'd'.\n4.  **Extract Core Residues**: For each of the five sequences, I will extract the list of amino acids found at the 'a' positions and 'd' positions across the four heptad repeats.\n5.  **Apply Prediction Rules**: I will apply a set of well-established rules from structural biology to predict the oligomeric state based on the combination of residues at the 'a' and 'd' core positions:\n    *   **Asn ('N') or Gln ('Q') in the core**: A polar residue like Asparagine or Glutamine within the hydrophobic core is a powerful determinant for a **dimer (2)**, as it can form a hydrogen bond across the dimer interface.\n    *   **'a=I, d=I'**: An Isoleucine at both the 'a' and 'd' positions strongly favors a **tetramer (4)**.\n    *   **'a=I, d=T'**: An Isoleucine at 'a' and a Threonine at 'd' (a \"Threonine zipper\") is a known motif that forms a **trimer (3)**.\n    *   **Ambiguous/Mixed Cores**: For the remaining sequence, I'll analyze the specific combination of core residues to determine the most likely state. Based on the pattern, it appears to be a case where a typically trimeric motif is destabilized into a dimeric state.\n6.  **Construct the Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this logic. The script will loop through each sequence, determine its core residues, apply the rules to predict the oligomeric state, and print the sequence, the reasoning, and the final predicted number. This will produce the final sequence of numbers corresponding to one of the answer choices.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef predict_coiled_coil_state(sequences):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences based on core residues.\n    \"\"\"\n    final_predictions = []\n    print(\"Analyzing Coiled-Coil Sequences...\\n\")\n\n    for i, seq in enumerate(sequences):\n        # Step 1: Extract core 'a' and 'd' residues assuming a 'gabcdef' register\n        a_residues = []\n        d_residues = []\n        for j in range(4):  # There are 4 heptads in each 28-residue sequence\n            heptad = seq[j*7 : (j+1)*7]\n            # 'gabcdef' -> indices 0123456\n            a_residues.append(heptad[1]) # 'a' is at index 1\n            d_residues.append(heptad[4]) # 'd' is at index 4\n\n        a_counts = collections.Counter(a_residues)\n        d_counts = collections.Counter(d_residues)\n\n        state = 0\n        reason = \"\"\n\n        # Step 2: Apply prediction rules\n        # Rule for tetramer (a=I, d=I) -> Sequence 3\n        if all(r == 'I' for r in a_residues) and all(r == 'I' for r in d_residues):\n            state = 4\n            reason = \"The core is composed entirely of Isoleucine at both 'a' and 'd' positions (I-I zipper), a canonical motif for a TETRAMER.\"\n        # Rule for dimer (polar Asn 'N' at 'a') -> Sequence 2\n        elif 'N' in a_residues:\n            state = 2\n            reason = \"The presence of a polar Asn ('N') residue at an 'a' core position is a strong determinant for a DIMER, overriding the I-L (trimer) preference.\"\n        # Rule for dimer (polar Gln 'Q' at 'd') -> Sequence 4\n        elif 'Q' in d_residues:\n            state = 2\n            reason = \"The presence of polar Gln ('Q') residues at the 'd' core position is a strong determinant for a DIMER.\"\n        # Rule for trimer (a=I, d=T) -> Sequence 5\n        elif all(r == 'I' for r in a_residues) and all(r == 'T' for r in d_residues):\n            state = 3\n            reason = \"The core is composed of Isoleucine at 'a' and Threonine at 'd' (I-T zipper), a well-characterized motif for a TRIMER.\"\n        # Rule for dimer (destabilized I-A core) -> Sequence 1\n        elif all(r == 'I' for r in a_residues) and all(r == 'A' for r in d_residues):\n            state = 2\n            reason = \"The core has Isoleucine at 'a' and Alanine at 'd' (I-A zipper).
