A. Is every boopable function Turing-computable?

Yes. A function is Turing-computable if it can be computed by a Turing machine, which is a model of computation characterized by a finite set of rules and access to an infinite tape (unbounded memory).

The provided machine model, for any fixed set of parameters (R, A, W), is a finite automaton because its total number of states (defined by the program counter, all registers, and all memory words) is finite. However, the definition of a "boopable" function `f` is crucial here. It requires that a single program `L` can compute `f(x)` for any input `x`, given that we can choose machine parameters `R, A, W` that are "large enough" (greater than some `N_x`) for that specific input `x`.

This ability to use an arbitrarily large machine for any given computation is equivalent to having the unbounded memory of a Turing machine's tape. The instruction set itself, with `ADD`, `BITWISENAND` (which can be used to create all other logic gates), `LOAD`, `STORE`, and `BRANCHIFZERO`, is powerful enough to perform universal computation. Therefore, this model can simulate a Turing machine. Since a boopable function is one that can be computed by this model, every boopable function is, by definition, Turing-computable.

B. Suppose (R,A,W)=(64,64,512). Does there exist a program L of length <= 2^32+50 such that, for all x in [0, 2^32), L on (R,A,W) maps x to x and halts in <= x+50 many steps?

No. Such a program cannot exist. The combination of the tight time constraint and the limitations of the instruction set makes this impossible. Here is a proof by contradiction:

1.  **Premise**: Let's assume such a program `L` exists.

2.  **Time Constraint Implication**: The program must execute `x` `BOOP` instructions and halt, all within `x + 50` total steps. Each `BOOP` instruction takes one step. This leaves a "budget" of at most 50 steps for all non-`BOOP` instructions (setup, control flow, and the final `HALT`). A standard loop for counting would take multiple instructions per iteration (e.g., `BOOP`, `DECREMENT`, `BRANCH`), making its total time complexity `O(x)`, but with a constant factor greater than 1 (e.g., `3x`), which violates the `x + 50` limit for all but very small `x`.

3.  **Required Program Structure**: The only way to meet the time constraint is for the program to execute a brief setup routine (taking at most 49 steps) and then enter a straight-line sequence of `x` `BOOP` instructions, followed immediately by a `HALT` instruction.

4.  **The Contradiction**: This structure requires that for any given input `x`, a `HALT` instruction must be present at a specific memory address that depends on `x`. The only way to place a `HALT` instruction in memory at runtime is with the `STORE adr <- reg` instruction. However, the target address `adr` for `STORE` is an immediate value that is hardcoded into the instruction. The architecture does not have indirect addressing; it cannot store a value to a memory location whose address was computed and is held in a register.

5.  The setup code, being at most 49 instructions long, can contain at most 49 `STORE` instructions. This means it can only modify a fixed set, `D`, of at most 49 memory locations.

6.  For the program to work as required, for each of the `2^32` possible values of `x`, the computed location for the `HALT` instruction must be one of the locations in `D`. Let the location of the `HALT` for input `x` be `f(x)`. The set of all required HALT locations, `{f(x) | x in [0, 2^32)}`, must be a subset of `D`.

7.  The function `f(x)` would be approximately `C + x`, where `C` is the starting address of the `BOOP` sequence. This function `f(x)` generates approximately `2^32` distinct addresses for the `2^32` different values of `x`.

8.  This leads to a fundamental contradiction: a set of roughly `2^32` distinct memory addresses must be contained within a set `D` of at most 49 modifiable addresses. This is impossible since `2^32` is vastly larger than 49.

Therefore, the initial premise is false, and no such program `L` can exist.
