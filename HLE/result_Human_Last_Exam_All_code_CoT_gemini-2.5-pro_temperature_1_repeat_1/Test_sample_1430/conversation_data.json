    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the range of the Picard number (the rank of the Néron-Severi group) for the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 curve. Here is the plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the relevant mathematical objects**: We are given a genus $g=3$ curve $C$ and the variety $X = C^{(15)}$, its 15th symmetric power. We need to find the rank of the Néron-Severi group of $X$, denoted as $\\rho(X)$.\n\n2.  **Use the standard formula**: For a smooth projective curve $C$ of genus $g$ and its $d$-th symmetric power $C^{(d)}$, there is a well-known formula that relates its Picard number to that of the Jacobian of the curve, $J(C)$. The formula is:\n    $\\rho(C^{(d)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$\n    This formula is valid when the degree $d$ is sufficiently large, specifically when $d \\ge 2g-1$.\n\n3.  **Verify the condition**: In our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition is $15 \\ge 2(3) - 1$, which simplifies to $15 \\ge 5$. The condition holds, so we can use the formula.\n\n4.  **Find the range for $\\rho(J(C))$**: The problem is now reduced to finding the minimum and maximum possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$, where $C$ is a genus 3 curve. $J(C)$ is a 3-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety.\n    *   **Minimum Rank**: For a *generic* curve $C$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ has no complex multiplication. Its endomorphism ring is just the integers, and its Néron-Severi group is generated by the principal polarization. Thus, the minimum possible rank is $\\rho_{min}(J(C)) = 1$.\n    *   **Maximum Rank**: The rank of the Néron-Severi group of a $g$-dimensional abelian variety is bounded by $g^2$. For $g=3$, the maximum possible rank is $3^2=9$. This maximum is achieved for specific curves whose Jacobians have maximal complex multiplication. An example of such a curve is the Fermat quartic curve ($x^4 + y^4 = z^4$), whose Jacobian is isogenous to the product of three copies of a CM elliptic curve. Thus, the maximum possible rank is $\\rho_{max}(J(C)) = 9$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final answer**: Using the formula from step 2 and the range from step 4, we can calculate the smallest and largest ranks for $X = C^{(15)}$.\n    *   Smallest rank: $\\rho_{min}(X) = \\rho_{min}(J(C)) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    *   Largest rank: $\\rho_{max}(X) = \\rho_{max}(J(C)) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_neron_severi_rank():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest and largest possible rank of the Neron-Severi group\n    of the 15th symmetric power of a genus 3 Riemann surface.\n    \"\"\"\n    g = 3  # Genus of the curve C\n    d = 15 # Degree of the symmetric power X = C^(15)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Problem Setup\")\n    print(f\"Let C be a curve of genus g = {g}.\")\n    print(f\"Let X be the {d}th symmetric power of C, denoted C^({d}).\")\n    print(\"We want to find the range of the rank of the Neron-Severi group of X, rho(X).\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: The Key Formula\")\n    print(\"The rank of the Neron-Severi group of the d-th symmetric power, rho(C^(d)), is related\")\n    print(\"to the rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of C, rho(J(C)).\")\n    print(\"The formula is: rho(C^(d)) = rho(J(C)) + 1.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Condition for the Formula\")\n    condition = 2 * g - 1\n    print(f\"This formula is valid if d >= 2*g - 1.\")\n    print(f\"In our case, g = {g} and d = {d}.
