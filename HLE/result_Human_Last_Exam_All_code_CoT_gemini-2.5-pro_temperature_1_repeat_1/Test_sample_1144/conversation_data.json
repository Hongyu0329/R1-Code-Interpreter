    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to determine the ratio of the uncertainty in an electron's momentum (Δp) to its actual momentum (p) while it is in the first Bohr orbit. This can be expressed as the fraction Δp / p.\n2.  **Use Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:** This fundamental principle of quantum mechanics provides the relationship between the uncertainty in a particle's position (Δx) and the uncertainty in its momentum (Δp). We will use the minimum uncertainty limit, which is expressed by the formula:\n    `Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx)`\n    Here, ħ is the reduced Planck constant (approximately 1.054 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s), and Δx is the given uncertainty in position (10 pm or 10 x 10⁻¹² m).\n3.  **Use the Bohr Model for Momentum:** The Bohr model quantizes the angular momentum of an electron. From this, we can derive the linear momentum (p) of an electron in the first orbit (n=1) as:\n    `p = ħ / r₁`\n    Here, r₁ is the radius of the first Bohr orbit, also known as the Bohr radius (a₀), which is approximately 5.29 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n4.  **Formulate and Simplify the Ratio:** We can now set up the ratio Δp / p using the expressions from the previous steps:\n    `Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)`\n    The reduced Planck constant (ħ) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This simplifies the equation significantly to:\n    `Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)`\n5.  **Calculate the Result:** By substituting the known values for the Bohr radius (r₁) and the uncertainty in position (Δx) into the simplified formula, we can calculate the final ratio. The Python code below will perform this calculation and display the final equation with the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the physical constants and given values\n# Bohr radius (radius of the first orbit), r1, in meters\nr1 = 5.29177e-11  # meters\n# Uncertainty in position, delta_x, in meters\ndelta_x_pm = 10  # picometers\ndelta_x_m = delta_x_pm * 1e-12  # convert pm to m\n\n# The ratio of momentum uncertainty to momentum is given by r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n# Let's calculate the components of the final equation\nnumerator = r1\ndenominator = 2 * delta_x_m\n\n# Calculate the final ratio\nratio = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers as requested\nprint(\"The ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum to the momentum is given by the formula:\")\nprint(\"Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {numerator:.3e} m / (2 * {delta_x_m:.3e} m)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {numerator:.3e} m / {denominator:.3e} m\")\nprint(f\"Final Ratio = {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
