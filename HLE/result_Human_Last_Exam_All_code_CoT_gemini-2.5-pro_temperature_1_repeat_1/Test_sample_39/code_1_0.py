    Analyzes the relationship between inaccessible and measurable cardinals to solve the problem.

    The problem asks for the status of statement P within system S.

    System S: ZFC + "There exists an inaccessible cardinal κ".
    Statement P: "There exists a nontrivial elementary embedding j: V -> M with critical point κ".

    This function will walk through the logical steps to arrive at the correct answer.
    """

    # Step 1: Interpret the statement P.
    # The existence of a nontrivial elementary embedding j: V -> M with critical point κ
    # is the definition of κ being a 'measurable cardinal'.
    # So, P is equivalent to the statement "κ is a measurable cardinal".
    statement_p_meaning = "κ is a measurable cardinal"

    # Step 2: Understand the system S.
    # The system S assumes the existence of an inaccessible cardinal κ.
    system_s_axiom = "κ is an inaccessible cardinal"

    # Step 3: Compare the consistency strength of the axioms.
    # In the hierarchy of large cardinals, 'measurable' is a much stronger property than 'inaccessible'.
    # Fact 1: If a cardinal is measurable, it is also inaccessible.
    #         This means that the theory "ZFC + ∃κ (κ is measurable)" implies the consistency of S.
    # Fact 2: The consistency of a stronger theory cannot be proven from a weaker theory (a consequence of Gödel's theorems).

    # Step 4: Evaluate the possibilities for P within S.

    # Can S prove P?
    # No. S (ZFC + inaccessible) cannot prove P (that the same cardinal is measurable).
    # This would mean an inaccessible cardinal implies a measurable cardinal, which is false.
    # The measurable cardinal axiom is strictly stronger.
    is_provable = False

    # Can S disprove P (i.e., prove ¬P)?
    # No. This would mean that a cardinal being inaccessible prevents it from being measurable.
    # This is false, because every measurable cardinal is inaccessible. A model of ZFC with a
    # measurable cardinal is also a model of S in which P is true.
    is_disprovable = False

    # Therefore, since P is neither provable nor disprovable in S, it is independent of S.
