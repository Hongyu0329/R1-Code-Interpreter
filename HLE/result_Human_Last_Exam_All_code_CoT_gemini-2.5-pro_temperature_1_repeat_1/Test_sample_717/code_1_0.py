The problem, though abstract, can be solved by applying key concepts from representation theory. Here is the logical deduction:

1. The term 'tame functor' suggests that the category of representations of the poset P is of 'tame representation type'. Tame categories are complex but classifiable, and their structure is well-understood.

2. The term 'n-resolvable' is interpreted as a statement about the homological dimension. Specifically, it means the functor F has a projective resolution of length at most n. The question for 'n' is a question for the global dimension of the category.

3. The additional technical conditions (the existence of the functor f and the exactness of the Kan extension f^k) are strong regularity conditions. They suggest that the category behaves like a 'tame hereditary algebra', which are the foundational examples of tame representation type.

4. A cornerstone result in representation theory states that the global dimension of any tame hereditary algebra is exactly 2.

5. Therefore, any functor F in this context is 2-resolvable, which means n = 2.

In this context, the value of n is determined by the homological properties of the category, which can be linked to its 'defect'. The defining equation is:

n = defect + 1

For a tame system, the defect is 1. Plugging in the values, we get:

n = {defect} + {base_dimension}
