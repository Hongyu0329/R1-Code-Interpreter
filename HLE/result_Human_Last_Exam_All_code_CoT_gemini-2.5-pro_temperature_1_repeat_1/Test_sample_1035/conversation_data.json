    "This problem asks for the minimum total number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs whose edges cover all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ for $n=35$. Let the family of bipartite graphs be $\\{G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k\\}$. We are looking to minimize the sum of the number of vertices, which is expressed as $\\sum_{i=1}^k |V(G_i)|$.\n\nThis is a known problem in extremal graph theory. The solution is given by a theorem which states that the minimum value for this sum is $n \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil$.\n\nMy plan to solve this is to apply this formula:\n1.  Identify the value of $n$, which is 35.\n2.  Calculate the value of $\\lceil \\log_2 35 \\rceil$. The ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\n3.  Multiply the result from step 2 by $n=35$ to get the final answer.\n\nI will provide a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_graph_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\n    covering all the edges of the complete graph K_n.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 35\n\n    # The problem asks for the minimum sum of the number of vertices in a family\n    # of bipartite graphs that cover all edges of K_n.\n    # A known theorem states that this minimum is given by the formula: n * ceil(log2(n)).\n\n    # Step 1: We have n = 35.\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate ceil(log2(n)).\n    # We need to find the smallest integer k such that 2^k >= n.\n    # 2^5 = 32\n    # 2^6 = 64\n    # Since 32 < 35 <= 64, the ceiling of log2(35) is 6.\n    k = math.ceil(math.log2(n))\n\n    # Step 3: Multiply n by the result from Step 2.\n    min_total_vertices = n * k\n\n    # Output the steps of the calculation and the final result.\n    print(f\"The problem is to find the minimum total vertices for K_n where n = {n}.\")\n    print(f\"The formula for the minimum is n * ceil(log2(n)).\")\n    print(f\"First, we calculate ceil(log2({n})).\")\n    print(f\"log2({n}) is approximately {math.log2(n):.4f}.\")\n    print(f\"The ceiling of {math.log2(n):.4f} is {k}.\")\n    print(f\"Finally, we compute the result of the equation:\")\n    print(f\"{n} * {k} = {min_total_vertices}\")\n    print(f\"The minimum number of vertices is {min_total_vertices}.\")\n\nsolve_graph_problem()\n```\n<<<210>>>"
