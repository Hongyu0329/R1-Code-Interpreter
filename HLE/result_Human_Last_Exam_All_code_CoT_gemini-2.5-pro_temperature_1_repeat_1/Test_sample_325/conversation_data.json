    "Of course, I can help with that. This question requires applying a major theorem from harmonic analysis to a specific case. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Curve**: The given curve is $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The sharp decoupling exponent depends on the geometric properties of the curve, specifically its non-degeneracy. A curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is non-degenerate if its first $d$ derivatives are linearly independent.\n2.  **Check for Non-degeneracy**: For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ ($d=3$), we will check if the first three derivatives, $\\gamma'(t), \\gamma''(t), \\gamma'''(t)$, are linearly independent. This is confirmed if the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is non-zero.\n    *   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n    *   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n    *   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n    The determinant of these vectors is the scalar triple product $[\\gamma', \\gamma'', \\gamma''']$, which equals $\\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$. Since this is never zero, the curve is non-degenerate.\n3.  **Apply the Decoupling Theorem**: A cornerstone result by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth establishes the sharp $l^2$ decoupling inequality for non-degenerate curves. The theorem states that the inequality holds for the range of Lebesgue exponents $p \\ge p_c$, where $p_c$ is the critical exponent.\n4.  **Calculate the Exponent**: The formula for this critical exponent $p_c$ for a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is:\n    $p_c = \\frac{d(d+1)}{d-1}$\n5.  **Code the Calculation**: I will write a Python script to substitute $d=3$ into this formula and print the result, showing each number in the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# The dimension of the ambient space for the curve is d.\n# The curve is in R^3, so d=3.\nd = 3\n\n# The formula for the sharp l^2 decoupling exponent (the critical exponent p_c)\n# for a non-degenerate curve in R^d is:\n# p_c = d * (d + 1) / (d - 1)\n# This result is a consequence of the l^2 decoupling theorem by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth.\n\n# We calculate the numerator and denominator of the formula.\nnumerator = d * (d + 1)\ndenominator = d - 1\n\n# Calculate the final value for the exponent.\np_c = numerator / denominator\n\n# Print the final equation with all the numbers, as requested.\nprint(f\"The sharp l^2 decoupling exponent p_c is calculated as:\")\nprint(f\"p_c = {d} * ({d} + 1) / ({d} - 1)\")\nprint(f\"p_c = {numerator} / {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"p_c = {p_c}\")\n\n```\n<<<6.0>>>"
