# The problem asks for the lower bound of a given mathematical expression.
# Based on a known identity in the field of nonlinear partial differential equations,
# the expression is bounded below by a constant 'a'.
# The value of this constant is -1/8.

# The final equation for the lower bound is a = -1/8.
# As requested, we output the numbers from this equation.
numerator = -1
denominator = 8

# Calculate the value of the lower bound.
a = numerator / denominator

print("The final equation for the lower bound is a = numerator/denominator.")
print(f"The value of the numerator is: {numerator}")
print(f"The value of the denominator is: {denominator}")
print(f"The constant lower bound a is: {a}")
