    1. The core of the problem lies in the specified subterm relation: `(λ x. f)` is considered a subterm of ANY term `X`.
    2. Structural recursion depends on a well-founded subterm relation to guarantee termination. The given rule breaks this well-foundedness. It allows, in principle, the creation of non-terminating objects or proofs using the machinery of structural recursion.
    3. Such a flaw often leads to logical paradoxes when combined with other powerful axioms. The most famous relevant paradoxes are Girard's and Burali-Forti's, which are based on constructing types that are "too large" to be consistent, leading to a contradiction (a proof of False).
    4. These paradoxes are normally prevented in dependent type theory by a strict hierarchy of universes (Type₀, Type₁, etc.). A type's members live in one universe, while the type itself lives in a higher one, preventing paradoxical self-reference.
    5. 'Propositional resizing' is an axiom that collapses this hierarchy. It allows a proposition (a type in a universe like `Prop` or `Type₀`) to be made equivalent to a type in a different universe. This flattening of the hierarchy re-enables the paradoxes.
    6. Therefore, the inconsistency arises from the combination of two factors:
        a) The ability to perform non-well-founded constructions, provided by the faulty subterm rule.
        b) The collapsing of the universe hierarchy, provided by 'Propositional Resizing'.
    7. Among the given choices, 'Propositional resizing' is the axiom known to be inconsistent with systems that allow the construction of certain large inductive types, a construction which the faulty recursion rule would facilitate.
