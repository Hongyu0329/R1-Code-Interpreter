    Identifies the reactant compound based on the reaction product.

    The reaction described is an intramolecular aldol condensation of a 1,5-diketone,
    which is a key step in the Robinson annulation. The product is
    1-methyl-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one.

    By performing a retrosynthesis, the precursor 1,5-diketone can be identified.
    This diketone is formed from the Michael addition of cyclohexanone to
    pent-3-en-2-one.
