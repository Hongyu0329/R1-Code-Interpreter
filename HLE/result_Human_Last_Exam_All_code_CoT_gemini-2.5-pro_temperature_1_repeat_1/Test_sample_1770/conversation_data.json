    "To prevent the degradation of p-coumaric acid in *Corynebacterium glutamicum*, you should knock out the gene responsible for the first step in its catabolic pathway.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the primary degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid in *C. glutamicum*. Research indicates that p-coumaric acid is primarily degraded by being first activated to its CoA-thioester, p-coumaroyl-CoA. This molecule is then further metabolized into protocatechuate and enters the beta-ketoadipate pathway.\n2.  Identify the specific gene that catalyzes this first critical step. The enzyme responsible is p-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (also known as feruloyl-CoA synthetase due to its broad substrate specificity).\n3.  Find the locus tag or common name for this gene in the *C. glutamicum* genome. The gene is identified as `calB`, also known by its locus tag `cg2915` in the reference strain ATCC 13032.\n4.  Conclude that knocking out the `calB` gene will block the entry of p-coumaric acid into the degradation pathway, thereby preventing its loss and increasing its accumulation.\n5.  I will provide a Python script that prints this gene name as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_knockout_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the gene to knock out in Corynebacterium glutamicum to prevent\n    p-coumaric acid degradation.\n\n    The primary degradation pathway for p-coumaric acid involves its activation\n    to p-coumaroyl-CoA by the enzyme p-coumaroyl-CoA ligase.
