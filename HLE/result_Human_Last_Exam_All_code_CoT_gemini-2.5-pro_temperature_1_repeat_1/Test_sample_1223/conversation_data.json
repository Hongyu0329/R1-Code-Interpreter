    "This problem comes from the field of point-set topology and concerns the properties of very specific types of spaces called continua. The solution does not involve a numerical calculation but rather a logical deduction based on established mathematical theorems. The answer is a transfinite cardinal number, not an integer or a real number.\n\nHere is my step-by-step thinking process to arrive at the solution:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The goal is to find the maximum possible number of \"composants\" of the \"Stone-Cech remainder\" of $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$. Here, $X$ is a \"hereditary indecomposable metric continuum\" and $x$ is a point in it.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Space:** Let $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n    *   Since $X$ is a compact metric continuum, $Y$ is a locally compact, non-compact, connected, and separable metric space.\n    *   The Stone-Cech remainder is the set $R = \\beta Y \\setminus Y$, where $\\beta Y$ is the Stone-Cech compactification of $Y$.\n    *   Because $Y$ is connected and non-compact, its remainder $R$ is a compact continuum (a compact, connected space).\n    *   A key property is that because $Y$ is locally compact but not compact, its remainder $R$ is **non-metrizable**. This is a standard result in the theory of Stone-Cech compactifications.\n\n3.  **Relate to Composants:** A composant is a concept for indecomposable continua. An indecomposable continuum is one that cannot be split into two smaller, proper subcontinua.\n    *   If the remainder $R$ is decomposable, it has exactly 1 composant (the space itself).\n    *   If the remainder $R$ is indecomposable, the number of composants is more complex.\n\n4.  **Investigate Indecomposability of R:** Is the remainder $R$ indecomposable? This depends on the choice of $X$. However, we are looking for the *maximum* possible number of composants. So, we only need to find one example of $X$ that gives a large number.\n    *   Let's choose $X$ to be the **pseudo-arc**, which is the prime example of a hereditary indecomposable metric continuum.\n    *   A significant result by topologist Wayne Lewis (1989) shows that for the pseudo-arc $P$, the remainder $\\beta(P \\setminus \\{p\\})^*$ is indeed an **indecomposable continuum**.\n\n5.  **Count the Composants of a Non-Metrizable Indecomposable Continuum:** Now we need to find the number of composants for the remainder $R$ derived from the pseudo-arc.\n    *   We have established that this $R$ is a non-metrizable and indecomposable continuum.\n    *   For separable metric indecomposable continua, the number of composants is $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$). But our space $R$ is non-metrizable.\n    *   A powerful theorem by Juul, Martinez-Montejano, and van Mill (2014) answers this precisely: **Every non-metrizable indecomposable continuum has at least $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$ composants.**\n\n6.  **Find an Upper Bound:** The number of composants cannot be larger than the total number of points in the space $R$.\n    *   The cardinality of the Stone-Cech remainder of a non-compact, locally compact, $\\sigma$-compact space (which $Y = X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is) is known to be $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n    *   So, $|R| = 2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n\n7.  **Conclusion:** For the case where $X$ is the pseudo-arc, the number of composants of the remainder $R$, let's call it $N$, must satisfy:\n    *   $N \\ge 2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$ (from the Juul et al. theorem)\n    *   $N \\le |R| = 2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$ (as the number of parts cannot exceed the size of the whole)\n    *   Therefore, for this specific $X$, the number of composants is exactly $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n\n8.  **Final Answer:** The possible number of composants is either 1 (if $R$ is decomposable) or $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$ (if $R$ is indecomposable, which is a possible case). The maximum of these two values is $2^{\\mathfrak{c}}$. This number can be written as $2^{2^{\\aleph_0}}$.\n\nSince the prompt requires a script, I will provide a Python script that prints this explanation and the final answer in a symbolic \"equation\" format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_topology_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the solution to the topological problem.\n    The problem asks for the maximum possible number of composants of the\n    Stone-Cech remainder of X \\ {x}, where X is a hereditary indecomposable\n    metric continuum. The answer is not a simple number but a transfinite\n    cardinal number.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: The space in question is the Stone-Cech remainder R = beta(X \\\\ {x})*.\")\n    print(\"Step 2: For any such X, R is a compact, connected, but non-metrizable continuum.\")\n    print(\"Step 3: We must find an X that maximizes the number of composants of R.\")\n    print(\"Step 4: If we choose X to be the pseudo-arc, it is known that the remainder R is an indecomposable continuum.\")\n    print(\"Step 5: A key theorem states that any non-metrizable indecomposable continuum has at least 2^c composants, where c is the cardinality of the continuum (c = 2^aleph_0).\")\n    print(\"Step 6: The cardinality of the space R itself is 2^c. The number of composants cannot exceed the cardinality of the space.\")\n    print(\"Step 7: Combining steps 5 and 6, the number of composants for this case is exactly 2^c.\")\n    print(\"Step 8: Since other cases would result in 1 composant (if R is decomposable), the maximum possible number is 2^c.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is a cardinal number.
