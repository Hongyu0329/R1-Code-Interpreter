# The task is to identify a non-classical Greek word in each of two passages,
# provide its classical equivalent, and the period to which the non-classical form belongs.
# The final output should be a single string in the format "W1,C1,P1,W2,C2,P2".

# Analysis of Passage 1:
# The word "εἶμαι" is the form of "I am" used in Koine, Byzantine, Katharevousa, and Demotic Greek.
# The correct classical Attic form is "εἰμί".
W1 = "εἶμαι"
C1 = "εἰμί"
P1 = "KoineByzantineKatharevousaDemotic"

# Analysis of Passage 2:
# The word "ὄρνιθα" is the accusative singular of "bird".
# This form is characteristic of the Homeric dialect.
# The standard classical Attic prose equivalent is "ὄρνιν".
W2 = "ὄρνιθα"
C2 = "ὄρνιν"
P2 = "Homeric"

# Combine the results into the required comma-separated format.
result_string = f"{W1},{C1},{P1},{W2},{C2},{P2}"

# Print the final result string.
print(result_string)
