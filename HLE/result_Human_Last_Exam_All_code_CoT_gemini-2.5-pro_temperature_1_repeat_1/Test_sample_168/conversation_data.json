    "Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  First, I need to determine the frequency of the sound produced by human muscle twitches.\n2.  Next, I will research the hearing frequency range for each of the animals listed in the answer choices (Dog, Bat, Herring, Whale, Human).\n3.  Then, I will compare the frequency of muscle twitches with the hearing range of each animal to find a match.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores these hearing ranges, compares them to the target frequency, prints the analysis for each animal, and identifies the most likely answer. The script will use the frequency value as a number to satisfy the prompt's requirements.\n\n```python\ndef find_animal_that_can_hear_muscle_twitches():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the hearing ranges of different animals to determine\n    which might be able to hear human muscle twitches.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the frequency of human muscle twitches.\n    # Muscle contractions produce very low-frequency sounds (sonomyography),\n    # typically around 25 Hz.\n    target_frequency = 25  # Hz\n\n    print(f\"The sound of a human muscle twitch has a very low frequency, around {target_frequency} Hz.\")\n    print(\"Let's analyze the hearing range of each animal:\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Define the hearing ranges for the animals.\n    # Data is approximate and can vary between individuals and species.\n    animal_hearing_ranges = {\n        \"A.
