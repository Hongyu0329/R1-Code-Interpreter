    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the number of unique paths of exactly 10 steps on a 2D grid (Manhattan lattice) starting from an origin point, with the condition that the path never visits the same point twice. This is known as a self-avoiding walk.\n\n2.  **Choose the Right Algorithm**: This problem is a classic counting problem on a grid, which can be solved efficiently using a recursive algorithm with backtracking. We will start at the origin `(0, 0)` and explore all possible paths step-by-step.\n\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm**:\n    *   I will write a Python function, let's call it `count_walks`, that recursively explores possible moves.\n    *   This function will take three arguments: the number of steps remaining, the current position on the grid, and a set of points already visited in the current path.\n    *   **Base Case**: If the number of steps remaining is 0, it means we have successfully completed a 10-step walk. We count this as one valid path and return 1.\n    *   **Recursive Step**: From the current position, we will try to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).\n    *   For each potential move, we check if the new point has already been visited.\n    *   If it's a new point, we add it to our set of visited points and make a recursive call to `count_walks` with the step count decreased by one.\n    *   **Backtracking**: After the recursive call returns, we must remove the point from the visited set. This is the \"backtracking\" step, which allows other paths to be explored from the same position.\n    *   The function will sum the results from all valid moves and return the total count.\n\n4.  **Final Output**: The script will call this function to calculate `a(10)` and print the result in the format `a(10) = [result]`.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_a10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(10), the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks\n    on a Manhattan lattice using a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    \n    # Memoization dictionary to store results of subproblems.\n    # The key is a tuple: (steps_left, current_position, frozenset_of_relative_visited_points)\n    # This optimization is complex to implement correctly for this problem structure.\n    # A direct recursive search is feasible for n=10.\n    \n    def count_walks(steps_left, current_pos, visited):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts the number of self-avoiding walks.\n\n        Args:\n            steps_left: The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            current_pos: The current (x, y) coordinate tuple.\n            visited: A set of (x, y) tuples representing visited points.\n\n        Returns:\n            The total number of valid self-avoiding walks from the current state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete valid path.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        x, y = current_pos\n        total_walks = 0\n\n        # Explore the four neighboring positions (North, South, East, West).\n        for dx, dy in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n            next_pos = (x + dx, y + dy)\n\n            # If the next position has not been visited yet...\n            if next_pos not in visited:\n                # ...explore from this new position.\n                visited.add(next_pos)\n                total_walks += count_walks(steps_left - 1, next_pos, visited)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point so other paths can be explored.\n                visited.remove(next_pos)\n\n        return total_walks\n\n    # Initial call to the recursive function.\n    # Start at the origin (0, 0) with n steps to go.\n    # The initial path contains only the starting point.\n    start_pos = (0, 0)\n    visited_set = {start_pos}\n    \n    result = count_walks(n, start_pos, visited_set)\n\n    # Print the final equation with the numbers involved.\n    print(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\n# Execute the solution\nsolve_a10()\n<<<44100>>>\n```"
