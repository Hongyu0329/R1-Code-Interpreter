    "This is a historical trivia question. I will identify the person based on the clues provided.\n\n1.  **Poet:** The poem is by Andrei Voznesensky. Voznesensky was the librettist for the famous Russian rock opera \"Juno and Avos\".\n2.  **Subject:** The opera is about the Russian diplomat and explorer Nikolai Rezanov. His story involves a long sea journey, fitting the \"sailor\" description.\n3.  **Grave:** Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk in 1807. His grave was destroyed in the 1930s. Due to the popularity of \"Juno and Avos,\" there was renewed interest in him, and the location of his grave was rediscovered, leading to a new monument being placed there in the late 1980s. This perfectly matches the clues.\n\nThe man's last name is Rezanov. I will now write a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the riddle based on the provided historical clues.\n    \n    Clues:\n    1.  The man was called \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by Andrei Voznesensky.\n    2.  Voznesensky wrote a poem asking where his grave was.\n    3.  The location of his grave was discovered in the late 1980s.\n    \n    Reasoning:\n    These clues point to Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of the rock opera \"Juno and Avos,\"\n    for which Voznesensky wrote the libretto. Rezanov was an explorer, and his grave in\n    Krasnoyarsk was lost and then rediscovered and memorialized in the late 20th century.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_name = \"Rezanov\"\n    print(f\"The last name of the man is: {last_name}\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
