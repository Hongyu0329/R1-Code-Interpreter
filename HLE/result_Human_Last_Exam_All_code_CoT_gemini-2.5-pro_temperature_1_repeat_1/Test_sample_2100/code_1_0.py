    This function solves the riddle based on the provided historical clues.
    
    Clues:
    1.  The man was called "a joy-discovering sailor" by Andrei Voznesensky.
    2.  Voznesensky wrote a poem asking where his grave was.
    3.  The location of his grave was discovered in the late 1980s.
    
    Reasoning:
    These clues point to Nikolai Rezanov, the subject of the rock opera "Juno and Avos,"
    for which Voznesensky wrote the libretto. Rezanov was an explorer, and his grave in
    Krasnoyarsk was lost and then rediscovered and memorialized in the late 20th century.
