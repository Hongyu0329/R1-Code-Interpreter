    "This problem can be solved using a key result from differential topology called Morse theory. Morse theory connects the number of critical points of a smooth function on a manifold to the topological properties of that manifold.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the manifold and its topological properties:** The manifold is the 2-torus, $T^2$. Its key topological properties are its Betti numbers, which describe its \"holes\".\n2.  **Apply the Morse Inequalities:** For any smooth *Morse function* (a function whose critical points are non-degenerate), the number of critical points of a certain type (index) is bounded below by the corresponding Betti number.\n    *   Let $c_k$ be the number of critical points of index $k$.\n    *   Let $b_k$ be the $k$-th Betti number of the manifold.\n    *   The Morse Inequalities state that $c_k \\ge b_k$ for all $k$.\n3.  **Calculate the Betti numbers for the 2-torus ($T^2$):**\n    *   $b_0$: The number of connected components. For a torus, $b_0 = 1$.\n    *   $b_1$: The number of \"1-dimensional holes\" (independent loops). A torus has two, one around its circumference and one through the hole. So, $b_1 = 2$.\n    *   $b_2$: The number of \"2-dimensional holes\" (enclosed voids). A torus encloses one void. So, $b_2 = 1$.\n4.  **Find the minimum number of critical points:**\n    *   The total number of critical points is the sum of critical points of all indices: $C = c_0 + c_1 + c_2$.\n    *   Using the Morse inequalities, we can find the minimum value for each $c_k$ and sum them to find the minimum total number of critical points.\n    *   The critical points of index 0, 1, and 2 correspond to local minima, saddle points, and local maxima, respectively.\n5.  **Generalize to all smooth functions:** The result derived for Morse functions provides a lower bound for *any* smooth function. It can be shown that this bound is indeed the minimum. An example function on the torus with exactly this many critical points exists, confirming it's the minimum.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation based on this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_minimal_critical_points():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function on a 2-torus\n    using Morse theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Define the Betti numbers for the 2-torus (T^2).\")\n    # b_k is the k-th Betti number.\n    # For a 2-torus T^2:\n    # b_0 = number of connected components = 1\n    # b_1 = number of 1D holes (loops) = 2\n    # b_2 = number of 2D holes (voids) = 1\n    betti_numbers = {\n        0: 1,\n        1: 2,\n        2: 1\n    }\n    print(f\"b_0 = {betti_numbers[0]} (minima)\")\n    print(f\"b_1 = {betti_numbers[1]} (saddles)\")\n    print(f\"b_2 = {betti_numbers[2]} (maxima)\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Apply the Morse Inequalities.\")\n    print(\"The number of critical points of index k (c_k) must be at least the k-th Betti number (b_k).\")\n    print(\"c_k >= b_k\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Calculate the minimal number of critical points for each index.\")\n    # c_k_min is the minimal number of critical points of index k.\n    c_min = {}\n    for k, b_k in betti_numbers.items():\n        c_min[k] = b_k # The minimal number is the Betti number itself.\n        print(f\"Minimal c_{k} = b_{k} = {b_k}\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Calculate the total minimal number of critical points.\")\n    total_min_critical_points = sum(c_min.values())\n    \n    # Create the equation string\n    equation_parts = [f\"{c}\" for c in c_min.values()]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"The minimal total number of critical points is the sum of the minimal c_k values.\")\n    print(f\"Minimal Total = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 = {equation_str} = {total_min_critical_points}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    # Bonus: Check the Euler characteristic\n    # The alternating sum of critical points must equal the Euler characteristic.\n    # Euler characteristic chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0\n    # For our minimal numbers: c_0 - c_1 + c_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0.
