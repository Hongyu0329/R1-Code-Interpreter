    print("\nStep 1: Background Information")
    print("  - Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1): Caused by an unstable expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the DMPK gene.")
    print("  - Somatic Instability: The length of this CTG repeat tends to increase in an individual's somatic (non-reproductive) cells over time, worsening the disease.")
    print("  - DNA Ligase 1 (LIG1): A key enzyme that seals nicks in DNA, particularly by joining Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA replication.")

    print("\nStep 2: Mechanism of CTG Repeat Expansion")
    print("  - During DNA replication, the CTG repeat region can form stable secondary structures called 'hairpins' on the single-stranded DNA template.")
    print("  - If not resolved correctly, these hairpins can lead to the insertion of extra CTG repeats by the DNA replication and repair machinery.")

    print("\nStep 3: The Role of LIG1 in Preventing Expansion")
    print("  - LIG1's primary job is to quickly and efficiently seal the nicks between Okazaki fragments.")
    print("  - This rapid sealing is protective because it minimizes the time the DNA exists in a single-stranded state, reducing the opportunity for hairpins to form.")

    print("\nStep 4: Consequence of LIG1 Knockout")
    print("  - When LIG1 is absent ('knocked out'), the sealing of these nicks is delayed and must be handled by other, less efficient backup pathways.")
    print("  - This delay allows more time for the CTG repeats to fold into stable hairpins.")
    print("  - The processing of these hairpins by alternative repair pathways is error-prone and frequently results in the addition of more repeats.")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("  - Therefore, knocking out LIG1 removes a key protective factor.")
    print("  - The result is a higher frequency of hairpin formation and subsequent repeat expansion.")
    print("  - The overall impact is an INCREASED somatic instability of the CTG repeat tract.")
    
    print("\nFinal Equation: LIG1 Knockout => Delayed Nick Sealing => Increased Hairpin Formation => Increased CTG Expansions => Increased Instability")
