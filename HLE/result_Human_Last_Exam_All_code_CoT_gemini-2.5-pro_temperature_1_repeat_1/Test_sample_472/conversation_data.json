    "My plan is to scan the provided Latin line, \"et tibi bene esse soli quom sibi sit male,\" according to the rules of classical quantitative meter. I will analyze the line syllable by syllable to determine if each is long (L) or short (S).\n\n1.  **Syllabification and Vowel Length**: I will break the line into syllables. A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or diphthong, or if its vowel is followed by two or more consonants (long by position). Otherwise, it is short.\n2.  **Elision and Apocope**: I will account for elision, where a word ending in a vowel is dropped before a word starting with a vowel (e.g., `ben(e) esse`). I will also consider apocope, a feature common in early Latin playwrights like Plautus, where a final short vowel like `-e` can be dropped (e.g., `male` becoming `mal`).\n3.  **Grouping into Feet**: I will group the resulting L and S sequence into metrical feet. A dactyl is LSS and a spondee is LL.\n4.  **Code Implementation**: I will write a Python script to print out the analysis, showing how each foot is formed from the words in the line, and then print the final, complete scansion on a new line. I will also include a brief note explaining why the line is not a standard six-foot hexameter, as it is a line from Plautine comedy which used different meters.\n\n```python\ndef scan_latin_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and prints the scansion of a Latin line from Plautus.\n    The function breaks down the scansion foot by foot and then prints the final result.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # This line is from Plautus and is metrically complex.\n    # It does not scan as a standard dactylic hexameter but as a 5-foot line.\n    # Scansion details:\n    # 1. et tibi: 'et' is long by position (before 't').

'sibi' is short-short. -> L S S\n    # 5. sit mal(e): 'sit' is long by position (before 'm').
