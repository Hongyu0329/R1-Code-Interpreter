def solve_cardinality_problem():
    """
    This function determines the maximum possible cardinality of the set S.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  The set of all Diophantine equations is countably infinite (aleph_0),
        so the cardinality of S cannot exceed this. |S| <= aleph_0.
    2.  We can construct a countably infinite sequence of Diophantine equations D_n
        (related to the consistency of ZFC, ZFC+Con(ZFC), etc.) whose
        unsolvability is unprovable in ZFC.
    3.  We can find a single statement psi (e.g., "there exists a transitive
        model of ZFC") such that ZFC + psi proves the unsolvability of all D_n.
    4.  This shows that a case exists where S is countably infinite.
    5.  Combining these, the maximum possible cardinality is aleph_0.
