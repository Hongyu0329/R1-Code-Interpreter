    "My plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  First, I will research the topic of mushroom spore print colors to verify the user's premise.\n2.  My research indicates that while some mushrooms have blue-staining flesh or blue latex (a milky fluid), a true blue spore print is not known to exist in the fungal kingdom. This is a common point of confusion.\n3.  The mushroom most famously and vividly blue is *Lactarius indigo*. When cut, its flesh and latex are a deep indigo blue.\n4.  Although its spore print is actually yellowish to cream, the genus *Lactarius* is the one universally associated with a distinctly blue mushroom.\n5.  Therefore, I will provide the name of this genus as the most likely answer to the user's question, despite the scientific inaccuracy of the \"blue spore print\" premise.\n6.  I will write a simple Python script to print the name of this genus.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the mushroom genus famously known for its blue color.\n# While no mushroom is known to have a truly blue spore print,\n# this genus contains the iconic blue-staining mushroom, Lactarius indigo.\n\ngenus_name = \"Lactarius\"\nprint(genus_name)\n```\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
