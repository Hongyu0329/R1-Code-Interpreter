    print("Let r_0 = r intersect gamma. Since r is finite, r_0 is also finite.")

    print("The family B' = {b'_alpha : alpha in X} consists of pairwise disjoint sets.")

    print("Each set b'_alpha is a subset of b_alpha, which is a subset of gamma.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("The initial assumption must be false. Y cannot contain any uncountable cardinals.")
    print("This means Y is a subset of the set of countable cardinals (finite cardinals and omega).")
