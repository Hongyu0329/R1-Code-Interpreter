    "To find the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and the Task:** The semidihedral group of size 512 is denoted as $SD_{512}$. In the general form $SD_{2^n}$, this corresponds to $n=9$. A \"power subgroup\" is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element of the group. The task is to count the number of distinct cyclic subgroups of $SD_{512}$.\n\n2.  **Group Structure:** The semidihedral group $SD_{2^n}$ is defined by the presentation $\\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$. For $n=9$, this is $SD_{512} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$. The group consists of $2^{n-1}=256$ elements forming a cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$, and another $2^{n-1}=256$ elements in the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n3.  **Strategy for Counting:** We can partition the cyclic subgroups into two types:\n    a) Cyclic subgroups that are entirely contained within the maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$.\n    b) Cyclic subgroups that are not contained within $\\langle r \\rangle$. These must be generated by elements from the coset $s\\langle r \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Count Subgroups of Type (a):** The subgroup $\\langle r \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order $256$. The number of subgroups in a finite cyclic group is equal to the number of divisors of its order. The order is $256 = 2^8$, and its divisors are $2^0, 2^1, \\dots, 2^8$. Thus, there are $8+1=9$ such subgroups. In general for $SD_{2^n}$, this is $\\tau(2^{n-1}) = n$.\n\n5.  **Count Subgroups of Type (b):** These subgroups are generated by elements of the form $g = sr^i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 255\\}$. We analyze the order of these elements. The square of such an element is $(sr^i)^2 = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1+1)} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}} = r^{128i}$.\n    *   **Case 1: $i$ is even.** Let $i=2k$. Then $(sr^{2k})^2 = r^{2k \\cdot 128} = r^{256k} = 1$. These $128$ elements have order 2. Each one generates a distinct cyclic subgroup of order 2. This gives $2^{n-2} = 128$ subgroups.\n    *   **Case 2: $i$ is odd.** Then $(sr^i)^2 = r^{128i} = r^{128} \\neq 1$. However, $(sr^i)^4 = (r^{128})^2 = r^{256}=1$. So these elements have order 4.\n        The subgroup generated by $sr^i$ is $\\langle sr^i \\rangle$. Its other generator of order 4 is $(sr^i)^3 = sr^{i+128}$. This means that $\\langle sr^i \\rangle = \\langle sr^{i+128} \\rangle$. The $128$ elements with odd $i$ form $128/2 = 64$ distinct cyclic subgroups of order 4. In general for $SD_{2^n}$, this is $2^{n-2}/2 = 2^{n-3}$ subgroups.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation:** The total number of cyclic subgroups is the sum of the counts from these disjoint sets.\n    *   From within $\\langle r \\rangle$: 9\n    *   From $s\\langle r \\rangle$ (order 2): 128\n    *   From $s\\langle r \\rangle$ (order 4): 64\n    *   Total = $9 + 128 + 64 = 201$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The size of the semidihedral group is 2^n.\ngroup_size = 512\n\n# Find n from the group size\nn = int(math.log2(group_size))\n\n# 1.

Number of cyclic subgroups generated by elements of the form sr^i.\n# These elements have order 2 if i is even, and order 4 if i is odd.\nnum_elements_in_coset = 2**(n-1)\n\n# Case i is even: There are 2^(n-2) such elements, each generating a unique subgroup of order 2.\nnum_subgroups_order_2_coset = 2**(n-2)\n\n# Case i is odd: There are 2^(n-2) such elements. They generate subgroups of order 4.\n# These subgroups come in pairs, <sr^i> = <sr^(i + 2^(n-2))>.\n# So the number of distinct subgroups is (2^(n-2)) / 2 = 2^(n-3).\nnum_subgroups_order_4_coset = 2**(n-3)\n\n# The total number of power subgroups is the sum of these disjoint collections.\ntotal_subgroups = num_subgroups_in_r + num_subgroups_order_2_coset + num_subgroups_order_4_coset\n\nprint(f\"The analysis is for the semidihedral group of size {group_size} (SD_{group_size}), where n={n}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(f\"Number of cyclic subgroups within the maximal cyclic subgroup <r>: {num_subgroups_in_r}\")\nprint(f\"Number of cyclic subgroups of order 2 from the coset s<r>: {num_subgroups_order_2_coset}\")\nprint(f\"Number of cyclic subgroups of order 4 from the coset s<r>: {num_subgroups_order_4_coset}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 40)\nprint(\"The total number of power (cyclic) subgroups is the sum of these values.\")\nprint(f\"Total = {num_subgroups_in_r} + {num_subgroups_order_2_coset} + {num_subgroups_order_4_coset} = {total_subgroups}\")\n\n```\n<<<201>>>"
