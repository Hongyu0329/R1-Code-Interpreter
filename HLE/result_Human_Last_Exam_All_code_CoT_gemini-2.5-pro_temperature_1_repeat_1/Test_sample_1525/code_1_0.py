# This script calculates the number of correct statements based on the analysis.

# We assign a boolean value to each statement's correctness.
# Statement A: Correct. The definition for segregation is ambiguous.
is_A_correct = True
# Statement B: Incorrect. It inaccurately represents the claim made in the problem description.
is_B_correct = False
# Statement C: Correct. The composition of aggregation followed by segregation does not necessarily recover the original program.
is_C_correct = True
# Statement D: Correct. The ambiguity in the segregation definition also applies to the initial set of facts S0.
is_D_correct = True
# Statement E: Correct. This is a valid high-level interpretation of the claim's meaning regarding information loss and granularity.
is_E_correct = True

# The total number of correct statements is the sum of the boolean values (where True=1 and False=0).
