    "To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number `m` such that we can place `m` white queens and `m` black queens on a 16x16 chessboard without any two queens of the same color attacking each other.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Constraints:** The problem involves two sets of queens, white and black. The non-aggression rule applies only to queens of the same color. This means we are looking for two independent solutions to the N-Queens problem on the same N x N board, with the added condition that the positions of the white queens and black queens must be disjoint (a square cannot be occupied by more than one queen).\n\n2.  **Determine the Upper Bound for `m`:** The N-Queens problem asks for the maximum number of non-attacking queens (of one color) that can be placed on an N x N board. For N â‰¥ 4, the answer is N. In our case, the board size is N=16. Therefore, you can place a maximum of 16 white queens that don't attack each other, and a maximum of 16 black queens that don't attack each other. This means `m` cannot be greater than 16. So, `m <= 16`.\n\n3.  **Prove `m = 16` is Possible:** To show that `m = 16` is the maximum value, we need to demonstrate that it's possible to place 16 white queens and 16 black queens on the board according to the rules. This requires finding two valid and disjoint 16-Queens solutions on a 16x16 board.\n\n4.  **Construct the First Solution (White Queens):** We can use a known explicit formula to construct a solution for the 16-Queens problem. For an even-sized board N where N mod 6 is not 2 or 3 (16 mod 6 = 4, so this works), a solution can be generated. We will place one queen per row, so the positions can be represented as `(row, col)` pairs, or `(i, p[i])` where `p` is a permutation of `0, 1, ..., 15`.\n\n5.  **Construct the Second Solution (Black Queens):** A simple way to generate a second, distinct, and valid solution is to reflect the first solution across one of the board's centerlines. If we take the solution for the white queens and reflect it across the vertical centerline, we get a new set of coordinates. This new set is also a valid 16-Queens solution and, crucially, will be disjoint from the original set.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python:** I will write a Python script to perform these steps:\n    *   Define the board size `N = 16`.\n    *   Generate the coordinates for the 16 white queens using the construction formula.\n    *   Generate the coordinates for the 16 black queens by reflecting the white queen positions.\n    *   Print both sets of coordinates to demonstrate the valid and disjoint placement.\n    *   Conclude that the maximum value of `m` is 16.\n\n```python\ndef solve_m_queens():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and demonstrates the solution for the maximum number m of\n    white and black queens on a 16x16 board.\n    \"\"\"\n    N = 16\n    \n    print(f\"The problem is to find the maximum number m such that m white queens and m black queens\")\n    print(f\"can coexist on a {N}x{N} chessboard without queens of the same color attacking each other.\\n\")\n    \n    print(f\"Step 1: Determine the upper limit for m.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum number of non-attacking queens of a single color on an {N}x{N} board is {N}.\")\n    print(f\"This is the classic {N}-Queens problem.
