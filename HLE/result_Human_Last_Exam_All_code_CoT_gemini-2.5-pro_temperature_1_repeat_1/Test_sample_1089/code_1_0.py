    print("1. The repair method is 'TIG welding build-up of layers'. This is an additive manufacturing process used to restore material that has been lost from a component.")
    print("2. This process is ideal for correcting dimensional deficiencies caused by material loss, rather than fixing cracks (A, E) or internal deformation (D).")
    print("3. Both Foreign Object Damage (B) and High-Temperature Corrosion (F) can cause material loss. However, Foreign Object Damage often creates localized nicks, and corrosion repair is often focused on reapplying coatings.")
    print("4. 'Blade Tip Rub and Wear' (C) describes the specific, common, and predictable process where material is ground away from the blade tip due to contact with the engine casing.")
    print("5. Restoring the blade's original length and tip profile by building up weld material is the standard, direct, and most common application for this repair technique.")
    print("\nConclusion: The build-up process is perfectly suited to replace the material lost from the blade tip.")
