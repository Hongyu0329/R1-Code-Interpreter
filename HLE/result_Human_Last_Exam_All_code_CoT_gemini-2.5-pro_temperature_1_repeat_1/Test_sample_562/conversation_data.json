    "My plan to identify the radical of the character 謄 is as follows:\n1.  I will first break down the kanji character 謄 into its constituent parts.\n2.  The character 謄 is composed of a left part and a right part. The left part is 言, and the right part is 朕.\n3.  In Japanese kanji, the radical (bushu) is often found on the left side of the character. This left-side radical position is called a \"hen\" (偏).\n4.  The radical for 謄 is indeed the left part, 言, which relates to words, speech, or language.\n5.  The specific name for the 言 radical when it appears on the left side of a character is \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n6.  Finally, I will provide the Hepburn romanization of \"gonben\", which is \"Gonben\".\nI will now write a Python script to print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The kanji in question is 謄.\n    # It is composed of the radical 言 (gen, meaning 'word') on the left\n    # and the component 朕 on the right.\n    # The radical 言 on the left side of a character is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n    radical_name_hepburn = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_name_hepburn)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
