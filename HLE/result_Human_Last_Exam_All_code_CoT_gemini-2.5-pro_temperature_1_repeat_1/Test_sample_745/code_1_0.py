    This function solves the topology problem about the number of components.
    
    Let X be a connected T1 topological space of cardinality c (the continuum),
    A a connected subset of X, and C a component of X \setminus A.
    The question is: What is the largest number of components X \setminus C can have?

    The construction of a space that achieves the maximum is non-trivial and
    relies on advanced topological concepts (e.g., constructions by R. D. Anderson).

    The strategy is to construct X, A, and C such that:
    1. The set X \setminus A consists of c components. Let's call them C (the chosen one)
       and K_i for i in an index set of size c.
    2. The sets K_i are constructed to be connected to the rest of the space X
       *only* through C.
    3. The set A is also connected to the rest of the space X *only* through C.
    4. When C is removed, the set A becomes one component, and each set K_i becomes
       its own component, as their sole connection to the rest of the space has been severed.
    
    This results in c + 1 components. Since c + 1 = c for infinite cardinals,
    the total number of components is c.
