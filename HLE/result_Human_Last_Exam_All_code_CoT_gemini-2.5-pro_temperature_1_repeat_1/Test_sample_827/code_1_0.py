# Final Answer Derivation

# Step 1: Analyze the reaction.
# The reaction is a sequential nucleophilic aromatic substitution.
# Starting Material: Compound A (with two leaving groups)
# Reagent 1: tert-butyl hydrazine (a nucleophile)
# Reagent 2: benzylamine (a nucleophile)
# Base: DIPEA (to neutralize HCl byproduct)
# This implies Compound A is likely a dihalopyrimidine or similar dihalo-heterocycle.

# Step 2: Analyze the NMR spectra of the product.
# Key information from the spectra that builds the product's structure:
# 1H NMR (DMSO-d6):
#   - 7.37 â€“ 7.22 (m, 5H), 4.73 (d, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 8.69 (t, J=5.7 Hz, 1H): These signals definitively identify a benzylamino group (-NH-CH2-C6H5). The triplet at 8.69 ppm is the NH proton coupled to the CH2, and the doublet at 4.73 ppm is the CH2 group coupled to the NH. The 5H multiplet is the phenyl ring.
#   - 1.70 (s, 9H): This is the classic signature of a tert-butyl group, C(CH3)3, from the tert-butyl hydrazine reagent.
#   - 8.24 (s, 1H) and 8.11 (s, 1H): These are two protons on the core heterocyclic ring. The fact that they are both singlets means they are not adjacent to any other protons. This substitution pattern is characteristic of a 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidine, where the protons are at the C-2 and C-5 positions.

# 13C NMR (DMSO-d6):
#   - The signals for the benzyl group (139.82, 128.82, 127.85, 127.35, 43.52) and the tert-butyl group (59.79, 29.25) are present.
#   - The remaining signals (156.89, 154.96, 152.80, 130.16, 102.23) are consistent with the carbons of a pyrimidine ring substituted with two amino-type groups. C-4 and C-6, being attached to nitrogen, are expected to be far downfield (e.g., 156.89, 154.96), while C-2 and C-5 are the CH carbons.

# Step 3: Propose the structure and identify the starting material.
# Assembling these pieces, the final product is N-benzyl-6-(2-tert-butylhydrazinyl)pyrimidin-4-amine.
# This product is formed by substituting the groups at positions 4 and 6 of a pyrimidine ring.
# Therefore, Compound A must be a pyrimidine with good leaving groups at these two positions.
# The most common and commercially available starting material for this synthesis is 4,6-dichloropyrimidine.

# The final answer is the name of compound A.
compound_A = "4,6-dichloropyrimidine"
