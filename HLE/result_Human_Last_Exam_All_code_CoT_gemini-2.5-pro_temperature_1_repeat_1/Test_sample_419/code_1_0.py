    1.  **The Goal:** The experiment's purpose is to prove that an antibody's binding to MUC1 requires a specific sugar, the TN antigen. This is tested by seeing if free sugar (GalNAc) can compete with the MUC1 on the cell and block the antibody from binding.

    2.  **The Problem with the Competition Assay:** A high concentration of GalNAc (500 mM) is used. This high concentration might have unintended side effects on the cells. Specifically, it could be toxic or stressful, causing the cells to reduce the amount of MUC1 protein on their surface. If the amount of MUC1 protein decreases, the antibody will bind less, but this would be due to a lack of target, not because of successful competition. This would invalidate the intended conclusion.

    3.  **The Role of the Anti-Flag Antibody:** The MUC1 protein was built with a 'flag tag', which is a short, artificial peptide sequence. An anti-flag antibody binds to this tag. This binding is completely independent of the sugar modification (the TN antigen). Therefore, the anti-flag antibody serves as a perfect tool to measure the total amount of MUC1 protein present on the cell surface.

    4.  **The Experimental Logic:** By using the anti-flag antibody, we can measure the MUC1 surface levels in both the control (PBS) and the treatment (500 mM GalNAc) conditions.
        *   If the anti-flag signal is the same in both conditions, it confirms that MUC1 surface expression was not affected by the GalNAc. This validates that any decrease in the main antibody's signal is truly due to specific competition.
        *   If the anti-flag signal decreases in the GalNAc condition, the experiment is invalid.

    5.  **The Timing:** The anti-flag antibody binds directly to the MUC1 protein, making it a "primary" antibody. In any staining protocol, all primary antibodies are added together in the first step. Therefore, it should be added along with the main anti-MUC1 antibody.

    6.  **Conclusion:** The anti-flag antibody is essential. It must be added with the primary antibodies to verify that the high concentration of GalNAc has not caused a non-specific change in the surface expression of the MUC1 protein. This matches choice C perfectly.
