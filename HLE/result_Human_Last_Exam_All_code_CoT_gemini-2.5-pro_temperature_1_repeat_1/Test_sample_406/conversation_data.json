    "An FGH-tripled fixed point refers to a point `(x, y, z)` that remains unchanged after the application of three functions, F, G, and H, in a specific coupled manner.\n\n**1. Definition of an FGH-Tripled Fixed Point**\n\nGiven three sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z`, and three functions:\n*   `F: X * Y * Z → X`\n*   `G: Y * X * Y → Y`\n*   `H: Z * Y * X → Z`\n\nA triplet `(x, y, z)` where `x ∈ X`, `y ∈ Y`, `z ∈ Z` is called an FGH-tripled fixed point if it satisfies the following system of equations:\n*   `F(x, y, z) = x`\n*   `G(y, x, y) = y`\n*   `H(z, y, x) = z`\n\n**2. Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nThe existence and uniqueness of such a point are typically guaranteed under conditions derived from the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem. The core idea is to show that a combined operator `T` on the product space `M = X * Y * Z` is a contraction mapping.\n\nThe main conditions are:\n*   **(Complete Metric Spaces):** The sets `X`, `Y`, and `Z` must be complete metric spaces. This means they have a notion of distance, and every sequence of points that get progressively closer to each other (a Cauchy sequence) converges to a point within the set. The set of real numbers, `R`, or any closed interval `[a, b]` are examples of complete metric spaces.\n*   **(Contraction Mapping):** The functions `F`, `G`, and `H` must collectively satisfy a \"contraction\" condition. This ensures that when we iteratively apply the functions starting from any initial point, the resulting sequence of points will converge to a unique fixed point. A sufficient (though strict) condition is that the combined operator `T(x, y, z) = (F(x, y, z), G(y, x, y), H(z, y, x))` is a contraction on the product space.\n\n**Python Example**\n\nBelow is a Python script that illustrates these conditions. We will use the set of real numbers for `X`, `Y`, and `Z`. We'll define `F`, `G`, and `H` as simple linear functions designed to satisfy the contraction condition. The script then solves for the unique FGH-tripled fixed point and verifies that it satisfies the defining equations.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef find_and_verify_tripled_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines a system of functions (F, G, H) that satisfy\n    contraction conditions and finds their unique tripled fixed point (x, y, z).\n    It then verifies that F(x, y, z) = x, G(y, x, y) = y, and H(z, y, x) = z.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define linear functions F, G, H of the form:\n    # F(x, y, z) = c_x*x + c_y*y + c_z*z + k_f\n    # G(y, x, y) = c_y1*y + c_x*x + c_y2*y + k_g\n    # H(z, y, x) = c_z*z + c_y*y + c_x*x + k_h\n    #\n    # We choose coefficients that ensure the combined operator is a contraction.\n    # For F(x, y, z):\n    f_coeffs = {'x': 0.1, 'y': 0.1, 'z': 0.1, 'k': 1.0}\n    # For G(y, x, y):\n    g_coeffs = {'y1': 0.1, 'x': 0.1, 'y2': 0.1, 'k': 2.0}\n    # For H(z, y, x):\n    h_coeffs = {'z': 0.1, 'y': 0.1, 'x': 0.1, 'k': 3.0}\n\n    # The fixed point conditions lead to a system of linear equations A*sol = b.\n    # 1. x = f_coeffs['x']*x + f_coeffs['y']*y + f_coeffs['z']*z + f_coeffs['k']\n    #    => (1-f_coeffs['x'])*x - f_coeffs['y']*y - f_coeffs['z']*z = f_coeffs['k']\n    # 2. y = g_coeffs['y1']*y + g_coeffs['x']*x + g_coeffs['y2']*y + g_coeffs['k']\n    #    => -g_coeffs['x']*x + (1-g_coeffs['y1']-g_coeffs['y2'])*y = g_coeffs['k']\n    # 3. z = h_coeffs['z']*z + h_coeffs['y']*y + h_coeffs['x']*x + h_coeffs['k']\n    #    => -h_coeffs['x']*x - h_coeffs['y']*y + (1-h_coeffs['z'])*z = h_coeffs['k']\n\n    # Construct the matrix A\n    A = np.array([\n        [1 - f_coeffs['x'], -f_coeffs['y'], -f_coeffs['z']],\n        [-g_coeffs['x'], 1 - g_coeffs['y1'] - g_coeffs['y2'], 0],\n        [-h_coeffs['x'], -h_coeffs['y'], 1 - h_coeffs['z']]\n    ])\n\n    # Construct the vector b\n    b = np.array([f_coeffs['k'], g_coeffs['k'], h_coeffs['k']])\n\n    # Solve the system for the fixed point (x, y, z)\n    try:\n        fixed_point = np.linalg.solve(A, b)\n        x, y, z = fixed_point[0], fixed_point[1], fixed_point[2]\n\n        print(f\"The calculated FGH-tripled fixed point is (x, y, z) = ({x:.4f}, {y:.4f}, {z:.4f})\\n\")\n        print(\"--- Verification ---\")\n\n        # Verify F(x, y, z) = x\n        f_val = f_coeffs['x']*x + f_coeffs['y']*y + f_coeffs['z']*z + f_coeffs['k']\n        print(f\"F({x:.4f}, {y:.4f}, {z:.4f}) = {f_coeffs['x']}*{x:.4f} + {f_coeffs['y']}*{y:.4f} + {f_coeffs['z']}*{z:.4f} + {f_coeffs['k']} = {f_val:.4f}\")\n        print(f\"Is F(x, y, z) equal to x? {np.isclose(f_val, x)}.
