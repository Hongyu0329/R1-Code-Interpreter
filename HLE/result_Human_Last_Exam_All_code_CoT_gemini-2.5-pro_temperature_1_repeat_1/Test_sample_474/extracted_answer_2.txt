The approach is not fully valid. The ecological function of mimicry is to signal to predators, and human visual perception is not a reliable proxy for predator perception (e.g., birds can see UV light, which humans cannot). Therefore, clusters based on human ratings may not reflect the true, ecologically relevant mimicry rings.
