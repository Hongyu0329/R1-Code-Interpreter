    "This riddle is a fun word puzzle disguised as a haiku. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Haiku:** I will analyze each line of the haiku, including its title, to extract clues.\n2.  **Identify \"The Bays\":** The title, \"The Bays,\" sounds like \"The B's.\" I'll look for three words starting with the letter 'B', with each line of the haiku describing one of them. The poem has a recurring theme of wind.\n    *   **Line 1: \"An August tempest\"**: This points to a powerful wind or storm name starting with 'B'. I've identified \"Bayamo,\" a violent, cyclonic wind on the coast of Cuba.\n    *   **Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This line contains a calculation (`2 * 15 = 30`). It refers to the \"Beaufort\" scale, which measures wind force and is a perfect fit for the \"winds of change\" theme.\n    *   **Line 3: \"A divine one yields\"**: This suggests a mythological figure. \"Boreas,\" the Greek god of the cold north wind, fits both the \"divine\" clue and the overall wind theme.\n3.  **Alphabetize the Answer:** The prompt asks for the final answer to be in alphabetical order. I will sort the three 'B' words I found.\n4.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to demonstrate the solution. The script will show the calculation from the haiku, define the three words, sort them alphabetically, and print the final ordered list as the answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom io import StringIO\n\n# A helper function to capture the output of the main logic\ndef solve_riddle():\n    # Store the original stdout\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    # Redirect stdout to a string buffer\n    sys.stdout = captured_output = StringIO()\n\n    # --- Riddle Solving Logic ---\n\n    # The second line of the haiku is \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\".\n    # This implies a calculation.\n    num1 = 2\n    num2 = 15\n    result = num1 * num2\n\n    # The poem asks for \"The Bays\" (The B's), which are themed around wind.\n    # Line 1: \"An August tempest\" -> Bayamo (a violent wind in Cuba)\n    # Line 2: \"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\" -> Beaufort (the wind scale)\n    # Line 3: \"A divine one yields\" -> Boreas (Greek god of the North Wind)\n    bays = [\"Bayamo\", \"Beaufort\", \"Boreas\"]\n\n    # The final question asks for the answer in alphabetical order.\n    bays.sort()\n\n    # Print the equation from the haiku, showing each number.\n    print(f\"The equation from the haiku is: {num1} * {num2} = {result}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe three 'Bays' in alphabetical order are:\")\n\n    # Print the final alphabetized list.\n    for word in bays:\n        print(word)\n\n    # --- End of Logic ---\n\n    # Restore original stdout\n    sys.stdout = original_stdout\n    # Return the captured output as a string\n    return captured_output.getvalue()\n\n# Execute the function and print its captured output\nprint(solve_riddle())\n\n```\n<<<Bayamo, Beaufort, Boreas>>>"
