def solve_minimum_prototypes():
    """
    This script determines and prints the minimum number of prototypes
    required to guarantee correct classification for C class centroids.

    The problem states we have:
    - C: The number of disjoint classes.
    - A set of prototypes with soft labels.
    - A distance-weighted soft-label kNN classifier.

    The goal is to find the minimum number of prototypes to GUARANTEE that
    each of the C class centroids is classified correctly.

    The logical derivation is as follows:
    1.  A lower bound is established by considering a k=1 classifier. To distinguish
        C centroids, each must have a unique nearest prototype whose label points
        to the correct class. This requires at least C prototypes.
    2.  An upper bound is established by construction. Placing one 'pure' prototype
        at each of the C centroids is sufficient to guarantee classification for
        any k, due to the nature of the distance-weighted averaging.
    3.  Since the lower bound and upper bound are both C, the minimum number is C.

    The final equation is: Minimum Prototypes = C.
