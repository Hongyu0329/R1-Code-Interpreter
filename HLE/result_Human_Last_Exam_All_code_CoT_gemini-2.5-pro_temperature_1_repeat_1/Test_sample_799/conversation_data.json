    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating question that lies at the intersection of fractal geometry and number theory. Answering it requires citing established mathematical theorems rather than performing a direct calculation.\n\nHere is my plan to arrive at the solution:\n1.  First, I will clearly define what a \"Sidon set\" means in the context of real numbers in the interval [0, 1].\n2.  Next, I will consult key results from the mathematical field of harmonic analysis concerning the properties of these sets.\n3.  Specifically, I will reference two important theorems that bound the possible Hausdorff dimension of such sets. One theorem provides a lower bound on what is possible, and the other provides a strict upper bound.\n4.  By combining these theorems, I will determine the precise range of possible values for the Hausdorff dimension.\n5.  Finally, based on this range, I will determine the \"maximum\" value, clarifying the distinction between a maximum and a supremum, and provide the definitive answer in the requested Python code format.\n\n```python\ndef find_max_hausdorff_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and provides the maximum Hausdorff dimension\n    of a Sidon set in the real numbers between 0 and 1.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Defining a Sidon Set in [0, 1]\")\n    print(\"A set of real numbers S is called a Sidon set if all its pairwise sums are unique.\")\n    print(\"Formally, for any four elements a, b, c, d in S, the equation a + b = c + d\")\n    print(\"implies that the unordered pair {a, b} is identical to the unordered pair {c, d}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Citing Key Mathematical Results\")\n    print(\"This question is answered by established theorems in mathematics:\")\n    print(\"  - Theorem 1 (S.
