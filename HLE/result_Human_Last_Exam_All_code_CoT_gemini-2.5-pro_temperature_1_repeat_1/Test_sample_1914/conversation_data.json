    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of non-isomorphic categories with two objects (let's call them A and B) and a total of four morphisms.\n\nFirst, any category with two objects must contain two identity morphisms, `id_A` for object A and `id_B` for object B. This leaves us with two additional non-identity morphisms to distribute. Let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\nThe morphisms in a category are partitioned into sets `Hom(X, Y)` for every pair of objects X and Y. In our case, we have four such sets: `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)`.\n\nThe two non-identity morphisms `f` and `g` must be placed into these four sets. Let `n_AA`, `n_AB`, `n_BA`, `n_BB` be the number of non-identity morphisms in `Hom(A, A)`, `Hom(A, B)`, `Hom(B, A)`, and `Hom(B, B)` respectively. We must have:\n`n_AA + n_AB + n_BA + n_BB = 2`\n\nWe can systematically enumerate the integer solutions to this equation and, for each solution, determine the number of distinct, valid category structures (up to isomorphism). An isomorphism can swap the roles of objects A and B, so we only need to consider solutions that are unique up to this swapping.\n\nThe main cases for the distribution of the two non-identity morphisms are:\n1.  Both morphisms are in the same Hom-set (e.g., both in `Hom(A, A)`).\n2.  The two morphisms are in different Hom-sets (e.g., one in `Hom(A, A)` and one in `Hom(A, B)`).\n\nI will now provide a Python script that walks through each case, explains the reasoning for the number of categories found, and calculates the total sum.\n\n```python\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # We classify the categories based on the distribution of the two non-identity morphisms.\n    # Let the objects be A and B.
