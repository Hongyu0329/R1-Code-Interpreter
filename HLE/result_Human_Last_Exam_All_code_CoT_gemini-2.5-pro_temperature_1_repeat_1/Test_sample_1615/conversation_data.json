    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the question:** The problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring of a graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, given that $G$ is not a complete graph. This is equivalent to finding the maximum possible chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, for such a graph.\n\n2.  **Recall basic graph theory principles:**\n    *   The chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices is always less than or equal to the number of vertices, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n    *   The equality $\\chi(G) = n$ holds if and only if the graph $G$ is a complete graph ($K_n$), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\n\n3.  **Apply the given constraints:**\n    *   The problem states that the graph $G$ is *not* a complete graph.\n    *   Therefore, its chromatic number must be strictly less than the number of vertices: $\\chi(G) < n$. This implies $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n4.  **Determine the maximum value:** We have established an upper bound of $n-1$ for the chromatic number. To show that this is the maximum possible value, we need to demonstrate that there exists a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices which is not complete and has $\\chi(G) = n-1$.\n\n5.  **Construct an example graph:** Consider a graph $G$ constructed as follows:\n    *   Take a complete graph on $n-1$ vertices, which is $K_{n-1}$. The chromatic number of this component is $n-1$.\n    *   Add one more vertex to the graph but do not connect it to any of the other vertices (an isolated vertex).\n    *   The resulting graph $G$ has $(n-1) + 1 = n$ vertices.\n    *   This graph $G$ is not a complete graph because the isolated vertex is not connected to the other $n-1$ vertices.\n    *   The chromatic number of this disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its components. In this case, $\\chi(G) = \\chi(K_{n-1}) = n-1$.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have shown that for any non-complete graph with $n$ vertices, $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$, and that this bound is achievable. Thus, the maximum number of colors needed is $n-1$.\n\n7.  **Calculation:** For $n=12345$, the maximum number of colors is $12345 - 1 = 12344$. I will now provide a Python script to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex coloring\n    of a graph with n vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # A fundamental theorem in graph theory states that the chromatic number chi(G) of a graph G\n    # with n vertices is n if and only if G is a complete graph (K_n).\n    # If G is not a complete graph, its chromatic number must be less than n.\n    # So, the maximum possible chromatic number is n - 1.\n    \n    # We can construct a graph that achieves this maximum: a complete graph on n-1 vertices (K_{n-1})\n    # plus one isolated vertex. This graph has n vertices, is not complete, and its chromatic number is n-1.\n\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of colors required is n - 1.\n    max_colors = n - 1\n\n    print(f\"The number of vertices in the graph is n = {n}.\")\n    print(\"Since the graph is not a complete graph, the maximum number of colors needed for a proper coloring is n - 1.\")\n    print(\"The final calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} - 1 = {max_colors}\")\n\nsolve_coloring_problem()\n```\n<<<12344>>>"
