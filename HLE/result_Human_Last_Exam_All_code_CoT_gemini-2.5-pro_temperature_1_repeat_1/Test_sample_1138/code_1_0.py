    print("\n[B] For ECDSA: Given m, sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can recover the secret key sk with no more than negligible probability.")
    print("--> TRUE. This is a statement about key security. Forging a signature is considered a 'weaker' attack than recovering the secret key. It's a fundamental concept that a scheme can have a forgery vulnerability while the key itself remains secure (computationally hard to find).")

    print("\n[C] For some existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given m, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can generate sig' that (sig', m) is verifiable against pk with non-negligible probability.")
    print("--> TRUE. This is true by definition. The set of 'existentially forgeable schemes' must contain schemes that are, in fact, forgeable. The scenario described is a type of forgery, and schemes vulnerable to it (like textbook RSA) do exist.")

    print("\n[D] For all existentially forgeable digital signature schemes: Only given sig, pk, a computationally bounded adversary can figure out m with no more than negligible probability.")
    print("--> FALSE. The 'for all' claim is too strong. It is easy to imagine a forgeable scheme where the message is not hidden by the signature. Also, for schemes like ECDSA, the message is not recovered from the signature in the first place.")
