    "This sequence is a list of Zumkeller numbers, which are numbers `n` such that the set of their divisors can be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums. This is only possible if the sum of all divisors, `sigma(n)`, is an even number. The problem then becomes finding a subset of divisors that sums to exactly `sigma(n) / 2`.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Verify the pattern by checking if the numbers in the sequence are indeed Zumkeller numbers.\n2.  Write a helper function to find all divisors of a given integer `n`.\n3.  Write a function to solve the \"subset sum\" problem. This function will take the list of divisors and the target sum (`sigma(n) / 2`) and determine if such a subset exists. I will use a dynamic programming approach for this, as it's efficient for this type of problem.\n4.  Create a main function `is_zumkeller(n)` that combines the above steps to check if a number is a Zumkeller number.\n5.  Start a loop from `2352 + 1` and test each subsequent integer using the `is_zumkeller` function.\n6.  The first number that tests true is the next number in the sequence.\n7.  Finally, print the explanation and the required equation showing how the next number is found.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of all divisors of a number n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return list(divs)\n\ndef solve_subset_sum(numbers, target_sum):\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the subset sum problem using dynamic programming.\n    Returns True if a subset of 'numbers' sums to 'target_sum', False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    dp = {0}\n    for num in numbers:\n        dp.update({x + num for x in dp})\n        if target_sum in dp:\n            return True\n    return target_sum in dp\n\ndef is_zumkeller(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a number n is a Zumkeller number.\n    A number n is a Zumkeller number if its divisors can be partitioned\n    into two sets with equal sums.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return False\n        \n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    sigma_n = sum(divisors)\n    \n    # The sum of divisors must be even to be split into two equal integer sums.\n    if sigma_n % 2 != 0:\n        return False\n        \n    target = sigma_n // 2\n    \n    return solve_subset_sum(divisors, target)\n\ndef find_next_number_in_sequence():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints the next number in the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    last_number = 2352\n    \n    print(\"The pattern in the sequence is that each number is a 'Zumkeller number'.\")\n    print(\"A Zumkeller number is a number whose divisors can be partitioned into two sets with equal sums.\")\n    print(f\"The last number given is {last_number}.
