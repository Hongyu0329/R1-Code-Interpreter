    # Step 1 & 2: Define the space X and the point a.
    # The space X is a union of a line segment on the x-axis and four "pi-shaped" sets (P)
    # in planes perpendicular to the x-axis at x=0, 1/4, 1/2, and 1.
    # The point a = (0, 1, 0) is part of the pi-shaped set at x=0.
    #
    # Let's analyze the local structure at a = (0, 1, 0).
    # The set P is defined in the yz-plane (using its own coordinates) as the union of:
    # - [0,1] x {0}  (a segment on the y-axis from y=0 to y=1)
    # - {1/3} x [0,1] (a vertical segment at y=1/3)
    # - {2/3} x [0,1] (a vertical segment at y=2/3)
    # - [1/3,2/3] x {1} (a horizontal segment connecting the tops of the vertical segments)
    #
    # The copy of P at x=0 is {0} x P. The point a = (0, 1, 0) corresponds to the point
    # (y,z) = (1,0) in P's coordinates. This is an endpoint of the base segment [0,1] x {0}.
    # In the full space X, the point 'a' is connected to the rest of the structure only through
    # the segment { (0, y, 0) | 0 <= y <= 1 }. It is an endpoint of the entire X structure.

    print("Analyzing the space X and the point a = (0, 1, 0):")
    print("The point 'a' is an endpoint of the entire structure X. The space is locally a simple line segment at 'a'.")

    # Step 3 & 4: Analyze the intersection of all compact connected neighborhoods of 'a'.
    # This intersection is determined by the local topology at 'a'.
    # We check if the space X is "locally connected" at 'a'. A space is locally
    # connected at a point if every neighborhood of the point contains a smaller, connected neighborhood.
    #
    # A small neighborhood around 'a' in X is created by intersecting an open ball B(a, r) with X.
    # For a small radius r > 0, this intersection is: B(a, r) n X = { (0, y, 0) | 1-r < y <= 1 }.
    # This is a half-open line segment, which is a connected set.
    # Since any neighborhood of 'a' contains such a connected neighborhood, X is locally connected at 'a'.

    print("Checking for local connectivity at 'a':")
    print("The space X is locally connected at point 'a'.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Step 5: Determine the intersection set S.
    # For a locally connected space, the intersection of all connected neighborhoods of a point 'x'
    # is just the singleton set {x}. We can extend this to compact connected neighborhoods.
    # For any point p != a, we can find a small compact connected neighborhood of 'a' that does not contain 'p'.
    # For example, let d = distance(a, p). The set K = { (0, y, 0) | 1 - d/2 <= y <= 1 } is a
    # compact, connected neighborhood of 'a' that excludes 'p'.
    # Therefore, the intersection of ALL such neighborhoods can only be {a}.

    print("Determining the intersection set S:")
    intersection_set_description = "{a} = {(0, 1, 0)}"
    print(f"The intersection of all compact connected neighborhoods of 'a' is the singleton set S = {intersection_set_description}.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # Step 6: Count the components of S.
    # The set S = {(0, 1, 0)} contains only a single point.
    # A set with one point is connected by definition.
    # Therefore, it has exactly one connected component.

    print("Counting the components of S:")
    number_of_components = 1
    print(f"The set S has {number_of_components} component.")
    print("-" * 20)
    
    # Final Result
    print(f"The final equation can be seen as: Number of components = {number_of_components}")
