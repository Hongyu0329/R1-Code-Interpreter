    "The user wants to find the Alon-Tarsi number of the complete bipartite graph $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Graph:** The graph is $K_{1000,1000}$, which is a complete bipartite graph of the form $K_{n,n}$ with $n=1000$.\n2.  **Recall the Definition:** The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph $G$, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there is an orientation $D$ of the edges of $G$ such that the maximum out-degree of any vertex is less than $k$, and the number of even Eulerian subgraphs is not equal to the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs.\n3.  **State the Relevant Theorem:** For a complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, there is a known result that its Alon-Tarsi number is given by the formula $AT(K_{n,n}) = n + 1$.\n    *   This result follows from two facts:\n        *   The choice number (or list-chromatic number) of $K_{n,n}$ is $n$.\n        *   The choice number is a lower bound for the Alon-Tarsi number ($ch(G) \\le AT(G)$), so $AT(K_{n,n}) \\ge n$.\n        *   It can be shown that there is an orientation of $K_{n,n}$ with maximum out-degree $n$ that satisfies the Alon-Tarsi condition, which establishes an upper bound $AT(K_{n,n}) \\le n+1$.\n        *   It can also be shown that no orientation with maximum out-degree less than $n$ satisfies the condition.\n    *   Combining these, the value is exactly $n+1$.\n4.  **Apply the Formula:** Substitute $n=1000$ into the formula to calculate the result.\n5.  **Generate Code:** Write a simple Python script to perform this calculation and print the steps as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Alon-Tarsi number for the complete bipartite graph K_1000,1000.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The graph is K_n,n, where n is 1000.\n    n = 1000\n\n    # The Alon-Tarsi number for a complete bipartite graph K_n,n is given by the formula: AT(K_n,n) = n + 1.\n    # We will apply this formula to find the answer.\n    \n    # Calculate the result\n    result = n + 1\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation.\n    print(f\"The Alon-Tarsi number for a complete bipartite graph K_n,n is n + 1.\")\n    print(f\"For the graph K_{n},{n} with n = {n}, the calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"{n} + 1 = {result}\")\n\nsolve_alon_tarsi_k1000_1000()\n```\n<<<1001>>>"
