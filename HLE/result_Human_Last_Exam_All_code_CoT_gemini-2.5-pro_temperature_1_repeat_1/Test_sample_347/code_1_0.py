    This function identifies the example not used by Elizabeth Ellsworth in her book
    "Places of Learning" from the provided list.

    Elizabeth Ellsworth's case studies in "Places of Learning" focus on specific sites
    and performances that reconfigure boundaries. These include:
    - U. S. Holocaust Museum (B)
    - Anna Deveare Smith's performances (C)
    - Jane Addams Hull-House Museum (D)
    - Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Education Center (Regenstein Hall of Music) (E)
    - Manhattan Children's Museum's Art Inside Out (F)
