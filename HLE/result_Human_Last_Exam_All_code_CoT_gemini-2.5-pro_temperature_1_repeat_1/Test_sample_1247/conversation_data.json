    "An elegant explanation of your method formatted nicely BEFORE the code block that contains the final answer.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the properties of permutations with a small number of inversions. A permutation has \\(k\\) inversions if it can be obtained from the identity permutation by exactly \\(k\\) adjacent transpositions (but not fewer). For \\(k=3\\), the number of such permutations is large, but we are restricted to those that avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) contains the pattern 1324 if there exist indices \\(a < b < c < d\\) such that \\(\\pi_a < \\pi_c < \\pi_b < \\pi_d\\). The key features of such a pattern are the inversion between \\(\\pi_b\\) and \\(\\pi_c\\) (\\(\\pi_c < \\pi_b\\)) and the elements \\(\\pi_a\\) and \\(\\pi_d\\) that \"bracket\" this inversion.\n\nOur strategy is to classify all permutations with 3 inversions and then check which ones avoid the 1324 pattern. The number of inversions is small compared to the length of the permutation (\\(n=333\\)). This suggests that any such permutation must be a \"local\" disturbance of the identity permutation. If the elements that are not in their natural sorted position (the support of the permutation) are in the \"middle\" of the sequence, we can likely find elements before and after the support to form a 1324 pattern. This leads to the hypothesis that only permutations whose support is a single contiguous block at the beginning or the end of the sequence can avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\nPermutations with 3 inversions can be categorized into four main types based on their structure. We will analyze each type for 1324-avoidance, assuming \\(n\\) is large (like \\(n=333\\)).\n\n1.  **Type A**: Reversing a block of three consecutive elements. These are of the form \\((1, ..., i-1, i+2, i+1, i, i+3, ..., n)\\). There are \\(n-2\\) such permutations.\n    - If this block is in the middle (i.e., \\(1 < i < n-2\\)), a 1324 pattern can be formed.\n    - Only when the block is at the beginning (\\(i=1\\)), giving \\((3, 2, 1, 4, ...)\\), or at the end (\\(i=n-2\\)), giving \\((..., n, n-1, n-2)\\), does the permutation avoid 1324. This gives us **2** avoiding permutations.\n\n2.  **Type B**: Three disjoint adjacent swaps. These permutations have their support scattered, which makes it easy to form a 1324 pattern. All such permutations contain the 1324 pattern. This gives **0** avoiding permutations.\n\n3.  **Type D**: A 4-cycle of the form \\((1, ..., i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3, i, i+4, ..., n)\\).\n    - Similar to Type A, if the support \\(\\{i, i+1, i+2, i+3\\}\\) is in the middle, a 1324 pattern is present.\n    - Only when the support is at the beginning (\\(i=1\\)), giving \\((2, 3, 4, 1, 5, ...)\\), or at the end (the reverse-complement, which corresponds to \\(i=n-3\\)), does it avoid 1324. This gives **2** avoiding permutations.\n\n4.  **Type C**: One adjacent swap disjoint from a 2-inversion block.\n    - If the two disjoint blocks of activity are not at the ends of the permutation, a 1324 pattern can be constructed.\n    - The only cases that avoid 1324 are when one block is at the beginning and the other is at the end. For \\(k=3\\), this means an adjacent swap at one end and a 2-inversion block at the other. There are two types of 2-inversion blocks. This gives 2 (swap at start, block at end) + 2 (block at start, swap at end) = **4** avoiding permutations.\n\nSumming these up, for any \\(n \\ge 5\\), the number of 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions is constant: \\(2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 8\\). Since \\(n=333\\) is large enough, the answer is 8.\n\nThe following Python code programmatically constructs these 8 permutations for \\(n=333\\), verifies they each have 3 inversions and are 1324-avoiding, and prints the final count.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_inversions(perm):\n    \"\"\"Counts the number of inversions in a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inv_count = 0\n    n = len(perm)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if perm[i] > perm[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n\ndef avoids_1324(perm):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a permutation avoids the 1324 pattern.\"\"\"\n    n = len(perm)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            for k in range(j + 1, n):\n                for l in range(k + 1, n):\n                    if perm[i] < perm[k] and perm[k] < perm[j] and perm[j] < perm[l]:\n                        return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_avoiding_perms_with_3_inversions(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Constructs the set of 1324-avoiding permutations of length n with 3 inversions.\n    For n >= 5, this number is constant.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n < 4:\n        # The classification assumes n is large enough for all types to exist and be distinct.\n        # For n=3, there is 1: (3,2,1).
