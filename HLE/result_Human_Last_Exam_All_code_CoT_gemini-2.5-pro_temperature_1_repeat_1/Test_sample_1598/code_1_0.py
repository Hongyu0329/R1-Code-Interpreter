    Determines the global labeling number of the graph K_{1,100}.

    The graph K_{1,100} has a central vertex connected to 100 leaf vertices. Let the set of 100 edge labels be W.
    The global labeling condition simplifies to: for any label w in W, w cannot be the sum of any subset of the other labels in W.

    A sufficient condition to satisfy this is that the sum of the two smallest labels is greater than the largest label.
    To find the minimum possible maximum label (the global labeling number k), we try to construct a set of labels that are packed as closely as possible, for instance, as a block of consecutive integers.

    Let W = {m, m+1, ..., m+n-1}, where n=100.
    The maximum label is k = m + n - 1.
    The sum of the two smallest labels is m + (m+1) = 2m + 1.

    The condition is:
    m + n - 1 < 2m + 1
    n - 2 < m

    To minimize k, we must choose the smallest possible integer m.
