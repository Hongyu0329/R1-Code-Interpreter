    "To determine the number of peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze the molecule's structure and identify all the chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Overall Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring. The substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5 are identical. This arrangement results in a C3 axis of rotational symmetry. This symmetry means that the three large substituent \"arms\" are chemically equivalent, and the three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are also equivalent.\n\n2.  **Central Ring Protons:**\n    *   **Methyl Groups (at C2, C4, C6):** The three methyl groups on the central benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. All 9 of these protons will give rise to a single signal.\n    *   *Number of signals so far: 1*\n\n3.  **Methylene Linker Protons (-CH2-):**\n    *   There are three `-CH2-` groups linking the central ring to the chiral substituents. Due to the C3 symmetry, these three groups are equivalent.\n    *   However, each `-CH2-` group is attached to a chiral center (the entire complex substituent). This makes the two protons on each methylene group diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, these protons will produce two distinct signals.\n    *   *Number of signals so far: 1 (ring methyls) + 2 (linker protons) = 3*\n\n4.  **Chiral Substituent Protons:**\n    *   We only need to analyze one of the three identical `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)` groups, as they are all equivalent.\n    *   This group is a rigid, chiral, bicyclic system derived from camphor. Within this single asymmetric unit, all protons are in unique chemical environments.\n    *   Let's count the distinct proton environments in one substituent:\n        *   **H3 proton:** 1 signal from the proton on the indazole ring.\n        *   **H4 proton:** 1 signal from the bridgehead proton.\n        *   **C5-CH2 protons:** 2 signals from the two diastereotopic protons of this methylene group.\n        *   **C6-CH2 protons:** 2 signals from the two diastereotopic protons of this methylene group.\n        *   **Methyl groups:** There are three methyl groups on the bicyclic frame. Due to the rigid and asymmetric nature of the structure, all three are in different chemical environments and will produce three distinct signals.\n    *   Total signals from one substituent = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9 signals.\n\n5.  **Total Number of Peaks:**\n    *   We sum the number of signals from each unique part of the molecule.\n    *   Total Signals = (signals from central ring methyls) + (signals from linker protons) + (signals from one chiral substituent)\n    *   Total Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints this result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_nmr_peaks():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of expected 1H NMR peaks for the given molecule based on its symmetry.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
