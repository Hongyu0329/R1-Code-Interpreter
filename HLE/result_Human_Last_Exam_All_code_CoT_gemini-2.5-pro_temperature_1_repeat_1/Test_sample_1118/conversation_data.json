    "Of course, I can help with that. My plan is to use a Python script to find and display the answer to your question about Curt Querner's painting. The script will store the answer in a variable and then print it out in a full sentence.\n\n```python\ndef find_symbol_in_painting():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the object held by Curt Querner\n    in his 1933 self-portrait as a symbol of resistance.\n    \"\"\"\n    artist = \"Curt Querner\"\n    year = 1933\n    event = \"escaped from Gestapo\"\n    symbol = \"a nettle plant\"\n\n    print(f\"In his {year} self-portrait, painted after he {event}, {artist} holds {symbol} as a symbol of resistance.\")\n\nfind_symbol_in_painting()\n```\n<<<a nettle plant>>>"
