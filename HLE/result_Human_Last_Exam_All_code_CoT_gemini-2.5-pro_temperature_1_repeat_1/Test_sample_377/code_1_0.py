    This script calculates the number of conjugacy classes of the extraspecial group S of order 27 and exponent 3, denoted 3^{1+2}_+.
    This number corresponds to the number of blocks of the group algebra kG as explained in the reasoning.

    The group S can be presented as <x, y, z | x^3=y^3=z^3=1, [x,y]=z, [x,z]=1, [y,z]=1>.
    We represent group elements as tuples (a, b, c) for x^a * y^b * z^c, where a, b, c are in {0, 1, 2}.
