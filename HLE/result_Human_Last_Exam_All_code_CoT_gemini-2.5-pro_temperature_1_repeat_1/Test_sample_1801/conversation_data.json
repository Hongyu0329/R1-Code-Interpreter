    "Of course. I will provide a Python script to print the names of the two Nobel laureates.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will create two variables to store the names of the Nobel laureates.\n2.  I will then use the `print()` function to display these names as the answer to your question.\n\n```python\n# The two Nobel laureates in question are Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes.\n# This script will store their names in variables and print them.\n\nlaureate_one = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate_two = \"Myron Scholes\"\n\nprint(\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were:\")\nprint(f\"1. {laureate_one}\")\nprint(f\"2. {laureate_two}\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
