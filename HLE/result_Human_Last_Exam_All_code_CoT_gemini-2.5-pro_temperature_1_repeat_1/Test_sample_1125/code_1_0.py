The strategy that guarantees the maximum number of people (N) know their hat number is as follows:

1.  **Designate Roles:** The team designates two members as "Accountants" (e.g., Kyle and Liam). The other 10 members are "Workers". The goal is for the 10 Workers to determine their numbers.

2.  **The Pairings (20 in total):**
    a. Each of the 10 Workers pairs up with the first Accountant, Kyle. This results in 10 revealed numbers.
    b. Each of the 10 Workers pairs up with the second Accountant, Liam. This results in another 10 revealed numbers.

3.  **The Information:** Each Worker `i` ends up with a pair of revealed numbers, `(r_i, s_i)`.
    - `r_i` came from the pairing with Kyle, so `Hat(Worker_i) = r_i` or `Hat(Kyle) = r_i`.
    - `s_i` came from the pairing with Liam, so `Hat(Worker_i) = s_i` or `Hat(Liam) = s_i`.

4.  **The Collective Deduction:**
    - Any individual Worker cannot be sure of their number from their pair `(r_i, s_i)` alone.
    - However, the entire team discusses the full list of 10 pairs. There is only one possible assignment of numbers to the two Accountants, `Hat(Kyle)` and `Hat(Liam)`, that is consistent with all 10 pairs of revelations without causing a contradiction (i.e., requiring two Workers to have the same hat number).
    - Once the group identifies the two numbers held by the Accountants, this information is announced.

5.  **Final Resolution:**
    - With the Accountants' numbers known, each of the 10 Workers can look at their personal pair `(r_i, s_i)` and unambiguously determine their own hat number.
    - The two Accountants, however, will only know which two numbers they have between them, but cannot tell who has which.

This strategy guarantees that exactly 10 people will determine their number correctly.
