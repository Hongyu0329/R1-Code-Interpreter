The equivalence relation is A ~ B iff A is homeomorphic to a subset of B and B is homeomorphic to a subset of A.
The set of all subsets of the rational numbers is partitioned into the following categories of equivalence classes:

1. The Empty Set:
   The empty set is only equivalent to itself.
   Number of classes: 1

2. Non-empty Finite Sets:
   Two finite sets A and B are equivalent if and only if they have the same number of elements.
   This gives one equivalence class for each positive integer n.
   Number of classes: {}

3. Infinite Sets with a Perfect Part (homeomorphic to Q):
   All subsets of Q that contain a dense-in-itself subset are equivalent to Q itself.
   This forms a single, large equivalence class.
   Number of classes: 1

4. Infinite Scattered Sets:
   These are infinite sets with no perfect part. Descriptive set theory shows that
   the structure of these spaces under mutual embeddability is very complex.
   Number of classes: {}

The total number is the sum of the counts from these categories.
