    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval $[0, 4]$. The function is defined differently on the intervals $[0, 3]$ and $[3, 5]$. Therefore, we must split the integral into two parts:\n\n1.  An integral from $x=0$ to $x=3$ using the first definition of $p(x)$.\n2.  An integral from $x=3$ to $x=4$ using the second definition of $p(x)$.\n\nThe total integral is the sum of these two parts:\n$\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)} dx$\n\nHere's the plan:\n1.  **Calculate the first integral:** $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx$. This can be solved analytically.\n    $\\int \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = \\frac{x^4}{16}$.\n    So, $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{x^3}{4} dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^4}{16} \\right]_{0}^{3} = \\frac{3^4}{16} - 0 = \\frac{81}{16}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the second integral:** $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)} dx$. This integral can be simplified. The term $\\frac{1+\\sin x}{1+\\cos x}$ can be rewritten using trigonometric identities to be $\\tan(x/2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sec^2(x/2)$. The integral is of the special form $\\int e^x(f(x) + f'(x)) dx = e^x f(x)$, where $f(x) = \\tan(x/2)$.\n    So, the integral evaluates to $\\left[ e^x \\tan(x/2) \\right]_{3}^{4} = e^4 \\tan(2) - e^3 \\tan(1.5)$.\n\n3.  **Sum the results:** The final answer is the sum of the results from step 1 and step 2.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the final numerical value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# The integral of the function p(x) from x = 0 to x = 4 is split into two parts\n# because the function definition changes at x = 3.\n\n# Part 1: Integral from x = 0 to x = 3\n# For 0 <= x <= 3, p(x) = (2*x^3)/8 = x^3/4.\n# The definite integral is a_1 = integral(x^3/4)dx from 0 to 3.\n# The antiderivative is x^4/16.\n# Evaluating at the limits: (3^4)/16 - (0^4)/16 = 81/16.\nintegral_part1 = 81.0 / 16.0\n\n# Part 2: Integral from x = 3 to x = 4\n# For 3 <= x <= 5, p(x) = e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x)).\n# The integral can be shown to have a simple analytical form:\n# integral(e^x * (f(x) + f'(x)))dx = e^x * f(x)\n# In our case, f(x) = tan(x/2).\n# So the definite integral is a_2 = [e^x * tan(x/2)] from 3 to 4.\n# This evaluates to e^4*tan(2) - e^3*tan(1.5).\n# Note: numpy's trig functions use radians, which is correct for this calculation.\nintegral_part2 = np.exp(4) * np.tan(2) - np.exp(3) * np.tan(1.5)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts.\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the equation with the calculated values for each part.\nprint(f\"The total integral is the sum of the integral from 0 to 3 and the integral from 3 to 4.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {integral_part1} + ({integral_part2}) = {total_integral}\")\nprint(f\"The integral in the range x = 0 to x = 4 is: {total_integral}\")\n```\n<<<-397.4617750331442>>>"
