# The user is asking to identify a specific additional scene in the restored version of "Kriemhild's Revenge".
# The provided Le Monde article describes this scene.
# The article states that in the restored ending, King Etzel picks up Kriemhild's crown and orders it to be taken to Siegfried's coffin.
#
# Let's evaluate the options:
# A. A shot of Hildebrand bringing Kriemhild's crown to Etzel. - This is the only option that mentions the key symbolic objects of the restored scene: the crown and King Etzel. It is the correct answer.
# B. A shot of Etzel watching the sunset, mired in sorrow. - Incorrect.
# C. A shot of Hildebrand striking Kriemhild down with his spear. - This scene was in the original cut, it is not the additional restored scene in question.
# D. A shot of Etzel lifts his infant son amidst the carnage. - Incorrect, his son was killed earlier.
# E. A shot of Etzel calling for help, lamenting. - Too generic, misses the specific action with the crown.
# F. A shot of Kriemhild placing Siegfried's sword on her lap in the shadowy hall. - Incorrect, this happens earlier.
#
# Based on the analysis, option A is the correct answer.
