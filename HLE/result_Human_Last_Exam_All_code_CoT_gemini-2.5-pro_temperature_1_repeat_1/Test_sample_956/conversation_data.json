    "My plan to solve this problem involves these steps:\n1.  First, I'll represent the group G using a computational algebra library in Python. The elements of the set $\\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z \\}$ will be mapped to integers from 0 to 11 to facilitate computation.\n2.  I will then define the three given generators, $a, b, c$, as permutation objects.\n3.  Using these generators, I'll construct the group $G$ and determine its structure. Specifically, I'll compute its order and check if it's a simple group. These properties will allow me to identify $G$ up to isomorphism.\n4.  Based on the identification of $G$, I will state its Schur multiplier, $A$. This step relies on known theorems from group theory.\n5.  Finally, I will analyze the structure of the Schur multiplier $A$ to count its proper subgroups up to isomorphism. A proper subgroup of $A$ is any subgroup strictly smaller than $A$.\n\nThe Python code below will carry out the computational part of this plan (steps 1-3) and print the reasoning for the subsequent steps.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom sympy.combinatorics import Permutation, PermutationGroup\n\ndef solve_group_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by identifying the group G,\n    finding its Schur multiplier A, and then counting the proper subgroups of A.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the group G from its generators.\n    # The set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, x, y, z}.\n    # We map these to {0, 1, ..., 11} for easier computation.\n    # Mapping: 1->0, 2->1, 3->2, 4->3, 5->4, 6->5, 7->6, 8->7, 9->8, x->9, y->10, z->11\n\n    # The generators are given in cycle notation.
