    "I will identify the historical battle that represents Ming General Mu Sheng's first significant defeat in Vietnam and then determine the modern-day Vietnamese province where this battle took place.\n\n1.  **Identify the Event**: The event in question is the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass (ải Khả Lưu), which occurred in early 1427 during the Lam Sơn Uprising.\n2.  **Historical Context**: Mu Sheng was leading a Ming army from Yunnan to suppress the rebellion led by Lê Lợi. He was intercepted by Vietnamese forces under generals Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả.\n3.  **The Defeat**: At Khả Lưu Pass, Mu Sheng's army was decisively defeated, forcing him to retreat and await reinforcements. This was his first major personal defeat during this conflict.\n4.  **Geographical Location**: Historical records place Khả Lưu Pass in the western region of what is now Nghệ An Province.\n\nThe following Python code will print the name of this province.\n\n```python\ndef find_province_of_defeat():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the current Vietnamese province\n    where Ming General Mu Sheng suffered his first major defeat.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The historical event is the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass in 1427.\n    # Mu Sheng (Mộc Thạnh in Vietnamese) was defeated by Vietnamese forces\n    # led by Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả.\n    # This battle site is located in the territory of modern-day Nghệ An Province.\n    province = \"Nghệ An\"\n\n    print(f\"Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat occurred at the Battle of Khả Lưu Pass.\")\n    print(f\"This location is in the modern-day Vietnamese province of: {province}\")\n\nfind_province_of_defeat()\n```\n<<<Nghệ An>>>"
