The pharmacist should counsel Allison on two main points. First, there is an increased risk of bleeding when taking Excedrin (which contains aspirin, an NSAID) with her Fluoxetine 20mg (an SSRI); she should consider an alternative pain reliever in the future. Second, because she is taking Junel Fe 1.5/30mg (an oral contraceptive), she should discuss her new headaches with her doctor to ensure it's still a safe option for her.
