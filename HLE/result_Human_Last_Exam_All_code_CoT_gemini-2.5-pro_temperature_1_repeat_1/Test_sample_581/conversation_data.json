    "The problem asks for the best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8. A cap set is a collection of points in a vector space over the finite field of 3 elements, $(\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z})^n$, such that no three points lie on a line.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  First, I will explain a common method for constructing lower bounds for cap set sizes, known as the product construction. This method states that the size of a cap set in dimension $n_1 + n_2$ is at least the product of the sizes of cap sets in dimensions $n_1$ and $n_2$.\n2.  I will use known exact sizes for smaller dimensions (e.g., dimension 6 and dimension 2) to calculate a lower bound for dimension 8 using this product construction.\n3.  The Python code will perform this calculation and print the resulting equation.\n4.  Finally, I will state that while this construction gives a good bound, the current best-known bound was found using more advanced methods, and I will provide that value.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cap_set_bound():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates a lower bound for the size of a cap set\n    in dimension 8, and then provides the best-known current bound.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"To find a lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8, we can use the product construction.\")\n    print(\"This method combines known cap sets from smaller dimensions.\")\n    print(\"Let r_3(n) be the maximum size of a cap set in dimension n.\")\n    print(\"The product construction tells us that r_3(n1 + n2) >= r_3(n1) * r_3(n2).\\n\")\n\n    # Known exact sizes for some smaller dimensions\n    # r_3(6) = 112 was found by computer search by Davis and Maclagan (2003)\n    # r_3(2) = 4 is a simple, well-known result.\n    r3_6 = 112\n    r3_2 = 4\n\n    # We want a bound for dimension 8, which can be written as 6 + 2.\n    n1 = 6\n    n2 = 2\n    n_target = n1 + n2\n\n    # Calculate the lower bound from this construction\n    constructed_bound = r3_6 * r3_2\n\n    print(f\"Using the known sizes for dimension n={n1} (size={r3_6}) and n={n2} (size={r3_2}), we can construct a lower bound for dimension n={n_target}:\")\n    # Output the final equation with each number, as requested.\n    print(f\"The equation is: {r3_6} * {r3_2} = {constructed_bound}\")\n    print(f\"This construction proves that a cap set of at least size {constructed_bound} exists in dimension 8.\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"However, better constructions have been found.\")\n    best_known_bound = 496\n    print(f\"The best-known lower bound for the size of a cap set in dimension 8 is currently {best_known_bound}.\")\n    print(\"This result was established by C.
