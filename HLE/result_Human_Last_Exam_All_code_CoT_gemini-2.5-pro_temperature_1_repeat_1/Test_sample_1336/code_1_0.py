    This function calculates the total number of smooth coverings for the given problem.

    The problem asks for the total number of smooth coverings of D(PSL(2,p), b, w)
    by D(SL(2,p), b, w) for a prime p > 5.

    The relationship between G = SL(2, p) and S = PSL(2, p) is that G is a
    covering group of S. Specifically, S is the quotient of G by its center Z(G).
    The map from G to S is a projection whose kernel is Z(G).

    The "total number of coverings" is interpreted as the order of this covering,
    which is the size of the kernel, |Z(G)|.

    The center of SL(2, p) consists of scalar matrices k*I (where I is the identity)
    that have a determinant of 1.
    The determinant of k*I in 2 dimensions is k^2.
    So, we need to find the number of solutions to the equation k^2 = 1 in the field F_p.

    For any prime p > 2, the equation k^2 = 1 has exactly two solutions: k=1 and k=-1.
    These correspond to the two matrices in the center: I and -I.
    Thus, the order of the center |Z(SL(2, p))| is 2.
