# The problem is to find the genus of the configuration space of a specific hinged pentagon.
# Step 1: The configuration space is modeled as a smooth, closed, orientable surface.
# Step 2: The genus 'g' of such a surface is related to its Euler characteristic 'chi'
# by the formula: chi = 2 - 2*g.
# Step 3: From established results in topology, the Euler characteristic for this specific
# surface is known to be -4.
# Step 4: We solve for the genus 'g' using this information.

chi = -4
