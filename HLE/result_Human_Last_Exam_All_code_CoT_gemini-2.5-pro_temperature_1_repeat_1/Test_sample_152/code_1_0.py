# This script determines the description for Cell 9 based on the observed patterns.

# 1. Analyze the pattern for the 'Triangle' shape.
# We observe an arithmetic progression for dots and arrow position.

# The last known triangle cell is Cell 8.
dots_cell_8 = 3
# The arrow in Cell 8 is at pi radians.

# The increment is determined by the difference between Cell 8 and Cell 7.
# Cell 7 had 0 dots and 0 radians.
dots_increment = 3 - 0
arrow_rad_increment = math.pi - 0

# 2. Calculate the values for Cell 9 by applying the increment to Cell 8.
dots_cell_9 = dots_cell_8 + dots_increment
arrow_rad_cell_9 = arrow_rad_cell_8 + arrow_rad_increment

# The request requires printing the numbers in the final equation.
