    "Of course, I can help with that. To answer your question, I will write a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  First, I will find the necessary data that links Aortomesenteric diameter thresholds to their corresponding sensitivity and specificity for identifying EVP enhancement. Based on a medical study, I have found a table containing this information.\n2.  I will embed this data directly into the Python script using a list of dictionaries for easy processing.\n3.  The script will then iterate through each data point to find the diameter thresholds that meet the user's criteria: sensitivity greater than 60% and specificity greater than 80%.\n4.  From the list of valid thresholds, the script will determine the maximum value, as the question asks for the \"at most\" diameter.\n5.  Finally, the script will print a clear, step-by-step explanation of how it arrived at the answer, including the final comparison as requested, and then output the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_diameter_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script finds the maximum Aortomesenteric diameter threshold that has\n    >60% sensitivity and >80% specificity for identifying EVP enhancement\n    based on published clinical data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data from Kim et al.
