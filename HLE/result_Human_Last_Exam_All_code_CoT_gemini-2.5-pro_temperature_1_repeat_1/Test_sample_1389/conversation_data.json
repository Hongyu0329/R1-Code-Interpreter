    "An all-or-nothing vaccine is a type of vaccine that confers perfect immunity to a certain proportion of vaccinated individuals, while providing no protection at all to the remaining proportion. Let's denote the proportion of individuals who are fully protected as `VE`. The other `1 - VE` proportion remains as susceptible as unvaccinated individuals.\n\nThe per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) is the proportional reduction in susceptibility per exposure to the pathogen among vaccinated individuals compared to unvaccinated individuals. In the case of an all-or-nothing vaccine, the average susceptibility in the vaccinated group is a weighted average: `(VE * 0) + ((1 - VE) * susceptibility_unvaccinated)`. This simplifies to `(1 - VE) * susceptibility_unvaccinated`. Therefore, the true per-exposure efficacy `VE_p` is `1 - ((1 - VE) * susceptibility_unvaccinated) / susceptibility_unvaccinated`, which simplifies to `VE`.\n\nThe incidence rate ratio (IRR) is the ratio of the incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to the incidence rate in the unvaccinated group (`IR_u`). Since only the `1 - VE` proportion of the vaccinated group is at risk of infection, and they have the same risk as the unvaccinated, the incidence rate in the vaccinated group will be `IR_v = (1 - VE) * IR_u`.\n\nTherefore, the `IRR = IR_v / IR_u = (1 - VE) * IR_u / IR_u = 1 - VE`.\n\nThe vaccine efficacy estimated from the incidence rate is `1 - IRR`. Substituting our result for IRR, we get:\n`Estimated VE = 1 - (1 - VE) = VE`.\n\nSince the estimated VE (`VE`) is equal to the true per-exposure efficacy (`VE`), the measure `1 - IRR` correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n\nLet's demonstrate this with a simulation.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef vaccine_efficacy_simulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a cohort study to determine if 1 - IRR correctly estimates\n    per-exposure efficacy for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- 1.
