    "To find the value of the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Simplify the integrand:** The integrand is an infinite sum of logarithms. We can rewrite this sum as the logarithm of an infinite product:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) $$\n\n2.  **Evaluate the infinite product:** The infinite product is a well-known identity. We can derive it by using the sine double-angle formula, $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta$, which implies $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2\\sin\\theta}$.\n    Let's look at the partial product up to $N$:\n    $$ P_N(x) = \\prod_{n=1}^{N}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{4}\\right) \\cdots \\cos\\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) $$\n    By applying the identity to each term, we get a telescoping product:\n    $$ P_N(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{2\\sin(x/2)} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(x/2)}{2\\sin(x/4)} \\cdots \\frac{\\sin(x/2^{N-1})}{2\\sin(x/2^N)} = \\frac{\\sin x}{2^N \\sin(x/2^N)} $$\n    Taking the limit as $N \\to \\infty$, we use the fact that for small angles $\\theta$, $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$. Let $\\theta = x/2^N$. As $N \\to \\infty$, $\\theta \\to 0$.\n    $$ \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} 2^N \\sin\\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) = \\lim_{N\\to\\infty} 2^N \\left(\\frac{x}{2^N}\\right) = x $$\n    So, the infinite product is:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}} = \\frac{\\sin x}{x} $$\n\n3.  **Transform the integral:** Substituting this result back into the expression for the integrand, we find:\n    $$ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\cos\\frac{x}{2^{n}}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right) $$\n    The original integral is therefore transformed into:\n    $$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x $$\n    Note: For this identity to hold for all real x, we should technically use the logarithm of the absolute value, $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left|\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right|\\mathrm{d}x$. The domain issues with the logarithm for negative arguments are resolved by this, and the identity relating the sum and the product holds for the absolute values.\n\n4.  **Evaluate the final integral:** The resulting integral is a famous definite integral known as the Lobachevsky-Dirichlet integral. Its value is a standard result in mathematical analysis:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\log\\left(\\frac{\\sin x}{x}\\right)\\mathrm{d}x = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n    While the derivation of this value is non-trivial and involves advanced techniques, the result itself is well-established.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation:** The value of the integral is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. We can use Python to calculate this numerical value.\n\nThe following Python code calculates and prints the values of the numbers in the final expression $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and the final result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The value of the integral is -pi / 2.\n# The numbers in this final equation are pi and 2.\n\npi_val = math.pi\ndenominator = 2\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = -pi_val / denominator\n\nprint(f\"The integral is given by the expression: -pi / 2\")\nprint(f\"Value of pi: {pi_val}\")\nprint(f\"Value of the denominator: {denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The final value of the integral is: {result}\")\n```\n<<<-1.5707963267948966>>>"
