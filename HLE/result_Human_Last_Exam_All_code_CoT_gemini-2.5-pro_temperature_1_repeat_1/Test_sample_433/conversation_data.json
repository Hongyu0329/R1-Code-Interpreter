    "I will determine the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule based on the official guidelines from the United States Pharmacopeia (USP), which sets the standards for pharmaceutical compounding.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Identify the specific USP General Chapter <797> rule that applies to single-dose containers.\n2.  Note the specified environment, which is a \"sterile environment\" (classified as ISO Class 5 or cleaner).\n3.  State the time limit imposed by this rule from the moment of puncture.\n4.  Write a Python script to print this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef get_bud_for_single_dose_ampule():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) for a single-dose ampule\n    based on United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Chapter <797> guidelines.\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to USP <797>, a sterile environment is ISO Class 5 or cleaner.\n    # The rule for a single-dose container (like an ampule) opened in such an environment is specific.\n    bud_hours = 12\n    container = \"single-dose ampule\"\n    environment = \"sterile environment (ISO Class 5 or better)\"\n\n    print(f\"Guideline Source: USP General Chapter <797> Pharmaceutical Compoundingâ€”Sterile Preparations\")\n    print(f\"Container Type: {container}\")\n    print(f\"Compounding Environment: {environment}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(f\"From the time of puncture, the Beyond-Use Date (BUD) is {bud_hours} hours.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"This means the medication must be administered or discarded within this timeframe.\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the information.\nget_bud_for_single_dose_ampule()\n```\n<<<12 hours>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What is the BUD for a single dose container ampule from the time of puncture in a sterile environment? \nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
