    Determines the truth value of the given modal logic statement.
    
    The problem asks for the truth value in world w1 of the statement S:
    S = Box(forall x, y, z (T(x, y, z) -> Box(T(x, y, z))))
    
    The provided scenario includes facts about individuals a, b, and c,
    with their respective truth values 0.5, 1, and 0 in different worlds.
    
    However, the truth value of S can be determined directly from the axioms.
    
    1. Let's denote the inner implication as Phi(x, y, z):
       Phi(x, y, z) = T(x, y, z) -> Box(T(x, y, z))
    
    2. The system includes the 'Axiom Truth Value':
       A_TV = forall x, y, z (T(x, y, z) -> Box(forall w (R(z, w) -> T(x, y, w))))
    
    3. Let's analyze the consequent of the axiom's implication:
       C_Axiom = Box(forall w (R(z, w) -> T(x, y, w)))
       The formula inside this Box is: F = forall w (R(z, w) -> T(x, y, w))
    
    4. The accessibility relation R is reflexive, meaning R(z, z) is always true.
       If we instantiate F with w = z, we get the implication: R(z, z) -> T(x, y, z).
       Since R(z, z) is true, T(x, y, z) must be true.
       Therefore, F logically implies T(x, y, z).
    
    5. In modal logic, if P -> Q, then Box(P) -> Box(Q).
       Applying this, C_Axiom implies Box(T(x, y, z)).
       So, Box(forall w (R(z, w) -> T(x, y, w))) -> Box(T(x, y, z)).
    
    6. Now we can construct a proof for Phi(x, y, z):
       a) T(x, y, z) -> Box(forall w (R(z, w) -> T(x, y, z)))  (From Axiom A_TV)
       b) Box(forall w (R(z, w) -> T(x, y, z))) -> Box(T(x, y, z))  (From step 5)
       c) By transitivity of implication on (a) and (b), we get:
          T(x, y, z) -> Box(T(x, y, z))
    
    7. This proves that Phi(x, y, z) is a theorem of the system for any x, y, z.
       Therefore, the universally quantified statement forall x, y, z (Phi(x, y, z))
       is a theorem and is true in all possible worlds.
    
    8. The original statement S is Box(forall x, y, z (Phi(x, y, z))).
       Since the part inside the Box is true in all worlds, it is true in all worlds
       accessible from w1. By the definition of Box, S must be true in w1.
    
    9. A true statement corresponds to the truth value 1.
