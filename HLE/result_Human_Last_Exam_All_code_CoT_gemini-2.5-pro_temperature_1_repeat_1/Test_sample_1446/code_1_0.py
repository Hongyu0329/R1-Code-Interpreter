# The user's question asks for the critical exponent nu (ν) in a
# "G₄-theoretical framework". This is interpreted as the standard φ⁴ theory
# of critical phenomena. The value of ν depends on the spatial dimension d.

# The request for a single "precise value" points towards a case where ν is
# an exact rational number. This occurs at or above the upper critical
# dimension of the φ⁴ theory, which is d=4.

# In this regime (d >= 4), mean-field theory is exact, and the critical
# exponent ν, which governs the scaling of the correlation length,
# takes on a universal, precise value.

# The value is given by the following equation.
nu_numerator = 1
nu_denominator = 2
nu_value = nu_numerator / nu_denominator

# We print the context and the final equation, showing all the numbers involved.
