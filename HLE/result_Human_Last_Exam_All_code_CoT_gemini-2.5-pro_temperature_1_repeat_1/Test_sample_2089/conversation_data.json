    "This is a film trivia question. The prompt requires the answer to be delivered within a Python script. I will create a simple script that prints the explanation and the name of the film. The film you're referring to is likely Steven Spielberg's 2005 Oscar-nominated film, *Munich*.\n\nIn the film, there's a pivotal scene on a bus. An Israeli assassin, Carl, is tracking a target. The target boards the bus with his young daughter. Another assassin, Steve, helps the daughter, and the target says \"Thank you\" to him in English. Carl, who is undercover and not supposed to be a foreigner, instinctively replies \"You're welcome\" in English. This polite, automatic response blows his cover to the suspicious target. This mistake compromises the mission and directly leads to Carl being located and killed later in the film, thus sealing his fate.\n\nHere is the Python code that will print this answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_trivia():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the answer to the film trivia question.\n    \"\"\"\n    film_title = \"Munich\"\n    explanation = (\n        \"The Oscar-nominated film in which a character's fate is sealed following a polite exchange on a bus is 'Munich' (2005).\\n\\n\"\n        \"In the scene, the assassin Carl is on a bus when the target he is tracking says 'Thank you' to another agent. \"\n        \"Carl instinctively replies 'You're welcome' in English, which blows his cover as a local. \"\n        \"This mistake ultimately leads to his death later in the film.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"The film is: {film_title}\")\n    print(\"\\nExplanation:\")\n    print(explanation)\n\nsolve_trivia()\n```\n<<<Munich>>>"
