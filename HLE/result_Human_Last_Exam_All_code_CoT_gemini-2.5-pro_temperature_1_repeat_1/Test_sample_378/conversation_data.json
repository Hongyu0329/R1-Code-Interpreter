    "Based on my research, the premise of your question appears to be incorrect. Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. There is no public record of him ever adding \"Azikiwe\" to his name or publicly identifying himself as such.\n\nThe name \"Azikiwe\" is famously associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. It is possible that you are conflating these two distinct political figures.\n\nSince the event you're asking about did not happen, I will provide a Python script that clarifies this information.\n\n```python\ndef check_name_record():\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks for public records of Goodluck Jonathan identifying as 'Azikiwe'.\n    \"\"\"\n    person_of_interest = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    name_in_question = \"Azikiwe\"\n    \n    # Based on extensive public records, this event has not occurred.\n    # The following print statements will explain the situation.\n    \n    print(f\"The user is asking for the year {person_of_interest} publicly identified as {name_in_question}.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Analysis ---\")\n    print(f\"1.

The name 'Azikiwe' is famously associated with Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria.\")\n    print(f\"4. The premise of the question is incorrect as this event never occurred.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Conclusion ---\")\n    print(\"There is no year in which Goodluck Ebele Jonathan publicly identified himself as Azikiwe.\")\n\ncheck_name_record()\n```\n<<<There is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever identifying himself by the name Azikiwe.>>>"

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
