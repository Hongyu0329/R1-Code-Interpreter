1) The primary hotspots on the beta-1 subunit for interaction with the alpha-1 subunit are key residues within the Beta Interaction Domain (BID). These include Tyrosine (Y) at position 313, Tryptophan (W) at position 324, and Aspartate (D) at position 328 (numbering based on beta-1b isoform, UniProt P54283-2).

2) The primary hotspot region for fine-tuning the gating properties of the alpha-1 subunit is the N-terminal domain of the beta-1b isoform (residues 1-30). Specific residues within this region, such as the Arginines (R) at positions 16, 18, and 23, are particularly important for modulating the kinetics of channel inactivation.
