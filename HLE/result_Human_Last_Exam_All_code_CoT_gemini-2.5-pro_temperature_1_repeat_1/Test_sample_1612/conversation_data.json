    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nTo figure out the total number of Triple Crown winners in MLB history, we need to consider both the batting and pitching Triple Crowns.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  A **batting** Triple Crown is awarded to a player who leads their league in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in (RBIs).\n2.  A **pitching** Triple Crown is awarded to a player who leads their league in wins, strikeouts, and earned run average (ERA).\n3.  I will count the number of unique players who have achieved the batting Triple Crown.\n4.  I will count the number of unique players who have achieved the pitching Triple Crown.\n5.  Finally, I will add these two numbers together to get the total number of unique Triple Crown winners.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this calculation.\n\n```python\n# Number of unique players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n# This includes 9 in the American League and 5 in the National League.\nbatting_winners = 14\n\n# Number of unique players who have won the pitching Triple Crown.\n# This includes 11 in the American League and 10 in the National League.\npitching_winners = 21\n\n# Calculate the total number of unique winners.\n# No player has won both a batting and a pitching Triple Crown.\ntotal_winners = batting_winners + pitching_winners\n\nprint(f\"To find the total number of MLB Triple Crown winners, we add the unique batting winners and the unique pitching winners:\")\nprint(f\"{batting_winners} + {pitching_winners} = {total_winners}\")\n```\n<<<35>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many triple crowns winners are there in MLB baseball?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
