    "My plan is to identify the major real-world rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid, find their approximate lengths, and then use a Python script to determine the three longest among them.\n\n1.  **Identify Rivers:** I will search the text of the Aeneid (or scholarly summaries) for mentions of real-world rivers. Key rivers include the Tiber, Nile, Euphrates, Danube (Ister), Rhine, and Ganges, many of which appear on the shield of Aeneas in Book VIII.\n2.  **Gather Data:** I will look up the modern accepted lengths for these rivers in kilometers.\n3.  **Code Implementation:** I will create a Python dictionary storing the river names and their lengths. The script will then sort this data by length in descending order.\n4.  **Output:** The script will print the names and lengths of the top three longest rivers.\n\n```python\nimport operator\n\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid.\n    The Aeneid mentions several real-world rivers, especially on the Shield of Aeneas in Book VIII.\n    This script stores a list of these rivers and their approximate modern lengths to find the longest.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Dictionary of rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their lengths in kilometers.\n    # Sources for river mentions include Book VI (Po), Book VIII (Nile, Euphrates, Danube, Rhine, Ganges, Araxes), etc.\n    rivers = {\n        'Nile': 6650,\n        'Danube (Ister)': 2850,\n        'Euphrates': 2800,\n        'Ganges': 2525,\n        'Rhine': 1233,\n        'Araxes': 1072,\n        'Po (Eridanus)': 652,\n        'Tiber': 406\n    }\n\n    # Sort the dictionary by river length in descending order\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers.items(), key=operator.itemgetter(1), reverse=True)\n\n    # Get the top three longest rivers\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n\n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    for river, length in top_three_rivers:\n        print(f\"- {river}: approximately {length} km\")\n\nfind_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are the Nile, the Danube (mentioned as the Ister), and the Euphrates.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which are the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
