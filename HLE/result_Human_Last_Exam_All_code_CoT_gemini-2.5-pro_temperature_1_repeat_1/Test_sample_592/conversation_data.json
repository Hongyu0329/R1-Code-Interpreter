    "Based on my research, the premise of your question contains a small inaccuracy. In the 1997 movie *Ovosodo*, the main character, Tommaso, does not actually move to the United States. The film is set in his hometown of Livorno, Italy, and follows his life there.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Which US city does he move to?\" is that he doesn't. I will provide a Python script to print this clarification.\n\n```python\ndef get_movie_fact():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question about the movie Ovosodo.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"Ovosodo\"\n    character_name = \"Tommaso\"\n    \n    # Based on the film's plot, the character does not move to a US city.\n    clarification = f\"In the 1997 movie {movie_title}, the character {character_name} does not move to a city in the United States. The story is set in Livorno, Italy.\"\n    \n    print(clarification)\n\nget_movie_fact()\n```\n<<<He does not move to a US city.>>>"
