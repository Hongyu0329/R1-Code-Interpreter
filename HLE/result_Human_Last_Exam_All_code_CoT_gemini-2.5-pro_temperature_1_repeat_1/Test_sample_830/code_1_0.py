# The problem asks for the value of the limit:
# L = liminf_{N(I) -> +inf} (phi(I) * log(log(N(I)))) / N(I)
# for an affine function ring R.

# This is the function field analogue of a classical theorem by Landau for integers,
# which states that the limit is e^(-gamma), where gamma is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.
# For the polynomial ring R = F_q[T], which is the simplest and most common analogue
# of the integers Z, the value of the limit is also e^(-gamma). The problem's
# parameters (genus g, class number h, and the Euler constant gamma) are consistent
# with this interpretation.

# The final equation for the limit L is L = e^(-gamma).
# We will compute this value. The number in this equation is gamma.

# Get the value of the Euler-Mascheroni constant from numpy.
gamma = np.euler_gamma

# Calculate the result of the expression e^(-gamma).
result = np.exp(-gamma)
