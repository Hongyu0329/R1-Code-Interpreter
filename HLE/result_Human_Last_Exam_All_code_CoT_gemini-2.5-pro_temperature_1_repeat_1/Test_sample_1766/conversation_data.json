    "For a p-electron, we need to determine the eigenvalues of the total angular momentum operators $J^2$ and $J_z$. The total angular momentum $\\vec{J}$ is the sum of the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ and the spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers:** A p-electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number `l = 1`. As an electron, its spin quantum number is `s = 1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum Quantum Number (j):** The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, are determined by the rule: `j` ranges from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   `|l - s| = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2`\n    *   `l + s = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`\n    *   So, the possible `j` values are `1/2` and `3/2`.\n3.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of J²:** The eigenvalues of the $J^2$ operator are given by the formula `ħ² * j * (j + 1)`. We will calculate this for each possible `j` value.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues of Jz:** The eigenvalues of the $J_z$ operator are given by the formula `ħ * m_j`, where `m_j` (the total magnetic quantum number) ranges from `-j` to `+j` in steps of 1. We will calculate this for each `j` and its corresponding `m_j` values.\n5.  **Present the Results:** The code will systematically iterate through each `j` value and its associated `m_j` values, printing the calculations and the resulting common eigenvalues for each state `|j, m_j>`. The `fractions` module will be used to display the results as clean fractions.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum quantum number for p-electron\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)  # Spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps\n    j_values = [Fraction(j) for j in range(int(j_min * 2), int(j_max * 2) + 1, 2)]\n    j_values = [j / 2 for j in j_values]\n    \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {[float(j) for j in j_values]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate and print eigenvalues for each j\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"\\nFor the state with j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is calculated as ħ² * j * (j + 1).\")\n        print(f\"  J^2 eigenvalue = ħ² * {j} * ({j} + 1) = ħ² * {j} * {j+1} = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ²\")\n        \n        # Determine m_j values\n        m_j_values = [Fraction(m, 2) for m in range(int(-j * 2), int(j * 2) + 1, 2)]\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values are: {[float(m) for m in m_j_values]}\")\n        print(f\"  The common eigenstates |j, m_j> have the following J_z eigenvalues:\")\n\n        # Calculate J_z eigenvalue for each m_j\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is just m_j * h_bar\n            jz_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"    For state |j={j}, m_j={m_j}>:\")\n            print(f\"      Eigenvalue of J_z = {jz_eigenvalue}ħ\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n<<<\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_spin_orbital_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define quantum numbers for a p-electron\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum quantum number for p-electron\n    s = Fraction(1, 2)  # Spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin quantum number s = {s}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n    j_min = abs(l - s)\n    j_max = l + s\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps\n    j_values = [Fraction(j) for j in range(int(j_min * 2), int(j_max * 2) + 1, 2)]\n    j_values = [j / 2 for j in j_values]\n    \n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {[float(j) for j in j_values]}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Calculate and print eigenvalues for each j\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"\\nFor the state with j = {j}:\")\n        \n        # Calculate J^2 eigenvalue\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"The eigenvalue of J^2 is calculated as ħ² * j * (j + 1).\")\n        print(f\"  J^2 eigenvalue = ħ² * {j} * ({j} + 1) = ħ² * {j} * {j+1} = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ²\")\n        \n        # Determine m_j values\n        m_j_values = [Fraction(m, 2) for m in range(int(-j * 2), int(j * 2) + 1, 2)]\n        \n        print(f\"  The possible m_j values are: {[float(m) for m in m_j_values]}\")\n        print(f\"  The common eigenstates |j, m_j> have the following J_z eigenvalues:\")\n\n        # Calculate J_z eigenvalue for each m_j\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            # The J_z eigenvalue is just m_j * h_bar\n            jz_eigenvalue = m_j\n            print(f\"    For state |j={j}, m_j={m_j}>:\")\n            print(f\"      Eigenvalue of J_z = {jz_eigenvalue}ħ\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbital_coupling()\n```\n>>>"
