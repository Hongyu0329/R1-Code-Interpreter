    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step derivation for the partition function using a path integral interpretation, presented in a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Grand Canonical Partition Function (Z):** Start with the standard definition of Z, which is `Z = Tr[exp(-β(H - μN))]`.\n2.  **Substitute the Given Hamiltonian:** Input the specific Hamiltonian `H = -μN` into the general formula for Z.\n3.  **Interpret as a Path Integral:** The trace operation can be viewed as a sum over all possible states or \"histories\" of the system. Since the Hamiltonian only depends on the particle number operator `N`, which is conserved, the \"paths\" are simply the constant particle number states `n = 0, 1, 2, ...`.\n4.  **Calculate the Action:** For each path (i.e., for each constant particle number `n`), calculate the corresponding Euclidean action `S_n`. The action is the integral of the energy eigenvalue over the imaginary time interval `[0, β]`.\n5.  **Sum Over All Paths:** The total partition function `Z` is the sum of the contributions `exp(-S_n)` from all possible paths (all `n`).\n6.  **Evaluate the Series:** The resulting sum is a geometric series, which can be evaluated to a simple closed-form expression, assuming it converges.\n\nHere is the Python code that executes this plan and prints the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_partition_function():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives the partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian H = -μN\n    in the grand canonical ensemble using a path integral framework.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script derives the partition function Z for the given system.\")\n    print(\"=\"*60)\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: State the Grand Canonical Partition Function Z\")\n    print(\"The general definition of the partition function in the grand canonical ensemble is:\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr(exp(-β * (H - μ*N)))\")\n    print(\"Here, β is the inverse temperature (1/kT), H is the Hamiltonian, μ is the chemical potential, and N is the particle number operator.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Substitute the System's Hamiltonian\")\n    print(\"The problem provides the Hamiltonian H = -μ*N.\")\n    print(\"Substituting this into the general formula:\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr(exp(-β * ((-μ*N) - μ*N)))\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr(exp(-β * (-2*μ*N)))\")\n    print(\"Z = Tr(exp(2*β*μ*N))\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Interpret the Trace as a Path Integral (Sum over Histories)\")\n    print(\"A path integral sums over all possible histories.
