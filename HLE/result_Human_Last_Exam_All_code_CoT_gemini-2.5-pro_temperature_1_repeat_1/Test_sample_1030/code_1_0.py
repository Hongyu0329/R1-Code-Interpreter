    print("2. The key property is `v(φ ∧ ¬φ) = T` for a glut. This implies a paraconsistent logic like FDE (First Degree Entailment) where v(A) and v(¬A) can both be True.")
    print("3. Truth conditions for connectives are:")

    print("   - The term (A ∧ B) is also F. In this logic, we can assign a truth value to its negation independently. Let's set v(¬(A ∧ B)) = F.")
    print("   - The conclusion becomes v(F ∨ F), which is F.")
