    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand the Structure:** First, I will analyze the structure of a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree. For a given depth `d`, the tree is a binary tree where each non-leaf node represents a partitioning of a matrix into a 2x2 block. The recursion stops at the leaf nodes.\n2.  **Count the Submatrices:** I will count the number of submatrices involved in the HSS representation. This can be broken down into two types:\n    *   **Off-diagonal blocks:** For every non-leaf node in the tree, its corresponding matrix is partitioned, generating two off-diagonal blocks that are represented in a low-rank format.\n    *   **Leaf-level diagonal blocks:** At the lowest level of the tree (the leaves), the diagonal blocks are typically stored as dense matrices.\n3.  **Derive a Formula:** I will combine these counts to derive a general formula for the total number of submatrices accessed for a tree of depth `d`. The total number is the sum of all off-diagonal blocks and the leaf-level diagonal blocks. The formula is `Total = 3 * 2^(d-1) - 2`.\n4.  **Write the Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that takes the depth `d=4`, applies the derived formula, and prints out each step of the calculation to show how the final answer is obtained, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed in an HSS matrix\n    multiplication for a given tree depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The depth of the Hierarchical Semi-separable tree\n    depth = 4\n\n    # The formula to calculate the number of submatrices is 3 * 2^(d-1) - 2.\n    # This is derived from:\n    # - Number of leaf nodes (diagonal blocks): 2^(d-1)\n    # - Number of non-leaf nodes: Sum of 2^k for k=0 to d-2, which is 2^(d-1) - 1\n    # - Number of off-diagonal blocks: 2 * (number of non-leaf nodes)\n    # - Total = (2 * (2^(d-1) - 1)) + 2^(d-1) = 3 * 2^(d-1) - 2\n\n    # Perform the calculation step-by-step\n    power_val = depth - 1\n    power_result = int(math.pow(2, power_val))\n    mult_result = 3 * power_result\n    final_result = mult_result - 2\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation step-by-step\n    print(f\"To find the number of submatrices accessed in an HSS tree of depth d = {depth}, we use the formula: 3 * 2^(d-1) - 2.\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Equation: 3 * 2^({depth}-1) - 2\")\n    print(f\"Step 1: Calculate the exponent -> 3 * 2^{power_val} - 2\")\n    print(f\"Step 2: Calculate the power of 2 -> 3 * {power_result} - 2\")\n    print(f\"Step 3: Perform the multiplication -> {mult_result} - 2\")\n    print(f\"Step 4: Perform the subtraction -> {final_result}\")\n    print(f\"\\nSo, for a depth of {depth}, the final equation is: 3 * {power_result} - 2 = {final_result}\")\n\nsolve_hss_submatrices()\n```\n<<<22>>>"
