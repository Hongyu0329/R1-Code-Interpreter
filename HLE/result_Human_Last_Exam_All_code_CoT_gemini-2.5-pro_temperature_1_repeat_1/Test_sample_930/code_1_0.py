    This function identifies the mutualists of Asclepias fascicularis from a predefined list.

    A mutualistic relationship is one where both organisms benefit. In this context,
    the primary mutualists are the adult insects that act as pollinators, receiving
    nectar in exchange for helping the plant reproduce.

    - Danaus plexippus (Adult, #1): Pollinator. Mutualist.
    - Megachile frigidus (Adult, #2): Pollinator. Mutualist.
    - Formica rufa (Adult, #3): Relationship is not clearly mutualistic. Not included.
    - Sphex ichneumoneus (Adult, #4): Pollinator. Mutualist.
    - Pepsis thisbe (Adult, #5): Pollinator. Mutualist.
    - Megachile ericetorum (Adult, #6): Pollinator. Mutualist.
    - Danaus plexippus (Larva, #7): Herbivore, eats the plant. Not a mutualist.
    - All other larvae (#8, #9, #10, #11, #12): Do not interact directly with the plant. Not mutualists.
