# Based on the derivation, the limit of n*P(n) as n approaches infinity
# is given by the expression 2 * sqrt(3) / pi.

# Define the constants from the final expression.
numerator_coefficient = 2
radical_term = 3

# Calculate the result.
limit_value = (numerator_coefficient * math.sqrt(radical_term)) / math.pi

# The final equation for the limit is limit = (2 * sqrt(3)) / pi.
# We print the components of this equation and its numerical value.
