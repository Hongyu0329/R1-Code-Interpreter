    This function presents the solution for the liquid rise problem based on the provided answer choices.

    The problem asks for an expression for the liquid rise height (xi) and the voltage (V_0)
    required for the rise to be half the electrode separation (xi = s/2).

    Analysis of the options suggests that Choice C is the most plausible, despite apparent
    inconsistencies and typos in the problem statement and choices. The following code
    prints the expressions from Choice C.
