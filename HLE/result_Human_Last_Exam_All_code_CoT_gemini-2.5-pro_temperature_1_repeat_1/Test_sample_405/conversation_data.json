    "Here is my plan to solve this question:\n1.  First, I will identify the main allotropes of pure phosphorus.\n2.  Next, I will determine the distinct color of each of these allotropes.\n3.  Finally, I will write a Python script that lists these colors, counts them, and prints the total number. The script will also display the count as a sum, as requested.\n\nThe main allotropes of phosphorus and their corresponding colors are:\n*   **White phosphorus:** Which is a waxy solid that is white but can appear yellow upon exposure to light. We'll count this as one color category.\n*   **Red phosphorus:** This allotrope is red.\n*   **Violet phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's metallic phosphorus, this form is violet.\n*   **Black phosphorus:** The most stable form, it is black with a metallic luster.\n\nThis gives us a total of 4 distinct colors.\n\n```python\ndef solve_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the number of observable colors\n    in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The main allotropes of phosphorus have distinct colors.\n    # We list them here.\n    colors = {\n        \"White/Yellow\": \"White Phosphorus\",\n        \"Red\": \"Red Phosphorus\",\n        \"Violet\": \"Violet Phosphorus\",\n        \"Black\": \"Black Phosphorus\"\n    }\n\n    # The number of colors is the number of items in our dictionary.\n    num_colors = len(colors)\n\n    print(\"The distinct colors observed in pure phosphorus allotropes are:\")\n    for color, allotrope in colors.items():\n        print(f\"- {color} (from {allotrope})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the total number of colors, we can represent each color as '1' and sum them up.\")\n\n    # Building and printing the equation as requested.\n    equation_parts = [\"1\" for color in colors]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"The equation is: {equation_str} = {num_colors}\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThus, there are {num_colors} distinct colors that can be observed.\")\n\nsolve_phosphorus_colors()\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
