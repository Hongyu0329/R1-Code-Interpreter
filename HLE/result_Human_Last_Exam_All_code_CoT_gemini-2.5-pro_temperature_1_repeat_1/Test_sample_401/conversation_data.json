    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Key Concepts:** First, I will clarify the definitions of the mathematical terms used in the question: \"continuum,\" \"indecomposable continuum,\" and \"composant.\" This is crucial for understanding the context.\n2.  **Relate Composants to Decomposability:** I will state the fundamental theorem that connects the number of composants to whether a continuum is decomposable or indecomposable. This theorem establishes a lower bound on the number of composants for an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  **Invoke the Main Theorem:** I will then introduce the more powerful theorem by Stefan Mazurkiewicz concerning the exact number of composants in any indecomposable continuum. This theorem uses a proof based on the Baire Category Theorem.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the theorem, the number of composants is fixed for all indecomposable continua. Therefore, the \"smallest number\" is simply that specific value.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will create a Python script that codifies this explanation in its comments and prints the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_continuum_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the smallest number of composants\n    an indecomposable continuum can have.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the core concepts from continuum theory.\n    # A 'continuum' is a nonempty, compact, connected, Hausdorff space.\n    # A continuum X is 'indecomposable' if it cannot be written as the union\n    # of two proper subcontinua (i.e., subcontinua not equal to X).\n    # A 'composant' of a point p in X is the set of all points q such that\n    # p and q lie together in some proper subcontinuum of X.\n\n    # Step 2: Establish the relationship between composants and decomposability.\n    # A foundational theorem states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if\n    # it has exactly one composant.\n    # Consequently, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.\n    # So, the number must be at least 2.\n\n    # Step 3: State the definitive theorem on the number of composants.\n    # A more powerful theorem, a classic result in continuum theory, states that\n    # any indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants.\n    # The proof uses the Baire Category Theorem to show that if the number of\n    # composants were countable, the continuum would be a 'meager set' (a countable\n    # union of nowhere-dense sets), which contradicts the fact that a continuum\n    # is a Baire space.\n\n    # Step 4: Specify the exact cardinality.\n    # The theorem is even more specific: the number of composants in any\n    # indecomposable continuum is exactly 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.\n    # (c = 2^ℵ₀, the size of the set of real numbers).\n\n    # Step 5: Conclusion.\n    # Since every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants, there is no\n    # variation. The number is always the same. Therefore, the \"smallest number\"\n    # of composants such a continuum can have is 'c'.\n\n    # The final answer is not a number in the traditional sense, but a cardinality.\n    # There is no equation, so we will print the symbol for the answer.\n    final_answer_symbol = \"c\"\n    \n    print(\"The smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have is not a finite integer.\")\n    print(\"According to a fundamental theorem of continuum theory, every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants.\")\n    print(\"'c' represents the cardinality of the continuum (the size of the set of real numbers).\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Answer Symbol:\")\n    print(final_answer_symbol)\n\nsolve_continuum_question()\n```\n<<<c>>>"
