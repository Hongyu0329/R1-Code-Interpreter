    # Step 1: Define the core concepts from continuum theory.
    # A 'continuum' is a nonempty, compact, connected, Hausdorff space.
    # A continuum X is 'indecomposable' if it cannot be written as the union
    # of two proper subcontinua (i.e., subcontinua not equal to X).
    # A 'composant' of a point p in X is the set of all points q such that
    # p and q lie together in some proper subcontinuum of X.

    # Step 2: Establish the relationship between composants and decomposability.
    # A foundational theorem states that a continuum is decomposable if and only if
    # it has exactly one composant.
    # Consequently, an indecomposable continuum must have more than one composant.
    # So, the number must be at least 2.

    # Step 3: State the definitive theorem on the number of composants.
    # A more powerful theorem, a classic result in continuum theory, states that
    # any indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants.
    # The proof uses the Baire Category Theorem to show that if the number of
    # composants were countable, the continuum would be a 'meager set' (a countable
    # union of nowhere-dense sets), which contradicts the fact that a continuum
    # is a Baire space.

    # Step 4: Specify the exact cardinality.
    # The theorem is even more specific: the number of composants in any
    # indecomposable continuum is exactly 'c', the cardinality of the continuum.
    # (c = 2^ℵ₀, the size of the set of real numbers).

    # Step 5: Conclusion.
    # Since every indecomposable continuum has exactly 'c' composants, there is no
    # variation. The number is always the same. Therefore, the "smallest number"
    # of composants such a continuum can have is 'c'.

    # The final answer is not a number in the traditional sense, but a cardinality.
    # There is no equation, so we will print the symbol for the answer.
    final_answer_symbol = "c"
