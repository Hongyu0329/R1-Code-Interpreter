    Solves the set theory problem by explaining the logical steps.

    The problem is to find the largest positive integer n such that AC(2) implies AC(n)
    in ZF set theory without the Axiom of Choice.

    AC(n) is the statement: "Every family of n-element sets has a choice function".
    An implication P => Q is a theorem if there is no model of the base theory (ZF)
    in which P is true and Q is false.
