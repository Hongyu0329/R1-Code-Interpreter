    "This is a problem of lattice classification, a known topic in mathematics. The number of positive definite even lattices of a given dimension and determinant is finite and, for these small parameters, has been completely determined.\n\nI will provide a Python script that explains the origin of the number and calculates the final sum. The total number is the sum of the *decomposable* and *indecomposable* lattices.\n\nA lattice `L` is decomposable if it can be written as an orthogonal direct sum of two non-trivial lattices, `L = L₁ ⊕ L₂`. In this case, `dim(L) = dim(L₁) + dim(L₂)` and `det(L) = det(L₁) * det(L₂)`. Since we require `det(L) = 2`, one of the components must have determinant 1 (unimodular) and the other must have determinant 2. Even unimodular lattices only exist in dimensions that are multiples of 8.\n\nThe script will count the number of decomposable and indecomposable lattices and sum them up.\n\n```python\ndef solve_lattice_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of positive definite even lattices\n    of dimension 17 and determinant 2 based on known mathematical classifications.\n    The total is the sum of decomposable and indecomposable lattices.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Decomposable Lattices\n    # A lattice L is decomposable if L = L1 ⊕ L2.\n    # We need det(L) = det(L1) * det(L2) = 2.\n    # This means one lattice (L1) must be unimodular (det=1) and the other (L2) must have det=2.\n    # For L to be even, both L1 and L2 must be even.\n    # Even unimodular lattices exist only in dimensions that are a multiple of 8.\n\n    # Case A: dim(L1) = 16, dim(L2) = 1.\n    # There are 2 even unimodular lattices of dimension 16 (E8⊕E8 and D16+).\n    # There is 1 even lattice of dimension 1, det 2 (given by Gram matrix (2)).\n    # This gives 2 decomposable lattices.\n    num_decomposable_case_a = 2\n\n    # Case B: dim(L1) = 8, dim(L2) = 9.\n    # There is 1 even unimodular lattice of dimension 8 (the E8 lattice).\n    # There is 1 even lattice of dimension 9, det 2.\n    # This gives 1 decomposable lattice.\n    num_decomposable_case_b = 1\n\n    num_decomposable = num_decomposable_case_a + num_decomposable_case_b\n\n    # 2.
