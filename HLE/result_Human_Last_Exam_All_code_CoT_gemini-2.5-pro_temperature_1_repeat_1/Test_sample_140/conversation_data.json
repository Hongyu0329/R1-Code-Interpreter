    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can be physically packed inside a 15x15x15 cube. A simple division of volumes gives an upper limit, but doesn't guarantee a valid packing arrangement.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Partition the Cube**: The most effective packing strategy for this kind of problem is often to partition the larger container based on the dimensions of the object being packed. Since the cube's edge length is 15 and the block's length is 9, a natural way to partition the cube is by dividing each 15-unit edge into a 9-unit segment and a 6-unit segment (since 15 = 9 + 6).\n2.  **Identify Sub-volumes**: This partitioning divides the 15x15x15 cube into 8 smaller cuboids:\n    *   One 9x9x9 cuboid\n    *   Three 9x9x6 cuboids\n    *   Three 9x6x6 cuboids\n    *   One 6x6x6 cuboid\n3.  **Calculate Blocks per Sub-volume**: For each of these smaller cuboids, I will calculate the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit inside. A block can only fit if at least one of the cuboid's dimensions is 9 or more. For any cuboid where a block can fit, the blocks will be aligned with the dimension that is 9 units long.\n4.  **Sum the Totals**: Finally, I will sum the number of blocks from all the sub-volumes to get the total number of blocks that can fit in the entire cube. The 6x6x6 cuboid represents the wasted space where no blocks can fit.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, explaining each step of the calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_packing_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of 9x1x1 blocks that can fit in a 15x15x15 cube.\n    \"\"\"\n    cube_edge = 15\n    block_l, block_w, block_h = 9, 1, 1\n\n    print(f\"This program calculates the largest number of {block_l}x{block_w}x{block_h} blocks that fit inside a {cube_edge}x{cube_edge}x{cube_edge} cube.\")\n    print(\"The strategy is to partition the cube based on the block's longest dimension.\")\n    print(f\"We partition each 15-unit edge into a {block_l}-unit part and a {cube_edge - block_l}-unit part (15 = 9 + 6).\\n\")\n\n    # Partition 1: 9x9x9 cuboid\n    # There is 1 of these.\n    p1_dims = (9, 9, 9)\n    num_p1 = 1\n    # Blocks must be oriented as 9x1x1.\n    blocks_p1 = (p1_dims[0] // block_l) * (p1_dims[1] // block_w) * (p1_dims[2] // block_h)\n    total_blocks_p1 = num_p1 * blocks_p1\n    print(f\"1.
