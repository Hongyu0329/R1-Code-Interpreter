# Parameters from the problem description
p = 43
n = 18
e = 3

# Calculate the residue field degree f and its size q
f = n // e
q = p**f

# Based on the interpretation of the equivalence condition, the congruence is modulo m_K^m,
# where m = e + 1.
m = e + 1

# Number of equivalence classes for the first component (z0 in O_K^*)
# This is the size of the group of units in the quotient ring O_K / m_K^m
num_classes_z0 = q**(m - 1) * (q - 1)

# Number of equivalence classes for the second component (z in O_K)
# This is the size of the quotient ring O_K / m_K^m
num_classes_z = q**m

# Total number of equivalence classes is the product of the two
total_classes = num_classes_z0 * num_classes_z

# The formula is q^(2m-1) * (q-1)
# With q = p^f and m = e + 1, this is (p^f)^(2(e+1)-1) * (p^f - 1)
# (43^6)^(2(3+1)-1) * (43^6 - 1) = (43^6)^7 * (43^6 - 1) = 43^42 * (43^6 - 1)
