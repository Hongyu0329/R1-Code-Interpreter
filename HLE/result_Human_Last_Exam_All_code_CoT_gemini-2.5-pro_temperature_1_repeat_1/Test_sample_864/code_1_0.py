    Solves for the whitening filter W(D) based on a corrected version of the problem.

    The original problem statement for q_k leads to a Q(D) that is not a valid
    power spectral density (it can be negative). We proceed by assuming a typo
    in the problem statement. A common scenario in such problems is that the
    autocorrelation sequence q_k is much simpler.

    We assume q_k is non-zero only for k=0, +/-1, and that the values are such
    that a real spectral factorization is possible. Specifically, we assume:
    q_0 = 5/3
    q_1 = q_{-1} = 2/3
    q_k = 0 for |k| >= 2

    This allows for a factorization Q(D) = H_eq(D) * H_eq(D^{-1}) where
    H_eq(D) = a + b*D.
