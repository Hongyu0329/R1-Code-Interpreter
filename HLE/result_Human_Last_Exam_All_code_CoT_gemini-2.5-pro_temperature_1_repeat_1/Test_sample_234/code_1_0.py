    # Property Analysis:
    # 1. Open: ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    The definition of S requires a property to hold on an open neighborhood, which makes S inherently open.

    # 2. Closed: NOT ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    Counterexample: For f(x) where f(x)=x if x<=0 and f(x)=-x if x>0, S = R \ {0}, which is not closed.

    # 3. Connected: NOT ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    Counterexample: S = R \ {0} is not connected.

    # 4. Compact: NOT ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    Counterexample: For f(x)=x, S = R^n, which is not compact for n>=1.

    # 5. Dense: ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    The complement S^c is a union of lower-dimensional affine subspaces where different isometries are "stitched".
    #    This set has an empty interior, so S is dense.

    # 6. Connected complement: NOT ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    Counterexample: A function can be constructed where S = R \ {-1, 1}. The complement S^c = {-1, 1} is not connected.

    # 7. Trivial first singular homology group: NOT ALWAYS TRUE.
    #    Counterexample: A function can be constructed in R^2 where S is the plane minus three lines forming a triangle.
    #    This set has a non-trivial H_1 group.
