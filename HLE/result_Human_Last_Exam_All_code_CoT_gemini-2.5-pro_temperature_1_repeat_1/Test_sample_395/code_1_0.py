# Number of sets
n = 2024
# Size of each set
k = 45
# Size of pairwise intersection

# According to a theorem in combinatorics, if n > k^2 - k + 1,
# then all sets must share a common element.
# Let's check this condition.

# if n > condition_value:
# The only possible structure is a "sunflower" with a central element common to all sets.

# The size of the union for a sunflower structure is 1 (the central element)
# plus the sum of the sizes of the remaining parts of the sets.
# Each remaining part has size k - 1.
# There are n such parts, and they are all disjoint.
k_prime = k - 1
union_size = 1 + n * k_prime
