    "This problem requires finding the Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the `ϕ^4` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions. This is a classic result in the study of critical phenomena and the renormalization group.\n\nHere is the plan to derive the expression:\n1.  **Start with the Beta Function**: The core of the renormalization group flow is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale `μ`. For the `ϕ^4` theory near four dimensions, the one-loop beta function is given by:\n    `β(u) = μ (du/dμ) = -ϵu + (3 / (16π²))u² + O(u³)`\n2.  **Find the Fixed Point**: A fixed point, `u*`, is a value of the coupling where the flow stops, meaning `β(u*) = 0`. This corresponds to a scale-invariant theory.\n3.  **Solve for u***: We will set the beta function to zero and solve for `u*`. The equation `β(u*) = 0` has two solutions:\n    *   `u* = 0`: This is the trivial Gaussian fixed point, corresponding to a free theory.\n    *   A non-trivial solution: This is the Wilson-Fisher fixed point, which controls the critical behavior of systems like the Ising model near their critical temperature.\n4.  **Isolate the Non-trivial Solution**: By solving `-ϵu* + (3 / (16π²))(u*)² = 0`, we can find the expression for the non-trivial fixed point `u*` in terms of `ϵ`.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic manipulations and present the final expression.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_wilson_fisher_fixed_point():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the leading order expression for the\n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling in phi^4 theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the necessary symbols.\n    # u: the coupling constant\n    # epsilon: the small parameter in d = 4 - epsilon\n    # pi: the mathematical constant pi\n    u, epsilon, pi = sympy.symbols('u* ε π')\n\n    # Step 2: Define the one-loop beta function for phi^4 theory.\n    # The term '-epsilon * u' comes from the canonical dimension of the coupling.\n    # The term '(3 / (16*pi**2)) * u**2' is the one-loop quantum correction.\n    beta_u_expr = -epsilon * u + (3 / (16 * pi**2)) * u**2\n\n    print(\"The one-loop beta function for the ϕ⁴ theory in d = 4 - ε dimensions is:\")\n    print(f\"β(u) = -ε*u + (3 / (16*π²))*u²\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the fixed point by solving beta(u*) = 0.\n    # A fixed point is a value of the coupling where the beta function is zero.\n    fixed_point_solutions = sympy.solve(beta_u_expr, u)\n\n    print(\"\\nTo find the fixed points, we solve the equation β(u*) = 0:\")\n    print(f\"-ε*u* + (3 / (16*π²))(u*)² = 0\")\n\n    # The solutions are a list.
