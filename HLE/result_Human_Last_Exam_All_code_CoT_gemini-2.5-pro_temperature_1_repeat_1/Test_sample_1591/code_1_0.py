# Step 1: Define the known initial condition component from BC3.
x0_2 = 10**20

# Step 2: From the analysis of BC2, we deduced a relationship between x0_1 and x0_2
# by assuming r=1 for the problem to be well-posed.
# The relationship is x0_1 = sqrt(3) * x0_2.
x0_1 = math.sqrt(3) * x0_2

# Step 3: The target expression simplifies to (x0_1)^2 + (x0_2)^2.
# We calculate the two terms of this sum.
term1 = x0_1**2
term2 = x0_2**2

# Step 4: Calculate the final result.
result = term1 + term2

# Step 5: Print the final calculation step-by-step as requested.
# The final equation is the sum of the squared components of the initial vector x0.
