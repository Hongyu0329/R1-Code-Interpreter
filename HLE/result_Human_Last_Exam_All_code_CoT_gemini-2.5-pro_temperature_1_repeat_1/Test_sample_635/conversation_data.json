    "To find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Express H(s) with a common denominator:** First, we will rewrite the given matrix $H(s)$ as $H(s) = \\frac{1}{d(s)}P(s)$, where $d(s)$ is the least common multiple of all denominators in $H(s)$, and $P(s)$ is a polynomial matrix.\n2.  **Find a left factorization:** We will search for a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is also a polynomial matrix. This provides a left factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$. This involves setting up and solving conditions on the elements of $D(s)$.\n3.  **Choose a minimal D(s):** We will select the simplest, lowest-degree polynomial entries for $D(s)$ that satisfy the conditions and result in a non-singular $D(s)$.\n4.  **Calculate N(s):** With the chosen $D(s)$, we will compute the corresponding $N(s)$.\n5.  **Check for coprimeness:** Finally, we will verify that the resulting matrices $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime. Two polynomial matrices are left coprime if the composite matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex numbers $s$. This can be checked by ensuring that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all its full-size minors is a non-zero constant.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation\n\n1.  **Common Denominator Form**\n    The given transfer function is:\n    \\[ H(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    The denominators are $(s+1)$ and $(s^2-1) = (s+1)(s-1)$. The least common denominator is $d(s) = s^2-1$.\n    Rewriting $H(s)$ with this common denominator:\n    \\[ H(s) = \\frac{1}{s^2-1} \\begin{bmatrix} (s-1)^2 & s^2-1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n2.  **Finding a Left Factorization**\n    We need to find a polynomial matrix $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$ such that $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$ is a polynomial matrix.\n    \\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11} \\\\ d_{21}\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21} \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    For $N(s)$ to be polynomial, $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{21}(s)$ must be polynomials. The off-diagonal entries impose no further constraints. For the diagonal entries, the denominators must be cancelled.\n    This leads to the following conditions on the elements of $D(s)$:\n    -   For the (1,1) element: $d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n    -   For the (2,1) element: $d_{21}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)$ must be divisible by $s^2-1$.\n\n3.  **Choosing a Minimal D(s)**\n    Let's find the simplest polynomials that satisfy these divisibility conditions.\n    Consider the first row. The condition $d_{11}(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)$ must be zero at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n    -   At $s=1$: $d_{11}(1)(0)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$.\n    -   At $s=-1$: $d_{11}(-1)(-2)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n    Let's try the simplest choices. Let $d_{11}(s) = 1$. Then $4(1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(-1)=-2$. Since we also need $d_{12}(1)=0$, a simple choice for $d_{12}(s)$ is a linear polynomial $d_{12}(s) = a(s-1)$. Then $a(-1-1)=-2 \\implies -2a=-2 \\implies a=1$. So, $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n    Thus, for the first row, we have $d_{11}(s) = 1$ and $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n\n    Consider the second row. The conditions are similar: $d_{22}(1)=0$ and $4d_{21}(-1)+2d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n    Let's try to make $D(s)$ upper triangular for simplicity. We set $d_{21}(s) = 0$. This gives $4(0) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n    So, $d_{22}(s)$ must have roots at $s=1$ and $s=-1$. The simplest such non-zero polynomial is $d_{22}(s) = (s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$.\n    This gives the candidate matrix:\n    \\[ D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n4.  **Calculate N(s)**\n    Now we compute $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n    \\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    \\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 \\\\ 0 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s^2-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\cdot 1 + (s^2-1) \\cdot 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    \\[ N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s+1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n\n5.  **Check for Coprimeness**\n    We check the rank of $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$:\n    \\[ [D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n    The rank of this 2x4 matrix is 2 if at least one 2x2 minor is a non-zero constant. Let's compute the minor formed by the 1st and 3rd columns:\n    \\[ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 2 \\]\n    Since this minor is a non-zero constant, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all values of $s$. Therefore, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are left coprime.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to define and print the matrices for the left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s)N(s)$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_factorization():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints a left coprime factorization for the given transfer function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable s\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the calculated polynomial matrices D(s) and N(s)\n    D = sympy.Matrix([[1, s - 1],\n                      [0, s**2 - 1]])\n\n    N = sympy.Matrix([[1, 1],\n                      [2, 0]])\n\n    # Print the factorization equation and the matrices\n    print(\"A left coprime factorization H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s) is given by:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nD(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(D, use_unicode=True)\n    \n    print(\"\\nN(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(N, use_unicode=True)\n\n    # The final equation is H(s) = D(s)^-1 * N(s), where each matrix is:\n    print(\"\\nIn equation form:\")\n    print(\"H(s) = \")\n    sympy.pprint(D.inv(), use_unicode=True)\n    print(\" * \")\n    sympy.pprint(N, use_unicode=True)\n\n\nsolve_factorization()\n```\n<<<D(s) = [[1, s - 1], [0, s**2 - 1]], N(s) = [[1, 1], [2, 0]]>>>"
