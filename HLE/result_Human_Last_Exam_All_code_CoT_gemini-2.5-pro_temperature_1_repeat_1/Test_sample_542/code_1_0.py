# Based on the analysis, the problem is constructed such that the two distributions
# P_det(A) and Q_det(B) are intended to be identical.
# If P = Q, the Renyi divergence Div_a(P || Q) is 0 for any a > 1.
# The function ell(a) is defined as:
# ell(a) = (a - 1) * Div_a(P || Q)
# Therefore, ell(a) = (a - 1) * 0 = 0.

# The final equation is ell(a) = 0.
final_answer = 0

# The instruction "output each number in the final equation!" might be a bit ambiguous
# when the result is a constant value of 0. We will present the final value directly.
