    "Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Current Word:** The current Modern English word for a female sibling is \"sister\". I need to find its origin. A quick etymological check reveals it comes from the Old Norse word \"systir,\" which was brought to England by Viking invaders and settlers.\n\n2.  **Identify the Native Word:** Since \"sister\" is a loanword, there must have been a native Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word that it replaced. This word was \"sweostor\".\n\n3.  **Trace the Hypothetical Evolution:** Now, I need to determine how \"sweostor\" would have evolved into Modern English if it hadn't been replaced. We can do this by looking at how other similar Old English words changed over time.\n    *   Let's take a comparable family relationship word: \"brōþor\" (brother). The \"ō\" sound shortened, and the \"-or\" ending became \"-er\". This gave us \"brother\".\n    *   Let's take another: \"mōdor\" (mother). Similarly, this became \"mother\".\n    *   The Old English diphthong \"eo\" in \"sweostor\" typically simplified to \"e\" in Middle English, especially in this context (compare Old English \"heofon\" -> \"heaven\"). The unstressed ending \"-or\" would almost certainly reduce to \"-er\", following the pattern of \"brother\" and \"mother\".\n\n4.  **Construct the Modern Form:** Applying these sound changes to \"sweostor\":\n    *   `sw` remains `sw`.\n    *   `eo` becomes `e`.\n    *   `st` remains `st`.\n    *   `or` becomes `er`.\n    *   This gives us the hypothetical form: **swester**.\n\n5.  **Corroborate the Finding:** This isn't just a guess. The word \"swester\" is actually attested in Middle English texts, existing alongside the Old Norse borrowing \"sister\". Over time, \"sister\" won out and became the standard, while \"swester\" fell into disuse. However, its existence confirms our projected evolutionary path. Related words in other Germanic languages, like German \"Schwester\" and Dutch \"zuster,\" further support this root.\n\n6.  **Final Conclusion:** If the Norse had never introduced \"systir\" into the language, the native Old English \"sweostor\" would have continued its natural development, resulting in the Modern English word \"swester\".\n\n```python\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script explains and determines what the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    would be without the historical influence of the Old Norse language.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
