# The problem asks for the product of a Wittig reaction.
# Reactant 1 (aldehyde): Pivalaldehyde, (CH3)3C-CHO
# Reactant 2 (ylide): (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-l5-phosphane, (2-Cl-C6H4)-CH2-CH=P(Ph)3

# In a Wittig reaction, the oxygen of the aldehyde is swapped with the ylide's carbon group
# to form a new C=C double bond.
# The reaction is:
# (CH3)3C-CH=O + (2-Cl-C6H4)-CH2-CH=P(Ph)3  -->  (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-C6H4) + O=P(Ph)3

# The main organic product's structure is (CH3)3C-CH=CH-CH2-(2-Cl-C6H4).
# This structure is named according to IUPAC rules.
# The ylide is non-stabilized, which generally favors the Z-isomer as the major product.
product_name = "(Z)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethylpent-2-ene"

print(f"The name of the main organic product from the Wittig reaction is:")
print(product_name)

# The prompt requires outputting each number in the final equation/name.
# The numbers in the IUPAC name specify the locations of substituents and functional groups.
