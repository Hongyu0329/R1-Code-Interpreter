# Plan:
# The problem asks for the minimum of 1000*m + n, where m and n are properties
# of a matrix F whose determinant defines a geometric condition on 5 points in R^3.
#
# 1. The geometric condition is equivalent to the 5 points lying on a common ruled quadric surface.
# 2. The equation for this condition is a single irreducible polynomial of degree 12.
# 3. The determinant of F, det(F), must be this polynomial (or a power of it).
#    The degree of det(F) is n * m. So, n * m must be a multiple of 12.
# 4. To minimize 1000*m + n, we should choose the smallest possible m.
#    Let's assume the simplest case where det(F) is the polynomial itself, so n * m = 12.
# 5. The possible integer pairs (m, n) are (1,12), (2,6), (3,4), (4,3), (6,2), (12,1).
# 6. We must use a pair (m, n) for which a determinantal representation is known to exist.
# 7. A known construction from algebraic geometry (Schofield's resultant for a specific quiver)
#    provides a matrix F with m=3 and n=4.
# 8. While pairs with smaller m give a theoretically smaller value for 1000m+n (e.g., m=1, n=12 gives 1012),
#    the existence of such a matrix is not guaranteed or easily established.
# 9. Therefore, we rely on the known existing construction.
