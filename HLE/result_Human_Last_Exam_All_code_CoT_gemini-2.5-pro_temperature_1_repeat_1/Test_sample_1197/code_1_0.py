        "Step 5: Conclude. When adaptive evolution is strong, it causes changes in the genome (especially in nonsynonymous sites that alter proteins) to occur much more often than random drift would predict. This directly contradicts and 'outweighs' the predictions of a drift-based model, making it the most significant challenge. The other options describe genomic complexities but do not pinpoint this fundamental opposing force."
