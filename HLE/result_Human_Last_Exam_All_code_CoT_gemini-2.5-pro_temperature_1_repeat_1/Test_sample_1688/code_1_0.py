They are designed to prevent an adversary from learning the key in the first place. However, the question assumes the adversary *already has* the key. Once the key is compromised, these methods offer no further protection for data encrypted with it.\n")

PFS ensures that stealing a long-term key doesn't compromise past session keys. Fast rotation ensures a stolen key is only valid for a short period. While essential, they do not make the system secure *at the moment* an adversary has the *current* key.\n")
