# This script calculates the limit of the sequence g_n based on number-theoretic analysis.

# Based on the analysis, the prime factorization of the limit L is determined by the
# minimum q-adic valuations of P(p) over all large primes p.
# L = 2^v2 * 3^v3 * 5^v5 * ...

# For q=2, the minimum valuation v_2(P(p)) is 10.
v2_L = 10

# For q=3, the minimum valuation v_3(P(p)) is 2.
v3_L = 2

# For q=5, the minimum valuation v_5(P(p)) is 1.
v5_L = 1

# For q > 5, the minimum valuation v_q(P(p)) is 0.

# Calculate the terms of the final product
base_2 = 2
term_2 = base_2**v2_L

base_3 = 3
term_3 = base_3**v3_L

base_5 = 5
term_5 = base_5**v5_L

# Calculate the final limit L
limit_L = term_2 * term_3 * term_5

# Print the final calculation as an equation
print("The limit L is the product of its prime power factors:")
print(f"{base_2}^{v2_L} * {base_3}^{v3_L} * {base_5}^{v5_L} = {term_2} * {term_3} * {term_5} = {limit_L}")
