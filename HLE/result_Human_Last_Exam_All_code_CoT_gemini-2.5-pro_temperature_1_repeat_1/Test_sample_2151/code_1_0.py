# Step 1: Define initial values at (x,t)=(0,0) from the problem statement.
# u(0,0) = -2 + (1 - tanh(0)) / (e^0 + 1) = -2 + 1/2 = -1.5
u_0_0 = -1.5
# u_t(0,0) = (1/4)*(tanh(0)-1)*sech(0/2)^2*(tanh(0)-sech(0)-2) = (1/4)*(-1)*(1)^2*(-3) = 0.75
ut_0_0 = 0.75

# Step 2: Values of spatial derivatives at (0,0), derived from u(x,0).
# These are calculated by differentiating u(x,0) and evaluating at x=0.
ux_0_0 = -0.75
uxx_0_0 = 0.5

# Step 3: Use the PDE to find u_tt(0,0).
# The PDE: u_t + (1/8)u_tt + u*u_x - (1/8)u_xx - (u-1)u(u+2) = 0
# Rearranged for u_tt: u_tt = 8 * [ (u-1)u(u+2) - u_t - u*u_x + (1/8)u_xx ]
poly_term_0_0 = (u_0_0 - 1) * u_0_0 * (u_0_0 + 2)
utt_0_0 = 8 * (poly_term_0_0 - ut_0_0 - u_0_0 * ux_0_0 + (1/8) * uxx_0_0)

# Step 4: Use the Taylor series expansion to approximate u(0,1).
# u(0,t) approx u(0,0) + u_t(0,0)*t + 0.5*u_tt(0,0)*t^2
t = 1
u_0_1 = u_0_0 + ut_0_0 * t + 0.5 * utt_0_0 * t**2

# Step 5: Calculate the final quantity.
result = -u_0_1 / 2

# Print the final equation with all the numbers
