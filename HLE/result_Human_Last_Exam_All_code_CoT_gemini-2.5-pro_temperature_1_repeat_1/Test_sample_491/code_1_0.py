    Solves the described bargaining problem by following these steps:
    1. Calculates Player 1's payoff in the Subgame Perfect Equilibrium (SPE).
    2. Calculates Player 1's optimal payoff against the specified opponent.
    3. Finds the difference between these two payoffs as a fraction of polynomials, p(d)/q(d).

    # --- Part 1: Standard SPE Payoff for Player 1 ---
    # In a standard Rubinstein-Stahl game, Player 1's SPE payoff is 1 / (1 + d).
    V_spe = 1 / (1 + d)

    # --- Part 2: Payoff against the specific Player 2 ---
    # First, we calculate the expected payoff for Player 2 in their "Reject" simulation.
    # In the simulation, let E_sim be the expected payoff for a player whose turn it is.
    # The recurrence relation is E_sim = (1/2)*E[payoff from acceptance] + (1/2)*E[payoff from rejection].
    # E[payoff from acceptance] for the opponent of the proposer is E[1 - offer_share], where offer_share ~ U(0,1).
    # This is 1 - E[U(0,1)] = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.
    # E[payoff from rejection] is d * E_sim.
    # So, the equation is E_sim = (1/2)*0.5 + (1/2)*d*E_sim, which simplifies to E_sim = 0.25 + 0.5*d*E_sim.
    # We solve for E_sim:
    E_sim = sympy.Rational(1, 4) / (1 - sympy.Rational(1, 2) * d)

    # When Player 2 considers rejecting Player 1's offer, the pie shrinks by d and it becomes
    # Player 2's turn. So the expected payoff from the R-simulation is d * E_sim.
    E_R = d * E_sim

    # Player 2 will accept Player 1's offer x if Player 2's share (1-x) is at least E_R.
