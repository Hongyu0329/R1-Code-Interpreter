    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we need to combine the firing strength of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′)`, with the firing strength of the consequent part, `μG_k_j(y_j)`, using a t-norm operation.\n\nA t-norm is a function that models the logical AND operation in fuzzy logic. The most common t-norm is the minimum operator. I will use this for the calculation.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the given values: `Phi_k(x′) = 0.7` and `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n2.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values. The rule activation level will be `min(0.7, 0.9)`.\n3.  Calculate the result.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_rule_activation_level():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the rule activation level for an interval type-3 fuzzy set\n    using a minimum t-norm operation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given values for the firing strengths\n    phi_k_x_prime = 0.7\n    mu_G_k_j_y_j = 0.9\n\n    # The rule activation level is calculated by applying a t-norm to the\n    # antecedent and consequent firing strengths. We will use the minimum t-norm,\n    # which is the most common choice.\n    # Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\n    activation_level = min(phi_k_x_prime, mu_G_k_j_y_j)\n\n    # Print the details of the calculation\n    print(\"Calculating the rule activation level using the minimum t-norm:\")\n    print(f\"Rule Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\n    print(f\"Rule Activation Level = min({phi_k_x_prime}, {mu_G_k_j_y_j})\")\n    print(f\"The final rule activation level is: {activation_level}\")\n\n# Execute the function\ncalculate_rule_activation_level()\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
