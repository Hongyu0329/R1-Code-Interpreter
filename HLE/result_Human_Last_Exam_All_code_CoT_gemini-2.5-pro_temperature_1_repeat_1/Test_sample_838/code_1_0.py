print(f"The starting material, {starting_material}, is reacted with potassium tert-butoxide.")
print("This is an E2 elimination reaction. The strong, bulky base favors the Hofmann rule, creating the less substituted alkene.")

print("--- Step 2: Formation of Product B ---")
print(f"Product A, {product_a}, undergoes hydroboration-oxidation.")
print("This reaction results in the anti-Markovnikov addition of H and OH across the double bond.")

# Explain Reaction 3
print("--- Step 3: Formation of Product C ---")
print(f"Product B, {product_b}, is treated with phosphorous tribromide (PBr3).")
