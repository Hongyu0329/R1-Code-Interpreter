    "To compute the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, we'll follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Find the defining polynomial for $m_{p/q}$**. For a rational number $r = p/q$, the generalized Markov number $m_{p/q}$ is the largest root of the quadratic equation $q^2x^2 - (3pq - 2k)x + (p^2 + 1) = 0$. The integer $k$ is determined by the congruence relation $p^2 + 1 \\equiv kp \\pmod q$, with the condition $0 < k \\le q$.\n\n2.  **Solve for $p/q = 4/7$**. We identify $p=4$ and $q=7$. We will solve for $k$.\n\n3.  **Solve the quadratic equation**. We will substitute the values of $p, q, k$ into the equation and find the largest root, which is $m_{4/7}$. The root will be a quadratic irrational of the form $\\frac{A + \\sqrt{B}}{C}$.\n\n4.  **Compute the continued fraction**. Using the standard algorithm for finding the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational, we will compute the sequence of coefficients. This algorithm is guaranteed to terminate with a repeating cycle.\n\n5.  **Format the output**. The final result will be presented as a continued fraction with its pre-period (non-repeating part) and periodic part (repeating part) clearly indicated.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1 & 2: Find k for the quadratic equation\n    k = -1\n    for i in range(1, q + 1):\n        if (p**2 + 1) % q == (i * p) % q:\n            k = i\n            break\n            \n    if k == -1:\n        print(f\"Could not find a valid k for p={p}, q={q}.\")\n        return\n\n    # Step 3: Define and solve the quadratic equation\n    a_quad = q**2\n    b_quad = -(3 * p * q - 2 * k)\n    c_quad = p**2 + 1\n    \n    discriminant = b_quad**2 - 4 * a_quad * c_quad\n    \n    if discriminant < 0:\n        print(\"The discriminant is negative, the roots are complex.\")\n        return\n\n    # The generalized Markov number is the larger root\n    # m = (-b + sqrt(discriminant)) / (2a)\n    # The number is of the form (U0 + sqrt(D)) / V0\n    # Numerator: -b_quad = 3*p*q - 2*k\n    # Discriminant root: sqrt(discriminant)\n    # Denominator: 2*a_quad = 2*q**2\n    # We can simplify this representation.\n    # discriminant = (-(3pq-2k))^2 - 4(q^2)(p^2+1)\n    # After simplification, let's find the canonical form (U0 + sqrt(D)) / V0\n    \n    # From manual calculation for p=4, q=7:\n    # 49x^2 - 72x + 17 = 0\n    # m = (72 + sqrt(1852)) / 98 = (36 + sqrt(463)) / 49\n    \n    # Let's derive this programmatically.\n    # We need to find the largest integer s such that s^2 divides the discriminant.\n    s = int(math.sqrt(discriminant))\n    while s > 1:\n        if discriminant % (s**2) == 0:\n            break\n        s -= 1\n            \n    D = discriminant // (s**2)\n    U0_num = -b_quad\n    V0_num = 2 * a_quad\n    \n    common_divisor = math.gcd(U0_num, s)\n    common_divisor = math.gcd(common_divisor, V0_num)\n    \n    U0 = U0_num // common_divisor\n    V0 = V0_num // common_divisor\n    # The sqrt term was simplified by s\n    # So the term is (U0_num + s * sqrt(D)) / V0_num\n    # After simplifying by gcd, it's (U0 + s' * sqrt(D)) / V0\n    # where s' is s / common_divisor.
