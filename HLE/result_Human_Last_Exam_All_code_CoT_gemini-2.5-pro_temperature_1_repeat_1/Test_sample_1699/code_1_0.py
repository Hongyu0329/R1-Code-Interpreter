    # Analysis:
    # The problem is a life-and-death puzzle in Go (tsumego).
    # Black's goal is to find a move that guarantees the capture of all white stones.
    # This requires preventing the white stones from forming a living shape with two "eyes".
    #
    # The vital point on the board is (2, 4). This point is crucial for connecting
    # several of the white stones.
    #
    # By playing at (2, 4), Black achieves two critical goals:
    # 1. Puts the white stone at (2, 5) into "atari" (immediate danger of capture),
    #    forcing White to respond at (1, 5) to save it.
    # 2. Prevents White from connecting their stones at this vital point.
    #
    # This sequence of forcing moves allows Black to maintain the initiative (sente)
    # and systematically dismantle the white groups, leading to their eventual capture.
    # Other moves are too passive and allow White to play at (2, 4) and live.
