    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check Irreducibility**: First, we determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: For an irreducible quartic polynomial, the Galois group is a transitive subgroup of $S_4$. The nature of this subgroup is closely related to the properties of its resolvent cubic. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the resolvent cubic is $g(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$.\n3.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: We will find the roots of the resolvent cubic. The number of rational roots will tell us which family the Galois group belongs to.\n    *   If the resolvent cubic is irreducible (0 rational roots), the group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n    *   If the resolvent cubic is reducible (1 or 3 rational roots), the group is $D_4$, $C_4$, or $V_4$.\n4.  **Distinguish Between Candidate Groups**: Based on the roots of the resolvent cubic, we will be left with a few possibilities. In our case, we will find that the group is either $D_4$ (order 8) or $C_4$ (order 4). The final distinction is made by checking if the original polynomial $f(x)$ becomes reducible over the quadratic field defined by the irrational roots of the resolvent cubic.\n5.  **Compute the Order**: Once the Galois group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python code implements this procedure using the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic calculations.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import symbols, Poly, solve, sqrt\n\ndef solve_galois_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = symbols('x y')\n\n    # Step 1: Define the polynomial and check irreducibility\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    f = x**4 + p*x + q\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\")\n\n    # For p=2, the prime 2 divides 14 and 8, but not 1.
