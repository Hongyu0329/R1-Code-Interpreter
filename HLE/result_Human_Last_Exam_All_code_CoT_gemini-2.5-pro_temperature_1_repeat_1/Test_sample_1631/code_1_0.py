# The scientific basis for adding bypass notches in sheet metal forming is to
# manage how the material flows from the flat blank into the three-dimensional die cavity.

# When forming parts with complex shapes, such as those with small corner radii,
# the flow of the sheet metal can be severely restricted. This restriction
# can lead to excessive stretching, thinning, and ultimately tearing of the part.

# Bypass notches are strategically placed cuts in the initial blank that act as
# relief points. They allow material to flow more easily into these difficult-to-form
# areas, effectively "bypassing" the geometric restriction.

# This improved material flow prevents localized stresses and strains from exceeding
# the formability limits of the material.

# Therefore, the correct answer explains this function.

# Let's assign the chosen answer to a variable.
# A. Wrinkle formation. (Incorrect - wrinkles are managed differently, e.g., with blankholder force)
# B. Residual stresses. (Incorrect - this is a secondary effect, not the primary goal)
# C. Friction coefficient. (Incorrect - friction is managed by lubricants and coatings)
# D. Material inflow issues around complex geometries. (Correct - this is the primary purpose)
# E. Anisotropy. (Incorrect - this is a material property managed by blank orientation)
# F. Burr formation. (Incorrect - burrs are from cutting, not forming)
# G. Hydroforming effect. (Incorrect - managed by die venting)
# H. Rollover zones. (Incorrect - rollover is from cutting, not forming)
# I. Excessive thinning. (Partially correct, but this is a *result* of poor inflow. D is the root cause)
# J. Crack formation in bending. (Incorrect - this is a different failure mode in a different operation)
# K. Biaxial stretching. (Incorrect - this is a state of strain, not the problem itself)
