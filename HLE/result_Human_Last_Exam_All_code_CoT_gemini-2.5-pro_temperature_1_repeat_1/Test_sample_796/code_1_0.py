    This function determines the dimensions of the connected components
    of the configuration space X_4.

    The configuration space X_4 is the set of 4-segment unit-length robot arms
    that form a closed loop. This space is a real algebraic variety whose
    structure can be analyzed through stratification.

    1. The generic, non-singular part of the space forms a single connected
       manifold. Its dimension is 2*k - 3, where k=4. So, dim = 2*4 - 3 = 5.

    2. The singular points occur when all four segment vectors are collinear.
       For their sum to be zero, two vectors must be u and two must be -u
       for some unit vector u.

    3. The set of singular points is not connected. It decomposes into disjoint
       components. The number of components is the number of ways to choose which
       two vectors are u, which is C(4, 2) = 6.

    4. Each of these 6 singular components is parameterized by the choice of the
       unit vector u, which lies on the sphere S^2. Thus, each of these
       components is a manifold with the topology of S^2, which has dimension 2.

    5. The entire space X_4 is a disjoint union of the main 5-dimensional
       manifold and the six 2-dimensional manifolds. This decomposition into 7
       parts has the least possible number of components.

    The dimensions of these components, sorted in descending order, are (5, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).
