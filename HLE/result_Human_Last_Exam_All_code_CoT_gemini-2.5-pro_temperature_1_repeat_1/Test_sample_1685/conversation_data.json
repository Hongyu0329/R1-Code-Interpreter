    "To find an analytical expression that approximates the solution of the given third-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for large $x$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the behavior of the solution.** The initial conditions are $y(0) = 0$, $y'(0) = 3$, and $y''(0) = 2$. Since the first and second derivatives are positive at $x=0$, the function is initially increasing and convex. Evaluating the ODE at $x=0$ gives $y'''(0) = 0^4 + 3^4 - \\frac{2}{3(0)^2+2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan(0)+1} = 81 - 1 + 1 = 81$. The large positive value of $y'''(0)$ suggests that the solution will grow very rapidly. This type of growth often leads to a singularity (a vertical asymptote) at a finite value of $x$, let's call it $x_0$. The \"large $x$\" regime can be interpreted as the region where $x$ approaches this singularity $x_0$.\n\n2.  **Simplify the ODE by finding the dominant terms.** As $x$ approaches the singularity $x_0$, the values of $y(x)$ and its derivatives are expected to become very large. We can find the approximate form of the solution by determining which terms in the ODE are dominant in this regime. The original ODE is:\n    $y''' = y^{4} + y'^{4} - \\frac{y''}{3 x^{2} + 2} + \\frac{1}{\\tan{\\left(x \\right)} + 1}$\n    For a solution that blows up, the terms involving powers of $y$ and its derivatives ($y^4, y'^4$) will likely dominate over the other terms, which either decay with $x$ (like the $y''/(3x^2+2)$ term, assuming $y''$ doesn't grow too fast) or are bounded and oscillatory (the $\\tan(x)$ term). The dominant balance for such equations is typically between the highest derivative and the most nonlinear terms. A detailed analysis shows the dominant balance is between $y'''$ and $y'^4$, so the ODE simplifies to:\n    $y''' \\approx y'^4$\n\n3.  **Find the form of the approximate solution.** Let's solve the simplified equation. We can set $v = y'$, which turns the equation into $v'' \\approx v^4$. This type of equation often has power-law solutions of the form $v(x) = B(x_0-x)^{-\\beta}$. Substituting this into $v''=v^4$ and balancing the powers of $(x_0-x)$ gives $\\beta=2/3$.\n    So, the derivative of our solution has the form $y'(x) \\approx B(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$.\n    Integrating this with respect to $x$ gives the form of $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) \\approx \\int B(x_0-x)^{-2/3} dx = -3B(x_0-x)^{1/3} + C$\n    where $C$ is another integration constant.\n\n4.  **Use the initial conditions to find the constants.** We have an approximate form for the solution $y(x)$ and its derivatives:\n    $y(x) \\approx C - 3B(x_0-x)^{1/3}$\n    $y'(x) \\approx B(x_0-x)^{-2/3}$\n    $y''(x) \\approx \\frac{2}{3}B(x_0-x)^{-5/3}$\n    We can determine the unknown constants $x_0$, $B$, and $C$ by applying the initial conditions at $x=0$:\n    -   From $y'(0)=3$ and $y''(0)=2$:\n        $y'(0) = B(x_0)^{-2/3} = 3$\n        $y''(0) = \\frac{2}{3}B(x_0)^{-5/3} = 2$\n        Dividing the second equation by the first gives $\\frac{y''(0)}{y'(0)} = \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}x_0^{-1}$, which implies $x_0=1$.\n        Substituting $x_0=1$ back into the first equation gives $B(1)^{-2/3} = 3$, so $B=3$.\n    -   From $y(0)=0$:\n        $y(0) = C - 3B(x_0)^{1/3} = 0$\n        Substituting the values we found, $C - 3(3)(1)^{1/3} = 0$, which gives $C-9=0$, so $C=9$.\n\n5.  **State the final analytical expression.** We have found all the constants, so we can write the final approximate analytical expression for $y(x)$:\n    $y(x) \\approx 9 - 9(1 - x)^{1/3}$\n    The following Python code will print this expression with the coefficients rounded to two decimal places as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Coefficients derived from the analysis\nA = 9.0\nB = -9.0\nC = 1.0\nexponent_val = 1.0/3.0\n\n# Rounding the coefficients to two decimal places for the output expression\nA_r = round(A, 2)\nB_r = round(B, 2)\nC_r = round(C, 2)\nexponent_r = round(exponent_val, 2)\n\n# Print the final analytical expression, outputting each number\nprint(\"The approximate analytical expression for y(x) in the large x regime is:\")\nprint(f\"y(x) = {A_r:.2f} + {B_r:.2f} * ({C_r:.2f} - x)**{exponent_r:.2f}\")\n\n```\n<<<y(x) = 9.00 + -9.00 * (1.00 - x)**0.33>>>"
