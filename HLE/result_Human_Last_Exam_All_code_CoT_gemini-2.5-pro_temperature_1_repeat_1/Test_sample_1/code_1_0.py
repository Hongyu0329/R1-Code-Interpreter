# The reciprocal concept to "logical depth" is "algorithmic complexity".
# The third letter of "complexity" is 'm'.

# The missing word in Murray Gell-Mann's quote, "the two _ didn't commute," is "options".
# The third character of "options" is 't'.

# Step 3: Find c3, then c4

# The characters are all made lowercase as per the final instruction.
