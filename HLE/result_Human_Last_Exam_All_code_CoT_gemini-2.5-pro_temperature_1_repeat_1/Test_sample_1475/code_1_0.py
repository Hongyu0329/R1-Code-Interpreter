    # The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of a countable
    # intersection of open dense subsets of P(X).

    # 1. By the Baire Category Theorem, in a completely metrizable space,
    #    such an intersection is a dense subset of the space.

    # 2. The space P(X) can be shown to be a G_delta subset of the complete
    #    metric space 2^X. Therefore, P(X) is a completely metrizable space.

    # 3. This means the intersection, let's call it G, is a dense subset of P(X).
    #    The problem is now to find the minimum cardinality of a dense subset of P(X).

    # 4. The space P(X) can be shown to be a "perfect space", meaning it has no
    #    isolated points.

    # 5. A theorem in topology states that any dense subset of a perfect,
    #    separable, completely metrizable space has the cardinality of the continuum.
    #    P(X) meets these criteria.

    # 6. Therefore, the cardinality of the dense set G must be the cardinality
    #    of the continuum.
