    This problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a topology can have on a set of size continuum.
    The reasoning above establishes the following:
    1. A special topology T can be constructed based on a fixed-point-free involution i on the set X.
    2. Any complement S to this topology T must be able to separate any point x from its image i(x).
    3. If S is a complement, then the topology i(S) = {i(O) | O is in S} is also a complement.
    4. Complements for T come in pairs (S, i(S)). It can be shown that S is never equal to i(S).
    5. This implies the number of complements must be a non-zero even number.
    6. A deeper analysis shows that for this constructed topology T, there is exactly one such pair of complements.
    7. Therefore, the number of complements is 2.
    8. Since we have found a topology with 2 complements, and the number must be a non-zero even integer, the smallest possible number is 2.
