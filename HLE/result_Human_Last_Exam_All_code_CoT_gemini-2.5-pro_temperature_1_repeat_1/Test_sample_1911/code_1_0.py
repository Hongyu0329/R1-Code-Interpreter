    Analyzes the five statements about the set L = {(x,y) in R^2 : y = |x|}
    and identifies the false statement.
    """
    
    explanation = """
    Here is a step-by-step analysis of each statement:

    A. L can be given the structure of an immersed submanifold of R^2 with boundary.
       This is TRUE. The set L can be seen as the image of a smooth immersion from a 1-dimensional manifold with boundary (the disjoint union of two half-lines, (-inf, 0] and [0, inf)), which identifies the two boundary points at the origin.

    B. There exists a smooth curve gamma: R -> R^2 such that gamma(R) = L.
       This is TRUE. While simple parameterizations fail, a smooth curve can be constructed using non-analytic C-infinity functions. If we construct a smooth surjective function x(t) which is flat at its zeros, the curve gamma(t) = (x(t), |x(t)|) will be smooth and its image will be L.

    C. L can be given a smooth structure so that it is diffeomorphic to S^n for any n in N.
       This is FALSE. The set L is topologically homeomorphic to the real line R.
       - For n >= 1, the sphere S^n is compact, but R is not.
       - For n = 0, the sphere S^0 is two disconnected points, but R is connected.
       Since L is not homeomorphic to S^n for any n, it cannot be diffeomorphic.

    D. L can be given a smooth structure so it is diffeomorphic to a Lie group.
       This is TRUE. Since L is homeomorphic to R, we can give it the smooth structure of R. The set of real numbers with addition, (R, +), is a fundamental example of a Lie group.

    E. There exists a unique z in L such that L \\ {z} can be given the structure of a smooth manifold.
       This is TRUE, under the standard interpretation in this context that "can be given the structure" means "is a smooth submanifold of R^2".
       - If z = (0,0) (the origin), then L \\ {z} consists of two disjoint open rays. This is a smooth submanifold of R^2.
       - If z is any other point, L \\ {z} still contains the corner at the origin, which prevents it from being a smooth submanifold of R^2.
       Thus, the origin is the unique such point.

    Conclusion: Based on the analysis, statement C is the only one that is false.
