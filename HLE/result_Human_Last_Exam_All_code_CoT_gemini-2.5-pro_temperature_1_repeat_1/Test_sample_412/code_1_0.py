    Analyzes the provided options for the nonstandard analysis definition of continuity.
    
    The standard characterization of continuity of a function f at a standard point x0
    is that it maps points infinitesimally close to x0 to points infinitesimally close
    to f(x0). This must hold for all standard points x0 in the domain.
    
    Let's examine the options based on this principle:
    - A: Only considers standard points. Too weak.
    - B: States that if a nonstandard point x1 is infinitesimally close to a standard
         point x0, then f(x1) is infinitesimally close to f(x0). This is the correct
         and well-known nonstandard definition of continuity.
    - C: Requires the property to hold for any pair of infinitesimally close nonstandard
         points. This is a stronger condition equivalent to uniform continuity, not
         general continuity.
    - D, E, F: These are converses and are not equivalent to continuity. For example,
         a continuous function doesn't need to be injective, which is related to D.
         A simple continuous function like sin(x) fails E.
