    "To determine the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) of a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish an upper bound:** We will show that for any hypergraph `H` with `m` hyperedges, its `ghw(H)` is at most `m`. This provides an upper bound of 3 for our specific case.\n2.  **Establish a lower bound:** We will demonstrate the existence of a specific hypergraph with 3 hyperedges that achieves this upper bound. By finding an instance where `ghw(H) = 3`, we show that the maximum possible value is at least 3.\n3.  **Conclusion:** Combining the upper and lower bounds, we can conclude the exact maximum value.\n\nThis reasoning can be encapsulated in a Python script that explains the logic and prints the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hypertreewidth_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the maximum generalised hypertreewidth (ghw)\n    for a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    num_hyperedges = 3\n\n    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound\n    # The definition of generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) ensures that for any\n    # hypergraph H = (V, E), its ghw is less than or equal to the number of its\n    # hyperedges, |E|.\n    # This can be proven by constructing a simple, valid hyper-tree decomposition\n    # consisting of a single tree node 't'.\n    # In this decomposition, we set the edge-bag lambda_t = E (the set of all hyperedges)\n    # and the vertex-bag chi_t = V (the set of all vertices).\n    # The width of this decomposition is |lambda_t| = |E|.\n    # Since ghw is the minimum width over all possible decompositions, ghw(H) <= |E|.\n    upper_bound = num_hyperedges\n\n    # Step 2: Establish the lower bound by example\n    # We need to show that there exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges\n    # for which the ghw is exactly 3. This would mean that no decomposition\n    # of width 1 or 2 is possible for this specific hypergraph.\n    # A well-known example is the hypergraph H_3, sometimes called M_3.\n    # It is defined as follows:\n    # Number of hyperedges = 3. Let them be e1, e2, e3.\n    # Vertices are defined by their specific intersections:\n    # v1 is only in e1.\n    # v2 is only in e2.\n    # v3 is only in e3.\n    # v12 is in e1 and e2.\n    # v13 is in e1 and e3.\n    # v23 is in e2 and e3.\n    # So, E = {e1, e2, e3} where:\n    # e1 = {v1, v12, v13}\n    # e2 = {v2, v12, v23}\n    # e3 = {v3, v13, v23}\n    # For this hypergraph H_3, it can be proven that ghw(H_3) = 3.\n    # The proof shows that the cyclic dependencies between the three hyperedges,\n    # forced by the shared vertices, make it impossible to break them apart\n    # into smaller bags of size 2, thus requiring at least one bag in any\n    # decomposition to contain all three hyperedges.\n    lower_bound_for_max = 3\n\n    # Step 3: Conclusion\n    # From Step 1, the ghw for a hypergraph with 3 edges is at most 3.\n    # From Step 2, there exists a hypergraph with 3 edges that achieves a ghw of 3.\n    # Therefore, the maximum possible ghw is 3.\n    max_ghw = 3\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with a specific number of hyperedges.\")\n    print(f\"Number of hyperedges specified: {num_hyperedges}\")\n    print(f\"An upper bound for the generalised hypertreewidth is the number of hyperedges, which is {upper_bound}.\")\n    print(f\"A specific hypergraph with {num_hyperedges} hyperedges is known to exist which has a generalised hypertreewidth of {lower_bound_for_max}.\")\n    print(\"\\nCombining these two facts, we can conclude the maximum value.\")\n    print(f\"The maximum generalised hypertreewidth of a hypergraph with {num_hyperedges} hyperedges is {max_ghw}.\")\n\nsolve_hypertreewidth_problem()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
