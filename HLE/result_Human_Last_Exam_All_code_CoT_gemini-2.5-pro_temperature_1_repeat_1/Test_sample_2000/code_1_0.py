    # Step 1: Establish the upper bound
    # The definition of generalised hypertreewidth (ghw) ensures that for any
    # hypergraph H = (V, E), its ghw is less than or equal to the number of its
    # hyperedges, |E|.
    # This can be proven by constructing a simple, valid hyper-tree decomposition
    # consisting of a single tree node 't'.
    # In this decomposition, we set the edge-bag lambda_t = E (the set of all hyperedges)
    # and the vertex-bag chi_t = V (the set of all vertices).
    # The width of this decomposition is |lambda_t| = |E|.
    # Since ghw is the minimum width over all possible decompositions, ghw(H) <= |E|.
    upper_bound = num_hyperedges

    # Step 2: Establish the lower bound by example
    # We need to show that there exists a hypergraph with 3 hyperedges
    # for which the ghw is exactly 3. This would mean that no decomposition
    # of width 1 or 2 is possible for this specific hypergraph.
    # A well-known example is the hypergraph H_3, sometimes called M_3.
    # It is defined as follows:
    # Number of hyperedges = 3. Let them be e1, e2, e3.
    # Vertices are defined by their specific intersections:
    # v1 is only in e1.
    # v2 is only in e2.
    # v3 is only in e3.
    # v12 is in e1 and e2.
    # v13 is in e1 and e3.
    # v23 is in e2 and e3.
    # So, E = {e1, e2, e3} where:
    # e1 = {v1, v12, v13}
    # e2 = {v2, v12, v23}
    # e3 = {v3, v13, v23}
    # For this hypergraph H_3, it can be proven that ghw(H_3) = 3.
    # The proof shows that the cyclic dependencies between the three hyperedges,
    # forced by the shared vertices, make it impossible to break them apart
    # into smaller bags of size 2, thus requiring at least one bag in any
    # decomposition to contain all three hyperedges.
    lower_bound_for_max = 3

    # Step 3: Conclusion
    # From Step 1, the ghw for a hypergraph with 3 edges is at most 3.
    # From Step 2, there exists a hypergraph with 3 edges that achieves a ghw of 3.
    # Therefore, the maximum possible ghw is 3.
