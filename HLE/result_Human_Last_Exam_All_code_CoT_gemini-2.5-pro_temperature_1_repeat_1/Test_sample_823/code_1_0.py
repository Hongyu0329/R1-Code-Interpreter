    1.  The Problem: We are given a class of graphs C where all graphs have a maximum degree at most a constant 'd' and the class has unbounded treewidth. We need to find which statement must be true for C.

    2.  Analysis of Options:
        *   A (Induced cycles): False. Grid graphs are a counterexample.
        *   B (Grid subgraphs): False. Graphs with large girth are a counterexample.
        *   C (Expanders): False. Grid graphs are a counterexample.
        *   D (Induced matchings): True. This is a known result that for bounded degree graphs, large treewidth implies the existence of a large induced matching. This conclusion requires both premises (unbounded treewidth and bounded degree).
        *   E (Clique-minors): True. It is a fundamental theorem of graph minor theory that a class of graphs has unbounded treewidth if and only if it has clique-minors of unbounded size. This conclusion follows from the unbounded treewidth premise alone.

    3.  Conclusion: Both D and E are mathematically correct statements. However, we must choose the single best answer.
        *   Statement E ("unbounded clique-minors") is a property that is formally equivalent to the premise of "unbounded treewidth".
        *   Statement D ("unbounded induced matching") is a consequence of statement E (and the bounded degree property). Specifically, having an unbounded clique-minor size and a bounded degree forces the existence of an unbounded induced matching.
        *   The implication goes E -> D, but not D -> E. This makes E the stronger, more fundamental property. Therefore, E is the best answer.
