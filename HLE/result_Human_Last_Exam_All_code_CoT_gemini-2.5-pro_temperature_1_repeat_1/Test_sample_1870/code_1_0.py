The problem asks for the minimal possible length, denoted by δ, for a specific type of sequence of sets called a 'tower'. Let's break down the reasoning to find this value.

Step 1: Understanding the problem
The problem defines a tower <x_α : α < δ> of uncountable subsets of ω₁. The conditions are:
1. Each x_α is an uncountable subset of ω₁.
2. For α < β < δ, |x_β \\ x_α| is countable. This relation is often written as x_β is 'almost a subset' of x_α (x_β ⊆* x_α). This means the sequence is decreasing with respect to the ⊆* relation.
3. There is no uncountable set y that is 'almost a subset' of all x_α in the tower. This is a maximality condition, meaning the tower has no pseudo-intersection.

The minimal δ for which such a tower exists is a cardinal number known in set theory as the 'tower number' on ω₁, denoted t_{ω₁}.

Step 2: Finding a lower bound for δ
We can prove within ZFC (the standard axioms of set theory) that δ must be greater than ω₁.
The proof works by showing that any tower of length ω₁ cannot be maximal because it is always possible to construct a set 'y' that violates condition (3).
Let's consider a tower <x_α : α < ω₁>. We can construct an uncountable set 'y' that is almost a subset of every x_α.
The construction is a diagonalization argument:
a. First, we can refine the tower <x_α> into a nested tower <y_α> (where y_β is a true subset of y_α for α < β) such that each y_α is 'almost equal' to the corresponding x_α.
b. Then, we can construct an uncountable set 'y' by recursively picking elements from these sets. At each step β < ω₁, we pick an element y_β from Y_β that is larger than all previously picked elements. Because Y_β is uncountable and we are taking a supremum over a countable set of ordinals, such an element always exists.
c. The resulting set y = {y_β : β < ω₁} is uncountable. It can be shown that |y \\ y_α| is countable for all α < ω₁. This means 'y' is a pseudo-intersection for the tower <y_α>, and consequently for <x_α>.

This construction shows that any tower of length ω₁ is not maximal. Therefore, a tower satisfying all three conditions must have a length δ that is strictly greater than ω₁. Since δ is a cardinal number, this means δ must be at least ω₂.

Step 3: Determining the minimal possible value
The result from Step 2, δ ≥ ω₂, is provable in ZFC. However, the exact value of δ is not fixed by ZFC. Its value is 'independent', meaning it can be different in different models of ZFC.
The question asks for the 'minimal δ possible'. This is interpreted as asking for the smallest cardinal κ such that 'δ = κ' is consistent with ZFC.

From Step 2, we know the minimal possible value is at least ω₂.
It is a known result in set theory that it is consistent with ZFC for δ to be equal to ω₂. For example, in a model of set theory where the Continuum Hypothesis for ω₁ holds (i.e., 2^{ω₁} = ω₂), it follows that δ = ω₂.

Step 4: Conclusion
Since we can prove δ ≥ ω₂ from ZFC, and it is consistent with ZFC that δ = ω₂, the minimal possible value for δ is ω₂.
