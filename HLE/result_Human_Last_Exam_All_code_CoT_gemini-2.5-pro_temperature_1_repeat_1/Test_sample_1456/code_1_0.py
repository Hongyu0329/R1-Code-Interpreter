    # A key theorem in continuum theory states that the number of composants of a
    # nondegenerate continuum is either 1 or c. A continuum is nondegenerate if
    # it contains more than one point.
    # Examples:
    # - An arc or a circle has 1 composant (it's locally connected).
    # - The Knaster continuum or the pseudo-arc has 'c' composants.

    # --- Step 2: The rule for the product of two continua ---
    # For a product space Z = X x Y, the composants of Z are the Cartesian
    # products of the composants of X and the composants of Y.
    # This means the number of composants of the product is the product of the
    # number of composants of the factors:
    # |Composants(X x Y)| = |Composants(X)| * |Composants(Y)|

    # we must choose the largest possible number for each factor, which is 'c'.
