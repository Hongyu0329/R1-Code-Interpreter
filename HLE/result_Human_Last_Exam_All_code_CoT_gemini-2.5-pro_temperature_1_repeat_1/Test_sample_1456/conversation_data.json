    "This is a problem in the field of topology, specifically continuum theory. To solve it, we need to use a few key theorems. Here is my plan:\n\n1.  **State the possible number of composants for a single continuum:** First, I'll recall the theorem that specifies the possible cardinalities for the set of composants of any given nondegenerate continuum.\n2.  **State the rule for the number of composants of a product space:** Next, I'll use the theorem that relates the composants of a product space, like *X x Y*, to the composants of its factor spaces, *X* and *Y*.\n3.  **Combine the rules to find the maximum:** Finally, I'll combine these two facts to find the maximum possible number of composants for the product of two nondegenerate continua by choosing the maximum number for each factor and calculating their product using cardinal arithmetic.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It uses string variables to represent the concepts and prints the logical steps to arrive at the solution.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_composants_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and calculates the largest possible number of\n    composants of the product of two nondegenerate continua.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # In mathematics, 'c' is the standard symbol for the cardinality of the continuum,\n    # representing an uncountable infinity (the number of points on a line).\n    c_symbol = \"c\"\n    c_description = \"the cardinality of the continuum (an uncountable infinity)\"\n    c = f\"{c_symbol} ({c_description})\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Possibilities for a single continuum ---\n    # A key theorem in continuum theory states that the number of composants of a\n    # nondegenerate continuum is either 1 or c. A continuum is nondegenerate if\n    # it contains more than one point.\n    # Examples:\n    # - An arc or a circle has 1 composant (it's locally connected).\n    # - The Knaster continuum or the pseudo-arc has 'c' composants.\n\n    # --- Step 2: The rule for the product of two continua ---\n    # For a product space Z = X x Y, the composants of Z are the Cartesian\n    # products of the composants of X and the composants of Y.\n    # This means the number of composants of the product is the product of the\n    # number of composants of the factors:\n    # |Composants(X x Y)| = |Composants(X)| * |Composants(Y)|\n\n    # --- Step 3: Maximize the result ---\n    # To find the largest possible number of composants for the product,\n    # we must choose the largest possible number for each factor, which is 'c'.\n    max_composants_X = c_symbol\n    max_composants_Y = c_symbol\n\n    # The result is their product in cardinal arithmetic.\n    # c * c = c\n    max_composants_product = c_symbol\n\n    # --- Step 4: Output the reasoning and the final equation ---\n    print(\"Plan to solve the problem:\")\n    print(\"1.
