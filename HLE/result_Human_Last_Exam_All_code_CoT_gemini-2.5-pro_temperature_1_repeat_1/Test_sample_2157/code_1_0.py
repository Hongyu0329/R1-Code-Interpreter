# Step 1: Define the matrix for which the Ky Fan norm is to be calculated.
# Based on the logical deduction in the explanation, the matrix is the zero matrix.
# The size of the matrix is k x k, where k = 2^(n0+1) - 1. Since the final
# result is independent of the size, we can use an arbitrary size for demonstration, for example, 3x3.
k = 3
T_squared = np.zeros((k, k))

# Step 2: Calculate the singular values of the matrix.
# The singular values of a zero matrix are all zero.
singular_values = np.linalg.svd(T_squared, compute_uv=False)

# Step 3: Calculate the largest Ky Fan norm.
# The largest Ky Fan norm is the sum of all singular values (the nuclear norm).
largest_ky_fan_norm = np.sum(singular_values)

# Step 4: Display the final equation and result.
# The instruction is to "output each number in the final equation".
# The equation is the sum of the singular values.
equation_parts = [f"{s:.0f}" for s in singular_values]
equation_str = " + ".join(equation_parts)

print(f"The final equation is: {equation_str} = {largest_ky_fan_norm:.0f}")
print(f"The final result is: {largest_ky_fan_norm:.0f}")
