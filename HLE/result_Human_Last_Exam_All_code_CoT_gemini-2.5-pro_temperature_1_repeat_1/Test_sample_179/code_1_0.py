    # 2. The differential equation for X_0(t) is X'_0(t) = -(B + 1)X_0(t) + A.
    # This is a first-order linear ODE: X'_0(t) + k*X_0(t) = A, where k = B + 1.
    k = B + 1

    # 3. The general solution to this ODE is X_0(t) = A/k + C*exp(-k*t),
    # where A/k is the particular solution and C*exp(-k*t) is the homogeneous solution.
    # We use the boundary condition X_0(0) - X_0(T) = alpha1 to find the constant C.

    # X_0(0) = A/k + C
    # X_0(T) = A/k + C*exp(-k*T)
    # X_0(0) - X_0(T) = C * (1 - exp(-k*T))
    # Given that alpha1 = 0, we have C * (1 - exp(-k*T)) = 0.

    # For this equation to be true, either C = 0 or (1 - exp(-k*T)) = 0.
    # Let's check the value of exp(-k*T):
    # k*T = (1e-5) * (1e20) = 1e15.
    # exp(-1e15) is a number very close to 0, but it is not 1.
    # Therefore, (1 - exp(-k*T)) is not zero.
    # This forces the constant C to be 0.
