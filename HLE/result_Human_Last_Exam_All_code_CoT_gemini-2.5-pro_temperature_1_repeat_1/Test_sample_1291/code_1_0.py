    This script determines the type of Berkovich points based on the problem description.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1. The space of parameters is C_p^x * C_p. A pair (z_0, z) from this space
       naturally defines a disk D(z/z_0, 1/|z_0|_p).
    2. The radius of this disk is r = 1/|z_0|_p.
    3. Since z_0 is in C_p^x, its norm |z_0|_p must be in the value group p^Q, and |z_0|_p > 0.
    4. Therefore, the radius r must also be in p^Q and be positive.
    5. By definition, points in the Berkovich projective line corresponding to disks
       with radii in p^Q_{>0} are Type 2 points.
    6. The equivalence relation groups parameters that map to the same point, but does not change the type of point produced.
    
    Thus, the subset consists only of Type 2 points.
