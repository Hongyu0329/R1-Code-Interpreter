    # Analysis of each statement:
    # Statement I: Supported. It presents a valid perspective that adding a second drug (naloxone) can be seen
    # as making a formulation "less safe" due to potential for more side effects or the severe precipitated withdrawal if misused.
    # Statement II: Supported. It correctly identifies that Subutex is considered safer and is preferred for specific
    # populations, such as pregnant women or those with a naloxone allergy.
    # Statement III: Supported. It correctly states that when taken as prescribed, the two medications have a similar safety
    # profile because the naloxone in Suboxone has very low sublingual bioavailability.
    # Statement IV: Not supported. It incorrectly claims that the relative safety is largely unknown, which contradicts the
    # well-established clinical guidelines.
    # Statement V: Not supported. It contains a major factual error, stating the abuse-deterrent mechanism is due to a "lack of naloxone".
