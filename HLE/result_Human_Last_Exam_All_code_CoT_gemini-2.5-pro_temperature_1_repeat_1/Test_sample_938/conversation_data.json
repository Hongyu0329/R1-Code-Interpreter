    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Simplify the expression for $s_n$**: The formula for $s_n$ is quite complex. It involves two summations. I will first analyze the term $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$ from the second summation. By calculating the first few terms of the sequence $a_n$, I will look for a hidden identity for $T_k$. If a simple form for $T_k$ is found, I can simplify the entire expression for $s_n$.\n2.  **Analyze the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$**: Once $s_n$ is simplified, I will determine its behavior as $n$ approaches infinity. The sequence $a_n$ is a linear recurrence, so its long-term behavior is determined by the largest root (in absolute value) of its characteristic equation. Let's call this root $\\lambda$. I will show that $s_n$ grows approximately as $C \\cdot \\lambda^n$ for some constant $C$.\n3.  **Calculate the limit**: Using the asymptotic behavior of $s_n$, I will calculate the limit $L = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n}$. This limit will be a function of the dominant root $\\lambda$.\n4.  **Numerical Calculation**: The dominant root $\\lambda$ is a root of the polynomial $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. I will write a Python script to find this root numerically with high precision using Newton's method.\n5.  **Final Result**: Finally, I will use the value of $\\lambda$ to compute the integer part of $10^4 \\cdot L$.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations\n\n1.  **Simplifying $s_n$**:\n    Let's analyze $T_k = a_{k+1}a_{k-2}+a_{k+2}a_{k-3}+a_{k+3}a_{k-4}+57a_{k}a_{k-5}$. By computing the first few terms of the sequence $a_n$ ($a_0=1, a_1=0, a_2=0, a_3=88, a_4=57, a_5=0, a_6=7744, \\dots$), we can test a hypothesis for $T_k$. For $k=6$, we have $T_6 = a_7 a_4 + a_8 a_3 + a_9 a_2 + 57 a_6 a_1$. Using the computed values, we find $T_6 = (10032)(57) + (3249)(88) + 0 + 0 = 857736$. We also compute $a_{11} = 88a_8+57a_7 = 857736$. This suggests the identity $T_k = a_{2k-1}$.\n    Assuming this identity holds, we can simplify $s_n$:\n    $s_{n}=\\sum_{k=6}^{n}(a_{2k-3}+2a_{k+100}+7a_{k+51})-\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1}a_{2k-1}$\n    The first part of the sum can be split: $\\sum_{k=6}^{n} a_{2k-3} = a_9 + a_{11} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$.\n    The second sum is $\\sum_{k=6}^{n-1} a_{2k-1} = a_{11} + a_{13} + \\dots + a_{2n-3}$.\n    Their difference is simply $a_9$.\n    So, $s_n$ simplifies to: $s_n = a_9 + 2\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+100} + 7\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+51}$.\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Behavior and Limit**:\n    The characteristic equation of the recurrence is $x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$. Let $\\lambda$ be its largest positive root. For large $n$, $a_n \\approx c\\lambda^n$ for some constant $c>0$.\n    For large $n$, the term $2\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+100}$ dominates $s_n$ because it contains terms with the largest indices (up to $n+100$).\n    The sum $\\sum_{k=6}^{n}a_{k+100}$ is dominated by its last term, $a_{n+100}$. So, $s_n \\approx 2a_{n+100} \\cdot (\\text{constant}) \\approx C \\lambda^{n+100} = (C\\lambda^{100})\\lambda^n$.\n    Thus, we can find the limit:\n    $\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(s_{n})}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln{(C'\\lambda^n)}}{n} = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\ln(C') + n\\ln(\\lambda)}{n} = \\ln(\\lambda)$.\n    The problem asks for the integer part of $10^4 \\ln(\\lambda)$.\n\n3.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    I will now provide the Python code to perform the numerical calculation. The code finds the root $\\lambda$ of $f(x) = x^4 - 88x - 57 = 0$ using Newton's method and then computes the final value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the problem by:\n    1. Defining the characteristic polynomial f(x) and its derivative f'(x).\n    2. Using Newton's method to find the dominant root lambda.\n    3. Calculating the final value 10^4 * ln(lambda).\n    4.
