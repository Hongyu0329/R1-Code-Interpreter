    "An involution in a group is an element of order 2. To find the number of involutions in the projective special unitary group PSU(4, 997), we need to count the elements `gZ` such that `(gZ)^2` is the identity, where `g` is in the special unitary group SU(4, 997) and `Z` is its center.\n\nThis condition `(gZ)^2 = Z` means `g^2` must be an element of the center `Z`.\nFor G = SU(n, q), the center Z consists of scalar matrices `wI` where `w` is a `d`-th root of unity, and `d = gcd(n, q+1)`.\nIn our case, n=4 and q=997. So, `d = gcd(4, 997+1) = gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\nThe center is `Z = {I, -I}`, where `I` is the identity matrix.\nThus, the involutions in PSU(4, 997) correspond to elements `g` in SU(4, 997) such that `g^2 = I` or `g^2 = -I`.\n\nWe can therefore categorize the involutions into two types:\n1.  **Type 1:** Those arising from elements `g` in SU(4, 997) where `g^2 = I` (and `g` is not in the center). These correspond to the single non-central conjugacy class of involutions in SU(4, 997). The number of these involutions is given by the formula:\n    `N1 = q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)`\n\n2.  **Type 2:** Those arising from elements `g` in SU(4, 997) where `g^2 = -I`. These elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes in SU(4, 997). The number of elements in these classes are:\n    `N2_class1 = q^2 * (q^3 + 1)`\n    `N2_class2 = q^4 * (q + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1) * (q^2 + 1)`\n    The total number of such elements is `N2_total = N2_class1 + N2_class2`.\n    Each pair of elements `{g, -g}` maps to a single involution in PSU(4, 997). Since `q` is odd, `g` is never equal to `-g`. Therefore, the number of involutions of this type is half the total number of such elements `g`.\n    `N2 = (N2_class1 + N2_class2) / 2`\n\nThe total number of involutions in PSU(4, 997) is the sum `N1 + N2`.\n\nThe following Python code calculates these values for q=997 and prints the final result.\n\n```python\n# Set the value for q\nq = 997\n\n# --- Part 1: Involutions from g^2 = I ---\n# This corresponds to a single class of involutions in PSU(4,q).\n# The formula for the number of these involutions is q^4 * (q^2 + 1) * (q^2 - q + 1)\nn1 = q**4 * (q**2 + 1) * (q**2 - q + 1)\n\n# --- Part 2: Involutions from g^2 = -I ---\n# These arise from elements g in SU(4,q) such that g^2 = -I.\n# These elements fall into two conjugacy classes in SU(4,q).\n\n# Number of elements in the first class\nn2_class1 = q**2 * (q**3 + 1)\n\n# Number of elements in the second class\nn2_class2 = q**4 * (q + 1) * (q**2 - q + 1) * (q**2 + 1)\n\n# The number of resulting involutions in PSU(4,q) is half the total number of these elements.\nn2 = (n2_class1 + n2_class2) // 2\n\n# --- Total Number of Involutions ---\ntotal_involutions = n1 + n2\n\n# --- Print the results step-by-step ---\nprint(f\"For q = {q}:\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\nprint(\"1.
