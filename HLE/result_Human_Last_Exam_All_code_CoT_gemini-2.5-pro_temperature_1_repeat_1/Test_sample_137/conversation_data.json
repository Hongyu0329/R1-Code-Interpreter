    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of ramified covers from the Riemann sphere $\\mathbb{P}^1$ to itself of degree 7, with four specified branch points and their corresponding ramification profiles. This number is known as a Hurwitz number.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Monodromy Representation:** A ramified cover is characterized by its monodromy representation, which is a homomorphism from the fundamental group of the punctured sphere $\\pi_1(\\mathbb{P}^1 \\setminus \\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\})$ to the symmetric group $S_d$. This is equivalent to finding a tuple of permutations $(\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4)$ in $S_7$ such that:\n    *   The cycle type of each permutation $\\sigma_i$ matches the given ramification profile $\\mu_i$.\n    *   The product of the permutations is the identity: $\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_4 = 1$.\n    *   The group generated by these permutations, $\\langle \\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\sigma_3, \\sigma_4 \\rangle$, acts transitively on the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 7\\}$. For covers of $\\mathbb{P}^1$ (genus 0), the transitivity condition is automatically satisfied if the Riemann-Hurwitz formula holds, which we have verified in the thought process.\n\n2.  **Character Formula:** The number of such tuples, which we denote as $N$, can be calculated using a classical formula from the character theory of symmetric groups:\n    $$ N = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k |C_{\\mu_i}|}{d!} \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(S_d)} \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^k \\chi(\\mu_i)}{\\chi(\\text{id})^{k-2}} $$\n    where:\n    *   $d=7$ is the degree of the cover.\n    *   $k=4$ is the number of branch points.\n    *   $\\mu_1=(4,3), \\mu_2=(5,2), \\mu_3=(2,1^5), \\mu_4=(2,1^5)$ are the ramification profiles (partitions of 7).\n    *   $C_{\\mu_i}$ is the conjugacy class in $S_7$ corresponding to the partition $\\mu_i$.\n    *   $|C_{\\mu_i}|$ is the size of the conjugacy class.\n    *   The sum is over all irreducible characters $\\chi$ of $S_7$.\n    *   $\\chi(\\mu_i)$ is the value of the character $\\chi$ on the class $C_{\\mu_i}$.\n    *   $\\chi(\\text{id})$ is the dimension of the character $\\chi$.\n\n3.  **Calculation:**\n    *   We will use Python's `sympy` library to get the character table of $S_7$ and the sizes of the relevant conjugacy classes.\n    *   We will then implement the formula to compute the sum over all characters and multiply by the prefactor to get the integer result $N$.\n    *   The final output will be this number $N$, along with the equation showing the values used.\n\nThe code below carries out this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.partitions import Partition\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve_hurwitz_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Hurwitz number for a specific ramified cover of P^1.\n\n    The problem is to find the number of degree 7 covers of P^1 with four branch points\n    having ramification profiles (4,3), (5,2), (2,1,1,1,1,1), and (2,1,1,1,1,1).\n    This number corresponds to the count of monodromy tuples in S_7.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
