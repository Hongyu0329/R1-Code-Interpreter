    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which the quantity $P(x) = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the regions where $P(x)$ is non-negative.** A perfect square must be non-negative. We need to find the roots of $P(x)=0$ to determine the intervals where $P(x) \\ge 0$. By testing integer values, we can approximate the roots.\n    *   $P(-9) = -321$ and $P(-8) = 96$, so there's a root between -9 and -8.\n    *   $P(7) = 111$ and $P(8) = -32$, so there's a root between 7 and 8.\n    *   $P(16) = -96$ and $P(17) = 121$, so there's a root between 16 and 17.\n    Therefore, we must have $x$ in the integer intervals $[-8, 7]$ or $x \\ge 17$.\n\n2.  **Bound the search for large $x$.** For very large values of $x$, it's unlikely for $P(x)$ to be a perfect square. We can often show that $P(x)$ lies strictly between two consecutive squares.\n    *   For large $x$ that are not perfect squares, we can show that for $x \\ge 63$, the expression $xP(x)$ lies between two consecutive squares, $(x^2-8x-69)^2 < xP(x) < (x^2-8x-68)^2$. If $x$ is not a perfect square, $xP(x)$ cannot be a square of an integer, which implies $P(x)$ cannot be a perfect square.\n    *   For large $x$ that are perfect squares, let $x=k^2$. We can show that for $k \\ge 69$ (i.e., $x \\ge 69^2 = 4761$), the expression $P(k^2)$ lies between two consecutive squares, $(k^3-8k-1)^2 < P(k^2) < (k^3-8k)^2$, and thus cannot be a perfect square.\n\n3.  **Perform a finite search.** The analysis above shows that we only need to check a finite set of integers. The candidate integers for $x$ are:\n    *   The interval $[-8, 7]$.\n    *   The interval $[17, 62]$.\n    *   Perfect squares $x=k^2$ where $17 \\le k^2 < 4761$. This corresponds to $k$ from $5$ to $68$.\n\n    We will use a Python script to check all these candidates.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds all integer values of x for which the expression\n    x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    \n    # Define the ranges to check based on analysis\n    # Range 1: [-8, 7]\n    # Range 2: [17, 62]\n    # Range 3: Perfect squares k^2 for k from ceil(sqrt(17)) to 68.\n    # The code below combines these checks efficiently.\n    \n    checked_numbers = set()\n    \n    # Check the first interval\n    for x in range(-8, 8):\n        if x in checked_numbers:\n            continue\n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        if val >= 0:\n            s = int(math.sqrt(val))\n            if s*s == val:\n                solutions.append(x)\n        checked_numbers.add(x)\n    \n    # Check the second interval and the range of squares\n    # The upper limit is 68^2 = 4624, since for x >= 69^2, there are no solutions.\n    # The analysis showed that for x>=63, we only need to check perfect squares.\n    # The loop until 4625 covers all remaining candidates.\n    \n    for x in range(17, 4625):\n        if x in checked_numbers:\n            continue\n        \n        # For x>=63, only check if x is a perfect square\n        if x >= 63:\n            sqrt_x = int(math.sqrt(x))\n            if sqrt_x * sqrt_x != x:\n                continue\n\n        val = x**3 - 16*x**2 - 72*x + 1056\n        if val >= 0:\n            s = int(math.sqrt(val))\n            if s*s == val:\n                solutions.append(x)\n        checked_numbers.add(x)\n\n    print(\"The integer values of x for which the expression is a perfect square are:\")\n    for sol in sorted(solutions):\n        val = sol**3 - 16*sol**2 - 72*sol + 1056\n        s = int(math.sqrt(val))\n        print(f\"x = {sol}, expression = {val} = {s}^2\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nTotal number of integers is: {len(solutions)}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
