# The user wants to find the smallest possible number of equivalence classes
# for a special type of topological space X.

# Step 1: Analyze the properties of the space X and the equivalence relation ~.
#
# X is a continuum, which is a compact connected metric space.
#
# Property (1): The intersection of any two subcontinua is empty or connected.
# This means X is a "lambda-dendroid". A key consequence is that the
# union of two nowhere dense subcontinua with a non-empty intersection is
# also a nowhere dense subcontinuum. This ensures that the relation ~
# is transitive and therefore a proper equivalence relation.
#
# Property (2): There exist two points a, b in X such that no proper
# subcontinuum contains both {a, b}. This means X is "irreducible"
# between a and b.
#
# The relation: x ~ y if there exists a nowhere dense subcontinuum K
# such that {x, y} are both in K. A subcontinuum is nowhere dense if its
# interior is empty.

# Step 2: Establish a lower bound for the number of classes.
#
# Consider the points a and b from property (2). Can they be in the same
# equivalence class?
# For a ~ b to be true, there would need to be a nowhere dense subcontinuum K
# containing both a and b.
# However, property (2) states that the only subcontinuum containing both a and b
# is the entire space X.
# So, K would have to be X.
# A space X is never nowhere dense in itself (its interior is X, which is not empty).
# Therefore, X is not a nowhere dense subcontinuum of itself.
# This means no such K exists, so a is not equivalent to b (a ~ b is false).
#
# Since a and b are in different equivalence classes, there must be at least
# two classes.
lower_bound = 2

# Step 3: Check if this lower bound is achievable.
#
# We need to know if a continuum X exists that satisfies properties (1) and (2)
# and has exactly 2 equivalence classes.
#
# This is a known topic in the mathematical field of continuum theory.
# A "chainable continuum" is a specific type of lambda-dendroid, so it
# satisfies property (1).
# A theorem by D. P. Read (1962) states that any irreducible chainable continuum
# has exactly 2 equivalence classes.
#
# An irreducible chainable continuum satisfies property (1) (it's chainable)
# and property (2) (it's irreducible). Such continua are known to exist.
#
# Therefore, a space satisfying the given conditions can have exactly 2
# equivalence classes.
achievable_number = 2

# Step 4: Conclude the smallest possible number.
#
# Since the number of classes must be at least 2, and it is possible to
# construct a space with exactly 2 classes, the smallest possible number is 2.
smallest_possible_number = 2
