    This function determines the smallest integer dimension 'n' for which a specific
    Fourier extension inequality is known to fail.

    The inequality is:
    ||E f||_{L^p(X)} <= C_eps * R^eps * ||f||_{L^2}
    where p = 2n / (n-1).

    The analysis relies on known results from harmonic analysis regarding the
    Fourier restriction conjecture and local smoothing estimates.

    # Step 1: Analyze the problem for low dimensions.
    # For n=2, p = 2*2 / (2-1) = 4. The inequality is a version of the local
    # smoothing estimate in R^2, which is known to hold. The R^epsilon factor
    # is crucial here as it absorbs logarithmic divergences that appear in
    # related bilinear estimates.
    #
    # For n=3, p = 2*3 / (3-1) = 3. In this dimension, counterexamples to
    # related restriction estimates exist. These are based on Kakeya-type
    # geometric constructions ("hairbrush" or "plate" models). These constructions
    # require the space of normal directions to the paraboloid, R^(n-1), to have
    # at least dimension 2. This condition is n-1 >= 2, which means n >= 3.
    # These constructions show a power-law failure, which cannot be saved by
    # an R^epsilon factor.
    #
    # Conclusion: The inequality holds for n=2 but fails for n=3.
    # Therefore, the smallest possible dimension n for which the inequality
    # does not always hold is 3.
