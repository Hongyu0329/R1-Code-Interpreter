# The problem is a logic puzzle requiring the deduction of grammatical rules from a set of sentences,
# where exactly one sentence is incorrect.

# Rule 1: The final particle's first letter depends on the presence of the word 'esku'.
# - If 'esku' is present, the particle starts with 'k-'.
# - If 'esku' is absent, the particle starts with 'g-'.
# This rule holds for all sentences.

# Rule 2: For sentences with a 'k-' particle, a vowel harmony rule applies.
# The vowel in the particle is determined by the vowels in the sentence's subject (the first noun).
# Subjects with 'o'/'u' vowels (like 'Dokujet') require a particle with 'o' (ko-).
#   - Sentence 5: 'Dokujet' -> 'konej'. This is consistent.
#   - Sentence 11: 'Dokujet' -> 'kosaij'. This is consistent.
# Subjects with 'e'/'a' vowels (like 'Ketanne', 'Ezsue') require a particle with 'e' or 'a' (ke- or ka-).

# Violation: We check sentence 9 against these rules.
# Sentence 9 is: "Dokujet ketanne esku otazsij kaij."
# - It contains 'esku', so it correctly has a 'k-' particle ('kaij').
# - The subject is 'Dokujet'. According to the vowel harmony rule established from
#   sentences 5 and 11, 'Dokujet' must be paired with a 'ko-' particle.
# - Sentence 9 pairs 'Dokujet' with 'kaij', which violates this rule. The particle should
#   have been 'kosaij' to be consistent with sentence 11.

# Conclusion: Sentence 9 is the only one that breaks a consistent grammatical rule.
