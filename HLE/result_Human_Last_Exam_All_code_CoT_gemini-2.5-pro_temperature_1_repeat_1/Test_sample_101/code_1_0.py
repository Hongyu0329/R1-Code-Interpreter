Reasoning:
A student with 'emerging individual interest' is at a critical transition point. They have started to develop personal value for a topic but may lack the confidence or knowledge to pursue it independently.
Concrete feedback with immediate next steps provides the perfect scaffold. It builds their competence and self-efficacy, directly fueling the transition from situational interest to a stable, self-driven individual interest. This intervention has the most significant long-term developmental impact at this specific stage.
