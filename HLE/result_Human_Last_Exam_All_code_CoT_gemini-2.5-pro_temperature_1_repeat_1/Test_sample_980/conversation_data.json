    "An analysis of the sequence reveals a specific pattern involving triplets of numbers.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Structural Patterns:** The sequence contains several runs of identical numbers and, more importantly, triplets of the form `(x, y, x)`.\n2.  **Analyze a Triplet:** Let's examine the triplet `(49, 155, 49)` which appears in the sequence. The number immediately following this triplet is `62`.\n3.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Let's hypothesize a rule that connects the triplet to the number that follows it. A possible rule is that the next number is the first number of the triplet (`x`) plus the sum of its own digits.\n4.  **Verify the Hypothesis:**\n    *   For the triplet `(49, 155, 49)`, our `x` is `49`.\n    *   The sum of the digits of `x` is `4 + 9 = 13`.\n    *   Applying the rule: `x + sum_of_digits(x) = 49 + 13 = 62`.\n    *   This matches the number that follows the triplet in the sequence. The hypothesis holds.\n5.  **Apply the Rule to the End of the Sequence:** The sequence ends with what can be interpreted as another triplet: `(124, 36, 124)`. Here, `x` is `124`.\n6.  **Calculate the Next Number:** We apply the same rule to find the next number in the sequence.\n    *   `x = 124`.\n    *   The sum of the digits of `x` is `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`.\n    *   The next number is `124 + 7 = 131`.\n7.  **Generate Code:** Create a Python script to perform this calculation and print the final equation as requested.\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(n):\n  \"\"\"Calculates the sum of the digits of a number.\"\"\"\n  s = 0\n  for digit in str(n):\n    s += int(digit)\n  return s\n\n# The last triplet in the sequence is (124, 36, 124).\n# The rule is that the number following a triplet (x, y, x) is x + sum_of_digits(x).\nx = 124\ndigit_sum = sum_digits(x)\nnext_number = x + digit_sum\n\n# Output the final equation with each number.\nprint(f\"The next number is calculated from the last triplet's first number, {x}.\")\nprint(f\"The equation is: {x} + ({' + '.join(str(x))}) = {x} + {digit_sum} = {next_number}\")\nprint(f\"The next number in the sequence is: {next_number}\")\n\n```\n<<<131>>>"
