    "In a dance scene, the hierarchy of sound is crucial for immersing the audience and complementing the visual storytelling. My plan is to first establish the order of importance for the sound elements and then write a Python script to display this hierarchy.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  **Identify the Sound Elements:** The user listed \"speech, sound effects, music and \". The \"and\" suggests a fourth element was intended. In professional sound design, the four pillars are Dialogue (Speech), Music, Sound Effects (SFX), and Ambience. I will include Ambience as the fourth element to provide a complete answer.\n2.  **Determine the Hierarchy:**\n    *   **Music:** This is almost always the most important element. The dance is choreographed to the music's rhythm, tempo, and mood. It's the foundation of the scene.\n    *   **Sound Effects:** These are the sounds of the dance itselfâ€”footsteps, taps, the swish of clothing. They ground the scene in reality and provide a layer of physical texture that is vital to the performance's impact.\n    *   **Speech:** Dialogue is typically used minimally during a dance sequence, as the focus is on non-verbal expression. If present, it serves the plot but is less important than the music and core sound effects of the dance.\n    *   **Ambience:** This includes the background sounds of the location, like the murmur of a crowd or the acoustics of the room. It sets the scene but is mixed lowest to avoid interfering with the primary sounds.\n3.  **Construct the Python Code:** I will create a Python script that defines this hierarchy and prints it as a visual \"equation,\" as requested by the prompt to \"output each number in the final equation.\" This will clearly display the ranked order.\n\n```python\ndef sound_hierarchy_for_dance_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function defines and prints the hierarchy of sound importance in a typical film dance scene.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The four primary elements of film sound. \"Ambience\" is added to complete the user's list.\n    # The list is ordered from most to least important for a dance scene.\n    ranked_elements = [\"Music\", \"Sound effects\", \"Speech\", \"Ambience\"]\n\n    # The prompt asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # We will format the output as a visual equation showing the ranking.\n    equation_parts = []\n    for i, element in enumerate(ranked_elements, 1):\n        # We pair each element with its rank number.\n        equation_parts.append(f\"{i}. {element}\")\n\n    # Join the parts with a '+' to create the visual \"equation\".\n    final_equation = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    print(\"In a film's dance scene, the hierarchy of sound importance can be represented by the following equation:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsound_hierarchy_for_dance_scene()\n```\n<<<Music, Sound effects, Speech, Ambience>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
