    "This problem requires understanding concepts from arithmetic geometry, specifically the reduction of hyperelliptic curves modulo primes. A curve is said to have \"good ordinary reduction\" at a prime `p` if its reduction modulo `p` is a smooth (good) and ordinary curve. The question asks which curve has this property for primes `p > 2`.\n\nHere's the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Good Reduction**: A curve given by `z^2 = f(x)` has good reduction at an odd prime `p` if `p` does not divide the discriminant of the polynomial `f(x)`. We will calculate the discriminant for each option to find its primes of bad reduction. A curve with bad reduction at an odd prime `p` is a poor candidate.\n2.  **Ordinary Reduction**: For a prime `p` where the curve has good reduction, we must check if the reduction is \"ordinary\". A key test (Honda's criterion) states that for a genus `g` curve `z^2=f(x)`, the reduction at `p` is ordinary if the coefficient of `x^(p-1)` in the polynomial `f(x)^((p-1)/2)` is non-zero when taken modulo `p`. If the coefficient is zero modulo `p`, the reduction is \"supersingular\", not ordinary.\n3.  **Analysis**: We will test each curve. We will first find its primes of bad reduction. Then, for a small prime `p > 2` where the curve has *good* reduction, we will apply the ordinarity test. The correct answer will be the curve that consistently passes this test, while others fail.\n\nLet's execute this plan with Python. The code will compute the discriminant and then test for ordinarity at the first available small prime of good reduction (`p=3` or `p=5`).\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef get_poly_and_string(curve_id):\n    \"\"\"Returns the polynomial f(x) and its string representation for a given curve ID.\"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    polys = {\n        'A': x**5 + 3,\n        'B': x**5 - 1,\n        'C': x**6 - 1,\n        'D': 2*x**5 + 2*x**3 + 1,\n        'E': 4*x**5 + 4*x**3 + x**2 + 4*x\n    }\n    f = polys.get(curve_id)\n    # Using str() for a compact representation in the printout\n    curve_str = f\"z^2 = {str(f)}\"\n    return f, curve_str\n\ndef analyze_curve(curve_id):\n    \"\"\"Analyzes a curve for good ordinary reduction.\"\"\"\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n    f, curve_str = get_poly_and_string(curve_id)\n    print(f\"--- Analyzing Curve {curve_id}: {curve_str} ---\")\n\n    # 1.
