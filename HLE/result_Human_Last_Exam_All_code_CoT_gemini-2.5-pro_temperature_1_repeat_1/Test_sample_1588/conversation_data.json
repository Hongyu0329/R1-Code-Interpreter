    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The problem is equivalent to finding the number of basis elements of degree 10 in a free Lie algebra with two generators (representing the operators X and Y).\n\nThis number is given by Witt's formula:\n\n`L_k(n) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order, which is 10 in this case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nHere is the step-by-step calculation:\n1.  **Identify parameters**: `n = 10`, `k = 2`.\n2.  **Find the divisors of n=10**: The divisors `d` are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n3.  **Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor**:\n    *   `μ(1) = 1`\n    *   `μ(2) = -1`\n    *   `μ(5) = -1`\n    *   `μ(10) = μ(2*5) = μ(2) * μ(5) = (-1) * (-1) = 1`\n4.  **Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)` in the sum**:\n    *   For `d=1`: `μ(1) * 2^(10/1) = 1 * 2^10 = 1024`\n    *   For `d=2`: `μ(2) * 2^(10/2) = -1 * 2^5 = -32`\n    *   For `d=5`: `μ(5) * 2^(10/5) = -1 * 2^2 = -4`\n    *   For `d=10`: `μ(10) * 2^(10/10) = 1 * 2^1 = 2`\n5.  **Sum the terms and divide by `n`**:\n    *   Sum = `1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990`\n    *   Result = `990 / 10 = 99`\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation and prints the final equation with all the numbers.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of a number and their powers.\n    Example: get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp_num = num\n    while d * d <= temp_num:\n        while temp_num % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp_num //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_num > 1:\n        factors[temp_num] = factors.get(temp_num, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Mobius function mu(n).\n    mu(n) = 1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an even number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = -1 if n is a square-free positive integer with an odd number of prime factors.\n    mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer.\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all positive divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n//i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of nonzero coefficients of a given order in the\n    BCH expansion using Witt's formula and prints the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # The order\n    k = 2   # The number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    \n    terms = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power_val = k**(n // d)\n        term_val = mu_d * power_val\n        terms.append(term_val)\n        \n    total_sum = sum(terms)\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    # Build the string for the sum part of the equation for printing\n    sum_str_parts = []\n    for term in terms:\n        if not sum_str_parts: # First term\n            sum_str_parts.append(str(term))\n        elif term >= 0:\n            sum_str_parts.append(f\"+ {term}\")\n        else:\n            sum_str_parts.append(f\"- {abs(term)}\")\n    \n    sum_str = \" \".join(sum_str_parts)\n\n    print(f\"The number of nonzero coefficients is L_k(n) for n={n}, k={k}.\")\n    print(\"The calculation using Witt's formula is:\")\n    print(f\"L_2(10) = (1/{n}) * ({sum_str})\")\n    print(f\"       = (1/{n}) * {total_sum}\")\n    print(f\"       = {result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
