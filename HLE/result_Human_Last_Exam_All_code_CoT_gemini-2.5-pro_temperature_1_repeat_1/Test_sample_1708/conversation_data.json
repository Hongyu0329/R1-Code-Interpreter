    "Answering this question involves understanding the concepts of \"order type\" and \"lexical ordering\" for strings.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Set and Order:** The set is all finite strings using characters from $\\{a,b,c,d\\}$. \"Lexical order\" for strings of varying lengths usually refers to **shortlex order**, where shorter strings always come before longer strings. Strings of the same length are ordered alphabetically (e.g., \"d\" < \"aa\").\n2.  **Define Order Type:** The \"order type\" of an ordered set describes its structure. Two ordered sets have the same order type if there is a one-to-one, order-preserving mapping (an isomorphism) between them.\n3.  **Find the Isomorphic Set:** We need to find a familiar ordered set that is isomorphic to our set of strings. The set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$ with its usual order is a good candidate.\n4.  **Establish the Isomorphism:** We can show that there's a direct mapping from every string to a unique natural number that preserves the order. This can be done by treating the strings as numbers in a base-4 system, with an offset based on the string's length.\n    *   The empty string maps to 0.\n    *   1-character strings (\"a\"...\"d\") map to 1-4.\n    *   2-character strings (\"aa\"...\"dd\") map to 5-20.\n    *   And so on.\n5.  **Determine the Order Type:** The order type of the natural numbers is the transfinite ordinal number **ω (omega)**. Since our set of strings is isomorphic to the natural numbers, it has the same order type.\n6.  **Demonstrate with Code:** The Python code below will implement the function that calculates the unique integer for any given string based on a clear formula. It will use this function to demonstrate the mapping and explicitly show the calculation for a sample string, satisfying the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement.\n\n```python\ndef string_to_int(s, chars=\"abcd\", verbose=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the unique integer index for a string in shortlex order.\n    The mapping is an isomorphism from the set of strings to the natural numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    base = len(chars)\n    char_map = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(chars)}\n    k = len(s)\n\n    if k == 0:\n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"String '{s}' (empty): index = 0\")\n        return 0\n    \n    # This is the \"equation\" for the index.\n    # Part 1: Offset for all strings shorter than k.\n    # This is the sum of a geometric series: 1 + base + base^2 + ... + base^(k-1)\n    # The sum is (base^k - 1) / (base - 1).\n    offset = (base**k - 1) // (base - 1)\n    \n    # Part 2: Position of s among strings of its own length.\n    # This is found by interpreting the string as a number in base-`base`.\n    base_val = 0\n    for char in s:\n        base_val = base_val * base + char_map[char]\n            \n    total_index = offset + base_val\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"To calculate the index for string '{s}':\")\n        print(f\"  1.
