    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Analyze the Goal:** The main goal is to write a C program for a string comparison task that is as memory-efficient as possible. After writing the code, I need to calculate the total memory `m` in bytes used by its variables.\n2.  **Devise a Memory-Efficient Strategy:** A standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays. This would require `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers. A more memory-efficient strategy is to read only the first string into a buffer. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time from the input stream and compare it on-the-fly with the corresponding character from the buffered first string. This approach avoids the need for a second buffer, saving significant memory.\n3.  **Implement in C:** I will write a C program that implements this strategy. It will:\n    *   Declare a character array `s1[101]` to store the first string.\n    *   Read the first string using `scanf(\"%s\", s1)`.\n    *   Use `getchar()` to consume the newline character left in the input buffer after `scanf`.\n    *   Loop through the buffered string `s1` while reading characters of the second string one-by-one using `getchar()`.\n    *   Inside the loop, it will perform a case-insensitive comparison using the `tolower()` function.\n    *   It will print \"-1\", \"1\", or \"0\" based on the comparison result and then exit.\n4.  **Calculate Memory Usage (m):** I will sum the sizes of all variables declared in the C program to find the total memory `m`.\n    *   `char s1[101]`: 101 bytes (1 byte per char).\n    *   `int i`: 4 bytes (assuming a standard 32/64-bit system where `int` is 4 bytes).\n    *   `int c2`: 4 bytes (the `getchar()` function returns an `int` to accommodate the special `EOF` value).\n    *   The total memory `m` will be the sum of these values.\n\nHere is the Python block with the C code as requested.\n\n```python\n# The user's task is to write a memory-efficient C program.\n# Per the instructions, I am providing the code inside a Python block.\n# You can save the C code below into a file (e.g., compare.c),\n# compile it with a C compiler (e.g., gcc compare.c -o compare),\n# and then execute it (e.g., ./compare).\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <ctype.h>\n\n/*\n * This program compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case.\n * It is designed to be memory-efficient by only storing the first\n * string in a buffer and reading the second string character-by-character.\n */\nint main(void) {\n    // A buffer for the first string. Max length 100 + 1 for the null terminator.\n    char s1[101];\n\n    // A loop counter. On most contest systems, an int is 4 bytes.\n    int i = 0;\n\n    // A variable to hold characters from the second string.\n    // It is an 'int' to correctly handle the EOF value returned by getchar().\n    int c2;\n\n    // Read the first string from standard input.\n    // scanf reads up to the first whitespace, leaving the newline in the buffer.\n    scanf(\"%s\", s1);\n\n    // We must consume the newline character that separates the two input strings.\n    getchar();\n\n    // Loop until the end of the first string (indicated by the null terminator).\n    while (s1[i]) {\n        // Read the next character from the input stream (which is the second string).\n        c2 = getchar();\n\n        // Compare the lowercase versions of the characters.\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) < tolower(c2)) {\n            printf(\"-1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n        if (tolower(s1[i]) > tolower(c2)) {\n            printf(\"1\\n\");\n            return 0; // Exit after finding the result.\n        }\n\n        // If characters are equal, move to the next one.\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    // If the loop finishes, all corresponding characters were equal.\n    // The problem guarantees the strings are of the same length.\n    printf(\"0\\n\");\n\n    return 0;\n}\n<<<109>>>\n```"
