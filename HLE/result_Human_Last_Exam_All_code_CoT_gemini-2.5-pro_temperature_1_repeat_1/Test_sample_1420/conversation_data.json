    "Of course. Here is a Python script that calculates the scaling exponent α for the specific heat using the epsilon expansion.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** The calculation requires the spatial dimension `d`, the upper critical dimension `d_c` for the model, and the number of components of the order parameter `n`. For Ising-like systems, `d_c = 4`. We will assume the simplest and most common case, the Ising model, where `n = 1`.\n2.  **Define Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion is a perturbative method that uses the parameter `ϵ = d_c - d` as a small expansion variable. We will calculate `ϵ` for `d = 3`.\n3.  **Apply the RG Formula:** We will use the established formula for the specific heat exponent `α` derived from a one-loop renormalization group calculation. The formula is: `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`.\n4.  **Calculate and Display:** The script will substitute the parameters into the formula, display the step-by-step calculation, and print the final result for `α`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α)\n    using the epsilon expansion for d=3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the parameters for the calculation.\n    # d is the spatial dimension.\n    d = 3\n    # d_c is the upper critical dimension for an Ising-like system.\n    d_c = 4\n    # n is the number of components of the order parameter.\n    # For the Ising model, n=1.\n    n = 1\n\n    print(\"Calculating the specific heat scaling exponent alpha (α) using the epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(f\"The calculation is for a system with spatial dimension d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension for this universality class is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"We assume the Ising model, so the order parameter has n = {n} component(s).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate epsilon (ε).\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n    print(f\"First, we calculate the expansion parameter ε (epsilon):\")\n    print(f\"ε = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use the one-loop formula for alpha and substitute values.\n    print(\"Next, we use the one-loop renormalization group (RG) formula for α:\")\n    print(f\"α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ε\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"Now, we substitute the values n=1 and ε=1 into the equation:\")\n    \n    # Perform the calculation, showing each step.\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    intermediate_denominator = n + 8\n    denominator = 2 * intermediate_denominator\n    \n    print(f\"α = ({4} - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + {8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / (2 * {intermediate_denominator}) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    \n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n    \n    print(f\"α = {numerator/denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {alpha}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"The result to first order in the epsilon expansion is α = 1/6, which is approximately {alpha:.3f}.\")\n\ncalculate_alpha_exponent()\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
