    Calculates and prints the theoretical minimum number of queries for an SQ algorithm
    to learn a specific class of neural networks.

    The problem setting is as follows:
    - Algorithm: Statistical Query (SQ)
    - Network: Two-hidden-layer ReLU network of poly(d) size.
    - Input Distribution: N(0, Id_d), a d-dimensional Gaussian.
    - Target Accuracy: Squared loss of 1/poly(d).
    - Query Tolerance: Not negligible, e.g., 1/poly(d).

    The result is a well-known lower bound from computational learning theory.
