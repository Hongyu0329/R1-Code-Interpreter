    "To determine the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Relate Tori to the Weyl Group:** The set of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational conjugacy classes of maximal tori in $G$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. Here, $F$ is the Frobenius endomorphism associated with the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-structure. Two elements $w_1, w_2 \\in W$ are in the same $F$-conjugacy class if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **Consider the Split Case:** For a split reductive group, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the Weyl group $W$. In this standard case, the $F$-conjugacy relation simplifies to the standard conjugacy relation: $w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$. Thus, the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W$.\n\n3.  **Identify the Weyl Group:** The group $G$ is of type $E_8$, so its Weyl group is the Coxeter group $W(E_8)$.\n\n4.  **Find the Number of Conjugacy Classes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the group $W(E_8)$. This is a well-known result in the representation theory of finite groups and Lie theory. The number of conjugacy classes of $W(E_8)$ has been computed to be 112.\n\nThe following Python code prints this result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_e8_tori_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of F_q-rational maximal tori of a split reductive group of type E_8.\n\n    The number of F_q-rational maximal tori in a split reductive group G is equal to\n    the number of conjugacy classes in its Weyl group W. For a group of type E_8, the\n    Weyl group is W(E_8). The number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is a known\n    mathematical constant.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group of type E8.\n    num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8 = 112\n    \n    print(\"Let G be a split reductive group of type E_8 over the finite field F_q.\")\n    print(\"The number of F_q-rational maximal tori of G is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group, W(E_8).\")\n    print(\"The number of conjugacy classes of W(E_8) is known to be:\")\n    print(num_conjugacy_classes_W_E8)\n\nsolve_e8_tori_count()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
