1. The phrase 'my love for humanity' treats the abstract emotion 'love' as if it were a concrete object or substance. It is something that a person can possess ('my love') and aim at a target ('for humanity').

2. In the framework of conceptual metaphor theory (from Lakoff and Johnson), this process of treating an abstract concept as a physical entity is most precisely called an 'ontological metaphor'. This allows us to quantify, group, and perceive the abstract concept in a new way.

3. However, 'ontological metaphor' is not listed as an answer choice. We must select the best fit from the given options.

4. 'Conceptual metaphor' (A) is the general category, not a specific type. 'Orientational metaphor' (C) is incorrect as the phrase does not relate to spatial orientation like up/down or in/out. 'Physical metaphor' (B) and 'Intentional metaphor' (E) are not standard primary types in this theory.

5. This leaves 'Structural metaphor' (D). A structural metaphor occurs when one conceptual domain is understood in terms of another. By treating 'love' as a possessable object, we are imposing the structure of a PHYSICAL OBJECT onto the abstract concept of LOVE. This act of giving an abstract concept a structure (even a simple one like being an object) fits the definition of a structural metaphor. Therefore, it is the best available answer.
