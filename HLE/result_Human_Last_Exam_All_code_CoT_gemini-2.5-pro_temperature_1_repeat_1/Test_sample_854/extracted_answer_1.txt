The laboratory made a mistake by trusting a misleading Quality Control (QC) result while ignoring a fundamental procedural error. The primary error was in the preparation of Batch 3: the heat-sensitive antibiotic, chloramphenicol, was added *before* it was autoclaved at 121 degrees. This procedure destroyed the antibiotic. The QC test, for reasons not specified in the text, happened to show no bacterial growth, which the lab misinterpreted as a successful test confirming the antibiotic was active. This false confidence led them to use the non-functional media, which then allowed environmental bacterial contaminants to grow.
