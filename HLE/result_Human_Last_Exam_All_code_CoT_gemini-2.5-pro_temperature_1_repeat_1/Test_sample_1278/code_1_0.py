# Number of pirates (vertices)
n = 9
# Number of pairs at gunpoint (edges)
m = 16

# The problem can be modeled as finding the number of faces in a connected planar graph.
# The pirates are the vertices (n) and the gunpoint pairs are the edges (m).
# The condition that they don't split into isolated groups means the graph is connected.
# The condition that no two bullets have crossing trajectories means the graph is planar.

# Euler's formula for connected planar graphs is: n - m + f = 2
# where n is the number of vertices, m is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces.
# A "Mexican standoff" is interpreted as a face in the planar drawing of the graph.
# We can rearrange the formula to solve for f: f = m - n + 2

# Calculate the number of faces (standoffs)
f = m - n + 2

# The phrase "at most" implies that we should consider the case that maximizes the number of standoffs.
# This occurs when the graph is 2-connected, where every face is a simple cycle.
# A graph with n=9 and m=16 can be 2-connected and planar, so the maximum is the calculated number of faces.
