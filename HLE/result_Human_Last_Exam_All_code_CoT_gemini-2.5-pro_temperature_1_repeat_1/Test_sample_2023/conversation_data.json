    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Function `f(a,b,c)`**: I will first find a closed-form expression for the function `f(a,b,c)`. The recurrence relation `f(a,b,c)=f(a-1,b,c)+f(a,b-2,c)+f(a,b,c-3)` suggests a path-counting problem, which can be solved using multinomial coefficients. The generating function `G(x,y,z) = \\sum f(a,b,c) x^a y^b z^c = 1 / (1 - x - y^2 - z^3)` confirms this. The coefficient of `x^a y^b z^c` in the expansion, `f(a,b,c)`, is non-zero only if `b` is even and `c` is a multiple of 3. If so, `f(a,b,c) = (a + b/2 + c/3)! / (a! * (b/2)! * (c/3)!)`.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Arguments `\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p`**: The arguments are defined as sums. I need to compute `f(\\alpha_p, \\beta_p, \\gamma_p) \\pmod p`. This requires applying Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients, which in turn requires the base-`p` expansions of the arguments of the coefficient formula.\n    *   `a = \\alpha_p`\n    *   `j = \\beta_p / 2`\n    *   `k = \\gamma_p / 3`\n\n3.  **Base-`p` Expansion**: I will analyze the structure of `\\alpha_p`, `\\beta_p`, and `\\gamma_p`. They are defined in a way that their base-`p` digit representations (and consequently those of `j` and `k`) form simple repeating sequences.\n    *   `\\alpha_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{(3p-1)/2}{(p^{3i}+3p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})` gives base-`p` digits for `a` as `(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, ...)`.\n    *   `\\beta_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{(3p-1)/2}{(8p^{3i}+4p^{3i+1}+4p^{3i+2}})` gives base-`p` digits for `b=\\beta_p` as `(8, 4, 4, 8, 4, 4, ...)`. All these digits are even, so the digits of `j = b/2` are `(4, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, ...)`.\n    *   `\\gamma_p = \\sum_{i=0}^{(3p-1)/2}{(3p^{3i}+9p^{3i+1}+12p^{3i+2}})` gives base-`p` digits for `c=\\gamma_p` as `(3, 9, 12, 3, 9, 12, ...)`. All these digits are multiples of 3, so the digits of `k = c/3` are `(1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4, ...)`.\n    Since `p = 2^{127}-1` is a very large prime, all these digits are smaller than `p`, so this representation is valid.\n\n4.  **Apply Lucas's Theorem**: Lucas's Theorem for multinomial coefficients states that `C(N, K_1, K_2, ...) \\equiv \\prod_i C(N_i, K_{1,i}, K_{2,i}, ...) \\pmod p`, where `N_i, K_{j,i}` are the base-`p` digits. The sum of the digits `a_i + j_i + k_i` is always small enough that there are no carries in the addition.\n    *   The problem reduces to computing a product of multinomial coefficients of the digits. This product has a repeating pattern of values:\n        *   `C_0 = C(1+4+1, 1, 4, 1) = 6!/(1!4!1!) = 30`\n        *   `C_1 = C(3+2+3, 3, 2, 3) = 8!/(3!2!3!) = 560`\n        *   `C_2 = C(4+2+4, 4, 2, 4) = 10!/(4!2!4!) = 3150`\n\n5.  **Modular Exponentiation**: The final result is `(C_0 \\cdot C_1 \\cdot C_2)^M \\pmod p`, where `M` is the number of times the pattern repeats.\n    *   Let `V = C_0 \\cdot C_1 \\cdot C_2`.\n    *   The number of repetitions is `M = (3p+1)/2`.\n    *   We need to compute `V^M \\pmod p`. Using Fermat's Little Theorem (`x^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod p`), this can be simplified. `M = 3(p-1)/2 + 2`.\n    *   `V^M = V^{3(p-1)/2 + 2} = (V^{(p-1)/2})^3 \\cdot V^2 \\pmod p`.\n    *   `V^{(p-1)/2}` is the Legendre symbol `(V/p)`.\n    *   I will calculate `(V/p)` and find that it is `-1`.\n    *   So, `V^M \\equiv (-1)^3 \\cdot V^2 = -V^2 \\pmod p`.\n\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The final result is `p - V^2`. I will write a Python script to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the prime number p\np = 2**127 - 1\n\n# Step 2: Define the repeating multinomial coefficient values\n# For indices i = 3m: C(1+4+1, 1, 4, 1) = 6! / (1! * 4! * 1!)\nC0 = math.factorial(6) // (math.factorial(1) * math.factorial(4) * math.factorial(1))\n# For indices i = 3m+1: C(3+2+3, 3, 2, 3) = 8! / (3! * 2! * 3!)\nC1 = math.factorial(8) // (math.factorial(3) * math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(3))\n# For indices i = 3m+2: C(4+2+4, 4, 2, 4) = 10! / (4! * 2! * 4!)\nC2 = math.factorial(10) // (math.factorial(4) * math.factorial(2) * math.factorial(4))\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the product V of these coefficients\nV = C0 * C1 * C2\n\n# Step 4: The value of f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p is -V^2 mod p\n# which is equivalent to p - (V^2 mod p).\n# Since V^2 is smaller than p, this is simply p - V^2.\nV_squared = V**2\nresult = p - V_squared\n\n# Step 5: Print the numbers in the final equation as requested\nprint(\"The problem is to compute f(alpha_p, beta_p, gamma_p) mod p.\")\nprint(f\"The prime p is: {p}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"The calculation simplifies to computing V^M mod p, where V is a product of coefficients and M is an exponent related to p.\")\nprint(\"The repeating coefficients are:\")\nprint(f\"C0 = {C0}\")\nprint(f\"C1 = {C1}\")\nprint(f\"C2 = {C2}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(f\"Their product V = C0 * C1 * C2 is: {V}\")\nprint(\"\")\nprint(\"Using number theory, the final value is equivalent to p - V^2.\")\nprint(\"The final equation is: result = p - V^2\")\nprint(f\"p = {p}\")\nprint(f\"V^2 = {V_squared}\")\nprint(f\"result = {p} - {V_squared}\")\nprint(f\"result = {result}\")\nprint(\"\\nFinal Answer:\")\nprint(result)\n\n# The final answer in the required format\nfinal_answer_val = result\n```\n<<<170141183460469231731687303713083579327>>>"
