    print("   - This rearrangement involves breaking the C-C bond between the two double bond systems and forming a new C-C bond at their ends, resulting in a significant skeletal rearrangement of the molecule.")
    print("   - The immediate product of the rearrangement is a potassium enolate.")
    print("   - The final workup step with H2O/MeOH protonates this enolate, which then tautomerizes to the more stable ketone.")
