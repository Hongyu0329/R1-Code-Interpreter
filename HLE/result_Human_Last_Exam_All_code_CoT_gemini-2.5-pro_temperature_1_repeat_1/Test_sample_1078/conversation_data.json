    "To find the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we need to refer to the classification of finite reflection groups, which are categorized by the Dynkin diagrams. The rank of a Weyl group corresponds to the number of vertices in its associated Dynkin diagram.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  List all the families of irreducible finite Weyl groups: A_n, B_n (which is isomorphic to C_n), D_n, and the exceptional groups E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2.\n2.  Identify which of these have a rank of 4 (i.e., n=4 for the infinite families, or the subscript for the exceptional ones).\n3.  The resulting list will contain all non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4.\n4.  Count the number of items in this list.\n5.  I will write a Python script to list these groups and print the final count.\n\n```python\ndef solve_weyl_groups():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and counts the non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The classification of irreducible finite Weyl groups is given by Dynkin diagrams.\n    # The rank of the group corresponds to the number of vertices in the diagram.\n    # We list the groups whose rank is 4.\n    # - A_n series: For n=4, we get A_4.\n    # - B_n/C_n series: For n=4, we get B_4.
