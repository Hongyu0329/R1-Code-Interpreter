# Step 1: Find n1 and n2
# The problem defines a set of positive integers n that satisfy three conditions related to a function u_r(n):
# 1. u_r(n) = n/2 - 1
# 2. u_r(n + 1) = (n + 1) - 1 = n
# 3. u_r(n - 1) = (n - 1) - 1 = n - 2
#
# For u_r(n) to be an integer (as it represents the order of a differential equation), n/2 must be an integer.
# This means n must be a positive even integer.
#
# Let's check if any even integer n >= 2 satisfies these conditions.
# If we define the function u_r(k) for any integer k > 0 as:
# u_r(k) = k/2 - 1   if k is even
# u_r(k) = k - 1     if k is odd
#
# Now, let's test these definitions against the conditions for any even n >= 2:
# Condition 1: u_r(n) = n/2 - 1. This is satisfied by our definition for even n.
# Condition 2: n+1 is odd. Our definition gives u_r(n+1) = (n+1) - 1 = n. This matches.
# Condition 3: n-1 is odd. Our definition gives u_r(n-1) = (n-1) - 1 = n-2. This matches.
#
# So, any positive even integer n satisfies the given properties. The problem asks for the 1st and 2nd smallest
# positive integers, which are:
n1 = 2
n2 = 4

print(f"Step 1: The conditions are satisfied by all positive even integers.")
print(f"The 1st smallest positive integer is n1 = {n1}.")
print(f"The 2nd smallest positive integer is n2 = {n2}.")

# Step 2: Calculate the parameters for the Hamiltonian
# The Hamiltonian is given by H(p, q) = 1/2 * (p^2 + q^2 - C * q^E),
# where C = (2/n1) * sqrt((n2-n1)/(n1/2)) and E = n1/2.
# Let's calculate the coefficient C and the exponent E.

n1_half = n1 / 2
n2_minus_n1 = n2 - n1
coeff_sqrt_term = math.sqrt(n2_minus_n1 / n1_half)
C = (2 / n1) * coeff_sqrt_term
E = n1 / 2

print(f"Step 2: Calculate Hamiltonian parameters.")
print(f"The exponent is E = n1/2 = {n1}/2 = {E}.")
print(f"The coefficient is C = (2/{n1}) * sqrt(({n2}-{n1})/({n1}/2)) = {C}.")
print(f"The potential is V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - {C}*q^{E}).")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3: Calculate the period of the system
# Since E = 1, the potential is V(q) = 1/2 * (q^2 - C*q). This is a quadratic potential.
# The equation of motion is d^2q/dt^2 = -V'(q).
# V'(q) = d/dq [1/2 * q^2 - C/2 * q] = q - C/2.
# So, d^2q/dt^2 = -(q - C/2) => d^2q/dt^2 + q = C/2.
#
# This is the equation of a shifted simple harmonic oscillator.
# By letting x = q - C/2, the equation becomes d^2x/dt^2 + x = 0.
# This standard form shows that the angular frequency of oscillation is omega = 1.
omega = 1.0

# The period of a harmonic oscillator is T_period = 2 * pi / omega.
period = 2 * math.pi / omega

print("Step 3: Calculate the period of motion.")
print(f"The system is a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency omega = {omega}.")
print(f"The period is T_period = 2 * pi / {omega} = {period}.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 4: Final Answer
# The problem asks for T((n1-1)/n2). T(alpha) is defined as the period of the specified Hamiltonian.
# We found that the period is a constant value, 2*pi. Therefore, the function T(alpha) is a constant function.
alpha = (n1 - 1) / n2
final_answer = period

print("Step 4: Determine the final answer.")
print(f"The value to find is T(alpha) where alpha = ({n1}-1)/{n2} = {alpha}.")
print("Since the period is constant, its value is independent of the argument alpha.")
print(f"The final answer is the period: {final_answer}")
