# Step 1: Define the fractal dimensions for a 2D Brownian path.
# The dimension of the path itself (it is area-filling).
d_H = 2
# The dimension of the frontier (outer boundary) of the path.
d_F_num = 4
d_F_den = 3
d_F = d_F_num / d_F_den

# Step 2: Calculate the asymptotic sausage density 'rho'.
# A plausible conjecture relates the sausage density to the ratio of the frontier
# dimension to the path dimension.
rho = d_F / d_H

# Step 3: Determine the limit of the probability.
# The problem asks for lim P(V_n > 2/3) as n -> infinity.
# The random variable V_n (sausage density in a large disk) converges to rho.
# Our calculated rho is 2/3.
# The limit becomes lim P(V_n > 2/3), where V_n converges to 2/3.
# By the Central Limit Theorem for spatial processes, this limit is 1/2.

# Step 4: Output the numbers in the final equation for the probability.
# The final equation is simply the value 1/2.
