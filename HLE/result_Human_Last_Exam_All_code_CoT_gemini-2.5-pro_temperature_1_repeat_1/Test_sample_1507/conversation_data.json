    "The problem asks for the number of triangles on the outer surface (the convex hull) of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  **Identify the outer hull:** The great icosahedron is a star polyhedron. Its vertices are the same as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The smallest convex shape that encloses the great icosahedron (its convex hull) is therefore a regular icosahedron.\n2.  **Analyze the faces of the outer hull:** The question is now simplified to finding the number of faces of a regular icosahedron. By definition, a regular icosahedron is a polyhedron made of 20 identical equilateral triangular faces.\n3.  **Confirm with Euler's Formula:** We can verify this number using Euler's formula for polyhedra, which states `V - E + F = 2`, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces.\n    *   A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices (V = 12).\n    *   At each vertex, 5 edges meet. To get the total number of edges, we multiply 12 by 5 and divide by 2 (since each edge connects two vertices), giving E = (12 * 5) / 2 = 30.\n    *   Using the formula, we can solve for F: `F = 2 - V + E`.\n4.  **Write the code:** The following Python script will perform this calculation and print the result, showing each number in the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_triangulation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of triangles on the outer hull of a great icosahedron.\n    \n    The outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.
