# This problem explores the state complexity of a Turing Machine for a specific language.
# The language is L_k = {w in {0,1}* : the number of 1s in w is a multiple of k}.
# The function f(k) is the minimum number of states a TM needs to recognize L_k.
# We are asked to compute the limit of the difference: lim (k->inf) [f(k+1) - f(k)].

# As derived in the step-by-step plan, an optimal Turing Machine for this task
# would use its tape to store the count of ones in binary. This requires a constant
# number of states. The check for divisibility by k would be implemented in the
# TM's state logic. This requires a number of states proportional to the
# description length (number of bits) of k, which is O(log k).
# So, f(k) has the form A*log(k) + B.

# The limit calculation is as follows:
# lim (k->inf) [ (A*log(k+1) + B) - (A*log(k) + B) ]
# = lim (k->inf) [ A * (log(k+1) - log(k)) ]
# = lim (k->inf) [ A * log((k+1)/k) ]
# = lim (k->inf) [ A * log(1 + 1/k) ]
# As k -> inf, 1/k -> 0.
# = A * log(1)
# = A * 0
# = 0

# The final answer is an integer.
final_answer = 0

# The final equation is lim_{k->inf} [f(k+1) - f(k)] = 0.
# Printing the numbers from the final state of the equation:
# The limit value is 0.
