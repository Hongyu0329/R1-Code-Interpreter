    explanation = """
    1.  The apparatus described is a physical realization of the "Maxwell's demon" thought experiment using a Brownian ratchet as the one-way door. The goal is to move all gas from two compartments into one, which is a process that decreases the entropy of the gas.

    2.  According to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, the entropy of a completely isolated system at a uniform temperature cannot decrease.

    3.  If the entire system, including the gas and the door mechanism, is at a single, uniform temperature, the door itself will experience random thermal motion (Brownian motion). This random jiggling of the door's components will cause it to open and close unpredictably, allowing molecules to pass in both directions. As a result, no net sorting will occur, and the system will remain in equilibrium. This is a key insight from the Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet model.

    4.  To make the one-way door actually work and sort the molecules, it must not be in thermal equilibrium with the gas. A temperature difference is required. For example, if the door mechanism is kept at a lower temperature than the gas, its own thermal jiggling is reduced. The energetic collisions from the hotter gas molecules can then operate the one-way gate as intended, leading to a net flow of gas to one side.

    5.  Therefore, the critical experimental parameter that enables the sorting of gas molecules is Temperature. A specific temperature gradient between the gas and the door is required for the "demon" to function.
