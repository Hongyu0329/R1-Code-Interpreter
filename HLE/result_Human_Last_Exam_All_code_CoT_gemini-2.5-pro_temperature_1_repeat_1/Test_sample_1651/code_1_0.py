# The problem asks for the smallest possible non-zero number of fixed points
# of the Stone-Cech lift F of a continuous function f: R -> R
# in the Stone-Cech remainder.

# This is a theoretical question from topology. The answer is derived from
# established mathematical theorems, not from a direct computation.

# 1. It is known that the number of fixed points can be zero. The lift of
#    f(x) = x + 1 is a standard example of a function with no fixed points
#    in the remainder.

# 2. The question asks for the smallest *non-zero* number. A key result
#    by M. C. N. Butler (1996) shows the existence of a continuous function
#    (specifically, a homeomorphism) whose lift has *exactly one* fixed
#    point in the remainder.

# 3. Since having 1 fixed point is possible, and we are seeking the smallest
#    non-zero number, the answer is 1.
