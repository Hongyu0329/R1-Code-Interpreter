# Define the parameters of the problem based on the description.
num_rows = 2024
num_columns = 2023
num_monsters = 2022

# Step 1: Determine the number of unsafe columns.
# Each monster occupies a unique column, as each column can have at most one monster.
# Therefore, the number of unsafe columns is equal to the number of monsters.
num_unsafe_columns = num_monsters

# Step 2: Determine the number of safe columns.
# The number of safe columns is the total number of columns minus the unsafe ones.
num_safe_columns = num_columns - num_unsafe_columns

# Step 3: Analyze the worst-case strategy for Turbo.
# To guarantee a win, Turbo must have a strategy that works even in the worst-case
# scenario for monster placement. The worst case is that he must eliminate every
# unsafe column before finding the single safe one.
#
# Each time Turbo attempts to traverse a column that contains a monster, his attempt
# ends, and he learns the location of that monster. This costs one attempt to
# eliminate one column from the set of possibilities.
#
# In the worst case, Turbo will need to find all 2022 monsters, one by one,
# eliminating one unsafe column with each failed attempt.
attempts_to_eliminate_all_unsafe_columns = num_unsafe_columns

# Step 4: Calculate the final, guaranteed successful attempt.
# After finding all 2022 monsters, Turbo knows exactly which of the 2023 columns
# is the safe one. His next attempt will be to go down this known safe column.
# This attempt is guaranteed to succeed. This requires one more attempt.
final_successful_attempt = 1

# Step 5: Calculate the total minimum number of attempts (n).
# n is the sum of the attempts needed to eliminate all unsafe columns in the worst
# case, plus the one final attempt that is guaranteed to be successful.
n = attempts_to_eliminate_all_unsafe_columns + final_successful_attempt

# Print the final equation and the result.
print("The problem is to find the minimum number of attempts 'n' to guarantee reaching the last row.")
print("The strategy is to find the single 'safe' column that has no monsters.")
print("In the worst-case scenario, Turbo must find all the monsters to eliminate all 'unsafe' columns.")
print(f"Number of monsters (which equals the number of unsafe columns) = {num_monsters}")
print("Number of attempts to find all monsters in the worst case = " + str(attempts_to_eliminate_all_unsafe_columns))
print("Number of attempts for the final, guaranteed safe passage = " + str(final_successful_attempt))
print(f"The total number of attempts n is the sum of these two values.")
print(f"n = {attempts_to_eliminate_all_unsafe_columns} + {final_successful_attempt} = {n}")
