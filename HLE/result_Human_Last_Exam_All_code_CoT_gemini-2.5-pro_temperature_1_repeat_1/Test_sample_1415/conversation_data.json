    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral:** The integral is `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx`. This is a standard form. The integral of `f'(x)/f(x)` with respect to `x` is `ln|f(x)| + C`.\n2.  **Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:** The definite integral from a to b is `[ln|f(x)|]` from a to b, which equals `ln|f(b)| - ln|f(a)|`. In our case, `f(x) = F₃(x)`, a = 0, and b = 1. So, the value of the integral `V` is `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    *   `F₀(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₁(0) = sin(0) = 0`\n    *   `F₂(0) = e⁰ = 1`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n4.  **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    *   `F₀(1) = 1`\n    *   `F₁(1) = sin(1)` (where 1 is in radians)\n    *   `F₂(1) = e^(sin(1))`\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n5.  **Calculate V:**\n    *   Since `ln(2)` is positive and `F₃(1)` is also positive (as `sin(1)>0`), we can drop the absolute value signs.\n    *   `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)) = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n6.  **Final Calculation:**\n    *   Use Python's `math` library to compute the numerical value of `V`.\n    *   Multiply `V` by 10000.\n    *   Round the result to the nearest integer.\n\nThe following Python code will perform these calculations and print the required result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# This script solves the definite integral ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx from 0 to 1\n# where F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x))).\n\n# The integral ∫ (f'(x)/f(x)) dx evaluates to ln|f(x)|.\n# By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral from 0 to 1 is:\n# V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|\n\n# Step 1: Calculate F₃(0)\n# F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)\nf3_at_0 = math.log(2)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate F₃(1)\n# F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))\nf3_at_1 = math.log(1 + math.exp(math.sin(1)))\n\n# Both F₃(0) and F₃(1) are positive, so the absolute value is not needed.\n# Using the logarithm property ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b) is also possible.\n# V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\nV = math.log(f3_at_1) - math.log(f3_at_0)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the final result as requested by the user.\n# The value to report is the closest integer to 10000 * V.\nfinal_value = 10000 * V\nclosest_integer = round(final_value)\n\nprint(\"The final equation for the integral's value V is: ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Numbers in the final equation ---\")\nprint(f\"F₃(0) = ln(2) = {f3_at_0}\")\nprint(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {f3_at_1}\")\nprint(f\"V = {V}\")\nprint(f\"10000 * V = {final_value}\")\nprint(\"\\n--- Final Answer ---\")\nprint(f\"The closest integer to 10000*V is: {closest_integer}\")\n\n<<<5487>>>\n```"
