    "To answer this question, I will programmatically query the *C. elegans* adult hermaphrodite connectome dataset.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Access the connectome data, which contains a list of all synaptic connections between neurons. I will use the `c-elegans-connectome` Python library for this.\n2.  The neuron ASJ is a bilateral pair, consisting of a left neuron (ASJL) and a right neuron (ASJR). I will filter the dataset to find all connections where either ASJL or ASJR is the presynaptic (source) neuron.\n3.  From this filtered list, I will group the connections by their postsynaptic (target) cell.\n4.  For each unique target cell, I will sum the number of synapses it receives from the ASJ neurons.\n5.  Finally, I will identify the single target cell that receives the highest total number of synapses and present it as the answer, along with the detailed synapse counts.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\ntry:\n    from celegans_connectome.connectome import Connectome\nexcept ImportError:\n    print(\"Please install the required library by running: pip install c-elegans-connectome\")\n    exit()\n\ndef find_main_target_of_asj():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the main projection target of ASJ axons based on synapse number\n    in the C. elegans adult connectome.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # 1.
