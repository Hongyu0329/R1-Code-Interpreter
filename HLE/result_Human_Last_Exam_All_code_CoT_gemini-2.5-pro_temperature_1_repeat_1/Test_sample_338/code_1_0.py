    This puzzle is a logic problem that can be solved by identifying patterns
    in the statements made by the individuals.

    1. The individuals A, B, C, D, E, F, G are in a circle.
    2. The sequence of announcements (Know/Don't Know) is:
       A: Know (K)
       B: Don't Know (DK)
       C: Know (K)
       D: Don't Know (DK)
       E: Know (K)
       F: Don't Know (DK)
       G: Know (K)

    3. A clever blind person, H, hears this and deduces the hat type (Color or Number)
       for everyone except for one person, "Alice".

    4. Let's analyze the pattern of announcements. We can arrange them around the central
       figure D to check for symmetry:
       - D's neighbors are C (K) and E (K). They match.
       - The next neighbors are B (DK) and F (DK). They match.
       - The next neighbors are A (K) and G (K). They match.

    Pattern around D:
    (G:K) -- (A:K) -- (B:DK) -- (C:K) -- [D:DK] -- (E:K) -- (F:DK) -- (G:K) ...
    The sequence of announcements is perfectly symmetrical around person D.

    5. The blind logician H would infer that the underlying distribution of hat types
       (Color vs. Number) that causes this sequence of announcements is also symmetric
       around D.
       This implies:
       - type(C) = type(E)
       - type(B) = type(F)
       - type(A) = type(G)

    6. This symmetry allows H to determine the hat types of these six people in pairs.
       However, D is the axis of symmetry. D's hat type is not constrained by this
       symmetric relationship. H might find valid scenarios where the paired individuals
       have consistent types, but where D could have either a Color hat or a Number hat.

    7. Because D's hat type is the only one not determined by the symmetry,
       D is the person whose hat type H cannot deduce. Therefore, D is Alice.
