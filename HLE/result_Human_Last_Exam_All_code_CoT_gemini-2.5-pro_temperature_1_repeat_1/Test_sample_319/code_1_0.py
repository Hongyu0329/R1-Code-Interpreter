# The user is asking for the largest possible value of c where the number of
# special points for N planes in R^10 is O(N^c).

# Step 1: Define the parameters of the problem.
# The dimension of the ambient space.
d = 10
# The dimension of the planes.
k = 2

# Step 2: Determine the minimum number of planes required to form a special point.
# A special point requires that the direction vectors of planes passing through it span the whole space.
# Each plane provides a 2-dimensional vector space. To span a 10-dimensional space,
# we need at least ceil(10/2) = 5 planes whose vector spaces are sufficiently "independent".
# Let's call this number g.
try:
    g = d / k
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The dimension of the planes (k) cannot be zero.")
    sys.exit(1)

# Check if d is a multiple of k. The theory is cleanest in this case.
if d % k != 0:
    # In the general case, the analysis is more complex, but for this specific problem
    # d=10, k=2, d is a multiple of k. We proceed with the integer g.
    print(f"Warning: d is not a multiple of k. The formula c = g/(g-1) is most directly applicable when d/k is an integer.")

g = int(g)

# Step 3: Determine the exponent c.
# This problem is a variant of the "joints problem" in combinatorial geometry.
# The maximum number of special points (generalized joints) that can be formed by N k-planes
# in d-space is known to be Theta(N^c), where c = g / (g - 1).

# This bound is tight. There exists a configuration of N planes that creates Omega(N^c)
# special points, and it can be shown that no configuration can create more than O(N^c)
# special points.

try:
    c = g / (g - 1)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # This happens if g=1, e.g., for hyperplanes, where the theory is different.
    # For k=2, d=10, g=5, so this is not an issue.
    c = float('inf') 

# Step 4: Output the result and the formula used.
