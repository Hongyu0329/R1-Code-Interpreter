    "Yes, if a Schwartz function $f(x)$ has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\n\nMy plan is to demonstrate the proof of this statement. The proof relies on the properties of the Fourier transform. I will use the `sympy` library in Python to illustrate the key mathematical steps.\n\nThe plan is as follows:\n1.  Define the Fourier transform, $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$, of the function $f(x)$.\n2.  Show that the $k$-th derivative of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ evaluated at $\\xi=0$ is directly proportional to the $k$-th moment of $f(x)$. I will use `sympy` to derive and display this relationship for the first few values of $k$.\n3.  Apply the given condition that all moments of $f(x)$ are zero. This implies that all derivatives of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ at $\\xi=0$ are also zero.\n4.  Explain that since all the coefficients of the Taylor series of $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ around $\\xi=0$ are zero, the series itself is zero. For a function like $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ (which is analytic), this means $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ must be the zero function everywhere.\n5.  Finally, by the injectivity of the Fourier transform (i.e., the inversion theorem), if the transform $\\hat{f}(\\xi)$ is zero, the original function $f(x)$ must also be zero.\n\nThe following Python code walks through these steps.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains why a Schwartz function with all zero moments must be the zero function.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Yes, if a Schwartz function f(x) has all its moments equal to zero, it must be the zero function.\")\n    print(\"Here is a step-by-step explanation using the Fourier transform, illustrated with sympy.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: The Fourier Transform and its derivatives\n    print(\"--- Step 1: The Fourier Transform and its Derivatives ---\")\n    print(\"Let F(xi) be the Fourier transform of f(x).
