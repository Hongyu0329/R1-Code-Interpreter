    # Question 2: How many oxygens from compound 11 are present in compound 14?

    # This protecting group remains on the molecule through the synthesis of compound 14.

    # Question 3: How many nitrogens from compound 7 are present in compound 10?
    # The reaction is 10 -> 7. Atoms flow from reactants to products.
    # The question asks for the number of atoms flowing from product (7) to reactant (10). This is 0.
