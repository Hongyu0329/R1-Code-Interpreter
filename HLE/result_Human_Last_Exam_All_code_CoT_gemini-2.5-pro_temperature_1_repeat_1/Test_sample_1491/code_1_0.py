    # Step 1 & 2: Define the core requirements for each experiment.
    # The Visual Cliff requires perceiving static depth and deciding whether to move.
    # The Swinging Room requires processing optic flow to trigger a postural reflex.

    # Step 3: Evaluate each capability.
    
    # I. Goal-driven locomotion triggered by visual stimuli.
    # - Cliff: Yes, the task is to crawl (locomotion) towards a visual goal (the mother).
    # - Room: No, the subject is instructed to stand still.
    # Conclusion: cliff
    answer_I = "cliff"

    # II. A functional analogue of cortical area MST (optic flow processing).
    # - Cliff: Not essential. Depth can be perceived from static cues like binocular disparity or relative size.
    # - Room: Yes, this is the core mechanism. The experiment relies on the brain's interpretation
    #   of large-field optic flow (processed by areas like MST) as self-motion.
    # Conclusion: room
    answer_II = "room"

    # III. A perceptual mechanism for evaluating the relative size of elements.
    # - Cliff: Yes, this is the texture gradient cue, a primary monocular cue for depth.
    #   The pattern on the 'deep' side appears smaller/denser.
    # - Room: No, the crucial cue is the coherent motion of the visual field, not the relative size of its components.
    # Conclusion: cliff
    answer_III = "cliff"

    # IV. A mechanism for resolving binocular disparity.
    # - Cliff: Yes, this is a primary binocular cue for depth perception.
    # - Room: No, the optic flow effect works with one eye closed (it is a monocular phenomenon).
    # Conclusion: cliff
    answer_IV = "cliff"

    # V. A mechanism for controlling the effectors that maintain posture.
    # - Cliff: Not essential. The outcome is a locomotion decision, not a measured postural sway.
    # - Room: Yes, the entire dependent variable is the reflexive action of the postural control system (swaying).
    # Conclusion: room
    answer_V = "room"
    
    # Step 4: Construct and print the final answer string.
    # The final answer is the combination of the conclusions for I through V.
    final_answer = f"{answer_I}-{answer_II}-{answer_III}-{answer_IV}-{answer_V}"
