    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Define the Polynomial:** Let the given polynomial be $P(x)$.\n    $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19}\\left( 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+ x^{3\\cdot 3^i}\\right) = \\sum_k a_kx^k$.\n    Our goal is to find the sum of the squares of the coefficients, $S = \\sum_k a_k^2$.\n\n2.  **Use a Key Identity:** For a polynomial $P(x) = \\sum_k a_k x^k$ with real coefficients, the sum of the squares of its coefficients, $\\sum_k a_k^2$, is equal to the constant term of the new polynomial formed by the product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$.\n\n3.  **Construct the Product $P(x)P(x^{-1})$:**\n    Let's define the factor in the product as $f_i(x) = 1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}$.\n    So, $P(x) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x)$.\n    Then, $P(x)P(x^{-1}) = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x)\\right) \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{19} f_i(x^{-1})\\right) = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} \\left(f_i(x) f_i(x^{-1})\\right)$.\n\n4.  **Find the Constant Term:** The constant term of a product of polynomials is the product of their individual constant terms. We need to find the constant term of each product $f_i(x)f_i(x^{-1})$.\n    Let's expand one such term:\n    $f_i(x)f_i(x^{-1}) = (1+x^{3^i}+x^{2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{3\\cdot 3^i}) \\cdot (1+x^{-3^i}+x^{-2\\cdot 3^i}+x^{-3\\cdot 3^i})$.\n    The constant term (the term with $x^0$) is formed by multiplying terms whose exponents cancel out:\n    *   $1 \\times 1 = 1$\n    *   $x^{3^i} \\times x^{-3^i} = 1$\n    *   $x^{2\\cdot 3^i} \\times x^{-2\\cdot 3^i} = 1$\n    *   $x^{3\\cdot 3^i} \\times x^{-3\\cdot 3^i} = 1$\n    The sum of these products gives the constant term for this part: $1+1+1+1 = 4$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Final Sum:** Since the constant term of $f_i(x)f_i(x^{-1})$ is 4 for every $i$, and we are multiplying these terms for $i$ from 0 to 19 (which is 20 terms in total), the total constant term is the product of these 20 individual constant terms.\n    $\\sum_k a_k^2 = \\prod_{i=0}^{19} 4 = 4^{20}$.\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\n# The problem is to find the sum of the squares of the coefficients of the polynomial P(x).\n# This sum is equal to the constant term of the product P(x) * P(1/x).\n# As derived in the explanation, the constant term of each factor product is 4.\n# There are 20 such factors in the product (for i from 0 to 19).\n# Therefore, the final result is 4 raised to the power of 20.\n\n# Base of the exponentiation\nbase = 4\n\n# The exponent (number of terms in the product from i=0 to 19)\nexponent = 20\n\n# Calculate the result\nresult = base ** exponent\n\n# Print the final equation with all numbers\nprint(f\"The sum of the squares of the coefficients is calculated by the equation:\")\nprint(f\"{base}^{exponent} = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<1099511627776>>>"
