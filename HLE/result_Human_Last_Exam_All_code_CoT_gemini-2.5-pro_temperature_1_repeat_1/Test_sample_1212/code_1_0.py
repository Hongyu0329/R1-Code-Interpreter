    """
    This function determines the killing moves for White in the given Go puzzle.

    The board state is:
    Black: A2, B3, B4, C2, C1
    White: B5, C3, C4, D1, D2, D5

    It's White's turn to move.

    Analysis:
    The black group is in the corner and vulnerable. For the group to live, it needs to secure
    two eyes. The key points for creating eye shape are A1, B1, and B2.

    A successful kill for White involves preventing Black from making two eyes. This can be
    achieved if White occupies at least two of these three vital points.

    1. If White plays A1: Black must respond at B1 or B2 to try to make an eye. White can then
       play the other point (B2 or B1). White will hold two of the three key points, which is
       enough to kill the group (it creates a dead "bulky five" shape).

    2. If White plays B1: This is symmetric to playing A1. White's follow-up on either A1 or B2
       will kill the black group.

    3. If White plays B2: This takes the central vital point. Black must respond at A1 or B1.
       White can then take the other, again securing two of the three vital points and killing the group.

    Other moves are too slow and allow Black to play on a vital point like B2 and make a living shape.

    Therefore, the set of all first moves for White that guarantee a kill is {A1, B1, B2}.
