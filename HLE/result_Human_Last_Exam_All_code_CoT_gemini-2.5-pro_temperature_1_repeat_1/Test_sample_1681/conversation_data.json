    "To find the equilibrium point for the quantum prisoner's dilemma, we will use the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol, which is a common framework for analyzing such games.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Setup**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob. The initial state of their qubits is a maximally entangled state created by a unitary operator `J`. The players' actions are local unitary transformations `U_A` and `U_B` applied to their respective qubits.\n2.  **Strategies**: The players' strategies are operators from the SU(2) group, which can be parameterized by two angles, `θ` and `φ`, as `U(θ, φ)`. The classical strategies 'Cooperate' (C) and 'Defect' (D) are specific operators within this space. In the quantum game, a new optimal strategy, often called 'Quantum' (Q), emerges.\n    *   **Cooperate (C)**: `U(0, 0)` (Identity operator)\n    *   **Defect (D)**: `U(π, 0)`\n    *   **Quantum (Q)**: `U(π/2, π/2)`\n3.  **Payoffs**: The payoff matrix is given as:\n    *   (C, C): (5, 5) -> Reward (R)\n    *   (C, D): (0, 7) -> Sucker (S), Temptation (T)\n    *   (D, C): (7, 0) -> Temptation (T), Sucker (S)\n    *   (D, D): (1, 1) -> Punishment (P)\n4.  **Equilibrium**: The classical Nash Equilibrium is (D, D), resulting in a suboptimal payoff of (1, 1). In the quantum version with maximal entanglement, a new Nash Equilibrium appears at `(Q, Q)`. This means that if both players choose the strategy `Q`, neither player has an incentive to unilaterally change their strategy.\n5.  **Calculation**: We will calculate the payoff for a player when both choose the quantum strategy `Q = U(π/2, π/2)`. The payoff is determined by the probabilities of the four classical outcomes (`P_CC`, `P_CD`, `P_DC`, `P_DD`), which are calculated from the final state of the system. The expected payoff for Player A is `Payoff_A = 5*P_CC + 0*P_CD + 7*P_DC + 1*P_DD`.\n\nThe Python code below will define the quantum strategy `Q`, calculate the probabilities of the four outcomes when both players choose `Q`, and then compute the final payoff for one player at this equilibrium point.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_quantum_prisoners_dilemma_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium point for the Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma\n    using the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Payoff values from the problem description\n    # (C,C) -> (R,R), (C,D) -> (S,T), (D,C) -> (T,S), (D,D) -> (P,P)\n    R = 5  # Reward for mutual cooperation\n    S = 0  # Sucker's payoff\n    T = 7  # Temptation to defect\n    P = 1  # Punishment for mutual defection\n\n    # The quantum strategy Q is defined by the operator U(theta, phi)\n    # The Nash Equilibrium in the quantum game is the strategy pair (Q, Q)\n    # where Q = U(theta=pi/2, phi=pi/2).\n    \n    # Player A's strategy (Q)\n    theta_A = math.pi / 2\n    phi_A = math.pi / 2\n\n    # Player B's strategy (Q)\n    theta_B = math.pi / 2\n    phi_B = math.pi / 2\n\n    # Pre-calculate sine and cosine terms for the strategies\n    # s_i = sin(theta_i / 2), c_i = cos(theta_i / 2)\n    s_A = math.sin(theta_A / 2)\n    c_A = math.cos(theta_A / 2)\n    s_B = math.sin(theta_B / 2)\n    c_B = math.cos(theta_B / 2)\n\n    # Probabilities of the four classical outcomes (CC, CD, DC, DD)\n    # These formulas are derived from the final state in the EWL protocol.\n    # P_xy = |<xy|ψ_final>|^2\n    \n    # Probability of (Cooperate, Cooperate) outcome\n    p_cc = (c_A * c_B * math.cos(phi_A + phi_B) - s_A * s_B)**2\n    \n    # Probability of (Cooperate, Defect) outcome for Player A\n    p_cd = (c_A * s_B * math.cos(phi_A) - s_A * c_B * math.cos(phi_B))**2\n\n    # Probability of (Defect, Cooperate) outcome for Player A\n    p_dc = (c_A * s_B * math.sin(phi_A) - s_A * c_B * math.sin(phi_B))**2\n\n    # Probability of (Defect, Defect) outcome\n    p_dd = (s_A * s_B * math.cos(phi_A + phi_B) + c_A * c_B)**2\n    \n    # The sum of probabilities must be 1.
