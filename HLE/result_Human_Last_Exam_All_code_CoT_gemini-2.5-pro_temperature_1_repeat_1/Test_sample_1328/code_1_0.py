    Calculates the optimal feedback adjustment factor 'b' for a wireless channel.

    The optimal 'b' maximizes the mutual information of the channel, subject to
    power constraints. The derivation shows that the unconstrained optimum is b = -alpha * P1.
    This must be checked against the physical constraint that the power of the
    information-bearing part of the second signal cannot be negative, which
    translates to b^2 <= P2.

    Args:
        alpha (float): The weather-induced correlation between noise measurements.
                       Should be between -1 and 1.
        P1 (float): The power used in the first transmission. Must be non-negative.
        P2 (float): The power used in the second transmission. Must be non-negative.

    Returns:
        float: The optimal feedback adjustment factor 'b'.
