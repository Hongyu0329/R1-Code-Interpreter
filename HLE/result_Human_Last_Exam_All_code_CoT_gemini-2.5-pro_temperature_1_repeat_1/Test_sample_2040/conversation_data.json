    "Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. The primary requirement for a material to exhibit SPDC is that it must lack inversion symmetry, which results in a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n\nFree-standing boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, exist in several different atomic arrangements or polymorphs. The most commonly synthesized and studied forms (e.g., β₁₂ and χ₃ polymorphs) are centrosymmetric. This means their crystal structure has a center of inversion. In materials with inversion symmetry, the bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility χ⁽²⁾ is zero. Consequently, these ideal, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that this could change if the symmetry is broken. For example, significant strain, the presence of defects, interactions with a substrate, or effects at the edges of the nanosheet could locally break the inversion symmetry and potentially induce a weak second-order nonlinear response. But for an ideal, free-standing sheet, the answer is no.\n\n***\n\nWhile no specific coding task was provided, I will demonstrate the requested format with a relevant example. The following Python script calculates the wavelength of an \"idler\" photon in a hypothetical SPDC process, based on the principle of energy conservation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define Inputs:** I will set the wavelengths for the high-energy \"pump\" photon and one of the down-converted photons (the \"signal\" photon). I'll use common values from optics experiments (e.g., a 532 nm pump laser).\n2.  **Apply Conservation of Energy:** The energy of the pump photon is split between the signal and idler photons. The relationship for wavelengths is: `1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler`.\n3.  **Calculate Idler Wavelength:** I will rearrange the formula to solve for the unknown idler wavelength: `λ_idler = 1 / (1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal)`.\n4.  **Print the Result:** The code will print the initial conditions and the final calculated idler wavelength. As requested, it will also display the full conservation equation with all the numerical values.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the known wavelengths in nanometers (nm).\n# Let's assume a green pump laser and a near-infrared signal photon.\nlambda_pump = 532.0\nlambda_signal = 810.0\n\nprint(f\"Pump Wavelength (λ_pump): {lambda_pump} nm\")\nprint(f\"Signal Wavelength (λ_signal): {lambda_signal} nm\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the idler wavelength using the energy conservation formula.\n# The formula is: 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler\n# Rearranging for λ_idler: λ_idler = 1 / (1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal)\n\n# First, check if the signal wavelength is physically possible (must be longer than the pump wavelength).\nif lambda_signal <= lambda_pump:\n    print(\"Error: Signal wavelength must be longer than the pump wavelength for SPDC.\")\nelse:\n    # Calculate the terms for the inverse wavelengths.\n    inv_lambda_pump = 1 / lambda_pump\n    inv_lambda_signal = 1 / lambda_signal\n\n    # Calculate the inverse idler wavelength.\n    inv_lambda_idler = inv_lambda_pump - inv_lambda_signal\n\n    # Calculate the final idler wavelength.\n    lambda_idler = 1 / inv_lambda_idler\n\n    print(f\"Calculated Idler Wavelength (λ_idler): {lambda_idler:.2f} nm\\n\")\n\n    # As requested, printing the final equation with all the numbers.\n    print(\"Energy Conservation Equation Check:\")\n    print(f\"1 / {lambda_pump:.2f} = 1 / {lambda_signal:.2f} + 1 / {lambda_idler:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"{inv_lambda_pump:.6f} = {inv_lambda_signal:.6f} + {inv_lambda_idler:.6f}\")\n    print(f\"{inv_lambda_pump:.6f} = {inv_lambda_signal + inv_lambda_idler:.6f}\")\n\n```\n<<<No>>>"
