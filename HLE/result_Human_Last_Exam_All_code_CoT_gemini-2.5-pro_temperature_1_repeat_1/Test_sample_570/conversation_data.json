    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible area of a convex set `K` in the plane that has a non-empty intersection with every line `L_{p,q}` defined by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (`gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\n### Step-by-step Derivations:\n1.  **Analyze the condition:** The set `K` must intersect a specific family of lines. Let's consider a few specific lines from this family by choosing some coprime integer pairs `(p, q)`:\n    *   `p=1, q=1`: The line is `x + y = 1`.\n    *   `p=1, q=-1`: The line is `x - y = 1`.\n    *   `p=-1, q=1`: The line is `-x + y = 1`.\n    *   `p=-1, q=-1`: The line is `-x - y = 1`, which simplifies to `x + y = -1`. (Note: `gcd(-1, -1) = 1`).\n\n2.  **Establish a lower bound for the area:** The convex set `K` must intersect these four lines: `x+y=1`, `x-y=1`, `-x+y=1`, and `x+y=-1`. These four lines form the boundary of a square `P` whose vertices are `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`. The area of this square `P` is 2.\n\n3.  **Apply a geometric theorem:** There is a known theorem in geometry which states that any convex set that intersects all four sidelines of a parallelogram must have an area greater than or equal to the area of the parallelogram. In our case, the parallelogram is the square `P` with an area of 2. Therefore, the area of our convex domain `K` must be at least 2.\n    `Area(K) >= Area(P) = 2`.\n\n4.  **Find a candidate for the minimal area domain:** Now we need to check if this lower bound of 2 can be achieved. Let's consider the convex set `R` defined by the inequality `|x| + |y| <= 1`. This set is a rhombus (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at `(1,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(-1,0)`, and `(0,-1)`. The area of this rhombus is `1/2 * d1 * d2`, where `d1` and `d2` are the lengths of its diagonals. The diagonals run from `(-1,0)` to `(1,0)` and from `(0,-1)` to `(0,1)`, so their lengths are `d1 = 2` and `d2 = 2`. The area is `1/2 * 2 * 2 = 2`.\n\n5.  **Verify the candidate:** We must verify that this rhombus `R` intersects every line `px + qy = 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`. A line intersects a convex set if the distance from the center of the set to the line is less than or equal to the \"radius\" of the set in the direction perpendicular to the line. A more formal way is to use the support function `h_R(u) = sup_{v in R} <u, v>`. The condition for intersection is `h_R(p,q) >= 1`.\n    For the rhombus `R`, the support function is `h_R(p,q) = sup_{|x|+|y|<=1} (px + qy)`. The maximum value is achieved at one of the vertices `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n    `h_R(p,q) = max(p*1+q*0, p*0+q*1, p*(-1)+q*0, p*0+q*(-1)) = max(p, q, -p, -q) = max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    For `R` to be a valid domain, we need `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1` for all coprime integers `p, q`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. If one of them is non-zero, its absolute value is at least 1. Thus, `max(|p|, |q|) >= 1` is always true for any coprime pair `(p,q)`.\n    This confirms that the rhombus `|x| + |y| <= 1` is a valid domain.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** We have established a lower bound of 2 for the area and found a convex domain that satisfies the conditions and has an area of exactly 2. Therefore, the minimal area is 2.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the area of the resulting rhombus, showing the numbers used in the final calculation.\n\n```python\n# The minimal area is achieved by the rhombus with vertices (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1).\n# We can calculate its area using the formula for a rhombus: Area = 1/2 * d1 * d2,\n# where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.\n\n# The first diagonal connects (-1,0) and (1,0). Its length is:\nd1 = 1 - (-1)\n\n# The second diagonal connects (0,-1) and (0,1). Its length is:\nd2 = 1 - (-1)\n\n# Calculate the area\narea = (1/2) * d1 * d2\n\n# Print the equation and the result\nprint(f\"The minimal area is calculated by the equation: (1/2) * {d1} * {d2} = {area}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
