def solve_markov_chain_problem():
    """
    This function provides the solution to the two-part Markov chain problem.

    Part 1:
    The question asks if a Markov chain with a specific harmonic function `h`
    must be recurrent or transient. We can find examples for both cases:
    1. Recurrent Case: The simple symmetric random walk on Z is recurrent.
       Let A = {0} and h(x) = |x|. This function is harmonic for x != 0,
       h(0)=0, and h(x) -> infinity. This fits all conditions.
    2. Transient Case: A biased random walk or a walk on Z+ with drift increasing
       with distance from the origin can be constructed. These are transient, and
       a corresponding function h(x) that goes to infinity can be found.
    Since both recurrent and transient chains can satisfy the properties,
    no general conclusion can be drawn.
    Answer: '?'

    Part 2:
    The question considers a new chain with probabilities q(x,y) = p(x,y) * h(y)/h(x).
    This is a Doob's h-transform. Let's analyze its properties.
    Consider the function f(x) = 1/h(x). For the new chain Y_n, f(Y_n) is a
    non-negative supermartingale. This is because:
    E[f(Y_{n+1}) | Y_n=x] = Sum_y q(x,y)f(y) = Sum_y p(x,y)(h(y)/h(x))(1/h(y))
                         = (1/h(x)) * Sum_y p(x,y) <= 1/h(x) = f(x).
    By the Martingale Convergence Theorem, a non-negative supermartingale must
    converge almost surely. So, h(Y_n) = 1/f(Y_n) must also converge.
    If the new chain were recurrent, it would visit states with different h-values
    (since h(x) -> infinity, it's not constant) infinitely often. This would
    prevent the sequence h(Y_n) from converging. This is a contradiction.
    Therefore, the new chain must be transient.
