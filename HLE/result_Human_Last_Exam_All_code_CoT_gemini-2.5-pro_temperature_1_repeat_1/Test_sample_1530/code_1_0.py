# The poem describes a natural phenomenon personified as "she".
# Key phrases like "cold," "knits a veil," "lace and glass" are used.
# "Cold" and "glass" strongly suggest ice crystals.
# The "veil" of "lace" on plants ("grass and meadowsweet") perfectly describes the appearance of hoarfrost.
# This creation is temporary and is destroyed by the full force of "pelted Autumn."
# This matches the behavior of early frost, which forms on cold nights and disappears as the autumn day warms or the weather changes.
# Therefore, the poem is describing frost.

# The correct answer choice is A.
