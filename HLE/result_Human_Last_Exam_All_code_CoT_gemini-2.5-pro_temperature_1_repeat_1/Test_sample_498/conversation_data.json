    "This puzzle is based on the layout of a standard QWERTY keyboard. The pattern follows the path of the letters as typed on the keyboard.\n\nHere is the step-by-step logic:\n1.  The base sequence of letters follows the bottom row of the keyboard, moving from left to right: `Z, X, C, V, B, N, M`.\n2.  The given sequence `ZXXCVYBN` largely follows this path but contains two specific interruptions.\n3.  **Path Analysis**:\n    *   `Z -> X`: The sequence starts at `Z` and moves one key to the right to `X`.\n    *   `X -> X`: The first interruption occurs here as a \"stutter\" or a repeat of the key `X`.\n    *   `X -> C -> V`: The sequence resumes its path, moving two steps to the right.\n    *   `V -> Y -> B`: The second interruption is a \"jump\". The path moves from `V` up to `Y` on the middle row, and then back down to `B` on the bottom row.\n    *   `B -> N`: After the jump, the sequence lands on `B` and resumes its primary pattern, moving one step to the right to `N`.\n4.  **Finding the next letter**:\n    *   The established pattern is to move right along the bottom row of the keyboard.\n    *   The last letter is `N`. To continue the pattern, we simply find the next key to the right of `N`.\n    *   On a QWERTY keyboard, the key to the right of `N` is `M`.\n\nHere is the Python code that demonstrates this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_keyboard_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the letter sequence puzzle ZXXCVYBN_ by\n    explaining the pattern based on a QWERTY keyboard layout.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence and the keyboard row it's based on\n    sequence = \"ZXXCVYBN\"\n    qwerty_bottom_row = \"ZXCVBNM\"\n\n    print(\"The given sequence is: Z X X C V Y B N _\")\n    print(\"\\nThe solution is found by tracing the letters on a standard QWERTY keyboard.\")\n    print(\"The primary pattern follows the keys on the bottom row from left to right.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nLet's break down the sequence's path:\")\n    print(\"1.
