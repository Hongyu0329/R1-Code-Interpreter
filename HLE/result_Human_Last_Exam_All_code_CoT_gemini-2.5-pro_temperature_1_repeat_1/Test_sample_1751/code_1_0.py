    print("- Straight, saturated chains can align parallel to each other very effectively.")
    print("- This close alignment maximizes attractive van der Waals forces, leading to very tight, ordered packing.")
    print("- The kink from the double bond in ceramide disrupts this alignment, creating more space between molecules and leading to less ordered, looser packing.")

    print("Step 3: Connect molecular packing to surface area in a monolayer.")

    print("Conclusion:")
    print(f"Because {dihydroceramide} consists of two straight, saturated chains, it can pack more tightly and form a more ordered structure than {ceramide}.")
