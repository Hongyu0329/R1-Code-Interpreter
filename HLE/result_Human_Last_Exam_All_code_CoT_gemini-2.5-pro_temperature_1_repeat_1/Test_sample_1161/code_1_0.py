    """
    Solves the fortress problem for a unit ball in R^3.

    The problem asks for the minimum number of guards on the surface of a unit ball
    required to observe the entire exterior region.

    A literal interpretation of "observing the whole area" leads to the conclusion
    that an infinite number of guards are required. This is because any finite
    number of guards (which define tangent planes) will create a polyhedral
    unseen region that is larger than the ball itself, thus leaving some
    exterior points unseen.

    A more standard interpretation for this type of problem is to require that
    the unseen region be bounded, which ensures any path from infinity to the
    ball is observed. This happens if and only if the convex hull of the guard
    positions contains the center of the ball in its interior.

    The question then becomes: What is the minimum number of points on a sphere's
    surface whose convex hull contains the sphere's center?

    - 1 point: Forms a point (0D). Cannot contain the center.
    - 2 points: Forms a line segment (1D). Cannot contain the center in its interior.
    - 3 points: Forms a triangle (2D). Cannot contain the center in its interior.
    - 4 points: Can form a tetrahedron (3D). If the points are chosen as the
      vertices of an inscribed regular tetrahedron, their convex hull contains
      the center.

    Thus, the minimum number of guards is 4.
