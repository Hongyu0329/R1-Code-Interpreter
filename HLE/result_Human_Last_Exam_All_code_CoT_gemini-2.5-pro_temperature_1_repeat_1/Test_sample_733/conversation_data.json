    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many distinct finite groups (up to isomorphism) have a \"maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2\".\n\nLet's break down the definitions:\n1.  **Group `G`**: A set with an associative binary operation, an identity element, and inverses for every element.\n2.  **Product-free set `S`**: A subset of `G` where for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including when `x` and `y` are the same element), their product `x*y` is not in `S`.\n3.  **Set of size 2**: Our set `S` is of the form `{a, b}` where `a` and `b` are distinct elements of `G`.\n4.  **Maximal by inclusion**: The set `S` is product-free, but if we add any other element `g` from `G` to `S`, the new set `S âˆª {g}` is no longer product-free.\n\nSo, we are looking for the number of finite groups `G` that contain a subset `S = {a, b}` satisfying these two conditions:\n1.  **Product-Free Condition**: `a*a`, `b*b`, `a*b`, and `b*a` must *not* be in `{a, b}`. A simple consequence is that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`, because `e*e = e`.\n2.  **Maximality Condition**: For any element `g` in `G` that is not in `S`, the set `{a, b, g}` must *not* be product-free. This means that for any `g` not in `S`, there must be some product of two elements from `{a, b, g}` that results in an element within `{a, b, g}`.\n\nMy plan is to systematically check all non-isomorphic groups of small order to see if they satisfy these conditions. I will write a Python script that:\n1.  Represents a finite group using its Cayley table (multiplication table).\n2.  Iterates through all possible 2-element subsets `S = {a, b}` of a given group.\n3.  For each subset `S`, it first checks if it's product-free.\n4.  If it is, it then checks if it's maximal by testing the addition of every other element `g` from the group.\n5.  If a group is found to contain such a set, it is counted.\n\nThe script will test all 13 non-isomorphic groups of order up to 8 (excluding the trivial group of order 1). This is a sufficient range to find all such groups, as it can be proven that no such group of order greater than 7 exists.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nclass Group:\n    \"\"\"A simple class to represent a finite group with a Cayley table.\"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, name, elements, op_table):\n        self.name = name\n        self.elements = elements\n        self.op_table = op_table\n        self.identity = self._find_identity()\n\n    def _find_identity(self):\n        \"\"\"Find the identity element of the group.\"\"\"\n        for e in self.elements:\n            is_identity = True\n            for g in self.elements:\n                if self.op_table[e][g] != g or self.op_table[g][e] != g:\n                    is_identity = False\n                    break\n            if is_identity:\n                return e\n        return None\n\ndef check_group(group):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a group contains a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(group.elements)\n    \n    # Iterate over all possible 2-element subsets S = {a, b}\n    for a, b in itertools.combinations(group.elements, 2):\n        # The identity element cannot be in a product-free set\n        if a == group.identity or b == group.identity:\n            continue\n\n        S = {a, b}\n\n        # 1.
