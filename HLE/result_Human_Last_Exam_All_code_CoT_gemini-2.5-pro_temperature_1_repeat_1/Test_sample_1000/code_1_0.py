    Calculates the smallest possible number of elements in the subset Y.

    Let n be the dimension of the total space (F_p^n).
    Let k be the dimension of the subspaces in X and Y.
    The condition given implies that the sum of the subspaces in Y must span the entire space F_p^n.
    From the dimension theorem, we have dim(W_1 + ... + W_m) <= dim(W_1) + ... + dim(W_m).
    To span F_p^n, we need n <= m * k.
    Thus, the minimum number of subspaces, m, must be at least ceil(n / k).
