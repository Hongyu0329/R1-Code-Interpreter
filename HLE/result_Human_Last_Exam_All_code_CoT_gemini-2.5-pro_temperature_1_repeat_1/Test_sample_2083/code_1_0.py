    # The problem: For a shallow neural network with one hidden layer and GeLU
    # activation functions, find the minimum hidden-layer width (H) required
    # to compute the squared norm of an N-dimensional input vector (||x||^2).

    # The analysis shows that to correctly approximate the quadratic nature
    # of the squared norm function, the network must be able to represent
    # a function whose Hessian is the identity matrix and whose gradient
    # at the origin is zero.

    # A set of N hidden neurons is not sufficient to meet these conditions.
    # However, a construction using N+1 neurons is possible. The weight vectors
    # for these neurons can be based on the vertices of a regular N-simplex
    # centered at the origin.

    # Therefore, the minimum required hidden-layer width H is N + 1.
