    # The problem defines V as the algebra of all continuous functions f: M -> R,
    # and D as a derivation on V. A derivation is a linear map satisfying the Leibniz rule:
    # D(fg) = f*D(g) + g*D(f).

    # The core of the problem lies in the following key theorem:
    # For any topological space M, any derivation D on the algebra C(M, R) is
    # identically the zero derivation (D = 0).

    # Here is a sketch of the proof in 4 steps:
    # Step 1: The derivative of any constant function is 0.
    # Let c(x) = 1 be the constant function.
    # D(1) = D(1*1) = 1*D(1) + 1*D(1) = 2*D(1).
    # The equation D(1) = 2*D(1) implies D(1) = 0.
    # By linearity, for any constant c, D(c) = D(c*1) = c*D(1) = c*0 = 0.

    # Step 2: If a non-negative function h >= 0 has h(x) = 0 at some point x,
    # then (D(h))(x) = 0.
    # Since h is a non-negative continuous function, its square root, sqrt(h), is
    # also a real-valued continuous function, so sqrt(h) is in V.
    # We can write h = (sqrt(h))^2.
    # Applying the derivation D:
    # D(h) = D((sqrt(h))^2) = sqrt(h)*D(sqrt(h)) + sqrt(h)*D(sqrt(h)) = 2*sqrt(h)*D(sqrt(h)).
    # If we evaluate this at the point x where h(x) = 0, we get:
    # (D(h))(x) = 2 * sqrt(h(x)) * (D(sqrt(h)))(x) = 2 * sqrt(0) * (D(sqrt(h)))(x) = 0.

    # Step 3: Extend this to any function g. If g(x) = 0, then (D(g))(x) = 0.
    # Any continuous function g can be written as the difference of two non-negative
    # continuous functions: g = g_plus - g_minus, where g_plus = max(g, 0) and g_minus = max(-g, 0).
    # If g(x) = 0, then it must be that g_plus(x) = 0 and g_minus(x) = 0.
    # Since g_plus and g_minus are non-negative, we can apply the result from Step 2:
    # (D(g_plus))(x) = 0 and (D(g_minus))(x) = 0.
    # By linearity of D: (D(g))(x) = D(g_plus - g_minus)(x) = (D(g_plus))(x) - (D(g_minus))(x) = 0 - 0 = 0.

    # Step 4: For any function f in V, D(f) is the zero function.
    # Pick an arbitrary function f from V and an arbitrary point x from M.
    # Let c = f(x) be the value of f at x. This is a constant.
    # Define a new function g(y) = f(y) - c.
    # The function g is continuous and g(x) = f(x) - c = 0.
    # From Step 3, we know that (D(g))(x) = 0.
    # Now let's see what D(g) is:
    # D(g) = D(f - c) = D(f) - D(c).
    # From Step 1, we know D(c) = 0.
    # So, D(g) = D(f).
    # Since (D(g))(x) = 0, it follows that (D(f))(x) = 0.
    # Because f and x were arbitrary, this means that for any function f, its derivative D(f)
    # is 0 at all points. Thus, D is the zero derivation.

    # The premise "D != 0" is false. An implication with a false premise is logically TRUE.
    print("A: TRUE. This is a vacuously true statement.")

    # B. If M has large enough cardinality, there exists f in V such that D(f) != 0.
    # This statement claims that for some M, a non-zero derivation exists.
    # Our proof shows D=0 for ANY M, regardless of cardinality. So D(f) is always 0.
