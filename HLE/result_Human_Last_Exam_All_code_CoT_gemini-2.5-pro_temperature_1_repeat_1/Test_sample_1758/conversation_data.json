    "Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the phonological adaptation of the English term \"shock absorber\" into Puerto Rican Spanish.\n\n1.  **Analyze the English phrase**: \"shock absorber\" is pronounced roughly as /ʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/ in English. When borrowed into another language, especially in spoken form, it is often treated as a single compound word.\n\n2.  **Adapt \"shock\" (/ʃɑk/)**:\n    *   The English /ʃ/ sound (like \"sh\") does not exist in Spanish. It is commonly adapted to the affricate /tʃ/ (like \"ch\"). So, \"shock\" begins as \"chock\".\n    *   The English vowel /ɑ/ (as in \"cot\") is mapped to the closest Spanish vowel, which is /o/.\n    *   The final /k/ sound will be preserved but linked to the following vowel from \"absorber\".\n\n3.  **Adapt \"absorber\" (/əbˈsɔrbər/) and combine**:\n    *   The phrase is treated as a single word: `shockabsorber`.\n    *   The link between \"shock\" and \"absorber\" creates a new syllable. The /k/ from \"shock\" and the initial vowel /ə/ from \"absorber\" form the syllable /ka/.\n    *   The stressed syllable of the original English word, /ˈsɔr/, remains the stressed syllable. The /s/ is at the beginning of the syllable, so it remains /s/. The vowel /ɔ/ maps to /o/. The syllable-final /r/ undergoes **lateralization**, a key feature of Puerto Rican Spanish, where it is pronounced as /l/. Thus, /ˈsɔr/ becomes /ˈsol/.\n    *   The final syllable, /bər/, is adapted as well. The /b/ is now between two vowels (/o/ and /e/), so it is softened to a fricative [β]. The final /r/ also undergoes lateralization to /l/. The schwa vowel /ə/ is realized as /e/. So, /bər/ becomes /[βel]/.\n\n4.  **Final Transcription**: By combining these adaptations, we get the syllables: [tʃo] + [ka] + [sol] + [βel]. The stress remains on the \"sol\" syllable.\n\nThis entire process is demonstrated in the Python script below, which prints out the derivation and the final phonetic transcription.\n\n```python\ndef transcribe_to_prs():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains and generates the phonetic transcription of \"shock absorber\"\n    in Puerto Rican Spanish.\n    \"\"\"\n    english_phrase = \"shock absorber\"\n    english_ipa = \"/ʃɑk əbˈsɔrbər/\"\n\n    print(f\"Starting with the English phrase: '{english_phrase}' ({english_ipa})\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Step-by-Step Phonological Adaptation ---\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Adapt \"shock\"\n    print(\"1.
