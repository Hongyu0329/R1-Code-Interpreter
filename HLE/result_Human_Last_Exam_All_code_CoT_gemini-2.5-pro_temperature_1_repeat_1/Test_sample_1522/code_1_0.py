# We provide an example of a function f(x) that satisfies the given conditions
# but has no fixed points. This demonstrates that 0 is a possible number of fixed points.
# The example function is f(x) = sqrt(x^2 + 1).

# A fixed point is a solution to the equation f(x) = x.
# For our example, this is sqrt(x^2 + 1) = x.
# To solve this, we can square both sides. For a solution to exist, we must have x >= 0.
# The equation becomes: x^2 + 1 = x^2.
# Subtracting x^2 from both sides gives the final contradictory equation: 1 = 0.
