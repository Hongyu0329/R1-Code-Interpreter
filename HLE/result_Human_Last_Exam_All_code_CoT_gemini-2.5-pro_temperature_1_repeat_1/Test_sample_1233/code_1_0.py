    Analyzes the microbiology lab scenario to determine the best corrective action.
    
    The scenario describes a case where a slow-growing pathogen (Campylobacter) was likely missed
    because the plates were read at 48 hours, when a faster-growing contaminant (Bacillus)
    was already prominent. Campylobacter often requires a full 72 hours of incubation to
    form colonies that are large enough to be easily identified.
