# The final answer format is specified as <<<answer content>>>. The user prompt
# seems to have an example with letters or numbers. Let's output the float value.
# I'll modify the final print to just be the number.
# However, the user also said "don't ask users to copy and paste the result".
# The format <<<...>>> seems designed for extraction. Let's make it clean.

# I'll re-run my thought process on the final output format.
# "directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response"
# e.g., "<<<C>>>", "<<<9.8>>>"
# My value is 35/34 = 1.02941176...
# I'll just output the float value to a reasonable precision, or the fraction.
# Let's output the fraction as a string, as it's more precise. No, the example is a float.
# Let's provide the float.

# Final check of the code. The code calculates the values based on my reasoning.
# s_N_W1 calculation is a shortcut, but correct based on the logic:
# s(N,W) = sum_i |(C_N U C_i) intersect W| = sum_i (|C_N intersect W| + |C_i intersect W|)
# = 8 * |C_N intersect W| + sum_i |C_i intersect W| = 8 * |C_N intersect W| + |C_pairs intersect W|
# For W_1, |C_N intersect W_1| = 8 and |C_pairs intersect W_1| = 6. So 8*8+6=70. Correct.
# For W_2, |C_N intersect W_2| = 8 and |C_pairs intersect W_2| = 4. So 8*8+4=68. Correct.
# The code correctly implements this.

# Let's adjust the final print statement to be cleaner per instruction.
# I will delete my extra thoughts in the final code block.
# The `solve` function is self-contained.

# Final thoughts on presentation:
# The user wants python code in a block. The thinking steps should be text. The final code block should be a single block.
# I will combine the plan and the reasoning into a more concise text block.
# The print statements inside the final python code should be clear and explain the result.
# I will remove my scratchpad comments from the final python block.

# Final re-thinking of the print. The prompt says "Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant."
# and also "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
# So my print statements are appropriate.
# I'll modify the final <<<>>> part to be cleaner.
final_answer_val = 35/34
# print(f"\n<<<{final_answer_val:.5f}>>>")
# The example shows no formatting, just the number. I will do that.
# print(f"\n<<<{final_answer_val}>>>")
# this is good.
