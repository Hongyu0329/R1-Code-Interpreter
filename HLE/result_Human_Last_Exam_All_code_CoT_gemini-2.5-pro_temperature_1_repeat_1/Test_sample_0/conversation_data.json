    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a question from the field of population ethics. I will use a Python script to demonstrate the logic.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Explain the Core Concepts:** First, I will briefly define what a \"critical-level view\" of population ethics is. This view assesses the value of a population by summing the well-being of each person after subtracting a fixed positive value, the \"critical level\".\n2.  **Explain the Violated Condition:** Next, I will explain the \"Non-Elitism\" condition. This principle essentially states that no matter how wonderful one person's life is, a sufficiently large number of people with lives that are just barely worth living can constitute a better population.\n3.  **Demonstrate the Violation with Code:** I will write a Python script to illustrate why critical-level views violate Non-Elitism. The script will:\n    *   Define a population `A` with one person at a very high welfare level (\"the elite\").\n    *   Define a welfare level `u_low` that is positive but *below* the critical level.\n    *   Create a second population `B` composed of `N` individuals, all at the `u_low` welfare level.\n    *   Calculate the value of both populations according to the critical-level view.\n    *   The code will show that as `N` (the number of people in population B) increases, the total value of population `B` becomes increasingly negative and can never surpass the value of population `A`. This directly contradicts the Non-Elitism condition.\n\n```python\ndef demonstrate_violation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script demonstrates how critical-level views violate the\n    Non-Elitism condition from Arrhenius's impossibility theorems.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define the parameters for our scenario ---\n\n    # A critical-level view states that the value of a population is the\n    # sum of (utility - critical_level) for all individuals.\n    # We choose a positive critical level.\n    critical_level = 20\n\n    # Non-Elitism considers an \"elite\" population with one person at a very high utility.\n    elite_utility = 1000\n    population_A = [elite_utility]\n\n    # It also considers a population of many people at a low, but positive, utility.\n    # CRUCIALLY, for this demonstration, we pick a low utility that is *below* the critical level.\n    low_utility = 5  # Note: 5 > 0, but 5 < critical_level (20)\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the value of the 'elite' Population A ---\n\n    # Value(A) = (utility_of_person_1 - critical_level)\n    value_A = elite_utility - critical_level\n    print(f\"--- Scenario Setup ---\")\n    print(f\"Critical Level (c): {critical_level}\")\n    print(f\"Elite Population (A): One person with utility {elite_utility}\")\n    print(f\"Low-Utility Population (B): 'N' people, each with utility {low_utility}\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"--- Value of Elite Population A ---\")\n    print(f\"Value(A) = Elite Utility - Critical Level\")\n    print(f\"Value(A) = {elite_utility} - {critical_level} = {value_A}\\n\")\n\n    # --- Step 3: Show how the value of Population B changes with N ---\n\n    print(f\"--- Value of Low-Utility Population B ---\")\n    print(\"Non-Elitism requires that for some large number (N) of people in Population B,\")\n    print(\"Value(B) > Value(A).
