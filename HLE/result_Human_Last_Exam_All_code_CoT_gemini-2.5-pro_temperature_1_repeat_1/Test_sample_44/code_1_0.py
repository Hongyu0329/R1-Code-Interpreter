        'A': "Partially incorrect. The Mausoleum was begun in 28 BC, very early in Augustus's sole rule, not in his 'fifth decade'. It was a statement of dynastic power from the outset.",
        'B': "Partially incorrect. While it was likened to the tomb of Mausolus, the comparison to tombs in Namibia is unsupported and not a standard academic comparison.",
        'C': "Highly accurate. This statement is a summary of the description by the historian and geographer Strabo (Geography 5.3.8), a contemporary of Augustus. His account is the primary source for the Mausoleum's original appearance and is the foundation for most modern reconstructions.",
        'D': "Incorrect. This is anachronistic. The Mausoleum was completed decades before the large-scale enslavement of Judeans following the Jewish-Roman War of 70 AD.",
        'E': "Incorrect. The most common name is Mausoleum Augusti. 'Tumulus Iuliorum' is a plausible descriptor but not its main name, and 'Stultitia Augusti' (Augustus's Folly) is not historically attested.",
        'F': "Partially incorrect. The Res Gestae Divi Augusti was inscribed on two bronze pillars placed at the entrance to the Mausoleum, not on the main body of the structure itself.",
        'G': "Likely incorrect. The Mausoleum of Augustus was of a similar, but probably slightly shorter, height than the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (approx. 42m vs 45m).",
        'H': "Subjective. This is an art-historical opinion, not a statement of fact backed by archaeological evidence.",
        'I': "Incorrect. The conical roof (as a tumulus of earth and trees) and statue were original, but the chapel to the Archangel Michael was a much later medieval addition to the ruins, not part of the original design."

    best_option = 'C'
    explanation = f"""
The analysis with the most backing from archaeological historians is C.

Here is a breakdown of why:
The statement in option C is almost entirely based on the description from the geographer Strabo, a contemporary who saw the Mausoleum. In his work 'Geography' (Book 5, Chapter 3, Section 8), he describes a great mound on a marble foundation, covered with evergreen trees, and topped by a bronze statue of Augustus. He also notes it contained the tombs of Augustus's relatives and friends and mentions the nearby 'Ustrinum' (cremation place). This primary source is the single most important piece of evidence for the monument's original appearance and is universally cited by historians and archaeologists. Other options contain significant inaccuracies, anachronisms, or subjective opinions.
