    "Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n1.  First, I will break down the user's query into key constraints.\n    *   It must be an island town.\n    *   It must be extremely remote, specifically \"more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island\".\n    *   The town must be located on a bay.\n    *   This bay must have been \"formed by a volcanic caldera\".\n    *   The town and the bay must share the same name.\n2.  I will start with the most restrictive clue: extreme remoteness. This narrows the search to a few of the world's most isolated inhabited islands, such as Easter Island, Tristan da Cunha, and Pitcairn Island.\n3.  Next, I will evaluate these candidates against the other clues.\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha**: The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. It's extremely remote but doesn't sit in a caldera bay, and the settlement name doesn't match a bay.\n    *   **Pitcairn Island**: The main settlement is Adamstown. It is also extremely remote, but the main landing is at Bounty Bay, not a caldera, and the names do not match.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui)**: The main and only town is Hanga Roa. It is located on Hanga Roa Bay, so the names match. The island is volcanic and famous for its calderas (like Rano Kau). Easter Island is also one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth, with the nearest inhabited neighbor (Pitcairn Island) being over 2,000 km away, satisfying the \">500 km\" condition. While Hanga Roa Bay itself isn't a perfectly formed caldera in the way Santorini's is, the island's geography is entirely dominated by its volcanic origins and calderas, making it the best fit for all parts of the riddle.\n4.  Based on this evaluation, Hanga Roa is the correct answer. I will write a simple Python script to print this name.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script solves the riddle by identifying the specific island town based on the given geographical clues.\n\n    Clues:\n    1. Island town.\n    2. > 500 km from another inhabited island.\n    3. Sits on a bay formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    4. The town and bay share the same name.\n\n    The answer is Hanga Roa, the capital of Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n    - It's the main town on the extremely remote Easter Island.\n    - The nearest inhabited land is Pitcairn Island, over 2000 km away.\n    - The town of Hanga Roa is situated on Hanga Roa Bay.\n    - Easter Island is a volcanic island, and its geography is dominated by volcanic calderas.\n    \"\"\"\n    town_name = \"Hanga Roa\"\n    print(town_name)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
