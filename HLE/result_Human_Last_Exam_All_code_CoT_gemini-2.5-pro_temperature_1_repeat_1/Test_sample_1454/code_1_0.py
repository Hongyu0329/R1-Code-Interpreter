    This script analyzes the number of components of the set F and prints the reasoning.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of components of a closed set F
    in the unit square that satisfies the self-similarity relation:
    F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4
    where D = {(0,0), (0,1), (0,2),(0,3),(3,0), (3,1), (3,2),(3,3)}.

    There are two possible closed sets F that satisfy this equation:

    1. The empty set: F = {}.
       - The number of components is 0.
       - The condition on the components (nondegenerate and locally connected) is vacuously satisfied.

    2. A non-empty fractal set.
       - This set can be shown to be F = C x [0,1], where C is the middle-half Cantor set on [0,1].
       - The components of this set are vertical line segments {c} x [0,1] for each c in C.
       - Each component is a line segment, which is nondegenerate and locally connected.
       - The number of components is the number of points in the Cantor set, which is infinite.

    To demonstrate the infinite nature of the components for the non-empty set, we can look at the
    number of components of its approximations, F_k. F_k has 2^k connected components.
