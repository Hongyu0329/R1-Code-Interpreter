    Analyzes the provided biological text to determine the source of Dilp2 for neural stem cell reactivation.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  Two potential pathways for Dilp2 action are described:
        A. Neuronal transport from IPCs to DRNs.
        B. Secretion from IPCs into the hemolymph (blood).

    2.  Evidence for Pathway B (Hemolymph) is very strong. When Imp-L2, a Dilp2 binding protein, is overexpressed in the fat body, it specifically removes Dilp2 from the hemolymph.
        - Result: Neural stem cells FAIL to reactivate.
        - Conclusion: This shows that Dilp2 in the hemolymph is NECESSARY for reactivation.

    3.  Evidence for Pathway A (Neuronal Transport) is weaker.
        - When DRN activity is inhibited, reactivation is only DELAYED, not prevented. This suggests a supporting, not a primary, role.
        - The text explicitly states that DRNs might have functions independent of receiving Dilp2 from IPCs.

    4.  The most conclusive experiment is the fat body Imp-L2 overexpression, which isolates the hemolymph pathway and demonstrates its essential role.

    Therefore, Dilp2 secreted to the hemolymph is the source that drives reactivation.

    answer = 'B'
    explanation = "The most direct evidence comes from the experiment where overexpressing the Dilp2-binding protein Imp-L2 in the fat body, which secretes into the hemolymph, prevents neural stem cell reactivation. This indicates that the Dilp2 circulating in the hemolymph is the essential source for this process."
