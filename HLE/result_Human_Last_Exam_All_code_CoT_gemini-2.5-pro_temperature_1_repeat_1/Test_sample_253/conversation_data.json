    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute it.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define Rule 110**: First, I will represent the logic of Rule 110. The rule determines the state of a cell in the next generation based on its current state and the state of its immediate left and right neighbors. The rule number 110 is `01101110` in binary, which corresponds to the outputs for the 8 possible 3-cell neighborhood patterns (from `111` down to `000`). I'll use a dictionary for this, mapping each neighborhood pattern (e.g., `(1, 0, 1)`) to its resulting state.\n2.  **Set Up the Grid**: I'll create a one-dimensional grid (a list in Python) to represent the cells. To accommodate the pattern's growth over 20 generations, I'll make the grid wide enough so the pattern doesn't run off the edges. I will initialize the grid with all zeros, except for a single `1` in the center, as per the starting condition.\n3.  **Simulate the Generations**: I will loop 20 times, with each loop representing one generation. In each step, I'll compute the next state of the grid by iterating through each cell, looking at its 3-cell neighborhood, and applying Rule 110 to determine its new state. The results will be stored in a new grid to avoid modifying the current generation while it's still being read.\n4.  **Output the Final Pattern**: After 20 generations, I will take the final grid of cells. To provide a clean result, I will trim any leading or trailing zeros from the pattern and then print the final binary string as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the simulation and print the result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_rule_110():\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates Cellular Automaton Rule 110 for 20 generations\n    starting from a single '1' and prints the final pattern.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
