    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a toluene molecule (C7H8) using the 6-31G basis set, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the number of each type of atom** in the molecule. Toluene has 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n2.  **Determine the number of contracted basis functions for each atom type** with the 6-31G basis set.\n    *   **For Hydrogen (H):** The 1s orbital is described by two basis functions (a split-valence representation: one function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian). So, each H atom has 2 contracted basis functions.\n    *   **For Carbon (C):** The core 1s orbital is described by one basis function (a contraction of 6 primitives). The valence 2s and 2p orbitals are split. The inner part (2s, 2p) is described by 4 functions (one s, three p), and the outer part (2s, 2p) is also described by 4 functions (one s, three p). Total for C = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = 9 contracted basis functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total number of functions** by summing the contributions from all atoms in the molecule.\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print the final equation.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms for Toluene (C7H8)\nnum_C = 7\nnum_H = 8\n\n# Define the number of contracted basis functions for each atom in the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C): 1 core (1s) + 4 inner valence (2s, 2p) + 4 outer valence (2s, 2p) = 9\nfunctions_per_C = 9\n\n# For Hydrogen (H): 1 inner valence (1s) + 1 outer valence (1s) = 2\nfunctions_per_H = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Carbon atoms\ntotal_from_C = num_C * functions_per_C\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions from Hydrogen atoms\ntotal_from_H = num_H * functions_per_H\n\n# Calculate the grand total for the molecule\ntotal_functions = total_from_C + total_from_H\n\n# Print the breakdown and the final equation\nprint(f\"Toluene has {num_C} Carbon atoms and {num_H} Hydrogen atoms.\")\nprint(f\"In a 6-31G basis set:\")\nprint(f\"- Each Carbon atom contributes {functions_per_C} contracted Gaussian functions.\")\nprint(f\"- Each Hydrogen atom contributes {functions_per_H} contracted Gaussian functions.\")\nprint(\"\\nCalculating the total number of functions:\")\nprint(f\"({num_C} C atoms * {functions_per_C} functions/C) + ({num_H} H atoms * {functions_per_H} functions/H) = {total_functions}\")\nprint(f\"{total_from_C} + {total_from_H} = {total_functions}\")\n\n```\n<<<79>>>"
