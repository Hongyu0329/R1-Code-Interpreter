print("The statement 'every transient set must necessarily be finite' is false.")

print("1. A set A is transient if the expected number of visits to A, starting from a point x, is finite.")
print("   This is true if the sum of the Green's function over the set converges: Sum_{y in A} G(x, y) < infinity.")

print("\n3. We can choose an infinite set A = {y_1, y_2, ...} for which the sum of 1/||y_k||^2 converges.")
print("   A simple choice is the set of points on the positive x-axis: A = {(k, 0) | k = 1, 2, 3, ...}.")
print("\n4. For this set, the condition for transience becomes checking if the following sum is finite:")
print("   Sum_{k=1 to infinity} (1 / k^2)")
print("\n5. This is a well-known convergent series (the Basel problem). Its sum is pi^2 / 6.")

print(f"The exact value of the infinite sum is pi^2 / 6, which is approximately: {limit_value:.8f}")
print("\nSince the sum converges to a finite value, the infinite set A is transient.")
print("This proves the original statement is false.")
