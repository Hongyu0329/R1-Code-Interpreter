    # Based on the reasoning outlined in the thought process, the maximum number
    # of r-vertices is determined by analyzing the behavior of the Belyi function phi(x)
    # between its poles.
    #
    # If there are two or more r-vertices (poles) r_1 and r_2 in ]0, 1[, there must be
    # a local minimum c between them. The value phi(c) must be 0 or 1.
    #
    # 1. If phi(c) = 1, the vertex c becomes an isolated point in the dessin,
    #    violating the connectivity of the graph.
    # 2. If phi(c) = 0, the vertex c is a p-vertex. The problem's condition of the
    #    dessin being "simple with respect to ]0, 1[" is interpreted as excluding
    #    such internal p-vertices, as the only fundamental p-vertices are at 0 and 1.
    #
    # Both cases lead to a contradiction under the simplifying assumptions of the problem.
    # Therefore, having two or more r-vertices is not possible.
    # The maximum number must be less than 2.
    # A configuration with one r-vertex is possible.
    #
    # Hence, the maximum number of r-vertices is 1.
