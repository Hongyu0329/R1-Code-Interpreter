    This problem asks for the maximum number of r-vertices (poles) of a specific type of real Belyi function phi(x) in the interval ]0, 1[.

    Let N be the number of r-vertices in the interval ]0, 1[.

    1.  For the dessin d'enfant to be a connected graph on the real axis, the function phi(x) cannot change sign at its poles in ]0, 1[. This implies that any pole r in ]0, 1[ must have an even order.

    2.  Suppose there are two or more r-vertices, N >= 2. Let r_1 and r_2 be two adjacent poles in ]0, 1[.

    3.  Since phi(x) goes to +infinity at r_1 and r_2 (from within the interval (r_1, r_2)), the function must attain a local minimum at some point c between them, where r_1 < c < r_2.

    4.  At this point c, the derivative phi'(c) = 0. Because phi is a Belyi function, the critical value phi(c) must be in the set {0, 1, infinity}. Since c is a minimum, phi(c) cannot be infinity. So, phi(c) is either 0 or 1.

    5.  Case 1: phi(c) = 1.
        If the minimum value of phi(x) in (r_1, r_2) is 1, then for any x in a neighborhood of c, phi(x) >= 1. The edges of a dessin d'enfant are the preimages of the real interval [0, 1]. In this case, the preimage of [0, 1] near c is just the point c itself. This would make c an isolated vertex in the graph. A dessin d'enfant must be connected, so this is impossible.

    6.  Case 2: phi(c) = 0.
        This implies that c is a p-vertex. This configuration is possible in general. However, the term 'simple dessin with respect to J' imposes strong simplifying conditions. A key implication of such 'simplicity' is that the structure within the interval J=]0,1[ should be as simple as possible. This often means excluding features that are not strictly necessary. If we interpret "simple" as forbidding any 'internal' p-vertices (i.e., phi(x) has no zeros in ]0,1[), then this case is ruled out by definition.

    7.  Under the reasonable interpretation that a 'simple' dessin with respect to ]0, 1[ does not have p-vertices (zeros) within ]0, 1[, both cases lead to a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption N >= 2 must be false.

    8.  This leaves N < 2. The maximum integer value for N is 1. It is possible to construct a function satisfying all the conditions with N=1. For example, phi(x) = x(1-x) / (x - 1/2)^2.

    The maximum number of vertices labeled r is therefore 1.
