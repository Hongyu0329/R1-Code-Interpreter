    "The predictive ability of a polygenic score (PGS) is measured by how much of the variance in a phenotype (e.g., a disease or trait) it can explain in a new group of individuals. This is often denoted as R².\n\nSNP heritability (h²_SNP), on the other hand, is the *total* proportion of phenotypic variance that is attributable to all common genetic variants (SNPs) combined. It represents the theoretical upper limit or the ceiling of prediction possible using an ideal model that perfectly captures the effects of all SNPs.\n\nA PGS is a practical attempt to capture this SNP heritability. It is built using effect sizes estimated from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). However, this process is imperfect for several key reasons:\n\n1.  **Estimation Error:** GWASs are conducted on finite samples, so the estimated effect sizes for each SNP are not the true effect sizes; they contain statistical noise.\n2.  **Incomplete Information:** Not all causal variants may be included or perfectly tagged by the SNPs on the genotyping chip.\n3.  **Varying Conditions:** The populations used for the initial GWAS and for testing the PGS may have different genetic ancestries, linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, or environmental exposures, which can reduce the PGS's accuracy.\n\nBecause a PGS is an imperfect, real-world application, its predictive ability (R²) will inevitably be lower than the theoretical maximum potential (h²_SNP) that it is trying to capture.\n\nThe following Python script simulates this principle. It first defines a \"true\" genetic architecture for a phenotype, which sets the SNP heritability. Then, it simulates a GWAS with a finite sample size, which introduces errors into the effect size estimates. Finally, it builds a PGS with these imperfect estimates and measures its predictive R², demonstrating that it is lower than the true SNP heritability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import pearsonr\n\ndef demonstrate_pgs_heritability():\n    \"\"\"\n    A simulation to demonstrate that the predictive ability of a Polygenic Score (PGS)\n    is lower than the SNP heritability.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
