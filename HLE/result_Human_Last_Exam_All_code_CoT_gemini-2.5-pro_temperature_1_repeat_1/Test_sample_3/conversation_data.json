    "To find the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the number field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, we will use the known classification of such groups.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **List Known Groups:** I will start with the established mathematical classification of all possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. These groups are all of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/n_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/n_2\\mathbb{Z}$.\n2.  **Calculate Orders:** For each group in the list, I will calculate its order, which is simply the product $n_1 \\times n_2$.\n3.  **Identify the Maximum:** I will then find the maximum among these calculated orders. This will be the answer to the question.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan. It defines the list of possible non-cyclic groups, calculates their orders, and identifies the maximum, printing the final calculation as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef find_largest_torsion_subgroup_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the largest order of a non-cyclic torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve\n    over the number field Q(sqrt(-3)).\n    \"\"\"\n    # According to the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over Q(sqrt(-3)),\n    # the possible non-cyclic structures are:\n    # 1.
