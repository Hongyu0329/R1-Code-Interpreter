    # Step 1 & 2: The problem is to find the largest possible cardinality of the set of non-coastal points
    # in a hereditarily decomposable continuum. This is a theoretical question from topology.

    # Step 3: A key theorem by J. R. Prajs states that for any hereditarily decomposable continuum,
    # the set of non-coastal points is at most countable. This means its cardinality is either
    # a finite integer (0, 1, 2, ...) or countably infinite (the cardinality of natural numbers, Aleph_0).
    # So, Cardinality <= Aleph_0.

    # Step 4: The same author, Prajs, also constructed an example of a hereditarily decomposable continuum
    # (a specific type of fan) that has a countably infinite number of non-coastal points.
    # This shows that the upper bound of "countably infinite" is achievable.

    # Step 5: Combining these two facts, the largest possible cardinality is countably infinite.
    # We can represent this concept using the set of natural numbers, N = {1, 2, 3, ...},
    # whose cardinality is countably infinite.

    # We formulate a final symbolic equation to meet the prompt's requirements.
    final_equation = "max_cardinality = |{1, 2, 3, ...}|"

    # Per the instructions, we output the numbers from the final equation.
    print("The final equation is: " + final_equation)
    print("The numbers in the final equation are: 1, 2, 3")

    # The answer is the concept represented by the cardinality of this set.
    answer = "countably infinite"

    print("\nThe largest possible cardinality of the set of points where X fails to be coastal is countably infinite.")
