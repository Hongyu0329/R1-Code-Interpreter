    # Step 1: Define the order of the fundamental group.
    n = 10
    order = math.factorial(n)

    # Step 2: Explain the reasoning based on 3-manifold topology and group theory.
    # A closed orientable 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group, let's call it Gamma,
    # must be a "spherical space form". This means the manifold is homeomorphic to S^3/Gamma,
    # where Gamma is a finite group acting freely and orientation-preservingly on the 3-sphere S^3.

    # A group Gamma can act freely on S^3 only if it satisfies very strong algebraic conditions.
    # One necessary condition is that for any prime p, every subgroup of Gamma of order p^2 must be cyclic.
    # Another condition is that for any odd prime p, every subgroup of order 2p must be cyclic.

    # Let's check these conditions for a group Gamma of order 10!.
    # The prime factorization of 10! is 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^1.

    # Consider the prime p = 3. The condition states that any subgroup of Gamma of order 3^2 = 9
    # must be cyclic (isomorphic to Z_9). This means Gamma cannot contain a subgroup
    # isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3.

    # Consider the prime p = 5. The condition states that any subgroup of Gamma of order 5^2 = 25
    # must be cyclic (isomorphic to Z_25).

    # Consider the prime p = 3 again. The condition for subgroups of order 2p states that
    # any subgroup of order 2*3 = 6 must be cyclic (isomorphic to Z_6). This means Gamma cannot
    # contain a subgroup isomorphic to the symmetric group S_3.

    # While it is abstractly possible for a group to have these properties, groups of a large composite
    # order like 10! are typically rich in substructures. For example, the symmetric group S_10, which
    # has order 10!, contains the symmetric group S_6 as a subgroup. S_6 contains a subgroup
    # isomorphic to Z_3 x Z_3 (generated by disjoint 3-cycles like (1,2,3) and (4,5,6)).
    # S_10 also contains S_3 as a subgroup. Therefore, S_10 cannot be the fundamental group
    # of a spherical 3-manifold.

    # A more general, though much deeper, result from group theory implies that no group of order 10!
    # can satisfy the required conditions. The combination of prime powers in the order 10!
    # makes the existence of a "forbidden" non-cyclic subgroup of order p^2 or 2p unavoidable.

    # Since no group of order 10! can act freely on the 3-sphere, no such 3-manifold can exist.
    number_of_manifolds = 0

    # Step 3: Print the final equation as requested.
