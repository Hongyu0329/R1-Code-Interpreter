# Define the values for the Roman numerals
viii = 8
l = 50
xxx = 30
xxviiii = 29

# Perform the calculation based on the order of operations (division first)
result = (viii / l) - xxx - xxviiii

# Print the equation with modern numbers and the final answer
print(f"{viii} / {l} - {xxx} - {xxviiii} = {result}")
