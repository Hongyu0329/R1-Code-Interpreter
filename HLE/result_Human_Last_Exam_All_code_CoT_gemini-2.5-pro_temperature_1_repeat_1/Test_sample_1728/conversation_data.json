    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the chromatic number of the graph \\( G \\), which is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Understand the Graph Operation:** The \"sum\" of graphs, denoted by \\( + \\), refers to the graph join operation. The graph \\( G_1 + G_2 \\) is formed by taking the disjoint union of the vertices and edges of \\( G_1 \\) and \\( G_2 \\), and then adding an edge between every vertex of \\( G_1 \\) and every vertex of \\( G_2 \\).\n2.  **Chromatic Number of a Graph Join:** There is a fundamental property for the chromatic number of a graph join: \\( \\chi(G_1 + G_2) = \\chi(G_1) + \\chi(G_2) \\). This property extends to the sum of multiple graphs. For our graph \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), its chromatic number is \\( \\chi(G) = \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) + \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\).\n3.  **Chromatic Number of a Cycle (\\( C_n \\)):** The chromatic number of a cycle graph depends on whether its length \\( n \\) is even or odd (for \\( n \\geq 3 \\)):\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **even**, \\( C_n \\) is bipartite, so it can be colored with 2 colors. Thus, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 2 \\).\n    *   If \\( n \\) is **odd**, \\( C_n \\) requires 3 colors. Thus, \\( \\chi(C_n) = 3 \\).\n4.  **Find the Maximal Value:** The question asks for the *maximal* chromatic number of \\( G \\). To maximize \\( \\chi(G) = 3 \\times \\chi(C_n) \\), we must use the maximum possible value for \\( \\chi(C_n) \\). The maximum value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) is 3, which occurs when \\( n \\) is an odd number.\n5.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** By substituting the maximal value of \\( \\chi(C_n) \\) into our equation for \\( \\chi(G) \\), we get the maximal chromatic number for \\( G \\).\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to find the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_maximal_chromatic_number():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximal chromatic number of a graph G that is the\n    sum of three cycles of length n.\n\n    The logic is based on the properties of graph sums and cycle graphs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The chromatic number of a graph sum (join) G1 + G2 is chi(G1) + chi(G2).\n    # For G = C_n + C_n + C_n, we have chi(G) = 3 * chi(C_n).\n\n    # The chromatic number of a cycle C_n is:\n    # - 2, if n is even (n >= 4)\n    # - 3, if n is odd (n >= 3)\n\n    # To find the maximal chromatic number of G, we need the maximal\n    # value for the chromatic number of a single cycle, chi(C_n).\n    max_chi_cn = 3  # This occurs when n is odd.\n\n    # The number of cycles in the sum.\n    num_cycles = 3\n\n    # The maximal chromatic number of G is the sum of the maximal\n    # chromatic numbers of the individual cycles.\n    maximal_chi_g = num_cycles * max_chi_cn\n\n    print(f\"The chromatic number of the sum of three cycles is chi(G) = chi(C_n) + chi(C_n) + chi(C_n).\")\n    print(f\"To find the maximal chromatic number, we need the maximal value for chi(C_n).\")\n    print(f\"The maximal chromatic number for a cycle C_n is {max_chi_cn}, which occurs when n is odd.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThus, the maximal chromatic number for G is:\")\n    print(f\"{max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} + {max_chi_cn} = {maximal_chi_g}\")\n\n\nsolve_maximal_chromatic_number()\n<<<9>>>\n```"
