    # Step 1: Determine the longest possible program (maximum 'n').
    # A program's character count = (number of digits in n) + (n * 3 characters per statement).
    # This total must be <= 366.
    # By testing values for n:
    # If n = 121, total characters = 3 (for "121") + 121 * 3 = 3 + 363 = 366. (This fits)
    # If n = 122, total characters = 3 (for "122") + 122 * 3 = 3 + 366 = 369. (This is too large)
    max_n = 121

    print(f"   Therefore, the maximum number of statements is {max_n}.\n")

    # Step 2: Design an efficient C interpreter and identify its variables.
    # The interpreter reads 'n', then loops 'n' times. In each loop, it reads characters
    # one by one until it finds a '+' or '-', updates 'x', and discards the rest of the line.
    # This avoids storing entire statement strings in memory.

    print("2. The most memory-efficient C interpreter needs the following variables:")

    # Variable for n (number of statements)
    # Max value is 121. This fits in an int8 (1 byte).
    size_n = 1
    print(f"   - A variable 'n' to store the number of statements. Its maximum value is {max_n}, which fits in an int8. Memory size: {size_n} byte.")

    # Variable for x (the result)
    # The value of x will range from -121 to +121. This fits in a signed int8 (1 byte).
    size_x = 1
    print(f"   - A variable 'x' to store the result. Its range is [-{max_n}, {max_n}], which fits in a signed int8. Memory size: {size_x} byte.")

    # Variable for getchar()
    # In C, getchar() returns an 'int' to accommodate the special EOF value.
    # An 'int' in Xland is specified as 32 bits (4 bytes).
    size_c = 4
    print(f"   - A variable 'c' to read characters using getchar(). It must be a 32-bit int to handle the EOF value. Memory size: {size_c} bytes.")

    print("\n   No other variables or data structures are needed for this efficient implementation.\n")

    # Step 3: Calculate the total memory usage.
    total_memory = size_n + size_x + size_c
    print("3. The total memory is the sum of the sizes of these variables.")
