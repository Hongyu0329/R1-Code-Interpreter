    # Step 1: Analyze the geometric condition.
    # The problem considers a subset of the zero set of P, Z(P, T), inside a cylinder T.
    # The cylinder's direction is the z-axis, represented by the vector v = (0, 0, 1).
    # The tangent plane's normal vector at any point on the surface P(x,y,z)=0 is n = grad(P).
    # The angle `theta` between the tangent plane and the direction `v` is given by
    # sin(theta) = |n . v| / ||n||.
    # The condition is theta > 1/10, which means sin(theta) > sin(1/10).
    # Let c = sin(1/10), a positive constant.
    # The condition becomes |grad(P) . v| / ||grad(P)|| > c.
    # This simplifies to |∂P/∂z| / ||grad(P)|| > c.

    # Step 2: Establish an upper bound for k (k <= 1).
    # We want to find the number of unit balls to cover the specified surface subset, let's call it S'.
    # This number is proportional to the surface area of S'.
    # We can calculate the area by projecting S' onto the xy-plane.
    # The area element of the surface, dA, is related to the projected area element, dx dy, by:
    # dA = (||grad(P)|| / |∂P/∂z|) * dx * dy.
    # From the condition in Step 1, we have ||grad(P)|| / |∂P/∂z| < 1/c.
    # So, the area element is bounded: dA < (1/c) * dx * dy.
    #
    # Now, consider a vertical line at a point (x,y) in the cylinder's base. It intersects
    # the surface P(x,y,z)=0 at most D times, because P(x,y,z) is a polynomial of degree
    # at most D in z. This means the surface S' consists of at most D "sheets" over the xy-plane.
    # The base of the cylinder is a disk of thickness 1 (radius 1/2), with area A_disk = pi * (1/2)^2 = pi/4.
    #
    # The total area of S' is the integral of dA over the projected region.
    # Area(S') <= (Number of sheets) * Integral_{A_disk} (1/c) dx dy
    # Area(S') <= D * (1/c) * Area(A_disk) = D * (1/c) * (pi/4).
    # Since c and pi are constants, Area(S') = O(D).
    # The number of unit balls needed is O(Area(S')), so it is O(D^1).
    # This establishes an upper bound: k <= 1.

    # Step 3: Establish a lower bound for k (k >= 1).
    # We construct a polynomial of degree D for which the area is Omega(D).
    # Let T_D(u) be the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind of degree D.
    # Consider the polynomial P(x,y,z) = y - (1/2) * T_D(4z).
    # This is a nonsingular polynomial of degree D.
    # The surface is y = (1/2) * T_D(4z).
    # T_D(u) is defined for u in [-1, 1], so z must be in [-1/4, 1/4].
    # T_D(u) oscillates between -1 and 1, so y oscillates between -1/2 and 1/2.
    # The surface is contained within the cylinder T (where x^2+y^2 <= 1/4).
    #
    # The Chebyshev polynomial T_D(u) has D roots and oscillates D/2 times over [-1, 1].
    # This creates a "wavy sheet" or "curtain" surface. The total length of the curve
    # y = (1/2)*T_D(4z) projected onto the yz-plane is of order Omega(D).
    # The surface extends in the x-direction. Its total area can be shown to be Omega(D).
    # Furthermore, for most of this surface, the derivative ∂P/∂z is large,
    # satisfying the angle condition from Step 1.
    # To cover a surface of area A = Omega(D), one needs Omega(A) = Omega(D) unit balls.
    # This provides a lower bound: k >= 1.

    # Step 4: Conclusion.
    # From the upper bound (k <= 1) and the lower bound (k >= 1), we conclude that
    # the smallest possible value for k must be 1.
    # The final equation describes the number of balls as O(D^k). We need to find k.
    k = 1
