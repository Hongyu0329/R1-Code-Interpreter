    "To find the exact value of the angle $\\alpha$ for the A($\\alpha$)-stability of the BDF4 method, we follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Stability Region Boundary**: The boundary of the stability region is given by the curve $z(\\theta) = \\rho(e^{i\\theta})/\\sigma(e^{i\\theta})$ for $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, where $\\rho$ and $\\sigma$ are the characteristic polynomials of the BDF4 method.\n    *   $\\rho(\\zeta) = \\frac{25}{12}\\zeta^4 - 4\\zeta^3 + 3\\zeta^2 - \\frac{4}{3}\\zeta + \\frac{1}{4}$\n    *   $\\sigma(\\zeta) = \\zeta^4$\n2.  **Tangency Condition**: The angle $\\alpha$ is determined by the tangent to this boundary curve that passes through the origin. The condition for this is that the position vector $z(\\theta)$ is parallel to the tangent vector $z'(\\theta)$, which leads to a polynomial equation in terms of $x = \\cos(\\theta)$.\n3.  **Solve for Critical Angle**: Solving this polynomial equation yields the critical value $\\cos(\\theta_0) = 1/5$. This value corresponds to the point of tangency on the stability boundary.\n4.  **Calculate Tangent Point**: We substitute $\\cos(\\theta_0) = 1/5$ into the expressions for the real and imaginary parts of $z(\\theta_0) = x_0 + i y_0$.\n5.  **Determine $\\alpha$**: The stability angle $\\alpha$ satisfies the relation $\\tan(\\alpha) = -y_0/x_0$. The value is given in terms of $\\arctan()$.\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these calculations with exact arithmetic to find the precise expression for $\\alpha$.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_bdf4_stability_angle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the exact A(alpha)-stability angle for the BDF4 method.\n\n    The stability angle alpha is found by determining the tangent from the origin\n    to the stability boundary. This occurs at an angle theta_0 where\n    cos(theta_0) = 1/5. This script calculates the coordinates of the tangent\n    point (x0, y0) and then finds alpha from tan(alpha) = -y0/x0.\n    \"\"\"\n    # From the analysis of the tangency condition, we have cos(theta) = 1/5.\n    c = sympy.Rational(1, 5)\n    s = sympy.sqrt(1 - c**2)  # This will be sqrt(24)/5 = 2*sqrt(6)/5\n\n    # The stability boundary curve is z(theta) = x(theta) + i*y(theta).\n    # Its components are defined based on the BDF4 characteristic polynomial:\n    # x(theta) = 25/12 - 4*cos(theta) + 3*cos(2*theta) - 4/3*cos(3*theta) + 1/4*cos(4*theta)\n    # y(theta) = 4*sin(theta) - 3*sin(2*theta) + 4/3*sin(3*theta) - 1/4*sin(4*theta)\n    \n    # We need the values of sin(k*theta) and cos(k*theta).\n    # These can be computed using Chebyshev polynomial identities.\n    c1, s1 = c, s\n    c2 = 2*c**2 - 1\n    s2 = 2*s*c\n    c3 = 4*c**3 - 3*c\n    s3 = (4*c**2 - 1)*s\n    c4 = 8*c**4 - 8*c**2 + 1\n    s4 = (8*c**3 - 4*c)*s\n\n    # Calculate the coordinates (x0, y0) of the tangent point\n    x0 = sympy.Rational(25, 12) - 4*c1 + 3*c2 - sympy.Rational(4, 3)*c3 + sympy.Rational(1, 4)*c4\n    y0 = 4*s1 - 3*s2 + sympy.Rational(4, 3)*s3 - sympy.Rational(1, 4)*s4\n    \n    # Simplify the expressions to get exact rational values\n    x0_val = sympy.simplify(x0)\n    y0_val = sympy.simplify(y0)\n\n    # The stability angle alpha is given by tan(alpha) = -y0/x0\n    tan_alpha = sympy.simplify(-y0_val / x0_val)\n\n    # The result contains sqrt(6).
