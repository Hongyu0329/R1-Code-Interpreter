    "Here is my thinking process for solving this problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Question:** The user wants to identify the most likely mechanism responsible for two outcomes after a gene duplication event:\n    *   **Retention:** Both copies of the gene are kept in the genome over evolutionary time.\n    *   **Divergence:** The two copies accumulate differences in their sequence and, consequently, their function or regulation.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n    *   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene sequence replaces another homologous sequence. This makes the two gene copies *more similar*, which is the opposite of divergence. So, this is incorrect.\n    *   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is when one copy of the gene accumulates mutations that make it non-functional. While this involves divergence (the pseudogene changes), it doesn't explain the *retention* of two *functional* gene copies, which is the focus of the main models. So, this is an outcome, but not the mechanism for retaining two working genes.\n    *   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy retains the original function, while the second copy accumulates mutations that give it a completely new, beneficial function. This explains both retention (the original function is needed, and the new one is advantageous) and divergence (the second copy must change to acquire the new function). This is a very strong candidate.\n    *   **D. Subfunctionalization:** In this model, the ancestral gene had multiple functions (e.g., it was expressed in different tissues or at different times). After duplication, each copy loses a different subset of the original functions through degenerative mutations. As a result, both copies are now required to cover all the original functions. This explains retention (both are now necessary) and divergence (they diverge as they lose different functions and specialize). This is also a very strong candidate.\n    *   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage rapidly diversifies into many species. While gene duplication can provide the raw genetic material that fuels adaptive radiation, it is not the molecular mechanism that acts on the genes themselves. This is the wrong level of explanation.\n\n3.  **Compare the Strongest Candidates (C and D):**\n    *   Both neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D) are accepted, important mechanisms that explain the retention and divergence of duplicated genes.\n    *   The question asks for the \"most likely\" mechanism. This invites a comparison of their probability.\n    *   Subfunctionalization is often considered more likely, at least as an initial step. This is because it is driven by degenerative mutations (breaking or losing a part of a function), which are far more common than the specific, beneficial, gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization.\n    *   By preserving both gene copies through a neutral or nearly-neutral process, subfunctionalization provides a stable intermediate state. This allows the duplicated genes to persist for long evolutionary periods, increasing the chance that one of them might later acquire a new function (neofunctionalization).\n    *   Therefore, subfunctionalization is a highly plausible and frequent route for preserving duplicated genes, making it a strong answer for the \"most likely\" mechanism.\n\n4.  **Plan the Code:** I will write a Python script to formalize this reasoning. The script will not compute a numerical answer but will programmatically analyze the options based on the criteria from the question, explain the elimination of incorrect choices, compare the two best choices, and print a final conclusion. This fulfills the user's request to use coding skills to solve the task.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef analyze_gene_duplication_fates():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the potential mechanisms for retention and divergence of duplicate genes.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The core requirements from the question\n    criteria = [\"Retention of both copies\", \"Divergence of function/sequence\"]\n\n    # Define the answer choices\n    mechanisms = {\n        'A': {\n            \"name\": \"Gene conversion\",\n            \"description\": \"A process where one DNA sequence replaces a homologous sequence, leading to sequence homogenization.\",\n            \"meets_retention\": False,\n            \"meets_divergence\": False,\n            \"reason\": \"This mechanism works against divergence by making gene copies more similar.\"\n        },\n        'B': {\n            \"name\": \"Pseudogenization\",\n            \"description\": \"One gene copy becomes non-functional due to deleterious mutations.\",\n            \"meets_retention\": False,\n            \"meets_divergence\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"This explains divergence but represents the loss of a functional copy, not retention of two functional copies.\"\n        },\n        'C': {\n            \"name\": \"Neofunctionalization\",\n            \"description\": \"One copy retains the original function, while the other gains a new, beneficial function.\",\n            \"meets_retention\": True,\n            \"meets_divergence\": True,\n            \"reason\": \"Explains both retention (old function is kept, new is beneficial) and divergence (to create the new function).
