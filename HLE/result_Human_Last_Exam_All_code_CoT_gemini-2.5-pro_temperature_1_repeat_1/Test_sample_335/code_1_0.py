# The overall task is to compute floor(10^6 * V), where V is the simplicial volume
# of the complement of the knot K = C_{4,3}(Conway) # Wh_-^2(Eight).

# Step 1: Use the additivity of simplicial volume for connected sums.
# V = V_1 + V_2, where:
# V_1 = ||S^3 \ C_{4,3}(Conway)||
# V_2 = ||S^3 \ Wh_-^2(Eight)||

# Step 2: Calculate V_1.
# The formula for the simplicial volume of a cabled knot C_{p,q}(C) is |p| * ||S^3 \ C||.
# For K_1 = C_{4,3}(Conway), p = 4 and C is the Conway knot.
p_cable = 4
# The Conway knot is a slice knot, so the simplicial volume of its complement is 0.
V_Conway = 0
V_1 = p_cable * V_Conway
print(f"Calculation of V_1 (simplicial volume for C_{4,3}(Conway)):")
print(f"V_1 = |p| * ||S^3 \ C|| = {p_cable} * {V_Conway} = {V_1}")

# Step 3: Calculate V_2.
# The formula for the simplicial volume of a satellite knot P(C) with non-zero winding number w is |w| * ||S^3 \ C||.
# For K_2 = Wh_-^2(Eight), the companion C is the figure-8 knot.
# The simplicial volume of the figure-8 knot complement is 2.
V_Eight = 2
# The pattern is the 2-twisted Whitehead double. The winding number w is 2*t, where t is the number of twists.
# Here t=2.
num_twists = 2
w_whitehead = 2 * num_twists
V_2 = abs(w_whitehead) * V_Eight
print(f"\nCalculation of V_2 (simplicial volume for Wh_-^2(Eight)):")
print(f"V_2 = |w| * ||S^3 \ C|| = {abs(w_whitehead)} * {V_Eight} = {V_2}")

# Step 4: Calculate the total simplicial volume V.
V = V_1 + V_2
print(f"\nTotal simplicial volume V:")
print(f"V = V_1 + V_2 = {V_1} + {V_2} = {V}")

# Step 5: Compute the final requested value.
factor = 10**6
final_value = math.floor(factor * V)
print(f"\nFinal calculation:")
print(f"floor(10^6 * V) = floor({factor} * {V}) = floor({factor * V}) = {final_value}")

# Final Answer in requested format
print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"{final_value}")
