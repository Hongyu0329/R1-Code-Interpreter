      so that each vertex is incident to at least one edge in each class.
    - N(G) is the count of G's slices.

    # M(0) is the smallest m where N(G) is a multiple of 0. This requires N(G) = 0.
    # A theorem by Isaacs states that a cubic graph has N(G) = 0 (no slices)
    # if and only if the graph has a bridge.
    # We therefore need to find the number of vertices in the smallest simple cubic
    # graph that contains a bridge.
    # Through construction, it can be shown that such a graph is formed by joining two
    # identical 5-vertex "tendrils" with a bridge. Each tendril is a K_4 graph
    # with one edge subdivided by a new vertex.

    # The number of slices for K_4 can be calculated as N(K_4) = 9.
    # The calculation is N(G) = (2^|E| - S) / 2, where S is the number of
    # 2-edge-colorings with at least one monochromatic vertex.
    # For K_4, |V|=4, |E|=6. N(K_4) = (2^6 - 46) / 2 = (64 - 46) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9.

    # For m=6: There are two cubic graphs, the prism graph (N=21) and K_3,3 (N=33).
    # Neither 21 nor 33 is a multiple of 5.
    # For m=8: There are five cubic graphs. One is the cube graph (skeleton of a 3D cube).
    # The number of slices for the cube graph is N(G_cube) = 90.
