# The problem simplifies to calculating a definite integral, which has an
# analytical solution of the form: 3 * ln(A / B).
# We will now compute this value.

# Define the constant 'e'
e = math.e

# Define the numbers in the final analytical equation
A = 3
B = e**2 + e + 1

# Calculate the final result
spatial_average = 3 * math.log(A / B)

print("The final equation for the spatial average is: 3 * ln(A / B)")

print(f"The value of the denominator term B (e^2 + e + 1) is: {B}")
