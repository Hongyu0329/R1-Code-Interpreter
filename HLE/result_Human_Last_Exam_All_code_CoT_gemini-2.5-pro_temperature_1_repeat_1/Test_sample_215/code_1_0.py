# This script explains the logic for determining the number of chemotypes from the R code.

# A "chemotype" refers to a distinct chemical profile. If all individuals in a group
# are generated from the same statistical process, they belong to one chemotype.

# Analysis of the R script's `generate_chemistry` function:
# 1. A single `baseline` vector is created for each call to the function.
# 2. This exact same `baseline` is subtracted from every specimen generated during that call.
# 3. The function is called separately for the 'control' and 'water_stress' groups.

# For the control group:
# The function is called once. All generated control specimens have the same baseline subtracted.
# This means they are all statistical replicates of a single profile.
# Therefore, we expect only one chemotype in the control group.
num_chemotypes_control = 1

# For the water-stressed group:
# The function is called a second time. A new, different baseline is generated.
# All water-stressed specimens have this new baseline subtracted.
# Within this group, all specimens are again replicates of a single profile.
# Therefore, we also expect only one chemotype in the water-stressed group.
num_chemotypes_water_stress = 1

# The final answer is the number of chemotypes expected in each group respectively.
print(f"Expected number of chemotypes in the control group = {num_chemotypes_control}")
print(f"Expected number of chemotypes in the water-stressed group = {num_chemotypes_water_stress}")
