    This function calculates the order type of the set X based on the provided set-theoretic problem.

    The argument proceeds as follows:
    1. The 'head tail weak Delta-system' property is shown to imply that for any kappa-sized family,
       at most one set can have cardinality kappa.
    2. This implies that the collection of indices alpha for which |a_alpha| = kappa has size less than kappa.
    3. We can therefore focus on the kappa-sized family of sets where |a_alpha| < kappa.
    4. By Hajnal's Free Set Theorem, for such a family, a free set of size kappa exists.
    5. If a free set of size kappa exists, free sets of all smaller infinite cardinalities also exist.
    6. Kappa is omega_7. The infinite cardinals less than or equal to kappa are omega_0, omega_1, ..., omega_7.
    7. The set X of possible free set sizes is {omega_0, omega_1, omega_2, omega_3, omega_4, omega_5, omega_6, omega_7}.
    8. The number of elements in this set determines its order type.
