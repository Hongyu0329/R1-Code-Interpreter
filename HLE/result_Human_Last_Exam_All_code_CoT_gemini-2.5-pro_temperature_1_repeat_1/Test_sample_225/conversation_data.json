    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  First, I'll identify the given parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)` as defining a specific type of curve known as a Lissajous curve.\n2.  Self-intersection points on a Lissajous curve can be determined using a standard formula, which saves us from complex manual calculations.\n3.  The formula for the number of self-intersections `N` of a curve `x = cos(at)`, `y = sin(bt)` depends on the integer parameters `a` and `b`.\n4.  For this problem, we have `a = 9` and `b = 5`. These two numbers are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1) and they are both odd.\n5.  The specific formula for a Lissajous curve where `a` and `b` are coprime odd integers is `N = (a - 1)(b - 1) / 2`.\n6.  Finally, I will provide a Python script that calculates the number of self-intersections using this formula and prints out the complete calculation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\n# Define the parameters 'a' and 'b' from the curve equations x=cos(at) and y=sin(bt)\na = 9\nb = 5\n\n# The number of self-intersections for a Lissajous curve with coprime odd parameters a and b\n# is calculated using the formula: (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2.\n# We first check if the parameters meet the criteria.\n#\n# 1. Check if a and b are integers (they are).\n# 2. Check if a and b are odd.\nis_a_odd = a % 2 != 0\nis_b_odd = b % 2 != 0\n#\n# 3. Check if a and b are coprime. We can use a simple function for gcd.\ndef gcd(p, q):\n    while q:\n        p, q = q, p % q\n    return p\n\nare_coprime = gcd(a, b) == 1\n\n# If all conditions are met, we can apply the formula.\nif isinstance(a, int) and isinstance(b, int) and is_a_odd and is_b_odd and are_coprime:\n    # Calculate the number of self-intersections\n    intersections = (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\n\n    # Print the equation with the numbers plugged in, and the final result.\n    # The result should be an integer.\n    print(f\"The number of self-intersection points for the curve (cos({a}t), sin({b}t)) is calculated as:\")\n    print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = {int(intersections)}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"The formula for coprime odd integers does not apply to the given parameters.\")\n\n```\n<<<16>>>"
