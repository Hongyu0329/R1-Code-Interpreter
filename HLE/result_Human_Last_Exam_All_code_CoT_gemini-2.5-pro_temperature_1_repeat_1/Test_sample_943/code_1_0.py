# The problem is to find K in the expression for the slice rank of a tensor.
# The slice rank is given as (3 / 2^K)^n * e^(o(n)). The base of this
# asymptotic formula is (3 / 2^K).

# Step 1: Determine the asymptotic base of the tensor's slice rank.
# The tensor is T_n = T_1^{\otimes n} - J_n, where T_1(x,y,z) = x+y+z.
# The asymptotic behavior of the slice rank is determined by a value Q(T_1),
# which is the asymptotic slice rank of the base tensor T_1.
# Through methods of algebraic geometry and tensor analysis, it can be shown
# that T_1 is equivalent to the W-tensor under a change of basis.
# The asymptotic slice rank of the W-tensor is a known quantity.
asymptotic_rank_base = 2

# Step 2: Set up the equation based on the problem statement.
# We equate the calculated asymptotic base with the given formula's base.
# The numbers in the given formula are the numerator 3 and the base 2.
num = 3
den = 2
# The final equation is: 2 = 3 / (2^K)

# Step 3: Solve the equation for K.
# 2 * 2^K = 3
# 2^(K+1) = 3
# K+1 = log2(3)
# K = log2(3) - 1
# K = log2(3/2)
K = math.log2(num / den)

# Step 4: Output the numbers from the equation and the final value of K.
