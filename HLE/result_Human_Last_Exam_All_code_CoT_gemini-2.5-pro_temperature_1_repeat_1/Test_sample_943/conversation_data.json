    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem and find the value of K.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: The problem asks for the value of $K$ in an expression for the asymptotic slice rank of a specific tensor. The slice rank is given as $(3/2^K)^n e^{o(n)}$. This means the base of the exponential growth of the slice rank is $3/2^K$.\n2.  **Analyze the Tensor**: The tensor is $T_n(x, y, z) = \\prod_{i=1}^n (x_i + y_i + z_i) - 1$. This tensor is constructed from a smaller, base tensor. It can be seen as the $n$-th tensor power of the $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ tensor $T_1(x, y, z) = x+y+z$, from which the all-ones tensor $J_n$ (which has slice rank 1) is subtracted.\n3.  **Determine the Asymptotic Slice Rank**: The asymptotic behavior of the slice rank of $T_n$ is determined by the asymptotic slice rank of the base tensor $T_1$, denoted as $Q(T_1)$. The subtraction of the slice-rank-1 tensor $J_n$ does not change the asymptotic base. So, we need to find $Q(T_1)$.\n4.  **Use Polynomial Equivalence**: The tensor $T_1$ is symmetric. For such tensors, the asymptotic slice rank $Q(T_1)$ is invariant under invertible linear transformations of the underlying vector space. We can analyze $T_1$ by studying its associated homogeneous polynomial, $P(v) = T_1(v,v,v)$. A calculation shows this polynomial is $P(v_0, v_1) = 3v_1(v_0+v_1)^2$.\n5.  **Identify with a Known Tensor**: Through a linear change of basis, the polynomial $3v_1(v_0+v_1)^2$ is equivalent to the canonical form $c \\cdot x^2y$. The tensor corresponding to the polynomial $x^2y$ is known as the W-tensor. It is a well-established result in tensor literature that the asymptotic slice rank of the W-tensor is 2. Thus, $Q(T_1) = 2$.\n6.  **Formulate and Solve the Equation**: We can now equate the base of the slice rank we determined with the one given in the problem statement:\n    $Q(T_1) = 3/2^K$\n    $2 = 3/2^K$\n7.  **Calculate K**: Solving the equation for $K$ gives $2^{K+1} = 3$, which leads to $K = \\log_2(3) - 1 = \\log_2(3/2)$.\n8.  **Final Code**: I will provide a Python script that implements this calculation and prints the result, including the numbers from the final equation as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The problem is to find K in the expression for the slice rank of a tensor.\n# The slice rank is given as (3 / 2^K)^n * e^(o(n)).
