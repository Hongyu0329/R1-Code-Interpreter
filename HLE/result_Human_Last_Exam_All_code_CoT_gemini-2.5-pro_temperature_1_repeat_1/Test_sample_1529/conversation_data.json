    "To find the minimal discriminant of the curve defined by $y^2=x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Interpret the question**: The given equation defines a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. The term \"minimal discriminant\" for such curves is a concept from algebraic geometry that involves finding an optimal integral model. However, in a computational context like this, a common interpretation is to calculate the discriminant of the polynomial on the right-hand side, $f(x) = x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$. The \"minimal\" aspect suggests that we should ensure that no simple change of variables leads to a model with a discriminant of a smaller absolute value.\n2.  **Analyze the model**: I will check if basic transformations, such as $x \\to x+c$ or $x \\to kx$, can simplify the model to one with a smaller discriminant.\n    *   A translation $x \\to x+c$ does not change the discriminant of the polynomial.\n    *   A scaling $x \\to kx$ (with appropriate scaling of $y$) for an integer $k>1$ leads to a model whose discriminant has a larger absolute value.\n    This suggests that the given model may already be the \"minimal\" one in this simplified sense.\n3.  **Calculate the discriminant**: I will use Python with the `sympy` library to compute the discriminant of the polynomial $f(x)$. This is a standard algebraic computation.\n4.  **Present the result**: The final code will calculate the discriminant and print it. To fulfill the request to \"output each number in the final equation\", I will also show the prime factorization of the discriminant, which forms a multiplicative equation for the result.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_curve_discriminant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimal discriminant of the curve y^2 = x^6 + 2x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1.\n\n    The minimal discriminant of a hyperelliptic curve is interpreted here as the\n    discriminant of the polynomial on the right-hand side, as simple transformations\n    do not yield a model with a smaller discriminant.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable\n    x = sympy.Symbol('x')\n\n    # Define the polynomial f(x) from the equation y^2 = f(x)\n    # The coefficients are 1, 2, 4, 4, 1 for the powers x^6, x^3, x^2, x, and the constant term.\n    f = x**6 + 2*x**3 + 4*x**2 + 4*x + 1\n\n    # Calculate the discriminant of the polynomial f(x)\n    disc = sympy.discriminant(f, x)\n\n    # The discriminant is a single integer value.
