    "This is a classic poker tournament scenario involving stack size, position, and the ICM (Independent Chip Model) pressure of the money bubble. Here is a step-by-step plan to arrive at the correct answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Situation**: We are in an early position (UTG+1) with a short stack (16 big blinds). The key factor is being \"near the money bubble,\" which means players will be more cautious and avoid risking their tournament life, leading to them folding more often. This is called \"fold equity.\"\n2.  **Formulate a Strategy**: With a 16bb stack, raising and then folding to a 3-bet is not a good option, as it commits too much of our stack. The best strategy is to move all-in (\"jam\" or \"shove\") or fold. Our goal is to find which hands are profitable to shove.\n3.  **Establish a Shoving Range**: A standard all-in shoving range from UTG+1 with 16bb is relatively tight because many players are left to act. A typical range includes strong pairs, strong aces, and strong broadway hands. A good baseline is `77+, ATs+, KJs+, AJo+, KQo`. The bubble pressure makes shoving hands in this range even more profitable.\n4.  **Evaluate the Options**: We will check each hand choice against this established range.\n    *   **QJs**: This is slightly too weak. The standard is `KJs` or better.\n    *   **99**: This fits into the `77+` category and is a strong hand to shove.\n    *   **AJo**: This is at the bottom of the `AJo+` range, making it a standard, albeit borderline, shove.\n    *   **AKo**: This is a premium hand and an obvious, mandatory shove.\n5.  **Select the Best Answer**: Since `99`, `AJo`, and `AKo` are all correct shoves, we must decide which is the best answer. `AKo` is almost too obvious. `AJo` is the weakest of the correct options. `99` is a perfect example of a strong, non-premium hand that is a clear and profitable shove in this specific spot, balancing its strength when called with the significant fold equity gained from the bubble pressure. It's a classic example of applying bubble pressure correctly.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes a poker tournament scenario to determine the optimal hand to shove with.\n    It defines a standard shoving range and evaluates the given options against it.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
