    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the reactants and reaction conditions:** The starting material is 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene, and it reacts with an excess of phenyl magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent) under reflux conditions, followed by an aqueous work-up.\n2.  **Determine the reaction type and mechanism:** This is a Grignard reaction with a polyhalogenated aromatic compound. The conditions (excess reagent, high temperature) suggest that all halogen atoms will be substituted by the phenyl group from the Grignard reagent. This occurs via a series of coupling reactions.\n3.  **Evaluate the reactivity of the leaving groups:** The halogens on the benzene ring have different reactivities. The order of reactivity for substitution in such reactions is I > Br > Cl. Therefore, the iodine atom will be replaced first, followed by the two bromine atoms.\n4.  **Identify the final product:** After the stepwise substitution of all three halogens (one iodine and two bromines) with phenyl groups, the final product will have a central benzene ring with three phenyl substituents at the original positions of the halogens (1, 2, and 3).\n5.  **Determine the IUPAC name:** I will apply the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) rules to name the final product structure.\n6.  **Write the Python code:** I will create a Python script that prints the final IUPAC name. The name itself contains the necessary numbers (1, 2, and 3) as locants, satisfying the user's instructions.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_product_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the IUPAC name of the product from the reaction of 1,3-dibromo-2-iodobenzene\n    with excess phenyl magnesium bromide.\n\n    The reaction proceeds via substitution of all halogens by phenyl groups.\n    The order of reactivity for substitution is I > Br.\n\n    Reaction scheme:\n    1.
