# The goal is to compute inf_{f in S} f(pi).
# From the derivation, this value is given by the expression:
# pi / ((pi + 1) * log(pi + 1))

# Let's calculate the value of each component of the equation.
pi_val = math.pi
pi_plus_1 = pi_val + 1
log_pi_plus_1 = math.log(pi_plus_1)

# Now, calculate the final result.
denominator = pi_plus_1 * log_pi_plus_1
result = pi_val / denominator

# As requested, we will output each number in the final equation.
