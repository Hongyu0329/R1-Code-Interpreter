    explanation = """
The key to understanding the limitation lies in the nature of a "bulk" experiment. Bulk measurements, like calorimetry or UV absorption, analyze a massive population of molecules simultaneously and record an average signal.

Let's evaluate the choices:
A. Heat capacity change is assumed to be zero: This is a common simplification in the *model* used to interpret the data, not a fundamental limitation of the *experiment* itself. More complex models can be used.
B. The NNBP parameters are T-independent: This is also a modeling assumption, directly related to choice A. It's not an inherent experimental limitation.
C. Impossibility to capture heterogeneity in bulk experiments: This is the correct answer. A bulk experiment averages the behavior of all molecules. If there are subpopulations that melt at slightly different temperatures, have different conformations, or follow different unfolding pathways, this information is lost in the average. The experiment cannot distinguish this molecular heterogeneity, which is a fundamental limitation of measuring an ensemble.
D. Temperature oscillations are too large: This is an experimental imperfection. The question specifies "ideal experimental conditions," where such issues would be negligible.
E. Temperature cannot be controlled: This is incorrect. Calorimetry relies on precise temperature control and measurement.

Therefore, the inability to resolve the behavior of individual molecules or subpopulations (heterogeneity) is the fundamental limitation of the bulk method.
