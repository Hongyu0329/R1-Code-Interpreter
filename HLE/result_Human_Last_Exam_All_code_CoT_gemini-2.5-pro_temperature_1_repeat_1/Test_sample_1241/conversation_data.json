    "To find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$, we need to determine the steady-state probabilities of the system. At steady state ($t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ become constant, which means their derivatives $P_i'(t)$ are equal to zero. Let's denote the steady-state probabilities as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$.\n\nThe system of differential equations becomes a system of linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n2.  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n3.  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n4.  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n5.  $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$ (This is the normalization condition)\n\nMy plan is to solve this system of linear equations to find the values of $p_0$ and $p_1$, and then calculate their sum.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan for the Python code:\n1.  Define the given $\\lambda$ coefficients as variables.\n2.  Use the steady-state equations (where derivatives are zero) to express $p_0$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$.\n3.  Substitute these expressions into the normalization equation ($p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$).\n4.  Solve the resulting equation for $p_1$.\n5.  Calculate $p_0$ using the relationship found in step 2.\n6.  Finally, compute the sum $p_0 + p_1$.\n7.  The code will print out each step of the calculation with the numerical values to show how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_markov_chain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves for the steady-state probabilities of the given Kolmogorov-Chepmen system\n    and calculates P0(inf) + P1(inf).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given lambda values\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Set up the steady-state equations (P'(t) = 0).
