    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, I will find a closed-form expression for the infinite product. The strategy involves these steps:\n1.  Rewrite the product starting from n=3 as a ratio of two products, with the numerator starting from n=1.\n2.  Factor the term `(1 - z³/n³)` into three parts using the complex cube roots of unity.\n3.  Use the Weierstrass product representation for the Gamma function, which provides a known value for products of the form `Π(1 - x/n)`.\n4.  Combine these results to get the final analytical formula.\n\nSecond, I will write a Python script that implements this formula. The script will:\n1.  Define a function that takes the complex variable `z` as an input.\n2.  Use the `numpy` library for complex number calculations and the `scipy` library for the Gamma function, which works with complex arguments.\n3.  The function will print a breakdown of the calculation, showing how each part of the formula contributes to the final result, thereby displaying all the numbers involved in the equation as requested.\n4.  Finally, I will demonstrate the script's usage with an example value, `z = 0.5`.\n\nHere is the derivation:\nThe infinite product is given by:\n$$ P = \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) $$\nWe can express this using the product starting from n=1:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\nThe term `(1 - z³/n³)` can be factored as `(1 - z/n)(1 - zω/n)(1 - zω²/n)`, where `ω = e^(i2π/3)` is a complex cube root of unity.\nSo the infinite product from n=1 becomes:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right) $$\nA known identity related to the Gamma function states:\n$$ \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{x^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega)\\Gamma(1-x\\omega^2)} $$\nThis identity comes from combining the Weierstrass product representations for each of the three Gamma functions.\n\nCombining everything, the final expression for the product starting from n=3 is:\n$$ P = \\frac{1}{\\left(1-z^3\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{8}\\right)\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)} $$\nNow, here is the Python code to compute this value.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.special import gamma\n\ndef calculate_infinite_product(z):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the value of the infinite product Prod_{n=3 to inf} (1 - z^3/n^3).\n\n    The function uses a closed-form expression involving the Gamma function:\n    1 / ( (1 - z^3/1) * (1 - z^3/8) * Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*w) * Gamma(1-z*w^2) )\n    where w is the complex cube root of unity.\n\n    Args:\n        z (complex or float): The value of z in the expression.\n\n    Returns:\n        complex: The result of the infinite product.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the principal cube root of unity, omega = e^(i*2*pi/3)\n    omega = np.exp(2j * np.pi / 3)\n    # The other non-real root is omega^2\n    omega2 = omega**2\n\n    # The product starts from n=3.
