    "My plan is to analyze the core principles of both the Vaganova and Balanchine ballet methods, specifically as they apply to the *cambré derrière* (a bend to the back). I will break down the movement and compare the technical requirements of each style against the provided answer choices to identify the most significant and fundamental difference.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method Analysis:** In the Vaganova method, a *cambré derrière* emphasizes strict academic purity. The primary rule is to keep the hips square and level to the front. The bend originates from the upper and middle back, with the head following the line of the spine, lifting the chin to look up. The goal is a pure, supported backward arch without twisting the torso or displacing the hips.\n\n2.  **Balanchine Method Analysis:** The Balanchine style, a neoclassical approach, often prioritizes speed, dynamism, and extended lines. In a *cambré derrière*, the Balanchine technique frequently allows or encourages the hip of the gesturing leg to lift and open. This creates a beautiful, sweeping spiral through the torso and allows the dancer to achieve a more expansive and visually dramatic position. This is a distinct break from the Vaganova rule of square hips.\n\n3.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   **A. Arm placement:** While stylistic differences exist, they are not the most defining distinction.\n    *   **B. Placement of hip:** This is a core difference. Vaganova insists on square hips, while Balanchine allows the hip to open. This fundamentally changes the alignment and mechanics of the entire movement.\n    *   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine is known for speed, a *cambré* is an adagio movement, and its execution speed is not its defining technical characteristic.\n    *   **D. Degree of backbend:** The degree is a result of flexibility and the technique used, not the technical difference itself. The open hip in Balanchine can facilitate a deeper-looking bend.\n    *   **E. Placement of head:** Head placement is also different (Vaganova follows the spine, Balanchine often looks over the shoulder), but this is largely a consequence of the hip placement. The open hip facilitates the spiral that allows the head to turn more dramatically.\n\nTherefore, the most fundamental and defining difference is the placement of the hip.\n\n```python\ndef explain_ballet_difference():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains the difference between a cambré derrière in the Vaganova and Balanchine methods.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    title = \"Analysis of Cambré Derrière: Vaganova vs. Balanchine\"\n    print(title)\n    print(\"-\" * len(title))\n\n    vaganova_desc = \"In the Vaganova method, the technique for a cambré derrière demands that the hips remain perfectly square and aligned to the front.
