    balanchine_desc = "In the Balanchine method, there is a distinct stylistic choice to allow the hip to lift and open. This creates a spiral in the torso and a more dynamic, expansive line, which is a departure from the strictness of the Vaganova school."

    conclusion = "The most fundamental difference between the two methods for this specific step lies in the alignment of the hips. Vaganova requires them to be square, while Balanchine allows them to open. This makes 'Placement of hip' the correct answer."
