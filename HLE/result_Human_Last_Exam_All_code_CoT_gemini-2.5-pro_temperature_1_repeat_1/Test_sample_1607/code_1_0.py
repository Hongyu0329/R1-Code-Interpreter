def solve_quantum_symmetries():
    """
    This function determines the correct statements about quantum symmetries and prints the result.

    The analysis of each statement is as follows:
    A: False. Generators can have continuous spectra (e.g., momentum).
    B: False. Part B2 is false because the scaling factor for the transformation generated by τ = xp+px is incorrect.
    C: False. [τ, H] = 0 is a necessary and sufficient condition.
    D: True. If [τ, H] = 0, τ maps energy eigenstates to other eigenstates with the same energy.
    E: True. L_z is the generator of rotations about the z-axis.
    F: True. This is a statement of Noether's theorem via the Heisenberg equation of motion.
    G: True. Unitarity of S(θ) = exp(-iθτ) implies τ is Hermitian.
    H: False. Unbounded operators can have discrete spectra (e.g., QHO Hamiltonian).
    I: True. For non-commuting generators, the group composition is not simply additive in the exponent (BCH formula).
    J: True. If [S, H] = 0, S maps energy eigenstates to other eigenstates with the same energy.

    The true statements are D, E, F, G, I, J.
