    "Of course. Here is my plan to answer your question.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge (Knowledge = Justified + True + Belief) under the constraint that our only epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. I will also specifically ignore Gettier-style problems.\n\nMy goal is to identify two distinct issues that arise from this definition.\n\n1.  **The Problem of Justification:** I will examine the \"Justified\" (J) component. If every justification itself needs to be justified, this can lead to an infinite regress. The JTB model doesn't inherently solve this, creating a foundational problem for what counts as adequate justification.\n2.  **The Problem of Truth:** I will examine the \"True\" (T) component. This condition is external to the believer's perspective. A person can have a justified belief, but they cannot independently confirm if that belief corresponds to objective truth without stepping outside their own mind. This makes the \"Truth\" condition inaccessible to the person claiming to have knowledge.\n\nI will then write a Python script that uses `print()` statements to clearly articulate these two problems, numbering each one as requested.\n\n```python\ndef explain_jtb_problems():\n    \"\"\"\n    Explains two problems with the JTB definition of knowledge, ignoring Gettier problems.\n    The explanation is structured as a numbered list.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Ignoring Gettier problems, and assuming only Knowledge and Belief are available epistemic states, two major problems with the JTB definition of Knowledge are:\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Problem 1: The Regress Problem of Justification\n    print(\"1. The Regress Problem of Justification:\")\n    print(\"   The 'J' (Justification) in JTB is not clearly defined. If a belief must be justified to count as knowledge, what justifies the justification itself?\")\n    print(\"   This leads to a dilemma:\")\n    print(\"   a) An infinite regress, where each justification requires a further justification.\")\n    print(\"   b) A circular argument, where justifications eventually loop back on themselves.\")\n    print(\"   c) An arbitrary stopping point at a 'foundational belief' that is itself not justified, but merely accepted.\")\n    print(\"   The JTB model does not solve this regress problem, making the foundation of 'justification' unstable.\")\n    print(\"\\n\")\n\n    # Problem 2: The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition\n    print(\"2. The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition:\")\n    print(\"   The 'T' (True) in JTB requires that a belief must align with objective reality. However, a believer cannot step outside of their own perspective to verify this.\")\n    print(\"   From the subject's point of view, they only have access to their belief and their justification for it. They can never be absolutely certain that their belief is true in an objective sense.\")\n    print(\"   Therefore, the truth condition is an external requirement that the believer cannot directly access or confirm, making it problematic to use as a criterion for their own state of knowledge.\")\n\nexplain_jtb_problems()\n```\n<<<1. The Regress Problem of Justification, which questions how justifications are themselves supported. 2. The Inaccessibility of the Truth Condition, as a believer cannot independently verify if their belief is objectively true.>>>"
