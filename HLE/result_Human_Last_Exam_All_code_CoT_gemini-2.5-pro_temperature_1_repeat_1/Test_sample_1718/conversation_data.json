    "Of course. I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the number of independent entries for the Riemann tensor on a Kähler manifold and the corresponding Python code.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Manifold Type:** The user has specified a \"Kähler manifold\". This is a special type of Riemannian manifold that also has a complex structure.\n2.  **Recall Riemann Tensor Symmetries:** On a general `n`-dimensional Riemannian manifold, the Riemann tensor `R_ijkl` has `n^2(n^2-1)/12` independent components. However, the additional structure of a Kähler manifold imposes further symmetries.\n3.  **Incorporate Kähler Symmetries:** For a Kähler manifold of complex dimension `m` (and real dimension `n=2m`), the extra symmetries drastically reduce the number of independent components. The curvature is entirely determined by components of the form `R_{a\\bar{b}c\\bar{d}}`, where the indices run from 1 to `m`.\n4.  **Derive the Formula:** These components have symmetries that allow them to be identified with a Hermitian form on the space of symmetric `m x m` matrices. The dimension of this space of matrices is `N = m(m+1)/2`. The number of independent real components of such a Hermitian form is `N^2`.\n5.  **Final Formula:** The number of independent components is `(m * (m + 1) / 2)^2`.\n6.  **Create Python Code:** I will write a Python script that implements this formula. The script will take the complex dimension `m` as input and print a step-by-step calculation of the result. To be helpful, the code will calculate the number for a few common dimensions.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef count_riemann_kahler_components(m: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of independent components of the Riemann tensor\n    on a Kähler manifold of a given complex dimension 'm'.\n\n    Args:\n        m: The complex dimension of the Kähler manifold (must be a positive integer).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(m, int) or m <= 0:\n        print(f\"Error: Complex dimension 'm' must be a positive integer.
