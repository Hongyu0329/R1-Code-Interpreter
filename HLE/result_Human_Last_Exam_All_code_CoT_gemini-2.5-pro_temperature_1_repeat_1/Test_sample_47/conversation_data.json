    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Problem**: This is a classic probability problem about the expected waiting time for a specific sequence (a pattern) to appear in a series of random trials.\n2.  **Select the Right Formula**: I will use a well-known formula for this type of problem, which calculates the expected time based on the \"overlaps\" within the target sequence itself. The formula is:\n    `Expected Time (E) = Î£ (A^k)` for all `k` from 1 to `L` where the prefix of the sequence of length `k` is identical to its suffix of length `k`.\n    *   `A` is the size of the alphabet (26 for English letters).\n    *   `L` is the length of the target sequence.\n    *   `S` is the target sequence (\"TENETENET\").\n3.  **Analyze the Sequence**: I will systematically check the sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` for all possible lengths `k` (from 1 to 9) to find where its prefixes match its suffixes.\n4.  **Calculate the Terms**: For each matching length `k` found in the previous step, I will calculate the corresponding term `A^k` (i.e., `26^k`).\n5.  **Sum the Results**: The final expected time is the sum of all the terms calculated in step 4.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script to perform these steps automatically. The script will identify the overlaps, construct the equation, calculate each term, and print the final sum, clearly showing how the result was obtained, as requested.\n\nNow, here is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve_expected_time():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the expected number of random English letters drawn\n    until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
