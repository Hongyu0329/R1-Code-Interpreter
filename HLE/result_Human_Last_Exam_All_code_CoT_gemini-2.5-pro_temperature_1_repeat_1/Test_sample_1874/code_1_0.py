    # The problem asks for the second smallest cardinal delta for a tower
    # <x_alpha : alpha < delta> of omega_2-sized subsets of omega_2 such that:
    # 1. alpha < beta < delta => |x_beta \setminus x_alpha| < omega_2
    # 2. There is no omega_2-sized y subset of omega_2 such that for all alpha,
    #    |y \setminus x_alpha| < omega_2.
    #
    # This structure is a maximal increasing tower in a specific partial order.
    # Let kappa = omega_2. The relation is ApreceqB iff |B\A| < kappa.
    #
    # Let's consider the complements x'_alpha = omega_2 \setminus x_alpha.
    # The condition |x_beta \setminus x_alpha| < omega_2 is equivalent to
    # |x'_alpha \setminus x'_beta| < omega_2. This means x'_alpha is "almost a subset"
    # of x'_beta (denoted x'_alpha subseteq^* x'_beta).
    #
    # The maximality condition on the x_alpha tower translates to the statement
    # that the tower of complements <x'_alpha> is a maximal subseteq^*-increasing tower.
    #
    # The minimal length of such a tower is the cardinal characteristic h(aleph_2).
    # The possible lengths delta must be regular cardinals such that delta >= h(aleph_2).
    #
    # A theorem by Shelah states that t(aleph_2) > aleph_2.
    # Since it is known that h(aleph_2) >= t(aleph_2), we have h(aleph_2) > aleph_2.
    #
    # The smallest cardinal greater than aleph_2 is aleph_3. So, h(aleph_2) >= aleph_3.
    # Thus, any possible length delta must be a regular cardinal delta >= aleph_3.
    #
    # The set of possible values for delta, considering all models of ZFC, is the
    # set of all regular cardinals greater than or equal to aleph_3.
    #
    # The smallest possible value for delta is aleph_3.
    # The second smallest possible value for delta is the next regular cardinal,
    # which is aleph_4.

    # The cardinal is aleph_4. The question asks to output the number.
    # The final equation could be considered delta = aleph_4.
    # The number in this equation is 4.
