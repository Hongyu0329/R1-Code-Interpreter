    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Understand Duality**: The core of the problem is the principle of duality in linear systems. It states that finding the observer canonical form for a system `(A, C)` is equivalent to finding the controller canonical form for its dual system, `(A_d, B_d)`, where `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`. The resulting canonical matrices are related by `A_o = A_c^T` and `C_o = B_c^T`.\n\n2.  **Determine System Indices**: The structure of any canonical form is determined by a set of integers called indices. For the observer canonical form, these are the *observability indices* `(v_1, v_2, ..., v_p)`. By duality, these are identical to the *controllability indices* `(μ_1, μ_2, ..., μ_p)` of the dual system.\n\n3.  **Calculate Controllability Indices**: To find the controllability indices of the dual system `(A^T, C^T)`, we will:\n    a. Define the dual system matrices `A_d = A^T` and `B_d = C^T`. Let the columns of `B_d` be `b_1` and `b_2`.\n    b. Construct the controllability matrix `W_c = [b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, A_d*b_2, ...]`.\n    c. Find the first `n=3` linearly independent columns by searching through `W_c` in the standard order (`b_1, b_2, A_d*b_1, ...`).\n    d. The number of vectors selected that are associated with each input gives the controllability indices `μ_1` and `μ_2`.\n\n4.  **Construct the New C Matrix (`C_o`)**: Once the observability indices `(v_1, v_2)` are known (since `v_1=μ_1`, `v_2=μ_2`), the observer canonical matrix `C_o` has a fixed, sparse structure:\n    *   The first row of `C_o` will have a `1` at column `v_1` and zeros elsewhere.\n    *   The second row of `C_o` will have a `1` at column `v_1 + v_2` and zeros elsewhere.\n\n5.  **Final Output**: The Python script will perform these calculations and then print the resulting `C_o` matrix, showing the numbers in the final output equation `y_o(k) = C_o * x_o(k)`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Step 1: Define the original system matrices\nA = np.array([[1, 1, 0], \n              [2, 1, 1], \n              [0, 2, 0]])\n\nC = np.array([[0, 1, 0], \n              [1, 1, 0]])\n\nprint(\"Original System Matrices:\")\nprint(\"A =\\n\", A)\nprint(\"C =\\n\", C)\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Define the dual system using duality principle\n# A_d = A^T, B_d = C^T\nA_d = A.T\nB_d = C.T\n\nprint(\"Dual System Matrices:\")\nprint(\"A_d = A^T =\\n\", A_d)\nprint(\"B_d = C^T =\\n\", B_d)\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: Determine the controllability indices (mu_1, mu_2) of the dual system.\n# These will be equal to the observability indices (v_1, v_2) of the original system.\nn = A.shape[0]  # Dimension of the system (n=3)\np = C.shape[0]  # Number of outputs (p=2)\n\n# Get the columns of B_d\nb1 = B_d[:, 0].reshape(n, 1)\nb2 = B_d[:, 1].reshape(n, 1)\n\n# Calculate terms for the controllability matrix W_c = [b1, b2, A_d*b1, A_d*b2, ...]\nAd_b1 = A_d @ b1\n\n# Check for linear independence by forming a matrix and checking its rank/determinant\n# We search in the order b1, b2, Ad_b1, ...\n# Vector 1: b1\n# Vector 2: b2.
