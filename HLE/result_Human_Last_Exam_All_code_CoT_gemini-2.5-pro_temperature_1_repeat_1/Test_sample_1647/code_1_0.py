# Plan:
# 1. Define physical constants and problem inputs.
# 2. Calculate the Schwarzschild radius (Rs) of the black hole Pegasi using Pandora's orbital data.
#    The formula used is derived from Kepler's Third Law and the definition of Rs:
#    Rs = (8 * pi^2 * R^3) / (T^2 * c^2)
# 3. Calculate the gravitational time dilation factor (f) for the Pioneer probe.
#    The formula is f = sqrt(1 + Rs / d), where d is the distance from the event horizon.
# 4. Determine the memory usage (z) in trits for the most memory-efficient Bagua C program.
#    This involves identifying the minimum number of variables needed to perform the calculation
#    under the Bagua architecture's constraints (frac type, limited integer conversion).
# 5. Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final answer in the format f:z.

# Step 1: Define constants and inputs
PI = math.pi
C = 299792458  # Speed of light in m/s

# Pandora's orbital data
T_days = 800  # Orbital period in Earth days
R_km = 100000000  # Orbital radius in km

# Pioneer's distance from event horizon
d_km = 13  # in km

# Convert inputs to SI units
T_s = T_days * 24 * 60 * 60  # Period in seconds
R_m = R_km * 1000  # Radius in meters
d_m = d_km * 1000  # Distance in meters

# Step 2: Calculate Schwarzschild radius (Rs)
Rs_numerator = 8 * (PI**2) * (R_m**3)
Rs_denominator = (T_s**2) * (C**2)
Rs = Rs_numerator / Rs_denominator

# Step 3: Calculate time dilation factor (f)
# The final equation is f = sqrt(1 + Rs / d)
f_value = math.sqrt(1 + Rs / d_m)
f_rounded = round(f_value, 3)

# Step 4: Determine memory usage (z)
# A memory-efficient C program for Bagua would need to store the key inputs and the result.
# Literals and constants can be compiled directly into the machine code.
# However, complex values derived from inputs must be stored in variables.
# Minimal required variables for the calculation:
# 1. `frac R`: To store the orbital radius (e.g., as 1e11). (8 trits)
# 2. `frac d`: To store Pioneer's distance (e.g., as 13e3). (8 trits)
# 3. `frac T_val`: To store the orbital period in seconds, computed from its components. (8 trits)
# 4. `frac f`: To be used as an accumulator for the calculation and to hold the final result. (8 trits)
#
# Total variables = 4
# Size of each variable (int or frac) = 8 trits
z_trits = 4 * 8

# Step 5: Print the results
