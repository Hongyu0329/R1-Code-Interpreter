    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle. Let's break it down to find the answer.\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\"**: This refers to the character 木 (mù), which means \"wood\" or \"tree\".\n2.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: This describes putting the \"wooden stick\" (木) inside a \"square box\", which is represented by the radical 囗 (wéi).\n3.  **\"a ladder placed in the center\"**: The character 木 has a central vertical stroke that resembles a ladder.\n\nWhen you put the character for wood (木) inside the character for a box (囗), you get the Chinese character 困 (kùn).\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the Chinese character riddle by printing the components and the final character.\n    \"\"\"\n    wooden_stick = \"木\"\n    square_box_with_stick_inside = \"困\"\n    \n    print(\"The riddle describes the parts of a Chinese character:\")\n    print(f\"1. 'A wooden stick' refers to the character for wood: {wooden_stick}\")\n    print(f\"2. Placing the 'wooden stick' inside a 'square box' with its central 'ladder' gives us the character: {square_box_with_stick_inside}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe character is 困 (kùn), which means 'trapped' or 'difficult'.\")\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<困>>>"
