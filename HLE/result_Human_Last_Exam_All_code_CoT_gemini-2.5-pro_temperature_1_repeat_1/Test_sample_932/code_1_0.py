def find_unlikely_tribes():
    """
    Identifies insect tribes whose immatures are unlikely to be collected
    using a beat-sheet method based on their life history.

    The beat-sheet method collects insects from plant foliage. Therefore, tribes
    whose immatures live inside plants, underground, in hives, or in other
    concealed microhabitats are unlikely to be collected.

    - 1 (Apis): Immatures are in a hive. Unlikely.
    - 3 (Eupholini): Immatures are internal borers or root feeders. Unlikely.
    - 4 (Acritini): Immatures live in dung, carrion, or under bark. Unlikely.
    - 5 (Oxyptilini): Immatures are often internal stem/flower borers. Unlikely.
    - 7 (Acanthocerini): Immatures live in decaying wood or humus. Unlikely.
