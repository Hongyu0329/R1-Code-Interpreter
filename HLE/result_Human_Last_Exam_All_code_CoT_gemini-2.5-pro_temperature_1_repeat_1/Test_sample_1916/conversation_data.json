    "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unique structures of a category with one object and three morphisms exist, considering that two categories are the same if they are isomorphic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the structure:** A category with one object is equivalent to a mathematical structure called a **monoid**. A monoid is a set of elements equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element.\n    *   **Object:** We have one object, let's call it `X`.\n    *   **Morphisms:** We have three morphisms, let's call them `m1`, `m2`, `m3`. Since there's only one object, all morphisms must be from `X` to `X` (endomorphisms).\n    *   **Identity Morphism:** One of these three morphisms must be the identity morphism, `id_X`. Let's say `m1 = id_X`. The other two non-identity morphisms are `f` and `g`. So, our set of morphisms is `M = {id, f, g}`.\n    *   **Composition:** The composition of any two morphisms in `M` must also be a morphism in `M`. For example, `f . g` must be either `id`, `f`, or `g`.\n    *   **Associativity:** The composition operation must be associative, i.e., `(a . b) . c = a . (b . c)` for any morphisms `a, b, c` in `M`.\n\n2.  **Systematic Enumeration:** We can represent the morphisms as numbers: `id = 0`, `f = 1`, `g = 2`. The composition operation can be described by a 3x3 multiplication table.\n    *   The identity element `0` has a fixed behavior: `0 . x = x` and `x . 0 = x` for any `x`.\n    *   We only need to define the compositions for the non-identity elements `1` and `2`. There are four such compositions to define: `1.1`, `1.2`, `2.1`, `2.2`. Each of these can be `0`, `1`, or `2`. This gives `3^4 = 81` possible composition tables.\n\n3.  **Filtering and Classification:**\n    *   **Check Associativity:** We will iterate through all 81 possible tables and keep only those that are associative. This will give us all possible monoids of order 3.\n    *   **Check for Isomorphism:** Two categories (monoids) are isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by relabeling the non-identity morphisms. In our case, this means swapping the roles of `f` and `g` (i.e., `1` and `2`). For each valid monoid, we'll generate a \"canonical form\" that represents its entire isomorphism class.\n    *   **Count Unique Classes:** The number of unique canonical forms is the final answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan. It will:\n1.  Generate all 81 possible composition tables.\n2.  Identify the 12 tables that are associative (the monoids).\n3.  Group these 12 monoids into isomorphism classes.\n4.  Print the final count of unique classes, which is the answer to the problem.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef is_associative(table):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a 3x3 multiplication table is associative.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            for k in range(3):\n                # Check if (i . j) . k == i .
