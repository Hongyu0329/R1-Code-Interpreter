    "To determine which ballet step has the same ending and starting position, we need to analyze the mechanics of each movement. A step that lands in the exact same position it started from, including which foot is in front, is what we are looking for.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Define \"Same Position\":** For this problem, \"same position\" means not only the same type of position (e.g., fifth position) but also with the same foot in front.\n2.  **Analyze Each Step:**\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:** An `entrechat` is a jump where the legs beat against each other in the air. An even-numbered `entrechat` (like six) starts from fifth position and lands back in the *exact same* fifth position, with the same foot in front.\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:** An `échappé` moves from a closed position (like fifth) to an open one (second) and back to a closed one. The word `changé` explicitly means \"changed,\" so the dancer lands in fifth position but with the opposite foot in front.\n    *   **C. Assemblé:** This step means \"to assemble.\" It typically starts with the weight on one foot and the other leg extended. The dancer jumps, bringing the legs together in the air and landing on both feet in fifth position. The starting position (on one foot) is different from the ending position (on two feet).\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:** This is a gliding, traveling step. It starts in fifth, moves to the side, and closes back in fifth. However, the feet change places. If you start with the right foot front, you will end with the left foot front.\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:** This is a jump similar to a `pas de chat` but with a circular movement (`rond de jambe`) of each leg. It involves jumping from one foot and landing on the other, so the start and end positions are different.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, only `Entrechat six` ends in the exact same configuration as it started.\n\nHere is a Python script that models this logic to find the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_ballet_step():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one has the same\n    starting and ending position.\n\n    The \"same position\" is defined as both the same position type (e.g., fifth)\n    and the same configuration of the feet (i.e., the same foot is in front).\n    \"\"\"\n    ballet_steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'start_position_type': 'fifth',\n            'end_position_type': 'fifth',\n            'feet_change': False,\n            'explanation': 'Starts in fifth and lands in the exact same fifth position.
