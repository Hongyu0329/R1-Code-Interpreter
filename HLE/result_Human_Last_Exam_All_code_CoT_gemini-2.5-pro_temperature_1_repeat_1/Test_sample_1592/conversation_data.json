    "I will determine the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec by calculating the geographical distance from Waskaganish to the nearest points of its neighboring provinces and territories.\n\n1.  **Identify Coordinates**: First, I'll find the latitude and longitude of Waskaganish.\n2.  **Identify Neighbors**: The provinces and territories bordering Quebec are Ontario, Nunavut, Newfoundland and Labrador, and New Brunswick.\n3.  **Find Closest Points**: For each neighbor, I'll identify the coordinates of the point on its border that is closest to Waskaganish.\n    *   For **Ontario**, the border is a line of longitude just west of Waskaganish.\n    *   For **Nunavut**, the closest point is on Akimiski Island in James Bay.\n    *   For **Newfoundland and Labrador** and **New Brunswick**, the closest points are on their land borders with Quebec, which are much farther away.\n4.  **Calculate Distances**: I will use Python's `geopy` library to calculate the great-circle distance between Waskaganish and each of these border points.\n5.  **Compare and Conclude**: By comparing the calculated distances, I will find the minimum distance and thus identify the closest province or territory.\n\n```python\nimport geopy.distance\n\ndef find_closest_province():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the closest province or territory to Waskaganish, Quebec.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Coordinates for Waskaganish, Quebec, located on Rupert Bay, a part of James Bay.\n    waskaganish_coords = (51.483, -78.761)\n\n    # Define coordinates for the closest points of neighboring provinces/territories\n    # 1.
