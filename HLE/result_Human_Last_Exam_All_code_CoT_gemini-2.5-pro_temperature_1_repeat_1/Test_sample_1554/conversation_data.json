    "Of course, I can help with that.\n\nThe user is asking a factual question about philosophy and wants the answer presented in a Python script.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  I will first identify the philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for their work on the theory of signs, which includes concepts similar to symptoms and signals.\n2.  The philosopher is Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz. He made significant contributions to semiotics and the philosophy of language, distinguishing between different types of signs.\n3.  I will write a Python script that stores this philosopher's name in a variable.\n4.  The script will then use a `print()` function to output the answer in a clear sentence.\n\nHere is the Python code to provide the answer:\n```python\ndef find_philosopher():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the name of the Lviv-Warsaw School\n    philosopher associated with the decomposition of signs into concepts\n    like symptoms and signals.\n    \"\"\"\n    philosopher_name = \"Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz\"\n    \n    print(f\"The philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School who is known for work on the theory of signs, including the distinction between natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals), is: {philosopher_name}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_philosopher()\n```\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
