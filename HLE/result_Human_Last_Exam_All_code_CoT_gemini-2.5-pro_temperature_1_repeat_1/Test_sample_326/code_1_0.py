# Define the required minimum dimension (length) of the intersection.
L = 0.5

# The minimal possible area 'A' of a compact set C with the given property
# is known from geometric measure theory to be A = L^2 / 2.
numerator = L**2
denominator = 2
minimal_area = numerator / denominator

# Print the final equation with all the numbers and the result.
# The problem asks for the dimension of C, which corresponds to its area.
