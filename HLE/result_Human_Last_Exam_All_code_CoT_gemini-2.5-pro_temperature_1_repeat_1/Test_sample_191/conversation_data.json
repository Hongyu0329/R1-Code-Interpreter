    "My plan is to answer your question by identifying the specific protein involved in the immune response to amyloid plaques. This process involves a part of the innate immune system called the complement system.\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Process:** The question describes a process where a protein is broken down to help macrophages (a type of immune cell) consume amyloid deposits. This \"tagging\" of a substance for removal by phagocytic cells is a classic immune function called opsonization.\n2.  **Pinpoint the System:** The primary system responsible for this type of opsonization is the complement system.\n3.  **Identify the Key Protein:** Within the complement system, the central protein that is cleaved (broken down) to tag targets is **Complement component 3 (C3)**.\n4.  **Describe the Mechanism:** When the complement cascade is activated by amyloid, C3 is cleaved into fragments C3a and C3b. The C3b fragment physically binds to the amyloid plaque.\n5.  **Explain the Result:** Macrophages have receptors on their surface that recognize and bind to C3b. This binding event triggers the macrophage to engulf and destroy the C3b-tagged amyloid plaque.\n6.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a Python script that prints this information clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and identifies the protein that, when broken down,\n    facilitates the macrophage engulfment of amyloid plaques.\n    \"\"\"\n    protein_name = \"Complement component 3 (C3)\"\n\n    # Print the answer and explanation\n    print(f\"The protein that, when broken down (cleaved), allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid is: {protein_name}\")\n    print(\"\\n--- The Process Explained ---\")\n    print(\"1. The process involves the immune system's 'complement cascade'.\")\n    print(\"2. When this system is activated by amyloid, the protein C3 is 'broken down' by an enzyme into two fragments: C3a and C3b.\")\n    print(\"3. The C3b fragment then binds directly to the amyloid plaque, acting as a tag or a flag.\")\n    print(\"4. Macrophages have receptors that recognize this C3b tag.\")\n    print(\"5. This recognition triggers the macrophage to engulf and clear the tagged amyloid plaque.\")\n\n# Execute the function to provide the answer\nfind_protein_for_amyloid_engulfment()\n```\n<<<Complement component 3 (C3)>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    What protein when broken down allows for macrophage engulfment of amyloid?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
