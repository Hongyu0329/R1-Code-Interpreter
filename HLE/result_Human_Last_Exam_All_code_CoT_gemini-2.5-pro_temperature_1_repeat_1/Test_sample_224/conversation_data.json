    "To find the largest prime number that is a nine-digit palindrome in base 17, we need to follow a systematic approach.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the Number Structure**: A nine-digit palindrome in base 17 can be represented by five independent digits: `d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d5 d6 d7 d8`. The digits `d_i` range from 0 to 16. For a nine-digit number, the most significant digit `d8` cannot be zero. The value of this number in base 10 is `N = d8*(17^8 + 1) + d7*(17^7 + 17^1) + d6*(17^6 + 17^2) + d5*(17^5 + 17^3) + d4*17^4`.\n\n2.  **Search Strategy**: To find the *largest* such prime, we should start with the largest possible palindrome and search downwards. This means starting with the largest possible values for the digits, from most significant to least significant (`d8`, then `d7`, `d6`, etc.).\n\n3.  **Primality Testing**: The numbers involved are very large (up to ~1.18 x 10ยนยน), so a simple trial division primality test would be too slow. A more efficient method, the Miller-Rabin primality test, is suitable. For numbers of this magnitude, it can be made deterministic by testing against a specific set of bases.\n\n4.  **Optimization**: Before running the expensive primality test, we can quickly eliminate many composite candidates using divisibility rules.\n    *   **Divisibility by 2**: For `N` to be prime (and not 2), it must be odd. The parity of `N` depends only on the central digit `d4`. `N` is odd if and only if `d4` is odd. So, we only need to check odd values for `d4`.\n    *   **Divisibility by 3, 5, etc.**: We can derive rules for divisibility by other small primes based on the base-17 digits to further prune the search space.\n\n5.  **Implementation**: The plan will be implemented in a Python script.\n    *   A function `is_prime()` will perform the Miller-Rabin test.\n    *   The main part of the script will contain nested loops to iterate through digits `d8` down to `d4`.\n    *   Inside the loops, we will apply the divisibility checks.\n    *   If a number is a likely candidate, we construct it and test for primality.\n    *   The first prime number found will be the largest one. The script will then print the result in the required format and terminate.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to find the number.\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Miller-Rabin primality test.
