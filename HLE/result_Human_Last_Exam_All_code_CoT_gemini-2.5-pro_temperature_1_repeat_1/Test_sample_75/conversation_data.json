    "Of course. Here is the plan to determine the duration of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore:\n1.  Establish the start and end years of the war based on the lore. The Second Great War began in 2504 with the events of *Wings of Liberty* and concluded in 2508 at the end of *Legacy of the Void*.\n2.  Calculate the difference between the end year and the start year to find the duration.\n3.  Round the result up to the nearest whole number as requested.\n4.  Present the calculation and the final answer in a Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# According to StarCraft lore, the Second Great War started in the year 2504\n# and concluded in the year 2508.\nstart_year = 2504\nend_year = 2508\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round the duration up to the nearest whole number\nrounded_up_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\nprint(f\"The Second Great War started in {start_year} and ended in {end_year}.\")\nprint(f\"Calculation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The duration of the war in years, rounded up, is: {rounded_up_duration}\")\n```\n<<<4>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
