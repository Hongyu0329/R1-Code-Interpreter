    "My plan to solve this task is as follows:\n\n1.  **Theoretical Framework:** I will start by explaining the connection between the problem and the large deviation theorems mentioned. The core idea is that the equilibrium state of a system is its most probable macroscopic state. According to Boltzmann's principle, this corresponds to the state with the maximum entropy. This principle is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics and can be formally described using large deviation theory (like Boltzmann-Sanov). The equilibrium distribution we find (Bose-Einstein) is the one that minimizes the \"large deviation\" from the most probable state, subject to physical constraints like fixed total energy.\n\n2.  **System Specification (Photon Gas):** I will define the physical system: a gas of photons (light quanta) obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. A key feature is that the number of photons is not conserved, which sets their chemical potential to zero.\n\n3.  **Key Ingredients for Calculation:** To calculate macroscopic properties like energy and entropy, we need two ingredients:\n    *   The **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of photons `<n(e)>` in an energy state `e`.\n    *   The **density of states** `g(e)`, which tells us how many available energy states there are per unit energy interval for photons in a 3D volume.\n\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation in Python:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform the symbolic calculations. This avoids numerical approximations and provides exact analytical formulas.\n    *   **Mean Energy (E):** I will set up the integral for the total energy `E = âˆ« e * <n(e)> * g(e) de`. The code will define all the terms symbolically and evaluate this integral. The result is the famous Stefan-Boltzmann law for black-body radiation.\n    *   **Entropy (S):** Instead of calculating the entropy from its complex statistical definition, I will use a fundamental thermodynamic relation for photons: `S = (4/3) * E / T`. This relation is a direct consequence of the nature of the photon gas and provides a straightforward way to find the entropy once the energy is known.\n\n5.  **Final Output:** The script will print the derived formulas for the equilibrium mean energy `E` and entropy `S` in a clear, readable format, showing their dependence on fundamental constants, temperature `T`, and volume `V`.\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\ndef solve_photon_gas_equilibrium():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy\n    for a Bose gas of light quanta (photons) using symbolic mathematics.\n    \n    The method is based on statistical mechanics, whose principle of maximizing\n    entropy is justified by large deviation theorems (Boltzmann-Sanov).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Step 1: Define all symbolic variables ---\n    # We treat physical constants and system parameters as symbols to get an exact formula.\n    E, S = sp.symbols('E S', real=True)  # Target variables: Mean Energy, Entropy\n    e, T, V = sp.symbols('e T V', positive=True, real=True) # State variables: energy level, Temperature, Volume\n    k_B = sp.Symbol('k_B', positive=True, real=True, constant=True) # Boltzmann constant\n    h_bar = sp.Symbol('hbar', positive=True, real=True, constant=True) # Reduced Planck constant\n    c = sp.Symbol('c', positive=True, real=True, constant=True) # Speed of light\n\n    print(\"Deriving equilibrium values for a photon gas...\")\n    print(\"The calculation uses the Bose-Einstein distribution for photons and the density of states in 3D.\")\n    \n    # --- Step 2: Define the distribution and density of states ---\n    \n    # The Bose-Einstein distribution for the average occupation number <n(e)> of a state with energy 'e'.\n    # For photons, the chemical potential is zero as their number is not conserved.\n    # beta = 1 / (k_B * T)\n    n_e = 1 / (sp.exp(e / (k_B * T)) - 1)\n\n    # The density of states g(e) for photons (spin-1, two polarization states) in a 3D volume V.\n    g_e = (V / (sp.pi**2 * h_bar**3 * c**3)) * e**2\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the Equilibrium Mean Energy (E) ---\n    # The total energy E is the integral of (energy per state) * (occupation number) * (density of states)\n    # over all possible energies.\n    # E = Integral[e * n(e) * g(e) de] from 0 to infinity.\n    \n    integrand_E = e * n_e * g_e\n    \n    # To solve this integral, we perform a change of variables: x = e / (k_B * T)\n    # This transforms the integral into a standard form known as the Bose-Einstein integral.\n    x = sp.symbols('x', positive=True)\n    \n    # The integral part is of the form Integral[x^3 / (exp(x) - 1) dx] from 0 to oo.\n    # This is related to the Riemann zeta function, zeta(4), and the Gamma function, Gamma(4).\n    # The value of the integral is Gamma(4) * zeta(4) = 6 * (pi^4 / 90) = pi^4 / 15.\n    integral_value = sp.integrate(x**3 / (sp.exp(x) - 1), (x, 0, sp.oo))\n\n    # The full expression for energy is the coefficient part multiplied by this integral value.\n    # Coefficient = (V / (pi^2 * h_bar^3 * c^3)) * (k_B * T)^4\n    energy_coefficient = (V / (sp.pi**2 * h_bar**3 * c**3)) * (k_B * T)**4\n    \n    mean_energy_expr = energy_coefficient * integral_value\n    \n    # --- Step 4: Calculate the Equilibrium Entropy (S) ---\n    # For a photon gas, there is a simple thermodynamic relation between energy and entropy:\n    # Pressure P = E / (3V), and Helmholtz Free Energy F = E - TS = -PV.\n    # This leads to E - TS = -E/3, which simplifies to TS = (4/3)E or S = (4/3) * E / T.\n    \n    entropy_expr = sp.simplify((4 * mean_energy_expr) / (3 * T))\n\n    # --- Step 5: Print the final results ---\n    \n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (E) ---\")\n    print(\"This is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation in a cavity of volume V.\")\n    # The sp.pretty() function provides a nicely formatted text output for the equation.\n    final_E_eq = sp.Eq(E, mean_energy_expr)\n    print(\"The equation for the mean energy E is:\")\n    print(sp.pretty(final_E_eq, use_unicode=True))\n\n\n    print(\"\\n--- Equilibrium Entropy (S) ---\")\n    print(\"The entropy is derived from the energy using the thermodynamic relation S = (4/3)E/T.\")\n    final_S_eq = sp.Eq(S, entropy_expr)\n    print(\"The equation for the entropy S is:\")\n    print(sp.pretty(final_S_eq, use_unicode=True))\n\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_photon_gas_equilibrium()\nfinal_energy_expression = \"(pi**2 * k_B**4 * T**4 * V) / (15 * hbar**3 * c**3)\"\nfinal_entropy_expression = \"(4 * pi**2 * k_B**4 * T**3 * V) / (45 * hbar**3 * c**3)\"\n<<<f\"Energy: {final_energy_expression}, Entropy: {final_entropy_expression}\">>>\n```"
