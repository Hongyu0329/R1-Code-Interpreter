    "Of course. Here is the plan to find the number of historical saints mentioned in Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the text of *Paradise Lost* to identify any direct mentions or clear allusions to specific historical (post-biblical) saints. Milton, as a Puritan, was often critical of the Catholic veneration of saints, so any mentions are likely to be in a critical context.\n\nMy research points to a specific passage in Book III, where Milton describes the \"Limbo of Vanity.\" In this section, he explicitly names or refers to the founders of two major Catholic orders:\n\n1.  **St. Dominic**: Mentioned by name (\"weeds of DOMINIC\").\n2.  **St. Francis of Assisi**: Alluded to through his followers (\"in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd\").\n\nOther figures mentioned in the poem are either biblical (like Abraham, Moses, or the Apostles) or mythological/angelic, not historical figures canonized by the church in the post-biblical era. Therefore, the count is two.\n\nThe following Python script will list these saints and print the final count as an equation.\n\n```python\ndef count_saints_in_paradise_lost():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies and counts the historical saints mentioned by name\n    or clear allusion in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\".\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Based on analysis of the text, particularly Book III, lines 473-477,\n    # two historical saints are mentioned in a critique of monastic orders.\n    saints = {\n        \"St. Dominic\": \"Mentioned by name: '...weeds of DOMINIC...'\",\n        \"St. Francis\": \"Referenced by his order: '...in Franciscan think to pass disguis'd...'\"\n    }\n    \n    saint_names = list(saints.keys())\n    count = len(saint_names)\n    \n    print(\"The historical saints mentioned in Milton's Paradise Lost are:\")\n    for name, reference in saints.items():\n        print(f\"- {name} ({reference})\")\n        \n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    \n    # To fulfill the request of showing the equation, we list the names.\n    # We extract the core name (e.g., \"Dominic\" from \"St. Dominic\").\n    equation_parts = [name.split(' ')[1] for name in saint_names]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n    \n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {count}\")\n\ncount_saints_in_paradise_lost()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
