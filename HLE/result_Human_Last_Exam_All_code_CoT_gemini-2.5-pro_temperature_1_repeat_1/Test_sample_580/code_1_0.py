    This function determines the correct physical exam maneuver based on the clinical vignette.

    The patient's symptoms (L4-S1 radicular pain) are classic for sciatica.
    The standard provocative test for sciatica is the Straight Leg Raise (SLR),
    which involves flexing the hip while the knee is kept extended.
    This maneuver can be performed in the lateral decubitus position, as described.
    Therefore, flexing the patient's extended right leg will tension the sciatic nerve
    and its roots, helping to confirm the diagnosis if it reproduces the pain.
