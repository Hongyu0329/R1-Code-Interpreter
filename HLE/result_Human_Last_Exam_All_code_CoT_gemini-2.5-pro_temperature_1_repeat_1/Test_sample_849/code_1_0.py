def solve_safe_goal():
    """
    This function determines the safe goal for the described machine learning model M.

    The model M faces an uncomputable problem: identifying the set I of predictors
    that are always correct. A "safe" goal cannot depend on solving this unprovable task.

    Instead, the model must rely on the information it can compute: the outcome of
    each prediction. This sequence of correct/incorrect predictions serves as feedback.

    A rational and safe goal is to learn the utility, or "value," of selecting
    each predictor based on the observed feedback. This process allows the model
    to adapt its strategy without needing to prove long-term success.

    - The learning process is best described as 'value learning'.
    - The source of this information is 'feedback'.
