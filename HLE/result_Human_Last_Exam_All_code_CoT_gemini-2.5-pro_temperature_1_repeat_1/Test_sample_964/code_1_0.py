    # The problem describes a series of chemical and physical processes.
    # We will trace the state of the barium compound through each step.

    # Initial reactants: Aqueous solutions of Barium Chloride (BaCl2) and Silver Nitrate (AgNO3).
    # Step 1: Mixing the solutions.
    # A double displacement reaction occurs:
    # BaCl2(aq) + 2AgNO3(aq) -> Ba(NO3)2(aq) + 2AgCl(s)
    # Barium Nitrate (Ba(NO3)2) is formed and remains dissolved in the water.
    # Silver Chloride (AgCl) is an insoluble precipitate.
    barium_salt = "Barium Nitrate"
    formula = "Ba(NO3)2"

    # Step 2: The mixture is freeze-dried.
    # This removes the water, leaving a solid mixture of Ba(NO3)2 and AgCl.
    # The barium salt is still Barium Nitrate.

    # Step 3: Ammonia is added.
    # Ammonia reacts with Silver Chloride to form the soluble diamminesilver(I) complex:
    # AgCl(s) + 2NH3(aq) -> [Ag(NH3)2]Cl(aq)
    # Barium Nitrate does not react with ammonia and remains as Ba(NO3)2 in the solution.
    # The barium salt is still Barium Nitrate.

    # Step 4: The ammonia is evaporated by freeze-drying.
    # The removal of volatile ammonia reverses the complex formation reaction,
    # causing the Silver Chloride (AgCl) to precipitate out of the solution again.
    # The non-volatile Barium Nitrate is left as a solid once the solvent is gone.
    # The barium salt remains Barium Nitrate.
