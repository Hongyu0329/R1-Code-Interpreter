    print("   This is a significant theorem in combinatorial set theory. A heuristic reason is that a diagonalization argument to construct an f with no solution fails, because there are 'more' potential functions g than there are pairs (alpha, beta) to constrain them.")

    print("   Consider any function g that is pointwise greater than or equal to g_0. This means for all alpha < kappa^+, g(alpha) >= g_0(alpha).")

    print("   Since kappa is an infinite cardinal and g_0(alpha) < kappa, the number of choices for each g(alpha) is |[g_0(alpha), kappa)| = kappa.")
    
    print("\n6. The total number of such functions is the product of the number of choices for each of the kappa^+ elements in the domain.")
    print("   In cardinal arithmetic, this is kappa * kappa * ... (kappa^+ times), which is equal to kappa^(kappa^+).")
    
    print("\n7. This shows that the number of solutions, X_f, is at least kappa^(kappa^+).")
    print("   The total number of functions from kappa^+ to kappa is also kappa^(kappa^+), which is an upper bound for X_f.")
    
    print("\n8. Therefore, for any function f, X_f must be exactly kappa^(kappa^+).")
    print("   Since X_f is the same for all f, the set of possible values for X_f is {kappa^(kappa^+)}.")
