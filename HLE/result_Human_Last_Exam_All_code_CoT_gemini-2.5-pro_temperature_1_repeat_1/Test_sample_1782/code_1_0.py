Step 1: Rephrasing the question in terms of Boolean Algebras.
The space P(omega_1)/<omega_1 is a complete Boolean algebra B. A 'maximal antichain' in this context
is a partition of unity. The question asks if one can always find a sequence of partitions of unity
L_alpha for alpha < omega_1, where L_{beta} refines L_{alpha} for alpha < beta, such that there is no
single partition that refines all L_alpha.

Step 2: The Distributivity Law.
The existence of such a tree is equivalent to the failure of the (omega_1, omega_1^+)-distributive
law in the Boolean algebra B. This law can be expressed by the following equation, where {L_alpha}
is a sequence of partitions for alpha < omega_1 and |L_alpha| <= omega_1:

  LHS:  Meet_{alpha < omega_1} (Join_{x in L_alpha} x)
  RHS:  Join_{f in Product(L_alpha)} (Meet_{alpha < omega_1} f(alpha))

The 'equation' is LHS = RHS.
- The term 'omega_1' represents the first uncountable cardinal.
- The 'LHS' is always 1 (the top element of the algebra) because each L_alpha is a partition.
- The 'RHS' being 1 is equivalent to the existence of a common refinement for all partitions L_alpha.
- The tree you described exists if and only if one can construct the sequence of partitions L_alpha
  such that the RHS is NOT equal to 1.

Step 3: Independence from ZFC.
Whether this distributivity law holds is independent of the standard axioms of set theory (ZFC).
- It is consistent with ZFC that the law fails. For example, assuming the Axiom of Constructibility (V=L),
  one can construct such a tree.
- It is also consistent with ZFC that the law holds. For example, Martin's Axiom for omega_1 (MA_{omega_1}),
  which is known to be consistent with ZFC, implies that this distributive law holds. In a model of
  ZFC + MA_{omega_1}, any such tree of partitions would necessarily have a common refinement.

Step 4: Conclusion.
The question is "Does there *always* exist...". This translates to "Is it a theorem of ZFC?".
Since there are consistent models of set theory (those satisfying MA_{omega_1}) where such a tree
*does not* exist, the answer to your question is no. It is not always the case.
