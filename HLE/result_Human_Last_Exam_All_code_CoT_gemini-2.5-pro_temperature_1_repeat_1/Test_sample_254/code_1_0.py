    print("A. Transitivity: This is a core, necessary assumption that allows indirect comparisons (e.g., A vs C via B). However, meeting it doesn't guarantee that heterogeneity is properly handled or that the statistical model is correct.")
    print("\nB. Consistency: This is the statistical agreement between direct and indirect evidence. It is a result of transitivity, not a root assumption you can make. Finding consistency is a good sign, but it is not sufficient on its own to validate the entire analysis.")
    print("\nC. Homogeneity: This assumes all studies within a specific comparison (e.g., all A vs B studies) measure the same true effect. While desirable, NMA can use random-effects models to handle heterogeneity. Therefore, homogeneity is not strictly necessary, and certainly not sufficient for overall validity.")
    print("\nD. Similarity of Effect Modifiers: This is the practical and clinical basis for the transitivity assumption. If patient characteristics differ across comparisons, transitivity is violated. While crucial, it is not sufficient by itself.")
    print("\nF. Exchangeability of treatment contrasts: This is a statistical assumption, particularly in Bayesian NMA, about the treatment effects being drawn from a common distribution. It's part of the model but doesn't cover the crucial clinical assumptions like transitivity.")

    print("The validity of an NMA depends on a chain of several interconnected assumptions being met. These include clinical, methodological, and statistical assumptions. The failure of any key assumption can invalidate the results. Therefore, no single option listed is sufficient by itself to ensure the validity of the entire analysis.")
