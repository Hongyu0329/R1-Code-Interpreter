    "To find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Define the Group:** The generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as $Q_{128}$, can be described by the presentation $Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$. The group has a maximal cyclic subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ of order 64.\n\n2.  **Define Power Subgroups:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup $H$ that can be expressed as $H = G^k = \\{g^k \\mid g \\in G\\}$ for some integer $k$. Our goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed this way.\n\n3.  **Analyze Power Subgroups based on k:** We analyze the set $G^k$ based on whether the integer power $k$ is odd or even.\n    *   **Case 1: k is odd.**\n        When $k$ is an odd number, the set of $k$-th powers of all elements in $Q_{128}$ turns out to be the entire group $Q_{128}$ itself. So, for any odd $k$, $G^k = Q_{128}$. This gives us one distinct power subgroup.\n    *   **Case 2: k is even.**\n        When $k$ is an even number, the set of $k$-th powers of all elements forms a cyclic subgroup of $\\langle x \\rangle$. Specifically, for any even $k$, the power subgroup is $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\n4.  **Count the Distinct Subgroups:**\n    *   From the odd $k$ case, we get **1** power subgroup ($Q_{128}$).\n    *   From the even $k$ case, we need to count the number of distinct subgroups of the form $\\langle x^k \\rangle$. A subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ is uniquely determined by $\\gcd(k, 64)$. Since $k$ must be even, $\\gcd(k, 64)$ must be an even divisor of 64.\n    *   We need to find all even divisors of 64. The divisors of 64 are {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}. The even divisors are {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64}. Each of these 6 divisors corresponds to a unique power subgroup.\n    *   So, from the even $k$ case, we get **6** distinct power subgroups.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total:** The total number of power subgroups is the sum of the counts from both cases.\n\nThe following Python code will perform the calculation described in step 4 to find the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_power_subgroups_q128():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group Q_128.\n    \"\"\"\n    # In Q_128, the maximal cyclic subgroup <x> has order 64.\n    cyclic_subgroup_order = 64\n\n    # 1. For any odd power k, the power subgroup is Q_128 itself.\n    # This gives one unique power subgroup.\n    num_from_odd_k = 1\n\n    # 2. For any even power k, the power subgroup is <x^k>, which is a cyclic subgroup\n    # of <x>. The number of such distinct subgroups is equal to the number of\n    # even divisors of the order of x, which is 64.\n\n    # Find all divisors of 64\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(cyclic_subgroup_order**0.5) + 1):\n        if cyclic_subgroup_order % i == 0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(cyclic_subgroup_order // i)\n    \n    # Filter for even divisors\n    even_divisors = sorted([d for d in divisors if d % 2 == 0])\n    num_from_even_k = len(even_divisors)\n\n    # The total number of power subgroups is the sum from the two cases.\n    total_power_subgroups = num_from_odd_k + num_from_even_k\n\n    print(\"The number of power subgroups is determined by analyzing two cases for the power k:\")\n    print(f\"1.
