    # Step 1: Explain the role of Interleukin-15 (IL-15)
    explanation_il15 = "Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a cytokine known to be crucial for the survival, proliferation, and functional potency of T cells. It promotes a less-differentiated, more persistent, and metabolically robust T cell state."

    # Step 2: Explain the function of CAR T cells
    explanation_car_t = "A primary effector function of CAR T cells is to recognize their target antigen on cancer cells. This recognition triggers a powerful response, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), which are critical for anti-tumor activity."

    # Step 3: Combine the principles to make a prediction
    prediction = "Prediction: Given that IL-15 enhances overall T cell fitness and function, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of IL-15 will be more functionally potent. Upon encountering their target antigen, these IL-15-conditioned CAR T cells would exhibit a more robust response."

    # Step 4: State the final conclusion about cytokine release
    conclusion = "Compared to T cells manufactured without IL-15, CAR T cells cultured with IL-15 would be expected to have an increased capacity for cytokine release upon stimulation."
