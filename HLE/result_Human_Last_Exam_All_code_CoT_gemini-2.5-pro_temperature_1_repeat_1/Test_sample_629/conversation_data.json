    "To solve this problem, we need to find all the minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot and then count how many unique diagrams exist after considering rotational symmetry.\n\n### Step-by-Step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand Minimal Grid Diagrams for the Trefoil Knot:** The minimal grid size for a trefoil knot is $3 \\times 3$. A $3 \\times 3$ grid diagram is defined by two permutations of three elements, one for the 'X' markers and one for the 'O' markers. We will use 0-indexed permutations of `{0, 1, 2}`.\n\n2.  **Identify Left-Hand Trefoil (LHT) Diagrams:** A grid diagram `(X, O)` represents a knot (specifically, a trefoil knot) if the composition `inv(X) * O` is a 3-cycle. There are two 3-cycles for permutations of 3 elements. By convention, one corresponds to the right-hand trefoil and the other to the left-hand trefoil.\n    *   Let's define the right-hand trefoil's characteristic permutation as `P_R = (1, 2, 0)`.\n    *   The left-hand trefoil's characteristic permutation is the inverse, `P_L = (2, 0, 1)`.\n    *   We will generate all $6 \\times 6 = 36$ possible grid diagrams and filter for those where `inv(X) * O == P_L`.\n\n3.  **Define Rotational Equivalence:** We need to group the LHT diagrams into equivalence classes under rotation. Two diagrams are equivalent if one can be rotated by 90, 180, or 270 degrees to become the other.\n\n4.  **Implement Rotation:** A rotation on the grid can be translated into an operation on the pair of permutations `(X, O)`. We'll implement functions that perform these rotations. A 90-degree clockwise rotation transforms a point at `(row, col)` to `(col, n-1-row)`. This gives us a formula to transform the permutations.\n\n5.  **Count the Orbits:** We'll iterate through our list of LHT diagrams. For each diagram, we'll find all other LHT diagrams that can be reached through rotation (its orbit). We'll count the number of such distinct orbits. This final count will be our answer.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_inverse(p):\n    \"\"\"Computes the inverse of a permutation.\"\"\"\n    inverse = [0] * len(p)\n    for i, val in enumerate(p):\n        inverse[val] = i\n    return tuple(inverse)\n\ndef perm_compose(p1, p2):\n    \"\"\"Computes the composition of two permutations (p1 o p2).\"\"\"\n    return tuple(p1[p2[i]] for i in range(len(p2)))\n\ndef rotate_90(d):\n    \"\"\"Applies a 90-degree clockwise rotation to a grid diagram.\"\"\"\n    X, O = d\n    n = len(X)\n    w0 = tuple(range(n - 1, -1, -1)) # Reversal permutation, e.g., (2,1,0)\n    \n    # Based on geometric transformation of coordinates (r,c) -> (c, n-1-r)\n    # This leads to X_new = w0 * inv(X) and O_new = w0 * inv(O)\n    X_inv = perm_inverse(X)\n    O_inv = perm_inverse(O)\n    \n    new_X = perm_compose(w0, X_inv)\n    new_O = perm_compose(w0, O_inv)\n    return (new_X, new_O)\n\ndef count_lht_grid_diagrams():\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil\n    knot up to rotation.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 3\n    # The characteristic permutation for a left-hand trefoil (1->3, 2->1, 3->2 or 0->2, 1->0, 2->1)\n    P_L = (2, 0, 1)\n\n    # 1.
