print("The data generating process for y involves squared normal distributions, which results in a skewed, positive-only response variable.

print("Model 3 specifies: log(lambda) = alpha[continent, country] + beta[continent, country] * x.")
print("This model correctly uses a Gamma distribution and correctly specifies the slope as varying by country-within-continent. Although it also models the intercept as varying at the country level (an over-parameterization), it is the model that best captures the key features of the data, especially the complex nested structure of the slope.")
