    "The user is asking to identify a specific Christian theologian based on their philosophical contributions.\n\n1.  **Analyze the query**: The key elements are:\n    *   Christian theologian.\n    *   *First* to develop *specialized terminology*.\n    *   The terminology describes *changes in the laws of nature*.\n    *   The framework is applicable to two specific events: the virgin birth of Jesus (a miracle that suspends biological law) and the Fall (a theological event that may have altered the state of nature itself).\n\n2.  **Identify potential candidates**:\n    *   **Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)**: A foundational figure in Western Christianity. He wrote extensively on creation, providence, and miracles. He developed the concept of *rationes seminales* (\"seminal reasons\" or \"causal seeds\").\n    *   **Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274 AD)**: A later, highly influential theologian who built on Augustine's work. He distinguished between God's \"ordained power\" (the regular laws of nature) and \"absolute power\" (what God *can* do, outside of that order).\n    *   **C.S. Lewis (1898-1963 AD)**: A modern writer who discussed miracles as supernatural interventions, but he was building on a long tradition rather than originating the core concepts.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the best fit**:\n    *   The question asks who was *first*. This points strongly to Augustine over Aquinas.\n    *   Augustine's concept of *rationes seminales* is a perfect fit for \"specialized terminology.\" He argued that God embedded the potential for all future things, including miracles, into creation at the beginning. An event like the virgin birth isn't God breaking a rule, but rather activating a pre-loaded potential that lies outside the *normal* course of nature. This framework can also explain a shift in nature's operation at the Fall, where different \"potentials\" (like decay and hardship) became dominant.\n\n4.  **Conclusion**: Augustine of Hippo is the correct answer. His theory of *rationes seminales* provides the specific intellectual framework described in the user's question.\n\n5.  **Plan the code**: I will create a Python script that stores the theologian's name and the key concept in variables. It will then use f-strings to construct and print a clear, explanatory text that answers the user's question. This fulfills the prompt's requirement to use code to provide the solution.\n\n```python\ndef solve_theology_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the theologian and concept in question and prints the explanation.\n    \"\"\"\n    theologian = \"Augustine of Hippo\"\n    key_concept = \"rationes seminales\"\n    \n    # Constructing the explanation\n    print(f\"The Christian theologian who first developed this line of thought was {theologian}.\")\n    print(\"\\nHe developed the specialized terminology of 'rationes seminales' (Latin for 'seminal reasons' or 'causal principles').\")\n    print(\"\\nHere's how the concept applies:\")\n    print(\"1. Augustine proposed that God embedded latent potentialities or 'seeds' for all future events into the fabric of creation from the beginning.\")\n    print(\"2. A miracle, like the virgin birth, is therefore not a violation of nature itself, but the activation of a hidden potential that lies outside of nature's ordinary, observable course.\")\n    print(\"3. This same framework can be used to describe alterations at the Fall, where the state of the natural world could have shifted due to the activation of different 'seminal reasons' for things like decay, toil, and death.\")\n\nsolve_theology_question()\n```\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
