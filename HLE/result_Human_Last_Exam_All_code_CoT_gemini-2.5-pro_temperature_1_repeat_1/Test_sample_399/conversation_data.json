    "To solve the initial value problem, we will first identify that it is a separable differential equation. Then, we will separate the variables, integrate both sides, and use the initial condition to find the constant of integration. Finally, we will use the resulting particular solution to find the value of x(1).\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Separate variables**: Rewrite the equation $\\frac{dx}{dt} = (t-1)x^2$ so that all terms involving $x$ are on one side with $dx$ and all terms involving $t$ are on the other side with $dt$. This gives $\\frac{1}{x^2}dx = (t-1)dt$.\n2.  **Integrate**: Integrate both sides of the separated equation. The integral of $\\frac{1}{x^2}$ is $-\\frac{1}{x}$, and the integral of $(t-1)$ is $\\frac{t^2}{2} - t$. This yields the general solution: $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + C$.\n3.  **Find C**: Use the initial condition $x(0) = -8$ to solve for the constant of integration, $C$. Substituting $t=0$ and $x=-8$ into the general solution gives $-\\frac{1}{-8} = \\frac{0^2}{2} - 0 + C$, which simplifies to $C = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n4.  **Find x(1)**: With the particular solution $-\\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{t^2}{2} - t + \\frac{1}{8}$, we can find $x(1)$ by substituting $t=1$. This gives $-\\frac{1}{x(1)} = \\frac{1^2}{2} - 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = -\\frac{3}{8}$. Solving for $x(1)$ gives $x(1) = \\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to provide the final answer. It uses the `fractions` module to ensure the calculations are exact.\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Define initial conditions and target time\n# x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t), with x(0) = -8\n# We want to find x(1).\nt0 = 0\nx0 = -8\nt1 = 1\n\n# Using the Fraction type for precision\nx0_f = Fraction(x0)\nt0_f = Fraction(t0)\nt1_f = Fraction(t1)\n\n# Step 2: The general solution from integrating the separated equation is:\n# -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\n\n# Step 3: Use the initial condition x(0) = -8 to find the constant C\n# -1/x(0) = 0^2/2 - 0 + C  => C = -1/x(0)\nC = -1 / x0_f\n\nprint(\"The general solution of the differential equation is of the form: -1/x = t^2/2 - t + C\")\nprint(f\"Using the initial condition x({t0}) = {x0}, we find the constant C:\")\nprint(f\"C = -1 / {x0} = {C}\")\nprint(f\"\\nThus, the particular solution is: -1/x = t^2/2 - t + {C}\")\n\n# Step 4: Substitute t=1 into the particular solution to find x(1)\n# -1/x(1) = 1^2/2 - 1 + C\nrhs_val = t1_f**2 / 2 - t1_f + C\nx1 = -1 / rhs_val\n\nprint(f\"\\nTo find x(1), we set t = {t1}:\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = ({t1})^2/2 - {t1} + {C}\")\n# Print each number in the equation\nterm1 = t1_f**2 / 2\nterm2 = -t1_f\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {term1} + ({term2}) + {C}\")\nprint(f\"-1/x(1) = {rhs_val}\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = -1 / ({rhs_val})\")\nprint(f\"x(1) = {x1}\")\n\n# Final Answer\nfinal_answer = x1\n# <<<8/3>>> is not a valid format, it should be a number.\n# Let's provide the floating point representation for the final answer tag.\nfinal_answer_float = float(x1)\n```\n<<<2.6666666666666665>>>"
