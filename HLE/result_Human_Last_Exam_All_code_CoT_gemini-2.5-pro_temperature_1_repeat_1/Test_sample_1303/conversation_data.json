    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to find the small molecules that interact with the specified ChEMBL target.\n\nFirst, I will use the `chembl_webresource_client` library in Python to connect to the ChEMBL database. This library allows for programmatic access to the vast amount of drug discovery data in ChEMBL.\n\n1.  **Identify the Target:** The provided ID, `CHEMBL4803817`, corresponds to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein.\n2.  **Query for Activities:** I will query the ChEMBL 'activity' endpoint. This endpoint contains information about the measured biological activity of compounds against targets.\n3.  **Filter Results:** To find relevant protein-ligand interactions, I will filter the activities based on the following criteria:\n    *   `target_chembl_id`: Must match the specified ID `CHEMBL4803817`.\n    *   `molecule_type`: Must be 'Small molecule' to exclude biologics or other non-small molecule entities.\n    *   `standard_type`: I will filter for 'IC50' values. IC50 is a common measure of a substance's potency in inhibiting a specific biological or biochemical function, making it a good indicator of interaction.\n4.  **Extract and Display Ligands:** From the filtered activities, I will extract the unique ChEMBL IDs of the interacting small molecules (ligands) and print them for you.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this task.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the ChEMBL web resource client installed:\n# pip install chembl_webresource_client\n\nfrom chembl_webresource_client.new_client import new_client\n\ndef find_interacting_molecules(target_id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds and prints small molecules with reported IC50 activity\n    against a specific ChEMBL target ID.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"Querying ChEMBL for small molecules interacting with target: {target_id}\\n\")\n    \n    try:\n        # Get the activity client\n        activity = new_client.activity\n\n        # Filter activities for the target\n        # We look for small molecules with a reported IC50 value\n        activities = activity.filter(\n            target_chembl_id=target_id,\n            standard_type=\"IC50\",\n            molecule_type=\"Small molecule\"\n        )\n\n        if not activities:\n            print(f\"No small molecules with reported IC50 values found for target {target_id}.\")\n            return\n\n        # Use a set to store unique molecule IDs to avoid duplicates\n        molecule_ids = set()\n        for act in activities:\n            molecule_ids.add(act['molecule_chembl_id'])\n\n        # Sort the IDs for consistent output\n        sorted_molecule_ids = sorted(list(molecule_ids))\n\n        print(f\"Found {len(sorted_molecule_ids)} unique small molecules interacting with {target_id}:\")\n        for mol_id in sorted_molecule_ids:\n            print(mol_id)\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure the chembl_webresource_client is installed ('pip install chembl_webresource_client') and you have an internet connection.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    target_chembl_id = \"CHEMBL4803817\"\n    find_interacting_molecules(target_chembl_id)\n```"
