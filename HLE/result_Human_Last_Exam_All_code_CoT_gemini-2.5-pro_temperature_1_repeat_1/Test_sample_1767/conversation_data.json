    "When two Chern insulators are combined, the Chern number of the resulting system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is because the Chern number is a topological invariant that is additive.\n\nGiven that each Chern insulator has a Chern number of 1, the total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the two.\n\nHere is a Python script to calculate this:\n```python\n# The Chern number of the first insulator\nc1 = 1\n\n# The Chern number of the second insulator\nc2 = 1\n\n# The total Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers\nc_total = c1 + c2\n\nprint(f\"The Chern number of the junction is the sum of the individual Chern numbers:\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c1} + {c2}\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {c_total}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"
