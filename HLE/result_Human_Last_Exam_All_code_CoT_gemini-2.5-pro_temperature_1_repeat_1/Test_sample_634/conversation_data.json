    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we will use a method based on the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Stack the Matrices**: We will create a new, larger matrix `M` by stacking `P1` on top of `P2`.\n    `M = [P1; P2]`\n2.  **Apply Elementary Row Operations**: We will perform a sequence of elementary row operations on `M`. These operations are:\n    *   Swapping any two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another.\n3.  **Reduce the Matrix**: The goal of these operations is to transform `M` into a row-echelon-like form, where we have zero rows at the top and the non-zero rows at the bottom. The resulting matrix will look like `[0; R]`, where `0` is a zero matrix and `R` is a matrix whose rows are linearly independent over the ring of polynomials.\n4.  **Identify the GCRD**: The matrix `R` formed by these non-zero rows is a GCRD of the original matrices `P1` and `P2`.\n5.  **Normalize the GCRD**: The GCRD is unique only up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant, non-zero determinant). We will normalize the resulting GCRD to its simplest canonical form, which is often the identity matrix if the original matrices are right coprime.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the symbolic variable 's'\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # 1.
