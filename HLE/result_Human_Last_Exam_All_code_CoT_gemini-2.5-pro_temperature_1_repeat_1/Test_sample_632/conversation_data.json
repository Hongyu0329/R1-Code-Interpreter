    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to find the answer and present it as a Python script.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user has asked a historical question about an architectural feature removed from Rome's \"Piazza della Rotonda\" in 1950.\n2.  **Historical Research:** I will access my knowledge base to search for modifications made to the Piazza della Rotonda, specifically focusing on removals of structures or infrastructure around the year 1950 by the city administration.\n3.  **Identify the Feature:** The research points to the removal of the tramway system. The tram tracks and their associated overhead lines, which ran directly through the historic square in front of the Pantheon, were a prominent feature of the cityscape for many years. Their removal was part of a broader post-war plan to modernize Rome's transportation system.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** I will write a simple Python script. The script's purpose will be to declare the answer as a string variable and then use the `print()` function to display the information to the user, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_removed_feature():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the architectural feature\n    removed from Piazza della Rotonda in 1950.\n    \"\"\"\n    location = \"Piazza della Rotonda\"\n    year_removed = 1950\n    removed_feature = \"the tramway tracks\"\n\n    print(f\"The unique feature in the '{location}' that was removed by the city administration around the year {year_removed} was {removed_feature}.\")\n\nfind_removed_feature()\n```\n<<<The tramway tracks>>>"
