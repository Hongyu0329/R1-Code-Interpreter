    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the fraction $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find its canonical representation as a single stalk of red and blue pieces.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Model the Game's Value:** In one common interpretation of Red-Blue-Hackenbush, the value of a single stalk made of $n$ pieces is given by the formula:\n    $$V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{2^i}$$\n    where $c_i$ is the color of the $i$-th piece from the ground, and $\\epsilon_i$ is $+1$ if the piece is red and $-1$ if it is blue.\n\n2.  **Set up the Equation:** We want to find the sequence of colors that represents the value $\\frac{13}{16}$. This gives us the equation:\n    $$\\frac{13}{16} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\epsilon_i}{2^i}$$\n\n3.  **Determine the Number of Pieces (n):** The denominator of the sum is $2^n$. To represent a fraction with a denominator of $16 = 2^4$, we will need at least $n=4$ pieces. Let's assume $n=4$ and see if we can find a solution.\n\n4.  **Solve for Coefficients:** For $n=4$, our equation becomes:\n    $$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{\\epsilon_1}{2} + \\frac{\\epsilon_2}{4} + \\frac{\\epsilon_3}{8} + \\frac{\\epsilon_4}{16}$$\n    Multiplying both sides by 16, we get an equation for the integer coefficients $\\epsilon_i \\in \\{+1, -1\\}$:\n    $$13 = 8\\epsilon_1 + 4\\epsilon_2 + 2\\epsilon_3 + 1\\epsilon_4$$\n\n5.  **Find the Sequence:** We will write a Python script to solve for the unique sequence of $\\epsilon_i$ values. This sequence will tell us the color of each piece in the stalk. The length of the sequence is the total number of pieces.\n\n6.  **Output the Result:** The script will print the final equation showing the representation and state the total number of pieces.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_hackenbush_representation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of pieces and their colors to represent a\n    fraction in red-blue-Hackenbush.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = 13\n    den = 16\n\n    print(f\"Finding the red-blue-Hackenbush representation for the number {num}/{den}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # The number of pieces 'n' is determined by the denominator, den = 2^n\n    if den == 0 or (den & (den - 1)) != 0:\n        print(\"Denominator must be a power of 2.\")\n        return\n\n    n = int(math.log2(den))\n\n    # We need to solve: num = sum(eps_i * 2^(n-i)) for i=1 to n\n    # This is equivalent to finding a signed-digit binary representation of num.\n    target = num\n    epsilons = []\n    \n    # We find the coefficients from the most significant to the least significant.\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        power_of_2 = 2**i\n        \n        # The maximum possible sum of the remaining terms.\n        # e.g., if we are at 8, the rest (4, 2, 1) can sum to 7.\n        remaining_max = power_of_2 - 1\n\n        # Determine the coefficient epsilon for the current power of 2.\n        # This algorithm finds the unique non-adjacent form (NAF) representation.\n        if target > remaining_max:\n            epsilon = 1\n        elif target < -remaining_max:\n            epsilon = -1\n        else: # The target is within the range of the remaining terms\n            # We must use the coefficient that makes the new target have the\n            # opposite sign or be zero, to ensure the next coefficient can be found.\n            # In this unique representation, one must be chosen over the other.\n            # A simpler way is to check which choice leaves an even remainder.\n            if (target - power_of_2) % 2 == 0:\n                epsilon = 1\n            else:\n                epsilon = -1\n    \n    # The above logic can be simplified for this problem.
