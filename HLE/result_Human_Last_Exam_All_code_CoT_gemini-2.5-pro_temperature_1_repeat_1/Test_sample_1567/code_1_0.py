        "1. Understanding the Goal",
        "The question asks for the maximal number of measures, k, such that for ANY set of k measures satisfying the conditions, it is IMPOSSIBLE to GUARANTEE that the walk returns to the origin.",
        "\"Impossible to guarantee return\" means that for any given set of k measures, there is at least one control strategy that makes the walk transient (i.e., there is a non-zero probability that it never returns to the origin).",
        "\n2. The Controller's Power",
        "At each step, the controller chooses a measure from the set {v_1, v_2, ..., v_k} based on the walk's history. The controller is free to choose ANY strategy.",
        "This includes very simple strategies.",
        "\n3. A Simple Strategy",
        "Consider the following simple strategy for the controller: 'At every step, regardless of the history, choose the first measure, v_1.'",
        "This is a valid strategy because the choice (always '1') is a (constant) function of the history.",
        "\n4. Analyzing the Outcome of the Simple Strategy",
        "If the controller adopts this strategy, the controlled random walk is no longer 'controlled' in a complex way. It becomes a standard random walk where each step is an independent random variable drawn from the same, fixed probability measure v_1.",
        "\n5. Applying a Classic Result",
        "The problem states the following about each measure v_i (and therefore about v_1):",
        "  - The walk is on the lattice Z^d, with d >= 3.",
        "  - The measure has a mean of 0.",
        "  - The measure is 'genuinely d-dimensional'.",
        "A celebrated theorem by George Pólya states that a random walk with these properties is transient. A transient walk does not guarantee a return to the origin.",
        "\n6. Synthesizing the Argument",
        "Let's check if the condition in the question holds for any k >= 1.",
        "  - Pick any integer k >= 1.",
        "  - Pick any set of k measures {v_1, ..., v_k} that satisfy the problem's conditions.",
        "  - We must show that there exists a strategy that leads to a transient walk.",
        "  - As shown above, the simple strategy of 'always choosing v_1' results in a classic transient random walk.",
        "  - Therefore, for any set of k measures, we have found a strategy that makes the walk transient. This means it is impossible to guarantee a return to the origin.",
        "\n7. Conclusion",
        "The condition holds for k=1, k=2, k=3, and so on, for all positive integers k.",
        "Since the condition is true for every integer k, there is no maximal integer k.",
        "The answer is therefore infinity.",
