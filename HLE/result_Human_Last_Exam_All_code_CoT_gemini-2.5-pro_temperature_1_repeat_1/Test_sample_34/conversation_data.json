    "My plan is to determine the correct pre-flop opening range for the specified poker scenario and then find the weakest suited Jack within that range.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Scenario:** The game is a 100BB deep, rake-free cash game. The action is an open-raise from the Button (BTN) to 2.5x the big blind.\n2.  **Button's Strategy:** The Button is the most profitable position in poker, allowing for a very wide opening range. A player on the button is guaranteed to have a positional advantage post-flop.\n3.  **Rake-Free Impact:** In a rake-free environment, more hands become profitable to play because you don't have to overcome the house's cut of the pot. This encourages opening even wider than in a standard, raked game.\n4.  **Consult GTO Range:** Game Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers show that in this specific scenario (100BB, BTN open, rake-free), the opening range is extremely wide, often over 50% of all possible hands. This range includes all suited Ax, Kx, Qx, and Jx hands.\n5.  **Identify Worst Suited Jack:** The suited Jack hands are JAs, JKs, JQs, JTs, J9s, J8s, J7s, J6s, J5s, J4s, J3s, and J2s. Since the GTO range includes opening all of them, the \"worst\" one is the hand with the lowest numerical rank, which is Jack-Two suited.\n\nThe Python code below will walk through this logic and print the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_opening_hand():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes a poker scenario to find the worst suited Jack to open from the button.\n    \"\"\"\n    scenario = \"100BB deep, Rake-Free Cash Game, Open-raise from Button to 2.5x\"\n    position = \"Button (BTN)\"\n    hand_category = \"Suited Jacks (Jxs)\"\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the poker hand range for the following scenario:\")\n    print(f\"Scenario: {scenario}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Evaluating the Button's opening strategy.\")\n    print(f\"In poker, the {position} is the most powerful pre-flop position.\")\n    print(\"This allows a player to profitably open-raise with a very wide range of hands.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Considering the 'Rake-Free' condition.\")\n    print(\"A rake-free game increases the profitability of marginal hands.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the optimal opening range is even wider than in a standard game.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Determining the GTO (Game Theory Optimal) range.\")\n    print(f\"For this scenario, the GTO opening range from the {position} is very wide.\")\n    print(f\"This range includes all {hand_category}.\")\n    all_suited_jacks = [\"JAs\", \"JKs\", \"JQs\", \"JTs\", \"J9s\", \"J8s\", \"J7s\", \"J6s\", \"J5s\", \"J4s\", \"J3s\", \"J2s\"]\n    print(f\"The suited Jack hands in this opening range are: {', '.join(all_suited_jacks)}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Identifying the 'worst' hand in the opening range.\")\n    print(\"The 'worst' hand is the one with the lowest kicker, as it has the least equity.\")\n    worst_hand = all_suited_jacks[-1] # The last one in the sorted list\n    print(f\"Out of all the suited Jacks that should be opened, the worst one is {worst_hand}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n\n    print(f\"The final answer is: {worst_hand}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_worst_opening_hand()\n\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
