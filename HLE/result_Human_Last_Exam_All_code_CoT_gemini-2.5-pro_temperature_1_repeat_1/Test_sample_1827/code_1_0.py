    Calculates the number of Goldstone bosons based on the symmetry breaking pattern
    described in the problem.

    The calculation follows these steps:
    1. Define the symmetry group G of the gas phase and find its dimension.
    2. Define the unbroken symmetry group H of the condensed phase and find its dimension.
    3. Calculate the number of broken generators, which equals the number of Goldstone bosons.
