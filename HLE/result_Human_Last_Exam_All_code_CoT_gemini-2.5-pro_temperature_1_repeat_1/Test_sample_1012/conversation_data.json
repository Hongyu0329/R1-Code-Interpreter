    "To determine the minimum symmetric key length required to be secure against a quantum computer, we need to consider the most effective quantum attack against symmetric cryptography. This attack is based on Grover's algorithm.\n\nHere is the step-by-step thinking process:\n1.  **Identify the Threat:** The primary quantum algorithm for breaking symmetric encryption is Grover's algorithm. It's an algorithm for unstructured search, which is what brute-forcing a key is.\n2.  **Understand the Impact:** Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup. For a key of length 'n', a classical brute-force attack takes approximately 2^n operations. A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm can perform the same attack in approximately âˆš2^n = 2^(n/2) operations. This effectively halves the security strength (in bits) of the key.\n3.  **Determine the Security Target:** The generally accepted standard for long-term security is 128 bits. This means an attacker would need to perform about 2^128 operations to break the encryption, which is considered computationally infeasible. We want to maintain this 128-bit security level even against a quantum computer.\n4.  **Calculate the Required Key Length:** Let 'k' be the required key length. To achieve a 128-bit security level against a quantum computer, the number of operations for a quantum attack, 2^(k/2), must be at least 2^128.\n    *   k / 2 = 128\n    *   k = 128 * 2\n    *   k = 256\n5.  **Conclusion:** To achieve a post-quantum security level equivalent to 128 bits of classical security, a symmetric key must be at least 256 bits long. This is why AES-256 is recommended for post-quantum resilience, whereas AES-128 is not.\n\nThe following Python code explains and performs this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_post_quantum_key_length():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum symmetric key length needed for security\n    against a quantum computer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. Define the desired security level.\n    # A security level of 128 bits (requiring 2^128 operations to break)\n    # is the industry standard for long-term security.\n    desired_security_level = 128\n\n    # 2. Define the impact of the quantum attack (Grover's algorithm).\n    # Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup, meaning it can find a key\n    # in the square root of the number of steps a classical computer would need.\n    # This effectively halves the security bits of a key (n becomes n/2).\n    # To counteract this, we must multiply the desired security level by 2.\n    security_multiplier = 2\n\n    # 3. Calculate the required key length.\n    required_key_length = desired_security_level * security_multiplier\n\n    # 4.
