    "The ground space degeneracy (GSD) of the toric code is determined by the topology of the surface on which it's defined. The degeneracy is given by `2^k`, where `k` is the number of independent logical qubits the code can store.\n\n### Step-by-step Derivation:\n\n1.  **Starting Point:** We assume the toric code is defined on a 2D surface that is topologically equivalent to a sphere (genus `g=0`) before any holes are introduced. A toric code on a simple sphere has a non-degenerate ground state (`k=0`, GSD = 1).\n\n2.  **Introducing Holes:** The degeneracy arises when we introduce holes (boundaries) into this surface. The properties of the logical operators depend on the type of boundary.\n    *   **Smooth holes:** These boundaries allow logical Z-type operators (strings of Pauli X operators) to terminate.\n    *   **Rough holes:** These boundaries allow logical X-type operators (strings of Pauli Z operators) to terminate.\n\n3.  **Counting Logical Qubits:** A logical qubit requires a pair of logical operators (`X_L`, `Z_L`) that anti-commute. The presence of holes allows for the creation of such operators.\n    *   **Smooth Hole Sector:** With `n` smooth holes, we can construct `n-1` independent logical qubits. For each qubit, the logical `Z_L` operator is a string connecting two smooth holes, and the corresponding logical `X_L` is an operator that encircles one of those holes. These operators are independent for each of the `n-1` hole pairs. This gives `max(0, n-1)` qubits.\n    *   **Rough Hole Sector:** Similarly, with `m` rough holes, we can construct `m-1` independent logical qubits. For each qubit, the logical `X_L` operator is a string connecting two rough holes, and the corresponding logical `Z_L` is an operator that encircles one of them. This gives `max(0, m-1)` qubits.\n\n4.  **Total Degeneracy:** The operators from the smooth sector commute with the operators from the rough sector. Therefore, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each sector:\n    `k = max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1)`\n    The general formula for the GSD is `2^(max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1))`.\n\n5.  **Analyzing the Answer Choices:** The provided options do not exactly match this general formula for all possible `n` and `m` (e.g., when `n=0` or `m=0`). However, answer choice B is `2^(m+n-2)`. Let's see when our derived formula matches this.\n    If we assume that there is at least one of each type of hole (`n >= 1` and `m >= 1`), our formula becomes:\n    `k = (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2`\n    In this common scenario, the GSD is `2^(n+m-2)`. Questions of this type often imply this general case where both types of holes are present.\n\nTherefore, option B is the correct answer under the most general interpretation where `n` and `m` are both at least 1.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates the calculation for example values of `n` and `m`, assuming this common case.\n\n```python\n# Number of smooth holes\nn = 3\n\n# Number of rough holes\nm = 4\n\n# The ground space degeneracy of the toric code on a sphere with n smooth and m rough holes\n# is given by 2^k, where k is the number of logical qubits.\n# Assuming n >= 1 and m >= 1, the number of logical qubits k is (n-1) + (m-1) = n+m-2.\n# This corresponds to answer choice B.\n\nif n >= 1 and m >= 1:\n    # Calculate the exponent k\n    k = n + m - 2\n    \n    # Calculate the ground space degeneracy\n    degeneracy = 2**k\n    \n    # Print the equation step-by-step\n    # Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    print(f\"For n = {n} smooth holes and m = {m} rough holes:\")\n    print(f\"The ground space degeneracy is 2^(n + m - 2) = 2^({n} + {m} - 2) = 2^{k} = {degeneracy}\")\nelse:\n    # The more general formula is k = max(0, n-1) + max(0, m-1)\n    k_general = max(0, n - 1) + max(0, m - 1)\n    degeneracy_general = 2**k_general\n    print(f\"The formula 2^(n+m-2) assumes n>=1 and m>=1.\")\n    print(f\"Using the general formula for n={n}, m={m}:\")\n    print(f\"k = max(0, {n}-1) + max(0, {m}-1) = {k_general}\")\n    print(f\"Degeneracy = 2^{k_general} = {degeneracy_general}\")\n\n```\n<<<B>>>"
