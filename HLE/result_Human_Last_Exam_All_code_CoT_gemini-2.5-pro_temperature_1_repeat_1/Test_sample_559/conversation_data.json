    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Find Equilibrium Points**: I will start by finding the equilibrium points of the system by setting $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n2.  **Classify Equilibrium Points**: I will then classify these points by linearizing the system. The stability of these points is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at each point. Separatrices are typically the stable and unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n3.  **Determine Trajectory Equation**: I will derive the differential equation for the phase plane trajectories, which is $\\frac{dd}{du}$.\n4.  **Find the Separatrix**: I will look for a particular solution to the phase plane equation that represents a manifold of a saddle point. I will test for a simple function (e.g., a polynomial) that satisfies the equation and passes through the relevant equilibrium points. This curve will be the separatrix.\n5.  **Construct the Final Code**: Based on the derived equation of the separatrix, I will write a Python script to display the result. The script will print the final equation and explicitly state the numbers that constitute it, as requested.\n\nExecuting the plan:\n1.  Setting $u' = u^2(u-1) = 0$ gives equilibrium values at $u=0$ and $u=1$.\n    *   If $u=0$, the $d'$ equation becomes $2d^2 = 0$, so $d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point $(0,0)$.\n    *   If $u=1$, the $d'$ equation becomes $2d^2 + 2d = 0$, or $2d(d+1)=0$, giving $d=0$ or $d=-1$. This gives equilibrium points $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$.\n\n2.  The Jacobian matrix is $J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   At $(1,0)$, the eigenvalues are $1$ and $2$, making it an unstable node.\n    *   At $(1,-1)$, the eigenvalues are $1$ and $-2$, making it a saddle point.\n    *   At $(0,0)$, the eigenvalues are both $0$, so linearization is inconclusive, but it's a degenerate point.\n\n3.  The separatrix will be the stable or unstable manifold of the saddle point $(1,-1)$. The phase plane equation is $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (5u^2-3u)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\n\n4.  I will test for a simple solution. Let's try the form $d(u) = -u^2$.\n    *   LHS: $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\n    *   RHS: Substitute $d=-u^2$ into the expression for $\\frac{dd}{du}$:\n        $\\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (5u^2-3u)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{2u^4 - 5u^4 + 3u^3 - u^3 + u^4}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^4+2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} = \\frac{-2u^3(u-1)}{u^2(u-1)} = -2u$.\n    *   Since LHS = RHS, $d=-u^2$ is an exact solution for a trajectory. This curve passes through both the saddle point $(1, -1)$ (since $-1 = -(1)^2$) and the equilibrium point $(0,0)$. The slope of this curve at $u=1$ is $-2$, which matches the direction of the unstable eigenvector of the saddle point. Thus, $d=-u^2$ is the unstable manifold of the saddle point and serves as the separatrix for the system.\n\n5.  The following Python code will present this finding.\n\n```python\n# The analysis of the system of differential equations reveals that\n# the separatrix is described by a simple parabolic equation.\n# This code defines and prints this equation and its numerical components.\n\n# The equation of the separatrix is of the form d = c * u^p.\n# From the derivation, we found the specific values for the coefficient and the power.\ncoefficient = -1\npower = 2\n\n# Print the final equation for the separatrix.\nprint(f\"The equation of the separatrix is: d = {coefficient} * u**{power}\")\n\n# As requested, here are the numbers that make up the final equation.\nprint(\"\\nThe numbers in the final equation are:\")\nprint(f\"The coefficient is: {coefficient}\")\nprint(f\"The power (exponent) is: {power}\")\n```\n<<<d = -u**2>>>"
