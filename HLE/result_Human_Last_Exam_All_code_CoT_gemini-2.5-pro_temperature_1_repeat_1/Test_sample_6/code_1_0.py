    """
    This script calculates the number of spin-2 Kaluza-Klein modes with
    mass-squared below 14 for the given 5D warped compactification.

    The problem is equivalent to finding the number of eigenvalues below 14
    for the SchrÃ¶dinger operator H = -d^2/dx^2 + V(x) on a circle.

    The potential V(x) is derived from the warp factor A(x) = sin(x) + 4*cos(x)
    and is found to be:
    V(x) = 34 - 8*cos(x) - 2*sin(x) - 30*cos(2x) - 16*sin(2x)
    
    We solve this by diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a truncated Fourier basis.
