# The user wants me to identify the incorrect statement among the given options.
# I have analyzed each option based on historical and philosophical knowledge about Saint Augustine and his interpreters.

# A is correct: The connection between Augustinian and Calvinist predestination is a long-standing topic of discussion.
# C is correct: The "voluntas" (will) is a central concept of the psyche for Augustine.
# D is correct: The intertwining of philosophy and theology is a hallmark of Augustine's thought.
# E is correct: This represents a known, nuanced scholarly interpretation by Ã‰tienne Gilson.
# F is correct: This accurately describes the argument about responsibility in Augustine's dialogue with Evodius.
# B is incorrect: R. A. Markus is a major scholar of Augustine. He did discuss the asymmetry of freedom, but it is inconceivable that he would have *ignored* the related and crucial concepts of grace and predestination. His scholarship is known for its comprehensive nature. Therefore, this statement mischaracterizes his work.

incorrect_statement = "B"

print(f"The incorrect statement is option {incorrect_statement}.")
print("R. A. Markus, a prominent scholar on Augustine, argued that Augustine's concept of freedom was 'asymmetrical.'")
print("However, the claim that he did so while 'ignoring his thoughts on predestination and grace' is false.")
print("These concepts are inextricably linked in Augustine's thought, and Markus's analysis integrates them rather than ignoring them.")
