# Plan:
# 1. Define the components of the formula for the maximal Hodge number h^{1,1}(M).
#    The formula is h^{1,1}(M) = h^{1,1}_+(S x C) + (number of components of the singular locus).
# 2. The invariant part is h^{1,1}_+(S x C) = h^{1,1}_+(S) + h^{1,1}_+(C).
#    - h^{1,1}_+(S) = 10 for a non-symplectic involution on a K3 surface with fixed points.
#    - h^{1,1}_+(C) = 1 for any involution on a curve.
# 3. The number of singular components is k * N_psi. We need to maximize k and N_psi.
#    - k is the number of connected components of the fixed locus of rho. The maximum is 8 (elliptic curves).
#    - N_psi is the number of fixed points of psi. The maximum for a genus 2 curve is 6 (hyperelliptic involution).
# 4. Calculate the sum and print the final equation.

# Dimension of the invariant part of H^{1,1} of the K3 surface S
h11_S_plus = 10

# Dimension of the invariant part of H^{1,1} of the curve C
h11_C_plus = 1

# Maximal number of components of the fixed locus of the involution rho on S
k_max = 8

# Maximal number of fixed points of the involution psi on C
N_psi_max = 6

# The invariant part of h^{1,1} for the product space S x C
h11_inv_X = h11_S_plus + h11_C_plus

# The contribution from resolving the singularities, which equals the number of components of the singular locus
correction_term = k_max * N_psi_max

# The maximal value for h^{1,1}(M)
h11_M_max = h11_inv_X + correction_term

# Print the final calculation, showing each number in the equation.
