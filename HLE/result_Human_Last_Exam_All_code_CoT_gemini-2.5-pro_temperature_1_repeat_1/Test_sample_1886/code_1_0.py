        ('B', "To distinguish words that are pronounced the same way, but have more than one meaning.", True, "This is a function. It distinguishes homophones, such as 'sur' (on) and 'sûr' (sure), or 'du' (of the) and 'dû' (due)."),
        ('C', "To indicate a vowel pronounced as [o] within words originating in Classical Latin.", True, "This is a function, at least from a modern descriptive view. The accent 'ô' consistently signals the [o] sound (e.g., in 'côte', 'hôpital'), which is a guide to pronunciation."),
        ('D', "To distinguish between short and long vowel sounds.", True, "This is a function. Historically, the circumflex marked a long vowel (e.g., 'pâte' vs. 'patte'). While this distinction is largely lost in Parisian French, it was a primary historical role."),
        ('E', "None of the options.", False, "This is incorrect because there is an option that was never a function."),
        ('F', "To make a word appear more prestigious.", True, "This was an attested practice. In the 16th-17th centuries, some writers used the circumflex for hypercorrection or to give a word a more 'learned' appearance, connecting it to a Latin or Greek root."),
        ('G', "To indicate where a diphthong has been reduced to a single vowel sound.", False, "This has never been a function. The reduction of a diphthong (monophthongization) is a different phonological process. The circumflex is typically used to mark a lost consonant (like 's') or the contraction of two identical vowels, not a reduced diphthong."),
        ('H', "To indicate where a sibilant once existed in both the spoken and written language.", True, "This is a key function. The circumflex very often marks the historical loss of a sibilant, usually an 's', as in 'forêt' (from 'forest') or 'hôpital' (from 'hospital')."),
        ('I', "To indicate where two consecutive vowels in hiatus have been reduced to a single vowel sound.", True, "This is a function. For example, 'âge' comes from the Old French 'aage', where the two 'a' vowels were contracted into one.")
