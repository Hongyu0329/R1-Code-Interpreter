    "No, structurally, polynucleotides (including homopolynucleotides) are not polysaccharides. Although both are large biological polymers (macromolecules), they are fundamentally different in their chemical structure.\n\nI will provide a Python script that prints a detailed comparison to explain the key differences.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Directly answer the question with a `print` statement.\n2.  Create two Python dictionaries, one for polynucleotides and one for polysaccharides, to store their defining structural characteristics.\n3.  Iterate through these dictionaries to print a clear, side-by-side comparison of the two molecule types, focusing on:\n    *   The monomer (basic building block).\n    *   The components of the monomer.\n    *   The type of bond linking the monomers.\n    *   The overall elemental composition.\n4.
