    print("The 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is a principle in quantum field theory.")
    print("It states that the value of an anomaly for a GLOBAL symmetry must be the same at high energies (the UV theory) and at low energies (the IR effective theory).")
    print("This is because these anomalies are robust and do not change as we integrate out heavy particles to go from the UV to the IR.\n")

    print("- Choice B ('Consistency of UV and IR anomalies'): This is a good description of the condition itself, but not its primary implication.")
    print("- Choice D ('Requirement of anomaly cancellation'): This is incorrect. It applies to GAUGE anomalies, which must be cancelled. 't Hooft's condition is about GLOBAL anomalies, which are physical and do not need to be cancelled.")
    print("- Choice C ('Constraint on low-energy effective theories'): This is a direct consequence. Because the IR anomaly must match the UV anomaly, any proposed low-energy theory is not arbitrary; it is heavily constrained by this matching requirement. This is a very strong candidate for the main implication.")
    print("- Choice F ('Anomalies dictate symmetry realization'): This describes the mechanism of the constraint. To match the anomaly, the IR theory must either contain massless fermions or feature spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is a more specific outcome of the general constraint described in C.\n")

    print("### Step 4: Conclusion ###")
    print("The most direct and general physical implication of the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition is that it imposes a powerful, non-perturbative check on the dynamics of a theory.")
