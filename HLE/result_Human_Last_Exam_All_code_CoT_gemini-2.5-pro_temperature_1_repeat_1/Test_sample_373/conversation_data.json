    "Of course. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Model the Graph**: First, I'll model the specified barbell graph. A barbell graph with 10 nodes consists of two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (K5), connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck.\"\n2.  **Analyze the Gossiping Process**: Randomized uniform gossiping works by first picking a node `i` uniformly at random from all `N` nodes, and then picking one of its neighbors `j` uniformly at random. The probability of sampling a specific edge `(u, v)` is the sum of the probabilities of two events: (1) picking node `u` then neighbor `v`, and (2) picking node `v` then neighbor `u`.\n3.  **Calculate Node Degrees**: I need to determine the degree of the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge. Let's call these nodes `u` and `v`. Each is part of a 5-node clique, so it has `5 - 1 = 4` neighbors within its clique. It also has one connection across the bottleneck. Thus, the degree of both `u` and `v` is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n4.  **Calculate the Probability**:\n    *   The probability of picking any single node is `1 / N = 1 / 10`.\n    *   The probability of picking a specific neighbor of a node `u` is `1 / degree(u)`.\n    *   The total probability is `P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)`.\n    *   This translates to `(1/10) * (1/5) + (1/10) * (1/5)`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that implements this calculation and prints the entire equation step-by-step, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_bottleneck_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph\n    with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # A 10-node barbell graph consists of two K5 cliques.\n    # Number of nodes in each clique\n    nodes_per_clique = 5\n\n    # The bottleneck edge connects one node from each clique.\n    # The degree of such a node is its neighbors within the clique (nodes_per_clique - 1)\n    # plus the one connection via the bottleneck.\n    degree_bottleneck_node = (nodes_per_clique - 1) + 1\n\n    # In uniform gossiping, the probability of sampling an edge (u, v) is:\n    # P(pick u) * P(pick v | u) + P(pick v) * P(pick u | v)\n    # P(pick node) = 1 / total_nodes\n    # P(pick neighbor | node) = 1 / degree(node)\n\n    prob_pick_u = f\"1/{total_nodes}\"\n    prob_pick_v_from_u = f\"1/{degree_bottleneck_node}\"\n    \n    prob_pick_v = f\"1/{total_nodes}\"\n    prob_pick_u_from_v = f\"1/{degree_bottleneck_node}\"\n\n    # The final probability calculation\n    final_prob = (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node) + \\\n                 (1 / total_nodes) * (1 / degree_bottleneck_node)\n                 \n    term1_denominator = total_nodes * degree_bottleneck_node\n    term2_denominator = total_nodes * degree_bottleneck_node\n    \n    final_numerator = 2\n    final_denominator = total_nodes * degree_bottleneck_node\n    \n    simplified_denominator = final_denominator // final_numerator\n    \n    print(\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is calculated as follows:\")\n    print(\"P(sampling) = P(picking first node) * P(picking second node) + P(picking second node) * P(picking first node)\")\n    print(f\"P(sampling) = ({prob_pick_u}) * ({prob_pick_v_from_u}) + ({prob_pick_v}) * ({prob_pick_u_from_v})\")\n    print(f\"P(sampling) = 1/{term1_denominator} + 1/{term2_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"P(sampling) = {final_numerator}/{final_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"P(sampling) = 1/{simplified_denominator}\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe final probability is: {final_prob}\")\n\ncalculate_bottleneck_probability()\n```\n<<<0.04>>>"
