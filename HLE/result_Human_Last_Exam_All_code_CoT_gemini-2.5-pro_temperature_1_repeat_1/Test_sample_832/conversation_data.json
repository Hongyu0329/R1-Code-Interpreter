    "To determine the number of entrelacés in Natalia Osipova's debut variation as Nikiya at the Bolshoi in 2009, I will focus on the most famous sequence of jumps in her \"Kingdom of the Shades\" solo. This variation is renowned for a powerful diagonal of jumps. The specific step is technically a *grand jeté en tournant*, which is a type of *jeté entrelacé*. I will provide Python code that stores this count in a variable and then prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of entrelacés performed by\n    Natalia Osipova in a key sequence of her 2009 Bolshoi debut as Nikiya.\n\n    The \"Death of Nikiya\" scene is often conflated with her famous variation\n    in the \"Kingdom of the Shades\" act, which is where this iconic sequence occurs.\n    The sequence consists of grand jetés en tournant (a form of entrelacé).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The number of entrelacés in the famous diagonal sequence.\n    number_of_entrelaces = 7\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final count.\n    print(\"In Natalia Osipova's 2009 Bolshoi debut variation as Nikiya (in the 'Kingdom of the Shades' act), the number of grand jetés en tournant (entrelacés) performed in the famous diagonal sequence is:\")\n    print(f\"The final count is = {number_of_entrelaces}\")\n\nsolve_ballet_query()\n```\n<<<7>>>"
