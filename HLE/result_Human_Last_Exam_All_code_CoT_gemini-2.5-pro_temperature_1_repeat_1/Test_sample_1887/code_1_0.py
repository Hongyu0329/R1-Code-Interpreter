    print("Combining these, lambda must be an uncountable regular cardinal.")

    print("\nStep 3: Determine the range of possible cofinalities")

    print("We can construct a candidate for kappa, for instance kappa = aleph_lambda. Since lambda is an uncountable cardinal, it's a limit ordinal, which makes aleph_lambda a singular cardinal with cf(aleph_lambda) = cf(lambda) = lambda.")

    print("The remaining condition is kappa < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}, which becomes aleph_lambda < aleph_{omega_{omega+5}}. This is equivalent to the ordinal inequality lambda < omega_{omega+5}.")
