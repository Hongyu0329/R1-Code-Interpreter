    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, the bare Green's function, $G_0(k, \\omega)$, describes the propagation of a non-interacting particle. It is a fundamental concept in many-body quantum mechanics. Its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalues, $\\epsilon_k$, is a cornerstone of the theory.\n\nThe functional form is most easily expressed in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ space. The bare Green's function is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere's a breakdown of the terms:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$: The bare Green's function for a particle with momentum $k$ and energy $\\omega$.\n*   $\\omega$: The energy variable.\n*   $\\epsilon_k$: The energy of a single, non-interacting particle in the state labeled by the quantum number $k$ (e.g., momentum). This is the energy eigenvalue.\n*   $i\\eta$: A crucial term where $\\eta$ is a positive infinitesimal quantity ($\\eta \\to 0^+$). This term correctly handles the pole at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k$ and ensures the causality of the propagator, meaning that effects do not precede their causes.\n\nThe formula shows that the Green's function has an **inverse dependence** on the difference between the energy variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. The propagator becomes very large when the particle's energy $\\omega$ is close to one of the system's allowed energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$, which corresponds to a resonance.\n\nThe following Python code calculates the value of the bare Green's function for a given set of parameters, demonstrating this relationship.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef calculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0(k, omega).\n\n    Args:\n        omega (float): The energy variable.\n        epsilon_k (float): The single-particle energy eigenvalue.\n        eta (float): A small positive infinitesimal for causality.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The formula is G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\n    denominator = (omega - epsilon_k) + 1j * eta\n    g0 = 1 / denominator\n\n    print(\"The functional dependence of the bare Green's function G_0 on the single-particle energy\")\n    print(\"eigenvalue epsilon_k is given by:\")\n    print(\"G_0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + i*eta)\\n\")\n\n    print(f\"Using the following example values:\")\n    print(f\"omega = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"epsilon_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"eta = {eta}\\n\")\n\n    # Print the equation with the specific numbers plugged in\n    print(\"The calculation is:\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / (({omega}) - ({epsilon_k}) + i*({eta}))\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({denominator:.4f})\")\n    print(f\"G_0 = {g0:.4f}\")\n\n# --- Parameters ---\n# Energy variable (e.g., in eV)\nomega = 2.5\n# Single-particle energy eigenvalue (e.g., in eV)\nepsilon_k = 2.2\n# Infinitesimal shift (a small positive number)\neta = 0.1\n\n# --- Calculation and Output ---\ncalculate_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k, eta)\n\n```\n<<<The functional dependence is $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, meaning the bare Green's function is inversely proportional to the difference between the energy variable $\\omega$ and the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$.>>>"
