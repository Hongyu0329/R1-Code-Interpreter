    This function identifies the incorrect statements about State Enumeration Graphs (SEG)
    and Logical Attack Graphs (LAG) from the given options.

    The analysis of each option is as follows:
    A. Correct. The worst-case generation complexity for both graph types is exponential.
    B. Correct. SEGs are more expressive and can model attack paths (e.g., non-monotonic ones) that standard LAGs cannot.
    C. Incorrect. The primary reason for the size reduction is state abstraction. Monotonicity is a crucial enabling assumption for this abstraction, but not the direct reason itself. The statement is an oversimplification.
    D. Incorrect. Calculating probabilities in a cyclic SEG is a standard problem in Markov chain theory. Since the statement claims it's impossible for "Neither", it is false.
    E. Correct. The monotonicity assumption of standard LAGs prevents them from handling general negation, whereas the full state representation of SEGs allows it.

    The incorrect statements are C and D. They are presented in alphabetical order.
