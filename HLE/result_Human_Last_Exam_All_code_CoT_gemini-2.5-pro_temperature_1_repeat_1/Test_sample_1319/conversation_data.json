    "Here is my plan to solve this task:\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of the major historical mountains mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus as per the user's request.\n2.  Next, I will find the modern names and elevations (in meters) for each of these mountains. The mountains I will consider are Mount Ida (the one near Troy), Mount Samothrace, Mount Athos, and Mount Pelion.\n3.  I will then write a Python script to store these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will iterate through the dictionary to find the mountain with the highest elevation.\n5.  Finally, the script will print the name and elevation of each mountain for comparison, and then declare the tallest one as the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain_in_iliad():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, after Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: A dictionary of mountains from the Iliad (excluding Olympus) and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Ida\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n    }\n\n    # Step 3: Find the tallest mountain\n    tallest_mountain_name = \"\"\n    tallest_mountain_height = 0\n\n    print(\"Comparing the elevations of mountains mentioned in the Iliad:\")\n    # Using max with a lambda function to find the key with the highest value\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    tallest_mountain_height = mountains[tallest_mountain_name]\n\n    # Step 4: Print the comparison and the result\n    for name, height in mountains.items():\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height} meters\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nAfter Mount Olympus, the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad is {tallest_mountain_name} with an elevation of {tallest_mountain_height} meters.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain_in_iliad()\n```\n<<<Mount Athos>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
