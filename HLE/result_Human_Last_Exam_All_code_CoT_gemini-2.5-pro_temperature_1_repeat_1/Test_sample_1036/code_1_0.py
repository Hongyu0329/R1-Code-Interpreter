    This function calculates the number of positive integers n that satisfy the given properties.

    The problem asks for the number of positive integers n <= lcm(1, 2, ..., 100)
    such that n gives a different remainder when divided by each of k = 2, 3, ..., 100.

    Let r_k = n mod k. The conditions are:
    1. The set of remainders {r_2, r_3, ..., r_100} contains 99 distinct values.
    2. For any k and any divisor d of k, we must have r_k % d == r_d.

    We analyzed the possible sequences of remainders (r_2, r_3, ...).

    - A detailed case-by-case analysis on the first few remainders (r_2, r_3, r_4, r_6)
      shows that only two starting patterns are possible:
      1. (r_2, r_3) = (0, 1)
      2. (r_2, r_3) = (1, 2)

    - We can prove by induction that the first pattern forces the entire sequence to be r_k = k - 2 for all k in [2, 100]. This corresponds to the integer n = lcm(1,..,100) - 2.
    - Similarly, the second pattern forces the sequence to be r_k = k - 1 for all k in [2, 100]. This corresponds to the integer n = lcm(1,..,100) - 1.

    - All other possible paths for the sequence of remainders lead to a contradiction at some point.
    - Therefore, there are only two such integer solutions.
