    "To solve this problem, we need to identify the specific 4-polytope described and then determine its f-vector, which is the sequence of its number of vertices, edges, 2-faces, and 3-faces $(f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3)$.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Deconstruct the Request**: The polytope is a 4-polytope that is non-simplicial, has 6 vertices ($f_0=6$), and has the maximal number of 2-faces ($f_2$) for such a polytope.\n2.  **Identify the Polytope**:\n    *   According to the complete classification of 4-polytopes with a small number of vertices, there are exactly three combinatorial types of 4-polytopes with 6 vertices.\n    *   Two of these are *simplicial* (all their facets are tetrahedra): the cyclic polytope $C_4(6)$ with f-vector $(6, 15, 18, 9)$ and the bipyramid over a tetrahedron with f-vector $(6, 14, 16, 8)$.\n    *   The third type, the **pyramid over a square pyramid**, is the only *non-simplicial* type with 6 vertices.\n    *   The absolute maximum number of 2-faces for any 4-polytope with 6 vertices is 18, achieved by the simplicial cyclic polytope. Since the problem demands a non-simplicial one, the phrase \"maximal number of 2-faces\" must refer to the maximum possible for a non-simplicial polytope with 6 vertices. As there's only one such type, it trivially satisfies this condition.\n    *   Therefore, the polytope in question is the pyramid over a square pyramid.\n3.  **Calculate the f-vector**:\n    *   We can calculate the f-vector by using the \"pyramid\" construction twice. The f-vector of a pyramid built over a base polytope `P` can be derived from the f-vector of `P`.\n    *   **Step A**: Start with a 2D square. Its f-vector is $(f_0, f_1) = (4, 4)$.\n    *   **Step B**: Construct a 3D square pyramid by building a pyramid over the square. Its f-vector will be $(f_0+1, f_1+f_0, f_2+f_1)$, where the base f-vector is $(4, 4, 1)$ (vertices, edges, 1 face). This gives $(5, 8, 5)$.\n    *   **Step C**: Construct the final 4D polytope by building a pyramid over the 3D square pyramid. Its f-vector will be $(f_0+1, f_1+f_0, f_2+f_1, f_3+f_2)$, where the base f-vector is $(5, 8, 5, 1)$. This gives the final result.\n\nThe following Python code implements this calculation.\n\n```python\ndef pyramid_f_vector(base_f_vector):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the f-vector of a pyramid constructed over a base polytope.\n    The base polytope's f-vector is given as a list [f_0, f_1, ...].\n    The dimension of the base is len(base_f_vector).\n    The pyramid has dimension len(base_f_vector) + 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The f-vector of a k-polytope has k+1 elements (f_0 to f_k)\n    # To handle indexing easily, we treat the polytope itself as f_{dim} = 1\n    # and use a conventional f_{-1} = 1 for the new apex.\n    # f_i(Pyramid) = f_i(Base) + f_{i-1}(Base)\n    \n    # Prepend f_{-1}=1 for the apex calculation\n    extended_base_f = [1] + base_f_vector\n    \n    pyramid_f = []\n    # f_i of pyramid = f_i of base + f_{i-1} of base\n    for i in range(len(extended_base_f)):\n        # Get f_i of base.
