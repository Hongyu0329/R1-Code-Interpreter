    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a step-by-step logical deduction, presented in a Python script, to determine the minimum number of stickers needed to identify any PLL case.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Establish a Theoretical Minimum:** Use information theory to calculate the absolute smallest number of observations needed to distinguish between 21 different states.\n2.  **Test the Theoretical Minimum:** I will demonstrate through a specific example that this theoretical minimum is not sufficient in practice due to the physical constraints and permutations of the cube. I'll pick a set of 3 stickers and show that they fail to distinguish between at least two different PLL cases.\n3.  **Test the Next Higher Number:** I will then add one more sticker to our set (for a total of 4) and show how this extra piece of information resolves the ambiguity from the previous step.\n4.  **Conclusion:** Conclude that 4 is the practical minimum number of stickers required.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_pll_sticker_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script determines the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers\n    needed to uniquely identify any of the 21 PLL cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Calculate the theoretical minimum using information theory.\n    print(\"### Step 1: The Theoretical Minimum ###\")\n    \n    num_pll_cases = 21\n    num_sticker_colors = 4  # Side colors: e.g., Red, Green, Orange, Blue\n    \n    # To distinguish N states with an alphabet of size C, we need at least\n    # ceil(log_C(N)) observations.\n    theoretical_min = math.ceil(math.log(num_pll_cases, num_sticker_colors))\n    \n    print(f\"There are {num_pll_cases} possible PLL cases.\")\n    print(f\"Each non-top sticker can be one of {num_sticker_colors} colors.\")\n    print(f\"The absolute minimum number of observations needed is ceil(log_{num_sticker_colors}({num_pll_cases})).\")\n    print(f\"This calculates to: {theoretical_min}\")\n    print(\"So, from a pure information theory standpoint, 3 stickers might be enough.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Test if 3 stickers are practically sufficient.\n    # We will check if we can distinguish the \"Solved\" state from the \"Ab-perm\" state\n    # using a set of 3 stickers.
