    Identifies the line numbers in triangle.py that contain errors.

    The primary issue is that the code is written with SageMath syntax (^ for power, / for rational division)
    but the example usage (`from triangle import Triangle`) invokes it as a standard Python module.
    When a .py file is imported in Sage, it is NOT run through the Sage preparser.
    Therefore, the standard Python interpreter rules apply:
    1. `^` is the bitwise XOR operator, not exponentiation (`**`).
    2. `/` is floating-point division, not exact rational division.

    This causes errors on all lines using these operators for their mathematical meaning.
