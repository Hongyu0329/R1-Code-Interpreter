    # The poem's form, a double sestina, relies on strict patterns.
    # The most significant pattern for this problem is the parallel use of
    # anaphora (repetition of a starting phrase) in corresponding stanzas.

    # Stanzas 3 & 4 use "I, that was once" two times each (2 vs 2).
    # Stanzas 7 & 8 use "Meseems" three times each (3 vs 3).
    # This establishes a pattern of symmetrical repetition.

    # The anomaly is in stanzas 5 & 6, which use the anaphora "Long since".
    # Stanza 5 (Strephon) uses it twice (lines 28, 29).
    # Stanza 6 (Klaius) uses it three times (lines 31, 34, 35).
    # This 2 vs. 3 count breaks the poem's parallel structure.

    # The problem states two lines were swapped. To preserve the sestina's
    # end-word pattern, the swapped lines must share the same end-word.
    # The swap must involve a "Long since" line from Klaius's stanza and a
    # non-"Long since" line from Strephon's stanza to explain the imbalanced count.

    # Let's identify the candidates:
    # From Strephon's stanza, line 26 does not start with "Long since" and ends with "morning":
    # 26: Hath made itself a crier of the morning,

    # From Klaius's stanza, line 34 starts with "Long since" and also ends with "morning":
    # 34: Long since I hate the night, more hate the morning;

    # These two lines form a perfect pair for a swap that would alter the anaphora count
    # while preserving the end-word scheme. Swapping them is the logical solution.

    line_one = 26
    line_two = 34

    print(f"The two swapped lines are: {line_one} and {line_two}")
