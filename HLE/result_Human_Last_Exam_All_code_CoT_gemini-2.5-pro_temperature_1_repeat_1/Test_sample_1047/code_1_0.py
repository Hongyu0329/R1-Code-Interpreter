    # The core of the issue lies in the duties owed to a former client.
    # NC LLP, as a firm, owes a duty of confidentiality and loyalty to its former client, Advanced Tech Inc.
    
    # Fact 1: NC LLP possesses highly sensitive and confidential information from Advanced Tech Inc.
    # from the 2019 litigation. This includes material contracts and financial statements.
    
    # Fact 2: NC LLP is now being asked to represent Six Wings Inc. in a matter directly adverse
    # to Advanced Tech Inc. (its acquisition). The confidential information is directly relevant to this new matter.
    
    # Fact 3: Advanced Tech Inc. explicitly does not consent to NC LLP's representation of Six Wings Inc.

    explanation = """
    The reasoning for the correct answer is as follows:

    1.  **Existence of a Conflict:** A conflict of interest exists because NC LLP holds confidential information from a former client, Advanced Tech Inc., that is directly relevant to a new matter where the firm is acting against that former client's interests. The firm's representation of Six Wings Inc. in the acquisition of Advanced Tech Inc. is a matter directly adverse to Advanced Tech Inc.

    2.  **Duty to Former Client:** A law firm's duties, particularly the duty of confidentiality, extend beyond the end of a client relationship. The firm cannot use confidential information to the detriment of a former client.

    3.  **Insufficiency of Ethical Walls Without Consent:** While NC LLP has internal screens (Option B), these measures are meant to prevent the inadvertent spread of information. They cannot, by themselves, justify taking on a new case that is directly adverse to a former client, especially when highly relevant confidential information is held. The primary remedy for a conflict is informed consent.

    4.  **The Decisive Role of Consent:** When a clear conflict of interest prejudices a former client, the firm is generally barred from acting unless the former client provides informed consent to waive the conflict. The scenario explicitly states that Advanced Tech Inc. "would not consent". This lack of consent is the critical factor that prohibits NC LLP from continuing the representation.

    Therefore, Norman and NC LLP are not allowed to represent Six Wings Inc. because the prejudiced party, Advanced Tech Inc., has not consented.
