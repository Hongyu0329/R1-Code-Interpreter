    # Part (a)
    # A group G acting quasiprimitively on a set F means every non-trivial normal subgroup of G is transitive on F.
    # The socle N is a non-trivial normal subgroup, so it must be transitive on the face set F.
    # The faces of the quotient dessin D_N are the orbits of N on F.
    # Since N is transitive, there is only one orbit, meaning D_N has one face and is unicellular.
    # This conclusion does not depend on G/N being cyclic.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b) and (c)
    # A smooth covering implies the generators of G have the same orders as their images in G/N.
    #
    # Type TW: G = T wr Z_l, N = T^l, G/N = Z_l. The generators of G must have orders dividing l.
    # For l <= 5, l is prime. The generators must have order l.
    # G is generated by two elements of prime order l. A theorem by Lucchini states that for such a group
    # with a unique minimal normal subgroup N, N must be abelian or simple.
    # N = T^l is neither abelian nor simple, a contradiction. Thus, type TW is not possible for smooth coverings.
    # This makes the statement in (c) True.
    #
    # Type HA: N is abelian. Lucchini's theorem does not create a contradiction. This type is possible.
    # Type AS: N is simple. Lucchini's theorem does not create a contradiction. This type is possible.
