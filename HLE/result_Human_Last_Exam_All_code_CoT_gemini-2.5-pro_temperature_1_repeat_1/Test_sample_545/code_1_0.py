    This function determines the IUPAC name of the final product from a two-step

    Step 1: The sulfoxide ((2-((2-methylbut-3-en-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)sulfinyl)benzene
              undergoes thermal elimination to yield an allyl vinyl ether intermediate.

    Step 2: This intermediate undergoes a [3,3]-Claisen rearrangement at high
              temperature to form a gamma,delta-unsaturated aldehyde.
              The structure of this final product is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH2-CHO.
