# Define the given parameters

s = 0.12  # Support of the discriminatory pattern

# Step 1: Calculate the evidence for the violation
# This is the confidence weighted by the support.

# This is the counter-evidence confidence weighted by the structural artifact likelihood.

# Step 3: Calculate the minimum ratio of evidence (E_r)
E_r = evidence_for_violation / evidence_against_violation

# Step 4: Print the calculation step-by-step as requested
