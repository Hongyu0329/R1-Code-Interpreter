    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is a plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python code to execute the plan.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Board and Pieces:** The problem is set on a standard 8x8 chessboard. We are only concerned with the **edge squares**. Bishops are pieces that attack along diagonals. A key rule is that bishops always stay on squares of the same color.\n\n2.  **Count the Edge Squares:** An 8x8 board has 64 squares. The \"inner\" board is 6x6, containing 36 squares. The number of edge squares is the total minus the inner squares: 64 - 36 = 28.\n\n3.  **Separate by Color:** Since bishops on white squares can't attack bishops on black squares, we can solve the problem for each color independently and then combine the results. Of the 28 edge squares, 14 are white and 14 are black.\n\n4.  **Model as a Graph Problem:** For each color set (white or black), we want to place the maximum number of non-attacking bishops. This is a classic graph theory problem called the **Maximum Independent Set (MIS)**.\n    *   Let each of the 14 squares of a color be a \"node\" in a graph.\n    *   Draw an \"edge\" between two nodes if a bishop on one square can attack the other.\n    *   The MIS is the largest set of nodes where no two nodes are connected by an edge. This corresponds to the maximum number of bishops we can place.\n\n5.  **Solve for MIS:**\n    *   We can find the connected components of the graph. The total MIS is the sum of the MIS of each component.\n    *   For this specific problem, the components turn out to be simple structures (mostly paths).\n    *   The MIS for a path of `n` nodes is `ceil(n/2)`.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Answer:**\n    *   Calculate the max bishops for the 14 white squares.\n    *   Calculate the max bishops for the 14 black squares.\n    *   Add these two numbers together to get the total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge.\n    *   Subtract this total from the 28 available edge squares to find how many squares remain empty.\n\nThe Python code below implements this plan to calculate the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_max_bishops_for_color(squares):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of non-attacking bishops on a given set of squares of the same color.\n    This is done by finding the Maximum Independent Set of the attack graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_squares = len(squares)\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(num_squares)]\n\n    # Build the adjacency list for the attack graph.\n    # An edge exists if two squares are on the same diagonal.\n    for i in range(num_squares):\n        for j in range(i + 1, num_squares):\n            sq1_r, sq1_c = squares[i]\n            sq2_r, sq2_c = squares[j]\n            if abs(sq1_r - sq2_r) == abs(sq1_c - sq2_c):\n                adj[i].append(j)\n                adj[j].append(i)\n\n    # Find the connected components of the graph and sum their MIS sizes.\n    total_max_bishops = 0\n    visited = [False] * num_squares\n    for i in range(num_squares):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            component_nodes = []\n            queue = [i]\n            visited[i] = True\n            head = 0\n            while head < len(queue):\n                u = queue[head]\n                head += 1\n                component_nodes.append(u)\n                for v in adj[u]:\n                    if not visited[v]:\n                        visited[v] = True\n                        queue.append(v)\n            \n            # For this problem's specific geometry, all components are simple paths.\n            # The MIS of a path with n nodes is ceil(n/2).\n            component_size = len(component_nodes)\n            total_max_bishops += math.ceil(component_size / 2.0)\n            \n    return total_max_bishops\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n\n# 1.
