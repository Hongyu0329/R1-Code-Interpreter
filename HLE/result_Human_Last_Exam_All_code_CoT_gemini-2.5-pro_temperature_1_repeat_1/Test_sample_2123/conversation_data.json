    "This is a classic linguistic riddle. The solution relies on a pun that works in the Russian language. Here is my plan to solve it:\n\n1.  **Identify the location:** The riddle mentions the \"wide boulevards of Vienna\". The most famous of these is the Ringstrasse (\"Ring Street\").\n2.  **Translate the key term:** The German word \"Ring\" translates to \"кольцо\" (kol'tso) in Russian. The adjectival form, which would be used to describe a boulevard, is \"кольцевой\" (kol'tsevoy).\n3.  **Find the pun:** We need to find an English poet whose surname, when transliterated into Russian, sounds very similar to \"кольцевой\".\n4.  **Identify the poet:** The surname of the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge is transliterated into Russian as \"Кольридж\" (Kol'ridzh). The similarity between \"Кольцевой\" and \"Кольридж\" is the basis of the pun.\n\nThe following Python script demonstrates this logic.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the steps to solve the riddle about the\n    English poet mentioned in a Russian text about Vienna.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the famous boulevard in Vienna.\n    vienna_boulevard = \"Ringstrasse\"\n    print(f\"Step 1: The famous wide boulevard in Vienna is the '{vienna_boulevard}'.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Translate the key part of the name into Russian.\n    german_word = \"Ring\"\n    russian_equivalent_adjective = \"Кольцевой\"\n    russian_pronunciation = \"Koltsevoy\"\n    print(f\"Step 2: The German word '{german_word}' in '{vienna_boulevard}' corresponds to the Russian adjective '{russian_equivalent_adjective}' (pronounced roughly as '{russian_pronunciation}').\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the English poet whose name creates a pun in Russian.\n    poet_surname_english = \"Coleridge\"\n    poet_surname_russian = \"Кольридж\"\n    poet_pronunciation = \"Kol'ridzh\"\n    print(f\"Step 3: The surname of the English poet '{poet_surname_english}' is transliterated into Russian as '{poet_surname_russian}' (pronounced roughly as '{poet_pronunciation}').\")\n\n    # Step 4: Explain the pun and provide the final answer.\n    print(f\"Step 4: The pun is based on the phonetic similarity between the word for the 'Ring' boulevard ('{russian_equivalent_adjective}') and the poet's surname ('{poet_surname_russian}').\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the surname is:\")\n    print(poet_surname_english)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n```\n<<<Coleridge>>>"
