    "The reaction in question is a Diels-Alder reaction, a type of [4+2] cycloaddition. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the product:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and their Roles**: The first reactant is buta-1,3-diene (CH2=CH-CH=CH2), which is a conjugated diene. The second reactant is 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene (CCl2=CF2), which is an alkene and will act as the dienophile.\n2.  **Determine the Reaction Mechanism**: In a Diels-Alder reaction, the four pi electrons of the diene and the two pi electrons of the dienophile react in a concerted fashion to form a new six-membered ring.\n3.  **Predict the Product's Structure**: The reaction forms a cyclohexene ring. New single bonds are formed between carbon-1 of butadiene and one carbon of the ethene's double bond, and between carbon-4 of butadiene and the other carbon of the ethene's double bond. The double bond in butadiene shifts to be between carbon-2 and carbon-3. The double bond in the ethene becomes a single bond. This results in a cyclohexene ring substituted with two chlorine atoms on one carbon and two fluorine atoms on an adjacent carbon.\n4.  **Name the Product**: Following IUPAC nomenclature, we number the cyclohexene ring to give the double bond the lowest possible locants (1 and 2). Then, we number the substituents to give them the lowest possible locants. \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically, so it gets the lower number. The resulting name is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohex-1-ene.\n5.  **Formulate the Chemical Equation**: We can represent the reaction by the chemical formulas of the reactants and products.\n    *   Butadiene: C4H6\n    *   1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene: C2Cl2F2\n    *   Product: The formula is the sum of the reactants' atoms, C(4+2)H6Cl2F2 = C6H6Cl2F2.\n\nThe following Python code will define the reactants, determine the product, and print the full reaction equation.\n\n```python\ndef get_diels_alder_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the product of the Diels-Alder reaction between butadiene and\n    1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene and prints the reaction equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function to format a chemical formula from a dictionary of atoms\n    def format_formula(formula_dict):\n        # Standard order for organic compounds: C, H, then others alphabetically\n        elements = ['C', 'H'] + sorted([el for el in formula_dict if el not in ['C', 'H']])\n        formula_str = \"\"\n        for el in elements:\n            if el in formula_dict:\n                count = formula_dict[el]\n                formula_str += el\n                if count > 1:\n                    formula_str += str(count)\n        return formula_str\n\n    # 1.
