    "To solve this problem, we need to find the minimum possible number of isometric embeddings from a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$. Let's denote the number of such embeddings for a given pair $(X, B)$ as $N(X, B)$. We are looking for the minimum value of $N(X, B)$ over all possible choices of $X$ and $B$, with the assumption that at least one embedding exists.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking:\n\n1.  **Analyze the components:**\n    *   **Finite ultrametric space $X$**: A finite set with a distance function $d$ satisfying the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n    *   **Banach space $B$**: A complete normed vector space. The problem does not specify the underlying field, nor does it forbid trivial cases.\n    *   **Isometric embedding**: A function $f: X \\to B$ such that for all $x, y \\in X$, the norm of the difference in $B$ equals the distance in $X$: $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$.\n\n2.  **Explore the number of embeddings:**\n    *   Let's assume an isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists.\n    *   Consider transformations on $B$ that preserve distances. For any vector $v_0 \\in B$, the translation map $T_{v_0}(v) = v + v_0$ is an isometry of the metric space structure of $B$.\n    *   If $f$ is an isometric embedding, then the composite function $g(x) = f(x) + v_0$ is also an isometric embedding, because $\\|g(x) - g(y)\\|_B = \\|(f(x) + v_0) - (f(y) + v_0)\\|_B = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|_B = d(x, y)$.\n    *   If $B$ is a non-trivial Banach space (i.e., $B \\neq \\{0\\}$), then it contains a non-zero vector $v_0$. The function $g$ will be different from $f$ (since $g(x) = f(x) + v_0 \\neq f(x)$).\n    *   If $B$ is a typical Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$ (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}^n$), its cardinality $K$ is infinite. This would mean there are infinitely many embeddings. To find a small integer as an answer, we must be able to consider \"smaller\" Banach spaces.\n    *   Banach spaces can be defined over finite fields if a proper norm is used. For example, any vector space over a finite field $F_q$ equipped with the trivial norm ($\\|v\\|=1$ for $v \\neq 0$, $\\|0\\|=0$) is a finite Banach space.\n\n3.  **Search for the minimum:**\n    *   To find the *smallest possible* number, we should examine the simplest, most minimal cases for $X$ and $B$. Unspecified conditions usually mean we can include trivial cases.\n    *   **Case 1: Non-trivial spaces.** If we assume $X$ has at least two points and $B$ is non-trivial, then $|B| \\ge 2$. The number of embeddings must be at least 2, as shown by the translation argument. For example, for $X=\\{x_1, x_2\\}$ with $d(x_1, x_2)=1$ and the 2-element Banach space $B=F_2$ (the field of two elements, with the trivial norm), we can find exactly two embeddings: $f_1(x_1)=0, f_1(x_2)=1$ and $f_2(x_1)=1, f_2(x_2)=0$. So, 2 is a possible number.\n    *   **Case 2: Trivial spaces are allowed.** Let's consider the most basic spaces possible.\n        *   The simplest finite ultrametric space is a **single-point space**, say $X = \\{p_0\\}$. Its distance function is necessarily $d(p_0, p_0) = 0$. This trivially satisfies the ultrametric property.\n        *   The simplest Banach space is the **zero vector space**, $B = \\{0\\}$. Its norm is necessarily $\\|0\\| = 0$. It is a complete normed vector space.\n    *   Now, let's count the number of isometric embeddings from $X=\\{p_0\\}$ to $B=\\{0\\}$.\n        *   There is only one possible function from a one-element set to a one-element set: $f(p_0) = 0$.\n        *   We must check if this function is an isometric embedding. The condition is $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\| = d(x, y)$.\n        *   For $x=p_0$ and $y=p_0$, the condition becomes $\\|f(p_0) - f(p_0)\\| = d(p_0, p_0)$.\n        *   Substituting the values, we get $\\|0 - 0\\| = 0$, which simplifies to $\\|0\\| = 0$, and finally $0 = 0$.\n        *   The condition holds. Therefore, this function is an isometric embedding.\n        *   Since it's the only possible function, there is exactly **1** isometric embedding in this case.\n\n4.  **Conclusion:**\n    We have found an example of a finite ultrametric space $X$ and a Banach space $B$ for which there is exactly one isometric embedding. Since the number of embeddings must be a positive integer (as we assume existence), the smallest possible number cannot be less than 1. Therefore, the smallest possible number is 1.\n\nThe following Python code demonstrates this minimal case.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\n# This script demonstrates that it is possible to have exactly one\n# isometric embedding, which makes it the smallest possible number.\n\n# Plan:\n# 1.
