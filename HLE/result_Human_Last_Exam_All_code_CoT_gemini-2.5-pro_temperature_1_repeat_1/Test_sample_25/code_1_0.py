    This function determines which of the listed loss functions are HALOs.
    Based on the analysis:
    - CSFT is not a HALO because it lacks a reference model (pi_ref).
    - DPO is a HALO. Its objective maximizes a concave value function of the reward advantage.
    - KTO is a HALO. It can be formulated with a value function `v` that meets the required properties.
    - PPO-Clip is a HALO. Its objective can be mapped to the HALO structure with a concave value function for gains.
    - SLiC is a HALO. It is a variant of DPO and shares the same core principles.
