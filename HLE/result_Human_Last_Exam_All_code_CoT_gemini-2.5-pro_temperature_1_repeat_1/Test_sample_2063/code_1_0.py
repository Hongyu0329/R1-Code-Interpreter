    Calculates the limiting probability P(n) as n -> infinity.

    The problem states that for a DNA sequence of length n with 8 bases,
    a function f(x) = (count of base x) mod 8 is defined. The process fails
    if f(x) = x for any x in {0, 1, ..., 7}.

    Our analysis shows that for a very long random sequence (n -> infinity),
    the probability that the count of a specific base x (c_x) modulo 8 is equal to x
    approaches 1/8.
    P(c_x mod 8 = x) -> 1/8.

    Therefore, the probability of success for a single base (c_x mod 8 != x)
    is 1 - 1/8 = 7/8.

    Since there are 8 bases and their count distributions become independent in the
    limit for this property, the total probability of success is the product
    of the individual success probabilities.
