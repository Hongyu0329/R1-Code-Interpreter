    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of orbits of the set of quadratic forms in two variables over the ring $R = \\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ under the action of the group of invertible linear transformations $GL_2(R)$.\n\nA quadratic form is a polynomial $Q(x, y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ where $a, b, c \\in R$.\nA linear transformation is given by a matrix $T = \\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\\\ r & s \\end{pmatrix}$ with entries in $R$. The transformation is invertible if its determinant, $\\det(T) = ps - qr$, is a unit in $R$. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$ are $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\nThe action of $T$ on a quadratic form $Q$ results in a new form $Q'(x, y) = Q(px+qy, rx+sy)$.\nThe coefficients of the new form $(a', b', c')$ are related to the old ones $(a, b, c)$ by the following formulas:\n$a' = (ap^2 + bpr + cr^2) \\pmod 8$\n$b' = (2apq + b(ps+qr) + 2crs) \\pmod 8$\n$c' = (aq^2 + bqs + cs^2) \\pmod 8$\n\nTwo forms are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by such an invertible linear transformation. The problem is to count the number of such equivalence classes (orbits).\n\nA direct computational approach is feasible. We can represent each quadratic form as a tuple `(a, b, c)`. We will generate all possible forms and all possible invertible matrices. Then, starting with an unclassified form, we can find its entire equivalence class by applying all invertible matrices to it. We repeat this process until all forms are classified.\n\nHere is the plan for the Python code:\n1.  Generate all $8^3 = 512$ quadratic forms $(a, b, c)$ over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$.\n2.  Generate all invertible $2 \\times 2$ matrices over $\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}$. A matrix is invertible if its determinant is in $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$.\n3.  Implement a function for the group action that transforms a form's coefficients based on a given matrix.\n4.  Use a data structure (like a set or a dictionary) to keep track of visited/classified forms.\n5.  Iterate through all forms. If a form hasn't been classified yet, increment the class counter and perform a search (like Breadth-First Search) starting from this form to find all forms in its orbit. Mark all forms in the orbit as classified.\n6.  The final count of classes will be the answer.\n\nThis method systematically explores the orbits and guarantees counting each class exactly once.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef count_equivalence_classes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of equivalence classes of quadratic forms in two\n    variables over the ring Z/8Z.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The ring is Z/8Z, so we work with numbers modulo 8\n    N = 8\n    \n    # 1.
