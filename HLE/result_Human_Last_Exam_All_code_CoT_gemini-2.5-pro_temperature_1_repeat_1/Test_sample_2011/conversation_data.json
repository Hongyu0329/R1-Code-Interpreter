    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of different clique sizes that can appear as induced subgraphs in a single graph with `n = 128` vertices.\n\n### Plan and Reasoning\n\n1.  **Define the Goal:** Let `G` be a graph on `n=128` vertices. We are looking for the maximum possible number of distinct integers `k` such that `G` has an induced subgraph that is a clique of size `k` (denoted `K_k`).\n\n2.  **Analyze the Set of Induced Clique Sizes:** Let `C(G)` be the set of all possible induced clique sizes for a given graph `G`. Let `p_max` be the size of the largest induced clique in `G`.\n    *   By definition, any induced clique size `k` in `G` must satisfy `k <= p_max`.\n    *   Now, consider the largest induced clique in `G`, which has size `p_max`. Let the set of vertices forming this clique be `V_pmax`.\n    *   Any subset of `V_pmax` with `k` vertices (where `1 <= k <= p_max`) will also form an induced clique. This is because all vertices in `V_pmax` are mutually connected, so all vertices in any of its subsets are also mutually connected.\n    *   This crucial insight means that if a graph has an induced clique of size `p_max`, it must also have induced cliques of all sizes from 1 to `p_max`.\n    *   Therefore, the set of induced clique sizes for any graph `G` is exactly `{1, 2, ..., p_max}`. The number of different sizes is simply `p_max`.\n\n3.  **Reframe the Problem:** The problem is now equivalent to finding the maximum possible value of `p_max` (the size of the largest induced clique) for a graph with 128 vertices.\n\n4.  **Find the Maximum `p_max`:**\n    *   The size of any clique in a graph cannot exceed the total number of vertices. For a graph with `n=128` vertices, `p_max <= 128`.\n    *   To show that the maximum is 128, we must demonstrate that a graph exists for which `p_max = 128`.\n    *   Consider the complete graph `G = K_128`. In this graph, all 128 vertices are connected to each other, forming a clique of size 128. Since this is the entire graph, it is also an induced clique.\n    *   For `G = K_128`, the size of the largest induced clique is `p_max = 128`.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is 128, achieved by the complete graph `K_128`.\n\nThe following Python code formalizes this reasoning and provides the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_clique_sizes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the maximum possible number of different clique sizes\n    in a graph with n=128 vertices.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The number of vertices in the graph.\n    n = 128\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Understand the problem.\")\n    print(f\"We have a graph G with n = {n} vertices.\")\n    print(\"We want to find the maximum number of different sizes k, where a clique of size k (K_k) is an induced subgraph of G.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the properties of induced cliques.\")\n    print(\"Let p_max be the size of the largest induced clique in G.\")\n    print(\"If a graph has an induced clique of size p_max on a set of vertices Vp, then any subset of Vp of size k (for 1 <= k <= p_max) also forms an induced clique.\")\n    print(\"This means that the set of all induced clique sizes in G is precisely {1, 2, ..., p_max}.\")\n    print(\"The number of different sizes is therefore equal to p_max.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Reframe the problem.\")\n    print(\"The problem is now to find the maximum possible value of p_max for a graph with n vertices.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    \n    print(\"Step 4: Find the maximum possible value of p_max.\")\n    print(\"The size of any clique cannot be larger than the total number of vertices in the graph.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, p_max <= n, which means p_max <= {n}.\")\n    print(\"\\nTo show this maximum is achievable, consider the complete graph K_n (K_128).\")\n    print(f\"In K_{n}, the entire set of {n} vertices forms an induced clique.\")\n    print(f\"For this graph, p_max = {n}.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 5: Final Conclusion and Equation.\")\n    print(\"The maximum possible number of different clique sizes is the maximum possible value of p_max.\")\n    \n    # Final equation: MaxCliqueSizes = max(p_max) = n\n    max_sizes = n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"Maximum_Number_of_Sizes = n = {n}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe final answer is:\")\n    print(max_sizes)\n\nsolve_clique_sizes()\n```\n<<<128>>>"
