    Analyzes the medical case and determines the best course of action.

    The patient has undergone heart valve surgery. A primary and severe risk
    after this procedure is the formation of blood clots (thrombosis) on the new
    valve, which can lead to life-threatening events like a stroke or pulmonary
    embolism.

    Therefore, the most critical preventative action is to prescribe
    anticoagulant medication to prevent these thrombotic events. This is the
    standard of care. Other options like physical therapy, diet, and pain
    management are important but secondary to preventing this immediate, high-risk
    complication.
