    Identifies and lists the San Francisco November 2024 propositions
    that could be nullified by a competing measure.

    Based on the official ballot information, there are two pairs of competing measures:
    1. Prop J vs. Prop K (Police Staffing)
    2. Prop L vs. Prop M (Public Safety Technology)

    If both propositions in a pair pass, the one with fewer 'yes' votes is nullified.
    Therefore, all four are on the list of propositions that could be nullified.
