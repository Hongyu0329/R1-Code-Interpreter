print(f"Based on the legal analysis of the scenario, the correct answer is A.")
print("Here's a breakdown of why:")
print("1) Bryan's Covenants: Enforceable. They are tied to the sale of a business where he was a vendor and CEO, making the restrictions reasonable to protect the purchased goodwill.")
print("2) Ryan's Covenants: Not Enforceable. Despite also being a vendor, his role as a non-executive Shift Manager makes the broad restrictions unreasonable and an unfair restraint of trade.")
print("3) New Employees' Agreements: The non-competition clauses are unenforceable under Ontario law, but the rest of the agreements would be considered valid and severable.")
print("4) The Pickup Truck: Bryan's promise was a gratuitous promise (a gift) made without consideration from Stan, making it legally unenforceable.")
