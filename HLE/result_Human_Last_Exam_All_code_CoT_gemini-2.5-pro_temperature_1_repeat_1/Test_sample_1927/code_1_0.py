# The number of nodes required at each level of the Kripke model structure is determined by the nesting of the logical formula.

# The root node is where the formula is falsified.
root_node = 1

# Falsifying the outer implication requires creating a countermodel for the subformula P1,
# which necessitates two distinct successor nodes.
level_1_nodes = 2

# For the main implication to hold, each of the level 1 nodes must in turn be a root
# of a countermodel for the subformula P0. Each of these requires two distinct successors.
level_2_nodes = 2 * 2

# The total number of nodes is the sum of nodes at all levels.
total_nodes = root_node + level_1_nodes + level_2_nodes
