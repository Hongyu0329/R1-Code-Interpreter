    "This problem asks for the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the divisor poset on the set of integers `{1, 2, ..., N}` where `N = 823564528378596`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Interpret the Problem**: According to a fundamental result in combinatorics known as Greene's Theorem, the maximum size of a union of `k` antichains in a poset is equal to the maximum sum of the sizes of `k` disjoint chains. In this case, `k=20`.\n\n2.  **Identify Optimal Chains**: We need to find 20 disjoint chains in the divisor poset on `{1, ..., N}` whose total length is maximized. Any integer `n` can be uniquely represented as `n = m * 2^p`, where `m` is an odd number. This allows us to partition the entire set `{1, ..., N}` into disjoint chains of the form `C_m = {m, 2*m, 4*m, ...}` for every odd number `m <= N`. To maximize the sum of lengths of 20 disjoint chains, we should choose the 20 longest chains from this partition.\n\n3.  **Find the Longest Chains**: The length of a chain `C_m` is determined by the largest power of 2, say `2^p`, such that `m * 2^p <= N`. The length of this chain is `p+1`. To get the longest chains, we need to choose the smallest possible odd numbers for `m`, as a smaller `m` allows for a larger `p`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Total Size**: We will select the chains corresponding to the first 20 odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, ..., 39. For each of these odd numbers `m`, we calculate the length of its chain `C_m`. The final answer is the sum of these 20 lengths. The length of the chain starting with an odd number `x` can be calculated efficiently in Python using `(N // x).bit_length()`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of 20 antichains in the\n    divisor poset on {1, 2, ..., N}.\n    \n    This is equivalent to finding the maximum sum of the lengths of 20\n    disjoint chains.
