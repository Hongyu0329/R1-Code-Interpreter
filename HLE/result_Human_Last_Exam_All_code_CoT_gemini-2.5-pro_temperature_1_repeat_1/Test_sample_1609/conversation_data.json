    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of `n` variables, denoted as `a(n)`, is given by the central binomial coefficient. The formula is `a(n) = C(n, floor(n/2))`, where `C(n, k)` is \"n choose k\".\n2.  **Apply to the Specific Case:** For `n=4`, we need to calculate `a(4)`. Using the formula, this becomes `a(4) = C(4, floor(4/2)) = C(4, 2)`.\n3.  **Calculate the Value:** The binomial coefficient `C(4, 2)` is calculated as `4! / (2! * (4-2)!)`.\n4.  **Code Implementation:** A Python script will be written to perform this calculation and print out each step of the equation, showing how the final result is obtained.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate `a(4)`:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The number of variables in the Boolean function\nn = 4\n\n# For a(n), k is the floor of n/2\nk = math.floor(n / 2)\n\n# Calculate the components of the binomial coefficient formula C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n-k)!)\nn_factorial = math.factorial(n)\nk_factorial = math.factorial(k)\nn_minus_k_val = n - k\nn_minus_k_factorial = math.factorial(n_minus_k_val)\n\n# Calculate the final result\nresult = n_factorial // (k_factorial * n_minus_k_factorial)\n\n# Print the step-by-step calculation\nprint(f\"The maximal number of prime implicants, a(n), for a Boolean function of n variables is C(n, floor(n/2)).\")\nprint(f\"For n = {n}, we need to calculate a({n}) = C({n}, {k}).\\n\")\nprint(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = C({n}, {k}) = {n}! / ({k}! * ({n}-{k})!)\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {n_factorial} / ({k_factorial} * {n_minus_k_factorial})\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {n_factorial} / ({k_factorial * n_minus_k_factorial})\")\nprint(f\"a({n}) = {result}\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
