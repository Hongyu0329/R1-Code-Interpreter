    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to design the deadbeat observer:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **System Analysis**: The given system is a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system because the output matrix `C` has two rows. Designing observers for MIMO systems directly can be complex.\n2.  **Simplification to SISO**: I will check if the system is observable using only one of the two outputs. If it is, the problem simplifies to designing an observer for a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system. I'll test the observability using the second output, which corresponds to the second row of matrix `C`. Let's call this new output matrix `C_siso`.\n3.  **Observability Check**: To confirm this simplification is valid, I will construct the observability matrix for the pair `(A, C_siso)` and verify that it has full rank (rank 4).\n4.  **Deadbeat Observer Requirement**: The goal is to make the observation error zero in the shortest possible time. This is a \"deadbeat\" observer. For such an observer, all the eigenvalues of the error dynamics matrix, `(A - LC)`, must be placed at the origin (i.e., equal to zero).\n5.  **Ackermann's Formula**: For the simplified SISO system, I can use Ackermann's formula to find the observer gain vector `l`. This formula directly calculates the gain required to place the observer poles at the desired locations (all at zero). The formula is:\n    `l = p(A) * inv(O) * [0, 0, ..., 1]^T`\n    where `p(A)` is the desired characteristic polynomial evaluated at matrix `A` (for a deadbeat observer, this is `A^n`), and `O` is the observability matrix of the `(A, C_siso)` system.\n6.  **Construct Final Gain Matrix**: The calculated gain `l` is a 4x1 vector. Since it was designed using only the second output, the final 4x2 observer gain matrix `L` will have a column of zeros for the first output and the calculated vector `l` for the second output.\n7.  **Implementation**: I will use Python with the `numpy` library to perform the necessary matrix calculations (powers, inverse, multiplication) reliably and print the resulting gain matrix `L`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute the plan:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Set print options for better readability of the matrix\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)\n\n# Define the system matrices from the problem description\nA = np.array([[-1, 0, 0, 1],\n              [1, 0, 0, 2],\n              [0, 1, 0, -1],\n              [-1, 0, 1, -1]])\n\nC = np.array([[1, 0, 0, 0],\n              [1, 0, 0, 1]])\n\nn = A.shape[0] # Dimension of the state space\n\n# --- Step 1 & 2: Simplify to SISO and check observability ---\n# We hypothesize that the system is observable using only the second output.\n# C_siso corresponds to the second row of C.\nC_siso = C[1, :].reshape(1, n)\n\n# Construct the observability matrix for the (A, C_siso) pair\n# O = [C_siso; C_siso*A; C_siso*A^2; C_siso*A^3]\nO_siso = np.vstack([C_siso @ np.linalg.matrix_power(A, i) for i in range(n)])\n\n# Check if the rank is full, which means the system (A, C_siso) is observable.\nif np.linalg.matrix_rank(O_siso) < n:\n    print(\"The system is not observable with only the second output.
