    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to answer your question:\n\n1.  I will first identify the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that enumerates the names of the 25 prophets mentioned in the Quran.\n2.  I will determine the starting verse number (bayt) and the ending verse number for this list.\n3.  Finally, I will create a Python script that stores these two numbers and prints them in a clear, descriptive sentence, fulfilling the request to output each number.\n\nHere is the Python code to display the answer:\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt)\n    in 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' that list the names of the prophets.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The verse that introduces the list is bayt 25.\n    # The list of prophets begins in the very next verse.\n    start_bayt = 26\n\n    # The list of 25 prophets concludes five verses later.\n    end_bayt = 30\n\n    print(\"In Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi's poem, 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam', the names of the prophets are mentioned from bayt:\")\n    print(start_bayt)\n    print(\"to bayt:\")\n    print(end_bayt)\n\nfind_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<26 to 30>>>"
