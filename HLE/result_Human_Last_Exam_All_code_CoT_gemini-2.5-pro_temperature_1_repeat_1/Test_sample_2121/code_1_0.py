# The problem is to evaluate the integral of 1/(x(0;τ) + y(0;τ) + z(0;τ)) with respect to τ from 0 to infinity.
# Through analysis of the system of differential equations and applying the boundary conditions,
# the quantity x(0;τ) + y(0;τ) + z(0;τ) can be found.
# Let S(τ) = x(0;τ) + y(0;τ) + z(0;τ). The derivation shows that:
# S(τ) = (3/4) * exp(2*τ^2) + 1/4

# The integral we need to compute is:
# I = ∫[0, inf] 1 / S(τ) dτ = ∫[0, inf] 1 / ((3/4) * exp(2*τ^2) + 1/4) dτ
# I = ∫[0, inf] 4 / (3 * exp(2*τ^2) + 1) dτ
