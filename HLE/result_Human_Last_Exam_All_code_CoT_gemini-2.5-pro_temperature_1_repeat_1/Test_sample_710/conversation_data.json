    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Set of Numbers**: The numbers are of the form $s_n = 2n^2+3n+1$ for positive integers $n$. I'll first factor this expression to better understand the series. It simplifies to $s_n = (n+1)(2n+1)$.\n2.  **Generate the Numbers**: I will generate the first few numbers in this set:\n    *   $s_1 = (1+1)(2 \\cdot 1+1) = 6$\n    *   $s_2 = (2+1)(2 \\cdot 2+1) = 15$\n    *   $s_3 = (3+1)(2 \\cdot 3+1) = 28$\n    *   and so on.\n3.  **Find All Reachable Sums**: The problem asks for sums of *distinct* numbers from this set. This is a variation of the change-making problem. I will use a dynamic programming approach to determine all possible sums up to a certain limit.\n    *   I'll create a boolean array, `is_reachable`, where `is_reachable[k]` will be `True` if the number `k` can be formed as a sum of distinct generators, and `False` otherwise.\n    *   I'll initialize `is_reachable[0]` to `True`.\n    *   For each generator `s` from our set, I will iterate through the `is_reachable` array and update it. For any number `j` that is already reachable, the new number `j + s` also becomes reachable.\n4.  **Determine the Threshold N**: After filling the `is_reachable` array up to a sufficiently high limit, I will find the largest number `L` for which `is_reachable[L]` is `False`. The number `N` we are looking for will be `L + 1`, as any number greater than or equal to `N` is expected to be reachable.\n5.  **Demonstrate the Result**: To confirm the result, I will not only find `N`, but also show the decomposition for a few numbers greater than or equal to `N` into sums of distinct terms from the set. For example, I will show the equations for `N`, `N+1`, `N+2`, and `N+3`.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines the smallest number N such that any number >= N can be written\n    as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 2n^2+3n+1.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The upper limit for our search.
