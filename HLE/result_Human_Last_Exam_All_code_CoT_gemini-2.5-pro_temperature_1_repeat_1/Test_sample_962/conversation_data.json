    "Of course. I will design a tightly secure t-out-of-n threshold signature scheme with a two-round signing protocol and provide a Python implementation to demonstrate its core logic.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Choice of Scheme**: I will implement the **Threshold BLS (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham) signature scheme**. This scheme is an excellent choice because:\n    *   **Tight Security**: It is provably secure with a tight reduction to the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in pairing-friendly groups.\n    *   **Efficiency**: The signing protocol is non-interactive among the signers. Each signer can produce their partial signature independently. This can be viewed as a one-round protocol (broadcast) or a two-round protocol (request/response), perfectly fitting your requirement.\n    *   **Simplicity**: The underlying mathematics are elegant and easier to demonstrate than more complex schemes like FROST or threshold ECDSA.\n\n2.  **Protocol Simulation**: My Python code will simulate the entire process:\n    *   **Setup**: Define the parameters for a cryptographic group (using modular arithmetic for simplicity), including the total number of parties `n` and the threshold `t`.\n    *   **Distributed Key Generation (DKG)**: A trusted dealer will be simulated to create a secret polynomial and distribute secret key shares to all `n` parties. This establishes the shared public key.\n    *   **Signing (Two Rounds)**:\n        *   **Round 1**: An aggregator requests a signature on a message from a subset of `t` participants.\n        *   **Round 2**: Each of the `t` participants computes a partial signature using their secret share and sends it back.\n    *   **Aggregation**: The aggregator combines the `t` partial signatures into a single, final signature using Lagrange interpolation.\n    *   **Verification**: Finally, the code will verify that the aggregated signature is valid against the shared public key.\n\nHere is the Python code demonstrating the Threshold BLS scheme.\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport hashlib\n\n# Step 1: Setup\n# We simulate a cryptographic group using modular arithmetic.\n# In a real implementation, this would be an elliptic curve group with a pairing.\n# q is the order of the group, p is the prime field modulus.\nq = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663\np = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935\ng = 2 # A generator of the group\n\n# n-out-of-t threshold scheme parameters\nn = 5 # Total number of parties\nt = 3 # Threshold required to sign\n\ndef extended_gcd(a, b):\n    \"\"\"Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find modular inverse.\"\"\"\n    if a == 0:\n        return b, 0, 1\n    d, x1, y1 = extended_gcd(b % a, a)\n    x = y1 -
