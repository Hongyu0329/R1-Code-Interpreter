# In the algebraic representation, we work in a quotient ring where any polynomial
# can be reduced to a canonical form. We need to find the number of these forms.

# The relation t_x^2 = 1 + t_x means that any power of t_x can be reduced to a
# linear combination of 1 and t_x. So, the basis for the x-dimension has 2 elements.
dim_x = 2

# Similarly, for the y-dimension, the basis has 2 elements (1, t_y).
dim_y = 2

# The basis for the entire ring is the tensor product of the individual bases,
# which is {1, t_x, t_y, t_x*t_y}. The total dimension of this space is the
# product of the individual dimensions.
total_dim = dim_x * dim_y

# The coefficients for each basis element are from the field F_2, which has 2 elements ({0, 1}).
# The total number of unique canonical forms is 2 raised to the power of the total dimension.
# This number is the number of equivalence classes.
num_coefficients = 2
num_classes = num_coefficients ** total_dim

# We print the components of the final calculation as requested.
print("The number of basis elements for the x-dimension is:", dim_x)
print("The number of basis elements for the y-dimension is:", dim_y)
print("The total dimension of the canonical form space is:", total_dim)
print("The number of possible coefficients (from F_2) is:", num_coefficients)

# The final equation gives the total number of equivalence classes.
print(f"The calculation for the number of classes is: {num_coefficients}^{total_dim} = {num_classes}")
