    "Of the 17 wallpaper groups, each is associated with a 2D crystallographic point group. The order of a group is the number of its symmetry operations. We need to find the wallpaper groups whose associated point group has an order of 2.\n\nThe two 2D crystallographic point groups of order 2 are:\n1.  **C2 (or 2):** This group contains two rotations (0° and 180°).\n2.  **D1 (or m):** This group contains an identity operation and a single reflection.\n\nThe Python code below will list all 17 wallpaper groups with their point group information, filter for those with a point group of order 2, and then sum the counts to find the total number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wallpaper_group_count():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of wallpaper groups\n    with a point group of order 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Data structure: (Wallpaper Group Name, Point Group Name, Point Group Order)\n    wallpaper_groups_data = [\n        ('p1', 'C1', 1),\n        ('p2', 'C2', 2),\n        ('pm', 'D1', 2),\n        ('pg', 'D1', 2),\n        ('cm', 'D1', 2),\n        ('p2mm', 'D2', 4),\n        ('p2mg', 'D2', 4),\n        ('p2gg', 'D2', 4),\n        ('c2mm', 'D2', 4),\n        ('p4', 'C4', 4),\n        ('p4mm', 'D4', 8),\n        ('p4gm', 'D4', 8),\n        ('p3', 'C3', 3),\n        ('p3m1', 'D3', 6),\n        ('p31m', 'D3', 6),\n        ('p6', 'C6', 6),\n        ('p6mm', 'D6', 12),\n    ]\n\n    target_order = 2\n    \n    # Dictionaries to hold the counts and names for each point group type\n    groups_by_pg_name = {}\n\n    for group_name, pg_name, pg_order in wallpaper_groups_data:\n        if pg_order == target_order:\n            if pg_name not in groups_by_pg_name:\n                groups_by_pg_name[pg_name] = []\n            groups_by_pg_name[pg_name].append(group_name)\n\n    print(f\"Finding wallpaper groups with a point group of order {target_order}:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    \n    total_count = 0\n    calculation_parts = []\n\n    # Iterate through the found point groups (C2, D1) in a sorted order\n    for pg_name in sorted(groups_by_pg_name.keys()):\n        groups = groups_by_pg_name[pg_name]\n        count = len(groups)\n        total_count += count\n        calculation_parts.append(str(count))\n        \n        print(f\"Found {count} group(s) with point group {pg_name}: {', '.join(groups)}\")\n\n    print(\"-\" * 40)\n    print(\"Final Calculation:\")\n    # The final equation showing the number from each category\n    equation = \" + \".join(calculation_parts)\n    print(f\"{equation} = {total_count}\")\n\nsolve_wallpaper_group_count()\n<<<4>>>"
