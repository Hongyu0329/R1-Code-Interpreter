    # A. Marangoni Force
    print("A. Marangoni Force (Surface Tension Gradient):")
    print("   - This force is caused by variations in surface tension across the weld pool surface.")
    print("   - Surface tension changes with temperature. The direction of flow depends on whether surface tension increases or decreases with temperature.")
    print("   - In most pure metals, surface tension is highest at the cool edges, pulling fluid outward.")
    print("   - HOWEVER, in stainless steels like 304, trace elements like sulfur and oxygen act as 'surfactants'.")
    print("   - These elements cause the surface tension to be highest at the hottest point (the center) and lower at the cooler edges.")
    print("   - This gradient pulls the surface fluid from the outer portions INWARDS. This perfectly matches the observation and is the primary cause of deep, narrow welds in stainless steels.")
    print("   - Verdict: Strong candidate for the dominant mechanism.\n")

    # B. Arc Drag Force
    print("B. Arc Drag Force:")
    print("   - This is the shear force from the high-velocity plasma jet pushing the liquid metal.")
    print("   - The flow is directed radially OUTWARD from the center. This contradicts the observation.\n")

    # C. Arc Pressure Force
    print("C. Arc Pressure Force:")
    print("   - This force from the arc plasma depresses the center of the pool but does not primarily drive inward surface flow.\n")

    # D. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force
    print("D. Lorentz Force:")
    print("   - This force is generated by the interaction of the welding current and its magnetic field. It pinches the liquid metal inward and pushes it downward.")
    print("   - While it contributes to inward motion, the Marangoni effect is the established dominant mechanism for the *surface flow reversal* described.\n")

    # E. Buoyancy Force
    print("E. Buoyancy Force:")
    print("   - Arises from density differences due to heat. It is generally a much weaker force in welding compared to Marangoni and Lorentz forces and does not explain the strong inward surface flow.\n")

    print("="*70)
    print("Conclusion: The inward flow from the edges is a classic signature of reversed Marangoni flow, caused by surfactants in the 304 stainless steel. It is the dominant mechanism.")
