    # First Reason: The Physical Action of Tides
    print("Reason 1: The Flow of Tides")
    print("The phrase 're-measures' suggests a constant, cyclical action. This strongly points to the movement of the tides.")
    print("The tides, governed by the moon, cause the sea level to rise and fall, constantly changing the boundary between water and land.")

    # Second Reason: The Metaphor for Contemplation
    print("Reason 2: Evoking Introspective Contemplation")
    print("The poem has a pensive and introspective tone, set 'At the grave edge of the world'.")
    print("The speaker describes their internal state by saying, 'I am agate, opaline,' which are stones known for their inner layers and depth.")
    print("The sea's repetitive, measuring action serves as a powerful metaphor for the speaker's own mind turning over thoughts and feelings, contemplating distance in a personal or emotional sense.")

    # Conclusion
    print("Conclusion:")
    print("Option A, 'To show the flow of tides and evoke ideas of introspective contemplation,' successfully captures both the literal, physical action of the sea and its metaphorical connection to the speaker's internal state.")
    print("Therefore, 'A' is the most comprehensive answer.")
