    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Interpretation of the problem**\nFirst, I will set up a coordinate system for the two cubes. I'll place the first cube (C1) in the first octant, with one corner at the origin (0,0,0) and the opposite corner at (1,1,1). This means its coordinates range from 0 to 1 on each axis.\n\nThe phrase \"shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal\" is key. The main diagonal of this cube is the vector from (0,0,0) to (1,1,1). I will interpret the shift as being by the vector `(1/2, 1/2, 1/2)`. This means the second cube (C2) is positioned as if it were moved from C1's position by 1/2 unit in the x, y, and z directions simultaneously.\n\n**2. Defining the intersection**\nThe intersection of the two cubes is the region of space that belongs to both C1 and C2. Since both cubes are axis-aligned, their intersection will be a smaller, axis-aligned rectangular prism (in this case, a cube).\n\n**3. Calculating the volume**\nI will find the dimensions of this intersection cube by determining the overlap range for each of the x, y, and z coordinates. The volume is simply the product of these dimensions (length * width * height).\n\n**4. Code Implementation**\nFinally, I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out the steps, the final equation with all its numbers, and the resulting volume.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_cube_intersection():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the volume of the intersection of two unit cubes\n    shifted by 1/2 along the main diagonal.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Side length of the original cubes\n    side_length = 1.0\n    \n    # The shift value along each axis, based on the problem description.\n    # A shift of 1/2 along the main diagonal (1,1,1) is interpreted\n    # as a shift vector of (1/2, 1/2, 1/2).\n    shift = 0.5\n    \n    # Define the bounds of the first cube (C1)\n    c1_min = 0.0\n    c1_max = side_length\n    \n    # Define the bounds of the second, shifted cube (C2)\n    c2_min = shift\n    c2_max = side_length + shift\n    \n    # The intersection of two intervals [a, b] and [c, d] is [max(a, c), min(b, d)].\n    # The length of the intersection is min(b, d) - max(a, c).\n    # Since the setup is symmetrical, the side length of the intersection\n    # is the same for x, y, and z axes.\n    \n    intersection_side_length = min(c1_max, c2_max) - max(c1_min, c2_min)\n    \n    # The volume of the intersection is the cube of its side length.\n    volume = intersection_side_length ** 3\n    \n    print(\"This script calculates the volume of the intersection of two shifted unit cubes.\")\n    print(f\"The side length of each original cube is {side_length}.\")\n    print(f\"The cubes are shifted relative to each other by {shift} along each axis.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n    print(f\"The side length of the resulting intersection cube is {intersection_side_length}.\")\n    print(\"The volume is calculated by cubing this side length.\")\n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    # The final equation shows the numbers used for the calculation.\n    print(f\"({intersection_side_length}) ** 3 = {volume}\")\n\nsolve_cube_intersection()\n<<<0.125>>>\n```"
