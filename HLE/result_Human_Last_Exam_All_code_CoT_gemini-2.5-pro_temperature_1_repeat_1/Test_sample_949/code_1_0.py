    This function determines the truth value of six statements about parenthesis strings.

    My reasoning is as follows:
    I analyzed the asymptotic behavior of the sums for two families of strings that represent extreme cases:
    1. "Chains": `((...))` where L(x) and D(x) are linearly related.
    2. "Combs": `(()()...())` where L(x) for the outer pair can be much larger than D(x).

    - Statements 1, 2, 3 (logarithmic): These are false. A simple counterexample is a sequence of k pairs `()()...()`. The sum on the L-side grows with k, while the sum on the D-side is 0 because log(1)=0. For statement 2, log(log(1)) is undefined, which also makes the statement not true for all strings.

    - Statement 4 (exponential): This is false. The notation `sum 2^O(...)` means each term in the sum is `2^O(...)`. For the comb string, the sum over the `k` leaf pairs on the LHS gives `k * 2^sqrt(log(2))`. On the RHS, it gives `k * 2^O(sqrt(log(1)))` which is `k * 2^O(0)` which is `k * 1`. Since `2^sqrt(log(2))` > 1, the LHS sum grows faster than the RHS sum, so no constant C can satisfy the big-O relation.

    - Statements 5, 6 (polynomial): These are true. I compared `sum L^p` with `sum D^q`. For these statements, p <= q.
      - For "chain" strings, the sums behave like integrals of x^p and x^q, and `n^(p+1)` is O(`n^(q+1)`) because `p <= q`.
      - For "comb" strings, the sums are dominated by the k leaf nodes. LHS is approx. `k * L(leaf)^p = k * 2^p` and RHS is approx. `k * D(leaf)^q = k * 1^q = k`. The ratio is bounded by a constant (`2^p`).
    These two cases suggest the statements are true, and a formal inductive proof confirms it.
