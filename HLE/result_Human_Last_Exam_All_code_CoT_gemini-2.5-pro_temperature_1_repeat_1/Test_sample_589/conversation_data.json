    "My plan is to identify the specific Hollywood movie that contains the scene you described. I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  I will first break down the user's request into key, searchable elements: a Hollywood movie from a major studio, a teenager, a pink bike, and the action of pedaling toward an oncoming car.\n2.  I will then search my knowledge base for films containing this exact combination. Many popular teen movies feature some of these elements, but not all. For example, in *It* (2017), teenagers on bikes are confronted by a car, but the bike is not pink.\n3.  My search indicates that the scene described occurs in the 1994 film *It's Pat: The Movie*, which was produced by Touchstone Pictures (a Disney label). In the film, a teenage character named Kyle, in a moment of obsessive despair, rides his pink bike directly toward an oncoming car. This matches every element of your query.\n4.  Finally, as requested, I will provide a simple Python script to print the name of the film.\n\n```python\n# This script identifies and prints the name of the movie\n# where a teenager rides a pink bike toward an oncoming car.\n\n# The film is a 1994 feature film produced by Touchstone Pictures.\nmovie_title = \"It's Pat: The Movie\"\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(movie_title)\n```\n<<<It's Pat: The Movie>>>"
