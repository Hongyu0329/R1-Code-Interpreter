    This function explains and calculates the smallest possible cardinality
    of the collection of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate
    decomposable continuum.

    Step 1: Lower Bound
    A nondegenerate decomposable continuum X can be written as the union of two
    proper subcontinua, X = A U B.
    This implies that X contains at least two disjoint non-empty open sets U and V
    whose closures, cl(U) and cl(V), are distinct proper subcontinua.
    These closures can be shown to be regular subcontinua.
    Therefore, the number of regular proper subcontinua must be at least 2.

    Step 2: Achievable Minimum
    We can construct a continuum that has exactly 2 regular proper subcontinua.
    Let P1 and P2 be two indecomposable continua (e.g., pseudo-arcs).
    Let X be the continuum formed by joining P1 and P2 at a single point.
    X is decomposable as X = P1 U P2.
    The only two regular proper subcontinua of X are P1 and P2 themselves.
    This shows that a cardinality of 2 is achievable.

    Conclusion:
    Combining Step 1 and Step 2, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
