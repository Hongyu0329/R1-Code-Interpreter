# This Python code will print the solution to the Go puzzle.
# The reasoning is based on the step-by-step analysis of the board position.
#
# The key findings of the analysis are:
# 1. The black stones are initially separated into three weak groups.
# 2. The point B2 is critical for connecting these groups.
# 3. A direct attack by White at B2 fails because Black can capture the attacking stone.
# 4. The correct move is White at B1. This creates a threat that forces a sequence of moves.
# 5. This sequence leads to a 'squeeze' (damezumari), where the large connected black group has only two liberties left and cannot escape capture.

# The solution is the single coordinate that initiates this killing sequence.
# Based on the analysis, this move is B1.

solution = "{B1}"
