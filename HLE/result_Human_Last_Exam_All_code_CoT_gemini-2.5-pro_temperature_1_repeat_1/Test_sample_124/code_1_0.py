    # A: False. Approximate methods can be more efficient.
    # B: False. It is not resilient to high treewidth.
    # C: True. Nodes are cliques, and they manage joint distributions (potentials).
    # D: False. Premise is false.
    # E: True. This is its main limitation.
    # F: False. Same as D.
    # G: True. The use of large joint distribution tables for high-treewidth graphs is the reason it's not resilient.
    # H: False. The relationship is exponential.
    # I: True. The complexity is exponential in the size of the largest clique.
    # J: False. The efficiency diminishes significantly.
    # L: True. This is a correct and precise description of the Running Intersection Property.
