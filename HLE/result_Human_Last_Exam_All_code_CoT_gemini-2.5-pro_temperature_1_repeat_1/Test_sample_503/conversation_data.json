    "An internal adjunction in a 2-category is defined by a pair of morphisms (1-cells) $f: X \\to Y$ and $g: Y \\to X$ and a pair of transformations (2-cells) $\\eta: \\mathrm{id}_X \\to g \\circ f$ and $\\epsilon: f \\circ g \\to \\mathrm{id}_Y$ satisfying certain axioms. In the simplex category $\\Delta$, viewed as a locally posetal 2-category, this structure simplifies significantly.\n\nHere's the step-by-step derivation:\n\n1.  **Objects and Morphisms:** The objects are finite ordered sets $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$. The morphisms are order-preserving maps. In this problem, we are looking at an adjunction from $[n]$ to $[m]$, with $n=23$ and $m=37$. This means we have an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$ and its right adjoint $g: [m] \\to [n]$.\n\n2.  **Adjunction Condition:** The 2-cells in $\\Delta$ are given by the pointwise order on maps. Thus, the conditions for an adjunction become:\n    *   $f: [n] \\to [m]$ is order-preserving.\n    *   $g: [m] \\to [n]$ is order-preserving.\n    *   $\\mathrm{id}_{[n]} \\le g \\circ f$, which means $i \\le g(f(i))$ for all $i \\in [n]$.\n    *   $f \\circ g \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[m]}$, which means $f(g(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [m]$.\n    These conditions are precisely the definition of a Galois connection between the posets $[n]$ and $[m]$.\n\n3.  **Counting Adjunctions:** An adjunction is uniquely determined by its left adjoint map $f$. We need to find the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ that have a right adjoint. A map between posets has a right adjoint if it preserves all existing suprema (joins). For an order-preserving map $f: [n] \\to [m]$, this condition simplifies to a single constraint: $f$ must map the minimum element of $[n]$ to the minimum element of $[m]$. That is, $f(0) = 0$.\n\n4.  **Combinatorial Problem:** The problem is now reduced to counting the number of order-preserving maps $f: [n] \\to [m]$ such that $f(0)=0$. An order-preserving map is defined by a non-decreasing sequence of values: $0 = f(0) \\le f(1) \\le \\dots \\le f(n) \\le m$.\n    Since $f(0)$ is fixed, we only need to choose the values for $f(1), f(2), \\dots, f(n)$. This is equivalent to choosing $n$ numbers from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$ (which has $m+1$ elements) with replacement, arranged in non-decreasing order.\n\n5.  **The Formula:** This is a classic combinatorial problem known as \"combinations with repetition\". The number of ways to choose $r$ items from a set of $k$ with repetition is given by the multiset coefficient $\\binom{k+r-1}{r}$. In our case, we are choosing $r=n=23$ values from a set of $k=m+1=38$ possible values. The formula gives:\n    $$ \\binom{(m+1) + n - 1}{n} = \\binom{m+n}{n} $$\n\n6.  **Calculation:** For $n=23$ and $m=37$, the number of adjunctions is:\n    $$ \\binom{37+23}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\nThe following Python code calculates this value.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of internal adjunctions in the simplex category Delta\n    from [n] to [m].\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 23\n    m = 37\n\n    # The number of internal adjunctions from [n] to [m] is given by the\n    # number of order-preserving maps f: [n] -> [m] such that f(0) = 0.\n    # This is a combinatorial problem of choosing n values for f(1),...,f(n)\n    # from the set {0, 1, ..., m} with replacement.\n    # The formula for this is the binomial coefficient C(m+n, n).\n\n    # Calculate the binomial coefficient C(60, 23)\n    result = math.comb(m + n, n)\n\n    # Print the equation and the result\n    print(f\"The number of internal adjunctions is C({m} + {n}, {n}).\")\n    print(f\"C({m+n}, {n}) = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<46433367154800>>>"
