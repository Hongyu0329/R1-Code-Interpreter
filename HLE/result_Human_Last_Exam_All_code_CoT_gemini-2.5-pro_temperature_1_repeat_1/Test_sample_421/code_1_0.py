    This script analyzes the number of distinct paths in a space composed

    # Step 1: Define the components of the space.
    # The space has a line segment (ends A and B) and a circle.
    # They intersect at two points, which we'll call P1 and P2.
    # A path from A to B must go from A to P1, then from P1 to P2, then from P2 to B.

    # Step 2: Identify the "base" paths between the intersection points.
    # The number of choices a path can make is determined by the journey between P1 and P2.
    # There are three simple, direct routes from P1 to P2:
    # 1. The straight line segment between P1 and P2.
    # 2. The first arc of the circle connecting P1 and P2.
    # 3. The second arc of the circle connecting P1 and P2.
    num_base_paths = 3

    print(f"There are {num_base_paths} fundamental 'base' paths between the two intersection points.")

    # Step 3: Consider the effect of self-intersections, which allow for loops.
    # A path can loop back on itself. For example, a path can travel from P1 to P2
    # via one route (e.g., Arc 1) and then return to P1 via another (e.g., the line segment).
    # This forms a complete loop.
    #
    # A path can traverse such loops any number of times (k = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
    # before finally taking a base path from P1 to P2.
    # Each value of 'k' (the number of loops) results in a new, distinct path.
    # Since there is no upper limit on 'k', the number of possible loop combinations is infinite.
    num_loop_combinations = "infinity"

    # Step 4: Formulate the final conclusion.
    # The total number of distinct paths is the product of the number of base paths
    # and the number of possible loop combinations.
    print("\nThe total number of distinct paths can be expressed by the conceptual equation:")
    print(f"Total Paths = (Number of Base Paths) x (Number of Loop Combinations)")
    
    final_answer = "infinity"

    # The final equation with the numbers included:
    print(f"Total Paths = {num_base_paths} * {num_loop_combinations} = {final_answer}")
    print("\nBecause we can add an unlimited number of loops to any path, there are infinitely many distinct paths.")
