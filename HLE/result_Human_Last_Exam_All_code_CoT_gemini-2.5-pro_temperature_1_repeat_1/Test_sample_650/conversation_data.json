    "To determine the computational time complexity of the `IMAG(n, c)` algorithm, we need to analyze how the number of operations grows as the input `n` increases. The core of the algorithm is the `while` loop, so our analysis will focus on how many times this loop runs and how much work is done in each iteration.\n\nMy plan is to provide a Python script that prints a step-by-step derivation of the complexity. The script will:\n1.  Identify that the `while` loop is the most significant part of the algorithm for complexity analysis.\n2.  Determine the number of iterations the loop performs by analyzing how the loop control variable `q` changes.\n3.  Analyze the cost of the operations inside the loop.\n4.  Combine these findings to calculate the overall time complexity.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_complexity():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints a step-by-step analysis of the time complexity\n    for the provided algorithm IMAG(n, c).\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Step-by-step analysis of the computational time complexity of the IMAG(n, c) algorithm:\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    \n    print(\"\\n1.
