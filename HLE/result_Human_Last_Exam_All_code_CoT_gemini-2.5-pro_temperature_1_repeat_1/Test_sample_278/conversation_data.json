    "To find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure, we first need to determine the extent of the figure in the x and y directions. This is equivalent to finding the minimum and maximum values of x and y.\n\n**Step-by-step plan:**\n1.  **Analyze the parametric equations:** The curve is defined by `x = cos(t)` and `y = b * sin(t)`, with `b` changing based on the interval of `t`.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, `b = 1`. The curve is `x = cos(t)`, `y = sin(t)`, which is the upper half of a unit circle. Here, `x` ranges from -1 to 1, and `y` ranges from 0 to 1.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, `b = 5`. The curve is `x = cos(t)`, `y = 5sin(t)`, which is the lower half of an ellipse. Here, `x` ranges from -1 to 1, and `y` ranges from -5 to 0.\n\n2.  **Find the overall bounds (the bounding box):**\n    *   **x-direction:** Combining both intervals, the minimum value of `x` is -1 and the maximum is 1.\n    *   **y-direction:** Combining both intervals, the minimum value of `y` is -5 and the maximum is 1.\n\n3.  **Determine the dimensions of the bounding box:**\n    *   The width of the figure is `x_max - x_min = 1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   The height of the figure is `y_max - y_min = 1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square:** A square that encloses this bounding box must have a side length equal to the larger of the two dimensions (width or height).\n    *   Side length `s = max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the area:** The area of this square is `side_length * side_length`.\n\nThe following Python code implements these steps to calculate the final area.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Step 1: Define the bounds of the figure based on the parametric equations.\n# For x = cos(t), the minimum value is -1 and the maximum is 1 for t in [0, 2*pi].\nx_min = -1.0\nx_max = 1.0\n\n# For y, we consider two parts:\n# Part 1: t in [0, pi], y = sin(t). Max y is sin(pi/2) = 1. Min y is 0.\n# Part 2: t in (pi, 2*pi), y = 5*sin(t). Min y is 5*sin(3*pi/2) = -5. Max y is 0.\n# The overall y_min is the minimum of {0, -5}, and y_max is the maximum of {1, 0}.\ny_min = -5.0\ny_max = 1.0\n\nprint(f\"The minimum and maximum x-values are {x_min} and {x_max}.\")\nprint(f\"The minimum and maximum y-values are {y_min} and {y_max}.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 2: Calculate the width and height of the bounding box.\nwidth = x_max - x_min\nheight = y_max - y_min\n\nprint(f\"The width of the figure is {x_max} - ({x_min}) = {width}\")\nprint(f\"The height of the figure is {y_max} - ({y_min}) = {height}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 3: The side of the smallest enclosing square is the maximum of the width and height.\nside_length = max(width, height)\n\nprint(f\"The side length of the smallest enclosing square is max({width}, {height}) = {side_length}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 30)\n\n# Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\narea = side_length ** 2\n\nprint(\"The area of the square is side * side.\")\nprint(f\"Final Area = {side_length} * {side_length} = {area}\")\n\n<<<36.0>>>\n```"
