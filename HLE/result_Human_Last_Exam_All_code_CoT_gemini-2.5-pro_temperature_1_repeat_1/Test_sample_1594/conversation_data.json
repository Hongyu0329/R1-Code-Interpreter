    "This is a geographical knowledge question. To answer it, one must look at a satellite or aerial view of the two schools in Pisa, Italy. The \"Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti\" and the \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini\" are located next to each other. When viewed from above, their main buildings form a distinct letter.\n\nMy plan is to provide a simple Python script that stores this letter in a variable and then prints it to the console.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pisa_highschools_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the puzzle about the shape formed by two high schools in Pisa.\n    By observing satellite imagery of the Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and the\n    Istituto Ulisse Dini, we can see the letter their buildings form.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The letter formed by the buildings when seen from above.\n    # The long building of Galilei-Pacinotti and the adjacent Ulisse Dini form this shape.\n    formed_letter = \"T\"\n\n    print(f\"The buildings of Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, when seen from above, form the letter: {formed_letter}\")\n\nsolve_pisa_highschools_puzzle()\n```\n<<<T>>>"
