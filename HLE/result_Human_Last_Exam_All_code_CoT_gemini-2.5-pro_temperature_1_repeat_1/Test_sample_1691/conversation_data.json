    "To develop an analytical formula for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ in the small $\\epsilon$ regime, we can use an approximation method based on the dominant contribution to the integral.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** For a small positive $\\epsilon$, the integrand $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon + g(x)}$ (where $g(x) = 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8$) becomes very large when the denominator is very small. The denominator is smallest when $g(x)$ is at its minimum.\n2.  **Locate the dominant region:** The function $g(x)$ is a sum of positive terms for $x>0$, and $g(0)=0$. Thus, the minimum of $g(x)$ on the interval $[0, 15]$ is at $x=0$. This means the primary contribution to the integral comes from the region near $x=0$.\n3.  **Approximate the function:** For values of $x$ close to 0, the lowest power of $x$ in $g(x)$ is the most significant term. So, we can approximate $g(x) \\approx 9x^5$.\n4.  **Approximate the integral:** With this approximation, the integral becomes $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$. Since the integrand's value is concentrated at small $x$ and decreases rapidly, extending the upper integration limit from 15 to $\\infty$ simplifies the calculation without introducing significant error.\n5.  **Evaluate the integral analytically:** The approximated integral $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{dx}{\\epsilon + 9x^5}$ can be solved exactly. By performing a substitution $u^5 = 9x^5/\\epsilon$, the integral transforms into a standard form related to the Beta function. The result is of the form $I(\\epsilon) \\approx C \\epsilon^{\\alpha}$.\n6.  **Provide the code:** I will provide a Python script that calculates the constants $C$ and $\\alpha$ and prints the final analytical formula.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to derive the formula and compute the constants.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_integral_approximation():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the analytical approximation for the integral\n    I(epsilon) for small epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The integral is I(epsilon) = integral_0^15 dx / (epsilon + 9x^5 + 5x^6 + 9x^8)\n    # For small x, the denominator is dominated by the term with the lowest power of x.\n    # Denominator approx epsilon + c0 * x^n\n    c0 = 9.0\n    n = 5.0\n    \n    # The approximation for the integral is I(epsilon) ~ C * epsilon^alpha\n    # The exponent alpha is given by -(n-1)/n\n    alpha_num = -(n - 1.0)\n    alpha_den = n\n    alpha = alpha_num / alpha_den\n    \n    # The coefficient C is given by (c0^(-1/n) * pi) / (n * sin(pi/n))\n    # This comes from evaluating the integral: integral_0^inf dx / (epsilon + c0*x^n)\n    C = (c0**(-1.0/n) * np.pi) / (n * np.sin(np.pi/n))\n    \n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form:\")\n    print(\"I(epsilon) = C * epsilon^alpha\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nBased on the leading term 9.0 * x^5.0 in the denominator, the constants are derived as follows:\")\n    print(f\"alpha = -({n} - 1.0) / {n}\")\n    print(f\"C = ({c0}^(-1.0/{n}) * pi) / ({n} * sin(pi/{n}))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nSubstituting the numerical values into these expressions:\")\n    print(f\"alpha = {alpha}\")\n    print(f\"C approx {C:.6f}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThus, the final approximate analytical formula is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) approx ({C:.6f}) * epsilon^({alpha})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nThe full analytical expression with each number is:\")\n    print(f\"I(epsilon) = ({c0}^(-1.0/{n}) * pi / ({n} * sin(pi/{n}))) * epsilon^(-({n}-1.0)/{n})\")\n\nsolve_integral_approximation()\n```\n<<<$I(\\epsilon) = (\\frac{\\pi}{5 \\cdot 9^{1/5} \\sin(\\pi/5)}) \\epsilon^{-4/5}$>>>"
