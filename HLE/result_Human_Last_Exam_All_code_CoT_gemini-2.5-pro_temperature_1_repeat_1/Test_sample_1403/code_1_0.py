    # --- Part 1: Simultaneous Guessing (Finding N) ---
    # In this scenario, no information can be passed between individuals during the guess.
    # The optimal strategy is to divide the group into two teams.
    # Let's say the two hat choices are Color A and Color B.
    # The teams' guesses are based on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of Color A hats.
    #
    # Strategy:
    # One team will always assume the total number of Color A hats is EVEN.
    # The other team will always assume the total number of Color A hats is ODD.
    #
    # Since the total number of Color A hats can only be either even or odd, one of the teams
    # is guaranteed to have guessed based on the correct assumption, and will therefore be correct.
    # To maximize the *guaranteed* number of correct people, we must maximize the size of the
    # smaller team. This is achieved by splitting the group as evenly as possible.
    
    # For 9 people, the most even split is into a team of 4 and a team of 5.
    group_size_1 = num_individuals // 2
    group_size_2 = num_individuals - group_size_1

    # The guaranteed number of correct guesses, N, is the size of the smaller group.
    # If the parity is what the smaller group guessed, they are correct.
    # If the parity is what the larger group guessed, they are correct.
    # The worst-case (guaranteed) number of correct guesses is min(4, 5).
    N = min(group_size_1, group_size_2)

    # --- Part 2: Sequential Guessing (Finding M) ---
    # In this scenario, one person guesses first, and the others hear the guess.
    # This first person can use their guess to send a signal to the others.
    #
    # Strategy:
    # The first person (the "speaker") agrees to signal the parity of the other 8 hats.
    # For example: Speaker says "Color A" if they see an EVEN number of Color A hats among the others.
    #              Speaker says "Color B" if they see an ODD number of Color A hats among the others.
    #
    # The other 8 people (the "listeners") hear this signal. Each listener can also see the
    # hats of the other 7 listeners.
    # For a listener, their own hat is the only one they cannot see. They can count the number of
    # Color A hats among the 7 other listeners they see.
    # By comparing the parity they see (of 7 hats) with the total parity of all 8 listeners
    # (which the speaker announced), they can deduce their own hat color with 100% certainty.
    #
    # For example, if the speaker announces "EVEN" and a listener sees 5 (an ODD number) of
    # Color A hats, the listener knows their own hat must be Color A to make the total even.
    #
    # This means all 8 listeners are guaranteed to be correct. The speaker's guess, however,
    # is not guaranteed to be correct, as it was only used to send a signal.
    M = num_individuals - 1

    # --- Part 3: The Result ---
    # Calculate the difference between M and N.
    difference = M - N
