    "My plan is to first identify the specific character in William Morris's *The House of the Wolfings* who fits the description provided. I will do this by searching the book's plot and character backstories for an individual who has been to a Roman city and speaks of its customs. The description of a religious practice involving twins and a wolf points directly to the Roman founding myth of Romulus and Remus. After identifying the character and the context of their story, I will present the answer in a simple Python script that prints the information for the user.\n\n```python\n# The character in \"The House of the Wolfings\" who describes Roman customs.\n# This character was once a slave in a Roman city and recounts his experiences.\n\ncharacter_name = \"Eyolf\"\nrelationship_to_protagonist = \"foster-brother of Thiodolf\"\n\n# In Chapter IV, Eyolf describes a statue he saw in the Roman city.\n# His description is of a she-wolf suckling two infants, which the reader\n# recognizes as the Capitoline Wolf statue representing the legend of Romulus and Remus.\n\nprint(f\"The character in William Morris's The House of the Wolfings who visited a Roman city and describes their religious practices is {character_name}.\")\nprint(f\"He is the {relationship_to_protagonist}.\")\nprint(\"He recounts his time as a thrall (slave) and describes seeing a statue of a she-wolf with two infant children at her teats, a clear reference to Romulus and Remus.\")\n\n```\n<<<Eyolf>>>"
