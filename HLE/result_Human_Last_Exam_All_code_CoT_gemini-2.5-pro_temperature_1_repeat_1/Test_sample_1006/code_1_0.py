# The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a space X
# with specific properties related to the long ray R.

# 1. The properties given are:
#    - X is a compact topological space.
#    - X contains a dense copy of the long ray R.
#    - Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous function on X.

# 2. These properties uniquely define the Stone-Čech compactification of R, denoted βR.
#    The Stone-Čech compactification is a standard construction in topology.

# 3. A key theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification of a
#    Tychonoff space (like the long ray R) is unique up to homeomorphism.

# 4. This means that any two spaces, X1 and X2, that satisfy the given conditions
#    must be homeomorphic to each other.

# 5. Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.

# The final answer is the integer 1.
number_of_classes = 1

# There is no complex equation, so we will just print the final number.
