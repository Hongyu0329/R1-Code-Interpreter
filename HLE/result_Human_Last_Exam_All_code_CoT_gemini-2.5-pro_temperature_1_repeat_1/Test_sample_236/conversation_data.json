    "To determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and its Elements:** The homology cobordism group, $\\Theta^3_H$, is known to have two elements. It is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$. These elements are the *trivial element* and the *non-trivial element*. They are distinguished by an invariant called the Rokhlin invariant, which is 0 for the trivial element and 1 for the non-trivial element.\n\n2.  **Relate Surgery to Group Elements:** An integral surgery on a knot $K$ produces a homology 3-sphere (a manifold whose homology groups are the same as the 3-sphere) if and only if the surgery coefficient is $\\pm 1$. The resulting homology sphere represents an element in $\\Theta^3_H$. A key theorem states that the Rokhlin invariant of this manifold is equal to the Arf invariant of the original knot $K$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Arf Invariant:** The Arf invariant of a knot $K$ can be determined from its Alexander polynomial, $\\Delta_K(t)$.\n    *   If $\\Delta_K(-1) \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod 8$, the Arf invariant is 0.\n    *   If $\\Delta_K(-1) \\equiv \\pm 3 \\pmod 8$, the Arf invariant is 1.\n\n4.  **Analyze Knots up to Four Crossings:** The knots with four or fewer crossings are the unknot ($0_1$), the trefoil knot ($3_1$), and the figure-eight knot ($4_1$). We will calculate the Arf invariant for each to see which elements of $\\Theta^3_H$ they can represent.\n\n5.  **Count the Unique Elements:** We will count how many distinct elements (trivial and non-trivial) are represented by this set of knots.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates how many elements of the homology cobordism group can be\n    represented by integral surgery on knots with at most four crossings.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Knots with at most 4 crossings and their standard Alexander polynomials.\n    # The polynomial is represented as a lambda function of a variable 't'.\n    knots = {\n        \"Unknot (0_1)\": lambda t: 1,\n        \"Trefoil (3_1)\": lambda t: t**2 - t + 1,\n        \"Figure-eight (4_1)\": lambda t: t**2 - 3*t + 1,\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing knots with at most four crossings to determine which elements of the\")\n    print(\"homology cobordism group (Theta^3_H) can be represented by integral surgery.\")\n    print(\"This group has two elements, distinguished by the Rokhlin invariant (0 or 1).\\n\")\n    print(\"The Rokhlin invariant of a homology sphere from +/-1 surgery on a knot K is equal to the Arf invariant of K.\")\n    print(\"The Arf invariant is calculated from the knot's Alexander polynomial evaluated at t=-1.\\n\")\n\n    represented_elements = set()\n\n    for name, alexander_poly in knots.items():\n        print(f\"--- Analyzing Knot: {name} ---\")\n\n        # The Alexander polynomial is defined up to units +/- t^k.\n        # We use the standard, symmetrized version.\n        # For example, for the Trefoil, Delta(t) = t^2 - t + 1.\n        # For the Figure-eight, Delta(t) = t^2 - 3t + 1.\n\n        # Evaluate the Alexander polynomial at t = -1.\n        # This value is related to the knot determinant.\n        determinant = alexander_poly(-1)\n        print(f\"Alexander polynomial at t=-1 is: {determinant}\")\n\n        # Calculate the Arf invariant based on the determinant modulo 8.\n        # Arf = 0 if det = +/- 1 (mod 8)\n        # Arf = 1 if det = +/- 3 (mod 8)\n        arf_invariant = -1 # Default/error value\n        det_mod_8 = determinant % 8\n        if det_mod_8 in (1, 7): # 7 is congruent to -1 mod 8\n            arf_invariant = 0\n        elif det_mod_8 in (3, 5): # 5 is congruent to -3 mod 8\n            arf_invariant = 1\n\n        if arf_invariant == 0:\n            print(f\"The determinant ({determinant}) is congruent to {determinant % 8} mod 8.\")\n            print(f\"This implies the Arf invariant is 0.\")\n            print(f\"Therefore, surgery on this knot represents the TRIVIAL element of Theta^3_H.\")\n            represented_elements.add(\"Trivial\")\n        elif arf_invariant == 1:\n            print(f\"The determinant ({determinant}) is congruent to {determinant % 8} mod 8.\")\n            print(f\"This implies the Arf invariant is 1.\")\n            print(f\"Therefore, surgery on this knot represents the NON-TRIVIAL element of Theta^3_H.\")\n            represented_elements.add(\"Non-Trivial\")\n        else:\n            print(\"Could not determine the Arf invariant from the determinant.\")\n        \n        print(\"-\" * (len(name) + 22) + \"\\n\")\n\n    num_elements = len(represented_elements)\n\n    print(\"Summary:\")\n    print(f\"The set of representable elements is: {represented_elements}\")\n    print(f\"The total number of distinct elements of the homology cobordism group that can be\")\n    print(f\"represented by integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings is: {num_elements}\")\n\n    # The final answer must be wrapped in <<<>>>\n    # We use sys.stdout.write to avoid adding a newline character.\n    sys.stdout.write(f\"<<<{num_elements}>>>\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<2>>>"
