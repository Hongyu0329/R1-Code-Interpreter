    # Part (a): Condition for similarity of diagonal matrices.
    # Two diagonal matrices are similar if and only if one can be obtained from the
    # other by permuting the diagonal entries. This is equivalent to saying they
    # must have the same multiset of eigenvalues (i.e., same eigenvalues with the
    # same multiplicities).
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Number of similarity classes for n=3.
    # A similarity class is determined by the multiset of its 3 eigenvalues.
    # The eigenvalues are chosen from a set of 3 distinct values {alpha, beta, gamma}.
    # This is a "combinations with repetition" problem: choosing k items from n types.
    # Here, k=3 (matrix size) and n=3 (number of distinct eigenvalue choices).
    # The number of classes is given by the formula C(n+k-1, k).
    n_b = 3  # Number of distinct eigenvalue choices
    k_b = 3  # Size of the matrix (number of eigenvalues to choose)

    # Calculate the number of combinations with repetition
    numerator = n_b + k_b - 1
    denominator_k = k_b
    num_classes_b = math.comb(numerator, denominator_k)
    answer_b = num_classes_b

    # Part (c): Growth of the number of similarity classes.
    # For a matrix in M_n(F) over a field F with q elements, the number of
    # similarity classes of diagonal matrices is the number of ways to choose n
    # eigenvalues from q possibilities, with repetition.
    # The number of classes is C(n+q-1, n) = C(n+q-1, q-1).
    # For a fixed q, this expression is a polynomial in n of degree q-1.
    # Polynomial growth is not exponential growth.
    answer_c = "No"
