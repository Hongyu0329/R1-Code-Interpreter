# The central plot element in both stories is a pun or homophone that is specific to the English language.
# In Asimov's "The Next Day," the ambiguity is between the spoken word "tomorrow" and the phrase "to Morrow" (a person's name).
# In Christie's "The Thumb Mark of St. Peter," the clue is the mishearing of the poison "pilocarpine" as a fish-related phrase like "pile of carp."
# A direct translation would lose this sound-based wordplay, breaking the plot. We must evaluate which translation practices can preserve this crucial clue.

# I. Transcreation: This involves finding a new pun in the target language that serves the same plot function. This is an ideal solution as it preserves the cleverness of the original for the new audience. This works.
# II. Embedded audio links: This allows the reader to hear the original English pun. While it breaks immersion, it successfully conveys the information needed to solve the mystery. This works.
# III. Changing the setting: This is insufficient by itself. Moving the story to a new country doesn't automatically create a new, relevant pun in that country's language. This does not work.
# IV. A foreigner with an accent: This is a creative narrative device to justify a new pun or mispronunciation in the target language, creating the necessary ambiguity. This works.
# V. Pictorial illustration: The problem is auditory (a pun), not visual. A picture cannot convey the sound of words. This does not work.
# VI. Footnotes with phonetic transcriptions: This method explicitly explains the original English pun to the reader. It's a direct, if not elegant, way of ensuring the reader understands the clue. This works.

# The options that are capable of overcoming the challenge are I, II, IV, and VI.
# The final answer is these Roman numerals in ascending order, separated by hyphens.
