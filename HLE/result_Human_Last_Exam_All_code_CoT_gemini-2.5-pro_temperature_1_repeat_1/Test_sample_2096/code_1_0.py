    This script solves the provided riddle by identifying its literary source.

    The riddle's structure, with its anachronistic and absurd accusations
    involving religious figures, points directly to Joseph Heller's novel
    "Catch-22", which was published in 1961 (the 1960s).

    1. The word 'X' must be something shameful for a Pope.
    2. The word 'X' must have been "written in the 1960s".

    The word "ILLITERATE" fits both conditions perfectly:
    - It would be deeply shameful for a Pope, a figure expected to be highly learned.
    - The word "illiterate" is used in "Catch-22" and was therefore literally
      written by its author in the 1960s. This is the meta-joke of the riddle.

    The script will now print the final answer as an equation.
