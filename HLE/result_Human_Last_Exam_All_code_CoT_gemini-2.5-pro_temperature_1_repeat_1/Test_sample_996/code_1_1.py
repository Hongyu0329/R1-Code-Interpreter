  Calculates the parameters a, b, c, d, e, f based on the analysis of the
  functions alpha(k) and beta(k).

  The analysis suggests:
  - alpha(k) is in Theta(log k), so a=0, b=1, c=0.
  - beta(k) is in Theta(k^d), so e=0, f=0.
  
  The value of d is derived from the recurrence N(c^2) = N(c) + N(c)^2.
  While the true asymptotic value of d is likely an irrational number
  d = log2(theta) where theta is the limit of N(c_n)^(1/2^n), the problem
  asks for a rational number. The simplest non-trivial case of the recurrence
  for c=4 gives d = log4(N(4)) = log4(2) = 1/2. We will use this rational value.
