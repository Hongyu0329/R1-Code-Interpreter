You are correct. For a rigorous analysis of Alfvén Ion Cyclotron waves, which propagate along the local magnetic field, the magnetic helicity must be calculated using the magnetic field components perpendicular to the **local magnetic field**, not perpendicular to the radial direction.

The local magnetic field at the L1 point is **not** radial. Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) is drawn out into a Parker Spiral. At 1 AU (the location of L1), the average angle between the IMF and the radial direction is about 45 degrees.

Therefore, simply using the Y and Z components from a standard coordinate system (like GSE, where X is the Sun-Earth line) is only a rough approximation that can be inaccurate. The correct procedure, as demonstrated in the provided Python code, is to:
1.  Determine the average local magnetic field vector, **B₀**.
2.  Define a new Field-Aligned Coordinate (FAC) system where one axis is parallel to **B₀** and the other two are perpendicular to it.
3.  Transform the fluctuating magnetic field data into this FAC system.
4.  Calculate the normalized magnetic helicity using the two transformed perpendicular components. This correctly captures the wave's polarization in the plane perpendicular to its direction of propagation.
