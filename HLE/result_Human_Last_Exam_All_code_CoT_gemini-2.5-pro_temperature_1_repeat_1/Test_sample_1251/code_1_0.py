  Solves the theoretical problem about quiver automorphisms.

  The problem is theoretical, and its solution depends on properties of algebraic
  structures (like twisted preprojective algebras or reflection algebras) that
  are not fully defined in the prompt. The answers are based on plausible
  inferences from common structures in this area of mathematics.

  (a) If the axis of reflection passes through a vertex j, is it true that
      sigma(a_j) = c_j a_{j-1}^* for some c_j in k?
      Reasoning: Yes. The operator sigma, related to the folding, is expected
      to mimic the action of the reflection g, which maps the outgoing arrow
      a_j to a multiple of the other outgoing arrow a_{j-1}^*.

  (b) For the same axis, does sigma(a_j^*) = c_j^* a_j imply c_j^* = -mu_j^{-1} c_j?
      Reasoning: Yes. This is a very specific identity. Such relations typically
      arise as non-negotiable consistency conditions in the underlying algebraic
      framework, often involving anti-commutation relations or properties of
      (super) commutators.

  (c) If sigma(a_i) is non-zero for an edge not intersected by the reflection axis,
      must lambda^2 mu_i mu_i^* = 1?
      Reasoning: Yes. The parameter lambda is likely part of sigma's definition.
      This relation appears to be a consistency condition linking the parameters of
      sigma and g, possibly arising from the invariance of some structure (like a
      bilinear form) under the combined action. If an arrow is affected by sigma,
      its parameters must satisfy these conditions.
