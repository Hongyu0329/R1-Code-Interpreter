    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula (C7H14):** I will first calculate the Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) to determine if the compound contains rings or double bonds. The formula for DoU is `(2C + 2 - H) / 2`.\n2.  **Analyze the 13C NMR Data:** I will examine each of the 6 given signals. The chemical shift will tell me about the electronic environment of the carbon (e.g., alkene vs. alkane), and the multiplicity (s, t, d, q) from the DEPT spectrum will tell me the number of attached hydrogens (s=quaternary C, d=CH, t=CH2, q=CH3). The fact that there are 6 signals for 7 carbons indicates symmetry or an accidental overlap of signals.\n3.  **Identify Fragments:** Based on the NMR analysis, I will identify the structural fragments present in the molecule (e.g., a `>C=CH2` group, a `>CH-` group, etc.).\n4.  **Assemble the Structure:** I will piece together the identified fragments to form a complete, valid structure that matches the molecular formula C7H14. I will consider the symmetry required to account for the number of signals.\n5.  **Verify the Structure:** I will check if the proposed structure is fully consistent with all the provided NMR data, including the number of signals and their multiplicities. I will also address the hint about signal overlapping.\n6.  **Determine the IUPAC Name:** Once the correct structure is identified, I will determine its official IUPAC name.\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script that prints this entire step-by-step reasoning process, leading to the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_structure_and_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the provided molecular formula and 13C NMR data to determine the\n    IUPAC name of the hydrocarbon.\n    \"\"\"\n    formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data_str = \"145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\"\n\n    # Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {formula}.\")\n    # For CxHy, DoU = (2C + 2 - H) / 2\n    dou = (2 * 7 + 2 - 14) / 2\n    print(f\"The Degree of Unsaturation is calculated as (2*7 + 2 - 14)/2 = {int(dou)}.\")\n    print(\"A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of one double bond or one ring.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(f\"The NMR data is: {nmr_data_str}\")\n    print(\"The spectrum shows 6 signals for a 7-carbon molecule.
