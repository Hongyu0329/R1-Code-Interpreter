    This function calculates the coefficients k_Yuk and k_D+F based on the reasoning provided.
    
    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  We match the N=1 gauge-Yukawa term to the corresponding term in the N=4 Lagrangian.
        The N=1 term is proportional to sqrt(2) * g.
        The N=4 term is proportional to 2 * k_Yuk.
        By equating the real parts of the scalar field coefficients (as a shortcut to the full derivation), we find:
        2 * k_Yuk = sqrt(2) * g
        Assuming the gauge coupling g=1, this gives k_Yuk.

    2.  We match the N=1 D-term potential to the corresponding part of the N=4 scalar potential.
        The standard N=1 D-term potential is (1/2) * g^2 * (D-term)^2.
        The problem gives the D-term part as (1/2) * (f_abc * ...)^2, implying g=1.
        This term represents a part of the full scalar potential L_{F+D}. The coefficient k_{D+F} is the overall
        normalization of the full potential, and its value is fixed by the normalization of its constituent parts,
        like the D-term. The standard coefficient for the D-term squared in the potential is 1/2.
