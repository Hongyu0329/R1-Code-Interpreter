# Step 1: Determine the number of equivalence classes for each component space.

# The torus is a homogeneous space. Any point can be mapped to any other point
# via a translation, which is an auto-homeomorphism.
torus_classes = 1

# The sphere is a homogeneous space. Any point can be mapped to any other point
# via a rotation, which is an auto-homeomorphism.
sphere_classes = 1

# The real line is a homogeneous space. Any point can be mapped to any other point
# via a translation f(z) = z + a, which is an auto-homeomorphism.
real_line_classes = 1

# A discrete space with a finite number of points is homogeneous because any
# permutation of the points is an auto-homeomorphism.
three_point_discrete_classes = 1
five_point_discrete_classes = 1

# Step 2: The total number of equivalence classes is the sum of the classes
# from each disjoint component.
total_classes = torus_classes + sphere_classes + real_line_classes + three_point_discrete_classes + five_point_discrete_classes

# Step 3: Print the result and the calculation.
