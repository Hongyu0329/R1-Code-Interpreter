# Step 1: Define the orders of the torsion subgroups of the homology groups for the real projective plane (RP^2).
# H_1(RP^2, Z) = Z_2, so the torsion subgroup has order 2.
h1_torsion_order = 2

# H_i(RP^2, Z) for i >= 2 are trivial, so their torsion subgroups have order 1.
h2_torsion_order = 1
# Higher homology groups are also trivial. We only need the first few non-trivial terms.

# Step 2: Apply the formula for the number of non-collapsible forests, N.
# N = ( |T_1|^( (-1)^(1+1) ) * |T_2|^( (-1)^(2+1) ) * ... )^2
# where |T_i| is the order of the torsion subgroup of H_i.

# For i=1, the exponent is (-1)^(1+1) = 1.
term1_val = h1_torsion_order ** 1

# For i=2, the exponent is (-1)^(2+1) = -1.
term2_val = h2_torsion_order ** -1

# The product of the terms inside the parenthesis.
# Subsequent terms are 1, so they don't affect the product.
base_product = term1_val * term2_val

# The final result is the square of the product.
result = base_product ** 2

# Step 3: Print the equation and the final answer.
# We explicitly show each part of the calculation as requested.
