    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct film.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the core elements of the question.**\nThe query asks for a specific scene in a film with the following key components:\n1.  **Film Type:** A Hollywood feature film.\n2.  **Production:** Produced by a major film studio (e.g., Warner Bros., Universal, Disney, Paramount, Sony).\n3.  **Character:** A teenager.\n4.  **Prop:** A pink bike.\n5.  **Action:** The teenager pedals the bike directly toward an oncoming car.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze each element and consider potential candidates.**\n\n*   **\"Hollywood feature film\" / \"Major film studio\":** This rules out independent films, foreign films, and TV shows. We should focus on well-known, mainstream American movies.\n*   **\"Teenager\":** The character is typically between 13 and 19 years old. This is a common protagonist age in many popular films.\n*   **\"Pink bike\":** This is a very specific and memorable visual detail. The color pink might suggest a female character, or it could be used ironically for a male character.\n*   **\"Pedals directly toward an oncoming car\":** This describes a highly dramatic and confrontational scene, likely a moment of defiance, desperation, or a game of \"chicken.\"\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate common films that feature teenagers and bikes.**\n\n*   ***E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial* (1982):** Features kids on bikes, but the iconic scene involves them flying to escape, not pedaling toward a car. No prominent pink bike is featured in this context.\n*   ***The Karate Kid* (1984):** Daniel is chased by bullies on motorcycles while he is on his bike, but he is fleeing from them, not riding toward them. His bike is yellow, not pink.\n*   ***Napoleon Dynamite* (2004):** Napoleon is a teenager with a bike, but the bike is not pink. In a notable scene, he is pulled by a rope behind a school bus; he does not pedal toward an oncoming car.\n*   ***Footloose* (1984):** There is a famous game of \"chicken,\" but it involves two tractors, not a bike and a car.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on the combination of \"pink bike\" and \"pedaling toward a car.\"**\n\nThis specific combination points to a more recent film. The 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's novel **\"It\"** contains a scene that perfectly matches every detail of the question.\n\n*   **Film:** *It* (2017).\n*   **Studio:** Produced by New Line Cinema and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a major studio. **(Criterion Met)**\n*   **Character:** The members of the \"Losers' Club\" are all young teenagers (around 13-14 years old). The specific character in this scene is Richie Tozier. **(Criterion Met)**\n*   **Action & Prop:** After a rock fight, the bully Henry Bowers pursues the Losers' Club in his car. To create a diversion and taunt the bully, Richie Tozier turns his bike around and pedals directly at Bowers' speeding Pontiac Trans Am, yelling, \"Welcome to the Losers' Club, asshole!\" This forces Bowers to swerve and crash. **(Criterion Met)**\n*   **The Bike's Color:** Richie Tozier's bike in the film has a distinctive faded magenta or purplish-pink frame, which is clearly identifiable as \"pink\" in the context of the scene. **(Criterion Met)**\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe film that features a teenager (Richie Tozier) riding a pink/magenta bike and pedaling directly toward an oncoming car (driven by Henry Bowers) is the 2017 major studio production, *It*.\n\n<<<It (2017)>>>"
