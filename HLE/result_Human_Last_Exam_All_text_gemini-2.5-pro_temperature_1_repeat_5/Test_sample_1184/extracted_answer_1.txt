The following provides a detailed answer based on extensive biochemical and structural studies of the calcium channel alpha-1 and beta subunit complex.

**Reference Protein:** Human Calcium channel voltage-dependent beta-1 subunit (CACNB1), UniProt: **P54289**.

### 1) Hotspot Residues from Beta-1 Subunit for Interaction with Alpha-1 Subunit

These residues are located primarily in the conserved Guanylate Kinase (GK) domain of the beta-1 subunit. They form a hydrophobic groove that directly cradles the Alpha Interaction Domain (AID) helix of the alpha-1 subunit. Mutating these residues severely disrupts or abolishes the binding.

**Key Residues in the GK Hydrophobic Groove:**

*   **Tyrosine 213 (Y213):** Forms a key part of the groove.
*   **Valine 215 (V215):** Contributes to the hydrophobic pocket.
*   **Leucine 263 (L263):** A critical hydrophobic contact point.
*   **Methionine 294 (M294):** Lines the binding groove.
*   **Valine 296 (V296):** Contributes to hydrophobic interactions.
*   **Alanine 300 (A300):** A key contact residue within the groove.
*   **Tryptophan 327 (W327):** Forms a deep part of the pocket, crucial for anchoring the AID.
*   **Isoleucine 329 (I329):** Another essential hydrophobic contact.
*   **Leucine 332 (L332):** Contributes to the hydrophobic surface.

**Summary for Question 1:** The interaction hotspots are a cluster of hydrophobic residues within the GK domain (approximately residues 210-340) that form a binding pocket for the alpha-1 subunit's AID. The residues listed above are among the most critical for this physical interaction.

### 2) Hotspot Residues from Beta-1 Subunit for Fine-Tuning Gating Properties

While the entire binding event described above is necessary for the primary modulation (e.g., increased channel expression and large shift in activation voltage), the *fine-tuning* of gating kinetics is controlled by other regions, particularly the variable N-terminus.

**A) Primary Gating Modulation (The "On Switch"):**
*   **The entire SH3-GK core (residues ~175-475):** The act of high-affinity binding through the GK domain and the correct positioning maintained by the SH3 domain are collectively responsible for the major modulatory effects:
    1.  Trafficking the alpha-1 subunit to the plasma membrane.
    2.  Inducing a significant hyperpolarizing (leftward) shift in the voltage-dependence of activation, making the channel easier to open.

**B) Fine-Tuning of Gating (The "Dimmer Switch"):**
*   **The N-Terminal Domain (residues ~1-70):** This is the most critical region for *isoform-specific fine-tuning*, especially of inactivation kinetics. This region is highly variable between different beta-1 splice variants.
    *   For the **beta-1b isoform**, the **N-terminus (specifically the first ~30 amino acids)** is a well-established hotspot. Its presence is directly responsible for **slowing the rate of voltage-dependent inactivation** of the Cav2.3 channel. It does not act as an "inactivation gate" itself, but rather allosterically modifies the inactivation process inherent to the alpha-1 subunit. It is the *presence and specific sequence* of this domain, rather than a single residue, that constitutes the hotspot.
*   **The SH3 Domain (residues ~175-240):** While part of the binding core, its precise orientation and interaction with the GK domain are critical for transmitting the modulatory effects. Residues at the SH3-GK interface can be considered modulatory hotspots because they ensure the correct allosteric communication.
*   **Linker Regions:** The flexible linker connecting the N-terminus to the SH3 domain (Linker 1) and the linker connecting the SH3 and GK domains (Hook/Linker 2) also contribute to the final gating properties by providing conformational flexibility and positioning the functional domains correctly.

**Summary for Question 2:** The major modulatory effect stems from the entire SH3-GK core binding. However, the key hotspot for *fine-tuning gating*, especially inactivation speed, is the **variable N-terminal domain (residues 1-70)**, with its exact effect being dependent on the specific splice isoform (e.g., beta-1b).
