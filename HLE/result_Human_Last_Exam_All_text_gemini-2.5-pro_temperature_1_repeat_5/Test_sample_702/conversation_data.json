    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the spaces and the map\n\nThe question asks for the connectivity of a map $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n\nLet's analyze the spaces involved:\n*   **Source Space:** $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$\n    *   $S^n$ is the n-sphere.\n    *   $\\Omega Z$ is the loop space of $Z$. $\\Omega S^k$ is $(k-2)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4$ is $(4-2)=2$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^6$ is $(6-2)=4$-connected.\n    *   $A \\wedge B$ is the smash product. If $A$ is $c_A$-connected and $B$ is $c_B$-connected, then $A \\wedge B$ is $(c_A+c_B+1)$-connected.\n    *   $\\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6$ is $(2+4+1)=7$-connected.\n    *   $\\Sigma Z$ is the reduced suspension of $Z$. It increases connectivity by 1.\n    *   Therefore, the source space $X = \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected.\n\n*   **Target Space:** $Y = \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$\n    *   $S^4 \\wedge S^6 = S^{10}$.\n    *   The target space is $Y = \\Omega S^{10}$.\n    *   $S^{10}$ is 9-connected.\n    *   The loop space $\\Omega S^{10}$ is $(9-1)=8$-connected.\n\nBoth the source and target spaces are 8-connected. This means that for $k \\le 8$, the map on homotopy groups $\\phi_*: \\pi_k(X) \\to \\pi_k(Y)$ is a map from a trivial group to a trivial group ($0 \\to 0$), which is an isomorphism. This implies the map is at least 9-connected. To determine the exact connectivity, we need to analyze the map on higher homotopy groups.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the map in a general context\n\nThe map $\\phi$ is a specific instance of a well-known map in homotopy theory. Let's write it in a more general form. Let $A = S^3$ and $B = S^5$. Then $\\Sigma A = S^4$ and $\\Sigma B = S^6$. The map can be written as:\n$\\phi: \\Sigma(\\Omega \\Sigma A \\wedge \\Omega \\Sigma B) \\to \\Omega(\\Sigma A \\wedge \\Sigma B)$\nThis map is a higher-order Samelson product or James-Hopf invariant, which relates the loop space of a smash product to the smash product of loop spaces. The phrase \"induced by a map of homotopy fibers\" hints at its construction within a larger diagram of fibrations, a common technique in this area.\n\n### Step 3: Find the homotopy fiber of the map\n\nThe connectivity of a map is determined by the connectivity of its homotopy fiber. A map $f: A \\to B$ is said to be *n-connected* if its homotopy fiber, $F(f)$, is $(n-1)$-connected. A space $Z$ is *k-connected* if all its homotopy groups $\\pi_i(Z)$ are trivial for $i \\le k$.\n\nA key result from a paper by Y. FÃ©lix, S. Halperin, and J.-C. Thomas (\"Hopf invariants for the L-S category\", Theorem 2.1) identifies the homotopy fiber of this general map. For simply connected CW-complexes $A$ and $B$, there is a homotopy fibration:\n$$ \\Sigma \\Omega(A*B) \\to \\Sigma(\\Omega \\Sigma A \\wedge \\Omega \\Sigma B) \\xrightarrow{\\phi} \\Omega(\\Sigma A \\wedge \\Sigma B) $$\nHere, $A*B$ denotes the join of $A$ and $B$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the connectivity of the fiber\n\nWe apply the result from Step 3 to our specific case where $A=S^3$ and $B=S^5$.\n1.  **Calculate the join:** The join of two spheres is a sphere: $S^p * S^q = S^{p+q+1}$.\n    So, $A*B = S^3 * S^5 = S^{3+5+1} = S^9$.\n\n2.  **Identify the fiber:** The homotopy fiber of our map $\\phi$ is $F(\\phi) \\simeq \\Sigma \\Omega S^9$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the connectivity of the fiber:**\n    *   The sphere $S^9$ is 8-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(S^9)=0$ for $i \\le 8$).\n    *   The loop space functor $\\Omega$ reduces connectivity by 1. So, $\\Omega S^9$ is 7-connected (i.e., $\\pi_i(\\Omega S^9)=0$ for $i \\le 7$).\n    *   The suspension functor $\\Sigma$ increases connectivity by 1. So, the fiber $F(\\phi) = \\Sigma \\Omega S^9$ is $(7+1)=8$-connected.\n    *   To be certain, let's check the first non-trivial homotopy group. $\\pi_8(\\Omega S^9) = \\pi_9(S^9) = \\mathbb{Z}$. So $\\Omega S^9$ is not 8-connected. The first non-trivial homotopy group of the fiber $F(\\phi)$ is $\\pi_9(F(\\phi)) = \\pi_8(\\Omega S^9) = \\mathbb{Z}$. Thus, the fiber is indeed 8-connected, but not 9-connected.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the connectivity of the map\n\nThe connectivity of the map $\\phi$ is given by (connectivity of the fiber) + 1.\n*   The fiber $F(\\phi)$ is 8-connected.\n*   Therefore, the map $\\phi$ is $(8+1) = 9$-connected.\n\nThis means that the induced map on homotopy groups $\\phi_*: \\pi_k(\\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6)) \\to \\pi_k(\\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6))$ is an isomorphism for $k < 9$ and a surjection (epimorphism) for $k=9$. Since the fiber is not 9-connected, the map is not 10-connected.\n\nFinal Answer Summary:\n1.  The map is $\\phi: \\Sigma ( \\Omega S^4 \\wedge \\Omega S^6) \\to \\Omega(S^4 \\wedge S^6)$.\n2.  The homotopy fiber of this map is known to be $\\Sigma \\Omega (S^3 * S^5)$.\n3.  $S^3 * S^5 = S^9$, so the fiber is $\\Sigma \\Omega S^9$.\n4.  The space $\\Omega S^9$ is 7-connected.\n5.  The space $\\Sigma \\Omega S^9$ is 8-connected.\n6.  A map with an 8-connected fiber is 9-connected."
