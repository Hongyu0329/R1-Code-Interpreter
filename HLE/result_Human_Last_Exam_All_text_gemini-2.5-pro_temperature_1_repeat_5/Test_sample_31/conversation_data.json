    "To determine the Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL) case on a 3x3 Rubik's Cube, we need to identify the arrangement of the four top-layer edge pieces and four top-layer corner pieces. The top face itself is already solved (all one color, e.g., yellow) after the Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL) step. Therefore, we must gather information from the side stickers of the top layer.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to find the minimum number of non-top-facing stickers that must be seen:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Information Needed**\nThere are 21 distinct PLL cases, plus the solved state. We need to gather enough information from the side stickers to uniquely distinguish between these 22 possibilities. The side of the top layer consists of 12 stickers in total: one for each of the 4 edge pieces and two for each of the 4 corner pieces.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Viewing a Small Number of Stickers**\nLet's analyze if a small number of sticker observations is sufficient.\n\n*   **1 to 3 Stickers:** This is insufficient. For example, seeing that the front edge sticker is incorrect doesn't narrow the possibilities much; it could be a T, H, Z, V, F, G, N, or Y-perm. There are far too many ambiguities.\n\n*   **4 Stickers:** Let's consider some strategic sets of 4 stickers.\n    *   **The 4 edge stickers:** If we look at the side sticker of each of the four edge pieces, we can fully determine the permutation of the edges. However, this is not enough. The A-permutations (which only permute corners) and the solved state would all look identical because all edge stickers would be in their correct places.\n    *   **4 corner stickers (e.g., the front-facing and right-facing stickers of the front two corners):** This provides good information about two corners but no information about the other two corners or any of the edges. This set cannot distinguish between the edge-only permutations (U, H, Z) and the solved state.\n    *   **2 edge stickers and 2 corner stickers:** A set like the front edge, right edge, front-left corner (front), and front-right corner (front) fails to distinguish an H-perm (opposite edge swap) from a Z-perm (adjacent edge swap). In both cases, with a standard orientation, the front and right edges are unsolved, while the corners are solved.\n\nFrom this analysis, 4 stickers are not enough to guarantee the identification of every PLL case.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Viewing 5 Stickers**\nLet's consider a strategic set of 5 stickers. A particularly effective set is:\n1.  The front-facing sticker of the Front edge.\n2.  The right-facing sticker of the Right edge.\n3.  The back-facing sticker of the Back edge.\n4.  The front-facing sticker of the Front-Left corner.\n5.  The front-facing sticker of the Front-Right corner.\n\nLet's analyze the information this set provides:\n\n*   **Full Edge Permutation:** Observing 3 of the 4 edge pieces is enough to know the full permutation of all 4 edges. Since there are only 4 edge pieces, if you know where 3 of them have gone, the position of the 4th is automatically determined. This information is sufficient to distinguish between all edge-only permutations (Ua, Ub, H, Z).\n\n*   **Partial Corner Permutation:** The two corner stickers provide crucial information to resolve ambiguities among cases that have similar or identical edge permutations. For example:\n    *   **A-perms vs. Solved State:** All these cases have solved edges. Our set of 3 edge stickers would all show correct colors. However, the 2 corner stickers would show different patterns for the solved state, the Aa-perm, and the Ab-perm, allowing us to distinguish them.\n    *   **Mixed Permutations:** For more complex cases like G-perms or N-perms, the combination of knowing the complete edge permutation and the state of two specific corner stickers is sufficient to create a unique \"signature\" for each case, resolving all ambiguities.\n\nSince 4 stickers are insufficient and a well-chosen set of 5 stickers is sufficient, the minimum number required is 5.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   This analysis assumes you can look at any 5 stickers, not just those visible from a single, fixed angle.\n*   The key is that the information from the chosen stickers must be enough to distinguish all 22 states (21 PLLs + solved) without any pre-orientation (AUF).\n*   The redundancy in permutations (knowing 3 determines the 4th) is critical to minimizing the number of stickers needed.\n\nFinal conclusion is that a minimum of 5 non-top-facing stickers must be seen.\n\n<<<5>>>"
