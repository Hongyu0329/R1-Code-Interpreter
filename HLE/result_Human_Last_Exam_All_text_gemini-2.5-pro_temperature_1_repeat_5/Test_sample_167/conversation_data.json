    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Definitions**\n    *   **Graph $K_{1000,1000}$**: This is the complete bipartite graph with two sets of vertices, U and W, each containing 1000 vertices. Every vertex in U is connected to every vertex in W. The degree of every vertex in this graph is 1000.\n    *   **Alon-Tarsi Number, $AT(G)$**: This is a graph parameter defined via graph orientations. The Alon-Tarsi number of a graph G, denoted $AT(G)$, is the smallest integer $k$ for which there exists an orientation $D$ of the edges of G such that:\n        1.  The out-degree of every vertex $v$ is less than $k$ (i.e., $d_D^+(v) < k$ for all $v \\in V(G)$).\n        2.  The number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an even number of edges, $EE(D)$, is not equal to the number of Eulerian subgraphs of $D$ with an odd number of edges, $EO(D)$.\n    *   **List Chromatic Number, $\\chi_l(G)$**: Also known as the choice number, this is the minimum integer $k$ such that for any assignment of lists of $k$ colors to each vertex, a proper coloring can be chosen from these lists.\n\n2.  **Relate Alon-Tarsi Number to List Chromatic Number**\n    *   The Alon-Tarsi Theorem provides a powerful connection between these two numbers. It states that for any graph G, $AT(G) \\le \\chi_l(G)$.\n    *   A significant result in this area, proven by Z. D. Gao, shows that for complete bipartite graphs, equality holds: $AT(K_{m,n}) = \\chi_l(K_{m,n})$.\n    *   **Careful Point**: This equality is crucial. Without it, calculating $AT(G)$ directly from its definition is extremely difficult. By using this theorem, we can rephrase the problem as finding the list chromatic number of $K_{1000,1000}$.\n\n3.  **Find the List Chromatic Number of $K_{m,n}$**\n    *   There is a well-known formula for the list chromatic number of a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, established by Erdos, Rubin, and Taylor.\n    *   The formula states that $\\chi_l(K_{m,n})$ is the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies the inequality:\n        $$ \\binom{2k-2}{k-1} \\ge \\min(m, n) $$\n    *   **Careful Point**: It is important to use the correct formula. There are different characterizations, but this inequality is the most direct for calculation.\n\n4.  **Apply the Formula to $K_{1000,1000}$**\n    *   In our case, $m = 1000$ and $n = 1000$, so $\\min(m, n) = 1000$.\n    *   We need to find the smallest integer $k$ such that:\n        $$ \\binom{2k-2}{k-1} \\ge 1000 $$\n\n5.  **Calculate the Values**\n    *   We test values of $k$ sequentially to find the smallest one that satisfies the inequality. The term $\\binom{2k-2}{k-1}$ is the $(k-1)$-th central binomial coefficient, divided by 2.\n    *   **For $k=1$**: $\\binom{0}{0} = 1$\n    *   **For $k=2$**: $\\binom{2}{1} = 2$\n    *   **For $k=3$**: $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{2 \\cdot 1} = 6$\n    *   **For $k=4$**: $\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 20$\n    *   **For $k=5$**: $\\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5}{4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 70$\n    *   **For $k=6$**: $\\binom{10}{5} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6}{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 252$\n    *   **For $k=7$**: $\\binom{12}{6} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7}{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 924$\n    *   **For $k=8$**: $\\binom{14}{7} = \\frac{14 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8}{7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = 3432$\n\n6.  **Conclusion**\n    *   For $k=7$, we have $\\binom{12}{6} = 924$, which is less than 1000. So $k=7$ is not sufficient.\n    *   For $k=8$, we have $\\binom{14}{7} = 3432$, which is greater than or equal to 1000.\n    *   Therefore, the smallest integer $k$ satisfying the condition is $k=8$.\n    *   This means $\\chi_l(K_{1000,1000}) = 8$.\n    *   Since $AT(K_{1000,1000}) = \\chi_l(K_{1000,1000})$, the Alon-Tarsi number of $K_{1000,1000}$ is 8.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{8}$.\n<<<8>>>"
