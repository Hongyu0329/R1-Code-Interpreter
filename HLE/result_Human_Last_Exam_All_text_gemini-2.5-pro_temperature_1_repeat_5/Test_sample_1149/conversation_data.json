    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of depressions in the lacrimal recess of *Irritator challengeri*.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Subject and Anatomical Feature:** The question focuses on the dinosaur species *Irritator challengeri* and a specific feature of its skull: the \"lacrimal recess\". The lacrimal is a bone situated in front of the eye socket, and a recess is a depression or fossa on that bone.\n\n2.  **Consult the Primary Scientific Source:** To find accurate anatomical details, we must refer to the primary scientific literature describing the *Irritator challengeri* holotype specimen (SMNS 58022). The most comprehensive description is found in the 2002 paper by Hans-Dieter Sues, Eberhard Frey, David M. Martill, and Diane M. Scott, titled \"*Irritator challengeri*, a Spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil\".\n\n3.  **Analyze the Description of the Lacrimal Bone:** In this paper, the authors provide a detailed description of the skull bones. They describe the lacrimal bone as having a large depression on its outer surface, which is part of the antorbital fossa.\n\n4.  **Locate the Specific Description of the Lacrimal Recess:** The paper states that within this larger fossa, there is a distinct, pocket-like feature called the lacrimal recess. This recess itself is a major depression. The authors note that the recess is subdivided by a low ridge into two unequal portions: a smaller anterodorsal portion and a larger posteroventral portion.\n\n5.  **Identify and Count the Depressions within the Recess:** The critical information comes from the description of the larger, posteroventral portion of the recess. The paper explicitly states that the floor of this part of the recess \"is pierced by **three large foramina** arranged in a triangle.\" Foramina are holes or deep pits, which are a type of depression. The paper does not mention any other countable depressions within either portion of the recess.\n\n6.  **Synthesize the Findings:** The lacrimal recess is a large depression that is subdivided into two smaller depressions. However, contained within the larger of these subdivisions are three distinct, named depressions (the foramina). Therefore, the most precise answer to \"how many depressions does the lacrimal recess contain?\" is to count these specific, enumerated features.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n\n*   **Source Reliability:** It is crucial to use the primary scientific description of the holotype specimen for the most accurate information, rather than general summaries.\n*   **Anatomical Terminology:** Understanding that \"foramina\" (singular: foramen) are a type of depression is key to answering the question correctly.\n*   **Interpretation of \"Contains\":** The question asks what the recess \"contains\". This points to the smaller features within the larger structure, not the subdivisions of the structure itself. The three foramina are contained within the recess.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis of the primary paleontological evidence, we can conclude the number of specified depressions.\n\n<<<3>>>"
