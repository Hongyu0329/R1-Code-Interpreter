No, it is not possible.

The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and the logical system of Gödel's ontological proof operate in completely separate and incommensurable domains.

1.  **Different Subject Matter**: The mathematics of quantum mechanics (based on Hilbert spaces and linear operators) is designed to model the behavior of **physical systems**. It deals with concepts like state vectors, observables, probability amplitudes, and time evolution. In contrast, Gödel's ontological proof is an exercise in **abstract modal logic and metaphysics**. It deals with non-physical concepts like "positive properties," "essence," and "necessary existence."

2.  **Incompatible Concepts**: The core concepts of Gödel's proof cannot be meaningfully translated into the language of quantum mechanics. There is no natural or objective way to represent a "positive property" or "logical necessity" as a vector, an operator, or any other structure within a Hilbert space. Any such attempt would be an arbitrary act of redefinition, not a genuine proof.

3.  **Different Meanings of "Existence"**: The "existence" that quantum mechanics addresses is physical and probabilistic, confirmed by measurement. The "existence" proven in Gödel's argument is a purely logical conclusion derived from a set of axioms within a modal system.

Because the axioms and fundamental terms of Gödel's proof cannot be formulated within the mathematical language of quantum mechanics, that language cannot be used to prove it. The two systems are axiomatically and conceptually independent.
