    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the complex equation $z \\cdot i = i^z$.\n\n**Step 1: Express the equation in terms of $z = x+iy$**\n\nLet $z$ be a complex number, represented as $z = x + iy$ where $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is:\n$z \\cdot i = (x+iy) \\cdot i = xi + i^2y = xi - y = -y + ix$.\n\nThe right-hand side (RHS) of the equation involves complex exponentiation, $i^z$. We use the definition $a^b = e^{b \\ln a}$.\n$i^z = e^{z \\ln i}$.\n\nThe complex logarithm $\\ln i$ is a multi-valued function. To find its values, we first express $i$ in polar form: $i = e^{i\\theta}$. Here, the modulus is $|i|=1$ and the argument is $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The argument can be any angle that is coterminal with $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, so $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nSo, $\\ln i = \\ln(e^{i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)}) = i(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi)$.\nLet's define $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k)$ for simplicity. So, $\\ln i = iC_k$.\n\nNow, substitute this into the expression for the RHS:\n$i^z = e^{z \\cdot (iC_k)} = e^{(x+iy)(iC_k)} = e^{ixC_k + i^2yC_k} = e^{-yC_k + ixC_k}$.\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{a+ib} = e^a(\\cos b + i\\sin b)$, we get:\n$i^z = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\n**Step 2: Equate the LHS and RHS**\n\nNow we set the expressions for the LHS and RHS equal to each other:\n$-y + ix = e^{-yC_k}(\\cos(xC_k) + i\\sin(xC_k))$.\n\nFor two complex numbers to be equal, their real and imaginary parts must be equal. This gives us a system of two real equations:\n(I)   $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(xC_k)$\n(II)  $x = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(xC_k)$\n\nWe are looking for real pairs $(x, y)$ that solve this system for some integer $k$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the system of equations for solutions**\n\nWe can analyze the system by considering different cases for $z$.\n\n**Case A: Real solutions ($z=x$, so $y=0$)**\nIf $y=0$, the system becomes:\n(I)   $0 = e^{0}\\cos(xC_k) \\implies \\cos(xC_k) = 0$.\n(II)  $x = e^{0}\\sin(xC_k) \\implies x = \\sin(xC_k)$.\n\nFrom (I), $xC_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for some integer $n$.\nFor these values, $\\sin(xC_k) = \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi) = (-1)^n$.\nSubstituting this into (II) gives $x = (-1)^n$.\n\nIf $x=1$ (for $n$ even), the condition from (I) is $1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nSince $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi$, we need $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi$, which is satisfied if we choose $k=m$.\nSo, $z=1$ is a potential solution. Let's verify it in the original equation: $1 \\cdot i = i^1 \\implies i = i$. This is true. Thus, $z=1$ is a solution.\n\nIf $x=-1$ (for $n$ odd), the condition is $-1 \\cdot C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (2m+1)\\pi$.\n$-(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2k\\pi) = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} + 2m\\pi \\implies -\\frac{1}{2} - 2k = \\frac{3}{2} + 2m \\implies -2 = 2(k+m) \\implies k+m=-1$. This is possible for integers.\nSo, $z=-1$ is a potential solution. Let's verify: $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1} \\implies -i = \\frac{1}{i} \\implies -i = -i$. This is also true. Thus, $z=-1$ is a solution.\n\n**Careful point:** We found $z=1$ and $z=-1$ satisfy the system for specific choices of $k$. Let's check them in the original equation $zi=i^z$ more directly.\nFor $z=1$, $1 \\cdot i = i^1$, which is $i=i$. This holds for any branch of $i^1$.\nFor $z=-1$, $(-1) \\cdot i = i^{-1}$, which is $-i = 1/i = -i$. This also holds for any branch of $i^{-1}$.\nSo, $z=1$ and $z=-1$ are solutions.\n\n**Case B: Purely imaginary solutions ($z=iy$, so $x=0$)**\nIf $x=0$, the system becomes:\n(I)   $-y = e^{-yC_k}\\cos(0) \\implies -y = e^{-yC_k}$.\n(II)  $0 = e^{-yC_k}\\sin(0) \\implies 0 = 0$. This provides no information.\n\nWe need to solve the transcendental equation $-y = e^{-yC_k}$ for $y$.\nIf $y=0$, we get $z=0$, which gives $0=i^0=1$, a contradiction. So $y\\neq 0$.\nLet $a = -y$, so $a \\neq 0$. The equation becomes $a = e^{aC_k}$.\nWe can rewrite this as $a e^{-aC_k} = 1$. Multiply by $-C_k$:\n$(-aC_k)e^{-aC_k} = -C_k$.\nThis is in the form $u e^u = v$, where $u = -aC_k$ and $v = -C_k$. The solution is given by the Lambert W-function, $u = W(v)$.\n$-aC_k = W(-C_k) \\implies a = -\\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\n\nFor $y$ to be a real number, $a$ must be a real number. This requires $W(-C_k)$ to be real, which means its argument must be greater than or equal to $-1/e$. So, $-C_k \\ge -1/e$.\n\n*   If $k \\ge 0$, then $C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1+4k) > 0$. The condition becomes $C_k \\le 1/e$.\n    For $k=0$, $C_0 = \\pi/2 \\approx 1.57$, which is not $\\le 1/e \\approx 0.368$. For any $k>0$, $C_k$ is even larger. So, no solutions exist for $k \\ge 0$.\n*   If $k \\le -1$, then $C_k < 0$. The condition $-C_k \\ge -1/e$ is always satisfied since $-C_k > 0$.\n    In this case, $W(-C_k)$ is real and positive. Since $C_k$ is negative, $a = -W(-C_k)/C_k$ is positive.\n    This means $a = -y > 0$, so $y < 0$.\n\nSo, for each integer $k \\le -1$, there is a unique solution for $y$, which is negative. These solutions are given by:\n$y_k = -a = \\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$.\nThe solutions for $z$ are $z_k = iy_k = i \\frac{W(-C_k)}{C_k}$ for $k = -1, -2, -3, \\dots$.\nLet's express this using a positive index $m = -k \\ge 1$.\n$C_k = C_{-m} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(1-4m)$.\n$-C_k = \\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1)$.\nSo the family of purely imaginary solutions is $z_m = i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(1-4m)} = -i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1)}$ for $m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots$.\n\n**Step 4: Summary of solutions**\nBased on the analysis, we have found the following solutions for $z$:\n1.  Two real solutions: $z=1$ and $z=-1$.\n2.  An infinite set of purely imaginary solutions with negative imaginary parts, given by the Lambert W-function: $z_m = -i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1)}$ for every positive integer $m$.\n\nFurther analysis of the general case ($x \\neq 0$ and $y \\neq 0$) leads to a highly complex transcendental equation that is unlikely to have solutions expressible in a simple closed form, and it is plausible that the solutions found above are the only ones.\n\nFinal list of solutions:\n1.  $z = 1$\n2.  $z = -1$\n3.  $z_m = -i \\frac{W(\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1))}{\\frac{\\pi}{2}(4m-1)}$ for $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$."
