    "An internal adjunction in the simplex category $\\Delta$ from an object $[m]$ to an object $[n]$ is a pair of non-decreasing maps, $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, that form an adjoint pair. We are asked to find the number of such adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the structure of $\\Delta$ and internal adjunctions.**\nThe simplex category $\\Delta$ has objects $[k] = \\{0, 1, \\dots, k\\}$ for non-negative integers $k$. The morphisms from $[m]$ to $[n]$ are non-decreasing functions $f: [m] \\to [n]$.\nThe problem states that $\\Delta$ is viewed as a locally posetal 2-subcategory of $\\mathsf{Pos}$. This means:\n*   The objects $[k]$ are considered as posets with their usual ordering.\n*   The morphisms are order-preserving maps.\n*   For any two objects $[m]$ and $[n]$, the set of morphisms $\\mathrm{Hom}_{\\Delta}([m], [n])$ is itself a poset. The order is given by the pointwise comparison of functions: $f \\le g$ if and only if $f(x) \\le g(x)$ for all $x \\in [m]$.\nAn internal adjunction from $[m]$ to $[n]$ consists of a pair of morphisms (called 1-morphisms) $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, along with two inequalities (called 2-morphisms):\n1.  The unit: $\\mathrm{id}_{[m]} \\le R \\circ L$. This means $i \\le R(L(i))$ for all $i \\in [m]$.\n2.  The counit: $L \\circ R \\le \\mathrm{id}_{[n]}$. This means $L(R(j)) \\le j$ for all $j \\in [n]$.\n\n**Step 2: Relate the definition to a standard property of posets.**\nThe two conditions for the unit and counit are equivalent to the more common definition of a Galois connection or an adjunction between posets. A pair of order-preserving maps $L: P \\to Q$ and $R: Q \\to P$ between posets $P$ and $Q$ is an adjunction (denoted $L \\dashv R$) if and only if for all $p \\in P$ and $q \\in Q$:\n$L(p) \\le q \\iff p \\le R(q)$.\nIn our case, this means for $L: [m] \\to [n]$ and $R: [n] \\to [m]$, the condition is $L(i) \\le j \\iff i \\le R(j)$ for all $i \\in [m]$ and $j \\in [n]$.\n\n**Step 3: Characterize the adjoint maps.**\nA crucial property connects adjoint functors and the preservation of limits and colimits. In the context of posets, suprema correspond to colimits and infima to limits.\n*   A map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ has a right adjoint $R$ if and only if $L$ preserves all suprema (joins). For a finite total order like $[m]$, the only non-trivial supremum to check is that of the empty set. The supremum of the empty set in $[m]$ is its least element, $0$. Thus, $L$ must map the supremum of the empty set in $[m]$ to the supremum of the empty set in $[n]$. This translates to the condition $L(0) = 0$.\n*   Dually, a map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ has a left adjoint $L$ if and only if $R$ preserves all infima (meets). The only non-trivial infimum is that of the empty set, which is the greatest element. So, $R$ must map the infimum of the empty set in $[n]$ to the infimum of the empty set in $[m]$. This translates to the condition $R(n) = m$.\n\nIf a non-decreasing map $L: [m] \\to [n]$ satisfies $L(0)=0$, its right adjoint $R$ is uniquely determined by the formula $R(j) = \\max\\{i \\in [m] \\mid L(i) \\le j\\}$. Similarly, if a non-decreasing map $R: [n] \\to [m]$ satisfies $R(n)=m$, its left adjoint $L$ is uniquely determined by $L(i) = \\min\\{j \\in [n] \\mid i \\le R(j)\\}$.\nTherefore, counting the number of adjunctions is equivalent to counting the number of non-decreasing maps $L: [m] \\to [n]$ with $L(0)=0$.\n\n**Step 4: Formulate and solve the counting problem.**\nWe need to count the number of internal adjunctions from $[23]$ to $[37]$. Here, $m=23$ and $n=37$. Based on Step 3, this is the number of non-decreasing functions $L: [23] \\to [37]$ such that $L(0)=0$.\nA non-decreasing function $L: [23] \\to [37]$ is defined by a sequence of values $L(0), L(1), \\dots, L(23)$ satisfying:\n$L(0) \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23)$, where each $L(i) \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$.\nThe condition $L(0)=0$ fixes the first value. So we need to find the number of sequences satisfying:\n$0 \\le L(1) \\le L(2) \\le \\dots \\le L(23) \\le 37$.\nThis is a classic combinatorial problem. We are choosing 23 values ($L(1), \\dots, L(23)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}$ with replacement, and the order is determined by the non-decreasing condition.\nThis is a stars and bars problem, equivalent to choosing a multiset of size $k$ from a set of size $N$.\n*   The size of the multiset (the number of items to choose) is $k = 23$.\n*   The size of the set to choose from is $N = |\\{0, 1, \\dots, 37\\}| = 37 - 0 + 1 = 38$.\nThe number of ways to do this is given by the multiset coefficient formula:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{38+23-1}{23} = \\binom{60}{23} $$\n\n**Step 5: Sanity Check.**\nWe can also count the number of suitable right adjoints $R: [37] \\to [23]$. The condition is $R(37)=23$. So we need to count the number of non-decreasing sequences $R(0), R(1), \\dots, R(37)$ such that:\n$0 \\le R(0) \\le R(1) \\le \\dots \\le R(36) \\le R(37) = 23$.\nWe are choosing 37 values ($R(0), \\dots, R(36)$) from the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}$.\n*   The size of the multiset is $k = 37$.\n*   The size of the set to choose from is $N = |\\{0, 1, \\dots, 23\\}| = 23 - 0 + 1 = 24$.\nThe number of ways is:\n$$ \\binom{N+k-1}{k} = \\binom{24+37-1}{37} = \\binom{60}{37} $$\nUsing the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$, we have $\\binom{60}{37} = \\binom{60}{60-37} = \\binom{60}{23}$. The results match, which confirms our reasoning.\n\nThe number of internal adjunctions is $\\binom{60}{23}$.\n\n<<<Binomial[60, 23]>>>"
