Yes, the theory can fail. The introduction of a birefringent medium, represented by a Jones matrix B, disrupts the specific sequence of operations upon which the original theory relies. The matrix B does not generally commute with the matrix T of the random medium or the propagation operators P. This non-commutativity breaks the delicate cancellation assumed in the premise, meaning the new sequence of operations will no longer result in the identity transformation required for the theory to hold.
