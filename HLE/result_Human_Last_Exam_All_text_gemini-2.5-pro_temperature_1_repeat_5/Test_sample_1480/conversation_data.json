    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Concepts:**\n    *   **Fuzzy Rule:** A fuzzy rule is typically in the form of \"IF [antecedent] THEN [consequent]\". For example, \"IF temperature is HIGH THEN fan_speed is FAST\".\n    *   **Antecedent Firing Strength (Φ_k(x′)):** This value represents the degree to which the antecedent (the \"IF\" part) of the k-th rule is true for a given input `x'`. In this problem, it is given as `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`. This is often called the rule's firing level or weight.\n    *   **Consequent Membership (μG_k_j(y_j)):** This value represents the membership degree of a specific output value `y_j` in the fuzzy set of the consequent (the \"THEN\" part). It describes the shape of the output fuzzy set before it is activated by the rule. In this problem, it is given as `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`.\n    *   **Rule Activation Level (Implication Result):** This is the result of applying the rule's firing strength to its consequent fuzzy set. It determines the contribution of this specific rule to the final output. This process, known as fuzzy implication, uses a t-norm operation to combine the antecedent firing strength with the consequent membership function. The result is the membership value in the *activated* or *fired* consequent set.\n    *   **t-norm:** A t-norm is a mathematical function used to model a logical AND operation in fuzzy logic. The two most common t-norms are the minimum (min) and the algebraic product (prod). In the context of Mamdani-style fuzzy inference, the `min` operator is the standard and most widely used t-norm for implication.\n    *   **Interval Type-3 Fuzzy Set (IT3 FS):** This is an advanced type of fuzzy set. However, the problem provides crisp numerical values (`0.7` and `0.9`) rather than intervals or fuzzy sets. This implies that we are dealing with a simplified scenario, likely focusing on the principal membership functions, which reduces the calculation to the same process used in a standard Type-1 fuzzy system for this specific step. The \"Interval Type-3\" part is context but does not change the core calculation needed.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:**\n    The question asks for the \"rule activation level\" *given* the antecedent firing strength and a consequent membership value, *using* a t-norm. This means we need to perform the fuzzy implication calculation.\n\n    `Rule Activation Level = t-norm(Antecedent Firing Strength, Consequent Membership)`\n\n3.  **Perform the Calculation:**\n    *   **Inputs:**\n        *   Antecedent Firing Strength = `Φ_k(x′) = 0.7`\n        *   Consequent Membership = `μG_k_j(y_j) = 0.9`\n    *   **Operation:** t-norm. We will use the standard `min` operator.\n    *   **Calculation:**\n        `Rule Activation Level = min(0.7, 0.9)`\n    *   **Result:**\n        `Rule Activation Level = 0.7`\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Interpretation of \"Rule Activation Level\":** This term can sometimes be ambiguous. It could refer to the antecedent firing strength (`0.7`) or the result of the implication step. The phrasing \"...given [value 1] and [value 2] using a t-norm operation\" strongly indicates that a calculation is required, pointing to the implication result.\n2.  **Choice of t-norm:** The problem does not specify which t-norm to use. The minimum (`min`) operator is the most common and standard for Mamdani fuzzy implication, making it the most logical choice. If we were to use the product t-norm, the result would be `0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63`. However, without further specification, `min` is the standard assumption.\n3.  **Irrelevance of \"Interval Type-3\":** The problem simplifies the complex nature of IT3 FS by providing single, crisp values. This focuses the question on the fundamental process of fuzzy implication rather than the advanced theory of IT3 sets. The calculation is identical to what would be done in a Type-1 fuzzy system.\n4.  **The Result:** The result of the `min(antecedent_strength, consequent_membership)` operation is often described as \"clipping\" the consequent fuzzy set at the level of the antecedent's firing strength. Since the firing strength (`0.7`) is less than the consequent membership (`0.9`), the resulting activated membership is clipped to `0.7`.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nThe rule activation level in this context is the membership grade of the output after the implication step. This is calculated by applying a t-norm to the antecedent firing strength and the original consequent membership grade.\n\n*   Antecedent Firing Strength: `w = 0.7`\n*   Consequent Membership Grade: `μ = 0.9`\n*   t-norm operation (using `min` as the standard): `min(w, μ)`\n*   Final calculation: `min(0.7, 0.9) = 0.7`\n\n<<<0.7>>>"
