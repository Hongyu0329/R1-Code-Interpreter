    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the closest province or territory to the Waskaganish gathering place, outside of Quebec.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Locate Waskaganish:** The first step is to pinpoint the exact location of the Waskaganish gathering place. Waskaganish is a Cree community in northern Quebec, Canada. It is situated on the southeastern shore of James Bay, at the mouth of the Rupert River. Its approximate geographic coordinates are 51.19° N latitude, 78.76° W longitude.\n\n2.  **Identify Surrounding Provinces and Territories:** We need to look at a map of Canada to see which provinces and territories are near Waskaganish.\n    *   Waskaganish is in Quebec.\n    *   To the west and south of James Bay is the province of **Ontario**.\n    *   To the north are the islands within James Bay, which are part of the territory of **Nunavut**.\n    *   Other provinces like Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador are significantly farther away.\n\n3.  **Exclude Quebec:** The question specifically asks for the closest province or territory *outside* of Quebec. Therefore, Quebec itself is not the answer.\n\n4.  **Compare Proximity of Ontario and Nunavut:** We now need to determine whether Ontario or Nunavut is closer to Waskaganish.\n    *   **Ontario:** The province of Ontario shares a direct land border with Quebec. This border runs south from the coast of James Bay, starting at a point not far to the west of Waskaganish. The distance from Waskaganish to this land border is relatively short. The land on the western shore of James Bay is also part of Ontario.\n    *   **Nunavut:** The territory of Nunavut's closest portion to Waskaganish consists of the islands in James Bay. The largest and nearest of these islands is Akimiski Island.\n\n5.  **Determine the Closest Entity:** By visually inspecting a map or comparing the straight-line distances (as the crow flies):\n    *   The distance from Waskaganish to the Ontario-Quebec land border to the southwest is only a few dozen kilometers.\n    *   The distance from Waskaganish across the water to the nearest island of Nunavut (Akimiski Island) is over 100 kilometers.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** The land border with the province of Ontario is much closer to Waskaganish than any part of the territory of Nunavut. Therefore, Ontario is the closest province or territory to Waskaganish outside of Quebec.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Geographic Boundaries:** It is crucial to know that the islands within James Bay belong to Nunavut, while the mainland surrounding the bay is split between Quebec and Ontario.\n*   **\"Closest\" Definition:** The question implies the shortest straight-line distance (geodesic distance) from the point (Waskaganish) to the nearest boundary of another province or territory.\n*   **Location Specificity:** The location is \"Waskaganish,\" a specific community, not a general region. This allows for a precise comparison of distances.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the analysis, Waskaganish is a community in Quebec located very close to the provincial border with Ontario. The distance to the Ontario border is significantly less than the distance to the nearest part of Nunavut.\n\n<<<Ontario>>>"
