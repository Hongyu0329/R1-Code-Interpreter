    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information about a particular artwork:\n1.  **Artist:** Curt Querner\n2.  **Artwork:** A self-portrait from 1933.\n3.  **Context:** Painted after escaping from the Gestapo.\n4.  **Specific Detail:** What object is he holding in his hand?\n5.  **Symbolic Meaning:** How does this object function as a symbol of resistance?\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Specific Painting**\nA search for \"Curt Querner self-portrait 1933\" leads to the specific painting titled **\"Self-Portrait with Thistle\"** (*Selbstbildnis mit Distel*). This immediately identifies the object in his hand.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Historical Context**\n*   Curt Querner was a German painter associated with the New Objectivity movement and was a member of the Communist Party.\n*   In March 1933, shortly after the Nazis came to power, he was arrested by the Gestapo (the Nazi secret police) due to his political affiliations.\n*   After his release, he painted this self-portrait. This context is essential because the painting is a direct reaction to his persecution.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Object and its Symbolism**\n*   **Object:** As the title suggests, Querner is holding a **thistle** plant.\n*   **Symbolism:** The choice of a thistle is highly symbolic, especially in this context.\n    *   **Resilience and Toughness:** Thistles are known for being hardy, prickly weeds that can survive and thrive in harsh conditions. They are difficult to remove. By holding the thistle, Querner portrays himself as similarly resilient, tough, and defiant against the oppressive Nazi regime. He is showing that he cannot be easily crushed or eradicated.\n    *   **Pain and Defiance:** Holding a thorny plant like a thistle suggests an embrace of pain and hardship. It symbolizes his willingness to endure suffering for his convictions. His direct, confrontational gaze, combined with the prickly plant, creates an image of unbroken defiance.\n    *   **Connection to the Land and Common People:** The thistle is a common, wild plant, not a cultivated, delicate flower. This connects to Querner's identity as an artist of the people and the peasantry, in stark contrast to the idealized, heroic art favored by the Nazis. It represents an unyielding, natural force against an artificial, oppressive ideology.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the Final Answer**\nBy combining the identification of the object with its symbolic meaning within the historical context, we can formulate a complete answer. The object is a thistle, and it symbolizes his defiant, resilient, and unbroken spirit in the face of Nazi persecution.\n\n<<<A thistle>>>"
