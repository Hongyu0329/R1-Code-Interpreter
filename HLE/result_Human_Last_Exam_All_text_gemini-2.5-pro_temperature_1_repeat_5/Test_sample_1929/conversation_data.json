    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction between butadiene and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the reactants and the type of reaction.**\n*   **Reactant 1: Butadiene (specifically, 1,3-butadiene)**\n    *   Structure: CH₂=CH−CH=CH₂\n    *   This is a conjugated diene, a molecule with two double bonds separated by a single bond. It has a 4-π-electron system. Conjugated dienes are characteristic reactants in Diels-Alder reactions.\n*   **Reactant 2: 1,1-dichloro-2,2-difluoroethene**\n    *   Structure: CCl₂=CF₂\n    *   This is an alkene (a molecule with a C=C double bond), which serves as the dienophile. It has a 2-π-electron system. The four halogen atoms (Cl and F) are strongly electron-withdrawing, which makes the double bond electron-poor and thus a highly reactive dienophile.\n*   **Type of Reaction: Diels-Alder Reaction**\n    *   The reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile to form a six-membered ring is called a Diels-Alder reaction. It is a type of [4+2] cycloaddition, where \"4\" refers to the π-electrons of the diene and \"2\" refers to the π-electrons of the dienophile.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the connectivity of the product.**\n*   In a Diels-Alder reaction, the π-electrons rearrange in a concerted, cyclic process to form a new six-membered ring.\n    *   Three π-bonds are broken (two in the diene, one in the dienophile).\n    *   Two new C-C single bonds (σ-bonds) and one new C=C double bond (π-bond) are formed.\n*   Let's number the carbons of the reactants to track the bond formation:\n    *   Butadiene: C¹H₂=C²H−C³H=C⁴H₂\n    *   Dienophile: C⁵Cl₂=C⁶F₂\n*   The new σ-bonds form between the ends of the diene system and the carbons of the dienophile's double bond. Let's assume C¹ of the diene bonds to C⁵ of the dienophile, and C⁴ of the diene bonds to C⁶ of the dienophile.\n*   The new π-bond forms between the central carbons of the original diene, C² and C³.\n*   The resulting ring consists of the atoms connected in the sequence: C¹−C²=C³−C⁴−C⁶−C⁵−(and back to C¹).\n\n**Step 3: Draw the structure of the product.**\n*   Based on the connectivity established in Step 2, the product is a cyclohexene derivative.\n*   The ring contains:\n    *   A double bond between what were C² and C³ of butadiene. These carbons each still have one hydrogen atom (=CH−CH=).\n    *   Two -CH₂- groups, which were C¹ and C⁴ of butadiene.\n    *   A -CCl₂- group from the dienophile.\n    *   A -CF₂- group from the dienophile.\n*   The structure can be drawn as follows:\n    ```\n          Cl₂C — CF₂\n         /       \\\n      H₂C         CH₂\n        \\       /\n         HC === CH\n    ```\n\n**Step 4: Determine the IUPAC name of the product.**\n*   **Parent Ring**: The six-membered ring with one double bond is a cyclohexene.\n*   **Numbering**: According to IUPAC rules:\n    1.  The carbons of the double bond must be assigned positions 1 and 2.\n    2.  Number the ring to give the substituents the lowest possible locants (numbers).\n    3.  If there is a tie in locant sets, assign the lower numbers in alphabetical order of the substituents.\n\n*   Let's apply these rules:\n    1.  The `HC=CH` part of the ring is numbered C1 and C2.\n    2.  We can number clockwise or counter-clockwise around the ring.\n        *   **Path A**: If we number clockwise from C1, the substituents (Cl and F atoms) would be on carbons 4 and 5. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n        *   **Path B**: If we number counter-clockwise from C1, the substituents would also be on carbons 4 and 5. The locant set is {4,4,5,5}.\n    3.  Since both numbering paths give the same locant set {4,4,5,5}, we use alphabetical preference to break the tie. The substituents are \"chloro\" and \"fluoro\". \"Chloro\" comes before \"fluoro\" alphabetically. Therefore, the CCl₂ group must be assigned the lower number (4) and the CF₂ group gets the higher number (5).\n\n*   **Assembling the Name**:\n    *   Substituents: 4,4-dichloro and 5,5-difluoro.\n    *   Parent name: cyclohexene (the \"1\" for the double bond is omitted when it's unambiguous).\n    *   Full Name: **4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene**\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **s-cis Conformation**: For the Diels-Alder reaction to occur, the diene must be in the s-cis conformation (where the double bonds are on the same side of the central single bond). 1,3-Butadiene can freely rotate into this conformation.\n*   **Regiochemistry**: The dienophile (CCl₂=CF₂) is unsymmetrical, which could potentially lead to two different regioisomers. However, because the diene (1,3-butadiene) is symmetrical, both possible orientations of addition lead to the same single product.\n*   **Stereochemistry**: The Diels-Alder reaction is stereospecific. However, in this case, the dienophile is planar, and the product has no chiral centers (carbons with four different substituents), so there are no stereoisomers to consider.\n\nFinal product is 4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene.\n\n<<<4,4-dichloro-5,5-difluorocyclohexene>>>"
