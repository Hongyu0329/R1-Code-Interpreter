    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a barbell graph with 10 nodes using randomized uniform gossiping.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Barbell Graph Structure**\n\n*   A barbell graph is constructed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) with a bridge. The problem specifies a graph with 10 nodes. The most common and standard structure for a barbell graph is symmetric, meaning the two cliques are of the same size.\n*   Let the number of nodes in each complete graph be $k$. Since the two cliques are connected by a single edge (the simplest form of a bridge), the total number of nodes is $2k$.\n*   Given 10 nodes, we have $2k = 10$, which means $k = 5$.\n*   So, the graph consists of two complete graphs on 5 nodes, let's call them $K_5^{(1)}$ and $K_5^{(2)}$, connected by a single edge. This connecting edge is the \"bottleneck edge\".\n*   Let's denote the nodes in the first clique as $V_1 = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ and in the second clique as $V_2 = \\{v_6, v_7, v_8, v_9, v_{10}\\}$.\n*   Let the bottleneck edge be $(v_5, v_6)$, connecting the two cliques.\n\n**2. Calculate the Degree of Each Node**\n\nThe degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.\n*   **Nodes not connected to the bridge:** Consider a node like $v_1$ in $K_5^{(1)}$. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique ($v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$). So, its degree is 4. There are 4 such nodes in each clique, making a total of 8 nodes with a degree of 4.\n*   **Nodes connected to the bridge:**\n    *   Consider node $v_5$. It is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique ($v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$) and to node $v_6$ via the bottleneck edge. So, its degree is $d(v_5) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   Similarly, node $v_6$ is connected to the other 4 nodes in its clique ($v_7, v_8, v_9, v_{10}$) and to node $v_5$. So, its degree is $d(v_6) = 4 + 1 = 5$.\n    *   There are 2 such nodes, each with a degree of 5.\n\n**3. Understand the Randomized Uniform Gossiping Process**\n\n*   \"Randomized uniform gossiping\" typically refers to a process where, in each step, one node is chosen to initiate a communication.\n*   The process is as follows:\n    1.  A node $u$ is selected uniformly at random from the set of all nodes $V$. Since there are 10 nodes, the probability of selecting any specific node is $P(u) = 1/10$.\n    2.  The selected node $u$ then chooses a neighbor $v$ uniformly at random from its set of neighbors $N(u)$. The probability of choosing a specific neighbor $v$ is $P(v|u) = 1/d(u)$, where $d(u)$ is the degree of node $u$.\n\n**4. Define the Event of Interest**\n\n*   We want to find the probability of \"sampling the bottleneck edge\". In the context of this gossiping process, this means the communication (gossip) in a single step occurs across the edge $(v_5, v_6)$.\n*   This can happen in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    *   **Case A:** Node $v_5$ is selected to gossip, and it chooses to gossip to node $v_6$.\n    *   **Case B:** Node $v_6$ is selected to gossip, and it chooses to gossip to node $v_5$.\n\n**5. Calculate the Probability**\n\n*   **Probability of Case A:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v_5$ is $P(v_5) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given $v_5$ is selected, it has $d(v_5) = 5$ neighbors. The probability it chooses $v_6$ is $P(v_6|v_5) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of Case A is $P(A) = P(v_5) \\times P(v_6|v_5) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Probability of Case B:**\n    *   The probability of selecting node $v_6$ is $P(v_6) = 1/10$.\n    *   Given $v_6$ is selected, it has $d(v_6) = 5$ neighbors. The probability it chooses $v_5$ is $P(v_5|v_6) = 1/5$.\n    *   The total probability of Case B is $P(B) = P(v_6) \\times P(v_5|v_6) = (1/10) \\times (1/5) = 1/50$.\n\n*   **Total Probability:**\n    *   Since Case A and Case B are mutually exclusive events, the total probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of their probabilities.\n    *   $P(\\text{sample bottleneck}) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Graph Definition:** The interpretation of \"barbell graph\" as two symmetric cliques is standard. An asymmetric barbell (e.g., $K_4$ and $K_6$) would yield a different result, but this is a less common interpretation without further specification.\n*   **Gossiping Model:** The chosen model (one node selected uniformly, which then contacts a random neighbor) is a standard interpretation of \"randomized gossiping\". Other models, like parallel gossiping where all nodes contact a neighbor simultaneously, exist but are less likely given the phrasing \"sampling *the* bottleneck edge\".\n*   **\"Uniform\":** The word \"uniform\" in \"randomized uniform gossiping\" refers to the choice of a neighbor from the neighborhood of the active node, not that every edge in the graph is sampled with equal probability.\n\nThe final calculated probability is robust based on the standard interpretation of the problem statement.\n\n<<<1/25>>>"
