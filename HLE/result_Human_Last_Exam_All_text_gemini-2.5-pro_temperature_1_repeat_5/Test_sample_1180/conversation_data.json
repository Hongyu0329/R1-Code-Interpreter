    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the thickness of the double point.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the question and set up the problem\nThe curve is $C: z^2 = 2x^5 + 2x^3 + 1$. We need to find the thickness of the double point of its stable reduction over a 2-adic field. The valuation $v$ is normalized by $v(2)=1$. This corresponds to working over the field of 2-adic numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}_2$.\n\nThe \"thickness\" of a double point (a node) in the special fiber of a stable model is an integer $k \\ge 1$. If the stable model is defined over a ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ with uniformizer $\\pi$, the node is locally described by an equation $UV = \\pi^k$. The integer $k$ is the thickness.\n\n### Step 2: Find a more suitable model of the curve\nThe given equation is for an affine part of the curve. To understand the reduction properly, we also need to analyze the points at infinity. A hyperelliptic curve of genus $g$ given by $y^2 = f(x)$ where $\\deg(f) = 2g+1$ has a single ramified point at infinity. Here, $\\deg(f)=5$, so $2g+1=5 \\implies g=2$.\n\nTo find the local equation at infinity, we use the standard coordinate change: $x = 1/u$ and $z = w/u^{g+1} = w/u^3$.\nSubstituting these into the curve's equation:\n$(w/u^3)^2 = 2(1/u)^5 + 2(1/u)^3 + 1$\n$w^2/u^6 = (2 + 2u^2 + u^5)/u^5$\n$w^2 = u(2 + 2u^2 + u^5)$\n\nThis equation, let's call it $C_\\infty$, describes the curve in a neighborhood of the point at infinity. The bad reduction of the original curve is concentrated at this point. We will analyze the stable reduction of $C_\\infty$.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the branch points of the model at infinity\nThe curve $C_\\infty$ is a hyperelliptic curve given by $w^2 = P(u)$, where $P(u) = u^6 + 2u^3 + 2u$. This is a double cover of the $u$-line, ramified at the roots of $P(u)=0$. The stable reduction of $C_\\infty$ is determined by the 2-adic distances between these roots.\n\nThe roots of $P(u) = u(u^5 + 2u^2 + 2) = 0$ are $u=0$ and the five roots of $Q(u) = u^5 + 2u^2 + 2 = 0$.\nTo find the valuations of the roots of $Q(u)$, we use the Newton polygon method with respect to the 2-adic valuation $v$. The vertices of the polygon are given by $(i, v(c_i))$ where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $u^i$.\nThe points are: $(5, v(1))=(5,0)$, $(2, v(2))=(2,1)$, and $(0, v(2))=(0,1)$.\n\nThe lower convex hull of these points is a single line segment from $(0,1)$ to $(5,0)$.\nThe slope of this segment is $(0-1)/(5-0) = -1/5$.\nAccording to the Newton polygon theorem, there are 5 roots, and the valuation of each root is the negative of the slope. So, all five roots of $Q(u)=0$, let's call them $r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5$, have valuation $v(r_i) = 1/5$.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the structure of the stable model\nThe branch points of the cover $w^2=P(u)$ are $\\{0, r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$. We analyze their clustering based on their 2-adic valuations.\n- One root is at $u=0$.\n- The other five roots $r_i$ all have valuation $1/5$. This means they are \"closer\" to each other than to 0, as $v(r_i - r_j) \\ge \\min(v(r_i), v(r_j)) = 1/5$, while $v(r_i - 0) = 1/5$.\n\nThis configuration leads to two clusters of roots:\n- Cluster A: $\\{0\\}$\n- Cluster B: $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5\\}$\n\nThe stable model of the curve will have a double point corresponding to the separation of these two clusters. The stable reduction requires a field extension. The valuations $v(r_i)=1/5$ imply we must work in a ramified extension of $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ of degree $e=5$, namely $L = \\mathbb{Q}_2(2^{1/5})$. Let $\\pi = 2^{1/5}$ be the uniformizer of this field, so $v_L(\\pi)=1$ and $v_L(2)=5$.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the thickness of the double point\nThe thickness of the node formed between two clusters of roots A and B for a double cover is given by a formula related to the average distance between the clusters. The thickness, measured in the valuation $v_L$ of the stable model's base ring, is given by:\n$k_L = \\frac{v_L(2)}{|A||B|} \\sum_{a \\in A, b \\in B} v_L(a-b)$.\nThe division by the sizes of the clusters averages the distance, and the $v_L(2)$ factor (which is $e$) accounts for the specifics of hyperelliptic reduction theory.\n\nIn our case:\n- $|A| = 1$\n- $|B| = 5$\n- $v_L(a-b) = v_L(0-r_i) = v_L(r_i)$. Since $v(r_i)=1/5$, we have $v_L(r_i) = e \\cdot v(r_i) = 5 \\cdot (1/5) = 1$.\n- $v_L(2) = 5$.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$k_L = \\frac{5}{1 \\cdot 5} \\sum_{i=1}^5 v_L(r_i) = \\frac{5}{5} \\sum_{i=1}^5 (1) = 1 \\cdot (1+1+1+1+1) = 5$.\n\nThis calculation gives the thickness as an integer in the appropriate valuation. To be certain, other similar formulae exist, for example, based on cross-ratios, which can be more complex but should yield the same integer. The thickness of the node is related to the length of the chain of $\\mathbb{P}^1$s required to separate the clusters in the minimal resolution of the base $\\mathbb{P}^1$. This length is $v_L(2) \\times (\\text{distance between clusters}) = 5 \\times (1/5) = 1$. The thickness of the node on the curve itself is often twice this value, depending on ramification.\n\nA more direct formula for the thickness $\\delta$ of the node on the curve separating clusters A and B is:\n$\\delta = \\frac{2}{|A||B|} \\sum_{a \\in A, b \\in B} v_L(a-b)$ if both $|A|$ and $|B|$ are odd (which is our case, with sizes 1 and 5).\n$\\delta = \\frac{2}{1 \\cdot 5} \\sum_{i=1}^5 v_L(r_i) = \\frac{2}{5} \\cdot 5 = 2$.\n\nThe thickness is measured with respect to the uniformizer $\\pi$ of the extension $L$. The question asks for the thickness, which is this integer value $k$.\n\nFinal check of the steps:\n1.  Move to infinity: Correct for hyperelliptic curve $y^2=f_{2g+1}(x)$.\n2.  Find branch points: Roots of $u^6+2u^3+2u=0$.\n3.  Find valuations of roots via Newton Polygon: All 5 roots of $u^5+2u^2+2=0$ have $v_2=1/5$. This is consistent.\n4.  Identify clusters: $\\{0\\}$ and $\\{r_1, ..., r_5\\}$. This seems correct.\n5.  Calculate thickness: The formula gives an integer value after moving to the appropriate ramified extension. The factor of 2 is standard for nodes on the curve model versus the base model. The result is $\\delta=2$.\n\nFinal answer appears to be 2.\n\n>>>2"
