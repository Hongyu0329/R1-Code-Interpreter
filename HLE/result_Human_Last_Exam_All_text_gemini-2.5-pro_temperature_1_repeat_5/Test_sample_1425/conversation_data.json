    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the partition function Z for a system with Hamiltonian $H = -\\mu N$ in the grand canonical ensemble using path integrals.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Defining the Partition Function**\n\nThe grand canonical partition function, Z, is defined as the trace of the statistical density operator for a system that can exchange energy and particles with a reservoir at temperature T and chemical potential $\\mu_{res}$.\nThe general form is:\n$Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(H_{sys} - \\mu_{res} N)} \\right)$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$, $H_{sys}$ is the system's Hamiltonian operator, and $N$ is the particle number operator.\n\n**Step 2: Interpreting the Hamiltonian in the Question**\n\nThe problem states the system Hamiltonian is $H = -\\mu N$. This is an unusual form, as it lacks a kinetic energy term. It describes a system where the energy is solely dependent on the number of particles, and each particle contributes an energy of $-\\mu$.\nThere are two ways to interpret the question's request for the partition function \"in the grand canonical ensemble\":\n1.  The chemical potential given in the Hamiltonian, $\\mu$, is the same as the reservoir's chemical potential. In this case, the operator in the exponent becomes $H - \\mu N = (-\\mu N) - \\mu N = -2\\mu N$.\n2.  The expression $H = -\\mu N$ is meant to be the *entire* grand canonical Hamiltonian operator, often denoted as $K = H_{sys} - \\mu_{res} N$. This is a more standard interpretation for textbook problems designed to test a specific calculation. Under this interpretation, we need to calculate:\n    $Z = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{-\\beta(-\\mu N)} \\right) = \\text{Tr} \\left( e^{\\beta \\mu N} \\right)$\n\nWe will proceed with the second, more direct interpretation as it is less ambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Formulating the Path Integral**\n\nThe trace of an operator $e^{-\\beta K}$ can be expressed as a functional path integral over fields $\\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$ that are periodic (for bosons) or anti-periodic (for fermions) in imaginary time $\\tau$ with period $\\beta$.\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\psi^*, \\psi] e^{-S[\\psi^*, \\psi]}$\nThe Euclidean action S is given by:\n$S[\\psi^*, \\psi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\psi^*(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\tau} + K \\right) \\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x})$\nIn our case, $K = -\\mu N$. In second quantization, the number operator $N$ is represented by $\\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\psi^* \\psi$. Therefore, the operator $K$ corresponds to the function $-\\mu \\psi^* \\psi$.\nThe action becomes:\n$S = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^d\\mathbf{x} \\, \\psi^* (\\partial_\\tau - \\mu) \\psi$\n\n**Step 4: Evaluating the Path Integral**\n\nWe evaluate the integral by expanding the field $\\psi$ in a Fourier basis (Matsubara modes). Since the problem doesn't specify statistics, we will assume the particles are **bosons**, which allows for any occupation number.\nThe field expansion is:\n$\\psi(\\tau, \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta V}} \\sum_{n, \\mathbf{k}} e^{i(\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} - \\omega_n \\tau)} \\psi_{n, \\mathbf{k}}$\nFor bosons, the fields are periodic, $\\psi(\\beta) = \\psi(0)$, which quantizes the Matsubara frequencies as $\\omega_n = 2\\pi n / \\beta$ for integer $n$.\nThe derivative term becomes $\\partial_\\tau \\psi \\rightarrow -i\\omega_n \\psi$. Substituting this into the action gives:\n$S = \\sum_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\psi^*_{n, \\mathbf{k}} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\psi_{n, \\mathbf{k}}$\nThe partition function is the integral over all Fourier modes:\n$Z = \\int \\left( \\prod_{n, \\mathbf{k}} d\\psi^*_{n,\\mathbf{k}} d\\psi_{n,\\mathbf{k}} \\right) \\exp\\left( - \\sum_{n, \\mathbf{k}} (-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\psi^*_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\psi_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\right)$\nThis separates into a product of Gaussian integrals:\n$Z = \\prod_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\int d\\psi^*_{n,\\mathbf{k}} d\\psi_{n,\\mathbf{k}} \\exp\\left( -(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\psi^*_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\psi_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\right)$\nFor complex bosonic variables, $\\int d\\phi^* d\\phi \\, e^{-A \\phi^* \\phi} \\propto 1/A$. Thus:\n$Z \\propto \\prod_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n - \\mu}$\nTaking the logarithm, we get the log-partition function (free energy):\n$\\ln Z = - \\sum_{n, \\mathbf{k}} \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\nThe Hamiltonian $H=-\\mu N$ has no dependence on momentum $\\mathbf{k}$ (no kinetic energy term), so all single-particle states have the same energy. The sum over $\\mathbf{k}$ counts the number of such degenerate states. For simplicity, we calculate the contribution from a single state, dropping the sum over $\\mathbf{k}$.\n$\\ln Z_{single\\_state} = - \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu)$\n\n**Step 5: Performing the Matsubara Summation**\n\nDirectly summing the logarithm is tricky due to divergence. A standard technique is to first differentiate with respect to $\\mu$, perform the simpler sum, and then integrate back.\n$\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Z)}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\left( - \\sum_n \\ln(-i\\omega_n - \\mu) \\right) = - \\sum_n \\frac{-1}{-i\\omega_n - \\mu} = \\sum_n \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n - \\mu}$\nThis sum can be evaluated using standard contour integration techniques for Matsubara sums. The result is:\n$\\sum_n \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n - \\mu} = \\frac{\\beta}{e^{-\\beta\\mu} - 1} = \\frac{\\beta e^{\\beta\\mu}}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\nNow, we integrate this result with respect to $\\mu$ to find $\\ln Z$:\n$\\ln Z = \\int \\frac{\\beta e^{\\beta\\mu}}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}} d\\mu$\nUsing the substitution $u = 1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}$, for which $du = -\\beta e^{\\beta\\mu} d\\mu$:\n$\\ln Z = \\int \\frac{-du}{u} = -\\ln(u) + C = -\\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}) + C$\nTo find the integration constant C, we consider a physical limit. As $\\mu \\to -\\infty$, particles become infinitely \"costly\", so the system will be in the vacuum state ($n=0$). In this limit, $Z$ should approach 1 (from $e^{\\beta \\mu \\cdot 0} = 1$), and $\\ln Z$ should approach 0.\n$\\lim_{\\mu\\to-\\infty} \\left(-\\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}) + C\\right) = -\\ln(1 - 0) + C = 0 + C$\nSince this must be 0, the constant C is 0.\nSo, we have:\n$\\ln Z = -\\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})$\n\n**Step 6: Final Answer**\n\nFrom the expression for $\\ln Z$, we find the partition function Z:\n$Z = e^{-\\ln(1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})} = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$\nThis result is valid when the geometric series converges, which requires $|e^{\\beta\\mu}| < 1$. Since $\\beta > 0$, this implies $\\mu < 0$.\n\n### List of Careful Points\n\n1.  **Interpretation of H:** The primary ambiguity is whether $H = -\\mu N$ is the system Hamiltonian or the full grand canonical operator. We chose the latter, more direct interpretation.\n2.  **Particle Statistics:** The calculation depends on whether particles are bosons or fermions. We assumed bosons, leading to a geometric series summation. For fermions, the result would be $Z_F = 1 + e^{\\beta\\mu}$.\n3.  **Single-State Calculation:** The given Hamiltonian implies all single-particle states are degenerate. The calculation shown is for one such state. For a system with `g` degenerate states, the total partition function would be $Z_{total} = Z^g = (1 - e^{\\beta\\mu})^{-g}$.\n4.  **Matsubara Summation:** This is a technical step requiring care. Using the derivative method simplifies the calculation and avoids divergent sums of logarithms.\n5.  **Convergence Condition:** The final expression is valid only under the condition that the chemical potential $\\mu$ is negative, ensuring the convergence of the underlying state sum.\n\n***\n\nThe final answer is $\\frac{1}{1 - e^{\\beta\\mu}}$.\n\n<<<1/(1-exp(beta*mu))>>>"
