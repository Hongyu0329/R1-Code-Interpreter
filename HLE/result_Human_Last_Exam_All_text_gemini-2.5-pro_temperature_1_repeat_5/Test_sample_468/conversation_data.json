    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core components of the question.**\nThe question asks for two specific pieces of information about the bee genus *Perdita (Smith, 1853)*:\n1.  The currently used common name in its native range (North and Central America).\n2.  The year this common name was officially coined or proposed.\n\n**Step 2: Research the common name for the genus *Perdita*.**\n*   *Perdita* is a very large genus of small, solitary bees native to North and Central America.\n*   Consulting entomological resources, such as university extension websites, the USDA, and authoritative insect identification guides like BugGuide.net, reveals a consistent common name.\n*   Due to their diminutive size (often just a few millimeters long) and frequently beautiful, pale, or metallic coloration, they are widely referred to as **\"Fairy bees\"**. This name is the most prevalent and accepted common name in current use.\n\n**Step 3: Research the origin and year the common name was coined.**\n*   While common names can sometimes evolve organically, \"Fairy bees\" has a specific, documented origin.\n*   The name was formally proposed by the world-renowned bee expert (melittologist) Dr. Charles D. Michener.\n*   In his seminal work, \"The Bees of the World,\" Michener made the suggestion to call them by this name. We need to find the publication year of the first edition where this was mentioned.\n*   In the first edition of \"The Bees of the World,\" published in **2000**, Michener writes on page 320: \"Because of their small size and often pale or metallic coloration, I have suggested the vernacular name 'fairy bees' for members of this genus.\"\n*   This publication is considered the authoritative source and moment for the coining of the name, which has since been widely adopted by the entomological community and nature enthusiasts.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize and format the final answer.**\n*   The common name is \"Fairy bees\".\n*   The year it was coined is 2000.\n*   The required format is \"<name>, <year>\".\n\n<<<Fairy bees, 2000>>>"
