No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). A material can only have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry (is non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry, thus forbidding the SPDC process.
