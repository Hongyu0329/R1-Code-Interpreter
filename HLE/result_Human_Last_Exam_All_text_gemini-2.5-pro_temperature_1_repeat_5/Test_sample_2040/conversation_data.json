    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Phenomenon: Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC)**\n\n*   **Definition:** SPDC is a nonlinear optical process where one high-energy photon (called the \"pump\" photon) interacts with a nonlinear crystal and spontaneously splits into two lower-energy photons (called the \"signal\" and \"idler\" photons).\n*   **Conservation Laws:** The process must conserve both energy and momentum.\n    *   Energy Conservation: `ω_pump = ω_signal + ω_idler`\n    *   Momentum Conservation (Phase-Matching): `k_pump = k_signal + k_idler`\n*   **Underlying Physics:** SPDC is a *second-order* nonlinear optical process. Its efficiency is governed by the material's second-order nonlinear susceptibility, denoted as χ⁽²⁾ (chi-two).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Core Requirement for SPDC**\n\n*   **The Crucial Prerequisite:** For a material to exhibit any second-order nonlinear optical effect, including SPDC, it **must** have a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾).\n*   **The Symmetry Rule:** A fundamental principle in nonlinear optics states that for a material to possess a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾, its crystal structure must **lack a center of inversion**. In other words, the material must be **non-centrosymmetric**. If a material has a center of inversion (is centrosymmetric), its bulk χ⁽²⁾ is identically zero due to symmetry considerations.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Material: Free-standing Boron Nanosheets (Borophene)**\n\n*   **Definition:** Boron nanosheets, also known as borophene, are two-dimensional (2D) single-atom-thick sheets of boron atoms.\n*   **Structure and Polymorphism:** Borophene can exist in several different atomic arrangements (polymorphs). Theoretical calculations and experimental synthesis have identified several stable or metastable phases.\n*   **Symmetry of Common Phases:** We need to examine the crystal symmetry of the most common and stable phases of free-standing borophene.\n    *   The most widely studied phases, such as the **β₁₂** and **χ₃** phases, which have been synthesized on silver substrates and are predicted to be stable in a free-standing form, belong to the orthorhombic crystal system with the space group *Pmmn*.\n    *   The space group *Pmmn* (No. 59) possesses a center of inversion. Therefore, these common phases of borophene are **centrosymmetric**.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the Analysis to Answer the Question**\n\n1.  SPDC is a second-order (χ⁽²⁾) nonlinear process.\n2.  Second-order processes are forbidden by symmetry in materials with a center of inversion (centrosymmetric materials).\n3.  The stable, common forms of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric.\n4.  Therefore, the bulk second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾) of free-standing boron nanosheets is zero.\n5.  **Conclusion:** Because their intrinsic χ⁽²⁾ is zero, free-standing boron nanosheets are not expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric down-conversion.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Free-standing vs. Substrate-supported:** The question specifies \"free-standing\". If the borophene were on a substrate, the interaction between the sheet and the substrate could break the inversion symmetry of the combined system, potentially allowing for a weak second-order response. However, for a free-standing sheet, this effect is absent.\n*   **Edge and Defect Effects:** While the bulk of the 2D crystal is centrosymmetric, the edges of a finite sheet or specific point defects locally break this symmetry. This could theoretically lead to a very weak, localized SPDC signal from the edges, but it would not be a property of the material itself and would be extremely inefficient compared to conventional SPDC crystals.\n*   **Higher-Order Processes:** Being centrosymmetric does not prevent borophene from exhibiting *third-order* nonlinear effects, which are governed by the third-order susceptibility (χ⁽³⁾). These include processes like third-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing. However, the question specifically asks about SPDC, which is strictly a second-order process.\n*   **Induced Effects:** Applying a strong external static electric field could artificially break the inversion symmetry and induce a second-order response. This is not an intrinsic property of the material under normal light excitation as implied by the question.\n\nBased on the fundamental symmetry properties of the material, the answer is a clear negative.\n\n<<<No, free-standing boron nanosheets would not be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion. This is because SPDC is a second-order nonlinear optical process that requires the material to have a non-zero second-order susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾). A material can only have a non-zero bulk χ⁽²⁾ if its crystal structure lacks inversion symmetry (is non-centrosymmetric). The common, stable phases of free-standing boron nanosheets are centrosymmetric, meaning their bulk χ⁽²⁾ is zero by symmetry, thus forbidding the SPDC process.>>>"
