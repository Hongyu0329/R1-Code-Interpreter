    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the total welfare.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n*   **Market Equilibrium:** This is the point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied ($Q_D = Q_S = Q_E$) and the price is the same for both curves ($P_D = P_S = P_E$).\n*   **Total Welfare (or Total Surplus):** This is the sum of Consumer Surplus (CS) and Producer Surplus (PS). It represents the total net benefit to society (consumers and producers) from the market's operation.\n*   **Consumer Surplus (CS):** The area under the demand curve and above the equilibrium price line, from Q=0 to Q=$Q_E$. Formula: $CS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} P_D(Q) \\,dQ - P_E \\cdot Q_E$.\n*   **Producer Surplus (PS):** The area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price line, from the quantity where supply starts to Q=$Q_E$. Formula: $PS = P_E \\cdot Q_E - \\int_{Q_{start}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) \\,dQ$.\n*   **Total Welfare Formula:** Adding CS and PS, the $P_E \\cdot Q_E$ terms cancel out.\n    $TW = CS + PS = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} P_D(Q) \\,dQ - \\int_{Q_{start}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) \\,dQ$.\n    This represents the total area between the demand and supply curves.\n\n**2. Analyze the Given Functions and Their Domains**\n*   **Demand Function:** $P_D = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q_D)}$\n    *   This function is defined for all non-negative quantities, $Q_D \\ge 0$.\n    *   It's a decreasing function, which is appropriate for a demand curve. The y-intercept (price at Q=0) is $P_D(0) = 18e^{-\\arctan(0)} = 18e^0 = 18$.\n*   **Supply Function:** $P_S = \\ln(Q_S^3 - 2)$\n    *   **Careful Point 1: Domain of Supply.** For the natural logarithm $\\ln(x)$ to be defined, its argument must be positive. Therefore, we must have $Q_S^3 - 2 > 0$, which implies $Q_S^3 > 2$, or $Q_S > \\sqrt[3]{2} \\approx 1.26$. The supply curve does not exist for quantities less than $\\sqrt[3]{2}$.\n    *   **Careful Point 2: Starting Point of Economic Supply.** Economically, supply begins at a non-negative price. We find the quantity where the supply price is zero: $P_S = 0 \\implies \\ln(Q_S^3-2) = 0 \\implies Q_S^3 - 2 = 1 \\implies Q_S^3 = 3 \\implies Q_S = \\sqrt[3]{3} \\approx 1.442$. This is the quantity, $Q_{start}$, from which we should calculate producer surplus.\n\n**3. Find the Market Equilibrium (Q_E, P_E)**\n*   Set the supply and demand prices equal: $\\ln(Q^3 - 2) = 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Non-Analytical Solution.** This equation is transcendental and cannot be solved for Q using standard algebraic methods. Finding the equilibrium point requires numerical methods (like using a graphing calculator's intersection feature or a computer algebra system).\n*   By solving numerically, we find the equilibrium quantity:\n    $Q_E \\approx 4.691$\n*   We can find the equilibrium price by substituting $Q_E$ into either function:\n    $P_E = \\ln((4.691)^3 - 2) = \\ln(103.2 - 2) = \\ln(101.2) \\approx 4.617$\n    Checking with the demand function confirms this: $P_E = 18e^{-\\arctan(4.691)} \\approx 18e^{-1.36} \\approx 4.617$.\n*   So, the equilibrium point is approximately $(Q_E, P_E) = (4.691, 4.617)$.\n\n**4. Formulate the Total Welfare Calculation**\n*   Total welfare is the area between the demand and supply curves. This can be calculated by finding the total area under the demand curve and subtracting the total area under the supply curve (within the relevant bounds).\n*   $TW = (\\text{Area under Demand}) - (\\text{Area under Supply})$\n*   $TW = \\int_{0}^{Q_E} P_D(Q) dQ - \\int_{\\sqrt[3]{3}}^{Q_E} P_S(Q) dQ$\n*   Plugging in the functions and values:\n    $TW = \\int_{0}^{4.691} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ - \\int_{1.442}^{4.691} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ$\n\n**5. Calculate the Definite Integrals**\n*   **Careful Point 4: Non-Elementary Integrals.** The antiderivatives of both $e^{-\\arctan(Q)}$ and $\\ln(Q^3 - 2)$ are not elementary functions. Thus, these definite integrals must also be calculated using numerical methods.\n*   **Integral 1 (Area under Demand):**\n    Using a numerical integrator, we find:\n    $\\int_{0}^{4.691} 18e^{-\\arctan(Q)} dQ \\approx 36.35$\n*   **Integral 2 (Area under Supply):**\n    Using a numerical integrator, we find:\n    $\\int_{1.442}^{4.691} \\ln(Q^3 - 2) dQ \\approx 9.78$\n\n**6. Find the Final Total Welfare**\n*   Subtract the area under the supply curve from the area under the demand curve:\n*   $TW \\approx 36.35 - 9.78 = 26.57$\n\nThe total welfare at market equilibrium is approximately 26.57.\n\n<<<26.57>>>"
