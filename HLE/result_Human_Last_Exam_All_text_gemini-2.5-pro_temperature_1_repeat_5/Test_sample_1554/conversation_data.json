    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify a specific philosopher associated with a particular philosophical school (Lviv-Warsaw School) and a specific conceptual analysis (decomposing \"hallmark\" into \"symptoms\" and \"signals\").\n\n2.  **Identify the Philosophical School:** The **Lviv-Warsaw School** was a highly influential school of logic and analytic philosophy active in Poland from the interwar period until the outbreak of World War II. It was founded by Kazimierz Twardowski and was known for its emphasis on clarity, rigor, and logical analysis, and its opposition to irrationalism in philosophy. Key members included Jan Łukasiewicz, Stanisław Leśniewski, Alfred Tarski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, and Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Conceptual Distinction:** The core of the question lies in the distinction between \"symptoms\" and \"signals\" as types of \"hallmarks\" or, more broadly, signs.\n    *   **Hallmark/Sign (Polish: *Znak* or *Znamie*):** This is the general category. It refers to an object, event, or property that indicates the existence of something else.\n    *   **Symptom (Natural Sign):** This is a type of sign that has a natural, often causal, connection to what it signifies. The relationship is discovered in nature, not created by convention.\n        *   *Careful Point:* A classic example is smoke being a symptom of fire. The presence of smoke is caused by the fire. A fever is a symptom of an illness. The relationship is objective and exists independently of human agreement.\n    *   **Signal (Conventional Sign):** This is a type of sign whose meaning is established by a rule, agreement, or convention. The relationship between the sign and what it signifies is arbitrary and created by humans.\n        *   *Careful Point:* A classic example is a red traffic light acting as a signal to stop. There is no natural reason why the color red must mean \"stop\"; it is a rule that we have agreed upon. Words in a language are also signals.\n\n4.  **Connect the Distinction to the School's Philosophers:** The task is to find which philosopher from the Lviv-Warsaw School made this specific analysis famous. This type of analysis—taking a common notion and breaking it down into precise logical categories—is characteristic of the school. The distinction falls under the field of semiotics (the theory of signs), epistemology, and philosophy of language.\n\n5.  **Identify the Correct Philosopher:** Within the Lviv-Warsaw School, the philosopher most famously associated with this particular semiotic distinction is **Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz**.\n    *   *Careful Point:* Ajdukiewicz developed a sophisticated theory of language and meaning. In his works, particularly in his highly influential textbook *Pragmatic Logic* (*Logika pragmatyczna*), he systematically analyzes the concept of a sign (*znak*). He explicitly differentiates between natural signs, which he calls **symptoms** (*oznaka* or *symptom*), and conventional signs, which are established by rules of meaning, i.e., **signals** or signs in the stricter sense (like words). This distinction was fundamental to his analysis of language, inference, and scientific methodology. While other members of the school were concerned with language and logic, this specific decomposition is a hallmark of Ajdukiewicz's work.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe analysis points directly to Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz as the philosopher who formulated this distinction. He was a central figure in the Lviv-Warsaw School, and his work in logic and philosophy of language includes the precise decomposition of the general idea of a sign or hallmark into natural signs (symptoms) and conventional signs (signals).\n\n<<<Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz>>>"
