    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Concepts\n\nFirst, we need to understand the two key concepts in the question: **critical-level views** and **Arrhenius's sixth impossibility theorem**.\n\n*   **Critical-Level Views:** This is a theory in population ethics for evaluating the goodness of different populations. It states that the value of a population is calculated by summing up the \"contributions\" of each individual. The contribution of an individual with welfare level *u* is not simply *u*, but rather (*u* - α), where α (alpha) is a fixed positive number called the \"critical level\".\n    *   If a person's welfare *u* is above the critical level α, their existence adds positive value to the world.\n    *   If a person's welfare *u* is exactly at the critical level α, their existence adds zero value.\n    *   If a person's welfare *u* is below the critical level α (even if it's positive, i.e., their life is worth living), their existence adds *negative* value to the world.\n\n*   **Arrhenius's Sixth Impossibility Theorem (also known as the \"Non-Elitism Theorem\"):** This theorem proves that it's impossible for any single theory of population ethics to satisfy a specific set of five conditions simultaneously. Any coherent theory must violate at least one of them. Our task is to figure out which one(s) critical-level views violate.\n\n### Step 2: List the Conditions of the Theorem\n\nLet's list and define the five conditions that Arrhenius's sixth theorem shows to be incompatible.\n\n1.  **Weak Quality Addition (E):** Adding a person with a positive welfare level (a life worth living, u > 0) to a population never makes the resulting population worse. It is at least as good as the original population.\n2.  **Non-Elitism (C):** There is no \"elite\" welfare level that is infinitely more valuable than slightly lower levels. Formally: For any welfare level *u*, there exists a lower welfare level *v* (*v* < *u*) such that for some number of people *n*, a population of *n* people all at level *v* is better than a population of one person at level *u*.\n3.  **Egalitarian Dominance (A):** If we have two populations of the same size, and every single person in population A is better off than their counterpart in population B, then population A is better than population B.\n4.  **Weak Non-Sadism (D):** Adding people with negative welfare (lives that are not worth living) to a population makes the outcome worse.\n5.  **General Non-Extreme Priority (B):** This is a weak technical condition stating that improving one person's life, holding all others constant, can make the world better.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Critical-Level Views Against Each Condition\n\nNow, let's see which of these conditions the critical-level view (CLV) violates. Let's assume a critical level α > 0.\n\n*   **Testing Egalitarian Dominance:** Let population A have *n* people at welfare *u*, and B have *n* people at welfare *v*, with *u* > *v*. The value of A is n*(u-α) and the value of B is n*(v-α). Since *u* > *v*, it is certain that n*(u-α) > n*(v-α). So, A is better than B.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* Egalitarian Dominance.\n\n*   **Testing Weak Non-Sadism:** Let's add a person with negative welfare (*u* < 0) to a population. Their contribution to the total value is (*u* - α). Since *u* is negative and α is positive, (*u* - α) is definitely a negative number. This makes the total value of the population decrease.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* Weak Non-Sadism.\n\n*   **Testing General Non-Extreme Priority:** If we increase one person's welfare from *u* to *v* (*v* > *u*), their contribution changes from (*u* - α) to (*v* - α). Since *v* > *u*, the new contribution is higher, and the total value of the population increases.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *satisfies* General Non-Extreme Priority.\n\n*   **Testing Non-Elitism:** Let's test this condition. We need to check if for any level *u*, we can find a *v* < *u* and an *n* such that *n* lives at *v* are better than one life at *u*.\n    *   Value of one life at *u*: (u - α)\n    *   Value of *n* lives at *v*: n * (v - α)\n    *   Let's pick the welfare level *u* to be exactly the critical level, *u* = α. The value of one life at this level is (α - α) = 0.\n    *   Now, we must find a *v* < α. For any such *v*, the contribution (v - α) will be a negative number. The total value of *n* lives at level *v* will be n * (v - α), which is also negative.\n    *   A state with a value of 0 is better than a state with a negative value. Therefore, it is impossible to find an *n* and *v* < α that would be better than the single life at *u* = α.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *violates* Non-Elitism.\n\n*   **Testing Weak Quality Addition:** This principle states that adding a person with *positive welfare* (u > 0) is never bad. Let's test this with CLV.\n    *   Imagine the critical level is α = 10.\n    *   Now, let's add a person with a welfare level of *u* = 5. This person has a life worth living (u > 0), so they have positive welfare.\n    *   According to CLV, the value of adding this person is (u - α) = (5 - 10) = -5.\n    *   Adding this person makes the total value of the population *worse*, even though their life is a happy one. This is a direct contradiction of Weak Quality Addition.\n    *   **Conclusion:** CLV *violates* Weak Quality Addition.\n\n### Step 4: Final Determination\n\nOur analysis shows that critical-level views violate two of the conditions: **Non-Elitism** and **Weak Quality Addition**. However, the question asks for a single condition. We must determine which violation is more fundamental or is considered the defining feature of the theory.\n\nThe entire purpose of introducing a critical level is to solve problems like Derek Parfit's \"Repugnant Conclusion,\" where Total Utilitarianism implies that a massive population of people with barely-worth-living lives can be better than a smaller, very happy population. Critical-level views block this conclusion precisely by rejecting the premise that adding a happy life is always neutral or good. They explicitly claim that adding a life that is \"not happy enough\" (i.e., below the critical level) is bad.\n\nThis rejection of the idea that adding any happy life is a good thing is a direct violation of **Weak Quality Addition**. This violation is the central, most discussed, and most defining feature of critical-level views. While they also violate Non-Elitism, that is a further consequence of their core structure. The violation of Weak Quality Addition is the main reason these theories were created.\n\n<<<E>>>"
