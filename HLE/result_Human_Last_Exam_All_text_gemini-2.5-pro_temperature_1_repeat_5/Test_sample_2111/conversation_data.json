    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Figures and Source:** The question centers on the historian Fernand Braudel, who is quoting the writer and diplomat Paul Morand. The context is Braudel's work on global history, specifically his magnum opus, *Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century*. The quote in question appears in the third volume, *The Perspective of the World*.\n\n2.  **Locate the Specific Quote:** The key to answering the question is finding the exact passage where Braudel quotes Morand. In Chapter 1 of *The Perspective of the World*, while discussing the nature of a \"world-economy\" (*économie-monde*), Braudel writes:\n    > \"Paul Morand was right to say that the world, a sphere, should have another inscribed within it: that of **money**.\"\n\n3.  **Identify the \"Conceptual Entity\":** Based on the direct quote, the conceptual entity that should be inscribed within the sphere of the world is explicitly stated as \"money\".\n\n4.  **Analyze the Metaphor:**\n    *   **The Outer Sphere:** This represents \"the world,\" which for Braudel means a \"world-economy\"—a large, self-sufficient economic zone with a core, a semi-periphery, and a periphery (e.g., the European world-economy centered on Venice, then Antwerp, then Amsterdam, then London).\n    *   **The Inner Sphere:** This is the entity that gives structure and life to the outer sphere. Braudel, citing Morand, identifies this entity as **money**. Money, credit, and financial networks are the circulatory system that connects all parts of the world-economy and allows it to function as a coherent whole.\n\n5.  **Reconcile with the \"Symbol of a Nation\" Clause:** The question states that this entity is \"exemplified by the symbol of a nation.\" This is a contextual detail that needs careful consideration.\n    *   In Braudel's analysis, \"nations\" or \"national economies\" are powerful players *within* the larger world-economy. A state often seeks to control its territory by creating a unified national market, frequently symbolized and managed by a national currency.\n    *   However, Braudel's key point is that the world-economy *transcends* individual nations. The \"money\" he refers to is not just a national currency but the dominant international currency and financial system of the era (like the Dutch florin or the British pound sterling) that operates across borders.\n    *   Therefore, while a nation's own money is an example of a monetary system, the entity Morand and Braudel are referring to is the broader, more abstract concept of **money/finance** as the organizing principle of the entire world-system, which contains and often overrides the economies of individual nations. The question's phrasing uses \"nation\" as an example of a system defined by its monetary symbol, but the core entity in the quote is money itself.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe step-by-step analysis of the original text by Fernand Braudel reveals that the specific conceptual entity he refers to, quoting Paul Morand, is **money**. This entity is the inner sphere that structures the larger sphere of the world-economy.\n\n<<<money>>>"
