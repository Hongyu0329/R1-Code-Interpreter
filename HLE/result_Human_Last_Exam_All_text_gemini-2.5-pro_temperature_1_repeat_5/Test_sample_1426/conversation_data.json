    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the lowest of the final three notes played by the first violin in Dvořák's Symphony No. 2.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Musical Piece and Section**\nThe question specifies \"Dvořák's Symphony no. 2, Op. 4\" and the part for the \"first violin\". We need to examine the very end of the fourth and final movement (Finale: Allegro con fuoco).\n\n**Step 2: Consult the Musical Score**\nTo find the notes, we must refer to the orchestral score of the symphony. We will look at the final measures for the staff labeled \"Violino I\".\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Final Measure for the First Violin**\nThe symphony concludes with a powerful final chord played by the full orchestra. Looking at the first violin part, we see that it does not end on three sequential notes. Instead, it ends by playing three notes simultaneously. This is a musical technique called a \"triple stop,\" where the violinist draws the bow across three strings at once to produce a chord. The phrase \"ends... on three notes\" refers to this final chord.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Pitches of the Final Chord**\nThe three notes written for the first violin in this final chord are:\n*   The highest note is B♭ (B-flat).\n*   The middle note is F.\n*   The lowest note is D.\n\nThese three notes (D, F, and B♭) together form a B-flat major chord, which is the home key of the symphony, providing a definitive conclusion.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Lowest Note**\nBy comparing the three notes of the final chord played by the first violin—D, F, and B♭—we can identify the one with the lowest pitch. In this case, the D is the lowest of the three.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n*   **Interpretation of \"three notes\":** It's crucial to understand this refers to a three-note chord (a triple stop) played as a single event, not three separate notes played one after another. The way the piece concludes makes the chord interpretation the only logical one.\n*   **Reading the Clef:** The first violin part is written in the treble clef. The notes on the staff must be read correctly to identify their pitches. The lowest note of the chord, D, is written on the fourth line of the treble clef staff.\n*   **Confirmation of the Piece:** Ensuring we are analyzing Symphony No. 2, Op. 4, is vital, as the ending could differ in his other symphonies. The B-flat major tonality of the final chord aligns with the symphony's key.\n\n<<<D>>>"
