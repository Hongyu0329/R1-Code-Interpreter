    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the statement.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Define SNP Heritability (h²_SNP):**\n    *   SNP heritability represents the proportion of the variation in a phenotype (e.g., height, risk for a disease) that can be explained by the additive effects of all common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome.\n    *   It is a theoretical, population-level parameter.\n    *   Crucially, it represents the *maximum possible* predictive power you could achieve if you had a perfect model that included all common SNPs and knew their *true* effect sizes. It is the theoretical ceiling for prediction using a linear model of SNPs.\n\n2.  **Define a Polygenic Score (PGS) and its Predictive Ability:**\n    *   A polygenic score is a practical tool used to predict an individual's phenotype. It is a single value calculated for an individual based on their genotype.\n    *   It is constructed by summing up the number of risk alleles an individual has for many SNPs, with each allele's contribution weighted by its estimated effect size.\n    *   These effect sizes are *not* the true, unknown effect sizes. They are *estimated* from a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) conducted on a finite sample of people.\n    *   The predictive ability of a PGS is measured by how well it correlates with the actual phenotype in an independent test sample. This is typically quantified as R², the proportion of variance in the phenotype that is explained by the PGS.\n\n3.  **Compare SNP Heritability and PGS Predictive Ability:**\n    *   The core difference is between a *theoretical maximum* (SNP heritability) and a *practical implementation* (PGS).\n    *   The PGS is an attempt to capture the signal represented by the SNP heritability, but it is inherently imperfect due to several real-world limitations.\n\n### Careful Points and Limitations of PGS\n\nThe predictive ability of a PGS is almost always lower than the SNP heritability because:\n\n1.  **Estimation Error in Effect Sizes:** GWAS are performed on finite samples. This means the estimated effect sizes (the weights used in the PGS) have statistical error and are not the true values. Larger GWAS discovery samples reduce this error, but it is never completely eliminated.\n2.  **Incomplete SNP Set:** A PGS is typically built using a subset of SNPs (e.g., those passing a certain statistical significance threshold), not all SNPs. Even if it uses all SNPs, it may miss the true causal variants and instead use SNPs that are merely in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with them.\n3.  **\"Winner's Curse\":** SNPs selected for inclusion in a PGS because they have the strongest statistical association in a discovery GWAS often have their effect sizes overestimated. This bias reduces the PGS's accuracy in a new, independent sample.\n4.  **Simplifying Assumptions:** The standard PGS model assumes that the effects of all SNPs are additive, which may not perfectly reflect the underlying biology (which could involve gene-gene interactions).\n5.  **Population Differences:** The PGS may be less accurate if the genetic ancestry of the test sample differs from that of the GWAS discovery sample.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBecause a polygenic score is built using imperfect, estimated information from a limited sample, its ability to explain phenotypic variance (its R²) cannot exceed the total variance that is theoretically explainable by all SNPs combined (the SNP heritability). The SNP heritability acts as a hard ceiling for the performance of any SNP-based linear predictor. While in a purely theoretical world with an infinitely large discovery sample one could construct a PGS whose predictive ability equals the SNP heritability, this is impossible in practice. Therefore, for any real-world application, the predictive ability of a PGS is necessarily lower than the SNP heritability.\n\nThe statement is **True**.\n\n<<<True>>>"
