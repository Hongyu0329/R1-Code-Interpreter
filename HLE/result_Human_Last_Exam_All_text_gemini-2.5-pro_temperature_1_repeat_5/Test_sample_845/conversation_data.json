    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Core Subject:** Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).\n    *   **Measurement Technology:** Photoplethysmography (PPG).\n    *   **Fundamental Data Captured:** \"beat-to-beat intervals\".\n    *   **The Specific Question:** \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats. What is that value called?\"\n\n2.  **Analyze the Premise:** The question states, \"HRV is computed as a value between heartbeats.\" This is a slight simplification. HRV is not a single value *between* two heartbeats. Instead, HRV is a set of metrics (like SDNN, RMSSD, etc.) calculated *from a series* of time durations between many consecutive heartbeats. The question is asking for the name of that fundamental time duration itself.\n\n3.  **Identify the Fundamental Measurement:**\n    *   The core of HRV analysis is measuring the precise time that elapses from one heartbeat to the next. This is the \"beat-to-beat interval\".\n    *   This interval is not constant; it varies slightly with each beat, and this variation is what HRV quantifies.\n\n4.  **Consider the Technology and Terminology:**\n    *   **Gold Standard (ECG):** The clinical gold standard for measuring heart activity is the Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG trace shows distinct electrical peaks for each heartbeat. The most prominent peak is called the 'R' wave. The time measured between two consecutive R-waves is called the **R-R Interval**. This is the most foundational and widely recognized term for the beat-to-beat interval.\n    *   **As per the Question (PPG):** The question specifies that a PPG sensor is used. PPG does not measure electrical activity. It measures changes in blood volume in the capillaries by shining light on the skin. This creates a pulse waveform. The time measured between the peaks of two consecutive pulse waves is technically called an **Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)** or a **Pulse-to-Pulse Interval (PPI)**.\n\n5.  **Connect the Terms and Select the Best Answer:**\n    *   The IBI measured by a PPG sensor is a very close proxy for the R-R interval measured by an ECG.\n    *   In the field of HRV, because the science was built upon ECG data, the term **R-R Interval** is often used as the standard, generic term for the beat-to-beat interval, even when the data is collected via PPG.\n    *   Therefore, while \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is technically more specific to PPG, the most common and universally understood name for the value used to compute HRV is the **R-R Interval**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **HRV vs. Interval:** Be clear that HRV is the *variability of the intervals* over time, not the interval itself. The question asks for the name of the interval.\n*   **ECG vs. PPG Terminology:** While \"R-R Interval\" comes from ECG, it has become the de facto standard term in HRV literature, even for PPG-derived data. \"Inter-Beat Interval (IBI)\" is a more precise term for PPG but might be considered more technical jargon.\n*   **Data Filtering (NN Interval):** For accurate HRV calculation, raw R-R intervals or IBIs are often filtered to remove artifacts or abnormal beats (like premature ventricular contractions). The resulting intervals between consecutive \"normal\" sinus beats are called **NN Intervals** (Normal-to-Normal). The actual HRV metrics are calculated from this cleaned-up series of NN intervals. So, \"NN Interval\" is also a correct, but more specific, answer.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most fundamental and widely accepted name for the time value measured between consecutive heartbeats for the purpose of HRV analysis is the R-R Interval.\n\n<<<R-R Interval"
