**Appropriate Management Procedures:**

**Phase 1: Immediate/Emergency Management (First 24-48 Hours)**
1.  **Medical Consultation:** Immediate referral to a physician to begin management of her uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c 7.5%) with appropriate medication to lower blood glucose.
2.  **Systemic Support:** Administration of prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics and a tetanus booster.
3.  **Dental/Surgical Treatment:** After local anesthesia, the sockets of the avulsed teeth will be gently debrided and irrigated with sterile saline. A conservative alveoloplasty will be performed to smooth any sharp bone while preserving maximum bone volume. The soft tissue will be sutured for primary closure to promote healing. Radiographs (preferably a CBCT) are mandatory to assess the full extent of alveolar bone damage.
4.  **Instructions:** The patient will be given instructions for a soft diet, pain management, and use of a chlorhexidine mouthwash.

**Phase 2: Healing & Definitive Planning (Next 3-6 Months)**
1.  **Continued Medical Care:** The patient must achieve and maintain good glycemic control (HbA1c < 7.0%) before definitive treatment.
2.  **Provisional Restoration:** An interim removable partial denture will be fabricated for esthetics and to prevent tooth movement during the healing period.
3.  **Definitive Treatment:** The most appropriate long-term solution is a Removable Partial Denture (RPD), as implants are contraindicated by the uncontrolled diabetes and high biomechanical risk from the Class III occlusion, and a fixed bridge is biomechanically unsound.

**Cells of Interest:**
The key cells involved in the healing of the tooth sockets are: **Platelets, Neutrophils, Macrophages, Fibroblasts, Osteoblasts, Osteoclasts, and Endothelial cells.**

**Denture Replacement Details:**

*   **Type of Denture:** A **Cast Metal Framework Removable Partial Denture (RPD)**.
*   **Material:** A **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy** framework with **acrylic resin** teeth and a denture base.
*   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
    *   **Abutments:** The design will utilize teeth on both sides of the arch for stability. Key abutments will be the **left second premolar**, the **right canine**, and a **right molar**.
    *   **Reasoning:** A design incorporating **cross-arch stabilization** is essential. The severe Class III skeletal pattern (SNB 88Â°) will create heavy, potentially damaging forces. Using abutments on the opposite side of t
