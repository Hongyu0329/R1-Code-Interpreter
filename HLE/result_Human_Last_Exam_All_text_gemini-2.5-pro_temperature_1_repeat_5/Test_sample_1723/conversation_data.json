    "This question is a classic piece of mycological trivia that hinges on a common misconception. Here is a step-by-step analysis to arrive at the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Core of the Question:** The question asks for a specific mushroom genus, with the defining characteristic being a \"distinctly blue spore print.\" A spore print is the colored deposit of spores left on a surface, a crucial feature for mushroom identification.\n\n2.  **Consult Mycological Facts:** We first need to check standard mycological knowledge about spore print colors. The typical range of spore print colors includes white, cream, yellow, ochre, pink/salmon, various shades of brown (from cinnamon to dark chocolate), purple-brown, and black. Notably, a true, distinct blue is not listed as a standard spore print color in any major mycological field guide or textbook. This suggests the premise of the question may be flawed.\n\n3.  **Investigate \"Blue\" Mushrooms:** Since a blue spore print is not a recognized feature, the question likely refers to a genus famous for its blue color in other aspects, leading to the popular (but incorrect) belief that its spores are also blue. Let's examine the main candidates:\n    *   **Genus *Entoloma***: This genus includes some brilliantly blue mushrooms, like New Zealand's *Entoloma hochstetteri*. However, the entire *Entoloma* genus is defined by its characteristic pink, angular spores. Their spore print is pink, not blue.\n    *   **Genus *Gyroporus***: This genus includes species like *Gyroporus cyanescens*, which stains an intense blue color almost instantly when cut or bruised. Despite this dramatic color change, its spore print is consistently pale yellow.\n    *   **Genus *Lactarius***: This genus is the most likely candidate for the intended answer. It contains the species *Lactarius indigo*. This mushroom is remarkable for being blue through-and-through: its cap, gills, and stem are all shades of blue, and when damaged, it exudes an indigo-blue latex or \"milk.\" Because of this pervasive and striking blue color, it is the mushroom most famously and completely associated with blue.\n\n4.  **Resolve the Discrepancy:** While *Lactarius indigo* is profoundly blue, its spore print is actually cream to pale yellow. However, because the question asks what genus is \"*known*\" to produce a blue spore print, it may be referencing popular knowledge or a common misconception rather than a strict scientific fact. The strong and famous association of *Lactarius indigo* with the color blue makes *Lactarius* the most common and accepted answer to this trivia question, despite the technical inaccuracy.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Mushroom Color vs. Spore Print Color:** It is crucial not to confuse the color of the mushroom's body (the fruitbody) with the color of its spores. Many mushrooms have colors that are completely different from their spore prints.\n*   **Color-Changing Properties:** Bruising reactions (like the blue staining in *Gyroporus*) are also separate from spore color. This is a chemical reaction in the mushroom's flesh, not an indicator of spore pigmentation.\n*   **The Nature of Trivia:** This question is a good example of trivia that lives in the space between fact and popular belief. The most \"correct\" scientific answer would be \"no such genus exists,\" but the most likely \"intended\" answer for the question as posed is the genus that is the source of the myth.\n\nBased on this analysis, the single genus that is widely, though incorrectly, \"known\" for having a blue spore print due to its iconic blue species is *Lactarius*.\n\n<<<Lactarius>>>"
