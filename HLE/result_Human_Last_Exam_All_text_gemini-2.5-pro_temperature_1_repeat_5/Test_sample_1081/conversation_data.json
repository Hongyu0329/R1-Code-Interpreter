    "This problem asks for the number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori in a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis to determine this number.\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the question\nThe phrase \"the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori\" can be ambiguous. It could mean:\na) The total number of subgroups of $G$ that are $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\nb) The number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori.\n\nThe total number of such tori (option a) is given by a complicated polynomial in $q$, which depends on the structure of the centralizers of elements in the Weyl group. The phrase \"the exact number\" strongly suggests a single integer value, independent of $q$. In the context of the theory of reductive groups over finite fields, this standardly refers to the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of such tori. We will proceed with this well-established interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: The classification of rational maximal tori\nThere is a fundamental theorem in the theory of reductive groups over finite fields that classifies the rational maximal tori. Let $G$ be a connected reductive group defined over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $F: G \\to G$ be the corresponding Frobenius endomorphism. The set of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of $G$ is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of $F$-conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$ of $G$.\n\nAn **$F$-conjugacy class** in $W$ is an equivalence class defined by the relation: $w_1 \\sim w_2$ if there exists an element $x \\in W$ such that $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$.\n\n### Step 3: Determining the structure of G and the action of the Frobenius endomorphism\nThe group $G$ is of type $E_8$. We need to determine if it is a split or twisted form. The classification of forms of a simple algebraic group over a field $k$ is related to the Galois cohomology group $H^1(k, \\text{Out}(G))$, where $\\text{Out}(G)$ is the group of outer automorphisms of $G$.\n\n1.  The Dynkin diagram of type $E_8$ has no non-trivial symmetries. This implies that the outer automorphism group $\\text{Out}(G)$ for a group $G$ of type $E_8$ is trivial.\n2.  Since $\\text{Out}(G)$ is trivial, the cohomology group $H^1(\\mathbb{F}_q, \\text{Out}(G))$ is also trivial.\n3.  This means that there is only one form of a group of type $E_8$ over any field, which must be the **split form**.\n\nFor a split group over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, the Frobenius endomorphism $F$ acts trivially on the root datum (the root system and the Weyl group). Therefore, the action of $F$ on the Weyl group $W$ is the identity map, i.e., $F(w) = w$ for all $w \\in W$.\n\n### Step 4: Simplifying the problem\nWith the Frobenius action being trivial, the $F$-conjugacy relation $w_2 = x w_1 F(x)^{-1}$ simplifies to $w_2 = x w_1 x^{-1}$. This is the standard definition of a conjugacy class in the group $W$.\n\nTherefore, the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of ordinary conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W(E_8)$.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the number of conjugacy classes of W(E8)\nThe problem is now reduced to finding a known property of the Weyl group for the root system $E_8$, denoted $W(E_8)$. This is a finite group of order $|W(E_8)| = 696,729,600$.\n\nThe number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl groups of exceptional type was first calculated by R.W. Carter in his paper \"Conjugacy classes in the Weyl group\" (Compositio Mathematica, 1972). For the Weyl group $W(E_8)$, the number of conjugacy classes was determined to be 112. This is now a standard result in the theory of reflection groups and can be verified using computational algebra systems like GAP or Magma.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a group of type $E_8$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, interpreted as the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes, is independent of $q$ and is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in the Weyl group $W(E_8)$. This number is 112.\n\n<<<112>>>"
