    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the etymological development of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) verb `*seh₂g-ie/ti`.\n\n### **Step 1: Analyze the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) Form**\n\n*   **Form:** `*seh₂g-ie/ti`\n*   **Root:** `*seh₂g-`. This is an e-grade root. The key components are:\n    *   `s`: The initial sibilant.\n    *   `e`: An e-grade vowel.\n    *   `h₂`: The second laryngeal consonant. Its primary effects are to \"color\" an adjacent `*e` to an `*a` and to lengthen a preceding vowel upon its loss in most daughter languages (except Anatolian).\n    *   `g`: A voiced velar stop.\n*   **Suffix:** `-ie/ti`. This is a thematic present tense suffix (`*-ye/o-`) with a third-person singular ending (`-ti`). This suffix is often used for stative or iterative verbs and typically leads to the formation of Class I weak verbs in Germanic.\n*   **Early Development:** The sequence `*eh₂` before a consonant resolves to a long `*ā` in pre-Germanic. Therefore, the PIE root `*seh₂g-` becomes `*sāg-` for the purposes of tracing its development into Germanic. The Latin cognate `sāgīre` confirms this `*ā` vowel.\n\n### **Step 2: From PIE `*sāg-` to Proto-Germanic (PGmc)**\n\nWe start with the pre-Germanic form `*sāg-` combined with the present tense suffix `*-ye/o-`.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Grimm's Law (First Germanic Sound Shift).** This law affects all PIE stops. The relevant change here is for voiced stops:\n    *   PIE `*g` becomes PGmc `*k`.\n    *   Therefore, `*sāg-` becomes `*sāk-`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Verner's Law.** This law voices the fricatives produced by Grimm's Law if the original PIE accent was not on the syllable immediately preceding the consonant. However, it applies to the outputs of PIE `*p, *t, *k` (which become fricatives), not PIE `*b, *d, *g` (which become voiceless stops). Thus, Verner's Law does not apply to the `*k` from `*g`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Vowel Shifts.** PIE vowels underwent regular changes in Proto-Germanic.\n    *   PIE `*ā` becomes PGmc `*ō`.\n    *   Therefore, the root `*sāk-` becomes `*sōk-`.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Verb Conjugation Class.** The PIE `*-ye/o-` suffix forms Class I weak verbs in Germanic. The infinitive form for this class is constructed with the suffix `*-janą`.\n*   **Proto-Germanic Reconstruction:** Combining the root `*sōk-` with the suffix `*-janą`, we get the infinitive **`*sōkijaną`** (meaning 'to seek, look for').\n\n### **Step 3: From PGmc `*sōkijaną` to the Daughter Languages**\n\nNow we trace the development of `*sōkijaną` into Old Norse, Old English, and Old High German. The `*j` in the suffix is crucial as it triggers i-umlaut (or i-mutation).\n\n#### **A. Old Norse (ON)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: i-Umlaut.** The `*j` in the following syllable causes the back vowel `*ō` in the root to be fronted.\n    *   PGmc `*ō` becomes ON `ǿ` (often written `œ`).\n    *   `*sōk-` becomes `sǿk-`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Suffix and Ending.** The PGmc infinitive ending `*-aną` becomes `-a` in Old Norse. The `*j` of the suffix is retained.\n*   **Old Norse Result:** Combining the parts, `*sōkijaną` becomes **`sǿkja`**.\n\n#### **B. Old English (OE)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: i-Umlaut.** The `*j` causes fronting of the root vowel.\n    *   PGmc `*ō` becomes OE `ē` (via an intermediate stage `*œ̄`).\n    *   `*sōk-` becomes `sēc-`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Loss of `*j`.** In Old English, the `*j` that caused the umlaut is lost after a heavy syllable (a syllable with a long vowel or ending in two consonants). `sēc-` is a heavy syllable.\n*   **Careful Point 3: Palatalization.** The velar stop `*k` is generally not palatalized to `ċ` (/tʃ/) by a following front vowel if that vowel is the result of i-umlaut and the original `*j` has been lost. Thus, the `c` in `sēcan` represents a /k/ sound.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Infinitive Ending.** The PGmc `*-aną` becomes `-an`.\n*   **Old English Result:** `*sōkijaną` > `*sōkjan` > `*sœ̄can` > **`sēcan`**.\n\n#### **C. Old High German (OHG)**\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Vowel Breaking.** Before i-umlaut could consistently take effect in all paradigms, PGmc `*ō` \"broke\" into the diphthong `uo` in Old High German.\n    *   PGmc `*ō` becomes OHG `uo`.\n*   **Careful Point 2: Lack of i-Umlaut in the Infinitive.** In many Class I weak verbs with long syllables, the `*j` was lost early in OHG before it could trigger i-umlaut in forms like the infinitive. Therefore, the `uo` remains un-fronted.\n    *   `*sōk-` becomes `suoh-`.\n*   **Careful Point 3: High German Consonant Shift (Second Sound Shift).** This is the most distinctive feature of OHG.\n    *   PGmc `*k` becomes the fricative `hh` [xx] (orthographically `hh` or `ch`) after a vowel.\n    *   So `*suok-` becomes `suohh-` or `suoch-`.\n*   **Careful Point 4: Infinitive Ending.** The PGmc `*-aną` becomes `-en` or `-an`.\n*   **Old High German Result:** `*sōkijaną` > `*suokjan` > **`suohhen`** (or `suohhan`).\n\n### **Final Answer Summary**\n\n*   **Proto-Germanic:** `*sōkijaną`\n*   **Old Norse:** `sǿkja`\n*   **Old English:** `sēcan`\n*   **Old High German:** `suohhen`\n\n<<<Proto-Germanic: *sōkijaną; Old Norse: sǿkja; Old English: sēcan; Old High German: suohhen>>>"
