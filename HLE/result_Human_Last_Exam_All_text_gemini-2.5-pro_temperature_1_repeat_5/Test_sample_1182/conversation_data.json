    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ above the prime 2.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nWe are given a hyperelliptic curve defined over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We need to find the number of ordinary double points (nodes) in its stable reduction modulo the prime $p=2$. The stable reduction is a simplified, well-behaved version of the curve over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_2$, obtained through a sequence of transformations and blow-ups. The number of double points is an important invariant that measures how \"badly\" the curve reduces modulo 2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Curve and its Genus**\nThe curve is given by the equation $C: y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is a hyperelliptic curve. The genus of a hyperelliptic curve $y^2 = f(x)$ is given by the formula $g = \\lfloor \\frac{\\deg(f) - 1}{2} \\rfloor$.\nHere, the degree of the polynomial $f(x)$ is $d=5$.\nSo, the genus of the curve $C$ is $g = \\lfloor \\frac{5-1}{2} \\rfloor = 2$.\n\n**Step 3: Find a Minimal Model**\nThe initial equation is a model of the curve over the integers $\\mathbb{Z}$. To analyze the reduction correctly, we should first find a minimal model. A minimal model is one where the valuation of the discriminant is as small as possible. We use transformations of the form $x = u^k X, y = u^m Y$. For hyperelliptic curves over a field of characteristic 2, we can simplify the model using the transformation $(x,y) \\to (2X, 2Y)$.\nLet the original polynomial be $f_0(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\nThe transformation gives $(2y)^2 = f_0(2x) \\implies 4y^2 = f_0(2x)$. For this to yield a new integral model $y^2=f_1(x)$, $f_0(2x)$ must be divisible by 4.\n$f_0(2x) = 8(32x^5) + 4(16x^4) + 4(8x^3) + (4x^2) + 8(2x) = 256x^5 + 64x^4 + 32x^3 + 4x^2 + 16x$.\nThis is divisible by 4. So we get a new model:\n$y^2 = f_1(x) = f_0(2x)/4 = 64x^5 + 16x^4 + 8x^3 + x^2 + 4x$.\nThis model is isomorphic to the first over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. We repeat this process.\n$f_1(2x) = 64(32x^5) + 16(16x^4) + 8(8x^3) + (4x^2) + 4(2x) = 2048x^5 + 256x^4 + 64x^3 + 4x^2 + 8x$.\nThis is divisible by 4. The next model is:\n$y^2 = f_2(x) = f_1(2x)/4 = 512x^5 + 64x^4 + 16x^3 + x^2 + 2x$.\nRepeat again:\n$f_2(2x) = 512(32x^5) + 64(16x^4) + 16(8x^3) + (4x^2) + 2(2x) = 16384x^5 + 1024x^4 + 128x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x$.\nThis is divisible by 4. The final model is:\n$y^2 = f_3(x) = f_2(2x)/4 = 4096x^5 + 256x^4 + 32x^3 + x^2 + x$.\nFurther transformations of this type do not yield models with integer coefficients, so this is our minimal model for the purpose of this analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the Reduction of the Minimal Model**\nWe now reduce the equation of the minimal model modulo 2.\n$y^2 \\equiv (4096x^5 + 256x^4 + 32x^3 + x^2 + x) \\pmod 2$\n$y^2 \\equiv 0x^5 + 0x^4 + 0x^3 + x^2 + x \\pmod 2$\nThe reduced curve over $\\mathbb{F}_2$ is $\\tilde{C}: y^2 = x^2 + x$.\nIn characteristic 2, this can be written as $y^2 + x^2 + x = 0$, or $(y+x)^2 = x$.\nLet $z = y+x$. The equation becomes $z^2=x$. This is the equation of a parabola, which is a smooth, rational curve (genus 0).\n\n**Step 5: Relate Genus Drop to the Number of Double Points**\nThe original curve has genus $g=2$. The reduction of its minimal model is a smooth curve of genus $g_{red}=0$. The genus drops by $g - g_{red} = 2 - 0 = 2$.\nWhen the stable reduction of a curve is an irreducible rational curve (a $\\mathbb{P}^1$), its arithmetic genus is equal to the number of double points on it. The theory of stable reduction states that the arithmetic genus of the stable reduction is equal to the genus of the original curve.\nTherefore, the stable reduction must have an arithmetic genus of 2. For an irreducible rational curve, this means it must have acquired 2 double points.\nThis argument holds if the stable reduction is irreducible. The polynomial $f_3(x) \\pmod 2$ is $x^2+x=x(x+1)$, which has two distinct roots, 0 and 1. This type of reduction, where the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve fall into two distinct clusters, leads to a stable reduction consisting of two rational components meeting at a certain number of points. However, a more detailed analysis of the point at infinity reveals that all branch points effectively cluster together.\nA more direct argument comes from analyzing the singularities of the model. The minimal Weierstrass model found in Step 3 is singular at the point at infinity when considered as a scheme over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. The resolution of this singularity in the special fiber leads to a configuration of rational curves whose total arithmetic genus is 2. The simplest such configuration which arises in this context is a chain of three rational curves, which has 2 nodes.\n\n**Step 6: Conclusion**\nThe drop in genus from the original curve ($g=2$) to the geometric genus of the reduced curve ($g_{red}=0$) is a strong indicator of the number of double points. In many cases, especially in bad reduction, the number of nodes in the stable reduction is precisely this drop in genus.\nNumber of double points $\\delta = g - g_{geom}(\\text{reduction}) = 2 - 0 = 2$.\n\nThe stable reduction consists of a configuration of curves (likely rational curves, i.e., copies of $\\mathbb{P}^1$) whose total arithmetic genus is 2. A simple configuration with arithmetic genus 2 is a rational curve with two double points. Another is a chain of three rational curves connected at two double points. Both scenarios lead to the same conclusion.\n\nFinal Answer: The number of double points is 2."
