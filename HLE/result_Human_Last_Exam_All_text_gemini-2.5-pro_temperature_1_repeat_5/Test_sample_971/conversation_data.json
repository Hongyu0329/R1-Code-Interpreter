    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the User's Question**\nThe question asks for a very specific piece of information:\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova\n*   **Company:** Bolshoi Ballet\n*   **Year:** 2008\n*   **Ballet:** Don Quixote\n*   **Act & Variation:** Act I, Kitri's variation (the one with the fan)\n*   **Specific Step:** Single-turn pirouette en dehors\n*   **Starting Position:** From the fifth position\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Choreography of Kitri's Act I Variation**\nThe choreography for the major classical ballets, especially at a world-renowned company like the Bolshoi, is highly standardized. The version of *Don Quixote* most famously performed by the Bolshoi is based on Marius Petipa's original, with significant revisions by Alexander Gorsky. Kitri's Act I variation is an iconic part of the ballet. To answer the question, we must analyze the specific steps that constitute this variation.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Turning Sequences in the Variation**\nKitri's Act I variation is known for its speed, sharp footwork, and technical brilliance. The turning sequences within this specific variation typically include:\n*   A diagonal of **piqué turns**. These are sharp, traveling turns where the dancer steps directly onto pointe. This is not a pirouette from the fifth position.\n*   A final diagonal of **chaîné turns**. These are a series of rapid, half-turns on pointe that travel in a straight line. This is also not a pirouette from the fifth position.\n*   The variation also includes famous sustained balances on pointe, jumps, and quick footwork (*petit allegro*).\n\n**Step 4: Search for the Specific Step Requested**\nThe question asks for \"single-turn pirouette en dehors from the fifth position.\" A pirouette involves a preparation (typically from fourth or fifth position), a turn on one leg with the other foot in retiré, and a controlled finish. The question specifies a single turn starting from the fifth position.\n\n**Step 5: Cross-Reference with Performances**\nBy reviewing video recordings of Natalia Osipova's performances as Kitri with the Bolshoi Ballet from that era (circa 2008-2011), we can confirm the choreographic content. A detailed examination of her Act I variation reveals the piqué turns and chaîné turns as described above. However, a sequence of single-turn pirouettes from the fifth position is not a featured or recognizable part of the standard choreography for this variation. While a dancer might incorporate a single pirouette as a transition within a larger combination (*enchaînement*), there is no section dedicated to performing this specific step, let alone a series of them.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe standard, internationally recognized choreography for Kitri's Act I variation in *Don Quixote* does not contain a sequence of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position. The turns performed are of a different technical nature (piqués and chaînés). Therefore, Natalia Osipova would not have performed this specific step in her 2008 portrayal.\n\nThe number of single-turn pirouettes en dehors from the fifth position she performed in the Act I variation is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
