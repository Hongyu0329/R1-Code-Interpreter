    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the worst suited jack to open from the button.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Scenario's Key Factors**\n\n*   **Position: Button (BTN)**. This is the most powerful position in poker. You are guaranteed to act last on every post-flop street, which gives you a significant informational advantage. This allows you to play the widest range of hands profitably.\n*   **Stack Size: 100 Big Blinds (BB)**. This is a standard \"deep\" stack size. It means implied odds are important; you can win a large pot if you hit a strong hand like a straight or a flush.\n*   **Action: Open to 2.5x**. This is a standard opening size that balances building a pot with not risking too much with your wider range.\n*   **Game Type: Rake-Free Cash Game**. This is a crucial and unusual condition. In most games, a percentage of the pot (the rake) is taken by the house. The absence of rake means there is no \"penalty\" for seeing a flop. You are incentivized to play more hands that perform well post-flop, as you get to keep 100% of any pot you win. Hands that realize their equity well (like suited hands making flushes) become more valuable.\n*   **Hand Type: Suited Jack (JXs)**. We are evaluating hands like J9s, J8s, J7s, etc., to find the weakest one that should still be in our opening range.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate the Playability of Suited Jacks**\n\nSuited hands derive their value from their ability to make flushes (a very strong hand) and, for connected cards, straights. Let's rank the lower suited Jacks in descending order of strength:\n\n*   **J9s:** A strong suited connector. Excellent straight and flush potential. A clear open from any late position.\n*   **J8s:** A suited one-gapper. Still has very good straight and flush potential. A standard open.\n*   **J7s:** A suited two-gapper. The straight potential lessons slightly, but it's still a highly playable hand from the button. A standard open.\n*   **J6s & J5s:** These suited gappers have decreasing straight potential but still retain their flush-making ability. Given the power of the button, these are still considered standard opens in most modern strategies.\n*   **J4s, J3s, J2s:** These are the weakest suited Jacks. Their value comes almost exclusively from making a flush, a pair of Jacks (with a very weak kicker), or two pair. Their straight potential is minimal.\n\n**Step 3: Consider the Impact of the Rake-Free Environment**\n\nIn a standard game with rake, the weakest hands in your range (like J3s or J2s) might be break-even or slightly losing opens because when you win a small pot, the rake eats into your profit. However, in a **rake-free** environment, even a tiny edge becomes a pure profit. This pushes the boundaries of a profitable opening range wider. Hands that were marginal now become clear opens. The ability to see a flop with a hand that can make the nuts (like a flush) without paying a tax on the pot makes all suited hands more valuable.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Bottom of the Range**\n\nGame Theory Optimal (GTO) solvers have shown that from the button at 100BB, the opening range is extremely wide (often 45-50% of hands).\n\n*   In a standard (raked) game, the range might stop at J4s or J3s, with J2s often being a fold.\n*   In the **rake-free** game we are analyzing, the profitability threshold is lower. The combination of being in the most powerful position (Button) and having no rake makes it profitable to open *all* suited Jack combinations. The EV (Expected Value) of opening J2s is higher than folding, even if only by a small margin.\n*   Since the strategy dictates opening the entire suited Jack series (from JTs down to J2s), the \"worst\" hand in that group is the one with the lowest raw equity and playability. This is objectively **J2s**. It has the largest gap, making straights nearly impossible, and the lowest kicker, which is a liability when you make a pair of Jacks.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the powerful positional advantage of the button and the enhanced value of suited hands in a rake-free environment, a theoretically sound strategy involves opening all suited Jacks. The weakest hand in this category, and therefore the worst one you should open, is J2s.\n\n<<<J2s>>>"
