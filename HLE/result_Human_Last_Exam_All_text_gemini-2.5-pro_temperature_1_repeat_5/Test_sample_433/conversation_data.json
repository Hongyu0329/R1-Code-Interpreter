    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Components of the Question:**\n    *   **Product:** A single-dose container ampule.\n    *   **Action:** Punctured (opened).\n    *   **Environment:** A sterile environment (interpreted as an ISO Class 5 or cleaner environment, such as a laminar airflow workbench).\n    *   **Question:** What is the Beyond-Use Date (BUD)?\n\n2.  **Define the Terms:**\n    *   **Beyond-Use Date (BUD):** The date and/or time after which a compounded sterile preparation (CSP) shall not be stored or transported. It is determined from the date/time the preparation is compounded. Its purpose is to limit the risk of microbial growth, degradation of the drug, or other contamination.\n    *   **Single-Dose Container (SDC):** A container of a sterile medication for parenteral administration that is not required to have an antimicrobial preservative. It is intended for use in a single patient for a single procedure.\n    *   **Ampule:** A specific type of SDC made of glass that is hermetically sealed. It must be broken at the neck to be opened. Once opened, it cannot be resealed.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Specific Container Type (Ampule):**\n    *   The fact that the container is an **ampule** is the most critical piece of information. Unlike a vial with a rubber stopper (elastomeric closure) that can maintain a barrier against the outside environment after the initial puncture, an ampule is an open container once it is broken.\n    *   Because it cannot be resealed, its contents are directly exposed to the air within the sterile environment. This creates a significant and ongoing risk of contamination.\n\n4.  **Apply Aseptic Principles and USP <797> Guidelines:**\n    *   USP General Chapter <797> provides guidelines for sterile compounding. While it specifies that a single-dose *vial* punctured within an ISO Class 5 environment can be used for up to 12 hours, this rule applies specifically to containers with resealable stoppers.\n    *   For an **ampule**, the standard and safe practice is different due to its open nature. The risk of contamination is too high to allow for storage after opening.\n    *   Therefore, established aseptic technique and safety principles dictate that the contents must be withdrawn and used immediately after the ampule is opened.\n\n5.  **Conclusion on the BUD:**\n    *   There is no extended BUD for an opened ampule, even in a sterile environment.\n    *   The medication must be withdrawn and used right away.\n    *   Any portion of the medication remaining in the ampule after the dose is drawn must be discarded immediately and cannot be saved for later use. The \"BUD\" is effectively instantaneous.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ampule vs. Vial:** Do not confuse the rules for an ampule with those for a single-dose vial. A single-dose vial has a resealable stopper and a 12-hour BUD after puncture in an ISO 5 environment. An ampule does not.\n2.  **\"Sterile Environment\" Importance:** Opening the ampule outside of a sterile (ISO Class 5) environment would make the requirement for immediate use even more critical and absolute.\n3.  **\"Single-Dose\" Implication:** Single-dose containers lack preservatives, which is why strict time limits are in place to prevent microbial growth after the container is breached.\n4.  **No Storage:** The key takeaway is that opened ampules cannot be stored for any period. The term \"discard any unused portion\" is a standard directive for this type of container.\n\n***\n\n<<<An opened ampule must be used immediately, and any unused portion must be discarded. It cannot be stored for any length of time.>>>"
