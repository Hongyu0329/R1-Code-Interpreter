    "Answering this question requires several steps from representation theory of algebras, specifically for path algebras.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Algebra and its Module Category**\nThe algebra $A=\\mathbb{C}(1\\to2\\to3)$ is the path algebra of the quiver $Q: 1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. This is a finite-dimensional, hereditary algebra of type $A_3$. The category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules, denoted mod-A, is what we are interested in.\n\nThe indecomposable A-modules can be described by their support on the vertices $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Let $M_{i,j}$ be the unique indecomposable module whose support is the interval of vertices $[i, j] = \\{i, i+1, \\ldots, j\\}$. The indecomposable $A$-modules are:\n1.  $S_1 = M_{1,1}$: The simple module at vertex 1. Dimension vector $(1,0,0)$. This is also the injective module $I_1$.\n2.  $S_2 = M_{2,2}$: The simple module at vertex 2. Dimension vector $(0,1,0)$.\n3.  $S_3 = M_{3,3}$: The simple module at vertex 3. Dimension vector $(0,0,1)$. This is also the projective module $P_3$.\n4.  $M_{1,2}$: Dimension vector $(1,1,0)$. This is the injective module $I_2$.\n5.  $M_{2,3}$: Dimension vector $(0,1,1)$. This is the projective module $P_2$.\n6.  $M_{1,3}$: Dimension vector $(1,1,1)$. This is both the projective module $P_1$ and the injective module $I_3$.\n\n**Step 2: Understand $\\tau$-tilting modules and Slice modules**\n*   **$\\tau$-tilting module:** For a general finite-dimensional algebra, a module $T$ is $\\tau$-tilting if it is $\\tau$-rigid (i.e., $Hom_A(T, \\tau T) = 0$) and the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable summands of $T$ equals the number of simple $A$-modules (which is 3 in this case).\n*   **Hereditary Case:** Since our algebra $A$ is hereditary, the theory simplifies. $\\tau$-tilting modules are precisely the classical **tilting modules**. A module $T$ is a tilting module if $Ext_A^1(T,T)=0$ and it has 3 non-isomorphic indecomposable summands.\n*   **Slice module:** A slice in the Auslander-Reiten (AR) quiver of mod-A is a set of indecomposable modules satisfying certain properties. Crucially, a slice must be **sincere**, meaning that the direct sum of its modules has every simple module as a composition factor. A module is sincere if and only if its support covers all vertices of the quiver. A slice module is the direct sum of the modules in a slice.\n*   **The Key Connection:** For a connected hereditary algebra like our $A$, a tilting module is a slice module if and only if it is sincere.\n\nTherefore, the question \"which unique $\\tau$-tilting module is not a slice?\" is equivalent to \"which unique tilting module is not sincere?\".\n\n**Step 3: Find Non-sincere Tilting Modules**\nA module is not sincere if its support is a proper subset of $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. A tilting module must have 3 indecomposable summands. We need to find a proper subset of vertices that supports at least 3 indecomposable modules.\n\n1.  **Support on $\\{1, 2\\}$:** The indecomposable modules supported entirely on vertices $\\{1, 2\\}$ are $S_1=M_{1,1}$, $S_2=M_{2,2}$, and $M_{1,2}$. Let's test if their direct sum, $T_A = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus M_{1,2}$, is a tilting module. We need to check if $Ext_A^1(T_A, T_A) = 0$.\n    *   $S_1$ and $M_{1,2}$ are injective $A$-modules ($I_1$ and $I_2$). For any module $M$, if $I$ is injective, $Ext_A^1(I, M) = 0$ and $Ext_A^1(M, I) = 0$.\n    *   This means most of the $Ext^1$ groups are zero. The only one we need to check is $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_2)$.\n    *   Using the Auslander-Reiten formula, $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_2) \\cong D Hom_A(S_2, \\tau S_2)$, where $D$ is the standard duality and $\\tau$ is the AR-translation.\n    *   For the algebra $A_3$, the AR-translation acts as follows on the non-projective modules: $\\tau S_2 = S_3$. (This comes from the AR sequence $0 \\to S_3 \\to M_{2,3} \\to S_2 \\to 0$, which is wrong. The correct AR sequence is $0 \\to P_3 \\to P_2 \\oplus I_3 \\to \\dots$ No, the correct AR sequence is $0 \\to P_3 \\to P_2 \\to S_2 \\to 0$. Wait, $P_3=S_3, P_2=M_{2,3}$. This is an AR sequence. So $\\tau S_2 = P_3 = S_3$).\n    *   So, $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_2) \\cong D Hom_A(S_2, S_3)$. Since there are no non-zero maps from $S_2$ to $S_3$, this Hom-space is zero. Thus $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_2) = 0$.\n    *   Therefore, $T_A = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus M_{1,2}$ is a tilting module. Since its support is $\\{1, 2\\}$, it is not sincere and thus not a slice module.\n\n2.  **Support on $\\{2, 3\\}$:** The indecomposable modules supported entirely on vertices $\\{2, 3\\}$ are $S_2=M_{2,2}$, $S_3=M_{3,3}$, and $M_{2,3}$. Let's test if their direct sum, $T_B = S_2 \\oplus S_3 \\oplus M_{2,3}$, is a tilting module.\n    *   $S_3$ and $M_{2,3}$ are projective $A$-modules ($P_3$ and $P_2$). For any module $M$, if $P$ is projective, $Ext_A^1(P, M) = 0$.\n    *   We need to check the remaining $Ext^1$ groups, for instance $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_3)$.\n    *   $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_3) \\cong D Hom_A(S_3, \\tau S_2)$.\n    *   As established, $\\tau S_2 = S_3$.\n    *   So, $Ext_A^1(S_2, S_3) \\cong D Hom_A(S_3, S_3)$. Since $Hom_A(S_3, S_3) \\cong \\mathbb{C}$, this Ext-group is non-zero.\n    *   Therefore, $T_B$ is not a tilting module.\n\n3.  **Other supports:** Any other proper subset of vertices (e.g., $\\{1\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{3\\}$, $\\{1,3\\}$) supports fewer than 3 indecomposable modules, so we cannot form a tilting module with such a support.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nWe have found exactly one tilting module, $T_A = S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus M_{1,2}$, which is not sincere. Because the algebra is hereditary and connected, this is the unique tilting module that is not a slice module. This module is the direct sum of all indecomposable modules for the subalgebra $A' = \\mathbb{C}(1 \\to 2)$, viewed as $A$-modules.\n\nThe module is $S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus M_{1,2}$.\n\n<<<S_1 \\oplus S_2 \\oplus M_{1,2}>>>"
