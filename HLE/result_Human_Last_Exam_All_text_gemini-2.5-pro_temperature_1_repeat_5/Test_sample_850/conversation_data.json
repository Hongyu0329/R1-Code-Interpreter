    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Terminology**\n\nFirst, let's define the key terms in the question based on crystal symmetry:\n\n*   **Optical Activity:** This is the property of a material to rotate the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light. The fundamental symmetry requirement for a crystal to exhibit optical activity is that it must be **chiral**.\n*   **Chiral Crystal Class:** A crystal class is chiral (or enantiomorphic) if its symmetry operations do not include any improper rotations (rotoinversions or rotoreflections). This means it lacks an inversion center (i) and mirror planes (m). Objects belonging to chiral classes are not superimposable on their mirror images. There are 11 chiral crystal classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, and 432.\n*   **Achiral Crystal Class:** A crystal class is achiral if it is *not* chiral. This means its symmetry operations include at least one improper rotation, i.e., an inversion center or a mirror plane.\n*   **Non-polar Crystal Class:** A crystal class is polar if it has at least one unique direction that is not mapped onto its opposite by any symmetry operation in the group. Such crystals can exhibit properties like pyroelectricity. There are 10 polar classes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. A non-polar class is any class that is not in this list.\n\n**2. Identifying the Core Contradiction**\n\nThe question asks for crystal classes that are simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral**\n2.  Have the **correct symmetry for optical activity**\n\nBased on the standard definitions:\n*   \"Correct symmetry for optical activity\" implies the class must be **chiral**.\n*   The question explicitly states the class must be **achiral**.\n\nA crystal class cannot be both chiral and achiral at the same time. These two conditions are mutually exclusive. Therefore, under a strict interpretation, there are no crystal classes that satisfy the question's requirements.\n\n**3. A More Nuanced Interpretation**\n\nIt is likely the question is probing a deeper concept in crystal physics. The microscopic phenomenon underlying optical activity is called **gyrotropy**. The gyration tensor, which describes this effect, is non-zero if and only if the crystal class is **non-centrosymmetric** (lacks a center of inversion).\n\n*   All chiral classes are non-centrosymmetric.\n*   However, there are also some achiral classes that are non-centrosymmetric (e.g., class m, which has a mirror plane but no inversion center).\n\nIn these achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes, gyrotropy is permitted by symmetry, but it is always accompanied by strong linear birefringence (except along specific directions where gyrotropy itself is forbidden). Therefore, these crystals are gyrotropic but do not show \"optical activity\" in the simple sense of pure rotation.\n\nAssuming the question uses \"correct symmetry for optical activity\" to mean \"non-centrosymmetric\" (i.e., allowing for gyrotropy), we can resolve the contradiction and find an answer.\n\n**4. Finding the Solution under the Nuanced Interpretation**\n\nWe are looking for crystal classes that satisfy three revised conditions:\n1.  **Non-centrosymmetric:** Lacks an inversion center.\n2.  **Achiral:** Possesses a mirror plane or an improper rotation axis other than inversion.\n3.  **Non-polar:** Is not one of the 10 polar classes.\n\nLet's filter all 32 crystal classes based on these conditions.\n\n*   **Start with all 21 non-centrosymmetric classes:**\n    1, 2, m, 222, mm2, 3, 32, 3m, 4, -4, 422, 4mm, -42m, 6, -6, 622, 6mm, -6m2, 23, 432, -43m.\n\n*   **Apply the \"Achiral\" condition:** We remove the 11 chiral classes (1, 2, 222, 3, 32, 4, 422, 6, 622, 23, 432) from the list above. This leaves us with the 10 achiral, non-centrosymmetric classes:\n    m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -6, -42m, -6m2, -43m.\n\n*   **Apply the \"Non-polar\" condition:** We now remove any polar classes from this list of 10. The polar classes are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm}. The ones present in our current list are:\n    m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm.\n\n*   **Final List:** After removing the polar classes, we are left with the final set of crystal classes that are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric:\n    **-4, -6, -42m, -6m2, -43m**\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nWhile a strict interpretation of the question leads to the answer \"none\" due to a contradiction, a more physical interpretation based on the requirement of non-centrosymmetry for gyrotropy yields a specific set of 5 crystal classes. These classes are achiral, non-polar, and non-centrosymmetric.\n\nThe 5 crystal classes are:\n*   **-4** (from the tetragonal system)\n*   **-6** (from the hexagonal system)\n*   **-42m** (from the tetragonal system)\n*   **-6m2** (from the hexagonal system)\n*   **-43m** (from the cubic system)\n\n<<<-4, -6, -42m, -6m2, -43m>>>"
