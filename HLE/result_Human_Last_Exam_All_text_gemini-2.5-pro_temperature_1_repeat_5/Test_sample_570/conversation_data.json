    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal area of the convex domain.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition on the Convex Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain in the plane. The problem requires that `K` has a non-empty intersection with every line `L_{p,q}` defined by the equation `px + qy = 1`, where `p` and `q` are coprime integers (i.e., `gcd(p, q) = 1`).\n\nLet `S` be the set of all integer vectors `v = (p, q)` such that `p` and `q` are coprime. The condition is that for every `v \\in S`, the line `v \\cdot x = 1` must intersect `K`.\n\nA key observation is that if `(p, q)` is a coprime pair, then so is `(-p, -q)`. The line corresponding to `(-p, -q)` is `-px - qy = 1`, which is equivalent to `px + qy = -1`. Therefore, the convex domain `K` must intersect both lines `px + qy = 1` and `px + qy = -1` for every `v = (p,q) \\in S`.\n\n### Step 2: Symmetrization of the Domain\n\nLet `K` be a convex domain satisfying the condition. Consider its centrally symmetrized version, `K_s = \\frac{1}{2}(K - K) = \\{ \\frac{1}{2}(x_1 - x_2) | x_1, x_2 \\in K \\}`.\n`K_s` is a centrally symmetric convex domain. By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality, `Area(K_s) \\ge Area(K)`.\n\nLet's check if `K_s` also satisfies the condition. For any `v = (p,q) \\in S`, we know `K` intersects `v \\cdot x = 1` and `v \\cdot x = -1`. So, there exist points `x_1, x_2 \\in K` such that `v \\cdot x_1 = 1` and `v \\cdot x_2 = -1`.\nConsider the point `y = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1 - x_2)`, which is in `K_s`.\nLet's evaluate `v \\cdot y`:\n`v \\cdot y = v \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}(x_1 - x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(v \\cdot x_1 - v \\cdot x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - (-1)) = 1`.\nSo, the point `y \\in K_s` lies on the line `px + qy = 1`. This means `K_s` also intersects every line `L_{p,q}`.\n\nSince `Area(K_s) \\ge Area(K)`, the minimum area must be achieved by a centrally symmetric convex domain. Therefore, we can restrict our search to centrally symmetric domains `K`.\n\n### Step 3: Using the Polar Body and Support Function\n\nFor a centrally symmetric convex body `K`, the condition that it intersects the line `px + qy = 1` is equivalent to the statement that the maximum value of the linear function `f(x,y) = px + qy` over `(x,y) \\in K` is at least 1. This maximum value is the support function `h_K(p,q)`. So, the condition is `h_K(p,q) \\ge 1` for all `(p,q) \\in S`.\n\nLet `K^*` be the polar body of `K`, defined as `K^* = \\{ y \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 | x \\cdot y \\le 1 \\text{ for all } x \\in K \\}`.\nA fundamental property relating a body and its polar is that `h_K(y) \\ge 1` if and only if `y` is not in the interior of `K^*`.\nSo, the condition on `K` is equivalent to the condition on `K^*` that for every primitive lattice point `v = (p,q) \\in S`, `v` is not in the interior of `K^*`. In other words, `int(K^*)` must be free of primitive lattice points.\n\n### Step 4: Relating the Areas of K and K*\n\nWe want to find the minimum possible `Area(K)`. There is a deep relationship between the area of a convex body and its polar, given by Mahler's inequality. For a centrally symmetric convex body `K` in the plane, it states:\n`Area(K) \\cdot Area(K^*) \\ge 8`.\n\nTo minimize `Area(K)`, we must maximize `Area(K^*)`.\n`Area(K) \\ge \\frac{8}{Area(K^*)}`.\n\n### Step 5: Finding the Maximum Area of K*\n\nThe problem is now transformed into finding the maximum area of a centrally symmetric convex body `K^*` whose interior contains no primitive lattice points.\n\nLet `C` be a centrally symmetric convex body in the plane.\nAccording to Minkowski's First Theorem, if `Area(C) > 4`, then `C` must contain a non-zero integer lattice point `v = (p,q)` in its interior.\nLet's analyze this point `v`.\n*   If `v` is a primitive lattice point (`gcd(p,q)=1`), then `C` is not a valid candidate for `K^*`.\n*   If `v` is not a primitive lattice point, then `v = k \\cdot v'` for some integer `k > 1` and a primitive lattice point `v'`. Since `C` is centrally symmetric and convex, and `0` and `v` are in its interior, the entire open line segment `(-v, v)` must also be in `int(C)`. This segment contains the point `v'`. Thus, `v'` is a primitive lattice point in the interior of `C`.\n\nIn either case, if `Area(C) > 4`, its interior must contain a primitive lattice point. Therefore, any valid `K^*` must have `Area(K^*) \\le 4`.\n\nThis maximum area of 4 is achieved. Consider the square `Q = [-1, 1] \\times [-1, 1]`.\n*   It is a centrally symmetric convex body.\n*   Its area is `2 \\times 2 = 4`.\n*   Its interior is the open square `(-1, 1) \\times (-1, 1)`. The only integer lattice point in this region is `(0,0)`, which is not a primitive point.\nThus, `Q` is a valid candidate for `K^*`, and it achieves the maximum possible area.\nSo, `max Area(K^*) = 4`.\n\n### Step 6: Calculating the Minimal Area of K\n\nUsing the result from Step 5 in the inequality from Step 4:\n`min Area(K) \\ge \\frac{8}{max Area(K^*)} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2`.\n\nThe minimum area is at least 2. This minimum is achieved if we can find a body `K` that satisfies the conditions, has `Area(K) = 2`, and its polar `K^*` has `Area(K^*) = 4`.\nThe equality in Mahler's inequality, `Area(K) \\cdot Area(K^*) = 8`, holds if and only if `K` (and thus `K^*`) is a parallelogram.\nOur optimal `K^*` is the square `Q = [-1, 1]^2`, which is a parallelogram. Its polar body `K = Q^*` will satisfy the equality.\n\nLet's find `K = Q^*`:\n`K = \\{ (x,y) | u x + v y \\le 1 \\text{ for all } (u,v) \\in Q \\}`.\nThe maximum of `ux+vy` for `(u,v)` in the square `[-1,1]^2` is `|x| + |y|`.\nSo the condition becomes `|x| + |y| \\le 1`.\nThis describes a diamond (a square rotated by 45 degrees) with vertices at `(1,0), (0,1), (-1,0), (0,-1)`.\n\n### Step 7: Final Verification\n\nThe candidate for the minimal area convex domain is `K = \\{ (x,y) | |x| + |y| \\le 1 \\}`.\n*   **Area**: The area of this diamond is `\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2`.\n*   **Condition**: Does it intersect `px+qy=1` for all coprime `(p,q)`?\n    We check `h_K(p,q) = \\sup_{|x|+|y|\\le 1} (px+qy)`. The maximum of this linear function on the diamond is achieved at one of its vertices.\n    `h_K(p,q) = \\max(p \\cdot 1 + q \\cdot 0, p \\cdot 0 + q \\cdot 1, p \\cdot (-1) + q \\cdot 0, p \\cdot 0 + q \\cdot (-1)) = \\max(p, q, -p, -q) = \\max(|p|, |q|)`.\n    Since `p` and `q` are coprime, they cannot both be zero. As they are integers, at least one of `|p|` or `|q|` must be at least 1. Thus, `max(|p|, |q|) \\ge 1`.\n    The condition `h_K(p,q) \\ge 1` is satisfied.\n\nSince we have found a convex domain with area 2, and we have proven that the minimal area must be at least 2, the minimal area is exactly 2."
