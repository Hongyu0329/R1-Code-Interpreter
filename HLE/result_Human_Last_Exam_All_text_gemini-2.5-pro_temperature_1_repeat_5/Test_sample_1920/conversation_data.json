    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the conductor and its properties**\nFirst, we need to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$.\n*   We can test for small prime factors. It is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.\n*   Dividing by 7: $53599 = 7 \\times 7657$.\n*   Next, we factor 7657. Dividing by 13: $7657 = 13 \\times 589$.\n*   Finally, we factor 589. Dividing by 19: $589 = 19 \\times 31$.\nSo, the prime factorization of the conductor is $d = 7 \\times 13 \\times 19 \\times 31$.\n**Careful Point 1:** The conductor $d$ is a square-free integer, which means it is a product of distinct primes. This simplifies the conditions for a character to be primitive.\n\n**Step 2: Decompose the Dirichlet character**\nThe group of Dirichlet characters modulo $d$ is isomorphic to the direct product of the groups of characters modulo its prime factors. Any character $\\chi$ modulo $d$ can be uniquely expressed as a product of characters:\n$\\chi = \\chi_7 \\chi_{13} \\chi_{19} \\chi_{31}$\nwhere $\\chi_p$ is a Dirichlet character modulo the prime $p$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the condition for a character to be primitive**\nFor a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_k$, a character $\\chi = \\chi_{p_1} \\chi_{p_2} \\cdots \\chi_{p_k}$ is primitive if and only if each of its component characters $\\chi_{p_i}$ is non-principal. The principal character is the character of order 1.\n**Careful Point 2:** This means that for our character $\\chi$ to be primitive, the order of each component character, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$, must be greater than 1.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the condition on the order of the character**\nWe are given that the order of $\\chi$ is 6. The order of a product character is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its components:\n$\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_7), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{19}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{31})) = 6$.\nFor the lcm of a set of numbers to be 6, each number in the set must be a divisor of 6. Therefore, $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$ must be a divisor of 6 for each prime $p \\in \\{7, 13, 19, 31\\}$.\nThe divisors of 6 are {1, 2, 3, 6}.\nCombining this with the primitivity condition (Step 3), the possible orders for each component character $\\chi_p$ are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n\n**Step 5: Count the number of possible component characters**\nThe group of characters modulo a prime $p$ is a cyclic group of order $\\phi(p) = p-1$. The number of characters of order $k$ in this group is given by Euler's totient function $\\phi(k)$, provided that $k$ divides $p-1$.\nLet's check this condition for our primes and the required orders {2, 3, 6}:\n*   For $p=7$, the group order is $p-1=6$. Divisors are {1,2,3,6}. So orders 2, 3, 6 are possible.\n*   For $p=13$, the group order is $p-1=12$. Divisors include {1,2,3,4,6,12}. So orders 2, 3, 6 are possible.\n*   For $p=19$, the group order is $p-1=18$. Divisors include {1,2,3,6,9,18}. So orders 2, 3, 6 are possible.\n*   For $p=31$, the group order is $p-1=30$. Divisors include {1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30}. So orders 2, 3, 6 are possible.\n\nFor each prime $p$, the number of component characters $\\chi_p$ of a given order $k \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$ is:\n*   Number of characters of order 2: $\\phi(2) = 1$.\n*   Number of characters of order 3: $\\phi(3) = 2$.\n*   Number of characters of order 6: $\\phi(6) = \\phi(2)\\phi(3) = 1 \\times 2 = 2$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the total number of characters of order 6 using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**\nWe need to count the number of tuples of characters $(\\chi_7, \\chi_{13}, \\chi_{19}, \\chi_{31})$ such that the lcm of their orders is exactly 6. Let $o_p = \\text{ord}(\\chi_p)$. We require $\\text{lcm}(o_7, o_{13}, o_{19}, o_{31})=6$.\nThis is equivalent to the conditions:\n1.  All $o_p$ must be in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n2.  At least one $o_p$ must be a multiple of 2 (i.e., 2 or 6).\n3.  At least one $o_p$ must be a multiple of 3 (i.e., 3 or 6).\n\nLet's use a counting argument based on these conditions.\nLet $S$ be the set of all primitive characters where each component $\\chi_p$ has an order that divides 6 (i.e., $o_p \\in \\{2, 3, 6\\}$).\nFor each of the four primes, the number of choices for $\\chi_p$ is the sum of the numbers of characters of orders 2, 3, and 6:\nNumber of choices per prime = $\\phi(2) + \\phi(3) + \\phi(6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\nThe total number of characters in $S$ is $|S| = 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 \\times 5 = 5^4 = 625$.\n\nNow we must subtract the characters from $S$ whose order is not 6. The order of a character in $S$ can only be 2, 3, or 6. We need to exclude those with order 2 or 3.\n*   **Case 1: The character has order dividing 2.**\n    The order of $\\chi$ divides 2 if and only if the order of each component $\\chi_p$ divides 2. Since the order must be > 1, this means $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) = 2$ for all $p$.\n    For each prime, there is $\\phi(2)=1$ character of order 2.\n    The total number of such characters is $1 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1$. (The resulting character has order $\\text{lcm}(2,2,2,2)=2$).\n\n*   **Case 2: The character has order dividing 3.**\n    The order of $\\chi$ divides 3 if and only if the order of each component $\\chi_p$ divides 3. Since the order must be > 1, this means $\\text{ord}(\\chi_p) = 3$ for all $p$.\n    For each prime, there are $\\phi(3)=2$ characters of order 3.\n    The total number of such characters is $2 \\times 2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 2^4 = 16$. (The resulting characters have order $\\text{lcm}(3,3,3,3)=3$).\n\n**Careful Point 3:** The set of characters whose order divides 2 and the set of characters whose order divides 3 are disjoint (as we have excluded order 1). Therefore, we can simply subtract their counts from the total.\n\nThe number of primitive characters of order 6 is the total number of combinations in $S$ minus those whose order is not 6:\nNumber of characters of order 6 = $|S| - (\\text{Number with order 2}) - (\\text{Number with order 3})$\n$= 625 - 1 - 16 = 608$."
