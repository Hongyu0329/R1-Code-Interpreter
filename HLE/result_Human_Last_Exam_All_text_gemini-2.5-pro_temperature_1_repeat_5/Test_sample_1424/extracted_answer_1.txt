The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\epsilon_k$. Specifically, its functional form is $G_0(k, \omega) \propto (\omega' - \epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $\omega'$ is a term combining the frequency and the chemical potential.
