Yes, changing the linker to incorporate a more substantial polyethylene glycol (PEG) group is a very effective and common strategy to increase the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic molecules. The current probe has large hydrophobic regions (thioxanthone and chloro-hexyl chain) that cause it to precipitate at 100 ÂµM. A PEG chain is highly hydrophilic and will increase the overall solubility of the compound in the aqueous cell culture medium, thus likely preventing the observed precipitation.
