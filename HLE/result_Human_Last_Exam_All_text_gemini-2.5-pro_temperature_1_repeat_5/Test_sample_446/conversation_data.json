    "**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Molecular Recognition Motif:** The question is about peptides binding to integrin receptors. Integrins are a class of cell surface receptors that mediate cell-matrix adhesion. A central and well-established recognition motif for many integrins is the tripeptide sequence **RGD** (Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid). All the answer choices provided contain this RGD sequence at their N-terminus.\n\n2.  **Consider the Importance of Flanking Amino Acids:** While the RGD sequence is necessary for binding, it is not sufficient on its own to confer high affinity or specificity. The amino acids flanking the RGD motif play a critical role. They influence the three-dimensional conformation of the RGD sequence, presenting it in a specific \"loop\" or \"turn\" structure that is recognized by the binding pocket of a particular integrin subtype. Different flanking sequences lead to different specificities for different integrins (e.g., α5β1, αvβ3, αIIbβ3).\n\n3.  **Evaluate Each Peptide Sequence Based on Known Natural Ligands:** We need to compare the given peptide sequences to the RGD-containing sequences found in natural extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins that are known to bind integrins.\n\n    *   **Fibronectin:** This is a major ECM protein that binds strongly to the α5β1 integrin, among others. The cell-binding domain of fibronectin contains the sequence **RGDSP**. This sequence has been extensively studied, and synthetic peptides containing RGDSP are widely used as competitive inhibitors of fibronectin-integrin interactions.\n\n    *   **Vitronectin:** Another ECM protein that binds to αvβ3 integrin. Its binding motif is **RGDV**.\n\n    *   **Laminin, Collagen, etc.:** Other ECM proteins also have RGD or related motifs.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A. RGDMAA:** The flanking sequence -MAA is not characteristic of a well-known natural integrin ligand.\n    *   **B. RGDSPSS:** This peptide contains the sequence **RGDSP**. This is the canonical cell-binding sequence from fibronectin. The presence of the Proline (P) immediately after the RGD motif is known to be important for inducing a β-turn structure, which is favorable for binding to certain integrins like α5β1. Therefore, a peptide with the sequence RGDSP is very well-documented to bind integrins in vitro. The additional -SS at the end does not negate this; it's simply part of a longer peptide containing the core binding motif.\n    *   **C. RGDLTTP:** The flanking sequence -LTTP is not the primary sequence from fibronectin or vitronectin.\n    *   **D. RGDQVSK:** The flanking sequence -QVSK does not match the classic motifs.\n    *   **E. RGDARGG:** The flanking sequence -ARGG is not a well-known high-affinity binding sequence.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** Based on the analysis, the peptide **RGDSPSS** contains the well-established RGDSP binding motif from fibronectin. Synthetic peptides with this sequence are standard reagents used in cell adhesion assays to demonstrate integrin-mediated binding. Therefore, this peptide is highly likely to bind to an integrin receptor.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   All peptides contain the essential RGD motif.\n*   The key differentiator is the sequence of amino acids *following* the RGD motif.\n*   The context of the RGD sequence is critical for its biological activity and specificity.\n*   The sequence RGDSP is the famous and scientifically validated binding site from fibronectin, a major integrin ligand.\n*   The presence of Proline (P) next to the RGD is often conformationally important for binding activity.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\n\nThe peptide in choice B, RGDSPSS, contains the RGDSP motif. This is the classic cell attachment sequence from fibronectin. It has been experimentally verified countless times that peptides containing the RGDSP sequence bind to integrin receptors (specifically α5β1) in in vitro assays. Therefore, RGDSPSS is the correct answer.\n\n<<<B>>>"
