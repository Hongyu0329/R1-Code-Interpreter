    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the area of the smallest square that encloses the given figure.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the parametric curve**\n\nThe curve is defined by the parametric equations:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = b \\sin t$\nwhere the parameter $b$ depends on the interval of $t$:\n*   $b = 1$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$\n*   $b = 5$ for $t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$\n\nWe need to analyze the shape of the curve in two parts.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first part of the curve ($t \\in [0, \\pi]$)**\n\nFor this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = \\sin t$\nThese are the standard parametric equations for a circle. Squaring and adding the equations gives $x^2 + y^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nNow let's find the range of x and y values:\n*   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(0) = 1$ to $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\pi$, $y = \\sin t$ goes from $\\sin(0) = 0$ up to a maximum of $\\sin(\\pi/2) = 1$ and back down to $\\sin(\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, this part of the curve is the upper semi-circle of the unit circle, centered at the origin, with a radius of 1. It starts at (1, 0), goes through (0, 1), and ends at (-1, 0).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the second part of the curve ($t \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$)**\n\nFor this interval, the equations are:\n$x = \\cos t$\n$y = 5 \\sin t$\nThese are the parametric equations for an ellipse. We can write this as $(\\frac{x}{1})^2 + (\\frac{y}{5})^2 = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1$.\nThis equation describes an ellipse centered at the origin with a semi-minor axis of 1 (along the x-axis) and a semi-major axis of 5 (along the y-axis).\nNow let's find the range of x and y values for this interval:\n*   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $x = \\cos t$ goes from $\\cos(\\pi) = -1$ up to $\\cos(2\\pi) = 1$.\n*   As $t$ goes from $\\pi$ to $2\\pi$, $y = 5 \\sin t$ is always negative (or zero). It goes from $5\\sin(\\pi) = 0$ down to a minimum of $5\\sin(3\\pi/2) = -5$ and back up to $5\\sin(2\\pi) = 0$.\nSo, this part of the curve is the lower semi-ellipse. It starts at (-1, 0), goes through (0, -5), and ends at (1, 0).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the overall dimensions of the figure**\n\nTo find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the entire figure. This will define a bounding rectangle.\n\n*   **X-dimension (Width):**\n    From both parts, the value of $x = \\cos t$ ranges from a minimum of -1 to a maximum of 1.\n    $x_{min} = -1$\n    $x_{max} = 1$\n    The total width of the figure is $W = x_{max} - x_{min} = 1 - (-1) = 2$.\n\n*   **Y-dimension (Height):**\n    From the first part (upper semi-circle), the y-values range from 0 to 1. So, $y_{max} = 1$.\n    From the second part (lower semi-ellipse), the y-values range from -5 to 0. So, $y_{min} = -5$.\n    The total height of the figure is $H = y_{max} - y_{min} = 1 - (-5) = 6$.\n\n**Step 5: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square**\n\nThe smallest square that can enclose the figure must have a side length equal to the larger of the figure's width and height.\n\nSide length of the square, $s = \\max(\\text{Width}, \\text{Height}) = \\max(2, 6) = 6$.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the area of the square**\n\nThe area of a square with side length $s$ is given by $A = s^2$.\n\nArea = $6^2 = 36$.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n*   The piecewise definition of the parameter `b` is the most critical part of the problem. It creates a composite figure from two different conic sections.\n*   The term \"outcircles\" in this context means to find a bounding square. For a shape aligned with the coordinate axes, the smallest such square will also be aligned with the axes.\n*   It's important to find the global minimum and maximum for both x and y coordinates by considering both parts of the curve.\n*   The final answer is the area, not the side length.\n\nThe figure consists of an upper semi-circle of radius 1 and a lower semi-ellipse with a vertical semi-axis of 5. The total width is 2, and the total height is $1 + 5 = 6$. The smallest enclosing square must have a side length of 6. The area is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
