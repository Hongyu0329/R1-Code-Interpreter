    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of subgroups of index 4 in the Grigorchuk group ($G$).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the key properties of the Grigorchuk Group (G)\nThe Grigorchuk group $G$ is a finitely generated infinite 2-group with several key properties relevant to this problem:\n1.  **Abelianization**: The abelianization of $G$, denoted $G_{ab} = G/[G,G]$, is isomorphic to the elementary abelian group of order 8.\n    $G_{ab} \\cong C_2 \\times C_2 \\times C_2 \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^3$.\n2.  **Maximal Subgroups**: A maximal subgroup is a proper subgroup that is not contained in any larger proper subgroup. For the Grigorchuk group, it is a known result that all maximal subgroups have index 2.\n3.  **Number of Maximal Subgroups**: The number of subgroups of index 2 in any group is equal to the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from the group to $C_2$. For $G$, this is equivalent to the number of non-trivial homomorphisms from its abelianization $G_{ab}$ to $C_2$.\n    *   $\\text{Hom}(G_{ab}, C_2) = \\text{Hom}(C_2^3, C_2)$.\n    *   A homomorphism is defined by mapping the 3 generators of $C_2^3$ to elements of $C_2$. There are $2^3 = 8$ such homomorphisms.\n    *   One of these is the trivial homomorphism (maps everything to the identity). The number of non-trivial homomorphisms is $8 - 1 = 7$.\n    *   Thus, the Grigorchuk group $G$ has exactly **7** subgroups of index 2. Since they are kernels of homomorphisms to an abelian group, they are all normal subgroups. These are the 7 maximal subgroups of $G$. Let's denote them by $M_1, M_2, \\dots, M_7$.\n\n### Step 2: Classify subgroups of index 4\nA subgroup $H$ of index 4 in $G$ must be contained in a maximal subgroup. Since all maximal subgroups have index 2, if $H \\subset M_i$, then the index $[M_i : H]$ must be 2. So, every subgroup of index 4 is a subgroup of index 2 of some maximal subgroup.\n\nSubgroups of index 4 can be either normal or non-normal in $G$.\n\n**Normal Subgroups of Index 4:**\n*   If $H$ is a normal subgroup of index 4, then the quotient group $G/H$ has order 4.\n*   Since $G_{ab} \\cong C_2^3$, any abelian quotient of $G$ must have exponent 2. Thus, the quotient group $G/H$ cannot be the cyclic group $C_4$. It must be the Klein four-group, $G/H \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$.\n*   The number of normal subgroups with quotient $C_2 \\times C_2$ is the number of distinct kernels of surjective homomorphisms from $G$ to $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n*   These homomorphisms factor through $G_{ab}$. So we need to count the number of surjective homomorphisms from $G_{ab} \\cong C_2^3$ to $C_2^2$. The kernel of such a map is a subspace of dimension $3-2=1$ in the vector space $\\mathbb{F}_2^3$.\n*   The number of 1-dimensional subspaces in $\\mathbb{F}_2^3$ is $\\frac{2^3-1}{2-1} = 7$.\n*   So, there are **7** normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n### Step 3: Relate subgroups of index 4 to maximal subgroups\nWe can establish a crucial link between a subgroup's normality and the number of maximal subgroups it is contained in.\n\n1.  **If a subgroup $H$ is contained in two distinct maximal subgroups $M_i$ and $M_j$**: The normalizer of $H$, $N_G(H)$, must contain both $M_i$ and $M_j$. Since $M_i$ and $M_j$ are distinct maximal subgroups, the group they generate is $G$ itself. So, $N_G(H) \\supseteq \\langle M_i, M_j \\rangle = G$, which implies $H$ is normal in $G$.\n\n2.  **If a subgroup $H$ is normal in $G$ and has index 4**: As established, $G/H \\cong C_2 \\times C_2$. The group $C_2 \\times C_2$ has exactly 3 subgroups of order 2. By the Lattice Correspondence Theorem, $H$ is contained in exactly 3 subgroups of index 2 in $G$. These are 3 of the maximal subgroups.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion:\n*   A **non-normal** subgroup of index 4 is contained in **exactly one** maximal subgroup.\n*   A **normal** subgroup of index 4 is contained in **exactly three** maximal subgroups.\n\n### Step 4: Count the subgroups using this relationship\nLet's count the total number of subgroups of index 4 by first counting the number of index-2 subgroups within each maximal subgroup.\n\n1.  **Structure of Maximal Subgroups**: It is a known result that the automorphism group of $G$, $\\text{Aut}(G)$, acts transitively on the set of 7 maximal subgroups. Therefore, all 7 maximal subgroups are isomorphic to one another.\n2.  **Subgroups of $M_1=St_G(1)$**: One of the maximal subgroups is the stabilizer of the first level of the binary tree, $St_G(1)$. Its abelianization is known to be $St_G(1)_{ab} \\cong C_2^5$.\n3.  **Number of index-2 subgroups in a maximal subgroup**: The number of subgroups of index 2 in any maximal subgroup $M_i$ is given by $|\\text{Hom}(M_{i,ab}, C_2)| - 1$. Since $M_i \\cong St_G(1)$, we have $M_{i,ab} \\cong C_2^5$.\n    *   Number of index-2 subgroups in $M_i$ = $2^5 - 1 = 31$.\n\nNow, let's count the total set of subgroups of index 4, let's call it $S$.\n*   Let $N$ be the set of normal subgroups of index 4. We found $|N| = 7$.\n*   Let $NN$ be the set of non-normal subgroups of index 4. We want to find $|NN|$.\n*   Total number of subgroups of index 4 is $|S| = |N| + |NN|$.\n\nWe can count the total number of pairs $(H, M_i)$, where $H$ is a subgroup of index 2 in the maximal subgroup $M_i$.\n*   Since each of the 7 maximal subgroups has 31 subgroups of index 2, the total number of such pairs is $7 \\times 31 = 217$.\n\nThis sum can also be expressed by summing over all subgroups of index 4:\n$217 = \\sum_{H \\in S} (\\text{number of maximal subgroups containing H})$\nUsing our findings from Step 3:\n$217 = \\sum_{H \\in N} 3 + \\sum_{H \\in NN} 1$\n$217 = 3 \\cdot |N| + 1 \\cdot |NN|$\nSubstitute $|N| = 7$:\n$217 = 3 \\cdot 7 + |NN|$\n$217 = 21 + |NN|$\n$|NN| = 217 - 21 = 196$.\n\nSo, there are 196 non-normal subgroups of index 4.\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe total number of subgroups of index 4 is the sum of the normal and non-normal ones.\nTotal subgroups = (Number of normal subgroups) + (Number of non-normal subgroups)\nTotal subgroups = $|N| + |NN| = 7 + 196 = 203$."
