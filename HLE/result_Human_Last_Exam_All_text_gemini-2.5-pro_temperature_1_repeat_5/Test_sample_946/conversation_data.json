    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the question**\nThe core components of the question are:\n*   **Source:** The online cartoon series \"Homestar Runner\".\n*   **Specific Episode:** \"Teen Girl Squad #15\".\n*   **Event:** Junior prom.\n*   **Item:** A cardboard cutout.\n*   **Subject:** A fictional singer.\n\nThe goal is to identify the name of this fictional singer.\n\n**Step 2: Recall or research the plot of \"Teen Girl Squad #15\"**\nThis episode focuses on the four members of the Teen Girl Squad (Cheerleader, So and So, What's Her Face, and The Ugly One) attending their Junior prom.\n\n**Step 3: Pinpoint the scene with the musical performance**\nUpon arriving at the prom, the girls see the \"musical guest\". The episode makes it clear that the school could not afford a live band.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze the dialogue to identify the singer's name**\nIn the scene, Cheerleader excitedly points out the performer. Her dialogue is:\n\"Ohmigosh, you guys! It's a cardboard cutout of mainstream recording artist, Taranchula!\"\n\n**Step 5: Identify the careful points**\n*   **It is a cardboard cutout, not a live performer.** The question correctly notes this, and the dialogue confirms it. This is a key part of the joke in the episode.\n*   **The name is explicitly stated.** The name \"Taranchula\" is spoken directly by a main character, leaving no room for interpretation.\n*   **\"Singer\" vs. \"Band\".** While Cheerleader refers to \"mainstream recording artist, Taranchula\" (implying a single artist), in the wider Homestar Runner universe, Taranchula is known as a fictional death metal band. For the purpose of this specific question and its context, \"Taranchula\" is the correct name to identify.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the answer**\nBased on the direct dialogue from the episode \"Teen Girl Squad #15\", the fictional recording artist represented by a cardboard cutout at the Junior prom is named Taranchula.\n\n<<<Taranchula>>>"
