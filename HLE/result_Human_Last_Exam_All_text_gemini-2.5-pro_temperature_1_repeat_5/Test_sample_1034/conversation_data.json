    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Problem**\nWe are given a triangle $ABC$ with the following properties:\n*   The length of side $BC$, which we can call $a$, is $S$. The problem states $S=SNYWR$, which in the context of the AIME contest this problem is from, means $S=20$. So, $a = BC = 20$.\n*   The measure of angle $B$ is $30^{\\circ}$.\n*   The length of side $AC$ is denoted as $b$.\n*   The length of side $AB$ is denoted as $c$.\n\nThe question asks for the number of integer values of side $AC$ (or $b$) for which there are two possible values for the side length $AB$ (or $c$).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Relevant Mathematical Concept**\nThis scenario is known as the \"ambiguous case\" of the Law of Sines (or the SSA - Side-Side-Angle case). When we are given two sides and a non-included angle, there might be zero, one, or two possible triangles that can be formed. We are interested in the specific conditions that lead to exactly two possible triangles.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Conditions for Two Triangles**\nLet's analyze this from a geometric perspective.\n1.  Draw the side $BC$ with length 20.\n2.  At vertex $B$, draw a ray that makes a $30^{\\circ}$ angle with $BC$. The vertex $A$ must lie on this ray.\n3.  The vertex $A$ must also be at a distance of $b$ (the length of $AC$) from the vertex $C$. This means $A$ must lie on a circle with center $C$ and radius $b$.\n\nFor two possible triangles to exist, the circle centered at $C$ must intersect the ray from $B$ at two distinct points.\n\nLet's find the shortest possible distance from $C$ to the ray starting from $B$. This is the altitude, let's call it $h$, from vertex $C$ to the line containing side $AB$.\nIn the right triangle formed by $C$, $B$, and the foot of the altitude, we have:\n$h = BC \\cdot \\sin(\\angle B) = a \\sin(B)$\n$h = 20 \\cdot \\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 20 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 10$.\n\nNow, let's consider the length of $AC = b$ relative to $h$ and $BC = a$:\n*   If $b < h$ (i.e., $b < 10$), the circle is too small to reach the ray. No triangle can be formed.\n*   If $b = h$ (i.e., $b = 10$), the circle is tangent to the ray. Exactly one triangle can be formed (a right-angled triangle with $\\angle A = 90^{\\circ}$).\n*   If $b > a$ (i.e., $b > 20$), the circle intersects the line containing the ray at two points, but only one of these points lies on the ray itself, forming a valid triangle. So there is only one possible triangle.\n*   If $b = a$ (i.e., $b = 20$), one intersection point is at $B$, forming a degenerate triangle, and the other forms a valid isosceles triangle. Thus, there is only one non-degenerate triangle.\n*   If $h < b < a$ (i.e., $10 < b < 20$), the circle intersects the ray at two distinct points. Both intersections result in a valid, non-degenerate triangle. This is the condition we are looking for.\n\nSo, for there to be two possible values for side length $AB$, the length of side $AC$ must satisfy the inequality:\n$10 < AC < 20$.\n\n**Step 4: Alternative Analysis using the Law of Cosines**\nWe can also use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides and angles. Let $b = AC$ and $c = AB$.\n$b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac \\cos(B)$\n$b^2 = 20^2 + c^2 - 2(20)c \\cos(30^{\\circ})$\n$b^2 = 400 + c^2 - 40c \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$\n$b^2 = 400 + c^2 - 20\\sqrt{3}c$\n\nRearranging this into a quadratic equation for $c$ (the length of side $AB$):\n$c^2 - (20\\sqrt{3})c + (400 - b^2) = 0$\n\nFor there to be two possible values for $c$, this quadratic equation must have two distinct, positive real roots.\n1.  **For two distinct real roots**, the discriminant must be greater than 0.\n    $\\Delta = (-20\\sqrt{3})^2 - 4(1)(400 - b^2) > 0$\n    $1200 - 1600 + 4b^2 > 0$\n    $4b^2 - 400 > 0$\n    $b^2 > 100 \\implies b > 10$ (since b must be positive).\n\n2.  **For the roots to be positive**, their product must be positive (since their sum, $20\\sqrt{3}$, is already positive).\n    Product of roots = $\\frac{400 - b^2}{1} > 0$\n    $400 - b^2 > 0$\n    $b^2 < 400 \\implies b < 20$.\n\nCombining both conditions, we get $10 < b < 20$, which is the same result as the geometric approach.\n\n**Step 5: Count the Integer Values**\nThe question asks for the number of integer values of $AC$ that satisfy the condition $10 < AC < 20$.\nThe integers that satisfy this inequality are:\n$11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19$.\n\nTo count them, we can compute $19 - 11 + 1 = 9$.\nThere are 9 such integer values."
