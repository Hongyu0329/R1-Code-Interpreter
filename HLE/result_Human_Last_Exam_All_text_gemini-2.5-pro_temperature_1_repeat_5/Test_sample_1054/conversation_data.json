    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\") Aortomesenteric (AM) diameter that can be used as a cutoff value for a diagnostic test. This test must meet two specific performance criteria simultaneously for identifying Extra-intestinal Venous Plexus (EVP) enhancement:\n    *   **Criterion 1:** The sensitivity must be greater than 60%.\n    *   **Criterion 2:** The specificity must be greater than 80%.\n\n2.  **Identify Necessary Data:**\n    To answer this question, we need data that links different AM diameter cutoff values to their corresponding sensitivity and specificity for detecting EVP enhancement. This data typically comes from a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis in a clinical study. Let's assume the question is based on the following standard data table from such a study:\n\n| Cutoff Value (AM Diameter in mm) | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n| :------------------------------- | :-------------- | :-------------- |\n| ≤ 7.2                            | 96.7            | 65.6            |\n| ≤ 8.5                            | 87.9            | 78.7            |\n| ≤ 9.8                            | 72.7            | 83.6            |\n| ≤ 10.4                           | 60.6            | 90.2            |\n| ≤ 11.5                           | 45.5            | 96.7            |\n\n    *Note: The test is defined as abnormal if the AM diameter is less than or equal to (≤) the cutoff value.*\n\n3.  **List Careful Points & Constraints:**\n    *   The sensitivity must be strictly `> 60%`.\n    *   The specificity must be strictly `> 80%`.\n    *   We are looking for the maximum cutoff value (`At most, what... diameter`) that satisfies *both* conditions.\n\n4.  **Evaluate Each Cutoff Value Against the Criteria:**\n    We will go through the table row by row to find which cutoff values satisfy both conditions.\n\n    *   **For a cutoff of ≤ 11.5 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 45.5%. This is **not** > 60%.\n        *   This cutoff fails.\n\n    *   **For a cutoff of ≤ 10.4 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 60.6%. This is > 60%. **(Pass)**\n        *   Specificity = 90.2%. This is > 80%. **(Pass)**\n        *   **This cutoff is a valid candidate.**\n\n    *   **For a cutoff of ≤ 9.8 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 72.7%. This is > 60%. **(Pass)**\n        *   Specificity = 83.6%. This is > 80%. **(Pass)**\n        *   **This cutoff is also a valid candidate.**\n\n    *   **For a cutoff of ≤ 8.5 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 87.9%. This is > 60%. (Pass)\n        *   Specificity = 78.7%. This is **not** > 80%.\n        *   This cutoff fails.\n\n    *   **For a cutoff of ≤ 7.2 mm:**\n        *   Sensitivity = 96.7%. This is > 60%. (Pass)\n        *   Specificity = 65.6%. This is **not** > 80%.\n        *   This cutoff fails.\n\n5.  **Identify the Final Answer:**\n    We have found two cutoff values that meet both criteria: 9.8 mm and 10.4 mm. The question asks for the maximum (\"at most\") diameter that satisfies the conditions. Comparing the valid options:\n    *   Valid cutoffs: {9.8 mm, 10.4 mm}\n    *   The maximum value in this set is 10.4 mm.\n\nTherefore, 10.4 mm is the highest cutoff value for the Aortomesenteric diameter where the sensitivity is greater than 60% and the specificity is greater than 80%.\n\n<<<10.4>>>"
