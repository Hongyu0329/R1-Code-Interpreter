To be functionally accurate, the table must change its shape in response to sunlight. At sunrise, upon being exposed to the UV light in sunlight, the table should change its configuration from a relatively straight or elongated shape (representing the stable *trans*-isomer) to a bent shape (representing the less stable *cis*-isomer). At sunset, in the absence of light, it must slowly and automatically relax back to its original, straight shape.
