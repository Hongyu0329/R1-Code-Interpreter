    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the most memory-efficient C program and calculate the memory usage.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nThe goal is to compare two strings lexicographically, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent. The strings are guaranteed to be the same length, between 1 and 100 characters.\n\n*   **Input**: Two lines, each containing one string.\n*   **Output**:\n    *   `-1` if the first string is lexicographically smaller than the second.\n    *   `1` if the first string is lexicographically larger than the second.\n    *   `0` if they are equal.\n*   **Key Constraint**: The comparison must be case-insensitive.\n\n### Step 2: Devising a Solution Strategy\nA standard approach would be to read both strings into two separate character arrays. Then, iterate through the arrays from the beginning, comparing characters at each position. For a case-insensitive comparison, we would convert both characters to a common case (e.g., lowercase) before comparing them.\n\n### Step 3: Optimizing for Memory Efficiency\nThe question specifically asks for the *most memory-efficient* program. Let's analyze the memory usage of the standard approach and see if we can improve it.\n\n*   **Standard Approach**:\n    *   `char s1[101];` // Max length 100 + 1 for null terminator `\\0`\n    *   `char s2[101];` // Max length 100 + 1 for null terminator `\\0`\n    *   This uses `101 + 101 = 202` bytes just for the string buffers.\n\n*   **Memory-Optimized Approach**:\n    Do we need to store both strings in memory at the same time? The comparison happens character by character. The input is provided on two separate lines, meaning we must read the entire first line before we can start reading the second. Therefore, we must store the first string. However, we do not need to store the entire second string. We can read the second string one character at a time and compare it against the corresponding character of the stored first string.\n\nThis leads to a more memory-efficient strategy:\n1.  Declare a character array to store the first string.\n2.  Read the first string into this array.\n3.  Read the second string character by character using a function like `getchar()`.\n4.  In a loop, compare the i-th character of the stored first string with the i-th character just read from the second string.\n5.  Terminate and print the result as soon as a difference is found.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Implementation and Variable Analysis\n\nLet's plan the variables needed for our memory-efficient C program.\n\n1.  **First String Buffer**: We need an array to hold the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need a buffer of size 101 to accommodate the null terminator.\n    *   `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory: `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1` = **101 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Character from Second String**: We need a variable to hold each character from the second string as we read it. The `getchar()` function returns an `int` so it can represent every possible character value as well as the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) marker. Therefore, this variable must be an `int`.\n    *   `int c2;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes** (on typical 32/64-bit systems).\n\n3.  **Loop Counter**: We need an index to keep track of our position in the first string. This index will go from 0 up to a maximum of 99. A variable of type `char` can hold values from -128 to 127 (if signed) or 0 to 255 (if unsigned), which is more than sufficient. Using `char` is more memory-efficient than `int`.\n    *   `char i;`\n    *   Memory: `sizeof(char)` = **1 byte**.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Input Reading**: When using `scanf(\"%s\", s1)` to read the first string, it leaves the newline character (`\\n`) in the input buffer. Subsequent calls to `getchar()` would immediately read this newline. We must consume it before reading the second string. A robust way is a small loop: `while (getchar() != '\\n');`.\n*   **Case Conversion**: The `tolower()` function from the `<ctype.h>` library is perfect for converting characters to lowercase for comparison.\n*   **Early Exit**: The program should print the result and terminate as soon as the first difference between the strings is found. This is efficient in terms of execution time. If the loop completes without finding any difference, the strings are equal.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating Total Memory (m)\n\nThe total memory `m` used by the variables in this optimized program is the sum of the memory used by each variable.\n\n*   Memory for `s1`: 101 bytes\n*   Memory for `i`: 1 byte\n*   Memory for `c2`: 4 bytes\n\n**Total Memory (m)** = 101 + 1 + 4 = **106 bytes**.\n\nThis is the most memory-efficient implementation that correctly solves the problem given the constraints of standard C input/output operations.\n\n<<<106>>>"
