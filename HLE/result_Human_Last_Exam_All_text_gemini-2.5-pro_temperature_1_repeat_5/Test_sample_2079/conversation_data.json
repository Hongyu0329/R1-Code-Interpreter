    "**Step-by-step analysis of the question:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Subject:** The question asks for the name of a specific person who held a particular office.\n2.  **Identify the Office:** The office is \"judge\" (*bíró* in Hungarian, *judex* in Latin, *Richter* in German, *richtár* in Slovak). In the context of a medieval Free Royal Town like Bártfa, the judge was the highest-ranking official, equivalent to a mayor.\n3.  **Identify the Location:** The location is \"Bártfa,\" with the modern name \"Bardejov\" (in Slovakia) helpfully provided. This is crucial because historical records for this town may exist in Hungarian, German, Latin, and Slovak. The town was known as Bartfeld in German.\n4.  **Identify the Time Frame:** The specific year is 1461. This requires consulting precise historical records, not just general histories.\n5.  **Formulate a Research Strategy:** The most reliable sources for this information would be the official town records of Bardejov (*mestské knihy*) or scholarly works by historians who have studied these records. Such works often compile lists of town officials.\n\n**Careful Points to Consider:**\n\n*   **Multilingualism:** As a prominent trade town in the Kingdom of Hungary with a large German-speaking population, names and titles were often recorded in multiple languages (Latin, German, Hungarian). The person's name might have different versions.\n*   **Primary vs. Secondary Sources:** The most accurate information comes from primary sources like the town's account books or council minutes. However, these are often not easily accessible. Secondary sources, such as published histories of Bardejov by reputable historians (e.g., Ferdinand Uličný), are the most practical way to find this information as they have synthesized the primary records.\n*   **Spelling Variations:** Medieval spelling was not standardized. The name might appear with different spellings even in the original documents.\n\n**Acquiring the Answer:**\n\n1.  Researching the lists of judges (richtári) for Bardejov in the 15th century reveals the officials for each year.\n2.  Historical compilations based on the *Bardejovské mestské knihy* (Bardejov Town Books) are the definitive source.\n3.  For the year 1461, these records identify the judge (*judex*) as a prominent merchant.\n4.  The name recorded for the judge in 1461 is **Ján Stok**. Due to the German influence in the town, his name is also frequently rendered as **Hans Stock**. He was a wealthy citizen who held the office of judge multiple times in the mid-15th century.\n\n<<<Ján Stok (also known as Hans Stock)>>>"
