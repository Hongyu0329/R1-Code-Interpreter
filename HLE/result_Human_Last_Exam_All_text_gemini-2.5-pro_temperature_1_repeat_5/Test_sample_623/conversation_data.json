    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the starting molecule.**\nThe starting molecule is 1,4-¹³C glucose. This means that in the 6-carbon glucose molecule, the carbon atoms at position 1 (the aldehyde/ketone carbon) and position 4 are the heavy isotope ¹³C. All other carbons (C2, C3, C5, C6) are the standard ¹²C.\n\n```\n      ¹³CHO (C1)\n       |\n      H-C-OH (C2)\n       |\n     HO-C-H (C3)\n       |\n      H-¹³C-OH (C4)\n       |\n      H-C-OH (C5)\n       |\n       CH₂OH (C6)\n```\n\n**Step 2: Define the metabolic pathway in question.**\nThe question specifies that the glucose molecule goes through **glycolysis**. It is crucial to limit our analysis to only the steps of glycolysis. Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the net reaction and steps of glycolysis for CO₂ production.**\nThe overall net reaction for glycolysis is:\nGlucose (6C) + 2 NAD⁺ + 2 ADP + 2 Pᵢ → 2 Pyruvate (3C) + 2 NADH + 2 H⁺ + 2 ATP + 2 H₂O\n\nThe key observation here is the conservation of carbon atoms. One 6-carbon molecule (glucose) is converted into two 3-carbon molecules (pyruvate). There is no loss of carbon atoms during this process. A reaction that releases CO₂ is called a decarboxylation. If we examine the 10 enzymatic steps of glycolysis, none of them are decarboxylation reactions.\n\n**Careful Point 1: Distinguish glycolysis from subsequent pathways.**\nIt is common to consider the complete oxidation of glucose, which includes processes that occur *after* glycolysis, such as the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC) reaction and the Krebs (TCA) Cycle. Both of these subsequent pathways *do* release CO₂.\n*   **PDC Reaction:** Converts Pyruvate (3C) to Acetyl-CoA (2C), releasing one molecule of CO₂.\n*   **Krebs Cycle:** Oxidizes the two carbons from Acetyl-CoA, releasing two molecules of CO₂ per cycle.\n\nHowever, the question explicitly asks only about **glycolysis**. We must not include these later steps in our analysis.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the labeled carbons to the end product of glycolysis (for completeness).**\nAlthough we've established that no CO₂ is produced, it's useful to see where the ¹³C labels end up.\n*   Glucose (C1-C6) is cleaved by the enzyme aldolase into two 3-carbon molecules: Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP, from C1-C3) and Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P, from C4-C6).\n*   The DHAP molecule contains the **¹³C** from the original C1 of glucose.\n*   The G3P molecule contains the **¹³C** from the original C4 of glucose.\n*   DHAP is then converted into G3P. Both 3-carbon molecules are then converted to pyruvate.\n*   The final result is two pyruvate molecules. One pyruvate molecule will be ¹³C-labeled at its carboxyl carbon (derived from C4 of glucose). The other pyruvate molecule will be ¹³C-labeled at its methyl carbon (derived from C1 of glucose).\n*   This confirms that the ¹³C labels are retained within the carbon skeletons of the pyruvate molecules and are not lost.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the final answer.**\nSince the process of glycolysis does not involve any decarboxylation reactions, no CO₂ is produced at all. Therefore, the number of ¹³C-labeled CO₂ molecules released during glycolysis is zero.\n\n<<<0>>>"
