    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:**\n    *   **Book:** *The House of the Wolfings* by William Morris.\n    *   **Action 1:** A character must have visited a Roman city.\n    *   **Action 2:** This character describes the religious practices of the Romans.\n    *   **Specific Detail:** The description must contain details that a reader would recognize as the story of Romulus and Remus (the legendary founders of Rome, suckled by a she-wolf).\n    *   **Goal:** Identify this specific character.\n\n2.  **Evaluate Potential Characters:**\n    *   **Thiodolf:** He is the leader of the Wolfings and the protagonist. His primary interaction with the Romans is as a military adversary on the battlefield. The narrative does not place him in a Roman city as an observer.\n    *   **The Wood-Sun (or Hall-Sun):** She is a supernatural being, a daughter of a god, and her focus is on protecting Thiodolf and the tribe from within their own lands. It is highly unlikely she would have traveled to a Roman city.\n    *   **Other Wolfing warriors:** Like Thiodolf, their experience with Romans is primarily military and they are defined by their life within the Gothic \"Mark\" (their homeland).\n    *   **Otter:** He is an old thrall (a servant or bondsman) in the household of Thiodolf. A key part of his backstory is that he was captured by the Romans in his youth and lived among them as a slave for a significant period before returning to the Wolfings. This background makes him the most plausible candidate to have firsthand knowledge of Roman life and cities.\n\n3.  **Locate the Relevant Passage in the Text:**\n    *   The key conversation occurs in Chapter IV, \"The Chamber of the Wall-hangings.\"\n    *   In this chapter, the leaders of the Wolfings are gathered, discussing the nature of the Romans they are about to fight.\n    *   Otter, the old thrall, is asked to share his knowledge since he has lived among them.\n\n4.  **Analyze Otter's Description:**\n    *   Otter speaks of his time as a thrall in a Roman town.\n    *   He describes seeing the Romans' \"holy places\" and the images of their gods.\n    *   He explicitly states that he saw an image of **\"a she-wolf giving suck to two man-children.\"**\n    *   He then explains the story the Romans told him: that these two children were the founders of their first and greatest city, and that because of this, the Romans themselves claim kinship with the wolf. This creates a powerful irony, as the Romans look down on the \"barbarian\" Wolfings, yet their own foundational myth is tied to a wolf.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Otter is the character who visited a Roman city (as a captive).\n    *   He describes their religious art and legends.\n    *   His description of a she-wolf suckling two infant boys who founded a great city is an unmistakable reference to the myth of Romulus and Remus.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is meticulously derived from the detailed analysis above.\n\n<<<Otter>>>"
