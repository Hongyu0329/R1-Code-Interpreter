    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query asks for a specific Oscar-nominated film identified by a key scene. The critical elements are:\n    *   A character is on a bus.\n    *   The character says the words \"Thank you.\"\n    *   This act of saying \"Thank you\" seals the character's fate, implying it leads to a tragic or irreversible outcome (like capture or death).\n    *   The film must have been nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar).\n\n2.  **Initial Brainstorming and Keyword Association:** The scenario suggests a thriller or drama where a character is in hiding or on the run. A simple act of politeness becoming a fatal mistake is a powerful cinematic trope. The bus setting implies travel and escape.\n\n3.  **Evaluate Potential Candidates:**\n    *   ***The Fugitive*** **(1993):** This film has a famous scene involving a bus. Dr. Richard Kimble, on the run, is recognized by a doctor from the hospital where he was working undercover. The doctor sees Kimble on the bus and says \"Thank you\" to him (for helping a patient earlier). Kimble's fatal mistake is turning his head in acknowledgement, confirming his identity. However, in this case, the main character *receives* the \"Thank you,\" he doesn't say it. So, this doesn't quite match.\n    *   ***Babel*** **(2006):** In one of the film's storylines, the deaf-mute Japanese teenager Chieko (played by Rinko Kikuchi, who received an Oscar nomination) is on a bus. After a boy she likes acknowledges a note she wrote him, she audibly whispers \"Arigatou\" (\"Thank you\"). This is a profound emotional moment for her, but it doesn't seal her fate in a negative, plot-ending way. It's a moment of personal breakthrough, not doom.\n    *   ***No Country for Old Men*** **(2007):** This film fits the criteria perfectly. The character Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) is on a bus, trying to escape with a satchel of money. A man carrying a chicken in a cage sits near him. As this man disembarks from the bus, he says something to Moss. Moss, out of simple courtesy, replies, **\"Thank you.\"** This seemingly innocent interaction is his undoing. The man with the chicken is an informant who, after getting off the bus, immediately calls the cartel members hunting Moss, revealing his location. This direct chain of events leads to the hotel where Moss is ambushed and killed. His fate is sealed by that polite utterance.\n\n4.  **Verify the \"Oscar-Nominated\" Criterion:** *No Country for Old Men* was a critical darling. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor. Therefore, it clearly meets this condition.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **The speaker:** It is crucial that the character whose fate is sealed is the one who says \"Thank you.\" This is why *The Fugitive* is not the correct answer.\n*   **The consequence:** \"Seals his fate\" implies a direct and fatalistic link between the action and the outcome. In *No Country for Old Men*, the \"Thank you\" leads directly to Moss's location being compromised and his subsequent death.\n*   **The setting:** The action occurs while the character is on a bus, which is a key visual element of the scene.\n\nBy carefully analyzing these points, we can confidently identify the correct film.\n\n<<<No Country for Old Men"
