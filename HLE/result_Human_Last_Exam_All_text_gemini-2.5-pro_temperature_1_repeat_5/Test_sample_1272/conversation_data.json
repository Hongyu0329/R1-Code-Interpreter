    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the location of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the historical context and the key figures.**\nThe question concerns the military campaigns of the Ming Dynasty in Vietnam during the early 15th century. This period is known in Vietnam as the Fourth Era of Northern Domination (1407-1427). The key figure is the Ming General Mu Sheng (沐晟), and the context is his involvement in the war against the Vietnamese resistance movement, the Lam Sơn uprising, led by Lê Lợi.\n\n**Step 2: Pinpoint the specific event of Mu Sheng's defeat.**\nIn 1427, the Ming Emperor sent two large armies to quell the Lam Sơn rebellion. One was commanded by General Liu Sheng (柳升), and the other, a reinforcing army coming from Yunnan, was commanded by Mu Sheng. Liu Sheng's army was ambushed and annihilated at the Battle of Chi Lăng - Xương Giang. Upon receiving news of this catastrophic defeat, Mu Sheng, whose army had advanced into Vietnamese territory, lost his morale and decided to retreat.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the battle where Mu Sheng was defeated.**\nAs Mu Sheng's forces were retreating, Lê Lợi ordered his generals, including Phạm Văn Xảo and Trịnh Khả, to pursue and attack them. The Vietnamese forces caught up with the retreating Ming army and engaged them in a decisive battle. This engagement is known historically as the Battle of Lãnh Câu – Đan Xá (Trận Lãnh Câu – Đan Xá). The Ming army was routed, suffering immense casualties. Mu Sheng was forced to abandon his official seals, equipment, and supplies, and barely managed to escape with his own life. This was his first and most significant defeat in this war.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the geographical location of the battle.**\nVietnamese historical annals, such as the *Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư*, place the battle sites of Lãnh Câu (冷溝, literally \"Cold Ditch\") and Đan Xá (丹舍, \"Cinnabar Abode\") in the mountainous region of the historical administrative unit known as Mường Lễ (châu Mường Lễ).\n\n**Step 5: Correlate the historical location to a current Vietnamese province.**\nThe historical region of Mường Lễ is located in the western, mountainous frontier of Vietnam. Today, this area corresponds to the modern district of Mường Lát and surrounding parts of Quan Hóa District. Both of these districts are part of **Thanh Hóa Province**.\n\n**Careful Points to Note:**\n*   **Specificity of \"First Major Defeat\":** This defeat was Mu Sheng's defining failure within the context of the Lam Sơn War. It was a direct consequence of the main Ming army's destruction and effectively ended the Ming campaign of 1427.\n*   **Distinguishing from other Battles:** It is important not to confuse this event with the Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động (1426, where Wang Tong was the commander) or the Battle of Chi Lăng – Xương Giang (1427, where Liu Sheng was the commander). Mu Sheng's defeat happened *after* Liu Sheng's.\n*   **Geographical Translation:** The key is accurately translating the historical place names (Lãnh Câu, Đan Xá, Mường Lễ) to their modern geographical equivalents, which points squarely to Thanh Hóa Province.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the historical accounts of the Battle of Lãnh Câu – Đan Xá in 1427, the site of Ming General Mu Sheng's first major defeat is located in what is now Thanh Hóa Province in Vietnam.\n\n<<<Thanh Hóa Province>>>"
