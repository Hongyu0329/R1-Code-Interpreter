    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n### Step 1: Write down the equations\nThe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ describe the motion of a viscous, incompressible fluid. Let the velocity field be $\\mathbf{u} = (u, v, w)$ and the pressure be $p$. The independent variables are time $t$ and spatial coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x, y, z)$. The equations are:\n\n1.  **Momentum Equation:** $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} = -\\nabla p + \\nu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}$\n2.  **Incompressibility Condition:** $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$\n\nHere, $\\nu$ is the constant kinematic viscosity, and the density $\\rho$ has been set to 1 by absorbing it into the pressure term. We have a system of 4 partial differential equations for 4 unknown functions ($u, v, w, p$).\n\n### Step 2: Define and find the Lie group of symmetries\nA Lie group of symmetries is a group of transformations of the independent and dependent variables $(t, \\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u}, p)$ that maps solutions of the equations to other solutions. We find the corresponding Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators using the Lie symmetry method. An infinitesimal generator is a vector field of the form:\n$V = \\tau \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\xi_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_i} + \\phi_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u_i} + \\psi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}$\nApplying the invariance condition to the Navier-Stokes system leads to a set of determining equations for the coefficients $\\tau, \\xi_i, \\phi_i, \\psi$. Solving these equations yields the basis of the Lie algebra. The dimension of the Lie group is the dimension of this algebra.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the generators of the symmetry algebra\n\nThe complete analysis is lengthy, but we can build the algebra by identifying the physical and mathematical symmetries of the equations.\n\n1.  **Time Translation:** The equations do not explicitly depend on $t$. Shifting time $t \\to t + c$ is a symmetry.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_t$\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\n2.  **Spatial Translations:** The equations are invariant under a rigid shift of the coordinate system $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}$.\n    *   Generators: $\\partial_x, \\partial_y, \\partial_z$\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n3.  **Spatial Rotations:** The equations are isotropic, meaning they are invariant under rigid rotations of the coordinate system, $\\mathbf{x} \\to R\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{u} \\to R\\mathbf{u}$ where $R \\in SO(3)$.\n    *   Generators: $y\\partial_x - x\\partial_y + v\\partial_u - u\\partial_v$, etc. (3 generators for rotations about the x, y, and z axes).\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n4.  **Galilean Boosts:** The equations are invariant under a transformation to a uniformly moving reference frame: $\\mathbf{x} \\to \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{c}t$, $\\mathbf{u} \\to \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{c}$.\n    *   Generators: $t\\partial_x + \\partial_u$, etc. (3 generators for boosts along the x, y, and z axes).\n    *   Dimension: **3**\n\n5.  **Scaling (Dilation):** The equations possess a scaling symmetry. If $(\\mathbf{u}(\\mathbf{x}, t), p(\\mathbf{x}, t))$ is a solution, then so is $(\\alpha^{-1}\\mathbf{u}(\\alpha\\mathbf{x}, \\alpha^2 t), \\alpha^{-2}p(\\alpha\\mathbf{x}, \\alpha^2 t))$ for any constant $\\alpha$.\n    *   Generator: $2t\\partial_t + x\\partial_x + y\\partial_y + z\\partial_z - u\\partial_u - v\\partial_v - w\\partial_w - 2p\\partial_p$\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\nSumming these up gives $1+3+3+3+1 = 11$ generators. This 11-dimensional algebra is known as the Galilean-similitude algebra.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the role of pressure and the infinite-dimensional symmetry\n\nA crucial point is that the pressure $p$ only appears in the momentum equation through its gradient, $\\nabla p$. This means the equation is invariant if we replace $p$ with $p + f(t)$, where $f(t)$ is any arbitrary function of time. The infinitesimal generator for this transformation is $f(t)\\partial_p$.\n\nSince $f(t)$ is an arbitrary function, it can be represented by an infinite basis (e.g., Taylor or Fourier series). This implies that the full Lie group of point symmetries is **infinite-dimensional**.\n\n### Step 5: Resolve the ambiguity and find the canonical finite dimension\n\nThe question asks for \"the dimension\", which typically implies a finite, well-defined number. This requires adopting a standard convention to handle the infinite-dimensional part.\n\n*   **Convention 1: The Principal Algebra.** One can consider the symmetries of the velocity field alone by eliminating the pressure. This is equivalent to finding the factor algebra of the full symmetry algebra by its infinite-dimensional ideal. This algebra is precisely the 11-dimensional Galilean-similitude algebra found in Step 3.\n\n*   **Convention 2: The Maximal Finite-Dimensional Subalgebra.** A more common approach in the literature is to identify the largest, most natural, finite-dimensional subalgebra. The infinite ideal is generated by $\\{f(t)\\partial_p\\}$. The simplest such generator is for $f(t) = \\text{constant}$, which corresponds to a constant pressure shift, $p \\to p+c$. This is a fundamental physical indeterminacy.\n    *   Generator: $\\partial_p$\n    *   Dimension: **1**\n\nLet's check if the algebra formed by the 11 generators from Step 3 and this new generator $\\partial_p$ is closed (i.e., forms a Lie algebra). One must compute the commutator of $\\partial_p$ with all other 11 generators. The only non-zero commutator is with the scaling generator:\n$[2t\\partial_t + \\dots - 2p\\partial_p, \\partial_p] = 2\\partial_p$.\nSince the result is a multiple of $\\partial_p$, it remains within the algebra. All other commutators are zero. Therefore, the set of these $11+1=12$ generators forms a closed 12-dimensional Lie algebra.\n\nThis 12-dimensional algebra is the direct sum of the 11-dimensional Galilean-similitude algebra and the 1-dimensional algebra for constant pressure shifts, as vector spaces, but has a semidirect product structure as a Lie algebra. It is the most commonly cited finite-dimensional symmetry algebra for the Navier-Stokes equations. Adding any other generator from the infinite ideal (like $t\\partial_p$) would force the inclusion of others, leading down a path toward an infinite-dimensional algebra.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe full Lie symmetry group is infinite-dimensional. However, the standard answer for the dimension of the \"essential\" or \"maximal finite\" Lie group of symmetries is obtained by combining the 11-dimensional Galilean-similitude algebra with the symmetry corresponding to a constant shift in pressure.\n\nThe dimension is the sum of the dimensions from the identified generators:\n1 (time translation) + 3 (space translations) + 3 (rotations) + 3 (Galilean boosts) + 1 (scaling) + 1 (constant pressure shift) = 12.\n\n<<<12>>>"
