    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The request asks for the *first statute* passed in the *modern State of Israel* (i.e., after its establishment in 1948) that *explicitly* used the term \"good faith\".\n\n2.  **Identify the Key Concept:** The core legal concept is \"good faith\". In Israeli law, this is most commonly expressed by the Hebrew term \"תום לב\" (*tom lev*). The statute must contain this term or its direct English equivalent in its text.\n\n3.  **Initial Brainstorming and Common Misconceptions:**\n    *   Many people associate the principle of good faith in Israeli law with the **Contracts (General Part) Law, 1973**. This law is famous for establishing good faith as a broad, overarching principle governing the negotiation (Section 12) and performance (Section 39) of all contracts.\n    *   While revolutionary in its scope, the 1973 Contracts Law was not the *first* time the term appeared in an Israeli statute. The question asks for the very first instance.\n\n4.  **Chronological Search for Earlier Statutes:** We must look for laws enacted between 1948 and 1973 that explicitly mention \"good faith\" (*tom lev*).\n    *   **Land Law, 1969:** This law is a strong candidate. Section 9, which deals with conflicting transactions, gives priority to the first transaction unless the second party acted in \"good faith\" (*tom lev*), paid consideration, and had their transaction registered. This statute from 1969 clearly predates the 1973 Contracts Law.\n    *   **Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version], 1957:** This statute is even earlier. It is a \"New Version\" enacted by the Israeli Knesset, which consolidated and replaced the previous British Mandate-era ordinance. As a Knesset enactment, it qualifies as a \"statute in the modern State of Israel\". Section 28 of this Ordinance defines a \"holder in due course\" as someone who took a bill of exchange, among other things, \"in good faith\" (*b'tom lev*).\n\n5.  **Comparison and Conclusion:**\n    *   The Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version] was enacted in **1957**.\n    *   The Land Law was enacted in **1969**.\n    *   The Contracts (General Part) Law was enacted in **1973**.\n\n    Comparing the dates, the 1957 statute is the earliest of these key laws to explicitly introduce the term \"good faith\" into the legislation of the modern State of Israel. While its application was specific (to the holder of a bill of exchange) and not a general principle, it was the first explicit statutory use of the concept.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Modern State of Israel:** The statute must be an act of the Knesset, not a holdover from the British Mandate (unless it was re-enacted by the Knesset, which is the case here).\n*   **Explicitly Introduce:** The law must use the actual words \"good faith\" or \"*tom lev*\". An implied duty is not sufficient to answer the question.\n*   **\"First\" vs. \"Most Important\":** The question is about chronological order, not legal impact. The 1973 Contracts Law had a far greater impact on the development of the good faith doctrine, but the 1957 Ordinance used the term first.\n*   **Statute Naming:** The \"[New Version]\" is a crucial part of the statute's name, as it signifies that it is the Israeli Knesset's enactment, distinct from the original Mandate-era law.\n\nBased on this analysis, the first statute is the Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version].\n\n<<<Bills of Exchange Ordinance [New Version]>>>"
