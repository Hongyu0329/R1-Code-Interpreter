    "An elegant explanation of the method, followed by a step-by-step thinking process, and finally the answer.\n\n### Step-by-step analysis of the algorithm and its complexity\n\n**1. Understanding the Algorithm**\n\nThe provided algorithm, `IMAG(n, c)`, is the standard method for converting a non-negative integer `n` into its representation in a different base `c`. It works by repeatedly taking the remainder and the quotient of the number divided by the base `c`.\n\n*   `a_0 := x — qc` is equivalent to `a_0 := x mod c`. This calculates the least significant digit.\n*   `q := ⌊x/c⌋` calculates the integer quotient.\n*   The `while` loop continues this process: the new number to be converted (`x`) becomes the previous quotient (`q`), and the next digit is calculated as the remainder of this new `x` divided by `c`.\n*   This process continues until the quotient `q` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been found.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Computational Steps**\n\nWe need to determine the cost of the algorithm by counting the number of basic operations it performs as a function of its input size, `n`.\n\n*   **Step 1: Initialization**\n    *   `i := 0; x := n; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_0 := x — qc;`\n    *   This step consists of two assignments, one integer division, one multiplication, and one subtraction. These are all considered elementary operations. Assuming they each take a constant amount of time, the total time for this step is constant, which we denote as **O(1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2: The `while` loop**\n    *   This is the main part of the algorithm. To find its complexity, we need to determine two things:\n        1.  How much work is done in each iteration of the loop?\n        2.  How many times does the loop iterate?\n\n*   **Step 2.1: Work per Iteration**\n    *   `i := i + 1; x := q; q := ⌊x/c⌋; a_i := x — qc;`\n    *   The body of the loop consists of an increment, an assignment, a division, a multiplication, and a subtraction. Just like the initialization step, this is a fixed number of elementary operations. Therefore, the time complexity of a single loop iteration is constant, **O(1)**.\n\n*   **Step 2.2: Number of Iterations**\n    *   The loop runs as long as `q > 0`.\n    *   Let's trace the value that gets repeatedly divided. This value is `x`, which starts at `n`.\n    *   Before the loop, `q` is `⌊n/c⌋`.\n    *   In the first iteration, `x` becomes `⌊n/c⌋`, and the new `q` becomes `⌊(⌊n/c⌋)/c⌋`, which is equivalent to `⌊n/c²⌋`.\n    *   In the second iteration, the new `q` will be `⌊n/c³⌋`.\n    *   In general, after `k` iterations of the loop, the value of `q` will be `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋`.\n    *   The loop terminates when `q` becomes 0. This happens when `⌊n/c^(k+1)⌋ = 0`, which is true if and only if `n/c^(k+1) < 1`, or `n < c^(k+1)`.\n    *   To find the number of iterations `k`, we can solve for `k`:\n        `c^(k+1) > n`\n        `k+1 > log_c(n)`\n        `k > log_c(n) - 1`\n    *   The number of iterations `k` is the smallest integer satisfying this, which means `k` is approximately `log_c(n)`. The exact number of iterations is `⌊log_c(n)⌋` (for `n ≥ c`).\n    *   Therefore, the number of loop iterations is proportional to `log_c(n)`. The complexity for the number of iterations is **O(log_c(n))**.\n\n**3. Calculating Total Time Complexity**\n\nThe total time complexity is the sum of the complexities of its parts. The dominant part is the `while` loop.\n\nTotal Time = (Time for Initialization) + (Number of Iterations) × (Time per Iteration)\nTotal Time = `O(1) + O(log_c(n)) * O(1)`\nTotal Time = `O(log_c(n))`\n\n**4. Final Simplification**\n\nIn Big-O notation, the base of a logarithm is not significant because of the change of base formula: `log_c(n) = log(n) / log(c)`. Since `c` is a constant (`c ≥ 2`), `log(c)` is also a constant. In Big-O analysis, we ignore constant factors.\n\nTherefore, `O(log_c(n))` is equivalent to `O(log n)`.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Model of Computation:** The analysis assumes that basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on integers take constant time, O(1). This is a standard assumption when the numbers `n` and `c` fit within a computer's word size.\n2.  **Input Parameter:** The complexity is measured with respect to the magnitude of the input integer `n`.\n3.  **Loop Invariant:** The core of the analysis is recognizing that the value being processed (`n`, then `⌊n/c⌋`, then `⌊n/c²⌋`, etc.) decreases by a multiplicative factor (`c`) in each step. This multiplicative reduction is the hallmark of a logarithmic time complexity.\n4.  **Edge Cases:** For `n < c`, `q` is initialized to 0, and the `while` loop does not execute at all. The algorithm finishes in O(1) time. This is consistent with the `O(log n)` result, as for small `n`, `log n` is a small constant, and asymptotic analysis is concerned with the behavior as `n` grows very large.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe computational time complexity of the algorithm is determined by the number of times the `while` loop executes. In each iteration, the value of `x` is effectively divided by the base `c`. The number of times you can divide `n` by `c` until the result is 0 is given by the logarithm of `n` to the base `c`, which is `log_c(n)`. Since each loop iteration takes constant time, the total time complexity is `O(log_c(n))`. In Big-O notation, the base of the logarithm is considered a constant factor and is omitted.\n\n<<<O(log n)>>>"
