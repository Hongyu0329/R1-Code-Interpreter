    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the Poincaré polynomial of the given Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nThe Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is a 6-dimensional real Lie algebra with basis $\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_6\\}$ and the following non-zero commutation relations:\n$[e_1, e_2] = e_3$\n$[e_1, e_3] = e_4$\n$[e_1, e_5] = e_6$\nAll other brackets among basis vectors are zero, up to skew-symmetry.\n\nWe can decompose this Lie algebra into two well-known Lie algebras that are \"glued\" along a common subalgebra.\nLet's define two subalgebras of $\\mathfrak{g}$:\n1.  Let $\\mathfrak{g}_A = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$. The commutation relations within this set are $[e_1, e_2] = e_3$ and $[e_1, e_3] = e_4$. This is the 4-dimensional standard filiform nilpotent Lie algebra, often denoted as $\\mathfrak{f}_4$.\n2.  Let $\\mathfrak{g}_B = \\text{span}\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$. The commutation relation is $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. This is the 3-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra, denoted as $\\mathfrak{h}_3$.\n\nBoth $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ share the 1-dimensional subalgebra $\\mathfrak{k} = \\text{span}\\{e_1\\}$.\nThe original algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ is constructed from $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ by taking their direct sum as vector spaces and identifying the copies of $\\mathfrak{k}$. The commutation relations in $\\mathfrak{g}$ are precisely the union of those in $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$, with brackets between elements from $\\mathfrak{g}_A \\setminus \\mathfrak{k}$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B \\setminus \\mathfrak{k}$ being zero. For example, $[e_2, e_5]=0$. This structure is known as the fiber product (or pullback) of $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ over $\\mathfrak{k}$, denoted $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{g}_A \\oplus_{\\mathfrak{k}} \\mathfrak{g}_B$.\n\n**Step 2: Use the property of the Poincaré polynomial for a fiber product**\n\nFor a fiber product of Lie algebras as described above, the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is the tensor product of the complexes of $\\mathfrak{g}_A$ and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$ over the complex of $\\mathfrak{k}$. This leads to a relationship between their Poincaré polynomials. A standard result from homological algebra (related to the Mayer-Vietoris sequence) gives the following formula for the Poincaré polynomials:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{g}_A}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{g}_B}(x)}{P_{\\mathfrak{k}}(x)}$\n\nWe need to compute the Poincaré polynomials for $\\mathfrak{k}$, $\\mathfrak{g}_A$, and $\\mathfrak{g}_B$.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{k} = \\mathbb{R}$**\n\n$\\mathfrak{k}$ is the 1-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. Its cohomology is $H^0(\\mathfrak{k}) = \\mathbb{R}$ and $H^1(\\mathfrak{k}) = \\mathbb{R}$. So the Betti numbers are $b_0=1, b_1=1$.\n$P_{\\mathfrak{k}}(x) = 1 + x$.\n\n**Step 4: Compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}_B = \\mathfrak{h}_3$**\n\n$\\mathfrak{g}_B$ has basis $\\{e_1, e_5, e_6\\}$ with $[e_1, e_5] = e_6$. Let the dual basis be $\\{e^1, e^5, e^6\\}$. The Chevalley-Eilenberg differential is given by:\n$de^1=0, de^5=0, de^6 = -e^1 \\wedge e^5$.\nThe Betti numbers are:\n$b_0 = 1$.\n$b_1 = \\dim H^1$: Closed 1-forms are spanned by $\\{e^1, e^5\\}$. $H^1 = \\text{span}\\{[e^1], [e^5]\\}$. So $b_1=2$.\n$b_2 = \\dim H^2$: The space of 2-forms $\\Lambda^2(\\mathfrak{g}_B^*)$ is spanned by $\\{e^1\\wedge e^5, e^1\\wedge e^6, e^5\\wedge e^6\\}$. All 2-forms are closed. The image of $d_1$ is $\\text{span}\\{de^6\\} = \\text{span}\\{e^1\\wedge e^5\\}$. So $b_2 = \\dim(\\ker d_2) - \\dim(\\text{im} d_1) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\n$b_3 = \\dim H^3$: The image of $d_2$ is zero. The space of 3-forms has dimension 1. So $b_3 = 1 - 0 = 1$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{h}_3$ is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3 = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$.\n\n**Step 5: Compute the Poincaré polynomial of $\\mathfrak{g}_A = \\mathfrak{f}_4$**\n\n$\\mathfrak{g}_A$ has basis $\\{e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4\\}$ with $[e_1, e_2] = e_3, [e_1, e_3] = e_4$. Let the dual basis be $\\{e^1, e^2, e^3, e^4\\}$. The differential is:\n$de^1=0, de^2=0, de^3 = -e^1 \\wedge e^2, de^4 = -e^1 \\wedge e^3$.\nThe Betti numbers are:\n$b_0 = 1$.\n$b_1 = \\dim H^1$: Closed 1-forms are spanned by $\\{e^1, e^2\\}$. So $b_1=2$.\n$b_2 = \\dim H^2$: Closed 2-forms are spanned by $\\{e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3, e^1\\wedge e^4, e^2\\wedge e^3\\}$. Image of $d_1$ is $\\text{span}\\{e^1\\wedge e^2, e^1\\wedge e^3\\}$. So $b_2 = 4-2=2$.\n$b_3 = \\dim H^3$: All 3-forms are closed ($\\dim \\ker d_3 = \\binom{4}{3}=4$). Image of $d_2$ is spanned by $d(e^2\\wedge e^4)=e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^3$ and $d(e^3\\wedge e^4)=-e^1\\wedge e^2\\wedge e^4$. So $\\dim(\\text{im} d_2)=2$. Thus $b_3 = 4-2=2$.\n$b_4 = \\dim H^4$: All 4-forms are closed. Image of $d_3$ is zero. So $b_4=1$.\nThe Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{f}_4$ is:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x) = 1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4$.\n\n**Step 6: Compute the final Poincaré polynomial for $\\mathfrak{g}$**\n\nNow we combine the results using the formula from Step 2:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{P_{\\mathfrak{f}_4}(x) \\cdot P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x)}{P_{\\mathbb{R}}(x)}$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + x^3)}{1+x}$\nUsing the factorization $P_{\\mathfrak{h}_3}(x) = (1+x)(1+x+x^2)$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = \\frac{(1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) \\cdot (1+x)(1+x+x^2)}{1+x}$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) (1+x+x^2)$\n\nLet's expand this product:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + x^2 \\cdot (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4)$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = (1 + 2x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + x^4) + (x + 2x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + x^5) + (x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x^4 + 2x^5 + x^6)$\nCollecting terms by powers of $x$:\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + (2+1)x + (2+2+1)x^2 + (2+2+2)x^3 + (1+2+2)x^4 + (1+2)x^5 + x^6$\n$P_{\\mathfrak{g}}(x) = 1 + 3x + 5x^2 + 6x^3 + 5x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6$\n\nFinal check: The coefficients are symmetric ($b_k = b_{6-k}$), as expected from Poincaré duality for Lie algebra cohomology.\n\nThe final answer is the polynomial we have computed.\n\n<<<1 + 3*x + 5*x^2 + 6*x^3 + 5*x^4 + 3*x^5 + x^6>>>"
