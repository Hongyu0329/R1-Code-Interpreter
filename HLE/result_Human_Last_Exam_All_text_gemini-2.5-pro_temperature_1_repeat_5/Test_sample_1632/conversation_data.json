    "This problem asks for the number of 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice, also known as a Manhattan lattice. This is a classic problem in combinatorial mathematics and statistical physics.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n*   **Manhattan Lattice:** A grid of points with integer coordinates (x, y).\n*   **Walk:** A sequence of points, starting at the origin (0,0), where each subsequent point is a neighbor (up, down, left, or right) of the previous one.\n*   **n-step walk:** A walk consisting of n moves (and thus n+1 points).\n*   **Self-avoiding walk (SAW):** A walk that never visits the same point more than once.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the first few terms of the sequence a(n)**\nLet a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks.\n\n*   **n = 0:** There is one walk of length 0: just staying at the origin. So, a(0) = 1.\n*   **n = 1:** From the origin (0,0), we can move to (1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), or (0,-1). All are valid. So, `a(1) = 4`.\n*   **n = 2:** For each of the 4 initial steps, we can move to any of the 4 neighbors of the new point. However, we cannot move back to the origin. This leaves 3 valid moves for each of the 4 initial paths.\n    *   For example, if the first step is to (1,0), the second step can be to (2,0), (1,1), or (1,-1).\n    *   Total number of walks = (Number of 1-step walks) × (Choices for the 2nd step) = 4 × 3 = 12. So, `a(2) = 12`.\n*   **n = 3:** For any 2-step SAW, the endpoint is not adjacent to the origin (the only other visited point besides the immediate predecessor). Therefore, there are always 3 valid moves from the endpoint of any 2-step walk.\n    *   Total number of walks = (Number of 2-step walks) × (Choices for the 3rd step) = 12 × 3 = 36. So, `a(3) = 36`.\n*   **n = 4:** This is where it becomes more complicated. The number of available moves now depends on the specific shape of the 3-step walk.\n    *   **Case A:** The walk forms a \"U\" shape, for example, (0,0) → (1,0) → (1,1) → (0,1). The path has visited (0,0), (1,0), and (1,1). From the endpoint (0,1), the neighbors are (0,0), (1,1), (0,2), and (-1,1). Two of these neighbors, (0,0) and (1,1), have already been visited. This leaves only 2 valid moves. There are 8 such \"U\" shaped walks of length 3.\n    *   **Case B:** The walk does not form a \"U\" shape (e.g., a straight line or an \"L\" shape). For these walks, the endpoint has only one previously visited neighbor (the point it just came from). This leaves 3 valid moves. There are 36 - 8 = 28 such walks.\n    *   Total number of 4-step walks = (8 walks × 2 choices) + (28 walks × 3 choices) = 16 + 84 = 100. So, `a(4) = 100`.\n\n**Step 3: Finding a(10)**\nAs the analysis for n=4 shows, calculating a(n) by hand becomes extremely tedious and prone to error for larger n. There is no known simple closed-form formula for a(n). The values have been determined by extensive computer enumeration. This sequence is well-known and documented in resources like the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) as sequence A001411.\n\nWe list the known values of a(n):\n*   a(0) = 1\n*   a(1) = 4\n*   a(2) = 12\n*   a(3) = 36\n*   a(4) = 100\n*   a(5) = 284\n*   a(6) = 780\n*   a(7) = 2172\n*   a(8) = 5916\n*   a(9) = 16268\n*   **a(10) = 44100**\n\nThe value for a(10) is the result of these computational efforts.\n\n<<<44100>>>"
