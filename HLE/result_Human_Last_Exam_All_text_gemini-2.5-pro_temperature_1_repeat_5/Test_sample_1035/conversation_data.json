    "### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question**\n\nThe question asks for the \"minimum number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs covering all the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ where n = 35\".\n\nThe phrasing \"number of vertices in a family of bipartite graphs\" is ambiguous. Let's analyze the possible interpretations:\n*   **Interpretation A: The minimum number of graphs in the family.** This is a classic problem in graph theory, often referred to as finding the bipartite dimension or biclique cover number of a graph. The phrasing \"vertices in a family\" could be an unconventional way to refer to the graphs themselves (the elements/members of the family).\n*   **Interpretation B: The minimum number of vertices in the union of the vertex sets of the graphs.** To cover all edges of $K_{35}$, every vertex of $K_{35}$ must be an endpoint of some covered edge. This means every vertex of $K_{35}$ must belong to the vertex set of at least one of the bipartite graphs. Therefore, the union of the vertex sets must be the entire vertex set of $K_{35}$, which has 35 vertices. This answer is trivial and likely not the intent of a problem that requires analysis.\n*   **Interpretation C: The minimum sum of the number of vertices in each graph.** This is a non-standard and significantly more complex problem.\n\nGiven the context of typical graph theory problems, Interpretation A is the most plausible. We will proceed by solving for the minimum number of bipartite graphs required for the covering.\n\n**2. Formalizing the Problem**\n\nLet the complete graph be $K_{35}$ on the vertex set $V$, where $|V|=35$. We want to find the smallest integer $k$ such that there exists a family of $k$ bipartite subgraphs, $G_1, G_2, \\ldots, G_k$, whose vertex sets are subsets of $V$, and the union of their edge sets covers all the edges of $K_{35}$.\n$$ E(K_{35}) = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} E(G_i) $$\n\n**3. Relating the Bipartite Property to Vertex Partitions**\n\nA graph $G_i$ is bipartite if its vertex set $V(G_i)$ can be partitioned into two independent sets, $U_i$ and $W_i$. An edge $(u, v)$ exists in $G_i$ only if one vertex is in $U_i$ and the other is in $W_i$.\n\nFor the family of graphs $\\{G_1, \\ldots, G_k\\}$ to cover $K_{35}$, for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in V$, the edge $(u,v)$ must be present in at least one graph $G_i$. This means that for any pair $\\{u, v\\}$, there must exist an index $i$ such that $u$ and $v$ belong to different partitions in $G_i$.\n\nConversely, if for a pair of vertices $\\{u, v\\}$, they fall in the same partition set for every graph $G_i$ for which they are both vertices, then the edge $(u,v)$ will not be covered.\n\n**4. Using Binary Vectors for Representation**\n\nWe can represent the partition membership of each vertex across all $k$ graphs using binary vectors. For each vertex $v \\in V$, we can define a binary vector $c(v) = (c_1(v), c_2(v), \\ldots, c_k(v))$ of length $k$. For each graph $G_i$, we can define the partition of $V$ (not just $V(G_i)$) as follows:\n*   $v$ is in the first part if $c_i(v)=0$.\n*   $v$ is in the second part if $c_i(v)=1$.\n\nLet's construct the bipartite graphs $G_i$ on the full vertex set $V$. For each $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, let the partition be $(U_i, W_i)$ where $U_i = \\{v \\in V \\mid c_i(v)=0\\}$ and $W_i = \\{v \\in V \\mid c_i(v)=1\\}$. The edges of $G_i$ are all pairs $(u,w)$ with $u \\in U_i$ and $w \\in W_i$.\n\nThe edge $(u,v)$ is *not* in graph $G_i$ if and only if $u$ and $v$ are in the same partition set, which means $c_i(u) = c_i(v)$.\n\nIf two distinct vertices, $u$ and $v$, were assigned the same binary vector, i.e., $c(u) = c(v)$, then $c_i(u) = c_i(v)$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, k$. This would mean the edge $(u,v)$ is not contained in any of the graphs $G_i$. This would violate the condition that the family covers all edges of $K_{35}$.\n\nTherefore, to ensure all edges are covered, every vertex in $V$ must be assigned a unique binary vector of length $k$.\n\n**5. Finding the Minimum Number of Graphs**\n\nWe have $n=35$ vertices, and each must be assigned a unique binary vector of length $k$. The total number of unique binary vectors of length $k$ is $2^k$. To satisfy the condition, the number of available unique vectors must be at least the number of vertices.\n$$ 2^k \\ge n $$\nSubstituting $n=35$:\n$$ 2^k \\ge 35 $$\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer $k$ that satisfies this inequality. We can test powers of 2:\n*   $2^1 = 2$\n*   $2^2 = 4$\n*   $2^3 = 8$\n*   $2^4 = 16$\n*   $2^5 = 32$ (This is less than 35, so $k=5$ is not enough)\n*   $2^6 = 64$ (This is greater than or equal to 35)\n\nThe smallest integer $k$ satisfying the condition is 6. This is the minimum number of bipartite graphs required. This value is also given by the formula $k = \\lceil \\log_2(n) \\rceil$. For $n=35$, $k = \\lceil \\log_2(35) \\rceil = \\lceil 5.129 \\rceil = 6$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the most plausible interpretation of the question, the problem is to find the minimum number of bipartite graphs needed to cover all edges of $K_{35}$. This number is 6."
