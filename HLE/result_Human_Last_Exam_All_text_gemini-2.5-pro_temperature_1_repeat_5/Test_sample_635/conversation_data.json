    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find a left coprime factorization of the given transfer function.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\n\nWe are asked to find a left coprime factorization of the transfer function matrix $H(s)$, which means we need to find two polynomial matrices, $D(s)$ and $N(s)$, such that:\n1.  $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$.\n2.  $D(s)$ is a non-singular polynomial matrix (i.e., $\\det(D(s))$ is not identically zero).\n3.  $D(s)$ and $N(s)$ are **left coprime**. This means that the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank for all complex values of $s$. Equivalently, there exist polynomial matrices $X(s)$ and $Y(s)$ that satisfy the Bezout identity: $D(s)X(s) + N(s)Y(s) = I$.\n\n**2. Formulate the problem**\n\nThe condition $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ can be rewritten as $D(s)H(s) = N(s)$. We need to find a polynomial matrix $D(s)$ such that the product $D(s)H(s)$ results in a polynomial matrix $N(s)$.\n\nLet $D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix}$. Then $N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s) & d_{12}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s) & d_{22}(s) \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{12}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{11}(s) \\\\ d_{21}(s)\\frac{s-1}{s+1} + d_{22}(s)\\frac{2}{s^2-1} & d_{21}(s) \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nFor $N(s)$ to be a polynomial matrix, all its entries must be polynomials.\n*   From the second column, $N_{12}(s) = d_{11}(s)$ and $N_{22}(s) = d_{21}(s)$, which are already required to be polynomials as entries of $D(s)$.\n*   From the first column, the entries must also be polynomials. Let's analyze them by putting them over a common denominator, which is $s^2-1 = (s-1)(s+1)$:\n    *   $N_{11}(s) = \\frac{d_{11}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n    *   $N_{21}(s) = \\frac{d_{21}(s)(s-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(s)}{s^2-1}$\n\nFor these expressions to be polynomials, their numerators must be divisible by the denominator $s^2-1$. This means the numerators must be zero at the roots of the denominator, i.e., at $s=1$ and $s=-1$.\n\n**3. Derive Conditions on D(s)**\n\n*   **Condition at s=1:**\n    *   $d_{11}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{12}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{12}(1)=0$.\n    *   $d_{21}(1)(1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{22}(1) = 0 \\implies d_{22}(1)=0$.\n    This implies that both $d_{12}(s)$ and $d_{22}(s)$ must have a factor of $(s-1)$.\n\n*   **Condition at s=-1:**\n    *   $d_{11}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{11}(-1) + 2d_{12}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1) = 0$.\n    *   $d_{21}(-1)(-1-1)^2 + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 4d_{21}(-1) + 2d_{22}(-1) = 0 \\implies 2d_{21}(-1) + d_{22}(-1) = 0$.\n\n**4. Construct a Minimal D(s) and the corresponding N(s)**\n\nWe need to find the simplest polynomial matrix $D(s)$ that satisfies these four conditions, has a non-zero determinant, and results in a coprime pair $(D, N)$. Let's try to construct a low-degree $D(s)$.\n\nLet's try to make $D(s)$ upper triangular by setting $d_{21}(s)=0$.\n*   The condition on the second row becomes:\n    *   $d_{22}(1)=0$.\n    *   $2(0) + d_{22}(-1)=0 \\implies d_{22}(-1)=0$.\n    So, $d_{22}(s)$ must have factors $(s-1)$ and $(s+1)$. The simplest choice is $d_{22}(s) = (s-1)(s+1) = s^2-1$.\n\n*   Now for the first row, with $d_{21}(s)=0$:\n    *   $d_{12}(1)=0$.\n    *   $2d_{11}(-1) + d_{12}(-1)=0$.\n    Let's find the simplest polynomials for $d_{11}(s)$ and $d_{12}(s)$. Let's try $d_{11}(s) = 1$ (a constant). The condition becomes $2(1) + d_{12}(-1)=0 \\implies d_{12}(-1)=-2$.\n    We also need $d_{12}(1)=0$. So $d_{12}(s)$ is a polynomial that is 0 at $s=1$ and -2 at $s=-1$. We can use Lagrange interpolation or simply construct it.\n    Let $d_{12}(s) = c(s-1)$. Then $d_{12}(-1) = c(-1-1) = -2c$. We need $-2c=-2$, so $c=1$.\n    This gives $d_{12}(s) = s-1$.\n\nSo, we propose the following matrix $D(s)$:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis matrix has $\\det(D(s)) = s^2-1$, which is not identically zero.\n\nNow, we calculate the corresponding $N(s) = D(s)H(s)$:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{s-1}{s+1} & 1 \\\\ \\frac{2}{s^2-1} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{11}(s) = 1 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2(s-1)}{(s-1)(s+1)} = \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + \\frac{2}{s+1} = \\frac{s+1}{s+1} = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{12}(s) = 1 \\cdot 1 + (s-1) \\cdot 0 = 1\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{21}(s) = 0 \\cdot \\frac{s-1}{s+1} + (s^2-1) \\frac{2}{s^2-1} = 2\n\\]\n\\[\nN_{22}(s) = 0 \\cdot 1 + (s^2-1) \\cdot 0 = 0\n\\]\nSo, the resulting matrix $N(s)$ is:\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThis is a polynomial matrix, so our choice of $D(s)$ is valid for factorization.\n\n**5. Check for Left Coprimeness**\n\nWe must check if the pair $(D, N)$ is left coprime. We form the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ and check if it has full row rank (rank 2) for all complex $s$.\n\\[\n[D(s) \\quad N(s)] = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 & 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe rows of this matrix are $R_1 = [1, s-1, 1, 1]$ and $R_2 = [0, s^2-1, 2, 0]$.\nFor the rows to be linearly dependent, there must exist scalars $c_1, c_2$, not both zero, such that $c_1 R_1 + c_2 R_2 = 0$.\nLooking at the first column of the vector equation: $c_1 \\cdot 1 + c_2 \\cdot 0 = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$.\nThe equation then reduces to $c_2 R_2 = 0$. Since $R_2$ is not the zero vector for any value of $s$, this implies $c_2 = 0$.\nSince the only solution is $c_1=c_2=0$, the rows are linearly independent for all values of $s$. Therefore, the matrix $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has rank 2 for all $s$, and the pair $(D, N)$ is left coprime.\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Initial Factorization:** A simple factorization by finding the least common denominator $d(s)$ of all entries in $H(s)$ and writing $H(s) = [d(s)I]^{-1}P(s)$ is a valid factorization, but it is generally not coprime. One must cancel out common factors.\n*   **Coprimeness Check:** The most crucial part is verifying coprimeness. The condition that $[D(s) \\quad N(s)]$ has full row rank must hold for all $s \\in \\mathbb{C}$. It is often sufficient to check at the roots of $\\det(D(s))$, as these are the points where rank is most likely to drop.\n*   **Non-uniqueness:** Coprime factorizations are not unique. If $(D, N)$ is a valid left coprime factorization, then so is $(UD, UN)$ for any unimodular polynomial matrix $U$ (a square polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant). The solution found here is one of the simplest possible forms.\n*   **System Order:** For a minimal realization, the degree of the determinant of $D(s)$ should be equal to the McMillan degree of the system $H(s)$. Here, $\\deg(\\det(D(s))) = \\deg(s^2-1) = 2$. The poles of $H(s)$ are at $s = \\pm 1$, indicating a second-order system. This consistency check suggests our factorization is minimal.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA left coprime factorization $H(s) = D^{-1}(s) N(s)$ is given by:\n\\[\nD(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\\[\nN(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\n<<<\n$D(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s-1 \\\\ 0 & s^2-1 \\end{bmatrix}, N(s) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$\n>>>"
