    "An analysis of the question is as follows, with a step-by-step derivation of the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**\n\nWe are asked to find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of two 2x2 polynomial matrices, P1(s) and P2(s).\n\n*   P1(s) = [[s^2 + s, -s], [-s^2 - 1, s^2]]\n*   P2(s) = [[s, 0], [-s - 1, 1]]\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   A polynomial matrix R(s) is a **right divisor** of P(s) if P(s) = Q(s)R(s) for some polynomial matrix Q(s).\n*   A matrix R(s) is a **GCRD** if it is a common right divisor and any other common right divisor D(s) is a right divisor of R(s).\n*   The GCRD is not unique. If R(s) is a GCRD, then so is U(s)R(s) for any unimodular matrix U(s) (a polynomial matrix whose determinant is a non-zero constant). By convention, we seek the simplest form, often one that is in row-echelon form or is the identity matrix if the matrices are coprime.\n\n**Step 2: Choosing the Method**\n\nThe most systematic method to find the GCRD is the **Euclidean algorithm for polynomial matrices**. This involves stacking the matrices and performing elementary row operations to reduce them. The non-zero part of the resulting matrix will be a GCRD.\n\n**Step 3: Applying the Euclidean Algorithm**\n\n1.  **Form the stacked matrix M(s):**\n    M(s) = [P1(s)] = [[s^2 + s, -s],    (Row 1)\n            [P2(s)]]   [-s^2 - 1, s^2],    (Row 2)\n                       [s, 0],             (Row 3)\n                       [-s - 1, 1]]      (Row 4)\n\n2.  **Perform elementary row operations to reduce the matrix.** The goal is to use rows with lower-degree polynomials to simplify rows with higher-degree polynomials. We will use Row 3 and Row 4 to simplify Row 1 and Row 2.\n\n    *   **Operation 1:** Replace Row 1 with `Row 1 - (s+1) * Row 3`.\n        `[s^2 + s, -s] - (s+1)[s, 0] = [s^2 + s - s^2 - s, -s - 0] = [0, -s]`\n    *   **Operation 2:** Replace Row 2 with `Row 2 + s * Row 3`.\n        `[-s^2 - 1, s^2] + s[s, 0] = [-s^2 - 1 + s^2, s^2 + 0] = [-1, s^2]`\n    *   **Operation 3:** Replace Row 4 with `Row 4 + Row 3`.\n        `[-s - 1, 1] + [s, 0] = [-s - 1 + s, 1 + 0] = [-1, 1]`\n\n    The matrix M(s) is now row-equivalent to:\n    M'(s) = [[0, -s],        (R1')\n             [-1, s^2],      (R2')\n             [s, 0],         (R3)\n             [-1, 1]]        (R4')\n\n3.  **Continue the reduction process.** The new rows have lower degrees. Let's use the simplest new row, `R4' = [-1, 1]`, to simplify the others.\n\n    *   **Operation 4:** Replace R1' with `R1' + s * R4'`.\n        `[0, -s] + s[-1, 1] = [0 - s, -s + s] = [-s, 0]`\n    *   **Operation 5:** Replace R2' with `R2' - s^2 * R4'`.\n        `[-1, s^2] - s^2[-1, 1] = [-1 + s^2, s^2 - s^2] = [s^2 - 1, 0]`\n    *   **Operation 6:** Replace R3 with `R3 + s * R4'`.\n        `[s, 0] + s[-1, 1] = [s - s, 0 + s] = [0, s]`\n\n    The matrix is now row-equivalent to:\n    M''(s) = [[-s, 0],\n              [s^2 - 1, 0],\n              [0, s],\n              [-1, 1]]\n\n4.  **Further simplification.** We now have rows with zeros, which makes reduction easier.\n\n    *   **Operation 7:** Use `[-s, 0]` to simplify `[s^2 - 1, 0]`. Replace `[s^2 - 1, 0]` with `[s^2 - 1, 0] + s * [-s, 0]`.\n        `[s^2 - 1, 0] + [-s^2, 0] = [-1, 0]`\n    \n    The set of rows spanning the row space is now equivalent to {[-s, 0], [-1, 0], [0, s], [-1, 1]}.\n\n5.  **Final reduction steps.** Let's use the very simple rows `[-1, 0]` and `[0, s]` to eliminate the others.\n\n    *   **Operation 8:** Use `[-1, 0]` to eliminate `[-s, 0]`. Replace `[-s, 0]` with `[-s, 0] - s * [-1, 0]`.\n        `[-s, 0] - [-s, 0] = [0, 0]`\n    *   **Operation 9:** Use `[-1, 0]` to simplify `[-1, 1]`. Replace `[-1, 1]` with `[-1, 1] - 1 * [-1, 0]`.\n        `[-1, 1] - [-1, 0] = [0, 1]`\n\n    The set of non-zero rows spanning the space is now {[-1, 0], [0, s], [0, 1]}.\n\n6.  **Finalizing the basis.**\n    *   **Operation 10:** Use `[0, 1]` to eliminate `[0, s]`. Replace `[0, s]` with `[0, s] - s * [0, 1]`.\n        `[0, s] - [0, s] = [0, 0]`\n\n    After all reductions, the set of non-zero rows that form a basis for the row space of M(s) is `{[-1, 0], [0, 1]}`.\n\n**Step 4: Concluding the GCRD**\n\nThe resulting basis rows can be assembled into the GCRD matrix.\nR(s) = [[-1, 0],\n        [0, 1]]\n\nThe determinant of this matrix is `det(R(s)) = (-1)(1) - (0)(0) = -1`, which is a non-zero constant. This means R(s) is a unimodular matrix.\n\nSince the GCRD is defined up to left multiplication by a unimodular matrix, we can choose the simplest representation. A common convention is to use the identity matrix if the GCRD is unimodular. We can obtain the identity matrix by left-multiplying our result by `[[-1, 0], [0, 1]]`.\n\nThus, a GCRD of P1(s) and P2(s) is the identity matrix I. This also means that P1(s) and P2(s) are **right coprime**.\n\nFinal Answer: The greatest common right divisor is the 2x2 identity matrix.\n\n[[1, 0],\n [0, 1]]\n\n<<<[[1, 0], [0, 1]]>>>"
