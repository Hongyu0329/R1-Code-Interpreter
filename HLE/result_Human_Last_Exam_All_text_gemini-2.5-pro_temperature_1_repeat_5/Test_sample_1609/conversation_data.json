    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal number of prime implicants of a Boolean function of 4 variables, a(4).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Boolean Function of n variables:** A function `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` where the inputs `xi` and the output `f` can only be 0 (False) or 1 (True).\n*   **Minterm:** A product term (AND operation) that includes all `n` variables, either in their true or complemented form. For `n=4`, there are `2^4 = 16` minterms (from `x1'x2'x3'x4'` to `x1x2x3x4`).\n*   **Implicant:** A product term that implies the function. This means that whenever the implicant is 1, the function's output is also 1. On a Karnaugh map (K-map), an implicant corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   **Prime Implicant (PI):** An implicant that is \"maximal\" in the sense that if you remove any variable (literal) from the term, it is no longer an implicant. On a K-map, a PI corresponds to a rectangular grouping of 1s that is not contained within any larger rectangular grouping of 1s.\n*   **a(n):** The maximal number of prime implicants that any single Boolean function of `n` variables can have. We are looking for `a(4)`.\n\n**2. Develop a Strategy to Maximize the Number of Prime Implicants**\n\nTo get the highest number of PIs, we want to construct a function where its '1's form many distinct groups that cannot be combined.\n\n*   If two minterms (1s on the K-map) are combined, they form a single, simpler PI. For example, the minterms `abc'd` and `abcd` combine to form the PI `abc`. Here, two minterms result in only one PI.\n*   To maximize the number of PIs, we should try to *prevent* this combination. The most extreme case is when no two '1's on the K-map are adjacent.\n*   If no two '1's are adjacent, then each '1' (minterm) forms a group of its own that cannot be expanded. In this situation, every single minterm for which the function is true is also a prime implicant.\n*   Therefore, our strategy is to find the largest possible set of minterms for `n=4` such that no two minterms in the set are adjacent.\n\n**3. Applying the Strategy for n=4**\n\n*   **Adjacency:** Two minterms are adjacent if their binary representations differ by exactly one bit (their Hamming distance is 1).\n*   **Parity:** Let's consider the parity (whether the number of 1s is even or odd) of the binary representation of the minterms.\n    *   If a minterm has `k` ones (weight `k`), any adjacent minterm must have a weight of `k-1` or `k+1`.\n    *   This means a minterm with even weight can only be adjacent to minterms with odd weight, and vice-versa.\n*   **The Checkerboard/Parity Function:** Let's define a function `f` that is 1 for all minterms whose binary representation has an **even** number of 1s. This is also known as the even parity function.\n    *   **Weight 0:** `0000` (1 minterm)\n    *   **Weight 2:** `0011`, `0101`, `0110`, `1001`, `1010`, `1100` (6 minterms)\n    *   **Weight 4:** `1111` (1 minterm)\n*   The total number of minterms for which this function `f` is 1 is `1 + 6 + 1 = 8`.\n*   Since all of these minterms have even weight, no two of them can be adjacent (as that would require one to have odd weight).\n*   Because no two '1's of this function are adjacent on the K-map, no minterms can be combined.\n*   Therefore, each of the 8 minterms is itself a prime implicant.\n*   This construction gives us a Boolean function of 4 variables with **8** prime implicants.\n\n**4. Consider Other Possibilities and Conclude**\n\n*   **Symmetric Functions:** One might consider functions that are true only for minterms of a specific weight `k`. The number of PIs for such a function is `C(n, k)` (the number of combinations). To maximize this for `n=4`, we would choose `k=2`, which gives `C(4, 2) = (4*3)/2 = 6` prime implicants. This is less than the 8 we found with the parity function.\n*   **Known Results:** The problem of finding `a(n)` is a known topic in switching theory. For `n=4`, the maximum is indeed achieved by the parity function (or its complement, the odd parity function, which also has 8 PIs). While for some higher values of `n` (like `n=5`), other more complex constructions yield more PIs than the parity function, for `n=4`, the maximum is `2^(4-1) = 8`.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   The goal is to find the maximum for *any* function of `n` variables, not just a specific class like symmetric functions.\n*   The number of PIs is not the same as the number of minterms, unless no minterms can be combined.\n*   The strategy of creating a function from a \"maximum independent set\" of the n-cube graph (like the set of all even-parity vertices) is a powerful way to generate a large number of PIs.\n*   The parity of a minterm's binary representation is a key property for determining adjacency.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n1.  The objective is to find the maximum number of prime implicants for a 4-variable Boolean function, `a(4)`.\n2.  A method to maximize prime implicants is to choose a set of minterms such that no two are adjacent. In this case, each minterm becomes a prime implicant.\n3.  The set of all minterms with even parity (an even number of 1s in their binary form) has this property.\n4.  For `n=4`, the number of such minterms is `C(4,0) + C(4,2) + C(4,4) = 1 + 6 + 1 = 8`.\n5.  Since no two of these 8 minterms are adjacent, this function has 8 prime implicants.\n6.  This is known to be the maximal possible number for `n=4`.\n\nThus, `a(4) = 8`.\n\n<<<8>>>"
