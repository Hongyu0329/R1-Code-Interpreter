    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definition of a(n)**\n\nThe problem defines a(n) as the number of non-vanishing Feynman diagrams for the electron or the photon propagators in quantum electrodynamics (QED). The diagrams are of \"order 2n\".\n\n*   **Quantum Electrodynamics (QED):** This is the theory describing the interactions between light (photons) and matter (electrons and positrons). QED vertices consist of one incoming electron line, one outgoing electron line, and one photon line.\n*   **Electron/Photon Propagators:** These represent the propagation of an electron or a photon. The diagrams in question are corrections to these propagators, also known as self-energy diagrams. These diagrams are \"insertions\" into a propagator line, meaning they have two external lines of the same type (either two electron lines or two photon lines).\n*   **Non-vanishing:** This implies that we are counting topologically distinct diagrams that give a non-zero contribution. For self-energy diagrams, this means we are counting connected, one-particle-irreducible (1PI) diagrams. A 1PI diagram is one that cannot be cut into two separate pieces by severing a single internal line.\n*   **Order 2n:** In the context of enumerating QED diagrams, \"order 2n\" is a standard convention that refers to the number of vertices in the diagram. So, a diagram of order 2n has exactly 2n vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the specific question for a(3)**\n\nThe question asks for the value of a(3). Using the definition from Step 1:\n\n*   The index is n = 3.\n*   The order of the diagrams is 2n = 2 * 3 = 6.\n*   Therefore, the question is asking for the number of non-vanishing, 1PI, self-energy Feynman diagrams in QED that have exactly 6 vertices.\n\n**Step 3: Realize the combinatorial nature of the problem**\n\nCounting the number of topologically distinct graphs with specific properties (6 vertices, 2 external legs, and obeying QED rules) is a non-trivial combinatorial problem. Manually drawing all possible diagrams and checking for topological uniqueness is difficult and error-prone for 6 vertices.\n\n*   For n=1 (2 vertices), there is **1** diagram.\n*   For n=2 (4 vertices), there are **2** distinct diagrams.\n*   For n=3 (6 vertices), the number is significantly larger.\n\nFortunately, this specific counting problem has been extensively studied by physicists and mathematicians. The resulting sequence of numbers is well-established.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the known mathematical sequence**\n\nThe sequence a(n) corresponds to a known sequence in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). It is sequence A000698.\n\n*   **OEIS A000698 Description:** \"Number of topologically distinct Feynman diagrams for the electron or photon propagator in quantum electrodynamics (QED) with 2n vertices.\"\n*   This description perfectly matches the definition of a(n) given in the problem.\n\n**Step 5: Find the value of a(3) from the sequence**\n\nThe sequence A000698 provides the values for a(n):\n\n*   a(0) = 1 (This represents the bare propagator with 0 vertices)\n*   a(1) = 1 (This is the one-loop correction with 2 vertices)\n*   a(2) = 2 (These are the two-loop corrections with 4 vertices)\n*   **a(3) = 10** (These are the three-loop corrections with 6 vertices)\n*   a(4) = 74 (These are the four-loop corrections with 8 vertices)\n\nThe value we are looking for is a(3). According to the established sequence, this value is 10.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, a(3) is the number of 6-vertex QED self-energy diagrams. This is a known value from the combinatorial study of quantum field theory. The number is 10.\n\n<<<10>>>"
