    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The question asks to identify the person whose **lectures** were **cited** by Albert Einstein in his **1905 paper on Brownian motion**. Each part of this question is crucial.\n    *   **Subject:** Albert Einstein.\n    *   **Specific Work:** The 1905 paper on Brownian motion, officially titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\" (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n    *   **Action:** The specific action is \"cite,\" which means to formally reference in the paper.\n    *   **Object of Citation:** The specific type of work is \"lectures.\"\n\n2.  **Initial Research and Fact-Checking:** The first step is to examine the 1905 paper itself or scholarly analyses of it.\n    *   Einstein's 1905 papers (his \"Annus Mirabilis\" or \"Miracle Year\" papers) are famous not only for their content but also for their style.\n    *   A key feature of the paper on Brownian motion, as well as the paper on special relativity, is its remarkable lack of citations. Einstein built his arguments from fundamental principles and did not include a bibliography or footnotes referencing the work of other contemporary scientists on the specific topic.\n\n3.  **Address the Core of the Question (\"Cite\"):** Based on the fact-checking in the previous step, a strict and literal interpretation leads to a clear conclusion.\n    *   Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on Brownian motion contains **zero citations**. He does not formally reference any other scientist's work within the paper.\n    *   Therefore, the direct answer to \"Whose lectures did he cite?\" is **no one**.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Likely Intent of the Question (Influence vs. Citation):** Often, questions like this confuse formal \"citation\" with intellectual \"influence.\" It is highly probable that the question is actually asking about the primary intellectual influence on Einstein's work for this paper.\n    *   Einstein's paper on Brownian motion is a cornerstone of statistical mechanics, providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms.\n    *   The foundational work in the statistical interpretation of thermodynamics, which underpins Einstein's paper, was done by **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n    *   Einstein is known to have closely studied Boltzmann's work, particularly his book **\"Lectures on Gas Theory\"** (\"Vorlesungen über Gastheorie\").\n    *   This work was profoundly influential on Einstein's thinking and provided the theoretical framework he needed to develop his own ideas on statistical mechanics and apply them to Brownian motion.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the Final Answer:** While Einstein did not formally *cite* anyone in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, the ideas presented in the lectures of Ludwig Boltzmann were the essential intellectual foundation for Einstein's work. Therefore, acknowledging the nuance between \"citation\" and \"influence,\" the intended answer to the question is Ludwig Boltzmann.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is **Ludwig Boltzmann**.\n\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"
