    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Relate the Neron-Severi rank of X to the Jacobian of C\n\nLet $C$ be a Riemann surface of genus $g=3$. Let $X = C^{(15)}$ be its 15th symmetric power. The variety $X$ is the space of effective divisors of degree 15 on $C$.\nThe Neron-Severi group of a variety $V$, denoted $NS(V)$, is the group of divisors on $V$ modulo algebraic equivalence. Its rank, $\\rho(V) = \\text{rank}(NS(V))$, is also known as the Picard number of $V$.\n\nThere is a natural map, the Abel-Jacobi map, from the symmetric power $C^{(d)}$ to the Jacobian variety $J(C)$:\n$u_d: C^{(d)} \\to J(C)$\n$D \\mapsto [D - d \\cdot P_0]$\nwhere $P_0$ is a fixed base point on $C$, and $[...]$ denotes the linear equivalence class of the divisor. $J(C)$ is an abelian variety of dimension $g=3$.\n\nThe fibers of this map are the complete linear systems $|D'|$, where $D'$ is any divisor of degree $d$ representing a point in $J(C)$. The dimension of such a linear system is given by $h^0(C, \\mathcal{O}(D')) - 1$.\n\nA key result in the theory of algebraic curves states that if the degree $d$ is sufficiently large, specifically $d \\ge 2g-1$, then the Abel-Jacobi map $u_d$ gives $C^{(d)}$ the structure of a projective bundle over $J(C)$.\n\nIn our case, $g=3$ and $d=15$. The condition is $15 \\ge 2(3)-1 = 5$, which is satisfied.\nLet's determine the dimension of the fibers. The fiber over any point in $J(C)$ is a projective space $\\mathbb{P}(H^0(C, L))$ for some line bundle $L$ of degree $d=15$. The dimension of this space is $h^0(C,L)-1$.\nBy the Riemann-Roch theorem:\n$h^0(C, L) - h^1(C, L) = \\deg(L) - g + 1 = 15 - 3 + 1 = 13$.\nBy Serre duality, $h^1(C, L) = h^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1})$, where $K_C$ is the canonical bundle.\nThe degree of $K_C$ is $2g-2 = 2(3)-2 = 4$.\nThe degree of $K_C \\otimes L^{-1}$ is $\\deg(K_C) - \\deg(L) = 4 - 15 = -11$.\nSince the degree is negative, there are no non-zero global sections, so $h^0(C, K_C \\otimes L^{-1}) = 0$.\nThis implies $h^1(C, L)=0$.\nTherefore, $h^0(C, L) = 13$ for any line bundle $L$ of degree 15.\nThis means that every fiber of the map $u_{15}$ is isomorphic to the projective space $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$.\nSo, $X = C^{(15)}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}^{12}$-bundle over $J(C)$.\n\nFor a projective bundle $E \\to B$, the Neron-Severi rank is given by $\\rho(E) = \\rho(B) + 1$.\nApplying this to our situation, we get:\n$\\rho(X) = \\rho(C^{(15)}) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the smallest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe problem now is to find the range of possible values for $\\rho(J(C))$ as $C$ varies over all genus 3 curves.\nThe Jacobian $J(C)$ is a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension 3. The Neron-Severi group $NS(J(C))$ always contains the class of the principal polarization (the theta divisor). Therefore, $\\rho(J(C)) \\ge 1$.\n\nFor a generic curve $C$ of genus $g \\ge 2$, its Jacobian $J(C)$ is a simple abelian variety (i.e., it has no proper abelian subvarieties) and its ring of endomorphisms is just the integers, $\\text{End}(J(C)) = \\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, the Neron-Severi group is generated by the class of the theta divisor, so $NS(J(C)) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThus, for a generic genus 3 curve, $\\rho(J(C)) = 1$. This is the minimum possible value.\n\nThe smallest possible rank of $NS(X)$ is therefore:\n$\\rho(X)_{min} = \\rho(J(C))_{min} + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the largest possible rank of NS(J(C))\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of an abelian variety $A$ of dimension $g$ is bounded above by $\\rho(A) \\le g^2$.\nFor $J(C)$, which has dimension $g=3$, the maximum possible rank is $\\rho(J(C)) \\le 3^2 = 9$.\n\nThis theoretical maximum is achieved if and only if the abelian variety is isogenous to a product of $g$ copies of an elliptic curve with complex multiplication (CM), i.e., $A \\sim E^g$ for a CM elliptic curve $E$.\n\nWe need to verify if there exists a genus 3 curve $C$ whose Jacobian $J(C)$ has this structure. Such curves are known to exist; they are typically curves with large automorphism groups.\nA famous example is the Fermat quartic curve, given by the equation $x^4 + y^4 + z^4 = 0$ in $\\mathbb{P}^2$. This is a smooth curve of genus $g = (4-1)(4-2)/2 = 3$. Its Jacobian, $J(F)$, is known to be isogenous to $E^3$, where $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2=x^3-x$. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication by the ring of Gaussian integers $\\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\nFor such a curve $C$, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of its Jacobian is indeed $\\rho(J(C)) = 9$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value for $\\rho(J(C))$ for a genus 3 curve is 9.\n\nThe largest possible rank of $NS(X)$ is therefore:\n$\\rho(X)_{max} = \\rho(J(C))_{max} + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X = C^{(15)}$ is given by $\\rho(X) = \\rho(J(C)) + 1$.\nThe rank of the Neron-Severi group of the Jacobian of a genus 3 curve, $\\rho(J(C))$, can range from 1 (for a generic curve) to 9 (for special curves like the Fermat quartic).\nConsequently, the rank of the Neron-Severi group of $X$ can range from $1+1=2$ to $9+1=10$.\n\nThe smallest possible rank is 2.\nThe largest possible rank is 10.\n\n<<<The smallest possible rank is 2, and the largest possible rank is 10.>>>"
