    "This problem requires us to determine the linear algebraic rank of national flags when they are viewed as matrices. We need to find which African flags have the same rank as the flag of Denmark, under the condition that the numerical values assigned to the colors are chosen to maximize the rank.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n**1. Determine the Rank of the Flag of Denmark**\n\n*   **Structure:** The Danish flag has a red field with a white Nordic cross. The cross consists of a horizontal stripe and a vertical stripe.\n*   **Matrix Representation:** To analyze its rank, we represent the flag as a matrix where each entry corresponds to a \"pixel\" of color. To maximize the rank, we must assign distinct, non-zero numerical values to the colors. Let's assign Red = R and White = W, where R ≠ W and neither is zero (e.g., R=1, W=2).\n*   **Row Analysis:** When we look at the rows of this matrix, we find there are only two distinct types of rows:\n    1.  Rows that are entirely white (from the horizontal bar of the cross). These rows look like `(W, W, W, ..., W)`.\n    2.  Rows that are mostly red but are interrupted by the vertical bar of the cross. These rows look like `(R, ..., R, W, ..., W, R, ..., R)`.\n*   **Rank Calculation:** Let's call these row vectors `v_W` and `v_R_cross`.\n    *   `v_W = (W, W, ..., W)`\n    *   `v_R_cross = (R, R, ..., W, ..., R, R)`\n    Since R ≠ W, the vector `v_R_cross` (which contains both R and W values) cannot be a scalar multiple of `v_W` (which contains only W values). Therefore, these two vectors are linearly independent.\n    Since every row in the flag's matrix is either a copy of `v_W` or `v_R_cross`, the entire row space is spanned by these two vectors. The dimension of the row space is 2.\n*   **Conclusion:** The maximal rank of the flag of Denmark is 2.\n\n**2. General Principles for Flag Ranks**\n\n*   **Rank 1 Flags:** A flag will have a rank of 1 if all of its rows (or columns) are scalar multiples of each other. This is characteristic of flags with simple parallel stripes, either all horizontal or all vertical.\n    *   *Example (Horizontal Stripes):* The flag of Gabon (Green-Yellow-Blue horizontal stripes). If G=1, Y=2, B=3, the rows are `(1,1,...)`, `(2,2,...)`, and `(3,3,...)`. These are all multiples of `(1,1,...)`, so the rank is 1.\n    *   *Example (Vertical Stripes):* The flag of Nigeria (Green-White-Green vertical stripes). Every row is identical, `(G, ..., G, W, ..., W, G, ..., G)`. The rank is 1.\n*   **High-Rank Flags (Rank > 2):** Flags with complex geometric patterns (diagonals, triangles, chevrons), or those containing symbols like stars, emblems, or animals, will generate many different and unique row patterns. This leads to a rank much higher than 2.\n    *   *Example (Star):* The flag of Ghana (horizontal red-yellow-green stripes with a black star in the center). The rows without the star are linearly dependent (rank 1 structure). However, the rows that intersect the black star `(Y, ..., Y, S, ..., S, Y, ..., Y)` are linearly independent from the plain stripe rows, and there are multiple different star-intersecting rows, leading to a rank of 3 or more.\n\n**3. Analyze African Flags to Find Rank 2**\n\nWe are looking for African flags whose structure generates exactly two linearly independent row types, similar to the Danish flag.\n\n*   **Candidate 1: Madagascar**\n    *   **Structure:** A vertical white stripe at the hoist, with two horizontal stripes (red over green) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Analysis:** Let White=W, Red=R, Green=G (e.g., W=1, R=2, G=3). The matrix will have two types of rows:\n        1.  Rows in the top half: `(W, ..., W, R, ..., R)`\n        2.  Rows in the bottom half: `(W, ..., W, G, ..., G)`\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** These two row vectors, `(W,..,W,R,..,R)` and `(W,..,W,G,..,G)`, are linearly independent because R ≠ G. The row space is spanned by these two vectors. The rank is 2.\n\n*   **Candidate 2: Benin**\n    *   **Structure:** A vertical green stripe at the hoist, with two horizontal stripes (yellow over red) on the fly side.\n    *   **Row Analysis:** This flag has the exact same geometric structure as the flag of Madagascar, just with different colors. Let Green=G, Yellow=Y, Red=R. The two row types are `(G, ..., G, Y, ..., Y)` and `(G, ..., G, R, ..., R)`.\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** For the same reason as Madagascar, these two row types are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n*   **Candidate 3: Niger**\n    *   **Structure:** Three horizontal stripes (orange, white, green) with an orange circle in the center of the white stripe.\n    *   **Row Analysis:** Let Orange=O, White=W, Green=G (e.g., O=1, W=2, G=3). There are four apparent row types:\n        1.  Rows of all orange: `(O, O, ..., O)`\n        2.  Rows of all white (part of the white stripe not containing the circle): `(W, W, ..., W)`\n        3.  Rows of all green: `(G, G, ..., G)`\n        4.  Rows from the white stripe that intersect the orange circle: `(W, ..., W, O, ..., O, W, ..., W)`\n    *   **Rank Calculation:** The first three row types are all simple vectors where all elements are the same. `(O,..,O)`, `(W,..,W)`, and `(G,..,G)` are all scalar multiples of `(1, 1, ..., 1)`. Therefore, they only span a 1-dimensional space. The fourth row type, `(W,..,W,O,..,O,W,..,W)`, is not a scalar multiple of `(1, 1, ..., 1)`. Thus, the entire row space is spanned by the set `{(1, 1, ..., 1), (W,..,W,O,..,O,W,..,W)}`. These two vectors are linearly independent. The rank is 2.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe flag of Denmark has a maximal rank of 2. After analyzing the flags of all African nations, we find three flags that share this same property due to their specific geometric constructions which result in a 2-dimensional row space.\n\nThe flags are:\n1.  **Benin**\n2.  **Madagascar**\n3.  **Niger**\n\n<<<Benin, Madagascar, and Niger>>>"
