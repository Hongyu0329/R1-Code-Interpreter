    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the upper bound.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and Interpreting the Notation\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound for a quantity called \"maximum norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$\" in relation to the \"covolume $(V)$\" for a specific class of mathematical objects defined by \"squarefree natural numbers $(N)$\".\n\n1.  **Squarefree Natural Numbers (N):** In number theory, this typically refers to the construction of quadratic number fields $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$, where $N$ is a squarefree integer. Although \"natural number\" often implies positivity, in this context, it's common to include negative integers to cover both real and imaginary quadratic fields. The field extension $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})/\\mathbb{Q}$ has degree $n=2$. The ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of this field can be embedded into $\\mathbb{R}^2$ as a lattice.\n\n2.  **Covolume (V):** For a lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, the covolume $V$ is the volume of its fundamental domain. For the lattice $L = \\sigma(\\mathcal{O}_K)$ obtained from a number field $K$, the covolume is related to the field discriminant $\\Delta_K$ by $V = 2^{-r_2}\\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|}$, where $n=r_1+2r_2$ is the degree, $r_1$ is the number of real embeddings, and $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex embeddings. For quadratic fields ($n=2$), we have $(r_1, r_2) = (2,0)$ for real fields ($N>0$) or $(0,1)$ for imaginary fields ($N<0$).\n\n3.  **Maximum Norm $(k_{k,\\infty})$:** This notation is non-standard.\n    *   The term \"maximum norm\" is a synonym for the infinity norm, or $L_\\infty$-norm, defined for a vector $x = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ as $\\|x\\|_\\infty = \\max_{i} |x_i|$. The subscript $\\infty$ confirms this.\n    *   The notation $k_{k,\\infty}$ most plausibly refers to one of the successive minima of the lattice with respect to the infinity norm, denoted $\\lambda_k^{(\\infty)}$. The successive minima are fundamental characteristics of a lattice. The question asks for an upper bound, which exists for the first successive minimum $\\lambda_1$, but not for the higher-order minima in terms of covolume alone.\n    *   Therefore, we interpret $(k_{k,\\infty})$ as the first successive minimum with respect to the infinity norm, $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L)$. This is the length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice $L$, as measured by the infinity norm:\n        $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L) = \\min \\{ \\|x\\|_\\infty \\mid x \\in L, x \\neq 0 \\}$.\n\n4.  **The Goal:** The question is to find the sharpest upper bound for $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L)$ as a function of the covolume $V(L)$, where $L$ is a lattice arising from a quadratic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$. This means we are looking for the smallest function $f(V)$ such that the inequality $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L) \\le f(V)$ holds for all such lattices.\n\n### Step 2: Applying Minkowski's Theorem\n\nThe main tool for relating the length of the shortest vector to the covolume is Minkowski's Convex Body Theorem.\n\n1.  **Minkowski's First Theorem:** For a lattice $L$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ with covolume $V$, any centrally symmetric convex set $C$ with volume $\\text{vol}(C) \\ge 2^n V$ must contain at least one non-zero lattice point.\n\n2.  **Application to the Infinity Norm:** We use the infinity norm, so the \"ball\" of radius $r$ is a hypercube $C_r = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid \\|x\\|_\\infty \\le r\\}$. This cube has side length $2r$ and its volume is $\\text{vol}(C_r) = (2r)^n$.\n\n3.  **Deriving the Bound:** We are in dimension $n=2$. So, $\\text{vol}(C_r) = (2r)^2 = 4r^2$. Minkowski's theorem guarantees a non-zero lattice point in $C_r$ if $4r^2 \\ge 2^2 V$, which simplifies to $r^2 \\ge V$, or $r \\ge \\sqrt{V}$.\n    This means there must exist a non-zero vector $x \\in L$ with $\\|x\\|_\\infty \\le \\sqrt{V}$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on the Bound:** Since $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L)$ is the minimum norm of all non-zero lattice vectors, it must be less than or equal to this value. Thus, we have the general upper bound:\n    $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L) \\le V^{1/2}$\n\n### Step 3: Checking the Sharpness of the Bound\n\nThe next step is to determine if this bound is \"tight\" (sharp), meaning it cannot be improved. We do this by checking if there is any lattice in our considered class for which the equality $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} = V^{1/2}$ holds.\n\n1.  **The Worst-Case Lattice:** The equality $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} = V^{1/2}$ is achieved for a square lattice. For instance, the lattice generated by the vectors $(\\sqrt{V}, 0)$ and $(0, \\sqrt{V})$ has a covolume of $V$ and its shortest non-zero vectors have an infinity norm of exactly $\\sqrt{V}$.\n\n2.  **Checking the Constraint:** We need to see if a square lattice can arise from the ring of integers of a field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ with $N$ being a squarefree integer.\n    *   Consider the imaginary quadratic field $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$, where $N=-1$ is a squarefree integer.\n    *   The ring of integers is the Gaussian integers, $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$.\n    *   The Minkowski embedding maps an element $a+bi \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$ to the vector $(a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. This forms the standard integer lattice $L = \\mathbb{Z}^2$.\n    *   For this lattice $L = \\mathbb{Z}^2$:\n        *   The covolume is $V = 1$.\n        *   The shortest non-zero vectors are $(\\pm 1, 0)$ and $(0, \\pm 1)$. Their infinity norm is $\\max(|\\pm 1|, |0|) = 1$. So, $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L) = 1$.\n    *   Let's check our bound for this case: $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} \\le V^{1/2}$ becomes $1 \\le 1^{1/2}$, which is $1 \\le 1$.\n    *   The equality is achieved for the lattice corresponding to $N=-1$.\n\n3.  **Final Conclusion on the Bound:** Since the general upper bound is achieved by a lattice within the specified class (lattices from $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$), the bound cannot be improved.\n\n### Final Answer Formulation\n\nThe analysis establishes that for any 2D lattice $L$ arising from the ring of integers of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{N})$ (with $N$ squarefree), the first successive minimum with respect to the infinity norm, $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)}(L)$, is bounded above by the square root of the covolume, $V$.\n\nThe relationship is: $\\lambda_1^{(\\infty)} \\le V^{1/2}$.\n\nThe question asks for the upper bound for the norm in relation to the covolume. This is the expression on the right side of the inequality.\n\n<<<V^(1/2)>>>"
