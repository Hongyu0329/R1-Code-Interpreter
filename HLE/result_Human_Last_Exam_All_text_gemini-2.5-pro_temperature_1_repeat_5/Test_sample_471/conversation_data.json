    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of critical points for a smooth function $f : T^2\\to\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Basics and Existence of Critical Points**\n\n*   **Domain:** The domain is the 2-torus, $T^2$. Topologically, it's the product of two circles ($S^1 \\times S^1$) and can be visualized as the surface of a donut. The key property of the torus for this problem is that it is a **compact manifold without boundary**.\n*   **Function:** We are given a **smooth** (infinitely differentiable) function $f$ from the torus to the real numbers.\n*   **Critical Point:** A point $p \\in T^2$ is a critical point of $f$ if the derivative of $f$ at $p$ is zero. In local coordinates, this means all partial derivatives vanish at $p$.\n*   **Extreme Value Theorem:** Since $T^2$ is compact and $f$ is continuous (as it is smooth), $f$ must attain a global maximum and a global minimum on $T^2$.\n*   **A First Lower Bound:** Let $p_{max}$ be a point where $f$ attains its maximum and $p_{min}$ be where it attains its minimum. At these points, the derivative of $f$ must be zero. Thus, $p_{max}$ and $p_{min}$ are critical points. If the function is not constant, $p_{max} \\neq p_{min}$. Therefore, any non-constant smooth function on the torus must have **at least 2** critical points.\n\n**Step 2: Introducing Morse Theory**\n\nTo find the *minimal* number of critical points, we turn to Morse theory, which connects the critical points of a function to the topology of the manifold. While the theory is most straightforward for a special class of functions called **Morse functions** (those with only non-degenerate critical points), its results provide lower bounds that apply to all smooth functions.\n\n**Step 3: Topology of the Torus ($T^2$)**\n\nThe topology of a manifold is characterized by its homology groups, and their ranks are the **Betti numbers** ($b_k$).\nFor the 2-torus, the Betti numbers are:\n*   $b_0(T^2) = 1$ (it has one connected component).\n*   $b_1(T^2) = 2$ (it has two independent non-contractible loops, like the longitude and latitude on a donut).\n*   $b_2(T^2) = 1$ (it encloses one 2-dimensional \"void\").\n\nThe **Euler characteristic**, $\\chi(M)$, is the alternating sum of the Betti numbers:\n$\\chi(T^2) = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Applying the Morse Inequalities**\n\nLet $c_k(f)$ be the number of critical points of index $k$ for a Morse function $f$. (Index 0 for a local minimum, 1 for a saddle point, 2 for a local maximum).\n\nThe **Weak Morse Inequalities** state that for any Morse function $f$ on a manifold $M$, $c_k(f) \\ge b_k(M)$ for all $k$. Applying this to the torus:\n*   $c_0(f) \\ge b_0(T^2) = 1$. There must be at least one minimum.\n*   $c_1(f) \\ge b_1(T^2) = 2$. There must be at least two saddle points.\n*   $c_2(f) \\ge b_2(T^2) = 1$. There must be at least one maximum.\n\nSumming these lower bounds, the total number of critical points for any *Morse function* on the torus is:\nTotal Critical Points $= c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \\ge 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.\n\n**Step 5: Generalizing to all Smooth Functions**\n\nThis lower bound of 4 is not just for Morse functions; it holds for any smooth function on the torus. This can be understood through a more general topological argument:\n\n1.  **Handlebody Decomposition:** The topology of the sublevel sets of the function must change as we pass critical values. To build the topology of a torus, you must perform a sequence of operations corresponding to passing critical points of different indices. To get the correct Betti numbers for a torus, you need at least one 0-handle (minimum), two 1-handles (saddles), and one 2-handle (maximum). This corresponds to a total of 4 critical points.\n2.  **Lusternik-Schnirelmann Theory:** This theory provides another lower bound. It states that the number of critical points is at least the **cup-length** of the manifold's cohomology ring plus one. For the torus, the cup-length is 2, giving a lower bound of 3. However, the Morse inequalities are more powerful and give a stronger bound in this case.\n3.  **CW-Complex:** A fundamental result states that the number of critical points of any smooth function on a manifold $M$ must be at least the number of cells in a minimal CW-decomposition of $M$. For the torus, a minimal CW-complex consists of 1 vertex (0-cell), 2 edges (1-cells), and 1 face (2-cell), for a total of 4 cells. This confirms the lower bound of 4 for any smooth function.\n\n**Step 6: Constructing an Example to Show the Bound is Achievable**\n\nWe have established a lower bound of 4. To show this is the *minimal* number, we must construct a smooth function on the torus that has exactly 4 critical points.\n\n*   Consider a torus standing upright in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. The standard height function $f(p) = z$ is a smooth function. However, its critical points occur at the top and bottom circles, which are circles of degenerate critical points, so this function is not a Morse function and has infinitely many critical points.\n*   Now, slightly **tilt** the torus with respect to the z-axis. The height function $f(p)=z$ on this tilted torus is now a Morse function. Let's count its critical points:\n    1.  There is now a single, lowest point: **1 minimum** (index 0).\n    2.  There is now a single, highest point: **1 maximum** (index 2).\n    3.  The two circles of critical points from the upright case resolve into two distinct **saddle points** (index 1). One is on the \"inner\" side and one on the \"outer\" side of the torus.\n*   This function has exactly $1+2+1=4$ critical points. Since we found a function with 4 critical points and we proved that any function must have at least 4, this is the minimum possible number.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimal number of critical points is determined by the topology of the torus, specifically its Betti numbers. The Morse inequalities require at least one minimum, two saddles, and one maximum, for a total of at least 4 critical points. This bound is shown to be achievable by considering the height function on a slightly tilted torus.\n\n<<<4>>>"
