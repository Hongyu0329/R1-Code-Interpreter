The conditions for an FGH-tripled fixed point depend on the mathematical context. In complete metric spaces, the core condition is that the functions F, G, and H must satisfy a joint contractive property that makes the combined operator T(x,y,z) = (F(x,y,z), G(y,x,y), H(z,y,x)) a contraction on the product space X×Y×Z; this guarantees a unique fixed point. In partially ordered metric spaces, the conditions are: (1) F, G, and H must have specific mixed-monotone properties, (2) there must exist an initial point (x₀,y₀,z₀) that satisfies a set of inequalities like x₀ ≤ F(x₀,y₀,z₀), and (3) F, G, and H must be continuous; this guarantees the existence of at least one fixed point.
