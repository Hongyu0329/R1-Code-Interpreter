    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimal number of generators of the fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the manifold and its fundamental group**\n\nThe manifold in question is $M = \\Sigma(S^4, \\tau_5(3_1))$, which denotes the double branched cover of the 4-sphere $S^4$ with the branch locus being the 5-twist-spun knot of the trefoil, $\\tau_5(3_1)$.\n\nThe fundamental group of such a manifold, $\\pi_1(M)$, is given by a standard construction. Let $K$ be a knot in $S^3$, and let $G = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus K)$ be its knot group. Let $m \\in G$ be an element representing a meridian of the knot. The fundamental group of the double branched cover of $S^4$ over the $n$-twist-spun knot $\\tau_n(K)$ is given by the presentation:\n$$ \\pi_1(\\Sigma(S^4, \\tau_n(K))) = \\langle G, T \\mid T g T^{-1} = m^{2n} g m^{-2n} \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\rangle $$\nThis is an HNN extension of the knot group $G$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the formula to the specific case**\n\nIn this problem, we have:\n*   The knot $K$ is the trefoil knot ($3_1$).\n*   The number of twists is $n=5$.\n\nThe group of the trefoil knot is $G = \\pi_1(S^3 \\setminus 3_1)$. A common presentation for this group is:\n$$ G = \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle $$\nIn this presentation, both $x$ and $y$ are meridians (i.e., they are conjugate to a standard meridian loop). Let's choose the meridian $m=x$.\n\nThe exponent for the twisting relation is $2n = 2 \\times 5 = 10$. So the relation involves conjugation by $m^{10} = x^{10}$.\n\nA crucial property of the trefoil group $G$ is that it has a non-trivial center. The center $Z(G)$ is the infinite cyclic group generated by the element $z = x^2 = y^3$. Any element of the center commutes with all elements of $G$.\n\nLet's analyze the term $x^{10}$:\n$$ x^{10} = (x^2)^5 = z^5 $$\nSince $z$ is central, $z^5$ is also central. This means $z^5$ commutes with any element $g \\in G$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the relations for our fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$:\n$$ T g T^{-1} = x^{10} g x^{-10} $$\nSince $x^{10} = z^5$ is central, it commutes with $g$. So, $x^{10} g = g x^{10}$.\n$$ T g T^{-1} = g x^{10} x^{-10} = g e = g $$\nwhere $e$ is the identity element.\n\nThe relation simplifies to $T g T^{-1} = g$, or $Tg = gT$. This means the generator $T$ commutes with all elements of $G$.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is the direct product of the trefoil group $G$ and the infinite cyclic group $\\mathbb{Z}$ generated by $T$:\n$$ \\pi_1(M) \\cong G \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\cong \\langle x, y \\mid x^2 = y^3 \\rangle \\times \\langle T \\rangle $$\n\n**Step 3: Determine the minimal number of generators for the group**\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of generators for the group $\\Pi = G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. This number is denoted by $d(\\Pi)$.\n\n*   **Lower Bound:** The group $\\Pi$ is non-abelian because its factor $G$ (the trefoil group) is non-abelian. A non-abelian group cannot be generated by a single element. Therefore, $d(\\Pi) \\ge 2$.\n\n*   **Upper Bound:** We will show that $\\Pi$ can be generated by two elements. Let's try to construct a set of two generators.\n    Consider the following two elements in $\\Pi = G \\times \\langle T \\rangle$:\n    $$ U = (x, T^{-1}) $$\n    $$ V = (y, T^{-1}) $$\n    Let $H = \\langle U, V \\rangle$ be the subgroup generated by $U$ and $V$. We want to show that $H = \\Pi$.\n\n    Let's compute the element $U^2 V^{-3}$. Since the second component ($T$) is central in the whole group $\\Pi$, the calculation is straightforward:\n    $$ U^2 V^{-3} = (x, T^{-1})^2 (y, T^{-1})^{-3} = (x^2, T^{-2}) (y^{-3}, T^3) = (x^2 y^{-3}, T^{-2+3}) = (x^2 y^{-3}, T) $$\n    In the trefoil group $G$, we have the relation $x^2 = y^3$, which means $x^2 y^{-3}$ is the identity element $e_G$. So:\n    $$ U^2 V^{-3} = (e_G, T) $$\n    This shows that the element $(e_G, T)$ can be generated by $U$ and $V$. This element generates the entire subgroup $\\{e_G\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$. So, $\\{e_G\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\subseteq H$.\n\n    Now that we have $(e_G, T)$ in our generated subgroup $H$, we can generate other elements:\n    *   Consider $U \\cdot (e_G, T) = (x, T^{-1}) \\cdot (e_G, T) = (x \\cdot e_G, T^{-1} T) = (x, e_T)$.\n    *   Consider $V \\cdot (e_G, T) = (y, T^{-1}) \\cdot (e_G, T) = (y \\cdot e_G, T^{-1} T) = (y, e_T)$.\n\n    So, the elements $(x, e_T)$ and $(y, e_T)$ are in $H$. These two elements generate the entire subgroup $G \\times \\{e_T\\}$, since $x$ and $y$ are generators for $G$.\n\n    Since both $G \\times \\{e_T\\}$ and $\\{e_G\\} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ are subgroups of $H$, their internal direct product, which is the entire group $G \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, must be contained in $H$.\n    Thus, $H = G \\times \\mathbb{Z} = \\Pi$.\n\nWe have shown that the group $\\Pi$ can be generated by two elements.\nSince $d(\\Pi) \\ge 2$ and we have found a generating set of size 2, the minimal number of generators is exactly 2."
