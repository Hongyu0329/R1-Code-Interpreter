    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question and answer choices:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core Concept**\nThe question is about the evolutionary fate of genes after a duplication event. When a gene is duplicated, the genome has two identical copies. Initially, one copy is redundant. There are several possible outcomes for these two copies over evolutionary time. The question asks for the mechanism that best explains how both copies are kept (retained) and how they become different from each other (diverge).\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Initial State of Duplicate Genes**\nImmediately after duplication, there are two copies of a gene. Natural selection acts to preserve the original function. This means that as long as one copy is functional, there is reduced selective pressure on the second copy. This second copy can accumulate mutations without harming the organism. The most likely fate for this redundant copy is to accumulate a disabling mutation (a frameshift or nonsense mutation) and become a non-functional \"pseudogene,\" which is then eventually lost from the genome. The question asks for a mechanism that avoids this common fate and instead leads to the *retention* of both copies.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluate Each Answer Choice as a Mechanism for Retention and Divergence**\n\n*   **A. Gene conversion:** This is a process where one gene copy is \"overwritten\" by the sequence of the other copy, making them identical again. This process actively works *against* divergence. Therefore, it cannot be the primary mechanism responsible for both retention and divergence.\n\n*   **B. Pseudogenization:** This is the process where one of the duplicate genes accumulates mutations that render it non-functional. While the sequence of the pseudogene will diverge from the functional copy, this mechanism describes the *loss* of a functional gene, not the *retention* of two functional duplicates. It is the most common outcome, but it doesn't explain how both copies are kept.\n\n*   **C. Neofunctionalization:** In this model, one gene copy maintains the original ancestral function, while the second copy is free to accumulate mutations. By chance, one of these mutations may result in a completely new, beneficial function. At this point, selection will act to preserve both copies: one for the old function and one for the new one. This explains both retention and divergence.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This requires a rare eventâ€”the evolution of a brand new, useful function. While it certainly happens, it might not be the most frequent way duplicates are initially preserved.\n\n*   **D. Subfunctionalization:** This model (also called the Duplication-Degeneration-Complementation or DDC model) starts with the idea that the original ancestral gene had multiple distinct functions or was expressed in multiple tissues/times (a property called pleiotropy). After duplication, each copy can accumulate mutations that disable *different* subfunctions. For example, one copy might lose function A but keep function B, while the other copy loses function B but keeps function A. Now, both gene copies are required to perform the complete set of original ancestral functions.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This mechanism explains retention because both copies become essential. It explains divergence because they specialize for different subfunctions. Crucially, it relies on loss-of-function mutations, which are much more common than the gain-of-function mutations required for neofunctionalization. This makes it a highly plausible and likely mechanism for the initial preservation of duplicate genes.\n\n*   **E. Adaptive radiation:** This is a large-scale evolutionary pattern where a single lineage diversifies into many different species that occupy distinct ecological niches. While gene duplication can provide the genetic raw material that facilitates adaptive radiation, it is a macroevolutionary concept, not a specific molecular mechanism for the retention and divergence of a single pair of duplicate genes.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Viable Options and Conclude**\nThe two main competing models for the retention and divergence of duplicate genes are neofunctionalization (C) and subfunctionalization (D).\n\n*   **Neofunctionalization** requires a rare gain-of-function mutation.\n*   **Subfunctionalization** requires common loss-of-function mutations.\n\nBecause loss-of-function mutations are far more frequent than gain-of-function mutations, the subfunctionalization model provides a more common and thus \"more likely\" pathway for duplicate genes to escape the default fate of pseudogenization. It offers a passive way to preserve both copies, as each becomes essential by losing a complementary part of the original function. Therefore, it is considered the most likely mechanism for the initial retention of many duplicate genes.\n\n<<<D>>>"
