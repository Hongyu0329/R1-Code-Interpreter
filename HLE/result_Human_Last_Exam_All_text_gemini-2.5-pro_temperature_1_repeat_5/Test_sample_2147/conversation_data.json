    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the identity of \"X-Y\".\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Person:** Pavel Milyukov (1859-1943). He was a prominent Russian historian, liberal politician, and a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets).\n*   **Accusation:** He \"frequently accused the Western culture of his time\". This points to a specific aspect of Western culture he disliked, as Milyukov was generally a \"Westernizer\" in his political views, advocating for a constitutional democracy in Russia modeled on Western examples. This suggests his criticism was not about politics or economics, but likely about culture or art.\n*   **Specific Denouncement:** He called \"X-Ys\" a \"stagnant swamp\". This is a very strong and specific insult, suggesting a deep disdain for a particular group or movement.\n*   **Format:** \"X-Y\" suggests a two-part name, possibly a compound word or a hyphenated term.\n\n**Step 2: Investigate Pavel Milyukov's cultural views.**\n*   While Milyukov admired Western political institutions, he was a cultural conservative. He championed the 19th-century Russian realist tradition in art and literature (e.g., Tolstoy, Repin).\n*   He was deeply critical of the modernist and avant-garde art movements that emerged in the early 20th century, which he saw as decadent, chaotic, and a sign of cultural decay. These movements were heavily influenced by contemporary trends in Western Europe, particularly France and Italy.\n\n**Step 3: Search for the specific quote \"stagnant swamp\".**\n*   Historical sources confirm that Milyukov used this phrase to attack the new, radical art movements in Russia.\n*   His criticism was most famously directed at the Russian avant-garde during public debates and in his writings around 1912-1913. He saw their work not as innovation but as the \"destruction of the temple\" of culture.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the specific movement that fits \"X-Y\" and was Milyukov's target.**\n*   The most prominent avant-garde art movement in Russia at that time was a unique fusion of two major European styles: French Cubism and Italian Futurism.\n*   This Russian movement was known as **Cubo-Futurism**. Its proponents, such as David Burliuk and Kazimir Malevich, deliberately broke with all past artistic traditions.\n*   Milyukov engaged in public disputes with these artists, denouncing their work as meaningless and destructive. The term \"Cubo-Futurists\" perfectly fits the \"X-Y\" format and aligns with the target of his famous \"stagnant swamp\" insult.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nPavel Milyukov, despite his Western-oriented political liberalism, was a cultural traditionalist. He vehemently opposed the modernist art movements of his time. The \"X-Ys\" he denounced as a \"stagnant swamp\" were the artists belonging to the Russian avant-garde movement known as Cubo-Futurism, which he saw as a decadent import from the West that threatened to destroy true Russian culture.\n\n<<<Cubo-Futurists>>>"
