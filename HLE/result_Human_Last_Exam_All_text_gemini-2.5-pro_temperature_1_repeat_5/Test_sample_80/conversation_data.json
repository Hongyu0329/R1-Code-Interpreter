    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Total Number of Edge Squares**\nAn 8x8 chessboard has four edges. Each edge has 8 squares. To find the total number of unique edge squares, we can sum the squares on all four sides and subtract the four corner squares that are counted twice.\n*   (8 squares per side * 4 sides) - 4 corner squares = 32 - 4 = 28 edge squares.\n*   Alternatively: 8 squares on the top row + 8 squares on the bottom row + 6 squares on the left side (excluding corners) + 6 squares on the right side (excluding corners) = 8 + 8 + 6 + 6 = 28 edge squares.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Key Constraint of the Bishop**\nThe fundamental rule for placing bishops is that no bishop can attack another. A bishop attacks any number of squares along a diagonal. A crucial property of bishops is that they always remain on squares of the same color they start on.\n*   A bishop on a light square can only attack other light squares.\n*   A bishop on a dark square can only attack other dark squares.\nThis means we can solve the problem for light squares and dark squares independently and then combine the results.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Edge Squares by Color**\nThe 28 edge squares are divided equally between the two colors.\n*   There are 14 light-colored edge squares.\n*   There are 14 dark-colored edge squares.\n\n**Step 4: Maximize the Number of Bishops on Light-Colored Edge Squares**\nThe 14 light-colored edge squares form a \"ring\" around the board. Let's analyze how they attack each other. Each light square on the edge is diagonally connected to exactly two other light squares on the edge (except for the corner squares which connect to one). These connections form pairs of mutually attacking squares.\n*   For example, the light square `a8` attacks the light square `h1`.\n*   The light square `c8` attacks the light square `a6`.\n*   The light square `e8` attacks the light square `a4`.\n*   ...and so on.\nThere are exactly 7 such pairs of mutually attacking light squares on the edge. To place the maximum number of bishops, we can only place one bishop in each of these 7 pairs. Therefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the 14 light-colored edge squares is **7**.\n\n**Step 5: Maximize the Number of Bishops on Dark-Colored Edge Squares**\nThe logic for the dark squares is identical to the light squares. The 14 dark-colored edge squares also form 7 pairs of mutually attacking squares.\n*   For example, the dark square `a1` attacks the dark square `h8`.\n*   The dark square `c1` attacks the dark square `a3`.\n*   ...and so on.\nTherefore, the maximum number of bishops we can place on the 14 dark-colored edge squares is also **7**.\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Placed Bishops**\nTo find the total number of bishops that can be placed on the edge, we sum the maximums for both colors.\n*   Total Bishops = (Max bishops on light squares) + (Max bishops on dark squares)\n*   Total Bishops = 7 + 7 = 14.\nSo, they succeeded in placing 14 bishops on the edge squares.\n\n**Step 7: Calculate the Number of Empty Edge Squares**\nThe question asks for the number of edge squares that *lack* bishops. We subtract the number of placed bishops from the total number of edge squares.\n*   Empty Edge Squares = (Total edge squares) - (Total placed bishops)\n*   Empty Edge Squares = 28 - 14 = 14.\n\nIf they succeeded in placing the maximum possible number of bishops on the edge squares, 14 squares would have bishops, and 14 squares would be empty.\n\n<<<14>>>"
