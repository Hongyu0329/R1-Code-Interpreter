    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Understand the System:** The given equations form a Kolmogorov-Chapman system, which describes the probabilities of a system being in one of several states over time. This is a model for a continuous-time Markov chain. The variables $P_i(t)$ are the probabilities of being in state $i$ at time $t$. The constants $\\lambda_{ij}$ represent the transition rates from state $i$ to state $j$.\n\n2.  **Identify the Goal:** The objective is to find the value of $P_{0}(+\\infty) + P_{1}(+\\infty)$. This refers to the sum of the probabilities of being in state 0 and state 1 at steady state, i.e., as time $t$ approaches infinity.\n\n3.  **Steady-State Condition:** In the steady state (as $t \\to +\\infty$), the probabilities $P_i(t)$ no longer change with time. They approach constant values, which we denote as $p_i = P_i(+\\infty)$. Consequently, their time derivatives become zero: $P_i'(t) \\to 0$.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Steady-State Equations:** By setting all the derivatives $P_i'(t)$ to zero in the original system of differential equations, we obtain a system of linear algebraic equations for the steady-state probabilities $p_i$.\n    *   From $P_{0}'(t)=0$:  $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    *   From $P_{1}'(t)=0$:  $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    *   From $P_{2}'(t)=0$:  $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21}  + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    *   From $P_{3}'(t)=0$:  $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    *   The normalization condition remains: $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n5.  **Linear Dependence:** The first four algebraic equations are linearly dependent. Summing them up yields 0 = 0. This means one equation is redundant. To find a unique solution for the probabilities $p_i$, we must use the normalization condition.\n\n6.  **Substitute Numerical Values:** We substitute the given values of $\\lambda_{ij}$ into the steady-state equations:\n    *   $\\lambda_{01} = 0.019$\n    *   $\\lambda_{10} = 0.65$\n    *   $\\lambda_{12} = 0.4$\n    *   $\\lambda_{21} = 0.392$\n    *   $\\lambda_{23} = 0.008$\n    *   $\\lambda_{31} = 0.008$\n\n7.  **Solve the System Algebraically:** The strategy is to use the simpler equations to express three of the probabilities in terms of a single one (e.g., $p_1$), and then use the normalization condition to solve for that single probability.\n\n8.  **Precision:** To avoid rounding errors, it is advisable to work with fractions or exact decimals as long as possible.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\n**Step 1: Set up the algebraic system with numerical values.**\nThe steady-state equations are:\n1.  $0 = -0.019 p_0 + 0.65 p_1$\n2.  $0 = 0.019 p_0 - (0.65 + 0.4) p_1 + 0.392 p_2 + 0.008 p_3$\n3.  $0 = 0.4 p_1 - (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n4.  $0 = 0.008 p_2 - 0.008 p_3$\n5.  $p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$\n\n**Step 2: Simplify the equations and find relationships between the probabilities.**\nFrom equation (4):\n$0.008 p_2 = 0.008 p_3 \\implies p_2 = p_3$\n\nFrom equation (3):\n$0.4 p_1 = (0.392 + 0.008) p_2$\n$0.4 p_1 = 0.4 p_2 \\implies p_1 = p_2$\nCombining these results, we have: $p_1 = p_2 = p_3$.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n$0.019 p_0 = 0.65 p_1 \\implies p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n\n**Step 3: Express all probabilities in terms of $p_1$.**\nWe have:\n*   $p_0 = \\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1$\n*   $p_2 = p_1$\n*   $p_3 = p_1$\n\n**Step 4: Use the normalization condition to solve for $p_1$.**\nSubstitute the expressions from Step 3 into the normalization equation ($p_0 + p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 1$):\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} p_1) + p_1 + p_1 + p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{0.65}{0.019} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n\nTo maintain precision, let's work with fractions:\n$\\frac{0.65}{0.019} = \\frac{650}{19}$\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + 3) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650}{19} + \\frac{57}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$(\\frac{650 + 57}{19}) p_1 = 1$\n$\\frac{707}{19} p_1 = 1$\n$p_1 = \\frac{19}{707}$\n\n**Step 5: Calculate $p_0$.**\nUsing the relationship from Step 3:\n$p_0 = \\frac{650}{19} p_1 = \\frac{650}{19} \\times \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650}{707}$\n\n**Step 6: Calculate the required sum $p_0 + p_1$.**\nThe question asks for $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n$p_0 + p_1 = \\frac{650}{707} + \\frac{19}{707} = \\frac{650 + 19}{707} = \\frac{669}{707}$\n\n**Step 7: Convert the final answer to a decimal.**\n$\\frac{669}{707} \\approx 0.946251768...$\n\nThe final answer is the sum of the steady-state probabilities for states 0 and 1.\n\n<<<0.94625177>>>"
