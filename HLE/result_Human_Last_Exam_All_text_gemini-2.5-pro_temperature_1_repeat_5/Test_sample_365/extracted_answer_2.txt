The product is a tetracyclic ketone formed via an anionic oxy-Cope rearrangement. The key transformations are the conversion of the tertiary alcohol at C2 into a ketone, the cleavage of the C1-C2 bond of the norbornene ring, the formation of a new C-C bond between C5 of the norbornene part and C2' of the cyclopentenyl part, and the shift of the norbornene double bond from C5=C6 to C1=C6. The dimethoxy ketal and the silyl ether groups remain intact.
