    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the smallest number of composants an indecomposable continuum can have.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\n*   **Continuum:** The question specifies a \"not necessarily metric\" continuum. In topology, this refers to a **compact, connected Hausdorff space**. If it were metric, it would be a compact, connected metric space.\n*   **Indecomposable Continuum:** A continuum $X$ is indecomposable if it cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua. A subcontinuum is a subset of $X$ that is also a continuum (i.e., it is compact and connected). A proper subcontinuum is a subcontinuum that is not equal to $X$ itself.\n*   **Composant:** For a point $p$ in a continuum $X$, two points $p$ and $q$ are said to belong to the same composant if there exists a finite sequence of points $p = x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n = q$ such that for each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the pair of points $\\{x_{i-1}, x_i\\}$ is contained in some proper subcontinuum of $X$. The composants are the equivalence classes of this relation. They form a partition of the continuum $X$.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Number of Composants\n\nThe question asks for the *smallest* possible number of composants for an indecomposable continuum. Let's consider the possible numbers.\n\n**Can the number of composants be 1?**\n\nIf a continuum $X$ has only one composant, then the composant must be the entire space $X$. This means that for any two points $p, q \\in X$, they belong to the same composant. It is a fundamental theorem in continuum theory that any continuum with only one composant is **decomposable**. A simple example is a circle, which has one composant and is decomposable.\nSince the question asks for an *indecomposable* continuum, it cannot have only one composant. Therefore, the number of composants must be strictly greater than 1.\n\n**Can the number of composants be finite (â‰¥ 2) or countably infinite? The Metric Case.**\n\nLet's first consider the case of **metric** indecomposable continua, as the theory is more commonly taught for these spaces.\n1.  A metric continuum is a complete metric space. By the Baire Category Theorem, a complete metric space is a Baire space, which means it cannot be written as a countable union of nowhere dense sets (i.e., it is not a \"meager\" or \"first category\" set).\n2.  A key theorem by S. Mazurkiewicz states that if a metric continuum has more than one composant, then each of its composants is a meager (first category) set.\n3.  Let's assume an indecomposable metric continuum $X$ has a finite number, $n \\ge 2$, of composants: $X = C_1 \\cup C_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup C_n$. Since $n \\ge 2$, each composant $C_i$ is a meager set. A finite union of meager sets is also a meager set. This would imply that $X$ is meager, which contradicts the Baire Category Theorem.\n4.  Similarly, if we assume $X$ has a countably infinite number of composants, $X = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} C_i$, then $X$ is a countable union of meager sets, which is meager. This again leads to a contradiction.\n5.  Therefore, for any **metric** indecomposable continuum, the number of composants must be **uncountable**. It is, in fact, a deeper result that this number is always $\\mathfrak{c}$ (the cardinality of the continuum, $2^{\\aleph_0}$).\n\n**Can the number be 2? The Non-Metric Case.**\n\nThe argument above relies on properties of metric spaces. The question explicitly allows for non-metric continua. This is the crucial point. The theorems used for the metric case do not all generalize to the non-metric (compact, connected, Hausdorff) setting.\n\n*   The conclusion that an indecomposable continuum must have uncountably many composants might fail for non-metric spaces.\n*   The argument relied on every composant (in a multi-composant continuum) being meager. This property might not hold for non-metric continua.\n\nIn 1980, the topologist J. van Mill published a paper titled \"An indecomposable continuum with two composants\". In this paper, he successfully constructed a compact, connected, Hausdorff space (a non-metric continuum) that is indecomposable and is partitioned into exactly **two** composants.\n\nThis existence of such a space demonstrates that the lower bound on the number of composants is different in the non-metric case.\n\n### Step 3: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  An indecomposable continuum must have more than 1 composant.\n2.  For metric indecomposable continua, the number must be uncountable ($\\mathfrak{c}$).\n3.  However, for non-metric continua, an example with exactly 2 composants exists.\n\nSince the question does not restrict the continuum to be metric, we must consider all types. The smallest integer greater than 1 is 2. As an example with 2 composants has been constructed, this is the minimum possible number.\n\nThe smallest number of composants an indecomposable (not necessarily metric) continuum can have is 2.\n\n<<<2>>>"
