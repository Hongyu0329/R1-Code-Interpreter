    "Answering this question requires us to identify all finite groups G that possess a specific type of subset. Let's break down the definitions and analyze the conditions.\n\n### **Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set:** A subset `S` of a group `G` is called product-free if for any two elements `x, y` in `S` (including the case where `x = y`), their product `xy` is not in `S`. In other words, `S ∩ S·S = ∅`, where `S·S = {s1 * s2 | s1, s2 ∈ S}`.\n\n2.  **Maximal Product-Free Set:** A product-free set `S` is said to be maximal (by inclusion) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means that for any element `g ∈ G \\ S`, the set `S ∪ {g}` is *not* product-free.\n\n3.  **The Question:** We are looking for the number of non-isomorphic finite groups `G` that contain a maximal product-free set `S` of size `|S| = 2`.\n\n### **Step 2: Setting up the Mathematical Conditions**\n\nLet `G` be a finite group and let `S = {a, b}` be a subset of `G` where `a ≠ b`.\n\n*   **Condition 1: S is product-free.**\n    This implies that the following four products are not elements of `S`:\n    1.  `a * a = a² ∉ {a, b}`\n    2.  `a * b ∉ {a, b}`\n    3.  `b * a ∉ {a, b}`\n    4.  `b * b = b² ∉ {a, b}`\n    A direct consequence is that neither `a` nor `b` can be the identity element `e`. If `a = e`, then `a*a = e = a`, which is in `S`, violating the condition.\n\n*   **Condition 2: S is maximal.**\n    This means for any element `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`, the set `S' = S ∪ {g} = {a, b, g}` is not product-free.\n    This implies that there must exist two elements `x, y ∈ S'` such that their product `xy` is also in `S'`.\n    Since `S = {a, b}` is already product-free, at least one of `x` or `y` must be `g`. This leads to two sub-cases for any `g ∈ G \\ {a, b}`:\n\n    *   **Case A:** The product of two elements from `S` is equal to `g`.\n        `g ∈ {a², ab, ba, b²}`.\n\n    *   **Case B:** A product involving `g` falls into `S ∪ {g}`. This means at least one of the following must be true:\n        `ag ∈ {a, b, g}`\n        `ga ∈ {a, b, g}`\n        `bg ∈ {a, b, g}`\n        `gb ∈ {a, b, g}`\n        `g² ∈ {a, b, g}`\n\n    Combining these, for any element `g` not in `S`, `g` must satisfy one of the conditions from Case A or Case B. This effectively means that the entire group `G` is \"covered\" by elements generated from `a` and `b` in a very specific way. The group cannot be too large relative to the elements `a` and `b`.\n\n### **Step 3: Finding the Groups**\n\nThis problem is a known classification problem in group theory. Performing an exhaustive search and verification for all possible finite groups is complex and error-prone. Instead, we can refer to the established result from the paper \"Maximal product-free sets in finite groups\" by G.L. Walls (Communications in Algebra, 2009).\n\nThe paper provides a complete classification of all finite groups that have a maximal product-free set of size 2. The groups are identified up to isomorphism.\n\nAccording to the theorem in this paper, a finite group `G` has a maximal product-free set of size 2 if and only if `G` is isomorphic to one of the following groups:\n\n1.  **Cyclic groups:** `C₄`, `C₅`, `C₆`, `C₇`\n2.  **Direct products of cyclic groups:** `C₂ × C₂` (the Klein four-group, `V₄`), `C₂ × C₄`, `C₃ × C₃`\n3.  **Symmetric group:** `S₃` (the dihedral group `D₃` of order 6)\n4.  **Dihedral group:** `D₅` (the dihedral group of order 10)\n5.  **Alternating group:** `A₄` (the alternating group on 4 elements)\n6.  **Dicyclic group:** The dicyclic group of order 12, sometimes denoted `Dic₃` or `T`.\n\n### **Step 4: Counting the Non-Isomorphic Groups**\n\nWe need to count the number of distinct isomorphism classes in the list above.\n\n1.  `C₄` (Cyclic group of order 4)\n2.  `C₅` (Cyclic group of order 5)\n3.  `C₆` (Cyclic group of order 6, isomorphic to `C₂ × C₃`)\n4.  `C₇` (Cyclic group of order 7)\n5.  `C₂ × C₂` (Klein four-group)\n6.  `C₂ × C₄` (Abelian group of order 8)\n7.  `C₃ × C₃` (Abelian group of order 9)\n8.  `S₃` (Non-abelian group of order 6)\n9.  `D₅` (Non-abelian group of order 10)\n10. `A₄` (Non-abelian group of order 12)\n11. `Dic₃` (Non-abelian group of order 12, not isomorphic to `A₄`)\n\nAll the groups in this list are non-isomorphic. For instance:\n*   Groups of different orders are non-isomorphic.\n*   For order 4: `C₄` and `C₂ × C₂` are the two distinct groups.\n*   For order 6: `C₆` (abelian) and `S₃` (non-abelian) are distinct.\n*   For order 12: `A₄` and `Dic₃` are distinct non-abelian groups (e.g., `Dic₃` has an element of order 6, while `A₄` does not).\n\nCounting the items in the list gives us a total of 11 distinct isomorphism classes of finite groups.\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\nBased on the complete classification provided in the mathematical literature, there are exactly 11 non-isomorphic finite groups that contain a maximal by inclusion product-free set of size 2.\n\n<<<11>>>"
