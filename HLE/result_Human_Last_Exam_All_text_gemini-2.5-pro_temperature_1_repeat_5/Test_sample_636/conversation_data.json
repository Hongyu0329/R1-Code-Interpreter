    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the state feedback gain matrix F.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Define the System and the Goal**\n\nWe are given the state-space representation of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n*   State matrix: `A = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]]`\n*   Input matrix: `B = [[1, 2], [1, 0]]`\n\nWe want to design a state feedback controller `u = -Fx`, where `F` is the state feedback gain matrix. The closed-loop system is described by `ẋ = (A - BF)x`.\nThe goal is to find a matrix `F` such that the eigenvalues of the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF` are located at `-1 + j` and `-1 - j`.\n\n**2. Determine the Desired Characteristic Polynomial**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of a system determines its eigenvalues. If the desired eigenvalues are `λ1 = -1 + j` and `λ2 = -1 - j`, the desired characteristic polynomial `p_d(λ)` is:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - λ1)(λ - λ2)`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ - (-1 + j))(λ - (-1 - j))`\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1 - j)(λ + 1 + j)`\nUsing the difference of squares formula `(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2` where `a = λ + 1` and `b = j`:\n`p_d(λ) = (λ + 1)^2 - j^2`\nSince `j^2 = -1`:\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 1 - (-1)`\n`p_d(λ) = λ^2 + 2λ + 2`\nSo, the characteristic equation for the closed-loop system must be `λ^2 + 2λ + 2 = 0`.\n\n**3. Formulate the Closed-Loop System Matrix `A_cl`**\n\nThe state vector `x` is 2x1 and the input vector `u` is 2x1. Therefore, the feedback gain matrix `F` must be a 2x2 matrix. Let's define `F` as:\n`F = [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n\nFirst, calculate the product `BF`:\n`BF = [[1, 2], [1, 0]] * [[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]`\n`BF = [[1*f1 + 2*f3, 1*f2 + 2*f4], [1*f1 + 0*f3, 1*f2 + 0*f4]]`\n`BF = [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n\nNow, compute the closed-loop matrix `A_cl = A - BF`:\n`A_cl = [[-1, 1], [1, 0]] - [[f1 + 2f3, f2 + 2f4], [f1, f2]]`\n`A_cl = [[-1 - f1 - 2f3, 1 - f2 - 2f4], [1 - f1, -f2]]`\n\n**4. Calculate the Actual Characteristic Polynomial of `A_cl`**\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of `A_cl` is `det(λI - A_cl)`.\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ - (-1 - f1 - 2f3), -(1 - f2 - 2f4)], [-(1 - f1), λ - (-f2)]]`\n`λI - A_cl = [[λ + 1 + f1 + 2f3, -1 + f2 + 2f4], [-1 + f1, λ + f2]]`\n\nNow, calculate the determinant:\n`det(λI - A_cl) = (λ + 1 + f1 + 2f3)(λ + f2) - (-1 + f2 + 2f4)(-1 + f1)`\nExpanding the terms:\n`= λ^2 + λf2 + (1 + f1 + 2f3)λ + f2(1 + f1 + 2f3) - (f1 - 1)(f2 + 2f4 - 1)`\n`= λ^2 + (1 + f1 + f2 + 2f3)λ + (f2 + f1f2 + 2f2f3) - (f1f2 + 2f1f4 - f1 - f2 - 2f4 + 1)`\n`= λ^2 + (1 + f1 + f2 + 2f3)λ + (f1 + 2f2 + 2f2f3 + 2f4 - 2f1f4 - 1)`\n\n**5. Match Coefficients and Solve for F**\n\nWe equate the coefficients of the actual characteristic polynomial with the desired one (`λ^2 + 2λ + 2`).\n\n*   **Coefficient of λ^1:**\n    `1 + f1 + f2 + 2f3 = 2  =>  f1 + f2 + 2f3 = 1`  (Equation 1)\n*   **Coefficient of λ^0 (constant term):**\n    `f1 + 2f2 + 2f2f3 + 2f4 - 2f1f4 - 1 = 2  =>  f1 + 2f2 + 2f2f3 + 2f4(1 - f1) = 3` (Equation 2)\n\nWe have a system of two equations with four unknowns (`f1, f2, f3, f4`). This means the system is underdetermined, and there are infinitely many solutions for `F`. This is expected for a multi-input system. We can find one valid solution by making a simplifying assumption.\n\n**6. Find a Specific Solution**\n\nA common simplification is to assume that one of the control inputs is not used. Let's assume the second control input `u2` is zero, which means the second row of `F` is all zeros.\nLet `f3 = 0` and `f4 = 0`.\n\nNow, substitute these values into our two equations:\n*   **Equation 1:** `f1 + f2 + 2(0) = 1  =>  f1 + f2 = 1`\n*   **Equation 2:** `f1 + 2f2 + 2f2(0) + 2(0)(1 - f1) = 3  =>  f1 + 2f2 = 3`\n\nWe now have a simple system of two linear equations with two unknowns:\n1.  `f1 + f2 = 1`\n2.  `f1 + 2f2 = 3`\n\nSubtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:\n`(f1 + 2f2) - (f1 + f2) = 3 - 1`\n`f2 = 2`\n\nSubstitute `f2 = 2` back into Equation 1:\n`f1 + 2 = 1`\n`f1 = -1`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\nWe have found `f1 = -1`, `f2 = 2`, `f3 = 0`, and `f4 = 0`. Constructing the matrix `F`:\n`F = [[-1, 2], [0, 0]]`\n\nThis is one possible state feedback gain matrix that places the closed-loop eigenvalues at `-1 ± j`.\n\n<<<[[-1, 2], [0, 0]]>>>"
