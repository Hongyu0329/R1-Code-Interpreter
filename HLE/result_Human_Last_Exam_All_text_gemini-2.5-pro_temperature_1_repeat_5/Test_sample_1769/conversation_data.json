    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the current word and its origin.**\nThe Modern English word is \"sister\". The first step is to determine its etymology. \"Sister\" entered the English language in the Middle English period, coming from the Old Norse word *systir*. Old Norse was the language of the Norse invaders (Vikings) who settled in large parts of England, particularly in the North and East (the Danelaw).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the original Anglo-Saxon (Old English) word.**\nBefore the influence of Old Norse became widespread, the native word for a female sibling in Old English was *sweostor*. This word is of Proto-Germanic origin (*swestēr*) and is a cognate with words in other Germanic languages, such as German (*Schwester*), Dutch (*zuster*), and Swedish (*syster*, which itself is a later development from the same Old Norse root).\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the counterfactual scenario.**\nThe question asks what would have happened if the Norse had *not* invaded or interacted with the Anglo-Saxons. In this scenario, the Old Norse word *systir* would never have been introduced into the English language. Therefore, the native Old English word, *sweostor*, would have continued its natural evolution into Middle and then Modern English.\n\n**Step 4: Trace the hypothetical linguistic evolution of *sweostor*.**\nWe must apply the known sound changes that occurred between Old English and Modern English to the word *sweostor*.\n\n*   **From Old English to Middle English:**\n    *   The Old English diphthong `eo` (pronounced roughly /eo/) typically smoothed into a simple `e` vowel (/e/) in Middle English. For example, the Old English *heorte* (heart) became *herte* in Middle English.\n    *   The unstressed vowel in the final syllable (`-or`) would have reduced to a schwa sound, typically spelled `-er`. This is a very common change (e.g., OE *fæder* -> ME *fader*).\n    *   Applying these changes, Old English *sweostor* would have become Middle English *swester*.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1: Historical Evidence.** We don't have to rely purely on hypothetical changes. The form *swester* is actually attested in Middle English texts, particularly in the South and West of England where Norse influence was weaker. It existed alongside the Norse-derived \"sister\", which eventually won out across the entire language. Another attested form was *suster*, which arose from the loss of the /w/ sound, but *swester* is the more direct descendant.\n\n*   **From Middle English to Modern English:**\n    *   The next major event is the Great Vowel Shift (c. 1400-1700), which primarily affected long vowels.\n    *   The `e` in the Middle English form *swester* is a short vowel because it is followed by a consonant cluster (`-st-`). Compare it to words like \"rest\", \"best\", \"west\", or \"Chester\".\n    *   Short vowels were largely unaffected by the Great Vowel Shift. Therefore, the pronunciation of the vowel in *swester* would have remained stable, much like in the word \"west\".\n\n*   **Careful Point 2: Competing Forms.** The alternate Middle English form, *suster*, had a short `u` vowel. In many English dialects, this short `u` (pronounced /ʊ/) unrounded to become the /ʌ/ sound we hear in \"cut\" or \"sun\". So, *suster* might have evolved into a word pronounced \"suster\" (rhyming with \"duster\"). However, *swester* is the more direct and conservative evolution of the original *sweostor*.\n\n**Step 5: Conclude the most likely outcome.**\nBased on the regular patterns of English sound change, the Old English *sweostor* would have evolved into *swester* in Middle English and would likely have retained that form, both in spelling and pronunciation (similar to \"west\"), into Modern English.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nIf the Norse had never influenced the English language, the native Old English word *sweostor* would have followed a natural path of phonetic development. This evolution would have resulted in the word **swester**.\n\n<<<swester>>>"
