No. Polynucleotides and polysaccharides are fundamentally different classes of biopolymers. A polysaccharide's monomer is a monosaccharide and its backbone is composed solely of sugar units linked by glycosidic bonds. A polynucleotide's monomer is a nucleotide (composed of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base), and its backbone is an alternating chain of sugar and phosphate units linked by phosphodiester bonds. These structural differences in the monomer, backbone, and chemical linkage mean a polynucleotide is not a polysaccharide.
