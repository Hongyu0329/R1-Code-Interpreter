    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Graph on n=128 vertices:** We are considering a graph G = (V, E) where the number of vertices |V| is 128.\n*   **Clique:** A clique in a graph is a subset of its vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge. A clique of size k is a set of k such vertices.\n*   **Induced Subgraph:** For a subset of vertices S ⊆ V, the induced subgraph G[S] consists of the vertices S and all edges from the original graph G that have both endpoints in S.\n*   **Clique as an Induced Subgraph:** The phrase \"a clique of size k appears as an induced subgraph\" means that there exists a subset of vertices S with |S| = k such that the induced subgraph G[S] is a complete graph (K_k). This is the standard definition of a clique of size k in a graph.\n\n**2. Formulating the Question Mathematically**\n\nThe question asks for the maximum possible number of different clique sizes that can exist in a single graph G on 128 vertices.\nLet S(G) be the set of integers k for which G contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to K_k (i.e., a clique of size k). We want to find the maximum possible value of |S(G)| over all possible graphs G with 128 vertices.\n\n**3. Connecting Clique Sizes to the Clique Number**\n\nLet's analyze the structure of the set S(G) for any given graph G.\n*   Let ω(G) be the **clique number** of G, which is defined as the size of the largest clique in G.\n*   By the definition of ω(G), there exists a clique in G of size ω(G). Let's call the set of vertices in this largest clique V_max. So, |V_max| = ω(G).\n*   The subgraph induced by V_max is a complete graph, K_{ω(G)}. This means ω(G) is in the set S(G).\n*   Now, consider any integer k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ω(G). We can choose any subset of V_max, let's call it V_k, with |V_k| = k.\n*   Since every vertex in V_max is connected to every other vertex in V_max, it follows that every vertex in the subset V_k is also connected to every other vertex in V_k.\n*   Therefore, the subgraph induced by V_k, which is G[V_k], is a complete graph K_k.\n*   This shows that for any k from 1 to ω(G), the graph G contains a clique of size k as an induced subgraph. In other words, {1, 2, ..., ω(G)} ⊆ S(G).\n*   Furthermore, by the definition of ω(G) as the size of the *largest* clique, there can be no clique of a size greater than ω(G). This means S(G) cannot contain any integer larger than ω(G).\n*   Combining these facts, we conclude that for any graph G, the set of all possible induced clique sizes is exactly S(G) = {1, 2, ..., ω(G)}.\n*   The number of different clique sizes is therefore |S(G)| = ω(G).\n\n**4. Rephrasing the Problem**\n\nBased on the analysis in Step 3, the original question is equivalent to a simpler one:\n\"What is the maximum possible clique number, ω(G), for a graph G on n = 128 vertices?\"\n\n**5. Solving the Rephrased Problem**\n\n*   The clique number ω(G) represents the size of a subset of vertices. For a graph with n vertices, the size of any subset cannot exceed n.\n*   Therefore, for any graph G on 128 vertices, its clique number must satisfy ω(G) ≤ 128.\n*   The final step is to determine if this upper bound of 128 can be achieved by some graph.\n*   Consider the **complete graph** on 128 vertices, denoted K_128. In this graph, every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n*   The entire set of 128 vertices forms a clique.\n*   Thus, the clique number of K_128 is ω(K_128) = 128.\n*   Since we have found a graph that achieves the maximum possible value, the maximum clique number is 128.\n\n**6. Final Conclusion**\n\nThe maximum possible number of different clique sizes is equal to the maximum possible clique number for a graph on 128 vertices, which is 128. This maximum is realized by the complete graph K_128, which contains induced cliques of every size from 1 to 128.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Induced vs. Non-Induced Subgraph:** The word \"induced\" is crucial. The reasoning relies on the properties of induced subgraphs.\n*   **Clique vs. Maximal Clique:** The question is about cliques, not maximal cliques. A maximal clique is a clique that cannot be extended by adding another vertex. The question about maximal clique sizes is a different, more complex combinatorial problem whose answer for n=128 would be 15.\n*   **Existence of a Single Graph:** The problem requires all these clique sizes to appear in a single graph. The K_128 graph satisfies this, as the single large clique of size 128 contains smaller cliques of all possible sizes as subsets. There is no need to construct the cliques from disjoint sets of vertices.\n\n<<<128>>>"
