    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the Hopf charge of the given vector field.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Vector Field and the Hopf Charge\n\nThe given vector field is `n = (nx, ny, nz)`:\n`nx = sin(G)cos(f)`\n`ny = sin(G)sin(f)`\n`nz = cos(G)`\n\nThis is a unit vector field since `nx² + ny² + nz² = 1`. It represents a map from the 3D space `R³` to the surface of a 2D sphere `S²`. The functions `G` and `f` act as the polar and azimuthal angles on `S²`, respectively.\n\nThe functions `G` and `f` are defined as:\n`f = atan2(y, x)`\n`r2 = sqrt((x*x + y*y - 0.5)² + z*z)`\n`G = π * exp(-10 * r2)`\n\nThe Hopf charge (or Hopf invariant) is a topological invariant that characterizes such maps. It quantifies the linking of the preimages of any two distinct points on the target sphere `S²`. For a map to have a well-defined Hopf charge, the field `n` must approach a constant value at infinity. Let's check this condition.\n\nAs `(x,y,z) → ∞`, `r2 → ∞`.\nThen `exp(-10 * r2) → 0`, which means `G → 0`.\nWhen `G → 0`, the vector `n` becomes:\n`nx → sin(0)cos(f) = 0`\n`ny → sin(0)sin(f) = 0`\n`nz → cos(0) = 1`\nSo, `n → (0, 0, 1)` (the \"north pole\" of `S²`) as we go to infinity in any direction in `R³`. This means we can consider our space `R³` compactified to `S³` by adding the point at infinity, and the map `n` is a well-defined map from `S³` to `S²`. Thus, the Hopf charge is well-defined.\n\n### Step 2: Topological Analysis using Preimages\n\nThe Hopf charge can be intuitively understood as the linking number of the preimages of two regular points on the sphere `S²`. Let's find the preimages of the \"south pole\" and a point on the \"equator\".\n\n1.  **Preimage of the South Pole `(0, 0, -1)`:**\n    The south pole corresponds to `nz = -1`, which means `cos(G) = -1`. Since `G` is defined with `exp`, `G` is non-negative. `G`'s maximum value occurs when `r2` is minimum. The range of `G` is `(0, π]`.\n    So, `cos(G) = -1` implies `G = π`.\n    For `G = π`, we need `exp(-10 * r2) = 1`, which means `-10 * r2 = 0`, so `r2 = 0`.\n    From the definition of `r2`:\n    `r2 = sqrt((x² + y² - 0.5)² + z²) = 0`\n    This implies two conditions:\n    a) `z = 0`\n    b) `x² + y² - 0.5 = 0`  => `x² + y² = 0.5`\n    This is the equation of a circle in the `z=0` plane (the xy-plane) with its center at the origin and radius `r = sqrt(0.5) = 1/√2`. Let's call this circle `C₁`.\n\n2.  **Preimage of a point on the Equator, e.g., `(1, 0, 0)`:**\n    This point corresponds to `nz = 0`, `nx = 1`, `ny = 0`.\n    `nz = cos(G) = 0` implies `G = π/2`.\n    For `G = π/2`, we need `exp(-10 * r2) = 1/2`, which means `-10 * r2 = ln(0.5) = -ln(2)`, so `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    `nx = sin(G)cos(f) = sin(π/2)cos(f) = cos(f) = 1`. This implies `f = 2kπ` for integer `k`.\n    `ny = sin(G)sin(f) = sin(π/2)sin(f) = sin(f) = 0`. This is consistent with `f = 2kπ`.\n    From the definition `f = atan2(y, x)`, `f=0` means `y=0` and `x>0`.\n    So, the preimage is a curve in the `y=0` half-plane defined by `r2 = ln(2)/10`.\n    Substituting `y=0` and squaring `r2`, we get:\n    `(x² - 0.5)² + z² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n    This is the equation of a closed loop in the `y=0, x>0` half-plane (the positive xz-plane). Let's call this loop `C₂`.\n\n3.  **Linking Number of `C₁` and `C₂`:**\n    `C₁` is a circle of radius `1/√2 ≈ 0.707` in the xy-plane.\n    `C₂` is a loop in the xz-plane.\n    The linking number `Lk(C₁, C₂)` is the number of times `C₂` pierces the surface bounded by `C₁`, with sign. Let's take the surface to be the disk `D₁` defined by `x² + y² ≤ 0.5, z=0`.\n    The loop `C₂` intersects this disk when a point on `C₂` satisfies `z=0`. Setting `z=0` in the equation for `C₂`:\n    `(x² - 0.5)² = (ln(2)/10)²`\n    `x² - 0.5 = ± ln(2)/10`\n    `x² = 0.5 ± ln(2)/10 ≈ 0.5 ± 0.0693`\n    Since `x>0`, we have two intersection points:\n    `x₁ = sqrt(0.5 - 0.0693) ≈ sqrt(0.4307) ≈ 0.656`\n    `x₂ = sqrt(0.5 + 0.0693) ≈ sqrt(0.5693) ≈ 0.755`\n    The disk `D₁` in the xz-plane is the line segment from `x=0` to `x=1/√2 ≈ 0.707`.\n    The point `x₁ ≈ 0.656` is inside the disk (`x₁ < 1/√2`).\n    The point `x₂ ≈ 0.755` is outside the disk (`x₂ > 1/√2`).\n    The loop `C₂` pierces the disk `D₁` exactly once. Therefore, the linking number is `|Lk(C₁, C₂)| = 1`.\n\nThe Hopf charge is equal to this linking number. By convention, we can take the positive value.\n\n### Step 3: Topological Analysis using Winding Numbers\n\nThe Hopf charge `Q` for configurations of this type can also be calculated as the product of two winding numbers, `Q = p * q`.\n\n1.  **Azimuthal Winding Number `p`:** This number describes how the field winds around the z-axis. It is determined by the function `f`. The given field has `f = atan2(y, x) = φ` (the cylindrical angle). This corresponds to a winding number of `p=1`.\n\n2.  **Meridional Winding Number `q`:** This number describes how the vector `n` rotates in any plane containing the z-axis (a meridional plane) as one moves from the center to infinity. This is determined by the function `G`. We need to check the range of `G` covered along a radial path.\n    Let's take a path along the positive x-axis from `x=0` to `x=∞` (with `y=z=0`).\n    -   At the origin `(0,0,0)`, `r2 = sqrt((-0.5)² + 0) = 0.5`. `G(0) = π * exp(-5) ≈ 0.02π`.\n    -   At `x = 1/√2`, `r2 = sqrt((0.5-0.5)² + 0) = 0`. `G(1/√2) = π * exp(0) = π`.\n    -   At `x → ∞`, `r2 → ∞`. `G(∞) = 0`.\n    Along this path, the angle `G` goes from a value close to `0`, up to `π`, and back down to `0`. The vector `(nx, nz)` (since `f=0` on this path) is `(sin(G), cos(G))`. This vector starts near `(0,1)`, moves to `(0,-1)` (when `G=π`), and returns to `(0,1)`. This constitutes one full turn in the meridional plane, so the winding number `q=1`.\n\nThe total Hopf charge is `Q = p * q = 1 * 1 = 1`.\n\n### Step 4: Whitehead Integral Formula\n\nThe Hopf charge is formally given by the Whitehead integral:\n`Q_H = - (1 / (4π²)) ∫_{R³} A ∧ F`\nwhere `F = dA` is the pullback of the area form on `S²`, and `A` is the corresponding potential 1-form.\nIn vector calculus terms, this is the helicity integral `Q_H = - (1 / (4π²)) ∫ (A ⋅ B) dV`, where `B = ∇ × A`.\n\nWhile calculating this integral is possible, it is known to be subtle. The result can depend on the \"gauge\" choice for `A`, and naive calculations can lead to an incorrect result of zero if the chosen potential has singularities that are not handled correctly. The topological methods in Steps 2 and 3 are more robust and less prone to calculation errors for this type of problem. Both methods give a consistent result.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBoth the analysis of linking preimages and the product of winding numbers indicate that the Hopf charge of the given field is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
