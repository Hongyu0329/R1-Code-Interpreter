    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the first clue.**\nThe man is described as \"a joy-discovering sailor\" by the poet Andrei Voznesensky. This suggests the man was an explorer or seafarer who was the subject of one of Voznesensky's works. Voznesensky was a prominent Russian poet, so the figure is likely someone significant in Russian history or culture.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second clue.**\nVoznesensky's poetic question, \"Where is your grave, even a mound?\", is a crucial piece of information. It tells us that for a long time, the burial place of this man was unknown. His grave was lost to history, without even a simple marker.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the third clue.**\nThe final clue states that the \"answer to this question emerged in the late 1980s.\" This means that the location of the man's grave was discovered, or at least a definitive resting place was established and recognized, during that specific time period.\n\n**Step 4: Synthesize the clues to identify the man.**\nWe are looking for a Russian-connected explorer whose grave was lost and then found or re-established in the late 1980s.\n\n*   Andrei Voznesensky's most famous work involving an explorer is the libretto for the rock opera **\"Juno and Avos\"**.\n*   The protagonist of \"Juno and Avos\" is the Russian nobleman, diplomat, and explorer **Nikolai Rezanov** (1764-1807).\n*   Rezanov fits the description of a \"sailor.\" He commanded a major Russian expedition.\n*   Checking the history of his burial: Rezanov died in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, while returning from Russian America. He was buried there, but the original cemetery was later destroyed during the Soviet period, and the exact location of his grave was lost. This perfectly matches the clue about his lost grave.\n*   Checking the final clue: The immense popularity of \"Juno and Avos\" in the USSR sparked renewed public interest in Rezanov. This led to efforts to locate his remains. While the exact remains were not definitively identified, a formal monument was erected over his presumed burial site in the Troitskoye Cemetery in Krasnoyarsk in **1989**, thus providing a symbolic and official \"answer\" to Voznesensky's question right in the \"late 1980s.\"\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe man described in the clues is Nikolai Rezanov. The question asks for his last name.\n\n<<<Rezanov>>>"
