    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n*   **Location:** Piazza della Rotonda, Rome.\n*   **Famous Landmark:** The Pantheon church is located there.\n*   **Subject:** A \"unique architectural feature.\"\n*   **Action:** It was removed.\n*   **Timeframe:** Until 1950.\n*   **Agent:** The city administration.\n\n**Step 2: Initial Brainstorming and Elimination**\n*   Could it be part of the Pantheon itself? The question specifies the \"square\" (piazza), not the church. Also, famous features of the Pantheon that were removed (like the bronze roof tiles or Bernini's bell towers) were removed much earlier than 1950.\n*   Could it be the central fountain (Fontana del Pantheon)? No, the fountain is still there today.\n*   Could it be a specific building? The removal of an entire building would be a major event, but the term \"architectural feature\" suggests something more integrated into the square's design or function.\n\n**Step 3: Focus on the Time Period and \"Unique Feature\"**\n*   The first half of the 20th century was the golden age of tramways in many European cities. Rome had an extensive network.\n*   A \"unique architectural feature\" in a public square could relate to public infrastructure. How would a tram line be \"unique\" in this specific square?\n*   Researching the history of Rome's transportation system reveals that a tram line did indeed pass through the Piazza della Rotonda.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the Specific Feature**\n*   The tram line in the Piazza della Rotonda was not just a simple straight track. To navigate the square and its central fountain, the tracks were laid in a **circular loop** around the fountain.\n*   This created a remarkable and visually unique sight: a modern electric tram circulating around a 16th-century fountain and an ancient Roman temple. This perfectly fits the description of a \"unique architectural feature.\"\n\n**Step 5: Confirm the Removal and Date**\n*   After World War II, Rome's city administration began to phase out many tram lines in the congested historic center, favoring buses and private cars.\n*   The tram ring in Piazza della Rotonda was one of the lines that was decommissioned and physically removed during this period. The year 1950 falls directly within this timeframe of dismantling the old tram network in the city center.\n\n**Step 6: Final Conclusion**\n*   The unique architectural feature that existed in the Piazza della Rotonda until its removal around 1950 was the circular tram track that looped around the central fountain.\n\n<<<A circular tram track (a tram ring) that looped around the central fountain.>>>"
