    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of the given coiled-coil sequence.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Coiled-Coil Heptad Repeat**\nCoiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that wrap around each other. Their sequences are characterized by a seven-amino-acid repeating pattern, denoted as **(abcdefg)n**. The stability and oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of the coiled-coil are primarily determined by the packing of amino acid side chains at the core positions.\n*   **Positions `a` and `d`:** These are the core positions. They are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. The side chains from these positions on one helix pack into the spaces (or \"holes\") between side chains on the adjacent helix. This is called the \"knobs-into-holes\" interaction.\n*   **Positions `e` and `g`:** These positions flank the hydrophobic core and are often occupied by charged or polar residues that can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between the helices.\n*   **Positions `b`, `c`, and `f`:** These are solvent-exposed positions and are usually occupied by hydrophilic residues.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Heptad Repeat in the Given Sequence**\nThe sequence is: `GEIAQSLKEIAKSLKEIAWSLKEIAQSLKG`\nWe need to assign the `abcdefg` register to this sequence. We do this by looking for a repeating pattern of hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions. Let's test different starting points for the repeat. The most plausible arrangement is the one that places hydrophobic residues consistently at the `a` and `d` positions.\n\nLet's try aligning the sequence starting with the first Alanine (A) as position `a`.\nSequence: `G E I **A** Q S **L** K E I **A** K S **L** K E I **A** W S **L** K E I **A** Q S **L** K G`\nRegister: `        **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f g **a** b c **d** e f`\n\nLet's list the amino acids at each position of the heptad repeat:\n*   **Position `a`:** A, A, A, A (Alanine) -> Consistently a small hydrophobic residue.\n*   **Position `d`:** L, L, L, L (Leucine) -> Consistently a larger hydrophobic residue.\n*   **Position `e`:** K, K, K, K (Lysine) -> Consistently a positively charged residue.\n*   **Position `g`:** I, I, I, I (Isoleucine) -> Consistently a hydrophobic residue.\n*   **Other positions:** `b` (Q, K, W, Q), `c` (S, S, S, S), `f` (E, E, E, E) are a mix of polar, charged, and one large hydrophobic (W) residue, which is reasonable for solvent-exposed or partially interacting sites.\n\nThis alignment gives a very regular and chemically sensible pattern for the core (`a`, `d`) and flanking (`e`, `g`) positions, confirming it's the correct register.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Core Packing to Determine Oligomeric State**\nThe size and type of amino acids at the `a` and `d` core positions are strong predictors of the oligomeric state.\n\n*   **Dimer (2 helices):** Typically has larger hydrophobic residues like Leucine (L) or Isoleucine (I) at both `a` and `d` positions for optimal knobs-into-holes packing.\n*   **Trimer (3 helices):** The core is more constrained. The `a` position is deeply buried and often requires a beta-branched residue (Isoleucine or Valine) for efficient packing. The `d` position is often Leucine. A common pattern is `a=I/V`, `d=L`.\n*   **Tetramer (4 helices):** A four-helix bundle has a different packing geometry. The `a` positions from the four helices pack against each other, and the `d` positions pack against each other. For this to be sterically favorable, there is often a size complementarity. A common and very stable pattern for a tetramer is having a **small** hydrophobic residue (like Alanine, A) at one core position and a **large** one (like Leucine, L) at the other.\n*   **Higher-order oligomers (Pentamers, etc.):** Often require polar residues (like Asparagine, N) in the core to avoid steric clashes and to form stabilizing hydrogen bond networks.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the Analysis to the Sequence**\nOur sequence has:\n*   **`a` position = Alanine (A)**, which is a small hydrophobic residue.\n*   **`d` position = Leucine (L)**, which is a larger hydrophobic residue.\n\nThis pattern of `a=small (A)` and `d=large (L)` is a classic signature for a **tetrameric (4-helix)** coiled-coil. The small Alanine side chains can pack efficiently together in the center of the bundle (`a-a` interactions), while the larger Leucine side chains pack together in a separate layer (`d-d` interactions). This arrangement maximizes packing efficiency and hydrophobic burial, strongly favoring a tetrameric state over a dimer or trimer.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of hydrophobic Isoleucine at the `g` position can also contribute to the hydrophobic surface area, further stabilizing a higher-order oligomer like a tetramer where the core is more extensive.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBased on the analysis of the core positions (`a`=Alanine, `d`=Leucine), which shows a classic pattern for size complementarity in a four-helix bundle, the most probable oligomeric state for this coiled-coil is a tetramer.\n\nFinal Answer is 4.\n\n<<<C>>>"
