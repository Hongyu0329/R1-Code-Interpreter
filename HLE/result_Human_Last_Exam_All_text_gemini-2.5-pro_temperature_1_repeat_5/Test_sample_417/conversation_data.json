    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of the given molecule.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the molecule.**\n\nThe molecule is 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene.\n\nLet's break down the structure into three parts:\n1.  **Central Core:** A 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (mesitylene) ring.\n2.  **Linker:** A methylene group (-CH₂-).\n3.  **Substituent Arm:** A complex, chiral group derived from camphor, specifically `((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)`.\n\nThe full structure consists of the mesitylene core with its hydrogens at positions 1, 3, and 5 replaced by the `-CH₂-[Arm]` groups.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the overall symmetry of the molecule.**\n\nThe central core (1,3,5-substituted benzene) has a three-fold rotational axis (C₃) passing through the center of the ring. The three substituent arms are identical. The name specifies a single stereoisomer for the chiral arm (`(4S,7R)`), so all three arms are the same enantiomer.\n\nAssuming that rotation around the single bonds connecting the core, linkers, and arms is fast on the NMR timescale, the molecule as a whole will possess C₃ symmetry. This is a critical point: this symmetry makes the three large arms chemically equivalent.\n\n**Step 3: Count the number of signals from each unique part of the molecule.**\n\nDue to the C₃ symmetry, we only need to count the number of chemically non-equivalent protons in one-third of the molecule and on the central core.\n\n*   **Part 1: The Central Core (Mesitylene)**\n    *   There are three methyl groups (-CH₃) at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the benzene ring.\n    *   These three methyl groups are related by the C₃ axis of symmetry, making them chemically equivalent.\n    *   Therefore, these 9 protons will produce a single peak in the ¹H NMR spectrum.\n    *   **Signals from core = 1**\n\n*   **Part 2: The Methylene Linkers (-CH₂-)**\n    *   There are three -CH₂- groups, one for each arm. These three groups are equivalent due to the C₃ symmetry.\n    *   Let's consider one linker: `Ar-CH₂-N`. The carbon of the -CH₂- group is attached to the benzene ring and to the nitrogen of the chiral arm.\n    *   Because the arm is chiral, the two protons on the methylene group are diastereotopic. They are in different chemical environments and are not interchangeable by any symmetry operation.\n    *   Therefore, these two protons are chemically non-equivalent and will give rise to two separate signals (which will likely appear as a pair of doublets, known as an AB quartet).\n    *   **Signals from linkers = 2**\n\n*   **Part 3: The Substituent Arm**\n    *   We only need to analyze one arm, as all three are equivalent. The arm is `(4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl`. This is a rigid, chiral bicyclic system based on a camphor skeleton.\n    *   Since the arm is chiral and lacks any internal plane of symmetry, all protons that are not in constitutionally identical positions will be chemically non-equivalent. Let's count them based on the known structure of camphor-derived pyrazoles.\n        1.  **Pyrazole Proton:** The pyrazole ring has one C-H proton. This will give **1 signal**.\n        2.  **Methyl Protons:** There are three methyl groups on the camphor skeleton. They are in constitutionally and stereochemically distinct environments (e.g., one on a bridgehead, two as a gem-dimethyl pair on the bridge). The two gem-dimethyls are themselves diastereotopic. Thus, the three methyl groups are non-equivalent. This will give **3 signals**.\n        3.  **Bridgehead Proton:** The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton has a proton at one of the bridgehead carbons (the one without a methyl group). This will give **1 signal**.\n        4.  **Methylene Protons on the Skeleton:** There are two -CH₂- groups in the six-membered ring of the skeleton. These two -CH₂- groups are in different environments relative to the fused pyrazole ring and methyl substituents. Within each -CH₂- group, the two protons (exo and endo) are diastereotopic. Therefore, we have 4 chemically non-equivalent methylene protons in total. This will give **4 signals** (2 from the first CH₂, 2 from the second CH₂).\n    *   Summing up the signals from one arm: 1 (pyrazole H) + 3 (methyls) + 1 (bridgehead H) + 4 (skeleton CH₂) = **9 signals**.\n    *   **Signals from one arm = 9**\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total number of expected peaks.**\n\nThe total number of peaks is the sum of the signals from each unique part of the molecule.\n\nTotal Signals = (Signals from core) + (Signals from linkers) + (Signals from one arm)\nTotal Signals = 1 + 2 + 9 = 12\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\n\nThere are 12 sets of chemically non-equivalent protons in the molecule. Therefore, we expect to see 12 distinct peaks (signals) in the ¹H NMR spectrum, assuming no accidental overlap of signals.\n\n<<<H>>>"
