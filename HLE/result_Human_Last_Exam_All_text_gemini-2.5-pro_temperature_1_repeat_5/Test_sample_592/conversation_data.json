    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the US city Tommaso moves to in the movie *Ovosodo*.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the core question:** The user wants to know the specific US city where the character Tommaso moves in the 1997 film *Ovosodo*.\n2.  **Identify the key elements:**\n    *   **Movie:** *Ovosodo* (also known as *Hard Boiled Egg*)\n    *   **Year:** 1997\n    *   **Character:** Tommaso\n    *   **Actor:** Marco Cocci\n    *   **Event:** Moving to the United States.\n3.  **Research the plot:** The primary task is to find a detailed plot summary of the film. It's important to focus on the character arc of Tommaso, who is the best friend of the protagonist, Piero.\n4.  **Differentiate the characters:** The film's protagonist is Piero, who lives in Livorno, Italy. His wealthy friend is Tommaso. We need to track Tommaso's storyline, not Piero's.\n5.  **Locate the specific event in the plot:** In the latter part of the movie, after finishing his studies and a period of rebellion, Tommaso decides to \"settle down.\" His father offers him a job within the family company.\n6.  **Find the destination:** This job requires Tommaso to relocate. Plot summaries and film databases specify that he moves to the United States. To find the specific city, a more detailed synopsis is needed.\n7.  **Verify the city:** By checking detailed plot descriptions and film encyclopedias (particularly Italian sources, where the film is more prominent), we can confirm the exact location. These sources state that Tommaso moves to work in the American branch of his family's business.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Character confusion:** Do not confuse the story of the protagonist, Piero, with that of his friend, Tommaso. Piero remains in Italy.\n*   **Source reliability:** It is best to cross-reference information from multiple sources like IMDb, Wikipedia (especially the original Italian version for an Italian film), and reputable movie review sites to ensure accuracy.\n*   **Specificity:** The question asks for a specific city, not just the country. The detail is present in the film's plot, even if it's a minor point in the overall narrative.\n\n**Acquiring the final answer:**\n\nFollowing the steps above, a review of the film's plot confirms that Tommaso, after accepting a job from his father, moves to the United States. Detailed synopses of *Ovosodo* explicitly mention that the city he relocates to is Philadelphia.\n\n<<<Philadelphia>>>"
