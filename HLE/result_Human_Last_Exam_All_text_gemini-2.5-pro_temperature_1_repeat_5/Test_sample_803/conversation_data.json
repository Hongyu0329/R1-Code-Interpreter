    "This problem asks for the classification of all nonabelian filled groups of a specific order. Let's break down the problem into definitions, structural analysis of the groups, and case-by-case examination.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Definitions\n\nFirst, we must be precise about the terminology. Let G be a finite group.\n\n1.  **Product-Free Set:** A subset S ⊆ G is product-free if for any two elements x, y ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), their product xy is not in S. In set notation, S ∩ (S ⋅ S) = ∅. A direct consequence is that the identity element `e` cannot belong to any product-free set S, because e ⋅ e = e ∈ S would be a contradiction.\n\n2.  **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set:** A product-free set S is maximal by inclusion (or simply maximal) if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set in G. This is equivalent to saying that for any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is no longer product-free.\n\n3.  **A Set that Fills a Group:** A subset S ⊆ G is said to fill G if G = S⁻¹S, where S⁻¹S = {s₁⁻¹s₂ | s₁, s₂ ∈ S}.\n    *   **Careful Point:** This definition is crucial. An alternative but incorrect interpretation of \"fills\" might be G = G ⋅ S = {gs | g ∈ G, s ∈ S}, which is true for any non-empty subset S. The correct definition is G = S⁻¹S.\n\n4.  **Filled Group:** A group G is called a filled group if *every* maximal product-free set in G fills G. If we can find even one maximal product-free set S in G such that S⁻¹S ≠ G, then G is not a filled group.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Structure of Groups of Order 2q^m\n\nLet G be a nonabelian group of order |G| = 2q^m, where q is an odd prime and m ≥ 1 is a natural number.\n\n*   By Sylow's Theorems, the number of Sylow q-subgroups, n_q, must divide 2 and satisfy n_q ≡ 1 (mod q). Since q is an odd prime, q does not divide 2, and 2 <binary data, 3 bytes> 1 (mod q) unless q=1, which is not a prime. The only possibility is n_q = 1. Therefore, G has a unique, and thus normal, Sylow q-subgroup. Let's call this subgroup Q, with |Q| = q^m.\n*   Let P be a Sylow 2-subgroup. |P| = 2, so P is isomorphic to Z₂, the cyclic group of order 2. Let P = <x> where x² = e.\n*   Since Q is a normal subgroup, G is a semidirect product of Q and P, denoted G = Q ⋊ P.\n*   The structure of G is determined by a homomorphism φ: P → Aut(Q), where Aut(Q) is the group of automorphisms of Q. Since P = <x> is of order 2, the homomorphism is determined entirely by the image of x, φ(x), which must be an automorphism of Q whose order divides 2. So, (φ(x))² is the identity automorphism on Q.\n\nWe have two cases for the homomorphism φ:\n\n*   **Case A: The action is trivial.** φ(x) is the identity automorphism on Q. In this case, the semidirect product is a direct product: G = Q × P ≅ Q × Z₂. For G to be nonabelian, the subgroup Q must be nonabelian.\n*   **Case B: The action is non-trivial.** φ(x) is an automorphism of Q of order 2. In this case, G is a non-trivial semidirect product and is always nonabelian.\n\nWe will now analyze these two cases to see if they can be filled groups.\n\n### Step 3: Case-by-Case Analysis\n\n#### Case A: G = Q × Z₂ with Q nonabelian\n\nWe use a known theorem about filled groups:\n**Theorem:** A finite group G is not filled if it contains a proper normal subgroup N such that the quotient group G/N is not an elementary abelian 2-group (i.e., not a group where every non-identity element has order 2).\n\n*   Since Q is a nonabelian q-group (where q is an odd prime), its center Z(Q) is non-trivial and is a proper subgroup of Q.\n*   Consider the subgroup N = Z(Q) × {e} in G = Q × Z₂. Since Z(Q) is a characteristic subgroup of Q, and Q is normal in G, N is a normal subgroup of G.\n*   Consider the quotient group G/N:\n    G/N = (Q × Z₂) / (Z(Q) × {e}) ≅ (Q/Z(Q)) × Z₂.\n*   Since Q is nonabelian, Q/Z(Q) is a non-trivial q-group. Its order is a power of the odd prime q. Therefore, G/N contains elements of odd order greater than 1.\n*   A group with elements of odd order > 1 cannot be an elementary abelian 2-group.\n*   By the theorem stated above, G is not a filled group.\n\nThus, no group of the form Q × Z₂ with Q nonabelian is a filled group.\n\n#### Case B: G = Q ⋊ Z₂ (non-trivial semidirect product)\n\nHere, G is nonabelian, and consists of elements of Q and elements of the form `qx` where q ∈ Q and x is the element of order 2. The multiplication rule is (q₁x)(q₂x) = q₁α(q₂), where α = φ(x) is the automorphism of Q of order 2.\n\nWe will test if G is filled by constructing a maximal product-free set and checking if it fills G.\n\n*   Consider the set S = Qx = {qx | q ∈ Q}. This is the coset of Q containing the element x.\n*   **Is S product-free?** Let s₁, s₂ ∈ S. Then s₁ = q₁x and s₂ = q₂x for some q₁, q₂ ∈ Q. Their product is s₁s₂ = (q₁x)(q₂x) = q₁α(q₂). Since q₁, α(q₂) ∈ Q, their product is in Q. An element of Q cannot be in the coset Qx (since Q ∩ Qx = ∅). Therefore, s₁s₂ ∉ S. So, S is a product-free set.\n*   **Is S maximal?** To be maximal, for any element g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} must not be product-free. Here G \\ S = Q. So we take any g ∈ Q. We need to show that S ∪ {g} is not product-free. This means there exist a, b ∈ S ∪ {g} such that ab ∈ S ∪ {g}.\n    We have already shown that S ⋅ S ⊆ Q. Let's see if S ⋅ S covers all of Q.\n    S ⋅ S = { (q₁x)(q₂x) | q₁, q₂ ∈ Q } = { q₁α(q₂) | q₁, q₂ ∈ Q }.\n    Since α is an automorphism of Q, the set {α(q₂) | q₂ ∈ Q} is simply Q. So S ⋅ S = Q ⋅ Q = Q.\n    This means for any element g ∈ Q, there exist s₁, s₂ ∈ S such that s₁s₂ = g. This directly implies that for any g ∈ G \\ S, the set S ∪ {g} is not product-free. Thus, S is a maximal product-free set.\n*   **Does S fill G?** For G to be filled, this maximal product-free set S must fill G, meaning G = S⁻¹S.\n    Let's compute S⁻¹.\n    S⁻¹ = (Qx)⁻¹ = { (qx)⁻¹ | q ∈ Q } = { x⁻¹q⁻¹ | q ∈ Q }.\n    Since x⁻¹ = x and xq⁻¹x⁻¹ = α(q⁻¹), we have x⁻¹q⁻¹ = α(q⁻¹)x.\n    So S⁻¹ = { α(q⁻¹)x | q ∈ Q }. Since α is an automorphism and q⁻¹ runs through all of Q\\{e}, α(q⁻¹) runs through all of Q\\{e}. Thus, S⁻¹ = Qx = S.\n    Now we can compute S⁻¹S:\n    S⁻¹S = S ⋅ S = Q.\n    The condition for filling is G = S⁻¹S, which translates to G = Q. This is false, because |G| = 2|Q|.\n\nSince we have found a maximal product-free set S = Qx which does not fill G, the group G is not filled.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have analyzed all possible structures for a nonabelian group G of order 2q^m.\n*   In Case A (direct product), the group is not filled.\n*   In Case B (non-trivial semidirect product), the group is not filled.\n\nThere are no structures for a nonabelian group of order 2q^m that satisfy the condition of being a filled group.\n\nThe final answer is that the set of such groups is empty.\n\n<<<There are no nonabelian filled groups of order 2q^m for any odd prime q and natural number m.>>>"
