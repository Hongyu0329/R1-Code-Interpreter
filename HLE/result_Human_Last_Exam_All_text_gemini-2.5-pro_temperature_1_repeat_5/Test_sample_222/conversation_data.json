    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:**\n    We are given the 4-point Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs) of two 4-point sequences, `x(n)` and `h(n)`. Let's denote them as `X(k)` and `H(k)`.\n    *   `X(k) = [1, j, -1, -j]`\n    *   `H(k) = [0, 1+j, 1, 1-j]`\n    We need to find the 8-point DFT of a new 8-point sequence, `y(n)`, which is formed by interleaving `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   `y(n) = {x(0), h(0), x(1), h(1), x(2), h(2), x(3), h(3)}`\n\n2.  **Relate the New Sequence to the Originals:**\n    The new sequence `y(n)` can be expressed in terms of the original sequences `x(n)` and `h(n)`.\n    *   The even-indexed elements of `y(n)` are from `x(n)`: `y(2m) = x(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n    *   The odd-indexed elements of `y(n)` are from `h(n)`: `y(2m+1) = h(m)` for `m = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the DFT of the New Sequence:**\n    The 8-point DFT of `y(n)`, denoted as `Y(k)`, is given by the formula:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{n=0}^{7} y(n) * W_8^(nk)`, where `W_N = e^(-j*2*pi/N)` is the twiddle factor.\n\n    We can split the summation into even and odd indices for `n`. Let `n = 2m` for even indices and `n = 2m+1` for odd indices.\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m) * W_8^((2m)k) + sum_{m=0}^{3} y(2m+1) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\n    Substitute `y(2m) = x(m)` and `y(2m+1) = h(m)`:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_8^(2mk) + sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_8^((2m+1)k)`\n\n4.  **Simplify the Expression (Decimation-In-Time Principle):**\n    We use the property of the twiddle factor `W_N^(2p) = W_{N/2}^p`. Therefore, `W_8^(2mk) = W_4^(mk)`.\n    The second term's twiddle factor can be written as `W_8^((2m+1)k) = W_8^(2mk) * W_8^k = W_4^(mk) * W_8^k`.\n\n    Substituting these back, we get:\n    `Y(k) = sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) + W_8^k * sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk)`\n\n    The summations are the definitions of the 4-point DFTs of `x(n)` and `h(n)`:\n    *   `sum_{m=0}^{3} x(m) * W_4^(mk) = X(k mod 4)`\n    *   `sum_{m=0}^{3} h(m) * W_4^(mk) = H(k mod 4)`\n\n    So, the formula to calculate `Y(k)` is:\n    `Y(k) = X(k mod 4) + W_8^k * H(k mod 4)` for `k = 0, 1, ..., 7`.\n\n    This is the core relationship used in the \"butterfly\" operation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. For `k >= 4`, we can use the property `W_8^(k+4) = -W_8^k`, which leads to:\n    *   `Y(k)     = X(k) + W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n    *   `Y(k+4) = X(k) - W_8^k * H(k)` for `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`\n\n5.  **Calculate the Twiddle Factors `W_8^k`:**\n    *   `W_8^0 = e^0 = 1`\n    *   `W_8^1 = e^(-j*pi/4) = cos(pi/4) - j*sin(pi/4) = (1 - j) / sqrt(2)`\n    *   `W_8^2 = e^(-j*pi/2) = -j`\n    *   `W_8^3 = e^(-j*3*pi/4) = cos(3pi/4) - j*sin(3pi/4) = (-1 - j) / sqrt(2)`\n\n6.  **Calculate the 8-Point DFT `Y(k)`:**\n\n    *   **For k = 0:**\n        `Y(0) = X(0) + W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 + (1)(0) = 1`\n    *   **For k = 1:**\n        `Y(1) = X(1) + W_8^1 * H(1) = j + [(1 - j) / sqrt(2)] * (1 + j) = j + (1 - j^2) / sqrt(2) = j + 2 / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) + j`\n    *   **For k = 2:**\n        `Y(2) = X(2) + W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 + (-j)(1) = -1 - j`\n    *   **For k = 3:**\n        `Y(3) = X(3) + W_8^3 * H(3) = -j + [(-1 - j) / sqrt(2)] * (1 - j) = -j + (-1 + j - j + j^2) / sqrt(2) = -j + (-2) / sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2) - j`\n    *   **For k = 4:**\n        `Y(4) = X(0) - W_8^0 * H(0) = 1 - (1)(0) = 1`\n    *   **For k = 5:**\n        `Y(5) = X(1) - W_8^1 * H(1) = j - [(1 - j) / sqrt(2)] * (1 + j) = j - 2 / sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2) + j`\n    *   **For k = 6:**\n        `Y(6) = X(2) - W_8^2 * H(2) = -1 - (-j)(1) = -1 + j`\n    *   **For k = 7:**\n        `Y(7) = X(3) - W_8^3 * H(3) = -j - [(-1 - j) / sqrt(2)] * (1 - j) = -j - (-2) / sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) - j`\n\n7.  **Final Answer:**\n    Combining the results for `k = 0` to `7`, the 8-point DFT `Y(k)` is:\n    `[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]`\n\n<<<[1, sqrt(2)+j, -1-j, -sqrt(2)-j, 1, -sqrt(2)+j, -1+j, sqrt(2)-j]>>>"
