    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the minimum number of vertices in a two-loop Feynman diagram for an interacting scalar field theory.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify Key Parameters of a Feynman Diagram**\n\nA Feynman diagram is a graph whose properties can be described by several key numbers:\n*   **V**: The number of vertices. Vertices represent interaction points.\n*   **I**: The number of internal lines. These represent virtual particles propagating between interaction points.\n*   **E**: The number of external lines. These represent the incoming and outgoing particles of the process.\n*   **L**: The number of independent loops. The number of loops corresponds to the number of independent momentum integrals in the diagram's mathematical expression.\n*   **n**: The number of lines that meet at each vertex. This is determined by the type of interaction in the Lagrangian. For example, a theory with a $\\lambda \\phi^4$ interaction term has vertices where **n=4** lines meet. For an interaction to occur, we must have **n ≥ 3**.\n\n**2. Use the Topological Formula for Loops**\n\nThere is a fundamental relationship in graph theory that connects the number of loops, internal lines, and vertices in any connected graph. For Feynman diagrams, this formula is:\n$L = I - V + 1$\n\n**3. Relate Lines to Vertices**\n\nAnother relationship comes from counting the \"ends\" of the lines. Each of the **V** vertices has **n** lines attached to it, so there are a total of **n x V** line ends connected to vertices. Each internal line connects two vertices (accounting for two ends), and each external line connects to one vertex (accounting for one end). This gives us the equation:\n$n \\times V = 2 \\times I + E$\n\n**4. Solve for the Number of Vertices (V)**\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum **V** for a fixed **L=2**. We can do this by combining the two equations above to express **V** in terms of **L**, **E**, and **n**.\n\nFirst, rearrange the loop formula to solve for **I**:\n$I = L + V - 1$\n\nNow, substitute this expression for **I** into the second equation:\n$n V = 2(L + V - 1) + E$\n$n V = 2L + 2V - 2 + E$\n\nGroup the terms with **V** on one side:\n$n V - 2V = 2L - 2 + E$\n$V(n - 2) = 2L - 2 + E$\n\nFinally, solve for **V**:\n$V = \\frac{2L - 2 + E}{n - 2}$\n\n**5. Apply the Specific Conditions of the Question**\n\nThe question specifies a **two-loop** diagram, so we set **L=2**:\n$V = \\frac{2(2) - 2 + E}{n - 2} = \\frac{2 + E}{n - 2}$\n\n**6. Minimize the Number of Vertices (V)**\n\nWe want to find the minimum possible integer value for **V**. To minimize the value of the fraction $V = \\frac{2 + E}{n - 2}$, we must consider the constraints on **n** and **E**:\n*   The interaction must involve at least three fields, so **n ≥ 3**.\n*   The number of external lines must be a non-negative integer, so **E ≥ 0**.\n*   The number of vertices **V** must be a positive integer, so **V ≥ 1**.\n\nTo minimize **V**, we should:\n*   Minimize the numerator ($2 + E$) by choosing the smallest possible value for **E**. The absolute minimum is **E=0**, which corresponds to a \"vacuum diagram\" (a diagram with no external particles).\n*   Maximize the denominator ($n - 2$) by choosing a suitable interaction type **n**.\n\nLet's see if it's possible to have a diagram with just **V=1**, the smallest possible positive integer.\nSetting **V=1** in our equation:\n$1 = \\frac{2 + E}{n - 2}$\n$n - 2 = 2 + E$\n$n = 4 + E$\n\nNow we need to see if we can find valid values for **n** and **E** that satisfy this relationship. Let's try the simplest case by minimizing **E**.\nIf we choose **E=0** (a vacuum diagram), the equation gives:\n$n = 4 + 0 = 4$\n\n**7. Verify the Result and Conclude**\n\nThis result tells us that for an interacting scalar field theory with **n=4** (which is the standard $\\phi^4$ theory), it is possible to have a two-loop (**L=2**) diagram with one vertex (**V=1**) and no external lines (**E=0**).\n\nLet's visualize this diagram to confirm it's valid.\n*   Start with a single vertex (**V=1**).\n*   In a $\\phi^4$ theory, this vertex must have four lines attached.\n*   To have no external lines (**E=0**), all four of these lines must be internal.\n*   An internal line must connect two vertices. Since we only have one vertex, the lines must loop back and connect to the same vertex.\n*   We can connect two of the lines to form one internal propagator (one loop), and connect the other two lines to form a second internal propagator (a second loop).\n*   This creates a \"figure-eight\" or \"double-scoop\" diagram. Let's check its loop number with the formula: $L = I - V + 1$. Here, $I=2$ and $V=1$, so $L = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2$. This is indeed a two-loop diagram.\n\nSince we have found a valid two-loop diagram in a common interacting scalar field theory that has only one vertex, and the number of vertices cannot be less than one, the minimum number of vertices is 1.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$."
