    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction:\n\n**1. Identify the Reactants and Reagents:**\n*   **Substrate:** (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. This is a secondary alkyl halide on a cyclohexane ring. The stereochemistry (1S, 2R) is given, which is crucial.\n*   **Reagent:** Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH). Potassium tert-butoxide is a strong, sterically hindered (bulky) base.\n\n**2. Determine the Reaction Type:**\n*   The reaction of a secondary alkyl halide with a strong base strongly favors an elimination reaction over substitution.\n*   Because the base is strong, the mechanism will be E2 (bimolecular elimination), not E1.\n*   **Careful Point:** The E2 mechanism has a strict stereochemical requirement: the leaving group (Bromine) and the proton being removed (a β-hydrogen) must be in an **anti-periplanar** configuration. In a cyclohexane chair conformation, this means they must both be in axial positions, pointing in opposite directions (one up, one down). This is called a **trans-diaxial** arrangement.\n\n**3. Analyze the Conformation of the Substrate:**\n*   First, determine the relative orientation of the bromo and methyl groups. Substituents with (1S, 2R) or (1R, 2S) configurations on a cyclohexane ring are **trans** to each other.\n*   A trans-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane can exist in two chair conformations that are in equilibrium: one where both substituents are axial (diaxial) and one where both are equatorial (diequatorial).\n*   The diequatorial conformation is much more stable than the diaxial conformation due to less steric strain. Therefore, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane will predominantly exist in the diequatorial conformation.\n*   **Careful Point:** Although the diequatorial form is more stable, the E2 reaction can only occur from the less stable diaxial conformation, as this is the only one that satisfies the anti-periplanar requirement for the leaving group. The molecule must undergo a ring-flip to the reactive diaxial conformation.\n\n**4. Identify the Reactive Conformation and Available β-Hydrogens:**\n*   Let's draw the reactive (diaxial) conformation of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane. In this conformer, the Bromine at C1 is **axial**, and the methyl group at C2 is also **axial**.\n*   The base needs to remove a β-hydrogen (a hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to the one with the bromine). The β-carbons are C2 and C6.\n*   We must now look for **axial** hydrogens on C2 and C6.\n    *   **At C2:** The methyl group is in the axial position. This means the hydrogen on C2 is in the **equatorial** position. Since this hydrogen is not axial, it is not anti-periplanar to the axial bromine. Therefore, elimination cannot occur towards C2 to form 1-methylcyclohexene (the Zaitsev product).\n    *   **At C6:** This carbon has two hydrogens. One is axial, and one is equatorial. The **axial hydrogen** at C6 is anti-periplanar to the axial bromine at C1.\n*   **Careful Point:** The stereochemical requirement of the E2 reaction dictates that elimination is only possible by removing the axial hydrogen from C6.\n\n**5. Determine the Product:**\n*   Since the base can only remove the axial hydrogen from C6, the double bond will form between C1 and C6.\n*   The methyl group at C2 is unaffected by the elimination and remains on the ring.\n*   The resulting product is a cyclohexene with the double bond between the carbons that were C1 and C6, and a methyl group on the carbon that was C2.\n*   **Naming the Product:** According to IUPAC nomenclature, the double bond is given the lowest possible numbers (1 and 2). If we number the double bond carbons as 1 and 2, the methyl group will be at position 3.\n*   Therefore, the name of the product is **3-methylcyclohexene**. This is the less substituted alkene (the Hofmann product), which is formed because the more substituted alkene (the Zaitsev product, 1-methylcyclohexene) cannot be formed due to stereochemical constraints.\n\n<<<3-methylcyclohexene>>>"
