Given the constraints, the two primary problems for the JTB theory are:

1.  **The Problem of the Missing State of Justification:** The JTB theory requires "Justification" as a necessary condition for knowledge. However, being justified is itself an epistemic state (e.g., having access to evidence). The constraint that the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief means there is no place for the state of "being justified" to exist. Therefore, the JTB analysis cannot be performed because one of its essential components is disallowed by the rules of the system.

2.  **The Problem of the Contradictory Relationship between Knowledge and Belief:** The JTB theory defines Knowledge as a specific *type* of Belief (i.e., knowledge is a subset of belief). However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available states implies they are mutually exclusive categories; for any proposition, one is either in a state of Knowledge or a state of Belief, but not both. This creates a definitional contradiction, as a category (Knowledge) cannot simultaneously be a subset of another category (Belief) while also being mutually exclusive with it.
