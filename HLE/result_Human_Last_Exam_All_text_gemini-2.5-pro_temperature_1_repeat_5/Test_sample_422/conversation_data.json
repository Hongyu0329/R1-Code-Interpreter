    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question and its Constraints\n\n1.  **The Core Theory**: We must use the Justified True Belief (JTB) definition of knowledge. This means for a subject S to know a proposition P, three conditions must be met:\n    *   P is True (T).\n    *   S Believes P (B).\n    *   S's belief in P is Justified (J).\n    *   Symbolically: K = J ∧ T ∧ B.\n\n2.  **Primary Constraint**: We must ignore Gettier problems. Gettier problems are counterexamples that show a person can have a justified true belief that isn't knowledge due to luck. We must find problems with the JTB theory that are *not* of this type.\n\n3.  **Critical Constraint**: The *only available epistemic states* are Knowledge and Belief. An epistemic state is a state of mind regarding a proposition (e.g., knowing it, doubting it, believing it). This constraint simplifies the world of mental states drastically.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Critical Constraint\n\nThe constraint that the only epistemic states are \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" is the key to the puzzle. It creates an artificial, binary world. We must analyze what this implies.\n\n*   **Interpretation**: The most logical interpretation is that \"Knowledge\" and \"Belief\" are mutually exclusive categories. For any given proposition, a person's state is *either* Knowledge *or* Belief. If it were not exclusive, and knowledge was just a type of belief, then \"Belief\" wouldn't be a distinct state but a super-category, which contradicts the \"only two available states\" phrasing.\n*   **Implication**: This sets up a partition. The set of all propositions a person has an attitude towards is divided into two disjoint sets:\n    1.  The set of propositions the person **Knows**.\n    2.  The set of propositions the person **Believes** (but does not Know). We can call this \"Mere Belief\".\n\n### Step 3: Identifying the Problems by Applying the Constraints to the JTB Theory\n\nNow we test the JTB definition (K = JTB) within this constrained two-state world.\n\n**Problem 1: The Status of Justification**\n\n*   **Analysis**: The JTB theory requires \"Justification\" as a core component. Justification is what elevates a mere true belief to the status of knowledge. For a person to have a justified belief, they must be in a state of *having* that justification—they must possess the evidence, have access to the good reasons, or have a sound inferential pathway. This state of \"being justified\" is itself an epistemic state.\n*   **Conflict**: The problem's rules state that the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief. This leaves no room for a third state of \"being justified.\" How can we check if the \"J\" condition is met if the very state of being justified is not allowed to exist?\n*   **Conclusion**: The JTB framework cannot function in this constrained world because a key component of its definition, Justification, is an epistemic state that has been ruled out. The theory relies on a concept that cannot be instantiated.\n\n**Problem 2: The Definitional Contradiction of Belief**\n\n*   **Analysis**: According to the JTB definition, Knowledge is a *subset* of Belief. To know something, it is a prerequisite that you also believe it. The \"B\" in JTB establishes this hierarchical relationship: all things known are a special category of things believed.\n*   **Conflict**: The problem's rules establish Knowledge and Belief as two separate, mutually exclusive epistemic states. For any proposition P, you are either in the state of Knowledge(P) or the state of Belief(P), but not both. This creates a direct logical contradiction with the JTB definition. One cannot define X as a type of Y if X and Y are stipulated to be mutually exclusive categories. It is like saying \"the only two types of fruit are apples and fruit,\" which is incoherent.\n*   **Conclusion**: The fundamental structure of the JTB definition (`Knowledge is a ... Belief`) is incompatible with the structure of the epistemic world imposed by the constraints (`a state is either Knowledge or Belief`).\n\n---\n\n<<<\nGiven the constraints, the two primary problems for the JTB theory are:\n\n1.  **The Problem of the Missing State of Justification:** The JTB theory requires \"Justification\" as a necessary condition for knowledge. However, being justified is itself an epistemic state (e.g., having access to evidence). The constraint that the only available epistemic states are Knowledge and Belief means there is no place for the state of \"being justified\" to exist. Therefore, the JTB analysis cannot be performed because one of its essential components is disallowed by the rules of the system.\n\n2.  **The Problem of the Contradictory Relationship between Knowledge and Belief:** The JTB theory defines Knowledge as a specific *type* of Belief (i.e., knowledge is a subset of belief). However, the constraint that Knowledge and Belief are the only two available states implies they are mutually exclusive categories; for any proposition, one is either in a state of Knowledge or a state of Belief, but not both. This creates a definitional contradiction, as a category (Knowledge) cannot simultaneously be a subset of another category (Belief) while also being mutually exclusive with it."
