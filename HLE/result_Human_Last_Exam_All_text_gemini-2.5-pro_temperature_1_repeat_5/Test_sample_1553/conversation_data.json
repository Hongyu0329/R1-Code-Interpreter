    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the key elements of the question.**\n*   **Novel:** \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" (Perfect Imperfection)\n*   **Author:** Jacek Dukaj\n*   **Subject:** The main character of the novel.\n*   **Action:** Marriage.\n*   **Object:** The name of the person the main character marries.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the main character of the novel.**\nThe protagonist of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is Adam Zamoyski, a 21st-century human who has been cryogenically frozen and is resurrected in the distant, post-human future.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the concept of \"marriage\" within the context of the novel's world.**\nThe world of \"Perfekcyjna niedoskonałość\" is a far-future reality inhabited by post-human entities (\"stahs\") who exist beyond physical bodies and can manipulate reality itself. Human concepts like identity, love, and social contracts like marriage do not exist in their original form. Relationships are far more complex and can involve merging consciousness, symbiotic dependency, and fundamental modifications of one's being.\n\n**Step 4: Identify the main character's primary partner.**\nAdam Zamoyski's most significant and intimate relationship is with a powerful post-human entity named Angelika. She is his guide, protector, and lover. Their bond is the central relationship in the novel.\n\n**Step 5: Determine if a \"marriage\" takes place.**\nThere is no formal wedding or marriage ceremony in the traditional human sense described in the book. Such a ritual would be anachronistic and meaningless in the novel's setting. However, the bond between Adam and Angelika is a total, all-encompassing union that is far more profound and binding than a conventional marriage. He becomes completely dependent on her, and their existences become inextricably intertwined.\n\n**Step 6: Conclude the answer.**\nWhile the term \"marries\" is a human concept that doesn't perfectly map onto the post-human reality of the novel, the character who fills the role of Adam Zamoyski's partner in a union equivalent to marriage is Angelika. Their relationship is the closest the story comes to this concept, and she is universally understood to be his partner.\n\n<<<Angelika>>>"
