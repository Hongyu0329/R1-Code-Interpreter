    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the puzzle:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Haiku**\n\nThe haiku provides the clues to identify the subject of the riddle. Let's break it down line by line:\n\n*   **\"An August tempest\"**: This sets the time (the month of August) and the mood (a tempest, suggesting a chaotic, significant, and destructive event).\n*   **\"Twice fifteen brings winds of change\"**: This is a numerical clue. \"Twice fifteen\" is 2 x 15 = 30. This number, combined with \"winds of change,\" points to a pivotal historical event that occurred in the year 30. The \"winds of change\" implies a major shift in power or the end of an era.\n*   **\"A divine one yields\"**: This describes the central figure. \"A divine one\" refers to a person who was considered a god or deity. \"Yields\" means to give up, surrender, or die.\n\nSynthesizing these clues points directly to the death of Cleopatra VII of Egypt.\n*   She died in **August** of **30 BC**.\n*   Her death was a \"tempest\" that brought massive \"winds of change,\" marking the end of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and the Hellenistic Age, and the beginning of Roman Egypt.\n*   Cleopatra was worshipped by her people as the living incarnation of the goddess Isis, fitting the description \"a divine one.\" Her suicide was her way of \"yielding\" to her fate and her conqueror, Octavian.\n\n**Step 2: Interpret the Question**\n\nThe prompt states that the title, \"The Bays,\" is a question. In riddles of this nature, the title is often a pun on the answer. We need to find a word related to Cleopatra's death that sounds like \"The Bays.\"\n\n**Step 3: Connect the Clues to Find the Answer Word**\n\nWe have established the subject is Cleopatra's suicide. The most famous detail of her death is the method. According to legend, she induced an asp (a venomous snake) to bite her.\n\n*   The key action in her death was the snake **bite** (or **bites**, as some accounts might suggest more than one).\n*   The title \"The Bays\" is a pun that sounds very similar to \"The Bites.\"\n*   The plural form of the title (\"Bays\") matches the plural form of the answer (\"Bites\"), which is a plausible interpretation of the event.\n\nTherefore, the answer word to the question \"The Bays\" is **BITES**.\n\n**Step 4: Format the Final Answer**\n\nThe final instruction is to provide the answer \"in alphabetical order.\"\n\n*   The answer word is BITES.\n*   The letters are B, I, T, E, S.\n*   Arranging these letters in alphabetical order gives: B, E, I, S, T.\n\nThe final answer is BEIST.\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   Correctly calculating \"Twice fifteen\" as 30.\n*   Recognizing that \"30\" refers to the year 30 BC, a pivotal year in ancient history.\n*   Knowing or deducing that Cleopatra was considered a \"divine one.\"\n*   Identifying that the title \"The Bays\" is a pun, a key step in solving the riddle.\n*   Making the phonetic connection between \"Bays\" and \"Bites.\"\n*   Remembering the final instruction to arrange the letters of the answer word alphabetically.\n\n<<<BEIST>>>"
