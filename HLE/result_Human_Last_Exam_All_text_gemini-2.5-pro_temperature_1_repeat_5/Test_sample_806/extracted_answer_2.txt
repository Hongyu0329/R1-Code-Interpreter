The specific biochemical reaction that initiated the process was the direct, non-covalent binding of the anticonvulsant drug molecule to the peptide-binding groove of a specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. This created a novel drug-HLA complex that was subsequently recognized by T-cell receptors, triggering a cytotoxic immune cascade.
