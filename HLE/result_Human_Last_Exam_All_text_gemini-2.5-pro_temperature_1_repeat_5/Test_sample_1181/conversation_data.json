    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe core of the question is to identify a specific character in the 1972 movie *Solaris*, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. The identifying detail is a particular sentiment expressed by this character: being \"ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth.\"\n\n**Step 2: List Careful Points**\n*   **Source Specificity:** The question explicitly refers to the 1972 Tarkovsky film, not the original novel by Stanis≈Çaw Lem or the 2002 American remake. Dialogue and character emphasis can vary significantly between these different versions. The analysis must be confined to the 1972 movie.\n*   **Character Profiles:** We need to consider the main characters on the Solaris station and their personalities.\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist. The film begins at his home on Earth, establishing his deep connection to nature. However, the specific line about being \"ashamed\" is key.\n    *   **Hari:** A \"visitor,\" a recreation of Kris's deceased wife. Her experience and memories are not her own; she is a product of the Solaris ocean and Kris's mind. It's highly unlikely she would express a longing for an Earth she never truly knew.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist and one of the two scientists Kris finds on the station. He is philosophical, weary, and often engages in long, introspective monologues about humanity's purpose and limitations in space.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius:** The other scientist. He is a cold, rational, and pragmatic astrobiologist, focused entirely on the scientific problem. He shows disdain for human emotion, making him an unlikely candidate to express such a poetic longing.\n    *   **Gibarian:** A friend of Kris who committed suicide before Kris's arrival. We only see him in a video recording he left behind, which is filled with despair and warnings.\n*   **The specific sentiment:** The key is not just missing the sound of leaves, but being *ashamed* of this feeling. This implies a conflict between the character's grand, scientific mission in space and a simple, profound, and almost \"primitive\" human need for Earth.\n\n**Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer**\n1.  We can eliminate **Hari** (B) because she is not a human from Earth in the same way as the others. Her existence is tied to the station and Kris's memories.\n2.  We can eliminate **Sartorius** (D) because his character is defined by his rejection of sentimentality in favor of cold, hard science. Admitting to such a feeling, let alone being ashamed of it, would be completely out of character.\n3.  **Gibarian** (E) is seen only in a recorded message. While he is in despair, his message is focused on warning Kris about the nature of Solaris. The specific sentiment about rustling leaves is not part of his message.\n4.  This leaves **Kris** (A) and **Snaut** (C). Kris has a strong connection to Earth's nature, as shown in the film's opening and closing scenes. He even brings a small plant to the station. However, the dialogue expressing *shame* about this feeling belongs to another character.\n5.  During a conversation with Kris, **Dr. Snaut** delivers a poignant monologue about the futility and loneliness of their mission. He reflects on how humanity seeks not new worlds but a \"mirror\" of itself. In this context, he confesses his own feelings of homesickness. He tells Kris that, despite their lofty goals, he is sometimes ashamed to admit that he misses simple, earthly things. The specific line is, \"You know... sometimes I'm ashamed of it, but... I so miss... the sound of rustling leaves.\"\n6.  This confession perfectly matches the details of the question. Snaut is the character who feels this shame, viewing his human longing as a weakness or a distraction from their scientific purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe character who is ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves on Earth is Dr. Snaut.\n\n<<<C>>>"
