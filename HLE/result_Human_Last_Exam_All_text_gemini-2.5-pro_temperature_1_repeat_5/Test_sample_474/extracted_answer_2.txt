No, this approach is not valid when considering the ecological function of mimicry. The primary flaw is that the signal receivers in the experiment (humans) have a fundamentally different visual system from the bees' key natural predators (e.g., birds). Birds can perceive ultraviolet (UV) light while humans cannot, and bee coloration often involves UV patterns. Therefore, clusters based on human perception may not reflect the actual mimicry rings that are functional in deterring predators, making the results ecologically invalid.
