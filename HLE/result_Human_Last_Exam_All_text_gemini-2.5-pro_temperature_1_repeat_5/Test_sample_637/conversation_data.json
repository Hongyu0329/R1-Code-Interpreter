    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to design the observer.\n\n**1. Problem Formulation**\n\nWe are given a discrete-time system:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) + Bu(k)\ny(k) = Cx(k)\n\nwith matrices:\nA = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\nB = [0; 1; -1; 1]\nC = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\nThe goal is to design an observer of the form:\nx_hat(k + 1) = Ax_hat(k) + Bu(k) + L(y(k) - y_hat(k))\nwhere y_hat(k) = Cx_hat(k).\n\nWe want the observation error, e(k) = x(k) - x_hat(k), to become zero in the shortest possible number of steps. This is a deadbeat observer design problem.\n\n**2. Error Dynamics**\n\nThe dynamics of the observation error are given by:\ne(k + 1) = (A - LC)e(k)\n\nFor the error to be identically zero after a finite number of steps for any initial error e(0), the matrix `A_o = A - LC` must be nilpotent, meaning `(A - LC)^m = 0` for some integer `m`. The shortest possible number of steps is `v`, the observability index of the system. This requires `(A - LC)^v = 0`.\n\n**3. Determine the Observability Index (v)**\n\nThe observability index `v` is the smallest integer such that the rank of the observability matrix `O_v = [C; CA; ...; CA^(v-1)]` is equal to the state dimension, n=4.\n\n*   **Matrices:**\n    A = [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1]\n    C = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1]\n\n*   **Rank of O1 = C:**\n    The rows of C, [1 0 0 0] and [1 0 0 1], are linearly independent. So, `rank(C) = 2`. Since `2 < 4`, `v > 1`.\n\n*   **Rank of O2 = [C; CA]:**\n    First, compute `CA`:\n    CA = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]\n    `O_2` = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0]\n    The second column of `O_2` is all zeros, so its rank is at most 3. By checking the other columns, we can find that `rank(O_2) = 3`. Since `3 < 4`, `v > 2`.\n\n*   **Rank of O3 = [C; CA; CA^2]:**\n    First, compute `CA^2`:\n    `CA^2` = CA * A = [-1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0] * [-1 0 0 1; 1 0 0 2; 0 1 0 -1; -1 0 1 -1] = [0 0 1 -2; 2 1 0 -3]\n    The matrix `O_3` is a 6x4 matrix containing the rows of `C`, `CA`, and `CA^2`. We need to check if we can find 4 linearly independent rows. Let's select the following rows:\n    r1 = C(1,:) = [1 0 0 0]\n    r2 = C(2,:) = [1 0 0 1]\n    r4 = CA(2,:) = [-2 0 1 0]\n    r6 = `CA^2`(2,:) = [2 1 0 -3]\n    Let's form a matrix M with these rows and find its determinant:\n    M = [1 0 0 0; 1 0 0 1; -2 0 1 0; 2 1 0 -3]\n    `det(M) = 1 * det([0 0 1; 0 1 0; 1 0 -3]) = 1 * (1 * (0 - 1)) = -1`.\n    Since `det(M) != 0`, the rank of M is 4. Thus, `rank(O_3) = 4`.\n\nThe observability index is `v = 3`. This means we need to find an observer gain `L` such that `(A - LC)^3 = 0`.\n\n**4. Observer Gain Design using Duality**\n\nThe problem of finding `L` to place the eigenvalues of `A - LC` is dual to finding a state feedback gain `K` for the system `(A^T, C^T)` to place the eigenvalues of `A^T - C^T K`. We set `L = K^T`.\nOur goal is to find `K` such that the closed-loop matrix `A_c = A^T - C^T K` satisfies `A_c^3 = 0`.\n\n*   **Dual System Matrices:**\n    `A^T` = [-1 1 0 -1; 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 1; 1 2 -1 -1]\n    `C^T` = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1]\n    K is a 2x4 matrix: K = [k11 k12 k13 k14; k21 k22 k23 k24]\n\n*   **Closed-Loop Matrix `A_c`:**\n    `A_c = A^T - C^T K`\n    `C^T K = [1 1; 0 0; 0 0; 0 1] * [k11 k12 k13 k14; k21 k22 k23 k24] = [k11+k21, k12+k22, k13+k23, k14+k24; 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0; k21, k22, k23, k24]`\n    `A_c = [ -1-(k11+k21), 1-(k12+k22), -(k13+k23), -1-(k14+k24); 0, 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 1; 1-k21, 2-k22, -1-k23, -1-k24 ]`\n\n*   **Pole Placement Strategy:**\n    We have 8 unknowns in `K`. We can simplify the problem by choosing `K` to make `A_c` have a simple structure. Let's make the first row of `A_c` all zeros:\n    -1 - (k11+k21) = 0  =>  k11+k21 = -1\n     1 - (k12+k22) = 0  =>  k12+k22 = 1\n         -(k13+k23) = 0  =>  k13+k23 = 0\n    -1 - (k14+k24) = 0  =>  k14+k24 = -1\n\n    With this choice, `A_c` becomes:\n    `A_c` = [0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 1; 1-k21, 2-k22, -1-k23, -1-k24]\n    The characteristic polynomial of this matrix is `det(λI - A_c) = λ^4 + (1+k24)λ^3 + (1+k23)λ^2 + (k22-2)λ`.\n    For deadbeat response, all eigenvalues must be zero, so the characteristic polynomial must be `λ^4`. Setting the coefficients to zero gives:\n    1 + k24 = 0  =>  `k24 = -1`\n    1 + k23 = 0  =>  `k23 = -1`\n    k22 - 2 = 0  =>  `k22 = 2`\n\n*   **Imposing the Nilpotency Condition `A_c^3 = 0`:**\n    Substituting these values back into `A_c`:\n    `A_c` = [0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1, 0; 0, 0, 0, 1; 1-k21, 0, 0, 0]\n    Now we compute powers of `A_c`:\n    `A_c^2` = `A_c` * `A_c` = [0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 1; 1-k21, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    `A_c^3` = `A_c^2` * `A_c` = [0, 0, 0, 0; 1-k21, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    For `A_c^3` to be the zero matrix, we must have:\n    1 - k21 = 0  =>  `k21 = 1`\n\n*   **Final Gain Calculation:**\n    We now have the second row of K: `K_row2 = [1, 2, -1, -1]`.\n    We can find the first row using the equations from our simplifying assumption:\n    k11 = -1 - k21 = -1 - 1 = -2\n    k12 = 1 - k22 = 1 - 2 = -1\n    k13 = 0 - k23 = 0 - (-1) = 1\n    k14 = -1 - k24 = -1 - (-1) = 0\n    So, the first row of K is `K_row1 = [-2, -1, 1, 0]`.\n\n    The complete feedback gain matrix `K` is:\n    K = [-2 -1 1 0; 1 2 -1 -1]\n\n    The observer gain `L` is the transpose of `K`:\n    L = K^T = [-2 1; -1 2; 1 -1; 0 -1]\n\n**5. Final Answer**\n\nThe observer gain matrix `L` that makes the observation error zero in the shortest possible time (3 steps) is:\n\n<<<[[-2, 1], [-1, 2], [1, -1], [0, -1]]>>>"
