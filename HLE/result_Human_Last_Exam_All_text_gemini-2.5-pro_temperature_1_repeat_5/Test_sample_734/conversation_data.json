    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks to identify a specific Christian theologian based on four key criteria:\n1.  **Who:** The person must be a Christian theologian.\n2.  **What:** They must have \"developed specialized terminology.\" This implies a systematic and unique set of concepts or phrases, not just a general discussion.\n3.  **Why:** The terminology is used \"to describe changes in the laws of nature.\" This involves God's ability to act outside of, or to alter, the regular, observable patterns of the physical world.\n4.  **Application:** This terminology must be applicable to two distinct scenarios:\n    *   The virgin birth of Jesus (a specific, singular miracle that suspends a biological law).\n    *   Possible alterations in natural laws at the Fall (a potential systemic, historical change in how the natural world functions, e.g., the introduction of death and decay).\n\nThe word \"first\" is crucial, indicating we are looking for the originator of this line of thought within Christian theology.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate Potential Candidates**\n\n*   **Early Church Fathers (before Augustine):** While many Church Fathers wrote about miracles and the Fall, they generally did not develop a systematic, philosophical terminology to explain the *mechanics* of how these events relate to the laws of nature. Their focus was more pastoral and exegetical.\n\n*   **Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD):** This is a very strong candidate. Augustine was one of the first to systematically wrestle with the relationship between God's will, creation's order, and miracles.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** He developed and used specific Latin phrases to make his case. He spoke of the **`ordo naturae`** (the order of nature) or **`cursus naturae`** (the course of nature) to refer to the established laws and patterns we observe. He described a miracle not as something \"unnatural\" in an absolute sense, but as an event **`contra cursum naturae`** (against the course of nature).\n    *   **Applicability to the Virgin Birth:** Augustine argued that the virgin birth was `contra cursum naturae` with respect to human generation, but it was not contrary to God's higher will and power, which is the ultimate \"law\" of all things.\n    *   **Applicability to the Fall:** Augustine extensively taught that the Fall had profound consequences for nature. He argued that human mortality, pain in childbirth, and the toil of labor were penalties that altered the original, pre-Fall state of humanity and its relationship with the natural world. His framework allowed for this systemic shift in the `ordo naturae` as a consequence of sin.\n    *   **\"First\":** Augustine's work on this topic was foundational for all subsequent Western theology.\n\n*   **Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274 AD):** Another very strong candidate, but he comes much later than Augustine.\n    *   **Specialized Terminology:** Aquinas, building on Augustine and Aristotle, developed the highly specialized distinction between God's **`potentia ordinata`** (ordained power—how God chooses to work through the established laws of nature) and His **`potentia absoluta`** (absolute power—what God can do in principle, i.e., anything not logically self-contradictory).\n    *   **Applicability:** This framework perfectly describes the phenomena. The virgin birth is an act of God's `potentia absoluta` overriding the `potentia ordinata`. The changes at the Fall could be seen as God instituting a new `potentia ordinata`.\n    *   **\"First\":** Aquinas was not the first. His work is a brilliant refinement and systematization of concepts whose foundations were laid by Augustine eight centuries earlier.\n\n*   **The Protestant Reformers (e.g., Calvin, Luther):** While they affirmed God's sovereignty over nature and His ability to perform miracles, their primary focus was not on developing a new philosophical terminology for it. They largely worked within the theological traditions inherited from Augustine and the scholastics.\n\n**Step 3: Synthesize and Conclude**\n\nThe question asks who *first* developed the specialized terminology. While Thomas Aquinas provided a very precise and famous set of terms (`potentia ordinata`/`absoluta`), Augustine of Hippo was the one who originally laid the conceptual and terminological groundwork. He was the first to create a robust system for understanding miracles and changes to the natural order in relation to God's will, using specific phrases like `ordo naturae` and `contra cursum naturae`. His thought was pioneering and directly addressed how both a singular event like the virgin birth and a systemic change like the Fall could be understood within a Christian framework of natural law. Therefore, Augustine is the correct answer.\n\n<<<Augustine of Hippo>>>"
