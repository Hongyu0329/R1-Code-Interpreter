    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the Goal and Method:** The objective is to find the scaling exponent $\\alpha$ for the specific heat in a system with spatial dimension $d=3$. The specified method is the epsilon ($\\epsilon$) expansion, which is a key technique in the renormalization group (RG) theory of critical phenomena.\n\n2.  **Understand the Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) Expansion:**\n    *   The $\\epsilon$-expansion is a perturbative calculation performed in a dimension $d$ that is slightly below the *upper critical dimension*, $d_c$.\n    *   The expansion parameter is defined as $\\epsilon = d_c - d$.\n    *   For the class of models describing typical continuous phase transitions (known as the O(n) models or $\\phi^4$ theory), the upper critical dimension is $d_c = 4$.\n    *   Since we are interested in $d=3$, the value of the expansion parameter is $\\epsilon = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\n3.  **State the Relevant Scaling Relation:** Critical exponents are interconnected through scaling relations. A fundamental one, known as the hyperscaling or Josephson's identity, relates the specific heat exponent $\\alpha$ to the correlation length exponent $\\nu$ and the spatial dimension $d$:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\nu d$\n\n4.  **Recall the $\\epsilon$-Expansion for the Exponent $\\nu$:** To use the scaling relation, we first need the expression for $\\nu$ as a series in $\\epsilon$. The exponent $\\alpha$ depends on the symmetry of the system's order parameter, characterized by its number of components, $n$. The general one-loop result for $\\nu$ in the O(n) model is:\n    $\\nu = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n5.  **Acknowledge Ambiguity and Make a Standard Assumption:** The question does not specify the system's symmetry (the value of $n$).\n    *   **Careful Point:** The value of $\\alpha$ depends on $n$.\n    *   To provide a single numerical answer, we must assume a specific universality class. The most common and fundamental case studied is the Ising model, which has a scalar order parameter, corresponding to $n=1$. We will proceed with this standard assumption.\n\n6.  **Derive the Expression for $\\alpha$ in the $\\epsilon$-Expansion:** We substitute the expressions for $\\nu$ and $d=4-\\epsilon$ into the hyperscaling relation:\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2) \\right) (4 - \\epsilon)$\n    We expand this and keep terms only up to the first order in $\\epsilon$, as this is the standard leading-order calculation.\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(4) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\epsilon + \\left(\\frac{n+2}{4(n+8)}\\epsilon\\right)(4) \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = 2 - \\left[ 2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\epsilon + \\frac{n+2}{n+8}\\epsilon \\right] + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    Simplifying the terms inside the brackets:\n    $\\alpha = - \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{n+2}{n+8} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    Finding a common denominator:\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2(n+2)}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    $\\alpha = \\left( \\frac{n+8 - 2n - 4}{2(n+8)} \\right)\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n    This gives the general first-order formula for $\\alpha$:\n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-n}{2(n+8)}\\epsilon + O(\\epsilon^2)$\n\n7.  **Calculate the Final Answer:** Now, we insert the specific values for our problem into this formula:\n    *   $n=1$ (Ising model assumption)\n    *   $\\epsilon=1$ (for $d=3$)\n    \n    $\\alpha = \\frac{4-1}{2(1+8)} \\times 1 = \\frac{3}{2 \\times 9} = \\frac{3}{18}$\n    \n    $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{6}$\n\nThis value represents the first-order approximation from the $\\epsilon$-expansion. While higher-order corrections exist, this is the standard textbook answer for a one-loop calculation.\n\n<<<1/6>>>"
