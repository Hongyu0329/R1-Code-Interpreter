    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk on-screen.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Luxor Obelisks and their locations.**\nThere are two famous Luxor Obelisks.\n1.  One stands at the entrance to the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt.\n2.  The other, its twin, was gifted to France in the 19th century and now stands in the center of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.\nA film depicting either of these locations would satisfy the question's criteria.\n\n**Step 2: Create a chronological list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners and analyze their settings.**\nWe must examine the winners in order, starting from the first ceremony, to find the earliest film that features a scene in either Paris's Place de la Concorde or Luxor, Egypt.\n\n*   **1st-9th Academy Awards (1928-1936):**\n    *   *Wings* (1928): Set in World War I France, but focuses on battlefields and air combat, not Parisian landmarks.\n    *   *The Broadway Melody* (1929): New York City.\n    *   *All Quiet on the Western Front* (1930): German front lines in WWI.\n    *   *Cimarron* (1931): Oklahoma, USA.\n    *   *Grand Hotel* (1932): Berlin, Germany.\n    *   *Cavalcade* (1933): London, UK.\n    *   *It Happened One Night* (1934): Eastern USA.\n    *   *Mutiny on the Bounty* (1935): South Pacific and England.\n    *   *The Great Ziegfeld* (1936): New York City.\n    None of these early winners have settings in Paris or Luxor.\n\n*   **10th Academy Awards (1937): *The Life of Emile Zola***\n    *   **Analysis:** This film is a biographical drama about the famous French writer Ã‰mile Zola. The majority of the film is set in Paris during the late 19th century. To establish the setting and convey the passage of time, the film uses shots and montages of iconic Parisian locations.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The Place de la Concorde is one of Paris's most famous and historically significant public squares. The Luxor Obelisk is its centerpiece.\n    *   **Conclusion:** *The Life of Emile Zola* includes establishing shots of Paris that depict the Place de la Concorde, including the obelisk. As no prior Best Picture winner was set in a location featuring a Luxor Obelisk, this is the first.\n\n*   **Subsequent Winners (For Confirmation):**\n    *   ***An American in Paris* (1951):** This film is famously set in Paris and its climactic ballet sequence features a large set piece representing the Place de la Concorde, with the obelisk clearly visible. However, this was 14 years after *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n    *   ***Around the World in 80 Days* (1956):** This film includes a segment in Egypt. While it shows the travels of Phileas Fogg, it is not the first winner to show a Luxor Obelisk, as *The Life of Emile Zola* precedes it.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nBy analyzing the Best Picture winners chronologically, the first film to feature a Luxor Obelisk (the one in Paris's Place de la Concorde) is *The Life of Emile Zola*.\n\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
