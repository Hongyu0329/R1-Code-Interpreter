    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Configuration State Functions (CSFs) for the requested calculation.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the System\nFirst, we need to understand the components of the calculation.\n*   **Molecule:** $\\mathrm{CH}_2 \\mathrm{SiHF}$\n*   **Method:** Full Configuration Interaction (Full CI)\n*   **Basis Set:** 6-31G**\n\nA Full CI calculation considers all possible electronic configurations, and the number of CSFs depends on the total number of electrons and the total number of spatial orbitals (which is determined by the basis set).\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Electrons ($N_{elec}$)\nWe sum the electrons for each atom in the neutral molecule using their atomic numbers.\n*   Carbon (C): 1 atom × 6 electrons/atom = 6 electrons\n*   Hydrogen (H): 3 atoms × 1 electron/atom = 3 electrons\n*   Silicon (Si): 1 atom × 14 electrons/atom = 14 electrons\n*   Fluorine (F): 1 atom × 9 electrons/atom = 9 electrons\n\nTotal electrons $N_{elec} = 6 + 3 + 14 + 9 = 32$.\nSince this is an even number of electrons, the ground state is a singlet state with total spin $S=0$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Basis Functions (Spatial Orbitals, $K$)\nWe need to determine the number of basis functions contributed by each atom for the 6-31G** basis set. The `**` notation (also written as `(d,p)`) means that d-type polarization functions are added to heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms and p-type polarization functions are added to hydrogen atoms. Standard quantum chemistry programs use 6 Cartesian d-functions (d$_{xx}$, d$_{yy}$, d$_{zz}$, d$_{xy}$, d$_{xz}$, d$_{yz}$) and 3 Cartesian p-functions (p$_x$, p$_y$, p$_z$) for this basis.\n\n*   **Hydrogen (H):**\n    *   The 1s orbital is described by 2 basis functions (a split-valence `31` part).\n    *   The `**` adds one set of p-functions (3 functions).\n    *   Total for one H atom = 2 + 3 = 5 basis functions.\n    *   For 3 H atoms: 3 × 5 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Carbon (C, a 2nd-period atom):**\n    *   Core (1s): 1 basis function.\n    *   Valence (2s, 2p): Split into two sets (`31`).\n        *   Inner set (2s', 2p'): 1s + 3p = 4 functions.\n        *   Outer set (2s'', 2p''): 1s + 3p = 4 functions.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of d-functions (6 functions).\n    *   Total for C atom = 1 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Fluorine (F, a 2nd-period atom):**\n    *   Same structure as Carbon.\n    *   Total for F atom = 15 basis functions.\n\n*   **Silicon (Si, a 3rd-period atom):**\n    *   Core (1s, 2s, 2p): 1(1s) + 1(2s) + 3(2p) = 5 basis functions.\n    *   Valence (3s, 3p): Split into two sets (`31`).\n        *   Inner set (3s', 3p'): 1s + 3p = 4 functions.\n        *   Outer set (3s'', 3p''): 1s + 3p = 4 functions.\n    *   The `**` adds one set of d-functions (6 functions).\n    *   Total for Si atom = 5 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 19 basis functions.\n\n*   **Total Number of Orbitals ($K$):**\n    *   $K = (\\text{functions for 3 H}) + (\\text{for 1 C}) + (\\text{for 1 F}) + (\\text{for 1 Si})$\n    *   $K = 15 + 15 + 15 + 19 = 64$ spatial orbitals.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Singlet CSFs\nThe number of CSFs for a system with $K$ spatial orbitals, $N_{elec}$ electrons, and a total spin quantum number $S$ is given by the Weyl-Pethick formula:\n$N_{CSF}(K, N_{elec}, S) = \\frac{2S+1}{K+1} \\binom{K+1}{N_{elec}/2-S} \\binom{K+1}{N_{elec}/2+S+1}$\n\nFor our system, we have $K=64$, $N_{elec}=32$, and we are calculating for the singlet state ($S=0$).\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$N_{CSF}(64, 32, 0) = \\frac{2(0)+1}{64+1} \\binom{64+1}{32/2-0} \\binom{64+1}{32/2+0+1}$\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\binom{65}{16} \\binom{65}{17}$\n\n### Step 5: Compute the Final Value\nNow we compute the value using the binomial coefficients.\n*   $\\binom{65}{16} = \\frac{65!}{16! \\cdot 49!} = 2,035,775,471,018,883,750$\n*   $\\binom{65}{17} = \\frac{65!}{17! \\cdot 48!} = 9,580,119,863,618,275,000$\n\nNow, we perform the multiplication and division:\n$N_{CSF} = \\frac{1}{65} \\times (2,035,775,471,018,883,750) \\times (9,580,119,863,618,275,000)$\n\nWe can simplify the calculation by noticing that $\\binom{65}{16}$ is divisible by 65.\n$\\frac{\\binom{65}{16}}{65} = \\frac{2,035,775,471,018,883,750}{65} = 31,319,622,631,059,750$\n\nFinally, we multiply this result by $\\binom{65}{17}$:\n$N_{CSF} = (31,319,622,631,059,750) \\times (9,580,119,863,618,275,000)$\n$N_{CSF} = 299,994,769,334,391,379,183,103,731,250,000$\n\nThis can be written in scientific notation as approximately $3.00 \\times 10^{32}$.\n\n<<<299994769334391379183103731250000>>>"
