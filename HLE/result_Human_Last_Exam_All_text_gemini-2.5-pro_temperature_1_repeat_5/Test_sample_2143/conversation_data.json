    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the full name of the person in question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Analyze the Core Subject:** The question describes an interpretation by \"Veronika Campan\" of a specific text or \"work.\" The central figure of the question is \"HE,\" the author or deliverer of this work.\n\n2.  **Identify Veronika Campan and Her Work:** A search for \"Veronika Campan\" reveals she is a scholar in the field of semiotics, particularly the semiotics of law. She has famously written about the structure of the Decalogue, also known as the Ten Commandments. This immediately points us to the Ten Commandments as the \"work\" in question.\n\n3.  **Identify \"HIS work\" and \"HE\":** If the \"work\" is the Ten Commandments, then \"HE\" is the person traditionally credited with receiving and delivering these laws to the people. In the biblical narrative of the Old Testament (specifically in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy), this person is the prophet Moses. He received the commandments from God on Mount Sinai.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Clue: \"at the end of HIS work, HE separately addressed the issue of another's material possessions.\"** The Ten Commandments are a list. The commandments at the end of the list are about coveting. Depending on the religious tradition, the Tenth Commandment (or the Ninth and Tenth) reads: \"You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.\" This directly deals with the desire for \"another's material possessions\" (house, servant, ox, donkey) and is located at the very end of the list.\n\n5.  **Analyze the Clue: \"HE did this by naturally ignoring the prohibition against representation.\"** This is the most complex part of the puzzle and confirms the subject matter.\n    *   The \"prohibition against representation\" is a direct reference to the Second Commandment: \"You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.\" This is a ban on creating *physical representations* for worship.\n    *   The final commandment against coveting deals with an internal state: desire. To covet something (like a neighbor's house), one must first form a *mental representation* or image of it.\n    *   Veronika Campan's semiotic interpretation argues that the Decalogue's structure moves from the relationship with God (including the ban on physical images) to actions between people (murder, theft) and finally, to the internal world of thought (coveting).\n    *   By forbidding the act of coveting, the lawgiver (Moses) is legislating on a mental act that *requires* mental representation. In doing so, he moves into a different domain from the earlier prohibition on *physical* representation. This is what is meant by \"naturally ignoring\" the prohibitionâ€”the focus shifts from the physical world to the mental world, where representation is an inescapable part of the forbidden thought process itself.\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** All clues converge on a single figure. The work is the Ten Commandments. The final commandments deal with coveting material possessions. The interpretation involves a shift from the prohibition of physical representation (idols) to the regulation of mental representation (desire). The lawgiver credited with delivering this work is Moses.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   The question relies on a specific academic interpretation (Campan's semiotics), which is key to unlocking the meaning.\n*   The identity of \"HE\" is based on the traditional biblical account of the authorship/delivery of the Decalogue.\n*   The phrase \"naturally ignoring\" is nuanced. It does not mean contradicting or violating the earlier rule, but rather shifting the legal focus to a different realm (the mind) where the nature of representation is different.\n*   The \"full name\" is simply the name by which the historical/biblical figure is known.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n1.  The subject is the Ten Commandments.\n2.  The person who delivered the Ten Commandments according to the Hebrew Bible is Moses.\n3.  The analysis of Veronika Campan's interpretation of the commandments' structure confirms this context.\n4.  Therefore, \"HE\" is Moses.\n\n<<<Moses>>>"
