    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the problem mathematically.**\nLet $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials of degree 3.\nLet $h(x) = f(g(x))$. We are looking for the maximum number of solutions to the equation $h(x) = x$, which represents the fixed points of the function $h(x)$.\nLet $H(x) = h(x) - x = f(g(x)) - x$. The number of fixed points is the number of real roots of the polynomial equation $H(x) = 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the degree of the polynomial H(x).**\nSince $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3 and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3, their composition $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $3 \\times 3 = 9$.\nThe polynomial $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$ is also of degree 9, as the $-x$ term does not change the highest power.\nBy the fundamental theorem of algebra, a polynomial of degree $n$ can have at most $n$ real roots. Therefore, $H(x)$ can have at most 9 real roots. This means the maximum number of fixed points is at most 9.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the constraints on f(x) and g(x).**\nThe problem states that $f'(x) > 0$ and $g'(x) > 0$ for all real numbers $x$.\nLet $f(x) = a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$ with $a_3 \\neq 0$.\nThen $f'(x) = 3a_3x^2 + 2a_2x + a_1$. For this quadratic to be always positive, its graph (a parabola) must open upwards and never cross the x-axis. This requires:\n1.  The leading coefficient must be positive: $3a_3 > 0 \\implies a_3 > 0$.\n2.  The discriminant must be negative: $(2a_2)^2 - 4(3a_3)(a_1) < 0 \\implies 4a_2^2 - 12a_1a_3 < 0 \\implies a_2^2 < 3a_1a_3$.\nSimilarly, for $g(x) = b_3x^3 + b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0$, we must have $b_3 > 0$ and $b_2^2 < 3b_1b_3$.\nThe condition $f'(x)>0$ implies that $f(x)$ is a strictly increasing function. Similarly, $g(x)$ is also strictly increasing.\n\n**Step 4: Use calculus to analyze the number of roots of H(x).**\nThe number of roots of a differentiable function $H(x)$ is related to the number of roots of its derivative $H'(x)$. By Rolle's Theorem, between any two roots of $H(x)$, there must be at least one root of $H'(x)$. This implies that the number of roots of $H(x)$ is at most one more than the number of roots of $H'(x)$.\nLet's find the derivative of $H(x)$:\n$H'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(f(g(x)) - x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) - 1$.\nThe number of fixed points is at most $1 + (\\text{number of roots of } H'(x)=0)$.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the equation H'(x) = 0.**\nThe equation $H'(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) = 1$.\nLet's determine the degree of the polynomial $Q(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$.\n*   $g'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 3.\n*   $f'(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 2.\n*   $f'(g(x))$ is a composition of a degree 2 polynomial and a degree 3 polynomial, so its degree is $2 \\times 3 = 6$.\n*   Therefore, the degree of $Q(x) = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$ is $\\deg(f'(g(x))) + \\deg(g'(x)) = 6 + 2 = 8$.\n\nThe equation $H'(x) = 0$ is equivalent to $Q(x) - 1 = 0$. This is a polynomial equation of degree 8. It can have at most 8 real roots.\nSince $H'(x)$ can have at most 8 roots, $H(x)$ can have at most $8 + 1 = 9$ roots.\n\n**Step 6: Verify that the maximum of 9 is achievable.**\nBoth methods (analyzing the degree of $H(x)$ and using Rolle's theorem) lead to the same upper bound of 9. Now we must argue that this maximum can be achieved for some choice of $f$ and $g$ that satisfy the given conditions.\nTo have 9 distinct real roots for $H(x) = f(g(x)) - x$, the function $H(x)$ must have 8 distinct local extrema (4 local maxima and 4 local minima). This requires its derivative, $H'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) - 1$, to have 8 distinct real roots.\nThis means the graph of the polynomial $Q(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x)$ must intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points.\n*   $Q(x)$ is a polynomial of degree 8. Its leading coefficient is the product of the leading coefficients of $f'(g(x))$ and $g'(x)$.\n    *   Leading term of $g(x)$ is $b_3x^3$.\n    *   Leading term of $f'(y)$ is $3a_3y^2$.\n    *   Leading term of $f'(g(x))$ is $3a_3(b_3x^3)^2 = 3a_3b_3^2x^6$.\n    *   Leading term of $g'(x)$ is $3b_3x^2$.\n    *   Leading term of $Q(x)$ is $(3a_3b_3^2x^6)(3b_3x^2) = 9a_3b_3^3x^8$.\n*   Since $a_3>0$ and $b_3>0$, the leading coefficient $9a_3b_3^3$ is positive.\n*   A polynomial of degree 8 with a positive leading coefficient has $\\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} Q(x) = +\\infty$.\n*   For such a function to intersect the line $y=1$ at 8 distinct points, it must have 4 local minima with values less than 1, and 3 local maxima with values greater than 1. This requires $Q(x)$ to have $4+3=7$ distinct local extrema.\n*   The local extrema of $Q(x)$ occur at the roots of its derivative, $Q'(x)$. $Q'(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $8-1=7$. A polynomial of degree 7 can indeed have 7 distinct real roots.\n*   While finding explicit polynomials $f$ and $g$ is complex, it is possible to construct them. One can choose the coefficients of $f$ and $g$ to control the shape of $Q(x)$. By placing the minima of $f'(y)$ and $g'(x)$ and tuning their minimal values, one can introduce enough \"wiggles\" into $Q(x)$ to create 7 local extrema. By further adjusting the coefficients, one can ensure the values at these extrema interleave the value 1, thus generating 8 roots for $Q(x)=1$. This, in turn, generates 9 fixed points for $f(g(x))$.\n\nSince the maximum possible number of roots is 9 and it is plausible that this number can be achieved under the given conditions, we conclude that the maximum number of fixed points is 9."
