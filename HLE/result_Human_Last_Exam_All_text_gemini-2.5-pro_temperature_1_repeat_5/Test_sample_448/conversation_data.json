    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Noble Gases**\nThe noble gases are the elements in Group 18 of the periodic table. The naturally occurring noble gases on Earth are:\n*   Helium (He)\n*   Neon (Ne)\n*   Argon (Ar)\n*   Krypton (Kr)\n*   Xenon (Xe)\n*   Radon (Rn)\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Metric for Rarity**\nThe question asks for the \"rarest\" noble gas \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter.\" This means we need to find which noble gas has the lowest total mass relative to the mass of the entire Earth (crust, mantle, core, oceans, atmosphere). Since the vast majority of noble gases are found in the atmosphere, their atmospheric concentration is an excellent proxy for their overall rarity. The specific year, 2002, is not significant for this question, as the abundances of these gases are stable over human timescales.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Abundances of the Stable Noble Gases**\nLet's first look at the atmospheric abundances of the stable (non-radioactive) noble gases, typically measured in parts per million (ppm) by volume.\n*   **Argon (Ar):** ~9,340 ppm. It is the most abundant noble gas.\n*   **Neon (Ne):** ~18.18 ppm.\n*   **Helium (He):** ~5.24 ppm.\n*   **Krypton (Kr):** ~1.14 ppm.\n*   **Xenon (Xe):** ~0.087 ppm.\n\nFrom this list of stable noble gases, Xenon (Xe) is the rarest.\n\n**Step 4: Consider Radon (Rn)**\nRadon must also be considered as it is a naturally occurring noble gas.\n*   **Key Property:** Radon is radioactive. Its most stable isotope, Radon-222, has a half-life of only 3.8 days.\n*   **Source and Abundance:** Radon is continuously formed from the radioactive decay of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust. Because it decays so quickly, it never accumulates in significant quantities. Its concentration in the atmosphere is highly variable but extremely low. A typical atmospheric abundance is on the order of 1 part in 10^21 by volume. This is vastly smaller than Xenon's 87 parts per trillion (0.087 ppm).\n*   **Total Mass:** The total amount of Radon in the entire atmosphere at any given moment is estimated to be only a few thousand kilograms. The total amount in the Earth's crust is even smaller, estimated at just tens of grams. In contrast, the mass of Xenon in the atmosphere is trillions of kilograms.\n\n**Step 5: Final Conclusion**\nComparing all naturally occurring noble gases, Radon's abundance is many orders of magnitude lower than Xenon's. Therefore, Radon is the rarest noble gas on Earth.\n\n*   **Careful Point 1:** The question does not specify \"stable\" noble gas, so radioactive Radon must be included in the analysis.\n*   **Careful Point 2:** The phrasing \"as a percentage of all terrestrial matter\" solidifies the answer. While most noble gases are in the atmosphere, Radon is also found in the crust and water. However, its total mass across all these reservoirs is minuscule due to its short half-life, making it definitively the rarest.\n*   **Careful Point 3:** The year 2002 is a distractor; the relative abundances of these elements do not change on such a short timescale.\n\nBased on this analysis, the rarest noble gas on Earth is Radon.\n\n<<<Radon>>>"
