    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of Triple Crown winners in MLB baseball.\n\n### Step 1: Define the \"Triple Crown\"\nFirst, it is crucial to understand what a \"Triple Crown\" is in baseball. The term can refer to two different, prestigious achievements: one for batters and one for pitchers.\n\n*   **Batting Triple Crown:** A batter wins the Triple Crown by leading their respective league (American League or National League) in three key offensive categories in a single season:\n    1.  Batting Average (BA)\n    2.  Home Runs (HR)\n    3.  Runs Batted In (RBI)\n\n*   **Pitching Triple Crown:** A pitcher wins the Triple Crown by leading their league in three key pitching categories in a single season:\n    1.  Wins (W)\n    2.  Strikeouts (K)\n    3.  Earned Run Average (ERA)\n\n**Careful Point:** When the term \"Triple Crown\" is used without specifying \"batting\" or \"pitching,\" it almost universally refers to the **batting Triple Crown**, as it is considered one of the rarest and most difficult feats for a position player. Our primary analysis will focus on this achievement.\n\n### Step 2: List All Batting Triple Crown Winners in MLB History\nNext, we will compile a list of every player who has won the batting Triple Crown, noting the year and their league.\n\n1.  **Paul Hines** (1878, National League)\n2.  **Tip O'Neill** (1887, American Association*)\n3.  **Hugh Duffy** (1894, National League)\n4.  **Nap Lajoie** (1901, American League)\n5.  **Ty Cobb** (1909, American League)\n6.  **Heinie Zimmerman** (1912, National League)\n7.  **Rogers Hornsby** (1922 & 1925, National League)\n8.  **Chuck Klein** (1933, National League)\n9.  **Jimmie Foxx** (1933, American League)\n10. **Lou Gehrig** (1934, American League)\n11. **Joe Medwick** (1937, National League)\n12. **Ted Williams** (1942 & 1947, American League)\n13. **Mickey Mantle** (1956, American League)\n14. **Frank Robinson** (1966, American League)\n15. **Carl Yastrzemski** (1967, American League)\n16. **Miguel Cabrera** (2012, American League)\n\n*The American Association (AA) is recognized by MLB as a major league during its existence (1882-1891).\n\n### Step 3: Count the Unique Winners\nThe question asks \"how many... winners are there,\" which means we need to count the number of unique players who have achieved this feat, not the total number of times it has been won.\n\n*   **Careful Point:** Rogers Hornsby and Ted Williams each won the Triple Crown twice. However, they are counted as single winners in our list of unique players.\n\nCounting the unique names from the list in Step 2:\n1.  Paul Hines\n2.  Tip O'Neill\n3.  Hugh Duffy\n4.  Nap Lajoie\n5.  Ty Cobb\n6.  Heinie Zimmerman\n7.  Rogers Hornsby\n8.  Chuck Klein\n9.  Jimmie Foxx\n10. Lou Gehrig\n11. Joe Medwick\n12. Ted Williams\n13. Mickey Mantle\n14. Frank Robinson\n15. Carl Yastrzemski\n16. Miguel Cabrera\n\nThere are **16** individual players who have won the batting Triple Crown.\n\n### Step 4: A Note on the Pitching Triple Crown (for completeness)\nWhile the primary answer is 16, it is useful to know the number for the pitching Triple Crown as well. This achievement is more common than the batting Triple Crown. As of the end of the 2023 season, **26** different pitchers have won the pitching Triple Crown a total of 39 times. Famous winners include Sandy Koufax, Walter Johnson, Clayton Kershaw, and Justin Verlander.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the standard interpretation of the question, the final answer is the number of unique batting Triple Crown winners.\n\n*   The analysis identified every player to win the batting Triple Crown.\n*   The list was carefully vetted to include players from all recognized major leagues and to account for multi-time winners.\n*   The final count of unique players is 16.\n\n<<<16>>>"
