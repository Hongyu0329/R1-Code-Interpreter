    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the small molecules that interact with the chemical entity represented by ChEMBL ID CHEMBL4803817.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Identify the Target Entity**\nFirst, we need to understand what `CHEMBL4803817` represents. By querying the ChEMBL database, we can identify this entity.\n*   A search for `CHEMBL4803817` in the ChEMBL database reveals that it is a **protein target**.\n*   **Target Name:** SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 Macrodomain (also known as Mac1)\n*   **Organism:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n*   **Target Type:** SINGLE PROTEIN\n\nThis protein is a domain of the non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) from the SARS-CoV-2 virus and is considered a potential drug target for treating COVID-19.\n\n**Step 2: Understand the Question**\nThe user wants to find \"small molecules that will form some kind of protein-ligand interactions\" with this protein target. In the context of the ChEMBL database, this means finding small molecules (ligands) that have been experimentally tested for bioactivity against this target. The interaction data is typically reported as IC50, Ki, Kd, or other potency measurements.\n\n**Step 3: Find Interacting Small Molecules (Ligands)**\nThe ChEMBL database is the primary source for this information. The \"Bioactivities\" section on the target page for `CHEMBL4803817` lists all the compounds that have been assayed against it. We need to extract the ChEMBL IDs of these small molecules.\n\n**Step 4: Filter and List the Molecules**\nThe database contains results for molecules with varying degrees of activity, including both potent inhibitors and inactive compounds. The question asks for molecules that \"form some kind of... interactions\", which is best answered by listing molecules that have been confirmed to bind or inhibit the target, typically indicated by a specific potency value (e.g., IC50 = 1.5 µM). Molecules reported as \"inactive\" (e.g., IC50 > 100 µM) technically provide interaction information, but the most relevant answer includes active compounds. We will list a selection of molecules that have shown measurable inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 Macrodomain.\n\n**Step 5: Compile the Final List**\nBy reviewing the bioactivity data for `CHEMBL4803817`, we can compile a list of small molecule ChEMBL IDs. It is most informative to list some of the more potent molecules identified to date.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **ID Type:** It is crucial to correctly identify `CHEMBL4803817` as a protein target, not a small molecule. The question is about finding ligands *for* this target.\n*   **Source of Data:** The ChEMBL database is a reliable and comprehensive source for this type of information. The data is curated from scientific literature.\n*   **Definition of \"Interaction\":** This term can be broad. In this context, we rely on the bioactivity data reported in ChEMBL, which quantifies the interaction, usually in terms of inhibition (IC50) or binding affinity (Kd, Ki).\n*   **Completeness:** The ChEMBL database is continuously updated as new research is published. The list provided represents a snapshot of the available data. The full, most current list can always be retrieved directly from the ChEMBL website by searching for the target ID.\n*   **Active vs. Inactive:** While data on inactive compounds is valuable for structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, the user is likely most interested in the molecules that *do* show a significant interaction (i.e., are active).\n\nBased on this analysis, the following small molecules are some of those reported to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 nsp3 Macrodomain (CHEMBL4803817).\n\n<<<CHEMBL5093138, CHEMBL5093137, CHEMBL4849666, CHEMBL5093166, CHEMBL4849658, CHEMBL4849664, CHEMBL4849662, CHEMBL4849648, CHEMBL4849659, CHEMBL4849660, CHEMBL4849643, CHEMBL4849656, CHEMBL4849663, CHEMBL4849665, CHEMBL4849667, CHEMBL4849655, CHEMBL4849649, CHEMBL4849668, CHEMBL4849642, CHEMBL4849645, CHEMBL4849646, CHEMBL4849661>>>"
