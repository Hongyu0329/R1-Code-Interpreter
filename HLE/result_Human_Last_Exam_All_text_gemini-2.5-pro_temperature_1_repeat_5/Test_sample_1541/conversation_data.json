    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the derivation of the most memory-efficient solution.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question\n\nThe problem requires us to take a string representing a mathematical sum, for example, \"3+2+1+4+1\", and reorder the numbers (summands) in it to be in non-decreasing (sorted) order. The resulting string should be printed. The numbers in the sum are guaranteed to be only 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\n*   **Input:** A string `s` of maximum length 1000, containing digits ('1', '2', '3', '4') and '+' symbols, forming a valid sum.\n*   **Output:** A string representing the same sum but with the numbers sorted. For \"3+2+1+4+1\", the output should be \"1+1+2+3+4\".\n*   **Core Task:** The main task is to sort the numbers present in the input string.\n*   **Key Constraint:** We need to find the solution that is the *most memory-efficient* in C and calculate the total memory used by its variables in bytes.\n\n### Step 2: List All Careful Points\n\n1.  **Input Parsing:** The input is a raw string. The numbers are single digits located at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and are separated by '+' at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).\n2.  **Number Range:** The numbers are limited to {1, 2, 3, 4}. This is a crucial piece of information that allows for a highly efficient sorting method (counting sort) instead of a general-purpose one like quicksort.\n3.  **Memory Efficiency:** This is the primary constraint. We must avoid allocating large data structures like an array to hold the numbers if a more frugal method exists. We should also select the smallest possible data types for our variables.\n4.  **Maximum Number of Summands:** The input string `s` has a maximum length of 1000. The shortest possible summand is a single digit like \"1\", and the shortest multi-digit summand is \"1+1\" (length 3). The number of summands `N` for a string of length `L` is `(L+1)/2`. For `L=999` (the maximum possible length for a valid sum under 1000), `N = (999+1)/2 = 500`. This means any counter for the numbers will not exceed 500.\n5.  **Output Formatting:** The output must be a string with numbers separated by '+'. There should be no leading or trailing '+'.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n\nTo achieve maximum memory efficiency, we should process the input without storing the entire string or a list of its numbers. A character-by-character approach is best.\n\n**Strategy: Counting Sort via Character-by-Character Processing**\n\n1.  **Counting Phase:** We will read the input one character at a time using `getchar()`. We will use four counter variables to keep track of the frequency of each number ('1', '2', '3', '4'). We can ignore the '+' characters. This phase continues until we read a newline or end-of-file character. This avoids storing the 1001-byte input string in memory.\n2.  **Printing Phase:** After counting, we will construct and print the result on-the-fly. We will print the character '1' as many times as we counted it, followed by the '2's, then '3's, and finally '4's. To handle the '+' separators correctly without using extra state flags, we can adopt a slightly more clever printing logic:\n    *   Find the smallest number that has a count greater than zero and print it once. This will be the first term, so no '+' is needed before it. Decrement its counter.\n    *   Then, iterate through the remaining counts for '1's, '2's, '3's, and '4's. For each number printed from this point on, always print a '+' character before it.\n\n**Memory Calculation for Variables**\n\nTo find the total memory used (`m`), we sum the sizes of all variables declared in our C program, choosing the smallest appropriate data types. We assume standard data type sizes on a typical competitive programming environment (e.g., 64-bit Linux with GCC): `sizeof(char)`=1, `sizeof(short)`=2, `sizeof(int)`=4.\n\n1.  **Input Character Variable:** `getchar()` returns an `int` to be able to represent `EOF` in addition to all `char` values. Therefore, the variable to hold its result must be an `int`.\n    *   `int c;` -> `sizeof(int)` = **4 bytes**.\n\n2.  **Counter Variables:** We need four counters for the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. As calculated earlier, the maximum count for any number is 500. The `short` data type, which can hold values up to 32,767, is sufficient.\n    *   `short n1, n2, n3, n4;` -> 4 * `sizeof(short)` = 4 * 2 = **8 bytes**.\n\n3.  **Loop Counter Variable:** The printing loops will iterate at most 500 times. A `short` is also sufficient for this purpose. Since the loops are sequential, the same variable can be reused.\n    *   `short i;` -> `sizeof(short)` = **2 bytes**.\n\nNo other variables are necessary for the logic.\n\n**Total Memory (m):**\nSumming the memory usage of all variables:\n`m` = (memory for input char) + (memory for counters) + (memory for loop counter)\n`m` = 4 bytes + 8 bytes + 2 bytes\n`m` = **14 bytes**\n\nThis represents the absolute minimum memory required for variables to solve the problem using this efficient strategy.\n\n<<<14>>>"
