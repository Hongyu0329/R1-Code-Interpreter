    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the probability of finding the particle in the specified interval.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis and Careful Points\n\n1.  **Understand the System and Formulae:**\n    The problem deals with a particle in a one-dimensional (1D) infinite potential well, commonly known as a \"particle in a box\". The box has a length 'a'.\n    *   The normalized wavefunction for the n-th energy state is given by:\n        $\\psi_n(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    *   The probability of finding the particle in a small interval from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is calculated by integrating the probability density, $|\\psi_n(x)|^2$, over that interval:\n        $P(x_1 \\le x \\le x_2) = \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} |\\psi_n(x)|^2 dx$\n\n2.  **Identify Given Parameters:**\n    *   Quantum state: $n = 2$\n    *   Interval start: $x_1 = 0.495a$\n    *   Interval end: $x_2 = 0.505a$\n\n3.  **Set up the Specific Probability Integral:**\n    First, we write the wavefunction and probability density for the $n=2$ state:\n    *   $\\psi_2(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{a}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    *   $|\\psi_2(x)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right)$\n    The integral for the probability is:\n    $P = \\int_{0.495a}^{0.505a} \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) dx$\n\n4.  **List the Careful Points (Important Observations):**\n    *   **Small Interval:** The width of the interval is $\\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 0.505a - 0.495a = 0.01a$. This is a very small fraction (1%) of the total box length.\n    *   **Location of the Interval:** The interval is centered at $x_c = \\frac{0.495a + 0.505a}{2} = 0.5a$.\n    *   **Node at the Center:** For the $n=2$ state, the point $x=0.5a$ is a node. A node is a point where the wavefunction, and therefore the probability density, is zero.\n        $|\\psi_2(0.5a)|^2 = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a)}{a}\\right) = \\frac{2}{a} \\sin^2(\\pi) = 0$.\n    *   **Invalid Simple Approximation:** Because the probability density is zero at the center of the interval, the common approximation $P \\approx |\\psi(x_c)|^2 \\Delta x$ would incorrectly yield a probability of 0. We must use a more accurate method.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer with Step-by-Step Analysis\n\nSince the interval is very small, we can approximate the integrand using a Taylor series expansion around the center of the interval, $x_c = 0.5a$.\n\n**Step 1: Change of Variables**\nLet's define a new variable $\\delta x = x - 0.5a$. This means $x = 0.5a + \\delta x$. As $x$ goes from $0.495a$ to $0.505a$, $\\delta x$ goes from $-0.005a$ to $0.005a$.\n\n**Step 2: Approximate the Integrand**\nSubstitute $x = 0.5a + \\delta x$ into the $\\sin^2$ term:\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi (0.5a + \\delta x)}{a}\\right) = \\sin^2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right)$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\pi + \\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$, we get:\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\pi + \\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right) = \\left(-\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right)$\nSince the interval is small, the value of $\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}$ is also small. For a small angle $\\theta$, we can use the approximation $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$.\n$\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\delta x}{a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (\\delta x)^2}{a^2}$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the Approximated Integral**\nNow substitute this approximation back into the probability integral. We also change the integration variable from $dx$ to $d(\\delta x)$.\n$P \\approx \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} \\frac{2}{a} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^2 (\\delta x)^2}{a^2}\\right) d(\\delta x)$\n$P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\int_{-0.005a}^{0.005a} (\\delta x)^2 d(\\delta x)$\nNow, perform the integration:\n$P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{a^3} \\left[ \\frac{(\\delta x)^3}{3} \\right]_{-0.005a}^{0.005a}$\nEvaluate at the limits:\n$P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ (0.005a)^3 - (-0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n$P \\approx \\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^3} \\left[ 2 \\times (0.005a)^3 \\right]$\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^3} (0.005)^3 a^3$\nThe $a^3$ terms cancel out, leaving a dimensionless probability:\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (0.005)^3$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Numerical Value**\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (5 \\times 10^{-3})^3$\n$P \\approx \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3} (125 \\times 10^{-9})$\nSince $16 \\times 125 = 2000$:\n$P \\approx \\frac{2000\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-9}$\n$P \\approx \\frac{2\\pi^2}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\nUsing the value $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, so $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.8696$:\n$P \\approx \\frac{2 \\times 9.8696}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n$P \\approx \\frac{19.7392}{3} \\times 10^{-6}$\n$P \\approx 6.5797 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the probability is $6.58 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\n<<<6.58e-6>>>"
