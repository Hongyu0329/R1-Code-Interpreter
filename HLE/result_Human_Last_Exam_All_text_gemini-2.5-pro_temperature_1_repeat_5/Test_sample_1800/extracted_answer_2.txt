The ideal Ni/Ce atomic ratio is highly dependent on the specific reaction. For the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction, the optimal ratio is approximately 0.4-0.6, which maximizes the synergistic Ni-Ceria interface. For thermochemical water splitting (WS), a lower ratio of approximately 0.1 is ideal, as this corresponds to the optimal doping level of Ni into the ceria lattice to enhance its redox properties.
