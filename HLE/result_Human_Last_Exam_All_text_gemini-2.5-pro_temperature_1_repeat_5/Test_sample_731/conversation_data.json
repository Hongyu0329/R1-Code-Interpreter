    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of power subgroups in the semidihedral group of size 512.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Semidihedral Group**\n\nThe semidihedral group of order $2^n$, denoted $SD_{2^n}$, is a non-abelian group defined for $n \\ge 4$. Its structure is given by the presentation:\n$G = SD_{2^n} = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1} \\rangle$.\n\nThe group in the question has size 512. Since $512 = 2^9$, we are dealing with the group $G = SD_{2^9}$. So, for our specific case, $n=9$.\nThe group is $G = \\langle r, s \\mid r^{256} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{127} \\rangle$.\nThe elements of $G$ are of the form $r^i$ for $0 \\le i < 256$, and $r^i s$ for $0 \\le i < 256$.\n\n**Step 2: Define Power Subgroups**\n\nA subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is called a power subgroup if it can be generated by taking the $k$-th power of every element in $G$, for some integer $k$. This subgroup is denoted by $G^k$:\n$G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\nOur goal is to find the number of distinct subgroups that can be formed in this way.\n\n**Step 3: Simplify the Problem for a p-group**\n\nThe group $G = SD_{2^9}$ is a 2-group (a group of prime power order, where the prime is 2). For any $p$-group, the set of power subgroups $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ is equivalent to the set $\\{G^{p^j} \\mid j \\ge 0\\}$.\nThis is because any integer $k$ can be written as $k = p^j \\cdot m$, where $p$ does not divide $m$. In a $p$-group, every element has an order that is a power of $p$. The map $g \\mapsto g^m$ is a bijection on the group $G$. Consequently, the set of elements $\\{g^m \\mid g \\in G\\}$ is the same as the set of elements $\\{g \\mid g \\in G\\}$, which means $G^m=G$. Therefore, $G^k = G^{p^j \\cdot m} = (G^m)^{p^j} = G^{p^j}$.\n\nFor our group $G = SD_{2^9}$, which is a 2-group, we only need to consider the power subgroups $G^{2^j}$ for $j \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Power Subgroups $G^{2^j}$**\n\nWe need to compute the subgroups $G^{2^j} = \\langle g^{2^j} \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$ for $j=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The elements $g$ are of the form $r^i$ or $r^i s$.\n\n*   **For $g = r^i$**: The powers are $(r^i)^{2^j} = r^{i \\cdot 2^j}$. For a fixed $j$, as $i$ varies, these elements generate the cyclic subgroup $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n*   **For $g = r^i s$**: We first compute $(r^i s)^2$. Using the relation $sr^i = r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)}s$, we get:\n    $(r^i s)^2 = r^i s r^i s = r^i (sr^i s) = r^i r^{i(2^{n-2}-1)} = r^{i(1 + 2^{n-2}-1)} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$.\n    Now we can find higher powers:\n    $(r^i s)^{2^j} = ((r^i s)^2)^{2^{j-1}} = (r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}})^{2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2} \\cdot 2^{j-1}} = r^{i \\cdot 2^{n+j-3}}$.\n    The order of $r$ is $2^{n-1}$. If the exponent $n+j-3$ is greater than or equal to $n-1$, the result is the identity element. This condition is $j-3 \\ge -1$, which simplifies to $j \\ge 2$.\n    So, for $j \\ge 2$, $(r^i s)^{2^j} = 1$ for all $i$.\n\nNow we can determine the power subgroups $G^{2^j}$:\n\n*   **For $j=0$ ($k=1$)**: $G^1 = G$. This is our first power subgroup.\n\n*   **For $j=1$ ($k=2$)**: $G^2 = \\langle (r^i)^2, (r^i s)^2 \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\rangle$.\n    The generators are $r^{2i}$ and $r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}$.\n    The set $\\{r^{2i}\\}$ generates $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    The set $\\{r^{i \\cdot 2^{n-2}}\\}$ generates $\\langle r^{2^{n-2}} \\rangle$.\n    So, $G^2 = \\langle \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^{2^{n-2}} \\rangle \\rangle$.\n    For $n=9$, we have $n-2 = 7 \\ge 1$. Thus, $r^{2^{n-2}} = r^{128}$ is an element of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This means $\\langle r^{2^{n-2}} \\rangle$ is a subgroup of $\\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, $G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$.\n\n*   **For $j \\ge 2$**: $G^{2^j} = \\langle (r^i)^{2^j}, (r^i s)^{2^j} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\rangle$.\n    The generators from $(r^i)^{2^j}$ give $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n    The generators from $(r^i s)^{2^j}$ are all 1, as shown above.\n    Therefore, for $j \\ge 2$, $G^{2^j} = \\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$.\n\n**Step 5: List all distinct power subgroups and count them**\n\nThe set of all power subgroups is $\\{G^{2^j} \\mid j \\ge 0\\}$. Let's list them for $n=9$:\n1.  $j=0: G^{2^0} = G^1 = G$. This is a non-abelian group of order $2^9=512$.\n2.  $j=1: G^{2^1} = G^2 = \\langle r^2 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order $2^{9-1-1} = 2^7 = 128$.\n3.  $j=2: G^{2^2} = G^4 = \\langle r^4 \\rangle$. This is a cyclic group of order $2^{9-1-2} = 2^6 = 64$.\n4.  $j=3: G^{2^3} = G^8 = \\langle r^8 \\rangle$. Order $2^5=32$.\n5.  $j=4: G^{2^4} = G^{16} = \\langle r^{16} \\rangle$. Order $2^4=16$.\n6.  $j=5: G^{2^5} = G^{32} = \\langle r^{32} \\rangle$. Order $2^3=8$.\n7.  $j=6: G^{2^6} = G^{64} = \\langle r^{64} \\rangle$. Order $2^2=4$.\n8.  $j=7: G^{2^7} = G^{128} = \\langle r^{128} \\rangle$. Order $2^1=2$.\n9.  $j=8: G^{2^8} = G^{256} = \\langle r^{256} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This is the trivial subgroup of order 1.\n\nFor any $j > 8$, $G^{2^j}$ will also be the trivial subgroup $\\{1\\}$. So, the list above contains all distinct power subgroups.\nThe subgroups in the list are all distinct: $G$ is non-abelian, while the others are cyclic. The cyclic subgroups $\\langle r^{2^j} \\rangle$ for $j=1, \\dots, 8$ all have different orders, so they are all distinct from each other.\n\nCounting the subgroups in the list, we have 9 distinct power subgroups.\n\nIn general, for the group $SD_{2^n}$, the distinct power subgroups are $G, \\langle r^2 \\rangle, \\langle r^4 \\rangle, \\dots, \\langle r^{2^{n-1}} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$. This gives a total of $1 + (n-1) = n$ subgroups. For $n=9$, the number is 9."
