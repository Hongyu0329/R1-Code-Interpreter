    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the word and its reading:** The kanji is 「弟」. The standard Japanese reading for \"younger brother\" is 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n\n2.  **Determine the morae:** The word 「おとうと」 is composed of four morae (sound units):\n    *   お (o)\n    *   と (to)\n    *   う (u) - This is the long vowel part of 'to'.\n    *   と (to)\n\n3.  **Analyze the standard pitch accent pattern:** We need to determine how the pitch changes from one mora to the next in standard Japanese (Tokyo dialect).\n    *   The pitch for 「おとうと」 starts low on the first mora and rises on the second.\n    *   お (o) - Low\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   う (u) - High\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   The pattern is Low-High-High-High.\n\n4.  **Consider a particle:** The definitive test for some accent patterns is to see what happens when a particle (like 「が」 or 「は」) is attached.\n    *   When we say 「弟が」 (otouto ga), the pitch of the particle 「が」 continues the high pitch from the word.\n    *   お (o) - Low\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   う (u) - High\n    *   と (to) - High\n    *   が (ga) - High\n    *   The pattern is Low-High-High-High-High.\n\n5.  **Match the pattern to the terminology:**\n    *   **Heiban (平板型):** The pitch starts low, rises on the second mora, and stays high for the rest of the word and any following particles. This perfectly matches the pattern of 「おとうと」. It is often represented with a ⓪, as in 「おとうと⓪」.\n    *   **Atamadaka (頭高型):** The pitch is high only on the first mora and drops on the second. (e.g., H-L-L-L). This is not the pattern for 「おとうと」.\n    *   **Nakadaka (中高型):** The pitch rises after the first mora and falls *before* the last mora. (e.g., L-H-L-L or L-H-H-L). This is not the pattern for 「おとうと」.\n    *   **Odaka (尾高型):** The pitch rises after the first mora, stays high until the end of the word, and then drops on the following particle. (e.g., a word like 「あたま」 (atama), which becomes L-H-H for the word and L-H-H-L with a particle). This is not the pattern for 「おとうと」 because the particle remains high.\n\n**Careful points to consider:**\n\n*   **Morae vs. Syllables:** Pitch accent in Japanese is based on morae, not syllables. 「おとうと」 has 4 morae (o-to-u-to) but 3 syllables (o-tou-to).\n*   **Reading:** Ensure you are using the correct reading. 「弟」 can also be read as 「てい」 (tei) or 「だい」 (dai) in compounds, which have different accent patterns. The question implies the standalone word for \"younger brother,\" which is 「おとうと」.\n*   **Standard Dialect:** Pitch accent can vary by region. The \"standard\" pattern refers to the one used in Tokyo and in national broadcasts.\n*   **Particle Test:** The behavior of the pitch when a particle is attached is crucial for distinguishing between Heiban (平板) and Odaka (尾高) patterns. Both have a high pitch on the last mora of the word itself, but only Heiban keeps the particle high.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the analysis, the word 「おとうと」 follows the Low-High-High-High... pattern, which is characteristic of the Heiban type.\n\n<<<A>>>"
