    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the solution.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the polynomial and its splitting field.**\nLet the given polynomial be $f(x) = x^7 - 2 x^5 - 9 x^3 + 3 x^2 + 18 x - 6$.\nWe first try to find factors of this polynomial. By testing for groupings of terms, we can find a factorization:\n$f(x) = (x^5 - 9x + 3)(x^2 - 2)$.\nLet $p(x) = x^2 - 2$ and $q(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$.\n\n*   **Analysis of $p(x) = x^2 - 2$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with $p=2$ (or simply because its roots $\\pm\\sqrt{2}$ are not in $\\mathbb{Q}$).\n    The splitting field of $p(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ is $K_p = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    The Galois group is $\\text{Gal}(K_p/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2$, the cyclic group of order 2.\n\n*   **Analysis of $q(x) = x^5 - 9x + 3$:**\n    This polynomial is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$ by Eisenstein's criterion with the prime $p=3$. The coefficients are (1, 0, 0, 0, -9, 3). $3$ divides all coefficients except the leading one, and $3^2=9$ does not divide the constant term 3.\n    To determine the Galois group of $q(x)$, we analyze its roots. The derivative is $q'(x) = 5x^4 - 9$, which has two real roots at $x = \\pm \\sqrt[4]{9/5}$. This means $q(x)$ has at most three real roots.\n    Evaluating $q(x)$ at several points:\n    $q(-2) = -32 + 18 + 3 = -11 < 0$\n    $q(0) = 3 > 0$\n    $q(1) = 1 - 9 + 3 = -5 < 0$\n    $q(2) = 32 - 18 + 3 = 17 > 0$\n    By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there are real roots in $(-2, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(1, 2)$. Thus, $q(x)$ has exactly three real roots and two complex conjugate roots.\n    For an irreducible quintic polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}$, having exactly three real roots implies its Galois group is the symmetric group $S_5$.\n    Let $K_q$ be the splitting field of $q(x)$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Then $\\text{Gal}(K_q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong S_5$, and $[K_q:\\mathbb{Q}] = |S_5| = 120$.\n\n*   **The splitting field $K$:**\n    The splitting field $K$ of $f(x)$ is the compositum of the splitting fields $K_p$ and $K_q$, i.e., $K = K_p K_q$.\n    The Galois group $\\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$ is a subgroup of the direct product $\\text{Gal}(K_p/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_q/\\mathbb{Q})$.\n    The intersection of the fields is $K_p \\cap K_q = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\cap K_q$. The only quadratic subfield of $K_q$ (whose Galois group is $S_5$) is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$, where $D$ is the discriminant of $q(x)$.\n    The discriminant of $x^5+ax+b$ is $D=2^8 a^5 + 5^5 b^4$. For $q(x)$, $a=-9, b=3$.\n    $D = 256(-9)^5 + 3125(3)^4 = 256(-59049) + 3125(81) = -15116544 + 253125 = -14863419$.\n    Since $D = -14863419$ is not of the form $2m^2$ for some $m \\in \\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D}) \\neq \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n    Therefore, $K_p \\cap K_q = \\mathbb{Q}$.\n    This implies that the Galois group of the compositum is the direct product of the individual Galois groups:\n    $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong \\text{Gal}(K_p/\\mathbb{Q}) \\times \\text{Gal}(K_q/\\mathbb{Q}) \\cong C_2 \\times S_5$.\n    The degree of the extension is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G| = |C_2| \\times |S_5| = 2 \\times 120 = 240$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the normal subgroups of $G = C_2 \\times S_5$.**\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, a sub-extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is normal if and only if its corresponding subgroup, $H = \\text{Gal}(K/L)$, is a normal subgroup of $G = \\text{Gal}(K/\\mathbb{Q})$. The condition $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ translates to $\\{e\\} \\neq H \\neq G$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of $S_5$ are $\\{e\\}$, the alternating group $A_5$, and $S_5$.\nThe normal subgroups of $C_2$ are $\\{e\\}$ and $C_2$.\n\nThe normal subgroups of a direct product $G_1 \\times G_2$ are not always of the form $N_1 \\times N_2$ where $N_1 \\unlhd G_1$ and $N_2 \\unlhd G_2$. However, we can classify them systematically.\nThe \"obvious\" normal subgroups of $C_2 \\times S_5$ are products of normal subgroups:\n1.  $H_1 = \\{e\\} \\times \\{e\\}$ (trivial subgroup, $|H_1|=1$)\n2.  $H_2 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ ($|H_2|=2$)\n3.  $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$ ($|H_3|=60$)\n4.  $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$ ($|H_4|=120$)\n5.  $H_5 = C_2 \\times A_5$ ($|H_5|=120$)\n6.  $H_6 = C_2 \\times S_5$ (the entire group, $|H_6|=240$)\n\nThere can also be \"skew\" or \"diagonal\" normal subgroups. A normal subgroup $H \\unlhd C_2 \\times S_5$ is determined by an isomorphism $\\psi: N_1/K_1 \\to N_2/K_2$, where $N_i$ are projections and $K_i$ are intersections. The only non-trivial case for such an isomorphism is between quotients of order 2.\n$C_2/\\{e\\} \\cong C_2$ and $S_5/A_5 \\cong C_2$.\nThis gives one additional normal subgroup, let's call it $H_7$.\nLet $c$ be the non-trivial element of $C_2$. $H_7$ consists of pairs $(g, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5$ such that the \"parity\" matches. We can define this via the sign homomorphism sgn: $S_5 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\cong C_2$.\n$H_7 = \\{(g, \\sigma) \\in C_2 \\times S_5 \\mid \\phi(g) = \\text{sgn}(\\sigma)\\}$, where $\\phi: C_2 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}$ is the natural isomorphism.\nExplicitly, $H_7 = \\{(e, \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in A_5\\} \\cup \\{(c, \\sigma) \\mid \\sigma \\in S_5 \\setminus A_5\\}$.\nThe order of this subgroup is $|A_5| + |S_5 \\setminus A_5| = 60 + 60 = 120$.\n\nThe proper non-trivial normal subgroups of $G$ are $H_2, H_3, H_4, H_5, H_7$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the degrees of the corresponding normal extensions.**\nThe degree of a normal extension $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is given by the index of the corresponding normal subgroup $H$:\n$[L:\\mathbb{Q}] = |G:H| = |G|/|H| = 240/|H|$.\n\nWe calculate this for each of the proper, non-trivial normal subgroups found in Step 2:\n*   For $H_2 = C_2 \\times \\{e\\}$ ($|H_2|=2$):\n    $[L_2:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 2 = 120$.\n    (This corresponds to the fixed field $K^{C_2 \\times \\{e\\}} = K_q$).\n\n*   For $H_3 = \\{e\\} \\times A_5$ ($|H_3|=60$):\n    $[L_3:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 60 = 4$.\n    (This corresponds to the fixed field $K^{\\{e\\} \\times A_5} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{D})$).\n\n*   For $H_4 = \\{e\\} \\times S_5$ ($|H_4|=120$):\n    $[L_4:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n    (This corresponds to the fixed field $K^{\\{e\\} \\times S_5} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$).\n\n*   For $H_5 = C_2 \\times A_5$ ($|H_5|=120$):\n    $[L_5:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n    (This corresponds to the fixed field $K^{C_2 \\times A_5} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})$).\n\n*   For $H_7$ (skew subgroup, $|H_7|=120$):\n    $[L_7:\\mathbb{Q}] = 240 / 120 = 2$.\n    (This corresponds to the fixed field $K^{H_7} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2D})$).\n\n**Step 4: List all possible degrees.**\nThe set of possible degrees for such extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of the values calculated in the previous step.\nThe calculated degrees are 120, 4, and 2.\n\nThe possible degrees of normal field extensions $L/\\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\\mathbb{Q} \\subsetneq L \\subsetneq K$ are 2, 4, and 120.\n\n<<<2, 4, 120>>>"
