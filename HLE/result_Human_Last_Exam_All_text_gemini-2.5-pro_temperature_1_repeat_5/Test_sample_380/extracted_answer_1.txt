No, the local magnetic field at the L1 point is generally not considered to be radial. The justification for using magnetic field components perpendicular to the radial direction (Y and Z components in a standard GSE coordinate system) is based on Taylor's "frozen-in flow" hypothesis, not on the orientation of the magnetic field itself.

Here is the justification:

1.  **Parker Spiral:** Due to the Sun's rotation, the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) embedded in the solar wind forms a spiral shape (the Parker Spiral). At the L1 point (at 1 AU), the angle between the local magnetic field and the radial direction is typically around 45 degrees for average solar wind speeds. Therefore, the field has both significant radial and non-radial components.

2.  **Taylor's Hypothesis:** The solar wind flows radially outward from the Sun at a very high speed (supersonic and super-Alfv√©nic). Taylor's hypothesis states that because this flow speed is much greater than the wave speeds within the plasma, the spatial structures of the plasma are effectively "frozen" into the flow as they are swept past a stationary spacecraft. This allows a time series measurement at one point to be interpreted as a one-dimensional spatial measurement along the solar wind flow direction.

3.  **Coordinate System and Measurement Axis:** Since the solar wind flows radially, the radial direction (the X-axis in standard coordinate systems) becomes the de facto axis of the spatial scan. Consequently, the Y and Z components are the components perpendicular to this measurement axis. The helicity calculation using these components is therefore a measure of the wave properties in the plane perpendicular to the solar wind flow.

In summary, the calculation uses components perpendicular to the **radial flow direction** because this is the direction of the spatial cut being measured by the spacecraft, as dictated by Taylor's hypothesis. This is a practical and widely used approach, even though it is an approximation and does not measure helicity in the plane strictly perpendicular to the local magnetic field unless the field happens to be radial.
