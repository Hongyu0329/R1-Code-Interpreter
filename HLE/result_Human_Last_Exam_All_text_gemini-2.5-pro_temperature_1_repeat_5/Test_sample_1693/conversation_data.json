    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstructing the Question\nThe question asks for a specific ship with four key criteria:\n1.  **Nationality:** French.\n2.  **Size:** The largest by displacement. Displacement is the weight of water a ship displaces, which is equal to the ship's own weight. It's the standard measure for the size of warships and is also used for other vessels.\n3.  **Cause of Sinking:** Sunk by a German U-boat. This can include torpedoes, naval mines laid by a U-boat, or gunfire.\n4.  **Timeframe:** During World War II, but specifically before the Armistice of 22 June 1940. This means the period from September 3, 1939, to June 21, 1940.\n\n### Step 2: Searching for Candidates\nWe need to find a list of all French ships sunk by U-boats within this timeframe and then compare their displacements. The search should include both naval warships and civilian merchant ships, as large passenger liners can have displacements comparable to or greater than battleships.\n\n*   **French Naval Losses:** In the early phase of the war, the French Navy (Marine Nationale) did not lose any of its largest warships (battleships or heavy cruisers) to U-boat attacks. Losses were primarily destroyers or smaller vessels, which have much lower displacements than large liners or tankers. For example, the submarine *Doris* was sunk by U-9 on May 9, 1940, but its displacement was only about 800 tons submerged.\n\n*   **French Merchant Marine Losses:** The primary targets for U-boats were merchant ships. We must look for large passenger liners or tankers.\n\n### Step 3: Listing and Comparing Potential Candidates\nHere are the largest French ships sunk by U-boats in the specified period, ordered by size:\n\n1.  **SS *Champlain***\n    *   **Type:** Passenger Liner\n    *   **Size:** 28,124 Gross Register Tons (GRT). Her full load displacement was approximately **35,000 tons**.\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 17 June 1940 (within the timeframe).\n    *   **Cause:** Struck a mine laid by the German U-boat **U-65** off La Pallice.\n    *   **Careful Point:** The sinking was caused by a mine laid by a U-boat. This is a direct result of a U-boat's military action and falls under the category of \"sunk by a U-boat\".\n\n2.  **MV *Emile Miguet***\n    *   **Type:** Oil Tanker\n    *   **Size:** 14,115 GRT. Her displacement was approximately **21,700 tons**.\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 12 October 1939.\n    *   **Cause:** Torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat **U-48** in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n3.  **SS *Bretagne***\n    *   **Type:** Passenger/Cargo Ship\n    *   **Size:** 10,171 GRT. Her displacement was approximately **15,000 tons**.\n    *   **Date Sunk:** 14 October 1939.\n    *   **Cause:** Torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat **U-45** in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n### Step 4: Final Analysis\nComparing the candidates based on displacement, which is the specific criterion in the question:\n*   SS *Champlain*: ~35,000 tons\n*   MV *Emile Miguet*: ~21,700 tons\n*   SS *Bretagne*: ~15,000 tons\n\nThe SS *Champlain* is clearly the largest ship by a significant margin. All criteria from the question are met: it was a French ship, its displacement was the largest, it was sunk as a result of a U-boat's action, and the sinking occurred on June 17, 1940, just five days before the armistice.\n\n<<<SS Champlain>>>"
