    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the final answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\nThe question asks for the \"tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad\" *after* Mount Olympus. This requires three main actions:\n1.  Identify all mountains mentioned by name in the text of the *Iliad*.\n2.  Confirm that these mountains are \"historical,\" meaning they correspond to real, physical locations.\n3.  Find the modern elevations of these mountains and rank them to find the tallest one, excluding Mount Olympus.\n\n**Step 2: Identify All Mountains Mentioned in the *Iliad***\nA thorough reading of the *Iliad* reveals several named mountains that play a role, either as settings for divine action or as geographical markers.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:** The home of the gods. It is the tallest mountain in Greece and is explicitly excluded from the final answer.\n*   **Mount Ida:** A mountain near Troy, famous as the place where Zeus sits on its peak, Gargarus, to watch the Trojan War.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:** The high peak on the island of Samothrace from which Poseidon watches the battle.\n*   **Mount Pelion:** A mountain in Thessaly, Greece, mentioned as the source of the wood for Achilles' spear.\n*   **Mount Athos:** Mentioned in Book 14 as part of the path Hera takes on her journey from Olympus to Lemnos.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:** Mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships (Book 2) as a landmark in Maeonia (later Lydia), the region from which a contingent of Trojan allies came.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Modern Identity and Elevation of Each Mountain**\nNow, we must find the current names and elevations of these historical mountains to compare them.\n\n*   **Mount Olympus:**\n    *   Location: Greece\n    *   Elevation: **2,918 meters (9,573 ft)**. As per the question, this is our benchmark and is excluded from the ranking.\n*   **Mount Tmolus:**\n    *   Modern Name: Bozdağlar (with the highest peak called Bozdağ)\n    *   Location: Turkey\n    *   Elevation: **2,159 meters (7,083 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Athos:**\n    *   Modern Name: Mount Athos\n    *   Location: Greece\n    *   Elevation: **2,033 meters (6,670 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Ida:**\n    *   Modern Name: Kaz Dağı\n    *   Location: Turkey\n    *   Elevation: **1,774 meters (5,820 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Pelion:**\n    *   Modern Name: Mount Pelion (Pilio)\n    *   Location: Greece\n    *   Elevation: **1,624 meters (5,328 ft)**.\n*   **Mount Samothrace:**\n    *   Modern Name: Mount Fengari (or Saos)\n    *   Location: Island of Samothrace, Greece\n    *   Elevation: **1,611 meters (5,285 ft)**.\n\n**Step 4: Rank the Mountains and Find the Tallest (After Olympus)**\nBy arranging the mountains from tallest to shortest (excluding Olympus), we get the following list:\n\n1.  **Mount Tmolus:** 2,159 m\n2.  **Mount Athos:** 2,033 m\n3.  **Mount Ida:** 1,774 m\n4.  **Mount Pelion:** 1,624 m\n5.  **Mount Samothrace:** 1,611 m\n\nThe tallest mountain on this list is Mount Tmolus.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Ensuring Mention in the *Iliad*:** It's critical to confirm that each mountain is explicitly named in the *Iliad* itself, not just in later Greek myths or other epics. All the mountains listed above are present in the text of the *Iliad*.\n2.  **Distinguishing the Two Mount Idas:** Greek mythology features two famous mountains named Ida: one in Crete (associated with Zeus's birth) and one near Troy. The *Iliad*'s context makes it clear that it is referring to the Trojan Mount Ida.\n3.  **Considering Peaks vs. Mountains:** Gargarus is mentioned as the highest peak of Mount Ida, not as a separate mountain, so it is considered part of Ida for this ranking.\n4.  **Reliance on Modern Elevation Data:** The final answer depends on accurate modern measurements of these anciently-named locations.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\nBased on the comparative analysis of the elevations of all historical mountains mentioned in the *Iliad*, Mount Tmolus is the tallest after Mount Olympus.\n\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"
