    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe user wants to know a specific number: how many *entrelacés* are performed in a particular ballet variation.\n*   **Ballet & Scene:** *La Bayadère*, \"The Death of Nikiya\" scene (Act 2).\n*   **Dancer:** Natalia Osipova.\n*   **Performance:** Her debut in the role.\n*   **Company & Year:** Bolshoi Ballet, 2009.\n*   **Specific Step:** *Entrelacé*.\n\n### Step 2: List Careful Points\n1.  **Identify the Correct Performance:** It is crucial to find footage of Osipova's 2009 debut with the Bolshoi, not her later performances of the same role with other companies (like The Royal Ballet) or even later Bolshoi performances, as choreography or the dancer's execution can change. The 2009 debut is a specific, recorded event.\n2.  **Correctly Define the Ballet Step:** An *entrelacé* (fully, *grand jeté en tournant entrelacé*, and often shortened to *tour jeté*) is a specific turning jump. The dancer executes a *grand battement* with one leg, pushes off the supporting foot, and performs a turn in the air while \"whipping\" or switching the legs, landing on the leg that initiated the *battement*. It must be distinguished from other turning jumps.\n3.  **Isolate the Correct Variation:** The \"Death of Nikiya\" scene features a solo for Nikiya where she dances with the basket of flowers given to her on behalf of Gamzatti. This is the variation that needs to be analyzed.\n4.  **Perform an Accurate Count:** The choreography must be watched carefully, focusing only on the specific step in question. It is common for dancers to perform a series or \"manège\" of a single step, so counting them accurately is key.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Acquire the Final Answer\n1.  **Locate the Performance Video:** A search for \"Natalia Osipova Bayadere debut Bolshoi 2009 Nikiya death\" leads to widely available clips of this specific, acclaimed performance.\n2.  **Analyze the Choreography:** Watching the video of Osipova's solo, we can identify the various components. The variation includes expressive port de bras, attitudes, and penchés.\n3.  **Identify the Entrelacé Sequence:** A key part of this variation is a powerful diagonal sequence of jumps. We must confirm these jumps are *entrelacés*. By observing Osipova's technique, we can see her initiate with a *grand battement*, turn, and switch her legs in the air with the characteristic whipping motion, landing in an arabesque. This confirms the steps are indeed *entrelacés*.\n4.  **Count the Jumps:** By carefully watching this diagonal sequence, we can count each individual *entrelacé* she performs.\n    *   She prepares and executes the first *entrelacé*.\n    *   She prepares and executes the second *entrelacé*.\n    *   She prepares and executes the third *entrelacé*.\n    *   She prepares and executes the fourth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She prepares and executes the fifth *entrelacé*.\n    *   She prepares and executes the sixth *entrelacé*.\n5.  **Conclusion:** After the sixth jump, she transitions into a different sequence of steps. Therefore, the total count of *entrelacés* performed in this famous diagonal is six.\n\n<<<6>>>"
