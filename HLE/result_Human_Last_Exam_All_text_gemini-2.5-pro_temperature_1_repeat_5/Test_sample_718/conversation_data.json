    "An n-resolvable functor is a common term in representation theory, and it refers to a functor (or module) that has a projective resolution of a certain length. Let's analyze the question step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the definitions**\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice (J):** An upper semilattice is a partially ordered set (poset) where for any two elements $x, y \\in J$, there exists a least upper bound, denoted $x \\vee y$. When viewed as a category, this means that every pair of objects has a coproduct.\n*   **Functor f: J -> Vect_K:** This is a representation of the poset $J$. It assigns a vector space $f(j)$ to each element $j \\in J$ and a linear map $f(i \\to j): f(i) \\to f(j)$ for each relation $i \\le j$ in the poset, respecting composition. The category of such functors is equivalent to the category of left modules over the **category algebra** (or incidence algebra) $KJ$.\n*   **Tame Functor:** The term \"tame\" usually applies to a category or an algebra, not to a single object (functor/module). A representation problem is **tame** if the indecomposable representations in each dimension can be parameterized by a finite number of one-parameter families, plus a finite number of discrete indecomposables. A \"tame functor\" most likely refers to an indecomposable representation of an algebra $KJ$ where $J$ is a poset of tame representation type. It could also refer more specifically to the regular representations that form the one-parameter families.\n*   **n-resolvable:** A functor $f$ is called $n$-resolvable if there exists an exact sequence of the form:\n    $P_{n-1} \\to P_{n-2} \\to \\dots \\to P_1 \\to P_0 \\to f \\to 0$\n    where each $P_i$ is a projective functor. This is equivalent to saying that the **projective dimension** of $f$, denoted pd($f$), is at most $n-1$.\n\nThe question asks for a single integer $n$ such that *any* tame functor $f$ on *any* tame upper semilattice $J$ is $n$-resolvable. This means we are looking for a uniform bound on the projective dimension of these functors.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the constraints**\n\n*   **Upper Semilattice property:** This property is quite restrictive. For example, it implies that the poset is connected (any two elements have a common upper bound). It also has consequences for the structure of the algebra $KJ$.\n*   **Tame property:** The representation type of a poset algebra $KJ$ is determined by the combinatorial structure of the poset $J$. For $J$ to be tame, it must not contain any of the minimal \"wild\" posets as a subposet. The upper semilattice property automatically forbids some of these wild posets (like those that are disjoint unions of other posets), but not all of them. For example, the poset $J = \\{c, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5\\}$ with $p_i < c$ for all $i$ is an upper semilattice, but it is of wild representation type. So, the condition that $J$ is a tame upper semilattice is a non-trivial constraint.\n\n**Step 3: Relate n-resolvability to global dimension**\n\nThe question is about finding a bound on the projective dimension of certain functors. If we can find a bound on the **global dimension** of the algebra $KJ$, say gl.dim($KJ$) $\\le d$, then every functor $f$ has pd($f$) $\\le d$. This would mean every functor is $(d+1)$-resolvable. So the question is equivalent to asking for a bound on the global dimension of algebras $KJ$ where $J$ is a tame upper semilattice (or at least on the projective dimension of their \"tame\" modules).\n\n**Step 4: Examine examples and known results**\n\n1.  **Hereditary Algebras (gl.dim $\\le$ 1):** If $KJ$ is a hereditary algebra, then the projective dimension of any module is at most 1. Thus, every functor is 2-resolvable. Many tame upper semilattices give rise to hereditary algebras. For example, the poset $J = \\{c, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4\\}$ with $p_i < c$ corresponds to the path algebra of the Euclidean quiver $\\tilde{D}_4$ (with all arrows pointing to the center). This is a tame hereditary algebra, so gl.dim=1. All functors are 2-resolvable.\n\n2.  **Non-hereditary algebras:** An algebra $KJ$ is not hereditary if the poset $J$ contains a \"crown\" subposet. It is possible for a tame upper semilattice to contain a crown. Consider the poset $J = \\{a,b,c,d,x,y\\}$ with relations $a<x, b<x, a<y, b<y, c<x, d<y$. This can be part of a tame upper semilattice. Let's consider a simpler example of a non-hereditary poset algebra.\n    The poset $L = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$ with $a<c, a<d, b<c, b<d$ (a diamond shape) is a distributive lattice, which is of finite representation type (and therefore tame) and is an upper semilattice. The global dimension of its incidence algebra $KL$ is 2. Therefore, not every functor is 2-resolvable (some have pd=2). However, every functor is **3-resolvable** (since pd($f$) $\\le 2$).\n\n3.  **Tilted Algebras:** A key class of tame, non-hereditary algebras are the **tame tilted algebras**. A tilted algebra is of the form End$_H(T)$ where $H$ is a hereditary algebra and $T$ is a tilting module. If $H$ is tame, the resulting tilted algebra is tame. A fundamental result states that any tilted algebra has a global dimension of at most 2. Therefore, for any tame tilted algebra, all modules are 3-resolvable. It is known that algebras of tame upper semilattices can be tame tilted algebras.\n\n**Step 5: Synthesize the findings**\n\n*   We have seen examples of tame upper semilattices where the global dimension is 1 (all functors are 2-resolvable).\n*   We have seen an example where the global dimension is 2 (all functors are 3-resolvable). This shows that $n=2$ is not a universal answer.\n*   The class of tame tilted algebras, which are known to have gl.dim $\\le 2$, serves as a good model for non-hereditary tame algebras. This suggests that $n=3$ might be the correct bound.\n\nThe theory of tame algebras is deep, but a recurring theme is that well-behaved tame algebras (like those of polynomial growth, or tilted algebras) have low global dimension (typically $\\le 2$). While there exist tame algebras with arbitrarily large or infinite global dimension, the combined constraints of being a poset algebra and an upper semilattice are very strong and appear to prevent such pathologies. The properties of tame functors (or regular modules) in the well-understood classes of tame algebras (hereditary, tilted) show that their projective dimensions are bounded by 2.\n\n*   pd($f$) $\\le 1$ for tame hereditary case ($f$ is 2-resolvable).\n*   pd($f$) $\\le 2$ for tame tilted case ($f$ is 3-resolvable).\n\nSince we are looking for a number $n$ that works for *any* tame functor on *any* tame upper semilattice, we must take the worst case. The case of gl.dim=2 requires $n=3$. So, a functor is 3-resolvable.\n\nFinal conclusion: The condition of being a tame upper semilattice constrains the associated algebra to classes where module projective dimensions are bounded by 2. This makes every functor 3-resolvable."
