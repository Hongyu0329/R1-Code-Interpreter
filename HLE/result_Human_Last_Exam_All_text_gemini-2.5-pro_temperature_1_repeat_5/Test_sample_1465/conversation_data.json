    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the oligomeric state of each coiled-coil protein sequence.\n\n### **Careful Points and General Principles**\n\nThe oligomeric state (dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc.) of a coiled-coil is primarily determined by the amino acid residues at the core positions of its heptad repeat, denoted `(abcdefg)n`.\n\n1.  **Heptad Repeat:** Coiled-coils are formed by alpha-helices that have a repeating pattern of seven amino acids.\n2.  **Core Positions (`a` and `d`):** These positions are typically occupied by hydrophobic residues. They pack against each other to form the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil, driving the oligomerization. The specific nature of these residues is the key determinant of the oligomeric state.\n3.  **Flanking Positions (`e` and `g`):** These are often charged or polar residues that can form stabilizing electrostatic interactions (salt bridges) between helices.\n4.  **Identifying the Register:** The first step in analyzing a sequence is to correctly identify the `a, b, c, d, e, f, g` positions. This is usually done by finding the register that maximizes the number of hydrophobic residues at the `a` and `d` positions.\n5.  **Key Rules for Oligomeric State:**\n    *   **Dimer (2):** Often specified by canonical \"leucine zipper\" patterns. A very common motif is having Isoleucine (I) at the `a` position and Leucine (L) at the `d` position (`a=I, d=L`). Similarly, Alanine (A) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d` also strongly favor dimers.\n    *   **Trimer (3):** Often formed when beta-branched amino acids occupy the core. A classic trimer-forming motif is Isoleucine (I) at `a` and Threonine (T) at `d` (`a=I, d=T`). The steric hindrance of these beta-branched side chains fits best in a trimeric arrangement.\n    *   **Tetramer (4):** Strongly favored when both the `a` and `d` positions are occupied by the beta-branched Isoleucine (I) (`a=I, d=I`). The steric bulk of Isoleucine at both core positions prevents lower-order oligomerization and is best accommodated in a tetrameric structure.\n\n---\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Sequence**\n\n**Sequence 1: `EIAQALKEIAKALKEIAWALKEIAQALK`**\n\n1.  **Identify Register:** We look for a repeating hydrophobic pattern. The most plausible register places Alanine (A) at the `a` positions and Leucine (L) at the `d` positions. This requires starting the heptad at the 5th residue (A). The register is `cdefgab`.\n    *   Heptad: `(A L K E I A Q)n`\n    *   `a` positions: A, A, A, A\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n2.  **Analyze Core:** The core is `a=A, d=L`. This is a classic leucine zipper motif. The small Alanine and larger Leucine pack together efficiently in a \"knobs-into-holes\" arrangement.\n3.  **Conclusion:** This pattern is a strong predictor of a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 2: `EIAALKQEIAALKKENAALKQEIAALKQ`**\n\n1.  **Identify Register:** Similar to the first sequence, we look for the most stable hydrophobic core. Despite some unusual substitutions (`...KKE...`, `...ENA...`), the underlying pattern that maximizes hydrophobicity in the core puts Alanine (A) at `a` and Leucine (L) at `d`. The register is `cdefgab`.\n    *   Heptad: `(A L K Q E I A)n` with substitutions.\n    *   `a` positions: A, A, A, A\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n2.  **Analyze Core:** The core is `a=A, d=L`. As with the first sequence, this is a canonical dimeric motif.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The sequence is designed to be a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 3: `EIAAIKQEIAAIKKEIAAIKWEIAAIKQ`**\n\n1.  **Identify Register:** We look for the hydrophobic core. The sequence is rich in Isoleucine (I) and Alanine (A). Let's test a register that places the repeating Isoleucines in the core. This is achieved with a register starting at the 2nd residue (I). The register is `abcdefg` shifted by one (`gabcdefg...`).\n    *   Heptad: `(I A A I K Q E)n`\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: I, I, I, I\n2.  **Analyze Core:** The core is `a=I, d=I`. Both core positions are occupied by Isoleucine, a bulky, beta-branched amino acid. The steric hindrance from having Isoleucine at both `a` and `d` positions is best accommodated by a parallel four-helix bundle.\n3.  **Conclusion:** This pattern is a very strong determinant for a **Tetramer (4)**.\n\n**Sequence 4: `EIQKQLKEIQKQLKEIQWQLKEIQKQLK`**\n\n1.  **Identify Register:** The hydrophobic residues are Isoleucine (I) and Leucine (L). A register that places these in the core is the most stable. Let's place `I` at `a` and `L` at `d`. This requires starting the heptad at the 3rd residue (I). The register is `fgabcdefg...`.\n    *   Heptad: `(I Q K Q L K E)n`\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: L, L, L, L\n2.  **Analyze Core:** The core is `a=I, d=L`. This is the exact core motif of the well-studied GCN4 leucine zipper, which is the archetypal parallel dimer.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The sequence is designed to be a **Dimer (2)**.\n\n**Sequence 5: `EIAQTLKEIAKTLKEIAWTLKEIAQTLK`**\n\n1.  **Identify Register:** The potential core residues are Isoleucine (I), Alanine (A), Leucine (L), and Threonine (T). Let's test a register that places Isoleucine at `a` and the beta-branched Threonine at `d`. This register starts at the 2nd residue (I). The register is `gabcdefg...`.\n    *   Heptad: `(I A Q T L K E)n`\n    *   `a` positions: I, I, I, I\n    *   `d` positions: T, T, T, T\n2.  **Analyze Core:** The core is `a=I, d=T`. Both positions are occupied by beta-branched amino acids. This combination causes steric strain in a dimer but packs favorably in a three-helix bundle. The polar hydroxyl group of Threonine can also form stabilizing hydrogen bonds within the trimeric core.\n3.  **Conclusion:** The `a=I, d=T` motif is a strong predictor of a **Trimer (3)**.\n\n### **Final Answer Synthesis**\n\n*   Sequence 1: Dimer **(2)**\n*   Sequence 2: Dimer **(2)**\n*   Sequence 3: Tetramer **(4)**\n*   Sequence 4: Dimer **(2)**\n*   Sequence 5: Trimer **(3)**\n\nThe final list of oligomeric states is: **2, 2, 4, 2, 3**. This matches option D.\n\n<<<D>>>"
