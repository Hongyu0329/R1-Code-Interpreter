    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of self-intersection points for the curve defined by the parametric equations `x(t) = cos(9t)` and `y(t) = sin(5t)`.\n\n**1. Understanding Self-Intersection Points**\n\nA self-intersection point is a point `(x, y)` on the curve that is visited at two or more different times `t`. For a point to be a self-intersection, we need to find `t1` and `t2` in the curve's period such that `t1 ≠ t2`, `x(t1) = x(t2)`, and `y(t1) = y(t2)`.\n\nThe period of `x(t) = cos(9t)` is `2π/9`.\nThe period of `y(t) = sin(5t)` is `2π/5`.\nThe period of the entire curve is the least common multiple of the individual periods, which is `LCM(2π/9, 2π/5) = 2π`. We will consider the interval `t ∈ [0, 2π)`.\n\nThe self-intersection points can be categorized into three types:\n1.  Intersections on the x-axis (where `y=0`).\n2.  Intersections on the y-axis (where `x=0`).\n3.  Intersections not on either axis (in the interior of the bounding box `[-1,1] x [-1,1]`).\n\n**2. Intersections on the x-axis**\n\nThese occur when `y(t) = 0` for at least two different `t` values that produce the same `x` value.\n`y(t) = sin(5t) = 0` implies `5t = nπ`, so `t = nπ/5` for some integer `n`.\nFor `t ∈ [0, 2π)`, `n` can be `0, 1, 2, ..., 9`.\n\nWe need to find `t1 = n1π/5` and `t2 = n2π/5` with `n1 ≠ n2` such that `x(t1) = x(t2)`.\n`cos(9n1π/5) = cos(9n2π/5)`\nThis equality holds if `9n1π/5 = ±9n2π/5 + 2kπ`, which simplifies to `9n1 = ±9n2 + 10k`.\n\n*   Case 1: `9(n1 - n2) = 10k`. Since `gcd(9, 10) = 1`, `n1 - n2` must be a multiple of 10. For `n1, n2 ∈ {0, ..., 9}`, this is only possible if `n1 = n2`, which we excluded.\n*   Case 2: `9(n1 + n2) = 10k`. `n1 + n2` must be a multiple of 10. Since `n1, n2 ∈ {0, ..., 9}` and `n1 ≠ n2`, the possible sums `n1+n2` are between 1 and 17. The only possible value for `n1+n2` is 10.\n\nThe pairs `(n1, n2)` with `n1 < n2` that sum to 10 are: `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)`.\nThese 4 pairs of `t` values create 4 intersection points on the x-axis. Let's check their x-coordinates:\n*   `x(π/5) = cos(9π/5) = cos(π/5)`\n*   `x(2π/5) = cos(18π/5) = cos(8π/5) = cos(2π/5)`\n*   `x(3π/5) = cos(27π/5) = cos(7π/5) = -cos(2π/5)`\n*   `x(4π/5) = cos(36π/5) = cos(6π/5) = -cos(π/5)`\nSince `cos(π/5) ≠ cos(2π/5)` and both are non-zero, we have four distinct points: `(±cos(π/5), 0)` and `(±cos(2π/5), 0)`.\nThere are **4** self-intersection points on the x-axis.\n\n**3. Intersections on the y-axis**\n\nThese occur when `x(t) = 0`.\n`x(t) = cos(9t) = 0` implies `9t = (n + 1/2)π`, so `t = (2n+1)π/18`.\nFor `t ∈ [0, 2π)`, `n` can be `0, 1, 2, ..., 17`.\n\nWe need `t1 = (2n1+1)π/18` and `t2 = (2n2+1)π/18` with `n1 ≠ n2` such that `y(t1) = y(t2)`.\n`sin(5(2n1+1)π/18) = sin(5(2n2+1)π/18)`\nThis equality holds if `5(2n1+1)π/18 = 5(2n2+1)π/18 + 2kπ` or `5(2n1+1)π/18 = π - 5(2n2+1)π/18 + 2kπ`.\n\n*   Case 1: `5(2(n1-n2)) = 36k`. Since `gcd(10, 36) = 2`, `5(n1-n2)=18k`. As `gcd(5,18)=1`, `n1-n2` must be a multiple of 18. For `n1, n2 ∈ {0, ..., 17}`, this is impossible.\n*   Case 2: `5(2n1+1) + 5(2n2+1) = 18(2k+1)`. `10(n1+n2+1) = 18(2k+1)`, so `5(n1+n2+1) = 9(2k+1)`. `n1+n2+1` must be a multiple of 9.\n`1 ≤ n1+n2+1 ≤ 16+17+1 = 34`. So `n1+n2+1` can be 9, 18, or 27.\nThis leads to `n1+n2 = 8`, `n1+n2 = 17`, or `n1+n2 = 26`.\n\nBy checking the distinct values of `y = sin(5(2n+1)π/18)` for these cases, we find the following set of y-coordinates for the intersection points:\n`{±sin(π/18), ±sin(5π/18), ±sin(7π/18), ±1/2, 1}`.\nNote that `y=-1` is not an intersection point on the y-axis.\nThis gives `4 * 2 + 1 = 9` distinct y-coordinates.\nThere are **9** self-intersection points on the y-axis.\n\n**4. Intersections not on the axes (Interior Intersections)**\n\nThe curve is a Lissajous figure of the form `x(t) = sin(at + δ)`, `y(t) = sin(bt)`. Here `a=9`, `b=5`, `δ=π/2`.\nFor such curves, the number of self-intersections in the open rectangle `(-1, 1) x (-1, 1)` is given by the formula `(a-1)(b-1)`.\nNumber of interior intersections = `(9-1)(5-1) = 8 * 4 = 32`.\nThese **32** points are distinct from the points on the axes.\n\n**5. Total Number of Self-Intersection Points**\n\nThe total number of self-intersection points is the sum of the points from the three categories.\nTotal N = (Intersections on x-axis) + (Intersections on y-axis) + (Interior Intersections)\nTotal N = 4 + 9 + 32 = 45.\n\nNote: The point `(0,0)` is not on the curve because `cos(9t)=0` and `sin(5t)=0` cannot be satisfied for the same `t`.\n\nFinal calculation:\n-   Points on the x-axis: 4\n-   Points on the y-axis: 9\n-   Points off the axes: 32\nTotal = 4 + 9 + 32 = 45.\n\n<<<45>>>"
