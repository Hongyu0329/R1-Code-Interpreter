    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of power subgroups in the generalized quaternion group of size 128.\n\n### **Step 1: Understand the Definitions**\n\n1.  **Generalized Quaternion Group ($Q_{4n}$):** The generalized quaternion group of order $4n$ is given by the presentation:\n    $Q_{4n} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{2n} = 1, x^n = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    For this problem, the group size is 128, so $4n = 128$, which implies $n=32$. The group is:\n    $G = Q_{128} = \\langle x, y \\mid x^{64} = 1, x^{32} = y^2, y^{-1}xy = x^{-1} \\rangle$.\n    The elements of $G$ are of two forms: $\\{x^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$ and $\\{yx^i \\mid 0 \\le i < 64\\}$.\n\n2.  **Power Subgroup:** A power subgroup of a group $G$ is a subgroup of the form $G^k$ for some integer $k$, where $G^k$ is the subgroup generated by the $k$-th powers of all elements in $G$.\n    $G^k = \\langle g^k \\mid g \\in G \\rangle$.\n    The question asks for the number of distinct subgroups in the set $\\{G^k \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$.\n\n### **Step 2: Analyze the Powers of Elements in $G = Q_{128}$**\n\nWe need to compute $g^k$ for every element $g \\in G$.\n\n*   **Case 1: Elements of the form $x^i$**\n    For an element $g = x^i$, its $k$-th power is simply $(x^i)^k = x^{ik}$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Elements of the form $yx^i$**\n    First, let's find the square of such an element:\n    $(yx^i)^2 = (yx^i)(yx^i) = y(x^i y)x^i$.\n    Using the relation $y^{-1}xy = x^{-1}$, we can derive $xy = yx^{-1}$.\n    So, $(yx^i)^2 = y(yx^{-i})x^i = y^2 x^{-i} x^i = y^2$.\n    From the group presentation, we know $y^2 = x^{32}$.\n    Therefore, for any integer $i$, $(yx^i)^2 = x^{32}$.\n    This is a crucial property. The order of any element $yx^i$ is 4, since $(yx^i)^4 = (x^{32})^2 = x^{64} = 1$.\n\n    Now, we compute the $k$-th power, $(yx^i)^k$:\n    *   If $k$ is **even**, let $k = 2m$.\n        $(yx^i)^k = (yx^i)^{2m} = ((yx^i)^2)^m = (x^{32})^m = x^{32m}$.\n    *   If $k$ is **odd**, let $k = 2m+1$.\n        $(yx^i)^k = (yx^i)^{2m}(yx^i) = x^{32m}(yx^i)$.\n\n### **Step 3: Determine the Structure of the Power Subgroup $G^k$**\n\n$G^k$ is generated by all the $k$-th powers. We analyze based on the parity of $k$.\n\n*   **Case A: $k$ is odd**\n    The generators of $G^k$ include:\n    1.  $(x)^k = x^k$. Since $k$ is odd, $\\gcd(k, 64)=1$. The subgroup generated by $x^k$ is the same as the subgroup generated by $x$, i.e., $\\langle x^k \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle$. Thus, $x \\in G^k$.\n    2.  $(y)^k = y^k$. Since $k$ is odd and the order of $y$ is 4, $y^k$ is either $y$ or $y^3$. If $y^k=y^3=yx^{32}$, since $x \\in G^k$ (and thus $x^{32} \\in G^k$), it follows that $y = (yx^{32})(x^{32})^{-1} \\in G^k$. In either case, $y \\in G^k$.\n    Since both generators $x$ and $y$ are in $G^k$, the subgroup they generate is the entire group $G$.\n    So, for any odd integer $k$, $G^k = G$. This gives us **one** distinct power subgroup.\n\n*   **Case B: $k$ is even**\n    Let $k=2m$. The generators of $G^k$ are:\n    1.  Powers of elements from $\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{ (x^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\} = \\{ x^{ik} \\}$. The subgroup generated by this set is $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    2.  Powers of elements not in $\\langle x \\rangle$: $\\{ (yx^i)^k \\mid 0 \\le i < 64 \\}$. As shown before, for even $k=2m$, every such power is equal to $x^{32m}$.\n    So, $G^k = \\langle \\langle x^k \\rangle, x^{32m} \\rangle = \\langle x^k, x^{32m} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k=2m$, we have $32m = 16 \\times (2m) = 16k$. Thus, $x^{32m} = (x^k)^{16}$, which is already an element of $\\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n    Therefore, for any even integer $k$, $G^k = \\langle x^k \\rangle$.\n\n### **Step 4: Count the Distinct Power Subgroups**\n\nWe now count the number of unique subgroups found in Step 3.\n\n1.  From odd $k$, we found one subgroup: $G = Q_{128}$.\n\n2.  From even $k$, we found subgroups of the form $\\langle x^k \\rangle$. We need to find how many distinct subgroups this form represents.\n    The subgroup $\\langle x \\rangle$ is a cyclic group of order 64. Its subgroups are of the form $\\langle x^d \\rangle$ where $d$ is a divisor of 64. The set of divisors is $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    The subgroup $\\langle x^k \\rangle$ is identical to $\\langle x^{\\gcd(k, 64)} \\rangle$.\n    Since $k$ must be even, let's find the possible values for $d = \\gcd(k, 64)$. If $k$ is even, $d$ must also be an even divisor of 64.\n    The even divisors of 64 are $\\{2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64\\}$.\n    For each of these divisors $d$, we can choose $k=d$ (which is even) to get $\\gcd(d, 64)=d$. So, all these subgroups are indeed power subgroups:\n    *   $d=2$: $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ (Order 32)\n    *   $d=4$: $\\langle x^4 \\rangle$ (Order 16)\n    *   $d=8$: $\\langle x^8 \\rangle$ (Order 8)\n    *   $d=16$: $\\langle x^{16} \\rangle$ (Order 4)\n    *   $d=32$: $\\langle x^{32} \\rangle$ (Order 2)\n    *   $d=64$: $\\langle x^{64} \\rangle = \\{1\\}$ (The trivial subgroup, Order 1)\n    This gives **six** distinct power subgroups. These are all proper cyclic subgroups of $G$ and are therefore distinct from $G$ itself.\n\n### **Step 5: Final Conclusion**\n\nThe set of all distinct power subgroups of $Q_{128}$ is the union of the results from the odd and even cases:\n$\\{ G \\} \\cup \\{ \\langle x^2 \\rangle, \\langle x^4 \\rangle, \\langle x^8 \\rangle, \\langle x^{16} \\rangle, \\langle x^{32} \\rangle, \\{1\\} \\}$.\nThe total number of these distinct subgroups is $1 + 6 = 7$.\n\n<<<7>>>"
