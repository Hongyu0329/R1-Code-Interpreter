    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Terminology**\n*   **Cambré Derrière:** A fundamental ballet movement where the dancer bends their upper body backward from the waist. \"Cambré\" means \"arched,\" and \"derrière\" means \"to the back.\"\n*   **Vaganova Method:** A Russian ballet technique developed by Agrippina Vaganova. It is renowned for its precision, strength, systematic approach, and emphasis on core stability and correct anatomical placement.\n*   **Balanchine Method:** An American ballet technique developed by George Balanchine. It is characterized by its speed, musicality, long lines, and often more extreme or dynamic movements.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Execution of Cambré Derrière in the Vaganova Method**\n*   **Core Principle:** Stability and control.\n*   **Initiation:** The bend originates from the upper back (thoracic spine). The dancer lifts up and out of the waist before arching back.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is a crucial point. In the Vaganova method, the hips must remain perfectly still and square to the front. The pelvis acts as a stable anchor. Pushing the hips forward is strictly forbidden as it is believed to strain the lower back and compromise the pure line of the upper body's arch.\n*   **Resulting Shape:** A clean, controlled arch in the upper and middle spine, supported by a strong and stable lower body.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Execution of Cambré Derrière in the Balanchine Method**\n*   **Core Principle:** Dynamism and creating a visually dramatic line.\n*   **Initiation:** Similar to Vaganova, the movement involves an upward lift, but it is often executed with more speed and a sense of release.\n*   **Hip Placement:** This is the defining difference. In the Balanchine style, the dancer is encouraged to press the hips forward as the torso bends backward.\n*   **Resulting Shape:** This forward hip action creates a deep, continuous \"C\" curve throughout the entire body. It allows for a visually deeper and more extreme backbend than the Vaganova method typically produces.\n\n**Step 4: Compare the Two Methods and Evaluate the Answer Choices**\nBased on the analysis, the most significant and fundamental difference between the two styles for this specific step is the action of the hips. Let's review the choices in light of this:\n\n*   **A. Arm placement during allongé:** While arm styling might differ slightly, the fundamental rules for arm placement in relation to the body are not the primary distinction.\n*   **B. Placement of hip:** This is the core technical difference. Vaganova insists on stationary hips, while Balanchine encourages a forward press of the hips. This is the most accurate answer.\n*   **C. Speed:** While Balanchine's style is often faster, a cambré can be performed slowly in his style or quickly in a Vaganova exercise. Speed is a general characteristic, not the defining technical difference of this specific movement's execution.\n*   **D. Degree of backbend:** The difference in the degree of the backbend is a *result* of the different hip placements. The Balanchine method allows for a deeper bend *because* the hips move forward. Therefore, the hip placement is the cause, making it the more fundamental point of difference.\n*   **E. Placement of head:** In both methods, the head follows the line of the spine. Any difference would be a subtle stylistic quality rather than a core technical rule.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe most critical and taught difference in the execution of a cambré derrière between the Vaganova and Balanchine methods is the placement and action of the hips.\n\n<<<B>>>"
