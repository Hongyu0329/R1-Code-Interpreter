    "Answering this question requires knowledge of the classification of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over number fields, specifically over quadratic fields.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Understand the object of study:** We are looking at the torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve, denoted $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$. This is the set of points of finite order on an elliptic curve $E$. When the points have coordinates in a number field $K$, this forms a finite abelian group. The structure of this group is known to be of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/N_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N_2\\mathbb{Z}$ for integers $N_1, N_2$ with $N_1$ dividing $N_2$.\n2.  **Identify the specific number field:** The base field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$. This is a quadratic imaginary field. It is also the cyclotomic field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_3)$ containing the 3rd roots of unity. The group of roots of unity in $K$ is $\\mu_6$, the 6th roots of unity.\n3.  **Condition for non-cyclic group:** A group of the form $\\mathbb{Z}/N_1\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/N_2\\mathbb{Z}$ is non-cyclic if and only if $N_1 > 1$.\n4.  **Recall the classification of torsion subgroups over quadratic fields:** While Mazur's theorem classifies the 15 possible torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}$, a more general classification exists for quadratic fields. The complete list of possible torsion subgroups $E(K)_{\\text{tors}}$ for an elliptic curve $E$ over any quadratic field $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ was determined by the work of Kamienny, Kenku, and Momose. The possible structures depend on the discriminant $d$ of the field.\n5.  **Find the specific classification for $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$:** For the specific field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ (where $d=-3$), the classification provides a list of all possible torsion subgroups. We are interested in those that are non-cyclic. According to the known classification (for example, as compiled in surveys like √Ålvaro Lozano-Robledo's \"Torsion of elliptic curves over number fields\"), the possible non-cyclic torsion subgroups over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ are:\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n    *   $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$\n\n    **Careful points:**\n    *   The classification is exhaustive, meaning no other non-cyclic torsion structures can occur over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$.\n    *   The special nature of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ (containing $\\mu_6$) is what allows for the more exotic groups involving 3-torsion and 6-torsion, like $\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$. For example, the existence of a subgroup isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^2$ implies via the Weil pairing that the field must contain the $n$-th roots of unity. Since $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$ contains $\\mu_3$ and $\\mu_6$, these groups are plausible. The classification confirms they indeed occur.\n\n6.  **Calculate the orders of the possible non-cyclic subgroups:** We now compute the order (the number of elements) for each group in the list from the previous step.\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 2 = 4$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 4 = 8$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 6 = 12$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/12\\mathbb{Z}| = 2 \\times 12 = 24$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 3 = 9$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/3\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 3 \\times 6 = 18$\n    *   $|\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}| = 6 \\times 6 = 36$\n\n7.  **Identify the largest order:** The question asks for the largest order among these possibilities. Comparing the calculated orders: {4, 8, 12, 24, 9, 18, 36}. The maximum value is 36.\n\n**Final Answer Acquisition:**\nThe final answer is the largest value found in the step-by-step analysis. Based on the complete classification of torsion subgroups for elliptic curves over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-3})$, the largest possible order for a non-cyclic torsion subgroup is 36, corresponding to the group structure $\\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}/6\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\n<<<36>>>"
