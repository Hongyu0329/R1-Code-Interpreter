    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel.\n\n### Step 1: Define the Pauli Channel and its Kraus Operators\n\nA Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (a qudit) is a quantum channel that can be written in the form:\n$$ \\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{jk} U_{jk} \\rho U_{jk}^\\dagger $$\nwhere:\n*   $\\rho$ is a $d \\times d$ density matrix.\n*   $\\{U_{jk} | j,k \\in \\{0, \\dots, d-1\\}\\}$ is the set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators (or Weyl-Heisenberg operators). These operators are unitary and form an orthonormal basis for the space of $d \\times d$ matrices.\n*   $\\{p_{jk}\\}$ is a probability distribution, meaning $p_{jk} \\ge 0$ and $\\sum_{j,k} p_{jk} = 1$.\n\nThe Kraus representation of this channel is given by the set of operators $\\{E_{jk}\\}$ where:\n$$ E_{jk} = \\sqrt{p_{jk}} U_{jk} $$\nFor simplicity, we can use a single index $\\alpha$ to represent the pair $(j,k)$, where $\\alpha$ runs from $1$ to $d^2$. The Kraus operators are then written as $E_\\alpha = \\sqrt{p_\\alpha} U_\\alpha$.\n\n### Step 2: Define the Complementary Channel and its Rank\n\nGiven a channel $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_\\alpha E_\\alpha \\rho E_\\alpha^\\dagger$, its complementary channel, denoted by $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, describes the information that leaks into the environment. The output of the complementary channel is a state in the environment space.\n\nA fundamental result in quantum information theory relates the rank of a channel (defined as the rank of its Choi matrix) to its Kraus operators. The rank of the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ is given by the dimension of the vector space spanned by all possible products of its Kraus operators. Specifically:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ E_\\alpha^\\dagger E_\\beta \\}_{\\alpha, \\beta}) $$\n\n### Step 3: Express the Rank in Terms of Pauli Operators\n\nSubstituting the Kraus operators for the Pauli channel into the formula for the rank, we get:\n$$ E_\\alpha^\\dagger E_\\beta = (\\sqrt{p_\\alpha} U_\\alpha)^\\dagger (\\sqrt{p_\\beta} U_\\beta) = \\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta} U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta $$\nThe rank of the complementary channel is therefore:\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ \\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta} U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta \\}_{\\alpha, \\beta}) $$\n\n### Step 4: Maximize the Rank\n\nThe question asks for the *maximal* rank. The rank depends on the choice of the probability distribution $\\{p_\\alpha\\}$. To maximize the dimension of the spanned space, we should choose the probabilities such that we generate the largest possible set of linearly independent operators. This is achieved when we have the maximum number of non-zero coefficients $\\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta}$.\n\nWe can choose a probability distribution where all $p_\\alpha > 0$. For example, the completely depolarizing channel corresponds to $p_\\alpha = 1/d^2$ for all $\\alpha=1, \\dots, d^2$. In this case, all coefficients $\\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta}$ are non-zero. When all coefficients are non-zero, the span of $\\{\\sqrt{p_\\alpha p_\\beta} U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta\\}$ is the same as the span of $\\{U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta\\}$.\n\nTherefore, the maximal rank is:\n$$ \\text{max rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta \\}_{\\alpha, \\beta}) $$\n\n### Step 5: Analyze the Spanning Set of Operators\n\nNow we need to determine the dimension of the space spanned by the operators $\\{ U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta \\}$. Let's analyze this set of operators.\n\n*   **Closure Property:** The generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_\\gamma\\}$ form a group up to a phase factor. This means that the product of any two Pauli operators is another Pauli operator, multiplied by a phase. Since the $U_\\alpha$ are unitary, their adjoints $U_\\alpha^\\dagger$ are their inverses, and are also proportional to a Pauli operator. Consequently, the product $U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta$ is also proportional to some Pauli operator $U_\\gamma$.\n*   **Generating the Basis:** The set of all such products $\\{U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta\\}$ can generate the entire set of Pauli operators $\\{U_\\gamma\\}$. For example, by fixing $\\alpha$ to correspond to the identity operator ($U_0 = I$), the set $\\{U_0^\\dagger U_\\beta\\}_\\beta = \\{I U_\\beta\\}_\\beta = \\{U_\\beta\\}_\\beta$ already contains all the Pauli operators.\n*   **Conclusion on the Span:** Since every operator $U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta$ is a non-zero multiple of some $U_\\gamma$, and since we can generate all $U_\\gamma$ this way, the span of $\\{U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta\\}$ is identical to the span of the Pauli operators $\\{U_\\gamma\\}$ themselves.\n$$ \\text{span}\\{ U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta \\}_{\\alpha, \\beta} = \\text{span}\\{ U_\\gamma \\}_{\\gamma=1}^{d^2} $$\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Dimension of the Operator Space\n\nThe set of $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators $\\{U_\\gamma\\}$ is known to form a complete orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space of all $d \\times d$ complex matrices, denoted $L(\\mathbb{C}^d)$.\n\nThe dimension of a vector space is the number of elements in any of its bases. Since $\\{U_\\gamma\\}$ is a basis for $L(\\mathbb{C}^d)$ and contains $d^2$ elements, the dimension of this space is $d^2$.\n$$ \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{ U_\\gamma \\}) = \\text{dim}(L(\\mathbb{C}^d)) = d^2 $$\n\n### Step 7: Final Answer\n\nCombining the steps, the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a Pauli channel is the dimension of the space spanned by the Pauli operators.\n$$ \\text{max rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = d^2 $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   The definition of the rank of a channel as the rank of its Choi matrix is key.\n*   The formula relating the rank of the complementary channel to the span of products of Kraus operators ($\\text{rank}(\\tilde{\\Lambda}) = \\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{E_\\alpha^\\dagger E_\\beta\\})$) is the central tool for this analysis.\n*   To find the *maximal* rank, we must consider the case where the channel is a mixture of all possible Pauli errors (i.e., all $p_\\alpha > 0$).\n*   The properties of the generalized Pauli operators (forming a basis for the operator space and being a group up to phases) are essential for the final step of the argument.\n\nFinal Answer Derivation:\nThe maximal rank of the complementary channel is $\\text{dim}(\\text{span}\\{U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta\\})$. The set of operators $\\{U_\\alpha^\\dagger U_\\beta\\}$ spans the entire space of $d \\times d$ matrices, because the underlying set $\\{U_\\gamma\\}$ is a basis for this space. The dimension of the space of $d \\times d$ matrices is $d^2$."
