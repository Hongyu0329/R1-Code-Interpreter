    "This is a sequence puzzle. To solve it, we need to identify the underlying pattern.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the sequence structure**\nThe given sequence is `ZXXCVYBN_`.\nLet's try splitting the sequence into two interleaved sub-sequences, by taking letters at odd and even positions.\n*   **Odd positions (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th):** Z, X, V, B, _\n*   **Even positions (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th):** X, C, Y, N\n\nThe question asks for the next letter, which is in the 9th position. Therefore, we only need to find the pattern in the first sub-sequence: **Z, X, V, B, _**.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the pattern in the first sub-sequence**\nThe letters in this sub-sequence (Z, X, V, B) are all found on the bottom row of a standard QWERTY keyboard.\nThe bottom row of a QWERTY keyboard is: **Z X C V B N M**\n\nLet's look at the positions of our letters in this keyboard row:\n*   **Z** is the 1st letter.\n*   **X** is the 2nd letter.\n*   **V** is the 4th letter.\n*   **B** is the 5th letter.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the rule for the pattern**\nThe sequence of letters corresponds to a sequence of positions on the keyboard row: **1, 2, 4, 5**.\nLet's find the pattern in this number sequence by looking at the \"jumps\" or differences between consecutive numbers:\n*   From position 1 (Z) to position 2 (X) is a jump of **+1**.\n*   From position 2 (X) to position 4 (V) is a jump of **+2**.\n*   From position 4 (V) to position 5 (B) is a jump of **+1**.\n\nThe pattern of the jumps is **+1, +2, +1**.\n\n**Step 4: Apply the rule to find the next letter**\nThe logical continuation of the jump pattern (+1, +2, +1) is to repeat, so the next jump should be **+2**.\n*   The last letter in our sub-sequence is B, which is at position 5.\n*   Applying a jump of +2 from position 5 gives us position 5 + 2 = **7**.\n\nNow, we find the letter at the 7th position on the bottom row of the QWERTY keyboard.\n*   The 7th letter is **M**.\n\nTherefore, the next letter in the sequence Z, X, V, B, _ is M. This fills the blank in the original sequence.\n\n<<<M>>>"
