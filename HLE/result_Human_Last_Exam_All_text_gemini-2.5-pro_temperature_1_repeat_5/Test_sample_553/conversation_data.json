    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the song.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Musical Terminology**\n    *   **Tonic Chord:** This is the \"home\" chord of a song's key. It's the chord built on the first note of the scale. It is represented by the Roman numeral 'I' in a major key (e.g., C major in the key of C) or 'i' in a minor key (e.g., A minor in the key of A minor).\n    *   **Fifth Chord:** This is the chord built on the fifth note of the scale. In most Western music, this chord is typically a major chord (represented as 'V') because it creates strong harmonic tension that resolves back to the tonic. For example, in the key of C major or C minor, the fifth note is G, and the standard fifth chord is G major.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord:** This is the specific type of chord requested. It means the chord built on the fifth note of the scale is a *minor* chord (represented as 'v'). This is less common than a major fifth chord and creates a different, often more melancholic or passive, mood. For example, in the key of F, the fifth note is C. A minor fifth chord would be C minor.\n    *   **Chord Jump:** This implies a direct and prominent change from one chord to the next, right at the beginning of the song.\n\n2.  **Search for the Progression in The Beatles' Catalog**\n    We are looking for a song that opens with the progression **i -> v** (in a minor key) or **I -> v** (in a major key). The progression in a minor key (i -> v) is more diatonic and thus more likely.\n\n3.  **Identify the Candidate Song: \"Michelle\"**\n    The song that famously uses this exact progression in its introduction is \"Michelle\" from the 1965 album *Rubber Soul*.\n\n4.  **Analyze the Introduction of \"Michelle\"**\n    *   **Key:** The song's verse is in the key of F minor.\n    *   **Tonic Chord (i):** The song begins with a beautiful fingerpicked guitar intro. The very first chord established is **F minor (Fm)**. This is the tonic chord of the key.\n    *   **Minor Fifth Chord (v):** The progression immediately moves to the next chord. The fifth note of the F minor scale is C. The chord Paul McCartney plays next is **C minor (Cm)**. This is the minor fifth chord.\n    *   **The \"Jump\":** The opening musical phrase is built on this clear harmonic movement from Fm to Cm. This \"jump\" from the tonic to the minor fifth sets the song's distinctive, slightly somber, and romantic mood.\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **V vs. v:** It is crucial to distinguish between a major fifth (V) and a minor fifth (v). The Beatles, like most pop/rock artists, frequently used the standard I-V or i-V progression. The use of a minor fifth (i-v) in \"Michelle\" is a specific and sophisticated harmonic choice that makes the introduction unique.\n*   **The Start of the Song:** The question specifies the song *starts* with this progression. The intro to \"Michelle\" is one of the most recognizable in their catalog and is defined entirely by this harmonic movement.\n*   **Another Potential Candidate:** Some might point to \"And I Love Her,\" whose famous guitar riff outlines an F# minor chord followed by a C# minor chord. This is also a i -> v progression. However, the introduction of \"Michelle\" is a clearer example of a \"chord jump,\" where the full harmony of the chords is presented in a descending arpeggio, making the progression the undeniable foundation of the intro. \"Michelle\" is the most cited and definitive answer for this specific question.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe song \"Michelle\" starts in the key of F minor. Its iconic introduction features a direct chordal movement from the tonic chord, F minor (i), to the minor fifth chord, C minor (v).\n\n<<<Michelle>>>"
