    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Reactant and Reaction Type\n*   **Reactant:** The starting material is \\((2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)\\)-deca-2,4,6,8-tetraene.\n*   **π System:** This is a conjugated tetraene, so the reacting system involves 8 π electrons (4 pairs). This is a 4n system where n=2.\n*   **Reaction Type:** The reaction is described as producing two isomeric cyclized products, A (cis) and B (trans), under thermal conditions. This is a thermal electrocyclic ring-closing reaction. An octatetraene system will close to form a cyclooctatriene ring. The substituents at the termini of the conjugated system (C2 and C9) are methyl groups. The products are *cis*- and *trans*-7,8-dimethylcycloocta-1,3,5-triene.\n\n### Step 2: Apply Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Theory for Mode of Cyclization\n*   According to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules for electrocyclic reactions, the stereochemical mode (conrotatory or disrotatory) is determined by the number of π electrons and the reaction conditions (thermal or photochemical).\n*   **System:** 8 π electrons (a 4n system).\n*   **Condition:** Thermal.\n*   **Rule:** For a 4n π electron system under thermal conditions, the reaction is symmetry-allowed only if it proceeds through a **conrotatory** motion.\n*   **FMO Justification:** For a thermal reaction, we analyze the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO). For octatetraene (8 π electrons), the HOMO is ψ₄. The symmetry of ψ₄ is such that the p-orbitals at the termini have opposite phases. To achieve constructive (bonding) overlap, the termini must rotate in the same direction (both clockwise or both counter-clockwise), which is a conrotatory motion.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Stereochemistry of the Reactant's Termini\n*   To predict the stereochemistry of the product, we must first establish the relative orientation of the substituents at the termini (C2 and C9) in the reactive conformation (a helical, C-shaped geometry).\n*   The substituents at C2 and C9 are a methyl group (Me) and a hydrogen atom (H).\n*   **At C2:** The double bond C2=C3 has (Z) geometry. This means the methyl group (C1) is *cis* to the rest of the carbon chain (C4). In the reactive C-shape, cis substituents are considered to point \"inward\". So, at C2, we have **Me(in)** and **H(out)**.\n*   **At C9:** The double bond C8=C9 has (E) geometry. This means the methyl group (C10) is *trans* to the rest of the carbon chain (C7). In the reactive C-shape, trans substituents are considered to point \"outward\". So, at C9, we have **Me(out)** and **H(in)**.\n*   Therefore, the reactant has an **\"in, out\"** arrangement of the methyl substituents.\n\n### Step 4: Predict the Stereochemistry of the Products\nWe now analyze the stereochemical outcome for the allowed (conrotatory) and forbidden (disrotatory) pathways for this \"in, out\" system.\n\n*   **Allowed Conrotatory Pathway:**\n    *   For an \"in, out\" system, a conrotatory closure leads to a **cis** relationship between the two substituents (in this case, the two methyl groups).\n    *   This pathway has a lower activation energy due to being orbitally allowed.\n    *   Therefore, the major product should be the **cis-isomer (A)**.\n    *   **Pathway: (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-tetraene --(Conrotation, Allowed)--> cis-isomer A**\n\n*   **Forbidden Disrotatory Pathway:**\n    *   The problem states that the trans-isomer (B) is also formed. This product must arise from a higher-energy, symmetry-forbidden pathway.\n    *   For an \"in, out\" system, a disrotatory closure leads to a **trans** relationship between the two substituents.\n    *   This pathway is orbitally forbidden and thus has a higher activation energy.\n    *   Therefore, the minor product should be the **trans-isomer (B)**.\n    *   **Pathway: (2Z,4Z,6Z,8E)-tetraene --(Disrotation, Forbidden)--> trans-isomer B**\n\n### Step 5: Predict the Ratio of A and B\n*   The ratio of products is determined by the difference in the free energies of activation (ΔΔG‡) for the two competing pathways, according to the Curtin-Hammett principle.\n*   The pathway to A (cis) is symmetry-allowed.\n*   The pathway to B (trans) is symmetry-forbidden.\n*   The activation energy for an allowed pericyclic reaction is significantly lower than for a forbidden one. The energy penalty for a forbidden pathway is substantial.\n*   Therefore, the reaction will overwhelmingly favor the allowed pathway.\n*   This means the formation of **cis-isomer A will be heavily favored over the trans-isomer B**.\n*   The ratio of A:B should be significantly greater than 1. In cases where an allowed pathway competes with a forbidden one, selectivity is typically high. A ratio of **9:1** is a common and reasonable prediction for such strong kinetic preference.\n\n### Final Conclusion\nThe major product is the cis-isomer A, formed via the symmetry-allowed conrotatory pathway. The minor product is the trans-isomer B, formed via the symmetry-forbidden disrotatory pathway. The ratio A:B is predicted to be 9:1.\n\n<<<9:1>>>"
