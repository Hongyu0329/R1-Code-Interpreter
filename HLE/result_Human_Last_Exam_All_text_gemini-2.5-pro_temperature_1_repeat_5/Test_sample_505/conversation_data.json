    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics of a Single Surface Code Patch\n\nA standard, planar patch of surface code (topologically equivalent to a disk) with no holes has boundaries. These boundaries allow for the definition of one set of logical operators (e.g., a logical X operator stretching from a \"smooth\" boundary to another \"smooth\" boundary, and a logical Z operator stretching from a \"rough\" boundary to another \"rough\" boundary). Therefore:\n*   **A single surface code patch with 0 holes encodes 1 logical qubit.**\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Role of Holes\n\nIntroducing a hole (also known as a defect or a puncture) into the surface code patch creates a new internal boundary. This allows for the definition of new logical operators that are topologically distinct from the original ones and from each other. For example, a logical operator can be a loop around a hole, or a string connecting a hole to a boundary, or a string connecting two different holes.\nThe key principle is:\n*   **Each hole added to a single surface code patch increases the number of logical qubits it can encode by one.**\n\nCombining these two points, the number of logical qubits (`k`) in a single patch with `N_h` holes is given by the formula:\n*   `k = 1 (for the patch itself) + N_h (for the number of holes)`\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Given System\n\nThe question specifies a system composed of:\n1.  **Two separate patches of surface code.**\n2.  **A total of two holes** to be distributed across these patches.\n\nSince the two patches are separate physical systems, the total number of logical qubits is simply the sum of the logical qubits encoded in each patch. We need to find the distribution of the two holes that maximizes this total number.\n\nLet's denote the number of logical qubits in patch 1 as `k_1` and in patch 2 as `k_2`. Let the number of holes in each patch be `h_1` and `h_2`, respectively.\n\n*   `k_1 = 1 + h_1`\n*   `k_2 = 1 + h_2`\n*   The total number of logical qubits is `K_total = k_1 + k_2 = (1 + h_1) + (1 + h_2)`.\n*   We are given that the total number of holes is two: `h_1 + h_2 = 2`.\n\nSubstituting the total number of holes into the equation for the total qubits:\n*   `K_total = 2 + (h_1 + h_2)`\n*   `K_total = 2 + 2 = 4`\n\n### Step 4: Verify with Possible Distributions\n\nTo be certain, let's check the two possible ways to distribute the two holes and see if it affects the outcome.\n\n*   **Case A: Both holes in one patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has `h_1 = 2` holes. The number of logical qubits is `k_1 = 1 + 2 = 3`.\n    *   Patch 2 has `h_2 = 0` holes. The number of logical qubits is `k_2 = 1 + 0 = 1`.\n    *   Total logical qubits = `k_1 + k_2 = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\n*   **Case B: One hole in each patch.**\n    *   Patch 1 has `h_1 = 1` hole. The number of logical qubits is `k_1 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Patch 2 has `h_2 = 1` hole. The number of logical qubits is `k_2 = 1 + 1 = 2`.\n    *   Total logical qubits = `k_1 + k_2 = 2 + 2 = 4`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth possible distributions of the two holes result in the same total number of logical qubits. Therefore, the maximum number of logical qubits that can be encoded is 4.\n\n**Summary of careful points:**\n*   A single patch with no holes encodes 1 qubit, not 0.\n*   Each hole adds exactly one additional qubit capacity to its patch.\n*   The total number of qubits is the sum of qubits from each independent patch.\n*   The phrasing \"with two holes\" implies a total of two holes for the entire system, not two holes per patch.\n*   The distribution of holes among the patches does not affect the total number of logical qubits, so the maximum is the same as any other configuration.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation: (1 qubit for Patch 1 + 1 qubit for Patch 2) + (1 qubit for Hole 1 + 1 qubit for Hole 2) = 4 logical qubits.\n\n<<<4>>>"
