    "Answering this question requires understanding the theory of decoupling inequalities in harmonic analysis, particularly for curves.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Identify the mathematical object and its properties:**\n    The question asks for the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n    First, we need to determine the type of this curve. A crucial property for decoupling theory is \"non-degeneracy\". A curve $\\gamma(t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is non-degenerate if its first $n$ derivatives are linearly independent. For our curve in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ (so $n=3$), we compute the derivatives:\n    *   $\\gamma'(t) = (-\\sin t, \\cos t, 1)$\n    *   $\\gamma''(t) = (-\\cos t, -\\sin t, 0)$\n    *   $\\gamma'''(t) = (\\sin t, -\\cos t, 0)$\n    To check for linear independence, we compute the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors:\n    $$ \\det(\\gamma', \\gamma'', \\gamma''') = \\begin{vmatrix} -\\sin t & \\cos t & 1 \\\\ -\\cos t & -\\sin t & 0 \\\\ \\sin t & -\\cos t & 0 \\end{vmatrix} = 1 \\cdot ((-\\cos t)(-\\cos t) - (-\\sin t)(\\sin t)) = \\cos^2 t + \\sin^2 t = 1 $$\n    Since the determinant is $1 \\neq 0$ for all $t$, the curve is non-degenerate.\n\n2.  **Universality of the decoupling exponent:**\n    A fundamental result in decoupling theory, established by Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth, is that the sharp decoupling exponent is the same for all non-degenerate curves in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This means our curve has the same decoupling exponent as the standard moment curve, $\\Gamma(t) = (t, t^2, t^3)$. This simplifies the problem, as we can refer to the extensive literature on the moment curve.\n\n3.  **Define the decoupling exponent:**\n    There are several equivalent ways to formulate the decoupling inequality, leading to different-looking exponents. A standard formulation, which we will call the $(\\delta, N)$-formulation, is as follows:\n    *   Partition the interval $[0,1]$ into $N$ equal subintervals $I_j$.\n    *   Let $f_j$ be a function whose Fourier transform $\\hat{f}_j$ is supported in a $\\delta$-neighborhood of the corresponding piece of the curve $\\gamma(I_j)$.\n    *   The $l^2$ decoupling inequality is of the form:\n        $$ \\left\\| \\sum_{j=1}^N f_j \\right\\|_{L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)} \\leq C_{\\epsilon} N^{\\epsilon} (\\delta^{-1})^{s_n(p)} \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^N \\|f_j\\|_{L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)}^2 \\right)^{1/2} $$\n    The function $s_n(p)$ is the sharp decoupling exponent.\n\n4.  **Interpret the question:**\n    The question asks for \"the sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent\". This is usually interpreted as the value of the exponent function $s_n(p)$ at the critical Lebesgue exponent $p_n$. This exponent marks a phase transition in the behavior of the inequality. For a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this critical exponent is given by the Stein-Tomas exponent for a hypersurface:\n    $$ p_n = \\frac{2(n+1)}{n-1} $$\n    For our problem, $n=3$, so the critical exponent is:\n    $$ p_3 = \\frac{2(3+1)}{3-1} = \\frac{8}{2} = 4 $$\n    Thus, the question is asking for the value of $s_3(4)$.\n\n5.  **Find the formula for the sharp exponent:**\n    The main result of Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth provides the sharp exponent $s_n(p)$. The formula for $s_n(p)$ is piecewise.\n    For the range $2 \\leq p \\leq p_n$, the sharp exponent is determined by so-called bilinear estimates. For a non-degenerate curve in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, this is given by:\n    $$ s_n(p) = \\frac{p-2}{4} \\quad \\text{for } 2 \\leq p \\leq p_n $$\n    For $p > p_n$, the formula is different and was the main breakthrough of the BDG work. However, for this question, we only need the value at $p=p_n=4$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the final answer:**\n    We need to compute $s_3(4)$. Using the formula for the range $2 \\leq p \\leq 4$:\n    $$ s_3(4) = \\frac{4-2}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n**Careful Points:**\n*   It is crucial to correctly identify the curve as non-degenerate to use the universal result for the moment curve.\n*   Understanding that the question asks for the exponent at the specific critical value $p_3=4$ is key. A full description of the function $s_3(p)$ is more complex.\n*   The literature on decoupling contains many different scaling conventions, leading to formulas for the exponent that can look very different. Sticking to one consistent formulation, like the $(\\delta, N)$ formulation used here, is important.\n*   There is a known subtlety where the formula for $s_n(p)$ for $p > p_n$ given by some proofs does not continuously connect to the value at $p_n$. The value at the critical point $p_n$ is correctly given by the formula for the range $2 \\le p \\le p_n$. The sharp value is $s_n(p_n) = \\frac{p_n-2}{4} = \\frac{1}{n-1}$. For $n=3$, this is $1/2$.\n\n**Final Answer Calculation:**\nThe sharp $l^2$ decoupling exponent for the non-degenerate curve $\\gamma(t) = (\\cos t, \\sin t, t)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ at the critical Lebesgue exponent $p=4$ is given by the formula $s_3(p) = (p-2)/4$.\nPlugging in $p=4$, we get:\n$$ s_3(4) = \\frac{4-2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n<<<1/2>>>"
