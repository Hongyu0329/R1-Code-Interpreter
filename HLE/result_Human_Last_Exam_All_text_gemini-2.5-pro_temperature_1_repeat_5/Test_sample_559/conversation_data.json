    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the separatrix of the given system of differential equations.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the System and Find Equilibrium Points**\n\nThe system is given by:\n$$d'(t) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$$\n$$u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$$\nWe are considering the phase plane $(u, d)$ for $u \\geq 0$.\n\nEquilibrium points (or critical points) are points where both derivatives are zero, i.e., $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$.\n\nFirst, set $u'(t) = 0$:\n$u^2(u-1) = 0$\nThis gives us two possible values for $u$: $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding $d$ values for each $u$ by setting $d'(t) = 0$.\n\n*   **Case 1: u = 0**\n    Substitute $u=0$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0^3(1-0) = 0$\n    $2d^2 = 0 \\implies d=0$\n    So, one equilibrium point is **(0, 0)**.\n\n*   **Case 2: u = 1**\n    Substitute $u=1$ into the equation for $d'(t)$:\n    $d' = 2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0$\n    $2d^2 + 2d = 0$\n    $2d(d+1) = 0 \\implies d=0$ or $d=-1$.\n    So, two more equilibrium points are **(1, 0)** and **(1, -1)**.\n\nIn summary, the equilibrium points are (0, 0), (1, 0), and (1, -1).\n\n**Step 2: Classify the Equilibrium Points**\n\nTo classify the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system. Let $F(u,d) = u^3 - u^2$ and $G(u,d) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J(u,d)$ is:\n$$ J(u, d) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial d} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u} & \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial d} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3u^2 - 2u & 0 \\\\ -3d + 10ud - 3u^2 + 4u^3 & 4d - 3u + 5u^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the Jacobian at each non-degenerate equilibrium point.\n\n*   **At (1, 0):**\n    $$ J(1, 0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ -3(0) + 10(1)(0) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(0) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries, $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. Since both are positive, **(1, 0) is an unstable node (source)**.\n\n*   **At (1, -1):**\n    $$ J(1, -1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 3(1)^2 - 2(1) & 0 \\\\ -3(-1) + 10(1)(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 & 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ -6 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -2$. Since the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs, **(1, -1) is a saddle point**.\n\n*   **At (0, 0):**\n    $J(0,0)$ is the zero matrix, so this is a degenerate point. Linearization is inconclusive.\n\n**Step 3: Find the Separatrix**\n\nA separatrix is a trajectory that separates regions of different qualitative behaviors. Separatrices are the stable and unstable manifolds of saddle points. We are looking for the equation of the curve(s) that emanate from or lead into the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nThe slope of a trajectory in the phase plane is given by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\nThis is a Riccati differential equation, which is generally difficult to solve. However, systems in such problems often have a simple particular solution that acts as an invariant manifold. Let's test for a simple polynomial curve that passes through the saddle point (1, -1).\n\nLet's test the candidate curve $d = -u^2$.\n1.  **Check if it passes through the saddle point (1, -1):** For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. Yes, it passes through (1, -1).\n2.  **Check if it is a solution to the ODE:** We need to verify if $d=-u^2$ satisfies $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)}$.\n    *   **Left-Hand Side (LHS):** $\\frac{d}{du}(-u^2) = -2u$.\n    *   **Right-Hand Side (RHS):** Substitute $d = -u^2$ into the expression:\n        $$ \\text{RHS} = \\frac{2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n        $$ = \\frac{2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) + (-u^3 + u^4)}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n        $$ = \\frac{(2 - 5 + 1)u^4 + (3 - 1)u^3}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n        $$ = \\frac{-2u^4 + 2u^3}{u^2(u-1)} $$\n        $$ = \\frac{-2u^3(u - 1)}{u^2(u - 1)} $$\n        For $u \\neq 0$ and $u \\neq 1$, this simplifies to:\n        $$ = -2u $$\n    Since LHS = RHS, the curve $d = -u^2$ is an exact solution trajectory of the system.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\nThe curve $d = -u^2$ is an invariant manifold of the system. It passes through the saddle point (1, -1) and another equilibrium point (0, 0). Such a curve connecting equilibrium points, especially one associated with a saddle, acts as a separatrix, dividing the phase plane into regions with different long-term behaviors. Trajectories on one side of this curve will evolve differently than trajectories on the other side.\n\nTherefore, the separatrix of the system is the curve defined by the equation $d = -u^2$.\n\n<<<d = -u^2>>>"
