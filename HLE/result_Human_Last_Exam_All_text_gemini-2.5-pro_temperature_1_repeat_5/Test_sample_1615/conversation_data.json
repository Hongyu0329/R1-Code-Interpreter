    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximum number of colours needed.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe question asks for the maximum possible chromatic number, denoted as $\\chi(G)$, for a graph $G$ that has the following properties:\n1.  The number of vertices is $n = 12345$.\n2.  The graph $G$ is not a complete graph ($G \\neq K_{12345}$).\n\nThe chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ is the minimum number of colours required for a proper vertex colouring, where no two adjacent vertices share the same colour. The question is asking for the maximum value that $\\chi(G)$ can take across all graphs that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n### Step 2: Listing Careful Points and Key Concepts\n1.  **Chromatic Number ($\\chi(G)$):** The minimum number of colours for a proper vertex colouring.\n2.  **Complete Graph ($K_n$):** A graph with $n$ vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge.\n3.  **Fundamental Property of Chromatic Number:** For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its chromatic number is at most $n$, i.e., $\\chi(G) \\le n$.\n4.  **Condition for Maximum Chromatic Number:** The maximum chromatic number $\\chi(G) = n$ is achieved if and only if the graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$.\n5.  **The Constraint:** The crucial piece of information is that our graph $G$ is *not* the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n6.  **Goal:** We need to find $\\max \\{ \\chi(G) \\mid |V(G)|=12345 \\text{ and } G \\neq K_{12345} \\}$.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Establish an Upper Bound:**\n    *   We know that for any graph $G$ with $n=12345$ vertices, the chromatic number is at most 12345. So, $\\chi(G) \\le 12345$.\n    *   We also know that $\\chi(G) = 12345$ only if $G$ is the complete graph $K_{12345}$.\n    *   The problem explicitly states that $G$ is *not* the complete graph.\n    *   Therefore, the chromatic number of $G$ must be strictly less than 12345.\n    *   Since the chromatic number must be an integer, this gives us an upper bound: $\\chi(G) \\le 12344$.\n\n2.  **Check if this Upper Bound is Achievable:**\n    *   Now, we need to determine if there exists a graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, for which the chromatic number is exactly 12344. If we can find such a graph, then we have proven that 12344 is the maximum possible value.\n    *   Let's try to construct such a graph. Consider a graph $G$ that is made of two disconnected components:\n        *   A complete graph on 12344 vertices, let's call it $K_{12344}$.\n        *   A single isolated vertex, which is a complete graph on 1 vertex, $K_1$.\n    *   Let's verify the properties of this constructed graph $G = K_{12344} \\cup K_1$:\n        *   **Number of vertices:** The total number of vertices is $12344 + 1 = 12345$. This matches the condition.\n        *   **Is it a complete graph?** No. For a graph to be $K_{12345}$, every vertex must be connected to every other vertex. In our constructed graph, the isolated vertex is not connected to any of the vertices in the $K_{12344}$ component. Thus, $G \\neq K_{12345}$. This also matches the condition.\n        *   **What is its chromatic number?** The chromatic number of a disconnected graph is the maximum of the chromatic numbers of its connected components.\n            *   $\\chi(K_{12344}) = 12344$.\n            *   $\\chi(K_1) = 1$.\n            *   Therefore, $\\chi(G) = \\max(\\chi(K_{12344}), \\chi(K_1)) = \\max(12344, 1) = 12344$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   We have shown that for any graph $G$ with 12345 vertices that is not complete, its chromatic number can be at most 12344.\n    *   We have also constructed a specific graph that satisfies these conditions and has a chromatic number of exactly 12344.\n    *   Therefore, the maximum number of colours that we might need is 12344. The reference to the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ in the problem statement is a feature of such graphs, but it is not directly needed to find the maximum possible chromatic number, which is a more direct approach. For our constructed graph $G=K_{12344} \\cup K_1$, the maximum degree is $\\Delta(G) = 12343$ (the degree of any vertex in the $K_{12344}$ component).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe maximum number of colours needed is the maximum possible chromatic number for a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph. Based on the analysis, this value is $12345 - 1 = 12344$.\n\n<<<12344>>>"
