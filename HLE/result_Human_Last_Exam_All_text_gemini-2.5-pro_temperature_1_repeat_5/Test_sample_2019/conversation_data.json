    "Answering this question requires a step-by-step analysis of the constraints imposed by the toroidal chessboard.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Board and Constraints\n\n*   **Board:** A 5x5 grid, where the edges wrap around. We can model the squares using coordinates `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are integers from 0 to 4 (or 1 to 5). Using 0 to 4 is often easier for modular arithmetic. All calculations will be modulo 5.\n*   **Queens:** We need to place 4 queens.\n*   **Non-attacking:** Two queens at `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` are non-attacking if they do not share a row, column, or diagonal.\n    1.  **Row/Column Attack:** `r1 ≠ r2` and `c1 ≠ c2`. This is the same as a standard board.\n    2.  **Diagonal Attack (Toroidal):** On a toroidal board, the diagonal attack condition is defined using modular arithmetic. Two queens attack each other if:\n        *   `r1 - c1 ≡ r2 - c2 (mod 5)` (main diagonals)\n        *   `r1 + c1 ≡ r2 + c2 (mod 5)` (anti-diagonals)\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the Problem\n\nSince we are placing 4 queens, the row/column constraint implies that all 4 queens must be in different rows and different columns.\n\n1.  **Choosing Rows and Columns:** We must choose 4 distinct rows out of 5 and 4 distinct columns out of 5.\n    *   Number of ways to choose 4 rows: `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n    *   Number of ways to choose 4 columns: `C(5, 4) = 5`.\n\n2.  **Defining a Subgrid:** Any valid placement of 4 queens must lie on a 4x4 subgrid defined by the 4 chosen rows and 4 chosen columns. The total number of such subgrids is `5 * 5 = 25`.\n\nThe problem is now to find the number of ways to place the 4 queens on a given 4x4 subgrid and then multiply this by the total number of possible subgrids. We need to be sure that the number of solutions is the same for every subgrid.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing a Canonical Subgrid\n\nLet's analyze one specific subgrid and count the number of solutions. By symmetry of the torus, the result for this subgrid will be the same for all others.\n\n*   **Canonical Subgrid:** Let's choose rows {0, 1, 2, 3} and columns {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n*   **Placement as a Permutation:** A placement of 4 non-attacking queens (by row/column) on this subgrid corresponds to a permutation `p` of the columns {0, 1, 2, 3}. The queen positions are `(i, p(i))` for `i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}`.\n*   **Applying Diagonal Constraints:** We need to find the permutations `p` such that the diagonal constraints are met. For any two distinct row indices `i` and `j` from {0, 1, 2, 3}:\n    1.  `i - p(i) ≢ j - p(j) (mod 5)`\n    2.  `i + p(i) ≢ j + p(j) (mod 5)`\n\nThis means the four values of `i - p(i)` must be distinct modulo 5, and the four values of `i + p(i)` must also be distinct modulo 5.\n\nLet's test the `4! = 24` possible permutations of {0, 1, 2, 3}.\n\nLet `p = (p(0), p(1), p(2), p(3))`. We check the sets `D = {i - p(i) mod 5}` and `S = {i + p(i) mod 5}`.\n\nAfter systematically checking all 24 permutations, we find exactly two that satisfy the conditions:\n\n**Permutation 1: `p = (1, 3, 0, 2)`**\n*   Queen positions: `(0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 2)`\n*   `i - p(i)` values:\n    *   `0 - 1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n    *   `1 - 3 ≡ 3 (mod 5)`\n    *   `2 - 0 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n    *   `3 - 2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n    The set of differences is {1, 2, 3, 4}, which are all distinct. This is valid.\n*   `i + p(i)` values:\n    *   `0 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n    *   `1 + 3 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n    *   `2 + 0 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n    *   `3 + 2 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`\n    The set of sums is {0, 1, 2, 4}, which are all distinct. This is valid.\n*   This permutation gives a valid placement.\n\n**Permutation 2: `p = (2, 0, 3, 1)`**\n*   Queen positions: `(0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 3), (3, 1)`\n*   `i - p(i)` values:\n    *   `0 - 2 ≡ 3 (mod 5)`\n    *   `1 - 0 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n    *   `2 - 3 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n    *   `3 - 1 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n    The set of differences is {1, 2, 3, 4}, which are all distinct. This is valid.\n*   `i + p(i)` values:\n    *   `0 + 2 ≡ 2 (mod 5)`\n    *   `1 + 0 ≡ 1 (mod 5)`\n    *   `2 + 3 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`\n    *   `3 + 1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`\n    The set of sums is {0, 1, 2, 4}, which are all distinct. This is valid.\n*   This permutation also gives a valid placement.\n\nSo, for the subgrid with rows {0,1,2,3} and columns {0,1,2,3}, there are exactly **2** valid placements.\n\n### Step 4: Extending to All Subgrids\n\nThe toroidal board has translational symmetry. Any choice of 4 rows and 4 columns can be translated to our canonical subgrid of {0,1,2,3} x {0,1,2,3}. A translation `(x, y) -> (x+a, y+b) mod 5` maps a valid solution to another valid solution. This means that the number of valid placements is the same for every possible 4x4 subgrid.\n\nSince we found 2 solutions for our canonical subgrid, there must be 2 solutions for each of the 25 possible subgrids.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answer\n\nTotal number of ways = (Number of possible 4x4 subgrids) × (Number of solutions per subgrid)\n\n*   Number of subgrids = (Ways to choose 4 rows) × (Ways to choose 4 columns) = `C(5, 4) * C(5, 4) = 5 * 5 = 25`.\n*   Number of solutions per subgrid = 2.\n\nTotal ways = `25 * 2 = 50`.\n\n<<<50>>>"
