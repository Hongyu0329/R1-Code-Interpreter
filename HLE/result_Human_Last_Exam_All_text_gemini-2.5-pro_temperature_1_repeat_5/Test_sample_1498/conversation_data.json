    "Of course. Let's break down the question and find the answer methodically.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understanding the Question**\nThe user wants to identify the specific section within the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam by Sayyid Ahmad al-Marzuqi that lists the names of the Prophets. The required answer is the range of line numbers (bayts) covering this list, from the first line that starts naming them to the last line that concludes the list.\n\n**2. Careful Points and Context**\n\n*   **The Poem's Structure:** 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam is a pedagogical poem that explains the essential articles of faith (Aqeedah) in a metered, rhyming format to make it easy to memorize. The topics follow a logical sequence: Allah's attributes, the Prophets, the Angels, the Divine Books, the Last Day, and so on.\n*   **The Section on Prophets:** Before listing the names, the author first establishes the *obligation* to believe in the prophets and states that knowing the details of the 25 mentioned in the Qur'an is necessary. This is an important distinction. The question is not about the *entire section* on Prophethood, but specifically about the lines that *enumerate their names*.\n*   **The Enumeration Method:** A key point is that the poem does *not* list all 25 prophets by name. For the sake of poetic meter and brevity, the author lists a selection of them and then refers to the rest. This is a common technique in such pedagogical poems.\n*   **Numbering of Bayts (Lines):** The numbering of the bayts can sometimes vary slightly between different printed editions. However, there is a standard, widely accepted numbering. My analysis will use this standard numbering, which typically begins counting from the first line of the poem proper (`أَبْدَأُ بِاسْمِ اللهِ وَالرَّحْمَنِ`).\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer: Step-by-Step\n\n1.  **Locating the Start of the List:**\n    We need to find the first line where the author begins to explicitly name the prophets. The lines preceding this discuss the *obligation* to know them. For example, bayt (line) 28 states:\n    > تَفْصِيلُ خَمْسَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ لَزِمْ  ...  كُلَّ مُكَلَّفٍ فَحَقِّقْ وَاغْتَنِمْ\n    > (The details of twenty-five [prophets] are binding... on every legally responsible person, so verify and seize [this knowledge]).\n\n    The very next line, **bayt 29**, begins the actual list of names:\n    > **هُمْ آدَمٌ إِدْرِيسُ نُوحٌ هُودُ مَعْ  ...  صَالِحٍ وَإِبْرَاهِيمُ كُلٌّ مُتَّبَعْ**\n    > **(They are Adam, Idris, Nuh, Hud, along with... Salih and Ibrahim, each is to be followed).**\n    This is the definitive starting point of the enumeration.\n\n2.  **Following the List to its Conclusion:**\n    The list of names continues over the next several lines:\n    *   **Bayt 30:** Mentions Lut, Isma'il, Ishaq, Ya'qub.\n    *   **Bayt 31:** Mentions Yusuf, Ayyub.\n    *   **Bayt 32:** Mentions Shu'ayb, Harun, Musa.\n    *   **Bayt 33:** Mentions Alyasa', Yunus, Zakariyya.\n    *   **Bayt 34:** Mentions Yahya, 'Isa, and Taha (a name for Prophet Muhammad ﷺ), and then concludes the list with the phrase \"خَاتِمٌ دَعْ عَنِ الْغَيِّ الْهَوَى\" (the Seal of the Prophets, leave misguidance and vain desires).\n\n3.  **Identifying the End of the Section:**\n    The list of names and the immediate reference to the final prophet are completed within bayt 34. The subsequent line, **bayt 35**, is a prayer and salutation upon all of them, which serves as a formal conclusion to the list.\n    > **عَلَيْهِمُ الصَّلَاةُ وَالسَّلَامُ  ...  وَآلِهِمْ مَا دَامَتِ الْأَيَّامُ**\n    > **(Upon them be prayers and peace... and upon their families, as long as the days last).**\n    The line after this, bayt 36, begins a new topic about the Angels (`وَالْمَلَكُ الَّذِي بِلَا أَبٍ وَأُمّ`). Therefore, bayt 35 is the clear conclusion of the section that enumerates the prophets.\n\n**Conclusion of Analysis:**\nThe enumeration of the names of the Prophets in the poem begins at bayt 29 and concludes with the salutations upon them in bayt 35.\n\n<<<From bayt 29 to bayt 35>>>"
