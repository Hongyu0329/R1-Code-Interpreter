The primary reason a functional MRI coil may not show resonance when tested with a VNA probe is that modern coils contain active detuning circuits. These circuits are a safety feature that makes the coil non-resonant by default when it is unpowered. The coil is only tuned to its operating frequency when it receives a specific DC control signal from the MRI scanner to put it into "receive mode". Without this signal, you are measuring the coil in its intentionally detuned, safe state. Other significant reasons include balanced coil geometries that cancel the magnetic field from your probe and the dependence on a powered-on integrated preamplifier for proper impedance matching and resonance.
