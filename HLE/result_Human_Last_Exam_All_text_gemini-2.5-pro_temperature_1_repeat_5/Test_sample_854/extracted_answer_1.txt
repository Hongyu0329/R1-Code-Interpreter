The laboratory's mistake was relying on a flawed Quality Control (QC) procedure. They used a bacterium (*Bacillus subtilis*) to test a medium designed to inhibit bacteria, so the "expected result" was no growth. When they observed no growth on the control plate for Batch 3, they incorrectly assumed it was because the chloramphenicol was working. However, the chloramphenicol in Batch 3 had been destroyed because it was added *before* autoclaving. The QC test failed to detect this critical error, leading the lab to mistakenly believe the batch was safe to use.
