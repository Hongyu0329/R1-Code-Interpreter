    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the properties of the function `f`\n\nLet the given equation be $f(f(x)) = e^x$. The function $g(x) = e^x$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and its range is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n1.  **Injectivity of f:**\n    Suppose $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$. Applying $f$ to both sides gives $f(f(x_1)) = f(f(x_2))$, which means $e^{x_1} = e^{x_2}$. Since the exponential function is injective, we must have $x_1 = x_2$. Therefore, the function $f$ must be injective.\n\n2.  **Monotonicity of f:**\n    We are given that $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous. A continuous and injective function defined on an interval (here, $\\mathbb{R}$) must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing).\n\n    *   **Case 1: f is strictly decreasing.**\n        If $f$ is strictly decreasing, then the composition $f \\circ f$ must be strictly increasing. (If $x_1 < x_2$, then $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$, and applying the decreasing function $f$ again reverses the inequality, so $f(f(x_1)) < f(f(x_2))$). This is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$, which is strictly increasing.\n        However, a continuous, strictly decreasing function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ must have exactly one fixed point. Let's call this fixed point $c$, so $f(c) = c$.\n        To see why, consider the function $h(x) = f(x) - x$. As $x \\to \\infty$, $f(x)$ either approaches a finite limit or $-\\infty$, so $h(x) \\to -\\infty$. As $x \\to -\\infty$, $f(x)$ either approaches a finite limit or $+\\infty$, so $h(x) \\to +\\infty$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a point $c$ where $h(c)=0$, i.e., $f(c)=c$. The fixed point is unique because if $c_1 < c_2$ were two fixed points, $f(c_1)=c_1$ and $f(c_2)=c_2$, but the decreasing nature of $f$ implies $f(c_1) > f(c_2)$, which gives $c_1 > c_2$, a contradiction.\n        If $f$ has a fixed point $c$, then $f(f(c)) = f(c) = c$. From the given equation, this means $e^c = c$. The equation $e^x = x$ has no real solutions (the function $k(x) = e^x - x$ has a minimum value of 1 at $x=0$). This contradiction shows that $f$ cannot be strictly decreasing.\n\n    *   **Case 2: f is strictly increasing.**\n        If $f$ is strictly increasing, then $f \\circ f$ is also strictly increasing, which is consistent with $f(f(x)) = e^x$. This is the only possibility.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the range of `f`\n\nSince $f$ is a strictly increasing continuous function on $\\mathbb{R}$, its range, let's call it $R_f$, must be an open interval $(L, M)$, where $L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ and $M = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x)$.\n\nThe range of the composition $f(f(x))$ is $f(R_f) = f((L, M))$. Since $f$ is increasing, this is $(\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y), \\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y))$. This must be equal to the range of $e^x$, which is $(0, \\infty)$.\n\n*   This implies $\\lim_{y \\to M^-} f(y) = \\infty$, which means $M = \\infty$.\n*   This also implies $\\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   $L = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x)$ must be a finite real number. If $L=-\\infty$, the range of $f$ would be $(-\\infty, \\infty) = \\mathbb{R}$, and $f(\\mathbb{R})=\\mathbb{R}$, which is not $(0, \\infty)$. So, $L$ is finite.\n*   Since $f$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$, we must have $f(L) = \\lim_{y \\to L^+} f(y) = 0$.\n*   Since $f$ is strictly increasing and its infimum is $L$, we must have $f(x) > L$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In particular, $f(L) > L$. Since $f(L)=0$, this implies $0 > L$. So, $L$ must be a negative number.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the set of solutions\n\nWe have established that any solution $f$ must be a strictly increasing continuous function with $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = L$ (for some $L<0$) and $f(L)=0$.\n\nA solution $f$ is completely determined by its behavior on a specific portion of its domain. Let's parameterize the solutions by:\n1.  The choice of the value $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$.\n2.  The choice of the function's definition on the interval $(-\\infty, L]$.\n\nLet's fix a value for $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$.\nLet $h$ be the restriction of $f$ to the interval $(-\\infty, L]$. So, $h(x) = f(x)$ for $x \\le L$.\nBased on our findings, $h$ must be a continuous, strictly increasing function that maps the domain $(-\\infty, L]$ onto the range $(L, 0]$. That is, $h$ is a bijection from $(-\\infty, L]$ to $(L, 0]$, with $h(L)=0$ and $\\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} h(x)=L$.\n\nOnce we choose such a function $h$, the entire function $f$ is determined.\n*   For $x \\in (-\\infty, L]$, we have $f(x) = h(x)$.\n*   For any $y \\in (L, 0]$, its preimage $x = h^{-1}(y)$ is in $(-\\infty, L]$. We must define $f(y)$ such that $f(f(x)) = e^x$. Thus, $f(y) = f(h(x)) = f(f(x)) = e^x = e^{h^{-1}(y)}$. This defines $f$ on $(L, 0]$.\n*   This process can be continued. For $z \\in (0, e^L]$, its preimage under $f$ is some $y \\in (L, 0]$. We then define $f(z) = f(f(y)) = e^y$.\n\nSo, every solution corresponds to a unique pair $(L, h)$, where $L \\in (-\\infty, 0)$ and $h$ is a continuous increasing bijection from $(-\\infty, L]$ to $(L, 0]$. Conversely, any such pair $(L, h)$ can be shown to generate a valid solution $f$.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the cardinality of the set of solutions\n\nThe total number of solutions is the number of possible pairs $(L, h)$.\nThe set of solutions $S$ can be written as a disjoint union $S = \\bigcup_{L \\in (-\\infty, 0)} S_L$, where $S_L$ is the set of solutions for a fixed $L$.\nThe cardinality is $|S| = |(-\\infty, 0)| \\times |S_L|$.\n\n1.  **Cardinality of choices for L:**\n    The value $L$ can be any real number in the interval $(-\\infty, 0)$. The cardinality of this set is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c} = |\\mathbb{R}|$.\n\n2.  **Cardinality of choices for h (for a fixed L):**\n    For a fixed $L<0$, we need to find the cardinality of the set of continuous, strictly increasing bijections from $(-\\infty, L]$ to $(L, 0]$. This is equivalent to finding the cardinality of the set of continuous, strictly increasing bijections from $[0, \\infty)$ to $[0, 1)$. Let $\\phi: [0, \\infty) \\to [0, 1)$ be such a function.\n    *   The total number of continuous functions from $[0, \\infty)$ to $[0, 1)$ is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$. A continuous function is determined by its values on the rationals $\\mathbb{Q}$, so the cardinality is $|\\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{Q}}| = \\mathfrak{c}^{\\aleph_0} = (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 \\times \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n    *   We can show there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions. For example, consider the family of functions $\\phi_a(x) = 1 - e^{-ax}$ for any parameter $a > 0$.\n        *   $\\phi_a(0) = 1 - e^0 = 0$.\n        *   $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\phi_a(x) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n        *   $\\phi_a'(x) = ae^{-ax} > 0$, so it is strictly increasing.\n        Each value of $a \\in (0, \\infty)$ gives a distinct function $\\phi_a$. Since there are $\\mathfrak{c}$ choices for $a$, there are at least $\\mathfrak{c}$ such functions.\n    *   Since the cardinality is at most $\\mathfrak{c}$ and at least $\\mathfrak{c}$, it must be exactly $\\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe total number of solutions is the product of the number of choices for $L$ and the number of choices for $h$.\nCardinality = (Choices for L) $\\times$ (Choices for h) = $\\mathfrak{c} \\times \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of such continuous functions is the cardinality of the continuum."
