    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Properties of the Character**\n\nWe are looking for a Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with two specific properties:\n1.  **Conductor N**: The character $\\chi$ must be primitive modulo $N=36036$.\n2.  **Order 6**: The order of $\\chi$ in the group of Dirichlet characters modulo $N$ must be 6.\n\nA key theorem in the theory of Dirichlet characters states that the group of characters modulo $N$ can be decomposed based on the prime factorization of $N$.\n\n**Step 2: Factorize N**\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $N$:\n$N = 36036 = 36 \\times 1001 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times (7 \\times 11 \\times 13)$\nSo, the prime factorization is $N = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 \\cdot 13$.\n\n**Step 3: Decompose the Character**\n\nAny Dirichlet character $\\chi$ modulo $N$ can be uniquely written as a product of characters modulo the prime power factors of $N$:\n$\\chi = \\chi_{2^2} \\chi_{3^2} \\chi_{7} \\chi_{11} \\chi_{13}$\nwhere $\\chi_{p^a}$ is a character modulo $p^a$.\n\nThe two conditions on $\\chi$ translate to conditions on its components:\n1.  **Primitivity**: $\\chi$ is primitive modulo $N$ if and only if each component character $\\chi_{p^a}$ is primitive modulo its respective prime power $p^a$.\n2.  **Order**: The order of $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters.\n    $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_{2^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{3^2}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{7}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{11}), \\text{ord}(\\chi_{13})) = 6$.\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Primitive Characters for Each Factor**\n\nWe need to determine the possible orders for primitive characters for each prime power factor $p^a$ of $N$, and count how many characters exist for each valid order. Let $C(m, d)$ be the number of primitive characters of conductor $m$ and order $d$.\n\n*   **For $N_1 = 2^2 = 4$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 4 is cyclic of order $\\phi(4)=2$. It has one primitive character (the non-principal one), whose conductor is 4 and order is 2.\n    - Possible orders for primitive characters: {2}.\n    - Number of choices: $C(4, 2) = 1$.\n\n*   **For $N_2 = 3^2 = 9$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 9 is cyclic of order $\\phi(9)=6$. A character modulo 9 is primitive if its order does not divide $\\phi(3)=2$. Thus, the primitive characters are those of order 3 and 6.\n    - Possible orders for primitive characters: {3, 6}.\n    - Number of choices for order 3: $C(9, 3) = \\phi(3) = 2$.\n    - Number of choices for order 6: $C(9, 6) = \\phi(6) = 2$.\n\n*   **For $N_3 = 7$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 7 is cyclic of order $\\phi(7)=6$. All non-principal characters are primitive. Their orders are the divisors of 6, except 1.\n    - Possible orders for primitive characters: {2, 3, 6}.\n    - Number of choices: $C(7, 2)=\\phi(2)=1$, $C(7, 3)=\\phi(3)=2$, $C(7, 6)=\\phi(6)=2$.\n\n*   **For $N_4 = 11$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 11 is cyclic of order $\\phi(11)=10$. All non-principal characters are primitive.\n    - Possible orders for primitive characters: {2, 5, 10}.\n\n*   **For $N_5 = 13$**:\n    The group of characters modulo 13 is cyclic of order $\\phi(13)=12$. All non-principal characters are primitive.\n    - Possible orders for primitive characters: {2, 3, 4, 6, 12}.\n\n**Step 5: Apply the Order Condition and Count the Combinations**\n\nLet $o_{p^a} = \\text{ord}(\\chi_{p^a})$. The condition is $\\text{lcm}(o_4, o_9, o_7, o_{11}, o_{13}) = 6$.\nThis implies two sub-conditions:\n(a) For each component $\\chi_{p^a}$, its order $o_{p^a}$ must be a divisor of 6.\n(b) The set of orders must contain at least one multiple of 2 and at least one multiple of 3.\n\nLet's first count the number of available primitive characters for each factor whose order divides 6 (Condition a).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$**: The only possible order is 2, which divides 6. Number of choices = 1.\n*   **For $\\chi_9$**: Possible orders are 3 and 6. Both divide 6. Number of choices = $C(9,3) + C(9,6) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n*   **For $\\chi_7$**: Possible orders are 2, 3, 6. All divide 6. Number of choices = $C(7,2) + C(7,3) + C(7,6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n*   **For $\\chi_{11}$**: Possible orders are 2, 5, 10. Only 2 divides 6. Number of choices = $C(11,2) = 1$.\n*   **For $\\chi_{13}$**: Possible orders are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Those dividing 6 are 2, 3, 6. Number of choices = $C(13,2) + C(13,3) + C(13,6) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nNow, let's verify Condition (b) for any combination of characters chosen according to the counts above.\n\n*   The character $\\chi_4$ must be the primitive character of order 2. So, $o_4 = 2$. This guarantees that the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 2.\n*   The character $\\chi_9$ must have order 3 or 6. In either case, its order is a multiple of 3. This guarantees that the lcm of the orders will be a multiple of 3.\n\nSince the lcm is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it must be a multiple of $\\text{lcm}(2,3) = 6$.\nCombined with Condition (a) that all orders divide 6, the lcm must be exactly 6.\n\nTherefore, any combination of primitive characters chosen with orders dividing 6 will result in a final character of order 6. The total number is the product of the number of choices for each component.\n\nTotal number = (Choices for $\\chi_4$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_9$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_7$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{11}$) $\\times$ (Choices for $\\chi_{13}$)\nTotal number = $1 \\times 4 \\times 5 \\times 1 \\times 5 = 100$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor $N=36036$ and order $6$ is 100."
