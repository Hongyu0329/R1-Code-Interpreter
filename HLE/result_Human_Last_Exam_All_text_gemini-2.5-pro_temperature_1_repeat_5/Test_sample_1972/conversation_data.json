    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the novel.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The query provides two key pieces of information, both attributed to the writer Jorge Luis Borges:\n    *   **Quote 1:** A description of a novel having \"the intensity of a tiger and the variety that a chess duel can achieve.\" This metaphor suggests a work that is both fierce/powerful and intellectually complex/strategic.\n    *   **Quote 2:** A description of the novel's author as a \"continuator (and simplifier) of Faulkner.\" This points to a writer whose style is influenced by William Faulkner but is perhaps more direct or less stylistically dense.\n\n2.  **Identify the Author:** The second clue is the most direct way to identify the author. Borges famously applied the \"continuator... of Faulkner\" label to the Uruguayan novelist **Juan Carlos Onetti**. Onetti's creation of the mythical city of Santa María is frequently compared to Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, and his characters are similarly tormented and alienated. Borges's addition of \"(and simplifier)\" is a key insight, noting that Onetti's prose, while complex, did not have the same level of syntactical convolution as Faulkner's.\n\n3.  **Identify the Novel:** Now that the author is identified as Juan Carlos Onetti, the task is to find which of his novels Borges was describing with the \"tiger and chess\" metaphor. Both quotes originate from the same text: a short but highly influential review written by Borges.\n\n4.  **Locate the Source:** Borges wrote a review of Onetti's novel **_La vida breve_** (**_A Brief Life_**) for the Argentine literary magazine *Sur* in 1950. It is in this specific review that he makes both statements. He praises the novel's intricate construction and psychological depth, which led him to use the evocative metaphor of a tiger's intensity combined with the strategic variety of a chess match. In the same review, he situates Onetti within literary tradition by comparing his work to Faulkner's.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Attribution:** It is essential to confirm that both quotes are correctly attributed to Borges and that they refer to the same work. In this case, multiple literary sources and collections of Borges's essays confirm that both descriptions were used in his 1950 review of *La vida breve*.\n*   **Context of \"Simplifier\":** The term \"simplifier\" is not a criticism. Borges meant that Onetti distilled the essence of Faulkner's tragic vision and narrative techniques into a form that was his own, and arguably more focused.\n*   **The Novel's Significance:** *La vida breve* is considered Onetti's masterpiece and a landmark of modern Latin American literature. It is the novel where he first introduces the fictional city of Santa María, which would be the setting for many of his later works. Borges's early praise was crucial in bringing attention to Onetti's genius.\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nBy combining the two distinct descriptions provided in the question, we can confidently identify both the author and the specific novel Borges was analyzing. The author is Juan Carlos Onetti, and the novel is *La vida breve*.\n\n<<<La vida breve (A Brief Life)>>>"
