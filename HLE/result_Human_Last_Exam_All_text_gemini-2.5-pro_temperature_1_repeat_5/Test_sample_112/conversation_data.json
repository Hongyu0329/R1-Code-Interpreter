    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the answer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific \"Sir Launfal\"**: The question refers to the Middle English romance poem *Sir Launfal*, written in the late 14th or early 15th century and attributed to Thomas Chestre. This is distinct from earlier or later versions of the story.\n\n2.  **Understand \"preserved alongside\"**: This phrase means that the two texts are found together in the same physical object, which in this case is a medieval manuscript (a handwritten book, or codex). To answer the question, we must identify the specific manuscript that contains *Sir Launfal*.\n\n3.  **Locate the manuscript**: The poem *Sir Launfal* by Thomas Chestre survives in only one manuscript. This manuscript is held in the British Library under the shelfmark **Cotton Caligula A.ii**.\n\n4.  **Examine the contents of the manuscript**: The Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is a collection, or miscellany, of different texts bound together. It contains several other English romances, such as *Libeaus Desconus* and *Sir Eglamour of Artois*.\n\n5.  **Identify the \"book of manners\"**: We need to search the list of contents for this manuscript for a text that fits the description of a \"book of manners\" (also known as a courtesy book). Within this manuscript, there is indeed a didactic poem on etiquette, social conduct, and table manners.\n\n6.  **Name the specific book**: This book of manners found in the Cotton Caligula A.ii manuscript is titled **\"The Boke of Curtasye\"** (which translates to \"The Book of Courtesy\").\n\n7.  **Conclusion**: Since *Sir Launfal* and *The Boke of Curtasye* are both found within the same manuscript (Cotton Caligula A.ii), we can conclude that *Sir Launfal* was preserved alongside this book of manners.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Specificity of the work**: It is crucial to identify the correct \"Sir Launfal\" as the one by Thomas Chestre, as this is the version found in the relevant manuscript.\n*   **Meaning of \"Preserved\"**: The question is about codicology (the study of manuscripts as physical objects). The answer lies in the contents of the specific codex where the poem is found.\n*   **Manuscript Identification**: The correct identification of the manuscript as Cotton Caligula A.ii is the key to finding the other texts it contains.\n*   **Genre Recognition**: A \"book of manners\" is a specific genre of medieval literature. The title *The Boke of Curtasye* clearly places the text within this genre.\n\nBy following these steps, we arrive at the correct answer.\n\n<<<The Boke of Curtasye>>>"
