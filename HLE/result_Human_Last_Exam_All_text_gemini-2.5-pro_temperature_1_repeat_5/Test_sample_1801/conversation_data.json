    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Question:** The question asks to identify two specific individuals who meet a set of criteria:\n    *   They are Nobel laureates.\n    *   They were featured in a commercial for the company Enron.\n    *   The commercial aired around the year 2000.\n    *   The commercial's campaign had the tagline \"Ask Why\".\n\n2.  **Research the Enron \"Ask Why\" Campaign:** The \"Ask Why\" campaign was a major corporate branding effort by Enron in 2000 and 2001. The goal was to portray Enron not just as an energy company, but as a revolutionary \"new economy\" company that was changing markets through innovation and by questioning old ways of doing business. The campaign is now infamous due to the company's spectacular collapse in a massive accounting scandal shortly after the ads aired.\n\n3.  **Identify the Featured Personalities:** The \"Ask Why\" television commercials featured several notable individuals in short vignettes, where they would pose a question beginning with \"Why...\". A search for the participants in this specific ad campaign is necessary.\n\n4.  **Pinpoint the Nobel Laureates:** By researching the list of people featured in the campaign, we can cross-reference them with the list of Nobel Prize winners. This process reveals two key figures:\n    *   **Figure 1: F. W. de Klerk.** He was the last State President of apartheid-era South Africa. He was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 for his role in ending the apartheid system. At the time of the commercial in 2000, he was already a well-known Nobel laureate.\n    *   **Figure 2: Paul Krugman.** He is a distinguished American economist and public intellectual. In his \"Ask Why\" commercial, he questioned why California's electricity market wasn't truly deregulated. He would later be awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008 for his work on trade theory.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n1.  **Timing of the Nobel Prize:** This is the most important nuance. While F. W. de Klerk was already a Nobel laureate when the commercial aired in 2000, Paul Krugman was not. He was a highly respected economist but did not receive his Nobel Prize until eight years later. The question asks which two \"Nobel laureates\" (implying their current status) were featured, making Krugman a correct answer despite not holding the title at the time of filming.\n\n2.  **Irony of the Campaign:** The campaign's tagline, \"Ask Why,\" and its use of respected figures to promote intellectual curiosity and transparency is deeply ironic. Enron's business model was built on opaque, complex, and ultimately fraudulent accounting that could not withstand scrutiny. The company collapsed when people finally did \"ask why\" about its incredible profits.\n\n3.  **Separate Commercials:** It is important to note that Krugman and de Klerk were not in the same 30-second commercial spot together. They were each featured in their own individual commercial as part of the broader \"Ask Why\" campaign. The question's wording \"featured in an infamous 2000 commercial\" is best interpreted as being featured in the overall campaign.\n\n### Acquiring the Final Answer\n\n*   **Step 1:** The Enron \"Ask Why\" campaign of 2000 is confirmed to have featured prominent individuals.\n*   **Step 2:** One of these individuals was F. W. de Klerk, who had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993.\n*   **Step 3:** Another of these individuals was the economist Paul Krugman.\n*   **Step 4:** Paul Krugman later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.\n*   **Step 5:** Therefore, the two Nobel laureates featured in the campaign are F. W. de Klerk and Paul Krugman.\n\n<<<Paul Krugman and F. W. de Klerk>>>"
