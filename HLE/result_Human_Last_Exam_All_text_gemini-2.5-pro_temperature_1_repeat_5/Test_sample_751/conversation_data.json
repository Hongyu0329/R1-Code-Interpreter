    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Understand the Goal and the Duality Principle**\n\nThe objective is to reduce the given discrete-time system to its observer canonical form. The system is described by matrices A and C.\n`A = [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]]`\n`C = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]`\n\nThe problem specifies using the principle of duality. Duality connects observability of a system (A, C) to the controllability of its dual system (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>).\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n- Form a dual system (A<sub>d</sub>, B<sub>d</sub>) = (A<sup>T</sup>, C<sup>T</sup>).\n- Find the transformation matrix that converts this dual system into controllable canonical form.\n- Use this transformation matrix to find the matrices for the observer canonical form of the original system.\n\n**2. Simplification from MIMO to SISO**\n\nThe given system is a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system because the output `y` has two components (C is 2x3). Transforming a MIMO system to a canonical form can be complex due to concepts like observability/controllability indices.\n\nHowever, we can simplify the problem by finding a transformation for an equivalent Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) system. We can choose one row of the C matrix, let's say `c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`, and check if the system (A, c₁) is observable. If it is, we can find the transformation matrix `P` for this SISO system and then apply it to the original system.\n\nLet's check the observability of (A, c₁):\nThe observability matrix is `O₁ = [c₁; c₁A; c₁A²]`.\n`c₁ = [0, 1, 0]`\n`c₁A = [0, 1, 0] * [[1, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [0, 2, 0]] = [2, 1, 1]`\n`A² = A * A = [[3, 2, 1], [4, 5, 1], [4, 2, 2]]`\n`c₁A² = [0, 1, 0] * A² = [4, 5, 1]`\n\n`O₁ = [[0, 1, 0], [2, 1, 1], [4, 5, 1]]`\nThe determinant of O₁ is `det(O₁) = 0 - 1*(2*1 - 1*4) + 0 = -(-2) = 2`.\nSince `det(O₁) ≠ 0`, the system (A, c₁) is observable. We can proceed with this SISO approach.\n\n**3. Dual System and Controllable Canonical Form**\n\nThe dual of our SISO system (A, c₁) is (A<sup>T</sup>, c₁<sup>T</sup>).\n`A_d = A^T = [[1, 2, 0], [1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0]]`\n`B_d = c₁^T = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n\nWe need to find the transformation matrix `T` that converts (A<sub>d</sub>, B<sub>d</sub>) to controllable canonical form (A<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>). The observer canonical form for (A, c₁) will then be (A<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>, B<sub>c</sub><sup>T</sup>).\n\nFirst, we need the characteristic polynomial of A: `p(z) = det(zI - A)`.\n`p(z) = z³ - 2z² - 3z + 2`\nFor the controllable companion form `A_c = [[0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1], [-a₃, -a₂, -a₁]]` corresponding to `p(z) = z³ + a₁z² + a₂z + a₃`, we have:\n`a₁ = -2`, `a₂ = -3`, `a₃ = 2`.\n\n**4. Finding the Transformation Matrix**\n\nWe can use Ackermann's formula to find the transformation matrix `P` for the observer form. The formula relates `P` to the controllability matrix `W_c` of the dual system and a matrix `W_a` formed from the characteristic polynomial coefficients.\n\nThe transformation from a state-space representation to observer canonical form is given by `P = (W_c * W_a)^T`.\n\n-   **Controllability matrix `W_c` of the dual system:**\n    `W_c = [B_d, A_d*B_d, A_d²*B_d]`\n    `B_d = [0, 1, 0]^T`\n    `A_d*B_d = [2, 1, 1]^T`\n    `A_d²*B_d = [4, 5, 1]^T`\n    `W_c = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]]`\n\n-   **Matrix `W_a` from polynomial coefficients:**\n    `W_a = [[a₂, a₁, 1], [a₁, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]] = [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`\n\n-   **Calculate `P`:**\n    `W_c * W_a = [[0, 2, 4], [1, 1, 5], [0, 1, 1]] * [[-3, -2, 1], [-2, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]`\n              `= [[0, 2, 0], [0, -1, 1], [-1, 1, 0]]`\n    `P = (W_c * W_a)^T = [[0, 0, -1], [2, -1, 1], [0, 1, 0]]`\n\n**5. Transforming the System**\n\nThe new state `z` is related to the old state `x` by `z = Px`. The transformed system matrices are `A_o = PAP⁻¹` and `C_o = CP⁻¹`.\nTo find `C_o`, we need `P⁻¹`.\n\n-   **Calculate `P⁻¹`:**\n    `det(P) = -1 * (2*1 - (-1)*0) = -2`\n    `adj(P) = [[-1, -1, -1], [0, 0, -2], [2, 0, 0]]`\n    `P⁻¹ = (1/det(P)) * adj(P) = (1/-2) * [[-1, -1, -1], [0, 0, -2], [2, 0, 0]]`\n        `= [[1/2, 1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]`\n\n**6. Calculate the New C Matrix (C_o)**\n\nFinally, we compute the new output matrix `C_o` by applying the transformation to the original `C` matrix.\n`C_o = C * P⁻¹`\n`C_o = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]] * [[1/2, 1/2, 1/2], [0, 0, 1], [-1, 0, 0]]`\n\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n-   First row of `C_o`: `[0, 1, 0] * P⁻¹` gives the second row of `P⁻¹`, which is `[0, 0, 1]`.\n-   Second row of `C_o`: `[1, 1, 0] * P⁻¹` is the sum of the first and second rows of `P⁻¹`: `[1/2, 1/2, 1/2] + [0, 0, 1] = [1/2, 1/2, 3/2]`.\n\nSo, the new C matrix is:\n`C_o = [[0, 0, 1], [1/2, 1/2, 3/2]]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final answer is $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0.5 & 0.5 & 1.5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n<<<[[0, 0, 1], [0.5, 0.5, 1.5]]>>>"
