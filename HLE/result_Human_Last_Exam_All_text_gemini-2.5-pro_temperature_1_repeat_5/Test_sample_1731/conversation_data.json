    "The problem asks for the equilibrium values of mean energy and entropy for a gas of light quanta (photons), using the principles of large deviation theory as embodied by the Boltzmann-Sanov and Cramer-Chernoff theorems. These theorems provide a rigorous foundation for the methods of statistical mechanics, where equilibrium corresponds to the most probable macroscopic state. This state is found by maximizing the entropy for a given set of constraints.\n\nHere is a step-by-step analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Define the System and Statistical Framework**\n*   **System:** A gas of photons in a volume $V$ at thermal equilibrium with a heat bath at temperature $T$.\n*   **Particles:** Photons are bosons.\n*   **Key Constraint:** The number of photons is not conserved. This implies that the chemical potential, $\\mu$, is zero.\n*   **LDT Connection:** The Boltzmann-Sanov theorem relates the probability of an empirical distribution to the KL-divergence from a true distribution. In statistical mechanics, this corresponds to Boltzmann's principle, $S = k_B \\ln W$, where $S$ is entropy and $W$ is the number of microstates for a given macrostate. The equilibrium state is the macrostate that maximizes $W$ (and thus $S$), as this state has the overwhelmingly highest probability. Minimizing a rate function in LDT is equivalent to maximizing entropy. The Cramer-Chernoff theorem relates to deviations of a sample mean, which connects to the minimization of the free energy functional $F=E-TS$. For a photon gas with $\\mu=0$, the equilibrium state is found by minimizing this free energy.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Equilibrium Distribution**\nThe macrostate of the system is described by the number of photons $n_i$ in each energy level $\\epsilon_i$. The entropy for this configuration of indistinguishable bosons is given by:\n$S = k_B \\sum_i \\left[ (n_i + g_i) \\ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i \\ln n_i - g_i \\ln g_i \\right]$\nwhere $g_i$ is the degeneracy of the energy level $\\epsilon_i$.\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution, we maximize this entropy subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy $E = \\sum_i n_i \\epsilon_i$. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers, maximizing $\\mathcal{L} = S/k_B - \\beta(E)$, where $\\beta$ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with energy (which will be identified as $1/(k_B T)$). Since photon number is not conserved, there is no second constraint on the total number of particles.\n\nThe maximization condition $\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial n_i} = 0$ yields the mean occupation number $\\langle n_i \\rangle = n_i/g_i$ for each state in the energy level $\\epsilon_i$:\n$\\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\epsilon/(k_B T)} - 1}$\nThis is the celebrated Planck distribution for photons.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Equilibrium Mean Energy (E)**\nTo find the total energy, we must integrate the energy of photons over all possible energy levels, weighted by the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$. For photons in a 3D volume $V$, the density of states (including a factor of 2 for polarization) is:\n$g(\\epsilon)d\\epsilon = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 d\\epsilon$\n\nThe total mean energy $E$ is:\n$E = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\langle n(\\epsilon) \\rangle g(\\epsilon) d\\epsilon = \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\epsilon^2 \\right) d\\epsilon$\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon} - 1} d\\epsilon$\n\nTo solve the integral, we use the substitution $x = \\beta \\epsilon$:\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\frac{1}{\\beta^4} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx$\nThe definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function: $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} dx = \\Gamma(4)\\zeta(4) = 6 \\cdot \\frac{\\pi^4}{90} = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15}$.\nSubstituting this value and $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$:\n$E = \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} (k_B T)^4 \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} = \\left(\\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3}\\right) V T^4$\nThis is the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the total energy of black-body radiation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Equilibrium Entropy (S)**\nWhile one could substitute the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula, a more direct method is to use the thermodynamic potential. For a grand canonical ensemble with $\\mu=0$, the Grand Potential $\\Omega$ is equal to the Helmholtz Free Energy $F$.\n$\\Omega = F = E - TS$\nThe grand potential is also related to the grand partition function $Z_G$:\n$\\Omega = -k_B T \\ln Z_G = k_B T \\sum_i g_i \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon_i})$\n\nConverting the sum to an integral using the density of states:\n$\\Omega = k_B T \\int_0^\\infty g(\\epsilon) \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon = k_B T \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\epsilon^2 \\ln(1 - e^{-\\beta \\epsilon}) d\\epsilon$\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts, which reveals a direct relationship with the energy integral:\n$\\Omega = - \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{8 \\pi V}{(hc)^3} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\epsilon^3}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1} d\\epsilon = -\\frac{E}{3}$\n\nNow we use the thermodynamic relation $F = E - TS$:\n$-\\frac{E}{3} = E - TS$\n$TS = E + \\frac{E}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}E$\n$S = \\frac{4E}{3T}$\n\nFinally, substituting the expression for $E$:\n$S = \\frac{4}{3T} \\left( \\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3} V T^4 \\right) = \\left( \\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3} \\right) V T^3$\n\nThe equilibrium values are the expressions for the mean energy and entropy as functions of volume and temperature.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe equilibrium mean energy $E$ and entropy $S$ for a gas of light quanta in a volume $V$ at temperature $T$ are:\n\n**Mean Energy (E):**\n$E = \\left(\\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3}\\right) V T^4$\n\n**Entropy (S):**\n$S = \\left(\\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3}\\right) V T^3$\n\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.\n\n<<<\nMean Energy: $E = \\left(\\frac{8 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^3}\\right) V T^4$\nEntropy: $S = \\left(\\frac{32 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{45 h^3 c^3}\\right) V T^3$\n>>>"
