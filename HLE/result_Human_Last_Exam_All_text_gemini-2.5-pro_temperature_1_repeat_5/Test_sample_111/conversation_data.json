    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Key Figures and Date:**\n    *   **Geoffrey Chaucer:** The famous English poet.\n    *   **Blanche of Lancaster:** The first wife of John of Gaunt (King Edward III's son) and the subject of Chaucer's poem *The Book of the Duchess*.\n    *   **Date of Death:** We first need to establish when Blanche of Lancaster died. Historical records indicate she died of the plague on **September 12, 1368**.\n\n2.  **Determine Geoffrey Chaucer's Whereabouts in 1368:**\n    *   To find Chaucer's location, we must consult the *Chaucer Life-Records*, a collection of historical documents mentioning him.\n    *   A record dated **July 17, 1368**, shows that Chaucer received a license to travel from Dover to \"parts across the sea\" (*partibus transmarinis*) on the king's business.\n    *   Another record from the Michaelmas term (which began in late September) of 1368 documents a payment to Chaucer for this recent journey.\n    *   This timeline indicates that Chaucer left England sometime after July 17 and returned in the autumn. Therefore, on September 12, 1368, he was almost certainly on the continent, not in England.\n\n3.  **Evaluate the Possible Locations:**\n    *   We have established that Chaucer was \"across the sea\" from England. Now we must analyze the specific locations provided in the answer choices.\n    *   **C. England & E. Scotland:** These are incorrect. He was on the European continent.\n    *   **A. Italy:** Chaucer's first documented diplomatic mission to Italy (specifically to Genoa and Florence) was not until 1372-1373. There is no reliable evidence he was in Italy in 1368.\n    *   **B. France:** This is a plausible destination. During this period, England was engaged in the Hundred Years' War with France, and diplomatic missions to France, Flanders (modern Belgium/France/Netherlands), or English-held territories like Calais were common. Chaucer undertook many such missions to France throughout his career.\n    *   **D. Unknown:** This option must be considered carefully. The actual historical record for the 1368 trip, the *Life-Records*, only states he went to *partibus transmarinis* (\"parts across the sea\"). It does **not** specify the country. While France is a very strong possibility and a reasonable inference, it is not a documented fact for this specific journey.\n\n### Careful Points and Conclusion\n\n*   **Certainty vs. Probability:** The key to this question is distinguishing between what is known for certain and what is merely probable. We know for certain Chaucer was abroad. We do not know for certain *where* abroad.\n*   **Evaluating \"France\" vs. \"Unknown\":** Since the primary documents do not name a specific country for his 1368 mission, the most factually accurate and cautious answer is that his exact location is unknown. Choosing \"France\" would be an educated guess, not a statement of established fact based on the surviving evidence for that particular trip. In historical analysis, when the records are silent on a specific detail, the correct position is to acknowledge that the detail is unknown.\n\nTherefore, based on the available historical records, we cannot definitively state where Geoffrey Chaucer was when Blanche of Lancaster died, other than that he was on the continent.\n\n<<<D>>>"
