    "Answering the question to find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), which is the number of permutations of length 333 with exactly 3 inversions that avoid the pattern 1324.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the problem\n- **Permutation:** A permutation \\(\\pi\\) of length \\(n\\) is an arrangement of the numbers \\(\\{1, 2, ..., n\\}\\). We denote the set of such permutations as \\(S_n\\).\n- **Inversions:** An inversion in a permutation \\(\\pi\\) is a pair of indices \\((i, j)\\) such that \\(i < j\\) and \\(\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)\\). We are given that the number of inversions is \\(k=3\\).\n- **Pattern Avoidance:** A permutation \\(\\pi\\) avoids a pattern \\(\\sigma\\) (here, \\(\\sigma=1324\\)) if there are no indices \\(i_1 < i_2 < i_3 < i_4\\) such that the subsequence \\(\\pi(i_1), \\pi(i_2), \\pi(i_3), \\pi(i_4)\\) has the same relative order as \\(\\sigma\\). For \\(\\sigma=1324\\), this means there is no subsequence of values \\(a, b, c, d\\) in \\(\\pi\\) such that \\(a < c < b < d\\).\n\n### Step 2: Simplifying the problem based on \\(n\\) and \\(k\\)\nA key property of permutations with a small number of inversions is that they only \"disturb\" a small number of elements at the beginning of the sequence.\nA known result states that for a permutation \\(\\pi \\in S_n\\) with \\(k\\) inversions, \\(\\pi(i) = i\\) for all \\(i > 2k\\).\nIn our case, \\(k=3\\), so any permutation \\(\\pi \\in S_{333}\\) with 3 inversions must have \\(\\pi(i)=i\\) for all \\(i > 2 \\times 3 = 6\\).\nThis means that such a permutation is of the form \\(\\pi = \\pi' \\oplus id_{333-m}\\), where \\(\\pi'\\) is a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) with 3 inversions, \\(m \\le 6\\), and \\(id_{333-m}\\) is the identity permutation on the remaining elements. The notation \\(\\oplus\\) denotes the direct sum of permutations.\nBecause of this structure, the number of such permutations does not depend on \\(n\\) as long as \\(n \\ge 2k\\). Therefore, \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = av_n^3(1324)\\) for any \\(n \\ge 6\\). We can solve the problem by counting the number of such permutations for \\(n=6\\) (or any \\(n \\ge 6\\)).\n\nThe total number of permutations in \\(S_n\\) with \\(k=3\\) inversions for \\(n \\ge 6\\) is 20. We need to find how many of these 20 specific permutations avoid the 1324 pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the 1324-avoidance condition for these permutations\nLet \\(\\pi\\) be a permutation with 3 inversions. Let its \"active part\" be \\(\\pi_m\\), which is a permutation of \\(\\{1, ..., m\\}\\) where \\(m \\le 6\\) is the largest number moved by \\(\\pi\\). The full permutation is \\(\\pi = \\pi_m \\oplus id_{n-m}\\).\n\nA 1324 pattern is a subsequence of values \\((a,c,b,d)\\) with \\(a<c<b<d\\).\nIf \\(\\pi\\) has a 1324 pattern, the elements of the pattern can come from the active part (\\(\\pi_m\\)) or the passive part (\\(id_{n-m}\\)).\nThe passive part is sorted, so it cannot contribute to a non-monotonic pattern on its own.\nA crucial observation is how a 132 pattern in the active part can lead to a 1324 pattern in the full permutation.\nSuppose \\(\\pi_m\\) contains a 132 pattern, which is a subsequence of values \\((a, c, b)\\) with \\(a < b < c\\). If there exists a value \\(d\\) in the permutation appearing after \\(b\\) such that \\(d > c\\), then \\((a, c, b, d)\\) forms a 1324 pattern.\nIn our case, the passive part consists of values \\(\\{m+1, m+2, ..., n\\}\\) in increasing order. So, if \\(\\pi_m\\) has a 132 pattern \\((a,c,b)\\) and \\(c < m\\), then there will always be a value \\(d > m > c\\) in the passive part for large \\(n\\). For example, \\(\\pi(m+1)=m+1\\), which can act as \\(d\\).\nThis leads to the following condition:\nA permutation \\(\\pi\\) (with active part \\(\\pi_m\\)) avoids 1324 if and only if its active part \\(\\pi_m\\) satisfies:\n1. \\(\\pi_m\\) is 132-avoiding.\nOR\n2. \\(\\pi_m\\) contains 132 patterns, but for every such pattern \\((a,c,b)\\), the value \\(c\\) is the largest element in \\(\\pi_m\\), i.e., \\(c=m\\). This ensures no \\(d>c\\) can be found later in the permutation.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the avoiding permutations\nWe need to count the permutations \\(\\pi_m \\in S_m\\) where \\(m \\le 6\\), \\(\\pi_m(m) \\neq m\\), \\(inv(\\pi_m)=3\\), that satisfy one of the two conditions above.\n\nLet's check for \\(m=3, 4, 5, 6\\).\n- **Case m=3:** The only permutation in \\(S_3\\) with 3 inversions is \\(\\pi_3 = 321\\). It is 132-avoiding. This gives **1** permutation.\n\n- **Case m=4:** Permutations in \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions and \\(\\pi_4(4) \\neq 4\\). The total number of permutations in \\(S_4\\) with 3 inversions is 6: `1432, 2341, 2413, 3142, 3214, 4123`.\n  - `3214` has \\(\\pi_4(4)=4\\), so its active part has \\(m=3\\). It is accounted for in the m=3 case.\n  - The other 5 permutations have \\(\\pi_4(4) \\neq 4\\). Let's analyze them:\n    - `4123`: 132-avoiding.\n    - `2341`: 132-avoiding.\n    - `1432`: Contains 132 pattern `143`. Here \\(c=4=m\\). Satisfies condition 2.\n    - `2413`: Contains 132 pattern `243`. Here \\(c=4=m\\). Satisfies condition 2.\n    - `3142`: Contains 132 pattern `142`. Here \\(c=4=m\\). Satisfies condition 2.\n  All 5 satisfy the conditions. This gives **5** permutations.\n\n- **Case m=5:** Permutations \\(\\pi_5 \\in S_5\\) with 3 inversions and \\(\\pi_5(5) \\neq 5\\).\n  - 132-avoiding permutations: `31254`, `23154`. (2 perms)\n  - Permutations with 132 patterns where \\(c=m=5\\): `12543`. Its 132 patterns are `153, 154, 253, 254`, and for all of them \\(c=5\\). (1 perm)\n  Other permutations like `14253` contain a 132 pattern `142` with \\(c=4 < 5\\), so they form a 1324 pattern in \\(S_{333}\\).\n  Total for m=5: 2 + 1 = **3** permutations.\n\n- **Case m=6:** Permutations \\(\\pi_6 \\in S_6\\) with 3 inversions and \\(\\pi_6(6) \\neq 6\\).\n  - 132-avoiding permutations: `123654`, `312465`, `213564`. (3 perms)\n  - Permutations with 132 patterns where \\(c=m=6\\): `126345`. Its 132 patterns are of the form \\(x,6,y\\) (e.g., `163, 164, 165, 263, ...\\)). For all of them \\(c=6\\). (1 perm)\n  Total for m=6: 3 + 1 = **4** permutations.\n\nThe problem states that n=333, which is much larger than 6. So any permutation with 3 inversions will have its active part fully contained within the first 6 positions. Thus, we don't need to consider \\(m>6\\).\n\n### Step 5: Final Calculation\nThe total number of 1324-avoiding permutations with 3 inversions is the sum of the counts for each possible active part size \\(m\\).\nTotal = (count for m=3) + (count for m=4) + (count for m=5) + (count for m=6)\nTotal = 1 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 13.\n\nFinal check of the permutations counted:\n- m=3: `321`\n- m=4: `4123`, `2341`, `1432`, `2413`, `3142`\n- m=5: `31254`, `23154`, `12543`\n- m=6: `123654`, `312465`, `213564`, `126345`\nThe sum is 1 + 5 + 3 + 4 = 13."
