    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question\nThe user's question has two parts that need to be answered together:\n1.  What is the **first book** of the Bible, in **canonical order**, that is **mentioned by name** in a Shakespeare play?\n2.  In **which play** does this mention occur?\n\n### Step 2: Define the Key Terms\n*   **\"First book... in canonical order\":** This means we must check the books of the Bible in the standard Protestant canonical sequence, starting with the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, etc.). We stop at the very first one we find.\n*   **\"Mentioned by name\":** This is the most crucial point. The analysis must look for the actual name of the biblical book (e.g., \"Genesis,\" \"Job,\" \"Psalms,\" \"Romans\"). Allusions to stories or characters are common in Shakespeare, but the question requires the book itself to be named. A gray area exists for books named after their main character (like Job or Daniel). In literary convention, naming the titular character is a standard way of referring to the work itself.\n\n### Step 3: Systematic Search through the Biblical Canon\n\nWe will proceed book by book through the Old Testament until we find a match.\n\n1.  **Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 & 2 Samuel, 1 & 2 Kings, 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther:** A thorough search of the complete works of Shakespeare confirms that none of these books are mentioned by their title. There are many allusions (to Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Samson from Judges), but the books themselves are not named.\n\n2.  **Job:** This is the next book in the canonical order.\n    *   **Finding:** The character Job is explicitly named in two plays.\n    *   **Play 1:** In *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (Act V, Scene 5), Falstaff, disguised and tormented in Windsor Park, exclaims: \"I am as **poor as Job**, my lord, but not so patient.\"\n    *   **Play 2:** In *The Second Part of King Henry the Fourth* (Act I, Scene 2), Falstaff says to the Lord Chief Justice: \"I am as **poor as Job**, my lord, but not so patient.\"\n    *   **Careful Point Analysis:** Does naming \"Job\" count as naming the book? Yes. The phrase \"poor as Job\" is proverbial, but it derives its meaning entirely from the biblical narrative contained in the Book of Job. For books named after a single protagonist, naming the character is the most direct and common way to reference the book. Therefore, this qualifies as being \"mentioned by name.\"\n\n### Step 4: Confirming the \"First\" Book\nSince we have found a valid mention of Job, and we have confirmed that no preceding books in the canon are named, we can confidently state that **Job** is the first one. We do not need to continue searching through the rest of the Bible (e.g., Psalms, Daniel, Romans), even though they are also mentioned. For instance, the \"Hundredth Psalm\" is mentioned in *The Merry Wives of Windsor*, but Psalms comes after Job in the canon.\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer Formulation\n*   **The Book:** Job.\n*   **The Play:** *The Merry Wives of Windsor* (or *2 Henry IV*; both are correct, but we only need to provide one).\n\nThe analysis leads to a definitive answer based on a systematic check against the question's specific criteria.\n\n***\n\nThe first book in the Bible, in canonical order, to be mentioned by name in a Shakespeare play is the **Book of Job**. It is mentioned in **The Merry Wives of Windsor**.\n\n<<<The book is Job, and the play is The Merry Wives of Windsor.>>>"
