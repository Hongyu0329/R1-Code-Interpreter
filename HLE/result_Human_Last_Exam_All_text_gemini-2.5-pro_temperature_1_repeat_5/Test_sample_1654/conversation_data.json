    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Core of the Question**\nThe question asks for the specific number of times Anton Chekov describes Police Superintendent Otchumyelov's coat in the short story \"The Chameleon.\" The question also correctly notes that these descriptions are symbolic of his changing mentality and attitude throughout the story. The key is to count every distinct instance where the coat is mentioned in relation to his actions or state of mind.\n\n**Step 2: Break Down the Story's Narrative and Locate Mentions of the Coat**\nWe need to read through the story's progression and pinpoint each moment the coat is described or becomes part of the action.\n\n1.  **Initial Scene:** At the very beginning of the story, as Otchumyelov walks through the market square, he is introduced.\n    *   **Description 1:** \"Police Superintendent Otchumyelov is walking across the market square wearing a **new overcoat**...\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** This first description establishes his initial state of authority and self-importance. It's the baseline from which he will deviate.\n\n2.  **First Shift in Opinion:** When a person in the crowd suggests the dog might belong to General Zhigalov, Otchumyelov's authoritative stance immediately wavers. He becomes flustered and hot under the collar.\n    *   **Description 2:** \"'H'm. Help me off with my **coat**, Yeldyrin,' says Otchumyelov. 'It's frightfully hot!'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** He removes the coat, symbolically shedding his official, harsh persona to become more accommodating and nervous.\n\n3.  **Second Shift in Opinion:** The policeman, Yeldyrin, reasons that the dog is not the General's. Otchumyelov, feeling safe again, reasserts his authority.\n    *   **Description 3:** \"'Help me on with my **coat**, brother Yeldyrin; there's a wind getting up... I am cold.'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** He puts the coat back on. The feeling of being \"cold\" signifies his return to a rigid, unfeeling officialdom. He is once again ready to pass harsh judgment.\n\n4.  **Third Shift in Opinion:** The policeman speculates again, \"Maybe it is the General's after all...\" This throws Otchumyelov back into a state of panic.\n    *   **Description 4:** \"'Help me off with my **coat**, Yeldyrin... I can hardly breathe!'\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** For the second time, he removes the coat. This repeated action emphasizes his complete lack of conviction and his tendency to shed his authority whenever it becomes inconvenient or dangerous.\n\n5.  **Final Resolution:** The General's cook clarifies that the dog belongs to the General's visiting brother. Otchumyelov's demeanor changes to one of fawning delight. The case is resolved in his mind, and he leaves the scene.\n    *   **Description 5:** \"Otchumyelov... **wraps himself in his greatcoat** and continues on his way across the square.\"\n    *   **Careful Point:** The final action of wrapping the coat around himself symbolizes his return to a state of comfort and security in his official role, now that he has successfully navigated the situation without offending a powerful figure. Chekov uses the synonym \"greatcoat\" here, but it refers to the same symbolic garment.\n\n**Step 3: Tally the Count and Finalize the Answer**\nBy tracking each distinct moment the coat is described or its state is changed, we arrive at a clear count.\n\n1.  Wearing the new overcoat.\n2.  Taking the coat off.\n3.  Putting the coat on.\n4.  Taking the coat off again.\n5.  Wrapping the greatcoat around himself.\n\nThere are five separate instances where the coat is described to symbolize Otchumyelov's state of mind.\n\n<<<5>>>"
