    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of each ballet step to determine which one ends in the same leg position it started. The \"leg position\" refers to the specific configuration of the feet, including which foot is in front (e.g., right foot front in fifth position).\n\n**Step-by-step Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Question:** The core task is to identify the ballet step from the given options where the dancer's feet return to their exact starting position (e.g., if they start in fifth position with the right foot in front, they must end in fifth position with the right foot in front).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Each Answer Choice:**\n\n    *   **A. Entrechat six:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position plié (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Execution:** This is a vertical jump from two feet where the legs beat six times (which involves three crossings). An even number in an entrechat name (like *quatre*, *six*, *huit*) means the dancer lands on two feet. An odd number of crossings (*trois* means one crossing and a change, *six* means three crossings and a change) results in the feet changing position.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The dancer lands in fifth position plié, but with the opposite foot in front (e.g., left foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The position changes.\n\n    *   **B. Échappé battu changé:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position plié.\n        *   **Execution:** The name itself provides the answer. \"Échappé\" means to escape, typically jumping from fifth to second position. \"Battu\" means beaten, so the legs beat as they close. \"Changé\" means changed. The step involves jumping from second position back to fifth, beating the legs, and deliberately landing with the feet in the opposite fifth position.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The opposite fifth position from the start.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The position changes.\n\n    *   **C. Assemblé:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Usually fifth position.\n        *   **Execution:** \"Assemblé\" means to assemble. The dancer brushes one leg out, jumps off the supporting leg, and brings both legs together (\"assembles\" them) in the air to land simultaneously in fifth position. Most common forms of assemblé are changing steps. For example, in an *assemblé dessus* (over), the back leg brushes out and closes in front. In an *assemblé dessous* (under), the front leg brushes out and closes in back.\n        *   **Ending Position:** In its most common forms, the feet change position.\n        *   **Conclusion:** This step typically changes the position.\n\n    *   **D. Glissade derrière:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position plié (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Execution:** \"Glissade\" means to glide, and \"derrière\" means behind. The dancer glides the back foot (the left foot) out to the side, transfers weight onto it, and then slides the starting front foot (the right foot) to close *behind* it in fifth position.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The foot that was originally in front is now in the back. The final position is fifth with the left foot front.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The position changes.\n\n    *   **E. Gargouillade:**\n        *   **Starting Position:** Fifth position plié (e.g., right foot front).\n        *   **Execution:** This is an ornate, circular step, often described as a pas de chat with an added rond de jambe. In a standard gargouillade, the front foot (right foot) performs a small *rond de jambe en l'air en dehors* (outward circle) as the dancer jumps. The other leg (left foot) is drawn up to retiré. The dancer lands on the first foot (right foot), and the second foot (left foot) quickly closes behind it into fifth position.\n        *   **Ending Position:** The front foot (right foot) leads the movement and returns to the front. The back foot (left foot) closes in the back. The dancer ends in the same fifth position they started in (right foot front).\n        *   **Conclusion:** The position does not change.\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nAfter analyzing all the steps, the Gargouillade is the only one among the choices where the execution of the step results in the feet returning to the identical starting position.\n\n<<<E>>>"
