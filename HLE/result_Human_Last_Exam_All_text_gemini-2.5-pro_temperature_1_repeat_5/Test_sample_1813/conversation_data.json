    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\).\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Goal\nThe question asks for the \"continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\". This is a multi-step problem that involves several concepts from number theory. The phrasing suggests a process that starts with the rational number \\( 4/7 \\), calculates its corresponding generalized Markov number \\( m_{4/7} \\), and then finds a continued fraction that is canonically associated with this structure. The most natural interpretation in this context is the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number derived from the matrix representation corresponding to \\( 4/7 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Find the Continued Fraction of the Index \\( 4/7 \\)\nFirst, we express the rational number \\( 4/7 \\) as a simple continued fraction.\n\\[ \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{7}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{3}}} \\]\nSo, the continued fraction for \\( 4/7 \\) is \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Matrix Associated with \\( 4/7 \\)\nA standard way to associate a matrix in \\( SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\) to a rational number \\( p/q \\) is via its convergents. Let \\( p_k/q_k \\) be the \\(k\\)-th convergent of the continued fraction. The matrix \\( M_{p/q} \\) is given by:\n\\[ M_{p/q} = \\begin{pmatrix} p_n & p_{n-1} \\\\ q_n & q_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nwhere \\( p_n/q_n = p/q \\).\nFor \\( [0; 1, 1, 3] \\), the sequence of convergents is:\n*   \\( \\frac{p_0}{q_0} = \\frac{0}{1} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{p_1}{q_1} = \\frac{1}{1} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{p_2}{q_2} = [0; 1, 1] = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n*   \\( \\frac{p_3}{q_3} = [0; 1, 1, 3] = \\frac{4}{7} \\)\nSo we have \\( n=3 \\), \\( p_3 = 4 \\), \\( q_3 = 7 \\), \\( p_2 = 1 \\), and \\( q_2 = 2 \\). The associated matrix is:\n\\[ M_{4/7} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\]\nWe can check that \\( \\det(M_{4/7}) = 4 \\cdot 2 - 1 \\cdot 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 \\), so the matrix is in \\( SL(2, \\mathbb{Z}) \\).\n\n### Step 4: Compute the Generalized Markov Number \\( m_{4/7} \\)\nThe generalized Markov number \\( m_{p/q} \\) is defined as the trace of the associated matrix \\( M_{p/q} \\).\n\\[ m_{4/7} = \\text{tr}(M_{4/7}) = \\text{tr}\\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 7 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 4 + 2 = 6 \\]\n*Careful point:* There are different conventions for defining the matrix \\( M_{p/q} \\) and the number \\( m_{p/q} \\). The chosen convention (transfer matrix of convergents) is standard in number theory and leads to a consistent result. The value \\( m_{4/7}=6 \\) is a member of the solution triple \\( (3,3,6) \\) to the generalized Markov equation \\( x^2+y^2+z^2 = xyz \\), which gives confidence in this path.\n\n### Step 5: Find the Associated Quadratic Irrational\nThe matrix \\( M_{4/7} \\) corresponds to a Möbius transformation \\( T(z) = \\frac{4z+1}{7z+2} \\). The dynamics of this transformation are characterized by its fixed points. These fixed points are quadratic irrationals, and their continued fraction expansions are purely periodic (or eventually periodic). We find the fixed points by solving \\( T(z) = z \\):\n\\[ \\frac{4z+1}{7z+2} = z \\]\n\\[ 4z+1 = z(7z+2) \\]\n\\[ 4z+1 = 7z^2 + 2z \\]\n\\[ 7z^2 - 2z - 1 = 0 \\]\nUsing the quadratic formula, the roots are:\n\\[ z = \\frac{-(-2) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2)^2 - 4(7)(-1)}}{2(7)} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{4+28}}{14} = \\frac{2 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{14} = \\frac{2 \\pm 4\\sqrt{2}}{14} = \\frac{1 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{7} \\]\nWe choose the positive root, which we denote by \\( \\alpha \\):\n\\[ \\alpha = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{2}}{7} \\]\n\n### Step 6: Compute the Continued Fraction of the Quadratic Irrational \\( \\alpha \\)\nWe now compute the continued fraction expansion of \\( \\alpha = \\frac{1 + 2\\sqrt{2}}{7} \\) using the standard algorithm.\n*   \\( \\alpha_0 = \\frac{1+2\\sqrt{2}}{7} \\approx \\frac{1+2(1.414)}{7} \\approx \\frac{3.828}{7} \\approx 0.546... \\). The integer part is \\( a_0 = 0 \\).\n*   \\( \\alpha_1 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_0 - a_0} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1+2\\sqrt{2}}{7}} = \\frac{7}{1+2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{7(2\\sqrt{2}-1)}{(1+2\\sqrt{2})(2\\sqrt{2}-1)} = \\frac{7(2\\sqrt{2}-1)}{8-1} = 2\\sqrt{2}-1 \\approx 1.828... \\). The integer part is \\( a_1 = 1 \\).\n*   \\( \\alpha_2 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_1 - a_1} = \\frac{1}{(2\\sqrt{2}-1)-1} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}-2} = \\frac{1}{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2} \\approx 1.207... \\). The integer part is \\( a_2 = 1 \\).\n*   \\( \\alpha_3 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_2 - a_2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}+1}{2}-1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}-1}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}-1} = \\frac{2(\\sqrt{2}+1)}{(\\sqrt{2}-1)(\\sqrt{2}+1)} = 2(\\sqrt{2}+1) = 2\\sqrt{2}+2 \\approx 4.828... \\). The integer part is \\( a_3 = 4 \\).\n*   \\( \\alpha_4 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_3 - a_3} = \\frac{1}{(2\\sqrt{2}+2)-4} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}-2} \\). We notice that \\( \\alpha_4 = \\alpha_2 \\).\nSince a remainder has repeated, the sequence of partial quotients will now repeat. The sequence of quotients is \\( a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_2, a_3, \\dots \\).\nThe continued fraction is therefore \\( [0; 1, \\overline{1, 4}] \\).\n\nThe final answer is the continued fraction of the positive fixed point of the Möbius transformation associated with the matrix \\( M_{4/7} \\)."
