    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the SKI combinator expression.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the SKI combinators and Church numerals**\n\nThe fundamental combinators are:\n*   `S x y z = x z (y z)`\n*   `K x y = x`\n*   `I x = x`\n\nA Church numeral `n` (written as `c_n`) is a higher-order function that represents the integer `n`. It takes a function `f` and a value `x` and applies `f` to `x`, `n` times: `c_n f x = f^n(x)`.\n\n**Step 2: Deconstruct the main expression**\n\nLet the given expression be `E`. The expression has a nested structure of the form `S(I)(...)`.\n`E = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))))(B)`\n\nLet's analyze the application `S(I)(Y)(Z)`:\n`S(I)(Y)(Z) = I Z (Y Z) = Z (Y Z)`\nThis means we can peel off the `S(I)` layers from the outside in.\nLet `Y_1 = K(A)`. The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(Y_1))))(B)`.\nLet `Y_2 = S(I)(Y_1)`. The expression is `S(I)(S(I)(Y_2)))(B)`.\nLet `Y_3 = S(I)(Y_2)`. The expression is `S(I)(Y_3))(B)`.\nLet `Y_4 = S(I)(Y_3)`. The expression is `Y_4(B)`. Wait, this is not right.\n\nLet's try again with right-to-left evaluation of the argument `B`.\n`E = S(I) (S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))) (B)`\nApplying the rule `S(I) Y Z = Z(Y Z)`:\n`E = B ( (S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))) (B) )`\nNow evaluate the inner part `(S(I)(S(I)(K(A)))) (B)`:\n`= B ( (S(I)(K(A))) (B) )`\nNow evaluate the innermost part `(S(I)(K(A))) (B)`:\n`= B ( K(A)(B) ) = B(A)`\nSubstituting back:\nInner part becomes `B(B(A))`.\nFull expression `E` becomes `B(B(B(A)))`.\n\nSo, the complex expression simplifies to `B_op(B_op(B_op(A_num)))`, where `A_num` and `B_op` are the combinator expressions:\n*   `A_num = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\n*   `B_op = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))`\n\n**Step 3: Identify the components `A_num` and `B_op`**\n\nWe need to know what these combinators do, especially in the context of Church numerals. We use the following standard identities for Church numeral arithmetic in SKI:\n*   **Bluebird (Composition):** `B_comb = S(KS)K`. `B_comb f g x = f(g x)`.\n*   **Multiplication:** The multiplication combinator `MULT` is `B_comb`. `MULT c_m c_n = B_comb c_m c_n = c_{m*n}`.\n*   **Exponentiation:** The application of one Church numeral to another results in exponentiation. `EXP c_n c_m = c_m c_n = c_{n^m}`.\n\nLet's analyze `A_num`:\n`A_num = S(S(K(S))(K))(I)`\nNotice that `S(K(S))(K)` is not `B_comb`. The correct `B_comb` is `S(KS)K`.\nLet's check `A_num = S(B_comb)I`.\n`A_num f x = (S(B_comb)I) f x = B_comb f (I f) x = B_comb f f x = f(f x)`.\nThis is the definition of Church numeral 2. So, `A_num = c_2`.\n\nNow let's analyze `B_op`:\n`B_op = S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I)) = S(B_comb)(SII)`\nHere `SII = S(I)(I)`. Let's see what `SII` does to an argument `x`:\n`SII x = I x (I x) = x x`.\n`B_op` is not a numeral but an operator that transforms a numeral. Let's see its action on a generic church numeral `c_k`.\n`B_op(c_k) = (S(B_comb)(SII)) c_k = B_comb c_k (SII c_k)`\nWe know `SII c_k = c_k c_k`. From the exponentiation rule, `c_k c_k = c_{k^k}`.\nSo, `B_op(c_k) = B_comb c_k (c_{k^k})`.\nUsing the multiplication rule, `B_comb c_k (c_{k^k}) = c_{k * k^k} = c_{k^(k+1)}`.\nSo, `B_op` is an operator that transforms a Church numeral `c_k` into `c_{k^(k+1)}`.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final Church numeral `n`**\n\nThe expression `E` is `B_op(B_op(B_op(A_num)))`.\n*   The starting numeral is `A_num = c_2`. So, `k_0 = 2`.\n*   First application: `B_op(c_2)`. The new numeral's value is `k_1 = 2^(2+1) = 2^3 = 8`. So `B_op(c_2) = c_8`.\n*   Second application: `B_op(c_8)`. The new numeral's value is `k_2 = 8^(8+1) = 8^9`. So `B_op(c_8) = c_{8^9}`.\n*   Third application: `B_op(c_{8^9})`. The new numeral's value is `k_3 = (8^9)^((8^9)+1)`.\n\nSo, the Church integer `n` is `(8^9)^((8^9)+1)`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate `log_2(n)`**\n\nWe need to compute the base-2 logarithm of `n`.\n`n = (8^9)^(8^9 + 1)`\n`log_2(n) = log_2 [ (8^9)^(8^9 + 1) ]`\nUsing the logarithm property `log(a^b) = b * log(a)`:\n`log_2(n) = (8^9 + 1) * log_2(8^9)`\nUsing the same property again:\n`log_2(n) = (8^9 + 1) * 9 * log_2(8)`\nSince `8 = 2^3`, `log_2(8) = 3`:\n`log_2(n) = (8^9 + 1) * 9 * 3`\n`log_2(n) = 27 * (8^9 + 1)`\nTo simplify further, substitute `8 = 2^3`:\n`log_2(n) = 27 * ((2^3)^9 + 1)`\n`log_2(n) = 27 * (2^27 + 1)`\n`log_2(n) = 27 * 2^27 + 27`\n\nThis is the final exact value.\n\n<<<27 * 2^27 + 27>>>"
