    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of wallpaper groups with a point group of order 2.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understand the core concepts**\n\n*   **Wallpaper Group:** A wallpaper group (or plane crystallographic group) is a mathematical classification of a two-dimensional repetitive pattern based on its full set of symmetries, including translations, rotations, reflections, and glide reflections. There are 17 such groups in total.\n*   **Point Group:** For any wallpaper group, the associated point group is the set of symmetry operations (rotations and reflections) that leave at least one point in the pattern fixed. It does not include translational symmetries.\n*   **Order of a Group:** The order of a group is the number of elements (i.e., symmetry operations) it contains.\n*   **The Question:** We need to find how many of the 17 wallpaper groups have a point group containing exactly two symmetry operations (order 2).\n\n**Step 2: Identify the 2D crystallographic point groups of order 2**\n\nA point group of order 2 must contain two elements: the identity operation (doing nothing) and one other symmetry operation which, when applied twice, returns the pattern to its original state. In two dimensions, there are two possibilities for this second operation:\n\n1.  **180° rotation:** A rotation by 180° around a point. The group consists of {identity, 180° rotation}. This point group is denoted as **2** (in Hermann-Mauguin notation) or **C₂** (in Schoenflies notation).\n2.  **Reflection:** A reflection across a single line. The group consists of {identity, reflection}. This point group is denoted as **m** (in Hermann-Mauguin notation) or **Cₛ** (or D₁) (in Schoenflies notation).\n\nTherefore, we are looking for wallpaper groups whose point group is either **2** or **m**.\n\n**Step 3: List the 17 wallpaper groups and identify their respective point groups**\n\nWe need to check each of the 17 wallpaper groups to see what its point group is.\n\n| Wallpaper Group (IUC Name) | Point Group (IUC Name) | Order of Point Group | Is the order 2? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| p1 | 1 | 1 | No |\n| **p2** | **2** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| **pm** | **m** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| **pg** | **m** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| **cm** | **m** | **2** | **Yes** |\n| p2mm | 2mm | 4 | No |\n| p2mg | 2mm | 4 | No |\n| p2gg | 2mm | 4 | No |\n| c2mm | 2mm | 4 | No |\n| p4 | 4 | 4 | No |\n| p4mm | 4mm | 8 | No |\n| p4gm | 4mm | 8 | No |\n| p3 | 3 | 3 | No |\n| p3m1 | 3m | 6 | No |\n| p31m | 3m | 6 | No |\n| p6 | 6 | 6 | No |\n| p6mm | 6mm | 12 | No |\n\n**Step 4: Count the qualifying wallpaper groups**\n\nFrom the table above, we can count the wallpaper groups that satisfy the condition (having a point group of order 2).\n\n*   The wallpaper group **p2** has the point group **2** (order 2).\n*   The wallpaper group **pm** has the point group **m** (order 2).\n*   The wallpaper group **pg** has the point group **m** (order 2).\n*   The wallpaper group **cm** has the point group **m** (order 2).\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n*   **Distinction between Wallpaper Group and Point Group:** It is crucial not to confuse the two. The wallpaper group includes translations and glide reflections, while the point group does not. For example, `pm`, `pg`, and `cm` are different wallpaper groups, but they all share the same point group `m`. The `g` in `pg` signifies a glide reflection, which is a combination of a reflection and a translation, but its \"point\" part is just the reflection.\n*   **Identifying all Order 2 Point Groups:** We correctly identified that both rotation group `2` and reflection group `m` are the only crystallographic point groups of order 2 in the plane.\n*   **Systematic Enumeration:** A systematic check of all 17 groups against their known point groups is the most reliable method to avoid missing any.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\n\nBy counting the entries marked \"Yes\" in the table, we find there are four such groups.\n\n1.  p2\n2.  pm\n3.  pg\n4.  cm\n\nTotal count = 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
