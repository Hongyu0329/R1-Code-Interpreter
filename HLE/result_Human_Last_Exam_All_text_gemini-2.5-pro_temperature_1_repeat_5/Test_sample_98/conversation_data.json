    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem:\n\n**Step 1: Understand the object and its orientation.**\nThe tank has the shape of a regular icosahedron. An icosahedron is a polyhedron with 20 identical faces, where each face is an equilateral triangle. It has 30 edges and 12 vertices. The problem states that the tank is \"standing on one of its faces,\" which means one of the triangular faces is horizontal and serves as the base.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the symmetry of the icosahedron in this orientation.**\nA regular icosahedron has a high degree of symmetry. A crucial property is that it possesses a center of symmetry (or inversion symmetry). This means that for any point on its surface, the point directly opposite it through the center is also on the surface. As a consequence, for any face, there is an identical, parallel face on the opposite side of the icosahedron. Therefore, when the icosahedron stands on one face, its top face is also an equilateral triangle, parallel to the base.\n\n**Step 3: Interpret the \"half-filled\" condition.**\n\"Half-filled\" means the volume of the water occupies exactly 50% of the total volume of the icosahedron. The surface of a liquid at rest in a stationary container is always a horizontal plane. We need to find the height and shape of this plane.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the height of the water surface.**\nBecause of the central symmetry of the icosahedron, the horizontal plane that passes exactly through its geometric center divides the shape into two parts of equal volume. If the total height between the bottom face and the top face is `H`, this plane is located at the mid-height, `h = H/2`. Therefore, when the tank is half-filled, the water surface will be this specific cross-section at the middle of the icosahedron.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the shape of the mid-height cross-section.**\nThe shape of the water surface will be the shape of the polygon formed by cutting the icosahedron with a horizontal plane at its mid-height. To find this shape, we can analyze the structure of the icosahedron's edges relative to the base.\n*   The icosahedron's vertices, in this orientation, lie on four distinct horizontal planes.\n*   The horizontal mid-plane lies between the two central layers of vertices.\n*   This plane intersects all the edges that connect the vertices of the second layer to the vertices of the third layer.\n*   There are exactly six such edges forming a \"belt\" or \"equator\" around the middle of the icosahedron.\n*   The cross-section is therefore a polygon with six vertices, which is a hexagon.\n\n**Step 6: Determine if the hexagon is regular.**\nWe must check if the hexagon has equal sides and equal angles.\n*   **Symmetry argument:** The vertical axis passing through the center of the bottom and top faces is an axis of 3-fold rotational symmetry. Rotating the icosahedron by 120° or 240° around this axis leaves the object unchanged. The mid-height cross-section must also possess this 3-fold symmetry.\n*   Furthermore, the icosahedron has 2-fold rotational symmetry axes passing through the midpoints of opposite equatorial edges. These axes lie within the mid-height plane.\n*   A six-sided polygon that exhibits both 3-fold and 2-fold rotational symmetry must be a regular hexagon. All its sides are equal in length, and all its internal angles are equal (120°).\n\n**Final Conclusion:**\nWhen an icosahedron tank standing on a face is half-filled, the water reaches the mid-plane of the object. This cross-section cuts through the six equatorial edges of the icosahedron, forming a regular hexagon.\n\n<<<A regular hexagon>>>"
