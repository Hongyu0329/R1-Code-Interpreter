    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the correct physicist.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the Question and Identify Key Information\nThe question asks for the identity of a specific physicist. We can break down the question into several key clues:\n1.  **Profession:** The individual is a physicist.\n2.  **Primary Field:** They are \"better known for work in the microscopy field.\"\n3.  **Discovery:** They \"discovered an optical effect in real imagery.\"\n4.  **Origin of Discovery:** The effect was \"accidentally observed by a custodial worker.\"\n5.  **Context of Observation:** The worker was \"cleaning concave mirrors.\"\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Careful Points (Clues)\n\n*   **Microscopy and Optics:** The combination of \"physicist,\" \"microscopy,\" and \"optical effect\" points towards a scientist specializing in optical physics and its application in microscopes. This includes techniques like phase contrast, dark-field, or interference contrast microscopy.\n*   **The Anecdote:** The story about the custodial worker and the concave mirrors is a very specific and unique detail. This is the most powerful clue for identifying the exact discovery and, by extension, the person associated with it. Concave mirrors are used to form real images, which aligns with the clue \"in real imagery.\"\n*   **The \"Discovery\":** The act of cleaning might involve a thin film of water or cleaning solution on the mirror's surface, or it might be related to making surface imperfections (like scratches) visible. The observation of an optical phenomenon under these conditions is the core of the event.\n\n### Step 3: Step-by-Step Analysis to Find the Answer\n\n1.  **Researching the Anecdote:** A search for the story about a custodial worker, concave mirrors, and an optical discovery leads to the history of **Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) microscopy**.\n2.  **The Story's Details:** The story goes that a cleaning person at the Marseille Observatory in France was cleaning the large concave mirrors of a reflecting telescope. As they wiped the mirror with a damp cloth, they noticed that microscopic scratches on the mirror's surface became strikingly visible with a pseudo-three-dimensional, shadowed appearance.\n3.  **Connecting the Story to the Science:** This observation was reported to the French physicist **Maurice Françon**. He recognized that the thin, wedge-shaped film of water left by the cloth was creating an interference effect that made tiny differences in the optical path (the scratches) visible. Françon began developing a microscope based on this principle.\n4.  **Identifying the Key Physicist:** While Françon initiated the work, it was the Polish-French physicist **Georges Nomarski** who perfected the technique and made it practical for widespread use. Nomarski invented a modified Wollaston prism, now known as the **Nomarski prism**, which could be easily fitted into standard light microscopes. This prism was the crucial innovation that made DIC microscopy a robust, easy-to-use, and commercially viable technique.\n5.  **Fulfilling all Criteria:**\n    *   **Physicist?** Yes, Georges Nomarski was a physicist.\n    *   **Better known for microscopy?** Absolutely. He is famous for the invention of the Nomarski prism and the resulting technique, Nomarski microscopy (a type of DIC).\n    *   **Discovered an optical effect?** Yes, his work led to the practical application of the DIC effect for microscopy.\n    *   **Related to the accidental observation?** Yes, his work is the direct and most famous practical outcome of the investigation that began with the custodial worker's observation. Although Françon was the first scientist to investigate the phenomenon, Nomarski is the one whose name is synonymous with the resulting microscopy technique.\n\nTherefore, Georges Nomarski is the physicist who best fits all the criteria described in the question.\n\n<<<Georges Nomarski>>>"
