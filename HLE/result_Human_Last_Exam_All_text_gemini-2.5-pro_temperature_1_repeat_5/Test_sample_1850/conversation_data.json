    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of historical saints mentioned by name in John Milton's *Paradise Lost*.\n\n### **Step 1: Define \"Historical Saint\"**\n\nFirst, we must clarify the term \"historical saint\" as it applies to Milton's work.\n\n*   **Historical**: This refers to figures treated as real people within the poem's biblical and historical framework. This excludes purely allegorical figures (like Sin and Death) and celestial beings who were never human (like the archangels Michael and Raphael).\n*   **Saint**: Milton was a Protestant and would not have adhered to the Catholic Church's formal canonization process. In the context of his work, a \"saint\" is best understood in the broader Christian sense: a holy person, a righteous individual, or a revered figure from the Old or New Testament. This includes patriarchs, prophets, righteous kings, and the first humans, Adam and Eve, who are venerated in many Christian traditions.\n\n### **Step 2: Methodology**\n\nThe most accurate method is to conduct a systematic search of the full, reliable text of *Paradise Lost* for the names of potential candidates. Allusions to figures are not sufficient; the figure must be explicitly \"mentioned by name.\"\n\n### **Step 3: Searching the Text and Verifying Candidates**\n\nWe will search for prominent figures from the Bible who fit our definition.\n\n1.  **Adam**: Mentioned by name throughout the epic. (**Count: 1**)\n2.  **Eve**: Mentioned by name throughout the epic. (**Count: 2**)\n3.  **Abel**: Mentioned by name in Book XI. Michael shows Adam the future, including Cain's jealousy: \"...for envie of the grace / By God confer'd on **Abel**, so enflam'd / His Brother...\" (**Count: 3**)\n4.  **Enoch**: Mentioned by name in Book XI. Michael describes his righteousness and assumption into heaven: \"Of **Enoch**, who to walk with God had known...\" (**Count: 4**)\n5.  **Noah**: Mentioned by his name (in its older spelling, \"Noe\") in Book XI, when Michael points out the tents of his family after the flood: \"...where stand the Tents of **Noe**, and his Sons...\" (**Count: 5**)\n6.  **Abraham**: Mentioned by name, both as \"Abram\" and \"Abraham,\" in Book XII. For instance, Michael explains God's plan: \"...from one man, **Abram**, and his seed...\" (**Count: 6**)\n7.  **Moses**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. When describing the journey to Canaan, Michael notes that the guide will be Joshua, not Moses: \"And therefore **Moses** shall not be thy guide...\" (**Count: 7**)\n8.  **Joshua**: Mentioned by name in the same passage in Book XII as the successor to Moses: \"...but **Joshua**, whom the Gentiles Jesus call...\" (**Count: 8**)\n9.  **David**: Mentioned by name in Book XII. Michael prophesies the coming of the Messiah from his lineage: \"That of the Royal Stock / Of **David** (so I name this King) shall rise / A Son...\" (**Count: 9**)\n10. **Josiah**: Mentioned by name in Book I. In the catalogue of demonic pagan gods, Milton notes that the righteous King Josiah was the one who drove them out of the land: \"...Till good **Josiah** drove them thence to Hell.\" (**Count: 10**)\n\n### **Step 4: Considering and Excluding Other Figures**\n\nIt is also important to note prominent figures who are alluded to but not mentioned by name, or who do not appear at all.\n\n*   **Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Sarah**: While their stories are part of the lineage described by Michael, their individual names do not appear in the text. \"Israel\" is mentioned, but it refers to the nation, not the patriarch Jacob directly by that name.\n*   **Solomon**: He is alluded to as David's \"next Son for wealth and wisdom fam'd\" who builds the Temple, but the name \"Solomon\" is not used.\n*   **Mary, Mother of Jesus**: She is referred to as \"A Virgin\" in Book XII, but the name \"Mary\" is never mentioned.\n*   **The Apostles**: They are mentioned as a group (\"his Apostles\"), but none, such as Peter or Paul, are named individually.\n*   **Galileo**: He is mentioned by name (\"Galileo\") in Book V, but as a contemporary astronomer, he does not fit the category of a \"historical saint\" in the biblical/religious sense intended by the question.\n\n### **Final Tally**\n\nBased on a careful and systematic analysis of the text, there are 10 historical saints mentioned by name in *Paradise Lost*. The list is:\n\n1.  Adam\n2.  Eve\n3.  Abel\n4.  Enoch\n5.  Noah\n6.  Abraham\n7.  Moses\n8.  Joshua\n9.  David\n10. Josiah\n\n<<<10>>>"
