    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Define the functions**\nWe are given a sequence of functions defined recursively:\n*   `F₀(x) = x`\n*   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n*   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n*   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the integrand**\nThe question asks to evaluate the definite integral `V = ∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` from 0 to 1.\nThe integrand is of the form `f'(x)/f(x)`. We need to find the antiderivative of this expression.\nLet `u = F₃(x)`. Then, by the chain rule, `du = F₃'(x) dx`.\nThe integral `∫ (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx` can be rewritten in terms of `u` as `∫ (1/u) du`.\nThe antiderivative of `1/u` is `ln|u|`.\nSubstituting `u = F₃(x)` back, the antiderivative of `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)` is `ln|F₃(x)|`.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**\nNow we evaluate the definite integral using the antiderivative we just found:\n`V = ∫[from 0 to 1] (F₃'(x)/F₃(x)) dx = [ln|F₃(x)|]` evaluated from `x=0` to `x=1`.\n`V = ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n\n**Step 4: Check the domain of the logarithm**\nWe need to ensure that `F₃(x)` is not zero in the interval `[0, 1]`.\n`F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`.\nFor `x` in the interval `[0, 1]`, `0 ≤ sin(x) ≤ sin(1)`.\nSince `sin(x) ≥ 0`, `e^(sin(x)) ≥ e⁰ = 1`.\nTherefore, `1 + e^(sin(x)) ≥ 2`.\nSince `1 + e^(sin(x))` is always greater than or equal to 2, its logarithm, `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`, will always be greater than or equal to `ln(2)`, which is a positive number.\nThus, `F₃(x)` is always positive on the interval `[0, 1]`, and we can safely drop the absolute value signs.\n`V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate F₃(0) and F₃(1)**\n*   **Calculate F₃(0):**\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0)))`\n    `sin(0) = 0`\n    `e⁰ = 1`\n    `F₃(0) = ln(1 + 1) = ln(2)`\n\n*   **Calculate F₃(1):**\n    `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    Here, '1' is in radians.\n\n**Step 6: Substitute the values to find V**\nNow, we substitute the expressions for `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)` into the equation for `V`.\n`V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`\nUsing the logarithm property `ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b)`, we can write:\n`V = ln[ ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) / ln(2) ]`\n\n**Step 7: Perform the numerical calculation**\nWe need to calculate the numerical value of `V` and then `10000 * V`.\n*   `sin(1)` (1 radian ≈ 57.3 degrees) ≈ 0.84147\n*   `e^(sin(1))` ≈ `e^0.84147` ≈ 2.31978\n*   `1 + e^(sin(1))` ≈ `1 + 2.31978 = 3.31978`\n*   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))` ≈ `ln(3.31978)` ≈ 1.20000\n*   `F₃(0) = ln(2)` ≈ 0.69315\n*   Now, calculate `V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`:\n    `V` ≈ `ln(1.20000) - ln(0.69315)`\n    `V` ≈ `0.18232 - (-0.36651)`\n    `V` ≈ `0.18232 + 0.36651`\n    `V` ≈ `0.54883`\n\n**Step 8: Final Answer Calculation**\nThe problem asks for the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n`10000 * V` ≈ `10000 * 0.54883` = `5488.3`\nThe closest integer to 5488.3 is 5488.\n\n<<<5488>>>"
