    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Question\nThe Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) formula expresses $Z = \\log(e^X e^Y)$ as a series of nested commutators of X and Y. The \"order\" of a term refers to the total degree in X and Y. We are asked for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10.\n\nThe BCH series is given by:\n$Z = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} Z_n(X, Y)$\nwhere $Z_n(X, Y)$ is the sum of all terms of total degree n. For example:\n$Z_1 = X + Y$\n$Z_2 = \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]$\n$Z_3 = \\frac{1}{12}[X, [X, Y]] + \\frac{1}{12}[Y, [Y, X]]$\n\nEach term $Z_n$ is an element of the free Lie algebra generated by two elements, X and Y. The terms in the expansion of $Z_n$ can be expressed as a linear combination of basis elements of the n-th graded component of this free Lie algebra. A fundamental theorem (the Dynkin-Specht-Wever theorem) implies that the coefficients for these basis elements are all non-zero. Therefore, the number of non-zero coefficients of order n is equal to the dimension of the n-th graded component of the free Lie algebra on two generators.\n\n### Step 2: Introducing Witt's Formula\nThe dimension of the n-th graded component of a free Lie algebra with k generators is given by Witt's formula:\n$L_n(k) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{d|n} \\mu(d) k^{n/d}$\nwhere:\n*   `n` is the degree (order), which is 10 in our case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators (X and Y), so k = 2.\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\n### Step 3: Applying Witt's Formula for n=10, k=2\n\nWe need to calculate $L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$.\n\n**1. Find the divisors of n=10:**\nThe positive divisors `d` of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.\n\n**2. Calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)` for each divisor:**\nThe Möbius function is defined as:\n*   `μ(1) = 1`\n*   `μ(d) = (-1)^p` if `d` is a product of `p` distinct primes.\n*   `μ(d) = 0` if `d` has a squared prime factor.\n\nFor our divisors:\n*   `μ(1) = 1`\n*   `μ(2) = -1` (2 is one prime)\n*   `μ(5) = -1` (5 is one prime)\n*   `μ(10) = μ(2 * 5) = (-1)^2 = 1` (10 is a product of 2 distinct primes)\n\n**3. Calculate each term in the summation:**\nThe formula is $\\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$. Let's calculate the term for each divisor `d`:\n*   **For d = 1:**  $\\mu(1) \\cdot 2^{10/1} = 1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1 \\cdot 1024 = 1024$\n*   **For d = 2:**  $\\mu(2) \\cdot 2^{10/2} = -1 \\cdot 2^5 = -1 \\cdot 32 = -32$\n*   **For d = 5:**  $\\mu(5) \\cdot 2^{10/5} = -1 \\cdot 2^2 = -1 \\cdot 4 = -4$\n*   **For d = 10:** $\\mu(10) \\cdot 2^{10/10} = 1 \\cdot 2^1 = 1 \\cdot 2 = 2$\n\n**4. Sum the terms:**\nSum = $1024 + (-32) + (-4) + 2 = 1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$.\n\n**5. Complete the calculation for $L_{10}(2)$:**\n$L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times (\\text{Sum}) = \\frac{1}{10} \\times 990 = 99$.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n*   **Interpretation:** The crucial first step is to correctly interpret \"number of nonzero coefficients\" as the dimension of the corresponding subspace in the free Lie algebra.\n*   **Witt's Formula:** You must use the correct formula. A common mistake is to confuse it with formulas for other algebraic structures.\n*   **Möbius Function:** The calculation of `μ(d)` must be accurate. Remember the rules for `μ(1)`, `μ(prime)`, and `μ(product of distinct primes)`. A mistake here will lead to a wrong sum. For example, `μ(10)` is `+1`, not `-1`.\n*   **Divisors:** Ensure you have identified all the divisors of `n`. For n=10, they are {1, 2, 5, 10}.\n*   **Arithmetic:** The final calculation involves powers and sums. Double-check the arithmetic, especially with the signs from the Möbius function.\n\n### Final Answer Acquisition\nBased on the analysis, the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 is equal to the dimension of the 10th graded component of the free Lie algebra on 2 generators.\n\n1.  **Formula:** $L_{10}(2) = \\frac{1}{10} \\sum_{d|10} \\mu(d) 2^{10/d}$\n2.  **Divisors of 10:** {1, 2, 5, 10}\n3.  **Möbius values:** `μ(1)=1`, `μ(2)=-1`, `μ(5)=-1`, `μ(10)=1`\n4.  **Summation:**\n    *   d=1:  $1 \\cdot 2^{10} = 1024$\n    *   d=2:  $-1 \\cdot 2^5 = -32$\n    *   d=5:  $-1 \\cdot 2^2 = -4$\n    *   d=10: $1 \\cdot 2^1 = 2$\n5.  **Total Sum:** $1024 - 32 - 4 + 2 = 990$\n6.  **Final Result:** $\\frac{990}{10} = 99$\n\nThe number of nonzero coefficients is 99.\n\n<<<99>>>"
