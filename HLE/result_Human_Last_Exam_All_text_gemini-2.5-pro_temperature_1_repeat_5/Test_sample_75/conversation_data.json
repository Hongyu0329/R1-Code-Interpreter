    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question to determine the length of the Second Great War in StarCraft lore.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the specific conflict:** The question asks about the \"Second Great War\". In StarCraft lore, this is the name given to the sector-wide conflict that takes place during the events of the *StarCraft II* trilogy (*Wings of Liberty*, *Heart of the Swarm*, and *Legacy of the Void*). This is distinct from the first \"Great War\" which occurred in the original *StarCraft* and its *Brood War* expansion.\n\n2.  **Determine the start date of the war:** The Second Great War officially begins in the year **2504**. This is marked by the Zerg Swarm, led by the Queen of Blades (Sarah Kerrigan), renewing its full-scale invasion of the Terran Dominion. This event kicks off the campaign of *StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty*.\n\n3.  **Determine the end date of the war:** The war's main antagonist is the fallen Xel'naga, Amon. The conflict concludes with his final and permanent defeat. This occurs during the epilogue campaign of *StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void*, titled \"Into the Void\". According to the official lore timeline, these events take place in the year **2506**. While there are subsequent smaller conflicts (like those in *Nova Covert Ops*, set in 2508), the main, galaxy-threatening war against Amon and his forces ends in 2506.\n\n4.  **Calculate the total duration:** The war starts in 2504 and ends in 2506.\n    *   It spans across the entirety of the year 2505.\n    *   It covers a significant portion of the year 2504 (starting sometime after the beginning of the year).\n    *   It covers a portion of the year 2506 (ending before the year is over).\n    *   Therefore, the conflict's duration is more than 2 full years, but less than 3 full years.\n\n5.  **Apply the rounding instruction:** The question specifically asks for the duration in years, **rounded up**.\n    *   The calculated duration is a value between 2 and 3 years (e.g., ~2.x years).\n    *   Rounding any value greater than 2 up to the nearest whole number gives us 3.\n\n### Careful Points to Consider\n\n*   **Distinguishing Wars:** It is crucial not to confuse the Second Great War (2504-2506) with the first Great War and the Brood War (which together lasted from 2500-2501).\n*   **Defining the End:** The end of the war is the defeat of the primary antagonist, Amon. Post-war skirmishes and clean-up operations do not extend the duration of the main war itself.\n*   **Overlapping Campaigns:** The events of the three *StarCraft II* campaigns are not strictly sequential; they overlap. For example, the *Legacy of the Void* campaign begins while the *Heart of the Swarm* campaign is still in progress. This doesn't change the overall start (2504) and end (2506) years.\n*   **Rounding Rule:** The instruction \"rounded up\" is key. If the war had lasted exactly 2 years, the answer would be 2. But since it stretched across parts of three calendar years, its duration is greater than 2, and thus rounds up to 3.\n\n### Final Answer Derivation\n\n*   **Start Year:** 2504\n*   **End Year:** 2506\n*   **Years Spanned:** 2504, 2505, 2506 (parts of 3 calendar years)\n*   **Duration:** Greater than 2 years.\n*   **Duration Rounded Up:** 3 years.\n\n<<<3>>>"
