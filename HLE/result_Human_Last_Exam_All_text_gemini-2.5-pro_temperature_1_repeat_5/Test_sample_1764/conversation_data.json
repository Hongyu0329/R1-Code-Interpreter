    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the question.\n\n### Step 1: Deconstruct the question\n\nThe question asks for the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings of a finite ultrametric space $X$ into a Banach space $B$ of cardinality $K$.\n\n*   **Finite Ultrametric Space ($X$):** This is a finite set $X$ with a distance function $d(x, y)$ that satisfies the strong triangle inequality: $d(x, z) \\le \\max(d(x, y), d(y, z))$.\n*   **Banach Space ($B$):** This is a complete normed vector space over a field, which is typically assumed to be $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$. The distance between two vectors $u, v \\in B$ is given by $\\|u - v\\|$.\n*   **Cardinality $K$:** The number of points in the set $B$ is $K$.\n*   **Isometric Embedding:** A function $f: X \\to B$ is an isometric embedding if it preserves distances, i.e., for all $x, y \\in X$, we have $d(x, y) = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|$.\n*   **Smallest Possible Number:** We need to find the minimum value for the number of such embeddings, considering all possible valid choices for $X$ and $B$. This means if we can find a specific pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of embeddings is $N$, and we can argue that it's impossible to have fewer than $N$ embeddings (for any pair where embeddings exist), then $N$ is our answer.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the number of embeddings\n\nLet's assume at least one isometric embedding $f: X \\to B$ exists. We can use this to construct other embeddings.\n\n1.  **Translations:** For any vector $v \\in B$, consider the map $g_v(x) = f(x) + v$. Let's check if it's an isometric embedding:\n    $\\|g_v(x) - g_v(y)\\| = \\|(f(x) + v) - (f(y) + v)\\| = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|$.\n    Since $f$ is an isometry, this equals $d(x, y)$. So, $g_v$ is also an isometric embedding.\n    If $v_1 \\neq v_2$, then $g_{v_1} \\neq g_{v_2}$ (since $g_{v_1}(x) - g_{v_2}(x) = v_1 - v_2 \\neq 0$).\n    This means that if one embedding exists, there are at least $|B| = K$ embeddings.\n\n2.  **Linear Isometries:** Let $T: B \\to B$ be a linear isometry of $B$ (a linear map such that $\\|T(u)\\| = \\|u\\|$ for all $u \\in B$). Consider the map $h(x) = T(f(x))$. Let's check if it's an isometric embedding:\n    $\\|h(x) - h(y)\\| = \\|T(f(x)) - T(f(y))\\| = \\|T(f(x) - f(y))\\|$.\n    Since $T$ is a linear isometry, this equals $\\|f(x) - f(y)\\|$, which in turn equals $d(x, y)$. So, $h$ is also an isometric embedding.\n\nThis implies that if an embedding exists and $B$ is non-trivial, the number of embeddings is likely to be large. For any non-trivial Banach space over $\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{C}$, the cardinality $K$ is at least $2^{\\aleph_0}$ (the cardinality of the continuum). This would suggest the answer is infinite. However, such questions in mathematics often have a finite integer answer, which suggests we should carefully examine the boundary cases or special conditions.\n\n### Step 3: Consider trivial and degenerate cases\n\nThe problem does not impose any restrictions on $X$ and $B$ beyond their definitions. Let's consider the simplest possible cases.\n\n*   **Simplest Finite Ultrametric Space ($X$):** A space with a single point, say $X = \\{x_1\\}$. The only distance is $d(x_1, x_1) = 0$. This is a valid finite ultrametric space.\n\n*   **Simplest Banach Space ($B$):** The space containing only the zero vector, $B = \\{0\\}$. This is a vector space, and with the norm $\\|0\\| = 0$, it is a complete normed space, hence a Banach space. Its cardinality is $K=1$.\n\nNow, let's combine these two choices and find the number of isometric embeddings.\n\n*   **Let $X = \\{x_1\\}$ and $B = \\{0\\}$.**\n*   We need to find the number of maps $f: \\{x_1\\} \\to \\{0\\}$ that are isometric embeddings.\n*   There is only one possible function: $f(x_1) = 0$.\n*   We must check if this function satisfies the isometry condition: $d(x, y) = \\|f(x) - f(y)\\|$ for all $x, y \\in X$.\n*   The only pair of points is $(x_1, x_1)$. The condition is $d(x_1, x_1) = \\|f(x_1) - f(x_1)\\|$.\n*   Substituting the values, we get $0 = \\|0 - 0\\| = \\|0\\| = 0$.\n*   The condition is satisfied. Therefore, $f(x_1) = 0$ is an isometric embedding.\n*   Since this is the only possible map between these two sets, the number of isometric embeddings is exactly 1.\n\n### Step 4: Conclude the minimum number\n\nWe have found a valid pair $(X, B)$ for which the number of isometric embeddings is 1. The number of embeddings must be a non-negative integer. If we assume the question implies that embeddings must exist, the smallest possible non-zero number is 1. We have successfully constructed a scenario where this minimum is achieved.\n\nIt is not possible to have a smaller non-zero number of embeddings. Therefore, the smallest possible number of isometric embeddings is 1.\n\nThis conclusion holds even if we consider non-archimedean Banach spaces. The same example ($X=\\{x_1\\}, B=\\{0\\}$) is valid in that context as well and yields one embedding. The consideration of more complex cases with multiple points or non-trivial Banach spaces leads to a larger number of embeddings (e.g., at least 2 for a two-point space embedded in $\\mathbb{R}$, and often infinite for more complex spaces). Thus, the minimum is found in the most trivial case."
