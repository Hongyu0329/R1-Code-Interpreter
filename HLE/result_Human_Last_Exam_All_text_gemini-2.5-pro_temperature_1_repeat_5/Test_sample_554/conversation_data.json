    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Name: \"Perfluoronanocar\"**\n    *   **\"Nanocar\"**: This refers to a specific type of nanoscale molecule designed to function like a car, with a chassis and wheels. For this analysis, we will use the structure of the original, iconic nanocar synthesized in 2005 by the research group of Professor James Tour. This molecule consists of a hydrocarbon chassis and four fullerene (C₆₀) wheels.\n    *   **\"Perfluoro-\"**: This is a standard prefix in organic chemistry. It means that **all** of the hydrogen (H) atoms attached to the carbon framework of a molecule have been systematically replaced by fluorine (F) atoms. For example, perfluorobenzene (C₆F₆) is derived from benzene (C₆H₆).\n\n2.  **Identify the Atoms to be Replaced**\n    *   To find out how many fluorine atoms the perfluoronanocar contains, we first need to count the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar molecule. These are the atoms that will be replaced.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Structure of the Nanocar and Count Hydrogen Atoms**\n    *   The nanocar has two main components: the chassis and the wheels.\n    *   **Wheels**: The wheels are four Buckminsterfullerene (C₆₀) molecules. C₆₀ is an allotrope of carbon, and its structure is composed entirely of carbon atoms. **There are no hydrogen atoms on the C₆₀ wheels.**\n    *   **Chassis**: The chassis is the hydrocarbon framework that connects the four wheels. All the hydrogen atoms of the nanocar are located on this chassis. The chassis consists of:\n        *   One central benzene ring that is substituted at two positions (the 1 and 4 positions). A standard benzene ring has 6 hydrogens, so a disubstituted one has 6 - 2 = **4 hydrogen atoms**.\n        *   Two side benzene rings. Each of these is substituted at three positions (the 1, 3, and 5 positions). A trisubstituted benzene ring has 6 - 3 = 3 hydrogen atoms. Since there are two such rings, they contribute 2 × 3 = **6 hydrogen atoms**.\n    *   **Total Hydrogen Count**: Adding the hydrogens from all parts of the chassis gives us the total number of hydrogen atoms in the entire nanocar molecule: 4 (from the central ring) + 6 (from the two side rings) = **10 hydrogen atoms**.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms**\n    *   The term \"perfluoronanocar\" implies that each of the 10 hydrogen atoms on the chassis is replaced by one fluorine atom.\n    *   Therefore, the number of fluorine atoms in a perfluoronanocar would be equal to the number of hydrogen atoms in the original nanocar.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the structure of the original nanocar, there are 10 hydrogen atoms on its chassis. A \"perfluoro-\" version of this molecule would have all 10 of these hydrogens replaced by fluorine atoms.\n\nThus, a hypothetical perfluoronanocar would contain 10 fluorine atoms.\n\n<<<10>>>"
