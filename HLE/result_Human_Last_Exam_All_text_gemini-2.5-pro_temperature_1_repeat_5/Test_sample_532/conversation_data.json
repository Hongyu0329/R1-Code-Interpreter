    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to determine the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Understanding the Definitions**\n\n*   **Finite Group (G):** A group with a finite number of elements.\n*   **Product-Free Set (S):** A subset `S ⊆ G` is product-free if for all `x, y ∈ S` (including the case `x=y`), the product `xy` is not an element of `S`.\n*   **Maximal by Inclusion Product-Free Set (M):** A product-free set `M` is maximal if it is not a proper subset of any other product-free set. In other words, for any element `g ∈ G \\ M`, the set `M ∪ {g}` is not product-free.\n*   **Filled Group (G):** A group `G` is filled if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G` itself.\n*   **Nilpotent Group:** A finite group is nilpotent if and only if it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. A key property is that all quotient groups of a nilpotent group are also nilpotent.\n\n**Step 2: A Careful Point Regarding the Definition of a Filled Group**\n\nLet's examine the definition of a product-free set. For any group `G`, let `e` be the identity element. Can `e` belong to a product-free set `S`?\nIf `e ∈ S`, then for `e` to be in a product-free set, the product `e * e` must not be in `S`. However, `e * e = e`, which we assumed is in `S`. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the identity element `e` can never be a member of any product-free set.\nThis implies that the union of all maximal product-free sets, `⋃ M`, is always a subset of `G \\ {e}`.\nAccording to the literal definition of a filled group (`⋃ M = G`), no group of order greater than 1 can be filled, as the identity `e` will always be missing from the union. The trivial group `{e}` is also not filled because its only product-free set is the empty set.\n\nTo make the problem non-trivial, we must use the standard definition from the mathematical literature on this topic. The definition is slightly modified:\n**Corrected Definition:** A non-trivial finite group `G` is called **filled** if the union of all its maximal product-free sets is equal to `G \\ {e}`. The trivial group is considered not filled.\n\n**Step 3: The Main Theorem for Filled Groups**\n\nA crucial result from a paper by Cameron, Roney-Dougal, and Wright provides a complete characterization of filled groups:\n\n**Theorem:** A non-trivial finite group `G` is filled if and only if there exists a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup `N` (i.e., `{e} ⊂ N ⊂ G`) such that the quotient group `G/N` is non-abelian.\n\nWe will use this theorem to classify the finite filled nilpotent groups.\n\n**Step 4: Applying the Theorem to Nilpotent Groups - Abelian Case**\n\nLet `G` be a finite abelian group. Since all abelian groups are nilpotent, we consider this case first.\nIf `G` is abelian, then for any normal subgroup `N`, the quotient group `G/N` is also abelian.\nTherefore, an abelian group `G` can never have a normal subgroup `N` such that `G/N` is non-abelian.\nAccording to the theorem, this means that **no finite abelian group is filled**.\n\n**Step 5: Applying the Theorem to Nilpotent Groups - Non-Abelian Case**\n\nLet `G` be a non-abelian finite nilpotent group. For `G` to be filled, we need to find if it has a normal subgroup `N` (`{e} ⊂ N ⊂ G`) for which `G/N` is non-abelian.\n\nIt's easier to analyze the opposite condition: when is a non-abelian nilpotent group `G` *not* filled?\nAccording to the theorem, `G` is *not* filled if and only if for *every* proper, non-trivial normal subgroup `N`, the quotient `G/N` is abelian.\n\nA quotient group `G/N` is abelian if and only if the commutator subgroup `G' = [G,G]` is contained in `N`.\nSo, `G` is not filled if and only if `G' ⊆ N` for all normal subgroups `N` where `{e} ⊂ N ⊂ G`.\nThis means `G'` must be contained in the intersection of all such normal subgroups. As `G` is non-abelian, `G'` is non-trivial (`G' ≠ {e}`). This condition implies that `G'` must be the **unique minimal normal subgroup** of `G`.\n\n**Step 6: Characterizing Nilpotent Groups with a Unique Minimal Normal Subgroup**\n\nNow we determine which non-abelian nilpotent groups `G` have a unique minimal normal subgroup.\n\n1.  **`G` must be a p-group:** A finite nilpotent group `G` is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups, `G ≅ P₁ × P₂ × ... × Pₖ`. If `k > 1` (i.e., the order of `G` has more than one distinct prime factor), then `G` has multiple minimal normal subgroups. For example, a minimal normal subgroup of `P₁` and a minimal normal subgroup of `P₂` will generate distinct minimal normal subgroups in `G`. Thus, to have a unique minimal normal subgroup, `G` must be a p-group for some prime `p`.\n\n2.  **For a p-group `G`, `Z(G)` must be cyclic:** A minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order `p`. `G` has a unique minimal normal subgroup if and only if its center `Z(G)` contains exactly one subgroup of order `p`. This occurs if and only if `Z(G)` is a cyclic group.\n\nCombining these, a non-abelian nilpotent group `G` has a unique minimal normal subgroup if and only if `G` is a p-group and its center `Z(G)` is cyclic.\n\n**Step 7: Final Characterization of Filled Nilpotent Groups**\n\nWe can now state the conditions for a non-abelian nilpotent group `G` to be filled.\n\n*   A non-abelian nilpotent group `G` is **not filled** if and only if its commutator subgroup `G'` is its unique minimal normal subgroup. This requires:\n    1.  `G` must have a unique minimal normal subgroup (so `G` is a p-group and `Z(G)` is cyclic).\n    2.  `G'` must be that minimal normal subgroup. Since a minimal normal subgroup of a p-group has order `p`, this means `|G'| = p`.\n\n*   Therefore, a non-abelian finite nilpotent group `G` is **filled** if it does *not* meet these conditions. This leads to the final characterization.\n\nA finite nilpotent group `G` is filled if and only if it is **non-abelian** and one of the following conditions holds:\n1.  **`G` is not a p-group.** (i.e., its order is divisible by at least two distinct primes). This ensures `G` has multiple minimal normal subgroups, so `G'` cannot be the unique one.\n2.  **`G` is a p-group, and its center `Z(G)` is not cyclic.** This also ensures `G` has multiple minimal normal subgroups.\n3.  **`G` is a p-group, and its commutator subgroup `G'` has order greater than `p`** (i.e., `|G'| > p`). This ensures `G'` is not a minimal normal subgroup.\n\nThese three conditions cover all non-abelian nilpotent groups except for those that are not filled (p-groups with cyclic center and commutator of order p).\n\n***\n\n### Final Answer\n\nA finite nilpotent group G is a filled group if and only if it is non-abelian and satisfies at least one of the following three conditions:\n1.  G is not a p-group.\n2.  G is a p-group and its center, Z(G), is not a cyclic group.\n3.  G is a p-group and its commutator subgroup, G', has an order strictly greater than p.\n\nAbelian groups are not filled.\n\n<<<A finite nilpotent group G is filled if and only if it is non-abelian and at least one of the following conditions is true: (1) G is not a p-group; (2) G is a p-group and its center Z(G) is not cyclic; (3) G is a p-group and its commutator subgroup G' has order greater than p.>>>"
