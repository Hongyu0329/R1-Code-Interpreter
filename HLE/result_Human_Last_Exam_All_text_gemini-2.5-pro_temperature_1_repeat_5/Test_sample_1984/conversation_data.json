    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n**Step 1: Find the equilibrium points**\n\nAn equilibrium point of the differential equation $x'(t) = f(x(t))$ is a value of $x$ for which $x'(t) = 0$. These are the constant solutions to the differential equation.\nWe need to solve the equation:\n$$ -x^{3} + 2x^{2} - x = 0 $$\nLet's factor the polynomial on the left side:\n$$ -x(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe quadratic term is a perfect square: $x^2 - 2x + 1 = (x-1)^2$.\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$ -x(x-1)^2 = 0 $$\nThe roots of this equation are the equilibrium points. They are:\n$$ x = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1 $$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the stability of each equilibrium point**\n\nTo determine the stability of an equilibrium point $x^*$, we can use the first derivative test. Let $f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 - x$. We analyze the sign of the derivative $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point.\nThe derivative of $f(x)$ is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^3 + 2x^2 - x) = -3x^2 + 4x - 1 $$\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 0$:**\n    We evaluate $f'(0)$:\n    $$ f'(0) = -3(0)^2 + 4(0) - 1 = -1 $$\n    Since $f'(0) < 0$, the equilibrium point $x = 0$ is **stable**.\n\n*   **For the equilibrium point $x = 1$:**\n    We evaluate $f'(1)$:\n    $$ f'(1) = -3(1)^2 + 4(1) - 1 = -3 + 4 - 1 = 0 $$\n    Since $f'(1) = 0$, the first derivative test is inconclusive. We must use another method, such as analyzing the sign of $f(x)$ in the neighborhood of $x=1$. This is also called a phase line analysis.\n    The function is $f(x) = -x(x-1)^2$.\n    *   Consider a value of $x$ slightly less than 1, for example, $x = 0.9$.\n        $f(0.9) = -0.9(0.9 - 1)^2 = -0.9(-0.1)^2 = -0.9(0.01) = -0.009 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$ for $x$ just below 1, solutions starting here will decrease, moving away from $x=1$.\n    *   Consider a value of $x$ slightly greater than 1, for example, $x = 1.1$.\n        $f(1.1) = -1.1(1.1 - 1)^2 = -1.1(0.1)^2 = -1.1(0.01) = -0.011 < 0$.\n        Since $x'(t) = f(x) < 0$ for $x$ just above 1, solutions starting here will decrease, moving towards $x=1$.\n\n    For an equilibrium to be stable, solutions on both sides must converge to it. Since solutions starting to the left of $x=1$ move away from it, $x=1$ is not a stable equilibrium. It is classified as a **semistable** equilibrium.\n\n**Step 3: Find the value of m**\n\nThe problem states that $m$ is the number of stable equilibrium points. Based on our analysis in Step 2, there is only one stable equilibrium point, which is $x=0$.\nTherefore, $m = 1$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the final expression**\n\nWe are asked to find the value of $m - 2^{4048}$.\nSubstituting $m=1$ into the expression, we get:\n$$ 1 - 2^{4048} $$\n\n<<<1 - 2^{4048}>>>"
