    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Setting up the Context**\n\nThe problem is situated in finite-temperature quantum field theory for a neutral scalar field, $\\phi$. The central object is the partition function, $Z$, which is expressed as a functional integral over all possible field configurations. In finite-temperature theory, we use the imaginary time formalism (also known as the Matsubara formalism).\n\nKey features of this formalism are:\n*   We work in Euclidean spacetime, where the time coordinate is imaginary, $t \\to -i\\tau$.\n*   The Euclidean time coordinate $\\tau$ is compactified on a circle of circumference $\\beta = 1/T$, where $T$ is the temperature. This means $\\tau \\in [0, \\beta)$.\n*   For a neutral scalar field (which is a boson), the field configurations $\\phi(\\tau, \\vec{x})$ must satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the time direction: $\\phi(0, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\vec{x})$.\n\n**Step 2: The Partition Function and the Euclidean Action**\n\nThe partition function is given by the functional integral:\n$Z = \\int \\mathcal{D}\\phi \\, e^{-S_E[\\phi]}$\n\nHere, $S_E[\\phi]$ is the Euclidean action for the field $\\phi$. For a free, massive, neutral scalar field, the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\\mathcal{L}_E$ is:\n$\\mathcal{L}_E = \\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2$\n\nIn Euclidean signature, the metric is the identity matrix, so $(\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) = (\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2$. The action is the integral of the Lagrangian density over the 4D Euclidean spacetime volume:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau \\int d^3x \\, \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}((\\partial_\\tau \\phi)^2 + (\\nabla\\phi)^2) + \\frac{1}{2}m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n\n**Step 3: Rewriting the Action in a Quadratic Form**\n\nThe goal is to express the action in a form that resembles $\\frac{1}{2}\\phi D \\phi$. We can achieve this by using integration by parts on the kinetic term $\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^4x_E (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2$.\n\n$\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)(\\partial^\\mu \\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\left( \\partial_\\mu (\\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi) - \\phi (\\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu \\phi) \\right)$\n\nThe first term, $\\partial_\\mu (\\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi)$, is a total derivative. By Gauss's theorem, its integral over the volume is an integral over the boundary. These boundary terms vanish:\n*   At spatial infinity, we assume the fields vanish.\n*   For the temporal dimension, the periodic boundary condition $\\phi(0, \\vec{x}) = \\phi(\\beta, \\vec{x})$ makes the boundary contributions at $\\tau=0$ and $\\tau=\\beta$ cancel out.\n\nTherefore, we are left with:\n$\\int d^4x_E \\, (\\partial_\\mu \\phi)^2 = - \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi (\\partial^2 \\phi)$\nwhere $\\partial^2 = \\partial_\\mu \\partial^\\mu = \\partial_\\tau^2 + \\nabla^2$ is the 4D Euclidean Laplacian operator.\n\nSubstituting this back into the action expression:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\left[ \\phi(-\\partial^2)\\phi + m^2\\phi^2 \\right]$\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nLet's define the operator $D \\equiv -\\partial^2 + m^2$. This is the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator. The action for the free field is now compactly written as:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) [D\\phi(x)]$\n\n**Step 4: Defining and Calculating the Inner Product**\n\nThe question asks for the inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$. In this context:\n*   The notation $(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ represents the standard $L^2$ inner product for real-valued functions over the 4D Euclidean spacetime. For two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, this is defined as:\n    $(f, g) = \\int d^4x_E \\, f(x)g(x)$\n*   The notation $D_\\phi$ is standardly interpreted as the operator $D$ acting on the field $\\phi$, i.e., $D\\phi$.\n\nUsing this definition, we can compute the inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) [D\\phi(x)]$\n\nSubstituting the explicit form of the operator $D = -\\partial^2 + m^2$:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\n**Step 5: Connecting the Inner Product to the Action**\n\nNow, we compare the result from Step 4 with the expression for the Euclidean action from Step 3.\n\n*   Euclidean Action: $S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n*   Inner Product: $(\\phi, D\\phi) = \\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$\n\nBy direct comparison, we find the simple relationship:\n$S_E[\\phi] = \\frac{1}{2} (\\phi, D\\phi)$\n\nTherefore, the inner product is twice the Euclidean action for the free scalar field:\n$(\\phi, D\\phi) = 2S_E[\\phi]$\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n\n1.  **Euclidean vs. Minkowski:** The entire analysis is performed in Euclidean spacetime, as is standard for finite-temperature calculations. The operator $D = -\\partial^2 + m^2$ is the Euclidean version of the Klein-Gordon operator.\n2.  **Operator Definition:** The operator $D$ is positive-definite, which is crucial for the convergence of the Gaussian functional integral. The minus sign from integration by parts ensures this.\n3.  **Boundary Conditions:** The use of integration by parts is justified by the periodic boundary conditions imposed on the bosonic field $\\phi$ in the compact imaginary time direction.\n4.  **Free Field Theory:** This analysis is strictly for the quadratic part of the action, which corresponds to a free field theory. If interaction terms were present, the total action would have additional terms, but the inner product $(\\phi, D\\phi)$ would still be defined in relation to the quadratic (free) part of the action.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe inner product $(\\phi, D_\\phi)$, where $D_\\phi$ represents the Euclidean Klein-Gordon operator $D = (-\\partial^2 + m^2)$ acting on the field $\\phi$, is given by the integral $\\int d^4x_E \\, \\phi(x) (-\\partial^2 + m^2) \\phi(x)$. This is precisely twice the Euclidean action, $S_E[\\phi]$, for a free neutral scalar field.\n\n<<<2$S_E[\\phi]$>>>"
