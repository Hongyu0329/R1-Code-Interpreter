    "This is a step-by-step analysis of the problem and the provided code.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Programming Problem\n\n1.  **Goal:** Calculate the final value of a variable `x` after executing a sequence of statements.\n2.  **Initial State:** The variable `x` starts at 0.\n3.  **Input:**\n    *   An integer `n`, the number of statements.\n    *   `n` lines, each containing one statement.\n4.  **Statements:** There are two operations, `++` (increment `x` by 1) and `--` (decrement `x` by 1). A statement consists of one operation and the variable 'X'.\n5.  **Possible Statements:** The operation and variable can be in any order. This gives four possible statement strings:\n    *   `\"++X\"` (pre-increment)\n    *   `\"X++\"` (post-increment)\n    *   `\"--X\"` (pre-decrement)\n    *   `\"X--\"` (post-decrement)\n    *   **Careful Point:** For this problem, the distinction between pre- and post- operations is irrelevant. Both `\"++X\"` and `\"X++\"` simply increase `x` by 1. Both `\"--X\"` and `\"X--\"` simply decrease `x` by 1.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Submitted Java Program\n\n1.  **Logic:** The program reads `n` (as `t`), initializes a result `tresult` to 0, and loops `n` times.\n2.  **Core Operation:** Inside the loop, it reads the statement string `test` and uses `if` conditions to check its content.\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"++X\")) { tresult++; }`\n    *   `if (test.contains(\"--X\")) { tresult--; }`\n3.  **Flaw Identification:** The `String.contains()` method checks if a specific sequence of characters exists within the string.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X++\"`, `test.contains(\"++X\")` will be `false`, and `test.contains(\"--X\")` will also be `false`. No operation is performed on `tresult`. This is incorrect.\n    *   If the input statement is `\"X--\"` a similar failure occurs.\n    *   The code only works correctly for the pre-fix statements (`\"++X\"` and `\"--X\"`).\n4.  **Conclusion:** The provided program does not solve the problem correctly because it fails to handle post-fix operations.\n\n### Step 3: Design the Most Efficient C Program\n\nThe goal is the fastest execution (fewest operations) and least memory usage.\n\n#### A. Fastest Logic (Minimizing Comparisons)\n\n1.  We need to distinguish between increment and decrement statements.\n2.  Let's examine the four possible strings: `\"X++\"`, `\"++X\"`, `\"X--\"`, `\"--X\"`.\n3.  **Careful Point:** A key observation is that any statement containing `+` characters is an increment, and any statement containing `-` characters is a decrement.\n4.  An even simpler observation is to look at a specific character position. The character at index 1 (the middle character) is always part of the operator.\n    *   For `\"++X\"`, the character at index 1 is `'+'`.\n    *   For `\"X++\"`, the character at index 1 is `'+'`.\n    *   For `\"--X\"`, the character at index 1 is `'-'`.\n    *   For `\"X--`, the character at index 1 is `'-'`.\n5.  **Optimal Strategy:** Therefore, we can read the statement and check only the character at index 1. If it's `'+'`, we increment; otherwise, we decrement. This requires only **one character comparison** per statement.\n6.  For an input of 100 instructions, this strategy results in a total of `100 * 1 = 100` character comparisons. This is the value of `x`.\n\n#### B. Least Memory Usage (Minimizing Bytes)\n\n1.  We need to declare variables to solve the problem. To minimize memory, we should choose the smallest possible standard data types for each variable.\n2.  **Variable for `n`:** The problem states `1 <= n <= 150`. An `unsigned char` can store values from 0 to 255, so it is sufficient for `n` and uses **1 byte**.\n3.  **Variable for `x`:** The variable `x` starts at 0. In the worst case, all 150 operations are the same (e.g., all increments). The final value would be 150. In the other worst case, it would be -150. So `x` must be able to hold values in the range `[-150, 150]`.\n    *   A `signed char` (range -128 to 127) is not large enough.\n    *   The next smallest standard type is a `short int`, which can hold values from -32,768 to 32,767 and uses **2 bytes**.\n4.  **Variable for Input:** To perform the check on the middle character, we need to read the input. Instead of storing the entire 3-character string in an array (which would take at least 4 bytes for the string and null terminator), we can read character by character and only store the middle one in a single `char` variable. This requires **1 byte**.\n5.  **Total Minimum Memory:** Summing the memory for these variables gives the minimum required size: `1 byte (for n) + 2 bytes (for x) + 1 byte (for input char) = 4 bytes`. This is the value of `y`.\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer Formulation\n\n*   Does the program solve the problem? **No**.\n*   The answer format is `Nx+y`.\n*   The prefix is `N`.\n*   `x` is the smallest number of character comparisons for 100 instructions, which is `100`.\n*   `y` is the smallest memory size in Bytes, which is `4`.\n*   The final answer is `N100+4`.\n\n<<<N100+4>>>"
