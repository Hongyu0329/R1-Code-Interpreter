    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the problem to compute the determinant of the given matrix.\n\n**1. Understand the Question**\n\nThe core of the question is to compute the determinant of the 3x3 matrix:\n\\[\nA = \\begin{bmatrix} \n2 & -1 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\ \n-1 & -1 & 2 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\nThe question also provides context: \"the adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver for \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\)\". We need to determine if this context affects the calculation.\n\n**2. Analyze the Contextual Information (Careful Points)**\n\n*   **Markov Quiver:** A quiver is a directed graph used in representation theory. The \"Markov quiver\" is related to the Markov equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz\\). The matrix `A` given is the Cartan matrix associated with this quiver (specifically, a quiver of type \\( \\tilde{A}_2 \\)). This confirms the name is appropriate for the given matrix.\n*   **\\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\):** The numbers that solve the Markov equation are called Markov numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 5, 13, 29, ...). The number 13 is a Markov number. However, the matrix `A` defines the fundamental structure and transformation rules for the associated system. It does not change based on a specific solution or state like a particular Markov number.\n*   **Conclusion on Context:** The information about the Markov quiver and \\( m_{1/2} = 13 \\) serves to identify the matrix `A` within a specific mathematical field but does not alter the matrix itself for this calculation. The task remains to find the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix `A`.\n\n**3. Step-by-Step Calculation of the Determinant**\n\nWe can calculate the determinant of a 3x3 matrix using several methods.\n\n**Method 1: The Rule of Sarrus (Cofactor Expansion)**\n\nThe formula for the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is:\n\\[ \\det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg) \\]\nFor our matrix `A`:\n*   a = 2, b = -1, c = -1\n*   d = -1, e = 2, f = -1\n*   g = -1, h = -1, i = 2\n\nLet's substitute these values:\n*   First term: \\( 2 \\times ((2)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = 2 \\times (4 - 1) = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n*   Second term: \\( -(-1) \\times ((-1)(2) - (-1)(-1)) = 1 \\times (-2 - 1) = 1 \\times (-3) = -3 \\)\n*   Third term: \\( (-1) \\times ((-1)(-1) - (2)(-1)) = -1 \\times (1 - (-2)) = -1 \\times (1 + 2) = -1 \\times 3 = -3 \\)\n\nNow, sum the results:\n\\[ \\det(A) = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0 \\]\n\n**Method 2: Using Row Operations**\n\nA key property of determinants is that if the rows (or columns) of a matrix are linearly dependent, its determinant is zero. Let's check for linear dependence by summing the rows.\n*   Row 1: [2, -1, -1]\n*   Row 2: [-1, 2, -1]\n*   Row 3: [-1, -1, 2]\n\nSum of rows = [ (2 + (-1) + (-1)), (-1 + 2 + (-1)), (-1 + (-1) + 2) ]\nSum of rows = [ (2 - 1 - 1), (-1 + 2 - 1), (-1 - 1 + 2) ]\nSum of rows = [ 0, 0, 0 ]\n\nSince the sum of the three row vectors is the zero vector (\\(R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 0\\)), the rows are linearly dependent. A matrix with linearly dependent rows has a determinant of 0.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nBoth methods confirm that the determinant of the matrix `A` is 0.\n\n<<<0>>>"
