    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1.  **Identify the Base Health in Expert Mode:**\n    The first step is to find the starting health of the Eye of Cthulhu in an Expert Mode world with a single player. According to the game's source code, the Eye of Cthulhu has a base health of 2800 in Normal Mode. In Expert Mode, its health is increased to **3640**. This is our baseline value.\n\n2.  **Understand Multiplayer Health Scaling:**\n    Terraria increases boss health for each player in a world to maintain a challenge. In Expert Mode, the game applies an additional health bonus for every player present after the first one.\n\n3.  **Determine the Scaling Factor:**\n    The source code specifies a health scaling factor of **35% (0.35)** per additional player in Expert Mode. This means for each player from the second one onwards, the boss gains an additional 35% of its Expert Mode base health.\n\n4.  **Formulate the Health Equation:**\n    We can create a formula to calculate the boss's health (`H`) based on the number of players (`P`).\n    *   The health for one player is the base Expert Mode health: `3640`.\n    *   The extra health added per additional player is `3640 * 0.35`, which equals `1274`.\n    *   The number of *additional* players is `P - 1`.\n\n    The complete formula is:\n    `H(P) = [Expert Base Health] + ([Health added per additional player] * [Number of additional players])`\n    `H(P) = 3640 + (1274 * (P - 1))`\n\n    Simplifying this equation gives us a linear relationship:\n    `H(P) = 3640 + 1274P - 1274`\n    `H(P) = 1274P + 2366`\n\n5.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:**\n    The question asks for the theoretical maximum health given an *infinite* number of players. Mathematically, as the number of players `P` approaches infinity (`P -> âˆž`), the health `H(P)` in our linear equation also approaches infinity.\n\n6.  **Consider the Game's Technical Limitations:**\n    A computer program cannot store a value of infinity. The health of an NPC in Terraria is stored in a variable. Specifically, the `lifeMax` property is a **32-bit signed integer** (an `int`). This data type has a fixed maximum value. The \"theoretical maximum\" in the context of a video game refers to the highest value that can be stored in this variable before it overflows. The condition of \"infinite players\" in the question is a hypothetical used to push the health scaling to this technical limit, ignoring other constraints like the in-game player cap.\n\n7.  **Identify the Maximum Value:**\n    The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer is `2^31 - 1`. Calculating this gives us the absolute ceiling for the Eye of Cthulhu's health within the game's engine.\n\n    `2^31 - 1 = 2,147,483,647`\n\n### Final Conclusion\n\nThe health of the Eye of Cthulhu increases linearly with the number of players and has no mathematical upper bound. However, the game engine stores this value in a 32-bit signed integer, which has a maximum possible value. Therefore, the theoretical maximum health is limited by the data type's maximum value.\n\n<<<2147483647>>>"
