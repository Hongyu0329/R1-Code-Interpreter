    "Here is a step-by-step analysis to determine the number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G calculation of toluene.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule's Composition\n*   The molecule is toluene.\n*   The chemical formula is C7H8.\n*   This means the molecule contains 7 Carbon (C) atoms and 8 Hydrogen (H) atoms.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the 6-31G Basis Set Notation\nThe 6-31G basis set is a Pople-style split-valence basis set. The name describes how atomic orbitals are represented by contracted Gaussian functions (CGFs). We need to analyze its meaning for both Carbon and Hydrogen atoms.\n\n*   **For Carbon (a second-row, non-hydrogen atom):**\n    *   The hyphen separates the description of core and valence orbitals.\n    *   **`6-`**: This part describes the core orbitals (in Carbon's case, the 1s orbital). It means the 1s orbital is represented by a single **contracted** Gaussian function, which is formed by a linear combination of 6 primitive Gaussian functions.\n        *   Core functions for C: 1 CGF.\n    *   **`-31G`**: This part describes the valence orbitals (for Carbon, the 2s and 2p orbitals). The valence shell is \"split\" into two parts, an inner and an outer part, to provide more flexibility.\n        *   **Inner Valence (`3`)**: The inner part of each valence orbital (one 2s and three 2p orbitals) is described by a single CGF, each formed from 3 primitive Gaussians. This gives 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4 CGFs.\n        *   **Outer Valence (`1`)**: The outer part of each valence orbital is described by a single CGF, each formed from just 1 primitive Gaussian. This gives another 1 (for 2s) + 3 (for 2p) = 4 CGFs.\n    *   **Total CGFs per Carbon atom**: 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n*   **For Hydrogen (a first-row atom):**\n    *   Hydrogen has no core electrons, so only the valence part of the notation applies. For hydrogen, 6-31G is interpreted as 31G.\n    *   **`31G`**: The 1s valence orbital is split into two parts.\n        *   **Inner Valence (`3`)**: The inner part of the 1s orbital is described by one CGF formed from 3 primitive Gaussians.\n        *   **Outer Valence (`1`)**: The outer part of the 1s orbital is described by one CGF formed from 1 primitive Gaussian.\n    *   **Total CGFs per Hydrogen atom**: 1 (inner valence) + 1 (outer valence) = **2 contracted Gaussian functions**.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Contracted Functions for Toluene (C7H8)\nNow, we combine the information from the previous steps.\n\n*   **Contribution from Carbon atoms:**\n    *   Number of Carbon atoms = 7\n    *   Number of CGFs per Carbon atom = 9\n    *   Total from Carbon = 7 atoms × 9 CGFs/atom = 63 CGFs\n\n*   **Contribution from Hydrogen atoms:**\n    *   Number of Hydrogen atoms = 8\n    *   Number of CGFs per Hydrogen atom = 2\n    *   Total from Hydrogen = 8 atoms × 2 CGFs/atom = 16 CGFs\n\n*   **Total for the molecule:**\n    *   Total CGFs = (Total from Carbon) + (Total from Hydrogen)\n    *   Total CGFs = 63 + 16 = 79\n\n### Careful Points to Note\n1.  **Molecule Composition:** Correctly identify the number of each type of atom in the molecule (7 C, 8 H for toluene).\n2.  **Basis Set Interpretation:** Understand that the notation (6-31G) applies differently to hydrogen vs. heavier atoms.\n3.  **Contracted vs. Primitive Functions:** The question specifically asks for **contracted** functions, not the underlying primitive functions. For a single carbon atom, there are 9 contracted functions but 22 primitive functions (6 + 4*3 + 4*1).\n4.  **Valence Splitting:** Recognize that \"31\" means the valence shell is represented by two sets of basis functions (a \"double-zeta\" valence description). For carbon, this applies to the 2s and all three 2p orbitals.\n\n### Final Answer Calculation\nTotal Functions = (Number of C atoms × Functions per C) + (Number of H atoms × Functions per H)\nTotal Functions = (7 × 9) + (8 × 2)\nTotal Functions = 63 + 16\nTotal Functions = 79\n\n<<<79>>>"
