Yes, the exotic ammonia molecule would still exhibit tunneling. The tunneling phenomenon is a consequence of the double-well potential for the nitrogen atom, which depends on the masses and charges of the nuclei, not their spins. The nuclear spin statistics (i.e., the Pauli principle) only impose symmetry constraints on the total wavefunction, determining which rotational states are allowed to combine with the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrational states of the tunneling doublet. For spin-0 hydrogen nuclei (bosons), the constraints are different from those for spin-1/2 protons (fermions), but they still permit the existence of both levels of the doublet. Since both energy levels exist, the energy splitting due to tunneling would be present and observable.
