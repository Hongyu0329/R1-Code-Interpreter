    "Here is a step-by-step analysis of the reaction to determine the final product.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Starting Material**\nThe starting material is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide**.\n*   **Benzamide**: This is the parent structure, consisting of a benzene ring attached to a C(=O)N group.\n*   **N,N-diethyl**: Two ethyl groups (-CH₂CH₃) are attached to the nitrogen atom of the amide.\n*   **3-dimethylamino**: A dimethylamino group (-N(CH₃)₂) is attached at the C3 position (meta) relative to the benzamide group (at C1).\n\nThe structure is:\n```\n      CON(Et)₂ (at C1)\n     /\n  --C--\n //  \\\\\nC(2)  C(6)\n \\\\  //\n  C(3)--N(CH₃)₂\n / \\\nH-C(4) C(5)-H\n  \\ /\n   C\n   |\n   H\n```\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Reagents and Reaction Conditions**\n*   **Reagent 1: sec-BuLi and TMEDA in THF.**\n    *   `sec-BuLi` (sec-Butyllithium) is a very strong organometallic base.\n    *   `TMEDA` (N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylethylenediamine) is a chelating agent for the lithium ion (Li⁺). It breaks up organolithium aggregates and increases the basicity of the carbanion, making it more reactive.\n    *   This combination is the classic reagent system for **Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM)**. This reaction involves the deprotonation of a C-H bond on an aromatic ring that is *ortho* to a specific functional group called a **Directed Metalating Group (DMG)**.\n\n*   **Reagent 2: Methyl iodide (CH₃I).**\n    *   This is a simple alkyl halide that acts as an electrophile. It is used to introduce a methyl group onto a nucleophile.\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Directed Metalating Groups (DMGs) and Determine Regioselectivity**\nThe starting material has two potential DMGs:\n1.  The **N,N-diethylcarboxamide group (-CONEt₂)** at C1. The oxygen atom can coordinate to the lithium ion.\n2.  The **dimethylamino group (-NMe₂) **at C3. The nitrogen lone pair can coordinate to the lithium ion.\n\nTo predict the reaction site, we must compare the directing strength of these two groups. The established order of directing ability for common DMGs is:\n**-CONR₂ > -NR₂**\n\nTherefore, the **amide group (-CONEt₂) is the more powerful DMG** and will control the position of the deprotonation (lithiation).\n\n**Step 4: Determine the Site of Deprotonation (Lithiation)**\nThe DoM reaction deprotonates a proton *ortho* to the strongest DMG.\n*   The positions ortho to the -CONEt₂ group (at C1) are **C2** and **C6**.\n*   We must now decide between C2 and C6. The C2 position is not only ortho to the strong amide DMG but also ortho to the weaker dimethylamino DMG at C3. This means both groups synergistically direct the deprotonation to the C2 position.\n*   This cooperative effect makes the proton at C2 significantly more acidic and kinetically favorable for abstraction than the proton at C6.\n*   As a result, sec-BuLi will selectively remove the proton at C2, forming a highly reactive aryllithium intermediate.\n\n**Intermediate:**\n```\n      CON(Et)₂\n     /\n  --C--\n //  \\\\\nC-Li  C-H\n \\\\  //\n  --C--N(CH₃)₂\n /\n...\n```\n\n**Step 5: Reaction with the Electrophile (Methyl Iodide)**\nThe aryllithium intermediate formed in the first step is a potent nucleophile (a carbanion at C2).\n*   When methyl iodide (CH₃I) is added, the carbanion at C2 attacks the electrophilic methyl group.\n*   This nucleophilic attack displaces the iodide ion (I⁻), forming a new C-C bond between the C2 of the ring and the methyl group.\n\n**Step 6: Identify the Final Product**\nThe reaction replaces the hydrogen atom at the C2 position with a methyl group.\n*   The starting molecule was N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylaminobenzamide.\n*   The final product has an additional methyl group at the C2 position.\n*   The name of the final product is **N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide**.\n\n### Summary of Careful Points\n1.  **Reaction Type:** The reaction is a Directed ortho-Metalation (DoM) followed by an electrophilic quench.\n2.  **DMG Strength:** The amide (-CONR₂) is a much stronger directing group than the tertiary amine (-NR₂), so it controls the regioselectivity.\n3.  **Synergistic Effect:** The C2 position is ortho to both directing groups, making it the exclusive site of deprotonation.\n4.  **Electrophilic Quench:** The aryllithium intermediate is a strong nucleophile that readily reacts with the methyl iodide electrophile.\n\n<<<N,N-diethyl-3-dimethylamino-2-methylbenzamide>>>"
