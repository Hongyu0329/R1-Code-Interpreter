The common eigenvalues are pairs of (Eigenvalue of $J^2$, Eigenvalue of $J_z$).
For j = 1/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is (3/4)ħ². The corresponding J_z eigenvalues are (1/2)ħ and -(1/2)ħ.
For j = 3/2, the J^2 eigenvalue is (15/4)ħ². The corresponding J_z eigenvalues are (3/2)ħ, (1/2)ħ, -(1/2)ħ, and -(3/2)ħ.
