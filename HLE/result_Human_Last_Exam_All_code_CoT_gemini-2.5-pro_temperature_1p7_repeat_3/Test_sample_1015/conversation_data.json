    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the correct answer.\n\nFirst, I will analyze the core principles of the *cambré derrière* (a backward bend of the torso) in both the Vaganova and Balanchine methods of ballet training.\n\n1.  **Vaganova Method Analysis:** This method, foundational to Russian ballet, emphasizes extreme strength, stability, and control from the core. In a *cambré derrière*, the primary rule is to maintain a perfectly square and stable alignment of the hips and shoulders. The bend must originate from the upper back, creating a clean, controlled arc while the lower body remains firmly in place.\n2.  **Balanchine Method Analysis:** Developed for the neoclassical style, this method prioritizes speed, musicality, and creating dynamic, elongated lines. To achieve a deeper and more dramatic backbend in *cambré derrière*, the Balanchine technique often permits the dancer to release the hip of the working leg. This adjustment in the pelvis allows for a greater range of motion in the spine.\n3.  **Logical Deduction:** While other elements like head placement and the degree of the bend are also different, they are often results of the foundational difference in the hips. Releasing the hip (Balanchine) directly allows for a deeper bend than keeping the hips square (Vaganova). Therefore, the placement of the hip is the most fundamental technical distinction.\n\nI will now create a Python script to formalize this logic and print the conclusion.\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the technical differences between Vaganova and Balanchine\n    for a cambré derrière to determine the correct answer.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Define the core principles for each method regarding hip placement.\n    vaganova_hip_principle = \"Hips must be kept square and stable to the front.\"\n    balanchine_hip_principle = \"Hip of the working leg may release to achieve a deeper bend.\"\n\n    # Represent the options provided.\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Arm placement during allongé',\n        'B': 'Placement of hip',\n        'C': 'Speed',\n        'D': 'Degree of backbend',\n        'E': 'Placement of head'\n    }\n\n    # The \"equation\" here is a logical deduction based on technical principles.\n    # The fundamental cause of the stylistic difference is the hip alignment.\n    # A different hip alignment (Cause) leads to a different degree of backbend (Effect).\n    # Therefore, we identify the cause as the primary difference.\n    \n    # Logical Equation:\n    # IF Vaganova_Hip_Placement != Balanchine_Hip_Placement:\n    #     conclusion = \"The placement of the hip is the primary difference.\"\n    # ELSE:\n    #     conclusion = \"Another factor is the primary difference.\"\n\n    # Since the principles are different, the conclusion is true.\n    correct_answer_key = 'B'\n    \n    print(\"Analysis of Cambré Derrière:\")\n    print(\"=============================\")\n    print(f\"Vaganova Principle: {vaganova_hip_principle}\")\n    print(f\"Balanchine Principle: {balanchine_hip_principle}\")\n    print(\"\\nConclusion:\")\n    print(\"The difference in hip placement is the fundamental technical distinction.\")\n    print(\"This core difference in pelvic alignment allows for other stylistic variations,\")\n    print(\"such as a deeper backbend or different head placement.\")\n    print(\"\\n-----------------------------\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer Determination: Option '{correct_answer_key}' which is '{options[correct_answer_key]}'.\")\n\n# Execute the analysis and print the result.\nsolve_ballet_question()\n```\n<<<B>>>"
