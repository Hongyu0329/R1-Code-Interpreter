# The property of a feedforward neural network that determines its optimal parameters
# under a perturbation theory interpretation (up to second order) is the
# magnitude of weight initialization.
#
# This magnitude acts as a control knob for the training regime:
# - Large initialization magnitude leads to "lazy training", where the network behaves
#   like a linear model and first-order theory (like the Neural Tangent Kernel) is sufficient.
# - Smaller initialization magnitude allows for "feature learning", where weights move
#   significantly from their initial values. Capturing this behavior requires
#   second-order (and higher) corrections to the perturbation theory.
#
# Therefore, the initialization magnitude determines the relative importance of the
# first-order and second-order terms in the perturbative expansion.
