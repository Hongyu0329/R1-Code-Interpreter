    "This is a biological question, not a computational one, so a script is not applicable. I will provide the answer directly based on cephalopod neuroanatomy.\n\nThe palliovisceral lobe is a major part of the posterior subesophageal mass in the cuttlefish brain. The most prominent brain region lying adjacent and functionally posterior to it is the **giant fiber lobe**. The giant fiber lobe houses the neurons that give rise to the giant axons, which control the powerful jet propulsion escape reflex by innervating the mantle muscles. These axons extend posteriorly from the brain.\n\n<<<The giant fiber lobe.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which brain regions lie adjacent posteriorly to the palliovisceral lobe in the dwarf cuttlefish?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
