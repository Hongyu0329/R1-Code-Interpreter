    print("   - Safety: Ensures nothing 'bad' happens. The confirmed history is correct and immutable. Invalid transactions are not confirmed.")
    print("   - Liveness: Ensures something 'good' eventually happens. Valid transactions eventually get included in the chain.")

    print("3. Evaluate Liveness:")
    print("   - Liveness requires the system to make progress and eventually include valid transactions.")
    print("   - A 1-day halt means the system is not making progress.")
    print("   - Therefore, it is for sure that LIVENESS is broken.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Step 4: Evaluate Safety ---
    print("4. Evaluate Safety:")
    print("   - Safety requires the existing chain to be correct and unalterable.")
    print("   - The scenario does not state that any past transactions have been changed or that any invalid transactions have been added.")
    print("   - The chain has simply stopped. The existing history could still be perfectly correct.")
    print("   - Therefore, SAFETY may not be broken. We cannot be sure it is.")
    print("-" * 20)

    # --- Step 5: Conclude the correct answer ---
    print("5. Conclusion:")
    print("   - Based on the analysis, liveness is definitely broken, while safety is not necessarily broken.")
    print("   - This corresponds to answer choice B.")
