# The reasoning above reduces the problem to a calculation involving
# Euler's totient function, phi.
# The dimension of the cohomology group H^2(G,M) is the sum:
# phi(2) + phi(4) + phi(8).
#
# We calculate these values and their sum.

# phi(n) = n * product_{p|n, p is prime} (1 - 1/p)
# phi(2) for p=2 is 2 * (1 - 1/2) = 1
val1 = 2
phi1 = 1

# phi(4) = phi(2^2), for p=2 is 4 * (1 - 1/2) = 2
val2 = 4
phi2 = 2

# phi(8) = phi(2^3), for p=2 is 8 * (1 - 1/2) = 4
val3 = 8
phi3 = 4

# The final dimension is the sum of these values.
total_dimension = phi1 + phi2 + phi3
