    "To determine the IUPAC name of the product, we need to analyze the reaction step-by-step.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants and Reaction Type:** The reactants are methyl phenyl sulfoxide, triflic anhydride, and trimethylsilyl cyanide. This combination points towards a Pummerer-type reaction, where a sulfoxide is activated and then undergoes a rearrangement or is intercepted by a nucleophile.\n2.  **Step 1: Activation of the Sulfoxide:** The oxygen atom of the methyl phenyl sulfoxide is nucleophilic and attacks the highly electrophilic triflic anhydride. This forms a sulfoxonium salt intermediate, [Ph-S(OTf)-Me]⁺, with triflate (TfO⁻) as the counter-ion. The triflate group is an exceptionally good leaving group.\n3.  **Step 2: Formation of the Thionium Ion:** The highly reactive sulfoxonium intermediate rapidly eliminates the triflate group and a proton from the adjacent methyl group. This forms a key intermediate called a thionium ion (or sulfenium ion): [Ph-S=CH₂]⁺. This species is highly electrophilic at the methylene carbon (the CH₂).\n4.  **Step 3: Nucleophilic Attack:** Trimethylsilyl cyanide (TMSCN) serves as a source for the cyanide nucleophile (CN⁻). The cyanide ion attacks the electrophilic carbon of the thionium ion.\n5.  **Step 4: Determine Final Product and IUPAC Name:** The attack of cyanide on the [Ph-S=CH₂]⁺ ion results in the formation of a new carbon-sulfur and carbon-carbon bond, yielding the product C₆H₅-S-CH₂-CN. We will then determine the systematic IUPAC name for this structure. The principal functional group is the nitrile (-CN). The parent chain including this group is acetonitrile (-CH₂CN). The substituent attached to this chain is a phenylsulfanyl group (C₆H₅S-).\n\nThe code below will print the final IUPAC name of the product.\n\n```python\ndef get_iupac_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines and prints the IUPAC name of the reaction product.\n    \n    Reactants:\n    1.
