    "Of course. Here is the plan to answer your question.\nFirst, I will identify the specific section of the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam that deals with the names of the Prophets. The poem dedicates a few verses (abyat) to listing the 25 prophets whose names are obligatory for a Muslim to know. I will pinpoint the exact starting and ending verse numbers for this list.\n\nThen, I will write a simple Python script to state this range clearly. The script will store the start and end verse numbers in variables and then print a sentence that directly answers your question, including these numbers.\n\n```python\ndef find_prophets_verses():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the range of verses (bayt) in\n    'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' where the names of the prophets are mentioned.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The first verse that starts listing the names of the prophets.\n    start_bayt = 28\n\n    # The last verse that lists the names of the prophets.\n    end_bayt = 31\n\n    print(\"The names of the Prophets in the poem 'Aqeedat al-'Awaam' are mentioned from bayt:\")\n    print(start_bayt)\n    print(\"to bayt:\")\n    print(end_bayt)\n\nfind_prophets_verses()\n```\n<<<bayt 28 to bayt 31>>>"
