    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the song and generate the code:\n\n1.  **Analyze the musical question**: The core of the request is to find a Beatles song that begins with a specific and somewhat unusual chord progression: moving from the tonic chord (the \"home\" chord of the key) to a minor fifth chord.\n2.  **Translate to music theory**:\n    *   In a major key, the chord on the fifth scale degree is normally major (the Dominant or V chord). A minor fifth (v chord) would be a \"borrowed\" chord, creating a distinctive, often somber sound.\n    *   In a minor key, the chord on the fifth scale degree is naturally minor (the minor dominant or v chord). This progression (i -> v) is quite common and establishes a minor key feel right away.\n3.  **Identify the song**: The song that most famously and clearly begins this way is \"Things We Said Today\". The verse starts in the key of A minor. It opens with a stark, strummed A minor chord (the tonic, `i`), which immediately jumps to an E minor chord (the minor fifth, `v`).\n4.  **Construct the Python script**: I will create a Python script that:\n    *   Stores the song title and the musical analysis (key, chords) in variables.\n    *   Prints a clear, descriptive answer.\n    *   Fulfills the unusual instruction to \"output each number in the final equation\" by presenting the chord progression as a musical \"equation,\" printing each component (the Roman numerals `i` and `v`) separately.\n\n```python\ndef solve_beatles_song_query():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the Beatles song based on a specific\n    opening chord progression and explains the music theory behind it.\n    \"\"\"\n    song_title = \"Things We Said Today\"\n    key = \"A minor\"\n    \n    # Define the components of the chord progression \"equation\"\n    tonic_chord = {\n        \"roman_numeral\": \"i\",\n        \"chord_name\": \"A minor\"\n    }\n    \n    minor_fifth_chord = {\n        \"roman_numeral\": \"v\",\n        \"chord_name\": \"E minor\"\n    }\n\n    print(f\"The song by The Beatles that starts with a chord jump from the tonic to the minor fifth is '{song_title}'.\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe song's opening is in the key of {key}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe musical 'equation' for this opening progression is:\")\n\n    # Printing each component of the 'equation' as requested.\n    print(f\"Term 1 (Tonic Chord): {tonic_chord['roman_numeral']} which is {tonic_chord['chord_name']}\")\n    print(f\"Term 2 (Minor Fifth Chord): {minor_fifth_chord['roman_numeral']} which is {minor_fifth_chord['chord_name']}\")\n\nsolve_beatles_song_query()\n```\n<<<Things We Said Today>>>"
