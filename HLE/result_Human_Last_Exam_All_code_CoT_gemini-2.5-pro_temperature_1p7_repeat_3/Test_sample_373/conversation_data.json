    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the graph and the process of gossiping.\n\n1.  **Barbell Graph Structure**: A standard barbell graph with 10 nodes is formed by connecting two complete graphs (cliques) of 5 nodes each (`K₅`) with a single edge. This connecting edge is known as the \"bottleneck edge\".\n2.  **Node Degrees**: Let's identify the two nodes connected by the bottleneck edge as `u` and `v`.\n    *   Any node within a `K₅` that is *not* part of the bottleneck connection is connected to the other 4 nodes in its own clique. Its degree is 4.\n    *   Node `u` is connected to 4 other nodes in its clique and also to node `v`. Therefore, its degree is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n    *   By symmetry, node `v` also has a degree of `5`.\n3.  **Randomized Uniform Gossiping**: This process involves two steps:\n    *   A node is selected uniformly at random from all `n=10` nodes.\n    *   The selected node then chooses one of its neighbors, also uniformly at random, to communicate with. The edge connecting them is the one that is \"sampled\".\n4.  **Calculating the Probability**: The bottleneck edge `(u, v)` is sampled if one of two mutually exclusive events occurs:\n    *   **Event A**: Node `u` is selected, and it chooses `v` as its neighbor.\n    *   **Event B**: Node `v` is selected, and it chooses `u` as its neighbor.\n\nThe total probability is the sum of the probabilities of Event A and Event B.\n\n*   `P(Event A) = P(selecting u) * P(u chooses v | u is selected) = (1/10) * (1/degree(u)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n*   `P(Event B) = P(selecting v) * P(v chooses u | v is selected) = (1/10) * (1/degree(v)) = (1/10) * (1/5) = 1/50`\n*   `P(sampling bottleneck) = P(Event A) + P(Event B) = 1/50 + 1/50 = 2/50 = 1/25`\n\nThe following Python code implements this logic to calculate the final probability and displays the full equation.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_barbell_gossip_probability():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability of sampling the bottleneck edge in a\n    barbell graph with 10 nodes during randomized uniform gossiping.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Total number of nodes in the barbell graph\n    total_nodes = 10\n\n    # The barbell graph consists of two K_5 cliques.\n    # So the size of each clique is 5.\n    clique_size = 5\n\n    # The nodes connected by the bottleneck edge are u and v.\n    # The degree of such a node is the number of other nodes in its clique (clique_size - 1)\n    # plus the connection to the other bottleneck node (+1).\n    degree_bottleneck_node = (clique_size - 1) + 1\n\n    # Probability of picking a specific node (e.g., u or v)\n    # is 1 / total_nodes.\n    prob_pick_node = 1 / total_nodes\n\n    # Given a bottleneck node is picked, the probability of it choosing its\n    # partner across the bridge is 1 / its degree.\n    prob_pick_neighbor = 1 / degree_bottleneck_node\n\n    # The total probability is the sum of two scenarios:\n    # 1. Node u is picked and chooses v.\n    # 2. Node v is picked and chooses u.\n    # P(total) = P(pick u) * P(u chooses v) + P(pick v) * P(v chooses u)\n    total_probability = (prob_pick_node * prob_pick_neighbor) + (prob_pick_node * prob_pick_neighbor)\n\n    # Print the equation with all the numbers, as requested.\n    # Redirecting output to stdout for the final answer\n    original_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__\n    \n    print(f\"The probability of sampling the bottleneck edge is the sum of two scenarios:\")\n    print(f\"1.
