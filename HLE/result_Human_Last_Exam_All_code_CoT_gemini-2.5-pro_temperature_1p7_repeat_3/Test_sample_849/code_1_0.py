def define_safe_goal():
  """
  Defines and prints the safe goal for the AI model M.

  The problem states that the set of successful predictors, I, is uncomputable.
  This means the model cannot a priori prove or guarantee predictive success.
  Therefore, a goal based on achieving predictive success is not 'safe'.

  A safe goal must be based on what the model can know and compute.
  The model has access to the set of all possible predictors it can generate.

  The goal, therefore, shifts from achieving an uncertain outcome to learning
  a safe mode of behavior based on the known set of internal processes. This
  is a form of corrigibility, where the agent learns to be cautious and
  controllable in the face of its own uncertainty.

  The two parts of the goal are:
  1. {_______ learning}: The type of learning is 'Corrigible learning'.
  2. from {_______}: The source of this learning is the 'available predictors'.
