# This script calculates the number of virtual table loads for the given C++ snippet.

# Number of vtable loads for the first virtual function call: a->foo()
# At this point, the compiler knows the dynamic type of the object pointed to by 'a' is exactly 'A',
# as it was just created. A "perfectly optimizing" compiler will perform devirtualization,
# converting the virtual call into a direct static call to A::foo().
# This optimization avoids any virtual table lookup.
loads_call_1 = 0

# Number of vtable loads for the second virtual function call: a->foo()
# The call to escape(a) informs the compiler that any assumptions about the object
# pointed to by 'a' are now invalid. The object's type might have been changed.
# Therefore, the compiler cannot devirtualize this call and must generate code
# for a true virtual dispatch, which involves one load of the virtual table pointer.
loads_call_2 = 1

# Number of vtable loads for the third virtual function call: b->foo()
# The pointer 'b' is initialized with the result of a placement new expression: new(a) B.
# The compiler sees that an object of type 'B' has just been constructed at this location.
# It therefore knows the exact dynamic type of the object pointed to by 'b'.
# This allows the compiler to devirtualize the call to a direct call to B::foo().
loads_call_3 = 0

# Calculate the total number of vtable loads
total_loads = loads_call_1 + loads_call_2 + loads_call_3

# Print the breakdown of the calculation and the final result.
