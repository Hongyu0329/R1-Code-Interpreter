In any standard encryption scheme, confidentiality is a function of the plaintext (P), the algorithm (E), and the key (K), resulting in ciphertext (C). Decryption is the reverse. If an adversary knows C, the algorithm, and K, they can trivially compute P. Therefore, the premise describes a system that is, by definition, broken.\n")
