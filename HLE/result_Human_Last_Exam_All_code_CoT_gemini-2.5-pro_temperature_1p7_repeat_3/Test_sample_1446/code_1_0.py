    Determines the critical exponent ν for a G₄-theoretical framework.

    The G₄-theoretical framework is interpreted as the standard φ⁴ theory of critical phenomena.
    The critical exponents in this theory depend on the spatial dimension, d.

    A key concept is the upper critical dimension, d_c, which for φ⁴ theory is 4.
    For any dimension d >= d_c, the system is described by mean-field theory.

    In mean-field theory, the correlation length exponent ν takes a precise value.
