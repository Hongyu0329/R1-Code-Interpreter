    **Disclaimer:** The following is an educational outline based on the provided clinical data. It is not medical advice. The management of this patient requires a multidisciplinary team including a physician, dentist, and potentially a surgeon.

    **--- PATIENT SUMMARY ---**
    - **Demographics:** Female from sub-Saharan Africa.
    - **Systemic Condition:** Obese, living with diabetes mellitus, with a high glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of 7.5% (uncontrolled).
    - **Traumatic Injury:** Avulsion (loss) of left maxillary lateral incisor, canine, and first premolar.
    - **Delayed Treatment:** Presented to the hospital 28 hours post-accident.
    - **Skeletal Finding:** SNB angle of 88 degrees, indicating mandibular prognathism (Class III skeletal relationship).

    **--- STAGE 1: IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT & STABILIZATION ---**
    1.  **Medical Consultation:** Urgent referral to a physician to manage the hyperglycemia. An HbA1c of 7.5% significantly increases the risk of post-procedural infection and impairs wound healing. Elective dental procedures should be deferred until glycemic control is achieved (ideally HbA1c < 7%).
    2.  **Acute Dental Care:**
        *   Thorough debridement of the sockets and irrigation with saline or an antimicrobial solution to reduce the bacterial load from the 28-hour delay.
        *   Radiographic evaluation (Periapical X-rays and/or CBCT) to assess the extent of alveolar bone damage and rule out root fractures in adjacent teeth.
        *   Suturing of any soft tissue lacerations.
        *   Administration of systemic antibiotics is indicated due to the contaminated nature of the wound and the patient's compromised immune status from diabetes.
    3.  **Pain Management:** Prescription of appropriate analgesics.

    **--- STAGE 2: PROSTHETIC REHABILITATION (DENTURE PLAN) ---**
    Once systemic health is stabilized and the soft/hard tissues have healed (typically 8-12 weeks), definitive prosthetic treatment can be planned. Given the clinical factors, a removable partial denture (RPD) is a viable and conservative first option.

    *   **Type of Denture:** A **cast metal framework removable partial denture (RPD)**. This is preferred over a flexible acrylic denture due to its superior rigidity, hygiene, and support, which is critical for a long-span edentulous area and a Class III bite.
    *   **Material:** A **Cobalt-Chromium (Co-Cr) alloy** for the framework, with high-impact acrylic for the saddle areas and acrylic or composite denture teeth for aesthetics.
    *   **Abutment Teeth and Reasons:**
        1.  **Primary Abutments:**
            *   **Left Central Incisor:** This is the tooth immediately mesial to the edentulous space. It will require a rest seat and a clasp for retention and support. Its periodontal health is critical.
            *   **Left Second Premolar:** This is the tooth immediately distal to the edentulous space. It is a key abutment for providing posterior support and preventing the denture from lifting.
        2.  **Secondary Abutments (for cross-arch stabilization):**
            *   **Right Canine and First Premolar:** Incorporating clasps on the contralateral (right) side is crucial. This creates cross-arch stabilization, preventing the denture from rotating and distributing occlusal forces more evenly, which is especially important in a patient with a prognathic mandible (SNB 88⁰).

    **--- CELLS OF INTEREST ---**
    The healing process involves a complex cascade of cellular activity, which is compromised by the patient's diabetes.
    *   **Inflammatory/Immune Cells:** **Neutrophils** and **Macrophages** are critical for clearing bacteria and debris. In uncontrolled diabetes, their function (chemotaxis, phagocytosis) is impaired, increasing infection risk.
    *   **Repair and Regeneration Cells:**
        *   **Platelets:** Initiate clotting.
        *   **Fibroblasts:** Synthesize collagen for new soft tissue. Their function is negatively impacted by Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs) in diabetics.
        *   **Osteoblasts:** Form new bone to heal the sockets. High blood glucose is toxic to osteoblasts.
        *   **Osteoclasts:** Remodel the bone. Dysregulation in diabetes can lead to excessive bone loss.
