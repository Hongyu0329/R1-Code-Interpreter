    "My approach is to find a cell-wise transformation rule that is consistent across all the provided examples. The value of an output cell at `(r, c)` will depend on the value of the input cell at `(r, c)` and the values of its 8 neighbors (Moore neighborhood).\n\n1.  **Hypothesize a rule based on neighborhood properties:** I'll assume the transformation rule is a form of cellular automaton, where the next state of a cell depends on its current state and the number of its neighbors. A common approach for this is to look at the sum of the values in the 3x3 area around the cell, including the cell itself.\n\n2.  **Deduce the rule from examples:** I will analyze the input/output pairs to deduce the specific rule. For a cell `I(r, c)` and the sum of its 3x3 neighborhood `S3`, I want to find the function `f(I(r, c), S3)` that produces the output `O(r, c)`.\n\n    -   From Example 1, cell (0,0): Input is 0. The 3x3 sum (with zero-padding) is 2. The output is 1. So, `f(0, 2) -> 1`.\n    -   From Example 1, cell (2,2): Input is 1. The 3x3 sum is 2. The output is 0. So, `f(1, 2) -> 0`.\n    -   From Example 1, cell (1,1): Input is 0. The 3x3 sum is 3. The output is 1. So, `f(0, 3) -> 1`.\n    -   From Example 3, cell (2,2): Input is 1. The 3x3 sum is 3. The output is 1. So, `f(1, 3) -> 1`.\n    -   From Example 4, cell (1,2): Input is 0. The 3x3 sum is 4. The output is 0. So, `f(0, 4) -> 0`.\n    -   From Example 1, cell (1,3): Input is 1. The 3x3 sum is 4. The output is 1. So, `f(1, 4) -> 1`.\n\n3.  **Formulate the final rule:** By gathering and verifying these mappings across all examples, the rule emerges:\n    -   If a cell's value is 0 (dead), it becomes 1 (alive) if the sum of its 3x3 neighborhood is 2 or 3.\n    -   If a cell's value is 1 (alive), it stays 1 (alive) if the sum of its 3x3 neighborhood is 3 or 4.\n    -   In all other cases, the output cell's value is 0.\n    This corresponds to the \"HighLife\" variant of Conway's Game of Life (B23/S23).\n\n4.  **Apply the rule to the test grid:** I will write a Python script to apply this discovered rule to the sixth test grid. The script will:\n    -   Represent the input grid as a 2D list.\n    -   Pad the grid with a border of zeros to simplify the neighbor summation process at the edges.\n    -   Iterate through each cell, calculate the 3x3 sum, apply the B23/S23 rule, and generate the output grid.\n    -   Finally, it will print the resulting grid.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_grid(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Applies the HighLife (B23/S23) cellular automaton rule to a grid.\n    - A dead cell (0) becomes alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbors (3x3 sum is 2 or 3).\n    - An alive cell (1) survives if it has 2 or 3 neighbors (3x3 sum is 3 or 4).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pad the grid with zeros to handle boundaries\n    padded_grid = np.pad(grid, pad_width=1, mode='constant', constant_values=0)\n    output_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n    \n    for r in range(grid.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(grid.shape[1]):\n            # Sum the 3x3 neighborhood in the padded grid\n            # The coordinates in the padded grid are (r+1, c+1)\n            neighborhood_sum = np.sum(padded_grid[r:r+3, c:c+3])\n            \n            current_val = grid[r, c]\n            \n            # Apply the B23/S23 rule\n            if current_val == 0:  # If cell is dead\n                if neighborhood_sum == 2 or neighborhood_sum == 3:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n            else:  # If cell is alive\n                if neighborhood_sum == 3 or neighborhood_sum == 4:\n                    output_grid[r, c] = 1\n                    \n    return output_grid\n\ndef main():\n    # Test Input Grid 6\n    input_grid = np.array([\n        [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n        [1, 0, 0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    output_grid = solve_grid(input_grid)\n    \n    # Print the output grid\n    for row in output_grid:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, row)))\n\nmain()\n\n```"
