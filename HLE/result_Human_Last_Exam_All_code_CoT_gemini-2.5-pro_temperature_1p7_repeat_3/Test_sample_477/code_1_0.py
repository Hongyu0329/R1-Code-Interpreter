print("### Analyzing the Role of LIG1 in CTG Somatic Instability ###")
print("\n--- Step 1: Understand the context ---")
print("Myotonic Dystrophy (DM1) is caused by an expansion of a CTG repeat sequence in the DMPK gene.")
print("This repeat is unstable in somatic cells, meaning it tends to get longer over time, which is called 'somatic instability'. This contributes to the disease's progression.")

print("\n--- Step 2: Understand the function of LIG1 ---")
print("LIG1 is DNA Ligase I, an essential enzyme whose job is to seal nicks or gaps in the DNA backbone.")
print("This is a critical final step in DNA replication, particularly in joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.")

print("\n--- Step 3: Connect LIG1 to CTG repeat instability ---")
print("Replicating a long, repetitive CTG sequence is challenging. The sequence can fold back on itself to form 'hairpin' structures.")
print("These hairpins can stall the replication machinery, leading to the formation of unsealed nicks in the new DNA strand.")
print("Normally, LIG1 efficiently seals these nicks, stabilizing the DNA.")

print("\n--- Step 4: Predict the impact of LIG1 knockout ---")
print("If LIG1 is knocked out or its function is depleted, these nicks are not sealed promptly.")
print("The persistence of these nicks allows the DNA strands more time to slip and misalign relative to each other.")
print("This slippage and misalignment, when eventually 'fixed' by other repair pathways, often results in the insertion of additional CTG repeats.")

print("\n--- Step 5: Conclusion from experimental data ---")
print("Scientific studies have confirmed this model. When LIG1 is depleted in human cell lines, the frequency of CTG repeat expansions significantly increases.")
print("Therefore, the absence of LIG1 leads to increased somatic instability.")
print("\nFinal Conclusion: Knocking out LIG1 results in INCREASED INSTABILITY.")
