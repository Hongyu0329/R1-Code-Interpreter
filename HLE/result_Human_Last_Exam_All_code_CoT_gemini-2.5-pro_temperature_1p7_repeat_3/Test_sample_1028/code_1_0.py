The core problem is that for a phylogeny containing only extant species, different combinations of time-varying speciation (lambda(t)) and extinction (mu(t)) rates can produce the exact same likelihood. This is the 'non-identifiability' issue. We need to assess which strategy does NOT help deal with this.

Let's analyze the options:

A. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 constant pieces:
This simplifies the rate functions but does not resolve the non-identifiability within each piece. It's a simplification, but the fundamental problem remains.

B. Incorporating prior information in a Bayesian framework:
Priors add external information to the model, which can constrain the parameters and help distinguish between otherwise equally likely scenarios. This HELPS mitigate the issue.

C. Fitting a birth-death model with 10 pieces defined by polynomials of degree 5:
This strategy dramatically increases the complexity and flexibility of the model. Increasing the number of parameters for a model that is already non-identifiable will only make the problem worse, not better. It expands the set of possible solutions that fit the data equally well. This does NOT help.

D. Incorporating fossils tips and sampled ancestors in the phylogeny:
Fossils provide direct information about past diversity and, crucially, about extinction events. This additional data helps to separately estimate speciation and extinction rates. This HELPS mitigate the issue.

E. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled diversification rate:
The pulled diversification rate is a parameter combination that has been shown to be identifiable from extant-only phylogenies. By changing the goal of inference to an identifiable parameter, this strategy directly addresses the problem. This HELPS mitigate the issue.

F. Incorporating fossils tips in the phylogeny:
Similar to D, adding fossil data of any kind provides information about extinction that helps resolve the non-identifiability. This HELPS mitigate the issue.

G. Reparametrizing the model to infer the pulled speciation rate:
Similar to E, the pulled speciation rate is another identifiable parameter combination. Focusing on it is a valid strategy. This HELPS mitigate the issue.

Conclusion:
Strategies B, D, E, F, and G all represent valid methods to address the non-identifiability problem by either adding information or focusing on identifiable parameters. Strategy A is a simplification that doesn't solve the problem but doesn't necessarily make it worse. Strategy C, however, makes the problem worse by introducing much more flexibility and unidentifiable parameters. Therefore, it is the strategy that does not help.
