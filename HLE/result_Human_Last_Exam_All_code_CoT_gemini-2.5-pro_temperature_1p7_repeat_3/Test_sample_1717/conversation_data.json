    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step thinking process to determine the answer, followed by the Python code to explain and calculate the result.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** Find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu.\n2.  **Apply Expert Mode Modifier:** Calculate the boss's health for a single player in Expert Mode.\n3.  **Incorporate Multiplayer Scaling:** Understand the formula used to increase boss health for each additional player in Expert Mode.\n4.  **Analyze the \"Infinite Players\" Condition:** Examine the health formula as the number of players approaches infinity. Mathematically, the health would also approach infinity.\n5.  **Consider Technical Limitations:** Investigate the underlying data type used to store NPC health in Terraria's source code. This reveals the true technical cap imposed by the game engine itself.\n6.  **State the Final Answer:** The maximum value of this data type is the theoretical maximum health.\n7.  **Generate Python Code:** Write a Python script that clearly lays out each step of this calculation, defines the variables, shows the formula, and prints the final result.\n\nHere is the Python script to demonstrate the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_terraria_health_cap():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health for the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Step 1: Define the base parameters from the game's code.\n    base_health = 2800\n    expert_mode_multiplier = 2.0\n    multiplayer_health_increase_per_player = 0.35 # This is a 35% increase per player after the first one.\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the base health in Expert Mode.\n    expert_base_health = base_health * expert_mode_multiplier\n    \n    # Step 3: Explain the formula and the process.\n    print(\"To find the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu, we follow these steps:\")\n    print(\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(f\"1. The base health of the Eye of Cthulhu is {base_health}.\")\n    print(f\"2. In Expert Mode, its health is multiplied by {expert_mode_multiplier}.\")\n    print(f\"   The resulting single-player Expert Mode health is: {base_health} * {expert_mode_multiplier} = {int(expert_base_health)}\")\n    print(\"\\n3. In multiplayer, health increases for each player after the first.\")\n    print(\"   The formula is: Total Health = Expert_Base_Health * (1 + Scaling_Factor * (Number_Of_Players - 1))\")\n    print(f\"   Substituting the values: Total Health = {int(expert_base_health)} * (1 + {multiplayer_health_increase_per_player} * (P - 1)), where P is the number of players.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the limit and technical constraints.\n    print(\"\\n4. With an infinite number of players (as P -> infinity), the health calculated by the formula also approaches infinity.\")\n    print(\"   However, games have technical limitations based on their code.\")\n    print(\"\\n5. In Terraria's source code, an NPC's health is stored in a 32-bit signed integer.\")\n    \n    # The maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer.\n    max_int_32_value = 2147483647\n    \n    print(f\"   A 32-bit signed integer has a maximum possible value of {max_int_32_value}.\")\n    print(\"   Therefore, the game engine cannot store a health value higher than this, regardless of the formula's output.\")\n    \n    # Final Conclusion\n    print(\"\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\")\n    print(\"The theoretical maximum health is not infinite, but capped by this data type limit.\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The theoretical maximum health is {max_int_32_value}.\")\n\n\nsolve_terraria_health_cap()\n```\n<<<2147483647>>>"
