    print("1. The premise mentions ECDSA in the context of 'existentially forgeable' schemes.")
    print("   - This is likely referring to ECDSA's signature malleability: given a signature (r, s), the signature (r, -s) is also valid for the same message.")
    print("   - This malleability means ECDSA is not *strongly* existentially unforgeable, as a new signature can be forged for a previously signed message.")

    print("\n2. Analyzing the options:")
    print("   A. Can an adversary create a new sig' for the same m with only negligible probability?")
    print("      - False. Due to malleability, an adversary can do this with probability 1.")
    
    print("\n   B. Can an adversary recover the secret key sk with only negligible probability?")
    print("      - True. This is the core security assumption of ECDSA, based on the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Malleability does not break this.")
    
    print("\n   C. For *some* existentially forgeable schemes, can an adversary create a signature for a given m?")
    print("      - True. This is a general statement asserting that universally forgeable schemes exist. A scheme vulnerable to universal forgery is also existentially forgeable. We can easily define such an insecure scheme, so the statement is true.")
    
    print("\n   D. For *all* existentially forgeable schemes, is it hard to figure out the message m from the signature?")
    print("      - False. Message recovery is not a guaranteed property of signature schemes. In most schemes like ECDSA, the message is a public input required for verification.")

    print("\nConclusion:")
    print("Statements B and C are both true.")
    print("Since more than one option is true, the correct answer is E.")
