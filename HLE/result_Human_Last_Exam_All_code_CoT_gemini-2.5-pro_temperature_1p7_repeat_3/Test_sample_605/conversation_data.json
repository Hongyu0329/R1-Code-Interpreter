    "Of course, I can help you with that. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Formula:** The Crawley-Nordström invariant for a Calabi-Yau hypersurface defined by a quasi-homogeneous polynomial $f$ in a weighted projective space is given by the formula:\n    $$CN(f) = \\frac{d - \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i}{\\prod_{i=1}^n w_i}$$\n    where $d$ is the degree of the polynomial and $w_i$ are the weights.\n\n2.  **Determine the Degree (d):** A polynomial is quasi-homogeneous if all its monomials have the same weighted degree. I will calculate the weighted degree for a representative monomial from the polynomial using the provided weights $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4, w_5) = (22, 29, 49, 50, 75)$. For example, for the monomial $z_5^3$, the degree is $3 \\times w_5 = 3 \\times 75 = 225$. I will use this as the degree $d$.\n\n3.  **Verify the Calabi-Yau Condition:** The term \"Calabi-Yau\" implies that the degree $d$ equals the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$. I will verify this condition, which is crucial for the calculation.\n    *   $\\sum w_i = 22 + 29 + 49 + 50 + 75 = 225$.\n    *   Since $d=225$, the Calabi-Yau condition $d = \\sum w_i$ is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Invariant:** I will substitute the values of $d$, $\\sum w_i$, and the product $\\prod w_i$ into the formula. Since $d = \\sum w_i$, the numerator becomes 0, which simplifies the final result.\n\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print the result in a clear, step-by-step format, including the final equation with all the numerical values plugged in.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_crawley_nordstrom():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Crawley-Nordström invariant for the given Calabi-Yau Link.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The weights of the ambient space\n    weights = [22, 29, 49, 50, 75]\n\n    # The polynomial is f = z_1^8*z_3 + ... + z_5^3.\n    # For a polynomial to be quasi-homogeneous, all its monomials must have the same weighted degree.\n    # Let's calculate the degree 'd' using the last monomial, z_5^3:\n    # d = 3 * w_5 = 3 * 75 = 225.\n    d = 225\n\n    # The \"Calabi-Yau\" condition requires that the degree 'd' equals the sum of the weights.\n    # Let's calculate the sum of the weights.\n    sum_of_weights = sum(weights)\n\n    # Let's calculate the product of the weights.\n    product_of_weights = math.prod(weights)\n\n    # The formula for the Crawley-Nordström invariant is CN = (d - sum(w_i)) / prod(w_i).\n    # Since the Calabi-Yau condition (d = sum(w_i)) is met, the numerator will be 0.\n    numerator = d - sum_of_weights\n    \n    # Calculate the invariant.\n    if product_of_weights == 0:\n        invariant = float('inf') if numerator != 0 else 0 # Avoid division by zero\n    else:\n        invariant = numerator / product_of_weights\n\n    # Print the step-by-step calculation\n    print(\"Step 1: Define the degree and weights.\")\n    print(f\"Weights (w_i): {weights}\")\n    print(f\"Degree (d): {d}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Check the Calabi-Yau condition (d = sum(w_i)).\")\n    print(f\"Sum of weights = {' + '.join(map(str, weights))} = {sum_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"Since d ({d}) = sum(w_i) ({sum_of_weights}), the Calabi-Yau condition is satisfied.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the Crawley-Nordström invariant using the formula.\")\n    print(\"CN = (d - sum(w_i)) / prod(w_i)\")\n    print(f\"Product of weights = {' * '.join(map(str, weights))} = {product_of_weights}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nFinal Equation:\")\n    print(f\"CN = ({d} - {sum_of_weights}) / {product_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"CN = {numerator} / {product_of_weights}\")\n    print(f\"CN = {invariant}\")\n\nsolve_crawley_nordstrom()\n<<<0.0>>>\n```"
