# Step 1: Deconstruct the riddle to find the key information.
# The riddle is not historical but a reference to modern literature from the "1960s".
# The novel in question is Joseph Heller's "Catch-22".

# Step 2: Identify the key numbers needed for our logical "equation".
# The novel's title provides a key number.
key_novel_number = 22
# The novel's publication year falls within the "1960s" timeframe mentioned in the riddle.
publication_year = 1961

# Step 3: Identify the word "X" as found in the novel.
# In "Catch-22", a central mystery revolves around a note with a shameful admission.
shameful_word = "illiterate"

# Step 4: Display the logical "equation" and its components to derive the answer.
# This satisfies the requirement to output each number in the final equation.
