    "The problem asks for the dimension of the Lie group of symmetries of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3 spatial dimensions. This dimension is a well-established result in mathematical physics.\n\nMy plan to solve this is to identify all the continuous symmetry transformations that leave the equations invariant. The total dimension of the Lie group is the sum of the number of independent parameters for each of these transformations. I will write a Python script that enumerates each type of symmetry, specifies its contribution to the dimension, and then calculates the total sum, displaying the full equation as requested.\n\nThe fundamental symmetries are:\n1.  **Time translation:** Shifting the time origin.\n2.  **Space translations:** Shifting the spatial origin.\n3.  **Space rotations:** Rotating the coordinate system.\n4.  **Galilean boosts:** Shifting to a uniformly moving reference frame.\n5.  **Scaling:** A specific scaling of time, space, velocity, and pressure.\n6.  **Pressure shift:** Shifting the pressure by a constant value.\n\nThe Python code below will calculate the dimension contributed by each of these and sum them up.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_navier_stokes_symmetry_dimension():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and explains the dimension of the Lie group of\n    symmetries for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.\n\n    The dimension of the group is the total number of independent parameters\n    required to specify a transformation in the group.
