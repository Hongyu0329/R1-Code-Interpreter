    "This is a geographical riddle. I will break down the clues to find the answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the clues:**\n    *   It's an island town.\n    *   It's extremely remote, being more than 500 kilometers from another inhabited island.\n    *   It is located on a bay.\n    *   The bay is formed by a volcanic caldera.\n    *   The town, the bay, and the caldera share the same name.\n\n2.  **Evaluate potential candidates based on remoteness:** The most remote inhabited islands in the world include Easter Island (Rapa Nui), the Pitcairn Islands, and Tristan da Cunha.\n\n3.  **Check candidates against the other clues:**\n    *   **Tristan da Cunha:** The main settlement is Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. This doesn't match the island's name or any major geographical feature like a bay or caldera.\n    *   **Pitcairn Island:** The main settlement is Adamstown, located near Bounty Bay. The names do not match.\n    *   **Easter Island (Rapa Nui):** The main town is **Hanga Roa**. It is situated on **Hanga Roa Bay**. The town and the bay share a name. Easter Island is a volcanic island famous for its calderas (like Rano Kau) and is one of the most remote inhabited places on Earth, over 2,000 km from the Pitcairn Islands.\n\n4.  **Synthesize and conclude:** Hanga Roa fits almost all the criteria perfectly: it's a very remote island town on a bay that shares its name. While the bay itself is not a perfect caldera, the town is situated on a volcanic island defined by its massive calderas, and this appears to be the intended answer to the riddle.\n\n```python\n# The riddle describes a very specific location. Based on the clues:\n# 1. Remoteness (>500 km from another inhabited island)\n# 2. Volcanic island town\n# 3. Town and bay share a name\n\n# The location that best fits these clues is Hanga Roa on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).\n# - Easter Island is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the world.\n# - It is a volcanic island.\n# - The main town, Hanga Roa, is situated on Hanga Roa Bay.\n\nriddle_answer = \"Hanga Roa\"\nprint(riddle_answer)\n```\n<<<Hanga Roa>>>"
