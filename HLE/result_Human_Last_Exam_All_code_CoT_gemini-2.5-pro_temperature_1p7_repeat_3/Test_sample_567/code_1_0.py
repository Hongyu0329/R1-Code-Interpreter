# The problem asks for the value of 'a' where the volume constraint becomes the
# sole obstruction for the symplectic embedding of the ellipsoid E(1,a) into a 4D ball.
# From the work of McDuff and Schlenk, this value is known to be the fourth
# power of the golden ratio, phi.

# The mathematical formula for this value 'a' is derived from phi:
# a = phi^4 = ((1 + sqrt(5))/2)^4 = (7 + 3*sqrt(5))/2

# We define the numbers from the final simplified equation.
numerator_const = 7
numerator_coeff = 3
sqrt_base = 5
denominator = 2

# Perform the calculation
sqrt_val = math.sqrt(sqrt_base)
a_value = (numerator_const + numerator_coeff * sqrt_val) / denominator

# Print the final equation with its components, and the resulting value.
