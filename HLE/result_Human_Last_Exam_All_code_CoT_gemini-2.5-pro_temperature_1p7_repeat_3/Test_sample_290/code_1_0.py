    # Step 1: Analyze the problem and establish an upper bound for n.
    # Let S be the set of n points on a circle C with center O.
    # Let T be the union of S and {O}.
    # We have a set of L of 9 straight lines.
    # The condition is that for any two points A, B in T, they are connected by a path of at most 2 lines.

    # Each of the n points lies on the circle C.
    # A single straight line can intersect a circle at most at 2 points.
    num_lines = 9
    max_points_per_line = 2

    # Therefore, the total number of points n cannot exceed the total number of
    # possible intersections from all 9 lines.
    # n <= num_lines * max_points_per_line
    max_n = num_lines * max_points_per_line

    # Step 2: Show that this upper bound is achievable with a valid configuration.
    # We need to construct an arrangement of 9 lines that generates n=18 points on the
    # circle and satisfies the connectivity requirement for the set T = {O, P_1, ..., P_18}.

    # **Proposed Configuration:**
    # Let one line, L1, pass through the center O of the circle.
    # This line is a diameter and intersects the circle at 2 points, say P1 and P2.

    # Let the remaining 8 lines (L2, ..., L9) all pass through a single point X,
    # chosen such that X is not the center O and X is outside the circle.
    # These 8 lines can be chosen as secants, each intersecting the circle at 2 distinct points.
    # With a careful choice of X and the slopes of the lines, these 8 lines can generate
    # 8 * 2 = 16 new points (P3, ..., P18), all distinct from each other and from P1, P2.
    # Total points n = 2 (from L1) + 16 (from L2-L9) = 18.

    # **Verification of Connectivity:**
    # 1. Any point P on the circle to the center O:
    #    - If P is on L1 (P1 or P2), it's connected to O by 1 line.
    #    - If P is on one of the other 8 lines (Lk), Lk does not contain O but L1 does.
    #      Since Lk and L1 are not parallel, they must intersect.
    #      So, P is connected to O by a path of 2 lines.
    #
    # 2. Any two points P_i, P_j on the circle:
    #    - If both are on L1, they are connected by 1 line.
    #    - If both are on lines passing through X, their lines intersect at X. Connected by 2 lines.
    #    - If one is on L1 and the other on a line through X, the lines intersect. Connected by 2 lines.

    # The configuration is valid and achieves n=18.
    # Thus, the maximum value of n is 18.

    # Final calculation

    print(f"Maximum points on the circle per line = {max_points_per_line}")
    print(f"The maximum theoretical value for n is the product of these two numbers.")
    print(f"Final equation: {num_lines} * {max_points_per_line} = {max_n}")
