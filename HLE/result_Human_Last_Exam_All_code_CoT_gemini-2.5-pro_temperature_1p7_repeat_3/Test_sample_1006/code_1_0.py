    Solves the problem by identifying the topological space from its properties.

    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact
    topological space X with two given properties:
    1. X contains a dense copy of the long ray R = [0, \omega_1).
    2. Every bounded continuous function f: R -> R extends to a unique continuous
       function on X.

    Our reasoning is as follows:
    """

    # Step 1: Analyze the properties.
    # Property (1) implies that X is a compactification of the long ray R.
    # The long ray R is a Tychonoff space, which is a prerequisite for the
    # existence of the Stone-Čech compactification.

    # Step 2: Recognize the universal property.
    # Property (2) is the universal mapping property that uniquely defines the
    # Stone-Čech compactification, denoted as βR.
    # The Stone-Čech compactification βY of a Tychonoff space Y is characterized
    # by being the unique compact Hausdorff space such that every bounded
    # continuous function from Y to the real numbers extends uniquely to βY.
    # The properties given for X are precisely the definition of X being a
    # Stone-Čech compactification of R.

    # Step 3: Use the uniqueness of the Stone-Čech compactification.
    # A fundamental theorem in topology states that the Stone-Čech compactification
    # of a Tychonoff space is unique up to a homeomorphism that fixes points
    # of the original space.
    # This means that any space X satisfying the given properties must be
    # homeomorphic to βR.

    # Step 4: Count the homeomorphism classes.
    # If we have two such spaces, X1 and X2, they are both homeomorphic to βR.
    # By transitivity of homeomorphism, X1 is homeomorphic to X2.
    # Therefore, all such spaces fall into a single homeomorphism class.

    number_of_classes = 1

    print("Based on the properties, the space X must be homeomorphic to the Stone-Čech compactification of the long ray R.")
    print("This construction is unique up to homeomorphism.")
    print("\nTherefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.")
    print(f"Final equation: number_of_distinct_homeomorphism_classes = {number_of_classes}")
