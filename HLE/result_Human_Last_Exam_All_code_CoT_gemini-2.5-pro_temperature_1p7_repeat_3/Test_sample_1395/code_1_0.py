# Step 1: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph before 1991.
# A political map is a planar graph. By the Four Color Theorem, its chromatic number is at most 4.
# The graph of Asian countries before 1991 was sufficiently complex to require 4 colors.
chromatic_number_before = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph before the Soviet dissolution was {chromatic_number_before}.")

# Step 2: Determine the chromatic number of the Asian country graph after 1991.
# After the dissolution, the graph became more complex but remained planar.
# The Four Color Theorem still applies, so the chromatic number did not increase. It remained 4.
chromatic_number_after = 4
print(f"The chromatic number of the Asian subgraph after the Soviet dissolution is {chromatic_number_after}.")

# Step 3: Calculate delta_soviet, the incremental change in the chromatic number.
delta_soviet = chromatic_number_after - chromatic_number_before
print(f"The incremental change, delta_soviet, is {chromatic_number_after} - {chromatic_number_before} = {delta_soviet}.")

# Step 4: Determine beta based on the change in planarity.
# A graph of contiguous countries is planar. This property did not change after the new states were formed.
# Since planarity did not change, beta is 1.
beta = 1
print(f"The graph remained planar, so beta is {beta}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final result.
final_answer = beta * delta_soviet
print(f"The final result is beta * delta_soviet = {beta} * {delta_soviet} = {final_answer}.")

# Final Answer
print(f"<<<{final_answer}>>>")
