    Solves the geology consensus/debated quiz.
    
    The classification for each statement is as follows:
    (1) Consensus (C): The Morrison Formation is a classic retroarc foreland basin deposit.
    (2) Debated (D): The slab window model for metamorphic core complexes is one of several competing hypotheses.
    (3) Consensus (C): The existence of a high-elevation "Nevadaplano" plateau is a well-supported, dominant model.
    (4) Debated (D): The existence and primary cause (magmatic thickening) of an "Arizonaplano" is not settled.
    (5) Consensus (C): The spatial relationship of Laramide structures being inboard of Sevier structures is a fundamental observation.
    (6) Consensus (C): The Sierra Nevada and Idaho batholiths are universally accepted as the roots of the Cordilleran magmatic arc.
    (7) Consensus (C): The southwestward migration of Eocene-present volcanism (the Yellowstone hotspot track) is well-established.
    (8) Debated (D): The uplift history of the Colorado Plateau is a classic and major point of contention.
    (9) Debated (D): The timing of the uplift of the Cascade Range to modern elevations is not agreed upon, with much evidence pointing to younger uplift.
    (10) Debated (D): While a popular model, the subduction of the Shatsky conjugate as the cause for Laramide deformation is a specific hypothesis within the broader, debated topic.
