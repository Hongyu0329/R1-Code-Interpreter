# This problem requires calculating a ratio of evidence (E_r) to distinguish a true
# fairness violation from a statistical artifact caused by the graph's structure.
#
# The model is as follows:
# 1. The "mass" of the local evidence for the violation is the product of its confidence and support (c * s).
# 2. The credibility of this local evidence is adjusted by the bottleneck coefficient (beta).
#    A low beta (strong bottleneck) reduces the credibility of local findings, as they might be isolated artifacts.
# 3. This adjusted evidence is then compared against the counter-evidence from the neighborhood (c_prime).
#
# The formula is: E_r = (c * s * beta) / c_prime

# Calculate the numerator (structurally adjusted local evidence)
numerator = c * s * beta

# Calculate the final evidence ratio
E_r = numerator / c_prime

# Print the calculation steps for clarity
