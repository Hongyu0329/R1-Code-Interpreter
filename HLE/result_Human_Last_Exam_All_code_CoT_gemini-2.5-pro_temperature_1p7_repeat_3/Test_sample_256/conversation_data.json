    "This problem requires finding the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles within a larger circle. This is a well-known problem in geometry, and the solutions for various numbers of circles have been determined through extensive computational research.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Consult a reliable database of circle packing configurations to find the best-known packing for N=1135 circles. A leading resource for this is the \"Packomania\" website maintained by Eckard Specht.\n2.  Identify the symmetry group of this specific packing from the database.\n3.  Provide the answer in the requested Schoenflies notation.\n4.  Write a Python script to print this information. According to the best-known results, the packing for 1135 circles is asymmetric. In Schoenflies notation, this corresponds to the C1 group.\n\n```python\ndef find_circle_packing_symmetry():\n  \"\"\"\n  Provides the symmetry group for the optimal packing of 1135 congruent circles in a circle.\n\n  This problem is a known difficult problem in computational geometry.

Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
