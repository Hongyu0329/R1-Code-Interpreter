# The user wants me to select an answer choice based on a document reranking task.
# Let's represent the final choice as a variable.

# Analysis for Question 1:
# Query: "What animal's coat color changed as a baby?"
# Doc 1 states the change happened "at a few months old".
# Doc 2 states the change happened "As they reached puberty".
# "A few months old" is a much better match for "baby" than "puberty".
# Decision for Question 1: Document 1 is more relevant.
q1_rank = 1

# Analysis for Question 2:
# Query: "What animal's coat color did not change as a baby?"
# Both Doc 1 and Doc 2 state: "Cows retained the reddish-brown colour."
# The information is identical in both documents, so they are equally relevant.
# Tie-breaking: Since we must choose, and Doc 1 demonstrated slightly higher specificity/quality
# in its other facts, we can prefer it as the overall better document.
# Decision for Question 2: Document 1 is chosen.
q2_rank = 1

# The combined ranking is "1-1", which corresponds to option A.
final_answer = "A"

# The prompt requires me to show the final equation, but this is a multiple choice question.
# I will print the components of my decision.
