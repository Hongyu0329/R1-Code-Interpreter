    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Translate the Problem:** A category with one object is equivalent to a mathematical structure called a **monoid**. A monoid is a set with an associative binary operation and an identity element.\n    *   **Object:** There is one object, let's call it `X`.\n    *   **Morphisms:** The morphisms are arrows from `X` to `X`. We are given there are 3 such morphisms. Let's call the set of morphisms `M`.\n    *   **Identity:** One of these 3 morphisms must be the identity morphism, `id_X`. Let's name the other two `f` and `g`. So, `M = {id, f, g}`.\n    *   **Composition:** We need to define a composition rule `∘` for these morphisms.\n2.  **Establish Constraints:**\n    *   **Identity Law:** For any morphism `h` in `M`, `h ∘ id = h` and `id ∘ h = h`. This pre-determines part of the composition table.\n    *   **Closure:** The composition of any two morphisms in `M` must result in a morphism that is also in `M`.\n    *   **Associativity:** For any three morphisms `a, b, c` in `M`, the composition must be associative: `(a ∘ b) ∘ c = a ∘ (b ∘ c)`.\n3.  **Systematic Search Strategy:**\n    *   The composition `∘` can be represented by a 3x3 multiplication table.\n    *   The row and column for `id` are fixed. We only need to determine the compositions for the non-identity elements:\n        *   `f ∘ f = ?`\n        *   `f ∘ g = ?`\n        *   `g ∘ f = ?`\n        *   `g ∘ g = ?`\n    *   Each of these 4 compositions can result in `id`, `f`, or `g`. This gives `3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 3^4 = 81` possible composition tables.\n    *   I will write a Python script to iterate through all 81 possibilities.\n4.  **Filter and Count:**\n    *   For each of the 81 tables, the script will check if the associativity law holds.\n    *   The tables that satisfy associativity are valid monoids of order 3.\n    *   Finally, we need to count these monoids \"up to isomorphism\". Two monoids are isomorphic if one can be transformed into the other by simply renaming the non-identity elements (`f` and `g`). So, if we have a monoid defined by a table, we can generate its isomorphic counterpart by swapping `f` and `g` everywhere in the table. We will count pairs of such inter-changeable tables as one.\n    *   The script will find all unique monoids after accounting for this isomorphism, which gives the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef solve_category_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of non-isomorphic categories with one object and three morphisms.\n    This is equivalent to finding the number of non-isomorphic monoids of order 3.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Let the morphisms be 0 (identity), 1 (f), and 2 (g)\n    elements = [0, 1, 2]\n\n    # We need to define the 2x2 sub-table for composing non-identity elements {f, g}.\n    # The compositions f*f, f*g, g*f, g*g can each be 0, 1, or 2.\n    # This gives 3^4 = 81 possibilities.\n    num_total_tables = 3**4\n    possible_compositions = list(itertools.product(elements, repeat=4))\n\n    valid_monoids = []\n    # 1.
