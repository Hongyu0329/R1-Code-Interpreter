    This function determines the valid translation practices for the specific linguistic
    challenge presented in the two mystery stories.

    The analysis identified three viable solutions:
    I. Transcreation: Creating a new, analogous pun in the target language.
    II. Embedded audio links: Allowing the reader to hear the original English pun.
    VI. Footnotes with phonetics: Explaining the original English pun.

    The final answer is the Roman numerals of these solutions, sorted in ascending
    order and separated by hyphens.
