# Define symbolic representations for the variables in the problem.
# k_k,inf represents the 'maximum norm'. Based on the context of finding an
# upper bound for all lattices of a certain type, this is interpreted as the
# length of the shortest non-zero vector in the lattice, measured using the
# infinity norm (max(|coordinate_1|, |coordinate_2|, ...)).
# V represents the covolume of the lattice.
var_k = "k_k,inf"

# The mathematical relationship is an inequality derived from Minkowski's
# theorem on convex bodies. For any 2D lattice, this inequality holds.
# The relationship is: k_k,inf <= V^(1/2).

# The numbers that define this relationship in the final equation are
# the implicit coefficient (1) and the exponent (1/2).
