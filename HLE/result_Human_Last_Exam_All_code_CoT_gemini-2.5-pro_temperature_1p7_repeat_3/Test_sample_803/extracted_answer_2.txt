They are the generalized dihedral groups `Dih(P)`, where `P` is an abelian group of order `q^m` for an odd prime `q` and natural number `m`, and the action of the complementing element of order 2 on `P` is inversion (`p` -> `p⁻¹`). The only exception is the symmetric group on 3 letters, `S_3`, which arises when `P` is the cyclic group of order 3.
