# 1. Define the properties of the two metric spaces.
# Space X: The interval [0, 1] with the standard absolute value metric.
# The diameter of X is the maximum distance between its endpoints.
diam_x = 1.0

# Space Y: The unit circle with the intrinsic metric (shortest arc length).
# A unit circle has radius 1. Its circumference is 2 * pi.
# The diameter of Y is the distance between antipodal points, which is
# half the circumference.

distance = abs(diam_x - diam_y) / 2
