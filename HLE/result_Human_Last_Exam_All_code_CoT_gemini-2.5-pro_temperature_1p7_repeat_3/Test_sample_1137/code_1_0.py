    # The problem asks to identify the best litigation forum for RE1.
    # The key factors are:
    # 1. It's a complex commercial dispute (joint venture, contracts, financials).
    # 2. The properties and companies are in Ontario, so it's an Ontario provincial matter.
    # 3. The most important criterion for RE1 is speed ("shortest amount of time").

    # We will evaluate each option based on these factors using a scoring system.
    # Criteria for scoring:
    # - has_jurisdiction: Can the court hear the case at all? (Prerequisite)
    # - handles_complexity_score: How well-suited is it for complex cases? (Scale 0-5)
    # - is_expedited_score: Does it offer a faster-than-normal process? (Scale 0-5)
