def solve_closepact_sets():
    """
    Solves the topological problem by identifying which sets are necessarily compact.

    The definition of "closepact in itself" for a Hausdorff space (which all these examples are)
    is equivalent to the standard definition of compactness.
    For a subset of the real or complex numbers, a set is compact if and only if it is
    closed and bounded.

    Let's analyze each option:
    A. R: Not bounded -> Not compact.
    B. Z: Not bounded -> Not compact.
    C. Finite subset of C: Closed and bounded -> Compact.
    D. {1/n | n in Z, n!=0}: Not closed (limit point 0 is missing) -> Not compact.
    E. A Cauchy sequence in Q: Not necessarily compact (e.g., sequence for sqrt(2) is not closed in Q if the limit is irrational).
    F. Bounded monotonic sequence in R: Not necessarily closed (limit point may be missing) -> Not compact.
    G. Bounded monotonic sequence + limit in R: Closed and bounded -> Compact.
    H. Convergent sequence + limit in R: A convergent sequence is bounded. Set is closed and bounded -> Compact.
    I. Open interval (a,b): Not closed -> Not compact.
    J. Closed interval [a,b]: Closed and bounded -> Compact.
    K. Bounded measurable subset of R: Not necessarily closed (e.g., (0,1)) -> Not compact.
    L. Bounded non-measurable subset of R: Not necessarily closed -> Not compact.
    M. The Cantor Set: Closed and bounded -> Compact.

    The letters corresponding to the compact sets are C, G, H, J, M.
