    "My plan is to solve this problem by applying principles from graph theory.\n\n1.  **Analyze the question**: The goal is to find the maximum possible chromatic number for any graph $G$ that has $n=12345$ vertices and is not a complete graph. The chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex coloring.\n\n2.  **Establish an upper bound**: The maximum possible chromatic number for any graph with $n$ vertices is $n$, which is achieved by the complete graph $K_n$. However, the problem states that our graph $G$ is not a complete graph. If a graph is not complete, it must have at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices. These two vertices can be assigned the same color. This implies that the chromatic number must be less than $n$. So, for any non-complete graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, we must have $\\chi(G) \\le n-1$.\n\n3.  **Show the bound is achievable**: To confirm that $n-1$ is the maximum possible value, I need to demonstrate that there exists at least one non-complete graph on $n$ vertices that requires exactly $n-1$ colors. A perfect example is the graph formed by taking the complete graph $K_n$ and removing a single edge. This graph is no longer complete. However, it still contains a clique of size $n-1$ (a $K_{n-1}$ subgraph), which by itself requires $n-1$ colors. Therefore, the chromatic number of this graph is exactly $n-1$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion and calculation**: Since the chromatic number is at most $n-1$ and we found a case where it is exactly $n-1$, the maximum number of colors required is $n-1$. I will write a Python script to perform this simple calculation and present the reasoning and the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_coloring_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the maximum number of colors needed for a proper vertex\n    coloring of a graph with 12345 vertices that is not a complete graph.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Number of vertices in the graph G\n    n = 12345\n\n    # Explain the reasoning behind the solution.\n    print(\"This problem asks for the maximum number of colors needed to properly color a graph G with 12345 vertices, given that G is not a complete graph.\")\n    print(\"Let's break down the logic:\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: The absolute maximum chromatic number\")\n    print(f\"For any graph with n = {n} vertices, the maximum possible number of colors for a proper coloring is n.\")\n    print(\"This maximum is only achieved if the graph is a complete graph (K_n), where every vertex is connected to every other vertex.\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: The constraint of the graph not being complete\")\n    print(\"The problem states that G is not a complete graph.
