    "The user wants to identify the major product of an organic chemistry reaction. I will devise a plan to determine the product and then write a Python script that explains the reasoning and prints the final answer.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify the Reaction Type:** The substrate is a secondary alkyl halide `(1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane`. The reagent is potassium tert-butoxide, a strong, bulky base. These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction.\n2.  **Analyze Stereochemistry:** The E2 reaction on a cyclohexane ring has a strict stereochemical requirement. The leaving group (Bromine) and a hydrogen atom on an adjacent carbon (a Î²-hydrogen) must be in an *anti-periplanar* conformation. In a cyclohexane chair, this means both groups must be in axial positions, oriented in opposite directions (one up, one down).\n3.  **Evaluate Chair Conformations:** I will analyze the two possible chair conformations of the starting material:\n    *   One conformation will have the substituents in equatorial positions, which is generally more stable. I will check if this conformer can undergo the E2 reaction.\n    *   The other conformation will have the substituents in axial positions. This is less stable but may be the only one that meets the E2 reaction's stereochemical requirement.\n4.  **Determine the Elimination Site:** Based on the reactive conformation (the one with an axial bromine), I will identify which adjacent carbon (C2 or C6) has an axial hydrogen available for removal by the base.\n5.  **Name the Product:** Elimination of the axial bromine and the identified axial hydrogen will form a double bond. I will name the resulting alkene product.\n6.  **Construct Python Script:** I will create a Python script that walks through these logical steps, explaining the chemical principles involved and printing the final product name, including any numbers as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_reaction_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes the E2 elimination of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane\n    with potassium tert-butoxide and identifies the major product.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Introduction to the chemical problem\n    print(\"Analyzing the reaction of (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane with potassium tert-butoxide.\")\n    print(\"This is an E2 elimination reaction, which has strict stereochemical requirements.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the E2 requirement in cyclohexanes\n    print(\"Step 1: The Anti-Periplanar Requirement\")\n    print(\"For an E2 elimination on a cyclohexane ring, the leaving group (Br) and a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon must be 'anti-periplanar'.\")\n    print(\"This means they must both be in axial positions, one pointing up and one down.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 2: Analyze the reactant's conformations\n    print(\"Step 2: Conformations of the Reactant\")\n    print(\"The starting material, (1S,2R)-1-bromo-2-methylcyclohexane, exists as two main chair conformations:\")\n    print(\"  a) A more stable conformer where both the Bromo group and the methyl group are in equatorial positions.\")\n    print(\"     - In this conformation, the Bromine is not axial, so the E2 reaction cannot occur.\")\n    print(\"  b) A less stable conformer where both the Bromo group and the methyl group are in axial positions.\")\n    print(\"     - The E2 reaction MUST proceed through this less stable conformer because only here is the Bromine group axial.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Step 3: Identify the removable proton in the reactive conformation\n    print(\"Step 3: Identifying the Removable Hydrogen\")\n    print(\"In the reactive conformation (where Br and methyl are axial):\")\n    print(\"  - The Bromine is on Carbon 1 (axial).\")\n    print(\"  - We must check the adjacent carbons (C2 and C6) for an axial hydrogen.\")\n    print(\"\\n  - At Carbon 2: The methyl group is axial.
