    "Here is my plan to solve this chess problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the FEN**: I will start by parsing the provided FEN string (`4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20`) to understand the board state. The `w` indicates it's White's turn to move.\n2.  **Identify Immediate Threats**: I'll check for any immediate checks or critical threats. It's apparent that White's King is in check from Black's Rook on e1. This drastically limits White's possible moves.\n3.  **Determine the Forced Sequence**: Since White's first move is forced (to get out of check), I will determine the only legal move.\n4.  **Find the Optimal Line**: Assuming both sides play optimally, I will then trace the sequence of best moves for both White and Black. The goal is to find the shortest path for White to deliver checkmate. This involves a series of forcing moves (checks and captures) to leave the opponent with no good responses.\n5.  **Count the Moves**: I will count the number of moves White makes in this sequence to achieve checkmate. This count will be the final answer.\n6.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that programmatically prints out this step-by-step analysis and the final move sequence, fulfilling the user's request for a code-based solution. The script will clearly show the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the given chess FEN and prints the shortest mating sequence for White.\n    \"\"\"\n    fen = \"4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20\"\n    \n    print(f\"Analyzing the chess position from FEN: {fen}\")\n    print(\"It is White's turn, but the King on g1 is in check from Black's Rook on e1.\")\n    print(\"This means White's first move is forced.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- The Winning Mating Sequence ---\")\n\n    # The sequence of moves is represented as a list of tuples.\n    # Each tuple contains the move number, the move itself, and the explanation.\n    moves = [\n        (\"1.\", \"Rxf1\", \"White's only legal move is to capture the checking rook on e1.\"),\n        (\"1...\", \"Qe7\", \"Black must defend against the immediate mate threat on f7 (Qxf7#).
