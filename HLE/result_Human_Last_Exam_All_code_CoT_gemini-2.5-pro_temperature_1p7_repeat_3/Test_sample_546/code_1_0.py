# The problem statement is a mathematical puzzle that simplifies significantly.
# The given expression for f(p) is of the form 2^E mod M.
# Through number theory principles like the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Fermat's Little Theorem,
# and properties of the given primes, the entire expression simplifies.
# The complex dependency on the variable 'p' cancels out, and the value of f(p)
# becomes a constant, independent of 'p'.
# The final simplified equation is f(p) = 2^81.

# Define the base and exponent of the final simplified equation.
base = 2
exponent = 81

# Calculate the result of 2^81.
result = base ** exponent

# Print the final equation and its value.
print(f"The calculation simplifies to the equation: f(p) = {base}^{exponent}")
print(f"The final calculated value is: {result}")
