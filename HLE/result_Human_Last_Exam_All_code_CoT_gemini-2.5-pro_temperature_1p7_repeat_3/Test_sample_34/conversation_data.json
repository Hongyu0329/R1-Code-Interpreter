    "This is a poker theory question that can be solved with a logical breakdown. Here's the plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Scenario:** We are on the button (the best position), 100 big blinds deep, in a rake-free game. This scenario calls for the widest possible opening range because we are guaranteed to be in position post-flop, and there's no rake penalty to overcome.\n2.  **Define \"Worst\" Suited Jack:** We need to find the suited Jack hand (JXs) that has the lowest expected value (EV) while still being a profitable open-raise. The value of these hands comes from three main factors:\n    *   **High Card Value:** All hands have a Jack.\n    *   **Flush Potential:** All hands are suited, giving them identical flush potential.\n    *   **Straight Potential & Kicker Value:** This is the key differentiator. The lower the second card, the worse its value as a kicker and the lower its \"connectivity\" (ability to make straights).\n3.  **Compare the Hands:**\n    *   Hands like JTs, J9s, and J8s are strong because they are connected or have small gaps, making straights more likely.\n    *   As we move down to J7s, J6s, J5s, etc., the straight potential decreases significantly.\n    *   **J2s** is the least valuable hand in the JXs category. The '2' provides no meaningful help in making straights with the Jack and is the lowest possible kicker. While it is still considered a standard open-raise from the button in this game format, it is the one with the least profitability compared to all other suited Jacks.\n\nThe Python code below will define the suited Jack hands and programmatically identify and print the worst one based on this logic.\n\n```python\ndef find_worst_suited_jack():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the worst suited jack to open from the button in a standard 100BB game.\n\n    In poker, the value of a suited hand is determined by its high card value,\n    flush potential, and straight potential (connectivity). For suited Jacks (JXs),\n    the Jack and the flush potential are constant. The value therefore decreases\n    as the rank of the second card ('kicker') goes down, because both the kicker\n    value and the hand's ability to make a straight are reduced.\n\n    J2s has the lowest kicker and the worst connectivity, making it the weakest,\n    or \"worst,\" suited Jack that is still a standard open-raise from the button.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # List of possible kickers for a suited Jack, in order from best to worst\n    # (excluding Ace, King, Queen, which are premium hands).\n    # Ten down to Two.\n    kickers = ['T', '9', '8', '7', '6', '5', '4', '3', '2']\n\n    # The worst kicker is the last one in the list.\n    worst_kicker = kickers[-1]\n\n    # The worst suited jack to open is J with the worst kicker.\n    worst_hand = f\"J{worst_kicker}s\"\n\n    print(f\"The suited Jack hands (JXs) are valued based on their second card.\")\n    print(f\"A lower second card means lower kicker value and worse straight potential.\")\n    print(f\"The hand with the lowest value that is still a standard open from the button is J2s.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the worst suited jack you should open from the button is: {worst_hand}\")\n\nfind_worst_suited_jack()\n```\n<<<J2s>>>"
