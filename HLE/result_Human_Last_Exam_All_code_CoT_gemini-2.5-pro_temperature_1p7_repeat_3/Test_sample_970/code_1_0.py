    Analyzes the assumptions required for the expected information gain of a Bayesian agent to converge to zero.

    The problem asks for the necessary assumptions to prove that the expected information gain,
    E[KL(posterior_t+1 || posterior_t)], approaches zero with probability 1.

    1.  (a) The prior has finite entropy. This is a necessary condition. The total expected information
        gain is bounded by the entropy of the prior distribution. If the sum of a series of
        non-negative terms (the expected information gains at each step) is bounded, then the
        terms themselves must converge to zero. This guarantees convergence in expectation.

    2.  (b) The agent interacts with a regular MDP (finite or compact state space). This is
        also necessary. This assumption ensures that the environment is "learnable" and prevents
        pathological cases where an agent's trajectory yields uninformative data, even though
        different models would behave differently elsewhere. It is required to strengthen the proof
        from convergence in expectation to convergence with probability 1 (almost surely).

    3.  (c) The existence of a limiting state occupancy distribution is a condition on the agent's
        policy. It's a sufficient, but not a necessary condition. Learning can occur even with a
        non-stationary policy.

    4.  (d) i.i.d. observations is an assumption that does not hold in the general setting of an
        agent interacting with an MDP.

    5.  (e) The posterior entropy approaching zero is a result or consequence of learning, not a
        prerequisite assumption. Proving information gain goes to zero is part of the proof that
        posterior entropy goes to zero.

    Therefore, the necessary assumptions from the list are (a) and (b).
    The logical expression is `a AND b`.

    In Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), this is represented as a conjunction of clauses.
    Clause 1: (a)
    Clause 2: (b)
    The clauses and literals are already alphabetically sorted.
    The final CNF expression is [(a) AND (b)].
