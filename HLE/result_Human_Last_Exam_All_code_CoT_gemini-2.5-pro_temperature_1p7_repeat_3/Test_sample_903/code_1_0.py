    # Step 1: Analyze the ligand to find its denticity and donor atoms.
    # The ligand is 1,3-Di[3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-ylmethyl]-2,4,6-triethylbenzene.
    # It has two identical arms attached to a benzene backbone.
    # Each arm is a '3-(2’-pyridyl)pyrazol-1-yl' group.
    # In each arm, there are two nitrogen atoms with available lone pairs for coordination:
    #  - The nitrogen in the pyridine ring.
    #  - The nitrogen at position 2 of the pyrazole ring.
    # Since there are two such arms ('Di-'), the ligand is tetradentate (four donor sites).
    # All four donor atoms are nitrogens.
    num_nitrogen_donors = 4

    # Step 2: Analyze the metal salt.
    # The salt is ZnBr2.
    # The central metal is Zinc (Zn).
    # It provides two bromide (Br) ions, which can also act as ligands.
    num_bromide_donors = 2

    # Step 3 & 4: Predict the final complex.
    # The reaction is 1:1, combining one 4-donor N-ligand with one ZnBr2 unit.
    # Zn(II) commonly forms 6-coordinate complexes, especially with bulky multidentate ligands.
    # The most stable and common structure would be a neutral complex where all potential ligands coordinate.
    # The 4 nitrogen atoms from the organic ligand and the 2 bromide ions from the salt
    # will all bond to the central Zn(II) ion.
    # This forms a 6-coordinate complex with the formula [Zn(ligand)Br2].
    coordination_number = num_nitrogen_donors + num_bromide_donors # 4 + 2 = 6

    # Step 5: List the atoms coordinated to the Zinc center.
    # Based on the 6-coordinate complex, the coordinated atoms are the 4 Nitrogens and 2 Bromines.
