    # Introduction and Step 1 Explanation
    explanation_step1 = """
Here is the step-by-step analysis of the reaction sequence:

Step 1: Elimination Reaction to form Product A

- Starting Material: [(3S)-3-bromobutyl]benzene, a secondary alkyl halide with a defined stereocenter.
- Reagents: Potassium tert-butoxide (t-BuOK) in a non-polar solvent. t-BuOK is a strong, sterically hindered base.
- Reaction Analysis: These conditions strongly favor an E2 (bimolecular elimination) reaction over an SN2 reaction. Because t-BuOK is a bulky base, it preferentially removes a proton from the least sterically hindered β-carbon. In this case, the protons on the terminal methyl group (C4) are more accessible than the protons on the internal methylene group (C2). This is known as Hofmann elimination.
- Product A: The elimination results in the formation of the less substituted alkene, 4-phenylbut-1-ene. The original stereocenter at C3 is destroyed in this process as the carbon becomes sp2-hybridized.
"""

    # Step 2 Explanation
    explanation_step2 = """
Step 2: Hydroboration-Oxidation to form Product B

- Starting Material: Product A (4-phenylbut-1-ene).
- Reagents: 1. Borane in THF (BH3·THF), 2. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH).
- Reaction Analysis: This is a hydroboration-oxidation reaction. It adds the elements of water across the double bond with anti-Markovnikov regioselectivity. The hydroxyl (-OH) group is added to the less substituted carbon of the double bond (C1), and a hydrogen atom is added to the more substituted carbon (C2).
- Product B: The product of this reaction is the primary alcohol, 4-phenylbutan-1-ol. No new stereocenter is created.
"""

    # Step 3 and Final Product Explanation
    explanation_step3_and_final = """
Step 3: Bromination to form Final Product C

- Starting Material: Product B (4-phenylbutan-1-ol), a primary alcohol.
- Reagent: Phosphorus tribromide (PBr3).
- Reaction Analysis: PBr3 is a standard reagent used to convert primary and secondary alcohols into their corresponding alkyl bromides via an SN2-type mechanism.
- Product C: The hydroxyl group is replaced by a bromine atom, yielding the final product, 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane.
"""

    final_answer = """
Identity and Chirality of Final Product C

- IUPAC Name: 1-bromo-4-phenylbutane
- Chirality: The final product is achiral. The original chiral center was lost in the first elimination step. The subsequent reactions did not generate any new chiral centers. Therefore, the molecule does not have any stereoisomers.
