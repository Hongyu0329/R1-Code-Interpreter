    "There are 17 wallpaper groups, which are categorized by their point groups. The order of a group refers to the number of symmetry operations it contains. We are looking for wallpaper groups whose point groups have exactly two symmetry operations: the identity operation (doing nothing) and one other operation.\n\nIn the context of 2D crystallography, the point groups of order 2 are:\n1.  **Point Group '2' (or C2):** Contains the identity and a 180-degree rotation.\n2.  **Point Group 'm' (or D1):** Contains the identity and a single reflection.\n\nMy plan is to use a Python script to:\n1.  Store the 17 wallpaper groups and their corresponding point group notations in a dictionary.\n2.  Iterate through this data to count how many groups belong to point group '2' and how many belong to point group 'm'.\n3.  Print the counts for each category and then sum them to find the total number.\n\n```python\ndef count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of 2D wallpaper groups whose point group has an order of 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A mapping of the 17 wallpaper groups (full international notation) to their point groups.\n    wallpaper_group_data = {\n        'p1': '1',\n        'p2': '2',      # Point group of order 2\n        'pm': 'm',      # Point group of order 2\n        'pg': 'm',      # Point group of order 2\n        'cm': 'm',      # Point group of order 2\n        'p2mm': '2mm',\n        'p2mg': '2mm',\n        'p2gg': '2mm',\n        'c2mm': '2mm',\n        'p4': '4',\n        'p4mm': '4mm',\n        'p4gm': '4mm',\n        'p3': '3',\n        'p3m1': '3m',\n        'p31m': '3m',\n        'p6': '6',\n        'p6mm': '6m'\n    }\n\n    # Find groups with point group '2' or 'm'\n    groups_pg_2 = [name for name, pg in wallpaper_group_data.items() if pg == '2']\n    groups_pg_m = [name for name, pg in wallpaper_group_data.items() if pg == 'm']\n\n    count_pg_2 = len(groups_pg_2)\n    count_pg_m = len(groups_pg_m)\n    total_count = count_pg_2 + count_pg_m\n\n    print(\"The point groups of order 2 are '2' (180-degree rotation) and 'm' (reflection).\")\n    print(\"\\nCounting the wallpaper groups for each:\")\n    \n    print(f\"\\nNumber of groups with point group '2': {count_pg_2}\")\n    print(f\"  (Group: {', '.join(groups_pg_2)})\")\n    \n    print(f\"Number of groups with point group 'm': {count_pg_m}\")\n    print(f\"  (Groups: {', '.join(groups_pg_m)})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nFinal Calculation:\")\n    print(f\"Total number = {count_pg_2} (from point group '2') + {count_pg_m} (from point group 'm') = {total_count}\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    count_wallpaper_groups_by_point_group_order()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
