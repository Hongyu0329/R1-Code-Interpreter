    "The ideal Ni/Ce ratio in Ni-Ceria nanoparticles is not a single fixed value but rather an optimal range that depends on several factors, including the specific reaction (Water Gas Shift vs. Water Splitting), synthesis method, and operating conditions like temperature. The goal is to maximize the number of active sites at the Ni-ceria interface while preventing the nickel particles from clumping together (sintering) at high temperatures, which reduces performance.\n\nThe following Python script summarizes the key findings from scientific literature to identify the generally accepted optimal ratios for maximizing catalytic performance.\n\n```python\ndef find_ideal_ni_ce_ratio():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function analyzes and presents findings from scientific literature\n    on the ideal Ni content in Ni-Ceria (NiO-CeO2) catalysts for the\n    Water Gas Shift (WGS) and Water Splitting (WS) reactions.\n    The values are typically given as a weight percentage (wt%) of Ni.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Ideal Ni/Ce Ratio in Ni-Ceria Nanoparticles ---\\n\")\n\n    # --- Part 1: Water Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction ---\n    print(\"1.
