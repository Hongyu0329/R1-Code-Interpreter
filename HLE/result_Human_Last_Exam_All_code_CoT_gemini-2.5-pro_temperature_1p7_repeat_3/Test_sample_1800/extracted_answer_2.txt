The ideal Ni/Ce ratio is not a single value but a range depending on the specific application and synthesis method. For both the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction and water splitting, a Ni loading in the range of 10-15 wt% is frequently reported as optimal, providing a good balance between catalytic activity and stability.
