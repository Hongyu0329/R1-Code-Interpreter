# The problem asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points in an aposyndetic continuum.
# The solution is derived from mathematical reasoning based on the properties of topological spaces.

# Step 1: It is a theorem in continuum theory that for any point p in an aposyndetic continuum X,
# the subspace X \ {p} is continuum-connected.

# Step 2: By definition, a point p is a non-block point if X \ {p} contains a dense continuum-connected subset.
# From Step 1, the space X \ {p} is itself continuum-connected. A space is always dense in itself.
# Therefore, every point in an aposyndetic continuum is a non-block point.

# Step 3: The problem thus reduces to finding the minimum possible cardinality of an aposyndetic continuum.

# Step 4: A single-point space, X = {p}, is a continuum (compact, connected, Hausdorff).
# The condition for it to be aposyndetic ("for every two distinct points...") is vacuously true because there are no two distinct points.

# Step 5: Thus, a single-point space is an aposyndetic continuum, and its cardinality is 1.
# A continuum cannot be empty, so the cardinality cannot be 0.
# The smallest possible cardinality is therefore 1.

smallest_possible_cardinality = 1

# There is no equation to solve, so we just present the final derived number.
# Final Answer:
print(smallest_possible_cardinality)
