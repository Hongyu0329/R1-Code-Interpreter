    "To find the ratio of the uncertainty of the momentum of an electron to its momentum in the first Bohr orbit, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:** The relationship between the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp) is given by Δx * Δp ≥ ħ / 2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. For the minimum uncertainty, we use Δp = ħ / (2 * Δx).\n2.  **Momentum in the First Bohr Orbit:** The angular momentum (L) in a Bohr orbit is quantized: L = n * ħ. For the first orbit, n=1, so L = ħ. The classical angular momentum is also L = r * p, where r is the orbit's radius and p is the linear momentum. Equating these gives us p * r = ħ. For the first orbit (with radius r₁), the momentum (p₁) is p₁ = ħ / r₁.\n3.  **Calculate the Ratio:** We need to find the ratio Δp / p₁.\n    *   Ratio = (ħ / (2 * Δx)) / (ħ / r₁)\n    *   The reduced Planck constant (ħ) cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n    *   Ratio = r₁ / (2 * Δx)\n4.  **Substitute Values and Calculate:**\n    *   The Bohr radius (r₁) is approximately 5.29177 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n    *   The given uncertainty in position (Δx) is 10 pm = 10 x 10⁻¹² m = 1 x 10⁻¹¹ m.\n    *   Plugging these values into our simplified ratio formula gives the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation and print the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Constants and given values\n# r1 is the Bohr radius in meters\nr1 = 5.29177e-11\n# delta_x is the uncertainty in position in meters\ndelta_x = 10e-12\n\n# Calculate the ratio using the simplified formula: r1 / (2 * delta_x)\nratio = r1 / (2 * delta_x)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(\"The ratio of the uncertainty of momentum to the momentum is given by:\")\nprint(\"Ratio = (Bohr Radius) / (2 * Uncertainty in Position)\")\nprint(f\"Ratio = {r1} / (2 * {delta_x})\")\nprint(f\"The calculated ratio is: {ratio}\")\n\n```\n<<<2.645885>>>"
