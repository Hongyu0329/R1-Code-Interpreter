    # The patient's history and the location of the rash strongly suggest allergic contact dermatitis
    # due to new workout clothing. The rash involves the periphery of the axillary vault,
    # which is characteristic of textile dermatitis, as opposed to the vault itself, which would suggest
    # deodorant dermatitis.

    # We need to determine the best diagnostic test among the choices.
    # A. Skin biopsy is invasive and not the first choice for suspected contact dermatitis.
    # B. KOH preparation is for diagnosing fungal infections, which is less likely here.
    # C. Topical steroid is a treatment, not a diagnostic step.
    # D. Patch testing is the gold standard for identifying the specific allergen in allergic contact dermatitis.

    # Conclusion: The patch test is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis.
    
    explanation = "The patient's clinical presentation, particularly the distribution of the rash on the posterior axillary folds while sparing the vaults, is highly suggestive of textile allergic contact dermatitis from his new workout clothes. The best next step to confirm this diagnosis and identify the specific causative allergen is a patch test. This is the standard diagnostic procedure for allergic contact dermatitis. The case description itself confirms that this was the correct diagnostic path taken."
