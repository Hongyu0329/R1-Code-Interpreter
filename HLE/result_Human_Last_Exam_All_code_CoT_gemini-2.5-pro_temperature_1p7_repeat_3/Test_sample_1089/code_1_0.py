Step 1: Understand the Repair Method
The specified repair method is manual TIG (GTAW) welding for "build-up of layers of filler material". This means the primary goal is to add material to a location where it has been lost, in order to restore the part's original shape and dimensions.

Step 2: Evaluate the Damage Types
- Creep Deformation (D) is a distortion of the entire blade's shape and internal crystal structure due to heat and stress. It cannot be fixed by adding material locally.
- Other damages like Cracking (A, E) or Corrosion (F) can be repaired using welding, but the repair often involves first removing the defect (e.g., grinding out a crack) and then filling the void.
- Foreign Object Damage (BOD) creates nicks and gouges, which are localized material losses and are commonly repaired by weld build-up.
- Blade Tip Rub and Wear (C) is the specific loss of material at the tip of the blade. This is a very common and routine issue in engine operation. Restoring the blade tip's length is critical for maintaining engine performance and efficiency.

Step 3: Determine the 'Main' Application
The process of TIG welding to build up material is perfectly suited for replacing the material lost at the blade tip. This is one of the most common, routine, and characteristic repair procedures performed on high-pressure turbine blades. While FOD is also repaired this way, tip wear restoration is a quintessential example of build-up repair in aeroengine MRO.

Conclusion: The main source of damage addressed by this specific repair technique is Blade Tip Rub and Wear.
