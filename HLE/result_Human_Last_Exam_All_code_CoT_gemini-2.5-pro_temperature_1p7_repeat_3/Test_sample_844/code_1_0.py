    Analyzes the provided statements about aphid metabolism to find the incorrect one.

    The logic is as follows:
    1.  Information given:
        - CA aphid thrives on a raffinose-rich diet. This implies it's good at metabolizing raffinose (an RFO).
        - MA aphid thrives on a sucrose-only diet. This implies it's bad at metabolizing raffinose.

    2.  Evaluating the options:
        - A. CA metabolizes RFOs better than MA. (True, based on diet performance).
        - B. CA prefers raffinose, MA prefers sucrose. (True, based on diet performance).
        - C. When CA moves to cotton (low raffinose), its galactosidase activity decreases due to lack of substrate. (Plausible and likely True).
        - D. When CA moves to cotton (high sucrose/glucose), its galactosidase activity decreases due to catabolite repression. (Also plausible and likely True).
        - E. When MA moves to watermelon (high raffinose), its galactosidase activity increases. (Unlikely. MA is adapted for sucrose *only*, meaning it's not equipped to suddenly ramp up raffinose metabolism. This contradicts its stated specialization).

    3.  Conclusion: Statement E makes a claim that contradicts the established nature of the MA biotype. An organism specialized for one food source typically does not adaptively increase its metabolism for another food source it is not suited for.

    print("Based on the analysis, the statement that is not true is E.")
    print("The MA biotype is adapted to sucrose only and is unlikely to be able to increase its galactosidase activity effectively when moved to a raffinose-rich environment.")
