    "To compute the simplicial volume of the product of two surfaces, $\\Sigma_{31} \\times \\Sigma_{17}$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of each surface.** For a closed, oriented surface $\\Sigma_g$ of genus $g \\ge 1$, the simplicial volume is given by the formula $||\\Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4$.\n2.  **Calculate the simplicial volume of the product space.** The simplicial volume of a product of two manifolds $M$ and $N$ is given by Gromov's product formula: $||M \\times N|| = \\binom{\\dim M + \\dim N}{\\dim M} ||M|| ||N||$, provided the product of their individual simplicial volumes is non-zero.\n3.  **Combine the results.** I will substitute the calculated values into the product formula to find the final answer. The dimensions of the surfaces are both 2.\n\nThe Python script below will perform these calculations.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the genera of the two surfaces\ng1 = 31\ng2 = 17\n\n# Step 1: Compute the simplicial volume of each surface\n# The formula for the simplicial volume of a surface Sigma_g with g >= 1 is ||Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4.\nsv1 = 4 * g1 - 4\nsv2 = 4 * g2 - 4\n\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of a surface Sigma_g is given by ||Sigma_g|| = 4g - 4 (for g >= 1).\")\nprint(f\"For Sigma_{g1}, the simplicial volume is 4 * {g1} - 4 = {sv1}\")\nprint(f\"For Sigma_{g2}, the simplicial volume is 4 * {g2} - 4 = {sv2}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 2: Apply the product formula for simplicial volume\n# The formula is ||M x N|| = C(dim(M)+dim(N), dim(M)) * ||M|| * ||N||\n# Here, M = Sigma_31 and N = Sigma_17, both are 2-dimensional.\ndim_m = 2\ndim_n = 2\ntotal_dim = dim_m + dim_n\n\n# The binomial coefficient C(n, k)\ncoefficient = math.comb(total_dim, dim_m)\n\n# The total simplicial volume\ntotal_sv = coefficient * sv1 * sv2\n\nprint(f\"The product formula is ||Sigma_{g1} x Sigma_{g2}|| = C({total_dim}, {dim_m}) * ||Sigma_{g1}|| * ||Sigma_{g2}||\")\nprint(f\"The binomial coefficient C({total_dim}, {dim_m}) is {coefficient}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\n\n# Step 3: Print the final calculation and result\nprint(\"Final Calculation:\")\nprint(f\"||\\Sigma_{{{g1}}} x \\Sigma_{{{g2}}}|| = {coefficient} * {sv1} * {sv2} = {total_sv}\")\nprint(\"-\" * 20)\nprint(f\"The simplicial volume of Sigma_{g1} x Sigma_{g2} is {total_sv}.\")\n\n```\n<<<46080>>>"
