    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the step-by-step plan to determine the scaling exponent α.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Identify Key Parameters:** We start by defining the spatial dimension `d`, the upper critical dimension `d_c` for this class of problems (n-vector model), and the number of order parameter components `n`. For a general inquiry like this, the simplest and most common case is the Ising model, where `n=1`.\n2.  **Calculate Epsilon (ϵ):** The epsilon expansion works by calculating exponents as a power series in `ϵ = d_c - d`. We will calculate this value.\n3.  **Apply the Epsilon Expansion Formula:** The specific heat exponent `α` has a known formula to the first order in `ϵ`:\n    `α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n4.  **Substitute and Compute:** We will substitute the values of `n` and `ϵ` into this formula to calculate the numerical value of `α`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will perform these calculations and print out the explanation, the formula with substituted values, and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef calculate_alpha_exponent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for a system in d=3 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define the key parameters.\n    # d is the spatial dimension.\n    d = 3\n    # d_c is the upper critical dimension for the n-vector model.\n    d_c = 4\n    # n is the number of components of the order parameter.\n    # We assume the Ising model, where n=1.\n    n = 1\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate epsilon (ϵ).\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: Use the formula and compute alpha.\n    # The first-order expansion for α is: α ≈ (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\n    # We use Sympy to represent it as an exact fraction.\n    numerator = (4 - n) * epsilon\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n    alpha_fraction = sympy.Rational(numerator, denominator)\n    alpha_decimal = float(alpha_fraction)\n\n    # Step 5: Print the explanation and the result.\n    print(\"In renormalization group theory, the specific heat scaling exponent α can be calculated using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion.\")\n    print(\"\\n--- Calculation Steps ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
