# The question asks for the fundamental structural difference between Type-2 and Type-3 fuzzy membership functions.

# A Type-2 fuzzy set adds a layer of uncertainty to a Type-1 set by making the membership grade itself a fuzzy value.
# This introduces a secondary membership function. Its structure can be represented in 3 dimensions (primary variable, primary membership, secondary membership).

# A Type-3 fuzzy set adds another layer of uncertainty. The secondary membership grade from the Type-2 set is now also considered fuzzy.
# To model this new layer of uncertainty, a tertiary membership function is required. This represents a move to a 4-dimensional conceptual structure.

# Therefore, the key structural component added when moving from Type-2 to Type-3 is the tertiary membership function.

# Let's identify the correct answer choice.
answer_key = 'F'
answer_text = 'Tertiary membership functions introduced'

# The final code outputs the selected answer and its text.
print("The fundamental difference between type-2 and type-3 fuzzy membership functions in terms of dimensional structure is:")
print(f"Answer: {answer_key}. {answer_text}")
