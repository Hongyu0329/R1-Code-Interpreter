    "To determine the main projection target of ASJ axons in the adult C. elegans, I will analyze a public connectome dataset. Specifically, I will use the Witvliet et al. (2021) adult hermaphrodite connectome data.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Fetch the Data**: I will programmatically download the neuron connection data, which is available as a CSV file from a public repository.\n2.  **Filter for ASJ Connections**: The neuron ASJ is a bilateral pair, consisting of ASJL and ASJR. I will filter the dataset to isolate all outgoing synaptic connections from these two neurons.\n3.  **Aggregate Synapse Counts**: I will group the filtered connections by their postsynaptic (target) neuron and sum the number of synapses for each target. This accounts for synapses from both ASJL and ASJR.\n4.  **Identify the Main Target**: I will find the target neuron that receives the highest total number of synapses from the ASJ pair.\n5.  **Display the Result**: The script will print the contribution from both ASJL and ASJR to the main target, showing the final summation to satisfy the \"output each number in the final equation\" requirement, and state the final answer.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform this analysis.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_main_target():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the C. elegans connectome to find the main synaptic target of ASJ neurons.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # The URL points to the N2U adult hermaphrodite connectome data (Witvliet et al., 2021)\n        url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/celegans/Connectome/master/Data/N2U/N2U_neuron_connections.csv'\n        \n        # Load the connectome data into a pandas DataFrame\n        df = pd.read_csv(url)\n        \n        # ASJ is a neuron pair: ASJL and ASJR.
