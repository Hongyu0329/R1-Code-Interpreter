def solve_violin_parameters():

  This function determines and prints the mapping between violin playing variations
  and the parameter groups that are primarily affected.

  The mapping is as follows:
  (1) sul ponticello -> group ii
  (2) with a bridge mute -> group iv
  (3) in a room filled with helium -> group iii
  (4) on the E string -> group i

  The direction of change for the last member of the group for (2), which is f_2, is 'down'.
