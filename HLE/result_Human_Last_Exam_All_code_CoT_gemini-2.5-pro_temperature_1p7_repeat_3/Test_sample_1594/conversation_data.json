    "To solve this riddle, we need to visualize the buildings from above. The most practical way to do this with code is to find the geographic coordinates of the schools and then generate a link to a satellite map of that location.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  I will use the Python library `geopy` to perform geocoding. This will convert the schools' addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates.\n2.  Since the two schools, Istituto Galilei-Pacinotti and Istituto Ulisse Dini, are adjacent, finding the coordinates for one is sufficient to center our map.\n3.  Once I have the coordinates, the script will construct a URL for Google Maps. This URL will be specifically formatted to open in satellite view and at a close zoom level.\n4.  The script will then print this URL. By visiting the link, you can see the shape formed by the school buildings. I will then provide the final answer based on this observation.\n\n```python\n# First, ensure you have the geopy library installed:\n# pip install geopy\n\nfrom geopy.geocoders import Nominatim\n\ndef find_school_building_shape():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the coordinates of the Pisa highschools and generates a\n    satellite map URL to observe the shape of their buildings.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Initialize the geolocator\n        geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent=\"school_shape_finder_app\")\n\n        # The schools are adjacent on Via Benedetto Croce, Pisa.\n        # We can use one address to center the map.\n        address = \"Liceo Scientifico Ulisse Dini, Pisa, Italy\"\n        \n        print(f\"Searching for coordinates of: {address}\")\n        location = geolocator.geocode(address, timeout=10)\n\n        if location:\n            # Extract latitude and longitude\n            lat = location.latitude\n            lon = location.longitude\n            zoom = 19  # A close zoom level to see building details\n            \n            # Note: The numbers in the URL are the latitude, longitude, and zoom level.\n            # Printing each number as requested by the prompt.\n            print(f\"Found Latitude: {lat}\")\n            print(f\"Found Longitude: {lon}\")\n            print(f\"Using Zoom Level: {zoom}\")\n            \n            # Construct the Google Maps URL for satellite view\n            # The format is https://www.google.com/maps/@{latitude},{longitude},{zoom}z/data=!3m1!1e3\n            # The final '!3m1!1e3' argument forces satellite imagery.\n            map_url = f\"https://www.google.com/maps/@{lat},{lon},{zoom}z/data=!3m1!1e3\"\n\n            print(\"\\n---------------------------------------------------------\")\n            print(\"By observing the satellite view at the URL below,\")\n            print(\"you can see the letter formed by the two school buildings.\")\n            print(\"URL for Satellite View:\")\n            print(map_url)\n            print(\"---------------------------------------------------------\")\n\n        else:\n            print(\"Could not find the location.
