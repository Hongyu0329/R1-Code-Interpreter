    "Of course. I will solve this by breaking down the question, referencing Isaac Newton's association between the color spectrum and the musical scale, and then determining the specific note that corresponds to the requested range.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  First, I will establish the mapping between the seven colors of Newton's spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet) and the seven notes of a diatonic musical scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B).\n2.  Next, I will determine the color produced when \"yellow\" and \"blue\" are combined. In the context of light and pigments, this combination results in \"green\".\n3.  The question asks for the note in the range between this new color (Green) and \"blue\".\n4.  By looking at the established color/note sequence, I will identify the note that corresponds to the segment of the spectrum that follows Green, which is Blue.\n5.  Finally, I will print the resulting note.\n\n```python\ndef solve_newton_music_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the riddle by mapping Newton's color circle to a musical scale.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define Newton's mapping of colors to the musical scale.\n    color_note_map = {\n        \"Red\": \"C\",\n        \"Orange\": \"D\",\n        \"Yellow\": \"E\",\n        \"Green\": \"F\",\n        \"Blue\": \"G\",\n        \"Indigo\": \"A\",\n        \"Violet\": \"B\"\n    }\n\n    print(\"This problem connects Isaac Newton's color circle to a musical scale.\")\n    print(\"Here is the standard mapping Newton proposed:\")\n    for color, note in color_note_map.items():\n        print(f\"- {color} -> Note {note}\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Determine the colors from the user's question.\n    # The first color is a mixture of yellow and blue.\n    color1_from_mix = \"Green\"\n    # The second color is blue itself.\n    color2 = \"Blue\"\n\n    print(f\"\\nThe first color is the result of combining yellow and blue, which is {color1_from_mix}.\")\n    print(f\"The second color is {color2}.\")\n\n    # Step 3: Find the corresponding musical notes.\n    note1 = color_note_map[color1_from_mix]\n    note2 = color_note_map[color2]\n\n    print(f\"\\nAccording to the mapping, the note for {color1_from_mix} is {note1}.\")\n    print(f\"The note for {color2} is {note2}.\")\n\n    # Step 4: Identify the note for the specified range.\n    print(f\"\\nThe question asks for the note corresponding to the range 'between' {color1_from_mix} and {color2}.\")\n    print(f\"On Newton's color spectrum, the color segment that comes after {color1_from_mix} is {color2}.\")\n    print(f\"Therefore, the musical note representing this range is the one associated with {color2}.\")\n\n    final_answer = note2\n    print(f\"\\nThe final answer is the note: {final_answer}\")\n\nsolve_newton_music_riddle()\n```\n<<<G>>>"
