    "To determine the maximum number of logical qubits, we can follow this plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the encoding rule:** For a single patch of a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits that can be encoded is equal to the number of holes (or defects) introduced in it.\n2.  **Calculate for one patch:** The problem states there are two holes in each patch. Therefore, one patch can encode 2 logical qubits.\n3.  **Calculate for all patches:** Since there are two separate patches, the total number of logical qubits is the sum of the qubits from each patch. We will add the logical qubits from the first patch to the logical qubits from the second patch.\n4.  **Final Output:** The python code will perform this simple addition and print the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_qubits():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the maximum number of logical qubits for a given surface code configuration.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of separate surface code patches\n    num_patches = 2\n\n    # Number of holes in each patch\n    num_holes_per_patch = 2\n\n    # For a planar surface code, the number of logical qubits is equal to the number of holes.\n    qubits_per_patch = num_holes_per_patch\n\n    # The total number of logical qubits is the sum from all separate patches.\n    total_logical_qubits = qubits_per_patch * num_patches\n\n    print(\"Each patch can encode a number of logical qubits equal to its number of holes.\")\n    print(f\"Number of logical qubits from Patch 1: {qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(f\"Number of logical qubits from Patch 2: {qubits_per_patch}\")\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of logical qubits is the sum from both patches.\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {qubits_per_patch} + {qubits_per_patch} = {total_logical_qubits}\")\n\nsolve_qubits()\n```\n<<<4>>>"
