    print("-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
    print("Evaluating Choice A (Osteoarthritis): Unlikely. While it causes ankle pain, the presentation is too acutely inflammatory. Aspiration would not be 'acellular' (no WBCs).")
    print("Evaluating Choice C (Septic Arthritis): RULED OUT. Septic fluid would be full of organisms and a very high count of WBCs.")
    print("Evaluating Choice E (Pseudogout): RULED OUT. This is a crystal arthropathy, but the fluid analysis showed NO crystals.")
    print("(Note: Gout, though not an option, is also ruled out by the absence of crystals).")
    print("Evaluating Choice D (Chronic osteomyelitis): Unlikely. An adjacent bone infection would typically cause a 'sympathetic effusion' with at least some inflammatory cells (WBCs) in the joint fluid. X-rays may eventually show bony changes.")
    print("Evaluating Choice B (Charcot Arthropathy): HIGHLY LIKELY. This condition classically presents as an acutely red, hot, swollen joint mimicking infection, often after minor trauma. The key diagnostic feature that matches this case perfectly is a NON-INFLAMMATORY synovial fluid (no/few WBCs) despite the joint's appearance. It also fails to respond to standard anti-inflammatory medications.")

    print("\nStep 3: Final Conclusion")
    print("The final diagnosis is the one that explains all the findings, especially the paradoxical combination of an clinically inflamed joint and non-inflammatory joint fluid.")
    print("Only Charcot Arthropathy fits this complete picture.")
