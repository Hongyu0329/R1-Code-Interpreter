    Calculates the minimum number of particles N to form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor.

    The logic is as follows:
    A pseudo-tensor gains a sign flip under improper rotations. To construct one
    from true vectors (like particle position differences), one must use an
    operation that introduces this property, like a cross product.

    The most particle-efficient method is to form a rank-7 pseudo-tensor (P7)
    by combining a rank-1 pseudo-tensor (a pseudo-vector, Vp) and a
    rank-6 true tensor (T6): P7 = Vp ⊗ T6.

    We then find the minimum number of particles for each part.
