# The problem states that C(n) is asymptotic to b * n^(3/2).
# Based on the analysis, the most plausible interpretation is that C(n)
# represents the expected commute time between two random vertices on a random tree.
# This leads to the constant b being equal to the square root of (2 * pi).

# The final equation is b = sqrt(2 * pi)
# We will print the numbers in this equation.
