    "Here is a thinking process that leads to the solution:\n\n### Step-by-step Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to find the \"separatrix\" for the given system of differential equations in the upper half-plane ($u \\geq 0$). A separatrix is a special trajectory that separates regions of the phase plane with different qualitative behaviors. Typically, these are the stable or unstable manifolds associated with saddle points.\n\n2.  **Find Equilibrium Points:** First, we need to find the points where the system is stationary, i.e., where $d'(t)=0$ and $u'(t)=0$. These are called equilibrium (or critical) points.\n    *   Set $u'(t) = u^2(u - 1) = 0$. This gives $u=0$ or $u=1$.\n    *   **Case u=0:** Substitute into $d'(t)=0$.\n        $2d^2 + (-3(0) + 5(0)^2)d - 0 = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d^2 = 0 \\Rightarrow d=0$. This gives the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    *   **Case u=1:** Substitute into $d'(t)=0$.\n        $2d^2 + (-3(1) + 5(1)^2)d - 1^3(1-1) = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d^2 + 2d = 0 \\Rightarrow 2d(d+1)=0$. This gives $d=0$ or $d=-1$. We find two more equilibrium points: **(0, 1)** and **(-1, 1)**.\n\n3.  **Analyze the Stability of Equilibrium Points:** To understand the behavior of trajectories near these points, we classify them by linearizing the system. This involves computing the Jacobian matrix and its eigenvalues at each point.\n    *   Let $f(d, u) = 2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3 + u^4$ and $g(d, u) = u^3 - u^2$.\n    *   The Jacobian matrix is $J(d, u) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial u} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial d} & \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial u} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4d - 3u + 5u^2 & (-3 + 10u)d - 3u^2 + 4u^3 \\\\ 0 & 3u^2 - 2u \\end{pmatrix}$.\n    *   **At (-1, 1):**\n        $J(-1, 1) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4(-1) - 3(1) + 5(1)^2 & (-3 + 10(1))(-1) - 3(1)^2 + 4(1)^3 \\\\ 0 & 3(1)^2 - 2(1) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 & -6 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n        The eigenvalues are the diagonal entries: $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1$. Since we have one positive and one negative eigenvalue, the point **(-1, 1) is a saddle point**.\n    *   The presence of a saddle point is a strong indication that its stable and/or unstable manifolds will form the separatrices of the system.\n\n4.  **Search for an Analytical Separatrix:** Separatrices are trajectories. We can find the differential equation for the trajectories in the phase plane by computing $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{d'(t)}{u'(t)}$.\n    $\\frac{dd}{du} = \\frac{2d^2 + (-3u + 5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)}{u^2(u - 1)}$.\n    This equation looks complicated to solve directly. However, in many problems of this type, a separatrix has a simple analytical form, such as a polynomial. Let's test a simple candidate curve, for instance, of the form $d=cu^k$.\n\n5.  **Test a Candidate Solution:** Let's try the candidate function $d = -u^2$. To check if this is a valid trajectory (an invariant curve), we must show that if we start on the curve, we stay on it. This means the time derivatives must be consistent.\n    If $d(t) = -[u(t)]^2$, then by the chain rule, its time derivative is $\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u \\frac{du}{dt}$.\n    Substituting the expression for $u'(t) = u^2(u-1)$, we get the Left-Hand Side (LHS):\n    LHS = $\\frac{dd}{dt} = -2u [u^2(u-1)] = -2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    Now, we compute the Right-Hand Side (RHS) of the $d'$ equation by substituting $d=-u^2$:\n    RHS = $2d^2+(-3u+5u^2)d - u^3(1-u)$\n    RHS = $2(-u^2)^2 + (-3u+5u^2)(-u^2) - u^3 + u^4$\n    RHS = $2u^4 + (3u^3 - 5u^4) - u^3 + u^4$\n    RHS = $(2-5+1)u^4 + (3-1)u^3$\n    RHS = $-2u^4 + 2u^3$.\n\n    Since LHS = RHS, the curve defined by the equation **$d = -u^2$** is indeed a trajectory of the system.\n\n6.  **Confirm it is a Separatrix:** Let's check if this trajectory connects any equilibrium points.\n    *   For $u=1$, $d = -(1)^2 = -1$. The curve passes through the saddle point **(-1, 1)**.\n    *   For $u=0$, $d = -(0)^2 = 0$. The curve passes through the equilibrium point **(0, 0)**.\n    A trajectory that connects two equilibrium points (especially one being a saddle) is a classic example of a separatrix (a heteroclinic orbit in this case). It is the unstable manifold of the saddle point $(-1,1)$ because trajectories along it move away from the saddle as time increases (for $u<1$, $u'(t)<0$, so $u$ moves away from 1).\n\n7.  **Final Output Formulation:** The question asks for the separatrix. We have found its equation: $d = -u^2$, which can be rewritten as $d + u^2 = 0$. The final python code should print this equation, making sure to explicitly include all numerical coefficients as requested.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\n# Define the variables\nd, u = sympy.symbols('d u')\n\n# The equation of the separatrix is d = -u**2, which can be written as d + u**2 = 0.\n# We represent this equation with coefficients for each term.\nd_coeff = 1\nu_coeff = 1\nu_power = 2\nconstant = 0\n\n# Format the equation string to explicitly show the numbers\n# The equation is: 1*d + 1*u**2 = 0\nequation_str = f\"{d_coeff}*d + {u_coeff}*u**{u_power} = {constant}\"\n\nprint(\"The equation for the separatrix is:\")\nprint(equation_str)\n\n```\n<<<1*d + 1*u**2 = 0>>>"
