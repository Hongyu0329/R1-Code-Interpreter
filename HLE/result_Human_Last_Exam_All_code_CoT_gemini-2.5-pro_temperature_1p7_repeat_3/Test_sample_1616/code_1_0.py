def find_word():
    """
    This function identifies the word from a given list that has not undergone
    trisyllabic laxing during its sound development.

    The analysis is as follows:
    - Trisyllabic laxing is a rule that applies to words of three or more syllables.
    - 'derivative', 'serenity', and 'gratitude' are all three or more syllables and clearly demonstrate this vowel-shortening rule.
    - 'pleasant', 'shadow', and 'southern' are all two-syllable words, so they have not undergone *trisyllabic* laxing.
    - Among these three, 'southern' is the strongest choice. Its vowel change (/aʊ/ -> /ʌ/) is not part of the standard tense-lax set affected by the rule (e.g., sane/sanity), making it an outlier in more than one way.
