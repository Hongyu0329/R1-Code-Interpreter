    """
    Solves a three-part trivia question about Nabokov's "Pale Fire"
    and a Sherlock Holmes allusion.
    """

    # Part A: The Sherlock Holmes allusion
    # The couplet alludes to "The Adventure of the Priory School," where the
    # Duke of Holdernesse uses special shoes to create fake cow tracks.
    # So, the story is Priory School and the tracks belonged to a "cow".
    answer_a = 6

    # Part C: Nabokov's prior work
    # Nabokov's most intensive experience with "intricate back-referencing"
    # was during his massive project of translating and annotating Pushkin's
    # "Eugene Onegin." The structure of "Pale Fire" parodies this work.
    answer_c = 7

    # Part B: The theme of "Pale Fire" and the final calculation
    # The puzzle states that the sum of the three answers is a multiple of 8.
    # Sum of A and C = 6 + 7 = 13.
    # To find B, we need to find a number such that (13 + B) is a multiple of 8.
    # If B=3, the sum is 13 + 3 = 16, which is 8 * 2.
    # This theme, (3) "education vs mis-education", fits the novel's structure
    # where the commentator Kinbote (a professor) misleads the reader about the poem.
    answer_b = 3

    # The final calculation
    total = answer_a + answer_b + answer_c

    # Print the answer in the required format.
    print("The final answer is composed of the three numbers corresponding to the correct options.")
    print(f"The numbers are: {answer_a} {answer_b} {answer_c}")
    print("The final equation is:")
    print(f"{answer_a} + {answer_b} + {answer_c} = {total}")
    print(f"The sum, {total}, is a multiple of 8.")
    
    # Required final output format
    print("\n<<<6 3 7>>>")
