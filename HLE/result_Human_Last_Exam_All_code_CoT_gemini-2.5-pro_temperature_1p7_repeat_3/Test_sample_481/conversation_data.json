    "I will determine the numerical imprints on the specified capsules and then generate a Python script to display this information.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  I will first consult reliable drug identification resources to find the numerical imprint for Teva brand fluoxetine 10mg capsules.\n2.  Next, I will do the same for Teva brand fluoxetine 20mg capsules.\n3.  Finally, I will create a Python script that stores these numbers in variables and prints them in a clear statement, adhering to all the specified constraints.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define the numerical imprint for each capsule.\n# The number for the Teva 10mg fluoxetine capsule is 3108.\nnumber_on_10mg = 3108\n\n# The number for the Teva 20mg fluoxetine capsule is 3109.\nnumber_on_20mg = 3109\n\n# Step 2: Print the results, showing each number as requested.\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the 10mg capsule is {number_on_10mg}.\")\nprint(f\"The number imprinted on the 20mg capsule is {number_on_20mg}.\")\n```\n<<<3108 and 3109>>>"
