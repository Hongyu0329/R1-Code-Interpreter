    "Of course. Here is the step-by-step derivation and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Step-by-step derivation\n\n1.  **Identify the Mathematical Problem:** The objective is to compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of the direct product of Thompson's group T with itself, with trivial real coefficients. This is denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n2.  **Apply the Künneth Formula:** For bounded cohomology, the Künneth formula for a direct product of groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ provides the dimension of the cohomology groups of their product. The formula is:\n    $\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=n} \\dim H_b^p(G_1, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(G_2, \\mathbb{R})$.\n\n3.  **Specialize to the Problem:** In this case, $G_1 = T$, $G_2 = T$, and the degree is $n=4$. The formula becomes:\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{p+q=4} \\dim H_b^p(T, \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^q(T, \\mathbb{R})$.\n    This sum is over all non-negative integer pairs $(p, q)$ that add up to 4: (0, 4), (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1), and (4, 0).\n\n4.  **Use Known Results for Thompson's Group T:** The dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of Thompson's group T with real coefficients are well-known results in the field:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T, \\mathbb{R}) = \\infty$ (it is an infinite-dimensional space)\n    *   $\\dim H_b^3(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 1$\n    *   $\\dim H_b^n(T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $n \\geq 4$.\n\n5.  **Calculate Each Term of the Sum:**\n    *   Term (p=0, q=4): $\\dim H_b^0(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^4(T) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    *   Term (p=1, q=3): $\\dim H_b^1(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^3(T) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n    *   Term (p=2, q=2): $\\dim H_b^2(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^2(T) = \\infty \\cdot \\infty = \\infty$.\n    *   Term (p=3, q=1): $\\dim H_b^3(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^1(T) = 1 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\n    *   Term (p=4, q=0): $\\dim H_b^4(T) \\cdot \\dim H_b^0(T) = 0 \\cdot 1 = 0$.\n\n6.  **Sum the Results:** Adding the values of the terms gives the total dimension:\n    $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T, \\mathbb{R}) = 0 + 0 + \\infty + 0 + 0 = \\infty$.\n\nThe dimension is infinite.
