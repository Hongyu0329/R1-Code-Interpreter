# Plan:
# The problem asks for the minimum cuts to dice a 4x4x4 cube into 1x1x1 cubes
# with a knife that can only cut 2cm deep.

# Assumptions:
# 1. We can re-arrange and rotate pieces between cuts.
# 2. "Stacking" pieces for a cut is allowed, but the height of the stack cannot exceed 2cm.

# The overall task requires making 3 cuts along each of the 3 dimensions.
# Let's analyze the cuts based on the size of the dimension being cut.

# Stage 1: The three central cuts (at the 2cm mark of each 4cm side).
# To make a cut on a 4cm dimension, the piece must be 4cm high.
# Since the knife only cuts 2cm deep, we must make one cut, flip the piece, and make a second cut.
# This costs 2 passes per central cut plane.
cuts_center_plane_x = 2
cuts_center_plane_y = 2
cuts_center_plane_z = 2

# These first 3*2=6 cuts result in 8 cubes of size 2x2x2.

# Stage 2: The remaining cuts.
# All remaining cuts are on 2cm dimensions.
# We can orient the pieces so their height is 2cm. The knife can cut this in a single pass.
# We can stack all pieces side-by-side and cut them simultaneously.
# For each of the three dimensions, we need one more set of cuts.
cuts_final_planes_x = 1
cuts_final_planes_y = 1
cuts_final_planes_z = 1

# These 3*1=3 cuts will complete the dicing process.

# Total number of cuts is the sum of all passes.
total_cuts = (cuts_center_plane_x + cuts_center_plane_y + cuts_center_plane_z +
              cuts_final_planes_x + cuts_final_planes_y + cuts_final_planes_z)

print("\nStage 1: Cutting the initial 4cm dimensions.")
print("Each of the 3 central planes requires 2 passes (cut, flip, cut) due to the 4cm height.")
