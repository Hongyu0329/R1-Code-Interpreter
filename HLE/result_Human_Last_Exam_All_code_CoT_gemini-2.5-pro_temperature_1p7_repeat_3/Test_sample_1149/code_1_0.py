# The dinosaur Irritator challengeri has a feature on its skull called the lacrimal recess.
# Scientific literature, specifically the detailed redescription of the skull,
# states that this recess is divided by a ridge.

# This ridge separates the recess into an anterior depression and a posterior depression.

# We represent the anterior depression with the number 1.
anterior_depression = 1

# We represent the posterior depression with the number 1.
posterior_depression = 1

# To find the total number of depressions, we simply add them together.
total_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression

print("The lacrimal recess is subdivided into a larger anterior depression and a smaller posterior one.")
print("The total number of depressions is calculated as follows:")
print(f"{anterior_depression} + {posterior_depression} = {total_depressions}")
