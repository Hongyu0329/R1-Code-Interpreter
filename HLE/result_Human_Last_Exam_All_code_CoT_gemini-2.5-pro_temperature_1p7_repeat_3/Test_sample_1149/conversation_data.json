    "Based on the scientific redescription of the *Irritator challengeri* holotype skull by Sues et al. (2002), the lacrimal recess is a distinct feature. This recess is not a single depression but is subdivided by a vertical ridge. This subdivision creates two separate depressions: a larger one anteriorly and a smaller one posteriorly.\n\nMy plan is to use Python to represent this anatomical fact. I will assign a value of 1 to the anterior depression and a value of 1 to the posterior depression. Then, I will add them together to calculate the total number of depressions in the lacrimal recess and print the full equation.\n\n```python\n# The dinosaur Irritator challengeri has a feature on its skull called the lacrimal recess.\n# Scientific literature, specifically the detailed redescription of the skull,\n# states that this recess is divided by a ridge.\n\n# This ridge separates the recess into an anterior depression and a posterior depression.\n\n# We represent the anterior depression with the number 1.\nanterior_depression = 1\n\n# We represent the posterior depression with the number 1.\nposterior_depression = 1\n\n# To find the total number of depressions, we simply add them together.\ntotal_depressions = anterior_depression + posterior_depression\n\nprint(\"The lacrimal recess is subdivided into a larger anterior depression and a smaller posterior one.\")\nprint(\"The total number of depressions is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"{anterior_depression} + {posterior_depression} = {total_depressions}\")\n\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response.
