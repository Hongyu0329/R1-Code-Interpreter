    "This task requires identifying the correct diet for adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies) from a list of options. I will write a Python script to solve this.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  Create a small \"knowledge base\" in the script, represented as a Python dictionary, containing known facts about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n2.  Evaluate the primary food items listed in the answer choices (Nectar, Aphids, Leaf tissue) against this knowledge base.\n3.  To satisfy the prompt's requirement for an \"equation,\" I will assign a score of `1` to a correct food source and `0` to an incorrect one.\n4.  The script will then print the evaluation of each relevant component and use their scores to show why the composite answer `F` (A and E) is correct, and `G` (D and E) is incorrect.\n5.  Finally, the script will state the most comprehensive correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates potential food sources for adult Raphidiopterans based on established biological facts.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Establish a knowledge base about the diet of adult Raphidiopterans.\n    # Facts: Adults are primarily predatory on small, soft-bodied insects,\n    # but also supplement their diet with nectar and pollen.
