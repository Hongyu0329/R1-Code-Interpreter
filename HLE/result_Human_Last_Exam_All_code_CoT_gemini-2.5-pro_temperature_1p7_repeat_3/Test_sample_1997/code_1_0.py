    This function determines and prints the Genji-ko partition for Chapter 39.

    The Tale of Genji incense patterns (Genji-kō) associate a unique pattern
    with each chapter. The patterns are composed of 5 vertical lines, numbered 1 to 5
    from right to left. Lines connected by a horizontal bar belong to the same set.

    For Chapter 39 ("Yūgiri"):
    - Line 1 is not connected to any other line.
    - Lines 2, 3, and 4 are connected.
    - Line 5 is not connected to any other line.

    This translates to the partition: {{1}, {2, 3, 4}, {5}}.
