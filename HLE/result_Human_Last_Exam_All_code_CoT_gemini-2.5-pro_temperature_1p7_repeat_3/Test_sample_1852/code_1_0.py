# The problem reduces to identifying the set X of regular cardinals λ
# such that a tower of length λ exists on ω₁.
# Based on set-theoretic principles and the assumption 2^ω₁ = ω₂,
# we concluded that the only such cardinal is ω₂.
# Therefore, X = {ω₂}.

# δ₁ is the supremum of X, which is ω₂.
# δ₂ is the infimum of X, which is ω₂.

# We represent ω_n by its index n.
# So, ω₂ is represented by the number 2.
delta1_index = 2
delta2_index = 2

# Cardinal addition ω_a + ω_b results in ω_{max(a, b)}.
# So, ω₂ + ω₂ = ω₂.
# In terms of indices, this is max(2, 2) = 2.
sum_index = max(delta1_index, delta2_index)

# The final equation is δ₁ + δ₂ = (result).
# Representing the cardinals by their indices, we have:
print(f"δ₁ is ω_{delta1_index}")
print(f"δ₂ is ω_{delta2_index}")
print(f"The sum δ₁ + δ₂ is ω_{sum_index}")
print(f"The final equation in terms of indices is: {delta1_index} + {delta2_index} = {sum_index}")
