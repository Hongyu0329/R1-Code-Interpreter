# In quantum logic, a proposition is associated with a subspace of a Hilbert space.
# A proposition is "False" if its corresponding subspace is the zero subspace {0}.

# Let's represent the value of a "False" proposition with the number 0.
FALSE = 0

# 1. Evaluate the proposition 'a AND b' (a ∧ b).
# 'a' is a proposition about a finite momentum interval.
# 'b' is a proposition about a finite position interval.
# According to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, a particle cannot be simultaneously
# localized in both a finite position and a finite momentum interval.
# Therefore, the conjunction 'a AND b' is always False.
a_and_b = FALSE

# 2. Evaluate the proposition 'a AND c' (a ∧ c).
# Similarly, 'c' is also a proposition about a finite position interval.
# Therefore, the conjunction 'a AND c' is also always False.
a_and_c = FALSE

# 3. Evaluate the full expression from option B: (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c).
# The logical OR (∨) of two False propositions results in a False proposition.
# In Python, the 'or' operator on numbers treats 0 as False.
result = a_and_b or a_and_c

# 4. Print the final equation with all values to show the evaluation.
