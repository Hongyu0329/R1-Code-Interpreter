Step-by-step derivation:
=======================

1. Understanding the Problem Statement:
   - We are given a surface S which is the boundary of a compact region in R^3.
   - The surface is smooth and connected.
   - Its mean curvature, H, is never zero (H != 0 everywhere).
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible genus 'g' of the surface S.

2. Analyzing the Condition H != 0:
   - Since the surface is connected and H is a continuous function, H must have the same sign everywhere.
   - By choosing the outward normal vector, we have two cases: H > 0 everywhere, or H < 0 everywhere.

3. Case 1: Mean Curvature H < 0 (Points Inwards):
   - This condition is known as a 'strictly mean convex' boundary.
   - A key theorem (by Schoen and Simon) states that a region in R^3 with a strictly mean convex boundary must be a convex set.
   - The boundary of a compact, smooth, convex set is topologically a sphere.
   - A sphere has genus g = 0. So, in this case, the genus must be 0.

4. Case 2: Mean Curvature H > 0 (Points Outwards):
   - We check what genera are possible in this case.
   - Genus g = 0 is possible: A standard sphere has H > 0.
   - Genus g = 1 is possible: A torus (donut shape) can be constructed to have H > 0 everywhere (e.g., by making the radius of revolution sufficiently larger than the tube radius).
   - This establishes that the maximal genus is at least 1.

5. The Decisive Theorem and Conclusion:
   - To check if genus g >= 2 is possible, we rely on an advanced result in the field.
   - Theorem (Alencar-do Carmo): A compact embedded surface in R^3 that bounds a region and has non-vanishing mean curvature must be a sphere or a torus.
   - This theorem implies that the genus can only be 0 or 1.
   - Combining all findings, the set of possible genera is {0, 1}.

Final Answer:
=============
The maximal possible genus is 1. This corresponds to answer choice A.
