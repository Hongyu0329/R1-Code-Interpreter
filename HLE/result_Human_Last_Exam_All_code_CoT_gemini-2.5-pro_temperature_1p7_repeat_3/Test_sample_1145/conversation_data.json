    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of finding a particle in a 1D box within a specific interval. This is a classic quantum mechanics problem.\n\n### **Plan**\n\n1.  **Identify the governing equation:** The probability `P` of finding a particle in an interval from `x1` to `x2` is given by the integral of the probability density function, `|ψ_n(x)|²`, over that interval:\n    `P = ∫[x1, x2] |ψ_n(x)|² dx`\n\n2.  **Define the probability density function:** For a particle in a 1D box of length `a`, the normalized wavefunction is `ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/a) * sin(nπx/a)`. Therefore, the probability density is:\n    `|ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(nπx/a)`\n\n3.  **Set up the specific integral:** The problem specifies the quantum state `n = 2` and the interval from `x1 = 0.495a` to `x2 = 0.505a`. The integral to solve is:\n    `P = ∫[0.495a, 0.505a] (2/a) * sin²(2πx/a) dx`\n\n4.  **Solve the integral:** While this integral can be solved analytically, it's more straightforward and less prone to error to solve it numerically using Python. We can use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function for high-precision numerical integration. For simplicity in the code, we can set the length of the box `a = 1`, as the probability `P` is a dimensionless quantity and the result is independent of `a`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan, states the equation with the given numbers, calculates the integral, and prints the final probability.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\n# Define constants from the problem\nn = 2\nx1_factor = 0.495\nx2_factor = 0.505\n# We can set the box length 'a' to 1.0 for simplicity. \n# The probability is a dimensionless ratio, so the result is independent of 'a'.\na = 1.0\n\n# Explain the problem and the physics\nprint(\"To find the probability of the particle in a 1D box between two positions,\")\nprint(\"we integrate the probability density function |ψ(x)|² over that interval.\")\nprint(\"The probability density is |ψ_n(x)|² = (2/a) * sin²(n*pi*x/a).\\n\")\n\n# State the specific equation being solved, showing the numbers.\nprint(\"For this problem, the constants are:\")\nprint(f\"Quantum state, n = {n}\")\nprint(f\"Interval = [{x1_factor}a, {x2_factor}a]\\n\")\n\nprint(\"The equation for the probability (P) is the integral:\")\nprint(f\"P = Integral from x={x1_factor}a to x={x2_factor}a of (2/a) * sin^2({n}*pi*x/a) dx\\n\")\n\n# Define the function to integrate\ndef probability_density(x, n_val, L):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the probability density |ψ(x)|² for a particle in a 1D box.\n    \"\"\"\n    return (2.0 / L) * (np.sin(n_val * np.pi * x / L))**2\n\n# Calculate the integration limits for a=1\nx1 = x1_factor * a\nx2 = x2_factor * a\n\n# Perform the numerical integration\n# The args=(n, a) passes the additional parameters (n_val, L) to the function.\nprobability, error = quad(probability_density, x1, x2, args=(n, a))\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The calculated probability is:\")\nprint(probability)\nprint(f\"(The estimated numerical error is: {error})\")\n```\n<<<1.3159033363364956e-05>>>"
