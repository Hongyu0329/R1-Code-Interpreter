# The problem asks to calculate the value of the expression:
# (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) + 10^15
#
# From the derivation, we found the value of ||alpha||^2.

# Let's define the numerical values for each part of the equation.
TWO = 2
TEN_TO_THE_POWER_OF_15 = 10**15

# The Basel problem gives us sum_{k=1 to inf} (1/k^2) = pi^2 / 6
pi_squared_over_6 = (math.pi**2) / 6

# The denominator of the fraction is (pi^2 / 6 - 1)
denominator = pi_squared_over_6 - 1

# We derived that ||alpha||^2 = (1/2) * (pi^2 / 6 - 1)
norm_alpha_squared = 0.5 * denominator

# Now we assemble the full expression. Due to symbolic cancellation,
# the fraction (2 * ||alpha||^2) / (pi^2/6 - 1) simplifies to 1.
# Let's compute it numerically to verify.
final_result = (TWO * norm_alpha_squared) / denominator + TEN_TO_THE_POWER_OF_15
