    "To determine the exact number of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ of type $E_8$ over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Utilize a key theorem:** There is a fundamental theorem in the theory of algebraic groups over finite fields that connects the $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori of a reductive group $G$ to its Weyl group $W$. The theorem states that the number of $G(\\mathbb{F}_q)$-conjugacy classes of $\\mathbb{F}_q$-rational maximal tori is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of the Weyl group $W$. We assume $G$ is split over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, which is standard for such questions unless stated otherwise.\n2.  **Identify the specific Weyl group:** For a group $G$ of type $E_8$, the Weyl group is denoted as $W(E_8)$.\n3.  **Find the number of conjugacy classes:** The problem is now reduced to finding the number of conjugacy classes of the group $W(E_8)$. This is a known result in mathematics, specifically in the study of finite reflection groups and Lie theory.\n4.  **Provide the solution via a script:** I will write a Python script to present this information and print the final numerical answer, explaining the reasoning as outlined above.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef get_number_of_maximal_tori_e8():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the number of Fq-rational maximal tori\n    for a reductive group of type E8.\n\n    The solution relies on a well-established theorem in the theory of\n    algebraic groups.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The algebraic group G is of type E8.\n    group_type = \"E_8\"\n    \n    # The corresponding Weyl group is W(E_8).\n    weyl_group_name = \"W(E_8)\"\n    \n    # According to a fundamental theorem for reductive groups over finite fields,\n    # the number of Fq-rational maximal tori (up to G(Fq)-conjugacy)\n    # is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group.\n    \n    # The number of conjugacy classes for the Weyl group W(E_8) is a\n    # known value from the study of reflection groups.\n    # The character table of W(E_8), which was famously computed, has 112 rows\n    # and 112 columns. The number of columns corresponds to the number of\n    # conjugacy classes.\n    num_conjugacy_classes = 112\n    \n    # Therefore, the number of Fq-rational maximal tori is this value.\n    num_tori = num_conjugacy_classes\n    \n    print(f\"Let G be a reductive group of type {group_type} over the finite field Fq.\")\n    print(\"The number of Fq-rational maximal tori, up to G(Fq)-conjugacy, is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of its Weyl group W.\")\n    print(f\"For type {group_type}, the Weyl group is {weyl_group_name}.\")\n    \n    # Following the prompt to output numbers in the final equation.\n    # The \"equation\" is the equality stated by the theorem.\n    print(f\"Number of conjugacy classes of {weyl_group_name} = {num_conjugacy_classes}\")\n    print(f\"Final Answer: The number of Fq-rational maximal tori of G is {num_tori}.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    get_number_of_maximal_tori_e8()\n```\n<<<112>>>"
