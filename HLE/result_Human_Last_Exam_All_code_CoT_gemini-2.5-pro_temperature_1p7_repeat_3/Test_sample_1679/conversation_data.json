    "To answer this question, I will follow these steps:\n1.  First, I need to identify the locations of the famous Luxor Obelisks. There are two: one remains at the Luxor Temple in Luxor, Egypt, and the other stands in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\n2.  Next, I must get a list of the Academy Award winners for Best Picture, starting from the first award in 1928.\n3.  I will then chronologically review these films to see which was the first to feature a scene set in either Luxor, Egypt (at the temple) or Paris, France (at the Place de la Concorde) that shows the obelisk.\n4.  Based on my research, no early Best Picture winners were set in Luxor, Egypt. Several were set in Paris, France. After reviewing the list, the 1937 winner, *The Life of Emile Zola*, is a biopic set in Paris. This film contains scenes that depict the Place de la Concorde, where the obelisk is a prominent landmark. While other later films also show one of the obelisks (like *An American in Paris* in 1951), *The Life of Emile Zola* is the first.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that contains this researched data and programmatically finds and prints the answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_movie_with_obelisk():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function finds the first Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk\n    based on a pre-researched list of films and their settings.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A list of dictionaries containing early Best Picture winners.\n    # The 'depicts_obelisk' flag is based on research into the film's scenes.\n    # The two Luxor Obelisks are in Luxor, Egypt and Paris, France.\n    best_picture_winners = [\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1928, \"title\": \"Wings\", \"setting\": \"WWI, France\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1929, \"title\": \"The Broadway Melody\", \"setting\": \"New York\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1930, \"title\": \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", \"setting\": \"WWI, Germany\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1931, \"title\": \"Cimarron\", \"setting\": \"Oklahoma\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1932, \"title\": \"Grand Hotel\", \"setting\": \"Berlin\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1933, \"title\": \"Cavalcade\", \"setting\": \"London\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1934, \"title\": \"It Happened One Night\", \"setting\": \"USA\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": 1935, \"title\": \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"setting\": \"At Sea / Tahiti\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": <strong>1936</strong>, \"title\": \"The Great Ziegfeld\", \"setting\": \"New York\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        {\"year_of_award\": <strong>1937</strong>, \"title\": \"The Life of Emile Zola\", \"setting\": \"Paris, France\", \"depicts_obelisk\": True},\n        {\"year_of_award\": <strong>1938</strong>, \"title\": \"You Can't Take It with You\", \"setting\": \"New York\", \"depicts_obelisk\": False},\n        # Note: Later films also show an obelisk, but the one above is the first.\n        # e.g., An American in Paris (1951), Around the World in 80 Days (1956)\n    ]\n\n    first_winner = None\n    for movie in best_picture_winners:\n        if movie[\"depicts_obelisk\"]:\n            first_winner = movie\n            break\n\n    if first_winner:\n        print(\"The first Academy Award for Best Picture winner to depict a Luxor Obelisk is:\")\n        # The prompt asks to output each number in the final equation.\n        # Since there's no equation, I will print the relevant year number clearly.\n        print(f\"\\nFilm Title: {first_winner['title']}\")\n        print(f\"Year of Award: {first_winner['year_of_award']}\")\n        print(f\"\\nThis film won the award for the film year of <strong>1937</strong> at the 10th Academy Awards ceremony.\")\n        print(f\"It features the Luxor Obelisk located in the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Could not find the answer in the provided data.\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_first_movie_with_obelisk()\n```\n<<<The Life of Emile Zola>>>"
