    print(" - The N,N-diethylamido group (-CONEt2) at position 1 is a powerful directing group.")
    print(" - The dimethylamino group (-N(CH3)2) at position 3 is also a directing group.")
    print(" - Both groups cooperatively direct the strong base (sec-BuLi) to deprotonate the position between them.")
    print(" - The most acidic proton is therefore at position 2.")
    print(" - The result is the formation of a nucleophilic aryllithium intermediate at position 2.")

    print(" - The nucleophilic carbanion at position 2 of the ring attacks the electrophilic methyl group of CH3I.")
