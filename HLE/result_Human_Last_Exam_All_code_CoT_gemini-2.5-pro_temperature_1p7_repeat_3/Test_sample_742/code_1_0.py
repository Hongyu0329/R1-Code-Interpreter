    print("Can the mathematics of Quantum Mechanics (QM) prove Gödel's ontological argument for a god-like entity?")
    print("-" * 50)

    print("\n--- Step 1: Analyzing Gödel's Ontological Proof ---")
    print("Gödel's proof is an argument in the field of modal logic. It is not a physical theory or a numerical calculation.")
    print("Its key components are:")
    print("  - Domain: Abstract logic and metaphysics.")
    print("  - Axioms: A set of initial assumptions about 'positive properties'.")
    print("    - For example: `If a property is positive, its negation is not positive.`")
    print("  - Definitions: Defines a 'God-like' being as one who possesses all positive properties.")
    print("  - Goal: To prove that 'necessary existence' is a positive property, and therefore such a being must necessarily exist.")
    print("The proof's validity rests entirely within its logical framework, not on empirical evidence.")

    print("\n--- Step 2: Analyzing the Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics ---")
    print("The mathematics of QM is a framework for describing the physical universe at a fundamental level.")
    print("Its key components are:")
    print("  - Domain: Physical systems (particles, fields, energy).")
    print("  - Objects: State vectors (or wavefunctions) in a Hilbert space, which represent the state of a system.")
    print("  - Operators: Mathematical representations of physical observables (like position, momentum, and energy).")
    print("  - Equations: The Schrödinger equation, which describes how a system's state evolves in time.")
    print("The goal of this math is to make testable predictions about the results of physical experiments.")

    print("\n--- Step 3: The Fundamental Mismatch (The 'Apples and Oranges' Problem) ---")
    print("To use QM's math to address Gödel's proof, one would need to translate Gödel's concepts into QM's language.")
    print("This leads to questions that have no meaningful answer:")
    print("  - What is the 'state vector' in Hilbert space that corresponds to the abstract concept of 'goodness'?")
    print("  - What 'physical observable' or 'operator' represents 'necessary existence'?")
    print("  - How could Gödel's axiom `Axiom 1: A property is positive if and only if its negation is not positive.` be expressed using the Schrödinger equation?")
    print("\nThese concepts are from completely different 'domains of discourse'. The tools of one are not applicable to the other.")

    print("\n--- Final Conclusion ---")
    print("The mathematical framework of quantum mechanics is designed to model physical reality and make predictions about measurements.")
    print("Gödel's ontological proof is a non-physical argument rooted in abstract modal logic.")
    print("\nResult: There is no known or logical way to map the axioms and terms of Gödel's proof onto the mathematical structures of quantum mechanics.")
    print("Therefore, using the customary mathematics of quantum mechanics to prove (or disprove) the existence of Gödel's god-like entities is not possible.")
