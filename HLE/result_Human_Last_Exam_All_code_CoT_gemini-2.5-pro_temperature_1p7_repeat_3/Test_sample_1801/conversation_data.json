    "This is a knowledge-based question that can be answered directly. A Python script is not necessary for the research, but I can use one to format and present the answer as requested.\n\nMy plan is to:\n1. Identify the two Nobel laureates from my knowledge base.\n2. Create a Python script that stores their names in variables.\n3. Use a `print()` statement to display the names in a clear, formatted sentence.\n\n```python\n# The two individuals who appeared in the Enron \"Ask Why\" commercial were\n# economist Paul Krugman (who won the Nobel prize in 2008) and\n# Myron Scholes (who won the Nobel prize in 1997).\n# This script will print their names.\n\nlaureate_1 = \"Paul Krugman\"\nlaureate_2 = \"Myron Scholes\"\n\nprint(f\"The two Nobel laureates featured in the infamous 2000 Enron 'Ask Why' commercial were {laureate_1} and {laureate_2}.\")\n```\n<<<Paul Krugman and Myron Scholes>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which two Nobel laureates were featured in an infamous 2000 commercial for Enron, with the tagline \"Ask Why\"?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
