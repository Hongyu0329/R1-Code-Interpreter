# The degree of the homology group we are interested in.
degree = 31

# Based on advanced group theory, the group G is isomorphic to Thompson's group F.
# It is a widely known result/conjecture that the higher homology groups of F are trivial.
# H_k(F, Z) = 0 for k >= 2.
# We want to compute the dimension of H_{31}(G, R).
# Using the universal coefficient theorem, H_{31}(G, R) = H_{31}(G, Z) tensor R.
# Since H_{31}(G, Z) = H_{31}(F, Z) = 0, the homology group with real coefficients is the zero vector space.
# The dimension of the zero vector space is 0.

dimension = 0

# The final equation is dim(H_{degree}(G, R)) = dimension
