    This function analyzes the number of connected components for the hyperspace of
    a simple, finite, totally-disconnected ultrametric space to illustrate the concept.

    Let X be a finite set with N points and the discrete metric d(x, y) = 1 if x != y.
    This is a totally-disconnected ultrametric space.
    The non-empty closed subsets CL(X) are simply all non-empty subsets of X.
    The Wijsman topology on CL(X) for a finite space with the discrete metric is
    the discrete topology.
    Therefore, each non-empty subset is its own connected component.
    The number of connected components is the number of non-empty subsets, which is 2^N - 1.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of connected components for an
    *infinite* space X.
    Based on topological theorems, this number must be greater than 1.
    The most plausible minimum is 2, achieved when the space of closed sets
    separates into exactly two connected components: the bounded sets and the unbounded sets.

    Let's calculate the result for N=2 as a simple illustrative example.
    This corresponds to X = {0, 1}.
