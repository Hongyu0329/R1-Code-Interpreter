# The user is asking for the definition of the parameter 'kappa'
# from a model of dendritic plasticity. The definition is a formula
# composed of other parameters from the model.

# The relevant parameters mentioned or implied in the text are:
# phi: The scaling constant for the presynaptic accumulator.
# rho: The offset constant in the Hebbian learning rule.
# tau_w: The time constant for the synaptic efficacy change.
# tau_u: The time constant for the postsynaptic accumulator.
# mu: The mean firing rate, assumed equal for all synapses at steady state.
# W_thr: The weight threshold for synaptic turnover.

# The script below will print the definition of kappa using these parameters.
