    print("Analyzing the Clinical Case:")
    print("1. Patient Presentation: The patient has symptoms of sciatica (pain in the L4-S1 distribution) without any remarkable findings on X-ray. This suggests a soft-tissue cause, such as Piriformis Syndrome, where the piriformis muscle compresses the sciatic nerve.")
    print("\n2. The Physical Test: The physician is conducting a provocative test on the extended right leg while the patient is in the left decubitus position (lying on her left side). This involves the patient actively contracting a muscle against resistance to reproduce the pain.")
    print("\n3. Relevant Anatomy: The piriformis muscle is a deep gluteal muscle. Its primary function when the hip is in an extended position is EXTERNAL ROTATION of the thigh.")
    print("\n4. Evaluating the Options:")
    print("   - To confirm Piriformis Syndrome, the test must cause the piriformis muscle to contract.")
    print("   - Asking the patient to externally rotate her extended right thigh against the physician's resistance directly tests the function and irritability of the piriformis muscle.")
    print("   - If this action reproduces her specific sciatica-like pain, it strongly supports the diagnosis of Piriformis Syndrome.")
    print("\nConclusion: The action that will confirm the diagnosis by specifically targeting the piriformis muscle is resisted external rotation.")
