    This function solves the mathematical problem posed by the user by explaining the logical steps.

    The problem asks for the number of distinct homeomorphism classes for a compact connected metric space X,

    # Step 1: Analyze the condition on C_n(X).
    # The connectivity of the configuration space C_n(X) depends on the topology of X.

    # Step 2: Consider the case where X is an arc (homeomorphic to [0,1]).
    # If X is an arc, it has a total ordering. For any n points {x_1, ..., x_n},
    # they can be uniquely ordered, e.g., y_1 < y_2 < ... < y_n.
    # The set C_n(X) is partitioned based on the permutation that orders the coordinates.
    # For example, in C_2(X), the set {(x_1, x_2) | x_1 < x_2} and {(x_1, x_2) | x_2 < x_1}
    # are two disjoint open sets whose union is C_2(X).
    # One cannot create a continuous path from a pair (a, b) with a < b to a pair (c, d) with d < c
    # without the points colliding at some point (by the Intermediate Value Theorem).
    # So, if X is an arc, C_n(X) is disconnected for all n >= 2.
    # This means the class of arcs is a candidate.

    # Step 3: Consider the case where X is not an arc.
    # A key theorem in topology states that for a compact connected metric space X,
    # the configuration space C_2(X) is disconnected IF AND ONLY IF X is an arc.
    # The argument can be extended: if X is not an arc, C_n(X) is connected for ALL n >= 2.
    # This is because a space that is not an arc has enough "branching" or "loops"
    # to allow points to maneuver around each other without collision. For example, a circle
    # or a Y-shaped space (triod). Any compact connected metric space which is not an arc
    # is known to contain a copy of a circle or a triod.

    # Step 4: Conclude the equivalence.
    # The condition "C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2" is therefore equivalent to
    # the condition that X is an arc.

    # Step 5: Count the homeomorphism classes.
    # The question is now "How many distinct homeomorphism classes of arcs are there?".
    # By definition, an arc is a space homeomorphic to the interval [0,1].
    # Homeomorphism is an equivalence relation. All spaces homeomorphic to [0,1]
    # belong to the same class.
    # Therefore, there is only one such homeomorphism class.

    explanation = f"""
    The problem is to find the number of homeomorphism classes of compact connected metric spaces X for which the n-th configuration space, C_n(X), is disconnected for some n >= 2.

    1.  If X is an arc (a space homeomorphic to [0, 1]), it has a natural ordering. This ordering partitions the configuration space C_n(X) into n! components based on the permutation of the coordinates. For example, for n=2, the components are {{(x,y) | x<y}} and {{(x,y) | y<x}}. A continuous path cannot move between these components without points colliding. Thus, for an arc, C_n(X) is disconnected for all n >= 2.

    2.  A fundamental theorem in topology states that for a compact connected metric space X, C_n(X) is disconnected for some n >= 2 if and only if X is an arc. If X is not an arc, it contains structures like loops or junctions (e.g., a circle or a triod) that allow points to be navigated around each other, keeping the configuration space C_n(X) connected for all n >= 2.

    3.  Therefore, the spaces satisfying the given condition are precisely the arcs.

    4.  All arcs are, by definition, homeomorphic to the standard interval [0, 1]. This means they all belong to a single homeomorphism class.

    The final equation is simply stating this result.
    Number of classes = 1.
