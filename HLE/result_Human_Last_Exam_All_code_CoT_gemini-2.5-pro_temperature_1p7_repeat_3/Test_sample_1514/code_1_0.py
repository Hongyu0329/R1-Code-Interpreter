# This problem is a question from point-set topology, specifically continuum theory.
# The solution relies on a classical theorem rather than a direct computation.

# Problem statement: Find the smallest number of topologically distinct compactifications
# of the ray with remainder X, where X is an arbitrary nondegenerate,
# locally-connected, compact metric space.

# Step 1: Identify the nature of the space X.
# A space that is compact, metric, connected, and locally-connected is called a
# Peano continuum. The space X fits this description (it must be connected
# for the total space Y to be compact). "Nondegenerate" means it has more than one point.

# Step 2: Apply Whyburn's Theorem.
# A theorem by G. T. Whyburn states that the number of distinct compactifications
# of a ray with a Peano continuum X as the remainder is equal to the number
# of "cyclic elements" of X.

# Step 3: Understand cyclic elements.
# The cyclic elements are the basic "cyclic" building blocks of the space.
# - For a simple line segment X = [0,1], every point is a cyclic element, so there are
#   infinitely many.
# - For a figure-eight space, there are 3 cyclic elements (the two loops and the
#   junction point).
# - For a circle X = S^1, the entire space is a single indivisible cyclic unit.
#   It has no cut points. Thus, it has exactly 1 cyclic element.

# Step 4: Minimize the number of cyclic elements.
# The question asks for the smallest possible number of compactifications over all
# possible choices of X. This means we need to find the minimum number of cyclic
# elements a nondegenerate Peano continuum can have.

# A space must have at least one cyclic element.
# The minimum number is therefore 1.

# Step 5: Find a space X that achieves this minimum.
# A space with exactly one cyclic element is one that has no cut points (a "cyclic
# continuum"). The circle, S^1, is a perfect example. It satisfies all the
# conditions for X: it is a nondegenerate, locally-connected, compact metric space.
# For X = S^1, the number of cyclic elements is 1.

# Conclusion:
# The minimum number of cyclic elements is 1.
# By Whyburn's theorem, the smallest number of topologically distinct
# compactifications is therefore 1.

smallest_number_of_compactifications = 1

# Final Answer Output
print(smallest_number_of_compactifications)
