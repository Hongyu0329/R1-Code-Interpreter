    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step derivation of the equilibrium values for mean energy and entropy for a photon gas, followed by a Python script to calculate them.\n\n### Plan and Derivation\n\nOur goal is to find the equilibrium mean energy `U` and entropy `S` for a system of light quanta (photons). In statistical mechanics, equilibrium corresponds to the macroscopic state with the maximum number of associated microscopic configurations, which is equivalent to maximizing the system's entropy. This principle is fundamentally linked to large deviation theory, particularly the Boltzmann-Sanov theorem, which states that the probability of observing a system in a particular macrostate is exponentially proportional to its entropy.\n\nHere are the steps to derive the final equations:\n\n**1. Entropy of a Bose Gas**\n\nPhotons are bosons, so we start with the statistical definition of entropy for bosons. For a set of energy levels `E_i`, each with `g_i` available states, the number of ways `W_i` to distribute `n_i` indistinguishable photons into these states is given by the Bose-Einstein counting formula:\n`W_i = (n_i + g_i - 1)! / (n_i! * (g_i - 1)!)`\n\nThe total number of microstates for the system is `W = Π W_i`, and the entropy is `S = k_B * ln(W)`. Using Stirling's approximation for large numbers (`ln(N!) ≈ N*ln(N) - N`), the entropy can be expressed as:\n`S/k_B = Σ [ (n_i + g_i)ln(n_i + g_i) - n_i*ln(n_i) - g_i*ln(g_i) ]`\n\n**2. Maximizing Entropy (Finding Equilibrium)**\n\nTo find the equilibrium distribution, we must maximize this entropy `S` subject to the constraint of a fixed total energy `U = Σ n_i * E_i`. Since photons can be created and destroyed (e.g., absorbed and emitted by the walls of a cavity), their total number `N` is not conserved. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers to maximize `S` with the energy constraint:\nMaximize: `(S/k_B) - β(Σ n_i * E_i)`\nwhere `β` is the Lagrange multiplier associated with energy (it will turn out that `β = 1 / (k_B * T)`).\n\nSolving `∂/∂n_i [ (S/k_B) - β(Σ n_j*E_j) ] = 0` for each `n_i` yields the famous **Bose-Einstein distribution** for the average number of photons per state (`n_i/g_i`) at energy `E_i`:\n`n_i / g_i = 1 / (exp(β*E_i) - 1)`\n\n**3. Calculating Mean Energy (U)**\n\nTo find the total mean energy `U`, we sum the energy of all photons. For a continuous spectrum of energies, we replace the sum with an integral and use the density of states `g(E)` for photons in a 3D volume `V`:\n`g(E)dE = (8πV / (h^3 * c^3)) * E^2 dE`\n\nThe total energy `U` is then:\n`U = ∫ E * (n(E)/g(E)) * g(E) dE = ∫₀^∞ E * [1 / (exp(βE) - 1)] * [(8πV / (h^3c^3)) * E^2] dE`\nSolving this definite integral gives the final formula for the mean energy, which is a version of the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n`U = (8π⁵V * (k_B*T)⁴) / (15h³c³)`\n\n**4. Calculating Entropy (S)**\n\nThe equilibrium entropy `S` can be found by substituting the equilibrium distribution back into the entropy formula and integrating. Alternatively, a more straightforward way is to use the thermodynamic relation involving the Helmholtz free energy `F`: `S = (U - F) / T`. The free energy is derived from the partition function `Z`, where `F = -k_B*T*ln(Z)`. For a photon gas, the partition function leads to the relation `F = -U/3`.\n\nSubstituting this into the entropy equation gives a simple relationship:\n`S = (U - (-U/3)) / T = (4U / 3) / T = 4U / 3T`\n\nUsing our result for `U`, we get the final expression for entropy:\n`S = (4/3T) * [(8π⁵V * (k_B*T)⁴) / (15h³c³)] = (32π⁵V * k_B⁴ * T³) / (45h³c³)`\n\nThe following Python code implements these final formulas to calculate `U` and `S` for a given temperature and volume.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef calculate_photon_gas_properties(T, V):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the equilibrium mean energy and entropy for a photon gas (Bose case)\n    based on large deviation principles and statistical mechanics.\n\n    Args:\n        T (float): Temperature in Kelvin (K).\n        V (float): Volume in cubic meters (m^3).\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants\n    h = 6.62607015e-34  # Planck's constant (J·s)\n    c = 2.99792458e8    # Speed of light (m/s)\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23   # Boltzmann constant (J/K)\n\n    print(f\"Calculating for Temperature T = {T} K and Volume V = {V} m^3\\n\")\n\n    # --- Mean Energy (U) Calculation ---\n    U_numerator = 8 * (np.pi**5) * V * ((k_B * T)**4)\n    U_denominator = 15 * (h**3) * (c**3)\n    U = U_numerator / U_denominator\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Mean Energy (U) ---\")\n    print(\"Equation: U = (8 * pi^5 * V * (k_B * T)^4) / (15 * h^3 * c^3)\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the values:\")\n    print(f\"U = (8 * {np.pi**5:.4f} * {V:.2e} * ({k_B:.4e} * {T:.1e})^4) / (15 * ({h:.4e})^3 * ({c:.4e})^3)\")\n    print(f\"Result: U = {U:.6e} Joules\\n\")\n\n    # --- Entropy (S) Calculation ---\n    S_numerator = 32 * (np.pi**5) * V * k_B * ((k_B * T)**3)\n    S_denominator = 45 * (h**3) * (c**3)\n    S = S_numerator / S_denominator\n\n    print(\"--- Equilibrium Entropy (S) ---\")\n    print(\"Equation: S = (32 * pi^5 * V * k_B^4 * T^3) / (45 * h^3 * c^3)\")\n    print(\"Plugging in the values:\")\n    print(f\"S = (32 * {np.pi**5:.4f} * {V:.2e} * {k_B:.4e} * ({k_B:.4e} * {T:.1e})^3) / (45 * ({h:.4e})^3 * ({c:.4e})^3)\")\n    print(f\"Result: S = {S:.6e} J/K\")\n    \n    # As a check, verify S = 4U / (3T)\n    # S_check = (4 * U) / (3 * T)\n    # print(f\"\\nVerification check: 4*U/(3*T) = {S_check:.6e} J/K (matches S)\")\n\n\n# Example Usage: Calculate for a 1 cm^3 cavity at 1500 K (like a furnace)\ntemperature = 1500.0  # Kelvin\nvolume = 1e-6       # 1 cm^3 = 1e-6 m^3\n\ncalculate_photon_gas_properties(temperature, volume)\n\nfinal_answer = \"The equilibrium values are given by the functions U(T,V) and S(T,V) derived and implemented in the code.\"\n<<<The equilibrium values are given by the functions U(T,V) and S(T,V) derived and implemented in the code.>>>\n```"
