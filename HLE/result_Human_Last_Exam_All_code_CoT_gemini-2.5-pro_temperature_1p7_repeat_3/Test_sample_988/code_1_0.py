    # Scientific background:
    # Abiotic stresses like high temperature disrupt cellular homeostasis and lead
    # to the overproduction of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).
    # The cell's first and most rapid line of defense against ROS is the
    # activation of enzymatic antioxidants. Key enzymes include Superoxide Dismutase (SOD),
    # which converts superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide, and Catalase (CAT) or
    # Peroxidases (POX), which then neutralize the hydrogen peroxide.
    # This enzymatic response is typically faster than the production or mobilization
    # of non-enzymatic antioxidants (like liposoluble or hydrosoluble compounds).

    High temperature exposure causes oxidative stress in Microcystis aeruginosa by increasing the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). To combat this immediate threat, the organism relies on its most rapid defense system. Scientific studies confirm that the initial response in cyanobacteria to such stress is the upregulation and activation of antioxidant enzymes. These enzymes, such as Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT), can quickly neutralize harmful ROS and protect cellular components from damage. Other responses, like changes in pigment or lipid-soluble antioxidant concentrations, typically occur over a longer timescale. Therefore, the enzymatic antioxidants are the first to be activated.
