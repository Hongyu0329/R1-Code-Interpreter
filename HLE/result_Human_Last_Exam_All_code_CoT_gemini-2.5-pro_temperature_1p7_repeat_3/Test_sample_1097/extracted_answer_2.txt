To prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution with the Banach Fixed-Point Theorem,
the appropriate set M should be defined as a complete metric space where the associated
integral operator is a contraction mapping from M to M.

The set M is:
M = { u in C([0, 1]) | u(0) = 0, u(1) = 0, and -0.125 <= u(x) <= 0 for all x in [0, 1] }
