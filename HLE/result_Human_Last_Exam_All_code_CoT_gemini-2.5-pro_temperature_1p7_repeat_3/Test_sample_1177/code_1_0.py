    # --- Legal Principle (from Sale of Goods Act, s. 19, Rule 2) ---
    # When a seller must do something to put specific goods in a deliverable state,
    # property (and risk) does not pass until:
    # 1. The thing is done.
    # 2. The buyer has notice that it has been done.

    # Step 1: Check if the goods were in a deliverable state at the time of the contract.
    print("1. On June 2, were the goods in a deliverable state?")
    print(f"   - No. The MacBook Pro required a screen replacement. The initial condition was: '{initial_condition}'.")
    print("   - Therefore, risk did not pass to the buyer (Luke) on June 2.")

    # Step 2: Apply the rule for goods that need work.
    print("2. Did the seller (Jake) fulfill the conditions to pass the risk later?")
    # Condition 1: Was the required work done?
    print("   - Condition A: Was the item put into a deliverable state?")
    print("     - Yes, Jake completed the screen replacement as promised.")
    # Condition 2: Was notice given to the buyer?
    print("   - Condition B: Was the buyer (Luke) notified?")
    print(f"     - Yes, Jake gave notice via text on June 5.")
    print("-" * 45)


    # Step 3: Determine the moment risk transferred.
    print("3. When did risk pass from seller to buyer?")
    print("   - Risk passed on June 5, when both conditions (repairs completed and notice given) were met.")

    print("   - This event occurred AFTER the risk had already passed to Luke on June 5.")
    print("-" * 45)

    # Step 5: Conclude and select the best answer.
