    This function simulates the game described by J.C.F. Gauss.

    The game involves:
    1. Generating a random number between 0 and 1 (simulating the needle throw).
    2. Adding these numbers until the sum is greater than 1.
    3. Recording the count of numbers needed.

    The function simulates this process many times and calculates the average
    of the recorded counts. This average is known to converge to Euler's number, e.
