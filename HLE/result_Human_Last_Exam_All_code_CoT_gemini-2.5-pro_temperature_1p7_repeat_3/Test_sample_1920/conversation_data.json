    "To find the number of primitive Dirichlet characters $\\chi$ of conductor $d=53599$ and order $6$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Conductor ($d$)**: The first step is to find the prime factorization of the conductor $d = 53599$. A Dirichlet character $\\chi$ with a square-free conductor $d = p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_r$ is primitive if and only if it can be expressed as a product $\\chi = \\chi_1 \\chi_2 \\cdots \\chi_r$, where each $\\chi_i$ is a non-trivial character modulo the prime factor $p_i$. A non-trivial character is one whose order is greater than 1.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Order ($k$)**: The order of the composite character $\\chi$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of the orders of its component characters: $\\text{ord}(\\chi) = \\text{lcm}(\\text{ord}(\\chi_1), \\text{ord}(\\chi_2), \\dots, \\text{ord}(\\chi_r))$. We are given that this order must be $k=6$.\n\n3.  **Counting Strategy**: For the lcm of the orders to be 6, the order of each component character $\\chi_i$ must be a divisor of 6. Since each $\\chi_i$ must be non-trivial, the possible orders for each component are $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$. The number of characters modulo a prime $p$ with a specific order $m$ (where $m$ divides $p-1$) is given by Euler's totient function, $\\phi(m)$.\n\n4.  **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: We will count the number of such characters using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n    *   First, we'll count the total number of combinations of characters $(\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_r)$ where each $\\text{ord}(\\chi_i)$ is in $\\{2, 3, 6\\}$.\n    *   Then, we will subtract the combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6. An lcm divides 6 if all component orders divide 6. An lcm is a proper divisor of 6 if it's 1, 2, or 3. Since characters are non-trivial, the lcm cannot be 1. So we subtract the cases where the lcm divides 2 and the cases where the lcm divides 3.\n    *   The lcm divides 2 if and only if all component orders are 2.\n    *   The lcm divides 3 if and only if all component orders are 3.\n    *   The final count will be:\n        (Total combinations with orders in $\\{2,3,6\\}$)\n        - (Combinations with orders in $\\{2\\}$)\n        - (Combinations with orders in $\\{3\\}$)\n\nThis plan is implemented in the following Python script.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef prime_factorize(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of prime factors of n.\"\"\"\n    factors = []\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        while temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors.append(d)\n            temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n       factors.append(temp_n)\n    return factors\n\ndef phi(n):\n    \"\"\"Computes Euler's totient function.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    result = n\n    p = 2\n    while p * p <= n:\n        if n % p == 0:\n            while n % p == 0:\n                n //= p\n            result -= result // p\n        p += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        result -= result // n\n    return result\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of a given conductor and order.\n    \"\"\"\n    d = 53599\n    k = 6\n\n    print(f\"Finding the number of primitive Dirichlet characters of conductor d = {d} and order k = {k}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Factorize the conductor\n    prime_factors = prime_factorize(d)\n    r = len(prime_factors)\n    print(f\"Step 1: The conductor d = {d} is a product of r = {r} distinct primes:\")\n    print(f\"d = {' * '.join(map(str, prime_factors))}\\n\")\n    print(\"For the character to be primitive, it must be a product of non-trivial characters modulo each prime factor.\\n\")\n    \n    # Step 2: Set up the counting based on order k=6\n    print(\"Step 2: The order of the character is the lcm of the orders of its components.\")\n    print(\"For the order to be 6, the component orders must divide 6, i.e., belong to {2, 3, 6} (since they must be > 1).\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Use inclusion-exclusion\n    # First, count characters where component orders are in {2, 3, 6}\n    phi_2 = phi(2)\n    phi_3 = phi(3)\n    phi_6 = phi(6)\n    \n    print(\"Step 3: Count the number of choices for each component character.\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters of order 2: phi(2) = {phi_2}\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters of order 3: phi(3) = {phi_3}\")\n    print(f\"Number of characters of order 6: phi(6) = {phi_6}\\n\")\n\n    # Total combinations where order divides 6 (and > 1)\n    choices_per_comp_div_6 = phi_2 + phi_3 + phi_6\n    total_div_6 = choices_per_comp_div_6 ** r\n    \n    # Combinations where lcm divides 3 (all component orders must be 3)\n    choices_per_comp_div_3 = phi_3\n    total_div_3 = choices_per_comp_div_3 ** r\n\n    # Combinations where lcm divides 2 (all component orders must be 2)\n    choices_per_comp_div_2 = phi_2\n    total_div_2 = choices_per_comp_div_2 ** r\n\n    print(\"Step 4: Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\")\n    print(\"Total combinations with component orders dividing 6:\")\n    print(f\"({phi_2} + {phi_3} + {phi_6})^{r} = {choices_per_comp_div_6}^{r} = {total_div_6}\\n\")\n\n    print(\"Subtract combinations where the lcm is a proper divisor of 6.\")\n    print(\"Combinations with lcm dividing 3 (orders must be 3):\")\n    print(f\"({phi_3})^{r} = {choices_per_comp_div_3}^{r} = {total_div_3}\")\n    print(\"Combinations with lcm dividing 2 (orders must be 2):\")\n    print(f\"({phi_2})^{r} = {choices_per_comp_div_2}^{r} = {total_div_2}\\n\")\n\n    # Final result\n    result = total_div_6 - total_div_3 - total_div_2\n\n    print(\"Final Result:\")\n    print(\"The final count is obtained by the formula:\")\n    print(f\"N = ({phi_2} + {phi_3} + {phi_6})^{r} - ({phi_3})^{r} - ({phi_2})^{r}\")\n    print(f\"N = ({choices_per_comp_div_6})^{r} - ({choices_per_comp_div_3})^{r} - ({choices_per_comp_div_2})^{r}\")\n    print(f\"N = {total_div_6} - {total_div_3} - {total_div_2}\")\n    print(f\"N = {result}\")\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<608>>>"
