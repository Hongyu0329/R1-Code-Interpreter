Subfunctionalization provides a more passive and potentially more frequent path to retaining duplicate genes. It does not require a rare, beneficial, 'gain-of-function' mutation. Instead, it works by 'locking in' both copies through complementary loss of non-essential subfunctions, a more probable scenario. This protects both gene copies from being lost, providing a stable platform for future evolution (which could even include later neofunctionalization).",
