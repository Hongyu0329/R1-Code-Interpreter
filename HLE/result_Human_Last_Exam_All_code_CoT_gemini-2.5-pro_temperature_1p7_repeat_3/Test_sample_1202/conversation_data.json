    "My plan is to analyze each of the provided options to determine which one best explains how duplicated genes are kept in the genome (retention) and how they evolve to be different from each other (divergence).\n\n1.  **Analyze Option A (Gene conversion):** I will evaluate if this process leads to divergence or its opposite.\n2.  **Analyze Option B (Pseudogenization):** I will check if this mechanism accounts for the functional retention of the duplicated gene.\n3.  **Analyze Option E (Adaptive radiation):** I will determine if this is a gene-level mechanism or a process at a different biological scale.\n4.  **Analyze Options C (Neofunctionalization) and D (Subfunctionalization):** These are the main accepted models. I will explain both and compare them to determine which is considered \"most likely.\" Subfunctionalization provides a powerful passive mechanism for retaining both copies by making them mutually essential, while neofunctionalization requires the rarer event of a new beneficial function evolving.\n5.  **Final Selection:** Based on the analysis, I will argue that subfunctionalization offers a more common path to initial retention, making it a very likely mechanism. I will then construct a Python script to present this step-by-step reasoning and output the final conclusion.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef solve_gene_duplication_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the possible fates of duplicate genes to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    options = {\n        'A': 'Gene conversion',\n        'B': 'Pseudogenization',\n        'C': 'Neofunctionalization',\n        'D': 'Subfunctionalization',\n        'E': 'Adaptive radiation'\n    }\n\n    print(\"Analyzing the mechanisms responsible for retention and divergence of duplicate genes:\\n\")\n\n    # Explanation of incorrect options\n    print(f\"--- Analysis of Incorrect Options ---\")\n    print(f\"A. {options['A']}: This process makes homologous DNA sequences identical.
