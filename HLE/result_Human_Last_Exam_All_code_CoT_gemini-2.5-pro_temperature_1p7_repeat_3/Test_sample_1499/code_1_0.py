# The Old Church Slavonic grammatical pattern shows different conjugations of the verb "to be" (бꙑти).
# The task is to find the form for the 3rd person plural, imperative.
# In Old Church Slavonic, the 3rd person imperative is often expressed using the 3rd person plural of the future tense.
# The future tense stem, as seen in "бѫдѫ" and "бѫдєть", is "бѫд-".
# The standard ending for the 3rd person plural for this verb class is "-ѧтъ".
# Combining the stem and the ending gives the form "бѫдѧтъ".

# This form means "they will be" and is used for the command "let them be".
