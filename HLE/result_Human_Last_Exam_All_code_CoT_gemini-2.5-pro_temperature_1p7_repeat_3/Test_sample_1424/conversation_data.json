    "In the Feynman path integral formalism, and more generally in many-body quantum mechanics, the bare (or non-interacting) Green's function, $G_0$, describes the propagation of a single particle without any interactions with other particles. When represented in the frequency-momentum $(\\omega, k)$ domain, its dependence on the single-particle energy eigenvalue, $\\epsilon_k$, is straightforward.\n\nThe functional form is given by:\n\n$G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}$\n\nHere:\n*   $G_0(k, \\omega)$ is the bare Green's function.\n*   $\\omega$ is the frequency (often related to energy by $E = \\hbar\\omega$).\n*   $\\epsilon_k$ is the energy eigenvalue of a single, non-interacting particle in state $k$.\n*   $i\\eta$ is an infinitesimally small imaginary term (with $\\eta \\to 0^+$) that enforces causality, ensuring that the particle propagates forward in time. Its sign determines the specific type of Green's function (e.g., retarded, advanced, or Feynman).\n\nThe crucial part of this relationship is that the Green's function has a **pole**, meaning it diverges, when the frequency $\\omega$ is equal to the particle's energy eigenvalue $\\epsilon_k$. This divergence corresponds to a physical, on-shell particle.\n\nThe following Python script calculates an example value for the bare Green's function, demonstrating this dependence. It uses the `cmath` library to handle the complex number arithmetic required by the $i\\eta$ term.\n\n```python\nimport cmath\n\ndef get_bare_greens_function(omega, epsilon_k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the bare Green's function G_0 for a given frequency and energy.\n\n    The formula is G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη), where η is an\n    infinitesimal positive constant.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define an infinitesimally small positive constant for eta\n    eta = 1e-9\n\n    # Calculate the bare Green's function\n    # The term 1j is the Python representation for the imaginary unit i\n    G0 = 1 / (omega - epsilon_k + 1j * eta)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final equation with all numbers\n    print(\"The bare Green's function G_0 is calculated using the formula:\")\n    print(\"G_0(k, ω) = 1 / (ω - ϵ_k + iη)\\n\")\n    print(\"For the given values:\")\n    print(f\"ω = {omega}\")\n    print(f\"ϵ_k = {epsilon_k}\")\n    print(f\"η = {eta}\\n\")\n    print(\"The final equation is:\")\n    # Using .real and .imag for a clearer representation of the complex number result\n    print(f\"G_0 = 1 / ({omega} - {epsilon_k} + {eta}i) = {G0.real:.4f} + {G0.imag:.4f}i\")\n\n# --- Example ---\n# Set example values for the frequency (ω) and the single-particle energy (ϵ_k)\nfrequency_omega = 3.5\nenergy_epsilon_k = 3.2\n\n# Run the calculation and print the result\nget_bare_greens_function(frequency_omega, energy_epsilon_k)\n```\n<<<G_0(k, \\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\omega - \\epsilon_k + i\\eta}>>>"
