def solve():
    # The user provides the problem statement, which includes a variable 'd'.
    # I need to parse the question or find 'd' if it was given.
    # The problem is a theoretical graph theory question, not a data processing one.
    # So I will explain the reasoning and compute the result based on the variable 'd'.
    # The question is:
    # "Let G be an undirected graph. ... Their degrees are d, d+1, d+1 respectively, where d is even.
    # ... What is the minimal number of new edges one can add to G' to make it 2-edge-connected?"

    # The reasoning, as outlined above, leads to a formula based on d.
    # The even-degree vertex v1 (degree d) can be "split" into d/2 edges among its neighbors,
    # preserving the 2-edge-connectivity of the rest of the graph. This accounts for d/2 edges.
    # The two odd-degree vertices v2 and v3 (degree d+1) create a pair of "deficiencies".
    # Correcting a single pair of deficiencies requires one edge.
    # So, the minimal number of edges to add is d/2 + 1.

    # The problem doesn't give a specific value for d, it states 'd is even'.
    # So the answer is a formula in terms of d.
    # The request format asks for Python code to be executed.
    # I can write a Python function that takes 'd' as an input and prints the result.
    # Since 'd' is not specified, I will write an example for a specific even 'd'.
    # Or, I can output the formula as a string.
    # The instructions say "Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!"
    # This implies I should show the calculation.

    d_as_string = "d"

    # We need to present this as a calculation.
    # The calculation is d/2 + 1
    # For example if d = 10
    d = 10
    if d % 2 != 0:
        print("Error: d must be an even number.", file=sys.stderr)
        return

    result = d // 2 + 1

    print("The reasoning for the solution is as follows:")
    print("1. The graph G has edge connectivity 2. We remove three vertices v1, v2, v3 with degrees d, d+1, d+1, where d is even.")
    print("2. The vertex v1 has an even degree, d. Using Mader's splitting lemma, we can replace v1 with d/2 edges among its neighbors while preserving the 2-edge-connectivity of the remaining graph. This requires adding d/2 edges to G'.")
    print("3. The vertices v2 and v3 have odd degrees, d+1. Removing two vertices with odd degrees from a 2-edge-connected graph creates a pair of 'deficiencies'. To resolve this pair of deficiencies and restore 2-edge-connectivity, a minimum of 1 additional edge is required.")
    print("4. Therefore, the minimal total number of edges to add to G' is the sum of these two amounts.")
    print("\nCalculation:")
    print(f"Number of edges for v1 (degree {d}) = {d} / 2 = {d//2}")
    print(f"Number of edges for v2 and v3 (odd degrees) = 1")
    print(f"Total minimal edges = ({d} / 2) + 1 = {d//2} + 1 = {result}")

    # The final output is just the number. But the prompt asks to print each number in the equation.
    # So the python code should be self-contained and print the explanation and result.
