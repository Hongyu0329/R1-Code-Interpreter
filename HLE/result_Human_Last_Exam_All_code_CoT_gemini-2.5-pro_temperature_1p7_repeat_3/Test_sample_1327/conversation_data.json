    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the problem:\n1.  **Analyze the relationship between consecutive numbers.** We will try to find a formula that connects each number `n` to the previous one. A common pattern is `n_i = k * n_(i-1) + C`, where `k` and `C` might be constants or follow a pattern themselves.\n2.  **Establish the primary pattern.** Let's test the formula `n_(i+1) = 2 * n_i + a_i`.\n    *   For the second term: `11 = 2 * 2 + a_1` => `a_1 = 7`.\n    *   For the third term: `23 = 2 * 11 + a_2` => `a_2 = 1`.\n    *   For the fourth term: `51 = 2 * 23 + a_3` => `a_3 = 5`.\n    *   For the fifth term: `119 = 2 * 51 + a_4` => `a_4 = 17`.\n    *   This gives us a new sequence of added numbers: `a = [7, 1, 5, 17, ...]`. The next number in the original sequence will be `2 * 119 + a_5`.\n3.  **Find the pattern in the new sequence `a`.** Let's look at the differences between consecutive terms in `a`. It is common for a pattern to stabilize after the first term, so we will focus on the sub-sequence `[1, 5, 17]`.\n    *   First difference: `5 - 1 = 4`.\n    *   Second difference: `17 - 5 = 12`.\n4.  **Identify the secondary pattern.** The differences `[4, 12]` form a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3 (`4 * 3 = 12`).\n5.  **Predict the next terms.**\n    *   The next difference will be `12 * 3 = 36`.\n    *   The next term in the sequence `a` will be `17 + 36 = 53`.\n6.  **Calculate the final answer.** Now we can find the missing number in the original sequence:\n    *   Next Number = `2 * 119 + 53`.\n    *   `2 * 119 = 238`.\n    *   `238 + 53 = 291`.\n\n```python\n# The sequence of numbers\nn = [2, 11, 23, 51, 119]\n\n# Step 1: Establish the primary pattern: n_i+1 = 2 * n_i + a_i\n# We calculate the sequence 'a'\na = []\nfor i in range(len(n) - 1):\n    a_i = n[i+1] - 2 * n[i]\n    a.append(a_i)\n    # print(f\"{n[i+1]} = 2 * {n[i]} + {a_i}\")\n\n# The calculated sequence 'a' is [7, 1, 5, 17]\n\n# Step 2: Find the pattern in the sub-sequence of 'a' starting from the second term: [1, 5, 17]\n# We calculate the differences between its terms\ndiff1 = a[2] - a[1]  # 5 - 1\ndiff2 = a[3] - a[2]  # 17 - 5\n# print(f\"The differences are {diff1} and {diff2}.\")\n\n# Step 3: Identify the pattern in the differences [4, 12]\n# It's a geometric progression with a ratio of 3.\nratio = diff2 // diff1\n# print(f\"The ratio is {ratio}.\")\n\n# Step 4: Predict the next difference and the next term in 'a'\nnext_diff = diff2 * ratio\nnext_a = a[-1] + next_diff\n# print(f\"The next term in sequence 'a' is {a[-1]} + {next_diff} = {next_a}\")\n\n# Step 5: Calculate the final missing number in the original sequence\nlast_known_n = n[-1]\nfinal_result = 2 * last_known_n + next_a\n\n# Print the final calculation and the answer\nprint(f\"The pattern is that each number is twice the previous number plus an increasing value.\")\nprint(f\"The values being added are determined by a sub-pattern.\")\nprint(f\"The next value to be added is {next_a}.\")\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final equation is:\")\nprint(f\"2 * {last_known_n} + {next_a} = {final_result}\")\n<<<A>>>\n```"
