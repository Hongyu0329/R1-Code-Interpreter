    "Of course, I can help with that. My plan is to compute the determinant of the provided 3x3 matrix. I will write a Python script that first defines the matrix. Then, following the standard formula for a 3x3 determinant (cofactor expansion), the script will break down the calculation step by step. It will print out each part of the formula with the corresponding numbers from the matrix, showing how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef compute_determinant():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the determinant of the given 3x3 matrix and shows the calculation steps.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The adjacency matrix of the Markov quiver is given as:\n    # A = [[2, -1, -1], [-1, 2, -1], [-1, -1, 2]]\n    # Note: The context of the \"Markov quiver for m_1/2 = 13\" is extra information.\n    # The core task is to compute the determinant of the explicitly provided matrix A.\n    \n    A = np.array([\n        [2, -1, -1],\n        [-1, 2, -1],\n        [-1, -1, 2]\n    ])\n\n    # For a 3x3 matrix [[a, b, c], [d, e, f], [g, h, i]], the determinant is\n    # calculated using the formula: a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).\n    \n    # Extract elements from the matrix\n    a, b, c = A[0, 0], A[0, 1], A[0, 2]\n    d, e, f = A[1, 0], A[1, 1], A[1, 2]\n    g, h, i = A[2, 0], A[2, 1], A[2, 2]\n\n    # Calculate each term of the expansion\n    term1 = a * (e * i - f * h)\n    term2 = -b * (d * i - f * g)\n    term3 = c * (d * h - e * g)\n    \n    # Sum the terms to get the final determinant\n    determinant = term1 + term2 + term3\n\n    print(\"The matrix A is:\")\n    print(A)\n    print(\"\\nThe determinant is computed using the cofactor expansion formula:\")\n    print(\"det(A) = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Substitute the values from matrix A into the formula.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}(({e})*({i}) - ({f})*({h})) - ({b})(({d})*({i}) - ({f})*({g})) + ({c})(({d})*({h}) - ({e})*({g}))\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate the values inside the parentheses (the 2x2 sub-determinants).\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {a}({e*i - f*h}) - ({b})({d*i - f*g}) + ({c})({d*h - e*g})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Perform the multiplications.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = ({term1}) + ({term2}) + ({term3})\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the final sum.\")\n    print(f\"det(A) = {determinant}\")\n\ncompute_determinant()\n```\n<<<0>>>"
