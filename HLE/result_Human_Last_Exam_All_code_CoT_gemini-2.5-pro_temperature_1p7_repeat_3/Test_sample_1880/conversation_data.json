    "To compute the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility**: First, I'll determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. An irreducible polynomial's Galois group acts transitively on its roots. I will use Eisenstein's criterion for this.\n2.  **Compute the Discriminant ($\\Delta$)**: The discriminant of the polynomial provides key information. If $\\Delta$ is a perfect square in $\\mathbb{Q}$, the Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$. Otherwise, it is not.\n3.  **Form the Resolvent Cubic**: For a quartic polynomial, the resolvent cubic is a related third-degree polynomial whose reducibility over $\\mathbb{Q}$ helps classify the Galois group. For a depressed quartic $x^4+px+q$, the resolvent is $t^3 - 4qt - p^2$.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic**: I'll check if the resolvent cubic has any rational roots.\n    *   If it's irreducible, the Galois group is $S_4$ or $A_4$.\n    *   If it's reducible, the group is smaller ($D_4$, $V_4$, or $C_4$).\n5.  **Distinguish between Subgroups**: Based on the results of the discriminant and the resolvent cubic's factorization, I will pinpoint the exact Galois group.\n    *   If the resolvent is reducible, we must distinguish between $D_4$ and $C_4$. A specific criterion involving the discriminant of the quartic and the discriminant of the quadratic factor of the resolvent will be used.\n6.  **State the Order**: Once the group is identified, its order is known.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the necessary values and determine the group's order.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_perfect_square(n):\n    \"\"\"Checks if a non-negative integer is a perfect square.\"\"\"\n    if n < 0:\n        return False, None\n    x = int(math.sqrt(n))\n    if x * x == n:\n        return True, x\n    return False, math.sqrt(n)\n\ndef compute_galois_group_order_quartic():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for the polynomial x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    # This is a depressed quartic of the form x^4 + px + q.\n    p = 8\n    q = 14\n    \n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {p}x + {q}\\n\")\n\n    # Step 1: Check irreducibility using Eisenstein's criterion\n    print(\"Step 1: Check Irreducibility\")\n    print(\"Using Eisenstein's criterion with the prime 2:\")\n    print(\" - The prime 2 divides the coefficients 8 and 14.\")\n    print(\" - The prime's square, 4, does not divide the constant term 14.\")\n    print(\" - The prime 2 does not divide the leading coefficient 1.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers Q.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Compute the discriminant of the quartic\n    print(\"Step 2: Compute the Discriminant (Delta)\")\n    print(f\"The discriminant for x^4 + px + q is given by Delta = -27*p^4 + 256*q^3.\")\n    print(f\"For p={p} and q={q}, the equation is:\")\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * ({p}^4) + 256 * ({q}^3)\")\n    p_4 = p**4\n    q_3 = q**3\n    term1 = -27 * p_4\n    term2 = 256 * q_3\n    discriminant = term1 + term2\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {p_4} + 256 * {q_3}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {term1} + {term2}\")\n    print(f\"Delta = {discriminant}\")\n\n    is_sq, _ = is_perfect_square(discriminant)\n    if is_sq:\n        print(\"The discriminant is a perfect square.
