    "To compute the continued fraction associated with the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$, we first need to define this number. In the context of Diophantine approximation and the Lagrange spectrum, the number $m_{p/q}$ for a rational number $p/q$ is interpreted as the Lagrange number of a specially constructed quadratic irrationality.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Find the continued fraction of the rational number** $r = 4/7$.\n    Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n    $7 = 1 \\cdot 4 + 3$\n    $4 = 1 \\cdot 3 + 1$\n    $3 = 3 \\cdot 1 + 0$\n    The coefficients are $[1, 1, 3]$. Since $4/7 < 1$, its continued fraction is $[0; 1, 1, 3]$.\n\n2.  **Construct the associated quadratic irrationality**.\n    Given $r = [0; a_1, \\dots, a_n]$, a common construction for the associated quadratic irrational number is one whose continued fraction has a purely periodic palindromic part: $\\theta_{p/q} = [0; \\overline{a_1, \\dots, a_n, a_n, \\dots, a_1}]$.\n    For $r=4/7$, the sequence of coefficients is $(1, 1, 3)$, so the periodic part for $\\theta_{4/7}$ is $(1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1)$. Thus, $\\theta_{4/7} = [0; \\overline{1, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1}]$.\n\n3.  **Find the quadratic equation for this number and its Lagrange number**.\n    The number $\\theta_{4/7}$ is a root of the quadratic equation $5x^2 + 6x - 5 = 0$. For a quadratic irrational root of $Cx^2+Bx+A=0$, the Lagrange number is given by $\\sqrt{B^2-4AC}/|C|$.\n    For our equation, this value is:\n    $\\sqrt{6^2 - 4(5)(-5)} / |5| = \\sqrt{36 + 100} / 5 = \\sqrt{136} / 5$.\n    This number, $\\sqrt{136}/5$ (which is $2\\sqrt{34}/5$), is the generalized Markov number $m_{4/7}$.\n\n4.  **Compute the continued fraction of $m_{4/7} = \\sqrt{136}/5$**.\n    We can use a standard algorithm to find the continued fraction of a quadratic irrational number. This is implemented in the Python code below.\n\nThe following Python script carries out the computation for the continued fraction of $\\sqrt{136}/5$ and prints the result in the requested format.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef compute_generalized_markov_cf(p, q):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the continued fraction of the generalized Markov number m_{p/q}.\n    The process is:\n    1.
