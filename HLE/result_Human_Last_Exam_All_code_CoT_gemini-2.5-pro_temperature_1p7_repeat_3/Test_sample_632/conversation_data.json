    "My plan is to answer the user's historical question about the Piazza della Rotonda. The question asks to identify a unique architectural feature that was removed. Based on historical records, the most famous feature removed from the Pantheon, which dominates the square, was a pair of bell towers. Although the removal date provided by the user (1950) is historically inaccurate (they were removed in the late 19th century), this feature is almost certainly the intended answer.\n\nTo meet the user's request for a code-based solution, I will write a Python script. This script will store the information about the bell towers in variables and then use the `print()` function to display the full answer.\n\n```python\ndef solve_pantheon_mystery():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides information about the architectural feature\n    removed from the Pantheon in the Piazza della Rotonda.\n    \"\"\"\n    feature = \"a pair of bell towers\"\n    location = \"the Pantheon\"\n    nickname = \"'the ass's ears' (le orecchie d'asino)\"\n    removal_period = \"the late 19th century\"\n\n    print(f\"The unique architectural feature that once stood in the Piazza della Rotonda was {feature}.\")\n    print(f\"These towers were added to the facade of {location} in the 17th century and were derisively nicknamed {nickname} by the Romans.\")\n    print(f\"Despite the user's date of 1950, they were actually removed in {removal_period}.\")\n\nsolve_pantheon_mystery()\n```\n<<<A pair of bell towers on the Pantheon, nicknamed 'the ass's ears'.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.
