    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **State the Theoretical Framework:** I will begin by identifying the relevant physical theory, which is the `ϕ⁴` scalar field theory, and the mathematical tool used to study it, which is the Renormalization Group (RG).\n2.  **Introduce the Beta Function:** The core of the RG analysis is the beta function, `β(u)`, which describes how the coupling constant `u` changes with the energy scale. I will state the one-loop expression for the beta function of the `ϕ⁴` theory in `d = 4 - ϵ` dimensions.\n3.  **Define and Find the Fixed Point:** A fixed point, `u*`, represents a scale-invariant point of the theory, where `β(u*) = 0`. I will set up this equation.\n4.  **Solve for the Leading Order Expression:** By solving the equation from the previous step, I will derive the expression for the non-trivial fixed point (known as the Wilson-Fisher fixed point). This expression will be in terms of `ϵ`, and since we are using the one-loop beta function, the result will naturally be the leading order expression in `ϵ`.\n5.  **Construct the Python Code:** Finally, I will write a Python script that programmatically presents these steps and prints the final expression for `u*`, ensuring that each component of the formula is explicitly shown as requested.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_fixed_point_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives and prints the leading order expression for the \n    Wilson-Fisher fixed point coupling u* in phi^4 theory near four dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    print(\"This script derives the leading order expression for the fixed point coupling u* in ϕ⁴ theory.\")\n    print(\"The method used is the Renormalization Group in d = 4 - ϵ dimensions.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\n    # Step 1: The beta function\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: State the one-loop beta function\")\n    print(\"The beta function, β(u), describes the running of the dimensionless coupling 'u' with the energy scale.\")\n    print(\"In d = 4 - ϵ dimensions, the one-loop beta function for ϕ⁴ theory is:\")\n    print(\"β(u) = -ϵ*u + (3 / (16 * π²)) * u²\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: The fixed point condition\n    print(\"Step 2: Find the fixed point u* by setting the beta function to zero\")\n    print(\"A fixed point is a scale-invariant point where β(u*) = 0.
