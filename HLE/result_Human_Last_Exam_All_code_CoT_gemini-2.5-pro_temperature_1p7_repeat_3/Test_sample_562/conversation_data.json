    "My plan to identify the radical (bushu) of the character 謄 is as follows:\n1.  I will first decompose the character 謄 into its constituent parts to identify the radical.\n2.  The character 謄 is composed of two main parts, a left component and a right component. The left component is 言. This is a common radical.\n3.  I will verify that 言 is indeed the indexed radical for this character using standard kanji dictionaries. It is radical number 149.\n4.  The name of the radical depends on its position. When the radical 言 (\"word\") is on the left side of a character (a position known as \"hen\"), it is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん).\n5.  Finally, I will provide the Hepburn romanization of \"gonben\", which is \"Gonben\", as the answer, similar to the example \"Onnahen\" for the character 媛.\n\n```python\ndef find_radical_name():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the radical for the kanji 謄 and prints its name in Hepburn romanization.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The character is 謄.\n    # The radical is the left-side component: 言.\n    # When the radical 言 (word) is on the left side (hen), its name is ごんべん.\n    # The Hepburn romanization for ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n    radical_name = \"Gonben\"\n    print(radical_name)\n\nfind_radical_name()\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
