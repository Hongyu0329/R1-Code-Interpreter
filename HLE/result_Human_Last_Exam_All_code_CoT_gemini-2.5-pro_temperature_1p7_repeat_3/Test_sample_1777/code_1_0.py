# Define the given physical parameters
Eg = 3.0  # Band gap in eV
E_1s = 1.0 # Resonance peak for the 1s exciton in eV
n = 3     # The principal quantum number for the target state

# Step 1: Calculate the binding energy of the 1s exciton (Eb_1s)
# The exciton resonance peak energy is E_n = Eg - Eb_n
Eb_1s = Eg - E_1s
print(f"The binding energy of the 1s exciton is Eb_1s = {Eg} eV - {E_1s} eV = {Eb_1s} eV.")

# Step 2: Calculate the effective Rydberg energy (Ry) for the 2D system
# The binding energy for a 2D exciton is given by Eb_n = Ry / (n - 0.5)^2
# For n=1, Eb_1s = Ry / (1 - 0.5)^2 = Ry / 0.25 = 4 * Ry
# Therefore, Ry = Eb_1s / 4
Ry = Eb_1s / 4.0
print(f"The effective Rydberg energy is Ry = {Eb_1s} eV / 4 = {Ry} eV.")

# Step 3: Calculate the Rydberg energy (binding energy) for n=3 (Eb_3)
# We use the 2D formula with n=3
denominator = (n - 0.5)**2
Eb_3 = Ry / denominator
print(f"The Rydberg energy for n={n} is calculated using the formula: Eb_n = Ry / (n - 0.5)^2")

# Print the final calculation showing all the numbers
print(f"Eb_3 = {Ry:.2f} eV / ({n} - 0.5)^2 = {Ry:.2f} eV / {denominator} = {Eb_3:.2f} eV")

# The final answer
final_answer = Eb_3
# print(f"The Rydberg energy for n = 3 is {final_answer:.2f} eV.")
