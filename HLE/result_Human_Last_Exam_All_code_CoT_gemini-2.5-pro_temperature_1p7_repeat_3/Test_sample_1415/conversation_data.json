    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Integral**: The expression to integrate is `F₃'(x)/F₃(x)`. This is a standard form. If we let `u = F₃(x)`, then `du = F₃'(x) dx`. The integral becomes `∫ (1/u) du`, whose antiderivative is `ln|u|`.\n2.  **Evaluate the Definite Integral**: The definite integral from 0 to 1 is `[ln|F₃(x)|]` from 0 to 1, which equals `ln|F₃(1)| - ln|F₃(0)|`.\n3.  **Determine `F₃(x)`**: We are given the sequence of functions:\n    *   `F₀(x) = x`\n    *   `F₁(x) = sin(F₀(x)) = sin(x)`\n    *   `F₂(x) = e^(F₁(x)) = e^(sin(x))`\n    *   `F₃(x) = ln(1 + F₂(x)) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))`\n4.  **Check for Absolute Value**: For `x` in the interval [0, 1], `sin(x)` is non-negative. Therefore, `e^(sin(x))` is greater than or equal to 1, and `1 + e^(sin(x))` is greater than 2. This means `F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))` is always positive on this interval, so we can drop the absolute value bars. The integral `V` is `ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))`.\n5.  **Calculate `F₃(1)` and `F₃(0)`**:\n    *   `F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))`\n    *   `F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = ln(1 + e^0) = ln(2)`\n6.  **Calculate Final Value `V`**: Substitute the values back into the expression for the definite integral: `V = ln(ln(1 + e^(sin(1)))) - ln(ln(2))`.\n7.  **Implement in Python**: Write a Python script to perform these calculations using the `math` library and find the closest integer to `10000 * V`.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the definite integral and calculates the final requested value.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) dx is ln(F₃(x)).\n    # We evaluate this from x=0 to x=1, which results in ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\n    \n    # Let's calculate the necessary components.\n    \n    # F₃(x) = ln(1 + e^(sin(x)))\n    \n    # Calculate F₃(1)\n    sin_1 = math.sin(1)\n    exp_sin_1 = math.exp(sin_1)\n    F3_at_1 = math.log(1 + exp_sin_1)\n    \n    # Calculate F₃(0)\n    sin_0 = math.sin(0)\n    exp_sin_0 = math.exp(sin_0)\n    F3_at_0 = math.log(1 + exp_sin_0) # This simplifies to math.log(2)\n    \n    # Now, calculate the value of the integral V\n    # V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0))\n    ln_F3_1 = math.log(F3_at_1)\n    ln_F3_0 = math.log(F3_at_0)\n    V = ln_F3_1 - ln_F3_0\n    \n    # Calculate the final requested value\n    result = 10000 * V\n    closest_integer = round(result)\n    \n    # Print the step-by-step breakdown as requested\n    print(\"The definite integral of F₃'(x)/F₃(x) from 0 to 1 is V = ln(F₃(1)) - ln(F₃(0)).\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Calculate F₃(1) and F₃(0)\")\n    print(f\"F₃(1) = ln(1 + e^(sin(1))) = {F3_at_1}\")\n    print(f\"F₃(0) = ln(1 + e^(sin(0))) = {F3_at_0}\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Calculate V\")\n    print(f\"ln(F₃(1)) = ln({F3_at_1}) = {ln_F3_1}\")\n    print(f\"ln(F₃(0)) = ln({F3_at_0}) = {ln_F3_0}\")\n    print(f\"V = {ln_F3_1} - ({ln_F3_0}) = {V}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Calculate the final result\")\n    print(f\"10000 * V = 10000 * {V} = {result}\")\n    print(f\"The closest integer to 10000 * V is {closest_integer}.\")\n\nsolve_integral()\n<<<5489>>>\n```"
