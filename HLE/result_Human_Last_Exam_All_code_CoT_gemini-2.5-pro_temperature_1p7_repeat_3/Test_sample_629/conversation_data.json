    "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of unique minimal grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot, considering translations and rotations as equivalences.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Basics\n\n*   **Knot and Grid Diagram:** A knot can be represented on an `n x n` grid. A grid diagram is defined by the positions of 'X' and 'O' markings, where each row and column has exactly one 'X' and one 'O'. These markings correspond to crossings in the knot projection. By convention, vertical lines cross over horizontal lines at 'X's, and horizontal lines cross over vertical lines at 'O's.\n*   **Minimal Grid Number:** The smallest grid size `n` for a given knot. For the trefoil knot (both left-handed and right-handed), the minimal grid number is `n=3`.\n*   **Permutation Representation:** A grid diagram on an `n x n` grid can be represented by two permutations, `sigma_X` and `sigma_O`, of `{1, 2, ..., n}`. The 'X' markings are at coordinates `(i, sigma_X(i))` and 'O' markings at `(i, sigma_O(i))` for `i = 1 to n`.\n*   **Knot Invariant `pi`:** A key algebraic invariant of the knot represented by `(sigma_X, sigma_O)` is the permutation `pi = sigma_O * sigma_X^{-1}`. For `n=3`, if `pi` is a 3-cycle, the diagram represents a trefoil knot. The two 3-cycles in the permutation group `S_3`, which are `(1, 2, 3)` and `(1, 3, 2)`, correspond to the right-hand and left-hand trefoils. By convention, `pi = (1, 3, 2)` represents the left-hand trefoil (LHT).\n\n### Step 2: Find all minimal diagrams for the Left-Hand Trefoil\n\nWe need to find all pairs of permutations `(X, O)` from `S_3` such that `O * X^{-1} = (1, 3, 2)`. This is equivalent to `O = (1, 3, 2) * X`. There are `3! = 6` permutations in `S_3`, so we can list all 6 possible diagrams for the LHT.\n\nThe 6 permutations in `S_3` are: `e` (identity), `(1,2)`, `(1,3)`, `(2,3)`, `(1,2,3)`, `(1,3,2)`.\n\nLet's compute `O` for each `X`:\n1.  `X = e`: `O = (1,3,2) * e = (1,3,2)`\n2.  `X = (1,2)`: `O = (1,3,2) * (1,2) = (2,3)`\n3.  `X = (1,3)`: `O = (1,3,2) * (1,3) = (1,2)`\n4.  `X = (2,3)`: `O = (1,3,2) * (2,3) = (1,3)`\n5.  `X = (1,2,3)`: `O = (1,3,2) * (1,2,3) = e`\n6.  `X = (1,3,2)`: `O = (1,3,2) * (1,3,2) = (1,2,3)`\n\nSo, the 6 diagrams `(X, O)` for the left-hand trefoil are:\n*   `D1 = (e, (1,3,2))`\n*   `D2 = ((1,2), (2,3))`\n*   `D3 = ((1,3), (1,2))`\n*   `D4 = ((2,3), (1,3))`\n*   `D5 = ((1,2,3), e)`\n*   `D6 = ((1,3,2), (1,2,3))`\n\n### Step 3: Apply Equivalence Relations (Translation and Rotation)\n\nWe need to count how many distinct diagrams exist \"up to translation and rotation\".\n\n*   **Rotation:** A 90-degree or 180-degree rotation of the physical grid can be shown to change the knot invariant `pi` from `(1,3,2)` to its conjugate, which is `(1,2,3)`. This means that under the standard algebraic framework, rotation transforms a left-hand trefoil diagram into a right-hand trefoil diagram. Since the question asks specifically for diagrams of the *left-hand* trefoil, rotations cannot be used to establish equivalence between two different left-hand trefoil diagrams.\n\n*   **Translation:** Grid translation corresponds to cyclically shifting the rows and columns. In the permutation representation, this is equivalent to conjugating both `X` and `O` by the cycle `c = (1,2,3)`. The new diagram is `(c*X*c^{-1}, c*O*c^{-1})`. This transformation preserves the `pi` invariant `(O*X^{-1})`, so it maps an LHT diagram to another LHT diagram.\n\nWe must therefore find the number of orbits of our 6 diagrams under the action of translation.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Orbits under Translation\n\nLet the translation operator be `T(X, O) = (c*X*c^{-1}, c*O*c^{-1})` with `c=(1,2,3)`. We apply this operator to our 6 diagrams to see how they are grouped.\n\n*   **Orbit of D1:** `T(D1) = (c*e*c^{-1}, c*(1,3,2)*c^{-1}) = (e, (1,3,2)) = D1`.\n    `D1` is a fixed point, forming an orbit of size 1: `{D1}`.\n\n*   **Orbit of D2:** `T(D2) = (c*(1,2)*c^{-1}, c*(2,3)*c^{-1}) = ((2,3), (1,3)) = D4`.\n    `T(D4) = (c*(2,3)*c^{-1}, c*(1,3)*c^{-1}) = ((1,3), (1,2)) = D3`.\n    `T(D3) = (c*(1,3)*c^{-1}, c*(1,2)*c^{-1}) = ((1,2), (2,3)) = D2`.\n    These three diagrams form a single orbit of size 3: `{D2, D3, D4}`.\n\n*   **Orbit of D5:** `T(D5) = (c*(1,2,3)*c^{-1}, c*e*c^{-1}) = ((1,2,3), e) = D5`.\n    `D5` is a fixed point, forming an orbit of size 1: `{D5}`.\n\n*   **Orbit of D6:** `T(D6) = (c*(1,3,2)*c^{-1}, c*(1,2,3)*c^{-1}) = ((1,3,2), (1,2,3)) = D6`.\n    `D6` is a fixed point, forming an orbit of size 1: `{D6}`.\n\nThe orbits are: `{D1}`, `{D2, D3, D4}`, `{D5}`, and `{D6}`. There are 4 such orbits.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe number of distinct grid diagrams for the left-hand trefoil knot with minimal grid number up to translation is 4.\n\nThe following Python code systematically performs this calculation.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef perm_to_dict(p_tuple, n=3):\n    \"\"\"Converts a tuple representation of a permutation into a dictionary.\"\"\"\n    d = {i: i for i in range(1, n + 1)}\n    for cycle in p_tuple:\n        if len(cycle) > 1:\n            for i in range(len(cycle)):\n                d[cycle[i]] = cycle[(i + 1) % len(cycle)]\n    return d\n\ndef dict_to_tuple(p_dict, n=3):\n    \"\"\"Converts a dict representation of a permutation back to a tuple.\"\"\"\n    tuples = []\n    processed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if processed[i]:\n            continue\n        cycle = []\n        j = i\n        while not processed[j]:\n            processed[j] = True\n            cycle.append(j)\n            j = p_dict.get(j, j)\n            if j == i:\n                break\n        if len(cycle) > 1:\n            tuples.append(tuple(cycle))\n    # Sort for canonical representation\n    return tuple(sorted(tuples))\n\ndef multiply_perms(p2, p1):\n    \"\"\"Multiplies two permutations p2 * p1.
