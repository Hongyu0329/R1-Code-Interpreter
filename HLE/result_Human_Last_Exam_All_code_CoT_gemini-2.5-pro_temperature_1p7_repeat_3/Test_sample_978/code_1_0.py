    # A is wrong: Neighbours aren't liable; Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # B is wrong: Liability isn't pooled; they are two separate incidents.
    # C is wrong: Evergreen is liable for Lincoln's actions.
    # D is wrong: Minimal damage still attracts liability.

    #   to the employee and employer for each respective act of negligence.
