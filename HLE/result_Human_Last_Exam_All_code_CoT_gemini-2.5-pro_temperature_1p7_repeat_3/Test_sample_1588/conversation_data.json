    "Of course, I can help with that. The problem asks for the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion. This quantity is equivalent to the dimension of the degree 10 part of the free Lie algebra on two generators (X and Y).\n\nThis dimension can be calculated using Witt's formula:\n\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n*   `n` is the order, which is 10 in this case.\n*   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for X and Y).\n*   The sum is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n*   `μ` is the Möbius function.\n\nI will provide a Python script that calculates this value. The script will first define the necessary helper functions to find the divisors of a number and to compute the Möbius function. Then, it will apply Witt's formula for `n=10` and `k=2`, printing out each step of the calculation to show how the final result is obtained.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a dictionary of prime factors of num.\n    e.g., get_prime_factorization(12) -> {2: 2, 3: 1}\n    \"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while temp % d == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the Mobius function mu(n).\n    - mu(1) = 1\n    - mu(n) = 0 if n has a squared prime factor.\n    - mu(n) = (-1)^k if n is a product of k distinct primes.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input must be a positive integer\")\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    \n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n            \n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a sorted list of all divisors of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef calculate_bch_nonzero_coefficients():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of nonzero coefficients of order n in the\n    BCH expansion for k generators, following the problem's request.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10\n    k = 2\n\n    print(f\"To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order {n}, we use Witt's formula:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * sum over d|{n} [ mu(d) * k^(n/d) ]\\n\")\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    print(f\"The divisors 'd' of {n} are: {divisors}\\n\")\n\n    term_values = []\n    \n    # First, build and print the full formula with all numbers\n    full_formula_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        term_values.append(mu_d * (k**power))\n        full_formula_parts.append(f\"({mu_d} * {k}^{power})\")\n    \n    print(\"Step 1: Substitute the values into the formula.\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(full_formula_parts)} ]\")\n\n    # Second, print the formula with powers evaluated\n    evaluated_powers_parts = []\n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        evaluated_powers_parts.append(f\"({mu_d} * {k**power})\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Evaluate the powers.\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {' + '.join(evaluated_powers_parts)} ]\")\n    \n    # Third, print the formula with multiplications performed\n    multiplied_parts_str = \" + \".join(map(str, term_values)).replace('+ -', '- ')\n    \n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Perform the multiplications inside the brackets.\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {multiplied_parts_str} ]\")\n\n    # Fourth, print the formula with the sum calculated\n    total_sum = sum(term_values)\n    print(\"\\nStep 4: Calculate the sum inside the brackets.\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * [ {total_sum} ]\")\n    \n    # Finally, print the result\n    final_result = total_sum // n\n    print(\"\\nStep 5: Perform the final division to get the result.\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = {final_result}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    calculate_bch_nonzero_coefficients()\n\n```\n<<<99>>>"
