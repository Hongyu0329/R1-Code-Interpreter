The edges of the image become smoother, with convex corners eroding and concave corners filling in. This process is a form of geometric flow that simplifies shapes. Over an infinite number of iterations, any finite, closed shape will continuously shrink and ultimately disappear, causing its edges to vanish completely. The final image will become uniform (all black or all white).
