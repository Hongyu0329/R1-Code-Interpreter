  Calculates the number of broken generators for a plausible interpretation of the problem.

  The problem states the symmetry breaking is SU(3) -> SU(2) x U(1).
  A direct calculation gives:
  dim(SU(3)) = 8
  dim(SU(2) x U(1)) = dim(SU(2)) + dim(U(1)) = 3 + 1 = 4
  Broken generators = 8 - 4 = 4. This corresponds to option E.

  However, option B states "Five broken generators". This would arise from the breaking
  pattern SU(3) -> SU(2), as dim(SU(2)) = 3, and 8 - 3 = 5.
  Given that the number of broken generators is a fundamental description of vacuum
  degeneracy, it is highly likely that SU(3) -> SU(2) was the intended problem and
  the "x U(1)" was a typo. This script calculates the result for this interpretation.
