    "The film you are referring to is \"Se7en\" (1995), which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Film Editing. In the movie, Detective Somerset (played by Morgan Freeman) is followed by the killer, John Doe (played by Kevin Spacey). When John Doe boards the same bus as Somerset, he looks at him and says, \"Thank you,\" which later makes Somerset realize that the killer knows who he is and has been a step ahead of them.\n\nHere is a Python script that prints the title of the film. To satisfy the prompt's requirement, I will also print a simple equation that results in the number from the movie's title.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Define a variable for the movie's title, \"Se7en\".\n2.  Create a simple mathematical equation that equals 7. I will use the numbers 3 and 4.\n3.  Print the equation, showing each number involved.\n4.  Print the final answer, which is the title of the film.\n\n```python\ndef solve_movie_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script identifies the film and provides a simple related equation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The film in question\n    film_title = \"Se7en\"\n\n    # A simple equation related to the film's title\n    num1 = 3\n    num2 = 4\n    result = num1 + num2\n\n    # Print the equation, showing each number\n    print(f\"A simple equation related to the film title: {num1} + {num2} = {result}\")\n\n    # Print the name of the film\n    print(f\"\\nThe Oscar-nominated film where a character says 'Thank you' on a bus to seal his fate is: {film_title}\")\n\nsolve_movie_puzzle()\n```\n<<<Se7en>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    In which Oscar-nominated film does a character seal his fate by saying \"Thank you\" while boarding a bus?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
