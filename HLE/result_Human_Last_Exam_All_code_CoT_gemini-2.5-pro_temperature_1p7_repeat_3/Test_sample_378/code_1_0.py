# Plan:
# 1. The user is asking for the year Goodluck Jonathan publicly identified as "Azikiwe".
# 2. Research indicates that Goodluck Jonathan's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.
# 3. Nnamdi Azikiwe was a different political figure, Nigeria's first president.
# 4. There is no public record of Goodluck Jonathan ever adding "Azikiwe" to his name or identifying as such.
# 5. Therefore, the question is based on a false premise, and the event never occurred.
# 6. This script will print a statement explaining this fact.

conclusion = "Based on public records, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has never publicly identified himself as Azikiwe. His full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name 'Azikiwe' belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. Therefore, there is no year for such an event."
