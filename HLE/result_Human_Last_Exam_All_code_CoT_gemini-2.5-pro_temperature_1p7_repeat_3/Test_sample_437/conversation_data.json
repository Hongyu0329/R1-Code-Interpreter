    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this quantum mechanics problem using a Python script.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** The expression $\\langle \\phi_i | \\frac{1}{r} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ represents a matrix element in quantum mechanics. In this case, it is the expectation value of the potential energy operator, $1/r$ (in atomic units), for an electron described by a specific wavefunction.\n2.  **Define the Wavefunction:** The problem specifies a \"1s Slater orbital\". The normalized, spherically symmetric 1s Slater-type orbital (STO) is given by the function $\\phi_{1s}(r) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\zeta^3}{\\pi}} e^{-\\zeta r}$, where $\\zeta$ (zeta) is the orbital exponent, a parameter that determines the size of the orbital.\n3.  **Set Up the Integral:** The bra-ket notation corresponds to the integral $\\int \\phi_i^*(\\mathbf{r}) \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\right) \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r}$ over all space. I will assume that $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ refer to the same 1s orbital, which is a standard interpretation for this type of problem. Since the wavefunction is real, $\\phi_{1s}^* = \\phi_{1s}$. The integral in spherical coordinates is:\n    \\[\n    \\int_0^\\infty \\int_0^\\pi \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\left( \\phi_{1s}(r) \\right)^2 \\frac{1}{r} r^2 \\sin\\theta \\,d\\phi\\,d\\theta\\,dr\n    \\]\n4.  **Symbolic Calculation with Python:** I will use the `sympy` library in Python to perform this integration symbolically. This avoids manual calculation and shows how to use coding for theoretical physics problems. The code will:\n    *   Define all necessary symbolic variables (`r`, `zeta`).\n    *   Define the normalized 1s STO wavefunction.\n    *   Separate the integral into its radial and angular parts. The angular part evaluates to $4\\pi$.\n    *   Solve the remaining radial integral.\n    *   Combine all parts to find the final symbolic result in terms of $\\zeta$.\n5.  **Provide a Numerical Example:** Since the symbolic result depends on $\\zeta$, I will provide a concrete numerical answer for the hydrogen atom, where $\\zeta=1$ in atomic units.\n\nFollowing this plan, here is the Python code to evaluate the integral.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef evaluate_1s_slater_integral():\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluates the integral <phi_1s| 1/r |phi_1s> for a 1s Slater orbital.\n    \"\"\"\n    # 1.
