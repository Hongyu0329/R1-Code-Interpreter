    "This is a fascinating question that sits at the intersection of history and linguistics. To figure this out, we need to find the original Old English word for \"sister\" and trace its probable evolution, had it not been replaced.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  Identify the Old English word for \"sister\", which predates the Norse invasions.\n2.  Analyze the sound changes that typically occurred between Old English and Modern English.\n3.  Apply these sound changes to the Old English word to project its modern form.\n4.  Compare this projected word with its cousins (cognates) in other Germanic languages like German and Dutch for confirmation.\n5.  Provide the final answer in a Python script that explains this process.\n\n```python\ndef discover_lost_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function deduces the Modern English word for \"sister\"\n    if the Norse influence had not occurred.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Identify the Old English word and the Old Norse word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n    current_word = \"sister\"\n\n    print(f\"The current Modern English word '{current_word}' comes from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'.\")\n    print(f\"Before the Norse invasions (between the 7th and 12th centuries), the Anglo-Saxons used their own word: '{old_english_word}'.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Explain the likely evolution of the Old English word.\n    print(\"If the Norse word had never been adopted, 'sweostor' would have evolved naturally.\")\n    print(\"Based on common sound changes from Old to Modern English:\")\n    print(\" - The 'sw-' sound at the beginning would likely remain (like in 'swim' from 'swimman').\")\n    print(\" - The '-or' suffix would likely soften to '-er' (like 'modor' became 'mother').\")\n    print(\" - The internal vowel cluster 'eo' would simplify.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 3: Look at related languages for confirmation.\n    # The Proto-Germanic root is *swestÄ“r.\n    german_cognate = \"Schwester\"\n    dutch_cognate = \"zuster\"\n    print(f\"We can see a similar evolution in other Germanic languages:\")\n    print(f\" - German: '{german_cognate}'\")\n    print(f\" - Dutch: '{dutch_cognate}'\\n\")\n\n    # Step 4: Conclude and state the final hypothetical word.\n    hypothetical_modern_word = \"swester\"\n    print(\"These patterns suggest that the Old English 'sweostor' would have become:\")\n    print(f\"\\n'{hypothetical_modern_word}'\")\n\ndiscover_lost_word()\n<<<swester>>>"
