# (a) This part of the problem asks for the number of "shallow" functions.

# Step 1: Determine the number of basic boolean values the expression 'e' can be built from.
# As explained in the reasoning, the "shallow" condition limits the arguments to `p`.
# We found that `p` can be applied to 4 distinct `p`-free arguments constructible from `x`.
# These applications p(A_i) result in 4 independent boolean values.
num_boolean_variables = 4

# Step 2: Calculate the number of possible functions of these boolean variables.
# The expression 'e' can be any boolean function of these 4 variables.
# The number of boolean functions of k variables is 2^(2^k).
k = num_boolean_variables

# The number of possible input combinations for a function of k variables.
num_input_combinations = 2**k

# The total number of distinct functions is 2 raised to the power of the number of input combinations.
num_distinct_functions = 2**num_input_combinations
