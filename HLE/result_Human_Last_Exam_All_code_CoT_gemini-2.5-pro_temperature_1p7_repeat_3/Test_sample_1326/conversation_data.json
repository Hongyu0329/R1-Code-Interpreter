    "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the definite integral of the piecewise function $p(x)$ over the interval $[0, 4]$.\n\nThe function is defined as:\n- $p(x) = \\frac{2x^3}{8}$ for $0 \\le x \\le 3$\n- $p(x) = \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{(1+\\cos x)}$ for $3 < x \\le 5$\n\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx$ must be split at $x=3$ according to the function's definition:\n$ \\int_{0}^{4} p(x) dx = \\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx + \\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx $\n\nI will use Python with the SciPy library to numerically compute these two integrals and then add them together to find the total.\n\n1.  **Calculate the first integral:** $\\int_{0}^{3} \\frac{2x^3}{8} dx$\n2.  **Calculate the second integral:** $\\int_{3}^{4} \\frac{e^x(1+ \\sin x)}{1+\\cos x} dx$\n3.  **Sum the results:** The final answer is the sum of the two integrals.\n\nThe following Python code performs these calculations and prints the final equation with the numerical results.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef p(x):\n  \"\"\"\n  Defines the piecewise function p(x).\n  \"\"\"\n  if 0 <= x <= 3:\n    return (2 * x**3) / 8\n  elif 3 < x <= 5:\n    return (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x))\n  else:\n    return 0\n\n# The integral needs to be split into two parts at x=3.\n\n# Part 1: Integrate from 0 to 3\n# For this interval, p(x) = (2x^3)/8\nintegral_part1, error1 = quad(lambda x: (2 * x**3) / 8, 0, 3)\n\n# Part 2: Integrate from 3 to 4\n# For this interval, p(x) = e^x * (1 + sin(x)) / (1 + cos(x))\nintegral_part2, error2 = quad(lambda x: (np.exp(x) * (1 + np.sin(x))) / (1 + np.cos(x)), 3, 4)\n\n# The total integral is the sum of the two parts\ntotal_integral = integral_part1 + integral_part2\n\n# Print the final equation with the calculated values\nprint(f\"The integral is calculated by splitting it into two parts:\")\nprint(f\"Integral from 0 to 4 = (Integral from 0 to 3) + (Integral from 3 to 4)\")\nprint(f\"Integral = {integral_part1} + ({integral_part2})\")\nprint(f\"Total Integral = {total_integral}\")\n\n```\n<<<-397.4621714574929>>>"
