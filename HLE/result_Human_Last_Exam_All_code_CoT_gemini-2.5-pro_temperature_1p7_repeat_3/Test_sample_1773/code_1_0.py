    # Step 1: Explain the primary function of Acetazolamide for IIH.
    explanation_step1 = "1. Acetazolamide is a medication used to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) by reducing the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which lowers intracranial pressure."
    
    # Step 2: Explain the medication's effect on the eye.
    explanation_step2 = "2. A well-known effect of acetazolamide is that it also reduces the production of aqueous humor in the eye. This fluid is responsible for maintaining intraocular pressure (IOP)."
    
    # Step 3: Explain the direct result of this effect.
    explanation_step3 = "3. By reducing aqueous humor production, acetazolamide lowers the intraocular pressure. This is why it is also used as a treatment for glaucoma."
    
    # Step 4: Apply to the specific clinical scenario.
    scenario_analysis = "4. In this case, the patient's IIH is in remission, but they are still taking the medication. The drug's effect on the eye will continue regardless of the intracranial pressure."
    
    # Step 5: State the final conclusion.
    conclusion = "5. Therefore, the continued use of acetazolamide will lead to a measured low intraocular pressure on a test."
