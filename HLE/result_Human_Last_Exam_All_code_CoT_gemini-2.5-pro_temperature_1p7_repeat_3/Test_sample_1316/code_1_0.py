    This function analyzes the genetic scenario from Bridges' experiments to determine the cause of X0 male offspring.

    The problem describes the formation of a Drosophila male with an X0 chromosomal makeup.
    Let's trace the gametes:
    1.  An X0 individual is formed from the fusion of one gamete with an X chromosome and one gamete with no sex chromosome (a 'nullo' gamete).
    2.  The key finding from Calvin Bridges' experiments was that these exceptional offspring arose due to errors in gamete formation in the female fly.
    3.  Specifically, the X0 male resulted from the fertilization of a 'nullo-egg' (an egg with no X chromosome) by a normal X-carrying sperm from the male.
    4.  The formation of a nullo-egg is caused by 'non-disjunction', which is the failure of chromosomes to separate during meiosis.
    5.  This non-disjunction event must occur in the female parent.
    6.  Let's consider the stages:
        - Non-disjunction in Meiosis I (Primary non-disjunction): The homologous pair of X chromosomes fails to separate. This process yields two types of eggs: those with two X chromosomes (XX) and those with no X chromosome (nullo).
        - Non-disjunction in Meiosis II (Secondary non-disjunction): The sister chromatids of an X chromosome fail to separate. This can also produce a nullo-egg.
    7.  Bridges also observed exceptional XXY females, which arise from an XX egg being fertilized by a Y sperm. The fact that both types of exceptional offspring (X0 and XXY) appeared in his results points strongly to Meiosis I non-disjunction in the female, as this single event produces both the required XX eggs and nullo-eggs.

    Therefore, the specific event is the non-disjunction of the X chromosome during female meiosis I.
