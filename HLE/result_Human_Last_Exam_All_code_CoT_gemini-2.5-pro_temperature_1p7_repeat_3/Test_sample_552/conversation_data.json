    "To answer your question, I will first use my knowledge base to identify the specific scientist whose work, particularly their lectures, was cited by Albert Einstein in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. Then, I will create a simple Python script to display this information.\n\n```python\n# This script will print the name of the person whose lectures\n# were cited by Albert Einstein in his famous 1905 paper on Brownian motion.\n\n# The paper is titled \"Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der Wärme\n# geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten suspendierten Teilchen\"\n# (\"On the Motion of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid, as\n# Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\").\n\n# In this paper, Einstein cites the work and lectures of a pioneering physicist\n# in the field of statistical mechanics and the kinetic theory of gases.\n\ncited_scientist = \"Ludwig Boltzmann\"\n\nprint(f\"In his 1905 paper on Brownian motion, Albert Einstein cited the lectures of: {cited_scientist}\")\n```\n<<<Ludwig Boltzmann>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Whose lectures did Albert Einstein cite in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
