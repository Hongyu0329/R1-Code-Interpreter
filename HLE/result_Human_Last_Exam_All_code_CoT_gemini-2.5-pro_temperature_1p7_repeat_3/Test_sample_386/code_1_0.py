# The correct statement (C) mentions the use of a culture medium with specific concentrations
# of supplements for growing the fibroblast cell line.
# This code represents those concentrations in a simple equation.

# Concentration of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) mentioned in option C.
fbs_percentage = 10

# Concentration of antibiotics mentioned in option C.
antibiotic_percentage = 1

# Calculate the total percentage of these two key supplements.
total_supplement_percentage = fbs_percentage + antibiotic_percentage

# Print the final equation, outputting each number involved.
# This equation represents the sum of the percentages of the key additives
# in the cell culture medium.
