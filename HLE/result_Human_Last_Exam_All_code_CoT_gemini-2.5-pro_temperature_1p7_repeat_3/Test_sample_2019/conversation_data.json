    "This problem asks for the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard. A toroidal board wraps around both horizontally and vertically, which changes the nature of diagonal attacks.\n\nHere is my plan to solve this problem:\n1.  **Method**: I will use a backtracking algorithm, which is well-suited for \"placement\" problems on a grid. This method explores all possible placements of queens one by one, and \"backtracks\" as soon as it determines a path cannot lead to a valid solution.\n2.  **Board and Queens**: I'll represent the 5x5 board as a grid with coordinates from (0,0) to (4,4). The positions of the placed queens will be stored in a list.\n3.  **Toroidal Attack Logic**: The core of the solution is the function that checks if a square is under attack. On a 5x5 toroidal board, a queen at `(r1, c1)` attacks a square `(r2, c2)` if:\n    *   They are in the same row (`r1 == r2`) or column (`c1 == c2`).\n    *   They are on the same main diagonal. This is true if `(r1 - c1) % 5` is equal to `(r2 - c2) % 5`.\n    *   They are on the same anti-diagonal. This is true if `(r1 + c1) % 5` is equal to `(r2 + c2) % 5`.\n4.  **Avoiding Duplicates**: The 4 queens are identical, so the order of placement does not matter. To count each unique set of 4 positions only once, the backtracking algorithm will place queens in increasing order of their position on the board (if we imagine the 25 squares numbered 0 to 24).\n5.  **Counting**: The algorithm will recursively place 4 queens. When 4 queens have been successfully placed, it will increment a counter. The final value of this counter is the answer.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan:\n\n```python\ndef solve_4_queens_on_5x5_toroidal():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of ways to place 4 non-attacking queens on a 5x5 toroidal chessboard.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A list to hold the count, allowing it to be modified within recursive calls.\n    solution_count = [0]\n\n    def is_safe(r, c, placements):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a new queen at (r, c) is not attacked by any existing queens.\n        The board size is 5x5.\n        \"\"\"\n        for qr, qc in placements:\n            # Check for attacks on the same row or column.\n            if r == qr or c == qc:\n                return False\n            # Check for attacks on the same main diagonal (toroidal).\n            if (r - c) % 5 == (qr - qc) % 5:\n                return False\n            # Check for attacks on the same anti-diagonal (toroidal).\n            if (r + c) % 5 == (qr + qc) % 5:\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def backtrack(queens_to_place, placements, start_index):\n        \"\"\"\n        The main recursive backtracking function.\n        - queens_to_place: The number of queens remaining to be placed.\n        - placements: A list of (row, col) tuples for queens already on the board.\n        - start_index: The flat index (0-24) from which to start searching for the next placement.\n                       This ensures that we don't count permutations of the same placement.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If all 4 queens have been placed, we found a valid solution.\n        if queens_to_place == 0:\n            solution_count[0] += 1\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through all possible squares starting from start_index.\n        for i in range(start_index, 25):\n            r = i // 5\n            c = i % 5\n\n            # If placing a queen here is safe...\n            if is_safe(r, c, placements):\n                # ...place the queen and recurse.\n                placements.append((r, c))\n                backtrack(queens_to_place - 1, placements, i + 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the queen to explore other possibilities.\n                placements.pop()\n\n    # Initial call to start the search for placing 4 queens.\n    # We start with 4 queens to place, an empty list of placements, and from index 0.\n    backtrack(4, [], 0)\n\n    # Print the final count of solutions.\n    print(solution_count[0])\n\nsolve_4_queens_on_5x5_toroidal()\n<<<100>>>"
