    This function calculates the desired limit based on the analysis.
    
    The limit is derived from the asymptotic behavior of two functions:
    1. f(n), the maximum number of distinct 2-adic valuations of subset sums.
       f(n) is asymptotically equivalent to n^2 / 4.
    2. log_2(n), interpreted as the 2-adic valuation of n! (nu_2(n!)).
       nu_2(n!) is asymptotically equivalent to n.

    The expression to evaluate is lim_{n->inf} f(n) / (n * nu_2(n!)).
    This simplifies to lim_{n->inf} (n^2 / 4) / (n * n).
