    "Of course. Here is a step-by-step plan to solve for the common eigenvalues of $J^2$ and $J_z$ for a p-electron, followed by the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify Initial Quantum Numbers:**\n    *   A \"p-electron\" has an orbital angular momentum quantum number, `l = 1`.\n    *   An \"electron\" has a spin quantum number, `s = 1/2`.\n\n2.  **Determine Total Angular Momentum (j):**\n    *   The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, results from the coupling of `l` and `s`.\n    *   The possible values for `j` range from `|l - s|` to `l + s` in integer steps.\n    *   We will calculate `j_min = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2` and `j_max = 1 + 1/2 = 3/2`. This gives two possible values for `j`: `1/2` and `3/2`.\n\n3.  **Determine Z-Component Quantum Numbers (m_j):**\n    *   For each value of `j`, the quantum number `m_j` (representing the z-component of the total angular momentum) can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues:**\n    *   The eigenvalue of the operator $J^2$ is given by the formula $j(j+1)\\hbar^2$.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the operator $J_z$ is given by the formula $m_j\\hbar$.\n    *   We will calculate these eigenvalues for each possible pair of `(j, m_j)`. For simplicity, we will present the eigenvalues in units of $\\hbar^2$ and $\\hbar$.\n\n5.  **Code Implementation:**\n    *   A Python script will be created to automate these calculations.\n    *   The script will loop through each possible `j` value.\n    *   For each `j`, it will calculate and print the $J^2$ eigenvalue, explicitly showing the numbers used in the calculation as requested.\n    *   It will then find all possible `m_j` values and list the corresponding $J_z$ eigenvalues.\n    *   Finally, it will present the common eigenvalue pairs for each `j` state.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_spin_orbit_coupling():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Define initial quantum numbers for a p-electron.\n    l = 1  # Orbital angular momentum quantum number for a p-orbital\n    s = 0.5  # Spin quantum number for an electron\n\n    print(f\"Solving for a p-electron with orbital quantum number l = {l} and spin s = {s}.\\n\")\n\n    # Step 2: Determine possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j.\n    # j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\n    j_values = np.arange(abs(l - s), l + s + 1, 1)\n\n    print(f\"The possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number, j, are: {list(j_values)}\")\n    print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\n    # Step 3 & 4: For each j, find m_j values and the corresponding eigenvalues.\n    for j in j_values:\n        print(f\"For the state with j = {j}:\")\n\n        # Calculate the eigenvalue of J^2 = j(j+1)ħ²\n        j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n        print(f\"  - The eigenvalue of J^2 is j(j+1)ħ²:\")\n        # As requested, output each number in the final equation.\n        print(f\"    Calculation: {j} * ({j} + 1) * ħ² = {j2_eigenvalue} ħ²\")\n\n        # Determine possible m_j values, which range from -j to +j in steps of 1\n        m_j_values = np.arange(-j, j + 1, 1)\n\n        # The eigenvalues of Jz are m_jħ\n        m_j_strings = [f\"{val} ħ\" for val in m_j_values]\n        print(f\"  - The possible values for the quantum number m_j are: {list(m_j_values)}\")\n        print(f\"  - The corresponding eigenvalues of Jz are: {', '.join(m_j_strings)}\\n\")\n        \n        print(f\"  The common eigenvalue pairs (J^2 eigenvalue, Jz eigenvalue) for j={j} are:\")\n        for m_j in m_j_values:\n            print(f\"    ({j2_eigenvalue} ħ², {m_j} ħ)\")\n        \n        print(\"--------------------------------------------------\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve_spin_orbit_coupling()\n```\n<<<The possible sets of quantum numbers (j, m_j) are (1.5, 1.5), (1.5, 0.5), (1.5, -0.5), (1.5, -1.5) and (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -0.5).>>>"
