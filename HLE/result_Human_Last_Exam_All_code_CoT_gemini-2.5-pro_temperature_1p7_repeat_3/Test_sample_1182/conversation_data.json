    "To find the number of double points in the stable reduction of the curve $y^2=8x+x^2+4x^3+4x^4+8x^5$ over the prime $p=2$, we will use the method of Newton polygons. This standard technique in algebraic geometry allows us to determine the structure of the special fiber of the stable model of the curve, including the number of its singular points.\n\n### Plan:\n\n1.  **Identify the Polynomial:** The curve is given by $y^2 = f(x)$, where $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + x^2 + 8x$.\n2.  **Determine 2-adic Valuations:** We compute the 2-adic valuation (the highest power of 2 that divides a number) for each coefficient of $f(x)$. Let $v_2(c)$ denote this valuation.\n3.  **Construct the Newton Polygon:** The Newton polygon of $f(x)$ at $p=2$ is the lower convex hull of the points $(i, v_2(c_i))$ in the plane, where $c_i$ is the coefficient of $x^i$.\n4.  **Analyze the Polygon's Structure:** The vertices of the Newton polygon are key. The number of segments of the Newton polygon determines the number of \"arms\" in the dual graph of the stable reduction's special fiber. For a hyperelliptic curve, this dual graph is a tree.\n5.  **Calculate the Number of Double Points:** For a simple tree-like structure of the special fiber, the number of double points (nodes) is one less than the number of irreducible components. In our case, this corresponds to the number of segments in the Newton polygon, which is the number of vertices minus one.\n6.  **Implement in Python:** Write a Python script to perform these steps: define the points, compute the lower convex hull, and count the vertices to find the result.\n\nThe coefficients of $f(x) = 8x^5 + 4x^4 + 4x^3 + 1x^2 + 8x^1$ are:\n*   $c_5 = 8 \\implies v_2(8) = 3$\n*   $c_4 = 4 \\implies v_2(4) = 2$\n*   $c_3 = 4 \\implies v_2(4) = 2$\n*   $c_2 = 1 \\implies v_2(1) = 0$\n*   $c_1 = 8 \\implies v_2(8) = 3$\n*   $c_0 = 0 \\implies v_2(0) = \\infty$ (This point is not included in the main construction).\n\nThe points for the Newton polygon are $(i, v_2(c_i))$:\n$(5, 3), (4, 2), (3, 2), (2, 0), (1, 3)$.\n\nThe Python code below will compute the vertices of the lower convex hull for these points and determine the number of double points from it.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_valuations(coefficients):\n    \"\"\"Computes the 2-adic valuation of a list of integer coefficients.\"\"\"\n    valuations = []\n    for c in coefficients:\n        if c == 0:\n            # In theory, valuation is infinity.
