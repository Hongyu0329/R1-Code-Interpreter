Prediction on the Effect of Interleukin-15 (IL-15) on CAR T Cell Cytokine Release:

Given the body of evidence, it is predicted that CAR T cells manufactured in the presence of interleukin-15 will exhibit **enhanced and more sustained cytokine release** upon antigen stimulation compared to CAR T cells manufactured without interleukin-15.

The rationale for this prediction is as follows:

1.  **Enrichment of Memory T Cell Phenotypes:** Interleukin-15 is a cytokine crucial for the survival, proliferation, and maintenance of long-lived memory T cell populations, particularly stem cell memory (Tscm) and central memory (Tcm) T cells. Manufacturing CAR T cells with IL-15 favors the development of a product rich in these less-differentiated, highly persistent cells.

2.  **Superior Persistence and Proliferation:** These memory-rich CAR T cell populations demonstrate superior persistence after infusion into a patient. Upon recognizing their target antigen, they have a greater capacity for self-renewal and robust proliferation, leading to a larger army of effector cells.

3.  **Potent Effector Function:** A larger and more persistent population of CAR T cells will naturally mount a more powerful anti-tumor response. Cytokine release (e.g., IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2) is a primary effector function of activated T cells. Therefore, a more robust proliferative response directly translates to a greater overall magnitude of cytokine secretion.

In conclusion, the use of interleukin-15 during the manufacturing process generates a more potent CAR T cell product, which logically leads to an amplified cytokine response when the cells are activated.
