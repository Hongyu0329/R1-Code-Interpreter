# Plan:
# 1. Identify Max Born's famous contribution: the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function (Born rule).
# 2. Represent this rule with the equation: P = |ψ|².
# 3. Write a Python script to print the name and the equation in the specified format.

name = '"Max Born"'
# The Born rule equation, using LaTeX formatting similar to the examples.
# The number 2 is part of the equation.
