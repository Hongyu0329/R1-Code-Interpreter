    "This problem requires us to find the steady-state probabilities for a given system, which is a continuous-time Markov chain. The steady state is the behavior of the system as time $t$ approaches infinity.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Understand the System:** The provided equations are the Kolmogorov-Chapman forward equations, describing the evolution of probabilities $P_i(t)$ for being in state $i$ at time $t$. The system has four states: 0, 1, 2, and 3.\n\n2.  **Steady-State Condition:** In the steady state, as $t \\to +\\infty$, the probabilities become constant, i.e., $P_i(t) \\to p_i$. Consequently, their time derivatives become zero: $P_i'(t) \\to 0$.\n\n3.  **Formulate Linear Equations:** By setting all derivatives to zero, the system of differential equations transforms into a system of linear algebraic equations.\n    - We must first address a likely typo in the equation for $P_1'(t)$. The term $-\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$ violates the conservation of total probability. For a standard Markov chain, this term represents the flow of probability from state 0 to state 1 and should be positive. We will proceed by correcting it to $+\\lambda_{01}P_0(t)$.\n    The resulting linear system is:\n    *   $0 = -\\lambda_{01}p_{0} + \\lambda_{10}p_{1}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{01}p_{0} - (\\lambda_{10} + \\lambda_{12})p_{1} + \\lambda_{21}p_{2} + \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{12}p_{1} - (\\lambda_{21} + \\lambda_{23})p_{2}$\n    *   $0 = \\lambda_{23}p_{2} - \\lambda_{31}p_{3}$\n\n4.  **Incorporate Normalization:** We also have the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n    *   $p_{0} + p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3} = 1$\n\n5.  **Solve the System:** We will solve this system of equations to find the values of $p_0, p_1, p_2,$ and $p_3$. A convenient way to do this is to express $p_0, p_2,$ and $p_3$ in terms of $p_1$, and then use the normalization condition to find the value of $p_1$.\n\n6.  **Calculate the Final Result:** Once we have the steady-state probabilities, we can calculate the requested sum: $P_0(+\\infty) + P_1(+\\infty) = p_0 + p_1$.\n\n7.  **Implement in Python:** A Python script will be used to perform the calculations accurately and present the result. The script will output the numerical values for $p_0$ and $p_1$ and their sum, fulfilling the request to show the numbers in the final equation.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_steady_state_system():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the boundary-value problem for the Kolmogorov-Chepmen system of equations\n    to find the steady-state probabilities and their sum.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Given transition rates\n    lambda_01 = 0.019\n    lambda_10 = 0.65\n    lambda_12 = 0.4\n    lambda_21 = 0.392\n    lambda_23 = 0.008\n    lambda_31 = 0.008\n\n    # At steady state (t -> +infinity), the derivatives P_i'(t) are zero.\n    # This leads to a system of linear equations for the steady-state probabilities p_i.\n    # A typo in the problem's equation for P_1'(t) is corrected for probability conservation.\n    # The system is:\n    # 1) 0 = -lambda_01*p0 + lambda_10*p1\n    # 2) 0 = lambda_12*p1 - (lambda_21 + lambda_23)*p2\n    # 3) 0 = lambda_23*p2 - lambda_31*p3\n    # 4) p0 + p1 + p2 + p3 = 1\n    # We solve this by expressing p0, p2, and p3 in terms of p1.\n\n    # From (1), p0 = (lambda_10 / lambda_01) * p1\n    c0 = lambda_10 / lambda_01\n\n    # From (2), p2 = (lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)) * p1\n    c2 = lambda_12 / (lambda_21 + lambda_23)\n\n    # From (3), p3 = (lambda_23 / lambda_31) * p2.
