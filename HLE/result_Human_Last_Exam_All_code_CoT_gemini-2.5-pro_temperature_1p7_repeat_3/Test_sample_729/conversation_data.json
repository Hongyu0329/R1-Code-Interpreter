    "Of course. Here is the plan to solve the problem, followed by the Python script to execute the solution.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Identify the Group and the Goal**: The group in question is the generalized quaternion group of size 128, denoted as `Q_128`. The task is to find the number of its \"power subgroups\". A power subgroup is another term for a cyclic subgroup, which is a subgroup generated by a single element.\n\n2.  **Partition the Subgroups**: The cyclic subgroups of `Q_128` can be divided into two distinct and non-overlapping sets:\n    a. Cyclic subgroups that are entirely contained within the group's unique maximal cyclic subgroup, `<x>`.\n    b. Cyclic subgroups that are generated by elements not contained in `<x>`.\n\n3.  **Count Subgroups of Type (a)**:\n    *   The subgroup `<x>` in `Q_128` is a cyclic group of order 64.\n    *   A fundamental theorem of cyclic groups states that the number of subgroups of a cyclic group of order `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`.\n    *   Therefore, I will calculate the number of divisors of 64 to find the count for this set.\n\n4.  **Count Subgroups of Type (b)**:\n    *   The elements not in `<x>` are all of the form `x^i * y`, and there are 64 such elements.\n    *   It's a known property of generalized quaternion groups that every one of these 64 elements has an order of 4.\n    *   Each cyclic subgroup of order 4 has `φ(4) = 2` generators (where `φ` is Euler's totient function).\n    *   The number of distinct subgroups is therefore the total number of these elements divided by the number of generators per subgroup, which is `64 / 2`.\n\n5.  **Calculate the Total**: Since the two sets of subgroups are disjoint, the total number of power subgroups is simply the sum of the counts from Step 3 and Step 4.\n\n6.  **Implement in Python**: I will write a Python script to perform these calculations and print out each step of the reasoning along with the final equation and result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Helper function to count the number of positive divisors of an integer n.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    # Iterate from 1 up to the square root of n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            # If i is a divisor, its pair (n/i) is also a divisor.\n            # If i*i = n, they are the same, so we count only one.\n            if n / i == i:\n                count += 1\n            # Otherwise, we count both i and n/i.\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n\ndef solve_quaternion_power_subgroups():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the number of power subgroups in the generalized\n    quaternion group of size 128.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of power subgroups (cyclic subgroups) in the generalized quaternion group of size 128 (Q_128).\")\n    print(\"The calculation is based on the structure of the group and its elements.\\n\")\n\n    # The generalized quaternion group Q_4n has order 4n.
