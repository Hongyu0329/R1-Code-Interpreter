    Analyzes the clinical scenario and determines the best next step.
    The patient is severely agitated and violent, and failed to respond to an initial
    5mg IM dose of olanzapine (Zyprexa). The priority is to gain rapid control
    of the agitation to ensure patient and staff safety.

    - Verbal de-escalation is no longer safe or appropriate.
    - The initial monotherapy failed, so escalating treatment is necessary.
    - Combination therapy with an antipsychotic and a benzodiazepine is a standard
      and highly effective approach for severe, refractory agitation.
    - Option E offers a robust combination of a higher dose of olanzapine plus lorazepam.
