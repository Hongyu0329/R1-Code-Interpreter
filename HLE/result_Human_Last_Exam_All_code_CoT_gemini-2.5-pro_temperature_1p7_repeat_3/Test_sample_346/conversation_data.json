    "This is a problem that involves understanding SKI combinator logic and its relationship with Church numerals. I will solve this by first decoding the SKI expression into a more familiar mathematical form and then performing the calculation.\n\n### My Plan:\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the SKI Expression**: I will identify the known combinator patterns within the large expression. Specifically, I'll look for patterns that represent Church numerals (like 1, 2, 3) and standard functions like the successor function (`SUCC`).\n2.  **Identify Numerals**:\n    *   The term `S(I)(I)` is a known representation of the Church numeral 2.\n    *   The term `S(S(K(S))(K))` is the successor function (`SUCC`), which takes a Church numeral `n` and returns `n+1`.\n    *   Therefore, `S(S(K(S))(K))(S(I)(I))` is `SUCC(2)`, which represents the Church numeral 3.\n    *   Similarly, `I` represents the Church numeral 1, so `S(S(K(S))(K))(I)` is `SUCC(1)`, representing the Church numeral 2.\n3.  **Simplify the Expression**: Using the identified numerals, the expression simplifies to `S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))(3)`. This has the structure of a function being applied to the Church numeral 3.\n4.  **Analyze the Function's Logic**:\n    *   The function part is `F = S(I)(S(I)(S(I)(K(2))))`.\n    *   The reduction rule for `S(I)` is `(S(I) G) m => I m (G m) => m (G m)`.\n    *   For Church numerals, the application `m(n)` corresponds to exponentiation, specifically `n^m`.\n5.  **Calculate `n` Step-by-Step**:\n    *   Let `F0(m) = K(2)(m)`. This always returns 2.\n    *   Let `F1(m) = S(I)(F0)(m) = m(F0(m)) = m(2) = 2^m`.\n    *   Let `F2(m) = S(I)(F1)(m) = m(F1(m)) = m(2^m) = (2^m)^m = 2^(m^2)`.\n    *   Let `F3(m) = S(I)(F2)(m) = m(F2(m)) = m(2^(m^2)) = (2^(m^2))^m = 2^(m^3)`.\n6.  **Final Calculation**: The entire expression `n` is `F3(3)`. I will substitute `m=3` into the formula for `F3` to find the value of `n`. Then, I will calculate `log_2(n)`.\n\nThe Python code below will perform this final calculation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Based on the reduction of the SKI combinator expression, the Church integer 'n' can be calculated.\n# The structure of the expression corresponds to a nested exponentiation.\n\n# The base of the power comes from the K(C2) term, where C2 is Church numeral 2.\nbase = 2\n\n# The outer argument to the expression is C3, Church numeral 3.\nm = 3\n\n# The number of nested S(I) applications determines the power of m. There are three.\npower_of_m = 3\n\n# The value of the church integer n is given by the formula: base^(m^power_of_m)\n# So, n = 2^(3^3)\n\n# First, calculate the exponent part of the equation.\nfinal_exponent = m ** power_of_m\n\n# The problem asks for the value of log_2(n).\n# log_2(n) = log_2(base ^ final_exponent)\n# Using the logarithm power rule, log_b(x^y) = y * log_b(x):\n# log_2(n) = final_exponent * log_2(base)\n# Since base is 2, log_2(2) = 1. The result is simply the final_exponent.\nresult = final_exponent * math.log2(base)\n\nprint(f\"The church integer n is derived from the expression, which evaluates to a tower of powers.\")\nprint(f\"The formula for n is: {base}^({m}^{power_of_m})\")\nprint(f\"The exponent is calculated first: {m}^{power_of_m} = {final_exponent}\")\nprint(f\"So, n = {base}^{final_exponent}\")\nprint(f\"The problem asks for log_2(n).\")\nprint(f\"log_2(n) = log_2({base}^{final_exponent}) = {int(result)}\")\n<<<27>>>\n```"
