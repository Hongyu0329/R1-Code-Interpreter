# Based on the reduction of the SKI combinator expression, the Church integer 'n' can be calculated.
# The structure of the expression corresponds to a nested exponentiation.

# The base of the power comes from the K(C2) term, where C2 is Church numeral 2.
base = 2

# The outer argument to the expression is C3, Church numeral 3.
m = 3

# The number of nested S(I) applications determines the power of m. There are three.
power_of_m = 3

# The value of the church integer n is given by the formula: base^(m^power_of_m)
# So, n = 2^(3^3)

# First, calculate the exponent part of the equation.
final_exponent = m ** power_of_m

# The problem asks for the value of log_2(n).
# log_2(n) = log_2(base ^ final_exponent)
# Using the logarithm power rule, log_b(x^y) = y * log_b(x):
# log_2(n) = final_exponent * log_2(base)
# Since base is 2, log_2(2) = 1. The result is simply the final_exponent.
result = final_exponent * math.log2(base)
