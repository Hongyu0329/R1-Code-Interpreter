    "To calculate the rule activation level of an interval type-3 fuzzy set, we will use a t-norm operation on the given values. The t-norm acts as a fuzzy logic 'AND' operator. The most common t-norm is the minimum function.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  Define the firing level of the antecedent part of the rule, `Phi_k(x′)`.\n2.  Define the membership degree of the output variable in the consequent fuzzy set, `μG_k_j(y_j)`.\n3.  Apply the minimum t-norm to these two values, which means we will find the minimum of the two.\n4.  Print the equation and the final result.\n\n```python\n# Given values\nphi_k = 0.7\nmu_G_k_j = 0.9\n\n# A t-norm operation is a generalized intersection.\n# The most common t-norm is the minimum function.\n# We will use the minimum t-norm to calculate the rule activation level.\nactivation_level = min(phi_k, mu_G_k_j)\n\n# Print the final equation and the result\nprint(f\"The rule activation level is calculated using the minimum t-norm operation.\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min(Phi_k(x'), μG_k_j(y_j))\")\nprint(f\"Activation Level = min({phi_k}, {mu_G_k_j}) = {activation_level}\")\n```\n<<<0.7>>>"
