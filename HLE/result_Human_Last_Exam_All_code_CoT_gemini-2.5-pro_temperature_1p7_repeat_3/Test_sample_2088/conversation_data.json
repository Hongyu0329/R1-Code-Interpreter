    "Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n1.  First, I will combine the two integrals, since they share the same denominator and integration limits. The expression to compute is $(12)^4 \\cdot (\\int_0^1 f(x)dx)^4$ where $f(x)$ is the combined integrand.\n2.  The combined integrand is $\\frac{(1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x}{(3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$. To simplify this, I will perform a substitution $u=1-x$.\n3.  After substitution, the integral becomes $I = \\int_0^1 \\frac{u^9 - u^5 + u}{(3u^8 - 4u^4 + 6)^{3/4}} du$. I'll switch the variable back to $x$ for consistency.\n4.  The key step is to recognize that the new integrand, $\\frac{x^9 - x^5 + x}{(3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{3/4}}$, is the derivative of a simpler function, scaled by a constant. I will find this antiderivative by observing the structure of the integrand. The antiderivative appears to be of the form $F(x) = C \\cdot x^2 \\cdot (3x^8 - 4x^4 + 6)^{1/4}$.\n5.  By differentiating $F(x)$, I will find the constant C and thus the exact antiderivative.\n6.  Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, I will evaluate the definite integral $I = [F(x)]_0^1$.\n7.  Finally, I will substitute the value of the integral $I$ back into the original expression $(12)^4 \\cdot I^4$ to compute the final result.\n\nI will use Python with the `sympy` library to perform the symbolic differentiation and calculate the final value.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef solve_expression():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the mathematical expression step-by-step using symbolic computation.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1 & 2: Define the expression and combine integrals with u=1-x substitution.\n    # The original expression is:\n    # (12)^4 * ( Integral_0^1 [((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4)] dx -\n    #             Integral_0^1 [x / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4)] dx )^4\n    # Combining integrals gives:\n    # Integral_0^1 [((1-x)^9 - (1-x)^5 + 1 - x) / (3(1-x)^8 - 4(1-x)^4 + 6)^(3/4)] dx\n    # Let u = 1-x.
