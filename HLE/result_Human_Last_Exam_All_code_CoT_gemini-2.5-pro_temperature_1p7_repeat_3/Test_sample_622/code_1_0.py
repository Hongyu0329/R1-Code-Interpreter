    print("--- Option A: Who likes Mary and Jane? She_i likes Mary_i and Jane. ---")
    print("Sentence to analyze: 'She_i likes Mary_i and Jane.'")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. 'She' is a pronoun and 'Mary' is an R-expression (a name).")
    print("2. The subscript '_i' indicates 'She' and 'Mary' refer to the same entity.")
    print("3. 'She' (the subject) c-commands 'Mary' (part of the object).")
    print("4. This violates Binding Principle C, which states that an R-expression must be free (i.e., not c-commanded by a co-referential expression).")
    print("Result: This sentence is ungrammatical DUE TO a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence B
    print("--- Option B: John likes Mary's glasses. Whose does John like glasses? ---")
    print("Sentence to analyze: 'Whose does John like glasses?'")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. This sentence is ungrammatical.")
    print("2. The error comes from an illegal syntactic movement (violating the Left Branch Condition), not from a binding relationship between a pronoun, anaphor, or R-expression.")
    print("Result: This sentence is ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle violation.\n")

    # Analysis of Sentence C
    print("--- Option C: John likes Mary and himself. Who does John like Mary and? ---")
    print("Sentence to analyze: 'Who does John like Mary and?'")
    print("Analysis:")
    print("1. This sentence is ungrammatical.")
    print("2. The error comes from moving an element out of a coordinate structure (violating the Coordinate Structure Constraint), not from a binding relationship.")
    print("Result: This sentence is ungrammatical, but NOT due to a binding principle violation.\n")
