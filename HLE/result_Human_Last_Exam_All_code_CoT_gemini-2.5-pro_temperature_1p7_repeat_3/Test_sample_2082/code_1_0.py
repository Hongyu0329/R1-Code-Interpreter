        'Magnesium': 'Acts as a natural calcium channel blocker. By competing with calcium, it reduces calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells. This leads to muscle relaxation and vasodilation (widening of blood vessels), which lowers blood pressure.',
        'Inflammation': 'Chronic inflammation can cause endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness, which generally contributes to *higher* blood pressure.',
        'Calcium': 'Essential for muscle contraction. Influx of calcium into vascular smooth muscle cells causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels).',
        'Brain Matter': 'Changes in brain matter are related to cognitive function and neurology, not the primary, direct mechanism for blood pressure regulation by a supplement.',
        'Calcium Deposition': 'While magnesium may play a role in preventing vascular calcification long-term, its immediate effect on blood pressure is through vasodilation, not directly protecting elastic fibers.'

    # Step 3: Evaluate each option based on this knowledge
    print("Evaluating the options:")
    # A: This aligns directly with the vasodilation described in our knowledge base.
    print("Option A: 'Through direct vasodilation' - This is consistent with magnesium's role as a calcium channel blocker, which causes blood vessels to relax and widen.")
    
    # B: This is a plausible long-term effect but not the primary, direct mechanism.
    print("Option B: 'By protecting elastic fibers from calcium deposition' - This is a secondary, long-term effect, not the primary mechanism for lowering blood pressure.")

    # C: Irrelevant mechanism.
    print("Option C: 'By increasing white matter and gray matter in the brain' - This is unrelated to blood pressure regulation.")

    # D: The opposite is true.
    print("Option D: 'By stimulating an inflammatory response' - This is incorrect. Inflammation is associated with higher, not lower, blood pressure.")

    # E: The opposite is true.
    print("Option E: 'It raises systemic blood calcium levels' - This is incorrect. Magnesium acts as a calcium antagonist or competitor.")
