    print("----------------------------------------------------------")

    print("\nStep 1: Molecular Composition")
    print("- Central Atom: Copper (Cu)")
    print("- Ligand: 2,5-dithiahexane (CH3-S-CH2-CH2-S-CH3)")
    print("- Number of Ligands: Two ('bis')")
    print("- Coordination: Each ligand is bidentate, binding through its two sulfur atoms. This results in a 4-coordinate complex.")

    print("\nStep 2: Coordination Geometry")
    print("- The ligand forms a 5-membered chelate ring (Cu-S-C-C-S), which has a natural 'bite angle' (S-Cu-S) close to 90 degrees.")
    print("- This angle perfectly fits a square planar geometry.")
    print("- The short chain connecting the sulfur atoms means they must coordinate to adjacent ('cis') positions. A 'trans' arrangement is sterically impossible.")
    print("- Conclusion: The molecule adopts a cis-square planar geometry around the central copper atom.")

    print("\nStep 3: 3D Conformation and Ring Puckering")
    print("- The 5-membered chelate rings are not flat; they are puckered out of the central CuS4 plane.")
    print("- To minimize steric repulsion between the two ligands, the most stable conformation has the two rings puckering in opposite directions.")
    print("- One ring puckers 'up' while the other puckers 'down'.")

    print("\nStep 4: Symmetry Element Analysis")
    print("- E (Identity): Present in all molecules.")
    print("- Cn (Proper Rotation Axis): No C2 or other rotation axes exist. A C2 axis would require both rings to pucker to the same side.")
    print("- Ïƒ (Mirror Plane): No mirror planes exist due to the puckered rings and the orientation of the methyl groups.")
    print("- i (Center of Inversion): Yes. A center of inversion exists at the copper atom. Every atom (x,y,z) has an identical counterpart at (-x,-y,-z).")
    print("- Sn (Improper Rotation Axis): No improper axes are present (other than S2, which is equivalent to i).")

    print("\nStep 5: Final Conclusion")
    print("- A point group containing only the identity (E) and a center of inversion (i) is defined as Ci.")
    
    # The final "equation" is the name of the point group itself.
    # The numbers involved are the implied "1" subscript for C (C1) and the order of the group.
