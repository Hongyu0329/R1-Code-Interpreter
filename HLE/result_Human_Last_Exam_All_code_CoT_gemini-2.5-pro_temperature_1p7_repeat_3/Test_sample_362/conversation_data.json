    "To determine the product of the Wittig reaction between pivalaldehyde and (2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify Reactants**: I will first determine the chemical structures of the two reactants from their names.\n    *   **Pivalaldehyde**: This is an aldehyde with a tert-butyl group attached to the carbonyl group. Its structure is (CH₃)₃C-CHO.\n    *   **(2-(2-chlorophenyl)ethylidene)triphenyl-λ⁵-phosphane**: This is a phosphorus ylide (the Wittig reagent). I will parse its name to find its structure, which is Ph₃P=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\n2.  **Apply Wittig Reaction Mechanism**: The Wittig reaction forms a new carbon-carbon double bond by replacing the oxygen atom of the aldehyde's carbonyl group (C=O) with the carbon group of the ylide (=CR₂). The reaction also produces triphenylphosphine oxide (Ph₃P=O) as a byproduct.\n\n3.  **Determine Product Structure**: I will combine the two carbon fragments to form the final alkene structure: (CH₃)₃C-CH=CH-CH₂-(2-ClC₆H₄).\n\n4.  **Name the Product**: I will determine the systematic IUPAC name for the resulting alkene. This involves finding the longest carbon chain containing the double bond, numbering it, and naming the substituents.\n\n5.  **Determine Stereochemistry**: I will assess the type of ylide (unstabilized, in this case) to predict the stereochemistry (E/Z) of the product alkene. Unstabilized ylides typically favor the Z-isomer.\n\n6.  **Construct Python Code**: Finally, I will create a Python script that defines the names of the reactants and products and prints the full reaction equation. This will clearly display the final product while satisfying the request to use code and show all numbers in the equation via the IUPAC names.\n\n```python\ndef solve_wittig_reaction():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the product of a specific Wittig reaction\n    and prints the reaction equation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1.
