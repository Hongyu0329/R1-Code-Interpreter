    "Here is a plan to determine the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, besides Mount Olympus:\n\n1.  First, I will compile a list of the historical mountains that are mentioned in Homer's Iliad.\n2.  Next, I will find the modern-day elevations (in meters) for each of these mountains.\n3.  I will then create a Python script that stores these mountains and their elevations in a dictionary.\n4.  The script will programmatically exclude Mount Olympus, as specified in the query.\n5.  Finally, it will iterate through the remaining mountains to identify the one with the highest elevation and print the result along with a comparison of all the relevant mountain heights.\n\n```python\ndef find_tallest_mountain():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad, excluding Mount Olympus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary of mountains mentioned in the Iliad and their elevations in meters.\n    mountains = {\n        \"Mount Olympus\": 2918,\n        \"Mount Tmolus\": 2157,\n        \"Mount Athos\": 2033,\n        \"Mount Ossa\": 1978,\n        \"Mount Ida (Trojan)\": 1774,\n        \"Mount Pelion\": 1624,\n        \"Mount Samothrace\": 1611,\n    }\n\n    # Remove Mount Olympus from the comparison as per the instructions.\n    del mountains[\"Mount Olympus\"]\n\n    # Find the name of the tallest remaining mountain.\n    tallest_mountain_name = max(mountains, key=mountains.get)\n    \n    # Sort the mountains by height in descending order for a clear comparison.\n    sorted_mountains = sorted(mountains.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    print(\"The tallest historical mountain in the Iliad (after Olympus) is found by comparing the elevations:\")\n    \n    # Constructing the comparison equation string.\n    equation_parts = []\n    for name, height in sorted_mountains:\n        print(f\"- {name}: {height}m\")\n        equation_parts.append(str(height))\n    \n    # The final equation showing the comparison of all heights.\n    comparison_equation = \" > \".join(equation_parts)\n    print(f\"\\nFinal Comparison Equation:\")\n    print(comparison_equation)\n\n    print(f\"\\nTherefore, the tallest mountain is {tallest_mountain_name}.\")\n\nfind_tallest_mountain()\n```\n<<<Mount Tmolus>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    After Mount Olympus, what is the tallest historical mountain mentioned in the Iliad?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
