    analysis_b = "This is a critical point. A film that tackles a taboo historical event without support from the official national film body (FINAS), and then gains massive international acclaim, becomes a powerful symbol of artistic freedom and historical reckoning. This contrast is the core of its significance to many Malaysians."
