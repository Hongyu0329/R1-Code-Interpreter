# This script determines the smallest possible cardinality of an intersection of countably many open dense subsets of P(X).
# The final answer is derived through a series of logical steps based on topological principles.

# Step 1: Analyze the topological properties of the space P(X).
# P(X) is the space of all infinite closed subsets of a compact connected metric space X
# that have exactly one limit point. X is equipped with the Hausdorff metric.
# - P(X) is a completely metrizable space.
#   - X is a compact metric space, so it is complete. The hyperspace 2^X of non-empty closed subsets of X, with the Hausdorff metric, is also a complete metric space.
#   - A set K is in P(X) if and only if its derived set K' (the set of its limit points) has cardinality 1. The set {K in 2^X | |K'| = 1} can be shown to be a G_delta subset of 2^X.
#   - A G_delta subset of a complete metric space is completely metrizable by Alexandroff's Theorem. Thus, the Baire Category Theorem applies to P(X).
#
# - P(X) is a perfect space (it has no isolated points).
#   - Let K be an arbitrary element of P(X). Let x be the limit point of K.
#   - Since X is a compact connected metric space with more than one point, it is a perfect space. Thus, x is not an isolated point in X.
#   - This means we can find a sequence of points (y_m) in X, not in K, that converges to x.
#   - Consider the sequence of sets K_m = K U {y_m}. Each K_m is in P(X), is different from K, and the sequence (K_m) converges to K in the Hausdorff metric.
#   - This construction shows that K is not an isolated point. Therefore, P(X) is a perfect space.

# Step 2: Apply the Baire Category Theorem.
# The Baire Category Theorem states that for a non-empty completely metrizable space, the intersection of countably many open dense subsets is a dense set.
# A stronger version of the theorem applies to perfect, completely metrizable spaces. It states that such an intersection is not only dense but also has the same cardinality as the space itself.

# Step 3: Determine the cardinality of P(X).
# - First, find the cardinality of X.
#   - X is a connected metric space with more than one point, so it is uncountable.
#   - X is a compact metric space, so it is separable. A separable space has cardinality at most c (the cardinality of the continuum).
#   - Thus, |X| = c = 2^aleph_0.
#
# - Next, find the cardinality of P(X).
#   - An element of P(X) is determined by a countable set of points from X.
#   - The number of countable subsets of X is |X|^aleph_0 = c^aleph_0 = (2^aleph_0)^aleph_0 = 2^(aleph_0 * aleph_0) = 2^aleph_0 = c.
#   - Therefore, |P(X)| <= c.
#   - Since X contains an arc (a homeomorphic image of [0,1]), we can construct at least c distinct sets in P(X).
#   - Therefore, |P(X)| >= c.
#   - Combining these, |P(X)| = c.

# Step 4: Final Conclusion.
# The intersection of countably many open dense subsets of P(X) has the same cardinality as P(X).
# This cardinality is c = 2^aleph_0.
# This result holds for any space X that meets the criteria, so the smallest possible cardinality is c.

# The final answer is the cardinality 2^aleph_0.
# The numbers in this mathematical expression are 2 and 0 (from aleph_0).
