    # The primary, overarching reason for declining 13C in this period is the global Suess Effect.
    print("Step 1: Acknowledge the primary global driver (The Suess Effect).")
    print("The period 1886-1990 corresponds with the Industrial Revolution. The large-scale burning of fossil fuels released vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. This fossil fuel CO2 is depleted in the heavier 13C isotope. This has caused a global decline in the 13C ratio of atmospheric CO2, which is then recorded by trees. This is known as the Suess effect and is the dominant global signal.\n")

    print("Step 2: Evaluate the given answer choices as potential regional or secondary factors.\n")

    # Option A: Increase in tree ring thickness
    print("Evaluation of A: An increase in tree ring thickness as the tree matures.")
    print("Result: This is a factor of internal tree physiology ('juvenile effect') and not a primary driver for a consistent, century-long isotopic trend that mirrors atmospheric changes. It is unlikely to be the predominant factor.\n")

    # Option B: Periods of drought
    print("Evaluation of B: Periods of drought.")
    print("Result: Incorrect. During drought, trees experience water stress and partially close their stomata. This reduces their ability to discriminate against the heavier 13C isotope during photosynthesis, leading to an INCREASE, not a decrease, in the 13C ratio.\n")

    # Option C: Increased photosynthetic reserves of starch
    print("Evaluation of C: Increased photosynthetic reserves of starch fueling tree growth.")
    print("Result: This relates to internal carbon allocation within the tree. It does not explain a long-term trend dictated by external environmental conditions over a century. Unlikely to be the predominant factor.\n")

    # Option D: Thinning earlywood tree ring proportion
    print("Evaluation of D: Thinning earlywood tree ring proportion.")
    print("Result: This is an aspect of tree growth anatomy. While it can influence isotopic values, it is not a large-scale environmental driver and is unlikely to be the predominant factor for the century-long trend.\n")

    # Option E: Changes in the SE Asia monsoon
    print("Evaluation of E: Changes in the SE Asia monsoon.")
    print("Result: Plausible. The SE Asia monsoon is a major regional climatic driver influencing temperature and, most importantly, moisture availability. A long-term strengthening of the monsoon (i.e., wetter conditions) would reduce water stress on trees. With ample water, stomata remain more open, allowing for greater discrimination against the heavier 13C isotope. This would lead to a DECREASING 13C ratio in the tree rings, a trend that would add to the global Suess effect. Among the choices provided, this is the most significant environmental factor that aligns with the observed declining trend.\n")

    print("Step 3: Conclusion.")
    print("While the Suess effect is the primary global driver, it is not an option. Of the choices given, 'Changes in the SE Asia monsoon' is the most significant and plausible environmental factor that would cause a declining 13C ratio in this specific region.")
