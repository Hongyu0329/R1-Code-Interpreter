    "To find an analytical approximation for the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}} dx$ for small $\\epsilon$, we can follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Analyze the integrand:** For small $\\epsilon > 0$, the term $\\epsilon$ is very small. The denominator, $\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$, becomes very close to zero if the polynomial part $f(x) = 9.0 x^{5.0} + 5.0 x^{6.0} + 9.0 x^{8.0}$ is close to zero. On the integration interval $[0, 15.00]$, $f(x)$ is zero only at $x=0$. This means the integrand becomes very large near $x=0$, and this region gives the dominant contribution to the integral.\n\n2.  **Approximate the denominator:** Near $x=0$, the polynomial $f(x)$ is dominated by the term with the lowest power of $x$. In this case, the term is $9.0 x^{5.0}$. So, we can approximate $f(x) \\approx 9.0 x^{5.0}$. Let's call these parameters $c_{min} = 9.0$ and $p_{min} = 5.0$.\n\n3.  **Approximate the integral:** We can now approximate the integral as:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{15.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n    Since the integrand decreases rapidly for larger $x$, the contribution from $x$ near 15.00 is negligible compared to the contribution from near $x=0$. We can extend the upper integration limit to infinity without introducing a significant error, which simplifies the calculation:\n    $I(\\epsilon) \\approx \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 9.0 x^{5.0}} dx$.\n\n4.  **Solve the approximate integral:** This type of integral has a general analytical solution. For an integral of the form $\\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + c x^p} dx$, the solution is $C \\cdot \\epsilon^a$, where the exponent is $a = \\frac{1}{p} - 1$ and the coefficient is $C = \\frac{\\pi}{p \\cdot c^{1/p} \\cdot \\sin(\\pi/p)}$.\n\n5.  **Calculate the final formula:** Using $c = c_{min} = 9.0$ and $p = p_{min} = 5.0$, we can calculate the specific values for $a$ and $C$.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to derive the final analytical formula.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function derives the analytical approximation for the integral I(epsilon)\n    for small epsilon.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters from the dominant term in the denominator polynomial (9.0*x^5.0).\n    c_min = 9.0\n    p_min = 5.0\n\n    # The approximation has the form I(epsilon) ~ C * epsilon^a.\n    \n    # Calculate the exponent 'a'.\n    a = (1.0 / p_min) - 1.0\n\n    # Calculate the coefficient 'C'.\n    # The formula for C is: pi / (p_min * c_min^(1/p_min) * sin(pi/p_min)).\n    pi = math.pi\n    c_min_term = c_min**(1.0 / p_min)\n    sin_term = math.sin(pi / p_min)\n    C = pi / (p_min * c_min_term * sin_term)\n\n    # Print the step-by-step derivation of the formula with numerical values.\n    print(\"The analytical formula that approximates I(epsilon) for small epsilon is of the form: C * epsilon^a.\")\n    print(\"\\nDerivation based on approximation near x=0:\")\n    print(f\"1.
