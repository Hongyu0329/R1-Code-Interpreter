# Description: This script identifies the correct "True Avalanche" for the given prompt.
# A "True Avalanche" repeats a syllable pattern. The word to be used is "computer,"
# and the description is "My software tells the birds when and where to relieve themselves."

# The syllables of "computer" are com-pu-ter.
# The phrase "Come poo, tern!" phonetically matches these syllables.
# A "tern" is a type of bird, and the phrase is a command for it to "poo,"
# which perfectly matches the description in a punny way.
# Therefore, "Computer: 'Come poo, tern!'" is the correct answer.

correct_answer = "Computer: \"Come poo, tern!\""
