    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the dimension of the bosonic sector of the relevant supersymmetric sigma-model. This dimension corresponds to the number of non-Grassman (i.e., bosonic) variables required to parametrize the model.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the target space:** For a supersymmetric sigma-model describing disordered systems of symmetry class D with `N` replicas, the target space is the Riemannian symmetric superspace `G/H = Osp(2N | 2N) / U(N|N)`.\n2.  **Determine the number of bosonic variables:** This is the dimension of the bosonic part of the target space `G/H`, which is calculated by subtracting the dimension of the bosonic part of the subgroup `H` from that of the supergroup `G`.\n    *   Number of variables = `dim_bos(G) - dim_bos(H)`.\n3.  **Calculate `dim_bos(G)`:** For the supergroup `G = Osp(2N | 2N)`, the bosonic part of its Lie superalgebra is `so(2N) ⊕ sp(2N)`. The dimension is `dim(SO(2N)) + dim(Sp(2N))`.\n4.  **Calculate `dim_bos(H)`:** For the supergroup `H = U(N | N)`, the bosonic part of its Lie superalgebra is `u(N) ⊕ u(N)`. The dimension is `dim(U(N)) + dim(U(N))`.\n5.  **Substitute `N=2`:** We will perform the calculations for the given number of replicas, `N=2`.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to calculate the final number.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_class_d_variables():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the supersymmetric sigma-model\n    of symmetry class D with a given number of replicas.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Number of replicas as specified in the problem\n    N = 2\n\n    # --- Step 1: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of G = Osp(2N|2N) ---\n    # The bosonic subgroup of Osp(2N|2N) is SO(2N) x Sp(2N).\n    # Its dimension is dim(SO(2N)) + dim(Sp(2N)).\n\n    # Dimension of SO(k) = k * (k - 1) / 2\n    dim_so_2N = (2 * N) * (2 * N - 1) // 2\n\n    # Dimension of Sp(2k) = k * (2k + 1)\n    # Here, the group is Sp(2N), so the parameter for the formula is k=N.\n    dim_sp_2N = N * (2 * N + 1)\n\n    # Total bosonic dimension of G = Osp(2N|2N)\n    dim_G_bos = dim_so_2N + dim_sp_2N\n\n    # --- Step 2: Calculate the dimension of the bosonic part of H = U(N|N) ---\n    # The bosonic subgroup of U(N|N) is U(N) x U(N).\n    # Its dimension is dim(U(N)) + dim(U(N)).\n\n    # Dimension of U(k) = k^2\n    dim_u_N = N * N\n\n    # Total bosonic dimension of H = U(N|N)\n    dim_H_bos = dim_u_N + dim_u_N\n\n    # --- Step 3: Calculate the final number of variables ---\n    # This is the dimension of the bosonic part of the coset space G/H.\n    num_bosonic_variables = dim_G_bos - dim_H_bos\n\n    # --- Step 4: Print the detailed calculation ---\n    print(\"This script calculates the number of non-Grassman variables for the bosonic sector of the supersymmetric sigma-model for disordered systems of symmetry class D with N replicas.\")\n    print(f\"The number of replicas is N = {N}.\\n\")\n    print(\"The target superspace for this model is G/H = Osp(2N|2N) / U(N|N).\")\n    print(\"The number of bosonic variables is dim_bos(G) - dim_bos(H).\\n\")\n    \n    print(\"--- Calculation ---\")\n    print(f\"1.
