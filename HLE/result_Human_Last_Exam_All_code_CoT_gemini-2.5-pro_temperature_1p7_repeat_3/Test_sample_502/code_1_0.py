# Step 1: Define the order of the group G.
group_order = 10000

# Step 2: The largest possible dimension of R/I is bounded by the order of the group.
# This maximum is achieved if G is a complex reflection group.

# Step 3: We construct such a group. Let's consider a cyclic group G = C_10000
# acting on the first coordinate of C^10. This is a complex reflection group of order 10000.
# The action is generated by g(x_1, ..., x_10) = (exp(2*pi*i/10000) * x_1, x_2, ..., x_10).

# Step 4: For this group action, the ring of invariants R^G is a polynomial ring
# generated by {x_1^10000, x_2, ..., x_10}.
# We list the degrees of these fundamental invariants.
degrees_of_invariants = [10000, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

# Step 5: The dimension of the coinvariant algebra R/I is the product of these degrees.
dimension = math.prod(degrees_of_invariants)

# Step 6: Display the final calculation.
