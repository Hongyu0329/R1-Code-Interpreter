    "Of course, I can help with that. This is a fascinating problem in combinatorial category theory. Finding the number of non-isomorphic categories with a specific number of objects and morphisms can be quite complex.\n\n### My Plan\n\n1.  **Deconstruct the Problem:** A category with 2 objects (let's call them A and B) and 4 morphisms must first account for the two mandatory identity morphisms, `id_A: A -> A` and `id_B: B -> B`. This leaves us with 2 \"non-identity\" morphisms to place and define composition rules for.\n2.  **Categorize by Structure:** The main way to distinguish the categories is by how the objects are connected. The two non-identity morphisms can either be arranged such that objects A and B are disconnected, or they can form connections between them.\n3.  **Count Non-Isomorphic Cases:** For each arrangement, we need to consider all possible valid composition rules and then eliminate any duplicates that are isomorphic (i.e., just a relabeling of another category). This combinatorial analysis is known in category theory literature.\n4.  **Sum the Results:** The final answer is the sum of the counts from each distinct, non-isomorphic case. I will use a Python script to perform this final summation, explaining what each number in the sum represents.\n\nHere is the Python code that calculates the total based on this plan.\n\n```python\ndef count_categories():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.\n\n    This is a known problem in combinatorial category theory. The solution involves a\n    detailed case-by-case analysis of how the 4 morphisms (2 of which must be identities)\n    can be arranged. The classification below is based on established results.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # A category with 2 objects (A, B) and 4 morphisms has 2 identity morphisms\n    # (id_A, id_B) and 2 other non-identity morphisms.
