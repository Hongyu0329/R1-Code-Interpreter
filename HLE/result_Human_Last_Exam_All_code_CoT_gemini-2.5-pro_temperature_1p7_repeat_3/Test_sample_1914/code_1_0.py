    Calculates the number of non-isomorphic categories with 2 objects and 4 morphisms.

    This is a known problem in combinatorial category theory. The solution involves a

    # In this case, there are no morphisms between A and B. The 2 non-identity

    # structures like two parallel arrows (A -> B, A -> B), an isomorphism
