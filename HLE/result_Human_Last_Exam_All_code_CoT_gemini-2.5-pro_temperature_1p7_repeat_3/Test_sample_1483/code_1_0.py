    # The question asks for the smallest possible cardinality of the collection
    # of regular proper subcontinua of a nondegenerate decomposable continuum.

    # Based on the principles of continuum theory, we can deduce the answer.
    # 1. A decomposable continuum must have at least one regular proper subcontinuum.
    #    This sets a lower bound of 1.
    # 2. We can construct a continuum that achieves a small number.
    #    Consider a space X made by joining two indecomposable continua, I_1 and I_2, at a single point.
    #    - X is decomposable because X is the union of its proper subcontinua I_1 and I_2.
    #    - The only regular proper subcontinua in this construction are I_1 and I_2 themselves.
    # 3. This construction provides an example of a decomposable continuum with exactly 2 regular proper subcontinua.
    #    This shows that the minimum is at most 2.
    # 4. A deeper theorem in continuum theory shows that the number cannot be 1.
