    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify the governing physical principle:** The Chern number is a topological invariant. For a composite system made of two weakly coupled subsystems (like two Chern insulators connected with a negligible tunneling barrier), the total Chern number is the sum of the individual Chern numbers. This is known as the additivity of the Chern number.\n2.  **Define the inputs:** We are given two Chern insulators.\n    *   Chern number of the first insulator, C1 = 1.\n    *   Chern number of the second insulator, C2 = 1.\n3.  **Formulate the equation:** The total Chern number of the junction, C_total, is C1 + C2.\n4.  **Implement the calculation in Python:** I will write a Python script that defines the variables for C1 and C2, calculates their sum to find C_total, and then prints the entire equation and the final result.\n\nHere is the Python script to perform the calculation:\n```python\n# The principle: The Chern number of a composite system is the sum of the individual Chern numbers.\n\n# Define the Chern number for each of the two insulators.\nchern_number_1 = 1\nchern_number_2 = 1\n\n# Calculate the total Chern number of the junction by adding the individual numbers.\ntotal_chern_number = chern_number_1 + chern_number_2\n\n# Print the step-by-step reasoning and the final equation.\nprint(\"The Chern number of the junction is calculated by summing the Chern numbers of the individual insulators.\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the first insulator (C1): {chern_number_1}\")\nprint(f\"Chern number of the second insulator (C2): {chern_number_2}\")\nprint(\"\\nThe equation for the total Chern number (C_total) is:\")\nprint(f\"C_total = C1 + C2\")\nprint(f\"C_total = {chern_number_1} + {chern_number_2} = {total_chern_number}\")\n```\n<<<2>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to.
