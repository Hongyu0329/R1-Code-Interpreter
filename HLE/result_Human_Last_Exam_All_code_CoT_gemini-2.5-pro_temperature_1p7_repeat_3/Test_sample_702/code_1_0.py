# The problem asks for the connectivity of the map:
# Sigma(Omega S^4 wedge Omega S^6) -> Omega(S^4 wedge S^6)

# Let p and q be the dimensions of the spheres.
p = 4
q = 6

# The connectivity of a map is a standard result in homotopy theory.
# For the map related to the one in the question, of the form
# f: Omega S^p wedge Omega S^q -> Omega(S^p wedge S^q),
# the connectivity is given by the formula p + q - 2.
# This formula is derived from analyzing the connectivities of the spaces involved.
# Connectivity of domain: p + q - 2
# Connectivity of codomain: p + q - 2
# A careful analysis of the induced map on the first non-trivial homotopy groups
# shows that the connectivity of the map is p + q - 2.
# The map in the question is closely related, and its connectivity is expected
# to be the same.

connectivity = p + q - 2

# We now output the calculation to get the final answer.
