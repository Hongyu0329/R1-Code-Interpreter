    "The question asks whether a Schwartz function $f$ must be identically zero if all its moments, $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x^k f(x) dx$, are zero for all non-negative integers $k$. The answer is yes.\n\nMy plan to answer this question is as follows:\n1.  I will first provide the theoretical explanation for why this is true. The key idea is to use the Fourier transform. The moments of a function are directly related to the derivatives of its Fourier transform at the origin.\n2.  The condition that all moments are zero implies that the Fourier transform and all its derivatives are zero at the origin.\n3.  For a well-behaved function like the Fourier transform of a Schwartz function, having all derivatives be zero at a single point is sufficient to prove that the function is zero everywhere.\n4.  If the Fourier transform of a function is zero, the function itself must be zero by the injectivity of the Fourier transform on the Schwartz space.\n5.  Following this explanation, I will provide a Python script that uses the `sympy` library to symbolically demonstrate the crucial relationship between a function's moments and the derivatives of its Fourier transform. This script will not *prove* the theorem but will serve as a concrete, computational illustration of the underlying mathematical principle. I will use the Gaussian function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$, a standard example of a Schwartz function, for this demonstration.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\nfrom sympy import exp, pi, oo, I, S\n\ndef solve_schwartz_moment_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function addresses the question about the Schwartz function with zero moments.\n    It first prints the theoretical explanation and then provides a computational\n    demonstration using the SymPy library.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Theoretical Explanation ---\")\n    print(\"Yes, if f is a Schwartz class function such that its moments are all zero, it follows that f = 0.\")\n    print(\"Here is the reasoning:\")\n    print(\"1.
