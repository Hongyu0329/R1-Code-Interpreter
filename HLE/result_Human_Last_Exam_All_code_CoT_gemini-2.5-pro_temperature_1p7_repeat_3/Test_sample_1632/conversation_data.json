    "Of course. Here is the plan and the Python code to solve the problem.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Problem:** The goal is to find `a(10)`, which represents the total number of unique, 10-step self-avoiding walks on a 2D grid (a Manhattan lattice). A self-avoiding walk is a path that starts at the origin and never visits the same point more than once.\n\n2.  **Choose an Algorithm:** There is no simple mathematical formula for this. The problem can be solved by systematically exploring all possible paths of length 10 and counting the ones that are self-avoiding. A recursive backtracking algorithm is an excellent method for this kind of pathfinding problem.\n\n3.  **Implement the Algorithm:**\n    *   We will create a recursive function, let's call it `count_walks_recursive`.\n    *   This function will keep track of the current position on the grid (`x`, `y`) and the number of steps left to take.\n    *   To enforce the \"self-avoiding\" rule, we'll use a `set` to store all the points that have already been visited on the current path. A `set` provides very fast lookups.\n    *   **Base Case:** The recursion stops when there are no steps left (`steps_left == 0`). This means we have successfully found one complete self-avoiding walk, so the function returns `1`.\n    *   **Recursive Step:** For the current position, the function tries to move in all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, it checks if the new point is already in the `visited` set.\n        *   If the new point has not been visited, the function adds it to the `visited` set, and then recursively calls itself from this new point with one fewer step to take (`steps_left - 1`).\n        *   After the recursive call returns, it's crucial to \"backtrack\" by removing the point from the `visited` set. This allows other paths to explore that point.\n    *   The function will sum the counts returned from all valid recursive calls and return the total.\n\n4.  **Execution:** The main code will start the process by calling the recursive function from the origin `(0, 0)` with `n=10` steps. The final returned value will be `a(10)`.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_saw_count(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates a(n), the number of n-step self-avoiding walks on a Manhattan lattice.\n    \n    This function uses a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible paths.\n    \n    Args:\n        n (int): The number of steps in the walk.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The total number of n-step self-avoiding walks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Increase recursion limit if needed for larger n, though not necessary for n=10.\n    # sys.setrecursionlimit(max(sys.getrecursionlimit(), n + 5))\n\n    # A set to store visited coordinates for the current path for O(1) lookups.\n    visited = set()\n    # The walk starts at the origin.\n    visited.add((0, 0))\n\n    def count_walks_recursive(x, y, steps_left):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursively counts valid self-avoiding walks from the current position.\n        \n        Args:\n            x (int): The current x-coordinate.\n            y (int): The current y-coordinate.\n            steps_left (int): The number of steps remaining in the walk.\n            \n        Returns:\n            int: The number of valid walks from this state.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Base case: If no steps are left, we have found one complete walk.\n        if steps_left == 0:\n            return 1\n\n        total_walks = 0\n        # The four possible moves on a Manhattan lattice: up, down, left, right.\n        moves = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]\n\n        for dx, dy in moves:\n            next_x, next_y = x + dx, y + dy\n            next_point = (next_x, next_y)\n\n            # Check if the next point would violate the self-avoiding condition.\n            if next_point not in visited:\n                # Explore from the new point.\n                visited.add(next_point)\n                total_walks += count_walks_recursive(next_x, next_y, steps_left - 1)\n                # Backtrack: remove the point to allow other paths to use it.\n                visited.remove(next_point)\n        \n        return total_walks\n\n    # Start the walk from the origin (0, 0) with n steps.\n    result = count_walks_recursive(0, 0, n)\n    return result\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    # The number of steps for the walk.\n    num_steps = 10\n    \n    # Calculate the result.\n    a_10 = solve_saw_count(num_steps)\n    \n    # The problem asks for the equation, which is a(n) = result.\n    # We print each number involved in this final equation.\n    print(f\"Let a(n) be the number of n-step self-avoiding walks.\")\n    print(f\"For n = {num_steps}:\")\n    print(f\"a({num_steps}) = {a_10}\")\n\n```\n<<<44100>>>"
