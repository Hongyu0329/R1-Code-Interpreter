    "The formula for the fermionic partition function `Z` in the imaginary time representation is derived using the path integral formalism. It involves integrating over all possible configurations of fermionic fields, which are represented by anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. The time variable is Wick-rotated to imaginary time (`τ = it`), and the trace operation in the statistical mechanics definition of `Z` imposes anti-periodic boundary conditions on these fields over the imaginary time interval from 0 to `β = 1/(k_B T)`.\n\nThe final expression is a functional integral of the exponential of the negative Euclidean action over all Grassmann field configurations.\n\nHere is the Python code to display this formula:\n\n```python\ndef display_fermionic_partition_function_formula():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the formula for the fermionic partition function\n    in the imaginary time path integral formalism.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Define symbols for the formula ---\n    partition_function = \"Z\"\n    integral_measure = \"∫ Dψ̄ Dψ\"\n    exponential = \"exp\"\n    euclidean_action = \"S_E[ψ̄, ψ]\"\n\n    # --- Print the main formula for the partition function Z ---\n    print(\"The fermionic partition function Z is given by:\")\n    formula_z = f\"{partition_function} = {integral_measure} {exponential}(-{euclidean_action})\"\n    print(formula_z)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- Define and print the Euclidean action S_E ---\n    print(\"Where the Euclidean action S_E is:\")\n    integral_time = \"∫_0^β dτ\"  # Integration from 0 to beta\n    integral_space = \"∫ dᵈx\"\n    lagrangian_euclidean = \"L_E(ψ̄(x,τ), ψ(x,τ))\"\n    formula_s = f\"{euclidean_action} = {integral_time} {integral_space} {lagrangian_euclidean}\"\n    print(formula_s)\n    print(\"-\" * 30)\n\n    # --- State the crucial boundary conditions for fermions ---\n    print(\"The path integral is taken over all Grassmann fields ψ and ψ̄\")\n    print(\"subject to anti-periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time:\")\n    boundary_condition = \"ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)\"\n    print(boundary_condition)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    display_fermionic_partition_function_formula()\n\n<<<Z = ∫ Dψ̄ Dψ exp(-S_E[ψ̄, ψ]), where S_E[ψ̄, ψ] = ∫_0^β dτ ∫ dᵈx L_E(ψ̄(x,τ), ψ(x,τ)) with anti-periodic boundary conditions ψ(x, 0) = -ψ(x, β)>>>\n```"
