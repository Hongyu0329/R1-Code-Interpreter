    "To determine the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical \"perfluoronanocar,\" we first need to establish the chemical formula of a standard nanocar.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Identify a Nanocar Structure:** We'll base our calculation on the well-known nanocar molecule developed by Professor James Tour's group at Rice University. This molecule consists of a chassis/axle system and four fullerene wheels.\n2.  **Determine the Hydrocarbon Formula:** The hydrocarbon framework (chassis and axles) of this nanocar has the chemical formula C42H28.\n3.  **Apply the \"Perfluoro-\" Prefix:** The chemical prefix \"perfluoro-\" means that all hydrogen (H) atoms in the original molecule are replaced by fluorine (F) atoms.\n4.  **Calculate the Number of Fluorine Atoms:** By replacing all 28 hydrogen atoms in C42H28 with fluorine atoms, we can determine the total number of fluorine atoms in the resulting \"perfluoronanocar\" framework.\n5.  **Generate Python Code:** The code will articulate this logic, defining the number of hydrogen atoms and showing that this number directly corresponds to the number of fluorine atoms in the perfluorinated version.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_perfluoronanocar_fluorines():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of fluorine atoms in a hypothetical perfluoronanocar.\n    \n    This is based on the standard nanocar structure from the Tour group,\n    where the hydrocarbon framework (chassis and axles) is C42H28.\n    The \"perfluoro-\" prefix indicates that all hydrogen atoms are replaced\n    by fluorine atoms.
