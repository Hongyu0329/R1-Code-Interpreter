    "This is a fun movie trivia question! The scene you're describing is quite memorable. Here's my plan to answer it:\n\n1.  First, I'll identify the movie based on the specific scene described: a teenager on a pink bike pedaling defiantly toward an oncoming car.\n2.  The movie is **\"It Chapter Two\"** (2019). The scene occurs at the beginning of the film, featuring the character Victoria \"Vicky\" Fuller.\n3.  As requested, I will provide a simple Python script that prints this information.\n4.  Finally, I will provide the answer in the specified `<<<answer>>>` format.\n\n```python\ndef find_movie_from_scene():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the movie based on a specific scene description.\n    \"\"\"\n    movie_title = \"It Chapter Two\"\n    studio = \"Warner Bros. Pictures (produced by New Line Cinema, a subsidiary)\"\n    scene_description = \"A teenager named Victoria Fuller rides her pink bicycle directly toward an oncoming car driven by Henry Bowers.\"\n\n    print(f\"The movie you are asking about is: {movie_title}\")\n    print(f\"Produced by a major studio: {studio}\")\n    print(f\"Scene: {scene_description}\")\n\n# Execute the function to display the information\nfind_movie_from_scene()\n```\n<<<It Chapter Two>>>"
