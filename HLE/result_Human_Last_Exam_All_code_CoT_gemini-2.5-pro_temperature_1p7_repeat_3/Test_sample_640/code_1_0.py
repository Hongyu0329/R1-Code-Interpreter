def solve_quantum_scattering_problem():
    """
    Analyzes the provided statements about quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on the principle that the property of being "trivially coupled"
    (diagonalizable by a single constant matrix) or "nontrivially coupled" is a
    fundamental characteristic of the system that is preserved when moving from the
    potential V(r) to the Jost matrix F(E) and the S-matrix S(E).

    Let's review each statement:
    1) A nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled potential V(r).
       - This is correct. It is the contrapositive of the statement "a trivially coupled potential leads
         to a trivially coupled S-matrix". A potential that can be decoupled by a constant basis change
         will result in an S-matrix that is also decoupled in that same basis.

    2) A diagonal scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a diagonal potential V(r).
       - This is correct. A diagonal S-matrix is a special case of a trivially coupled one. This implies
         V(r) must also be trivially coupled. For the S-matrix to be diagonal (and not just trivially coupled),
         the phase shifts in the diagonalized basis must be non-degenerate. This non-degeneracy generally holds
         unless the diagonal potentials are identical, which would make the original potential V(r) diagonal
         to begin with.

    3) A nontrivially coupled potential V(r) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E).
       - This is correct. The Jost matrix is derived directly from the solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation with potential V(r).
         The coupling structure of V(r) is directly imprinted onto the structure of F(E). A nontrivially coupled V(r)
         (where the principal axes of interaction rotate with r) cannot produce a trivially coupled F(E).

    4) A nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E).
       - This is correct. This follows from the relation S(E) = F* F^-1. It is not possible to construct a
         nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E) that, for all energies, conspires to produce a trivially
         coupled S(E) when multiplied by its conjugate inverse. The nontrivial coupling structure is preserved.

    5) There exist nontrivially coupled potentials V(r) with diagonal Jost matrices F(E).
       - This is incorrect. A diagonal F(E) is trivially coupled. From statement 3, a trivially coupled F(E)
         must correspond to a trivially coupled V(r). This contradicts the premise of the statement.
