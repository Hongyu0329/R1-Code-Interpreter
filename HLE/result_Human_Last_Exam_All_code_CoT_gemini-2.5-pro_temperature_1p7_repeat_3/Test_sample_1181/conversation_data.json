    "This is a knowledge-based question about the 1972 film *Solaris*. My plan is to access my knowledge base about the film's plot, characters, and dialogue to determine the correct answer.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Request:** The user wants to identify a character from Andrei Tarkovsky's film *Solaris* based on a specific feeling they expressed: being ashamed to miss the sound of rustling leaves.\n2.  **Recall Character Details:**\n    *   **Kris Kelvin:** The protagonist, a psychologist sent to the station. His main emotional struggle is with the \"guest\" of his dead wife, Hari.\n    *   **Hari:** A \"guest\" created by the Solaris ocean. She has no memories of Earth and cannot miss it.\n    *   **Dr. Snaut:** A cyberneticist on the station. He is cynical, weary, and often serves as a philosophical voice, reflecting on their humanity and isolation so far from Earth.\n    *   **Dr. Sartorius:** A biologist on the station. He is cold, rational, and dismissive of human emotion, focusing only on the scientific problem.\n    *   **Gibarian:** Kris's friend who committed suicide before Kris arrived. He appears only in a video log.\n3.  **Identify the Correct Character:** The sentiment of missing something as simple and profoundly \"Earthly\" as rustling leaves, and feeling a sense of shame or triviality about it in the face of cosmic exploration, is central to the character of Dr. Snaut. He is the one who most eloquently speaks about their homesickness and the futility of seeking new worlds when they haven't even understood themselves or their own world. This specific sentiment is a key part of his philosophical monologue.\n4.  **Construct the Code:** I will write a simple Python script that states the question and prints the name of the correct character based on my analysis.\n\n```python\ndef find_solaris_character():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the character from the 1972 film 'Solaris'\n    who expressed shame at missing the sound of rustling leaves.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # A dictionary of the characters provided in the answer choices.\n    character_options = {\n        \"A\": \"Kris\",\n        \"B\": \"Hari\",\n        \"C\": \"Snaut\",\n        \"D\": \"Sartorius\",\n        \"E\": \"Gibarian\"\n    }\n    \n    # Dr. Snaut is the character who delivers a philosophical monologue\n    # about humanity's homesickness and the need for a \"mirror\" rather than new worlds.\n    # It is he who is ashamed to admit missing simple, earthly things like the rustling of leaves.\n    correct_answer_key = \"C\"\n    correct_character_name = character_options[correct_answer_key]\n    \n    print(\"In Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 movie Solaris, the character who is ashamed to miss the sound of leaves rustling on Earth is:\")\n    print(f\"Answer: {correct_answer_key}. {correct_character_name}\")\n\nfind_solaris_character()\n```\n<<<C>>>"
