# Based on number-theoretic analysis, the limit of the sequence g_n is g.
# The prime factorization of g is determined by the minimum q-adic valuations
# of P(p) over all large primes p.
# Our analysis concluded that g is of the form 2^a * 3^b * 5^c.

# The exponent of 2 in g is v2(g) = 10.
a = 10
p1 = 2
val1 = p1**a

# The exponent of 3 in g is v3(g) = 2.
b = 2
p2 = 3
val2 = p2**b

# The exponent of 5 in g is v5(g) = 1.
c = 1
p3 = 5
val3 = p3**c

# The limit g is the product of these prime powers.
g = val1 * val2 * val3

# Print the final calculation as an equation.
print(f"The limit is g = {p1}^{a} * {p2}^{b} * {p3}^{c} = {val1} * {val2} * {val3} = {g}")

# The final answer is an integer.
print(f"The limit of the sequence (g_n) is {g}.")
