    "To determine the number of expected peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum of 1,3,5-tri[((4S,7R)-7,8,8-trimethyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-4,7-methano-2H-indazol-2-yl)methyl]-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, we need to analyze its molecular structure to identify all chemically non-equivalent protons.\n\n### Step-by-step Analysis:\n\n1.  **Overall Molecular Symmetry:** The molecule has a central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene ring. At positions 1, 3, and 5, it is substituted with three identical large groups. This substitution pattern gives the molecule a C3 rotational axis of symmetry passing through the center of the benzene ring. Due to this symmetry, the three large substituents are chemically equivalent, as are the three methyl groups on the central ring. Therefore, we only need to count the number of unique proton environments in one of these repeating units.\n\n2.  **Protons on the Central Ring:**\n    *   The three methyl groups (-CH3) at positions 2, 4, and 6 of the central benzene ring are equivalent due to the C3 symmetry. They will produce a single signal.\n    *   **Signal Count: 1**\n\n3.  **Protons in a Single Substituent Arm:** We will analyze one `[((4S,7R)-...-yl)methyl]` arm.\n    *   **Benzylic Methylene Protons (`-CH2-`)**: This CH2 group connects the central ring to the nitrogen of the indazole system. The indazole ligand is chiral. Protons in a CH2 group adjacent to a chiral center are diastereotopic, meaning they are chemically non-equivalent and will give two separate signals.\n    *   **Signal Count: 2**\n\n    *   **Protons of the Camphor-Indazole Ligand**: This ligand is chiral and internally asymmetric. We need to count all its unique protons.\n        *   **Pyrazole Ring Proton**: The indazole contains a pyrazole ring. This ring has one C-H bond. This proton is unique.\n        *   **Signal Count: 1**\n        *   **Methyl Group Protons**: The camphor-derived framework is named as `7,8,8-trimethyl`. This corresponds to the three methyl groups on the bicyclic camphor skeleton. While the parent camphor molecule has a C2 axis of symmetry that makes the two geminal methyls on the bridge equivalent, the formation of the asymmetric pyrazole ring on its side breaks this symmetry. Consequently, all three methyl groups are in different chemical environments and are non-equivalent.\n        *   **Signal Count: 3**\n        *   **Bridgehead Proton (`-CH-`)**: There is one proton on the camphor framework bridgehead (the C4 position in camphor). It's in a unique environment.\n        *   **Signal Count: 1**\n        *   **Methylene Protons (`-CH2-`)**: There are two CH2 groups in the six-membered ring portion of the bicyclic framework. As with the methyl groups, the loss of the C2 symmetry element makes these two CH2 groups non-equivalent. Furthermore, the two protons within each CH2 group (the 'exo' and 'endo' protons) are diastereotopic. This results in all four methylene protons being chemically unique.\n        *   **Signal Count: 4**\n\n4.  **Total Signal Count:** We sum the counts from each part of the molecule.\n\n    *   Central Ring Methyls: 1\n    *   Linker -CH2-: 2\n    *   Pyrazole -CH-: 1\n    *   Camphor-Framework Methyls: 3\n    *   Camphor-Framework Bridgehead -CH-: 1\n    *   Camphor-Framework Methylene -CH2-'s: 4\n    *   **Total = 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 4 = 12**\n\nThe following Python code calculates this sum and prints the logic.\n\n```python\n#\n# Plan to calculate the number of 1H NMR signals for the given molecule.\n# 1. Identify the overall molecular symmetry to find equivalent parts of the molecule.\n# 2. Count the number of unique proton signals on the central benzene core.\n# 3. Count the number of unique proton signals in one of the substituent arms, as they are all equivalent.\n# 4. Sum the counts to find the total number of expected peaks.\n#\n\n# Step 1: Account for symmetry. The molecule has C3 symmetry.\n\n# Step 2: Count signals from the central 2,4,6-trimethylbenzene core.\n# The three methyl groups are equivalent due to C3 symmetry.\nnum_ar_me_signals = 1\n\n# Step 3: Count signals from one substituent arm.\n# The arm is a -CH2- linker attached to a chiral camphor-indazole ligand.\n\n# The two protons of the -CH2- linker are diastereotopic due to the adjacent chiral ligand.\nnum_linker_ch2_signals = 2\n\n# The camphor-indazole ligand is chiral and asymmetric. We count its unique protons.\n# a) One proton on the pyrazole ring.\nnum_pyrazole_h_signals = 1\n\n# b) Three methyl groups on the camphor framework become non-equivalent due to loss of symmetry.\nnum_camphor_me_signals = 3\n\n# c) One proton at the bridgehead of the camphor framework.\nnum_camphor_bridgehead_ch_signals = 1\n\n# d) Two CH2 groups on the camphor framework contain four non-equivalent protons in total.\nnum_camphor_methylene_ch_signals = 4\n\n# Step 4: Sum all unique signals.\ntotal_signals = (num_ar_me_signals +\n                 num_linker_ch2_signals +\n                 num_pyrazole_h_signals +\n                 num_camphor_me_signals +\n                 num_camphor_bridgehead_ch_signals +\n                 num_camphor_methylene_ch_signals)\n\n# Print the final equation with each component's contribution.\nprint(\"The total number of expected peaks is the sum of signals from each unique proton environment.\")\nprint(f\"Total peaks = (Ar-Me) + (Linker CH2) + (Pyrazole H) + (Camphor Me) + (Camphor CH) + (Camphor CH2s)\")\nprint(f\"Total peaks = {num_ar_me_signals} + {num_linker_ch2_signals} + {num_pyrazole_h_signals} + {num_camphor_me_signals} + {num_camphor_bridgehead_ch_signals} + {num_camphor_methylene_ch_signals}\")\nprint(f\"Total expected peaks = {total_signals}\")\n```\n<<<H>>>"
