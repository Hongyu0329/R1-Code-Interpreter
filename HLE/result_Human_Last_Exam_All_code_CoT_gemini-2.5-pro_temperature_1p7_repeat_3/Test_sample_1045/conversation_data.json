    "To determine the total number of contracted Gaussian functions for a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C7H8), we first need to understand how many functions this basis set assigns to each type of atom. Then, we multiply these counts by the number of atoms of each type in the molecule and sum the results.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  **Identify the number of atoms:** Toluene (C7H8) has 7 Carbon atoms and 8 Hydrogen atoms.\n2.  **Determine basis functions per atom for 6-31G:**\n    *   **Hydrogen (H):** It is a first-row element. Its 1s valence orbital is represented by two basis functions (a \"split-valence\" representation). One function is a contraction of 3 primitive Gaussians, and the other is a single primitive Gaussian. This results in **2** contracted functions per H atom.\n    *   **Carbon (C):** It is a second-row element with core and valence electrons.\n        *   **Core (1s):** Represented by 1 contracted function (from 6 primitives).\n        *   **Valence (2s, 2p):** Split into an inner and an outer part.\n            *   Inner part (from 3 primitives): One s-function and one set of p-functions (px, py, pz) = 1 + 3 = 4 contracted functions.\n            *   Outer part (from 1 primitive): One s-function and one set of p-functions (px, py, pz) = 1 + 3 = 4 contracted functions.\n        *   Total per C atom = 1 (core) + 4 (inner valence) + 4 (outer valence) = **9** contracted functions.\n3.  **Calculate the total:** Multiply the number of atoms by their respective function counts and sum them up.\n    *   Total = (7 Carbon atoms × 9 functions/C) + (8 Hydrogen atoms × 2 functions/H)\n\nThe following Python code will perform this calculation and print out each step.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of atoms in toluene (C7H8)\nnum_carbon = 7\nnum_hydrogen = 8\n\n# Define the number of contracted Gaussian functions per atom for the 6-31G basis set\n# For Carbon (C), this is 9 (1 for 1s core, 4 for inner valence 2s/2p, 4 for outer valence 2s/2p)\ncgf_per_c = 9\n# For Hydrogen (H), this is 2 (split-valence 1s)\ncgf_per_h = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of functions contributed by each element\ntotal_from_carbon = num_carbon * cgf_per_c\ntotal_from_hydrogen = num_hydrogen * cgf_per_h\n\n# Calculate the final total number of contracted Gaussian functions\ntotal_cgf = total_from_carbon + total_from_hydrogen\n\n# Print the breakdown of the calculation\nprint(f\"For a 6-31G basis set calculation of toluene (C{num_carbon}H{num_hydrogen}):\\n\")\nprint(f\"Each Carbon atom contributes {cgf_per_c} contracted Gaussian functions.\")\nprint(f\"Each Hydrogen atom contributes {cgf_per_h} contracted Gaussian functions.\\n\")\nprint(\"The total number of functions is calculated as follows:\")\nprint(f\"Total = (Number of Carbons * Functions per C) + (Number of Hydrogens * Functions per H)\")\nprint(f\"Total = ({num_carbon} * {cgf_per_c}) + ({num_hydrogen} * {cgf_per_h})\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_from_carbon} + {total_from_hydrogen}\")\nprint(f\"Total = {total_cgf}\\n\")\nprint(f\"A 6-31G calculation on toluene uses a total of {total_cgf} contracted Gaussian functions.\")\n```\n<<<79>>>"
