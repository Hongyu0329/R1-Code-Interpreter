The laboratory used an old, heavily subcultured (Passage 11) bacterial strain for its Quality Control. This strain was likely attenuated (weakened) and unable to grow, leading the lab to mistakenly believe the lack of growth was due to the antibiotic working. In reality, the antibiotic in Batch 3 was destroyed by being autoclaved, and the QC test gave a misleading 'false negative' result.
