    "This is a historical linguistics question rather than a coding problem. The name \"Odobeccus\" is the Latinized form of a name belonging to a Frankish chieftain who lived in Gaul. The modern French equivalent name derived from the same Germanic root \"Audo-\" or \"Odo-\" (meaning \"wealth\" or \"heritage\") is \"Eudes\".\n\nI will provide a simple Python script to state this relationship as requested.\n\n```python\ndef find_french_equivalent():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the modern French equivalent for the ancient name \"Odobeccus\".\n    \"\"\"\n    gaulish_name = \"Odobeccus\"\n    # The name Odobeccus is a Latinized Frankish name.\n    # The Germanic root 'Odo-' or 'Audo-' evolved into the French name 'Eudes'.\n    french_equivalent = \"Eudes\"\n    \n    print(f\"The Gaulish/Frankish name is: {gaulish_name}\")\n    print(f\"Its modern French equivalent is: {french_equivalent}\")\n\nfind_french_equivalent()\n```\n<<<Eudes>>>"
