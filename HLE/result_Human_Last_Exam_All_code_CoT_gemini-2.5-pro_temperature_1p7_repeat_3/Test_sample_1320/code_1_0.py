# Plan: Calculate the size of hydrogen-bonded rings in an alternating alpha/epsilon-peptide.

# Define the number of backbone atoms for each residue type.
# The backbone is the chain of atoms from one amide nitrogen to the next amide nitrogen.
# For Alanine (alpha-amino acid, -NH-CH(CH3)-CO-), the backbone is N-Calpha-C'. This is 3 atoms.
# The number of atoms in the path between the start N and end C' is 1 (Calpha).
ala_backbone_path_atoms = 1 

# For an epsilon-amino acid (-NH-(CH2)5-CO-), the backbone is N-Cepsilon-...-Calpha-C'. 
# The chain is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-. This is 5 atoms.
epsilon_aa_backbone_path_atoms = 5

# --- Calculation 1: Ala(i) -> Ala(i+2) H-bond ---
# This H-bond skips one epsilon-amino acid residue (i+1).
# The covalent path making the ring is: C'(Ala, i) -> N(eps, i+1) -> ...backbone... -> C'(eps, i+1) -> N(Ala, i+2)
# The number of atoms in this path is the sum of atoms from the intervening residue's backbone
# plus the two amide nitrogens and two carbonyl carbons that connect them.
# A simpler way to count is to sum the path atoms within each residue and add the connecting amide atoms.
# Path = C'(Ala,i) -> [N-backbone-C'](eps,i+1) -> N(Ala,i+2)
# However, the most direct method is to count the atoms in the covalent chain between the carbonyl Carbon and the amide Nitrogen.
# The path contains: 1 N-atom, `epsilon_aa_backbone_path_atoms`, and 1 C'-atom from the epsilon residue,
# plus the C' of Ala(i) and the N of Ala(i+2). No, this is getting confusing.
# Let's use a clear, verified counting method from chemical literature.
# The covalent path for C=O(i) ... H-N(i+k) consists of the backbone atoms from C'(i) to N(i+k).
# For Ala(i) -> Ala(i+2), the path is: C'(Ala,i)-[NH-(CH2)5-CO](eps,i+1)-NH(Ala,i+2).
# Let's list the atoms in the path explicitly: C'(Ala_i), N(eps_{i+1}), Ceps, Cdel, Cgam, Cbet, Calp, C'(eps_{i+1}), N(Ala_{i+2}).
