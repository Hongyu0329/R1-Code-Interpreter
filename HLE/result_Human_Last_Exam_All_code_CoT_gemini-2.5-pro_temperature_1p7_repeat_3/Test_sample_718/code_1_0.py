# This script is designed to provide the solution to the mathematical question posed.
# The question is: For what n is a tame functor on an upper semilattice n-resolvable?

# Step 1: Analyze the problem.
# This is a question in homological algebra and representation theory of posets.
# "n-resolvable" means the functor has a projective dimension of at most n.
# We are looking for a universal integer n that bounds this dimension.

# Step 2: Combine the given properties.
# A functor f on a poset J corresponds to a module over the incidence algebra K[J].
# The conditions "tame" and "upper semilattice" on J are very restrictive.
# In particular, for the algebra K[J] to be tame, the width of the poset J
# cannot be too large. For an upper semilattice, this means its width is at most 2.

# Step 3: Use an example to find a lower bound for n.
# Consider the poset J being the Boolean lattice on 2 elements ({}, {a}, {b}, {a,b}).
# This is an upper semilattice, and its representation type is finite (a form of tame).
# The global homological dimension of its incidence algebra K[J] is 2.
# This means there are functors f on J with a projective dimension of 2.
# Therefore, n must be at least 2.

# Step 4: Conclude the most likely answer.
# In the theory of tame algebras, those that are not hereditary (global dimension 1)
# are often of global dimension 2 (e.g., canonical algebras).
# The evidence suggests that the constraints force the homological dimension to be bounded by 2.
# Thus, any such functor is 2-resolvable.

n = 2

# Step 5: Print the final equation as requested.
# The prompt requires printing the final equation, including each number.
print("n =", n)
