    "The problem asks for the minimal number of triangles needed to triangulate the outer hull of a great icosahedron.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan to solve this:\n1.  First, we need to understand what the \"outer hull\" of a great icosahedron is. The great icosahedron is a non-convex polyhedron, but its 12 vertices are located in the same positions as the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The \"outer hull\" (or convex hull) is the smallest convex shape that encloses all these vertices. Therefore, the outer hull of a great icosahedron is a regular icosahedron.\n2.  Next, we need to find the \"minimal number of triangles needed for triangulating\" this shape. A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid whose surface is already composed of 20 identical equilateral triangles.\n3.  Since the surface is already perfectly divided into triangles, this existing structure represents the minimal triangulation.\n4.  Thus, the number of triangles on the outer hull is simply the number of faces of a regular icosahedron, which is 20.\n\nI will now provide a Python script to print this result.\n\n```python\n# The great icosahedron has 12 vertices, which are the same as the vertices\n# of a regular icosahedron.\n# Therefore, the convex hull (or \"outer hull\") of a great icosahedron\n# is a regular icosahedron.\n\n# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.\n# These faces are all equilateral triangles.\n\n# The \"triangulation of the outer-hull\" is the set of these triangular faces.\n# Since the faces are already triangles, the minimal number of triangles\n# required is simply the number of faces.\n\nnumber_of_faces_on_icosahedron = 20\n\n# The question asks for the final number in an equation. As this is a direct fact,\n# we can represent it as:\n# Number of triangles = 20\nprint(\"The minimal number of triangles for triangulating the outer-hull of the great icosahedron is:\")\nprint(number_of_faces_on_icosahedron)\n```\n<<<20>>>"
