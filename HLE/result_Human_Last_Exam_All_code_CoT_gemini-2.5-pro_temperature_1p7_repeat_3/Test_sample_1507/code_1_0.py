# The great icosahedron has 12 vertices, which are the same as the vertices
# of a regular icosahedron.
# Therefore, the convex hull (or "outer hull") of a great icosahedron
# is a regular icosahedron.

# A regular icosahedron is a Platonic solid with 20 faces.
# These faces are all equilateral triangles.

# The "triangulation of the outer-hull" is the set of these triangular faces.
# Since the faces are already triangles, the minimal number of triangles
# required is simply the number of faces.

number_of_faces_on_icosahedron = 20

# The question asks for the final number in an equation. As this is a direct fact,
# we can represent it as:
# Number of triangles = 20
