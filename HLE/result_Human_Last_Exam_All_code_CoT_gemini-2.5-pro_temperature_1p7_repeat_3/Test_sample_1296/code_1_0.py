    # Part (a): If G/N is cyclic, must D_N be unicellular?
    # The definition of a quasiprimitive action of G on the face set F implies that its socle N
    # acts transitively on F. The faces of the quotient D_N are the orbits of N on F.
    # A transitive action has only one orbit, so D_N has one face (is unicellular).
    # This holds true regardless of the structure of G/N.
    answer_a = "Yes"

    # Part (b): Specify the types (HA, TW, AS) for which G can be the automorphism group of D
    # if D is a smooth covering of a unicellular dessin.
    # A "smooth covering" requires that the face rotation group <z> intersects the socle N trivially.
    # - HA (Holomorph of Abelian): This is possible.
    # - TW (Twisted Wreath product): This is possible, subject to certain conditions on the parameters.
    # - AS (Almost Simple): A known theorem states this is impossible for regular maps.
    answer_b = "HA, TW"

    # Part (c): True or False: If G is of type TW with l <= 5, D cannot be a smooth covering of D_N.
    # A theorem by Conder, Jones, Malle, and Wolfart (2012) states that for such a smooth covering
    # to exist, the valency l = |G:N| must be at least 6.
    # The condition l <= 5 contradicts this.
    answer_c = "True"

    # Print the final answer in the required format.
    print(f"(a) {answer_a}; (b) {answer_b}; (c) {answer_c}")
