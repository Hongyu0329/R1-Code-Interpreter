    "Of course. Here is my plan to identify the three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid:\n\n1.  First, I will research which terrestrial rivers are explicitly named in Virgil's epic poem, the *Aeneid*. This involves identifying river names from the text and their real-world counterparts.\n2.  The key rivers mentioned include the **Nile** and the **Euphrates** (described on Aeneas's shield), the **Danube** (mentioned by its ancient name, **Ister**), the **Tigris**, the **Po** (mentioned by its mythical name, **Eridanus**), and the **Tiber**, which is central to the second half of the epic.\n3.  Next, I will find the modern accepted lengths of these rivers in kilometers.\n4.  Finally, I will write a Python script that stores this data, sorts the rivers by length in descending order, and prints the top three, along with their lengths, to determine the final answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_longest_rivers():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies the three longest rivers mentioned in Virgil's Aeneid.\n    The data is pre-compiled from literary and geographical sources.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Data: A list of prominent rivers mentioned in the Aeneid and their approximate lengths in km.\n    # The rivers and their mentions are:\n    # Nile: On Aeneas's shield (Book VIII)\n    # Danube: Mentioned as 'Ister' (Book III)\n    # Euphrates: On Aeneas's shield (Book VIII)\n    # Tigris: (Book VIII)\n    # Po: Mentioned as 'Eridanus' (Book VI)\n    # Hebrus: Thracian river (Book I)\n    # Tiber: The river of Rome, central to the story (multiple books)\n    # Scamander: River of Troy (multiple books)\n    \n    rivers_in_aeneid = [\n        (\"Nile\", 6650),\n        (\"Danube\", 2850),\n        (\"Euphrates\", 2800),\n        (\"Tigris\", 1900),\n        (\"Po\", 652),\n        (\"Hebrus\", 480),\n        (\"Tiber\", 406),\n        (\"Scamander\", 110)\n    ]\n\n    # Sort the rivers by length in descending order.\n    # The `key=lambda item: item[1]` tells the sort function to use the second element (length) for comparison.\n    sorted_rivers = sorted(rivers_in_aeneid, key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)\n    \n    # Get the top three longest rivers.\n    top_three_rivers = sorted_rivers[:3]\n    \n    print(\"The three longest rivers mentioned in the Aeneid are:\")\n    \n    # Print the name and length of each of the top three rivers.\n    for i, river in enumerate(top_three_rivers):\n        # The equation here is simply Rank = River: Length\n        print(f\"{i + 1}. {river[0]}: {river[1]} km\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    find_longest_rivers()\n```\n<<<The Nile, the Danube, and the Euphrates>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant.
