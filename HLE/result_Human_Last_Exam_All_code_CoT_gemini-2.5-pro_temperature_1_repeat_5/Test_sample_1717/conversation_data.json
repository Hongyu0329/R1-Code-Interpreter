    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Base Health:** I will first find the base health of the Eye of Cthulhu boss in Terraria's Expert Mode for a single player.\n2.  **Find the Scaling Formula:** Next, I will find the multiplayer health scaling formula used in Expert Mode. This formula dictates how the boss's health increases as more players join the game.\n3.  **Construct the Equation:** I will combine the base health and the scaling formula to create a single mathematical equation that calculates the boss's health for any given number of players, `N`.\n4.  **Analyze for Infinity:** Finally, I will analyze the behavior of this equation as the number of players (`N`) approaches infinity. This involves taking the mathematical limit of the function, which will reveal the theoretical maximum health.\n\nBased on this plan, here is the Python code to derive the answer.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_eoc_health():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and explains the theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu\n    in Terraria's Expert Mode with an infinite number of players.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Define the base health for the Eye of Cthulhu in Expert Mode.\n    # This value is from the game's source code for a single-player world.\n    base_expert_health = 3640\n\n    # Step 2: Define the multiplayer health scaling factor for Expert Mode.\n    # For each player beyond the first, the boss's health multiplier increases by 0.35.\n    per_player_increase = 0.35\n\n    # Step 3: Construct the full health formula based on the number of players (N).\n    # The formula is Health = BaseHealth * (1 + PerPlayerIncrease * (NumberOfPlayers - 1))\n    print(\"The formula for the Eye of Cthulhu's health (H) in Expert Mode with N players is:\")\n    print(f\"H(N) = {base_expert_health} * (1 + {per_player_increase} * (N - 1))\")\n\n    # To better analyze this, we can simplify the formula into a linear equation: y = mx + b\n    # H(N) = 3640 * (1 + 0.35*N - 0.35)\n    # H(N) = 3640 * (0.65 + 0.35*N)\n    # H(N) = (3640 * 0.65) + (3640 * 0.35) * N\n    # H(N) = 2366 + 1274 * N\n    constant_term = base_expert_health * (1 - per_player_increase)\n    linear_coefficient = base_expert_health * per_player_increase\n\n    print(\"\\nThis simplifies to the following linear equation:\")\n    print(f\"H(N) = {int(constant_term)} + {int(linear_coefficient)} * N\")\n\n    # Step 4: Analyze the formula as N (number of players) approaches infinity.\n    print(\"\\nTo find the theoretical maximum health, we must find the limit of this function as N approaches infinity:\")\n    print(f\"lim (N -> âˆž) [ {int(constant_term)} + {int(linear_coefficient)} * N ]\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nAs the number of players (N) grows infinitely large, the term '1274 * N' also grows infinitely large.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the total health increases without bound.\")\n    print(\"\\nThe theoretical maximum health of the Eye of Cthulhu is infinity.\")\n\ncalculate_eoc_health()\n```\n<<<infinity>>>"
