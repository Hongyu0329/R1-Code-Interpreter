    "The user wants me to analyze a Java program for a coding problem, determine its correctness, and provide an efficient solution.\n\n### Step-by-step thinking\n1.  **Analyze the provided Java code:**\n    *   The problem states there are four possible statements: `++X`, `X++`, `--X`, and `X--`.\n    *   The Java code uses `if (test.contains(\"++X\"))` and `if (test.contains(\"--X\"))`.\n    *   This logic completely ignores the cases `X++` and `X--`.\n    *   Therefore, the Java program is **incorrect** as it will not produce the right answer for inputs containing `X++` or `X--`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Answer Format (`Y` or `Nx+y`):**\n    *   Since the program is incorrect, the answer starts with `N`.\n    *   I need to find `x` (smallest number of character comparisons for 100 instructions) and `y` (smallest memory size in Bytes for 100 instructions).\n    *   To do this, I must design the most efficient possible solution, which is best modeled in a low-level language like C as requested by the prompt.\n\n3.  **Design the most efficient C solution:**\n    *   **Logic:** The key observation is that for all four statement types, the character at index 1 is unique to the operation.\n        *   `X++`: `+` at index 1\n        *   `++X`: `+` at index 1\n        *   `X--`: `-` at index 1\n        *   `--X`: `-` at index 1\n    *   Therefore, the most efficient algorithm is to read each 3-character statement and check only the character at index 1. If it's `+`, increment the result. Otherwise (it must be `-`), decrement the result.\n    *   **C Implementation Sketch:**\n        ```c\n        #include <stdio.h>\n        int main() {\n            int n, x = 0, i;\n            char s[4]; // Buffer for 3 chars + null terminator\n            scanf(\"%d\", &n);\n            for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n                scanf(\"%s\", s);\n                if (s[1] == '+') x++;\n                else x--;\n            }\n            printf(\"%d\\n\", x);\n            return 0;\n        }\n        ```\n\n4.  **Calculate `x` and `y` based on the C model:**\n    *   **`x` (Character Comparisons):** The loop runs 100 times for 100 instructions. Inside the loop, there is exactly one character comparison (`s[1] == '+'`). So, `x = 100 * 1 = 100`.\n    *   **`y` (Memory Size):** The variables needed are: `int n; int x; int i; char s[4];`. On a standard system where `int` is 4 bytes and `char` is 1 byte, the total memory is `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16` bytes. This is the minimal required memory. So, `y = 16`.\n    *   **Final Answer Prefix:** `N` + (`x` + `y`) = `N` + (100 + 16) = `N116`.\n\n5.  **Construct the final Python code:**\n    *   The prompt asks for a Python script. I will implement the efficient logic in Python.\n    *   To satisfy the instruction \"output each number in the final equation\", I will keep track of the number of increments and decrements and print the full calculation at the end.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function solves the Bit++ problem by reading from standard input.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Read the number of statements\n        n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n        \n        # Initialize variables\n        initial_value = 0\n        x = initial_value\n        increments = 0\n        decrements = 0\n        \n        # Process each statement\n        for _ in range(n):\n            statement = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n            if '+' in statement:\n                x += 1\n                increments += 1\n            else:\n                x -= 1\n                decrements -= 1 # Stored as a negative number for the equation\n                \n        # The problem asks for the final value of x.\n        # The instructions for me, the AI, ask to print the equation.\n        # The final equation is: initial_value + increments - decrements = final_value\n        # Note: decrements are stored as a negative, so we print it with a '+'\n        # e.g., 0 + 3 + (-2) = 1 is the same as 0 + 3 - 2 = 1\n        \n        # To match the format \"0 + {increments} - {decrements}\" we use abs()\n        print(f\"{initial_value} + {increments} - {abs(decrements)} = {x}\")\n\n    except (IOError, ValueError) as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\nsolve()\n```\n<<<N116>>>"
