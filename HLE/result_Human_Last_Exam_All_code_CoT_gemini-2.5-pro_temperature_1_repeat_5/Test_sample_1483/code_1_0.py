    # Step 1: Establish a lower bound.
    # A known theorem in continuum theory states that any nondegenerate decomposable
    # continuum must contain at least two regular proper subcontinua.
    # A regular subcontinuum S is a subcontinuum that equals the closure of its interior.
    # This means the answer cannot be 0 or 1.
    lower_bound = 2

    # Step 2: Show the lower bound is achievable.
    # We need to find an example of a continuum that has exactly two regular
    # proper subcontinua. Such a continuum can be constructed by taking the
    # one-point union of two pseudo-arcs (which are special hereditarily
    # indecomposable continua). Let this continuum be X = P1 U P2.
    # - P1 is a regular proper subcontinuum of X.
    # - P2 is a regular proper subcontinuum of X.
    # - It can be shown that no other proper subcontinuum of X is regular.
    # This construction confirms that a cardinality of 2 is possible.
    
    # Step 3: Conclude the result.
    # Since the cardinality must be at least 2, and we have an example where
    # the cardinality is exactly 2, the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
