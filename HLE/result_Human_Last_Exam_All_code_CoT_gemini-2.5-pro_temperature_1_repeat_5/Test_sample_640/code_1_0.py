def solve_scattering_statements():
    """
    Analyzes five statements about two-channel quantum scattering and identifies the correct ones.

    The analysis is based on the following principles:
    - A 'nontrivially coupled' matrix (V(r), F(E), or S(E)) is one that cannot be
      diagonalized by a single, constant similarity transformation for all its arguments (r or E).
    - If a potential V(r) is diagonal or 'trivially coupled' (diagonalizable by a
      constant matrix O), the Schrodinger equation can be decoupled by the same transformation.
      This implies that the resulting Jost matrix F(E) and scattering matrix S(E) will also
      be diagonal or trivially coupled by the same matrix O.
    - Inverse scattering theory implies that the potential V(r) is uniquely determined by the
      scattering data (which includes the Jost matrix F(E)). Therefore, the coupling properties
      of V(r) are fully encoded in F(E).

    # Statement 1: A nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled potential V(r).
    # Logic: This is the contrapositive of "If V(r) is not nontrivially coupled, then S(E) is not nontrivially coupled."
    # If V(r) is diagonal or trivially coupled, the system can be decoupled, and S(E) will also be
    # diagonal or trivially coupled. Thus, S(E) would not be nontrivially coupled. The contrapositive is true.
    statement_1_correct = True

    # Statement 2: A diagonal scattering matrix S(E) corresponds to a diagonal potential V(r).
    # Logic: This is false. Consider a trivially coupled potential V(r) = O^T * D(r) * O where D(r) = diag(v(r), v(r))
    # and O is a non-diagonal constant matrix. V(r) is not diagonal. However, the S-matrix S_D for the diagonal
    # potential D(r) will be S_D(E) = s(E)*I (a multiple of identity). The full S-matrix is S(E) = O^T * S_D(E) * O
    # = O^T * (s(E)*I) * O = s(E)*I, which is diagonal. So, a non-diagonal V(r) can produce a diagonal S(E).
    statement_2_correct = False

    # Statement 3: A nontrivially coupled potential V(r) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E).
    # Logic: From inverse scattering theory, F(E) encodes the full information about V(r). If F(E) were
    # diagonal or trivially coupled, the potential V(r) reconstructed from it would also be diagonal or
    # trivially coupled. Therefore, a nontrivially coupled V(r) must produce a nontrivially coupled F(E).
    statement_3_correct = True

    # Statement 4: A nontrivially coupled Jost matrix F(E) corresponds to a nontrivially coupled scattering matrix S(E).
    # Logic: The S-matrix is related to the Jost matrix (e.g., S = F(-k)F(k)^-1). This transformation
    # preserves the coupling structure. If F(E) were trivially coupled (F = O*D_F*O^-1), then S would also
    # be trivially coupled (S = O*D_S*O^-1). The contrapositive is that a nontrivially coupled S implies
    # a nontrivially coupled F. The statement itself is also true; a nontrivial F cannot produce a trivial S.
    statement_4_correct = True

    # Statement 5: There exist nontrivially coupled potentials V(r) with diagonal Jost matrices F(E).
    # Logic: This contradicts statement 3. A diagonal Jost matrix is a specific case of a non-nontrivially
    # coupled one. As per the logic for statement 3, a diagonal F(E) would correspond to a diagonal V(r),
    # which is not nontrivially coupled. Therefore, this statement is false.
