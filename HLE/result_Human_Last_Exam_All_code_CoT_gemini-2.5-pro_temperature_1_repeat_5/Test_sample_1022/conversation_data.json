    "To compute the dimension of the degree 4 bounded cohomology group of $T \\times T$ with trivial real coefficients, denoted as $\\dim H_b^4(T \\times T; \\mathbb{R})$, we will use the K端nneth formula for bounded cohomology. This formula relates the cohomology of a product of groups to the cohomology of the individual groups.\n\nOur plan is as follows:\n1.  **State the K端nneth Formula:** For two groups $G_1$ and $G_2$, given that their bounded cohomology groups are finite-dimensional, the dimension of the bounded cohomology of their product is given by:\n    $\\dim H_b^n(G_1 \\times G_2; \\mathbb{R}) = \\sum_{i+j=n} \\dim H_b^i(G_1; \\mathbb{R}) \\cdot \\dim H_b^j(G_2; \\mathbb{R})$.\n2.  **Find the dimensions for Thompson's group T:** We need the dimensions of the bounded cohomology groups of $T$, $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R})$, for various degrees $k$. Based on established mathematical results:\n    *   $\\dim H_b^0(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (as for any group).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^1(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ (since $T$ is a simple group, it is perfect).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^2(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 1$ (this space is generated by the bounded Euler class).\n    *   $\\dim H_b^k(T; \\mathbb{R}) = 0$ for all $k \\ge 3$.\n3.  **Apply the formula for n=4:** We will substitute these dimensions into the K端nneth formula with $G_1=G_2=T$ and $n=4$, and then calculate the sum.\n\nThe following Python code will execute this plan, showing each term of the final equation.\n\n```python\ndef get_dim_Hb_T(k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the dimension of the k-th bounded cohomology group of Thompson's group T\n    with trivial real coefficients.\n    \"\"\"\n    if k == 0:\n        return 1\n    if k == 2:\n        return 1\n    # For k=1 and k>=3, the dimension is 0.\n    return 0\n\ndef compute_dim_product(group_name, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the dimension of the n-th bounded cohomology group of G x G,\n    where G is the group specified by group_name.\n    \"\"\"\n    total_dim = 0\n    \n    # Build string representations for the calculation steps\n    sum_terms_str_list = []\n    sum_values_str_list = []\n    product_results_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        j = n - i\n        dim_i = get_dim_Hb_T(i)\n        dim_j = get_dim_Hb_T(j)\n        term_product = dim_i * dim_j\n        total_dim += term_product\n        \n        sum_terms_str_list.append(f\"dim H_b^{i}({group_name})*dim H_b^{j}({group_name})\")\n        sum_values_str_list.append(f\"{dim_i}*{dim_j}\")\n        product_results_list.append(str(term_product))\n\n    # Print the detailed calculation\n    print(f\"To compute the dimension of the degree {n} bounded cohomology group of {group_name} x {group_name}, we use the K端nneth formula:\")\n    print(f\"dim H_b^{n}({group_name} x {group_name}) = \" + \" + \".join(sum_terms_str_list))\n    print(f\"                   = \" + \" + \".join(sum_values_str_list))\n    print(f\"                   = \" + \" + \".join(product_results_list))\n    print(f\"                   = {total_dim}\")\n\n\n# Set the group name and the degree for the computation\nGROUP_NAME = \"T\"\nDEGREE = 4\n\ncompute_dim_product(GROUP_NAME, DEGREE)\n```\n<<<1>>>"
