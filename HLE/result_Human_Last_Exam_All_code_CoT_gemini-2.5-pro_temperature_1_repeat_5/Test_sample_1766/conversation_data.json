    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve the problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Quantum Numbers**: For a p-electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is `l=1`. As an electron is a fermion, its spin quantum number is `s=1/2`.\n2.  **Find Total Angular Momentum (j)**: The total angular momentum quantum number, `j`, is obtained by combining `l` and `s`. The possible values of `j` range from `|l-s|` to `l+s` in integer steps. This will give us the possible `j` values.\n3.  **Find Magnetic Quantum Number (m_j)**: For each value of `j`, the magnetic quantum number, `m_j`, can take values from `-j` to `+j` in integer steps.\n4.  **Calculate Eigenvalues**:\n    *   The eigenvalue of the operator $J^2$ for a state `|j, m_j>` is `j(j+1)ħ²`.\n    *   The eigenvalue of the operator $J_z$ for a state `|j, m_j>` is `m_jħ`.\n5.  **Generate Python Code**: I will write a Python script that performs these calculations. It will iterate through all possible `j` and `m_j` values and print the complete eigenvalue equations for each state, showing how the eigenvalues are calculated. I will use the `fractions` module to display the quantum numbers and eigenvalues clearly.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve for the eigenvalues:\n\n```python\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# Step 1: Explain the problem setup\nprint(\"This script solves for the common eigenvalues of J^2 and J_z for a p-electron.\")\nprint(\"A p-electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1.\")\nprint(\"An electron has spin quantum number s=1/2.\")\nprint(\"The total angular momentum J is the sum of orbital (L) and spin (S) angular momentum: J = L + S.\")\nprint(\"Since J^2 and J_z commute, we can find common eigenstates |j, m_j>.\")\nprint(\"-\" * 70)\n\n# Step 2: Define quantum numbers using the Fraction class for pretty printing\nl = 1\ns = Fraction(1, 2)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j\n# j ranges from |l-s| to l+s in integer steps.\nj_min = abs(l - s)\nj_max = l + s\n# In this specific case, the steps are of size 1, so we get two values.\nj_values = [j_min, j_max]\n\nprint(f\"Possible values for the total angular momentum quantum number j are: {[str(j) for j in j_values]}.\\n\")\n\n# Step 4: Iterate through all possible states |j, m_j> and print the eigenvalue equations\nprint(\"The eigenvalue equations for each common eigenstate |j, m_j> are:\")\nfor j in j_values:\n    # Calculate the eigenvalue for J^2, which is j*(j+1)\n    j2_eigenvalue = j * (j + 1)\n    \n    # Calculate the possible values for m_j, which range from -j to +j in steps of 1\n    current_mj = -j\n    mj_values = []\n    while current_mj <= j:\n        mj_values.append(current_mj)\n        current_mj += 1\n        \n    # Print the results for the current j-multiplet\n    for mj in mj_values:\n        # The eigenvalue for J_z is simply m_j\n        jz_eigenvalue = mj\n        \n        # Print the final equations with all numbers substituted\n        print(f\"\\nFor the state |j={j}, m_j={mj}>:\")\n        print(f\"  J^2 |{j}, {mj}> = {j}({j}+1)ħ^2 |{j}, {mj}> = {j2_eigenvalue}ħ^2 |{j}, {mj}>\")\n        print(f\"  J_z |{j}, {mj}> = {jz_eigenvalue}ħ |{j}, {mj}>\")\n```"
