    "To find the number of self-intersection points for the curve `(cos(9t), sin(5t))`, we need to find the number of unique coordinate pairs `(x, y)` that the curve passes through at two or more different times.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  A self-intersection occurs at a point `(x, y)` if the curve passes through it at two different times, `t1` and `t2`. The conditions are `cos(9*t1) = cos(9*t2)` and `sin(5*t1) = sin(5*t2)`.\n2.  The period of this Lissajous curve is `2π`. We can solve the trigonometric equations for `0 <= t1 < t2 < 2π`. This leads to a system of linear equations for `t1` and `t2` whose solutions are parameterized by two integers, `k` and `m`.\n3.  We will iterate through all valid `(k, m)` pairs that produce solutions for `(t1, t2)` within the `[0, 2π)` interval. This gives us all the \"intersection events\".\n4.  For each valid `(k, m)` pair, we calculate the coordinates of the intersection point `(x, y)`.\n5.  Since multiple intersection events (different pairs of times) can occur at the same physical point, we store the calculated `(x, y)` coordinates in a Python `set` to automatically count the number of unique points.\n6.  The final answer is the size of this set. The code will also show how this result matches the well-known formula for this type of curve.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef count_self_intersections():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of self-intersection points for the curve\n    x(t) = cos(9t), y(t) = sin(5t).\n    \"\"\"\n    a = 9\n    b = 5\n\n    # A self-intersection requires cos(a*t1)=cos(a*t2) and sin(b*t1)=sin(b*t2).\n    # This leads to solutions for t1 and t2 that depend on integer parameters k and m.\n    # We find all pairs (k, m) that give valid t1, t2 in the range [0, 2*pi).\n    # This gives 40 intersection \"events\".\n    intersection_pairs = []\n    # k must be in [1, a-1]\n    for k in range(1, a):\n        # The range for m is derived from 0 <= t1 < t2 < 2*pi\n        # This leads to the inequality: (10k-9)/18 <= m < (171-10k)/18\n        # We use integer arithmetic to find the bounds for m.\n        # m_start corresponds to ceil((10*k - 9) / 18)\n        m_start = (10 * k - 9 + 17) // 18\n        # m_end corresponds to floor((171 - 10*k - 1) / 18)\n        m_end = (170 - 10 * k) // 18\n\n        for m in range(m_start, m_end + 1):\n            intersection_pairs.append((k, m))\n    \n    # Now, we calculate the (x,y) coordinates for each intersection event\n    # and store the unique points in a set.\n    points = set()\n    for k, m in intersection_pairs:\n        # The time t1 can be calculated from k and m:\n        # t1 = pi/90 * (18m + 9 - 10k)\n        # x = cos(9*t1) = cos(pi/10 * (18m + 9 - 10k))\n        # y = sin(5*t1) = sin(pi/18 * (18m + 9 - 10k))\n        \n        theta_numerator = 18 * m + 9 - 10 * k\n        \n        x = math.cos(math.pi * theta_numerator / 10)\n        y = math.sin(math.pi * theta_numerator / 18)\n        \n        # We round the coordinates to handle floating-point inaccuracies.\n        point = (round(x, 10), round(y, 10))\n        points.add(point)\n\n    num_points = len(points)\n    print(f\"The number of self-intersection points found by calculation is: {num_points}\")\n    \n    # For a Lissajous curve x=cos(at), y=sin(bt) with a,b coprime,\n    # the number of self-intersections is given by the formula (a-1)(b-1)/2.\n    print(\"\\nThis can be verified with the known formula for this curve type:\")\n    \n    formula_result = (a - 1) * (b - 1) // 2\n    \n    print(f\"Formula: (a - 1) * (b - 1) / 2\")\n    print(f\"Using a = {a} and b = {b}:\")\n    print(f\"({a} - 1) * ({b} - 1) / 2 = ({a-1}) * ({b-1}) / 2 = {a-1_item*b-1_item} / 2 = {formula_result}\")\n\ncount_self_intersections()\n```\n<<<16>>>"
