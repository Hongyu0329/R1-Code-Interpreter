    "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree of depth 4. In the context of Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) matrices, a matrix operation like multiplication requires accessing the data associated with each node of the HSS tree. Therefore, the number of accessed submatrices is equal to the total number of nodes in the tree.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  An HSS tree with a depth of `d` has levels from 0 (the root) to `d` (the leaves). In this case, `d = 4`, so we have levels 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n2.  For a binary tree, the number of nodes at any given level `l` is `2^l`.\n3.  We will calculate the number of nodes for each level from 0 to 4.\n4.  The total number of accessed submatrices is the sum of the nodes at all these levels.\n5.  The Python code will perform this calculation and print the full equation and the final result.\n\n```python\ndef solve_hss_submatrices():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of submatrices accessed during a matrix multiplication\n    in a Hierarchical Semi-separable (HSS) tree of a given depth.\n\n    This corresponds to the total number of nodes in a complete binary tree of that depth.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the depth of the HSS tree\n    depth = 4\n\n    # The levels of the tree range from 0 to the specified depth\n    levels = range(depth + 1)\n\n    # Calculate the number of nodes (submatrices) at each level.\n    # At level l, there are 2^l nodes.\n    nodes_per_level = [2**l for l in levels]\n\n    # The total number of submatrices is the sum of nodes across all levels\n    total_submatrices = sum(nodes_per_level)\n\n    # Format the numbers for the final equation string\n    equation_parts = [str(n) for n in nodes_per_level]\n    equation_str = \" + \".join(equation_parts)\n\n    # Print the explanation and the final calculation\n    print(f\"For an HSS tree of depth {depth}, the number of submatrices accessed is the sum of nodes at each level (from 0 to {depth}).\")\n    print(\"The calculation is as follows:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_str} = {total_submatrices}\")\n\nsolve_hss_submatrices()\n<<<31>>>\n```"
