    print("  - Principle A: An anaphor (e.g., 'himself', 'herself') must have a co-referent antecedent in the same clause.")
    print("  - Principle B: A pronoun (e.g., 'he', 'she', 'it') must NOT have a co-referent antecedent in the same clause.")
    print("  - Principle C: An R-expression (a name like 'Mary' or a description like 'the dog') must be free, meaning it cannot be c-commanded by a co-referent antecedent anywhere.")
