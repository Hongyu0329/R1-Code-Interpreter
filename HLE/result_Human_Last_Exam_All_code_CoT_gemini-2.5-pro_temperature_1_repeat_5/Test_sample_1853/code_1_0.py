def calculate_gate_capacitance():
    """
    This function derives and prints the formula for the gate capacitance C_g.
    
    The derivation is based on the principles of the Quantum Hall effect in a system
    with specified degeneracies.

    The key steps are:
    1. The degeneracy factor g is 2 (for spin) * 2 (for valley) = 4.
    2. The voltage step (delta_V) to fill one complete Landau level is found from the
       experimental data (V1, 3*V1, 5*V1) to be 2*V1.
    3. The theoretical expression for this voltage step is delta_V = (g * e^2 * B) / (h * C_g).
    4. Equating the experimental and theoretical delta_V and solving for C_g.
