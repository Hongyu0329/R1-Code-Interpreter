    print("The conditions for a sequence A = <a_alpha : alpha < omega_1> are:")
    print("  - Each a_alpha is a countable subset of omega_1.")
    print("  - There exists a countable ordinal gamma < omega_1 such that for all alpha, |a_alpha intersect gamma| = omega.")
    print("\nWe want to find the order type of the set of uncountable cardinals in Y.")

    # --- Assumption for Contradiction ---
    print("\n--- STEP 1: Assumption for Contradiction ---")
    print("Assume the set of uncountable cardinals in Y is not empty.")
    print("This means there exists an uncountable cardinal kappa in Y.")
    print("By definition, this implies there is a sequence A and a set X with |X| = kappa such that:")
    print("  1. {a_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system with a FINITE root, r_fin.")
    print("  2. The sequence A satisfies the condition involving the countable ordinal gamma.")

    # --- The Proof ---
    print("\n--- STEP 2: Focus on the Intersections within gamma ---")
    print("Consider the family of sets B_X = {a_alpha intersect gamma : alpha in X}.")
    print("Since X is uncountable and gamma is countable, B_X is an uncountable family of infinite subsets of the countable set gamma.")

    print("\n--- STEP 3: Apply the Delta-System Lemma ---")
    print("By the Delta-System Lemma, there exists an uncountable subset X' of X and a root r_gamma such that for any distinct alpha, beta in X':")
    print("  (a_alpha intersect gamma) intersect (a_beta intersect gamma) = r_gamma.")

    print("\n--- STEP 4: Analyze the Structure of the Subfamily ---")
    print("The sets {(a_alpha intersect gamma) \\ r_gamma : alpha in X'} are pairwise disjoint and are all subsets of the countable set gamma.")
    print("A countable set cannot contain an uncountable family of non-empty disjoint sets.")
    print("Thus, there must be an uncountable subset X'' of X' for which (a_alpha intersect gamma) \\ r_gamma is empty for all alpha in X''.")
    print("This means that for all alpha in X'', we have a_alpha intersect gamma = r_gamma.")

    print("\n--- STEP 5: Determine the Nature of r_gamma ---")
    print("From the problem's premise, |a_alpha intersect gamma| = omega for all alpha.")
    print("Since a_alpha intersect gamma = r_gamma for all alpha in the uncountable set X'', it follows that |r_gamma| = omega.")
    print("This proves that r_gamma is an INFINITE set.")

    print("\n--- STEP 6: Derive the Contradiction ---")
    print("The family {a_alpha : alpha in X} is a Delta-system with a finite root r_fin.")
    print("Since X'' is an uncountable subset of X, the subfamily {a_alpha : alpha in X''} is also a Delta-system with the same finite root r_fin.")
    print("Let's take any two distinct alpha, beta from X''. Their intersection is r_fin:")
    print("  a_alpha intersect a_beta = r_fin.")
    print("However, we also know that their intersection must contain the intersection of their parts within gamma:")
    print("  a_alpha intersect a_beta >= (a_alpha intersect gamma) intersect (a_beta intersect gamma)")
    print("From Step 4, this simplifies to:")
    print("  a_alpha intersect a_beta >= r_gamma intersect r_gamma = r_gamma.")
    print("So, we must have r_fin >= r_gamma (as a superset).")

    print("\n--- STEP 7: The Final Contradiction ---")
    print("In Step 5, we proved r_gamma is an infinite set.")
    print("Since r_fin must contain r_gamma, r_fin must also be an infinite set.")
    print("This contradicts our initial assumption in Step 1 that r_fin is a finite root.")

    # --- Conclusion ---
    print("\n--- CONCLUSION ---")
    print("The assumption that an uncountable cardinal exists in Y has led to a contradiction.")
    print("Therefore, the set Y contains no uncountable cardinals.")
    print("This means the set Y \\ (omega U {omega}) is the empty set.")
