    Step 1: Understand the Problem
    Let R be the set of real numbers. The Stone-Cech compactification of R, denoted as beta(R), is the largest compact Hausdorff space containing R as a dense subspace. The Stone-Cech remainder is the set of points in beta(R) that are not in R, i.e., R* = beta(R) \\ R. Any continuous function f: R -> R can be uniquely extended to a continuous function F: beta(R) -> beta(R). A fixed point of F is a point p such that F(p) = p. We are looking for the smallest possible *nonzero* number of fixed points of F that lie in the remainder R*.

    Step 2: A Key Mathematical Result
    This problem is a known, and deep, question in topology. The solution relies on a theorem by the mathematician Eric van Douwen. The theorem states that if the extension F of a continuous function f: R -> R has any fixed points in the remainder R*, it must have at least two. This immediately tells us that the number of fixed points cannot be 1. Therefore, the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points must be at least 2.

    Step 3: Finding a Function with Exactly Two Fixed Points
    Now we need to check if the number 2 is achievable. We need to find a continuous function f: R -> R such that its extension F has exactly two fixed points in the remainder R*.
    A simple function that achieves this is f(x) = x + 1.

    Step 4: Analyzing the Fixed Points for f(x) = x + 1
    The remainder R* contains at least two special points, often denoted as p_(+inf) and p_(-inf), which represent the "ends" of the real line. A fixed point p for the extended function F satisfies F(p) = p.
    - To check if p_(+inf) is a fixed point, we examine the limit of f(x) as x approaches +infinity. Since lim_{x -> +inf} (x + 1) = +inf, the extension F maps p_(+inf) to itself. So, F(p_(+inf)) = p_(+inf).
    - Similarly, to check p_(-inf), we examine the limit of f(x) as x approaches -infinity. Since lim_{x -> -inf} (x + 1) = -inf, the extension F maps p_(-inf) to itself. So, F(p_(-inf)) = p_(-inf).
    - This shows that F has at least two fixed points in the remainder: p_(+inf) and p_(-inf).

    Step 5: Proving There Are No Other Fixed Points
    It can be proven that for f(x) = x + 1, there are no other fixed points in R*. The argument, in brief, is that any other fixed point would correspond to an ultrafilter containing a bounded set. However, the condition F(p) = p for f(x) = x + 1 would imply that this ultrafilter must contain an infinite number of pairwise disjoint bounded sets, which is a contradiction as an ultrafilter cannot contain two disjoint sets. Therefore, p_(+inf) and p_(-inf) are the only fixed points in the remainder.

    Step 6: Conclusion
    From Step 2, based on van Douwen's theorem, the minimum nonzero number of fixed points is at least 2.
    From Steps 4 and 5, we found an example, f(x) = x + 1, that has exactly 2 fixed points.
    Therefore, the smallest possible nonzero number of fixed points is 2.
