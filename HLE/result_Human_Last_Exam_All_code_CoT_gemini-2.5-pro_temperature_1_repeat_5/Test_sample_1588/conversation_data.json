    "To find the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10 in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansion, we can use a result from the theory of free Lie algebras. The number of independent BCH terms of a given order `n` corresponds to the dimension of the homogeneous subspace of degree `n` in a free Lie algebra on two generators (representing the operators `X` and `Y`).\n\nThis dimension is given by Witt's formula:\n`L_n(k) = (1/n) * Σ_{d|n} μ(d) * k^(n/d)`\n\nWhere:\n-   `n` is the order (degree), which is 10 for this problem.\n-   `k` is the number of generators, which is 2 (for `X` and `Y`).\n-   The sum `Σ` is over all positive divisors `d` of `n`.\n-   `μ(d)` is the Möbius function.\n\nThe plan is to implement this formula in Python:\n1.  Find all positive divisors of `n=10`.\n2.  For each divisor `d`, calculate the Möbius function `μ(d)`.\n3.  Calculate each term `μ(d) * k^(n/d)`.\n4.  Sum these terms.\n5.  Divide the total sum by `n=10` to get the final result.\n6.  The code will also print the final equation showing the calculation with all the numbers involved.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_prime_factorization(num):\n    \"\"\"Returns a dictionary of prime factors and their powers.\"\"\"\n    factors = {}\n    d = 2\n    temp = num\n    while d * d <= temp:\n        while (temp % d) == 0:\n            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1\n            temp //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp > 1:\n        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1\n    return factors\n\ndef mobius(n):\n    \"\"\"Calculates the Möbius function μ(n).\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return 1\n    factors = get_prime_factorization(n)\n    for p in factors:\n        if factors[p] > 1:\n            return 0\n    return (-1)**len(factors)\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of all positive divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    divs = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    return sorted(list(divs))\n\ndef solve_bch_order_10():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates and prints the number of nonzero coefficients of order 10\n    in the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = 10  # order\n    k = 2   # number of generators (X and Y)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(n)\n    total_sum = 0\n    \n    final_eq_parts = []\n    \n    for d in divisors:\n        mu_d = mobius(d)\n        power = n // d\n        base_val = k ** power\n        term_val = mu_d * base_val\n        total_sum += term_val\n        final_eq_parts.append(f\"({mu_d}) * {base_val}\")\n\n    result = total_sum // n\n    \n    final_equation = f\"(1/{n}) * ({' + '.join(final_eq_parts).replace('+ (-', '- (')}) = {result}\"\n\n    print(\"The number of nonzero coefficients is calculated using Witt's formula for a free Lie algebra.\")\n    print(\"For order n=10 and k=2 generators, the formula is:\")\n    print(f\"L_{n}({k}) = (1/{n}) * Σ_{{d|{n}}} μ(d) * {k}^({n}/d)\")\n    print(f\"\\nThe divisors of {n} are {divisors}.\")\n    print(\"The corresponding values for the Möbius function μ(d) are μ(1)=1, μ(2)=-1, μ(5)=-1, μ(10)=1.\")\n    print(\"\\nSubstituting these values into the formula gives the final equation:\")\n    print(final_equation)\n\nsolve_bch_order_10()\n```\n<<<99>>>"
