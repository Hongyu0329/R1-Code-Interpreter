    Solves the problem by analyzing the properties of the set F.
    
    The set F is defined by the equation F = union_{d in D} (F+d)/4.
    This equation defines F as a fixed point of a contraction mapping on the space of compact subsets of the unit square.
    
    Two solutions for F exist:
    1. The empty set: F = {}. In this case, there are 0 components. The number of non-degenerate,
       locally connected components is therefore 0.
    2. The attractor of the IFS: This is a non-empty set F_A. We can show that
       F_A is the product of a Cantor set C_x and the interval [0,1].
       The components of F_A are vertical lines {x} x [0,1] for each x in C_x.
       The number of such components is the number of points in the Cantor set, which is uncountably infinite.
       This is not a numerical answer.
       
    The question asks for the "smallest possible number". Comparing the two cases,
    the only case that yields a finite number is the one where F is the empty set.
