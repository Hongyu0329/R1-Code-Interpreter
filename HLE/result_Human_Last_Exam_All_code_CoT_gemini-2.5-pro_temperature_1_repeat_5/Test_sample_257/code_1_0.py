    print("Explanation: A GTO opponent's strategy is perfectly balanced and un-exploitable. Any 'information' you gain from their actions (like calling a bet) cannot be used to your advantage to deviate from your own GTO strategy, because their ranges are constructed to make you indifferent. The concept of betting to 'figure out where you're at' is an exploitative concept, not a GTO one.\n")
