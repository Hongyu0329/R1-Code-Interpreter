# Calculate and print the answers based on the reasoning above.

# Part a: Calculate the terminal bi-degree.
a_start = 4
b_start = 3
a_terminal = b_start
b_terminal = a_start

# The expression for part a is the tuple (a_terminal, b_terminal).
# The prompt requests to output each number in the final equation.
# Here, the numbers are the components of the resulting bi-degree.

# Part b: Formulate the condition on the indices r_i.
# This is a theoretical derivation, resulting in an expression.
answer_b_expr = "sum(r_i for i in 1..b) >= b"

# Part c: Determine if the construction is possible.
# Based on the existence of harmonic polynomials, the answer is Yes.
answer_c_expr = "Yes"

# Construct the final answer string in the specified format.
# For part a, we use the calculated numbers.
final_answer = f"a) ({a_terminal}, {b_terminal}) b) {answer_b_expr} c) {answer_c_expr}"
