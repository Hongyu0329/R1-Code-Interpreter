# The final answer is derived from the logical chain of events presented in the case study.
# Initial Condition: Mood Disorder (evidenced by family history and manic symptoms).
# Intervention: Prescription of a mood stabilizer, most likely Lithium.
# Consequence: A known side effect of Lithium is hypothyroidism.
# Final Symptom: A key symptom of hypothyroidism is sexual dysfunction.
# Final Equation of Events: Manic Symptoms + Lithium -> Hypothyroidism -> Sexual Dysfunction
# The answer is therefore A.
