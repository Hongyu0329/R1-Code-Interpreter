    "Of course. Here is my plan to determine the diet of adult Raphidiopterans:\n\n1.  I will first analyze the known feeding habits of adult Raphidioptera (snakeflies) based on entomological knowledge.\n2.  I will evaluate each answer choice against this information.\n3.  Adult snakeflies are known to be predatory, primarily feeding on other small, soft-bodied insects like aphids and mites. They are also known to supplement this diet with nectar and pollen.\n4.  I will check each option:\n    *   **A (Nectar):** This is a known supplemental food source.\n    *   **E (Aphids):** This is a known primary food source.\n    *   **B, C, D:** Māhoe, Karamū, and Totara are all native to New Zealand, where Raphidioptera are not found. Furthermore, they are not known to eat leaf tissue or fungus. These options are incorrect.\n5.  Since both A and E are correct, the best answer is the one that includes both.\n6.  The Python code below will print this analysis and present the final conclusion. It will also show how the individual correct choices combine to form the final answer, as requested.\n\n```python\ndef solve_raphidioptera_diet():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes the dietary habits of adult Raphidiopterans to answer the multiple-choice question.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Analyzing the diet of adult Raphidiopterans (snakeflies)...\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Fact 1: Predatory habits\n    analysis_predatory = \"Adult snakeflies are predators, feeding on soft-bodied insects like aphids.\"\n    print(\"Analysis for Choice E (Totara Aphids):\")\n    print(f\"  - {analysis_predatory}\")\n    print(\"  - Therefore, 'Aphids' are a primary food source. This choice is correct.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Fact 2: Supplemental diet\n    analysis_supplemental = \"They are also known to supplement their diet with pollen and nectar.\"\n    print(\"Analysis for Choice A (Nectar):\")\n    print(f\"  - {analysis_supplemental}\")\n    print(\"  - Therefore, 'Nectar' is a known food source.
