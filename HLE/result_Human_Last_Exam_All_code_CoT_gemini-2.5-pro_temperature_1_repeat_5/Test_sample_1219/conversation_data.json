    "To find the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100), we need to perform calculations with very high precision because 10^100 is an enormous number. Standard floating-point numbers are insufficient.\n\nHere is the plan:\n1.  The tangent function has a period of π. Therefore, `tan(x) = tan(x mod π)`. We will calculate `y = 10^100 mod π`.\n2.  This calculation requires a high-precision arithmetic library. We will use Python's built-in `decimal` module, which is suitable for this task.\n3.  We'll set the precision of the `decimal` module to be significantly higher than the number of digits in 10^100 to ensure the accuracy of the remainder `y`. A precision of 120 digits will be used.\n4.  Since the `decimal` module does not have trigonometric functions, we will implement `sin(x)` and `cos(x)` using their Taylor series expansions. `tan(y)` can then be computed as `sin(y) / cos(y)`. The Taylor series converges quickly for the value of `y`, which will be between 0 and π.\n5.  The code will show the intermediate values for `y = 10^100 mod π`, `sin(y)`, `cos(y)`, and the final `tan(y)` to make the process clear, as requested by the prompt to \"output each number in the final equation\".\n6.  Finally, we will extract and print the first 3 digits after the decimal point from the computed value of `tan(y)`.\n\n```python\nimport decimal\n\ndef calculate_tan_gogol():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the first 3 digits after the comma of tan(10^100) using high-precision arithmetic.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Set the precision for decimal calculations. 10^100 has 101 digits,\n    # so we need more precision for the modulus operation to be accurate.\n    # 120 digits should be sufficient for the required final precision.\n    prec = 120\n    decimal.getcontext().prec = prec\n\n    # A high-precision value of Pi is required.
