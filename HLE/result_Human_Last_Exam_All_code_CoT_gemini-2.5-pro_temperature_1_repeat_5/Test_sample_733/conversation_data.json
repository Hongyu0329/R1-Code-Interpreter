    "To find the number of finite groups containing maximal by inclusion product-free sets of size 2, we need to understand the definitions and then systematically check groups.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Define the terms:**\n    *   A **product-free set** `S` in a group `G` is a subset where for any `a, b` in `S` (including `a=b`), their product `ab` is not in `S`.\n    *   A product-free set `S` is **maximal by inclusion** if it's not a proper subset of any other product-free set in `G`. This means for any element `g` not in `S`, the set `S âˆª {g}` is no longer product-free.\n    *   We are looking for groups `G` that have such a set `S` where `|S| = 2`.\n\n2.  **Theoretical Bound:** This is a known problem in combinatorial group theory. A result by P. H. Diananda and H. P. Yap (1975) states that if a finite group `G` has a maximal product-free set of size 2, then the order of `G` must be less than or equal to 9. Their work also rules out all groups of order 8 and the cyclic group of order 9 (`Z_9`). The only candidate of order 9 is `Z_3 x Z_3`. This significantly narrows our search to groups of orders 4, 5, 6, 7, and the group `Z_3 x Z_3`.\n\n3.  **Systematic Check:** We can write a Python script to check all non-isomorphic groups within this narrowed-down range. The script will:\n    *   Represent the finite groups. The `sympy` library is suitable for this.\n    *   For each group, iterate through all possible pairs of non-identity elements to form a candidate set `S`.\n    *   Verify if `S` is product-free.\n    *   If it is, verify if `S` is maximal by inclusion.\n    *   Count the number of non-isomorphic groups that contain at least one such set.\n\n4.  **Implementation:** The Python code below implements this plan. It defines the candidate groups and applies the checking logic to each. Finally, it prints the names of the groups that satisfy the condition and the total count.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.permutations import Permutation\nfrom sympy.combinatorics.groups import PermutationGroup, CyclicGroup, DihedralGroup, KleinFourGroup, SymmetricGroup, AlternatingGroup\nfrom itertools import combinations\n\ndef has_maximal_product_free_set_of_size_2(G):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a given group G has a maximal product-free set of size 2.\n    \"\"\"\n    elements = list(G.elements)\n    # The set S cannot contain the identity element.\n    non_identity_elements = [el for el in elements if el != G.identity]\n\n    # We need at least two non-identity elements to form a set of size 2.\n    if len(non_identity_elements) < 2:\n        return False\n\n    # Iterate through all combinations of two distinct non-identity elements.\n    for s_tuple in combinations(non_identity_elements, 2):\n        s_set = set(s_tuple)\n        a, b = s_tuple\n\n        # 1.
