    "To find the greatest common right divisor (GCRD) of the two polynomial matrices P1 and P2, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. This method is analogous to finding the GCD of two integers.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Form an augmented matrix**: We stack the two matrices P1 and P2 vertically to form a single 4x2 matrix, `M = [P1; P2]`.\n2.  **Apply elementary row operations**: The goal is to simplify this matrix `M` using elementary row operations. The allowed operations are:\n    *   Swapping any two rows.\n    *   Multiplying a row by a non-zero constant.\n    *   Adding a polynomial multiple of one row to another row.\n3.  **Reduce to echelon form**: We'll perform these operations to reduce the matrix `M` into a form `[G; 0]`, where `G` is a 2x2 matrix and `0` is the 2x2 zero matrix.\n4.  **Identify the GCRD**: The resulting 2x2 non-zero matrix `G` at the top is the greatest common right divisor of P1 and P2. The GCRD is unique up to left-multiplication by a unimodular matrix (a polynomial matrix with a constant non-zero determinant).\n\nThe following Python code uses the `sympy` library to perform these symbolic manipulations and find the GCRD.\n\n```python\nimport sympy\n\ndef find_gcrd():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the Greatest Common Right Divisor (GCRD) of two polynomial matrices\n    P1 and P2 using the Euclidean algorithm via elementary row operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = sympy.Symbol('s')\n\n    # Define the polynomial matrices P1 and P2\n    P1 = sympy.Matrix([[s**2 + s, -s],\n                       [-s**2 - 1, s**2]])\n\n    P2 = sympy.Matrix([[s, 0],\n                       [-s - 1, 1]])\n\n    print(\"Given polynomial matrices:\")\n    print(\"P1(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P1)\n    print(\"\\nP2(s) =\")\n    sympy.pprint(P2)\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"=\"*30)\n    print(\"Finding the GCRD by reducing the stacked matrix M = [P1; P2]...\")\n\n    # Form the stacked matrix M\n    M = P1.col_join(P2)\n    \n    # We will perform a series of elementary row operations to reduce M.\n    # The operations are chosen to systematically zero out rows from the bottom up.\n\n    # Step 1: Use the '1' in M[3, 1] as a pivot to zero out the second column in other rows.\n    # M[0, :] = M[0, :] + s * M[3, :]\n    M[0, :] = sympy.expand(M[0, :] + s * M[3, :])\n    # M[1, :] = M[1, :] - s**2 * M[3, :]\n    M[1, :] = sympy.expand(M[1, :] - (s**2) * M[3, :])\n\n    # Step 2: Now M[0,:] is [0, 0] and M[1,:] is [s**3 - 1, 0].\n    # We apply the Euclidean algorithm for the polynomials in the first column of the\n    # remaining rows M[1,:] and M[2,:].\n    # Remainder of (s**3 - 1) / s is -1.\n    # M[1, :] = M[1, :] - s**2 * M[2, :]\n    M[1, :] = sympy.expand(M[1, :] - (s**2) * M[2, :])\n    \n    # Step 3: Now M[1,:] is [-1, 0]. This provides a constant pivot to clear the first column.\n    # M[2, :] = M[2, :] + s * M[1, :]\n    M[2, :] = sympy.expand(M[2, :] + s * M[1, :])\n    # M[3, :] = M[3, :] - (s + 1) * M[1, :]\n    M[3, :] = sympy.expand(M[3, :] - (s + 1) * M[1, :])\n    \n    # Step 4: The matrix is now reduced.
