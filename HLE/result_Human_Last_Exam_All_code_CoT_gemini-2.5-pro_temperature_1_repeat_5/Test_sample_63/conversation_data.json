    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is my plan to solve this riddle:\n\n1.  **Analyze the Clues:** I will break down the riddle into three key requirements:\n    *   The person was noted by the author Kurt Vonnegut.\n    *   The person is described as looking \"like a porcupine.\" This likely refers to wild, spiky, or unruly hair.\n    *   The name must be two words that both start with the same letter (alliteration).\n\n2.  **Evaluate Candidates:**\n    *   Kurt Vonnegut famously described **Albert Einstein** as looking like a porcupine due to his hair. However, \"Albert Einstein\" does not start with the same letter.\n    *   I will look for another historical figure who fits all three clues. In his book *A Man Without a Country*, Vonnegut mentions his love for America \"in the days of **Walt Whitman**.\"\n    *   Famous photographs of Walt Whitman show him with very large, wild, and unruly hair and a beard, which could be poetically described as \"porcupine-like.\"\n    *   Crucially, the name \"Walt Whitman\" satisfies the alliteration requirement, as both words start with 'W'.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** Walt Whitman is the best fit for all parts of the riddle.\n\n4.  **Code Generation:** I will now write a simple Python script to print the final answer.\n\n```python\n# This script solves the riddle by identifying the person who fits all the clues.\n# 1. Connection to Kurt Vonnegut: Vonnegut mentioned his admiration for the era of Walt Whitman.\n# 2. \"Porcupine\" appearance: Walt Whitman was known for his wild, unruly hair and beard.\n# 3. Alliterative name: \"Walt Whitman\" starts with two 'W's.\n\n# The name of the man is:\nprint(\"Walt Whitman\")\n```\n<<<Walt Whitman>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    As Kurt Vonnegut noted, this man looks like a porcupine in all the pictures.
