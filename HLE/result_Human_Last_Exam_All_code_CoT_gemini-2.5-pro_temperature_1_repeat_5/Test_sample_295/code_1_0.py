    Computes the reduced Euler characteristic of the complex Delta_k modulo k.

    The problem asks for chi_hat(Delta_k) mod k.
    Based on the analysis using group actions, this value is congruent to the
    reduced Euler characteristic of the fixed-point subcomplex, chi_hat(Delta_k^g),
    where g is a k-cycle.

    The fixed-point subcomplex consists of (k-1)/2 faces, each corresponding
    to an orbit of edges of a certain "length". Each of these faces contains k edges.

    The reduced Euler characteristic of the fixed-point subcomplex is given by:
    chi_hat(Delta_k^g) = sum_{i=1}^{(k-1)/2} (-1)^(k-1)

    Since k is a prime >= 3, k is odd, so k-1 is even. Thus, (-1)^(k-1) = 1.
    This simplifies the sum to (k-1)/2.

    Therefore, chi_hat(Delta_k) mod k is congruent to (k-1)/2.

        k: A prime number >= 3.
