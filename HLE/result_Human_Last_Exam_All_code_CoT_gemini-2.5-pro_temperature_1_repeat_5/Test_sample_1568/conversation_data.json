    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Analyze the full product:** I will first consider the infinite product starting from $n=1$, which I'll denote as $P_{full} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right)$. The product requested by the user, which starts from $n=3$, can then be easily found by dividing $P_{full}$ by its first two terms (the terms corresponding to $n=1$ and $n=2$).\n\n2.  **Factor the general term:** The core of the problem is to find a closed form for $P_{full}$. I will factor the general term $1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}$. Using the complex cube roots of unity, $\\omega = e^{i2\\pi/3}$ and $\\omega^2 = e^{i4\\pi/3}$, the factorization is:\n    $$1 - \\frac{z^3}{n^3} = \\left(1-\\frac{z}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega}{n}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z\\omega^2}{n}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Relate to the Gamma function:** After factorization, the full product $P_{full}$ becomes a product of three separate product terms. Each of these can be related to the Weierstrass product representation for the inverse of the Gamma function, which is a standard result in complex analysis:\n    $$\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-x)} = e^{\\gamma x} \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{x}{n}\\right) e^{x/n}$$\n    By carefully applying this formula to each of the three products and noting that the necessary convergence factors cancel each other out (since $1+\\omega+\\omega^2=0$), I can express $P_{full}$ in terms of Gamma functions. The result is a well-known identity:\n    $$P_{full} = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(1-z)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega)\\Gamma(1-z\\omega^2)}$$\n\n4.  **Adjust the starting index:** As established in the first step, the original product starting from $n=3$ is obtained by dividing $P_{full}$ by the terms for $n=1$ and $n=2$:\n    $$ \\prod_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{n^3}\\right) = \\frac{P_{full}}{\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{1^3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{z^3}{2^3}\\right)} $$\n\n5.  **Final Expression and Code:** Finally, I will substitute the expression for $P_{full}$ to get the final answer. The python code will then print this final symbolic result as a string, ensuring all the numbers from the original question are explicitly included in the output.\n\n```python\ndef solve_infinite_product():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function provides the symbolic solution to the given infinite product.\n    The solution is derived using the Weierstrass product representation of the Gamma function.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The infinite product from n=1 to infinity is 1 / (Gamma(1-z) * Gamma(1-z*omega) * Gamma(1-z*omega^2))\n    # where omega = exp(i*2*pi/3).\n    # The requested product starts from n=3, so we divide by the terms for n=1 and n=2.\n    \n    # Construct the denominator parts\n    n1_term = \"(1 - z^3/1^3)\"\n    n2_term = \"(1 - z^3/2^3)\"\n    gamma_z = \"Gamma(1 - z)\"\n    gamma_z_omega = \"Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*2*pi/3))\"\n    gamma_z_omega2 = \"Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*4*pi/3))\"\n    \n    # Assemble the final expression\n    # Note that all numbers from the original expression (3, 1, 2) are present.\n    final_expression = f\"1 / ({n1_term} * {n2_term} * {gamma_z} * {gamma_z_omega} * {gamma_z_omega2})\"\n    \n    print(final_expression)\n\nsolve_infinite_product()\n```\n<<<1 / ((1 - z^3/1^3) * (1 - z^3/2^3) * Gamma(1 - z) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*2*pi/3)) * Gamma(1 - z*exp(i*4*pi/3)))>>>"
