    "To determine the number of colors observed in pure allotropes of phosphorus, I will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Identify the major allotropes of phosphorus:** I will list the most common and distinct structural forms of phosphorus.\n2.  **List the colors for each allotrope:** Each allotrope has a characteristic color or set of colors.\n    *   White phosphorus is a waxy solid that is typically white but can appear yellow due to impurities or degradation, so it accounts for two colors.\n    *   Red phosphorus is red.\n    *   Violet phosphorus (also known as Hittorf's phosphorus) is violet.\n    *   Black phosphorus, the most stable form, is black.\n3.  **Sum the counts:** I will add up the number of distinct colors from all the allotropes. The code will represent these allotropes and their colors, print the breakdown, and then calculate the total sum.\n\n```python\ndef count_phosphorus_colors():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates and prints the number of observable colors\n    in the pure allotropes of phosphorus.\n    \"\"\"\n    # A dictionary mapping phosphorus allotropes to their observed colors.\n    # White phosphorus can be white or yellow.\n    allotropes_and_colors = {\n        \"White Phosphorus\": [\"white\", \"yellow\"],\n        \"Red Phosphorus\": [\"red\"],\n        \"Violet Phosphorus\": [\"violet\"],\n        \"Black Phosphorus\": [\"black\"]\n    }\n\n    print(\"The main allotropes of phosphorus and their colors are:\")\n    \n    all_colors = []\n    counts_per_allotrope = []\n\n    # Iterate through the dictionary to display the information and collect counts.\n    for allotrope, colors in allotropes_and_colors.items():\n        print(f\"- {allotrope}: {len(colors)} color(s) ({', '.join(colors)})\")\n        counts_per_allotrope.append(str(len(colors)))\n        all_colors.extend(colors)\n\n    # Calculate the total number of colors.\n    total_colors = len(all_colors)\n\n    # Create the equation string as requested.\n    equation_string = \" + \".join(counts_per_allotrope)\n\n    print(\"\\nThe total number of colors is the sum of the number of colors for each allotrope:\")\n    print(f\"{equation_string} = {total_colors}\")\n\n# Execute the function.\ncount_phosphorus_colors()\n<<<5>>>\n```"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How many colors can be observed in pure allotropes of phosphorous?\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
