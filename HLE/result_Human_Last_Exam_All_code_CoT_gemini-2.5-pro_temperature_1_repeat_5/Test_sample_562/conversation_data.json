    "The radical for the character 謄 is 言. When a radical appears on the left side of a character, it is called a \"hen\" (偏). The reading for the 言 radical is \"gon\". Therefore, its name is \"Gonben\".\n\n```python\n# The user wants to know the radical (bushu) of the kanji 謄.\n# 1. Deconstruct the kanji 謄. It is composed of 言 on the left and 朕 on the right.\n# 2. Identify the radical. The radical is the part that classifies the character, which is 言 in this case.\n# 3. Find the name of the radical. The radical 言 is called \"gonben\" (ごんべん). \"Gon\" is the reading of the character 言, and \"ben\" (from \"hen\") indicates it's on the left side of the kanji.\n# 4. Transcribe the name into Hepburn romanization. ごんべん is \"Gonben\".\n# 5. Print the final answer.\n\nradical_name = \"Gonben\"\nprint(radical_name)\n```\n<<<Gonben>>>"
