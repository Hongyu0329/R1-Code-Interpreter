# Step 1: Define Y1 based on the analysis of Clue 1.
# The clue points to Charles Martin Hall's patent year for aluminum production.
Y1 = 1886

# Step 2: Define Y4 based on the analysis of Clue 3.
# The clue points to the components of the Heck Reaction.
# Y4 is derived from the mass number of the most abundant isotope of the Palladium (Pd) catalyst.
Y4 = 106

# Step 3: Calculate the ratio of Y4 to Y1 as requested.
result = Y4 / Y1

# Step 4: Print the final equation and the result.
# The final print statement includes each number in the equation.
print(f"The values derived from the clues are Y1 = {Y1} and Y4 = {Y4}.")
print(f"The calculation of the ratio Y4 to Y1 is: {Y4} / {Y1} = {result}")

# Final Answer Format
print(f"<<<{result}>>>")
