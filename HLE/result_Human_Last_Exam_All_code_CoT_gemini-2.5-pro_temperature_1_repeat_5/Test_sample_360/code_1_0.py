    # Step 1: Define the structure of the product complex [Ru(bpy)(L)Cl]+
    # The complex is octahedral with a central Ru(II) ion.
    # Ligands:
    # L: A symmetric, tridentate ligand that coordinates meridionally (mer).
    # bpy: A bidentate ligand.
    # Cl: A monodentate ligand.

    # Step 2: Analyze the arrangement of ligands.
    # We fix the mer-L ligand. This leaves 3 adjacent (cis) coordination sites.
    # Due to the symmetry of the Ru-L fragment, these 3 sites are not all identical.
    # Let the central N of L be N_central.
    # - 1 site is trans to N_central.
    # - 2 sites are cis to N_central and are equivalent to each other.

    # Step 3: Count the isomers based on the position of the Cl ligand.

    # Case 1: The Cl ligand is trans to the central nitrogen of the tridentate ligand L.
    # In this case, the bidentate bpy ligand occupies the two remaining equivalent sites.
    # The resulting molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral (meso).
    meso_isomers = 1
    print(f"Number of achiral (meso) isomers: {meso_isomers}")

    # Case 2: The Cl ligand is cis to the central nitrogen of the tridentate ligand L.
    # This arrangement is chiral (lacks a plane of symmetry).
    # It exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).
    enantiomeric_isomers = 2
    print(f"Number of chiral isomers (enantiomers): {enantiomeric_isomers}")

    # Step 4: Calculate the total number of isomers.
    total_isomers = meso_isomers + enantiomeric_isomers

    # Output the final equation and the total count.
    print("\nThe final equation is:")
    print(f"{meso_isomers} + {enantiomeric_isomers} = {total_isomers}")
    print(f"\nTotal number of isomers formed: {total_isomers}")
