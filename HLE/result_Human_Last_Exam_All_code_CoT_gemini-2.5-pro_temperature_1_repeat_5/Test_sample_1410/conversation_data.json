    "This is a classic chess puzzle. The provided FEN string `4r1k1/ppp2pp1/2n4p/3QN1qB/3P4/2P4P/PP4P1/4rRK1 w - - 0 20` describes an illegal position, as the side to move (White) is currently in check from Black's rook on e1. In such composed problems, this illegality is often a hint that one should look for a brilliant and forcing sequence, assuming the check can be ignored for the first move.\n\nThe most forceful line for White is a spectacular smothered mate sequence. Here is the step-by-step plan to find the solution:\n1.  Assume White can ignore the check from the Black rook on e1 for one move.\n2.  White starts with a check `1. Qxf7+`, forcing the Black king to `h7`.\n3.  White continues the attack with a series of checks, forcing Black's responses at each step.\n4.  The sequence culminates in a queen sacrifice, followed by a smothered checkmate delivered by the knight.\n5.  By counting the number of moves White makes in this forced sequence, we can determine the answer.\n\nThe script below will print the full winning line move by move.\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess_puzzle():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function prints the step-by-step solution to the chess puzzle.\n    The solution is a forced checkmate sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    winning_sequence = [\n        \"1.
