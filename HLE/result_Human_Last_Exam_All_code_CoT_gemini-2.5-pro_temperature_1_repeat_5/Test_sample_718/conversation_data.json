    "This is a problem in the representation theory of algebras. I will solve it by connecting the given information (upper semilattice, tame functor) to known theorems about the homological dimensions of the associated algebras.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Interpret the setup**: I will first explain the connection between the poset `J` being an upper semilattice and the representation type of the category of functors `f: J -> Vect_K`.\n2.  **Introduce Homological Algebra**: I will connect the category of functors to a module category over an algebra, `KJ`, and discuss its properties. Specifically, I will identify the type of algebra `KJ` is.\n3.  **Use a Key Theorem**: I will state a theorem about the global dimension of this type of algebra.\n4.  **Define n-resolvability**: I will define what it means for a functor to be `n`-resolvable in terms of its projective dimension.\n5.  **Synthesize and Solve**: By combining the global dimension of the algebra with the definition of `n`-resolvability, I will determine the value of `n` that satisfies the condition for all functors.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve_representation_theory_problem():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the user's question about n-resolvability of a tame functor\n    by laying out the chain of reasoning from established theorems in\n    representation theory.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(\"Here is the step-by-step reasoning to find the value of n:\")\n    print(\"-\" * 60)\n\n    # Step 1: Explain the connection between upper semilattices and tame representation type.\n    print(\"Step 1: The significance of J being an upper semilattice\")\n    print(\"A finite poset J defines a category of representations, Fun(J, Vect_K).\")\n    print(\"A fundamental result in representation theory states that this category is of 'tame' representation type\")\n    print(\"if and only if J is an upper semilattice.
