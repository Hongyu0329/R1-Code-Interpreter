    "Here is my thinking process to arrive at the answer:\n\n1.  **Analyze the User's Request:** The user wants to know the Modern English word for \"sister\" if the Norse (Viking) influence on the English language had not occurred. The answer should be presented within a Python code block that prints the result and the explanation.\n\n2.  **Identify the Current Word's Origin:** I first need to determine the origin of the word we use today, \"sister\". A quick etymological check confirms that \"sister\" comes from the Old Norse word `systir`. This word was adopted into English during the period of Viking raids and settlement in England (roughly 8th to 11th centuries), and it eventually replaced the native Old English word.\n\n3.  **Find the Original Old English Word:** Since the Norse word replaced a native word, I must find what that native word was. The Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for \"sister\" was `sweostor`. This word is of Proto-Germanic origin (*swestēr*), making it a direct relative of words in other Germanic languages.\n\n4.  **Hypothesize the Linguistic Evolution:** Now, the core of the task is to trace the probable evolution of `sweostor` into Modern English, assuming no Norse interference. I'll apply known patterns of sound change that occurred between Old English and Modern English:\n    *   **Vowel Simplification:** The Old English diphthong `eo` in `sweostor` would have likely simplified. Looking at other words, this `eo` sound often became a simple `e`. For example, the Old English `seofon` became `seven`.\n    *   **Loss of Unstressed Syllables:** The unstressed ending `-or` would likely have been reduced or dropped entirely over time, a very common process in the development of English. For instance, Old English `brōþor` became `brother`, where the final sound was kept but altered. In `sweostor`, the simplification to `swester` seems highly probable.\n    *   **The Great Vowel Shift:** This major sound change affected long vowels. If the resulting Middle English word was `swester` (with a short 'e' sound, as in 'seven'), it would not have been affected by the Great Vowel Shift and would likely have retained its pronunciation, leading directly to the modern form \"swester\".\n\n5.  **Look for Supporting Evidence (Cognates):** To check if this hypothesis is reasonable, I can look at the word for \"sister\" in other West Germanic languages that did not have the same level of Norse influence.\n    *   German: *Schwester*\n    *   Dutch: *zuster*\n    *   West Frisian: *suster*\n    These cognates all developed from the same Proto-Germanic root and look very similar to the hypothesized `swester`. This strengthens the conclusion that \"swester\" is the most likely outcome.\n\n6.  **Construct the Python Code:** Based on the prompt's requirements, I will create a Python script.\n    *   The script will not perform calculations but will use `print()` statements to present the information clearly.\n    *   It will explain the origin of \"sister\".\n    *   It will state the original Old English word `sweostor`.\n    *   It will explain the likely evolution into `swester`.\n    *   Finally, it will print the concluding answer. The strange instruction about \"each number in the final equation\" is clearly a template error from the prompt and doesn't apply to this linguistic question, so I will ignore it and focus on providing a clear answer to the actual problem.\n\nThis step-by-step process, moving from the current word back to its origins and then projecting a hypothetical future based on known linguistic rules and comparative evidence, allows for a well-reasoned and confident answer.\n\n```python\nimport textwrap\n\ndef find_hypothetical_word():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function explains and determines the Modern English word for 'sister'\n    if the Norse influence on the English language had not occurred.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # 1. The current word \"sister\" comes from Old Norse \"systir\".\n    # This word replaced the native Old English word due to Viking invasions.\n    old_norse_word = \"systir\"\n\n    # 2. The original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word was \"sweostor\".\n    # This is a native Germanic word.\n    old_english_word = \"sweostor\"\n\n    # 3. To find the modern equivalent, we trace the likely evolution of \"sweostor\".\n    # - The initial vowel sound 'eo' would likely have simplified to 'e', similar\n    #   to how Old English 'seofon' became 'seven'.\n    # - The unstressed ending '-or' would likely have been dropped or reduced.\n    # This process would result in the Middle English form 'swester'.\n    # - This word would likely have survived into Modern English, much like its\n    #   German cognate \"Schwester\" did.\n    hypothetical_modern_english_word = \"swester\"\n\n    # Print the explanation\n    explanation = f\"\"\"\nThe modern English word 'sister' is derived from the Old Norse word '{old_norse_word}'. This word was adopted into the language during the Viking Age and eventually replaced the native Old English term.\n\nThe original Old English (Anglo-Saxon) word for sister was '{old_english_word}'.\n\nIf the language had evolved without this Norse influence, '{old_english_word}' would have followed the natural sound changes of English. It would have likely simplified to a form like '{hypothetical_modern_english_word}', similar to how its cognate in German became 'Schwester'.\n\nTherefore, the Modern English word for 'sister' would most likely be:\n    \"\"\"\n    print(textwrap.dedent(explanation).strip())\n    print(f\"\\n{hypothetical_modern_english_word}\")\n\nfind_hypothetical_word()\n```\n<<<swester>>>"
