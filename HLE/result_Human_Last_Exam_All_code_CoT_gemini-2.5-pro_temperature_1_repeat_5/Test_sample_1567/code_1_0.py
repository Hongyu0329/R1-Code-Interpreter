# The reasoning behind the solution is based on mathematical principles
# and does not require a computational simulation. The core argument is that
# for d>=3, a mean-zero random walk with bounded increments is always
# transient, regardless of the control strategy. Here's a brief explanation
# in the context of code.

# Let's imagine we could simulate the walk.
# At each step `n`, we have a position `X_n`.
# We choose a measure `nu_i` from a set of `k` measures.
# The step `Y` is drawn from `nu_i`.
# `X_{n+1} = X_n + Y`

# The key insight is to look at the expected squared distance from the origin.
# E[|X_{n+1}|^2] = E[|X_n|^2] + E[tr(Cov(nu_i))]

# Since nu_i is genuinely d-dimensional, tr(Cov(nu_i)) is always positive.
# Let `c_i = tr(Cov(nu_i))`. There is a minimum `c_min > 0`.
# So, E[|X_n|^2] > n * c_min.

# The mean squared distance grows at least linearly.
# In dimensions d>=3, this implies the walk is transient.
# This means the probability of returning to the origin tends to 0.

# This holds for any finite number of measures, k.
# Therefore, for any k, we are not able to guarantee a return to the origin.
# The question asks for the maximal such k. Since this is true for all finite k,
# the answer is infinity.

# The code representation of infinity is float('inf').
# However, the problem asks for the answer as a string if it is "infinity".

# This is a conceptual problem, so the 'code' is just to print the final answer.
# The logic is explained above.

final_answer = "âˆž"
print(f"The maximal k such that, for any choice of such measures, we are not able to guarantee (with probability 1) that the controlled random walk will return to the origin is {final_answer}.")
print("This is because for d>=3, any such controlled random walk is transient.")
