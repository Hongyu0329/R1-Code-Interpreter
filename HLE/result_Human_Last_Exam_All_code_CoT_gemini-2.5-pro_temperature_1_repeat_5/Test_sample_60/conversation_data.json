    "To determine which Turing Machine runs for the most steps, I will write a Python script to simulate each one.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Parse the Rules:** I'll interpret each machine's definition string. The string consists of rule-parts for states A, B, C, D, and E, in that order. For each state, the first rule-part is for when the machine reads a '0', and the second is for when it reads a '1'. A rule-part like `B1L` means \"change to state B, write a 1, and move the head Left\".\n2.  **Build a Simulator:** I will create a universal Turing Machine simulator. This simulator will manage the machine's state, the head's position, and the tape's contents. The tape will be treated as an infinite strip of cells, all initially containing '0'.\n3.  **Execute and Count:** The script will run a simulation for each of the three machines, starting from an empty tape. It will count every single step (a read-write-move-state_change cycle) until the machine enters the 'H' (halt) state.\n4.  **Compare and Report:** After running all simulations, the script will compare the total step counts. It will then print a summary of the steps for each machine and declare which one ran for the longest time, along with its step count.\n\nThis method will provide a definitive answer based on a direct simulation of the provided machines.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef simulate_turing_machine(rule_string):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a 5-state, 2-symbol Turing machine based on a rule string.\n\n    The machine starts in state 'A' with the head at position 0 on an\n    infinite tape of 0s.
