    This problem asks for the number of homeomorphism classes of compact connected 
    metric spaces with a disconnection number of four.

    Step 1: Analyze the definition of disconnection number.
    The disconnection number D(X) is the smallest integer D such that removing ANY D 
    points disconnects the space X. This implies there exists a set of D-1 points 
    whose removal leaves X connected.

    Step 2: Apply the definition to finite graphs.
    Let G be a connected graph with n vertices. A graph is a compact connected metric space.
    - If we remove n vertices, we are left with an empty graph, which is disconnected.
    - If we remove any n-1 vertices, we are left with a single-vertex graph, which is connected.
    - This means that for any connected graph with n vertices, the disconnection number is n.

    Step 3: Relate to the problem.
    We are given that the disconnection number is 4. Based on the reasoning above,
    if the space is a finite graph, it must have exactly 4 vertices. The problem is 
    now reduced to finding the number of non-isomorphic connected graphs on 4 vertices.

    Step 4: Solve the graph enumeration problem with code.
    We will programmatically generate all graphs on 4 vertices, check for connectivity,
    and then count the number of unique isomorphism classes.
