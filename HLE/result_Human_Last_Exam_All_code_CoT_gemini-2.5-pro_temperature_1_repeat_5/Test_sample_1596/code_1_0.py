    # Analysis of each statement based on quaternion properties.
    # A: False. The inner product depends on the relative position (n-m), not its absolute value |m-n|.
    # B: False. Quaternion multiplication is not generally commutative, so the equality does not hold.
    # C: True. A fixed rotation axis is necessary for the composition property R_m * R_n = R_{m+n} to hold.
    # D: False. The scheme uses a scalar position 'm', thus encoding a 1D position.
    # E: True. The rotation quaternion R_m has a norm of 1, so it preserves the norm of the vector it rotates.
    # F: True. Real scalars commute with quaternions, so the operation is linear.
    # G: True. The rotation is an isometry represented by an orthogonal matrix, which preserves inner products and thus orthogonality.
    # H: True. The composition follows the law R_m * R_n = R_{m+n}, analogous to complex number rotation.
    # J: True. R_m and R_n commute because they share the same rotation axis, making their commutator [R_m, R_n] equal to 0. The zero quaternion is purely imaginary.
    # K: False. The real component of the rotated vector is generally not preserved.
    # L: True. The trace of the 4x4 matrix representation of R_m is 4 times its real part, which is 4*cos(m*theta).
    # M: False. The commutator is zero for any fixed rotation axis, not just a specific one.
    # N: False. The magnitude of the rotated vector is always 1 (for a unit vector v), so the limit is 1.
