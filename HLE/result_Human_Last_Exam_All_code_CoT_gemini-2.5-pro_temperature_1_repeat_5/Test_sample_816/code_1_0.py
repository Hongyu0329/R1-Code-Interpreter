    print("   - Arises from density differences due to heat. Hotter, less dense metal rises.")
    print("   - Generally a weak force in GTAW and does not primarily drive strong inward surface flow.")

    print("\nD. Lorentz (electromagnetic) Force:")
    print("   - Arises from the interaction of welding current and its magnetic field.")
    print("   - Tends to drive fluid down at the center and outward along the surface.")
    print("   - This is opposite to the observed inward flow.")

    print("\nC. Arc Pressure Force:")
    print("   - The pressure from the plasma jet depresses the center of the weld pool.")
    print("   - This force mainly affects the shape of the pool surface, and any resulting flow is generally outward.")

    print("\nB. Arc drag Force:")
    print("   - The shear force from the plasma gas flowing over the surface.")
    print("   - This force pushes the molten metal radially outward from the center.")
    print("   - This is opposite to the observed inward flow.")

    print("\nA. Marangoni Force (Surface Tension Convection):")
    print("   - Arises from a gradient of surface tension on the liquid surface.")
    print("   - The flow direction depends on the temperature coefficient of surface tension (dγ/dT).")
    print("   - For most pure metals, dγ/dT is negative, meaning surface tension is highest at the cooler edges, causing an OUTWARD flow.")
    print("   - **CRITICAL POINT:** 304 stainless steel contains surface-active elements like sulfur. These elements can cause the temperature coefficient of surface tension to become POSITIVE (dγ/dT > 0).")
    print("   - With a positive dγ/dT, surface tension is highest in the hottest part of the pool (the center).")
    print("   - This high surface tension at the center pulls the liquid from the outer, cooler regions INWARD.")
    print("-" * 50)
    print("Conclusion: The inward flow observed in stainless steel is a classic example of Marangoni convection driven by a positive surface tension gradient caused by surfactants. Therefore, the Marangoni Force is the dominant mechanism.")
