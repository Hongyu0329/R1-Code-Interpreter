    "To determine if free-standing boron nanosheets would be expected to exhibit spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC), I will develop a Python script. This approach allows me to structure the scientific reasoning in a logical, step-by-step manner, as requested.\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n1.  **Establish the Physical Principles:** The script will first print the fundamental physical requirements for a material to exhibit SPDC. This primarily involves having a non-centrosymmetric crystal structure, which allows for a second-order nonlinear optical response ($\\chi^{(2)}$).\n2.  **Analyze Boron Nanosheets:** The script will then discuss the nature of boron nanosheets (borophene), highlighting that they exist in multiple different structures, known as polymorphs.\n3.  **Evaluate Specific Cases:** I will use a Python dictionary to store the properties of a few representative borophene polymorphs. The script will iterate through these cases to show that the potential for SPDC is dependent on the specific atomic arrangement.\n4.  **Synthesize and Conclude:** Based on the analysis, the script will print a final conclusion, answering whether SPDC can be expected from this class of materials.\n\nThis method uses a Python script to present a well-reasoned scientific argument, fulfilling the requirements of the prompt.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef analyze_spdc_in_boron_nanosheets():\n    \"\"\"\n    This script analyzes the potential for free-standing boron nanosheets\n    to exhibit Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) by evaluating\n    the underlying physics principles.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    print(\"--- Analysis of Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion (SPDC) in Boron Nanosheets ---\")\n    \n    # Step 1: Explain the fundamental requirements for the SPDC process.\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Define the Physical Requirements for SPDC\")\n    print(\"Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion is a second-order nonlinear optical process.\")\n    print(\"For a material to exhibit SPDC, it must satisfy key conditions:\")\n    condition_1_symmetry = \"1.
