    "The Second Great War in StarCraft lore begins with the Brood War in the year 2500 and concludes with the end of the Legacy of the Void epilogue in the year 2506.\n\nHere is the plan to calculate the duration:\n1.  Define the start year (2500) and the end year (2506).\n2.  Subtract the start year from the end year to find the total duration.\n3.  Use Python's `math.ceil` function to round the result up, as requested.\n4.  Print the full equation and the final rounded-up duration.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# The Second Great War begins with the Brood War and ends after the Legacy of the Void epilogue.\nstart_year = 2500\nend_year = 2506\n\n# Calculate the duration\nduration = end_year - start_year\n\n# Round up the duration as requested\nfinal_duration = math.ceil(duration)\n\n# Print the explanation and the final equation\nprint(\"The Second Great War in StarCraft lore began in the year 2500 and concluded in 2506.\")\nprint(f\"To find the duration, we subtract the start year from the end year.\")\nprint(f\"Final Equation: {end_year} - {start_year} = {duration}\")\nprint(f\"The total duration rounded up is {final_duration} years.\")\n```\n<<<6>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    How long was the Second Great War in StarCraft Lore (in years, rounded up)\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
