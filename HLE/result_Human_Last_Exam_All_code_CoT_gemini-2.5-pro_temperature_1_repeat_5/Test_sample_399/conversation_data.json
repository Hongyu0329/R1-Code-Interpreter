    "Of course, I can help with that. Here is the plan to solve the initial value problem:\n\n1.  **Separate Variables**: The given ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a separable equation. I will rearrange the equation to have all terms involving `x` on one side and all terms involving `t` on the other.\n2.  **Integrate**: I will integrate both sides of the separated equation to find the general solution.\n3.  **Apply Initial Condition**: Using the initial condition `x(0) = -8`, I will solve for the constant of integration, `C`, to find the particular solution.\n4.  **Solve for x(1)**: With the particular solution, I will substitute `t=1` to find the value of `x(1)`.\n5.  **Code the Solution**: I will write a Python script that programmatically follows these steps, prints out the components of the final calculation, and provides the final numerical answer.\n\n```python\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\n# The initial value problem is x'(t) = (t-1) * x^2(t), with x(0) = -8.\n# This is a separable differential equation.
