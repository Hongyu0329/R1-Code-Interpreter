    "My plan to solve this problem is as follows:\n1.  **Analyze the Parametric Curve:** The curve is defined in two parts.\n    *   For `t` in `[0, π]`, we have `x = cos(t)` and `y = sin(t)`. This describes the upper half of a unit circle, where `x` ranges from `[-1, 1]` and `y` ranges from `[0, 1]`.\n    *   For `t` in `(π, 2π)`, we have `x = cos(t)` and `y = 5sin(t)`. This describes the lower half of an ellipse, where `x` ranges from `[-1, 1]` and `y` ranges from `[-5, 0)`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Bounding Box:** To find the smallest square that encloses the figure, we first need to find its overall dimensions (its bounding box).\n    *   **X-dimension:** Combining both parts, `x = cos(t)` for `t` in `[0, 2π)`. The minimum value of `cos(t)` is -1 and the maximum is 1. So, the width of the figure is `1 - (-1) = 2`.\n    *   **Y-dimension:** Combining the ranges for `y` from both parts (`[0, 1]` and `[-5, 0)`), the total range for `y` is `[-5, 1]`. The minimum value is -5 and the maximum is 1. So, the height of the figure is `1 - (-5) = 6`.\n\n3.  **Find the Smallest Enclosing Square:** The side length of the smallest square that can enclose this figure must be at least as large as the longest dimension of the bounding box.\n    *   Side length = `max(width, height) = max(2, 6) = 6`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Area:** The area of this square is the side length squared.\n    *   Area = `6 * 6 = 36`.\n\nI will now provide a Python script that numerically computes these values and calculates the final area.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve_area():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function calculates the area of the smallest square that encloses\n    the given parametric curve.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Step 1: Analyze the curve by sampling many points.\n    # Create a dense array of t values from 0 to 2*pi.\n    t = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 20000)\n\n    # Determine the value of 'b' based on t.\n    # b is 1 for t in [0, pi] and 5 for t in (pi, 2pi).\n    b = np.where(t <= np.pi, 1, 5)\n\n    # Calculate x and y coordinates for all t values.\n    x = np.cos(t)\n    y = b * np.sin(t)\n\n    # Step 2: Determine the bounding box.\n    x_min, x_max = np.min(x), np.max(x)\n    y_min, y_max = np.min(y), np.max(y)\n\n    width = x_max - x_min\n    height = y_max - y_min\n\n    # Step 3: Find the side length of the smallest enclosing square.\n    # The side length is the maximum of the width and height.\n    side_length = max(width, height)\n\n    # Step 4: Calculate the area of the square.\n    area = side_length ** 2\n\n    # Print the final calculation as requested.\n    # The format shows each number in the final equation.\n    print(f\"Width of the figure: {x_max:.2f} - ({x_min:.2f}) = {width:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Height of the figure: {y_max:.2f} - ({y_min:.2f}) = {height:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"Side length of the smallest enclosing square = max({width:.2f}, {height:.2f}) = {side_length:.2f}\")\n    print(f\"The area of the square is {side_length:.2f} * {side_length:.2f} = {area:.2f}\")\n\nsolve_area()\n<<<36>>>\n```"
