    "This is a historical question rather than a computational one. I will first identify the specific term Pavel Milyukov used to criticize an aspect of Western culture. The format \"X-Y\" suggests a two-part name. Based on historical records of Milyukov's writings and speeches, particularly his essays on culture, I can determine the correct term. To fulfill the request for a code block, I will write a simple Python script that stores the two parts of the name in variables and then prints the full answer.\n\n```python\ndef find_milyukovs_criticism():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function identifies and prints the term Pavel Milyukov used to\n    criticize a cultural movement he described as a 'stagnant swamp'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Pavel Milyukov, a prominent Russian historian and liberal politician,\n    # was a staunch critic of what he saw as the decline of Western culture.\n    # He specifically targeted the modernist art movements of his time.\n    x = \"Decadents\"\n    y = \"Symbolists\"\n\n    # He grouped these two related movements together in his condemnations.\n    print(f\"The term X-Y that Pavel Milyukov denounced is: {x}-{y}\")\n\nfind_milyukovs_criticism()\n```\n<<<Decadents-Symbolists>>>"
