# The problem asks for the number of topologically distinct continua that satisfy two specific properties.
#
# Let X be such a continuum.
#
# Property (1) states that X has k endpoints, where 1 < k < infinity.
# Property (2) states that X has exactly two orbits under the action of its group of homeomorphisms.
#
# Our analysis leads to the following conclusions:
#
# 1. The two orbits must be the set of endpoints, E(X), and the set of non-endpoints, X \ E(X).
#
# 2. The set of non-endpoints, X \ E(X), must be a homogeneous connected open set. This forces it to be a 1-dimensional manifold (either a circle or a real line), as it cannot contain any "branch points".
#
# 3. If X \ E(X) were a circle, X would be a circle, which has 0 endpoints, violating Property (1).
#
# 4. Therefore, X \ E(X) must be homeomorphic to the real line R. X is a compactification of R. The only such 1-dimensional continuum is an arc (topologically equivalent to the interval [0,1]).
#
# 5. We verify that the arc [0,1] satisfies all conditions:
#    - It is a continuum.
#    - It has 2 endpoints ({0, 1}), which satisfies Property (1).
#    - It has two orbits: the set of endpoints {0, 1} and the set of interior points (0,1). This satisfies Property (2).
#
# Since all arcs are homeomorphic to each other, there is only one such topological type of space.
#
# Therefore, the number of topologically distinct continua is 1.
