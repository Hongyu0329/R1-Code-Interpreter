    "Based on my research, the premise of your question is incorrect. The former President of Nigeria's full name is Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The name \"Azikiwe\" belongs to Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first President of Nigeria. There is no public record of Goodluck Jonathan ever identifying himself as \"Azikiwe\".\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to provide a year for an event that did not happen. The Python code below will clarify this.\n\n```python\ndef clarify_presidential_names():\n    \"\"\"\n    Addresses the user's question by clarifying the names of the individuals involved.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The name mentioned in the query appears to combine two different Nigerian presidents.\n    former_president_correct_name = \"Goodluck Ebele Jonathan\"\n    first_president_name = \"Nnamdi Azikiwe\"\n\n    # Print the clarification.\n    print(\"The query is based on a factual inaccuracy.\")\n    print(f\"The full name of the former president is: {former_president_correct_name}.\")\n    print(f\"The name 'Azikiwe' is the surname of Nigeria's first president: {first_president_name}.\")\n    print(\"\\nThere is no public record of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan ever adding 'Azikiwe' to his name or publicly identifying as such.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, a year cannot be provided for an event that never occurred.\")\n    print(\"As there is no event and no year, no equation can be generated.\")\n\nclarify_presidential_names()\n```\n<<<The event described in the question never occurred as it is based on a factual inaccuracy. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan and Nnamdi Azikiwe are two different individuals.>>>"

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which year did Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan publicly identify himself as azikiwe\n\nOnce you feel you are ready for the final answer, directly return the answer with the format <<<answer content>>> at the end of your response, e.g. <<<C>>>, <<<9.8>>>."
