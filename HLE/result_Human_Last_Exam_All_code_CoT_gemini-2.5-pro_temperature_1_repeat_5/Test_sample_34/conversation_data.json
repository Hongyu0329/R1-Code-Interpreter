    "In poker, particularly No-Limit Texas Hold'em, the decision to open-raise a hand depends on several factors: your position at the table, the stack sizes, and the strength/playability of your hand.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze the Position:** The \"button\" is the last position to act post-flop, which is a significant advantage. This allows you to play a much wider range of hands profitably compared to other positions.\n2.  **Analyze Hand Strength:** We are considering suited Jacks (JXs). The value of these hands comes from their ability to make strong hands like flushes, straights, and top pairs.\n3.  **Rank the Hands:** We can rank the suited Jacks based on their potential.\n    *   **High-Card Value:** Hands like AJs, KJs, and QJs are very strong because they can make the nut flush or very strong top pairs.\n    *   **Connectivity:** Hands like JTs and J9s are strong because they can easily make straights and flushes.\n    *   **Low-End Value:** As the second card (the 'X' in JXs) gets lower, the hand's value decreases. The kicker is weaker, and the ability to connect for straights diminishes. J2s has the largest gap (a \"9-gapper\"), making it the least likely of all suited Jacks to form a straight.\n4.  **Determine the Cutoff:** In a 100BB rake-free game, a standard button opening range is very wide (around 45-50% of all hands). This range includes *all* suited Jacks because even the weakest ones are considered marginally profitable to open due to the immense positional advantage.\n5.  **Identify the \"Worst\" Hand:** Since all suited Jacks are part of a standard opening range in this scenario, the \"worst\" one you should still open is the one with the lowest absolute strength. This is the hand with the weakest kicker and the least connectivity.\n\nFollowing this logic, J2s is the weakest of the suited Jacks. The script below will list the suited Jacks in descending order of strength to illustrate this point and identify the weakest one.\n\n```python\ndef solve_poker_question():\n    \"\"\"\n    This function determines the worst suited Jack to open from the button\n    in a 100BB rake-free cash game by ranking them and identifying the weakest one\n    that is still part of a standard opening range.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Card ranks from lowest to highest\n    ranks = ['2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'T', 'Q', 'K', 'A']\n\n    # Generate all suited Jack hands (JXs).
