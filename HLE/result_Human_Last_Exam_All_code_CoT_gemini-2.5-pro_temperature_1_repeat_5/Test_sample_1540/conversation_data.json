    "To determine the most memory-efficient C program for this task, we need to devise a strategy that uses the minimum amount of memory for variables.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Analyze the Problem:** We need to compare two strings lexicographically, ignoring case. The strings are read from standard input on separate lines.\n2.  **Devise a Memory-Efficient Strategy:** Storing both strings in memory would require two character arrays. A more memory-efficient approach is to store only the first string. Then, we can read the second string one character at a time and compare it with the corresponding character of the stored first string. This eliminates the need for a second large buffer.\n3.  **Identify Necessary Variables:**\n    *   A character array is needed to store the first string. Since the maximum length is 100, we need an array of size 101 to account for the null terminator (`\\0`).\n    *   An index variable is required to loop through the first string. The maximum index will be 99, which can be stored in a `char` type (the smallest integer type in C) to save space.\n    *   A variable is needed to store each character read from the second string. The standard C function for reading a single character, `getchar()`, returns an `int` to handle the special `EOF` (End-Of-File) value. Therefore, this variable must be an `int`.\n4.  **Calculate Total Memory:** We will sum the memory usage of these variables based on standard data type sizes in C (e.g., on a typical 32/64-bit system where `sizeof(char)` is 1 byte and `sizeof(int)` is 4 bytes).\n\n### Memory Calculation:\nFollowing the plan, the variables required are:\n\n1.  **First string buffer:** `char s1[101];`\n    *   Memory = `101 * sizeof(char)` = `101 * 1 byte` = 101 bytes.\n2.  **Loop index:** `char i;`\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(char)` = `1 * 1 byte` = 1 byte.\n3.  **Character from second string:** `int c;`\n    *   Memory = `1 * sizeof(int)` = `1 * 4 bytes` = 4 bytes.\n\nThe total memory `m` is the sum of the memory used by these variables.\n\nTotal Memory (m) = (memory for string buffer) + (memory for loop index) + (memory for input character)\nm = 101 + 1 + 4 = 106 bytes.\n\nThis approach is the most memory-efficient because we must store the first string to compare it against the second, and the other variables (`i` and `c`) are the minimum necessary to perform the character-by-character comparison.\n\n<<<106>>>"
