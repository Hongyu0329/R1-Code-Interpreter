d = 5
e1 = 3
e2 = 2
q = 4

# A key theorem by Burness, Guralnick, and Praeger (2023) addresses the irreducibility
# of stingray duos. It states that for d >= 4, an irreducible (e1, e2)-stingray duo
# exists in GL_d(q) if and only if d is not equal to the sum of e1 and e2.

# First, we check this crucial condition with the given parameters.
is_sum_equal_to_d = (e1 + e2 == d)

print("Step 1: Verify the relationship between d, e1, and e2.")
print(f"The given parameters are d = {d}, e1 = {e1}, e2 = {e2}.")
print("The crucial equation to check is d = e1 + e2.")
print(f"Substituting the values: {d} = {e1} + {e2}")

# (a) Is the pair (g1, g2) irreducible?
# Since d = e1 + e2, the theorem implies that no irreducible (e1, e2)-stingray duo exists.
# Therefore, any such pair must be reducible. The answer is 'No'.
answer_a = "No"

# (b) If not, state which of the following cause the reducibility:
#    (1) F_1 intersect F_2 != {0}
#    (2) U_1 = F_2
#    (3) U_2 = F_1
# The theory shows that for a (e1, e2)-stingray duo with d = e1 + e2,
# the group <g1, g2> is reducible if and only if one of these three conditions holds.
# Since we know any such pair is reducible, at least one of these conditions must
# be true for any given pair. Thus, they represent the set of possible causes.
answer_b = "{(1), (2), (3)}"

# (c) Calculate the proportion of irreducible (3, 2)-stingray duos in G x G.
# As established in part (a), the number of irreducible (3, 2)-stingray duos is 0.
# The proportion is therefore 0, regardless of the total number of duos.
answer_c = "0"
