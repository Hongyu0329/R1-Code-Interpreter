    # (a) True or false: If P(u, v) = 0, then (u, v) is necessarily a critical point of the energy functional J.
    # Reasoning: The Pohozaev identity P(u, v) = 0 is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for (u, v)
    # to be a critical point. A function can satisfy the identity without being a solution.
    answer_a = "False"

    # (b) Is it true that for any (u, v) in H^{1,s}(R^2), there exists a unique t > 0 such that (u_t, v_t) is in P?
    # Reasoning: The existence of such a unique scaling factor t is not guaranteed for any function.
    # It typically depends on additional conditions, such as the positivity of the nonlinear potential term,
    # which may not hold for an arbitrary function (u, v).
    answer_b = "No"

    # (c) Must the minimiser of J on P(a,b) satisfy the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0?
    # Reasoning: A minimizer of the energy functional J on the Pohozaev manifold is expected to be a
    # ground state solution. Such solutions also lie on the Nehari manifold. A key property of functions
    # on the Nehari manifold (for standard nonlinearities) is that the second derivative of the
    # associated fiber map is negative, which is what the condition phi''(u,v)(1) < 0 represents.
