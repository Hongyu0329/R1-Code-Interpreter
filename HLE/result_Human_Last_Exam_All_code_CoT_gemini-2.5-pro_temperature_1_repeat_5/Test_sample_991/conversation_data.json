    "This is a classic Chinese character riddle that plays on the visual components of the character. Let's break it down to find the answer.\n\n1.  **\"A wooden stick\" and \"a ladder placed in the center\"**: Both of these descriptions can be interpreted as the character **木 (mù)**. A tree is made of wood (a stick), and its shape, with a central trunk and horizontal/diagonal branches, can be visualized as a simple ladder.\n2.  **\"hanging a square box\"**: This refers to the enclosure radical **囗 (wéi)**, which looks like a square box. The term \"hanging\" is used poetically to describe composition; in this case, the first component is placed *inside* the box.\n\nWhen you combine these components by placing the \"ladder\"/\"wooden stick\" (木) inside the \"square box\" (囗), you form the character **困 (kùn)**.\n\nThe following Python code will print this explanation.\n\n```python\ndef solve_riddle():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the Chinese character riddle by breaking it down into its visual components.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # The riddle describes the components of a Chinese character.\n    # \"A wooden stick\" and \"a ladder placed in the center\" both describe the character 木 (mù).\n    component1 = \"木\"\n    \n    # \"hanging a square box\" describes the enclosure radical 囗 (wéi).\n    component2 = \"囗\"\n    \n    # Combining the components: a 木 inside a 囗.\n    final_character = \"困\"\n    \n    print(\"The riddle is: 'A wooden stick, hanging a square box, a ladder placed in the center.'\")\n    print(\"\\nHere is the step-by-step solution:\")\n    print(\"1. 'A wooden stick' and 'a ladder placed in the center' can both be visualized as the character for 'wood': \" + component1)\n    print(\"2. 'hanging a square box' describes the enclosure radical: \" + component2)\n    print(\"3. Placing the 'ladder' (\" + component1 + \") inside the 'box' (\" + component2 + \") gives us the final character.\")\n    \n    print(\"\\nTherefore, the character is: \" + final_character)\n\nsolve_riddle()\n<<<困>>>\n```"
