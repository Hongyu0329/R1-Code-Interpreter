    """
    Checks if tiling a 5x6 rectangle with two 3x3 and three 2x2 squares
    is plausible using a coloring argument.

    The grid is colored based on the x-coordinate modulo 3.
    Grid dimensions: W=5, H=6.
    Colors of columns (x=0 to 4): 0, 1, 2, 0, 1

    Number of cells of each color in the grid:
    N_color0 = count(cols 0, 3) * H = 2 * 6 = 12
    N_color1 = count(cols 1, 4) * H = 2 * 6 = 12
    N_color2 = count(col 2) * H = 1 * 6 = 6

    Let's analyze the colors covered by the tiles:
    - A 3x3 square placed anywhere covers 3 cells of each color.
      So, two 3x3 squares cover 6 cells of each color.
    - A 2x2 square's color coverage depends on its starting x-position:
      - x=0 (cols 0,1): covers 2 of color0, 2 of color1, 0 of color2
      - x=1 (cols 1,2): covers 0 of color0, 2 of color1, 2 of color2
      - x=2 (cols 2,3): covers 2 of color0, 0 of color1, 2 of color2
      - x=3 (cols 3,4): covers 2 of color0, 2 of color1, 0 of color2

    Let k_a, k_b, k_c be the number of 2x2 squares starting at x=0 or x=3,
    x=1, and x=2 respectively. We have k_a + k_b + k_c = 3.

    Total cells covered for each color must match the grid's counts:
    C0 = 6 (from 3x3s) + 2*k_a + 0*k_b + 2*k_c = 12  => 2(k_a+k_c) = 6 => k_a+k_c = 3
    C1 = 6 (from 3x3s) + 2*k_a + 2*k_b + 0*k_c = 12  => 2(k_a+k_b) = 6 => k_a+k_b = 3
    C2 = 6 (from 3x3s) + 0*k_a + 2*k_b + 2*k_c = 6   => 2(k_b+k_c) = 0 => k_b+k_c = 0
    """
    
    # We solve the system of equations derived in the comments.
    # k_b and k_c must be non-negative integers.
    # From k_b + k_c = 0, it must be that k_b = 0 and k_c = 0.
    
    k_b = 0
    k_c = 0
    
    # Substitute into the other equations:
    # k_a + k_c = 3  => k_a + 0 = 3 => k_a = 3
    k_a = 3
    
    # Check for consistency with the last equation and the total count.
    # k_a + k_b = 3 => 3 + 0 = 3. This is consistent.
    # Total 2x2 squares: k_a + k_b + k_c = 3 + 0 + 0 = 3. This is correct.
