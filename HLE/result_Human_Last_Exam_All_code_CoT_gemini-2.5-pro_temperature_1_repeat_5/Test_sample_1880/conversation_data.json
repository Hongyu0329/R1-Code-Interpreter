    "To determine the order of the Galois group for the polynomial $f(x) = x^4 + 8x + 14$, we will follow a standard procedure for quartic polynomials.\n\n### Plan\n1.  **Check for Irreducibility:** We'll first determine if the polynomial is irreducible over the rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. We can use Eisenstein's criterion for this. An irreducible quartic polynomial has a transitive Galois group.\n2.  **Calculate the Discriminant ($\\Delta$):** The discriminant helps narrow down the possible Galois groups. The Galois group is a subgroup of the alternating group $A_4$ if and only if the discriminant is a perfect square of a rational number.\n3.  **Construct the Resolvent Cubic:** For the cases not resolved by the discriminant (i.e., when $\\Delta$ is not a perfect square), we construct the resolvent cubic polynomial.\n4.  **Analyze the Resolvent Cubic:** The irreducibility of the resolvent cubic over $\\mathbb{Q}$ distinguishes between the remaining possible Galois groups ($S_4$ and $D_4$).\n5.  **Determine the Group and its Order:** Based on the previous steps, we can identify the Galois group and state its order.\n\nThe following Python code implements this plan to compute the necessary values and determine the order of the Galois group.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef get_integer_divisors(n):\n    \"\"\"Returns a list of all integer divisors of n.\"\"\"\n    n = abs(n)\n    divs = {1, n}\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            divs.add(i)\n            divs.add(n // i)\n    # Return both positive and negative divisors\n    return sorted(list(divs.union({-d for d in divs})))\n\ndef find_integer_root(coeffs):\n    \"\"\"Finds an integer root of a polynomial with integer coefficients.\"\"\"\n    # Based on the Rational Root Theorem, for a monic polynomial,\n    # any rational root must be an integer and a divisor of the constant term.\n    const_term = coeffs[-1]\n    if const_term == 0:\n        return 0\n    \n    possible_roots = get_integer_divisors(const_term)\n    \n    for r in possible_roots:\n        # Evaluate polynomial P(r)\n        val = sum(c * (r ** i) for i, c in enumerate(reversed(coeffs)))\n        if val == 0:\n            return r\n    return None\n\ndef solve_galois_group_order():\n    \"\"\"\n    Computes the order of the Galois group for x^4 + 8x + 14.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + 0x^3 + 0x^2 + 8x + 14\n    # Coefficients: a=0, b=0, c=8, d=14\n    # For a depressed quartic x^4 + qx + r, we have q=8, r=14.\n    q = 8\n    r = 14\n    print(f\"The polynomial is f(x) = x^4 + {q}x + {r}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 1: Check for irreducibility\n    print(\"Step 1: Check for irreducibility over the rational numbers Q.\")\n    p = 2\n    print(f\"We can use Eisenstein's criterion with the prime p = {p}.\")\n    print(f\"1. p={p} does not divide the leading coefficient (1).\")\n    print(f\"2. p={p} divides all other coefficients (0, 0, {q}, {r}).\")\n    print(f\"3. p^2={p**2} does not divide the constant term {r}.\")\n    print(\"Therefore, the polynomial is irreducible over Q.\")\n    print(\"The Galois group must be a transitive subgroup of S_4: S_4, A_4, D_4, V_4, or C_4.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate the discriminant\n    print(\"Step 2: Calculate the discriminant (Delta).\")\n    print(\"For a polynomial x^4 + qx + r, the discriminant is Delta = -27*q^4 + 256*r^3.\")\n    discriminant = -27 * (q**4) + 256 * (r**3)\n    print(f\"Delta = -27 * {q}^4 + 256 * {r}^3 = -27 * {q**4} + 256 * {r**3} = {-27 * q**4} + {256 * r**3} = {discriminant}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 20)\n\n    # Step 3: Analyze the discriminant\n    print(\"Step 3: Analyze the discriminant.\")\n    sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant)\n    if sqrt_discriminant**2 == discriminant:\n        print(f\"Delta = {discriminant} is a perfect square.\")\n        print(\"The Galois group is a subgroup of A_4.
