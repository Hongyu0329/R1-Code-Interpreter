    "To find the value of \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\), we need to determine the number of permutations of length 333 that avoid the pattern 1324 and have exactly 3 inversions.\n\n### Step-by-step Plan:\n\n1.  **Understand the Notation:** The term \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) represents the number of permutations of length `n` that have exactly `k` inversions and avoid the pattern `\\(\\sigma\\)`. In this problem, `n=333`, `k=3`, and `\\(\\sigma\\)=1324`.\n\n2.  **The Stability Property:** For a fixed number of inversions `k` and a given pattern `\\(\\sigma\\)`, the value of \\(av_n^k(\\sigma)\\) often becomes constant for all `n` greater than or equal to some integer `N`. For the pattern 1324 and `k=3` inversions, this value is known to stabilize for `n \\geq 5`. This means that \\(av_{333}^3(1324) = av_5^3(1324)\\).\n\n3.  **Computational Approach:** Since `n=333` is too large for a direct combinatorial search, we can leverage the stability property. We will write a Python script to compute \\(av_5^3(1324)\\) by generating all permutations of length 5, and for each permutation, checking two conditions:\n    a. Does it avoid the pattern 1324?\n    b. Does it have exactly 3 inversions?\n\n4.  **Pattern Avoidance Check (1324):** A permutation `p` contains the pattern 1324 if there exist four indices `a < b < c < d` such that `p[a] < p[c] < p[b] < p[d]`. Our script will check for the absence of such a subsequence.\n\n5.  **Inversion Count Check:** An inversion is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `p[i] > p[j]`. The script will count the total number of such pairs.\n\n6.  **Final Output:** The script will count how many permutations of length 5 satisfy both conditions. This count will be the answer for \\(av_{333}^3(1324)\\). The final output will be presented as an equation, as requested.\n\nHere is the Python code that implements this plan.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef has_1324(p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if a permutation p contains the 1324 pattern.\n    A permutation p has a 1324 pattern if there exist indices a < b < c < d\n    such that p[a] < p[c] < p[b] < p[d].\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(p)\n    if n < 4:\n        return False\n    for a in range(n):\n        for b in range(a + 1, n):\n            for c in range(b + 1, n):\n                for d in range(c + 1, n):\n                    if p[a] < p[c] and p[c] < p[b] and p[b] < p[d]:\n                        return True\n    return False\n\ndef count_inversions(p):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of inversions in a permutation p.\n    An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and p[i] > p[j].\n    \"\"\"\n    inv_count = 0\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if p[i] > p[j]:\n                inv_count += 1\n    return inv_count\n\ndef solve_av_nk_1324():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates av_n^k(1324) for n and k.\n    The problem asks for av_333^3(1324).
