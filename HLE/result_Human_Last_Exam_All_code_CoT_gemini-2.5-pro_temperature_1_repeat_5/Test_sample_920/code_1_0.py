The insect family Micromalthidae has a very peculiar and complex life cycle. Here is the breakdown to find the answer:

1. Larval Feeding: The larvae are the primary feeding stage. As stated in the problem, they feed on decaying wood, which is rich in cellulose and often contains fungus. So, choices B, C, and D describe the diet of the larval stage, not the adult.

2. Adult Male Biology: Adult males in this family are extremely rare, short-lived, and most importantly, they have vestigial (non-functional) mouthparts.

3. Conclusion: Because their mouthparts are not developed for feeding, adult males are physically incapable of consuming any food during their brief adult life. They exist solely for reproduction. Therefore, from the time it emerges as an adult until its death, the male will have fed on nothing.
