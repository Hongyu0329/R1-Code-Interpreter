    "Integrins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that recognize a specific tripeptide motif, Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD). While all the peptides listed contain this core RGD sequence, the binding affinity and specificity are significantly influenced by the amino acids flanking this motif.\n\nThe most well-characterized RGD-containing ligand for many integrins is the protein fibronectin. The cell-binding domain of fibronectin contains the sequence RGDSPASS. Peptides that mimic this sequence are known to bind strongly to integrins like α5β1 and αvβ3 in *in vitro* assays.\n\nTherefore, the task is to identify which of the provided peptide sequences is most similar to the known high-affinity binding sequence from fibronectin. I will write a Python script to compare each candidate peptide to the fibronectin reference sequence and identify the best match. The script will calculate a simple similarity score by counting the number of matching amino acids at each position.\n\n```python\ndef find_most_likely_binder():\n    \"\"\"\n    Identifies the peptide most likely to bind to an integrin receptor\n    by comparing it to a known high-affinity sequence from fibronectin.\n    \"\"\"\n    # All choices contain the core RGD motif.

    "You are a helpful AI assistant. Solve tasks using your coding skills.\n    In the following cases, suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the user to execute.\n    Don't include multiple code blocks in one response, only include one in the response. Do not ask users to copy and paste the result. Instead, use 'print' function for the output when relevant.\n    Think the task step by step if you need to. If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first. You can first output your thinking steps with texts and then the final python code.\n    Remember in the final code you still need to output each number in the final equation!\n    Start the python block with ```python\n\n    Which of the following peptides has been found to bind or is highly likely to bind an integrin receptor in an in vitro assay?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA.
