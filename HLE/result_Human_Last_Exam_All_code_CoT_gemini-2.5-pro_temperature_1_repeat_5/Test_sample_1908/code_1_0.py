def solve_topology_complement_problem():
    """
    This function explains and presents the solution to the topology complement problem.

    The problem asks for the smallest possible number of complements a non-trivial,
    non-discrete topology T on a set X can have, where the cardinality of X is c (the continuum).

    The solution relies on established theorems in general topology.
    """

    # Step 1: Define the cardinalities involved.
    # 'c' represents the cardinality of the continuum, |R|.
    # '2^c' represents the cardinality of the power set of the real numbers, |P(R)|.

    # Step 2: State the lower bound.
    # A theorem by de Prada and Macho-Stadler (1999) states that any topology
    # on an infinite set X that has a complement must have at least 2^|X| complements.
    # For a set X of cardinality c, this means the number of complements is at least 2^c.
    lower_bound = "2^c"

    # Step 3: State the upper bound.
    # An achievable upper bound is found by providing an example. The standard topology
    # on the real numbers R (a set of size c) is known to have exactly 2^c complements.
    # This provides an instance where the number of complements is 2^c.
    upper_bound = "2^c"

    # Step 4: Conclude the minimum number.
    # Since the minimum number must be >= 2^c and we have an example where it is equal to 2^c,
    # the smallest possible number of complements is exactly 2^c.
    min_complements = "2^c"
    
    # The final equation is: Minimum Number = 2^c
    base = 2
    exponent = 'c'
