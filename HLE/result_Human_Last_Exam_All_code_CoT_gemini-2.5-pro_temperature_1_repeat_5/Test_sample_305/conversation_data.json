    "To find the number of associative and commutative binary operations on a set of 3 elements, we will write a Python script to perform an exhaustive search. Here is the step-by-step plan:\n\n1.  **Represent the Operation**: A binary operation on a set of 3 elements (we'll use the set `{0, 1, 2}`) can be fully described by a 3x3 multiplication table, often called a Cayley table. The entry at row `i` and column `j` represents the result of `i * j`.\n\n2.  **Apply Commutativity**: The commutative property (`x * y = y * x`) implies that the Cayley table must be symmetric about its main diagonal. This greatly simplifies the problem. Instead of defining all $3 \\times 3 = 9$ entries, we only need to define the 6 entries on and above the main diagonal: `0*0`, `0*1`, `0*2`, `1*1`, `1*2`, and `2*2`. The rest of the table is then determined by symmetry.\n\n3.  **Enumerate All Possibilities**: Each of these 6 crucial entries can be any of the 3 elements in the set. This gives a total of $3^6 = 729$ possible commutative operations. Our script will systematically generate each of these 729 possibilities.\n\n4.  **Check for Associativity**: For each of the 729 commutative operations, we will check if it is also associative. The associative law, `(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)`, must hold true for all possible choices of `x`, `y`, and `z` from the set. Since our set has 3 elements, there are $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 27$ triples `(x, y, z)` to check for each operation.\n\n5.  **Count and Report**: The script will maintain a counter. It will iterate through all 729 operations, and for each one that passes the associativity test, it will increment the counter. The final value of this counter is the answer to the problem.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute this plan.\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef count_associative_commutative_operations():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of associative and commutative binary operations\n    on a set of n elements by iterating through all possibilities and checking\n    the properties.\n    \"\"\"\n    # The set is S = {0, 1, 2}, so its size is n=3.\n    n = 3\n    elements = range(n)\n\n    # A commutative binary operation is defined by the values on the main diagonal\n    # and the upper triangle of its Cayley table.
