# We want to find the dimension of the second cohomology group H^2(G,M).
# The problem specifies the group G, the module M, and the action.
# Based on the theory of group cohomology for one-relator groups, the dimension
# can be found by a polynomial calculation.

# The equation for the dimension is:
# dim H^2(G,M) = deg(gcd(P(x), S(x)))
# where P(x) is derived from the module action and S(x) from the group relation.

# Define the symbolic variable for our polynomials
x = sympy.symbols('x')

# The module M is a 128-dimensional vector space, and the group generators
# act as a cyclic permutation of the basis. The characteristic polynomial
# of a 128-cycle is x^128 - 1.
N = 128
char_poly = x**N - 1

# The group G is given by the presentation <a, b | a^8 = b^8>. The relation
# involves the 8th power. This leads to the polynomial S(x) which is a sum
# of powers of x from 0 to 7.
power = 8
rel_poly = sum(x**i for i in range(power))

# The dimension of H^2(G,M) is the degree of the greatest common divisor (GCD)
# of these two polynomials. We use sympy's `gcd` function for this.
gcd_polynomial = sympy.gcd(char_poly, rel_poly, domain='ZZ')

# The degree of the resulting GCD polynomial gives the dimension of the cohomology group.
dimension = sympy.degree(gcd_polynomial, gen=x)

# In the final output, we display the numbers involved in the "equation" for the dimension.
