    "Of course. Here is my plan to solve this problem:\n\n1.  **Identify Key Concepts**: The problem requires calculating the specific heat scaling exponent, α, using the epsilon (ϵ) expansion from renormalization group theory.\n2.  **Define Parameters**: The spatial dimension `d` is given as 3. The epsilon expansion is performed around the upper critical dimension, `d_c`. For the n-vector model (which includes the Ising model), `d_c = 4`. The expansion parameter is `ϵ = d_c - d`.\n3.  **State Assumptions**: The problem does not specify the number of spin components, `n`. The Ising model (`n=1`) is the most common and fundamental case, so I will perform the calculation for `n=1` and state this assumption clearly.\n4.  **Recall the Formula**: The formula for α to the first order in ϵ for the n-vector model is:\n    `α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ`\n5.  **Develop the Python Code**: I will write a Python script that:\n    *   Defines the parameters `d`, `d_c`, and `n`.\n    *   Calculates `ϵ`.\n    *   Calculates `α` using the formula.\n    *   Prints a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation, including the formula and the substitution of each number, as requested.\n    *   Outputs the final numerical value of α.\n\nHere is the Python code to perform the calculation.\n\n```python\ndef calculate_scaling_exponent_alpha():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the first-order\n    epsilon expansion for a system in d=3 dimensions.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Parameters for the calculation\n    d = 3  # Spatial dimension\n    d_c = 4  # Upper critical dimension for the n-vector model\n    n = 1  # Number of spin components (assuming the Ising model)\n\n    # Epsilon (ϵ) is the expansion parameter\n    epsilon = d_c - d\n\n    # Numerator and denominator of the formula for alpha\n    numerator = 4 - n\n    denominator = 2 * (n + 8)\n\n    # Calculate alpha\n    alpha = (numerator / denominator) * epsilon\n\n    # --- Output the step-by-step calculation ---\n    print(\"This script calculates the specific heat scaling exponent α using the epsilon expansion.\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"The calculation is for a system with spatial dimension d = {d}.\")\n    print(f\"We assume the Ising model, which corresponds to n = {n} component(s) of spin.\")\n    print(\"\\nStep 1: Determine the expansion parameter ϵ (epsilon).\")\n    print(f\"The upper critical dimension for this model is d_c = {d_c}.\")\n    print(f\"ϵ = d_c - d = {d_c} - {d} = {epsilon}\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 2: Apply the first-order formula for the scaling exponent α.\")\n    print(\"The formula is: α = (4 - n) / (2 * (n + 8)) * ϵ\")\n\n    print(\"\\nStep 3: Substitute the values and calculate α.\")\n    print(f\"α = (4 - {n}) / (2 * ({n} + 8)) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = ({numerator}) / (2 * ({n+8})) * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator} / {denominator} * {epsilon}\")\n    print(f\"α = {numerator/6} / {denominator/6}  (simplified fraction)\")\n    print(f\"α = 1 / 6\")\n\n    print(\"\\n\" + \"-\" * 70)\n    print(f\"The final calculated value for the scaling exponent α is: {alpha}\")\n    print(\"-\" * 70)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    calculate_scaling_exponent_alpha()\n```\n<<<0.16666666666666666>>>"
