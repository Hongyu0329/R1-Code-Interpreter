    # (1) Soviet Union on the Moon / Dangerous Territory
    # The action of taking control of a territory can be described as "capture".
    # In Red Alert 2, the Soviets build a base on the moon, effectively capturing it.
    # In many games, missions in captured enemy territory are dangerous.
    answer1 = "CAPTURE"
    
    # (2) Football anthem scandal apology
    # The incident occurred in the game "Pro Evolution Soccer 6". The apology came
    # from the publisher, Konami, but the game series itself is also a valid answer.
    # Using the series name provides the necessary letter.
    answer2 = "PRO EVOLUTION SOCCER"
    
    # (3) Backwards message in a game
    # The message is from "Earthworm Jim". The reference to "16th level" is likely a
    # clever hint towards the 16-bit console the game was famous on.
    answer3 = "SEGA GENESIS"
    
    # (4) Heroes of Might and Magic V companion riddle
    # The heroine is called "Pantera," a play on "Panza" (from Sancho Panza).
    # Her companion is therefore a Don Quixote figure, who was famously mad.
    # The Latin word for "mad" or "insane" is "insanus".
    answer4 = "INSANUS"
    
    # (5) Dennis Fong's gaming innovation
    # The phrase "MAGIC HAND" has two letters replaced. A plausible original phrase,
    # fitting the gaming context and Japanese loanwords, is "MAJIN HAND" (Majin means
    # "demon" or "magical person" in Japanese). G->J and C->N are the two replacements.
    answer5 = "MAJIN HAND"
