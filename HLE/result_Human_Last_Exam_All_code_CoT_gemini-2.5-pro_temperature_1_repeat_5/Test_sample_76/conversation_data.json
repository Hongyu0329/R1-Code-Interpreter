    "To find the number of integers $x$ for which $x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$ is a perfect square, we need to find the number of integer solutions $(x, y)$ to the equation $y^2 = x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056$.\n\n### Step-by-step plan:\n1.  **Simplify the equation:** The given cubic expression is complicated. A substitution can simplify it into a standard form of an elliptic curve. Let's try to complete the cube. A more direct approach is to make a linear substitution $x = u + a$. The coefficient of the quadratic term in $u$ will be $3a - 16$. To eliminate this term, we would need $a=16/3$, which introduces fractions.\n\n    Instead, we can find a transformation by factoring. After some algebraic manipulation, we can rewrite the expression. A key insight is to relate it to the coordinates of the integer points. Let's try to make the equation more structured. We can test for a specific substitution $x=u+10$:\n    $P(u+10) = (u+10)^3 - 16(u+10)^2 - 72(u+10) + 1056$\n    $= (u^3 + 30u^2 + 300u + 1000) - 16(u^2 + 20u + 100) - 72(u+10) + 1056$\n    $= u^3 + 30u^2 + 300u + 1000 - 16u^2 - 320u - 1600 - 72u - 720 + 1056$\n    $= u^3 + (30-16)u^2 + (300-320-72)u + (1000-1600-720+1056)$\n    $= u^3 + 14u^2 - 92u - 264$\n\n    So we are looking for the number of integers $u$ for which $u^3 + 14u^2 - 92u - 264$ is a perfect square. Let this be $k^2$. The original integer $x$ is then $u+10$.\n\n2.  **Determine the search range for u:** We need to find all integer solutions $(u, k)$ to the elliptic curve equation $k^2 = u^3 + 14u^2 - 92u - 264$. For a value to be a square, it must be non-negative. Let $f(u) = u^3 + 14u^2 - 92u - 264$. The roots of $f(u)=0$ are approximately -18.8, -2.1, and 6.9. Thus, we only need to search for integer solutions in the ranges where $f(u) \\ge 0$, which are $u \\in [-18, -3]$ and $u \\ge 7$.\n\n    For very large values of $|u|$, it can be shown that $f(u)$ lies between two consecutive perfect squares, and thus cannot be a square itself. This means there are a finite number of integer solutions. We can write a script to search for these solutions within a reasonable range based on this property.\n\n3.  **Write and execute the Python code:** The Python script will iterate through the determined ranges of $u$, calculate $f(u)$, and check if it's a perfect square. For each such $u$, the corresponding integer $x=u+10$ is a solution. The script will count and list all such solutions.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve_equation():\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the number of integers x for which x^3 - 16x^2 - 72x + 1056 is a perfect square.\n    \"\"\"\n    solutions = []\n    # Based on the analysis of f(u) = u^3 + 14u^2 - 92u - 264,\n    # we search in the ranges where f(u) >= 0.\n    # The approximate roots of f(u) are -18.8, -2.1, and 6.9.\n    # So we check integers u in [-18, -3] and u >= 7.\n    # We choose a sufficiently large upper bound for our search.
