def solve_quantum_symmetries():
    """
    This function determines the correct statements about quantum symmetries.

    Based on a detailed analysis of the provided text and principles of quantum mechanics:
    - A is False (generators can have continuous spectra, e.g., momentum).
    - B1 is False (the premise [τ,H]=0 is not met by a 1/r^2 potential).
    - B2 is False (the generator leads to a scaling of exp(-2θ), not exp(θ)).
    - C is False (the condition is both necessary and sufficient).
    - D is True (follows from [τ,H]=0).
    - E is True (definition of the angular momentum as a generator of rotations).
    - F is True (statement of Noether's theorem in QM).
    - G is True (unitarity of S implies Hermiticity of τ).
    - H is False (unbounded operators can have discrete spectra, e.g., L_z).
    - I is True (consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula for non-commuting generators).
    - J is True (direct consequence of [S,H]=0).

    The set of true statements is {D, E, F, G, I, J}.
    Sorted and concatenated, the answer is "DEFGIJ".
