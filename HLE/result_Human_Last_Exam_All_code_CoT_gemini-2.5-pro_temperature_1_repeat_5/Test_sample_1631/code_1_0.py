# The task is to identify the primary scientific reason for using bypass notches
# in sheet metal stamping dies from a list of options.

# Based on the principles of sheet metal forming, the fundamental purpose of these
# notches is to control the flow of material from the blank into the die cavity.

# Complex geometries (like sharp corners or deep sections) disrupt uniform material flow,
# creating a high risk of defects like splits (from too much restriction) or wrinkles
# (from too little restriction).

# Bypass notches are a precise method to locally manage this flow. Therefore, their purpose
# is to counteract issues related to material inflow around complex geometries.

# This corresponds to option D.
final_answer = 'D'

# There is no equation in this problem. We will print the letter of the correct choice.
