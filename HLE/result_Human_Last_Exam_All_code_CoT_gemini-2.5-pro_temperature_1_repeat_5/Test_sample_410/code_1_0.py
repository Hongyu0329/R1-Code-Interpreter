# Step 1: Find the coefficients of f(x)
# f(x) = a*exp(2*x) + b*exp(x) + c
# The problem gives two conditions.

# Condition 1: lim_{x->-inf} (f(x)+3)/e^x = 1
# Let's analyze the limit: lim_{x->-inf} (a*e^(2x) + b*e^x + c + 3) / e^x
# As x -> -inf, e^x -> 0. For the limit to be finite, the numerator must also go to 0.
# The limit of the numerator is c + 3. So, c + 3 = 0, which means c = -3.
# The limit becomes lim_{x->-inf} (a*e^(2x) + b*e^x) / e^x = lim_{x->-inf} (a*e^x + b)
# As x -> -inf, e^x -> 0, so the limit is b.
# We are given that the limit is 1, so b = 1.
c_coeff = -3
b_coeff = 1

# Now f(x) = a*exp(2*x) + exp(x) - 3.
# Condition 2: f(ln(2)) = 0
# a*exp(2*ln(2)) + exp(ln(2)) - 3 = 0
# a*exp(ln(4)) + 2 - 3 = 0
# 4*a - 1 = 0
# So, a = 1/4.
a_coeff = 1/4

print(f"The coefficients are a = {a_coeff}, b = {b_coeff}, c = {c_coeff}.")

# Step 2: Analyze the integral equation to find the new a and b.
# The equation is: integral from 0 to a of g(x)dx + integral from ln(2) to ln(b) of f(x)dx = a*ln(b)
# The identity for the integral of an inverse function is:
# integral from c to d of f(x)dx + integral from f(c) to f(d) of g(y)dy = d*f(d) - c*f(c)
# Let's match our integral equation to this identity.
# Let c = ln(2) and d = ln(b).
# We know f(ln(2)) = 0.
# The identity becomes:
# integral from ln(2) to ln(b) of f(x)dx + integral from 0 to f(ln(b)) of g(y)dy = ln(b)*f(ln(b))
# Comparing this identity to the given equation:
# Given:    integral from ln(2) to ln(b) of f(x)dx + integral from 0 to a of g(x)dx = a*ln(b)
# Identity: integral from ln(2) to ln(b) of f(x)dx + integral from 0 to f(ln(b)) of g(x)dx = ln(b)*f(ln(b))
# The two equations are identical if a = f(ln(b)).
# This gives us the relationship between the a and b we need to find.
# a = (1/4)*exp(2*ln(b)) + exp(ln(b)) - 3
# a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3
print("Step 2: Analyzed the integral equation.")
print("The equation holds if a = f(ln(b)), which simplifies to a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3.")
print("-" * 20)

# Step 3 & 4: Use the coefficient b to find a unique solution.
# We have one equation with two unknowns. The problem's use of the same variable names
# suggests a connection between the integral parameters and the function coefficients.
# Let's test the hypothesis that the parameter b is the same as the coefficient b we found earlier.
# Hypothesis: b_parameter = b_coeff = 1.
b_final = b_coeff

# Now substitute b = 1 into the relationship from Step 2 to find a.
# a = (1/4)*(1)^2 + 1 - 3
a_final = (1/4) * (b_final**2) + b_final - 3

print("Step 3 & 4: Resolved ambiguity and found a and b.")
print(f"Assuming the parameter b is the same as the coefficient b, we have b = {b_final}.")
print(f"Substituting b = {b_final} into the relation a = (1/4)*b^2 + b - 3 gives:")

a_final_frac = sympy.Rational(a_final)
print(f"So, the solution is a = {a_final_frac}, b = {b_final}.")

# Step 5: Calculate the final answer a + b
result = a_final + b_final
