    "To determine whether `1 - Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)` overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates the per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) for an all-or-nothing vaccine, we need to model the infection dynamics in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.\n\n### Plan:\n1.  **Define the Vaccine Model:** An \"all-or-nothing\" vaccine confers complete immunity to a fraction of recipients (`V_e`) and no protection to the rest (`1 - V_e`). For this model, the true per-exposure vaccine efficacy (`VE_p`) is equal to `V_e`.\n2.  **Define Incidence Rates:** The incidence rate (IR) is the number of new cases divided by the total person-time at risk. We'll model the IR in both the unvaccinated (`IR_u`) and vaccinated (`IR_v`) groups over a specific time period.\n3.  **The Key Insight (Bias Source):** In the vaccinated group, there's a mix of individuals: the immune (zero risk) and the susceptible (same risk as unvaccinated). Over time, susceptible individuals get infected and are removed from the at-risk pool. However, the immune individuals continue to contribute to the person-time denominator without contributing any cases. This \"dilution\" of the denominator causes the calculated average incidence rate in the vaccinated group (`IR_v`) to be systematically lower than the initial instantaneous rate.\n4.  **Mathematical Demonstration:** We will use a Python script to calculate the true `VE_p` and compare it to the estimated efficacy from `1 - IRR`. The script will compute the average IRR over a finite time period, accounting for the depletion of susceptibles and the person-time contribution from the immune fraction of the vaccinated group.\n5.  **Conclusion:** By comparing the calculated `1 - IRR` to the true `VE_p`, we will demonstrate the direction of the estimation bias.\n\nThe python code below implements this simulation.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef analyze_vaccine_efficacy():\n    \"\"\"\n    Analyzes whether 1-IRR overestimates, underestimates, or correctly estimates\n    per-exposure VE for an all-or-nothing vaccine.\n    \"\"\"\n    # --- 1.
