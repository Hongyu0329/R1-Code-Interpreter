    "To solve this problem, we need to find the size of the largest set that can be formed by uniting 20 antichains in the divisor poset of the number `N = 823564528378596`.\n\n### Plan\n\n1.  **Understand the Mathematical Structure**: The set of divisors of a number `N`, ordered by the \"divides\" relation, forms a mathematical structure called a partially ordered set (poset). If the prime factorization of `N` is `p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * ... * p_m^{a_m}`, this poset has a special structure: it's a product of chains.\n\n2.  **Use a Key Theorem**: For this type of poset, a fundamental result in combinatorics (related to Dilworth's and Greene's theorems) states that the largest union of `k` antichains is obtained by taking the union of the `k` largest \"rank levels\". A rank level is the set of all divisors that have the same rank, and it is always an antichain.\n\n3.  **Define Rank**: The rank of a divisor `d = p_1^{b_1} * p_2^{b_2} * ... * p_m^{b_m}` is the sum of the exponents in its prime factorization: `rank(d) = b_1 + b_2 + ... + b_m`.\n\n4.  **Steps for Calculation**:\n    a.  **Prime Factorization**: First, we find the prime factorization of `N = 823564528378596` to determine the exponents `a_1, a_2, ...`.\n    b.  **Calculate Rank Sizes**: We then calculate the size of each rank level. The number of divisors at a given rank `r` is the number of ways the exponents `b_i` can sum to `r` (with the constraint `0 <= b_i <= a_i`). This can be computed by finding the coefficients of a product of polynomials: `P(x) = (1 + x + ... + x^{a_1}) * (1 + x + ... + x^{a_2}) * ...`. The coefficient of `x^r` in this polynomial is the size of the rank `r`.\n    c.  **Find the Largest Ranks**: We will generate a list of all rank sizes.\n    d.  **Sum the Top 20**: Finally, we sort this list in descending order and sum the top 20 values to get our answer.\n\nThe following Python script implements this plan.\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ndef get_largest_k_antichain_union_size(n, k):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the size of the largest union of k antichains in the divisor poset of n.\n\n    This is equivalent to summing the sizes of the k largest rank levels in the poset.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Prime factorize the number n to get the exponents.\n    factors = collections.defaultdict(int)\n    d = 2\n    temp_n = n\n    while d * d <= temp_n:\n        while temp_n % d == 0:\n            factors[d] += 1\n            temp_n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if temp_n > 1:\n        factors[temp_n] += 1\n    \n    exponents = list(factors.values())\n    if not exponents:\n        # This case handles n=1, where there is only one divisor.\n        print(\"The number has only 1 divisor.\")\n        return 1\n\n    # Step 2: Calculate rank sizes using polynomial multiplication.\n    # The size of rank r is the coefficient of x^r in the polynomial product:\n    # P(x) = product_{a in exponents} (1 + x + ... + x^a)\n    \n    # Represents the polynomial for rank sizes.
