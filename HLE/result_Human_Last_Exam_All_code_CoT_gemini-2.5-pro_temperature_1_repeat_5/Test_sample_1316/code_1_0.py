# The user wants to understand the genetic event leading to an X0 male Drosophila
# in Bridges' experiments.

# 1. Define the offspring's genetic makeup.
offspring_sex_chromosomes = "X0"
offspring_phenotype = "red eyes, miniature wings"
# This means the single X chromosome carries the alleles for red eyes (w+) and miniature wings (m).
# Let's denote this chromosome as X_pheno.

# 2. Recall the formation of a zygote.
# Zygote = Egg + Sperm

# 3. To get an X0 zygote, there are two possibilities for the gametes:
# Possibility A: Egg(X_pheno) + Sperm(O) -> Zygote(X0)
# This requires the father to produce a sperm with no sex chromosome ("nullo-sperm").
# This happens due to non-disjunction during male meiosis (spermatogenesis).

# Possibility B: Egg(O) + Sperm(X_pheno) -> Zygote(X0)
# This requires the mother to produce an egg with no sex chromosome ("nullo-X egg").
# This happens due to non-disjunction during female meiosis (oogenesis).

# 4. Consider the historical context of Bridges' experiments.
# Bridges observed exceptional offspring that were best explained by a single event.
# Non-disjunction in Meiosis I in the male produces two types of abnormal sperm: XY and nullo (O).
# - A normal X egg fertilized by a nullo-sperm gives an X0 male (as seen in the question).
# - A normal X egg fertilized by an XY-sperm gives an XXY female (the other exceptional offspring Bridges found).
# This single event (male non-disjunction) explains both types of exceptional offspring.
# Therefore, the observation of an X0 male is considered strong evidence for non-disjunction in the male parent.

# 5. Evaluate the given options based on this conclusion.
# A. Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis I -> Incorrect parent.
# B. Non-disjunction of the X chromosome in female meiosis II -> Incorrect parent.
# C. Non-disjunction involving the Y chromosome during male meiosis -> Correct parent and process. This event (e.g., failure of X and Y to separate in meiosis I) produces the nullo-sperm required.
# D. Non-disjunction involving autosomes -> Incorrect chromosome type.
# E. A de novo mutation -> Incorrect type of genetic event (mutation vs. aneuploidy).

# The correct answer is C.
