    This function determines and prints the set partition for Chapter 39 of The Tale of Genji.

    In the Genji-kō incense game, each of the 52 chapters (from 2 to 53) is
    associated with a unique pattern representing a partition of a set of five elements.
    The pattern for Chapter 39, "Yūgiri", is one where the first three incense
    sticks are of the same scent, and the last two are each different.

    This corresponds to the partition where elements {1, 2, 3} are in one set,
    {4} is in its own set, and {5} is in its own set.
